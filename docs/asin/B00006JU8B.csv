719137,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,B00006JU8B,A. Eby,"[2, 3]","""Lovely and Amazing"" is an interesting, well-acted film about family and relationships, and the struggles of the individuals in them. I enjoyed it, yet found it a bit unfocused. In the end, it didn't seem quite as cohesive as it should have been. A bit fragmentary, perhaps. I'm not sorry I saw it, and I appreciated the performances of Catherine Keener (always a pleasure), Emily Mortimer, Brenda Blethyn, and Raven Goodwin. The writer and director Nicole Holofcener has talent and I look forward to her next project. I just felt like ""Lovely and Amazing"" could've been a bit better.",3,Doesn't Quite Live Up To Its Potential,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,584,"['Lovely', 'Amazing', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'film', 'family', 'relationships', 'struggles', 'individuals', 'enjoyed', 'yet', 'found', 'bit', 'unfocused', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'as', 'cohesive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'fragmentary', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'saw', 'appreciated', 'performances', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'always', 'pleasure', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'writer', 'director', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'talent', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'project', 'just', 'felt', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'better']",Lovely & Amazing
719138,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00006JU8B,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[7, 12]","My first reaction after watching the film was ""Gee, actors/actresses are so seasonal.""  Catherine Keener was just in S1m0ne and Jake Gyllenhaal was just in The Good Girl (playing pretty much the same character who has relationships with older women).Setting the trivial aside, I think Nicole Holofcener's ""Lovely and Amazing"" is an interesting, albeit a little bit depressing, film of three sisters (two biological, and one adopted) with problems on just about everything - life, love and career.  This film follows the ups and the downs of the Marks women in their various quests for boyfriends, better looks, fulfilling jobs, etc.Catherine Keener is the cornerstone of this film.  She plays Michelle Marks, the eldest daughter of Jane (Brenda Blethyn).  Michelle is a stay-at-home wife who likes to dabble in handicrafts (which she desperately tries to sell).  Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer) is Michelle's younger biological sister.  She's an actress with a heart of gold but with major insecurities about her looks.  Annie (Raven Goodwin) is Jane's adopted African-American daughter (thereby making her the stepsister of Michelle and Elizabeth); she also has the most memorable scenes.  Her naive view of the world and her strong sense of self makes up for the ""amazing"" in the title.Things just don't go right for any of the women.  Michelle's marriage has stagnated, and she is obliged to find a job.  Elizabeth was turned down for a role opposite Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney) for not being ""sexy"" enough.  Annie is confused at why she's so different from her sisters (skin color and all).  Jane suffers post-operative complications from her liposuction.  Just when all the world seems to tumble and fall, the Marks women take comfort in knowing they still have each other to hold on to.  Now that's the ""lovely"" part of this movie.I think this film is geared more towards a female audience.  I'm not saying men wouldn't enjoy this film either, but it would hardly be one they would watch alone.  ;)LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (a lot of candid humor and witty remarks, esp. by Annie)E (Erotica) - 3.5 (""tell me what you think.  be honest.""  full two-minute frontal)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 2.5 (not much of a plot, explores a dysfunctional family, and how they learn to accept who they are and take stock in what they have)",4,I'll tell you what's Lovely and what's Amazing...,1031529600,"09 9, 2002",2002,2377,"['first', 'reaction', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'Gee', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'so', 'seasonal', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'was', 'just', 'S1m0ne', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'just', 'Good', 'Girl', 'playing', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'who', 'relationships', 'older', 'women', '.Setting', 'trivial', 'aside', 'think', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'interesting', 'little', 'bit', 'depressing', 'film', 'three', 'sisters', 'two', 'biological', 'one', 'adopted', 'problems', 'just', 'everything', 'life', 'love', 'career', 'film', 'ups', 'downs', 'Marks', 'women', 'various', 'quests', 'boyfriends', 'better', 'looks', 'fulfilling', 'jobs', 'etc.Catherine', 'Keener', 'cornerstone', 'film', 'Michelle', 'Marks', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Michelle', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'who', 'dabble', 'handicrafts', 'desperately', 'sell', 'Elizabeth', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Michelle', 'younger', 'biological', 'sister', 'actress', 'heart', 'gold', 'major', 'insecurities', 'looks', 'Annie', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'Jane', 'adopted', 'African-American', 'daughter', 'thereby', 'making', 'stepsister', 'Michelle', 'Elizabeth', 'also', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'naive', 'view', 'world', 'strong', 'sense', 'self', 'up', 'amazing', 'title.Things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'right', 'women', 'Michelle', 'marriage', 'stagnated', 'obliged', 'find', 'job', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'opposite', 'Kevin', 'McCabe', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'not', 'being', 'sexy', 'enough', 'Annie', 'confused', 'why', 'so', 'different', 'sisters', 'skin', 'color', 'Jane', 'post-operative', 'complications', 'liposuction', 'Just', 'when', 'world', 'tumble', 'fall', 'Marks', 'women', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'still', 'have', 'other', 'hold', 'Now', 'lovely', 'part', 'movie.I', 'think', 'film', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'female', 'audience', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'men', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'alone', 'LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '3', 'lot', 'candid', 'humor', 'witty', 'remarks', 'esp', 'Annie', 'E', 'Erotica', '3.5', 'tell', 'what', 'think', 'be', 'honest', 'full', 'two-minute', 'frontal', 'A', 'Action', '0', 'n/a', 'P', 'Plot', '2.5', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'how', 'learn', 'accept', 'who', 'are', 'take', 'stock', 'what', 'have']",Lovely & Amazing
719139,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00006JU8B,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[4, 8]","I'll be honest. I got this movie because I saw Jake Gyllenhaal's name on the cover and as a huge fan of his work, I thought I would give this movie a look. I'm kind of sorry I even bothered to look. This movie is drab and dull and drags along with not a whole lot happening and when something does nobody seems to make a big deal out of it, yet I get the feeling they want you to make a big deal out of it.Michelle is a housewife, bored, and spending her time making useless miniature, ugly chairs and painting handmade wrapping paper that she wants to sell at an outrageous price. She's not a bad artist, but she should get in line-- there are lots of starving artists and you can't start out on top. Elizabeth is her sister, a neurotic actress who doesn't like herself. Michelle doesn't like herself either. And what do you know, their mother goes in for liposuction in the beginning of the movie because she doesn't like herself either. These three women manage to drag the young, adopted sister named Annie into their completely neurotic lives as well.The dialouge is witty at times and Dermot Mulroney swooops in and saves this movie a little bit. Even Gyllenhaal (who is hardly in the movie at all) saves the flick as well, creating some necessary action. But I get the feeling I've seen this Gyllenhaal character before... (could it be a less depressing version of the kid he plays in The Good Girl??!!) Without a doubt though, the character Annie is the saving grace in this movie, providing some necessary laughs and great insight for such a young girl. Aside from Dermot and Jake, she's the real reason to watch this movie.The film wrapped way to quickly for me without much resolution for any of the characters-- well, except for the mother. This could have been a better movie, but hey-- it is what it is. A humdrum, dull, kinda witty, kinda cute in spots, little bit weird movie. Check it out sometime when you're not sure what you want to watch.

719144,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B00006JU8B,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[17, 22]","... Lovely and Amazing is both of those things; it has great heart, great humor and great truth about many aspects of the female existence. It deals, in large measure, with discontent about the self--physically, creatively, and interpersonally. Brenda Blethyn gives, as always, a flawless performance as a woman who, above all else, loves her daughters--despite their anger and fear and uncertainty.What is especially appealing about the movie is its avoidance of cliched situations and characters while managing to convey in the case of the Hollywood casting/agency world, for example, the subtle horror of trying to succeed as an actor in a business that thrives on egocentricity, the misuse of power, and dishonesty. Dealing (or not, in the case of Blethyn who fantasizes about Michael Nouri, her plastic surgeon) with men is tricky territory. And in a performance worthy of his considerable talent, Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the narcissistic movie star with a hidden vein of honesty.Our initial impression of the adult Marks women is subtly, gradually altered as their experiences in the course of the film both give and take away what they seem to want most. And, ironically, the one character who is most herself in the truest sense, is little Raven Goodwin as Annie. This child is actually lovely and amazing and she is, ultimately, the beacon of unflappable self-containment, steadily eating, and shining the laser light of her unfettered vision on everyone around her. Annie is an extraordinary creation, brought completely to life by this admirable child.This movie will, undoubtedly, be snidely termed a ""chick flick."" Sadly, the men who've so far offered their opinions were clearly not open to the subtext of the script. Not one of the women gets what she thinks she wants, but in the end what they have is something better: each other.A fine script, fine performances, and an entirely refreshing look at a family of females who only seem typical.

Though the main characters are all bruised women - wannabe actress, flailing crafts-maker housewife, adopted African American 8 year old who grapples with obesity/skin color/genetic parent memories, and the mother of all three of these who places her 'embarassingly aging body' in the hands of a plastic surgeon - the etiology of thier dysfunction is tightly joined to their questionable ability to interact with men.  The men range from a womanizing husband, an insensitive lover, an 'unavailable' doctor who begin the path toward the women's testing their needs and fears with movie stars and adolescents.  In the hands of a lesser writer/director this could be corny, but with Nicole Holofcener's skill she creates plausible people and situations that are the perfect blend of  comedy with tragedy.  The cast is outstanding:  Brenda Blethyn's mother demonstrates once again how versatile this actress truly is, Catherine Keener and Emily Mortimer and Raven Goodwin give us fully realised characters and the contributions of the ""good guys"" Jake Gyllenhall and  Dermot Mulroney really bring heart to the story.  The remainder of the cast is uniformly strong.

Some people feel that the dialog is very good, although on occasion it felt a bit off to me. The story doesn't really go much of anywhere, but that's not really the point of a film like this. The acting in this movie was uniformly very good among the women.""Lovely and Amazing"" documents several days in the life of a mother and her three daughters. The mother, Jane (Brenda Blethyn), is in the midst of a mid-life crisis and decides to service herself through a liposuction treatment. As she is going through with the procedure, she asks her daughter Michelle (Catherine Keener) to take care of her younger, adopted sister Annie (Raven Goodwin). Michelle is a house-wife/artist who becomes so enthralled in her work of home-made miniature chairs that she asks ridiculous prices for them before storming out of stores at their disapproval. The third sister, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), is rescuing homeless dogs in between visits to her agent. Having just completed her roll in a Hollywood film, Elizabeth does her best to stay a humanitarian en route to what she wants to be success.Eventually, all four women's problems are projected in full effect. Jake Gyllenhaal reprises his role as the adolescent rou&eacute; who somehow ends up bedding Catherine Keener (just like Jennifer Aniston in ""The Good Girl""). He is perfectly cast with his dark, sultry looks, and wild puppy eyes.  Raven Goodwin played her part naturally well and shined on every scene. She is clearly a very talented actress and I've notice recently a lot of child actors on screen are really getting better in their roles. Finally we have Aunjanue Ellis who I believe is one of the most underrated African-American females on the screen today who has dramatize her role just as well as the rest of the cast, she seriously needs to have bigger parts to show off her full abilities. The men in the film have smaller roles because this is a film about (but not exclusively for) women. They include Jane's cosmetic surgeon, Michelle's husband, Elizabeth's boyfriend, Kevin McCabe (a star who Elizabeth reads for a part with, played by Dermot Mulroney).""Lovely & Amazing"" is a crazy entertaining movie.

719152,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00006JU8B,K. Driscoll,"[7, 8]","Lovely and Amazing is a feminine picture (albeit still watchable for a man) and it is also a deeply depressing story that briefly peaks into the lives of two women and their mother.  It is slow and somewhat awkward but it retains it's positive side at the end with notably almost no resolution whatsoever. The film paces itself very slowly, yet somehow works well because it is written and handled with a refreshing eye.  Nicole Hilofcenter (Sex and the City) directs.Catherine Keener plays one of the daughters, Michelle, a 36 year old unemployed mother of one young daughter.  Her husband is easy to relate to for a man and his patience as a character is exceptional because Keener's character has a highly volatile temper and she is for what it's worth completely unreasonable, yet somehow likeable at the same time.  She sees herself as an artist and we watch her fail at that and then become a clerk at a one hour photo.  There she has an affair with her 17 year old boss played by Jake Gyllenhaul.  Things unfold for her as expected and I for one feel she gets what she deserves.Her insecure younger sister Elizabeth, played by Emily Mortimer, on the other hand is originally dealt a fair hand and ironically gets it taken away as her insecurities are realized.  She sleeps with an actor who is boorish enough to be honest about whether she is sexy or pretty enough to be an actress.  You see, her being self-centered is seen as a requirement and that actually made it more fun for me to watch her fail.  She is finished with her one night stand with this actor, and asks that he critique her body.  She stands naked in front of him in a surprising, awkward and daring (for Mortimer) sequence.  Mortimer is certainly attractive enough to watch her fully nude for this long but it's such a cold and bleak scene that really comes out of nowhere, it is certainly not meant to be sensual.  She comes as who she is, vulnerable and probably not ready to enter the world of acting.  The film is loaded with moments like this that go against the grain and ultimately help the characters get used to themselves as much as they may resist.Their mother is in the midst of getting liposuction and the risks of surgery do indeed show themselves.  She has adopted a young African American girl which makes for some interesting comments regarding race as well as she is enrolled in a ""Big Sister"" kind of program to get exposure to another black person.  It's unfortunate that so little is said about their mother's past because she really ought to be the center of the film.  Her story and her adopted daughter's story may have been intended to be delved into further...perhaps some was left on the cutting room floor.All of the characters' fits of selfish vanity are always answered.  That seems to be the running theme and it gives you a different outlook on these things despite these characters being fundamentally good people. Is it really so wrong to ignore or displace blame for your own vanity so easily? If so, isn't it society that is doing it to us or should we be accountable for it?  Do we create our surrounding culture enough to pay the price for being ingrained within it's sins?  Is there anything we can do about it?  I know one thing, my latest job interview may go a hell of a lot better if I comb my hair and where a really nice suit then if I don't.  Then again just like anything, vanity has it's excesses.  Just as Lovely and Amazing finishes it's value in helping us ask interesting questions, it ends as unconventionally as it unfolds.  It's no classic, but it is films like this that if other filmmakers take note it can certainly provide different avenues for expression.",4,Interesting Little Movie,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,3691,"['Lovely', 'Amazing', 'feminine', 'picture', 'still', 'watchable', 'man', 'also', 'deeply', 'depressing', 'story', 'briefly', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'mother', 'slow', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'positive', 'side', 'end', 'notably', 'almost', 'resolution', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'paces', 'very', 'slowly', 'yet', 'somehow', 'well', 'written', 'handled', 'refreshing', 'eye', 'Nicole', 'Hilofcenter', 'Sex', 'City', 'directs.Catherine', 'Keener', 'one', 'daughters', 'Michelle', '36', 'year', 'old', 'unemployed', 'mother', 'one', 'young', 'daughter', 'husband', 'easy', 'relate', 'man', 'patience', 'character', 'exceptional', 'Keener', 'character', 'highly', 'volatile', 'temper', 'what', 'worth', 'completely', 'unreasonable', 'yet', 'somehow', 'likeable', 'same', 'time', 'artist', 'watch', 'fail', 'then', 'become', 'clerk', 'one', 'hour', 'photo', 'affair', '17', 'year', 'old', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaul', 'Things', 'unfold', 'expected', 'one', 'feel', 'what', 'insecure', 'younger', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'other', 'hand', 'originally', 'dealt', 'fair', 'hand', 'ironically', 'taken', 'away', 'insecurities', 'are', 'realized', 'actor', 'who', 'boorish', 'enough', 'be', 'honest', 'sexy', 'pretty', 'enough', 'be', 'actress', 'see', 'being', 'self-centered', 'seen', 'requirement', 'actually', 'made', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'fail', 'finished', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'actor', 'body', 'naked', 'front', 'surprising', 'awkward', 'daring', 'Mortimer', 'sequence', 'Mortimer', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'enough', 'watch', 'fully', 'nude', 'long', 'such', 'cold', 'bleak', 'scene', 'really', 'nowhere', 'certainly', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'sensual', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'probably', 'not', 'ready', 'enter', 'world', 'acting', 'film', 'loaded', 'moments', 'go', 'grain', 'ultimately', 'help', 'characters', 'get', 'used', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'resist.Their', 'mother', 'midst', 'getting', 'liposuction', 'risks', 'surgery', 'do', 'indeed', 'show', 'adopted', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'girl', 'interesting', 'comments', 'regarding', 'race', 'as', 'well', 'enrolled', 'Big', 'Sister', 'kind', 'program', 'get', 'exposure', 'black', 'person', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'little', 'said', 'mother', 'past', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'center', 'film', 'story', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'be', 'delved', 'further', 'perhaps', 'was', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.All', 'characters', 'fits', 'selfish', 'vanity', 'are', 'always', 'answered', 'be', 'running', 'theme', 'different', 'outlook', 'things', 'characters', 'being', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'people', 'really', 'so', 'wrong', 'ignore', 'displace', 'blame', 'own', 'vanity', 'easily', 'so', ""n't"", 'society', 'doing', 'should', 'be', 'accountable', 'Do', 'create', 'surrounding', 'culture', 'enough', 'pay', 'price', 'being', 'ingrained', 'sins', 'there', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'know', 'one', 'thing', 'latest', 'job', 'interview', 'may', 'go', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'comb', 'hair', 'where', 'really', 'nice', 'suit', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'Then', 'again', 'just', 'anything', 'vanity', 'excesses', 'Just', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'finishes', 'value', 'helping', 'ask', 'interesting', 'questions', 'as', 'unconventionally', 'classic', 'films', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'note', 'can', 'certainly', 'provide', 'different', 'avenues', 'expression']",Lovely & Amazing
719153,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00006JU8B,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[2, 3]","This is a tale about multiple insecurities. There's a mother who's insecure about her body and so goes for liposuction. There's her married daughter who's insecure about a whole lot of things. There's her single daughter who's insecure about her looks because she's an actress, or trying to be, and is not sure is she's sexy enough. And there's her adopted daughter--an 8-year old black girl--who's insecure about the way she looks also.This whole nest of insecurities gets these folks into a bunch of wacky situations. The dialogue here is smart and sharp and natural, and that's a really good thing, and so we do get a chance to dig into these characters' psyches. At the same time, even though things don't always turn out for the better along the way, making the film more 'realistic', there's something missing here.It feels like a kind of forced realism, as though the situations, or at least a couple of them, happen the way they do to let the audience know that, guess what, things DON'T always turn out the way we hope they will. We know they don't; it's just ever so slightly cringe-producing to see a film where you sort of feel like the filmmaker is bending over backwards to show this. True, more of the situations do feel natural than these forced ones. But the forcing does come through, unfortunately, and gets in the way of what could have been a superior effort.Overall this is not a bad film at all. The married daughter wants to be an artist and some of her work is fairly good, but the situation of nobody thinking so in a commercial establishment brings her down, understandably. Her unsympathetic husband tells her to get a job and she does, working at a one-hour photo shop. Complications ensue.Complications also ensue when the mother goes in for liposuction and the single daughter auditions for a part in a film and the adopted daughter, willful to the max, does all kinds of things without telling anybody. This was a tough call, choosing between 3 and 4 stars. I gave it 4 because the acting is top notch and the writing is more often than not also great.Some snags, but definitely worth a look.",4,Insecurity on display,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2124,"['tale', 'multiple', 'insecurities', 'mother', 'who', 'insecure', 'body', 'so', 'liposuction', 'married', 'daughter', 'who', 'insecure', 'whole', 'lot', 'things', 'single', 'daughter', 'who', 'insecure', 'looks', 'actress', 'trying', 'be', 'not', 'sure', 'sexy', 'enough', 'adopted', 'daughter', '8-year', 'old', 'black', 'girl', 'who', 'insecure', 'way', 'also.This', 'whole', 'nest', 'insecurities', 'folks', 'bunch', 'wacky', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'here', 'smart', 'sharp', 'natural', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'so', 'do', 'get', 'chance', 'dig', 'characters', 'psyches', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'more', ""'realistic"", 'something', 'missing', 'here.It', 'feels', 'kind', 'forced', 'realism', 'situations', 'least', 'couple', 'happen', 'way', 'do', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'guess', 'what', 'things', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'hope', 'will', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'cringe-producing', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'sort', 'feel', 'filmmaker', 'bending', 'backwards', 'show', 'True', 'more', 'situations', 'do', 'feel', 'natural', 'forced', 'ones', 'forcing', 'come', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'superior', 'effort.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'married', 'daughter', 'be', 'artist', 'work', 'fairly', 'good', 'situation', 'nobody', 'thinking', 'so', 'commercial', 'establishment', 'down', 'understandably', 'unsympathetic', 'husband', 'get', 'job', 'working', 'one-hour', 'photo', 'shop', 'Complications', 'ensue.Complications', 'also', 'ensue', 'when', 'mother', 'liposuction', 'single', 'daughter', 'auditions', 'part', 'film', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'willful', 'max', 'kinds', 'things', 'telling', 'anybody', 'was', 'tough', 'call', 'choosing', '3', '4', 'stars', 'gave', '4', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'writing', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'also', 'great.Some', 'snags', 'definitely', 'look']",Lovely & Amazing
719154,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00006JU8B,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[20, 21]","The four females in ""Lovely & Amazing"" look at themselves through a self-cracked mirror. Jane (Brenda Blethyn) is a well-off woman in her 50s who cares enough about others to adopt Annie (Raven Goodwin), an 8-year-old African-American girl whose birth mother is a crack addict. Jane also cares enough about herself to sign up for cosmetic surgery ($10,000 a pop and no insurance) to remove 10 pounds from her midriff.Along with Annie, Jane has two adult daughters. The older one, Michelle (Catherine Keener), is a former homecoming queen who has turned into a childish, self-centered neurotic. Though Michelle's husband constantly prods her to get a job, she fancies herself an artist. She makes miniature chairs to sell to knickknack shops, but no one's buying.Michelle's younger sister, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), is a beautiful aspiring actress who's already landing some small movie roles. But she has such a distorted self-image that she thinks of herself as unattractive -- even as she's posing for a photo spread in Vogue. Asked to do a ""chemistry"" audition with a big star named Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney), she's forced to listen while casting agents casually appraise her sexuality -- or lack thereof.Both sisters are stuck in unfulfilling relationships. Elizabeth's overcritical live-in boyfriend is tired of hearing her obsess about her auditions, her resume photos, her agent, etc. Meanwhile, Michelle's sullen self-absorption and testy attitude have worn down her husband to the point that he's not especially interested in sleeping with her. To spite him, she takes a menial job at a one-hour photo shop, where her teenage boss (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes a Mrs. Robinson-like interest in her.As she proved in her fine 1996 film, ""Walking and Talking,"" director Holofcener has an uncanny understanding of people as well as a gift for sharp, funny dialogue. Yes, ""Lovely & Amazing"" will probably spawn noxiously shallow lifestyle pieces on why women have poor self-esteem. But the film is much subtler and more complex than that.The entire cast is terrific, from Goodwin to Mulroney. But you have to focus on Keener, perhaps best known for her role as the merciless co-worker of John Cusack in ""Being John Malkovich,"" who's become the Queen of Late Summer. She's creating her own type -- the acerbic smarts and ironic world-view of wisecracking dames like Rosalind Russell or ""Frasier's"" Peri Gilpin, with a twist of simmering anger and a drop of self-loathing. As vulnerable as she is venomous, she doesn't want to be the way she is, but she can't quite give it up, either.Deftly directed, winningly acted and shrewdly written, ""Lovely & Amazing"" is as softhearted as it is ruthless, as amusing as it is poignant, but it does have its faults. Mostly, it doesn't offer a lovely and amazing final resolution, one reason why I wish it went on longer. It's an engrossing and emotional film that every woman (and gay man) should see.",4,the title describes the film!!!,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",2003,2943,"['four', 'females', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'look', 'self-cracked', 'mirror', 'Jane', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'well-off', 'woman', '50s', 'who', 'enough', 'others', 'adopt', 'Annie', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', '8-year-old', 'African-American', 'girl', 'birth', 'mother', 'crack', 'addict', 'Jane', 'also', 'enough', 'sign', 'up', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', '10,000', 'pop', 'insurance', 'remove', '10', 'pounds', 'midriff.Along', 'Annie', 'Jane', 'two', 'adult', 'daughters', 'older', 'one', 'Michelle', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'former', 'homecoming', 'queen', 'who', 'turned', 'childish', 'self-centered', 'neurotic', 'Michelle', 'husband', 'constantly', 'get', 'job', 'artist', 'miniature', 'chairs', 'sell', 'knickknack', 'shops', 'one', 'buying.Michelle', 'younger', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'beautiful', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'already', 'landing', 'small', 'movie', 'roles', 'distorted', 'self-image', 'unattractive', 'even', 'posing', 'photo', 'spread', 'Vogue', 'Asked', 'do', 'chemistry', 'audition', 'big', 'star', 'named', 'Kevin', 'McCabe', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'forced', 'listen', 'casting', 'agents', 'casually', 'appraise', 'sexuality', 'lack', 'thereof.Both', 'sisters', 'are', 'stuck', 'unfulfilling', 'relationships', 'Elizabeth', 'overcritical', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'tired', 'hearing', 'obsess', 'auditions', 'resume', 'photos', 'agent', 'etc', 'Meanwhile', 'Michelle', 'sullen', 'self-absorption', 'testy', 'attitude', 'have', 'worn', 'down', 'husband', 'point', 'not', 'especially', 'interested', 'sleeping', 'spite', 'menial', 'job', 'one-hour', 'photo', 'shop', 'where', 'teenage', 'boss', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson-like', 'interest', 'her.As', 'proved', 'fine', '1996', 'film', 'Walking', 'Talking', 'director', 'Holofcener', 'uncanny', 'understanding', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'gift', 'sharp', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'Yes', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'will', 'probably', 'spawn', 'noxiously', 'shallow', 'lifestyle', 'pieces', 'why', 'women', 'have', 'poor', 'self-esteem', 'film', 'much', 'subtler', 'more', 'complex', 'that.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'terrific', 'Goodwin', 'Mulroney', 'have', 'focus', 'Keener', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'merciless', 'co-worker', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'become', 'Queen', 'Late', 'Summer', 'creating', 'own', 'type', 'acerbic', 'smarts', 'ironic', 'world-view', 'wisecracking', 'dames', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Frasier', 'Peri', 'Gilpin', 'twist', 'simmering', 'anger', 'drop', 'self-loathing', 'As', 'vulnerable', 'venomous', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'give', 'up', 'either.Deftly', 'directed', 'winningly', 'acted', 'shrewdly', 'written', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'as', 'softhearted', 'ruthless', 'as', 'amusing', 'poignant', 'have', 'faults', 'Mostly', ""n't"", 'offer', 'lovely', 'amazing', 'final', 'resolution', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'wish', 'went', 'longer', 'engrossing', 'emotional', 'film', 'woman', 'gay', 'man', 'should', 'see']",Lovely & Amazing

It simply presents some of the problems women face today, then lets the viewer come up with his or her own thoughts on the issues.Jane Marks [Brenda Blethyn] has decided to have liposuction at the age of fiftysomething. She asks her older daughters, Michelle [Catherine Keener] and Elizabeth [Emily Mortimer] to look after the youngest sibling, Lorraine [Aunjanue Ellis], an adopted Afro-American. All of these women have serious issues. Jane is fighting her advancing age. Michelle is an artistic type who has never found a satisfactory outlet for her talents and whose marriage is decidedly rocky. Elizabeth is an actress obsessed with her body, her looks and her image in general. Lorraine has a weight problem and confusion about her identity. This may sound like the ingredients for a soap opera or a dark comedy, but it is neither. It is a deeply etched group of character studies, and one of the most honest and revealing movies about women I have ever seen.Greatly adding to the film's impact are the performances by all of the female leads. In supporting roles, Jake Gyllenhaal and Dermot Mulroney are excellent as the men that Elizabeth and Michelle turn to in their desperation.",4,Insightful and very well acted,1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,1446,"['Lovely', 'Amazing', 'vivid', 'portrait', 'middle-class', 'American', 'mother', 'three', 'daughters', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'are', 'few', 'pat', 'answers', 'here', 'moral', 'judgments', 'calls', 'vengeance', 'males', 'society', 'general', 'simply', 'problems', 'women', 'face', 'today', 'then', 'viewer', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'thoughts', 'issues.Jane', 'Marks', '[', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', ']', 'decided', 'have', 'liposuction', 'age', 'fiftysomething', 'older', 'daughters', 'Michelle', '[', 'Catherine', 'Keener', ']', 'Elizabeth', '[', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', ']', 'look', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'Lorraine', '[', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', ']', 'adopted', 'Afro-American', 'women', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'Jane', 'fighting', 'advancing', 'age', 'Michelle', 'artistic', 'type', 'who', 'never', 'found', 'satisfactory', 'outlet', 'talents', 'marriage', 'decidedly', 'rocky', 'Elizabeth', 'actress', 'obsessed', 'body', 'looks', 'image', 'general', 'Lorraine', 'weight', 'problem', 'confusion', 'identity', 'may', 'sound', 'ingredients', 'soap', 'opera', 'dark', 'comedy', 'neither', 'deeply', 'etched', 'group', 'character', 'studies', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'revealing', 'movies', 'women', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Greatly', 'adding', 'film', 'impact', 'are', 'performances', 'female', 'leads', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'are', 'excellent', 'men', 'Elizabeth', 'Michelle', 'turn', 'desperation']",Lovely & Amazing

I think the film's success or failure depends largely on how you perceive/like/tolerate/love/hate Catherine Keener; for she is the kingpin and the do or die of this movie.On the negative side, Catherine Keener-wise, she has pretty much been playing the same role for the last ten years: super smart, a bit needy, marginally successful, and sometimes strident.  And she exhibits many of these traits in the role of eldest daughter Michelle Marks, daughter of Jane (Brenda Blethyn) and older sister of Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer).On the positive side, Keener has some rare for her quiet, dramatic scenes that she handles with aplomb. These scenes mostly involve her mother and her stepsister and they are refreshing in that Keener is allowed to show her softer, vulnerable side. She also has some hilarious, loopy, smartly written and directed scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal as her erstwhile and amorous ""boyfriend.""""Lovely and Amazing"" follows the lives and loves, the ups and the downs of the Marks women in their various quests for boyfriends, flatter tummies, fulfilling jobs, etc.Holcener has infused the film with humor and a slightly off-center wit that carry the film along at a fast clip but she also knows how and when to slow down the pace and get serious.  There are many touching scenes such as the one between Elizabeth and Kevin McCabe (Dermot Mulroney) in which she asks him to assess her naked body because, like most of us, she has body issues. He reacts by pointing out the mostly good as well as the not so bad.  He calls the incident ""refreshing"" and indeed it is in an astringent, gee-she's-really naked-for-three-minutes kind of way.  Heretofore, McCabe, an actor and closet good guy has been painted as a jerk but Elizabeth obviously sees something we don't and proves to be right.""Lovely and Amazing"" is a rare breed of film: one that can make you laugh and then laugh harder.

Quite unusual in that we the voyeur, are asked to do the same with lingering shots of her.

Their mother is thrown in the mix as another in the family uncomfortable with her own body.  She has adopted a crack baby who is now about 12 and has her own issues.  While not laugh-out-loud funny, the movie is certainly an amusing chick flick.  While men play a secondary and less important role, it is not suggested they are mean or scoundrels.

719162,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00006JU8B,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 7]","There are some good things in this film.  No 1 is the performance of Catherine Keener, who has the ability to make even the most odious of characters likable.  ('loved her in Being John Malkovich)  The next best thing is the performance of Raven Goodwin, who makes every scene she's in a delight.  (Whoever did her hair in the last scenes should have won an Oscar.)  Next:  the always adorable Jake Gyllenhaal, playing a nerdy 17 who falls for the Keener character.  (Whoever did his hair, though, should be fired...it's sooo black and shiney!)  Next:  a small part by Dermot Mulroney, resembling a young Sylvester Stallone--very cute.The dialogue is smart.  I found the pacing quick and it held my interest.  The other actors are good enough.  There are some worthy ideas introduced.  I loved the scene with Gyllenhal and Keener in the car and later, the one with Keener and Goodwin in MacDonalds.On the negative side:  gee--these women are so damned spoiled, self centered and highly unrealistic! We're supposed to care about them but they make it hard! The Emiy Mortimer character is about as sexy or interesting as a dishrag, and has the same amount of presence.  Who could imagine her succeeding as an actress? She should definitely get a job in an animal shelter.  The Keener character has delusions of grandeur, trying to peddle off her childish crafts as ""art"" at ridiculous prices.  When she got a job at the one-hour photo, it was the best thing she ever did, (after giving birth.)  However these girls didn't stand a chance, with the mothering given them by the smart talking (supposedly) mom who doesn't have a good word to say about any men, but wants the plastic surgeon to like her.

719165,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006JU8B,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 11]","Lovely and Amazing (Nicole Holofcener, 2001)Nicole Holofcener (Sex and the City, Gilmore Girls, Six Feet Under) delivers her second feature film in which a lot of people do a lot of talking and no one actually does much of anything. This one centers around a mother (Brenda Blethyn, recently seen in Little Voice) who's about to go into the hospital for liposuction, and her three daughters, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer of The Ghost and the Darkness fame), Michelle (Catherine Keener from being John Malkovich), and adopted daughter Annie (Raven Goodwin, last seen in The Station Agent). The mother and the three daughters are all variously dysfunctional. Elizabeth, an actress, has a minor part in a movie that's about to open and no other forthcoming prospects. Michelle is an artists trying to consign her handicrafts to various art stores and failing repeatedly, while her husband is off knocking boots with her best friend. Annie, transracially adopted, is just trying to fit in however she can. Let's face it, it's an Oprah Movie Club pick waiting to happen, if Oprah ever starts a movie club.Still, it's got its good points. I rented it solely for the Jake Gyllenhaal factor, truth be told. While Gyllenhaal's entrance into the movie comes late, the boy is never less than a pleasure to watch onscreen, and he does a great deal to redeem the movie (his character is the catalyst that drives many of the few events that actually occur in the film). Dermot Mulroney, as a possible new relationship for Elizabeth, does some of his best work here since Young Guns (one wonders if, between this and The Safety of Objects, Mr. Mulroney isn't beginning to vault himself up onto the A list). The four main actresses are all very good in their roles, if not actually given much to do. Even the normally loathsome Brenda Blethyn is watchable (i.e., a bit less loathsome than usual), though she just doesn't sound right with an American accent.The strength of the movie, however, lies in Raven Goodwin. Annie's search for some way to fit in to the mess that is this family provides most of the movie's truly absorbing moments (the relationship between Keener and Gyllenhaal providing the rest of them). The rest of the movie seems to be made with an eye towards exciting a kind of embarrassed, nervous laughter from the viewer (and it succeeds well), but most of the scenes containing Annie aim for the heart, and without the usual emotional manipulation one is apt to find in most Hollywood fare. It's a refreshing change.If you want movies where lots of things happen, you can probably dismiss this. If you don't mind a slow pace and a lot of dysfunction, give it a look. ** ",3,Lacked coherence.,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,2671,"['Lovely', 'Amazing', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', '2001', 'Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'Sex', 'City', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Six', 'Feet', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'do', 'lot', 'talking', 'one', 'actually', 'much', 'anything', 'one', 'centers', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'recently', 'seen', 'Little', 'Voice', 'who', 'go', 'hospital', 'liposuction', 'three', 'daughters', 'Elizabeth', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'fame', 'Michelle', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'last', 'seen', 'Station', 'Agent', 'mother', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'variously', 'dysfunctional', 'Elizabeth', 'actress', 'minor', 'part', 'movie', 'open', 'other', 'forthcoming', 'prospects', 'Michelle', 'artists', 'trying', 'consign', 'handicrafts', 'various', 'art', 'stores', 'failing', 'repeatedly', 'husband', 'knocking', 'boots', 'best', 'friend', 'Annie', 'transracially', 'adopted', 'just', 'trying', 'fit', 'however', 'can', 'Let', 'face', 'Oprah', 'Movie', 'Club', 'pick', 'waiting', 'happen', 'Oprah', 'ever', 'movie', 'club.Still', 'got', 'good', 'points', 'rented', 'solely', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'factor', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'Gyllenhaal', 'entrance', 'movie', 'late', 'boy', 'never', 'less', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'onscreen', 'great', 'deal', 'redeem', 'movie', 'character', 'catalyst', 'many', 'few', 'events', 'actually', 'occur', 'film', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'possible', 'new', 'relationship', 'Elizabeth', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'Young', 'Guns', 'one', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'Mr.', 'Mulroney', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'vault', 'up', 'A', 'list', 'four', 'main', 'actresses', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'not', 'actually', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'Even', 'normally', 'loathsome', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'watchable', 'i.e.', 'bit', 'less', 'loathsome', 'usual', 'just', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'American', 'accent.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'however', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'Annie', 'search', 'way', 'fit', 'mess', 'family', 'most', 'movie', 'truly', 'absorbing', 'moments', 'relationship', 'Keener', 'Gyllenhaal', 'providing', 'rest', 'rest', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'eye', 'towards', 'exciting', 'kind', 'embarrassed', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'viewer', 'well', 'most', 'scenes', 'containing', 'Annie', 'aim', 'heart', 'usual', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'one', 'apt', 'find', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'refreshing', 'change.If', 'want', 'movies', 'where', 'lots', 'things', 'happen', 'can', 'probably', 'dismiss', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'pace', 'lot', 'dysfunction', 'give', 'look', '**']",Lovely & Amazing

There is close observation of details in how we talk to each other, much of which is very funny.

719167,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00006JU8B,Samuel McKewon,"[6, 6]","&quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot; is much of what &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; never was. It's about real women, women who make their own beds and lie in them, instead of having one disaster after another thrust upon to make their life miserable. It's about choices; a movie is usually far more exciting when a character makes decisions, instead of having the obvious thrown in their face.Eepecially good is Catherine Keener as a housewife entirely of bereft of ambition outside of erecting her worthless wooden crafts, which she insists on trying to sell for outrageous sums to unsmiling art dealers. Keener -- by choice, I suppose -- has shoehorned herself into playing the square peg in the round hole -- a sardonic, mouthy type who knows and thinks more than her position in life would indicate.There are two other sisters; One a shallow, insecure actress (Emily Mortimer) with a soft spot for stray animals, and the other an adopted 10-year-old black girl who's eaten too much fast food, has anger issues, and can hold her breath underwater a dangerously long time. Their mother is a fading beauty in her late fifties (Brenda Belthyn) heading in for plastic surgery.Visually, &quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot; is a little flat, which is fine for a talky, ruminating movie. Writer/director Nicole Hofencofer does a nice spoof on Hollywood agents and television hunks; one in particular, played by Dermot Mulroney, is more than interested in Mortimer's character outside of the audition room, even if they look like groping, suckfaced fools on the casting couch.Running through the two older sisters is a streak of self-torture -- Keener seems to like brawling with snobbish store owners, while Mortimer relishes the opportunity to have a man point out her physical flaws -- while the young girl is just beginning to learn, in possibly unhealthy ways, how to negotiate her own demons. The movie seems to hint, in fact, that troubled years are ahead for all of them, especially for Keener, who finally gets a job at a photolab only to start an affair with the 17-year-old manager. Mortimer, on the other hand, get the sadistic wish of temporary disfigurement through canine intervention.Blethyn spends much of the movie in the hospital enduring complications from her surgery, so she isn't left much to do. And yet she uses the inflections in her voice in more than one interaction with her daughters to suggest her disappointment, even as she describes them as the movie's title, &quot;lovely and amazing.&quot; It's a cute term of endearment, empty given the circumstances, although, given a better roll of the dice, we can see where these women might have been more.",3,"A smart, responsible take on dysfunctional women.",1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,2687,"['quot', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'quot', 'much', 'what', 'quot', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'quot', 'never', 'was', 'real', 'women', 'women', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'beds', 'lie', 'instead', 'having', 'one', 'disaster', 'thrust', 'make', 'life', 'miserable', 'choices', 'movie', 'usually', 'far', 'more', 'exciting', 'when', 'character', 'decisions', 'instead', 'having', 'obvious', 'thrown', 'face.Eepecially', 'good', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'housewife', 'entirely', 'bereft', 'ambition', 'erecting', 'worthless', 'wooden', 'crafts', 'trying', 'sell', 'outrageous', 'sums', 'unsmiling', 'art', 'dealers', 'Keener', 'choice', 'suppose', 'shoehorned', 'playing', 'square', 'peg', 'round', 'hole', 'sardonic', 'mouthy', 'type', 'who', 'more', 'position', 'life', 'would', 'indicate.There', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'sisters', 'One', 'shallow', 'insecure', 'actress', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'soft', 'spot', 'stray', 'animals', 'other', 'adopted', '10-year-old', 'black', 'girl', 'who', 'eaten', 'too', 'much', 'fast', 'food', 'anger', 'issues', 'can', 'hold', 'breath', 'underwater', 'dangerously', 'long', 'time', 'mother', 'fading', 'beauty', 'late', 'fifties', 'Brenda', 'Belthyn', 'heading', 'plastic', 'surgery.Visually', 'quot', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'quot', 'little', 'flat', 'fine', 'talky', 'ruminating', 'movie', 'Writer/director', 'Nicole', 'Hofencofer', 'nice', 'spoof', 'Hollywood', 'agents', 'television', 'hunks', 'one', 'particular', 'played', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'more', 'interested', 'Mortimer', 'character', 'audition', 'room', 'even', 'look', 'groping', 'suckfaced', 'fools', 'casting', 'couch.Running', 'two', 'older', 'sisters', 'streak', 'self-torture', 'Keener', 'like', 'brawling', 'snobbish', 'store', 'owners', 'Mortimer', 'opportunity', 'have', 'man', 'point', 'out', 'physical', 'flaws', 'young', 'girl', 'just', 'beginning', 'learn', 'possibly', 'unhealthy', 'ways', 'how', 'negotiate', 'own', 'demons', 'movie', 'hint', 'fact', 'troubled', 'years', 'are', 'ahead', 'especially', 'Keener', 'who', 'finally', 'job', 'photolab', 'only', 'start', 'affair', '17-year-old', 'manager', 'Mortimer', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'sadistic', 'wish', 'temporary', 'disfigurement', 'canine', 'intervention.Blethyn', 'much', 'movie', 'hospital', 'enduring', 'complications', 'surgery', ""n't"", 'left', 'much', 'do', 'yet', 'inflections', 'voice', 'more', 'one', 'interaction', 'daughters', 'suggest', 'disappointment', 'even', 'movie', 'title', 'quot', 'lovely', 'amazing.', 'quot', 'cute', 'term', 'endearment', 'empty', 'given', 'circumstances', 'given', 'better', 'roll', 'dice', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'women', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more']",Lovely & Amazing

The speed with which Catherine Keener, for instance, spits out four-letter wordsat those who reject her artwork is a delight to observe.On a deeper level, the film suggests that its characters' self-absorption is chosen, but that realized personhood rests in the decision to transcend the self and do what's needed for someone else.

The comedic tone this time is a lot darker as we observe a few days in the life of a mother and her three ""screwed-up"" daughters (two biological adults and an adopted African-American child).Holofcener again uses the acerbic Indie staple Catherine Keener, who plays the lazy, bored and arrogant eldest daughter. Keener is without doubt the best thing here, she's played this character many times before but does it so well the repitition hardly matters. If only the other characters were as engaging (or as painfully true to life).Lovely And Amazing suffers from the presence of a few flat (male) characters and one too many unresolved subplots.It's a more ambitious film than Walking And Talking and that's probably why it's not as satisfying.In an age of expensive, overpraised, CGI smothered, Tinseltown atrocities, the very existence of a small budgeted delight like Lovely And Amazing is quite revolutionary.",4,So sad about us.,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1052,"['Nicole', 'Holofcener', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'alot', 'terrific', 'moments', 'overall', 'pales', 'comparison', 'earlier', 'Walking', 'Talking', 'comedic', 'tone', 'time', 'lot', 'darker', 'observe', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'mother', 'three', 'screwed-up', 'daughters', 'two', 'biological', 'adults', 'adopted', 'African-American', 'child', '.Holofcener', 'again', 'acerbic', 'Indie', 'staple', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'lazy', 'bored', 'arrogant', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Keener', 'doubt', 'best', 'thing', 'here', 'played', 'character', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'well', 'repitition', 'hardly', 'matters', 'only', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'engaging', 'painfully', 'true', 'life', '.Lovely', 'Amazing', 'suffers', 'presence', 'few', 'flat', 'male', 'characters', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'unresolved', 'subplots.It', 'more', 'ambitious', 'film', 'Walking', 'Talking', 'probably', 'why', 'not', 'satisfying.In', 'age', 'expensive', 'overpraised', 'CGI', 'smothered', 'Tinseltown', 'atrocities', 'very', 'existence', 'small', 'budgeted', 'delight', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'quite', 'revolutionary']",Lovely & Amazing
719172,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00006JU8B,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""Lovely and Amazing"" is precisely that - an amazing drama about the struggles of ordinary women trying to feel better about themselves in a world that is too often harsh and cruel. Though the movie itself centers on a mother and her three daughters, their struggles are universal and can apply to men as well. The fantastic ensemble cast makes this a fine drama which had me cringing, laughing, and crying.Brenda Blethyn plays middle-aged Jane Marks who is mother to two adult daughters, i.e. Michelle (Catherine Keener), and Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), and adoptive mother of eight-year-old Annie (Raven Goodwin). Jane appears sensible and has plenty of suggestions and advice for her two adult daughters, yet she herself suffers from insecurities about her body image and decides to have a liposuction. Michelle is a thirty-something artist who can't seem to get anyone interested in purchasing her art and flounders in her marriage. Then there is pretty Elizabeth who struggles to find acting parts whilst feeling insecure about her body (not helped by an unsympathetic boyfriend). Eight-year-old Annie finds herself trying to fit in with this adoptive family, made even more difficult by the fact that she is African-American and her adoptive family is white.There are many real moments in this movie which are compellingly portrayed. Michelle's sense of insecurity about her marriage manifests itself by outbursts of anger and getting involved in an inappropriate relationship. Elizabeth's doubts about her talent and body image manifests itself in her penchant for bringing home stray dogs and caring for them. As for Annie, Raven Goodwin delivers a compelling performance (amazing given how young she is) as a conflicted and confused young girl who struggles to adapt and assimilate, and there's one scene involving a hair makeover that really saddened me.The actors deliver credible performances - this is truly a movie where the female actors dominate, yet I felt the male actors though acting in secondary roles, managed to carry their own. Dermot Mulroney shines as the actor/playboy, Clark Gregg as Bill, Michelle's husband, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Jordan, the high school student who manages a photo processing store! The movie benefits from good direction and I would highly recommend this to fans of movies that explore everyday people coping with life's struggles.",5,A credible portrait of women and their everyday struggles,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2390,"['Lovely', 'Amazing', 'precisely', 'amazing', 'drama', 'struggles', 'ordinary', 'women', 'trying', 'feel', 'better', 'world', 'too', 'often', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'movie', 'centers', 'mother', 'three', 'daughters', 'struggles', 'are', 'universal', 'can', 'apply', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'fine', 'drama', 'had', 'cringing', 'laughing', 'crying.Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'middle-aged', 'Jane', 'Marks', 'who', 'mother', 'two', 'adult', 'daughters', 'i.e', 'Michelle', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Elizabeth', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'eight-year-old', 'Annie', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'Jane', 'sensible', 'plenty', 'suggestions', 'advice', 'two', 'adult', 'daughters', 'yet', 'suffers', 'insecurities', 'body', 'image', 'decides', 'have', 'liposuction', 'Michelle', 'thirty-something', 'artist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'anyone', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'art', 'flounders', 'marriage', 'Then', 'pretty', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'find', 'acting', 'parts', 'whilst', 'feeling', 'insecure', 'body', 'not', 'helped', 'unsympathetic', 'boyfriend', 'Eight-year-old', 'Annie', 'trying', 'fit', 'adoptive', 'family', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'fact', 'African-American', 'adoptive', 'family', 'white.There', 'are', 'many', 'real', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'compellingly', 'portrayed', 'Michelle', 'sense', 'insecurity', 'marriage', 'manifests', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'getting', 'involved', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'Elizabeth', 'doubts', 'talent', 'body', 'image', 'penchant', 'bringing', 'home', 'stray', 'dogs', 'caring', 'Annie', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'compelling', 'performance', 'amazing', 'given', 'how', 'young', 'conflicted', 'confused', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'adapt', 'assimilate', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'hair', 'makeover', 'really', 'saddened', 'me.The', 'actors', 'deliver', 'credible', 'performances', 'truly', 'movie', 'where', 'female', 'actors', 'dominate', 'yet', 'felt', 'male', 'actors', 'acting', 'secondary', 'roles', 'managed', 'carry', 'own', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'shines', 'actor/playboy', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Bill', 'Michelle', 'husband', 'especially', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jordan', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'photo', 'processing', 'store', 'movie', 'benefits', 'good', 'direction', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'movies', 'explore', 'everyday', 'people', 'coping', 'life', 'struggles']",Lovely & Amazing
