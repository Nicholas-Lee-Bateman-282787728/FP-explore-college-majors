188610,A1UDL8R0OQDZ5P,1573306878,Anthony J. Simeone,"[8, 9]","Graphics were great!!  There were (I believe) 11 tracks, and each track was different in theme, which added spice to the DVD.  The entire musical theme was done in a rock musical format, with several tracks (2 or 3) actually had singing in it by Kerry Livgren (who was a member of the group: Kansas).  I felt that the music went extremely well with the graphics!!  It was very upbeat, not radical or harsh in any way, and there was very little singing in it - just music that helps sweep you away with the beautiful graphics.  If you dont like Rock, you may not like this DVD, but I still recomend giving it a try.  Some tracks featured spacey worlds, one had dinosaurs, spaceships, underwater scene with a dolphin being chased by a sea monster, tropical islands, robots, and just far out computer animation!  Highly recomended - I'd say that this is the best Computer Graphics DVD I've purchased (out of 6 so far).",5,Outstanding !!!

ANZIULEWICZ ""Chuck Anziulewicz""","[13, 28]","I've always dug computer animation, and I love the &quot;Mind's Eye&quot; series, but this particular installment is seriously hampered by the choice of Kerry Livgren (of the prog-rock outfit Kansas) to supply the music score. Musicians previously featured in the &quot;Mind's Eye&quot; series, such as Thomas Dolby and Jan Hammer, were appropriate choices. Livgren is not. I suppose I liked the band Kansas back in the mid 1970s when I was in high school, but today I wonder, &quot;What was I thinking???&quot; Such music is hopelessly incongruous for cutting-edge computer animation showcase ... and toward the end when Livgren actually starts SINGING is when I REALLY started to cringe. The eye candy here is just as enjoyable as always; but if you buy this, make sure you turn down the sound and listen to a nice techno or trance CD instead.",3,Subtract 2 stars for LOUSY music.,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,845,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'dug', 'computer', 'animation', 'love', 'quot', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'series', 'particular', 'installment', 'seriously', 'hampered', 'choice', 'Kerry', 'Livgren', 'prog-rock', 'outfit', 'Kansas', 'supply', 'music', 'score', 'Musicians', 'previously', 'featured', 'quot', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'series', 'such', 'Thomas', 'Dolby', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'were', 'appropriate', 'choices', 'Livgren', 'not', 'suppose', 'liked', 'band', 'Kansas', 'back', 'mid', '1970s', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'today', 'wonder', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Such', 'music', 'hopelessly', 'incongruous', 'cutting-edge', 'computer', 'animation', 'showcase', 'end', 'when', 'Livgren', 'actually', 'SINGING', 'when', 'REALLY', 'started', 'cringe', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'always', 'buy', 'make', 'sure', 'turn', 'down', 'sound', 'listen', 'nice', 'techno', 'trance', 'CD', 'instead']",N/A

The soundtrack, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.  It was apparently written by a guitarist from the group  Kansas but at any  rate is pretty lackluster.  The music varies between lame &amp; dull.  If I  were to rate just the computer animation alone, I would give this DVD 5  stars. If, on the other hand, I were to rate the music alone, I would give  it 1 star.  Therefore, I chose 3 stars as a happy medium.  Would highly  suggest that people interested in this genre check out Beyond The Mind's  Eye.  The soundtrack to it is written by Jan Hammer &amp; is far, far  superior to this one. The graphics on it are comparable to this.  I would  still recommend this DVD to those who are really, really into this type of  stuff as the computer animation almost makes up for the uninspired music.",3,"Great graphics, blah music",949795200,"02 6, 2000",2000,886,"['video', 'outstanding', 'computer', 'graphics', 'question', 'soundtrack', 'other', 'hand', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'apparently', 'written', 'guitarist', 'group', 'Kansas', 'rate', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'music', 'lame', 'amp', 'dull', 'were', 'rate', 'just', 'computer', 'animation', 'alone', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'rate', 'music', 'alone', 'would', 'give', '1', 'star', 'Therefore', 'chose', '3', 'stars', 'happy', 'medium', 'Would', 'highly', 'suggest', 'people', 'interested', 'genre', 'check', 'out', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'soundtrack', 'written', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'amp', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'one', 'graphics', 'are', 'comparable', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'type', 'stuff', 'computer', 'animation', 'almost', 'up', 'uninspired', 'music']",N/A

The audio track was written by Kerry Livgren, the musical genius behind most of the best work of Kansas, including &quot;Dust  In The Wind.&quot; The amazing thing about the music is that all of it was  written and performed by Livgren, who is multi-talented enough to play many  different instruments.

Lindeboom ""theboomer""","[15, 19]","One of the greatest things in this volume is the fact that it includes one  of the funniest computer animation sequences ever. With today's technology,  it's no great accomplishment to create wonderful action clips, etc., but  it's a great animator that can create truly human humor that makes you howl  with laughter. This one does it to the max! One of the funniest sequences  ever set to animation is here when a very Orwellian group of hammers pound  out a lifeless beat in synch with one another while a rebel hammer plays  all of the counter-point and syncopated rythyms, etc -- the peer group  pressure builds and the humor is pure belly laugh stuff! Great! The music  here is brilliant if you love art rock or what's called &quot;prog&quot;  but if you don't, then it's just too much for some I've shown it to. Kerry  Livgren's score is very good but the vocal cut at the end is mediocre.  (That's the reason for the 4 Star and not 5 rating.) But this is a  magnificent effort overall. I have nearly the entire series and know many  of the artists involved in making this. This is great stuff.

The surpris-ing thing, or one of the surprising things, is LIVGRIN's guitarplaying, which has never sounded better, especially his leadguitar playing. This is the most hard rock oriented album thatI've heard him do. Another surprising thing is how good thesesongs are. My favorite songs include the album's opening cut&quot;OCEANIC CELEBRATION&quot;; a very heavy progressive rocker witha very catchy guitar riff and some outstanding drumming andCREDENCE LENT and UTOPIAN DREAM. What's nice is that it doesn'tsound a bit like his work with KANSAS and it sure beats anythingthey've done since he left.
