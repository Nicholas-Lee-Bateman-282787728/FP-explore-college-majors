1003782,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000GG4Y3W,California Dreaming,"[0, 2]","I just saw Carlos Mencia last night (2013Feb9) in San Jose at a comedy club, a club to remain unnamed.  We wanted to check out the club for ourselves since we like comedy, and we've never been to that one before.  Suffice it to say, I will never return to the comedy club in San Jose, even though Anthony Jeselnik and Harland Williams are both on their schedule soon.  (I've seen Mr. Jeselnik in concert, and he is very funny.  The whole ""baby in the dryer"" routine almost made me cry.  I've seen Mr. Harland doing stand-up on Comedy Central, and his hillbilly schtick kills me.)  And after last night, I'll never return to a Mencia concert again either.Oh, don't get me wrong.  I still find some of Mr. Mencia's jokes funny, even though I believe that he needs to update his material for today's world.  And he was nice enough to sign a DVD for me -- this one, to be exact, which he also gave me since I was a VIP -- which I might even watch.  His biggest issue though:  I believe that he needs to rethink his opening acts.  And then perhaps 86 them, just like the waitresses wanted to do themselves at the comedy club last night.  (I watched one waitress walk by during one very offensive joke and she got really mad and shook her head.  In the hallway, I asked her, ""Isn't this supposed to be a comedy club?""  She smiled, wanted to curse, and just walked away.)Mr. Mencia had about three opening acts, and none of them were very funny, but all of them were fairly rude.  I kept thinking to myself, ""Self, if Jerry Seinfeld were here tonight, what would he say about this stuff?""  And not to put words in that very fine comedian's mouth, but I believe that he might say -- OK, so I almost KNOW exactly what he would say because he's said these words ad nauseum in interviews in the past -- ""If you can't tell a joke without swearing then I don't think that you're really a comedian.""  And this surely applied to almost all of the ""comedians"" last night; all they did was swear and they thought that it was funny.  Unfortunately, many of the very blue-collar crowd laughed with them, which seemed to egg on the comedians even more to swear some more.And I thought about something else last night, too.  One of the opening acts was black (that's all well and good by me; I'm a huge fan of Dave Chappelle and I wish that he'd come back to TV), but this guy kept using the N-word.  And yes, I almost cringe just writing or saying the joke-of-a-euphemism ""N-word,"" as I find it more offensive myself that the word that it replaces.  But anyways, I was thinking about Charles Barkley and his take on the use of this word.  After last night I am convinced that Mr. Barkley is wrong; no, make that completely wrong.  And I'm also convinced of the following:  either everyone should be able to use it, or no one should be able to use it.  Period.And my opinion on this is so strong now that I will make the following recommendation:  anyone who uses it in public gets a fine.  Yes, I am perhaps Freedom of Speech's biggest supporter, but I supposedly can't say this word, so no one else should be able to use it either.  And there are some groups that are losing their fight by continuing to use it, and you know who they are.  Perhaps you haven't lost yet, but it is inevitable that you will.So I say, ""Stop using the N-word in public -- either the real word of its replacement -- and that applies to everyone.  And I've got no strings attached to Carlos Mencia anymore either, especially after the mess-of-a-comedy show that I unfortunately witnessed last night.""  Adios, Carlos.",3,". . .
