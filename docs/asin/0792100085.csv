122060,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,0792100085,Allen Jackson,"[1, 1]","This review isn't a comment on the story or the acting, just on the quality of the new Blu Ray release. The BR has the most popular version of this film, the R-rated release.The BR picture quality is excellent, by far the best ever for this film.  Not as great a picture as some other blu rays of other 1977 films, but still an excellent picture--you won't be disappointed.  Terrific sound quality as well.  A fine blu ray experience will be had with this one!The extras, however, are poor-to-fair at best.  By far the best one ever, which provided the most information and showed, among other things, a piece on Travolta's dying girlfriend, Diana Hyland, and the 1977 L.A. premiere (with Travolta, other stars, even Yvonne Elliman arriving), was the VH-1 featurette, included on a previous DVD . . . but not on this blu ray.  VERY disappointing.  This seems a not-uncommon blu ray trend, whereby extras on previous DVD releases are removed for the (more expensive) blu ray.  Seems a rip-off to me, there's no other way I can see it.The other extras on this Blu Ray, listed by another reviewer, are decent yet sometimes dumb attempts at being interesting, but fall FAR short of the VH-1 featurette-- which I would have preferred being included on the blu ray even at the expense of losing ALL of the other extras.  MUCH more should have been done on the Bee Gees and how this film was meant to be a showcase for them, and how the soundtrack album was and IS the biggest-selling movie soundtrack in history, and how the songs from this film dominated the charts for over a year . . . all of which were in the (not included here) VH-1 featurette.I do recommend this blu ray, esp. at the great price Amazon sold it for recently of $6.99.  It's a great value for a blu ray of this iconic movie, and the fine, though not amazing, picture quality, alone is worth it.",4,"Blu Ray: excellent picture quality, lacks VH1 featurette",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1860,"['review', ""n't"", 'comment', 'story', 'acting', 'just', 'quality', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'BR', 'most', 'popular', 'version', 'film', 'R-rated', 'release.The', 'BR', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'far', 'best', 'ever', 'film', 'Not', 'great', 'picture', 'other', 'blu', 'rays', 'other', '1977', 'films', 'still', 'excellent', 'picture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Terrific', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'blu', 'ray', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'one', 'extras', 'however', 'are', 'poor-to-fair', 'best', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'ever', 'provided', 'most', 'information', 'showed', 'other', 'things', 'piece', 'Travolta', 'dying', 'girlfriend', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '1977', 'L.A.', 'premiere', 'Travolta', 'other', 'stars', 'even', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'arriving', 'was', 'VH-1', 'featurette', 'included', 'previous', 'DVD', 'not', 'blu', 'ray', 'VERY', 'disappointing', 'not-uncommon', 'blu', 'ray', 'trend', 'whereby', 'extras', 'previous', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'removed', 'more', 'expensive', 'blu', 'ray', 'rip-off', 'other', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'it.The', 'other', 'extras', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'listed', 'reviewer', 'are', 'decent', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'dumb', 'attempts', 'being', 'interesting', 'fall', 'FAR', 'short', 'VH-1', 'featurette', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'being', 'included', 'blu', 'ray', 'even', 'expense', 'losing', 'ALL', 'other', 'extras', 'MUCH', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'showcase', 'how', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'was', 'biggest-selling', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'history', 'how', 'songs', 'film', 'dominated', 'charts', 'year', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'VH-1', 'featurette.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'blu', 'ray', 'esp', 'great', 'price', 'Amazon', 'sold', 'recently', '6.99', 'great', 'value', 'blu', 'ray', 'iconic', 'movie', 'fine', 'not', 'amazing', 'picture', 'quality', 'alone']",N/A

I watched this on a plane ride from Australia to Hongkong, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Sure, the movie's a bit old, but it's not sugar-coated and unapologetic of Brooklyn in the 70s.  Even as early as back then, neighborhoods were fueled by the paradoxical dichotomy of family and gangs.Enter 19-year-old Tony Manero, a disco-god on the dance floor on Saturday nights.  He works at a paint store, hangs out with his gang of underachievers, and still lives with his parents.  When one of his friends gets beaten up, they take revenge on a rival gang without verifying the facts.  When Tony's brother decides to quit the priesthood, and their mother blames Tony he immediately lashes out at her saying ""There!  You happy?  Now you have two losers for sons.""  But family is family, and he sobbingly apologizes.  There's also the requisite love triangle between Tony, Annette and Stephanie.  Annette's love for Tony is unrequited.  Tony's crush on Stephanie is frustrated by the fact Stephanie wants to move up in the world, while Tony remains an unsophisticated boy destined to remain in his social caste.  What brings them together?  Dance.  Disco-dancing to be more precise.This film is probably what created the genre of dance movies like ""Strictly Ballroom"" and the Japanese ""Shall We Dance.""  In all these films, the dance floor becomes a world of its own.  A world far away and far different from the chaos that surrounds our protagonists' daily lives.  On the dance floor, there is no social ladder to climb, no enemies to beat up, no worries to weigh them down.  Yet at the same time, it isn't the real world.  And it only exists between 5 minute intervals of song.In the real world, people look up to Tony.  But Tony is too full of himself to take an occasional glance down.  Listening to Stephanie talk about important people at work, and what she's doing with her life has made Tony want to quantum leap out of his situation.  That doesn't happen, and it takes the death of a friend to finally snap him out of his youthful pride and rage of ""I'm better than all of you!""  So he slowly learns to start over and make himself better.Truly a gem of a movie.  I highly recommend this film.  If nothing else, you get to see what launched John Travolta's career.",4,"Stayin' alive, stayin' alive...",1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,2349,"['lot', 'people', 'call', 'movie', 'classic', 'period', 'piece', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'plane', 'ride', 'Australia', 'Hongkong', 'enjoyed', 'tremendously', 'Sure', 'movie', 'bit', 'old', 'not', 'sugar-coated', 'unapologetic', 'Brooklyn', '70s', 'Even', 'as', 'early', 'back', 'then', 'neighborhoods', 'were', 'fueled', 'paradoxical', 'dichotomy', 'family', 'gangs.Enter', '19-year-old', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'disco-god', 'dance', 'floor', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'paint', 'store', 'out', 'gang', 'underachievers', 'still', 'parents', 'When', 'one', 'friends', 'beaten', 'up', 'take', 'revenge', 'rival', 'gang', 'verifying', 'facts', 'When', 'Tony', 'brother', 'quit', 'priesthood', 'mother', 'Tony', 'immediately', 'out', 'saying', 'happy', 'Now', 'have', 'two', 'losers', 'sons', 'family', 'family', 'sobbingly', 'also', 'requisite', 'love', 'triangle', 'Tony', 'Annette', 'Stephanie', 'Annette', 'love', 'Tony', 'unrequited', 'Tony', 'crush', 'Stephanie', 'frustrated', 'fact', 'Stephanie', 'move', 'up', 'world', 'Tony', 'unsophisticated', 'boy', 'destined', 'remain', 'social', 'caste', 'What', 'together', 'Dance', 'Disco-dancing', 'be', 'more', 'precise.This', 'film', 'probably', 'what', 'created', 'genre', 'dance', 'movies', 'Strictly', 'Ballroom', 'Japanese', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'films', 'dance', 'floor', 'world', 'own', 'world', 'far', 'away', 'far', 'different', 'chaos', 'protagonists', 'daily', 'lives', 'dance', 'floor', 'social', 'ladder', 'climb', 'enemies', 'beat', 'up', 'worries', 'weigh', 'down', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'real', 'world', 'only', '5', 'minute', 'intervals', 'song.In', 'real', 'world', 'people', 'look', 'up', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'too', 'full', 'take', 'occasional', 'glance', 'down', 'Listening', 'Stephanie', 'talk', 'important', 'people', 'work', 'what', 'doing', 'life', 'made', 'Tony', 'want', 'quantum', 'leap', 'situation', ""n't"", 'happen', 'death', 'friend', 'finally', 'snap', 'youthful', 'pride', 'rage', ""'m"", 'better', 'slowly', 'start', 'make', 'better.Truly', 'gem', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'launched', 'John', 'Travolta', 'career']",N/A

The answer is a resounding YES!!Picture quality improved. Sound quality GREATLY IMPROVED, it's like going from a table radio to hi-end audio. If you are a die-hard SNF like myself, find someone with a wide-screen monitor and surround sound and have the time of your life!THE 3 DELETED SCENES--of course I won't spoil the suspense, only to say they are very short, averaging about 1 minute each (well, at least they SEEM that short) But they are interesting in how they tie into the story. Great discussion materialDIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY OVER FILM DIALOGUE--excellent, full of inside scoops and tidbits, guaranteed to please.Also includes VH-1 BEHIND THE MUSIC--this was broadcast before but certainly fits right in, you get to see the stars today. Sadly, the actors who played the mother, father and brother are not seen.In conclusion: ever since I first saw SNF in theatres, I have never felt the ""pulse"" of the movie in VHS format due to technical limitations.

122063,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0792100085,andy8047,"[4, 5]","John Travolta makes his starring film debut in this film as Tony Manero,a paint store sales associate who during the day is at the store and is at the real non-existent 2001 Odyssey discotheque and nightclub at night. Karen Lynn Gorney is Stephanie Mangano,a girl Tony meets at a dance studio. They'd later go to 2001 Odyssey together. Tony still lives with his mom,dad and his little sister in Brooklyn and in the last scene,announces to Stephanie his plan to move to Manhattan where she lives. Tony's buddies went with him to the nightclub also. Tony loses his job at the paint store after he takes a day off against his boss's authority. Tony is later reinstated. John Travolta was the star of TV's &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot; when he made this film. It wouldn't be long after wrapping up this film that he'd do his next starring film &quot;Grease&quot; with singer Olivia Newton-John. The soundtrack album is the biggest-selling in pop music history thanks in part to 5 songs on the album by the Bee Gees. Their composition IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU,was recorded by Yvonne Elliman. The Bee Gees would later record the song themselves. However,there are 2 versions of MORE THAN A WOMAN on the album,recorded by the Bee Gees and Tavares. Get a load of,in one of the first scenes,Travolta strutting while simultaneously eating two slices of pizza! The Matrix in Bay Ridge,Brooklyn now stands where 2001 Odyssey did. In addition to the Bee Gees,we hear great songs by K.C. and the Sunshine Band,Kool &amp; The Gang and even the Trampps' DISCO INFERNO(10 minutes and 52 seconds in length on the album). Director John Badham later directed Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn in BIRD ON A WIRE. There's also in the film,Donna Pescow as Annette,who was Tony's girlfriend before Stephanie and Martin Shakar as Tony's minister brother,who quit the priesthood and returned home.

122066,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792100085,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 6/04, 4/06, 11/07, 2/13Rate: 104/06: A correct review is written by one who describes Saturday Night Fever: ""John Travolta gives a sensual and intelligent performance as the troubled Tony Manero - Brooklyn paint store clerk by day and undisputed king of the dance floor by night."" Saturday Night Fever showcases the talents of John Travolta, who gives a performance of his lifetime. Perhaps Saturday Night Fever doesn't have a real story to tell, but I like to think it's all about the changing world that revolves around Tony Manero. John Travolta brings the real emotions through his faces, his actions, and his handling of the situations. One thing is for certain: Saturday Night Fever is the bringer of a short-lived Disco Revolution where Tony Manero finds himself enthralled by the success of his being in it, and that gives him a sense of power and royalty. Outside of it, he is just a common Italian who happens to be getting by with his life. Moreover, there is the everlasting impressive dancing of John Travolta, who has this one scene of very marvelous and exciting dancing that will soon be reminiscent when he does another vintage dancing in Pulp Fiction. Granted, John Travolta is a very, very talented actor who is able to draw energy onto him. When he does, all he does is create the momentum that enables the picture to be on a thrilling ride. I consider Saturday Night Fever to be one of the few greatest performances of his career, along with Urban Cowboy and Pulp Fiction. Saturday Night Fever is all about disillusionment of the youth while struggling to make a way out of life.11/07: I've thought about giving Saturday Night Fever a `10', but I think the film has some anchoring negative parts. No doubt, John Travolta gives his one of the very finest performances ever in his career in Saturday Night Fever, the other being Pulp Fiction. Everything about him oozes sensuality. The way he dances is electrifying. Saturday Night Fever is definitely the Rebel Without a Cause for the 70's. Saturday Night Fever is a rare film that captures the age of Disco Revolution. I feel, after repeated viewings, that Saturday Night Fever is a balanced picture because I see an honest portrayal of Tony Manero: a person with a family, a steady job, a somewhat healthy social life, and a high level of aspiration. Yet there is sensitivity in John Travolta's eyes that he doesn't believe in himself yet he pursues. There is the sadness because it makes me feel that I want to tell him that he is really something else and that he should always keep it together. His friends are interesting as they are the decaying part of Tony Manero's life...how does he get dragged down bit by bit due to their behavior. When Tony dances and gets away from it all, he finds something positive and gives him a great adrenaline. One wonderful scene, actually a sequence of scenes, occurs almost at the beginning of the film. When Tony Manero walks in 2001 Odyssey Club, he suddenly becomes the Disco King of Brooklyn, receiving ooh's and ahh's, stealing kisses from female strangers. That is the amazingly captured moment because Tony actually thrives by the shower of attention but seems to be pragmatic of it. Later, the girl, who is lovesick with Tony, goes to his table and offers to wipe the sweat off his forehead. This is the most fascinating part of the film because it is so trivially insignificant to others. But certain people actually yearn for this particular thing. It makes people feel like God, even if it's only for a second or two. On the other hand, when I think of what went wrong with the picture, I think of the weak acting from Karen Gorney. She disappoints me with her attempts to make her character to seem real. She does very nice job at times, especially with her dancing, but it's still a disappointing performance. Another one is the way the movie ended. It seems to have run out of gas, sputtering its way to the finish line, not actually having a strong resolve. I know the central theme of Saturday Night Fever is disillusionment. Somehow, I feel that should have been more strengthened. Each character is disillusioned, but I feel all of them is shown weakly in terms of disillusionment. I can see that in Annette; but I have more questions than answers. The same goes for Frank, Tony's priest brother. Bobby C., who gets accidentally killed at the end of the film, gives hints here and there, but do I understand his situation clearly? Not really. Overall, Saturday Night Fever is an energetic picture with a very nice cast and an out of the world performance from John Travolta yet seems to be weak in several ways.2/13: Saturday Night Fever finally gets a deserving `10' from me. It's an unforgettable iconic performance by John Travolta. It is truly a film that captures a forever gone time period and reflects disillusionment so well. The music by the Bee Gees, the dance sequences, and, most importantly, the people of different culture groups set up an ambiance of what the club in the middle of the Disco Era was like.

But having dismissed this movie when I first saw it, I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it have seen it on DVD years later. While the costumes, music, and decor are unquestionably dated (and tacky at times), the impact of the movie is not lost today.John Travolta is excellent as young Tony, a working-class kid from Brooklyn with the talen for disco dance, but not much ambition for anything else. He's a womanizer, a racist, and a simpleton in the ways of the world. That is until he meets a woman who challenges him, and partners with him to win a dance competition at the local disco. In between, we learn of his family problems, his hoodlum friends, and his other troubles he encounters (and no doubt causes). He lives for Saturday Night, where he is king of the dance floor. The dance scenes are exciting as ever, with Travolta giving 110% in his role. Evvery aspect of this movie fits.The Paramount DVD, while not exactly packed with extras, makes for a quality Special Edition. There is a 30 minute &quot;Highlight&quot; from VH1's Behind the Music, which is always fun to watch, but I would have loved to have the extra 30 minutes included (it's a 1 hour show). The deleted scenes fill in where they are needed, but the real gem is the Director's commentary, which gives valuable insight into the trails and successes that went into making this film. The transfer itself is nice, but is a bit grainy in parts, showing the limitations of the source print. But that is not a serious flaw. Anyone who loved &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; will no doubt be interested in this special edition.The relevant issues of wasted youth, violence, racism, and dysfunctional family life are all key to this movie, and should make it appealing to those who think of it as &quot;a campy disco flick&quot;. It is a great story with a killer soundtrack which is, while dated, still fun to watch and listen to.

(50s-Elvis) (60s -Rolling  Stones) (70s - Disco) (80s - hairbands). So, that in itself is a reason to get this movie. Being perfectly honest, I got this movie because the director (John Badham) happened to direct the best version of 'Dracula' ever. And in a dvd extra on his 'Dracula,' John Badham had made some comments about his previous 'Saturday Night Fever.' Well, that said, the scenery is nice without being overdone. (In the 70s and 80s, people didn't rely so much on special effects!) The story itself is somewhat disturbing. (Seeing how sad Travolta's life is, seeing the family disputes, not to mention the crisis in faith his brother is going through: 'Sometimes you look at a crucifix and just see a dead man on a cross.') But in all honesty, this is the point. Travolta's only relief is his dancing. One also needs a stomach for a lot of cursing, but in all honesty, 'Saturday Night Fever' is reflecting that kind of environment. But now, the best part of the movie. Even if the story is depressing and hard to take, it's all worth it to see the 70s styles, the disco music, and of course the dancing. If you have any affection for the 70s, this movie is an absolute MUST HAVE. If you like this, you may also wish to see John Badham's phenomenal 'Dracula' which was to come 2 years later. (Side Note: Ironically, Laurence Olivier is mentioned in this movie, and 2 years later he was to be in Badham's 'Dracula.') You may also wish to check out John Badham's 'Short Circuit.' FINAL NOTE: I wasn't sure I would like 'Saturday Night Fever,' but there really isn't a dull moment. Even if you're not into disco, give it a chance.",4,Great 70s History!

The music and dancing in the film are also incredibly well-done and the DVD presents the picture and sound quality quite well.  There are also a few extra features on the disc, the best one being the VH1 Behind the Music of the movie.  It offers a lot of behind-the-scenes info and interviews with the cast and crew.

I tried to write it in a style that he might write if he were to write it today, even though, naturally, this one won't be as good as any of his.)I've seen this film so many times over the years, I can probably recite half of the lines by heart by now.  And when I'm watching nowadays, I probably do out of habit.  ""Not the ha-ir!"" etc. etc.  And I still think that John Travolta should have won the Academy Award for his performance here; evidently, he lost out to Richard Dreyfus in ""Goodbye Girl,"" and while Mr. Dreyfus was very good in that film, I think that he got the nod only because of the genres of the films.  That always seems to be problematic to me.But over the years, I think about the Bee Gees even more.  Without the Bee Gees, you don't have ""Saturday Night Fever,"" or at least a good version of it.  But more importantly, I believe that there is only one remaining brother from that iconic group now:  Barry.  All of his brothers have seemed to die due to some tragic scenario, most that probably could have been avoided.  And it seems that every time that I've watched this film, there has always been one fewer Bee Gee.I can't think of too many movies that make the viewer think about an era more than this one.  Sure, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" makes me think of the 50s, even though I wasn't yet alive then.  But the era here, and disco itself, really are almost characters themselves, and the movie only works when considered within the framework of the time.  And it's surprising -- perhaps not to people who hate disco -- that the disco era only really lasted a few years.  It seemed that singer-songwriter music dominated before, while perhaps Heavy Metal dominated right after.But perhaps it's not surprising, if you consider that in general, Disco really wasn't very good from a musical perspective.  The Bee Gees were an exception, but Disco is really oversimplified music that was derivative from other genres -- such as funk -- and while you might be able to dance to it, it's not the kind of music that you can listen to all the time.With regards to the film, I really liked the juxtaposition of the Travolta character against his brother, who was a priest.  Both of the characters were still at the point in their lives when they were still trying to figure out who they were as people, and both were torn.  I think that this dynamic really worked.The one character that maybe doesn't work for me:  Karen Lynn Gorney.  It's not that her acting was poor; far from it.  I just think that it was perhaps a miscalculation to have her be such an unsympathetic character.  Whenever I watch, I always ask, ""What does Mr. Travolta's character really see in her?  She's obnoxious and not nearly as smart as she'd like to believe.  And she looks down on everybody.""  Her character does make you like Tony more perhaps, if you consider film to be a zero-sum game; if you like one character less you'll necessarily like another one more.  Perhaps that was the director's and screenwriter's motivation?Just like another film that released about the same time -- ""All the President's Men -- I can watch this movie at least every few years without getting tired of it.  And that would mean that I have the Fevah for this film, and I think that you should too.",4,I Got the Fevah!,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3322,"['review', 'remembrance', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'tried', 'write', 'style', 'might', 'write', 'were', 'write', 'today', 'even', 'naturally', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'can', 'probably', 'recite', 'half', 'lines', 'heart', 'now', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'nowadays', 'probably', 'do', 'out', 'habit', 'Not', 'ha-ir', 'etc', 'etc', 'still', 'think', 'John', 'Travolta', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'here', 'evidently', 'lost', 'out', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'Mr.', 'Dreyfus', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'think', 'got', 'nod', 'only', 'genres', 'films', 'always', 'be', 'problematic', 'me.But', 'years', 'think', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'even', 'more', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'least', 'good', 'version', 'more', 'importantly', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'remaining', 'brother', 'iconic', 'group', 'now', 'Barry', 'brothers', 'have', 'seemed', 'die', 'due', 'tragic', 'scenario', 'most', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'fewer', 'Bee', 'Gee.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'era', 'more', 'one', 'Sure', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'think', '50s', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'alive', 'then', 'era', 'here', 'disco', 'really', 'are', 'almost', 'characters', 'movie', 'only', 'when', 'considered', 'framework', 'time', 'surprising', 'perhaps', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'disco', 'disco', 'era', 'only', 'really', 'lasted', 'few', 'years', 'seemed', 'singer-songwriter', 'music', 'dominated', 'perhaps', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'dominated', 'right', 'after.But', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', 'consider', 'general', 'Disco', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'musical', 'perspective', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'were', 'exception', 'Disco', 'really', 'oversimplified', 'music', 'was', 'derivative', 'other', 'genres', 'such', 'funk', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'dance', 'not', 'kind', 'music', 'can', 'listen', 'time.With', 'regards', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'juxtaposition', 'Travolta', 'character', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'priest', 'characters', 'were', 'still', 'point', 'lives', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'were', 'people', 'were', 'torn', 'think', 'dynamic', 'really', 'worked.The', 'one', 'character', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'work', 'Karen', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'far', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'perhaps', 'miscalculation', 'have', 'be', 'such', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Whenever', 'watch', 'always', 'ask', 'What', 'Mr.', 'Travolta', 'character', 'really', 'see', 'obnoxious', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'smart', ""'d"", 'like', 'believe', 'down', 'everybody', 'character', 'make', 'Tony', 'more', 'perhaps', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'zero-sum', 'game', 'like', 'one', 'character', ""'ll"", 'necessarily', 'like', 'one', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'motivation', 'Just', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'President', 'Men', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'few', 'years', 'getting', 'tired', 'would', 'mean', 'have', 'Fevah', 'film', 'think', 'should', 'too']",N/A

122083,A1Z40ECAZHT60F,0792100085,Chi,"[2, 3]","Sure disco is out.But other dance take its place.Many Italians had moved out but it is still a working class neighborhood and I am sure many people can still relate to this movie.I used to live in that part of Brooklyn.Not exactly Bayridge but Bensonhurst nearby.It was and still is,to a lesser degree,an Italian working-class neighborhood.One of my good friends and neighbors, an Italian,came as an illegal alien until he married an American woman.He works in the construction business and every Tuesday he plays in his band to make the rest of his week bearable,not unlike Tony.This movie came out when I was ten.I could not see it but bought the vinyl album and memorized most of the songs.Lenny's pizza is STILL there.Almost everyday I walked down 86th Street and passed by Lenny's pizza as I lived 5 minutes from it without knowing its history in cinema.I never went inside because it looked sorta like a dump.The door barely fit my body.Don't get me wrong,I like Italian food and have been to most of the Italian joints nearby.One of them has a big Italian flag,taller than me,hoisted outside,waving in the wind.So you can imagine the shock I had when I saw Lenny's pizza in the opening when I caught the movie for the first time on TV and the regret I had not having eaten there now that I had left the neighborhood.Like Tony,I used to walk 10 minutes to Belt Parkway and look at Verrazano bridge from the same angle and get ""some ideas"".I was too old for Coney Island.It got me too excited anyway.Verrazano bridge had a soothing effect on me.Christianity is big in the neighborhood.There are statues of saints in people's front lawns.Once I looked outside the window at night and saw a procession of people led by a priest holding a candle that stretched at least two blocks.So I can appreciate the pride and then despair of Tony's mother at Tony's brother.It is not the cleanest neighborhood.It is a chaotic and gritty neighborhood.The building next to mine used to be a brothel.When police raided it,they found,surprise,fellow police among the customers.But it is dynamic like Tony's moves on dance floor and full of colorful characters.My neighbor,the owner of a music store,said he played with Elvis.He just passed away.God rest his soul.There are still a lot of Italian-Americans in that area.I had played soccer with them.Everyone was speaking Italian.I didn't understand a word.But they were nice to me.My friend would be driving but would follow a cute woman with his eyes with no regard to the traffic.Is it an Italian thing?He and his friends would put expresso in tiny tupperware in their pockets.Many teenagers would gather in group seating in doorways or standing in street corner,much like Tony and his gang.Tony likes to look at himself in the mirror and comb his hair whereas my room-mate would dress up as spider-man and take self-portraits and go to anime convention.Now many people of my heritage--Chinese--moved in as Italians moved out. But it remains the same if you substitute disco with karaoke.Every Saturday my landlord would hold party in the basement.He would play guitar,his brother bass and their friend drum.Some would sing.Some dance.Not disco but ballroom dance.That is how I met my Italian-American neighbors.In the commentary,the director remarked he is sure people still talk that kind of racist dialogue somewhere in Brooklyn.How true!I remember I couldn't give street direction to people in a car and got racial slur hurled at me.One day I saw stickers of white supremacist groups on many poles of bus-stops.While it is not lynching,it is still disturbing.I later read about Yusef Hawkins and what happened to some Mexican laborers.Till now,there isn't any African-American in the neighborhood.Luckily for me the people I met,be they Italians or Latinos or any other ethnic groups are friendly and tolerant.Maybe being of Chinese heritage is lucky and have it better.Remember one of the posters on Tony's wall is Bruce Lee.Tony's pals wanted to see his new movie.They are more disparaging to other ethnic groups such as Latinos and African-Americans.Thirty years went by,as cliche as it seems,when it comes to racism,there is progress but there is still room to improve.I wonder,even today, how many would give up their trophies and money like Tony in the dance contest.In heavy Brooklyn accent,Stephanie proudly proclaimed,""I'm out of this Bayridge scene...It ain't Manhattan.It isn't Manhattan...Right across the river,people are beautiful.Offices are beautiful.Lunch hours are beautiful."" Yeah,right.I guess I am half-way between Tony and Stephanie.Many of my neighbors rarely go to ""the city"".Like Stephanie,I would regale my neighbors with tales of celebrities I met in Manhattan and even show them the autographs I got. Looking back,I was so vain.A unique feature about New York subway is that the lights occasionally go off for a few seconds.(I wonder if anyone loses his/her wallet.)I used to take W and then D train to Manhattan,it took about 40 minutes,there was nothing to do and I usually dozed off until it reached Manhattan and I would wake up automatically.So it was very poignant for me at the end of the movie when Tony took the subway to Manhattan.The lights went off a few seconds and he dozed off.The music was weird and atonal symbolizing his state of mind.And then the lights came back on,he opened his eyes to the angelic music of ""How deep is your love"" as the subway entered Manhattan.The first date we see Tony and Stephanie through a restaurant window whereas in the last scene we see them with a big window behind.There is something profoundly symbolic here.I am not sure what it is.Maybe it shows how they had overcome their differences and become closer together.The movie is about moving up the social ladder and overcoming social barrier which is still relevant today.Stephanie personifies Manhattan.Its sophistication is skin-deep.A veneer.It is not all that it claims to be.It is smart of the director to end the movie with a freeze frame of Tony, personification of provincial Brooklyn, and Stephanie in a tentative embrace,leaving the audience to imagine what happens afterward.How will Tony's career turn out?Will he make it in Manhattan or eaten up by the tough city?Is Manhattan as good as he thought it to be?Will they get married?These are up to each viewer's imagination.(I haven't watched Stayin Alive)I,for one, briefly encountered my Stephanie/Manhattan and parted way.Not being able to make it in Manhattan,I left US altogether.Brooklyn,the ground zero of many immigrant journeys,its sight and sound,its color and character still lingers on in me.Like Tony,I am about to cross the threshold to a new world where I can be all that I can be.Donna Pescow looks like Giulietta Masina and lends Fellini qualities to the movie.""Everybody is dumping on everybody.""said Tony.This movie is about attempts to reach for something out of one's league.Like Annette's feelings towards Tony or Tony's towards Stephanie.Also,it is like Stephanie chasing her dream in an idealized Manhattan.And that kid who knocked up his girlfriend and tried hard to conform to ""traditions"" and felt obliged to marry her.The conflict inside him probably contributed to his death.As to which edition is better,25th anniversary or 30th,it is a toss up.I have watched both but own the latter.It is wrapped in a cute miniature white disco suit of Tony! Some reviewers are big on deleted scenes(which are included only in 25th edition).These 2 minutes clips are deleted for a reason and IMO should stay deleted.They don't give any new perspective to the movie.The VH1 documentary in the 25th edition and the 30 year legacy documentary in the 30th edition both have their pros and cons.One is not better than the other.The best bonus feature and the most valuable insight into the film is the director's commentary,which is included in both editions.You are all set with just this special feature.30th anniversary edition has more special features such as revisiting Bayridge and Bee Gees interview.So it has a slight edge.But they are all good.Just read Nik Cohn's story on which the movie is based.The script writer had made a lot of changes and the final product is at least 80% his creation.Vincent of the short story,a cold,callous and James Deanish guy, becomes Tony in the movie,with more human touch and more likable. Donna,withdrawn,masochistic and quite creepy,becomes Annette,more normal and just infatuated with someone.Norman Wexler created some brilliant dialogues,what real people would say.""Do you have a fxxxing stairway to the stars or something?"".Just brilliant.Nik Cohn based his story on British teenagers and it is interesting to see that British and American and,I would dare say,every culture's kids are pretty much the same.",5,Not that much has changed since 30 years ago,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,8803,"['Sure', 'disco', 'out.But', 'other', 'dance', 'take', 'place.Many', 'Italians',

122086,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0792100085,Cubist,"[3, 5]","A lot of criticism has been leveled against this new edition that it doesn't carry over all of the ones from the previous, 25th Anniversary Edition, and that the extras on this new aren't up to snuff. I have to respectively disagree. First up, Badham's commentary track has been carried over. The three measely deleted scenes have not. They were from the sanitized TV version and I didn't really miss 'em all that much. I will agree that the omission of the VH1 special is really unfortunate as it was very well made and contained lots of info (plus, the tribute to Gene Siskel was a nice touch), however, it wasn't even the full-length version of this special!As for the new extras? The real centerpiece is an almost hour-long retrospective documentary called ""Catching the Fever"" that is broken down into five featurettes that you can watch separately or altogether. The grittiness of the script is briefly discussed. The film's memorable soundtrack and its importance to not just the film but pop culture are also examined. The Bee Gees (back for brand new interviews) talk about the genesis of the soundtrack and how it affected their careers. The film's distinctive and dated polyester clothing is also explored, taking us back to the fashions of the 1970s and how authentically it was represented. The disco phenomenon, its origins, appeal and legacy is covered as is the rise in popularity and influence of disc jockeys. Cast and crew pay tribute to Travolta and his performance in the film.

122089,A2F3YSK8KHH25N,0792100085,Dan J. Almeida Jr.,"[0, 1]","Saturday Night Fever, was the movie that started a national dance craze, and music movement that lasted until the early eighties. It also caused a fashion craze, where people would actually dress flashy, sophisticated and stylish, if a bit over the top, with all the polyester. It is the story of one Tony Manero, a 19 year old Brooklynite in '77, who worked as a paint salesman by day, and on the weekends, was the King of the 2001 Odessy, the local NY hotspot, where you only went if you were ""in"", hip, and happening. Out on the streets of Brooklyn, he was a mere nobody, but when he hit the nightclub scene, ""The crowd would part like the Red Sea, for he and his posse, the ""Faces"". And when he hit the dance floor, it was absolute, magic. Manero's moves were choreographed by none other than Danny Terio(?) of ""Dance Fever"". The women were all about sex, and one night stands were the order of the night in the pre-AIDS late 70's era. Look fast,and you'll see Fran Drescher try to pick up on Tony....but alas, he has eyes only for sexy Stephanie Mangano, because, in Tony's own words, ""She can move...she's got the wrong dance partner of course, but she can move.""....but eventually, his rough around the edges charm wins Stephanie as well, but he is a product of the rough streets, and she is a sophisticated socialite from Manhattan, too old for Tony, but the world stops when they hit the dance floor. A very interesting sidestory involves Tony's ex-priest brother, and little Joey, who cant seem to ever get things right. The plot centers around Tony's growing up, his complex relationship with his idiot friends, and Stephanie, and around the big Dance Contest, that he must win to show his dominance of Brooklyn's dance floors. But he has other lessons to learn along the way, about life. Of this movie I can only say one thing....I deeply regret not being in my twenties, and not living in NYC during the fabulous 70's, when people knew how to dress,dance, and play and the music (The Bee-Gees, Chic, Heatwave, Ohio Players, ect, ect.) completley blew away much of the asinine crap played at the clubs today.

My circle of friends were rockers and we had no time for this fodder for the blow-dried polyester wearing disco boys.  Needless to say this film holds up infinitely better than ""The Song Remains the Same"" or ""Pink Floyd at Pompeii"".  Now that I am free to view this film for what it is and my opinions are not determined by adolescent tribal loyalties I can say this is a real good film.  Though this film was a phenomenon, it portrays a gritty working-class milieu not unlike a world portrayed in a Scorsese film.  John Travolta is nothing less than dynamic as Tony Manero, the Brooklyn kid who wants to escape the stifling environment of his neighborhood.  I am speaking of both his acting and his dancing which is an expression of his desire to break free.  Good performances are also delivered by Karen Lynn Gorney as Stephanie, the receptionist who has already crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to the promised land of Manhattan.  Donna Pescow is particularly good as Annette, the good girl who will turn bad just so she can obtain Tony's affections.  On a note of trivia, Pescow starred in a short-lived sitcom,""Angie"" with Robert Hays of ""Airplane"" fame about a waitress from Philly who marries a rich guy.  Pescow kind of disappeared after that which is a shame.  To the film's detriment, Tony's family is kind of a cliched Italian-American unit, not unlike an ""R"" rated ""Marty"" clan.  And Tony's buddies are the worst kind of stupid. The soundtrack, predominated by original Bee Gees songs, is superb.

Also, a film that would catapult actor John Travolta (previously known for his role on the TV series ""Welcome Back, Kotter"") into one of the top actors of all time.The film was based on a New York Magazine article from 1977 titled ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"" written by Nik Cohn (who admitted fabricating the whole story after twenty years later) and was written by Norman Wexler and directed by John Badham (""War Games"", ""Short Circuit"", ""Blue Thunder"").Featuring classic disco music by the Bee Gees (the soundtrack is recognized as the top selling movie soundtrack of all time) and popular disco tracks of that time, the film helped popularize the disco movement.VIDEO & AUDIO:""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" looks incredible on Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition and I compared the video quality of the original DVD and perhaps it was the upconverting but the DVD looks terrible compared to the Blu-ray.In the famous opening sequence as the film pans around New York and then we see John Travolta as Tony Manero walking with swagger with a can of paint while looking at the women, on the DVD the picture quality was slightly dark but watching the Blu-ray, it's brighter, sharper, more colorful.  I was comparing the picture quality and it was like night and day.  ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"", for a film that is over 30-years-old, just looks incredible in high definition.And the music, which is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (also, featured in French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish Mono) is just crystal clear.  I was very impressed with the audio quality as the disco music just comes out alive on your home theater setup.  Dialogue is well-heard but when the music comes on (which is frequent), the music and hearing it on high definition was quite awesome.  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film, so you will get more through the front channel and low frequencies on your subwoofer.The film also comes with English subtitles inc. English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:In the 25th Anniversary of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"", there was the commentary, VH1 special featurette and the deleted scenes.  For the 30th Anniversary, we get all new special features to celebrate the 30th Anniversary.  It's important to note that John Travolota is the main cast member who did not take part in the 30th Anniversary interviews.  Included are:* Commentary by John Badham - This is the same commentary used on the 25th Anniversary disc.  John Badham commenting on the filming of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" and the difficulties they faced due to the fans of John Travolta who were everywhere the camera crews were at.  Very good insight on the whole film.* Catching the Fever - This is where you can find a good bulk of featurettes such as:- A 30-Year Legacy - (15:23) An interview with Director John Badham, Producers and cast of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" sans John Travolta.  The group talking about working on the film, how iconic the film became as it inspired disco, fashion and much more.- Making Soundtrack History - (12:37) An interview with the Bee Gees and more in regards to how the film used the music as a form of promotional by having the soundtrack released first and eventually creating hype around the film.  Also, interesting information of how the Bee Gees felt their careers were over because they were a 60's band and how the film gave them a new life.- Platforms & Polyester - (10:35) Polyester was very big then and quite inexpensive.  But those who wore polyester were in and also how the film made a certain brand of shoes quite a fad back in the late 70's.- Deejays & Discos - (10:17) Interviews with DJ's and people of the time talking about how things were back during the day at disco clubs and how celebrities were often DJ'ing and more.- Spotlight on Travolta - (3:35) Interviews with cast and big names from the 70's in regards to working with John Travolta.  The theme was the same with each talent, Travolta was courteous, friendly and never put himself higher than anyone on the set.  Everyone loved working with him.* Back to Bay Ridge - (9:00) Actor Joseph Cali who plays the character of Joey visits the various locations from the film in New York and shows how things have or haven't changed since 1977.* Dance Like Travolta with John Cassese - (9:48) John ""The Dance Doctor"" Cassese teaches the viewer how Tony and Stephanie dance their popular competition dance.* Fever Challenge! - (4:00) Learning some of the complicated dance moves from ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER""* Deleted Scenes - (3:36)  It's important to note that there were two films available for the public.  A rated ""R"" version and a ""PG"" version which would attract a young audience (note: There was no PG-13 at the time).  The deleted scenes were used in the PG version of the film and the more sexual and profane scenes were toned down.  Included is a deleted scene which shows Tony's father getting his job back, Tony going to Stephanie's home to apologize and more.JUDGMENT CALL:It was great to have 30th Anniversary features for this Blu-ray but for those who own the 25th Anniversary DVD edition, you may not want to give away the DVD just yet.  The original DVD contained a VH1 special feature that shows more of the emotional and somewhat darker side behind-the-scenes of the film in which Travolta's real life girlfriend was dying of breast cancer and how it took a toll on him during the filming of ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"" and also other things discussed on that 30-minute featurette.I would imagine that the featurette was not included on the Blu-ray because of rights or the fact that everyone on the VH1 special no longer look the same as they do on the 30th Anniversary featurettes and wanting to keep things consistent.My parents were hardcore into disco when I was a child.  I was taken to watch ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" at the theaters twice, my parents put the vinyl of the soundtrack and the Bee Gees playing quite often during those years and remember all these people coming over for disco parties.Suffice to say that ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was an iconic film of that time period.  Sure, there are music videos and shows that I could think of that popularized disco but this film did more than that.  It is now ingrained into pop culture for the music, the dancing, the polyester, the platform shoes and the hair.I think there is a misconception among people that ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" is like ""GREASE"" (a film made in 1978, a year after SNF).  This is not a musical, the film is about teenagers living in New York and one knowing he has potential to do something bigger.  His family life sucks, his friends constantly get into trouble and don't share the same passion in dancing as he does and he's tired of living his life of being a dancer at a club and wants to get serious with his life.The film shows major repercussions to the characters at the end and the things you see on this film, especially its racial tone probably would not be acceptable today.  This film is about youth and a people wanting more in their lives (unfortunately, its sequel ""Staying Alive"" directed by Sylvester Stallone was not as great despite it being a financial success).John Travolta does an absolutely great job as Tony Manero.  It's one thing to learning the various choreography for the film but there are certain mannerisms that you can't help but laugh.  In one scene, his father hits him in the back in the head after he mouths off to his mother.  Tony makes a comment of how he has been working so long on his hair and his father hits it.  Another scene, where Stephanie and Tony go out and eat and Tony with no manners talks with food in his mouth.  But to find out that a lot of these scenes were improvised by Travolta was shocking.As James Dean made ""Rebel Without a Cause"" a youth film for its time and both he and the film became iconic for that time, John Travolta and the cast knew that this was his vehicle to shine and Travolta succeeded.And the other talents made this film feel real, such as his gang of friends to even Donna Pescow as Annette, having to gain weight and regain her New York accent for this role.  Karen Lynn Gorney having to learn all the dance moves along with Travolta was convincingly real as a woman not wanting to be bad but wanting to be better.John Badham did a great job in capturing the urban life and the youth during the late 1970's and although his name would be branded with ""War Games"", ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was a film that many people would forever remember as one, if not his best directorial work ever.And the music especially for those who did grow up around disco knows the impact of the soundtrack of the film.  The soundtrack for ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was the first music soundtrack to utilize a double album and also released before the film to create hype and eventually becoming the largest selling soundtrack ever is a great accomplishment.And last, the 30th Anniversary Blu-ray is just fantastic.  Again, comparing the DVD picture quality and the Blu-ray quality is like night and day.  The Blu-ray blows away the 25th Anniversary out of the water.  I'm just impressed with both picture and audio quality and how well the transfer is in High Definition.Again, for those who own the 25th Anniversary, may want to keep it for the VH1 Special Feature which has a deeper behind-the-scenes of what happened on set during the filming but overall, the new featurettes created for the 30th Anniversary in combination with HD video and audio makes this 1977 classic a disc worth owning for film buffs and those who are nostalgic of that time period.""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Over 30 years old and the presentation is absolutely magnificent!

I found it hard to identify with the friend who was forced to marry or die given it was the late 70's, maybe he was so annoying we were relieved at his jump and then felt so guilty about our own ignorance of friend's issues, who knows...

""Lords of Flatbush"" also sprung to mind..this could've been one of their kids 20 years later.Getting past the music, this is a downbeat film about people who live their boring lives to rule the night, some people who don't want to move on, others who want to get the hell out of there.The people are portrayed as average joes, unsophisticated,the language is shocking by PC standards, sexual and vulgar. Travolta's Tony kind of reminds me of Tony from ""West Side Story"", someone who is a reluctant leader, only because they're the smartest out of the group. When he's on the dance floor, he is in his element.I think that the people who hated disco at this time and the parodies that followed didn't give this film a chance, and the cut version really neutered it, but watching it uncut, it's a working class love story without turning into a chick flick.They made a sequel but it was more over the top than gritty.

122106,A3B25R48M37T01,0792100085,Edward J. Baker,"[2, 3]","Here is a film that achieved greatness in popularity, but could have been an indisputably great film with better direction and plausibility. There is inherent potential for a great story when dealing with a young man struggling to find meaning in life by overcoming the low expectations bred by environment and dysfunctional family life. But it becomes almost disconcertingly anti-climatic to place this character, who becomes a more sympathetic figure throughout the film, in situations where he reverts to some pretty shameful behavior near the end, just prior to a final epiphany. Thanks only to the touching performances of John Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney, the final scene provides a redeeming grace.Tony Manero (Travolta) works at a dead end job in a paint store, takes joyrides with friends to act out an aimless bravado walking the cables on the nearby bridge, and lives for weekends when he can impress his friends at the neighborhood disco with his considerable gift for dancing. One night he spots a beautiful and talented Stephanie Mangano (Gorney) whom he sees as a potential dance partner for an upcoming contest. After meeting her again at a rehearsal studio and after some teasing banter, he convinces her to join him for coffee. Stephanie is enamored with her job working at a Manhattan talent agency, and although she is more than a little pretentious, which drives Tony crazy, he starts to develop a hidden admiration for her wanting to live a better life.Tony is also developing a gradual disgust with the manner in which most everyone takes out their despair by ""dumping on each other,"" particularly as sexual predators, and this reflects a lot of the movie's unevenness. Staging this message in such a heavy handed sexual environment causes it to almost get lost. Throughout the film there is hardly a moment when a female character demonstrates any offense at torrentially constant sexual suggestiveness. Even barroom conversations between men and women are staged at a topless bar. Add to this Tony's inconsistencies. He is as vulgar as his less determined friends and not consistently solicitous towards the emotional and self-esteem problems of an insecure friend, Bobby, who's trying to deal with a pregnant girlfriend. Tony and Stephanie are intended as sympathetic but the film has Tony ignoring promises to call the stressed out Bobby and has Stephanie deliver a viciously insulting remark to him.When they're allowed to display warmth, the film excels. Tony is not able to get a day off to help Stephanie move some of her things from her old Brooklyn residence, so he quits rather than leave her hanging. After driving to her Manhattan apartment, they run into a male ex-roommate she expected to be out of town but who is now completing his move out. In a brief exchange with him, Stephanie endures a condescending criticism of her speech and then a particularly phony criticism about having read the wrong book rather than the one that trendy intellectuals are suppose to have read. Her embarrassment before Tony is palpable.Back in the car after Tony challenges her to explain her interest in the man, she admits to having had a relationship and having helped him hide some of his assets from his divorcing wife. She tries at first to feign a casual, adult indifference about what the dissolved relationship means, but because she's beginning to trust the honest albeit blunt concern by Tony, she allows herself to surrender some of her denials of her having been used as her disguise of confident sophistication starts to collapse, and she breaks down, displaying a scared and vulnerable sweetness. Ms. Gorney gives as moving a display of sorrow as ever captured on film, very tearful but not hysterical or contrived. As he comforts her, Tony is beginning to learn how to be a friend to a woman and learning to actually like his more sensitive and decent side. Travolta even allowed his eyes to moisten for the scene.In a sub-plot Tony's family is devastated by his brother's decision to leave the priesthood, who pontificates about the phoniness of the Church. Billions of words have been written by saintly scholars articulating this creed, but Hollywood seldomly passes up an opportunity to depict Catholicism as anything more than a cult for neurotics where the only good Catholic is an ex-Catholic. Also way out of place in this film, is a scene where Tony and his buddies get into a gang fight where, in B movie fashion, lethal weapons fly around but no one gets seriously hurt.Nearing the film's climax, Tony is still struggling to cultivate his decent side, which includes surrendering the ill-gained first prize in the dance contest to a more talented Puerto Rican couple. Yet a few minutes later he acts out his frustrations on Stephanie with a near rape, then takes another joy-ride with friends back to the bridge, is revolted by but does nothing to stop a two man gang rape occurring in the back seat during the trip, but castigates the girl for her promiscuous affectations when it's over. At the same time, in an attempt to finally prove his manhood with a risky climb on the bridge's cabling, Bobby finally gets everyone's attention, too late, as he loses his grip and plunges to his death. Witnessing the quasi-suicide and rape provokes a night of subway riding soul-searching for Tony culminating in a morning visit to Stephanie's apartment. Reluctantly, she lets him in, and Tony bears a vulnerable soul in wanting to start leading a more honest and decent life. It is a tribute to the acknowledged acting of Travolta and the equally touching performance of Gorney that they carry off a very tender scene, expressing a mutual respect and a commitment to be kind and supportive to each other. This is a good film that should have been great. Travolta achieved enormous acclaim, and Ms.Gorney should have had much better subsequent career offers than she did.",4,Brilliant performances rescue uneven direction,1048204800,"03 21,

Chuck that video tape, make a clock out of that old laserdisc.This widescreen transfer looks great.  Shadow detail is good, overall detail is good for a 70s movie (you can almost count all the hairs on Travolta's body in the bedroom prepping scenes) and the soft focus scenes, many with floor fog, come across just like I remember from the movie at the theater.  And the sound has been given special treatment...music is spread throughout all 5.1 channels and really sounds great.  Ambient surrounds (mostly outdoor traffic) sound very realistic.  Only the dialogue comes across as strained at times.  Plus the Brooklyn accents can be hard to follow.Great performances aside (and Travolta has never been better) this is a wonderful slice of movie history.

Gorgeous video remastering without a blemish in sight and colors spot-on with a new 5.1 remixing of the original audio soundtrack. Concerning the movie itself, if you took all the dated clothes, dance styles, and music out of it, there really is a great coming-of-age/hard luck story in here that to me seemed timeless. I watched it with this version's new ""70's Discopedia [aka subtitle trivia track]"" and found it entertaining and very informative on facts of the era. This new version keeps the director commentary from the last DVD version, but now adds a new 56 minute documentary featuring most of it's actors (no Travolta, strange for him) today, including the Bee Gees and even Troma Horror producer favorite Lloyd Kaufman (who I had no idea was the film's location scout). But this already full DVD had two more related extras, a too-long ""teach you to dance"" with instructors and an animated version that replaces the ""VH1 Special"" and the 4 minutes of deleted scenes that the earlier release had. To lose those deleted scenes for that animated one was really stupid and not worth it, but whatcha gonna do. Also, the packaging is a tad odd, with a plastic slipcover surrounding a half-digipak of sorts that doesn't hold it in place very well, sliding out the second you hold it upright, but looking groovy nonetheless. Watching this today, I found it hard to believe I was actually alive during this time-period (be it in single-digits), but instantly it took me back to those days when my parents dressed me in those god-awful shirts and polyester slacks.

122115,ARB2PT295H3TN,0792100085,"Gert Marincowitz ""DVD buff""","[0, 0]","Saturday Night Fever (1977), about disco dancer Tony Manero (John Travolta) was released in the wake of the Oscar glory of another film portraying an Italian-American blue collar guy trying to transcend his ""bum"" status, namely Rocky (1976).  On Manero's room walls, we even see a movie poster of Rocky depicting the famous final scene where Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Adrian (Talia Shire) embraces after the climactic championship bout.In the documentary we learn that John G. Avildsen who received a Best Director Oscar for Rocky was originally slated to direct Saturday Night Fever (SNF) and we see John Travolta practising his dance step on ""Avildsen home movies"".  However, producer Robert Stigwood fired Avildsen due to differences of artistic interpretation.  Scriptwriter Norman Wexler received Oscar nominations for Joe (1970, directed by Avildsen) and Serpico (1973), both films portraying the gritty, depressing realism of 1970s New York.  In fact on Manero's room wall we also see a movie poster of Al Pacino in his title role in Serpico! Wexler's script for SNF likewise had, beneath the glamour of the disco era, a tragedy about a strong anti-hero on the road to selfdestruction.  Before the feel-good movie Rocky, Avildsen himself became known for movies with anti-heroes and downbeat endings such as Joe and Save the Tiger (1973).  In fact, Rocky to some extent reflected the pessimism of the 1970s in its depiction of Rocky's depressing environment.But Avildsen began to love the heroic nature of leading characters such as Rocky and found the depiction of Manero in Wexler's script too negative.  Travolta disagreed and finally producer Robert Stigwood fired Avildsen and hired John Badham to direct.  In a Stallone biography, we learn that Stigwood informed Avildsen of his Oscar nomination for Rocky at the same time that he fired him as SNF director.  Later on, Avildsen would direct Karate Kid (1984), which could be regarded as the ""Rocky of the 1980s"", thus rejecting the 1970s introspection and pessimism of his early 1970s youth.In the SNF documentary, we also learn that the hedonistic disco era of the mid- to late-1970s reflected in SNF developed in reaction against the serious politics and pessimism of the anti-war protest movement of the 1960s.  Thus, a kind of prelude to the empty hedonism and narcissism of the 1980s.  And we see it most clearly reflected in the first half of the 1980s - the era of Stallone and the Hollywood sequel.  Fresh from the commercial success of Rocky III (1982), Stallone was asked by Travolta to direct the sequel to SNF, namely Staying Alive (1983).  The divergence between the introspective 1970s and optimistic 1980s is most clearly reflected in the difference between SNF and Staying Alive.  Avildsen was fired as director of SNF.  But by the early 1980s his protege Stallone was hired as director (and co-writer with Wexler) of Staying Alive.",4,Brillinat documentary is highlight of DVD package,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,2916,"['Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', '1977', 'about', 'disco', 'dancer', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'released', 'wake', 'Oscar', 'glory', 'film', 'portraying', 'Italian-American', 'blue', 'collar', 'guy', 'trying', 'transcend', 'bum', 'status', 'namely', 'Rocky', '1976', 'Manero', 'room', 'walls', 'even', 'see', 'movie', 'poster', 'Rocky', 'depicting', 'famous', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Rocky', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'climactic', 'championship', 'bout.In', 'documentary', 'learn', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'who', 'received', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Rocky', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'direct', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'SNF', 'see', 'John', 'Travolta', 'practising', 'dance', 'step', 'Avildsen', 'home', 'movies', 'However', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'fired', 'Avildsen', 'due', 'differences', 'artistic', 'interpretation', 'Scriptwriter', 'Norman', 'Wexler', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Joe', '1970', 'directed', 'Avildsen', 'Serpico', '1973', 'films', 'portraying', 'gritty', 'depressing', 'realism', '1970s', 'New', 'York', 'fact', 'Manero', 'room', 'wall', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'poster', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'title', 'role', 'Serpico', 'Wexler', 'script', 'SNF', 'likewise', 'had', 'glamour', 'disco', 'era', 'tragedy', 'strong', 'anti-hero', 'road', 'selfdestruction', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'Avildsen', 'became', 'known', 'movies', 'anti-heroes', 'downbeat', 'endings', 'such', 'Joe', 'Save', 'Tiger', '1973', 'fact', 'Rocky', 'extent', 'reflected', 'pessimism', '1970s', 'depiction', 'Rocky', 'depressing', 'environment.But', 'Avildsen', 'began', 'love', 'heroic', 'nature', 'leading', 'characters', 'such', 'Rocky', 'found', 'depiction', 'Manero', 'Wexler', 'script', 'too', 'negative', 'Travolta', 'disagreed', 'finally', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'fired', 'Avildsen', 'hired', 'John', 'Badham', 'direct', 'Stallone', 'biography', 'learn', 'Stigwood', 'informed', 'Avildsen', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Rocky', 'same', 'time', 'fired', 'SNF', 'director', 'Later', 'Avildsen', 'would', 'direct', 'Karate', 'Kid', '1984', 'could', 'be', 'regarded', 'Rocky', '1980s', 'thus', 'rejecting', '1970s', 'introspection', 'pessimism', 'early', '1970s', 'SNF', 'documentary', 'also', 'learn', 'hedonistic', 'disco', 'era', 'mid-', 'late-1970s', 'reflected', 'SNF', 'developed', 'reaction', 'serious', 'politics', 'pessimism', 'anti-war', 'protest', 'movement', '1960s', 'Thus', 'kind', 'prelude', 'empty', 'hedonism', 'narcissism', '1980s', 'see', 'most', 'clearly', 'reflected', 'first', 'half', '1980s', 'era', 'Stallone', 'Hollywood', 'sequel', 'Fresh', 'commercial', 'success', 'Rocky', 'III', '1982', 'Stallone', 'was', 'asked', 'Travolta', 'direct', 'sequel', 'SNF', 'namely', 'Staying', 'Alive', '1983', 'divergence', 'introspective', '1970s', 'optimistic', '1980s', 'most', 'clearly', 'reflected', 'difference', 'SNF', 'Staying', 'Alive', 'Avildsen', 'was', 'fired', 'director', 'SNF', 'early', '1980s', 'protege', 'Stallone', 'was', 'hired', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Wexler', 'Staying', 'Alive']",N/A

122119,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,0792100085,guillermoj,"[4, 5]","The year was 1977 (26 years ago) and I remember having mom my take a group of us to see this movie because we were way too young to get in as we were in our very early teens. I remember loving this movie and feeling like I was watching something special. At said time I mostly enjoyed the great music, outstanding dance sequences, and a virtuoso performance by one of the Sweathogs from ""Welcome Back Kotter"".Having watched it several times since (just saw it again last night), I realize that this movie not only reflected a dance/music craze, but at the core is a thoughtful character study at both micro and macro levels. It is truly reflective of the best of the tradition of movies of the 1970's like ""Alice Does Not Live Here Anymore"" as it's mostly character and not plot driven, unlike most of today's releases.All the characters feel so true to life, mostly due to excellent writing and superb acting, that you can feel like you are one of them or at least sitting next to them. The movie also touches on so many issues in the most naturalistic way. No neat ""Lifetime"" movie touches to be found, and although you don't feel beaten over the head with it, the movie touches on racism, economic disparity, the role of women in the family and in the whole madonna/whore context, religion, and homophobia just to name a few.Lest you think that this movie will feel like a John Cassavettes movie (who I also enjoy most of the movie) this movie tackles its themes in one of the most entertaining ways ever filmed without the sometimes self-indulgent touches of some other favorites of mine.The dance sequences are masterful as are those involving family and friends, and director John Badham has not made a better movie. The acting is flawless, especially the Oscar-nominated performance by John Travolta. He never takes a false step in the entire movie. He's sexy, confident about what's on the outside, scared to death about where his life is going, and manages to say so much with his eyes and posture. And the man can dance as there is a sequence without the MTV cuts to shows true dancing rather than images that pass for dancing by today's standards.All of the supporting characters (even those with a single line) are outstanding, especially Donna Pescow and ""Tony's"" entire family. The only minor quibble that I have with the movie (with does not take away from this 5-Star Review) is Karen Gorney's performance. In a movie with such strong performances all around, she hits all the right notes in most of her scenes, but there are a couple of scenes where she is the weak link. By no means do I think that it is a weak performance, but when there is such talent all around, you tend to notice all that is not perfect.To me this is one of the better movies ever to come out of Hollywood and after seeing it you may agree with me. Without giving too much of it away, the movie does not lead to where you think it's leading to and what would be the big finish today only serves as the beginning for the character's arc. Also, although I saw this movie when I was 12/13, this is a without a doubt movie for adults as it is frank and raw, and I would only recommend that it be seen by mature teens and beyond.In an era of test groups, sequelitis, and competing entertaining alternatives you are not likely to see a movie as entertaining and thoughtful as this one so buy/rent it, and I think that you'll be sure to love it.",5,They don't make them like this anymore....,1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,3429,"['year', 'was', '1977', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'having', 'mom', 'take', 'group', 'see', 'movie', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'get', 'were', 'very', 'early', 'teens', 'remember', 'loving', 'movie', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'special', 'said', 'time', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'music', 'outstanding', 'dance', 'sequences', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'one', 'Sweathogs', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', '.Having', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'just', 'saw', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'realize', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'reflected', 'dance/music', 'craze', 'core', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'study', 'micro', 'macro', 'levels', 'truly', 'reflective', 'best', 'tradition', 'movies', '1970', 'Alice', 'Does', 'Not', 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'mostly', 'character', 'not', 'plot', 'driven', 'most', 'today', 'releases.All', 'characters', 'feel', 'so', 'true', 'life', 'mostly', 'due', 'excellent', 'writing', 'superb', 'acting', 'can', 'feel', 'are', 'one', 'least', 'sitting', 'next', 'movie', 'also', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'most', 'naturalistic', 'way', 'neat', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'touches', 'be', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'beaten', 'head', 'movie', 'touches', 'racism', 'economic', 'disparity', 'role', 'women', 'family', 'whole', 'madonna/whore', 'context', 'religion', 'homophobia', 'just', 'name', 'few.Lest', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'feel', 'John', 'Cassavettes', 'movie', 'who', 'also', 'enjoy', 'most', 'movie', 'movie', 'themes', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'ever', 'filmed', 'sometimes', 'self-indulgent', 'touches', 'other', 'favorites', 'mine.The', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'masterful', 'are', 'involving', 'family', 'friends', 'director', 'John', 'Badham', 'not', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'acting', 'flawless', 'especially', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'John', 'Travolta', 'never', 'false', 'step', 'entire', 'movie', 'sexy', 'confident', 'what', 'outside', 'scared', 'death', 'where', 'life', 'going', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'eyes', 'posture', 'man', 'can', 'dance', 'sequence', 'MTV', 'cuts', 'shows', 'true', 'dancing', 'rather', 'images', 'pass', 'dancing', 'today', 'standards.All', 'supporting', 'characters', 'even', 'single', 'line', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'Tony', 'entire', 'family', 'only', 'minor', 'quibble', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'away', '5-Star', 'Review', 'Karen', 'Gorney', 'performance', 'movie', 'such', 'strong', 'performances', 'around', 'right', 'notes', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'weak', 'link', 'means', 'do', 'think', 'weak', 'performance', 'when', 'such', 'talent', 'around', 'tend', 'notice', 'not', 'perfect.To', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'ever', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'seeing', 'may', 'agree', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'movie', 'not', 'lead', 'where', 'think', 'leading', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'finish', 'today', 'only', 'beginning', 'character', 'arc', 'Also', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '12/13', 'doubt', 'movie', 'adults', 'frank', 'raw', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'be', 'seen', 'mature', 'teens', 'beyond.In', 'era', 'test', 'groups', 'sequelitis', 'competing', 'entertaining', 'alternatives', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'see', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'one', 'so', 'buy/rent', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'love']",N/A

122124,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,0792100085,Irfan A. Alvi,"[2, 3]","When you watch this movie three decades after its release, you realize that some movies indeed have something special which enables them become classics which alter the shape of popular culture for more than a generation, rather than merely disappearing quietly into the crowd like countless other movies.The main theme, which will probably always be relevant for many Americans, is struggling to move beyond a crappy working-class background in order to live a better life.  Of course, not everyone in such circumstances will have this urge, but there will always be a few who sense that they're meant for higher things, even if that means breaking their ties with their familiar world.  The lead character of Tony, embodied superbly by John Travolta, exemplifies just such a person.Tony's setting is the hedonistic culture of 1970s Brooklyn, which is portrayed without pulling any punches.  The level of crassness and vulgarity may shock you in many ways, particularly if (like me) you're not quite old enough to have seen this subculture firsthand.  To illustrate the world Tony lives in, consider what a drag his social influences are: his family and friends are uneducated; his father is an unemployed construction worker; his brother becomes a priest, but then quits because he only did it for his parents in the first place; his friends use drugs, exploit women, and are quick to pick a fight with other ethnic groups; he works in a paint store and his boss would like to hold him there indefinitely at the lowest pay he can get away with; and, to top it off, one of his friends dies by falling off a bridge, winding up there largely because he couldn't cope with having a pregnant girlfriend.  Of course it could always get worse, but this is plenty bad.  However, there's one distinct positive in Tony's life: he meets a girl who's has some exposure to a better life, and this in turn plants a vital seed in him ...Tony's most prominent talent and passion is dancing, and we're indeed treated to plenty of iconic disco dancing (fun to watch, even if you don't care for this genre).  And let's also not forget the equally iconic soundtrack by the Bee Gees, full of uniquely great songs which have become just as classic as the movie.  But the movie appropriately ends by showing that Tony realizes that dancing isn't necessarily his ticket to a better life, so he may need to dig deeper in order to forge a more realistic path.  And we finish the movie with a hopeful feeling, because Tony seems committed to doing just that.Summing up, again, this movie is deservedly a classic which was an important event in American (pop) cultural history, so I not only recommend it, but I would say that watching it is an important part of everyone's cultural education.  And if, like me, you know young people in circumstances not entirely unlike Tony's, this movie may be especially poignant for you.",5,Deservedly a classic,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2899,"['When', 'watch', 'movie', 'three', 'decades', 'release', 'realize', 'movies', 'indeed', 'have', 'something', 'special', 'become', 'classics', 'alter', 'shape', 'popular', 'culture', 'more', 'generation', 'rather', 'merely', 'disappearing', 'quietly', 'crowd', 'countless', 'other', 'movies.The', 'main', 'theme', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'relevant', 'many', 'Americans', 'struggling', 'move', 'crappy', 'working-class', 'background', 'order', 'live', 'better', 'life', 'course', 'not', 'everyone', 'such', 'circumstances', 'will', 'have', 'urge', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'few', 'who', 'sense', ""'re"", 'meant', 'higher', 'things', 'even', 'breaking', 'ties', 'familiar', 'world', 'lead', 'character', 'Tony', 'embodied', 'superbly', 'John', 'Travolta', 'just', 'such', 'person.Tony', 'setting', 'hedonistic', 'culture', '1970s', 'Brooklyn', 'portrayed', 'pulling', 'punches', 'level', 'crassness', 'vulgarity', 'may', 'shock', 'many', 'ways', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'subculture', 'firsthand', 'illustrate', 'world', 'Tony', 'consider', 'what', 'drag', 'social', 'influences', 'are', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'uneducated', 'father', 'unemployed', 'construction', 'worker', 'brother', 'priest', 'then', 'only', 'did', 'parents', 'first', 'place', 'friends', 'use', 'drugs', 'exploit', 'women', 'are', 'quick', 'pick', 'fight', 'other', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'paint', 'store', 'boss', 'would', 'like', 'hold', 'there', 'indefinitely', 'lowest', 'pay', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'top', 'off', 'one', 'friends', 'dies', 'falling', 'off', 'bridge', 'winding', 'up', 'there', 'largely', 'could', ""n't"", 'cope', 'having', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'course', 'could', 'always', 'get', 'worse', 'plenty', 'bad', 'However', 'one', 'distinct', 'positive', 'Tony', 'life', 'girl', 'who', 'exposure', 'better', 'life', 'turn', 'plants', 'vital', 'seed', 'Tony', 'most', 'prominent', 'talent', 'passion', 'dancing', ""'re"", 'indeed', 'treated', 'plenty', 'iconic', 'disco', 'dancing', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'genre', 'let', ""'s"", 'also', 'not', 'forget', 'equally', 'iconic', 'soundtrack', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'full', 'uniquely', 'great', 'songs', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'as', 'classic', 'movie', 'movie', 'appropriately', 'showing', 'Tony', 'dancing', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'ticket', 'better', 'life', 'may', 'need', 'dig', 'deeper', 'order', 'forge', 'more', 'realistic', 'path', 'finish', 'movie', 'hopeful', 'feeling', 'Tony', 'committed', 'doing', 'just', 'that.Summing', 'up', 'again', 'movie', 'deservedly', 'classic', 'was', 'important', 'event', 'American', 'pop', 'cultural', 'history', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'recommend', 'would', 'say', 'watching', 'important', 'part', 'everyone', 'cultural', 'education', 'know', 'young', 'people', 'circumstances', 'not', 'entirely', 'Tony', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'especially', 'poignant']",N/A

Other movies have drawn bigger crowds, sold more, and made more money, but no other movie has ever effected any where near as great of a change on society's behavior as did ""Saturday Night Fever.""""Saturday Night Fever"" is not a clean movie.  They produced (at the same time) a PG version ... which also gives us some additional footage ... but that ""laundered up"" version lacks the punch of the R rated version.  This violence, profanity, references to sex, and glimpses of sex are very much the everyday occurences of the street life this movie strives to depict, and the movie makers succeed in bringing this life to the screen in a realistic and believable way.John Travolta plays Tony Manero ... a true life character ... and the movie follows his life (in Brooklyn, NY) over a period of about two weeks.  He is a young man devoted to disco dancing, and in his world of violence, ignorance, and greed, this dancing gives him an anchor of sorts to which he can cling.  In these sinful surroundings, Tony also tries to maintain a sort of code of decency and truth, but he is the only one on this team, and it is always an uphill battle.  By contrast, Tony's older brother Frank is in the priesthood ... supposedly a bastion of decency ... but decides, in the course of the movie, to leave the church.Tony works a dead-end job at a hardware store and hangs out with his gang of friends in his off time.  He lives at home with his italian family (father, mother, sister, and grandmother), but really lives at the disco he and his friends go to every Saturday night.  While at the disco one night he spots a new girl, Stephanie (played by Karen Lynn Gorney), and he engineers a meeting.  The two of them agree to partner for an upcoming dance contest, and, throughout the course of their practicing, a mutual affection develops.  In Tony, Stephanie finds a person she can at last trust, and in Stephanie, Tony finds someone who not only has dancing talents on a par with his own, but, in her, he also sees a doorway of sorts out of the world he is increasingly coming to detest.  The ending of ""Saturday Night Fever"" is tender and delicate.  The movie itself is a roller coaster ride of arguing, violence, and indecency, but the ending is soft and sweet.The heart of ""Saturday Night Fever"" is the dancing ... particularly Tony's dancing ... and it (the dancing) is a delight to watch.  When Tony and Stephanie begin to dance together, it is as if something right is happening for the first time.  The music, provided primarilly by The Bee Gees, is perfect ... giving us upbeat and fun rhythms ... as we imagine ourselves dancing right along with the characters on the screen.The acting in ""Saturday Night Fever"" is top-notch throughout ... usually an indication of a good director (in this case John Badham) ... with an emphasis on, not classic good acting, but on realistic portrayals of everyday New York City (Brooklyn borough) people.  Travolta is at his best here, I think.  Karen Lynn Gorney does a good job as Stephanie ... but, at 31, was perhaps too old for the part.  In the performances of Joseph Cali and Paul Pope (as Tony's friends Joey and Double J) we are given two characters that we simply know really exist.  Barry Miller is excellent as Tony's friend Bobby C (in a tricky and non-flattering part to perform).  Val Bisoglio is excellent (and a little unsettling) as Tony's ignorant father, Julie Bovasso is very good as Tony's mother, and Lisa Peluso does a nice little job as Tony's sister.  Sam Coppola is very believable as Tony's boss, and Donna Pescow was well chosen for the part of Annette (Tony's former partner) and she carries it out well.  The smaller parts in this movie are all filled out with quality and realistic performances that add a great deal of authenticity to the film.But ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a classic cultural film, and is worthy of a look.",5,Realistic and Fun Dancing Movie,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,3969,"['movie', 'ever', 'had', 'greater', 'impact', 'society', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Other', 'movies', 'have', 'drawn', 'bigger', 'crowds', 'sold', 'more', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'other', 'movie', 'ever', 'effected', 'where', 'near', 'great', 'change', 'society', 'behavior', 'did', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'not', 'clean', 'movie', 'produced', 'same', 'time', 'PG', 'version', 'also', 'additional', 'footage', 'laundered', 'up', 'version', 'punch', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'violence', 'profanity', 'references', 'sex', 'glimpses', 'sex', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'everyday', 'occurences', 'street', 'life', 'movie', 'depict', 'movie', 'makers', 'succeed', 'bringing', 'life', 'screen', 'realistic', 'believable', 'way.John', 'Travolta', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'true', 'life', 'character', 'movie', 'life', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', 'period', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'young', 'man', 'devoted', 'disco', 'dancing', 'world', 'violence', 'ignorance', 'greed', 'dancing', 'anchor', 'sorts', 'can', 'cling', 'sinful', 'surroundings', 'Tony', 'also', 'maintain', 'sort', 'code', 'decency', 'truth', 'only', 'one', 'team', 'always', 'uphill', 'battle', 'contrast', 'Tony', 'older', 'brother', 'Frank', 'priesthood', 'supposedly', 'bastion', 'decency', 'decides', 'course', 'movie', 'leave', 'church.Tony', 'dead-end', 'job', 'hardware', 'store', 'hangs', 'out', 'gang', 'friends', 'off', 'time', 'home', 'italian', 'family', 'father', 'mother', 'sister', 'grandmother', 'really', 'disco', 'friends', 'go', 'Saturday', 'night', 'disco', 'one', 'night', 'new', 'girl', 'Stephanie', 'played', 'Karen', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'meeting', 'two', 'agree', 'partner', 'upcoming', 'dance', 'contest', 'course', 'practicing', 'mutual', 'affection', 'develops', 'Tony', 'Stephanie', 'person', 'can', 'last', 'trust', 'Stephanie', 'Tony', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'dancing', 'talents', 'par', 'own', 'also', 'doorway', 'sorts', 'world', 'increasingly', 'coming', 'detest', 'ending', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'tender', 'delicate', 'movie', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'arguing', 'violence', 'indecency', 'ending', 'soft', 'sweet.The', 'heart', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'dancing', 'particularly', 'Tony', 'dancing', 'dancing', 'delight', 'watch', 'When', 'Tony', 'Stephanie', 'begin', 'dance', 'together', 'something', 'right', 'happening', 'first', 'time', 'music', 'provided', 'primarilly', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'perfect', 'giving', 'upbeat', 'fun', 'rhythms', 'imagine', 'dancing', 'right', 'along', 'characters', 'screen.The', 'acting', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'top-notch', 'usually', 'indication', 'good', 'director', 'case', 'John', 'Badham', 'emphasis', 'not', 'classic', 'good', 'acting', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'everyday', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Brooklyn', 'borough', 'people', 'Travolta', 'best', 'here', 'think', 'Karen', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'good', 'job', 'Stephanie', '31', 'was', 'perhaps', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'performances', 'Joseph', 'Cali', 'Paul', 'Pope', 'Tony', 'friends', 'Joey', 'Double', 'J', 'are', 'given', 'two', 'characters', 'simply', 'know', 'really', 'exist', 'Barry', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'Tony', 'friend', 'Bobby', 'C', 'tricky', 'non-flattering', 'part', 'perform', 'Val', 'Bisoglio', 'excellent', 'little', 'unsettling', 'Tony', 'ignorant', 'father', 'Julie', 'Bovasso', 'very', 'good', 'Tony', 'mother', 'Lisa', 'Peluso', 'nice', 'little', 'job', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Sam', 'Coppola', 'very', 'believable', 'Tony', 'boss', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'part', 'Annette', 'Tony', 'former', 'partner', 'out', 'well', 'smaller', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'filled', 'out', 'quality', 'realistic', 'performances', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'authenticity', 'film.But', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'classic', 'cultural', 'film', 'worthy', 'look']",N/A

Michael Click,"[51, 56]","Unfairly dismissed by many viewers today as a relic of the disco era, ""Saturday Night Fever"" should more properly be remembered as the classic coming-of-age tale in which John Travolta exploded onto the big screen.  The actor's character, Tony Manero, is a nineteen-year-old Italian-American still living with his family in Brooklyn who is stuck in a dead-end job and hanging around with a group of old friends who (like himself) have no real hopes or ambitions for the future.  Manero's only true talent - and his escape from the world around him - is his prowess on the dance floor.  It's a tricky role - the outwardly racist, sexist, homophobic, immature Manero is not the most sympathetic of characters - but Travolta imbues him with a aura of underlying decency and vulnerability that causes the audience to identify with him and ultimately, cheer for him.  It's truly a knockout performance ... one that deservedly netted Travolta an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and won him the top male acting award from the National Board of Review.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD offers home viewers a great video and sound transfer.  A VH-1 ""Behind the Music"" documentary offers an interesting look at the troubled production history of the film, as well as some interesting insights into the movie's impact on popular culture.  Regrettably, the disc does not include the Original Theatrical Trailer; I found myself curious to see how the distributor (Paramount) promoted this film to theatregoers.

Against the backdrop of a low Brooklyn neighborhood, Tony goes out dancing every weekend, his only defense against a life of stifling mediocrity.  Travolta gives a bravura performance, imbuing Tony at once with sleek Italian machismo and a tender vulnerability at times.  There are many storylines, unrequited love for and by Tony with his prior and current dance partners respectively and Tony's interactions with his parents, fallen priest brother, and friends.  The music you will get or you will not get, the Bee Gees are singularly represented and tower over the film, there are some other great period pieces to be seen as well.

First off the Bee Gees sountrack is superp, come on, when you hear a tune today how can you not think, white suit and a big ole shiny disco ball. Don't critisize the Bee Gees, they have more songs and collaborations in top 40 music then the Beatles. From the opening, the famous strut, the music, Travolta in the black polyester bellbottom stretch pants.....captures the era. You would be surprised how many clowns dressed like him after this film, too bad they couldn't dance or get a identity. Basic story, young man struggling in the world, works at a paintshop, pretty much a no-body in the working industry. But look out. When night comes, he dresses to kill, and kill he does on the dancefloor. He is a legend at the nightclub. Everyone knows him, they all part like the red sea during his entrance, and women just want a piece of him. It doesn't matter that he lives with his parents and is going nowhere, the night belongs to Travolta. This film shows a very realistic lifestyle of a young man growing up in a lower class home with amazing talents. His main dance solo is mesmerising, talented, and forever spoofed by many a Bee Gee fan in nightclubs worldwide. This film has substance and character, all around a classic era film. The late Gene Siskel has prononced many of times that this is his favorite film, possibly a dream to fill Tony's shoes for one evening. He actually was high bidder on the famous white suit...........possibly closed his curtains, blasted the Bee Gees, and did his own impersonation, who cares, everyone has pretended to be someone else at one time. Siskel is missed, but purchase this film and get the leisure suit out, a fun time indeed. Some trivia, Fran Drescher, is the girl Travolta blows off and does his famous dance. Also Adriene King, lead character in ""Friday the 13th"" is a back up dancer in the line dances. Travoltas sister is the one that gives him the slice of pizza at the beginning.

122143,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0792100085,"John ""MovieAddict""","[2, 5]","I love this movie.I love the way it focuses on dancing, yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes, long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor, but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle: Trying to escape from your boring daily routine, even if it is just for an hour.That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store, then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint, where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking clich&eacute;. In a sad sort of way, it's true.But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin: ""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime."" ""Saturday Night Fever"" is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way, Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.""Saturday Night Fever's"" theme tune, ""Staying Alive"" (the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel), speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. ""I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me, I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me yeah"" chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now, I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song, and for good reason.I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But ""Saturday Night Fever"" makes me feel as if I had--and that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon, and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. (In the Travolta film ""Get Shorty,"" a criminal threatens a producer by saying that, if he doesn't pay up, he'll be ""dead as disco."" Ironic.)Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero, a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fame--as brief as it may be--and the most obvious theme of the film, which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey, a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantly-waxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that, he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.Part of this movie is learning to grow up, and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plots--the other is, of course, trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background, and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son, who became a priest, and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son, and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from $3 to $4, his father tells him that $4 can't even buy $3. His son swears at him and storms away.Some of my favorite scenes in ""Saturday Night Fever"" are the human ones, such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror, bare-chested, and combs his hair forever, looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" scene in ""Taxi Driver,"" released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from ""Serpico"" and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. (Just think, Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo, yet he was, in a way, in the first film, too.)I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family. He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work, but after working for quite some time on his now-out-of-date hairstyle, he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner (in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh). He yells at him: ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" I know that scene has been quoted before, but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard.In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie, and certainly one of the most touching, Tony has lunch with an older girl (who later becomes his dance partner) and tries to impress her by acting mature. But his immaturity shines through--he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time, and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower. In a way, this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were.This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbers--I love them, and I probably shouldn't. As for the right reasons...I think we already know what they are. It's all about dreams. Everyone has some. Whether it's dancing or whatever, we all have dreams. And that's why I think ""Saturday Night Fever"" relates to so many different people on so many different levels.",5,"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night...waitta minute!",1074038400,"01 14,

Released at the pinnacle of disco fever, John Badham's Saturday Night Fever is a nostalgic look at the late 70s, with John Travolta as Tony Manero, the main man at the discotech, where he shows off his dancing moves to the BeeGees songs. It's entertaining to sit back and watch a film that was once considered the ""groovy"" thing, and now is seen for what it actually is, a so-so film with excellent dancing moves, but then again, most musicals do the old ""make a musical and attach a hackneyed plot of sorts and see if it gels."" Thankfully, it does better than the shocking ""Stayin' Alive"". It's no easy watch, with sex scenes, nudity and violence not quite fitting together. Director Badham (file name under ""where are they now?"") gives too much attention to the outside world of drugs, sex and suicide, when it would work much more fluidly without the jarring tone changes. It's a curious throwback to the days of disco-groove, and John Travolta is effortlessly cool, but when you take out the disco, it's a combination of sleaze and violence that's hardly cohesive. But the classic BeeGees music and some great dancing from Travolta push it further than what the film itself deserves.",3,Saturady Night Fever!,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,1278,"['Well', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'John', 'Travolta', 'walks', 'woman', 'man', 'time', 'talk', 'Released', 'pinnacle', 'disco', 'fever', 'John', 'Badham', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'late', '70s', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'main', 'man', 'discotech', 'where', 'dancing', 'moves', 'BeeGees', 'songs', 'entertaining', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'once', 'considered', 'groovy', 'thing', 'now', 'seen', 'what', 'actually', 'so-so', 'film', 'excellent', 'dancing', 'moves', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'musicals', 'do', 'old', 'make', 'musical', 'attach', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'sorts', 'see', 'Thankfully', 'better', 'shocking', 'Stayin', 'Alive', 'easy', 'watch', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'violence', 'not', 'quite', 'fitting', 'together', 'Director', 'Badham', 'file', 'name', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'outside', 'world', 'drugs', 'sex', 'suicide', 'when', 'would', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'fluidly', 'jarring', 'tone', 'changes', 'curious', 'throwback', 'days', 'disco-groove', 'John', 'Travolta', 'effortlessly', 'cool', 'when', 'take', 'out', 'disco', 'combination', 'sleaze', 'violence', 'hardly', 'cohesive', 'classic', 'BeeGees', 'music', 'great', 'dancing', 'Travolta', 'push', 'further', 'what', 'film']",N/A

122154,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,0792100085,L.A. Scene,"[6, 7]","Many people are familiar that when it comes to the late film critic, Gene Siskel - he considers the movie ""Saturday Night Fever"" to be one of the great movies of all time.  This is a case where I couldn't agree with him more.  This is truly a landmark movie - and a movie that comes across only a few times during a century.  Unfortunately, because ""Saturday Night Fever"" fell at the height of the Disco era, it gets an unfair rap because it is often associated with Disco music.  When Disco fell out of favor with the public in the 1980s, so did this movie.  When Disco rebounded in the 1990s, so did the appreciation for this movie.  I've never wavered in my feelings for this movie - but I feel (like Siskel) that there was so much more this movie had to offer than just music and dancing.  While there clearly is an association with the Disco era, there is also a very good story that is attached to this movie.  The story is combined with some very good acting.  Travolta might pull off some legendary dance moves, but he received an Academy Award Nomination for a reason - he delivers the performance of a lifetime as Tony Manero.  Every time I watch this movie, I'm completely glued to the screen and my interest never wavers.The story of the movie is this.  Tony Manero is a 19-year old Italian American growing up in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.  He is living with his parents, younger sister, and grandmother.  No matter what Tony does, he can never seem to satisfy his parents.  Much of this has to due to the fact that Tony's older brother, Frank Jr. is a priest who is held in high esteem by the Maneros.  In Bay Ridge, Tony is incredibly popular and is adored by many around him.  He works in a local Paint Store and is also very popular with the customers.  Tony also runs with some friends who often find themselves in illicit activities.  On the weekends, he loves to go with these friends to ""2001 Odyssey"" - a local Brooklyn Disco.  In the Disco, he also finds the adoration he fails to find at home - he is the Disco King and held in high regard by everyone.  Tony seems content with his life - but that changes when he meets Stephanie Mongano (played by Karen-Lynn Gorney) at 2001 Odyssey.  Tony is attracted to Stephanie and in order to get close to her, he asks Stephanie to be his partner in a dance contest at 2001 Odyssey.  This is at the expense of his original dance partner Annette (played by Donna Pescow) who adores Tony.  While women usually fall over Tony, Stephanie presents a real challenge to Tony.  Stephanie had Bay Ridge roots, but moved to Manhattan.  She is someone who has left the ""Bay Ridge Scene"" and is now in a much-more sophisticated world than Tony.  Despite their differences, Tony develops an adoration for Stephanie.  At the same time, Tony begins to re-examine, his lifestyle, the crowd he hangs around in, and his own goals.  Things reach an emotional and tragic climax the night of the dance contest - and Tony, his friends, and Stephanie's lives will never be the same.The music in this movie is incredible.  Producer Robert Stigwood and Director John Badham do a great job at marrying the right music to each and every scene.  While I'm not a dance fan, I must admit I was blown away by Travolta's dance scenes.  Travolta's big dance solo comes at the middle of the movie to ""You Should Be Dancing"".  While Travolta delivers what might be the greatest dance solo in motion picture history, it is also worth noting that this is a pivotal scene in the movie.  It is after this scene that things begin to unwind and unravel in Tony's life.  Prior to moving into this dance solo, Fran Drescher (in her early screen days) has a small part as Connie.  During the dance solo, Drescher's presence remains on the screen and she is a couple of steps further out from the crowd than anyone else.Nik Cohn wrote the screenplay for this movie.  Cohn really explores a variety of topics that were a part of the culture during this time.  Probably the main topic that is explored is discrimination.  This is seen a couple of times in the movie: 1) Tony and his friends go after a Hispanic gang that they believe hurt their friend;  2) The crowd at 2001 boos the Hispanic Couple competing against Tony and Stephanie at the Dance Contest.  As Tony begins to re-examine his lifestyle, we see Tony's own views on discrimination change.The movie also features some other subplots that take place.  The three most notable are: 1) Tony's Brother Frank, Jr. has left the priesthood - much to the chagrin of his family;  2) Tony's friend Bobby C (Barry Miller)  has gotten his young girlfriend pregnant.  Bobby is being torn apart emotionally and looking to Tony for support;  3) Annette is a woman who is in love with Tony - and seeking to marry the right man and start a family.There are some other great sub-characters in this movie in addition to Frank Jr, Bobby C and Annette.  These all contribute to subculture that this movie explores:  Joey (Joseph Cali) plays Tony's friend and ""right hand"" man;  ""Double J"" (Paul Pape) is Tony's temperamental  friend;  ""Monti"" (Monti Rock III) is the DJ at 2001 Odyssey;  Flo Manero (Julie Bovasso) plays Tony's Mother; Frank Manero Sr. (Val Bisoglio) delivers a nice performance as Tony's father; and Pete (played by Bert Michaels) is the owner of a local Dance Studio.All in all, this is a legendary movie.  Even if the music played a more secondary role, this would still be one of the great movies of all-time.  This is a must see movie.",5,Disco or Not - this is a Landmark Movie,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,5524,"['Many', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'when', 'late', 'film', 'critic', 'Gene', 'Siskel',

Sherwin,"[7, 7]","Saturday Night Fever remains a classic movie over time because so many people appreciate the nostalgia of the disco era; and many more can easily identify with Tony Manero, the main character in the film. Tony's life is already going nowhere fast at the ripe old age of 19; and the only time when he truly feels important is when he's dancing at the local disco dance floor.Tony (John Travolta), a kid from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, works in a small paint shop while he still lives with his parents. His only real happiness comes on Saturday nights when he and his buddies go to a local disco called 2001 Odyssey. Although Tony can be racist and foul mouthed, I came to like his character rather quickly, most likely because of Travolta's excellent acting. When there's a major dance contest at the disco, Tony initially partners up with Annette (Donna Pescow) to try to win first prize--but Tony's attention is quickly drawn to another slightly older woman, Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Eventually Tony dumps Annette to enter the dance contest with Stephanie.Of course, there's a budding romance between Tony and Stephanie, however clumsy that relationship can be at times. Look also for some excellent scenes in which Tony hangs out with his buddies including Bobby C., Joey and Double J. (Barry Miller, Joseph Cali and Paul Pape, respectively).The soundtrack to the film is forever famous; the music by the Gibb brothers helps the movie along without ever taking center stage. A fine accomplishment that is in and of itself! The dancing scenes reflect great talent and choreography; and the cinematography works wonders in the opening shots of Tony walking down the street in Brooklyn.The DVD comes with a few extras; we get a commentary by the director and we also get the VH1 Behind The Music episode about Saturday Night Fever. I especially liked the way they tell people about how they made the film--it wasn't easy. There are three deleted scenes as well.There's also a strong caution to parents: this is not a Disney movie! There are many swear words and nasty words for Hispanics and African-Americans. There are some scenes related to drugs as well.Overall, Saturday Night Fever is the gritty little film that did good. The movie's characters are people with whom many people can identify with; we were either the kids who hung out at the club or we wanted to be the kids who hung out at the club. The dancing and soundtrack are nothing short of excellent; and the convincing acting gets five stars in my book any day.Great job, everyone!",5,a fine disco musical,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,2554,"['Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'classic', 'movie', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'appreciate', 'nostalgia', 'disco', 'era', 'many', 'more', 'can', 'easily', 'identify', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Tony', 'life', 'already', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '19', 'only', 'time', 'when', 'truly', 'feels', 'important', 'when', 'dancing', 'local', 'disco', 'dance', 'floor.Tony', 'John', 'Travolta', 'kid', 'Bay', 'Ridge', 'Brooklyn', 'small', 'paint', 'shop', 'still', 'parents', 'only', 'real', 'happiness', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'when', 'buddies', 'go', 'local', 'disco', 'called', '2001', 'Odyssey', 'Tony', 'can', 'be', 'racist', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'came', 'like', 'character', 'rather', 'quickly', 'most', 'likely', 'Travolta', 'excellent', 'acting', 'When', 'major', 'dance', 'contest', 'disco', 'Tony', 'initially', 'partners', 'up', 'Annette', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'try', 'win', 'first', 'prize', 'Tony', 'attention', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'slightly', 'older', 'woman', 'Stephanie', 'Mangano', 'Karen', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'Eventually', 'Tony', 'dumps', 'Annette', 'enter', 'dance', 'contest', 'Stephanie.Of', 'course', 'budding', 'romance', 'Tony', 'Stephanie', 'however', 'clumsy', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'Look', 'also', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'Tony', 'out', 'buddies', 'including', 'Bobby', 'C.', 'Joey', 'Double', 'J', 'Barry', 'Miller', 'Joseph', 'Cali', 'Paul', 'Pape', 'respectively', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'forever', 'famous', 'music', 'Gibb', 'brothers', 'movie', 'ever', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'fine', 'accomplishment', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'reflect', 'great', 'talent', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'wonders', 'opening', 'shots', 'Tony', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'Brooklyn.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'get', 'commentary', 'director', 'also', 'get', 'VH1', 'Music', 'episode', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'tell', 'people', 'how', 'made', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'well.There', 'also', 'strong', 'caution', 'parents', 'not', 'Disney', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'swear', 'words', 'nasty', 'words', 'Hispanics', 'African-Americans', 'are', 'scenes', 'related', 'drugs', 'well.Overall', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'gritty', 'little', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'whom', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'were', 'kids', 'who', 'hung', 'out', 'club', 'wanted', 'be', 'kids', 'who', 'hung', 'out', 'club', 'dancing', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'acting', 'five', 'stars', 'book', 'day.Great', 'job', 'everyone']",N/A

122177,A1IBMUD9XXD68X,0792100085,"Michael E. Kreca ""mkreca@earthlink.net""","[5, 8]","""Saturday Night Fever"" is an example of a film that gives vent to a youthful but very real desperation, aimlessness and frustration that has long underlain contemporary American life, ones that permeate all of our existences in this society. It is also in many respects a wonderful ""time capsule"" of the 1970s, and about an often-stereotyped and ignored group in the USA; inner-city, blue-collar white ""ethnics"" and their manifold and often difficult cultural and socio-economic plights that have not had an adequate and respected public voice, except for being selfishly warped and exploited by the likes of Richard Nixon and George Wallace. Unlike his cluelessly provincial friends and family, daytime Brooklyn paint store worker and nighttime local disco king Tony Manero (John Travolta) is much smarter and far more aware than he initially appears, deeply yearning to escape his limited and gloomy environment, fearing that, like his parents, he will soon be inescapably swallowed up by it.The character of the seriously unhappy and increasingly desperate on-the-cusp-of-full-adulthood Manero is not a stereotype, as many mistakenly believe, but more accurately, a Weberian ""archetype"" of sorts (one that in Manero's case might have been created by Albert Camus himself) accurately embodying a general personality in a specific cultural milieu. He is also what anthropologists would term a ""marginal"" man, unpleasantly caught between his strong Brooklyn Italian-American ethnic identity (one with which he is not entirely comfortable because of what he believes are some of its undesirable attitudes and actions, unlike his friends and family) and the wish to ""make it"" over the bridge into the wider world of Manhattan (as represented by his honest and kind but rather transparently pretentious friend Stephanie) although unsure of how to proceed. The gap between the two locales is physically small, but psychologically vast. Disco dancer Manero's character is a disturbingly close analogue to that of Soviet spy Christopher Boyce in the 1985 film ""The Falcon and the Snowman;"" both characters suffer from a profound existential and cynical despair about themselves and their respective and equally shallow (but radically different) personal worlds; worlds deeply infected by the general cultural malaise, lethargy and escapism that dominated the USA in the 1970s, infections which they are trying to personally remedy in some manner, albeit in significantly different (but not in necessarily wise, healthful or rational) ways.A most important scene in the film was when Tony's favored older brother Frank suddenly decides to quit the Catholic priesthood (a landmark event echoing in the later ""Falcon"" when Boyce quits the Catholic seminary in disgust) a decision which sends shock waves through the family. It's a poignant scene of shattering disillusionment and utter disappointment; their parents' thin, dreamlike hold on vicarious middle-class respectability is suddenly swept aside, and in the wake of this trauma, the younger and less-favored Tony, to them, becomes just an even more pathetic example of someone going nowhere fast (the lyrics of the BeeGees' gritty song ""Stayin' Alive"" completely and concisely encapsulate the entire theme of this film.) However, amid the bitter wreckage of these various seemingly solid but in truth quite fragile and dangerous illusions (chief among them being the sudden death of one of Tony's friends in a drunken fall from a bridge and Tony's approaching loss of unchallenged dominance on the local disco dance floor) Tony fitfully realizes that he is finally ""free"" in a truly existential sense, and only then can he finally and completely leave behind his bleak, dead-end world while still unattached and quite young enough to do so.""SNF,"" despite its flaws, is a fine example of gritty, unvarnished, unapologetic, relentlessly politically-incorrect yet thoughtful, open and fascinating film-making of the 1970s--real stories about real people in real situations in real time--a decade which had probably been the finest era in American film.",4,Youthful Desperation & Frustration,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,4097,"['Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'example', 'film', 'vent', 'youthful', 'very',

The nighttime music and clothes stand in contrast to  the degrading and uncivil reality of young urban life that is captured in  the R-rated version of the film.The supporting roles, while a bit  caricatured, should not be ignored.Donna Pescow's character, Annette,  seeks to prove her sexiness to Travolta in all the wrong ways, until she  finds herself trapped in the middle of a veritable gang rape. Today, teen  women and men make the same mistakes -- young women boasting of their  sexual availability when all they want is affection, and young men treating  women as raw meat because they have little clue how to relate to women  sensitively as equals and adults.Barry Miller's character, young Bobby  C., is trapped between the shock of full-blown adult obligations to a  pregnant girlfriend, his family's devout religion, and his own severe  self-doubt and insecurity. A tragic outcome sparks the final revolt by  Travolta's character against the seedy reality of young adult life in the  ghetto.Saturday Night Fever unapologetically captures the cultural vibes  of the late Seventies -- including the really bad ones, without  glorification.

122181,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0792100085,Mike Stone,"[5, 7]","Having not lived through disco-mania in the late seventies, I was shocked to find out that, beneath the polyester and the disco balls and the thick Brooklyn-Guido accents and the all too slick music, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; is really an entertaining and deft social commentary.  Sure, it smacks of amateur hour at times, but that's also the source of its kick.Reflection on this story reveal it has much in common with a movie twenty-years its junior, a movie I love: &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.  Nihilistic brutal youth wreak havoc in their working class neighbourhoods during the day, work their jobs a bit, and then go out partying at night.  One of them is blessed with a certain prodigious talent (imagine mathematics and disco dancing, both sharpened to their highest degree of skill, as prodigious talents) that he doesn't know how to exploit.  A tumultuous time, and meeting a girl above his class, allows the prodigy to question the direction of his life, and his ensuing decision leaves his friends behind.  Turns out I shouldn't have been so shocked at liking this movie after all.Director John Badham, on what was obviously a shoestring budget, makes the most of what he's been given.  There's a great kinetic energy roaming through the film, even in those scenes not set in the dance club.  Witness Tony's opening march to glory (or, rather, back to the paint store where he works).  You can tell this guy's up for better things.  He even pulls off the quieter scenes, such as the several tormented attempts by the Manero family to have a civilized supper together.  But since Dad is out of work, and Mom is broken up over her son's recent decision to leave the priesthood, you just know that the fireworks are set to fly.  These are simple scenes, but very affecting.I think most of my preconceived notions about the movie (and -- what I thought was -- its relative lack of merit) stemmed from my unabashed hatred for John Travolta.  I despise his current persona: Overpaid, undertalented, bloated action STAR.  I loved everything about &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; except his performance.  To my mind, he's only been effective onscreen exactly once in the nineties, as the loan shark turned film producer in &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.  So these are my biases, plain and simple.  Now hear this: I loved him in this movie!  Sure, he's got that cheesy Vinnie Barbarino accent, and you can't help but laugh at his clownish clothes.  But that's looking at things the wrong way.  Put away your twenty-first century eyes, and remember that in his time, Tony Manero defined a certain popular style.Travolta, bless his heart, does convey heaps of charisma.  He's never been a finely tuned actor, but he sure embodies this character.  Tony is the kind of guy who (to greatly paraphrase Yogi Berra) nobody likes because he's so popular.  He's really a despicable dude, although a lot of the animosity he generates comes because he is so young (and is thus easily overlooked).  He's a thug, who bullies his friends, his boss, and even his mother, although he always feels bad about it afterwards (a conscience!).  But when he enters the Odyssey 2001 disco club, the sea of dancers (in the words of his brother Frank, the recent ex-priest) &quot;parts like he was Moses&quot;.  His first entrance is a very appealing moment, the lion entering his den.  Tony is most at home on the dance floor, where he can control almost any situation.  Travolta, and this is not saying anything new, was a wonderful dancer.  Lean and tall, he moves with grace and power and conviction.  He's beautiful to watch.  The prodigy in polyester (at one point, the bartender half-jokingly calls him &quot;Nureyev&quot;).  In order for the movie to work, the audience must be incapable of taking their eyes off of Tony.  Travolta pulls this off with aplomb.The rest of the cast is not as successful.  Whilst the film is aiming for a documentary feel in it's portrayal of grubby Brooklyn, many of the actors appear to be aiming for caricatures of the neighbourhood's inhabitants.  Tony's buddies are particularly gruesome offenders.  Even their walks appear overdone and mannered.  The slutty girls in the club fare no better.  Barry Miller -- as the chatterbox father-to-be Bobby C -- does the best job of the supporting players (although he's not nearly as affecting here as he was as Raul Garcia/Ralph Garcy in &quot;Fame&quot;).  His paranoia and need for acceptance is intense.  He also gets to play probably the most emotional scene in the film, and does a fine job (although he's not around to see the consequences of his actions).  Karen Lynn Gorney (as Stephanie) walks a tightrope between realism and parody.  Just enough of the former saves her performance as the girl from the neighbourhood trying to impress the boys from back home with tales of her celebrity-saturated Manhattan job.  But as the old saying goes, you can take the girl out of Brooklyn but you can't take Brooklyn out of the girl.  Stephanie tries her best, but can't help regressing back into thick Brooklynese (one hilarious moment has her catching herself in the middle of saying &quot;innerestin&quot;, and then repeatedly trying to train her tongue to pronounce it properly as &quot;interesting&quot;; Tony, sharp tack that he is, sees through her vain attempt at prosperity).I expected to giggle uncontrollably through &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.  At times I did.  But mostly I found myself watching a fun and furious film about one man's search for his true lot in life.  Or maybe just a better hairdryer.

As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.  While his quick study under Denny Terrio for those dance sequences showed a great deal of determination, Travolta's Tony Manero shines in so many other way. The looks of embarrassment and exasperation that his character expresses when confronted with the possibility of working in a Bay Ridge paint store all of his life, or the prejudice and regional chauvinism of his friends, or the behavior of his friends at White Castle or his initial inability to express himself to Stephanie in any way that might impress her, all of these and more contribute to a fully realized character.  While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence. While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.  Forget those who call this a musical.

Disco was a dance beat masquerading as music. Girls tended to like it because they like to dance while socializing. Guys tended to hate it since the music was horrible. Gradually, a few guys began venturing into the Disco bars, noting the large ratio of women to men. However these tended to be an odd mix of nerds and dumb guys. The nerds were there because they had trouble getting dates, but the dumb guys were often good looking and athletic.The leisure suite was the male dress of choice. It was made of polyester and came in a nightmarish variety of colors. Worn with a colored, open shirt and optional vest, it was intended to mix the formality of a business suit with the styling and colors from the so-called &#34;Hippie&#34; era, which was one of a long list of clothing that allowed conservative Americans to think of themselves as &#34;hip&#34;.(Flares was an earlier example, basically toned down bell bottoms worn by people wanting to make the statement they were &#34;cool&#34; but not scary.)Combining poor music, clothes that make current day people laugh out loud, and the theme that glorifies ignorance, there is not much to enjoy in this movie, except to view a curious moment in history.As a comparison, the rock band the Grateful Dead entertained audiences for 30 years, continually growing their audience, and played music that was dance music, intellectually satisfying, with excellent lyrics, proving you don't have to dumb down music to be popular. Their last decade or so they made more money, on average, than every other musical individual or group. More than Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Madonna, etc. And each year more and more young women filled the audience.You would't find any polyester at a Dead show, LOL.",1,Doesn't Hold Up,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2159,"['One', 'movies', 'reinforcing', 'notion', 'NOT', 'applying', 'mind', 'can', 'lead', 'success', 'sort.The', 'music', 'best', 'dreadful', 'Disco', 'scare', 'late', ""'70s"", 'produced', 'most', 'notably', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'who', 'actually', 'were', 'good', 'band', 'earlier', 'days', 'jumped', 'latest', 'trend', 'Disco', 'remain', 'forever', 'stained', 'association.The', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'Disco', 'died', 'quickly', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Disco', 'was', 'dance', 'beat', 'masquerading', 'music', 'Girls', 'tended', 'like', 'like', 'dance', 'socializing', 'Guys', 'tended', 'hate', 'music', 'was', 'horrible', 'Gradually', 'few', 'guys', 'began', 'venturing', 'Disco', 'bars', 'noting', 'large', 'ratio', 'women', 'men', 'However', 'tended', 'be', 'odd', 'mix', 'nerds', 'dumb', 'guys', 'nerds', 'were', 'there', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'dates', 'dumb', 'guys', 'were', 'often', 'good', 'looking', 'athletic.The', 'leisure', 'suite', 'was', 'male', 'dress', 'choice', 'was', 'made', 'polyester', 'came', 'nightmarish', 'variety', 'colors', 'Worn', 'colored', 'open', 'shirt', 'optional', 'vest', 'was', 'intended', 'mix', 'formality', 'business', 'suit', 'styling', 'colors', 'so-called', '34', 'Hippie', '34', 'era', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'list', 'clothing', 'allowed', 'conservative', 'Americans', 'think', '34', 'hip', '34', 'Flares', 'was', 'earlier', 'example', 'basically', 'toned', 'down', 'bell', 'bottoms', 'worn', 'people', 'wanting', 'make', 'statement', 'were', '34', 'cool', '34', 'not', 'scary', 'Combining', 'poor', 'music', 'make', 'current', 'day', 'people', 'loud', 'theme', 'ignorance', 'not', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'view', 'curious', 'moment', 'history.As', 'comparison', 'rock', 'band', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'entertained', 'audiences', '30', 'years', 'continually', 'growing', 'audience', 'played', 'music', 'was', 'dance', 'music', 'intellectually', 'satisfying', 'excellent', 'lyrics', 'proving', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dumb', 'down', 'music', 'be', 'popular', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'average', 'other', 'musical', 'individual', 'group', 'More', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Madonna', 'etc', 'year', 'more', 'more', 'young', 'women', 'filled', 'audience.You', ""would't"", 'find', 'polyester', 'Dead', 'show', 'LOL']",N/A
122190,A1A4LUBU9NZ5CJ,0792100085,Music & Movie Luver,"[1, 1]","""Saturday Night Fever"" is a late 70's classic coming-of-age film. When I saw this movie, in a packed theater on Staten Island, New York in the winter of 1977 the people around me seemed to miss the point. When Karen Lynn Gorney's character Stephanie tells John Travolta's Tony he's going nowhere the audience booed her & clapped for his response, ""What the ""f"" you got? A stairway to the stars?"" After the film's release, some people were emulating Tony's friend's negative & sometimes stereotypical behavior. The movie's message was to better yourself, but some people just didn't get this simple premise. Karen Lynn Gorney was excellent as Stephanie Mangano, the business person/Manhattanite wannabe who mesmerized Tony Manero. Although she was about 32 at the time, she was playing a 20 year old (this was common casting practice in the 70's). My favorite scene is the touching moments when Tony tells Stephanie all he knows about the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge symbolizes Tony's desire to get out of Brooklyn. If it had been The Brooklyn Bridge this scene would have made more sense, because the Verrazano Bridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, not Manhattan (a place we're their lives will supposedly get better). The language is authentic, the clothing, music & dancing are filled with 70's nostalgia. The film is NOT politically correct in any way. Therefore, it's very realistic, ""in-your-face"", & represents the time & place in which it was made. If you have an interest in late 70's pop culture this movie is a must see.",5,"""You're a clich&eacute;.

It is as if the film  itself never found the right voice.Perhaps as a caricature of the times,  the ""fever"" of an age rolling out of the rock of the 50s and 60s does  affect us moderately, but this is no medium lightweight in terms of  scenario and dialogue. No apology is being made here. Minorities, as much  as women, have their backs to the wall, and we are left wondering if  director John Badham intended us to see more, or feel more, as though we  could just as well watch the film with our eyes closed. So while it is hard  to recommend the film, it's also impossible to discount it completely.

Disco started to infiltrate the music scene as early as 1974 (with hits like ""Rock Your Baby"" by George McRae).  Discos were wildly popular in New York City by 1976 and they provided an outlet for the youth of the city to escape reality and dance away the night amid drinks, drugs and sex.  Inspired by an article in the New Yorker magazine that described the scene, producer Robert Stigwood wanted to capture it in a movie.  He realized the music is what drove the discos and he recruited his biggest act, The Bee Gees to record songs for the film.  This proved ingenious as the soundtrack and the movie are inseparable.  Although the band does not physically appear in the film, they are the co-stars of the film with Mr. Travolta.  The film and soundtrack became huge hits in late 1977 and into 1978 and disco moved from the urban cities to the heartland of America.  The film itself seems a bit dated, but it is saved from being a complete period piece by Mr. Travolta's superb acting.  He completely embodies the character of Brooklynite Tony Manero who works in a paint store during the week and lives to dance at the local disco on the weekends.  At work and at home, he's a nobody, but at the disco, he is the king.  The dancing scenes are classics and often imitated, but Mr. Travolta is the real deal on the dance floor.  Mr. Travolta earned the first of his two Best Actor Academy Award nominations for the film and it was richly deserved.  The soundtrack went on to spend 24 weeks at number one, spawn 4 number one singles and for a time was the biggest selling album in music history.",5,Catch The Fever,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,1725,"['Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'made', 'John', 'Travolta', 'superstar', 'also', 'defined', 'style', 'generation', 'Disco', 'started', 'infiltrate', 'music', 'scene', 'as', 'early', '1974', 'hits', 'Rock', 'Your', 'Baby', 'George', 'McRae', 'Discos', 'were', 'wildly', 'popular', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1976', 'provided', 'outlet', 'youth', 'city', 'escape', 'reality', 'dance', 'away', 'night', 'drinks', 'drugs', 'sex', 'Inspired', 'article', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'described', 'scene', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'wanted', 'capture', 'movie', 'realized', 'music', 'what', 'drove', 'discos', 'recruited', 'biggest', 'act', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'record', 'songs', 'film', 'proved', 'ingenious', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'are', 'inseparable', 'band', 'not', 'physically', 'appear', 'film', 'are', 'co-stars', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Travolta', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'became', 'huge', 'hits', 'late', '1977', '1978', 'disco', 'moved', 'urban', 'cities', 'heartland', 'America', 'film', 'bit', 'dated', 'saved', 'being', 'complete', 'period', 'piece', 'Mr.', 'Travolta', 'superb', 'acting', 'completely', 'character', 'Brooklynite', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'who', 'paint', 'store', 'week', 'dance', 'local', 'disco', 'weekends', 'work', 'home', 'nobody', 'disco', 'king', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'are', 'classics', 'often', 'imitated', 'Mr.', 'Travolta', 'real', 'deal', 'dance', 'floor', 'Mr.', 'Travolta', 'earned', 'first', 'two', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'film', 'was', 'richly', 'deserved', 'soundtrack', 'went', 'spend', '24', 'weeks', 'number', 'one', '4', 'number', 'one', 'singles', 'time', 'was', 'biggest', 'selling', 'album', 'music', 'history']",N/A

Most people associated with it or who revelled in the craze later disavow any such participation.  The fad was exemplified by men in high heels, dancing floors that doubled as strobe lights, and polyester clothing.  However, it also produced some music that was actually pretty good (though most people won't play these days if others are around), a brief rennaisance in the art of ballroom dancing, and one very decent movie; ""Saturday Night Fever"".This movie was the zenith of John Travolta's inconsistent career.  He was briefly on top of the world and not just because of his acting but because of his dancing.  The dance scenes in ""Saturday Night Fever"" showed the best that Disco had to offer.  Some people may put it down but I suspect that it's because they couldn't do it.  The music also offered the best that Disco had to offer.  The sound track (if listened to in private) can be appreciated as the best soundtrack album to come out of the 1970's (not counting concert movie sound tracks).The story in the movie is a good one using the theme of the angry young man with a talent.  Tony Manero (Travolta) is a person gifted with the talent of dance and he sees it as a way out of his dead end life.  His pursuit of excellence is made with an appreciation of excellence.  He is willing to work hard to be the best and will only accept the title if he actually earns it.  His brother, his buddies, his former girl friend, his dancing partner and his parents all fail to appreciate who he is and what he is about.  Some try but they all just see the world through their own personal issues.  The excellence of ""Saturday Night Fever"" is that viewers can focus on Tony's quest or they can focus on the world he lives in.  The film is enjoyable from either perspective.""Saturday Night Fever"" was actually released at the time Disco was fading out of style.  It revived it for a brief time but not for long.

There he encounters the same problems all men seem to have, finding the right woman and being accepted by others.  Tony finds himself through his dancing abilities. He takes much abuse at home because his parents always compare him to his brother, a Catholic priest. Probably the biggest attraction in this movie is the musical score and Bee Gees' music.

The lights and over-the-top fashions enable an otherwise average young man to become somebody special in the disco scene.Few TV Actors (his principal reputation at the time of filming), let alone teen heartthrobs at that, can make such a culturally impacting film which stays riveting twenty five years after it's debut. Through this release, Travolta made a seamless transition from ""Teen Idol"" to ""Superstar"".What could have ended up being a hastily slapped-together bubblegum project thankfully turned out to be a product that is honest and complex on so many levels. The angst and yearning are clearly genuine and keep the viewer glued to Tony's ongoing quest to find and define himself.Certainly, the filming and the costume are horribly dated by modern standards, but the script remains captivating . Many successors have tried to replicate the plot, with various degrees of success and failure, but this is cinematic achievement unparalleled.Although the movie does have some scenes which may be viewed as potentially sexist today, it is important to remember that efforts against sexual assault and domestic violence were just gaining momentum around this time, and many other institutions in society exhibited the same laid-back attitude towards something now universally recognized as evil.

With songs like Stayin' Alive, How Deep is Your Love, Night Fever, More Than a Woman, If I Can't Have You, Disco Inferno and You Should Be Dancing, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not only a great film, but it was also about the Bee Gees music and John Travolta's dance moves.When the film returned to the big screen for the first time in 1996, the theatre was packed, people cheered throughout the whole film, were even doing the dance moves when the scenes popped up and wuld clap when a dance number was over.  This was phenomenonal and could I mention, revolutionary.  I went to see the film 14 times on the big screen since then.  I also have the big movie poster along with the vinyl album foldout both hanging up on my wall at home.  I just love SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.Today, I went out to the store and I bought my very own copy of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER on DVD and man, was I ever happy and this 25th Anniversary Edition of the DVD is actually quite pleasing and worthy of every penny.This revolutionary film stars John Travolta, Karyn Lynn Gorney and Donna Pescow.  The story revolves around Tony Monero (Travolta), a part time paint store worker who is the dancing king of the disco and befriends a girl (Gorney) in the process.  The story is very crisp, the dialogue is realistic and sharp and the dance scenes are very vibrant.  Blend all that together and you have a revolutionary film of the 1970's which still stands out in todays' standards.  This film also marked the debut of Fran Drescher (The Nanny) who asks Johnnie if he is as good in bed as he is on the dancefloor.The DVD is great.  The packaging is vibrant, the disc design is colourful and overall great packaging.  The picture quality is so good, although some soft filters may appears which I think adds more appeal to the film.  Also, the print is free from scratches, dust, dirt and grain, the film seems like it is 25 minutes old and not 25 years.  Paramount also put a little boogie woogie into the sound department as the sound is fresh, crisp, vibrant and sharp in the way SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER needs to be heard.As for Extra Feautures, included are 29 minutes of ""highlights"" of VH1's Behind the Music, 3 Deleted Scenes which were interesting to see which could have blended in with the story but after watching them, I could see why they were left out.  There is also an audio commentary by director John Badham.  Oddly, there were no theatre trailers but, Paramount has put out a great DVD package that makes SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER worth having.As the movie posters' tag line was ""Where do you go when the record is over?"", I would have to say, ""Where do you go when the DVD movie is over?""So go boogie, put on your boogie woogie dancing shoes and get your copy of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER on DVD today and feel the Night Fever !!!!!!",5,THE BEST NOSTALGIA THAT VINTAGE HAS TO OFFER,1034035200,"10 8, 2002",2002,3041,"['Man', 'Man', 'Man', 'have', 'nothing', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever.I', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'grew', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'greatest', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'still', 'out', 'today', 'songs', 'Stayin', 'Alive', 'How', 'Deep', 'Love', 'Night', 'Fever', 'More', 'Woman', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Have', 'Disco', 'Inferno', 'Should', 'Be', 'Dancing', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'music', 'John', 'Travolta', 'dance', 'moves.When', 'film', 'returned', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'time', '1996', 'theatre', 'was', 'packed', 'people', 'cheered', 'whole', 'film', 'were', 'even', 'doing', 'dance', 'moves', 'when', 'scenes', 'popped', 'up', 'wuld', 'clap', 'when', 'dance', 'number', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'phenomenonal', 'could', 'mention', 'revolutionary', 'went', 'see', 'film', '14', 'times', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'also', 'have', 'big', 'movie', 'poster', 'vinyl', 'album', 'hanging', 'up', 'wall', 'home', 'just', 'love', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER.Today', 'went', 'store', 'bought', 'very', 'own', 'copy', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'DVD', 'man', 'was', 'ever', 'happy', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'actually', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'worthy', 'penny.This', 'revolutionary', 'film', 'stars', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Karyn', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'story', 'around', 'Tony', 'Monero', 'Travolta', 'part', 'time', 'paint', 'store', 'worker', 'who', 'dancing', 'king', 'disco', 'girl', 'Gorney', 'process', 'story', 'very', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'sharp', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'vibrant', 'Blend', 'together', 'have', 'revolutionary', 'film', '1970', 'still', 'out', 'todays', 'standards', 'film', 'also', 'marked', 'debut', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Nanny', 'who', 'Johnnie', 'as', 'good', 'bed', 'dancefloor.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'packaging', 'vibrant', 'disc', 'design', 'colourful', 'overall', 'great', 'packaging', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'good', 'soft', 'filters', 'may', 'think', 'more', 'appeal', 'film', 'Also', 'print', 'free', 'scratches', 'dust', 'dirt', 'grain', 'film', '25', 'minutes', 'old', 'not', '25', 'years', 'Paramount', 'also', 'put', 'little', 'boogie', 'woogie', 'sound', 'department', 'sound', 'fresh', 'crisp', 'vibrant', 'sharp', 'way', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'be', 'heard.As', 'Extra', 'Feautures', 'included', 'are', '29', 'minutes', 'highlights', 'VH1', 'Music', '3', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'blended', 'story', 'watching', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'John', 'Badham', 'Oddly', 'were', 'theatre', 'trailers', 'Paramount', 'put', 'out', 'great', 'DVD', 'package', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'movie', 'posters', 'tag', 'line', 'was', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'when', 'record', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'when', 'DVD', 'movie', 'So', 'go', 'boogie', 'put', 'boogie', 'woogie', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'get', 'copy', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'DVD', 'today', 'feel', 'Night', 'Fever']",N/A

Today, nearly 30 years after its release, both the movie and its leading star are still stunning!Travolta plays Tony Manero, a typical 70's misguided youth, who could care less about the future. He struts when he walks, works at a paint shop, gives his family whom he lives with a hard time, and screws around with his buddies. At night, he's the star at a local disco club. He dances like his life depends on it, and even his brother thinks that his dancing is amazing. Tony finds a private retreat from his turbulent life and confusion on the dancefloor, something that Night Fever captures to maximum excitement.Travolta earned his first of 2 Oscar nominations for his role as Manero, his second nomination would be 17 years later for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. But what makes Saturday Night Fever such a huge hit is the extraordinary music soundtrack by The Bee Gees, featuring the classic hits Staying Alive, Night Fever, More Than A Woman and How Deep Is Your Love?, the brilliant directing by John Badham (Short Circuit, The Hard Way), and, most of all, the true depiction of the faded out 70's disco generation with all their hair styles, attitude, and clothes (Travolta's white suit has become an important pop culture symbol).RecommendedA",5,Feel the Night Fever!,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1347,"['Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'classic', '70', 'movie', 'starring', 'young', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Today', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'release', 'movie', 'leading', 'star', 'are', 'still', 'stunning', 'Travolta', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'typical', '70', 'misguided', 'youth', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'future', 'when', 'paint', 'shop', 'family', 'whom', 'hard', 'time', 'screws', 'buddies', 'night', 'star', 'local', 'disco', 'club', 'life', 'even', 'brother', 'dancing', 'amazing', 'Tony', 'private', 'retreat', 'turbulent', 'life', 'confusion', 'dancefloor', 'something', 'Night', 'Fever', 'maximum', 'excitement.Travolta', 'earned', 'first', '2', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'role', 'Manero', 'second', 'nomination', 'would', 'be', '17', 'years', 'later', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'what', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'huge', 'hit', 'extraordinary', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'featuring', 'classic', 'hits', 'Staying', 'Alive', 'Night', 'Fever', 'More', 'A', 'Woman', 'How', 'Deep', 'Love', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'John', 'Badham', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'Hard', 'Way', 'most', 'true', 'depiction', 'faded', 'out', '70', 'disco', 'generation', 'hair', 'styles', 'attitude', 'clothes', 'Travolta', 'white', 'suit', 'become', 'important', 'pop', 'culture', 'symbol', '.RecommendedA']",N/A

122247,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,0792100085,The Patriarch,"[2, 8]","Being a longtime fan of Welcome Back Kotter, I was flabbergasted to learn that Vinnie Barbarino had a spin-off movie. Now, I was always a Horshack man, but I'd watch anything with a Sweat-hog in it, even if it happened to be Juan Epstein.I was a little disappointed after popping it in however, as this movie has very little to do with Welcome back Kotter. It does mention that Vinnie is in High school, but that's as far as it goes. He never has the Sweat-hogs over, he never even mentions them. I guess they were trying to separate Vinnie from the show, but if that were the case why make a spin off to begin with? Simple, green. They knew nobody would see this movie if it didn't have a big star from Kotter in it.No sir, this movie focuses Vinnie's night life. Which strangely enough revolves almost entirely around Disco dancing. I never heard Vinnie mention Disco once on Kotter, now all of a sudden it's his reason for living? Vinnie dreams of winning a Disco dance contest, so he dumps his tawdry girlfriend and tries to hook up with a classy girl that can dance so he can win the contest as her dance partner.That's pretty much it. It's mostly filled with unnecessary profanity and filler. Vinnie's brother decides not to become a priest when he learns he can't marry. His tawdry ex keeps trying to get the hook-up. And so on and so forth. Very little happens. Therefore this movie fails. It failed to deliver any laughs because Vinnie wanted the spotlight and wouldn't share it with the other Sweat-hogs. Couldn't they at least have had him do his signature, ""Bab bab bab, bab babarinoooooo!"" dance? I mean, there's a point in this movie where Vinnie's parents ask him where he's been all day, HE DOESN'T EVEN respond using his classic catchphrase, ""What? Where?""!!!Even if the Urban legend that says you can spot Principle Woodman doing the ""Disco Duck"" in the background of one of the night clubs is true, that still doesn't make up for the resounding lack of Sweat-hogs in this movie.

It's almost hard to  imagine  now that John Travolta could do what he did during the late '70s.  The  music was cool too, being a fan of almost all kinds of music (including  oldies/disco) the songs, especially the Bee Gees songs, really captures the  fun of what music used to be.  I also like this film because I also like to  dance, so it stimulates my interest in that aspect.  Although I like the  film, I also would not show this to a younger audience because of the  graphic scenes of sex, violence, and family dispute.  The darker side of  the film does exist, the reality of how hard life could be when living in  poverty and the abuse and mistreatment of women sends out a strong message  to the audience, but suprisingly even with this, it still has that tint of  hope for a brighter future for John Travolta's character which makes you  want to believe he can escape his bondage of his troubled life and start  fresh to a new beginning.  So this isn't your typical feel good dance  movie.  It is still a classic although it shows the darker side of American  pop culture in the late '70s.

To me, it has certainly great value in those categories. What struck me more than just the Bee Gees was its intense realism although cast in the popular formula of boy meets girl. This movie was clearly marketed for the youth and shares a place among like films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (1977). The claustrophobia of the working-class Brooklyn neighborhood Bayside is subtly interwoven in the spectacle of bell bottoms and gyrating hips. But the film has, in my opinion, a clear psychological dimension: frustration, meaningfulness and the pains of growing up with limited mobility. Interestingly this movie is almost the opposite of, say, &quot;Grease,&quot; which is nothing else than a large over-iced birthday cake. &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; reminded me of sentiments I felt when watching &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; or even &quot;Rocky&quot;!

I'm curious why they didn't include the extra footage they used for the PG version which includes more dance scenes. There is a decent VH1 Behind the Music episode about it. If you saw it when it was on, then there's no reason to see it again; although it does have some fabulous rehearsal footage of John that's definitely worth viewing. The best of the bunch is director John Badham's commentary which is very good and exactly what a director commentary should be-peppered with amusing trivia (e.g. the lady who played Travolta's grandmother kept presenting him with scenes she had written to beef up her part), technical details, and wry humor.

What puzzles me, is that tiny movie release companies are putting out stunning transfers of old movies, and often with fantastic menu's (check out Princess Bride for an example).  SNF DVD's saving grace is that it contains deleted scenes and a decent doco (with rare rehearsal footage of Travolta practicing his dance steps - this footage was apparently locked up and forgotten about for a long time).  At least in that respect, Paramount are starting to give their consumers more!  As for the deleted scenes, they are nothing to rave about, but are worth having for historic purposes.

This film depicts John Travolta as Brookyn's Tony Manero, hero to the dance floor. His dead end job at a paint store makes him live for The Saturday Night disco scene. Travolta meets Karen Gorney and enters a dance contest with her but she refuses his sexuall advances. Gorney sees herself going to Manhattan to move on with her life. Travolta sees her as a snob. One local girl played by Donna Pescow likes Travolta but is pushed away by him for Gorneys character since she's a better dancer and Pescow is considered boring. What underlies is Trvoltas often at odds relationship with his family. Racial gang wars and a friend you can't help but wonder about his sexuality. Not only did this movie imitate the era, it influenced the next seven years with it's record selling soundtrack and the great timing in which some of the best nightclubs in America remained open. The movies message is vague but lets you fill in the blanks as Travoltas (Manero) becomes fed up with his existing lifestyle. Moviegoers became so enthralled with it, it would continue into the mid 80's. A PG version was recut to feature the dancing and less social conciousness with virtually no explicit language. This movie had one of the biggest impacts of late 70's films!",5,The Disco Era Classic Film,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,1358,"['1977', 'not', 'everybody', 'knew', 'what', 'innovative', 'disco', 'music', 'was', 'what', 'extent', 'night', 'clubing', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Brookyn', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'hero', 'dance', 'floor', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'paint', 'store', 'live', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'disco', 'scene', 'Travolta', 'Karen', 'Gorney', 'dance', 'contest', 'sexuall', 'advances', 'Gorney', 'going', 'Manhattan', 'move', 'life', 'Travolta', 'snob', 'One', 'local', 'girl', 'played', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'Travolta', 'pushed', 'away', 'Gorneys', 'character', 'better', 'dancer', 'Pescow', 'considered', 'boring', 'What', 'Trvoltas', 'often', 'odds', 'relationship', 'family', 'Racial', 'gang', 'wars', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'sexuality', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'imitate', 'era', 'influenced', 'next', 'seven', 'years', 'record', 'selling', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'timing', 'best', 'nightclubs', 'America', 'remained', 'open', 'movies', 'message', 'vague', 'fill', 'blanks', 'Travoltas', 'Manero', 'fed', 'up', 'existing', 'lifestyle', 'Moviegoers', 'became', 'so', 'enthralled', 'would', 'continue', 'mid', '80', 'PG', 'version', 'was', 'recut', 'feature', 'dancing', 'less', 'social', 'conciousness', 'virtually', 'explicit', 'language', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'biggest', 'impacts', 'late', '70', 'films']",N/A
