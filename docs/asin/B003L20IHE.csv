It had a happy ending, and in this case predictability was a good thing, I was hoping it would end the way it did. Charlie St cloud is a kid who seemed to have it all going for him. He loved sailing and practised it religiously. He got so good at it that he recieved a scholarship to Stanford University.  But when a car accident takes his little brothers life, Charlie's guilt and loss cripples him mentally. He now has the ability to communicate with dead, specifically is little brother who he meets everyday before sundown to play catch. This movie is a tear jerker, the love between the brothers was too much to bear. I guess it helps that Zac Efron is just so damn gorgeous you simple can't not love him.

1349465,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003L20IHE,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)Sometimes you have to steer clear of the crowd, and with Charlie St. Cloud (2010), that's what I have to do. While both moviegoers and film critics generally panned this movie, I think they missed the mark on this one. While it may not be edgy or completely original, both its star Zac Efron and the film try to go places that so few movies dare to. To some degree, Charlie St. Cloud is like Field of Dreams (1989). You have to buy into it's nearly ludicrous concept of the story being told in both the real world and in another world, namely purgatory or some other realm where the spirits of dead people come to life. I'm not really giving anything away because the concept is right there in the trailer and early on in the movie.Director Burr Steers had a challenging job bringing this story to the screen, but I think he assembled a good cast and a good team to execute his vision. It's been awhile since we've since Kim Basinger on screen in anything significant. Her role as Charlie's mother is slight, but I enjoyed what little we got of her. Augustus Prew plays a fun sidekick character, and I liked Charlie Tahan as the younger St. Cloud brother, Sam. Rounding out the supporting cast is Donal Logue and Ray Liotta, two under utilized actors. I'm not really a fan of Amanda Crew as Charlie's love interest, Tess, but she does what she needs to.Yes, the movie is a bit of a soap opera at times. And yes, it's predictable at times. And yes, Efron over acts at times. But somehow I was able to get past all of that and connect with the heart of the story and its characters and the message they deliver. The cinematography is stunning, the production design beautiful, and overall, this is a story and world I liked visiting.

1349469,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003L20IHE,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 7]","""Charlie St. Cloud"" would be the love child of a Nicholas Sparks novel and an M. Night Shyamalan film, were such a thing possible. It's on the one hand a relentlessly sentimental tearjerker and on the other hand a supernatural mystery, with a throwaway plot twist added for good measure. To say this film is awful would be harsh. Still, it certainly doesn't aspire to be anything more than what it so obviously is, so seeing this movie really isn't necessary - unless, of course, you're a tweenybopper hoping to lose yourself in the dreamy recesses of Zac Efron's eyes. That may, in fact, be the only reason he was cast, since the role is so generic that any actor could have played it to more or less the same effect. I suppose it doesn't really matter; his performance is decent enough, and I'm sure he will someday be recognized as the dramatic actor he always wanted to be.Adapted from Ben Sherwood's novel ""The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud,"" the premise is that the title character, played by Efron, gains the ability to see ghosts after surviving a car accident. One of the ghosts is his kid brother, Sam (Charlie Tahan), who unfortunately was in the car when it crashed. Every day at sunset, the two meet in a secluded spot in the woods to play catch, since, in life, Sam was a devoted Baseball fan. It's a nice idea, although the filmmakers never take full advantage of Charlie's sixth sense, not even after he gives up on college and yacht racing, stays in his seaside hometown, and becomes a cemetery groundskeeper. The details of the plot prevent me from elaborating on this, but rest assured, he doesn't see anywhere near as many dead people as you might think.Despite his reputation as a nutcase (which is itself painfully underdeveloped), Charlie attracts the attention of local yacht enthusiast Tess Carroll (Amanda Crew), who hopes to sail around the world and tests herself by heading into rough, stormy waters. As their relationship turns romantic, Sam - or rather, his ghost - begins to worry that he will be forgotten. Tess, in turn, tells Charlie that, at some point, he has to let go. He can't let go, he tells Tess. He made Sam a promise. This, of course, will be challenged in due time, although I'm afraid I can't say any more than that.I'm making this sound like a complete film, but the truth is that everything about ""Charlie St. Cloud"" feels oddly condensed and unfocused. It's well established, for example, that Charlie can speak to Sam's ghost, but that's about it as far as character development is concerned. Never once do we see anything resembling brotherly love - anything, at least, the goes beyond the obvious spectacle of a young man and a boy playing catch in the woods. Likewise, we don't see any real love blooming between Charlie and Tess, maybe because (1) it happens far too quickly for us to believe it, and (2) we don't know that much about either one of them. For all I know, this may be more an issue of editing than of how the screenplay was written. Whatever the case, the film is so sparse that, even when it leads to something thematically, characteristically, or structurally, there's no sense that anything has led anywhere.Other touches, like Charlie's encounter with the paramedic who saved his life (Ray Liotta), do little more than serve as an excuse for sermonizing. I don't mind being sermonized to, but the message involved has to have some thematic significance. What this movie tells us about life, living, and letting go is ultimately so broad and disconnected from the material that it fails to resonate. It's bad enough that the paramedic just happens to be sick with cancer upon reuniting with Charlie; this isn't plot advancement, but emotional manipulation, and that never, ever works when presented so obviously. At least, it never, ever works for me. This is the kind of overwrought storytelling that keeps me at a distance from Nicholas Sparks film adaptations. It seems he has had quite an influence. Will no one learn from his mistakes?I will give this movie credit for its cinematography, with wonderful shots of picturesque harbors, open waters, and quaint shacks filling the scenery. A sequence of Efron and Crew frolicking through a foggy, moonlit cemetery is especially memorable; what would normally be associated with the Universal horror movies of old is instead a surprisingly effective example of high romance, if not mild eroticism. The film looks so good that it's a shame more of an effort wasn't put into the plot, the tone, and the characters. ""Charlie St. Cloud,"" despite having its heart in the right place, is too sappy, too meandering, and too weak in its story. The only real draw this movie has for audiences is Zac Efron, although it may be a moot point since he's actively trying to outgrow his teen heartthrob status.",3,He Sees Dead People,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,4824,"['Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'child', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'novel', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'were', 'thing', 'possible', 'one', 'hand', 'relentlessly', 'sentimental', 'tearjerker', 'other', 'hand', 'supernatural', 'mystery', 'throwaway', 'plot', 'twist', 'added', 'good', 'measure', 'say', 'film', 'awful', 'would', 'be', 'harsh', 'Still', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'so', 'obviously', 'so', 'seeing', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'course', ""'re"", 'tweenybopper', 'hoping', 'lose', 'dreamy', 'recesses', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'eyes', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'so', 'generic', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'effect', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'performance', 'decent', 'enough', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'recognized', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'always', 'wanted', 'be.Adapted', 'Ben', 'Sherwood', 'novel', 'Death', 'Life', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'premise', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Efron', 'gains', 'ability', 'see', 'ghosts', 'surviving', 'car', 'accident', 'One', 'ghosts', 'kid', 'brother', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Tahan', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'car', 'when', 'crashed', 'day', 'sunset', 'two', 'meet', 'secluded', 'spot', 'woods', 'play', 'catch', 'life', 'Sam', 'was', 'devoted', 'Baseball', 'fan', 'nice', 'idea', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'Charlie', 'sixth', 'sense', 'not', 'even', 'up', 'college', 'yacht', 'racing', 'seaside', 'hometown', 'cemetery', 'groundskeeper', 'details', 'plot', 'prevent', 'elaborating', 'rest', 'assured', ""n't"", 'see', 'anywhere', 'many', 'dead', 'people', 'might', 'think.Despite', 'reputation', 'nutcase', 'painfully', 'underdeveloped', 'Charlie', 'attention', 'local', 'yacht', 'enthusiast', 'Tess', 'Carroll', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'who', 'sail', 'world', 'tests', 'heading', 'rough', 'stormy', 'waters', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'Sam', 'rather', 'ghost', 'worry', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Tess', 'turn', 'Charlie', 'point', 'let', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Tess', 'made', 'Sam', 'promise', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'challenged', 'due', 'time', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'that.I', ""'m"", 'making', 'sound', 'complete', 'film', 'truth', 'everything', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'feels', 'oddly', 'condensed', 'unfocused', 'well', 'established', 'example', 'Charlie', 'can', 'speak', 'Sam', 'ghost', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'character', 'development', 'concerned', 'Never', 'once', 'do', 'see', 'anything', 'resembling', 'brotherly', 'love', 'anything', 'least', 'obvious', 'spectacle', 'young', 'man', 'boy', 'playing', 'catch', 'woods', 'Likewise', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'love', 'blooming', 'Charlie', 'Tess', 'maybe', '1', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'believe', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'that', 'much', 'one', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'issue', 'editing', 'how', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'case', 'film', 'so', 'sparse', 'even', 'when', 'something', 'thematically', 'characteristically', 'structurally', 'sense', 'anything', 'led', 'anywhere.Other', 'touches', 'Charlie', 'encounter', 'paramedic', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'serve', 'excuse', 'sermonizing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'sermonized', 'message', 'involved', 'have', 'thematic', 'significance', 'What', 'movie', 'life', 'living', 'letting', 'go', 'ultimately', 'so', 'broad', 'disconnected', 'material', 'resonate', 'bad', 'enough', 'paramedic', 'just', 'be', 'sick', 'cancer', 'reuniting', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'plot', 'advancement', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'never', 'ever', 'when', 'presented', 'so', 'obviously', 'least', 'never', 'ever', 'kind', 'overwrought', 'storytelling', 'distance', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'film', 'adaptations', 'had', 'quite', 'influence', 'Will', 'one', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'shots', 'picturesque', 'harbors', 'open', 'waters', 'quaint', 'shacks', 'filling', 'scenery', 'sequence', 'Efron', 'Crew', 'frolicking', 'foggy', 'moonlit', 'cemetery', 'especially', 'memorable', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'associated', 'Universal', 'horror', 'movies', 'old', 'instead', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'example', 'high', 'romance', 'not', 'mild', 'eroticism', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'shame', 'more', 'effort', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'plot', 'tone', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'having', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'too', 'sappy', 'too', 'meandering', 'too', 'weak', 'story', 'only', 'real', 'draw', 'movie', 'audiences', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'may', 'be', 'moot', 'point', 'actively', 'trying', 'outgrow', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'status']",N/A

I had it on my hard drive to watch for awhile but since I really like action and adventure, I thought it might be slow and not interesting for me. Not so at all. It was excellent!It starts off with Charlie and his younger brother Sam sailing (nice shots too) and hanging out before he is to go to Stanford on a sailing scholarship. It's obvious that they are very close and enjoy each other's company. But one night, their car gets hit while Charlie is driving and Sam dies. While clinically dead, Charlie makes a promise to Sam in the visions he has that he will meet Sam every day for baseball before sunset.Then the movie skips five years ahead. Devasted and tormented by guilt, Charlie has taken a job as caretaker in the cemetery that Sam is buried in instead of going away to college and moving on with his life so he can keep his promise to Sam. Every day at sunset, Charlie meets Sam, who is caught in limbo between 'here' and the afterlife. It doesn't really explain what Sam does all day long and where he is, but it does make it clear that Sam doesn't want to 'move on' because he will miss Charlie and that he is afraid if Charlie doesn't meet him each day, he will disappear.Then Charlie meets a girl, Tess, who also has a passion for sailing. Charlie struggles with moving on with his life versus keeping his promise to Sam. Then she disappears while boating and Charlie is forced to make a decision.I really enjoyed the film and didn't realize Charlie was Zac Efron (who my son hates). His acting was excellent.

Charlie is an up and coming young adult who has just graduated high school and has the whole world in front of him when tragedy strikes.  The rest of the movie basically involves seeing how Charlie's life is altered and how he deals with his personal misfortune.  Efron, although relying on his eyes to do a lot of the acting, ultimately succeeds in gaining empathy for Charlie's unfortunate loss.This a family film with a special message viewers of nearly all ages will enjoy.  The acting in other key roles is right on, including newcomer Charlie Tahan's depiction of Sam St Cloud and Amanda Crew's portrayal of the girl who captures Charlie St Cloud's heart.  The supporting characters are vividly brought to the screen by two of Hollywood's best: Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger.

1349480,A28S3F43F76HSH,B003L20IHE,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[2, 4]","I have to start by saying that I give Zac Efron props for trying to break out of his High School Musical/Teenage Heartthrob stereotype. He is certainly trying to differentiate himself from his past characters and for that I give him a great deal of credit. It is difficult for a teen sensation to break out from the mold he has made for himself, especially if that childhood mold was as lucrative as Efron's. Sadly, I don't think Charlie St. Cloud was the role to break Efron free from his teen bop status. The plot is weak, the writing is cliched, and the storyline is beyond convoluted. It seems that this movie was made to show Efron's acting chops but instead it comes off as a Hallmark version of The Sixth Sense.Charlie is a sailing champ who is devoted to his younger brother, Sam, and their single mom. While the two brothers are close, Charlie has just graduated and wants to spend time with his friends. One night, while their mom is out, Charlie is put in charge of watching Sam. The two get into a bad car accident in which Sam is killed. Charlie is unable to forgive himself. He defers going to Standford and spends five years working as a landscaper/caretaker of the local cemetery. Every evening he meets Sam's ghost in the forest to plan catch. Charlie's pattern is disrupted when he meets a female sailor with whom he falls in love. Suddenly he must choose whether to live in the past with the ghost of his brother or try to forge a life for himself in the present.Though this movie touches on deep issues of life after death, grief, and regret, it does little more than tap on these issues. As a Massachusetts resident, it was hard for me to believe that this movie actually took place in Quincy when in fact it looked a great deal like the California coast. Yet my greatest disappointment was how forgettable this film is. I only watched it a couple of days ago and my memory of it is already hazy. I always look for movies and books that leave a lasting impression and make me continue to think about the characters for days or even weeks. This is not so with Charlie St. Cloud.

The incredibly beautiful Zac Efron in the title role is most sweet, enjoyable and he has a stillness that is fitting. Very dignified, a quiet charm that I think might take him a long way in film.Charlie has lost his 'baby' brother Sam in an accident, the results of which leave Charlie able to see certain deceased people. The film, while it keeps the ghost of young Sam ghostly enough, does not seem able to find its right niche. After all, is this a ghost here, a ghost there, or is Charlie really just left wacko from his injuries?The sad predictability of something I expected to really pop - crazy boy-sees-ghosts-finds-girl, she brings him back to a normal life - YAWN! There was a powerful potential in the relationship, but the makers missed that beat also. This film attracted me for many reasons and I waited a long time to view it. Aside from the inducement of the stunning Zac, I found myself turning away in boredom more than once.It seems a relatively safe family film, it's a deep enough story to satisfy the average viewer. If you can stomach the canned cream corn of the storyline, it is even passable as a romance. Just as a selfish little wish, I hope Zac Efron, who is strongly rumored to be gay, will try a ""bromance"" comedy next time around - I haven't seen him star in anything since this film.That's it, I won't warn you away from this so-so film, I've seen a lot worse.

1349486,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B003L20IHE,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 1]","These brief and admittedly superficial comments are just some impressions on having seen the still new movie, ""Charlie St-Cloud"", that stars Zac Efron.  The film is a bit silly and weepily sentimental, but it provides Zac with many chances to pose beautifully his increasingly hunky body, ""hunkily man"" now rather than ""hunkily teenage boy"".  I wish that Efron had shown more bare skin, which, of course, is what everybody really wants to see in this kind of commercial endeavour, but he was shirtless at times.  (At some other times, his t-shirt would be soaking wet and clinging sexily to his ""hard"" body, very suggestively.)  Actually, Efron's acting is quite good; any faults are of the script, not his, for his acting really is exceptionally fine, certainly better than that of most of the other principal and secondary characters.Zac even has pre-marital sex in this film, quite a change for this Disney studio-famed star!  That is going to shock some of his fans -- or, more likely, their parents and other cackling adults.  The sex, though, is quite discrete.  If it is there in the novel (which I have not read), then it would have to be in the film, too, to render the book cinematically with some fidelity.  The impressive, tranquil beauty of the sylvan setting of the film, which rivals the romantic couple's humanly physical allure for attention, is almost reason enough to see this movie.This is not my favourite Zac Efron film, so far.  That honour goes to ""17 Again"", in which the ""eye candy"" charms of Efron are on more display, especially in those clinging, sweat-soaked gym outfits, in an entertaining and amusing film (one that has more focus and skill in script and in some other important other ways) in which Zac Efron acts utterly to perfection, much better, in fact, than too many critics are willing to admit.  Often Zac Efron transcends ""his material"" (the films) in a most gratifying way, and he does that again in ""Charlie St-Cloud"".",4,Zac Efron's Contribution Is Better Than the Film Itself,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1962,"['brief', 'admittedly', 'superficial', 'comments', 'are', 'just', 'impressions', 'having', 'seen', 'still', 'new', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'St-Cloud', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'film', 'bit', 'silly', 'weepily', 'sentimental', 'Zac', 'many', 'chances', 'pose', 'beautifully', 'increasingly', 'hunky', 'body', 'hunkily', 'man', 'now', 'rather', 'hunkily', 'teenage', 'boy', 'wish', 'Efron', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'bare', 'skin', 'course', 'what', 'everybody', 'really', 'see', 'kind', 'commercial', 'endeavour', 'was', 'shirtless', 'times', 'other', 'times', 't-shirt', 'would', 'be', 'soaking', 'wet', 'clinging', 'sexily', 'hard', 'body', 'very', 'suggestively', 'Actually', 'Efron', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'faults', 'are', 'script', 'not', 'acting', 'really', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'principal', 'secondary', 'characters.Zac', 'even', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'film', 'quite', 'change', 'Disney', 'studio-famed', 'star', 'going', 'shock', 'fans', 'more', 'likely', 'parents', 'other', 'cackling', 'adults', 'sex', 'quite', 'discrete', 'there', 'novel', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'film', 'too', 'render', 'book', 'cinematically', 'fidelity', 'impressive', 'tranquil', 'beauty', 'sylvan', 'setting', 'film', 'romantic', 'couple', 'humanly', 'physical', 'allure', 'attention', 'almost', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'movie.This', 'not', 'favourite', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'honour', '17', 'Again', 'eye', 'candy', 'charms', 'Efron', 'are', 'more', 'display', 'especially', 'clinging', 'sweat-soaked', 'gym', 'outfits', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'focus', 'skill', 'script', 'other', 'important', 'other', 'ways', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'utterly', 'perfection', 'much', 'better', 'fact', 'too', 'many', 'critics', 'are', 'willing', 'admit', 'Often', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'material', 'films', 'most', 'gratifying', 'way', 'again', 'Charlie', 'St-Cloud']",N/A

As the story begins, Charlie and his brother, Sam are in the winners' circle. They are great both at sailing and at their academics. However, a fatal car crash soon changes all that.Both the brothers die in the crash, however, only Charlie is eventually brought back to life. However, it would appear that his crossing over into the realm of death, even though it may have only have been for a few minutes, has changed him. He is now able to communicate with the dead, maybe his 'sixth sense' has been awakened by this experience.Over the next few years, Charlie has abandoned going to university, and has taken up a lowly job maintaining a graveyard, where every early evening he meets with Sam. He also has an encounter with a former classmate, who had joined the U.S. Marines and was killed in action.**** Potential Spoiler Ahead ****---------------------------------The film is just about to stall and go into a nose dive when enter Tess, a young pretty independent sailor of some renown. A romantic relationship starts to develop between Charlie and her.

1349491,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003L20IHE,Grady Harp,"[10, 14]","Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick adapted the book for the screen and director Burr Sherwood (known for his other films that are of this genre) stirs the whipped cream.  It is a pretty story with pretty people filmed in a pretty location (British Columbia) and the results are pretty predictable, yet when compared to the types of stories on film that flood the theaters at least this film has gentle heart and a lack of terror and horror and for that we should be pleased.Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron, who holds in own in this rather implausible role) is a highly regarded young sailor who is wins a sailing scholarship to Stanford upon graduation from high school. He is devoted to his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) and his single mother nurse Claire (Kim Basinger - don't blink or you'll miss her very brief appearance in the film).  One night while Claire is on extra shift at the hospital Charlie and Sam are in an auto accident: Sam dies, but Charlie is resuscitated by paramedic  Florio Ferrente (Ray Liotta, in another very brief cameo).  Charlie is devastated over Sam's death and gives up his chances for a life by taking a custodian job in the town cemetery so he can be near a certain spot where he 'sees' and communicates with Sam every sunset - a life long promise to never leave his little brother.  Five years pass and Charlie's friend Alistair (Augustus Prew) - his only other friend Sully (Dave Franco, brother of actor James Franco) has gone into the military - tries to encourage Charlie to date, but Charlie's eyes fall on Tess (Amanda Crew), a fellow sailor from the past, and love begins.  Tess decides to take a long solo voyage in her boat and disappears.  Charlie meets the now cancer-ridden and dying Florio who gives him his St Jude medal and encourages Charlie to embrace life.  Charlie strikes out on a mission to find the missing Tess and the rest is pretty obvious.Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility, the team of actors is very fine - especially Zac Efron, whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame - so the film ends up being endearing.  The cinematography by Enrique Chediak is gorgeous and the musical score by Rolfe Kent leans heavily on sad love songs. It is not a profound film though it does dip gently into the ideas of 'the beyond', but there is something about the honesty of it all that makes it s a satisfying evening of entertainment.

The acting by Zac Efron is really superb and he carries the movie. The first time I saw it I was a little confused with some of the details in the storyline, especially when he keeps talking to dead people, but the second time I saw it a lot of things made more sense.  I think you have to be in the right mood to see it and also there are a lot of details that you notice more during the second viewing. I also felt at first that they were playing on Zac Efron's stunning good looks a little too much with their close up camera shots etc., not that I'm exactly complaining, ha ha, but at first I found that distracted from the touching storyline. The main themes of making the best of second chances, and that if God gave you a second chance to live what would you do with it, really do make you think. It's also about moving forward and leaving your past sorrows behind, as well as a subtle message of not taking your loved ones for granted.  The love story is secondary in some ways as the characters struggle to deal with these issues in their lives.Charlie is a father figure to his younger brother Sam as their father abandoned the family. They do everything together and even won a sailing competition as a team. Charlie promises his brother that he will teach him to play baseball and they agree to practice every day at sundown.  Charlie is left with ""Sam Duty"" and has to babysit his eleven year old brother when their Mom has to work an extra shift. Charlie tries to sneak away when it's dark and when Sam catches him in the act, he winds up taking Sam with him. Sadly, they are then in a tragic car accident caused by a drunk driver and Charlie is devastated when Sam dies.  The plan is that Charlie will put Sam's baseball glove in the casket at the funeral, but when it comes to it he isn't able to bring himself to do it.  He runs away from the funeral and meets Sam's ghost in the woods.  They continue meet to play catch every night and here comes the crunch when Charlie starts to fall in love.  He is faced with the dilemma of choosing Sam's world or moving forward with his new girlfriend Tess also known as ""sailor girl"" who is planning a solo trip around the world.  Charlie works in the graveyard in order to be close to Sam and feels he can't break his promise to his brother.I didn't find this movie predictable, but it contained some inconsistencies or things that may be offensive to some. After the accident Charlie abstains from alcohol and one wonders if this is because of the accident, but later he seems to drink freely.  I found the parts where he sees other ghosts to be a tad confusing at first viewing, but it all made sense later on.  People who have died in the film seem to be in a sort of half-way state when they stay on earth until they are ""ready"" to go on to heaven.  It seems in the story that they choose this time themselves, when they are ready to go. Some are ready to go quickly as Charlie's former classmate who went on to war and others are hesitant to go such as Sam because he wants to stay with Charlie. It's not clear where Sam is when  he isn't with Charlie. Sam does not seem to be aware of people who died, but Charlie's friend tells Charlie he will say hi to Sam for him when he decides to go.  Also, the location of the implied love-making scene will be viewed by some as inappropriate even though it is within ""PG guidelines"".I like the strong Catholic Christian message in the film and although there is some minimal swearing and a few religious exclamations with God's name, the message that God has a purpose for people's lives comes through clearly.  I also like how the paramedic who saved Charlie's life attributed Charlie's second chance to God's intervention. He wore a St. Jude charm around his neck and later we find out that St. Jude is the Saint for desperate or hopeless causes. Charlie learns through his experiences why God gave him a second chance and he is able to apply this same truth that was passed on to him, allowing a miracle to happen.I'd recommend this film for Zac fans, but also people who want a story to think through things on a deeper level.  The last time I went to see the film, on its last day showing here, I was the only person in the theatre which I hope isn't a bad sign as to the movie's popularity.

Thus begins the story of Charlie St. Cloud, a young man who ""stops living"" because he can see dead people and does not want to let go of the memory of his brother.Good Content: Charlie's dedication to Sam (alive and dead) is a good example of being a good brother.  Even when Sam has died, Charlie keeps his promise to Sam.  Later in the film Charlie turns out to be a rational young man as he makes a choice between ""himself"" and another person's life.Spiritual Content: The fact that Charlie can see dead people is not necessarily creepy.  It's more of a psychological thriller than anything.  Charlie and Sam have a conversation about what would happen to Sam if Charlie broke his promise and stopped visiting him.  Sam is concerned he will ""cease to exist"".  Charlie's life was ""saved"" by a paramedic who is a strong Catholic.  Later in life the two meet and the paramedic asks Charlie why he was ""given a second chance to live"" and if he will use this second chance for a good purpose.  The paramedic believes saving Charlie was a heaven-sent act.  He wears a pendant of St. Jude around his neck.Sexual Content: Charlie and his girlfriend Tess spend a night together in the cemetery.  Nothing is seen because the camera cuts out right before anything happens but cuts back in afterwards.  Same tells a few crude jokes (I only got one of them because another audience member was laughing as if it was a dirty joke).Violent Content: We see some aspects of the car crash that Charlie and Sam are in.  We see them while they are in the ambulance-Charlie's face is somewhat bloody.  Charlie gets in a fist fight with another young man.Profanity: a total of about seven or eight profane words ranging from h-- to s--Conclusion: Unnecessary elements (such as the cemetery scene, some language) make this a PG-13 film.  While the idea of the plot seems ""iffy""-a young man spending time with his dead brother-it doesn't really touch on anything spiritual in terms of life and death.  Rather, it is more of a psychological, ""think about it"" film.  Borderline tragedy, chic-flick, drama, this film is recommended for mature audiences who are not opposed to somewhat ""unrealistic"" stories.",4,Zac Efron maturing...,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,2629,"['Overview', 'Charlie', 'younger', 'brother', 'Sam', 'are', 'enjoying', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'summer', 'Charlie', 'college', 'sailing', 'scholarship', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'Sam', 'life', 'lost', 'tormented', 'Charlie', 'life', 'saved', 'Instead', 'going', 'life', 'alone', 'woods', 'working', 'cemetery', 'Why', 'stay', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'brother', 'promises', 'meet', 'day', 'practice', 'baseball', 'Thus', 'story', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'not', 'want', 'let', 'go', 'memory', 'brother.Good', 'Content', 'Charlie', 'dedication', 'Sam', 'alive', 'dead', 'good', 'example', 'being', 'good', 'brother', 'Even', 'when', 'Sam', 'died', 'Charlie', 'promise', 'Sam', 'Later', 'film', 'Charlie', 'out', 'be', 'rational', 'young', 'man', 'choice', 'person', 'life.Spiritual', 'Content', 'fact', 'Charlie', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'not', 'necessarily', 'creepy', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'anything', 'Charlie', 'Sam', 'have', 'conversation', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'broke', 'promise', 'stopped', 'visiting', 'Sam', 'concerned', 'will', 'cease', 'exist', 'Charlie', 'life', 'was', 'saved', 'paramedic', 'who', 'strong', 'Catholic', 'Later', 'life', 'two', 'meet', 'paramedic', 'asks', 'Charlie', 'why', 'was', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'live', 'will', 'use', 'second', 'chance', 'good', 'purpose', 'paramedic', 'saving', 'Charlie', 'was', 'heaven-sent', 'act', 'pendant', 'St.', 'Jude', 'neck.Sexual', 'Content', 'Charlie', 'girlfriend', 'Tess', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'cemetery', 'Nothing', 'seen', 'camera', 'out', 'right', 'anything', 'happens', 'cuts', 'back', 'afterwards', 'Same', 'few', 'crude', 'jokes', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'audience', 'member', 'was', 'laughing', 'was', 'dirty', 'joke', '.Violent', 'Content', 'see', 'aspects', 'car', 'crash', 'Charlie', 'Sam', 'are', 'see', 'are', 'ambulance-Charlie', 'face', 'somewhat', 'bloody', 'Charlie', 'fist', 'fight', 'young', 'man.Profanity', 'total', 'seven', 'eight', 'profane', 'words', 'ranging', 'h', 's', 'Conclusion', 'Unnecessary', 'elements', 'such', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'language', 'make', 'PG-13', 'film', 'idea', 'plot', 'iffy', '-a', 'young', 'man', 'spending', 'time', 'dead', 'brother-it', ""n't"", 'really', 'touch', 'anything', 'spiritual', 'terms', 'life', 'death', 'Rather', 'more', 'psychological', 'think', 'film', 'Borderline', 'tragedy', 'chic-flick', 'drama', 'film', 'recommended', 'mature', 'audiences', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'opposed', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'stories']",N/A

After his younger brother dies in a car crash, Charlie puts his life on hold. His heart may still be beating but he has given up all his dreams and works instead as a cemetery caretaker. His sole joy in life? He meets his (deceased) younger brother every day for a game of catch. He promised he would and he does not want to break his promise for fear that he will truly lose his brother forever. When a beautiful woman comes into his life, he is forced to make a choice between living or holding on to the past.This is an incredibly moving, surprising, life-affirming story. I was riveted by it. It has some very Catholic themes, including a belief in the power of St. Jude and the knowledge that when we die, it is far from the end.

1349550,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B003L20IHE,Steven Carrier,"[3, 6]","Film: Charlie St. CloudDirector: Burr SteersWriters: Craig Pearce, Lewis ColickCast: Zac Efron, Charlie Tahan, Amanda Crew, Kim Basinger, Donal Logue, Ray Liotta, Dave FrancoYear: 2010Charlie St. Cloud is a film that wants to be everything. It wants to be a grief drama. It wants to be a romance. It wants to be film about the bond of brotherhood. It wants to be a film about sailing. It wants to be a supernatural drama. It wants to be a comedy. It wants to be a melodrama. Is Charlie St. Cloud anything of those things: the answer is maybe. Sure all of those elements are present in the picture, but none of them are fully developed to truly connect. Based on the novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood, Charlie St. Cloud misses the sweet, tender nature of the Sherwood's writing and the awe that lays in the center of his novel.The story revolves around Charlie (Zac Efron, Me & Orson Welles), a promising young sailor whose life is put on perpetual hold when he causes the car accident that kills his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan, Nights in Rodanthe). With his mother (Kim Basinger, L.A. Confidential) devastated and leaving town, Charlie, runs off into the woods to encounter Sams ghost, promising him that he will continue playing baseball with him every night at dusk. Years pass and Charlie works at the cemetery where Sam is buried to fulfill his promise, when he meets the beautiful young sailor, Tess (Amanda Crew, Sex Drive). Through that relationship he starts to question that if living a secluded life in ""the in-between"" is really whats best for him or if finally letting go is what he needs to do.As you can tell from the plot of the film, there is a lot going on. The supernatural aspects nearly sink the story into sappy melodrama and quite honestly don't make much sense. The scenes of grief and the effect that Sam's death has on his family, especially, Charlie, are well done but sadly there aren't enough of them to fully resonate. The one aspect of the film that really does connect is that of Charlie and Tess' romantic relationship. It's the strongest plot point until a third acts emotional reveal threatens to destroy the entire structure.Regardless of the scripts schizophrenia, the film is, shockingly, held together by Zac Efron's strong performance. Coming a long way from his work in High School Musical and 17 Again (which was also directed by Burr Steers), Efron is showing real range as an actor. He has the good looks (which the camera relishes) and the charm and charisma to be a true leading man. He creates a very honest and true emotional arch for Charlie and does connect well on screen. The same can be said for Amanda Crew. She has a light and natural screen presence that helps add to the believability of the romance.Since the film never actually picks one genre, the emotional weight of the story is pat. The cinematography is beautiful and Efron's performance is worth a look for sure, but there really is not much else to take away from this, inoffensive, but ultimately uninteresting picture. Younger, undemanding, easily manipulated audience members will certainly take to the film, but anyone looking for an emotionally complex study on grief and family will need to see Ordinary People instead.Rating: C",3,Inoffensive but ultimately pat,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,3285,"['Film', 'Charlie', 'St.', 'CloudDirector', 'Burr', 'SteersWriters', 'Craig', 'Pearce', 'Lewis', 'ColickCast', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Charlie', 'Tahan', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Dave', 'FrancoYear', '2010Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'film', 'be', 'everything', 'be', 'grief', 'drama', 'be', 'romance', 'be', 'film', 'bond', 'brotherhood', 'be', 'film', 'sailing', 'be', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'be', 'comedy', 'be', 'melodrama', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'anything', 'things', 'answer', 'maybe', 'Sure', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'picture', 'none', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'truly', 'connect', 'Based', 'novel', 'Death', 'Life', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'Ben', 'Sherwood', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'sweet', 'tender', 'nature', 'Sherwood', 'writing', 'awe', 'center', 'novel.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Charlie', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'promising', 'young', 'sailor', 'life', 'put', 'perpetual', 'hold', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'younger', 'brother', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Tahan', 'Nights', 'Rodanthe', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'devastated', 'leaving', 'town', 'Charlie', 'woods', 'encounter', 'Sams', 'ghost', 'promising', 'will', 'continue', 'playing', 'baseball', 'night', 'dusk', 'Years', 'pass', 'Charlie', 'cemetery', 'where', 'Sam', 'buried', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'when', 'beautiful', 'young', 'sailor', 'Tess', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'Sex', 'Drive', 'relationship', 'question', 'living', 'secluded', 'life', 'in-between', 'really', 'whats', 'best', 'finally', 'letting', 'go', 'what', 'do.As', 'can', 'tell', 'plot', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'nearly', 'sink', 'story', 'sappy', 'melodrama', 'quite', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'scenes', 'grief', 'effect', 'Sam', 'death', 'family', 'especially', 'Charlie', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'fully', 'resonate', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'really', 'connect', 'Charlie', 'Tess', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'strongest', 'plot', 'point', 'third', 'acts', 'emotional', 'reveal', 'destroy', 'entire', 'structure.Regardless', 'scripts', 'schizophrenia', 'film', 'shockingly', 'held', 'together', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'strong', 'performance', 'Coming', 'long', 'way', 'work', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '17', 'Again', 'was', 'also', 'directed', 'Burr', 'Steers', 'Efron', 'showing', 'real', 'range', 'actor', 'good', 'looks', 'camera', 'charm', 'charisma', 'be', 'true', 'leading', 'man', 'very', 'honest', 'true', 'emotional', 'arch', 'Charlie', 'connect', 'well', 'screen', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'light', 'natural', 'screen', 'presence', 'add', 'believability', 'romance.Since', 'film', 'never', 'actually', 'one', 'genre', 'emotional', 'weight', 'story', 'pat', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'Efron', 'performance', 'look', 'sure', 'there', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'take', 'away', 'inoffensive', 'ultimately', 'uninteresting', 'picture', 'Younger', 'undemanding', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'audience', 'members', 'will', 'certainly', 'take', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'study', 'grief', 'family', 'will', 'need', 'see', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'instead.Rating', 'C']",N/A

One gets tired of blood and gore after awhile and it is refreshing to just lose yourself into a fantasy that ends well for a change.  I thought Amanda Crew was outstanding, even though the film was supposed to revolve around Zac and his brother I do not think that it would have worked at all without her.  She showed emotion but did not overdo it...whereas I thought Efron except in one place did not show hardly any emotion.  Now maybe this was the idea of the film that he was wounded by the loss of his brother and therefor &#34;numb&#34; to life .There were &#34;holes &#34; in the film also.

Once a champion sailor, his brothers' passing left him lost, and with a unique ability to see dead people.  Spending every night playing ball with his dead brother, he denies his future for his past.  A second ghost begins to haunt him as his 'girl', Tess, another sailor, is lost at sea.Charlie, missing his nightly appointment with Sam, says goodbye to his brother while he discovers that to move ahead, he must face the future head on. Relying on the faith in St Jude that the paramedic who saved his life gives him, he heads out to sea and finds Tess barely alive.This is one great movie with a good message.  Zac Efron delivers a strong performance as Charlie and Amanda Crew is a good mesh for the psychologically/psychic challenged sailor.  Each cast member builds into this strong character driven film, and turns this into more of a thriller as opposed to a romance or rite of passage film.Truly, the film shows the maturation of Efron as an actor.

It also features Charlie Tahan, who is one of the biggest up and coming stars around. Charlie St. Cloud also has some awesome cameos and let's face it, Zac Efron was pretty good in 17 again, so I took a chance. Sadly though, even with all the film apparently had going for it, Charlie St. Cloud was a boring flop. The story follows a young man's journey to re-discover himself following a drunk driving accident that claimed the life of his little brother. It's a solid story to build on, but that's just it, it really doesn't go anywhere from there. Charlie is consumed by what happened and even years later spends hours in the woods talking to his brothers ghost. If you watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie, there really all there is to see.
