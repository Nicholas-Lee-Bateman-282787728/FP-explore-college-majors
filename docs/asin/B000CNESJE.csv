959295,A2ZYV16SKIF2C4,B000CNESJE,Buzby J,"[3, 3]",Decent Indy film. There were some things to like but not a lot to dislike. The acting was good throughout most of the cast. The script was nothing special but the relationship between the 2 leads was odd so I guess that's what got my attention.  I put the film on to watch while I was doing something else and it drew my attention to it away from what I was doing.  I'm not sure why but not a lot of films do that. The soundtrack music was catchy too. Its an interesting watch.  I would recommend it.,3,Decent movie..

959299,AOK9WOTHI5I5L,B000CNESJE,"L. Lamb ""Oregon Lamb""","[3, 3]","I'm not into the thriller genre, so I would never have watched this had it not been for Christian Kane. So I ""made the sacrifice"" and watched it to see what I knew was a great scene with Christian and his real life band (at the time, some changes since then)singing in a bar.I was pleasantly surprised! Basically rich boy (Christian Kane), wants to marry good girl girlfriend (Jennifer Westfeldt)and she is not ready. So he pursues. Meanwhile she has casually met Gil Bellows and well... you can figure it out from here. Gil's wife has some interesting hobbies, Christian's father plays a role in the background, and in the end, it works more as a drama than a thriller. Let's say these people are all alive at the end, with all their limbs, something I don't expect from reading the box.Totally worth watching, and triple that if you are a Kane fan. ""Sean Voight"" singing is fantastic.",4,"Interesting movie, much better than expected",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,886,"[""'m"", 'not', 'thriller', 'genre', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'So', 'made', 'sacrifice', 'watched', 'see', 'what', 'knew', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'Christian', 'real', 'life', 'band', 'time', 'changes', 'then', 'singing', 'bar.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Basically', 'rich', 'boy', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'marry', 'good', 'girl', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'not', 'ready', 'Meanwhile', 'casually', 'met', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'well', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'here', 'Gil', 'wife', 'interesting', 'hobbies', 'Christian', 'father', 'role', 'background', 'end', 'more', 'drama', 'thriller', 'Let', 'say', 'people', 'are', 'alive', 'end', 'limbs', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'reading', 'box.Totally', 'worth', 'watching', 'triple', 'are', 'Kane', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Voight', 'singing', 'fantastic']",Keep Your Distance
959300,A2QTKRWFB9216W,B000CNESJE,Madman,"[19, 21]","Keep Your Distance was an engrossing movie dealing with a multitude of relationships.  There is the marriage of two people with very little in common.  A serious relationship between two good looking people who seem to have it all; good looks, a creative and interesting relationship, yet lack the key ingredient: trust.  Between these two relationships come some other minor connection between a notable politician, one of his main supporters, and a fellow employee.Sound confusing? Well, in the beginning it is just a little, but more so it is incredibly enthralling.  Our introduction to the two main characters places them in a situation that portrays them in a less than likable light, but in no time it is revealed who they really are and we can't help but root for them for the remainder of the flick.Through their endeavors we see David Dailey (Gil Bellows) a notable radio talk show host and Melody (Jennifer Westfeldt), a traveling saleswoman for the pharmacy industry, strike up a friendship in which they help each other through difficult times.  The attraction they have to each other is evident but is not fully explored because they are each too busy dealing with their own failing relationships to dive into something new.There are many funny moments to be had in the first two thirds of the film with the last third delving into some more serious situations.  Riveting from beginning to end, we see the progression of all of the relationships come full circle...and then a little more.  While the ending was a bit anti-climatic, this doesn't negate the incredible intertwining stories throughout the majority of the movie and a couple of A+ performances as well.The main flaw of this film is that there is so much plot that it is impossible to fit it into 90 minutes.  Another 90 minutes or so may have been sufficient but the general public probably wouldn't be to keen on a three hour movie (although I certainly would!)  Many of the important events in this are left unexplored yet the main focus, on David and Melody, is where the story begins and ends, as it should be.On Saturday, Oct. 29th, I had the privilege of seeing one of a very few select screenings of the movie Keep Your Distance, written and directed by Stu Pollard.  Keep Your Distance is Stu's second feature length flick, done completely independently.  The budget was between $1-2 million dollars and while this is relatively low by many standards, it doesn't show in the movie at all.  Every scene was very well polished and was complimented by a great soundtrack supplied entirely by bands from Louisville, KY (the writer/directors home town and where the entire movie was shot.)While the movie may not have any ""A-list"" actors, the people they got could not have fit more perfectly.  Especially Westfeldt whose attitude and unique mannerisms provide one of the most down to earth performances I have seen in a while.  Why I have not heard of her until now is beyond me.I highly suggest giving this film a shot.  It's independent status isn't going to get it any reviews from Roger Ebert unless it is picked up by a studio, and it likely won't be coming to a theater near you, so look for it at the video store or just do a blind buy on DVD.  The bonus features alone will be worth it to see how this film was shot for such a modest budget.  Now that I know who Stu Pollard is and know what he has to offer, I can't wait to see what he cooks up next.",4,An awesome movie from this Sophmore director,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,3440,"['Keep', 'Distance', 'was', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'dealing', 'multitude', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'serious', 'relationship', 'two', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'looks', 'creative', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'yet', 'lack', 'key', 'ingredient', 'trust', 'two', 'relationships', 'come', 'other', 'minor', 'connection', 'notable', 'politician', 'one', 'main', 'supporters', 'fellow', 'employee.Sound', 'confusing', 'Well', 'beginning', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'incredibly', 'enthralling', 'introduction', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'places', 'situation', 'less', 'likable', 'light', 'time', 'revealed', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'remainder', 'flick.Through', 'endeavors', 'see', 'David', 'Dailey', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'notable', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Melody', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'traveling', 'saleswoman', 'pharmacy', 'industry', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'help', 'other', 'difficult', 'times', 'attraction', 'have', 'other', 'evident', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'dealing', 'own', 'failing', 'relationships', 'dive', 'something', 'new.There', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'be', 'had', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'last', 'third', 'delving', 'more', 'serious', 'situations', 'Riveting', 'beginning', 'end', 'see', 'progression', 'relationships', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'then', 'little', 'more', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'anti-climatic', ""n't"", 'negate', 'incredible', 'intertwining', 'stories', 'majority', 'movie', 'couple', 'A+', 'performances', 'well.The', 'main', 'flaw', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'impossible', 'fit', '90', 'minutes', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', 'general', 'public', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'keen', 'three', 'hour', 'movie', 'certainly', 'would', 'Many', 'important', 'events', 'are', 'left', 'unexplored', 'yet', 'main', 'focus', 'David', 'Melody', 'where', 'story', 'should', 'be.On', 'Saturday', 'Oct.', '29th', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'select', 'screenings', 'movie', 'Keep', 'Your', 'Distance', 'written', 'directed', 'Stu', 'Pollard', 'Keep', 'Distance', 'Stu', 'second', 'feature', 'length', 'flick', 'done', 'completely', 'independently', 'budget', 'was', '1-2', 'million', 'dollars', 'relatively', 'low', 'many', 'standards', ""n't"", 'show', 'movie', 'Every', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'polished', 'was', 'complimented', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'supplied', 'entirely', 'bands', 'Louisville', 'KY', 'writer/directors', 'home', 'town', 'where', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'A-list', 'actors', 'people', 'got', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'fit', 'more', 'perfectly', 'Especially', 'Westfeldt', 'attitude', 'unique', 'mannerisms', 'provide', 'one', 'most', 'down', 'earth', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'Why', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'now', 'me.I', 'highly', 'suggest', 'giving', 'film', 'shot', 'independent', 'status', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'reviews', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'picked', 'up', 'studio', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'theater', 'so', 'look', 'video', 'store', 'just', 'do', 'blind', 'buy', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'such', 'modest', 'budget', 'Now', 'know', 'who', 'Stu', 'Pollard', 'know', 'what', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'next']",Keep Your Distance

At first, I'll admit, I was very skeptical.  I had images in my mind of another bad low budget movie.  And while the directing was okay, the story was really good, despite being slightly corney and a little confusing in the beginning.  And some great laugh out loud dialogue.Gil Belows (formerly of the tv series Ally McBeal) did a solid job playing a somewhat unhappy radio personality, whose marriage, it turns out, isn't as great as he had thought.  He didn't know this, until he starts receiving these anonymous notes, leaving him little bread crumbs of info.  Enter the his new friend, Melody (the actress who played her did an excellent job), who is going through her own issues with a male suitor.  They both help end up helping each other with their respective issues, and the movie ends with a climactic scene that will have you laughing and scratching your head with a smile.Also his radio assistant, the odd Wit, was an interesting addition (played in Erin Brocovich as the man at the town local Water Board).Good solid movie, a great weekend or lazy sick in bed movie.",3,"Tea: A nice solid flavor, thank you",1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,1220,"['Overall', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'so.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'till', 'saw', 'local', 'tv', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'movie', 'first', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'had', 'images', 'mind', 'bad', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'directing', 'was', 'okay', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'being', 'slightly', 'corney', 'little', 'confusing', 'beginning', 'great', 'laugh', 'loud', 'dialogue.Gil', 'Belows', 'formerly', 'tv', 'series', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'playing', 'somewhat', 'unhappy', 'radio', 'personality', 'marriage', 'out', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'had', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'receiving', 'anonymous', 'notes', 'leaving', 'little', 'bread', 'crumbs', 'info', 'Enter', 'new', 'friend', 'Melody', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'who', 'going', 'own', 'issues', 'male', 'suitor', 'help', 'end', 'up', 'helping', 'other', 'respective', 'issues', 'movie', 'climactic', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'scratching', 'head', 'smile.Also', 'radio', 'assistant', 'odd', 'Wit', 'was', 'interesting', 'addition', 'played', 'Erin', 'Brocovich', 'man', 'town', 'local', 'Water', 'Board', '.Good', 'solid', 'movie', 'great', 'weekend', 'lazy', 'sick', 'bed', 'movie']",Keep Your Distance
