Ever wonder how big a 6 pound burrito is? How bout a 6 pound burger slapped with a side order of 6 pounds of french fries? Maybe you and a buddy wondered if you could split that 12 pound Carnivore pizza between the 2 of you? Or maybe just chowing down on a dozen chicken wings coated with a half pound of pure habenero chili powder abstract is more your thing?! No matter what the hottest or most plentiful dish your city is famous for this guy is on his way to try and beat it.This show truly is Man Vs Food and it honestly is fantastic entertainment! I only give it 4 stars becuz its just not meant for deep philosphical discussion. Conversationa will generally consist of ""Holy Cr*p that burgers freakin HUGE!!"" and ""That curry is so spicy his lips are blistered!!"" All and all a great show and a blast to watch. Hurry and watch it before this guy dies on us!!",4,This is a such a great show,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,988,"['got', 'ta', 'love', 'guy', 'who', 'states', 'accepting', 'most', 'outrageous', 'food', 'challenges', 'wonderful', 'country', 'offer', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'how', 'big', '6', 'pound', 'burrito', 'How', '6', 'pound', 'burger', 'slapped', 'side', 'order', '6', 'pounds', 'french', 'fries', 'Maybe', 'buddy', 'wondered', 'could', 'split', '12', 'pound', 'Carnivore', 'pizza', '2', 'maybe', 'just', 'chowing', 'down', 'dozen', 'chicken', 'wings', 'coated', 'half', 'pound', 'pure', 'habenero', 'chili', 'powder', 'abstract', 'more', 'thing', 'matter', 'what', 'hottest', 'most', 'plentiful', 'dish', 'city', 'famous', 'guy', 'way', 'try', 'beat', 'it.This', 'show', 'truly', 'Man', 'Vs', 'Food', 'honestly', 'fantastic', 'entertainment', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'becuz', 'just', 'not', 'meant', 'deep', 'philosphical', 'discussion', 'Conversationa', 'will', 'generally', 'consist', 'Holy', 'Cr*p', 'freakin', 'HUGE', 'curry', 'so', 'spicy', 'lips', 'are', 'blistered', 'great', 'show', 'blast', 'watch', 'Hurry', 'watch', 'guy']",N/A

Adam Richman goes from state to state and trys different food challenges. I have no idea how this guy isn't dead or 500 lbs but that's a different story. The set comes with 20 epsiodes presented in widescreen and a beautiful crystal clear picture. When you open the dvd up, it features a brief synposis of the epsiodes. It was very convenient to find the epsiode I wanted to watch where he eats that massive pizza. I do however notice more I watch the more annoying Richman can get or it seems like he is forcing himself to say he likes the food. He does not have the same omph like Guy Ferria (or however you spell it) but I still enjoy this program.",5,Man Vs.

I looked forward to watching this show and for the most part I enjoyed it. Adam travels to different cities throughout the U.S. to see how much grub he can stomach.A couple of things bring the enjoyment level down a bit for me. For one, Richman tends to be an over-flatterer(and I realize a lot of these food host people embellish their opinions a bit) and it gets a bit annoying seeing him fawning over something that doesn't even look that good..which takes me to point two. Some of the places/food he showcases look pretty disgusting in my opinion.I do enjoy the eating challenges though, some of which I would like to try myself. The 2nd DVD also includes deleted scenes, TV spots, World's Best Places to Pig Out for 68 mins of extra material.
