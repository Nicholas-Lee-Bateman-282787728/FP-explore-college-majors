I have seen seen at least one other movie where Santa Claus loses his memory and I think this was done better. The family doesnt come together until literaly brought together because theyre to busy.The son seems to be the only one who cares about Christmas for a while until it becomes clear that the parents busy schudles are affecting his older sister too.The bag of presents is accidently sent away to a charity drive.And the daughter doesnt believe the guy is Santa Claus until his head elf tells her what she wanted for Christmas when she was seven.

Now, I realize that this is a holiday movie and anything goes in the land of make believe; however, I just feel that there were too many details within the story that just didn't add up or were just left out out of incompetence and sloppiness.First of all, the story takes place two days before Christmas in a cold climate setting but you wouldn't know it by some of the outdoor scenes, it looked more like the fall season as I couldn't help noticing that all the trees still had most of their leaves, some were green and some had already changed to the fall colors, there were leaves everywhere on the ground (they could have at least raked the leaves before they shot the outdoor scenes) and you could clearly see that more leaves were falling from the trees while the movie was going on. I feel that this was an important detail that they clearly missed and a distraction to the story. The other issue that I have with this story, is that the couple let's a total stranger in a  Santa Claus suit that crashed into their house sleep on their couch and they let their kids interact and go out with this character because they're too busy with their jobs although they don't believe that he's really Santa. Is that really a good idea? Wow, now that's what I call a responsible parent!There were some funny parts and also the actor that played the elf (I can't think of his name, sorry) was very good.

He takes up residence at a disjointed, not really in the spirit of Christmas, family led by the ever watchable Jennifer Beals.  His chief elf(not from 'Elf'), nicely played by Jordan Prentice, works with the family to try to help Santa get it together in time for you know what.The family is too tied up in their work and own affairs to appreciate the meaning of the season and each other.  Finding their way to togetherness in mildly amusing  ways is the predictable nature of this made for TV flick.Our kids liked the reindeer but were quick to say, ""That's not how Santa really is.""  Perhaps his slight accent, lack of more jolliness(of course, he did lose his memory) and lack of more rotundness dampened their review.It's clean and well meaning but not super funny or novel.
