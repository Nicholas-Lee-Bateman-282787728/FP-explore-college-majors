(see my review.)I am not usually a big fan of combination pianist/conductor set-ups, but in this repertoire, I much prefer this version to the Barenboim set, good as it is.Buchbinder plays with a much lighter touch than Barenboim, and seems more whimsical.The tempi are considerably quicker. Plus you don't have to watch Barenboim mopping up his perspiration every few bars!  I really enjoyed #'s 1 & 3 here more than I usually do, due to his playing sensibilities. I've always been fond of #'s 2 & 5, but I still don't love #4. Buchbinder plays and conducts without a score, a sign of his knowing these concerti inside out. (I'm always skeptical of pianists that need a score in performance.) There just seems to be so much joy in his playing, and this infectiousness is evident in the orchestra members as well.What can you say about the Vienna Phil. and Beethoven? They are inseparable, Every bar is in their blood.You will hear details in the score you have not previously heard - some of this due to a slightly scaled-down orchestra (only four basses). The sound quality in DTS-MASTER AUDIO is immaculate, both for piano and orchestra.The video is outstanding also - using unusual camera angles from behind and above the orchestra to show the pianist's keyboard technique.There is a short interview with Buchbinder and Dr.Joachim Kaiser that delves into the differences in the original and newer editions of the scores - showing mistakes that were made in the copying and hence performance errors - fascinating stuff!I bought this disc from Amazon UK (available earlier and cheaper than Amazon USA) If you buy discs from them, they show them at 17.99 pounds, but when you check out it reduces to 14.99. Even with a cost of $5 shipping, with the current exchange rate, this means you get a bluray for $29 delivered. If you buy multiples, your shipping cost is much reduced. Bear in mind, too, that you get over 3 hrs. of glorious music on one bluray disc!To sum up, absolutely indispensable and a screaming bargain to boot!",5,"excellent in performance, sound and video",1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,2141,"['be', 'worthwhile', 'companion', 'bluray', 'disc', 'recent', 'outstanding', 'Thielemann', 'Beethoven', 'symphony', 'set', 'see', 'review', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'big', 'fan', 'combination', 'pianist/conductor', 'set-ups', 'repertoire', 'much', 'prefer', 'version', 'Barenboim', 'set', 'good', 'plays', 'much', 'lighter', 'touch', 'Barenboim', 'more', 'whimsical.The', 'tempi', 'are', 'considerably', 'quicker', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'Barenboim', 'mopping', 'up', 'perspiration', 'few', 'bars', 'really', 'enjoyed', '1', '3', 'here', 'more', 'usually', 'do', 'due', 'playing', 'sensibilities', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fond', '2', '5', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', '4', 'Buchbinder', 'plays', 'conducts', 'score', 'sign', 'knowing', 'concerti', ""'m"", 'always', 'skeptical', 'pianists', 'need', 'score', 'performance', 'just', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'playing', 'infectiousness', 'evident', 'orchestra', 'members', 'well.What', 'can', 'say', 'Vienna', 'Phil', 'Beethoven', 'are', 'inseparable', 'Every', 'bar', 'blood.You', 'will', 'hear', 'details', 'score', 'have', 'not', 'previously', 'heard', 'due', 'slightly', 'scaled-down', 'orchestra', 'only', 'four', 'basses', 'sound', 'quality', 'DTS-MASTER', 'AUDIO', 'immaculate', 'piano', 'orchestra.The', 'video', 'outstanding', 'also', 'using', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'orchestra', 'show', 'pianist', 'keyboard', 'short', 'interview', 'Buchbinder', 'Dr.Joachim', 'Kaiser', 'differences', 'original', 'newer', 'editions', 'scores', 'showing', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'copying', 'hence', 'performance', 'errors', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'bought', 'disc', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'available', 'earlier', 'cheaper', 'Amazon', 'USA', 'buy', 'discs', 'show', '17.99', 'pounds', 'when', 'check', '14.99', 'Even', 'cost', '5', 'shipping', 'current', 'exchange', 'rate', 'get', 'bluray', '29', 'delivered', 'buy', 'multiples', 'shipping', 'cost', 'much', 'reduced', 'Bear', 'mind', 'too', 'get', '3', 'hrs', 'glorious', 'music', 'one', 'bluray', 'disc', 'sum', 'up', 'absolutely', 'indispensable', 'screaming', 'bargain', 'boot']",Beethoven Piano Concertos
1497285,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B005PU97FO,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[0, 1]","Absolutely marvelous performance by Rudolf Buchbinder, playing the five Beethoven piano concertos and directing the Vienna Symphony Orchestra at the same time. This performance must be SEEN, not just heard. Buchbinder conducts with his eyes, eyebrows, head movements, and his hands, when free. Unblemished, rapturous rendition of all five concertos, although the Third and Fifth are my favorites. The glamorous interiors of the Vienna Orchestra Hall add to the feast of the eyes, the camera movement gives the performance added dimension which will not be captured from a static position in the audience, and if you have the right Blu-ray equipment, you are in for a rare treat.",5,Absolutely Marvelous!,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,678,"['Absolutely', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Rudolf', 'Buchbinder', 'playing', 'five', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'concertos', 'directing', 'Vienna', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'same', 'time', 'performance', 'must', 'be', 'SEEN', 'not', 'just', 'heard', 'Buchbinder', 'eyes', 'eyebrows', 'head', 'movements', 'hands', 'when', 'free', 'Unblemished', 'rapturous', 'rendition', 'five', 'concertos', 'Third', 'Fifth', 'are', 'favorites', 'glamorous', 'interiors', 'Vienna', 'Orchestra', 'Hall', 'add', 'feast', 'eyes', 'camera', 'movement', 'performance', 'added', 'dimension', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'static', 'position', 'audience', 'have', 'right', 'Blu-ray', 'equipment', 'are', 'rare', 'treat']",Beethoven Piano Concertos
1497286,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B005PU97FO,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[6, 13]","The biggest problem with the performance is the soloist is also the conductor here. Although the WP is the no doubt the best orcheastra in the world, without a real conductor the musicians play gingerly and cautiously, so the effect is more like chamber music rather than orchestral music. Beethoven, being the unmatched visionary that he was, composed the concertos, especially the last three, for large orchestras (yes, one can argue whether that's really true, but IMHO he did exactly that), so here it's really frustrating to hear, and watch, the conductor-less WP musicians play more like students trying to pass the exam. And it's evident from the video that they are not really paying much attention to Buchbinder's conducting.Buchbinder's solo playing is as fine as ever, even at age 65, and the expression he brings to the table is top-notch. But I still find his overall playing too academic, as opposed to someone like Lang Lang who just wants to steal your heart like pop stars. Buchbinder is not as precise as Kempff, which is good or bad depending on your taste, but Buchbinder is quite (evident from the bonus video) adament about playing Beethoven ""right""; the problem, of coruse, is no two Beethoven specialists agree what this ""right"" means.Overall an enjoyable program. The camera work is okay but oddly, it does not focus on the pianist at the beginning of the first movement of the fifth concerto, which is very disconcerting, because everyone loves to watch how a pianist does the three showy cadenza-like flourishes. Worse, the movement's video starts with a super-wide shot, dimishing the impact of the sonorous tutti chords. Again, the playing here is quite restrained, which is not what I like, but the sound is beautiful.Of the few Beethoven piano concerto-on-video recordings, I do recommend this one over the others. The Blu-ray quality is excellent. The bonus interview with Joachim Kaiser, a Beethoven piano works specialist, is interesting but ultimately has too many putdowns on ""other"" pianists.",3,"Soloist too academic, orchestra played more like chamber music",1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,2029,"['biggest', 'problem', 'performance', 'soloist', 'also', 'conductor', 'here', 'WP', 'doubt', 'best', 'orcheastra', 'world', 'real', 'conductor', 'musicians', 'play', 'gingerly', 'cautiously', 'effect', 'more', 'chamber', 'music', 'rather', 'orchestral', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'being', 'unmatched', 'visionary', 'was', 'composed', 'concertos', 'especially', 'last', 'three', 'large', 'orchestras', 'yes', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'really', 'true', 'IMHO', 'did', 'exactly', 'so', 'here', 'really', 'frustrating', 'hear', 'watch', 'conductor-less', 'WP', 'musicians', 'play', 'more', 'like', 'students', 'trying', 'pass', 'exam', 'evident', 'video', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'Buchbinder', 'conducting.Buchbinder', 'solo', 'playing', 'as', 'fine', 'ever', 'even', 'age', '65', 'expression', 'table', 'top-notch', 'still', 'find', 'overall', 'playing', 'too', 'academic', 'opposed', 'someone', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'who', 'just', 'steal', 'heart', 'pop', 'stars', 'Buchbinder', 'not', 'as', 'precise', 'Kempff', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'taste', 'Buchbinder', 'quite', 'evident', 'bonus', 'video', 'adament', 'playing', 'Beethoven', 'right', 'problem', 'coruse', 'two', 'Beethoven', 'specialists', 'agree', 'what', 'right', 'enjoyable', 'program', 'camera', 'work', 'okay', 'oddly', 'not', 'focus', 'pianist', 'beginning', 'first', 'movement', 'fifth', 'concerto', 'very', 'disconcerting', 'everyone', 'watch', 'how', 'pianist', 'three', 'showy', 'cadenza-like', 'flourishes', 'Worse', 'movement', 'video', 'super-wide', 'shot', 'dimishing', 'impact', 'sonorous', 'tutti', 'chords', 'Again', 'playing', 'here', 'quite', 'restrained', 'not', 'what', 'like', 'sound', 'few', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'concerto-on-video', 'recordings', 'do', 'recommend', 'one', 'others', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'interview', 'Joachim', 'Kaiser', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'works', 'specialist', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'too', 'many', 'putdowns', 'other', 'pianists']",Beethoven Piano Concertos
1497287,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B005PU97FO,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This series of recordings was made in the Golden Hall in Vienna with the VPO in 2011 and were clearly much enjoyed by the audience. As Buchbinder is a frequent performer in Austria and in Vienna, it is likely that he would be a very familiar figure to Viennese concert goers. They would therefore probably have chosen to attend the concert in the expectation of enjoying a performance of a pianist with whom they would be artistically familiar. Their enthusiasm is therefore easily understood and is largely justified.The predominant impression gained when experiencing this set of performances by Buchbinder is that of affection. This is apparent in every note or phrase that is played, by his interaction with members of the orchestra and also in his whole stage manner which is immensely genial and likeable.What about the musical detail? Buchbinder has made an incredibly thorough study of these concertos as he explains in the fascinating bonus documentary. This has led him to collect considerable numbers of editions of all of these works including the first editions in Beethoven's own hand. In doing this he has found numerous discrepancies between editions, even in first editions following on from Beethoven's original manuscripts.Essentially these editorial discrepancies have frequently deleted many of Beethoven's instructions concerning phrasing, tempi changes and dynamics. Those instructions amount to subtleties of expression which imply more freedom than that allowed by a strict classical approach. Buchbinder maintains that by restoring these instructions, the player has to be more expressive than is often the case and is therefore nearer to Beethoven's original intentions. This makes an interesting challenge to some of the 'authentic' instrument options currently available which are often wary of interpretive expressiveness.In case this should concern the listener, it should be firmly stated that these changes, although important, do not radically change what would be expected. More importantly it should be noted that these performances, although more flexible and featuring a modern orchestra of fair size, still have bite as required. Energy is apparent throughout as well as a lightness of touch which underlines Beethoven's frequent enjoyment in rhythmic interplay. This is a truly excellent set of the concertos and the engrossing accompanying documentary makes everything that Buchbinder does absolutely clear and completely justified.The recording maintains the excellence we have come to expect of C Major and provides crisply detailed imaging without being invasive plus excellent DTS surround sound.This is an outstanding issue to compare with that by Barenboim, also on DVD and Blu-ray and should give considerable pleasure. However, for those who would prefer a more dramatically rigorous approach to these works I would suggest that the equally satisfying Barenboim set would be worth considering as an alternative choice.Nevertheless, this set could easily be considered by many as the leading contender in this field and well worth serious consideration as a potential purchase.",5,An outstanding set of these Beethoven concertos,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,3125,"['series', 'recordings', 'was', 'made', 'Golden', 'Hall', 'Vienna', 'VPO', '2011', 'were', 'clearly', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'audience', 'Buchbinder', 'frequent', 'performer', 'Austria', 'Vienna', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'figure', 'Viennese', 'concert', 'goers', 'would', 'therefore', 'probably', 'have', 'chosen', 'attend', 'concert', 'expectation', 'enjoying', 'performance', 'pianist', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'artistically', 'familiar', 'enthusiasm', 'therefore', 'easily', 'understood', 'largely', 'justified.The', 'predominant', 'impression', 'gained', 'when', 'experiencing', 'set', 'performances', 'Buchbinder', 'affection', 'apparent', 'note', 'phrase', 'played', 'interaction', 'members', 'orchestra', 'also', 'whole', 'stage', 'manner', 'immensely', 'genial', 'likeable.What', 'musical', 'detail', 'Buchbinder', 'made', 'incredibly', 'thorough', 'study', 'concertos', 'fascinating', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'led', 'collect', 'considerable', 'numbers', 'editions', 'works', 'including', 'first', 'editions', 'Beethoven', 'own', 'hand', 'doing', 'found', 'numerous', 'discrepancies', 'editions', 'even', 'first', 'editions', 'following', 'Beethoven', 'original', 'manuscripts.Essentially', 'editorial', 'discrepancies', 'have', 'frequently', 'deleted', 'many', 'Beethoven', 'instructions', 'concerning', 'phrasing', 'tempi', 'changes', 'dynamics', 'instructions', 'amount', 'subtleties', 'expression', 'imply', 'more', 'freedom', 'allowed', 'strict', 'classical', 'approach', 'Buchbinder', 'restoring', 'instructions', 'player', 'be', 'more', 'expressive', 'often', 'case', 'therefore', 'nearer', 'Beethoven', 'original', 'intentions', 'interesting', 'challenge', ""'authentic"", 'instrument', 'options', 'currently', 'available', 'are', 'often', 'wary', 'interpretive', 'expressiveness.In', 'case', 'should', 'concern', 'listener', 'should', 'be', 'firmly', 'stated', 'changes', 'important', 'do', 'not', 'radically', 'change', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'More', 'importantly', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'performances', 'more', 'flexible', 'featuring', 'modern', 'orchestra', 'fair', 'size', 'still', 'have', 'bite', 'required', 'Energy', 'apparent', 'as', 'well', 'lightness', 'touch', 'Beethoven', 'frequent', 'enjoyment', 'rhythmic', 'interplay', 'truly', 'excellent', 'set', 'concertos', 'engrossing', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'everything', 'Buchbinder', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'completely', 'justified.The', 'recording', 'excellence', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'C', 'Major', 'crisply', 'detailed', 'imaging', 'being', 'invasive', 'excellent', 'DTS', 'surround', 'sound.This', 'outstanding', 'issue', 'compare', 'Barenboim', 'also', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'should', 'give', 'considerable', 'pleasure', 'However', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'more', 'dramatically', 'rigorous', 'approach', 'works', 'would', 'suggest', 'equally', 'satisfying', 'Barenboim', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'considering', 'alternative', 'choice.Nevertheless', 'set', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'many', 'leading', 'contender', 'field', 'well', 'worth', 'serious', 'consideration', 'potential', 'purchase']",Beethoven Piano Concertos

Excellent interpretations of both piano and orchestra, and both of them are conducted such as to compliment with each other beautifully.  Buchbinder was perhaps a bit too spritely when he played the piano for his previous Mozart piano concertos on DVD, but here his performance of the piano parts of beethoven's concertos are superiorly well nuanced.  The Steinway he was playing on also gave out rich bass sounds, which are crucial for bringing out the atmosphere of the third movement of the fifth concerto.Particularly well done was the first movement of the fourth piano concerto, which is perhaps the most difficult of all of beethoven's piano concertos for which to play the piano part with balanced nuances and also to complimentarily blend both piano and orchestra parts together.  This movement is fiendishly subtle and is very easy to perform with imperfections of interpretive balance!  But here this movement is interpreted with excellent balance and nuance, so Buchbinder passed the test here with high marks.All the concertos are excellently performed.

The orchestra, conducted by Mr. Buchbinder from the piano, is rock solid and is a perfect partner in the kind of music making that Mr. Buchbinder excels.  As for the soloist himself, his touch is both tender and purposeful, and his phrasing evocative and contemplative.  There is a feeling of truth and correctness to the performance of each piece, a sense - if you will - that this is how things were intended to be conveyed.  It is very, very difficult to do anything else but keep your eyes and ears glued to the music making.The DVD contains an interview between Mr. Buchbinder and Joachim Kaiser that is both interesting and informative.  The discussion of changes present in the first publication of one of Beethoven's scores vs. the contents of a facsimile of the original manuscript is fascinating, and demonstrates the degree of seriousness and preparation that Mr. Buchbinder places on himself as the interpreter of these very special works.This DVD is incredible.
