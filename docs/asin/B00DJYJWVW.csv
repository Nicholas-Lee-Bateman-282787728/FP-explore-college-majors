The way some reviewers complain you'd think this movie wasn't half what the old Clayton Moore/Lone Ranger TV/ movie(?) bits were- it's better! Silly, full of &#34;impossible in the real world&#34; action? All here but there decades ago too- find an old rerun and see for yourself. 2013's &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; is what the old days would've done with a similar budget & technology.Ignore the 1 Star reviews and give it a chance. All you have to do is remember  it's &#34;fun&#34; not &#34;reality&#34; (I doubt the producers of either era ever meant to make a &#34;great&#34; western). I'll certainly be watching it for the loads of detail (lot of effort obviously put into the production) and the wonderful scenery- the story really isn't that bad either.I really mean it, give this one a chance, the story has silly details but a lot of good elements too- and &#34;the look&#34; is &#34;as good&#34; as any &#34;real Western&#34; that I remember seeing.Don't bother with the DVD only option, you'll get only the movie, bloopers, subtitling and closed captioning. Amazon should make it clear that in the DVD/Blu ray combo the Blu ray has bloopers, a deleted scene and three featurettes;1. Riding The Rails of The Lone Ranger- Learn what it takes to film one of the most epic train chases of all time.2. Armie's Western Road Trip- Hit the trail with Armie Hammer as he wades through rivers, battles dust storms, and shares what it's like to shoot in the film' spectacular and historic American Southwest locations.3,Becoming A Cowboy- How do you turn a bunch of greenhorn actors into gunslingers? Send them to Cowboy Boot Camp to learn how to rope, ride, shoot&#8230;and stop a horse on a mark.It costs just a few dollars more than the DVD alone and should be worth the extra cost to anyone who has, or will have, a Blu ray player.",4,"The movie is fun to watch, Amazon should make clear that extras are on the Blu ray",1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1957,"[""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'way', 'reviewers', 'complain', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'what', 'old', 'Clayton', 'Moore/Lone', 'Ranger', 'TV/', 'movie', 'were-', 'better', 'Silly', 'full', '34', 'impossible', 'real', 'world', '34', 'action', 'here', 'there', 'decades', 'too-', 'find', 'old', 'rerun', 'see', '2013', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'what', 'old', 'days', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'similar', 'budget', 'technology.Ignore', '1', 'Star', 'reviews', 'give', 'chance', 'have', 'do', 'remember', '34', 'fun', '34', 'not', '34', 'reality', '34', 'doubt', 'producers', 'era', 'ever', 'meant', 'make', '34', 'great', '34', 'western', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'be', 'watching', 'loads', 'detail', 'lot', 'effort', 'obviously', 'put', 'production', 'wonderful', 'scenery-', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either.I', 'really', 'mean', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'story', 'silly', 'details', 'lot', 'good', 'elements', 'too-', '34', 'look', '34', '34', 'good', '34', '34', 'real', 'Western', '34', 'remember', 'seeing.Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'DVD', 'only', 'option', ""'ll"", 'get', 'only', 'movie', 'bloopers', 'subtitling', 'closed', 'captioning', 'Amazon', 'should', 'make', 'clear', 'DVD/Blu', 'ray', 'combo', 'Blu', 'ray', 'bloopers', 'deleted', 'scene', 'three', 'featurettes', '1', 'Riding', 'Rails', 'Lone', 'Ranger-', 'Learn', 'what', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'train', 'chases', 'time.2', 'Armie', 'Western', 'Road', 'Trip-', 'Hit', 'trail', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'rivers', 'battles', 'dust', 'storms', 'shares', 'what', 'shoot', 'film', 'spectacular', 'historic', 'American', 'Southwest', 'locations.3', 'Becoming', 'Cowboy-', 'How', 'do', 'turn', 'bunch', 'greenhorn', 'actors', 'gunslingers', 'Send', 'Cowboy', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'learn', 'how', 'rope', 'ride', 'shoot', '8230', 'stop', 'horse', 'mark.It', 'just', 'few', 'dollars', 'more', 'DVD', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'extra', 'cost', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'Blu', 'ray', 'player']",The Lone Ranger

1656033,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B00DJYJWVW,Adam,"[7, 16]","The Lone Ranger tries. It's a weird film, which is refreshing, but the poor pacing almost kills it. The story follows greenhorn John Reid as he stumbles through adventures with Tonto, a crazy Native American on a decades-long mission to hunt down a deranged, cannibalistic criminal.It deconstructs the original story with the aim of getting in as much cynicism as possible: John believes in preserving all lives, even the villians', not because he's risen above those who don't, but because he's too inexperienced to know better.  The idea of making Tonto crazy works well for Tonto's personality, in my opinion, since it neatly avoids the stereotype of a mystic, halting-English-speaking Native American, while still providing with one. But the mask, the silver bullet, and the phrase `kimosabi' are all bestowed on Reid by Tonto due to the character's slightly crazy nature and the fact that the two don't get along well at first. The source material is spoofed, essentially. The cynicism is a little strong, particularly at the end. Instead of a rousing call for the Lone Ranger's way, Tonto yells as Rein for trying to use the phrase ""Hi-ho, Silver, away!"" Even Pirates of the Caribbean ended with Jack singing his pirate song, followed by awesome theme music.The poor pacing is the film's major problem, though. I could easily forgive cynicism if it were accompanied by a driving plot. Instead, the film meanders through its two and a half hour runtime, setting up an intricate plot that connects Tonto's back story with both the evil criminal and a railroad magnate. This would be a great plot if it were fun to watch all the time, but too much of it is slow, boring, and attempts to be serious. There's no point to plenty of it, and it seems like a bunch of set pieces -- a brothel, a barn, an indian camp -- without enough reason to justify their existence. It's like all the Pirates sequels, which makes sense, considering it boasts the same writers.The two big action scenes, both involving trains, were very well-done. Tonto's antics were the best part of the film to watch, but they were sadly few and far between. Armie Hammer did a great job acting as Reid, too. If only the inevitable sequel(s) were to be written by someone with an eye for a fast-paced, relevant plot and more appreciation for the decency of the heroes, we could have a great film. Buuut that's never going to happen.I would have given this 4 stars, since it's pretty entertaining, but after thinking it over, I realized that I would be letting it off too easy. It can be fun, sure, but movies are supposed to hold together as a whole more than they have been over the last few years.",3,"Some fun action, but too much slow, serious, unneeded content.",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2667,"['Lone', 'Ranger', 'weird', 'film', 'refreshing', 'poor', 'pacing', 'almost', 'story', 'greenhorn', 'John', 'Reid', 'adventures', 'Tonto', 'crazy', 'Native', 'American', 'decades-long', 'mission', 'hunt', 'down', 'deranged', 'cannibalistic', 'criminal.It', 'original', 'story', 'aim', 'getting', 'as', 'much', 'cynicism', 'possible', 'John', 'preserving', 'lives', 'even', 'villians', 'not', 'risen', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'too', 'inexperienced', 'know', 'better', 'idea', 'making', 'Tonto', 'crazy', 'well', 'Tonto', 'personality', 'opinion', 'neatly', 'stereotype', 'mystic', 'halting-English-speaking', 'Native', 'American', 'still', 'providing', 'one', 'mask', 'silver', 'bullet', 'phrase', 'kimosabi', 'are', 'bestowed', 'Reid', 'Tonto', 'due', 'character', 'slightly', 'crazy', 'nature', 'fact', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'first', 'source', 'material', 'spoofed', 'essentially', 'cynicism', 'little', 'strong', 'particularly', 'end', 'Instead', 'rousing', 'call', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'way', 'Tonto', 'Rein', 'trying', 'use', 'phrase', 'Hi-ho', 'Silver', 'away', 'Even', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'ended', 'Jack', 'singing', 'pirate', 'song', 'followed', 'awesome', 'theme', 'music.The', 'poor', 'pacing', 'film', 'major', 'problem', 'could', 'easily', 'forgive', 'cynicism', 'were', 'accompanied', 'driving', 'plot', 'Instead', 'film', 'meanders', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'runtime', 'setting', 'up', 'intricate', 'plot', 'Tonto', 'back', 'story', 'evil', 'criminal', 'railroad', 'magnate', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'plot', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'slow', 'boring', 'attempts', 'be', 'serious', 'point', 'plenty', 'bunch', 'set', 'pieces', 'brothel', 'barn', 'indian', 'camp', 'enough', 'reason', 'justify', 'existence', 'Pirates', 'sequels', 'sense', 'considering', 'same', 'writers.The', 'two', 'big', 'action', 'scenes', 'involving', 'trains', 'were', 'very', 'well-done', 'Tonto', 'antics', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'watch', 'were', 'sadly', 'few', 'far', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'Reid', 'too', 'only', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'were', 'be', 'written', 'someone', 'eye', 'fast-paced', 'relevant', 'plot', 'more', 'appreciation', 'decency', 'heroes', 'could', 'have', 'great', 'film', 'Buuut', 'never', 'going', 'happen.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'thinking', 'realized', 'would', 'be', 'letting', 'off', 'too', 'easy', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'sure', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'hold', 'together', 'whole', 'more', 'have', 'been', 'last', 'few', 'years']",The Lone Ranger

Instead this film goes in the opposite direction and offers up fare that is more akin to the camp fun of Adam West's Batman. It is a disappointment. The Lon Ranger does have some good moments and I enjoyed the work of Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer. However despite the obvious hard work the story and screenplay simply let them down. The actions sequences are a mess; at times gratuitously over the top and at others something of a yawn. The train sequence which represented the grand finale was straight out of the cartoons - I almost expected a guest appearance from Dick Dastardly or the Road Runner.A remake of the Lone Ranger needs a good deal more imagination than went into this film; We live in dark times where corporate corruption, bought politicians and expedience are ascendant - what better time than now to re-invent the Lone Ranger? Sadly this film is a waste of a golden opportunity. The Lone Ranger should've been re-imagined to the current day; instead we got a camp, awkward and at times discordant slapstick version of the original.However I'm giving the film 3 stars simply because it is watchable, light entertainment.

It's just that this is a really, really bad movie.Tonto is insane. He is a caricature here that deeply disrespects Native Americans.  He was driven insane and now he &#34;trades&#34; taking valuable things and swapping them for garbage when the owner is not looking.  He keeps his dead pet bird mounted on his head and periodically tries to feed it.  That's not funny.  It's just sad.  He's not likable.  He's mean and it's disrespectful to the original Lone Ranger story.  Tonto was useful, intelligent, and ...even kind in the original Lone Ranger. This Tonto is heartless.Also the &#34;new&#34; meaning for Ke-mo sah-bee is just cruel.  &#34;Wrong brother&#34; is constantly telling him &#34;Your brother should have lived and not you&#34; even after they become friends.  That's not funny.  That's mean spirited.Tonto's behavior through the whole thing, insane or not, did not sit right for me.  He bashed the hero's head with a shovel when he started to wake up after the deaths of the rangers and had no qualms about burying a man a live.  And then after a horse (yes, a horse) persuades him to help the lone ranger he drags the man's body, deliberately through horse droppings.  (Ha freakin' ha.)  And the joke is addressed later when the hero smells his own stinky hair.Tonto calls the villain a Windigo which isn't even from the Right native American tribal folk belief.  Windigo is of the North East folk belief, the complete opposite side of the continent!  Skin walker would have been more acceptable.  Someone mixed up Skin walker (yee naaldlooshii) and didn't think anyone would notice.  Whatever happened to the promise that this version would be more respectful of Native American culture?Helena Bonham Carter shows up as a madam with an artificial leg that is actually a gun.  Did I mention the villain likes to mutilate people and or eat human body parts?  Because... You totally need that in a Disney film.It's like watching Tim Burton's spouses run a muck.There's a ridiculous scene where a boy throws The Lone Ranger a silver bullet from the speeding train and he catches it, one handed, while on horse back.  And they never properly explain that those silver bullets are used to represent how valuable life is and The Lone Ranger's promise not to kill but only wound and only in self-defense from the original stories.  He also never drank or smoked either.  Oh, yes, and he also ends up the love interest of his dead brother's widow here, only days after his brother's death...So you see, those that think The Lone Ranger failed because people don't like Westerns anymore have it wrong.  It's not that we can't like Westerns.  It's just that this is a bad, bad movie.  Watch the old black and white ones, they're free on Hulu and surprisingly more respectful to Native Americans...",1,It's not that people don't like Westerns...

We had a great time.  In fact, judging from the reactions of the packed house, everyone there was having a great time.Johnny Depp was, in my opinion, wonderful as a slightly edgy Tonto.  His comedic and dramatic timing were right on target, and his interpretation of Tonto -- as he was written for this movie -- was well done.  The same can be said for Armie Hammer in the lead role.  We watched his character evolve into The Lone Ranger in a remarkably believable manner.  The character was definitely different when compared at the beginning and ending of the movie.  We thought that the concept of Silver, and from where he came, was creative and added well to the story.  There was a LOT of laughter, cheering and even some booing (at the villains).  The line between the good guys and the bad guys was boldly drawn in the desert sand, and the audience reacted well.  There were tragic parts that were so sad that I could have heard a pin drop.Was it a cinematic masterpiece?  No.Were there overly long, boring parts?  Yes, two to be exact.Was the love story epic?  Nope.Were some parts predictable?  Yes.Was the movie true to the '50's tv show?  No... and thank goodness.  It was clearly not meant to be identical to the series, instead trying to bring a new twist to an old favorite.  I think it paid homage in a grand fashion, and stayed true to itself at the same time.Basically, if you like movies that have light-hearted humor, sarcasm, some (somewhat brutal) violence, good vs evil, and two pleasing-to-the-eyes heroes, then this is an enjoyable 2+ hours.

Even the dullest of wits recognize the update of A TALE of the CHRIST(Ben Hur)presented toup-lift the Remnant during the overt manifestations of THE TRIBULATION sweeping the world (and the scene of Clark Kent pleading with the Catholic(Father)priest about what he should do with Zod and the enemies of humanity seeking to destroy him and the world(before the massive stain glass window depiction of Christ's Agony in the Garden the night of his betrayal/""trial"" and subsequent Crucifixion)leaves little to the imagination about what is being posed.However,the second epic, THE LONE RANGER,is more ironic,subtle and ingeniously thought-provoking. Why?Let's start with the role of Johnny D...He is seeking ""the warrior who has passed to the other side; and returned...never again to die...as THE GREAT WARRIOR to restore Justice and THE BALANCE in( a blatantly perverted)Order of Nature(Check-out REVELATION/THE APOCALYPSE Book 6:2; 6:10;6:15-17).""

He is coming back home to the West. He meets bad guys and believes that they can be reasoned with without weapons. As he learns better he is assisted on how the world works by a strange Indian dressed up as a medicine man; we learn his name is Tonto (Johnny Depp.) John Reid learns that you cannot trust old friends; you cannot change old loves, and sometimes force needs to be matched with cunning. Eventually John Reid should become the Lone Ranger that we all came to expect.The characters are where the dichotomy lies. Instead of being a loyal sidekick Tonto leads a world of his own which includes his own agenda and personality explanation. John Reid even though quoting Locke starts off more as a version of Dudley Do-Right. Even his horses smarter just as Dudley's horse was smarter. I think they might have drawn a little on Dudley for some of the scenes.Saginaw Grant plays a pivotal role as Chief Big Bear. He fills in the Back-story Tonto's life, explains what the story is all about, and does the right thing in handling the future of John Reid and Tonto.If you come to this movie with no expectations and appreciate Johnny Depp's sense of humor, then you will have a good time watching this movie.If you get most DVD versions then there will be an extra ""making of"" section that can add to the understanding of what they are trying to present.",4,Do not expect Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1558,"['story', 'mostly', 'told', 'flashback', 'old', 'Indian', 'standing', 'diorama', 'dead', 'crow', 'head.John', 'Reid', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'nave', 'counselor', 'trained', 'East', 'think', 'John', 'Locke', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'West', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'reasoned', 'weapons', 'better', 'assisted', 'how', 'world', 'strange', 'Indian', 'dressed', 'up', 'medicine', 'man', 'learn', 'name', 'Tonto', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Reid', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'old', 'friends', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'old', 'loves', 'sometimes', 'force', 'needs', 'be', 'matched', 'cunning', 'Eventually', 'John', 'Reid', 'should', 'become', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'came', 'expect.The', 'characters', 'are', 'where', 'dichotomy', 'Instead', 'being', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'Tonto', 'world', 'own', 'own', 'agenda', 'personality', 'explanation', 'John', 'Reid', 'even', 'quoting', 'Locke', 'off', 'more', 'version', 'Dudley', 'Do-Right', 'Even', 'horses', 'smarter', 'just', 'Dudley', 'horse', 'was', 'smarter', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'drawn', 'little', 'Dudley', 'scenes.Saginaw', 'Grant', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Chief', 'Big', 'Bear', 'Back-story', 'Tonto', 'life', 'what', 'story', 'right', 'thing', 'handling', 'future', 'John', 'Reid', 'Tonto.If', 'come', 'movie', 'expectations', 'appreciate', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'sense', 'humor', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie.If', 'get', 'most', 'DVD', 'versions', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'extra', 'making', 'section', 'can', 'add', 'understanding', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'present']",The Lone Ranger

It has action, and very humorous, deadpan scenes that one comes to expect out of Johnny Depp. His take on Tonto does remind a bit of the tipsy pirate but who knows, maybe he is one of Jack's ancestors. (Why not, The Mad Hatter seemed to be Willy Wonka's orange haired second cousin.) But again this is not necessarily a bad thing, as fans of Jack will find his Tonto to be an old kemosabe.They are NOT the same of course...the character has his own unique quirks as well.But this is not your father's Lone Ranger.  There is a masked man, a cowboy and an Indian with the names Tonto and Lone Ranger, and some horses but that's where the similarities end.It is a movie, meant to be enjoyed and entertain for a few hours, and it does this.  It is a very enjoyable film despite what the critics say.Now I want to say a few words about peoples' opinion of Tonto.  Those who claim that it is wrong of Johnny Depp to play an Indian, unfortunately aren't aware of the fact that he's more Cherokee than white.  He was well received and was dubbed an honorary Commanche and had the blessing of many of the tribes.  The film's proceeds helped many Native American children receive a quality education that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten.  This movie deserves ten stars for that principle.Johnny has played a Native American before.  (In the film he co-wrote, directed and starred in, &#34;The Brave&#34;.  Unfortunately very few people have been fortunate enough to have seen it.)  With that said, the critics who like to nitpick about that have missed the whole point entirely.  This is a fun movie,and  it's very funny.  While a few scenes are tedious and drawn out, they aren't awful.Die hard Johnny Depp fans will of course want to add this one to their collection.  Since it was shot on location in several western and southwestern states, the scenery is breathtaking and beautiful, especially in high definition. It is a film that sadly didn't do as well in theaters as it could have, simply because critics and reviewers had their minds made up to dislike it before they got a chance to even see it.  (A few recanted after they saw it.) They were determined to hurt this film before it got out of the starting gate.  It is a highly misjudged film.Just get a snack and sit back and enjoy it.

Johnny Depp was in the Jim Jarmusch film Dead Man. The Lone Ranger is a masterpiece and Depp seems to have brought along many elements from that film to this one. I loved the Lone Ranger. It's five stars ALL the way. I viewed it on Direct TV. I wish I had bought the disc. I guess that I will. Five stars is not enough. Dead Man is also a masterpiece. You will recognize it after the Lone Ranger. It's more serious. I also recommend Heaven's Gate for a thoroughly serious examination of yet more things for Americans to be ashamed of. All three of these movies have a character in common... the railroad, trains. Pretty good stuff for those who like rails. Lone Ranger is a wonderful gift to those of us who absorbed the radio program. If you like stories of the west... these three are great. There are such horrid bad guys in the Lone Ranger... I'm not sure what age is okay. I guess maybe at age 12 it's time to learn some ugly truth if you have not started already. Kids must know a lot of horror worse than this after all.

Depp and Verbinski were the magical team on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and magic they have made again. ""The Lone Ranger"" is the story of strait-laced lawyer, John Reid(Armie Hammer), who becomes a symbol of justice, thanks to Native American Tonto...and a white horse. In 1933, a young boy in cowboy clothes enters a wild-west museum, and strikes up a chat with an ancient Indian mummy...who talks. Old Tonto tells him about his experience as a child, when his tribe was wiped-out by two evil white men looking for treasure. The experience disturbs Tonto for the rest of his life. He walks through the desert wearing a dead-crow hat, which he talks to, and feeds seeds. Tonto and John Reid survive a train ambush, and meet Butch Cavendish and his gang, who killed Reid's brother. Along the way, their adventures include phony Camanches, a white spirit horse, and crashing locomotives. Well-timed humor, Monument Valley in Utah, and a reverence for old Westerns is everywhere, along with scenes stolen from ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Searchers"", and even ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Meek lawyer John Reid becomes transformed, as he gets hurt, but remains unharmed. As Tonto says: ""You are one who has been to the other side and returned; you cannot be killed.

1656128,A672SQEY05LPN,B00DJYJWVW,Buddy Love,"[7, 26]","The Lone Ranger is inappropriate for kids, and presents Tonto the Pretentious Indian, for $250 million. Johnny Depp's ancestry is well-documented and it's online for all to see, he has absolutely no native ancestry. Johnny Depp is a Pretendian, or Faux Indian, which is an actor or actress of non-Native American descent who plays a Native American on the screen or stage. The Indian princess syndrome, is mostly exhibited by white people, but some blacks are guilty of it also. Johnny Depp has no real knowledge of Native culture and issues, both historical and factual. He claims to be 1/4 Native American but can't offer any DNA proof, after being told by a senile relative that it's (Cherokee of course).Depp said that he is part Native American in 2011; Quote: I guess I have some Native American in me somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek. Unquote: The Lone Ranger and Tonto will ride into obscurity, as the biggest calamity of 2013. Tonto went from being a Pottawatomie tribesman, into an undignified warrior who's supposedly a Comanche. Tonto is very problematic because, Comanche warriors would never befriend the Texas Rangers, who were deputized to eliminate them. Tonto's painted face and crow head-dress, is a drawing of the imagination, by painter Kirby Sattler, of a non-existent person. Kirby sells prints of native people, while stereotyping them as degrading individuals. Kirby has no regard for historical accuracy, and says that the images came from his imagination.Tonto is a creature of the imagination also, with a crow carcass on his head. Johnny Depp put on encrusted makeup to lessen the obvious, a white man wearing  face paint, to impersonate a Native. The Comanche never painted their faces, and did not practice animal spirit superstition. Tonto's war-paint, and his obscure warrior garb, would have rendered him useless in fighting outlaws. Tonto wouldn't fit the image of someone enlisted, to help fight lawlessness. Tonto and The Lone Ranger would never have been invited, or allowed to freely travel about during that era. The Lone Ranger's outfit, mask, and hat is over-sized, it does not have that perfectly clean and tailored look that Clayton Moore was known for. Also Clayton Moore wore a clean blue shirt, spandex-like blue pants, worn at the ends inside his stylish boots. He never wore a sheriff's badge on a heavy coat, with scuffed up dusty boots. The Lone Ranger looks like a masked outlaw, unshaven, and unconvincing, with his dirty clothes on.",1,"Tonto, A Pretentious Indian, Called A Pretendian!",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2663,"['Lone', 'Ranger', 'inappropriate', 'kids', 'presents', 'Tonto', 'Pretentious', 'Indian', '250', 'million', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ancestry', 'well-documented', 'online', 'see', 'absolutely', 'native', 'ancestry', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Pretendian', 'Faux', 'Indian', 'actor', 'actress', 'non-Native', 'American', 'descent', 'who', 'Native', 'American', 'screen', 'stage', 'Indian', 'princess', 'syndrome', 'mostly', 'exhibited', 'white', 'people', 'blacks', 'are', 'guilty', 'also', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'real', 'knowledge', 'Native', 'culture', 'issues', 'historical', 'factual', 'be', '1/4', 'Native', 'American', 'ca', ""n't"", 'offer', 'DNA', 'proof', 'being', 'told', 'senile', 'relative', 'Cherokee', 'course', '.Depp', 'said', 'part', 'Native', 'American', '2011', 'Quote', 'guess', 'have', 'Native', 'American', 'somewhere', 'line', 'great-grandmother', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'Native', 'American', 'grew', 'up', 'Cherokee', 'maybe', 'Creek', 'Indian', 'Makes', 'sense', 'terms', 'coming', 'Kentucky', 'rife', 'Cherokee', 'Creek', 'Unquote', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'will', 'ride', 'obscurity', 'biggest', 'calamity', '2013', 'Tonto', 'went', 'being', 'Pottawatomie', 'tribesman', 'undignified', 'warrior', 'who', 'supposedly', 'Comanche', 'Tonto', 'very', 'problematic', 'Comanche', 'warriors', 'would', 'never', 'befriend', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'who', 'were', 'deputized', 'eliminate', 'Tonto', 'painted', 'face', 'crow', 'head-dress', 'drawing', 'imagination', 'painter', 'Kirby', 'Sattler', 'non-existent', 'person', 'Kirby', 'prints', 'native', 'people', 'stereotyping', 'degrading', 'individuals', 'Kirby', 'regard', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'images', 'came', 'imagination.Tonto', 'creature', 'imagination', 'also', 'crow', 'carcass', 'head', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'put', 'encrusted', 'makeup', 'lessen', 'obvious', 'white', 'man', 'wearing', 'face', 'paint', 'impersonate', 'Native', 'Comanche', 'never', 'painted', 'did', 'not', 'practice', 'animal', 'spirit', 'superstition', 'Tonto', 'war-paint', 'obscure', 'warrior', 'garb', 'would', 'have', 'rendered', 'useless', 'fighting', 'outlaws', 'Tonto', 'would', ""n't"", 'fit', 'image', 'someone', 'enlisted', 'help', 'fight', 'lawlessness', 'Tonto', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'invited', 'allowed', 'freely', 'travel', 'era', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'outfit', 'mask', 'over-sized', 'not', 'have', 'perfectly', 'clean', 'tailored', 'look', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'was', 'known', 'Also', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'wore', 'clean', 'blue', 'shirt', 'spandex-like', 'blue', 'pants', 'worn', 'ends', 'stylish', 'boots', 'never', 'wore', 'sheriff', 'badge', 'heavy', 'coat', 'scuffed', 'up', 'dusty', 'boots', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'masked', 'outlaw', 'unshaven', 'unconvincing', 'dirty', 'clothes']",The Lone Ranger

Despite this, the series brought in over a billion dollars for Disney studios and the last two movies actually made more than the far superior original. Knowing Hollywood and knowing this, I assumed that ""The Lone Ranger"" would be the same because they would assume that the incohesive, poorly plotted style actually worked. That couldn't be further from the truth.At times, ""The Lone Ranger"" changes its tone, switching from action to drama to comedy, but ultimately it always returned to the one thing that brought it all together in the end; the fun. There's a comic book, cartoonish feel to ""The Lone Ranger"" that I found strangely rewarding. Some of the moments in the movie are over-the-top and exactly what you would expect from a summer blockbuster. It's okay though for two reasons:  first of all, it's okay because The Lone Ranger is essentially Dudley-Do-Right in human form and second of all, the movie is actually a story being told by an elderly Tonto and we all know that stories being told about legends, especially old west legends have their share of embellishments.Johnny Depp's, Tonto is actually really good, even though from time to time his voice is a little too legible, bouncing back and forth between Indian and Depp. Armie Hammer's, John Reid aka The Lone Ranger is equally well done, although Tonto certainly steals the show most of the time. Another thing I was worried about was that I like my westerns to feel western. It did, thanks to William Fichtner's Butch Cavendish and the rest of his evil-doing gang. That may have been the thing I like the most about the movie was that it wasn't at all like the awful ""Wild Wild West"". It was an authentic western with trains, dust, shootouts with accurate guns and damsel in distress. It felt exactly like the 50's Lone Ranger that it was supposed to be portraying; the same Ranger all the kids dreamed of being.""Ranger"" is a little long in the middle and you can tell when the ending is coming like all the other summer blockbuster special effect heavy movies because you can see where the studio invested their money. All in all though, despite predictability and some unevenness here and there, ""The Lone Ranger"" is a blast of a western to enjoy at the movie theater.

I'll try to keep this short and to the point...ProsHighly EntertainingWonderfully FilmedVerbinski's signature all over itGrittier than expectedConsBloated run timeDebatable castSome narrative problemsThe real point here is, is The Lone Ranger is the remake/re-imagining we didn't really expect or need.  That being said, this is not a bad film.  Gore Verbinski knows how to make a film and how to make a film well.  I personally loved all three of his contributions to the Pirates series.  Sure, he tends to get a little long winded and off the mark sometimes (At World's End) but, this doesn't detract too much from the fact that the film is entertaining.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great versatility but, could possibly be miscast here (this seems to happen from time to time) but, he makes due and tries his best to hold it together.

1656173,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B00DJYJWVW,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[21, 49]","Legendary English comic Tony Hancock did a bit where he was trying out for HAMLET.  He came in on a crutch, with a parrot on his shoulder, and proceeded to recite lines from HAMLET in the pirate accent of Robert Newton's Long John Silver.  When the director challenged him, Hancock defended his portrayal as ""his interpretation.""The point is, you can only stretch an interpretation so far before you lose the character.I looked forward to this ""Lone Ranger"" especially since the 1981 movie was simply awful.  I certainly liked the fact that they gave him a new look.  I wondered why the Lone Ranger in the old comic strip wore black trousers and a red shirt, when all the Lone Ranger artifacts I saw when I was growing up had him in blue.  Then I listened to the radio version.  The point of the Lone Ranger is that he can slip off his mask and blend in with the crowd.  I doubt he would have blended in very well in the old west in a tight, powder-blue suit.Unfortunately, the movie began stretching the interpretation of the character. Naturally, they always have to go back through the creation of the Lone Ranger, just as they always have to retell the story of any other action hero from scratch in every new revamp.  As always, the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger goes to join his brother with the Texas Rangers.  Pursuing an outlaw, the rangers are ambushed and the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger is the sole survivor.  Thus, the Lone Ranger, get it?  As always, he is rescued by a lone Indian named Tonto and, for whatever reason, the two become more or less vigilantes, tracking down those who evade justice by other means.  But they are not bounty hunters, as the Lone Ranger and Tonto stumbled on a silver mine of their very own (where the Lone Ranger makes his own bullets) which gives him the economic freedom to pursue the causes of justice without having to take sordid bounties.In this version, the fellow who becomes the Lone Ranger is a dim bulb, coming out west with books (somehow, being well-read is always a minus).  Don't think Jimmy Stewart in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.""  This lunkhead is far further down the intellectual ladder.  It's as if the filmmakers believe reading somehow saps ones intelligence.  So much for education.Of course, Tonto was always the street-smart, savvy fellow who shows the young Lone Ranger the ins and outs of the west.  So even there they are sticking to the typical storyline.But no one seems to know how to write for heroic men anymore.  For centuries storytellers have taken imperfect men and fashioned heroes who tackled evils  greater than themselves.  This has not only fallen out of fashion, it's a forgotten art.The tone of the movie is uneven.  We get low-brow comedy stooping to poop jokes.  Ha ha.  Then we get unbelievable violence, more becoming the grimmer spaghetti westerns.  But the filmmakers have no ideas how to adjust the tones, or mitigate either the stupid comedy or the graphic violence.Then there is the take on America.  We expect modern filmmakers to mock religion, and those who have it are either fools, or hypocritical ratbag villains.  Again, there is no middle point.  Why not leave it out if you have nothing useful (or new) to say about it?  The most religious person in the film is probably Tonto, who sees ""spirits"" in everything, but he is mocked by his own people for that -- perhaps that's why Tonto always seems to be an outcast, a ""Lone"" who takes up with the Ranger because no one else wants him.Also ridiculed are the Lone Ranger's scruples.  The point of the Lone Ranger is that he was striving for justice in a world where there was no justice.  The high standards he set for himself made him unfit for society, and he became more like an anchorite monk, striving for an ever higher good that he might never reach, but which was at least worth reaching for.And what did the original Lone Ranger strive to reach for?  Generally, the same ideas as founded the nation.  From a list of Lone Ranger values combined one one of his co-creators, Fran Stryker, are ""That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world"" and ""being prepared physically, mentally, and morally to fight when necessary for what is right"" and ""God put the firewood there, but that every man must gather and light it himself"" and ""all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.""  But what do you do with such a character when you no longer believe in a truth (not a ""this"" truth or a ""that"" truth, but a truth at all?)You do what's popular with your leftist friends.  The trend is, of course, bashing everything American.  We expect the American military, which stamped out slavery in this country, and went abroad to stamp out Hitler and free Concentration Camps, to be considered evil.  Everyone in the military is Custer.  And the bad guys, of course, are working for the greatest evil in the world, American Big Business (in this case, railroad ""barons"").  It's all the sort of thing Hollywood prides itself on, and awards, taking stands that are somehow ""brave"" even though they don't know anyone who disagrees with them.  It's how movies are written and made these days, sheer conformity.  And it's too bad it's coming out in the Disney imprimatur because Walt Disney believed in the freedoms and in the justice of America's founding documents.But it's not merely peer pressure and doctrinaire Hollywood thinking that makes them bash America so much that when they play the ever vibrant ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" it has sinister overtones.  The fact is, that corporate town Hollywood, forever bashing corporations and businesses, is one of the biggest money-grubbing businesses ever (and always has been), has always made lots of its moolah by selling films abroad, where they can't seem to make movies like we can with good old American know-how.  Look again at grosses in America versus grosses worldwide.  When European markets for ""decadent"" American films were cut off by Hitler ruling Europe from the Atlantic to the Russian border, Hollywood decided to replace that loss of revenue by directing their films south of the border and promoting stars like Ricardo Montalban and Carmen Miranda.  Needless to say, foreigners who live in countries that have never understood or lived under American freedoms, and envy the American lifestyle until they have an irrational bigotry for all things American, welcome anything that makes America, and its freedoms and justice, look foolish.Therefore, what is funny to the filmmakers is not situations involving the Lone Ranger, but rather the Lone Ranger's ideals, which they consider anachronisms.  They've long ago thrown out any idea that there can ever be a truth of any kind, thereby cutting off all dialogue with other points of view.  Then goes the conceptof justice, which the Lone Ranger is there to right (after all, filmmakers live in a cockeyed view of the American Justice system where everyone in prison is an innocent victim of ""the system"" but anyone who gets off is obviously guilty -- this plays big into the sensibilities, and will make money, from any nation without habeas corpus).  And the idea of Constitutional self-government and freedom is held up as stupid, too.  Because the Founders of America didn't snap their fingers and six thousand years of unfreedom suddenly didn't change overnight but American had to keep working to iron out kinks, means the whole concept of freedom, and government by the people, is something to ridicule.Trying to make a movie about the Lone Ranger, and then mocking everything he was created to stand for, showing how hollow it is, is like putting Long John Silver into the role of Hamlet.  Why didn't they just make up their own Lone Rangeresque character and make a mockery of him.Oh, I said I liked the change of the Lone Ranger costume.  It's funny they made him black, since the original radio Lone Ranger was really a knock-off imitation of another of my favorite heroes, Zorro.  They've basically turned the Lone Ranger a stupid Zorro in a white Stetson rather than a black gaucho hat. It's just another indication of how shallow is Hollywood's imagination these days, yet it's marketed by the studio that at one time had the greatest imagination of all.",1,Don't give them your

It's either an action-adventure reboot of the classic television and radio serials whose tender, dramatic moments drag it down, or its a dramatic comedy whose action moments take away from its story. The film's plot hits the ground running in the first ten minutes, then drags on endlessly for the next eighty. In spite of this, it's not half as bad as the bad reviews make it out to be.Johnny Depp, a target of most of the bad hype surrounding the film, is surprisingly in top form. However, at times it seems like Captain Jack Sparrow is walking around in the wild west with a crow on his head, rather than Jim Reid's faithful partner. In addition to this, Depp's presence is so overwhelmingly commanding that he often drowns out the ""main"" character, played by Armie Hammer. Speaking of Hammer, his portrayal of Jim Reid is a little shaky. Reid starts the movie as a lawyer, who is later deputized as a Texas Ranger. Being a DA in the late 1800s, Reid has very little experience with the actual enforcement of the law, including firing a gun. His origin story (taken at face value rather than compared to the vast number of television and radio episodes) is interesting to see unfold.The movie's story, both the big and the small, have little contradictions that seem as if they were put there for the sole purpose of seeing if the audience is paying attention. The story is being told to a young boy by Tonto, who is found in a carnival exhibit of the old west in 1933, a good 60 years after it happened. Yet there are many parts of the story for which Tonto himself was not present, including at least a few hours he was unconscious. As he begins his story, he makes a trade for the boy's peanuts in a red and white bag. Later in the film, he trades the red and white bag to a man he buried in the 1890s.In spite of everything, as long as you keep your expectations low and don't think too hard about the little contradictions, you will walk away somewhat satisfied.",3,"Not as bad as the reviews claim, not as good as it could have been",1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,2029,"['can', 'understand', 'how', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'got', 'bad', 'reviews', 'action-adventure', 'reboot', 'classic', 'television', 'radio', 'serials', 'tender', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'drag', 'down', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'action', 'moments', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'film', 'plot', 'ground', 'running', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'then', 'endlessly', 'next', 'eighty', 'spite', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'bad', 'reviews', 'make', 'be.Johnny', 'Depp', 'target', 'most', 'bad', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'top', 'form', 'However', 'times', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'walking', 'around', 'wild', 'west', 'crow', 'head', 'rather', 'Jim', 'Reid', 'faithful', 'partner', 'addition', 'Depp', 'presence', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'commanding', 'often', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'Speaking', 'Hammer', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'Reid', 'little', 'shaky', 'Reid', 'movie', 'lawyer', 'who', 'later', 'deputized', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Being', 'DA', 'late', '1800s', 'Reid', 'very', 'little', 'experience', 'actual', 'enforcement', 'law', 'including', 'firing', 'gun', 'origin', 'story', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'rather', 'compared', 'vast', 'number', 'television', 'radio', 'episodes', 'interesting', 'see', 'unfold.The', 'movie', 'story', 'big', 'small', 'have', 'little', 'contradictions', 'seem', 'were', 'put', 'there', 'sole', 'purpose', 'seeing', 'audience', 'paying', 'attention', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'young', 'boy', 'Tonto', 'who', 'found', 'carnival', 'exhibit', 'old', 'west', '1933', 'good', '60', 'years', 'happened', 'are', 'many', 'parts', 'story', 'Tonto', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'including', 'least', 'few', 'hours', 'was', 'unconscious', 'story', 'trade', 'boy', 'peanuts', 'red', 'white', 'bag', 'Later', 'film', 'red', 'white', 'bag', 'man', 'buried', '1890s.In', 'spite', 'everything', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'little', 'contradictions', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'somewhat', 'satisfied']",The Lone Ranger

But after his Texas Ranger brother is killed in an ambush, Reid finds himself paired with a mysterious Comanche outcast named Tonto.  Together, the two will fight to bring corruption to its knees, and a band of murders to justice.Let's get two things out of the way up front.  1) THE LONE RANGER isn't nearly as bad as the critics and Box Office would have you believe.  Not hardly.  Rumor has it, critics reviewed an early cut of the film months before release.  Can't say if that's true or not, of course, but it's worth considering.  2)  Pay attention, parents: this is a PG-13 film, but barely.  There are overt references to prostitution, cannibalism, racism, butchery, and questionable romantic liaisons (Reid's crazy for his brother's wife).  Not to mention the moral questions the film raises, and frequent violence.  I'm no prude when it comes to what I think kids should watch, but even I hesitate to call this a &#34;family friendly film.&#34;Okay, that aside: THE LONE RANGER is actually a pretty good film.  It's overlong by 30 minutes or so, and features a godawful framing device that actually interrupts the narrative at points.  And there's little reason for Johnny Depp's Tonto to be so over-the-top; the film tries explaining it (to a degree), and while interesting, it doesn't offer much.  But beyond that, we've got a handful of great performances: Depp manages to be both dramatic and subtle; Armie Hammer proves he can be a leading man, with enough talent and charisma to draw you into the character; the ever-reliable Tom Wilkinson doing his usual; William Fichtner as a cannibalistic lunatic; and smaller roles filled out marvelously by Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, and Barry Pepper.  Director Gore Verbinski delivers high-octane action, set against stunning scenery and incredible effects.  Remember how refreshing and fun the first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was?  This isn't quite on that scale, but it's close.Ultimately, give THE LONE RANGER a chance.  Is it a classic?  No.  But it's surprisingly dark and edgy, and looks pretty damn good.

The Q-Man has made a second career of promoting obscure or misunderstood films so I bit and I'm glad I did.  I don't know why this film laid an egg because it's terrific.  What director Gore Verbinski has done in 149 minutes is fashioned a Ranger (Armie Hammer) for the new millennium by giving him a plausible backstory.  Tonto, always the Ranger's monosyllabic sidekick, is fleshed out by Johnny Depp and given dimension that the character was never afforded before no offence to the late great Jay Silverheels.  Hammer and Depp have a terrific rapport with Depp doing a lot of improvising.  There's a terrific story involving the Ranger's nemesis Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and a corrupt railroad magnate(Tom Wilkinson).

I still don't know and apparently I am not alone. Those of us old enough to remember &#34;the real&#34; Lone Ranger and Tonto had to hate this film.Those who aren't old enough, had to be confused about the premise of the film. Why was the movie called the &#34;Lone Ranger&#34; when &#34;Tonto&#34; apparently was the lead in the movie, with a dead bird on his head that he kept feeding? Why was the &#34;Lone Ranger&#34; such a clutch? And to top it off, the smartest one in the film was the Lone Rangers Horse &#34;Silver&#34; who seemed to have supernatural powers and the ability to fly. He was always somewhere you don't expect a horse to be. You know like on top of a moving train.Apparently the committee that made this movie must have seen The Green Hornet and thought that was a good idea, even though it bombed as well. The only reason the bomb wasn't bigger was because the budget was smaller. In fact the only movie in recent memory that was worse than The Lone Ranger, was that horrible Green Hornet franchise killer as well. Ironically both created by the same writer, who actually had the two related; John Reed as the Ranger and Britt Reed as the Hornet. Man they must have really hated that guy to kill off two of the best characters he ever created. This movie really set &#34;sidekicks&#34; back.This film recently made #1 in a top ten list of the worse bombs of 2013, losing over 200 million as word of mouth kept people away in droves. My girlfriend is still pissed at me because she didn't want to see it, and I convinced her it would be good. It will be years before I get my rep back in picking movies.Bottom line: The acting is stiff. The story is a mis-mash of history, and a woman with a false leg with a gun built into it. The Ranger is a dumb lawyer whose brother has his heart eaten by the principle bad guy, Tonto is no Jack Sparrow, while there is a graphic bloody slaughter of Indians right in the middle of the film for reasons unknown. (Yeah I said Indians). But after the &#34;bad cowboy&#34; cuts the heart out of the &#34;good&#34; cowboy and eats it for reasons unknown, I guess all bets are off.Save your money.

I thought Kevin Costner's movie ""Dances With Wolves"" changed that practice.  I was wrong.  Disney claimed that using Johnny Depp as Tonto offered the best chance for financial success.  Of course they were wrong.  They forgot that a good script was the foundation for a successful movie.  Their attitude that a real Native American would limit their revenue was simply put: Racism - pure and simple!  I used to subscribe to a Native American magazine that tried to justify the Johnny Depp-as-Tonto decision.  They asserted that a movie providing Native American actors ""work"" was better than no movie at all.  Damn poor excuse for racism in the 21st century.  I went to the see this movie on the big screen in hope that it may have some social redeeming value and/or a bit of real Native American history.  Growing up in the 50s watching the Lone Ranger & Tonto on the small screen, I was hoping for best.Like movies in the 20th century it portrayed Native Americans as both brave and stupid.  The scene showing the Native Americans charging into horrific gatlin gun fire reminded me of real-life atrocities such  as the Wounded Knee and Sand Creek massacres.  That scene in this plot-thin (western version of Pirates of the Caribbean) movie served absolutely no purpose except, maybe, providing work for Native American actors.  Being a Johnny Depp fan but the son of a reservation-born Native American, I couldn't have been more disappointed in this movie.  Pray with me that no sequels come of this racism.

1656267,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00DJYJWVW,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 2]","One can understand where director Gore Verbinski wanted to go with this movie.  Rather than pay homage to the television and film series of the past, he wanted to use the story to make a comment on the status of Native Indians, and how their cultures were brutally extinguished by the seemingly endless tide of 'progress,' symbolized by the railway.  In this new world of capitalism, concepts of 'good' and 'evil' didn't really hold sway; money was all that mattered.  This helps to explain why Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) wield such power in this world.  The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) and Tonto (Johnny Depp), might still be able to right wrongs, and restore some kind of moral order, but their influence on the wider picture is negligible.  They represent a long-departed world of honor, good fellowship and justice - values that simply do not exist in the capitalist world-view.  However many of these very important thematic points are lost in a film which is structurally a mess; it doesn't know whether it is trying to be a comedy, an historical drama, an hommage to the television series, or all three.  The plot meanders along at a snail's pace, and although there are some spectacular CGI-generated sequences, the characterization remains at a superficial level. Depp gives his usual flashy performance as Tonto; one might argue that it is a good example of mimicry, prompting us to ask why the role was not played by a Native Indian.  Hammer is colorless as the Lone Ranger; in truth, Depp might have been better suited to this role.  Wilkinson gives his usual scene-stealing role as the bad guy, although he is really only reprising the role of Pecksniff from MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT, with an American accent added.",2,"Good Intentions, But Poorly Executed",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1760,"['One', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'wanted', 'go', 'movie', 'Rather', 'pay', 'homage', 'television', 'film', 'series', 'past', 'wanted', 'use', 'story', 'make', 'comment', 'status', 'Native', 'Indians', 'how', 'cultures', 'were', 'brutally', 'extinguished', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'tide', ""'progress"", 'symbolized', 'railway', 'new', 'world', 'capitalism', 'concepts', ""'good"", ""'evil"", 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'sway', 'money', 'was', 'mattered', 'explain', 'why', 'Latham', 'Cole', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Butch', 'Cavendish', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'wield', 'such', 'power', 'world', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'Tonto', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'right', 'wrongs', 'restore', 'kind', 'moral', 'order', 'influence', 'wider', 'picture', 'negligible', 'represent', 'long-departed', 'world', 'honor', 'good', 'fellowship', 'justice', 'values', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'capitalist', 'world-view', 'However', 'many', 'very', 'important', 'thematic', 'points', 'are', 'lost', 'film', 'structurally', 'mess', ""n't"", 'know', 'trying', 'be', 'comedy', 'historical', 'drama', 'hommage', 'television', 'series', 'three', 'plot', 'meanders', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'are', 'spectacular', 'CGI-generated', 'sequences', 'characterization', 'superficial', 'level', 'Depp', 'usual', 'flashy', 'performance', 'Tonto', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'good', 'example', 'mimicry', 'prompting', 'ask', 'why', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'played', 'Native', 'Indian', 'Hammer', 'colorless', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'truth', 'Depp', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'Wilkinson', 'usual', 'scene-stealing', 'role', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', 'only', 'reprising', 'role', 'Pecksniff', 'MARTIN', 'CHUZZLEWIT', 'American', 'accent', 'added']",The Lone Ranger

Thurlow,"[28, 36]","With ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski and actor Johnny Depp on the job, no one should have expected 2013's ""The Lone Ranger"" to be a straight retelling of the 1960's television series. ""The Lone Ranger"" is an over the top reboot that mixes funny, dramatic and mysterious in uneven proportions. This reviewer saw it with an audience that laughed out loud at some of the funny parts and cheered when the Lone Ranger rode to the rescue in the finale.The story is told by an aged Tonto to a wide-eyed young boy in a Lone Ranger costume. Extended flashbacks provide an origin for Tonto, a Comanche alienated from his tribe, and for John Reid, a lawyer who returns to his Texas hometown just in time to be deputized as a Ranger and ride into a lethal ambush with his brother. John (Armie Hammer) survives the ambush, thanks to a mysterious white horse and to Tonto (Johnny Depp in spirit warrior garb), who believes the Ranger will be his companion in a quest for justice. The Ranger will require some persuasion from Tonto to take on that role, as the two face a vicious outlaw gang and some corrupt officials. At stake, among other things, is the fate of John's sister in law (and former girlfriend) and her son.The movie has some spectacular action sequences, and there is a solid supporting cast. It does run long, and some of the gags are hit or miss. The tone of the movie veers between comedy and drama and farce; a promising love story doesn't come to anything.

He wears a mask, he lives in the Old West, and he has a buddy who keeps calling him ""kemosabe,"" whatever that means.So I had few expectations of ""The Lone Ranger,"" which Disney attempted to set up as the natural successor to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" -- director Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp being goofy, lots of over-the-top action. Instead, it ends up a colossal flop that frantically tries to appeal to everyone, but ends up appealing to no one.Lawyer John Reid (Arnie Hammer) returns to the town of Colby, determined to bring law and order to the lawless West. But then his brother is murdered (and partially eaten) by the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), and John is left for dead. Fortunately, he's found by Tonto (Johnny Depp), a Comanche who believes Cavendish is a wendigo (despite that not being a Comanche belief, to the best of my knowledge).But with the guidance of a spirit horse (don't ask), Tonto brings John back to life to battle Cavendish, and the two men join forces, despite John being kind of a weenie. And when John finally takes up the mantle of the Lone Ranger, he and Tonto soon discover that Cavendish's scheme has national implications... and yes, they are glaringly obvious.There is one damning problem with ""The Lone Ranger"" that sinks it as a film: it can't figure what it wants to be. It wants to be a gritty, dusty slow-moving drama, but also a buddy comedy. A realistic depiction of the Old West, but also full of goofy over-the-top action. It wants to include the plight of the Indian populace in the 1800s, but it also wants Tonto to wear a birdcage on his head.There is literally no scene in this movie that doesn't give you mood whiplash of one kind or another. Example: a scene where John sees his brother eaten alive... is followed by Tonto having an argument with a horse. It's also littered with all sorts of bizarre things that are never explained, including an infestation of vampire rabbits or a steampunk madam with a gun in her ivory leg.But the story is a bloated mess even without those oddities. Large portions of the movie seem like they were inserted to pad out the running time (the frame device, the brothel visit) because they don't add anything to the plot. And there are plot holes you could drive a space shuttle through, such as HOW Tonto escaped from the jail cell. Even worse, the narrative actually brings up that plot hole... and never answers it. It's the laziest writing outside of a literal deus ex machina.It feels like Gore Verbinski knew there was something wrong with ""The Lone Ranger,"" but not WHAT. So he simply flung more action and quirkiness at the story until it becomes an incoherent mess.I will say that most of the actors do a passable job, even though the material is betraying them. Arnie Hammer tries his hardest with the masked vigilante, even though John comes across as a naive twit. Ruth Wilson -- whom I've observed since ""Jane Eyre"" -- gives a performance far too passionate and deep for the cliched ""old flame"" role she's playing.As for Johnny Depp as Tonto... really, I don't even know what to think. This character is the embodiment of everything wrong with the movie. There are a few moments where Depp gets to shine, showing the long hard road Tonto has been on, the horrors he's seen, and the guilt he feels...... but more frequently, we get to see Tonto acting like an idiot, doing loopy things purely for the comic relief. It honestly becomes hard to tell if Tonto is being portrayed in a racist manner, or if the Disney executives stupidly decided that they could do the exact same thing that they did with Jack Sparrow. Either way, it cheapens the character and his backstory to have him being an out-of-touch loon.""The Lone Ranger"" has a few bright spots, but the overall effect is of a messy, bipolar movie that careens around like an out-of-control roller-coaster.

Helena Bonham Carter is a hoot.  William Fichtner makes a great villain.  But.  The narration goes in one direction, the film in another.  The plot never stabilizes into a coherent, rational story.  At all times it defines logic and physics.  The humor is pure slapstick.  The few scenes where it turns serious, it turns deadly serious, then it jars you a step back with more humor.  There's a massacre that's rather grim.  There's an ambush that ends with cannibalism.  Greed is at the heart of the story but it takes forever before that's revealed.  You won't want for villains in this movie, there's several too many (and the main three have nonspecific/questionable demises that beg for a sequel or two that no one expects at this point in time).  Sadly, Armie Hammer makes a bland hero.  As for Johnny Depp, it's clear at the outset that he's not the other guy's sidekick, he's the STAR of the picture.  Which makes no sense at all, especially for someone like me who grew up watching the original TV series.  Very little of this bares any resemblance to the original except for THAT song, wisely played at one point to great effect.  Otherwise, I did like it, sort of, so I guess I wouldn't mind seeing it again someday, definitely not soon...............  But I can certainly see why the critics hated it and why no one flocked to the theater to see it and why it lost so much money (foreign and domestic).

A young masked boy in cowboy gear sees an Indian in the exhibit.The Indian starts to tell him about his story - him and a white man - the Lone Ranger. Theboy is enthralled--we are waiting for the actual action to start...When the actual movie started, I was waiting and waiting for action. There is some and avery gory scene at the start.The first half of the movie dragged, albeit telling the story's premise; loong and fairly dull.Reid, then a lawyer, then appointed a Ranger, thought the law was the only way to have peace and rule the land.He was wrong.The story progresses that not everything is black and white in law or the Old West.The Spiritual White Stallion appears and Reid is chosen to help Tonto, whether he like it or not!The Utah scenery is breathtaking. Worth seeing the movie for that.The storyline tends to drag along for quite a while somewhere between wanting to go get something from the concessionstand and/or bathroom break....the magic appears!!!!if you wait long enough,  the true Lone Ranger and Tonto emerge--along with the music-- you will be cheering and applauding.Stay or watch until the complete ending credits; most have more 'action' under the credits!!!!!!  You are excited and clap and cheer atthe action and suspense. Depp steals scenes often, but he's one of the executive producers andreally cute, so he can. Then thinking back, the latter half of the movie makes up for the first, so I changed to 4 stars.Tonto  finishes telling the boy his story and the little guy can't believe that it was truly real, but he is affected by the story, and puts onhis mask again.The last half makes up for the first, but I gave it 3 stars initially because the wait was too long, and 4 stars for the experience and funand clapping and cheering!BTW Trivia -- For those of you who are not comic book aficionados, the little boy from the exhibit, is a descendant of  Reid, and he grows up to be The Green Hornet-A good guy who always has his mask on...If they have a partial DVD of the latter half of the movie, I'll buy it -- but going through the first half IS worth the excitement of the latter, so maybe I may!Hi yo Silver, Away!!!!Ellen George, author of Flutterby, a children's book, and reviewer (and movie fan)",4,The last half makes up for the slow start,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2369,"['are', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'must', 'be', 'major', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'fan.The', 'story', 'starts', 'Wild', 'West', 'exhibit', 'young', 'masked', 'boy', 'cowboy', 'gear', 'Indian', 'exhibit.The', 'Indian', 'tell', 'story', 'white', 'man', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Theboy', 'enthralled', 'are', 'waiting', 'actual', 'action', 'start', 'When', 'actual', 'movie', 'started', 'was', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'action', 'avery', 'gory', 'scene', 'start.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'dragged', 'telling', 'story', 'premise', 'fairly', 'dull.Reid', 'then', 'lawyer', 'then', 'appointed', 'Ranger', 'thought', 'law', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'peace', 'rule', 'land.He', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'story', 'progresses', 'not', 'everything', 'black', 'white', 'law', 'Old', 'West.The', 'Spiritual', 'White', 'Stallion', 'Reid', 'chosen', 'help', 'Tonto', 'not', 'Utah', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'seeing', 'movie', 'that.The', 'storyline', 'drag', 'quite', 'while', 'somewhere', 'wanting', 'go', 'get', 'something', 'concessionstand', 'and/or', 'bathroom', 'break', 'magic', 'wait', 'long', 'enough', 'true', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'emerge', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'cheering', 'applauding.Stay', 'watch', 'complete', 'ending', 'credits', 'most', 'have', 'more', ""'action"", 'credits', 'are', 'excited', 'clap', 'cheer', 'atthe', 'action', 'suspense', 'Depp', 'steals', 'scenes', 'often', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'andreally', 'cute', 'can', 'Then', 'thinking', 'back', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'up', 'first', 'so', 'changed', '4', 'stars.Tonto', 'finishes', 'telling', 'boy', 'story', 'little', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'truly', 'real', 'affected', 'story', 'onhis', 'mask', 'last', 'half', 'up', 'first', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'initially', 'wait', 'was', 'too', 'long', '4', 'stars', 'experience', 'funand', 'clapping', 'cheering', 'BTW', 'Trivia', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'aficionados', 'little', 'boy', 'exhibit', 'descendant', 'Reid', 'up', 'be', 'Green', 'Hornet-A', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'mask', 'have', 'partial', 'DVD', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'going', 'first', 'half', 'IS', 'excitement', 'latter', 'maybe', 'may', 'Hi', 'yo', 'Silver', 'Away', 'Ellen', 'George', 'author', 'Flutterby', 'children', 'book', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'fan']",The Lone Ranger

Hammer is no slouch either as the naive, idealistic greenhorn from the city.  Most of the move is about the greenhorn trying to deal with a half-mad Comanche and a half-sane spirt horse. By the end of the film, it becomes obvious that the Comanche is wise and the sprit horse knows what he is doing.I hope that in spite of the bad reviews and poor box office performance, that there will be another one.

This is the perfect opportunity for more people to give it the chance they didn't when it hit theaters. The film is as authentic a western as audiences can get these days. It's an action-packed ride filled with humor and plenty of thrills.John Reid rides along with his Texas Ranger brother to track down a ruthless bandit. After the group of lawmen is killed in an ambush, Reid is left for dead. Native American Tonto finds the injured Reid and nurses him back to health. It's now left up to the unlikely union of these two very different men to track down the killer of Reid's brother and bring him to justice.&#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (2:40.1). The video quality is up to the standards we expect from Disney. The picture is clean and the colors are all well-balanced. Much of the movie is filmed on location which lends to its authentic feel and viewing experience.The 7.1 surround sound mix for &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; puts the viewer right in the middle of all the adventure and excitement. &#34;William Tell's Overture&#34; never sounded so bombastic while accompanying all the gunfire, galloping, and explosions we are awarded in this fun-filled journey into yesteryear. Hans Zimmer's musical score perfectly accentuates all the frenetic and dramatic activity taking place on the screen.The Blu-ray version of &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; contains a few special features. They include three featurettes entitled &#34;Riding the Trails of 'The Lone Ranger',&#34; &#34;Armie's Western Road Trip,&#34; and &#34;Becoming a Cowboy.&#34; It also features a deleted scene and bloopers.&#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; isn't a perfect film by any means. Some of the action sequences are a bit long for one. I found Johnny Depp's performance as Tonto to be a lot of fun to watch, but some might feel he's going back to the Captain Jack Sparrow well one too many times. Overall, it's a rollicking good time that hearkens back to the days of cliffhanging matinees of the 1930s and 1940s.",4,"""The Lone Ranger"" Gallops Triumphantly into Homes on Blu-ray and DVD",1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2154,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Home', 'Entertainment', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'living', 'room', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'Digital', 'Download', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'more', 'people', 'give', 'chance', 'did', ""n't"", 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'film', 'authentic', 'western', 'audiences', 'can', 'get', 'days', 'action-packed', 'ride', 'filled', 'humor', 'plenty', 'thrills.John', 'Reid', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'brother', 'track', 'down', 'ruthless', 'bandit', 'group', 'lawmen', 'killed', 'ambush', 'Reid', 'left', 'dead', 'Native', 'American', 'Tonto', 'injured', 'Reid', 'back', 'health', 'now', 'left', 'up', 'unlikely', 'union', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'Reid', 'brother', 'bring', 'justice.', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', 'Widescreen', '2:40.1', 'video', 'quality', 'standards', 'expect', 'Disney', 'picture', 'clean', 'colors', 'are', 'well-balanced', 'Much', 'movie', 'filmed', 'location', 'authentic', 'feel', 'viewing', 'experience.The', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'viewer', 'right', 'middle', 'adventure', 'excitement', '34', 'William', 'Tell', 'Overture', '34', 'never', 'sounded', 'so', 'bombastic', 'accompanying', 'gunfire', 'galloping', 'explosions', 'are', 'awarded', 'fun-filled', 'journey', 'yesteryear', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'musical', 'score', 'perfectly', 'frenetic', 'dramatic', 'activity', 'taking', 'place', 'screen.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'three', 'featurettes', 'entitled', '34', 'Riding', 'Trails', ""'The"", 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', '34', 'Armie', 'Western', 'Road', 'Trip', '34', '34', 'Becoming', 'Cowboy.', '34', 'also', 'deleted', 'scene', 'bloopers.', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'bit', 'long', 'one', 'found', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'Tonto', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'might', 'feel', 'going', 'back', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'well', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Overall', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'back', 'days', 'cliffhanging', 'matinees', '1930s', '1940s']",The Lone Ranger

1656302,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DJYJWVW,FNDNreview,"[34, 74]","For those of you that don't know much about The Lone Ranger, he was originally a character developed for radio in the early 1930s - allegedly based on a Federal agent during the post-Civil War era of American history.  After the success of the radio show, The Lone Ranger spawned into a successful series of novels, followed by an extremely popular television show in the 1950s, starring Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto).  Like many other heroes of that period, The Lone Ranger, and his Indian side-kick, Tonto, stood for truth and justice - essentially following a ""straight edge"" lifestyle (never smoking, drinking, or shooting to kill).  He also answered to Tonto's nickname, ""Ke-mo sah-bee,"" and often screamed ""Hi-Yo, Silver"" while riding his horse, Silver.  Now, after a lengthy hiatus, Disney has revived the character for a new generation in the Jerry Bruckheimer produced film, simply titled - The Lone Ranger.Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, re-teams with Pirates star Johnny Depp - who stars as Tonto, the Indian sidekick of The Lone Ranger.  Now an elderly man, Tonto recounts his earliest adventure with John Reid, The Lone Ranger.  Upon meeting John Reid (Armie Hammer), he is a ""by the book"" lawyer that's escorting a train carrying nefarious villain, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), to the location of his hanging.  Naturally, Cavendish escapes, forcing a group of Texas Rangers - including John and his brother, Dan, to track him down and bring him to justice.  Cavendish anticipates an ambush and murders the Rangers (including Dan), leaving John for dead.  Tonto, with ambitions of his own, rescues John and convinces him that he can do the most good as a masked hero - since the world assumes he's already dead.  Together, the unlikely duo set out to bring Cavendish to justice and prevent a war between the Union and Indians.  Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ruth Wilson also star in supporting roles.For the current generation and even the generation before it, The Lone Ranger was already a hero of childhoods past - giving way to much more interesting and far ""cooler"" superheroes, like Batman and Superman.  Seriously, who cares about a guy on a horse when there's a guy flying through the sky that can bounce bullets off his chest?  Back in the 1940s and 50s (when kids didn't have video games or cell phones), the premise of cowboys and Indians was still relevant.  However, times have changed, and apparently Disney believed they could somehow revitalize a character that has long been irrelevant and outdated.  Ironically, Disney turned to directed Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp to help bring a little ""Jack Sparrow"" magic to the Wild West.  Despite the star-power, the idea of bringing back The Lone Ranger had bad news written all over it from the get-go (with a massive budget to boot).  It's no secret that western film isn't exactly the most popular film genre at the moment, especially for the younger crowd.  Westerns can be pretty popular during Academy Award season, but they don't exactly scream ""summer blockbuster"" (just ask Jon Favreau about Cowboys & Aliens).The high points of the new Lone Ranger film come in the form of the brilliant cinematography work and eye-catching costume attire.  From the Union uniforms to the dusty trench coats, everything felt authentic - even Johnny Depp's make-up is somewhat believable.  Obviously, it's difficult to mess up the look of the old west since all the filmmakers need to do is go out to the southwestern United States to shoot, but it's still breathtakingly beautiful scenery no matter how you look at it.  Regardless, without the proper look of the appropriate time period, any film is doomed to fail.  But, while the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the CGI is overly abused and severely damages the imagery.  One minute the film feels like an authentic western and the next thing you know there's a train doing somersaults off the tracks, a horse running on top of a train while it swings around a tight bend and finally, you have Johnny Depp swinging around on a ladder while also on top of a train.  For a film that desperately needed to be authentic, it hurts itself by trying to be too visually ambitious - not to mention the characters are able to walk away (unscathed) from numerous accidents that would have easily traumatized or killed most people.Aside from cinematography and costumes, the film is all downhill.  There are several scenes in the film that could have easily been completely cut out or at least rewritten to reduce the lengthy run-time.  As I sit here and write this, I'm still not entirely sure what purpose Helena Bonham Carter serves in the film, other than to highlight a woman with a weaponized prosthetic leg.  Much of the film's plot feels jumbled and overly busy, without any real payoff.  As the film progresses, it's hard to differentiate the climax from several other random shootout scenes during which absolutely nothing is accomplished other than it being just another pointless scene where the good guys almost caught the bad guy.  The pace of the film starts off well, lags for a bit, and then basically drags you to the finish line - only when you get there, there's absolutely no payoff other than the fact that you're finally allowed to leave the theater.  Basically, you'll feel like The Lone Ranger in one particular scene where he is being drug by a horse, the horse stops to ""take a load off,"" and then proceeds to drag him through it.Overall, Disney will most likely wish they hadn't made this movie.  Number one, it will be hard-pressed to recuperate the roughly $250 million budget, let alone make a profit.  Second (and most importantly), the film's plot is often uneventful and could have easily been under 2 hours in length.  The punch line at the end (which is funny) is not hardly worth the price of admission.  More often than not, Johnny Depp feels as though he's trying to do an over-the-top Jack Sparrow impression in the desert, while Armie Hammer simply goes through the tireless motions of acting too good for everyone else in the film.  And, even though The Lone Ranger is easily distinguishable by its classic musical theme, this new film rendition overly abuses the classic tune, which often makes the scenes it's used in feel more like a joke.  If you were hoping The Lone Ranger would be a Pirates-like adventure, you'll be incredibly disappointed with the outcome.Grade:  DFNDNreview.com",1,'The Lone Ranger' bumbling and drawn

I imagined a darker, more serious toned epic with Tonto weaving a mystical spiritual tale of suffering and phoenix like resurrection for the two characters but this movie doesn't take that view at all. This is a clumsy, slapstick mess. It attempts to lend gravity to the plight of the indigenous peoples, but then makes a mockery of it the next scene by tossing in goofy antics and deadpan facial expressions from Depp around every other corner. There are no stand out performances at all and mainly Depp seems miss cast as Tonto despite his claims of having Indian blood it doesn't seem to make him any more believable at all.

1656308,A212BN81DP6FRI,B00DJYJWVW,freelancer26,"[5, 15]","The beginning of this film reminded me of other comic book films that start with a child musing on current hero memorabilia in the year the respective hero was created - in this case, 1933. The length of this film is two and a half hours and for two whole hours, this film is uneven. There are GOLDEN moments full of humor, action and adventure but they are unfortunately muddled together with long drags of the usual ""I'm not the hero you want me to be"" and ""You're right, you're not but you're all there is so man up already!"" This was obviously conceived as an origin story to set up at least a couple of sequels. Whenever film makers do this, they always run the risk of getting the story stuck in really boring details dealing with really boring characters. And by the way, Kemosabe (Tonto's nickname for John Reid) does not mean ""wrong brother."" It means ""trusted friend."" I know they were probably just trying to make a joke of this but if there is a sequel, I hope they clear this up as it is an important point in the relationship of hero and sidekick. With that said, the last half hour came riding gallantly to the rescue ... From the second The Lone Ranger theme (Hans Zimmer's glorious version of the William Tell Overture) began to play, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face! And, I actually clapped at the conclusion of it :) Those last thirty minutes which began with this sequence were worth the price of admission - I just wish the first two hours had been more like that. I hope all involved have the chance to make those planned sequels as hopefully, they may get to be like that MAGICAL half hour.Before the invention of the superhero in 1938 came the fearless hero lawman complete in a white hat and on a white horse - The Lone Ranger (created by George W. Trendle) being the most legendary of the genre. He premiered in radio in 1933 but in television and films from 1949 to the late 1950's John Reid (The Lone Ranger) was played fabulously by Clayton Moore (and John Hart) with Jay Silverheels playing Tonto. Silverheels was Native American royalty - a prince as he was a Mohawk Chief's son. Moore took his job seriously, so much so that it changed his life forever. He said that playing The Lone Ranger made him a better person and lived the rest of his life doing his best to abide by The Lone Ranger Moral Code as written by the hero's first writer Fran Striker:The Lone Ranger believes ...1) that to have a friend, a man must be one.2) that all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself (or herself) the power to make this a better world.3) that God put the firewood there but that every man must gather and light it himself.4) in being prepared physically, mentally and morally to fight when necessary for that which is right.5) that a man should make most of what equipment he has.6) that ""this government of the people, by the people and for the people"" shall live always.7) that men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number. (I don't entirely agree with this one as the majority is sometimes wrong but I do agree that real change must be made within the law of the land)8) that sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the world and make payment for what we have taken. (In other words, you reap what you sow ... and it is so true!)9) that all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.10) in my Creator, my country and my fellow man. (The film kinda ignored this one)The two leads played their roles decently enough but, for now at least, my favorite Lone Ranger moment happened in the 1970's-80's TV show ""Happy Days"" in the season 9 episode where John Hart as The Lone Ranger pays a visit to The Fonze on his birthday. Henry Winkler played the scene to perfection opposite his childhood hero. The coolest guy around being star struck by a legend.

1656311,AG8K92N37MT27,B00DJYJWVW,Garnet,"[3, 4]","Silly me, I listened to the critics and didn't go see this movie in the theatre.  When I finally sat down to watch it on Blue-ray I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a pretty good movie.  Not in the same league as the original Pirates of the Caribbean, but it has some of the same flashes of brilliance...hardly surprising since there were so many who were involved with both movies.I never really watched the original Lone Ranger, so I had few expectations and took this movie for what it was.  The story is told from Tonto's pov as he relates the origin of the Lone Ranger to a young kid at a Wild West Show years and years later and, along the way, tells his own backstory.  The kid is shocked to find one of the presentations at the show involves a live--if very old and very odd--person who tells him to never take off his mask and treats the stuffed crow on his head as through it were alive.The story he relates is filled with adventure, danger, good versus evil, and spirit magic...and one of the best magic elements of the story is the white Spirit Horse we all know as Silver.Some spoilers below:The story starts with a bad guy being brought to town for justice, a bad guy chained next to Tonto, who calls him a Wendigo, a name for a being who eats other human beings and grows strong because of it.  The bad guy is rescued by his gang and our would-hero sets off with the Texas Rangers, including his brother, to hunt them down.  They make a big mistake and all are killed and Tonto sets about burying them...only to have a pure white Spirit Horse turn up and show him that one of these men is special and is not dead after all.  (The scenes here with the horse are pretty funny.)Tonto puts a mask on the man, sets him on the Spirit Horse, and they go after the bad guys.  Turns out Tonto has his own agenda, his own quest for revenge going on.  There are hints here and there that the Lone Ranger has become something more than just some guy out for justice, just as Tonto seems very much a shamanic style figure.  Together now, the Lone Ranger begins a journey of discovery of what his new life is about as they fight to protect his brother's wife and child, strive to bring to justice the bad guys, and end the secret machinations of the big shot railroad men.As this story is being told by Tonto years later, there are times when there are unexplained bits in the movie--which actually make sense since he is relating what amounts to a myth to the kid listening to him--and plenty of magical events, such as the Spirit Horse going where horses cannot go and doing what horses cannot do.  The cuts back and forth between the Wild West Show setting and the real Wild West are very well done.  This is a movie that definitely is about the Myth of the Lone Ranger and Tonto and everything wrapped up with that.Quite well done for what it is.  Not a brilliant movie, but one I will end up keeping and watching again.  I would have given it 5 stars if some of the subplots hadn't seemed to disappear and if they had brought out more about the Wendigo aspect in the movie...basically made good on the promise of the movie.",4,Way Better Than Expected,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,3136,"['Silly', 'listened', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'theatre', 'When', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Blue-ray', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'same', 'league', 'original', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'same', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'movies.I', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'original', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'had', 'few', 'expectations', 'took', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'story', 'told', 'Tonto', 'pov', 'origin', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'young', 'kid', 'Wild', 'West', 'Show', 'years', 'years', 'later', 'way', 'own', 'backstory', 'kid', 'shocked', 'find', 'one', 'presentations', 'show', 'live', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'odd', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'take', 'off', 'mask', 'stuffed', 'crow', 'head', 'were', 'alive.The', 'story', 'filled', 'adventure', 'danger', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'spirit', 'magic', 'one', 'best', 'magic', 'elements', 'story', 'white', 'Spirit', 'Horse', 'know', 'Silver.Some', 'spoilers', 'story', 'bad', 'guy', 'being', 'brought', 'town', 'justice', 'bad', 'guy', 'chained', 'next', 'Tonto', 'who', 'Wendigo', 'name', 'being', 'who', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'grows', 'strong', 'bad', 'guy', 'rescued', 'gang', 'would-hero', 'sets', 'off', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'including', 'brother', 'hunt', 'down', 'make', 'big', 'mistake', 'are', 'killed', 'Tonto', 'sets', 'burying', 'only', 'have', 'pure', 'white', 'Spirit', 'Horse', 'turn', 'up', 'show', 'one', 'men', 'special', 'not', 'dead', 'scenes', 'here', 'horse', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Tonto', 'mask', 'man', 'Spirit', 'Horse', 'go', 'bad', 'guys', 'out', 'Tonto', 'own', 'agenda', 'own', 'quest', 'revenge', 'going', 'are', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'become', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'guy', 'out', 'justice', 'just', 'Tonto', 'very', 'much', 'shamanic', 'style', 'figure', 'Together', 'now', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'journey', 'discovery', 'what', 'new', 'life', 'fight', 'protect', 'brother', 'wife', 'child', 'strive', 'bring', 'justice', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'secret', 'machinations', 'big', 'shot', 'railroad', 'men.As', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Tonto', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'are', 'unexplained', 'bits', 'movie', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'relating', 'what', 'amounts', 'myth', 'kid', 'listening', 'plenty', 'magical', 'events', 'such', 'Spirit', 'Horse', 'going', 'where', 'horses', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'doing', 'what', 'horses', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'Wild', 'West', 'Show', 'setting', 'real', 'Wild', 'West', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Myth', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'that.Quite', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'Not', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'keeping', 'watching', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'subplots', 'had', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'disappear', 'had', 'brought', 'out', 'more', 'Wendigo', 'aspect', 'movie', 'basically', 'made', 'good', 'promise', 'movie']",The Lone Ranger
1656312,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00DJYJWVW,Gary P. Cohen,"[27, 41]","Saw this film last night, it was enjoyable but far from great.  The main problem as so many have stated is that it wasn't sure what it wanted to be: a serious western or a western comedy.  Sure there were very serious and violent scenes such as the ambushing of the Texas Rangers by the Cavendish gang (very well done) and the slaughter of a tribe of attacking Indians by an army Gatling Gun.  (We are absolutely meant to root for the Indians here.)  Still the film has too much comedy particularly the way Tonto talks to the Lone Ranger and the supernatural abilities of Silver, the horse.Depp is great as Tonto, appearing a bit, as so many have stated, as an Indian Captain Jack Sparrow.  However Armie Hammer is a basic non-entity as the Ranger.  He is one of a young group of actors that I have difficulty telling apart. (Armie Hammer, Channing Tatum, ???)  While I did love tv westerns growing up, I have very little specific memories of The Lone Ranger.  I am not sure whether he ever killed anyone with his famous silver bullets.  Here he never shoots anyone.  Even when the evil Cavendish is finally killed, it is through a series of cicumstances set up by the Ranger and Tonto, not the Ranger himself.  Furthermore, the Ranger prevents many attempts to kill Cavendish by Tonto, just so that Cavendish can hang lawfully.  This gets silly after a while as Cavendish constantly escapes to perform more mayhem.  Truthfully, this Lone Ranger just isn't very smart.  This is Depp's and Tonto's film.Weeks before this film opened, the Hollywood trades started printing stories about how this would be a financial disaster for Disney, this year's ""John Carter.""  The film critic's jumped on the bandwagon with their ridiculous one star reviews.  Suddenly we have a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" and the film is bombing.  They tried to do the same thing to a lesser extent with ""Man of Steel.""  The web-site Rotten Tomatoes.com had an average positive review among film critics of 67%.  Yet the movie goers polled gave the film an A minus.Look, ""The Lone Ranger"" is no ""Man of Steel.""  However it still deserved a better fate.  The long action scene at the end involving two runaway trains is amazing.  As stated, it is not great but not terrible either.  Perhaps today's audiences do not love westerns like I do, I have no doubt we will not be seeing a ""Lone Ranger 2.""

The costuming, set layout and exterior locations are outstanding. The whorehouse scene is right out of the Birdcage Theater in Tombstone, AZ and if you've ever been through the place, it is an absolute clone and the way things were then.The costuming and makeup of the bad guys is excellently done. That said...that's the end of anything well done in this film. Let's try to take things one at a time.First this film has THREE writers...that's right...THREE. Bad idea!This resulted in a hodgepodge of unrelated story lines, most of which have zero to do with whatever storyline there was...if one actually existed in the first place!Second...WHY is an aging Tonto narrating to a little Jewish kid in a western sideshow...WHY??Third...there is a rule in film making that can NEVER be broken. You cannot show brutal killing and massacre and then try to make it funny or humorous. Depp as Tonto keeps a running dialog of one-liners and wise cracks that are totally out of place. Indians aren't like this...I grew up with them. In addition, Tonto is the smarter one, always saving the Ranger from his own stupidity. The original story line does not go this way. And what was the deal with the carnivorous, canibalistic psycho-rabbits??!!Fourth...photography is dark, depressing, at times over-exposed. The DOP was apparently trying new aspects, which DID NOT work. The first third of the film is done in what appears to be a brown-sepia filtration, which gives it an aged black and white feel, but mostly just makes everything look dirty. Two-thirds of the film is too dark and not properly lighted. Exteriors are overexposed to give it a whiteout, surreal flavor. None of this worked and seriously detracted from the overall aspect.Fifth...the worst part of the entire film is that the writers did not seem to understand what direction they were actually going. The screenplay is all over the place, with zero continuity or flow-of-storyline, so that the viewer doesn't know where the hell he is from one scene to the next. The gigantic blow-'em-up, chase-'em, shoot 'em finale is so much of a surreal stretch as to actually be laughable. Audiences are coming away with a 'What the hell were they thinking?' take on the whole thing. Disney apparently doesn't care or they never would have released garbage like this!

I liked this movie well enough, though not enough to buy or see it again.  My mom, who had chosen this for our Xmas movie, had hated it.The beginning of the movie was a bit confusing.  It starts out with a young boy visiting an Old West exhibit in 1933, and he strikes up a conversation with a wax figure of Tonto that suddenly comes to life.  The movie makes time jumps back and forth, and you have to really pay attention to keep track of things.The movie has a strong plot and keeps a good pace, but it is just a bit too long for the average attention span.Though it has its funny moments, it also shows quite a bit of violence that doesn't really make it suitable as a comedy (i.e.  they have a guy that is a partial cannibal and you see people getting wiped out--there are also references to the threat of rape).  My mom had expected a comedy, and that was one of the reasons why she didn't like this.  I guess really this is more of an action film than anything.I'm not sure another problem with the film was that it was trying not to do anything that could be considered offensive to Native Americans. I don't know what the original series was like, but the thing about shows from an older period is that they come from a time when it was socially acceptable to make fun of minorities and people who were different from you.  These days, we are more sensitive.  Though a film shouldn't be offensive, sometimes they can be too self-conscious.The characters were well developed and likable.  Johnny Depp was an endearing Tonto.  I don't know if Helena Bonham Carter's character was really necessary and could have been cut to reduce the length of the movie, but she was entertaining.  The other actors were really good in their roles.",3,"Not Serious Enough to be a Drama, But Serious Enough Not to be a True Comedy...An Action Film(Possible Spoilers)",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1818,"['never', 'watched', 'old', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'liked', 'movie', 'well', 'enough', 'not', 'enough', 'buy', 'see', 'again', 'My', 'mom', 'who', 'had', 'chosen', 'Xmas', 'movie', 'had', 'hated', 'it.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'out', 'young', 'boy', 'visiting', 'Old', 'West', 'exhibit', '1933', 'up', 'conversation', 'wax', 'figure', 'Tonto', 'suddenly', 'life', 'movie', 'time', 'jumps', 'back', 'forth', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'keep', 'track', 'things.The', 'movie', 'strong', 'plot', 'good', 'pace', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'average', 'attention', 'span.Though', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'suitable', 'comedy', 'i.e', 'have', 'guy', 'partial', 'cannibal', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'wiped', 'out', 'are', 'also', 'references', 'threat', 'rape', 'mom', 'had', 'expected', 'comedy', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'guess', 'really', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'anything.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'trying', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'offensive', 'Native', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'thing', 'shows', 'older', 'period', 'come', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'make', 'fun', 'minorities', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'different', 'days', 'are', 'more', 'sensitive', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'offensive', 'sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'self-conscious.The', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'likable', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'endearing', 'Tonto', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'reduce', 'length', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'roles']",The Lone Ranger
1656342,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00DJYJWVW,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[3, 5]","Sometimes I like movies that are largely considered to be stink bombs. John Carter: flawed but not as bad as many said. Santa Claus the Movie: far from perfect, but wonderful in many ways, especially the storybook quality and Henry Mancini's score. Lost Horizon: misfires aplenty but a fine cast, kitsch value and some catchy tunes by Bacharach/David. And so on.So I tried to find something to like in The Lone Ranger. The opening, with the boy at the carnival (and the &#34;thrilling days of yesteryear&#34; reference to the radio show) was encouraging. But it just never picks up. Much as I tried, how do I not love thee, Lone Ranger 2013? Let me count the ways...1. Uneven balance of drama, comedy, send-up, fantasy, sick humor, bawdiness and western melodrama. This could be the first Disney film in which someone is seen peeing on camera. Not long after, another character vomits. Then Silver (as in Hi-Yo) poops and The Lone Ranger himself is dragged through it, head first.2. The lead character is an idiot. It's as if Jeannie blinked Major Nelson into a very expensive episode of I Dream of Jeannie. The difference is that even Larry Hagman would have played it less silly.3. Like John Carter, they hung a multi-million-dollar movie on the shoulders of an untested lead actor. It took two Armie Hammers to make a Winklevoss. Perhaps he can redeem his lead status in a future vehicle. Taylor Kitsch is now a supporting actor.4. Johnny Depp. Plenty has been said about his performance, but I wonder whether the whole concept couldn't work no matter what he did. His Tonto is very much like Jack Sparrow, only his voice sounds like Rob Schneider in Bedtime Stories.5. Sweaty, yucky, grizzled, bulbous, bloated, scuzzy people, all except for Armie Hammer, followed by the angry-eyes lady who plays the unhappy mom of P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.6. Never release a movie in the heat of summer and show a lot of overdressed people who look like they're either in need of a bath or about to pass out, as well as people who look like they need to be hosed down. Another John Carter mistake.7. Way too much money spent. (SPOILER) As soon as I saw the bridge -- a REALLY big bridge, I knew it would get blowed up real good and come tumbling down. Gene Autry could have made 30 episodes of his TV show,  four movies, six radio shows and a record album in the time it takes to watch this movie. Surely there's a point in the middle.8. Way too long. An issue with a lot of movies nowadays, though.9. This is the first time I've ever seen bloopers that mostly could have been in left in the movie without it making much of a difference. Not being facetious.10. Cannibal bunnies.Good points: Johnny Depp's performance as the old version of Tonto is the closest any character comes to being sympathetic (though he looks like Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man or Billy Crystal in Mr. Saturday Night). Breathtaking photography. Armie has nice hair when it hasn't been dragged through horse poop. Lather, rinse, repeat.Is it worth seeing? Well, I couldn't turn away. There's something compelling and astonishing about a work of this magnitude gone astray. My wife, who loves to see a good western, would still like to see a good western.Clearly this film was intended to do for westerns what Pirates of the Caribbean did for pirate movies. As a genre, they're still too problematic in this day and age to work. And this film's very visible lack of success doesn't bode well for another attempt of this nature to happen anytime soon.",2,"Sorry, Armie...",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3525,"['Sometimes', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'largely', 'considered', 'be', 'stink', 'bombs', 'John', 'Carter', 'flawed', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'said', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'wonderful', 'many', 'ways', 'especially', 'storybook', 'quality', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'score', 'Lost', 'Horizon', 'misfires', 'aplenty', 'fine', 'cast', 'kitsch', 'value', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'Bacharach/David', 'so', 'on.So', 'tried', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'opening', 'boy', 'carnival', '34', 'thrilling', 'days', 'yesteryear', '34', 'reference', 'radio', 'show', 'was', 'encouraging', 'just', 'never', 'up', 'Much', 'tried', 'how', 'do', 'not', 'love', 'thee', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '2013', 'Let', 'count', 'ways', '1', 'Uneven', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'send-up', 'fantasy', 'sick', 'humor', 'bawdiness', 'western', 'melodrama', 'could', 'be', 'first', 'Disney', 'film', 'someone', 'seen', 'peeing', 'camera', 'Not', 'long', 'character', 'vomits', 'Then', 'Silver', 'Hi-Yo', 'poops', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'dragged', 'head', 'first.2', 'lead', 'character', 'idiot', 'Jeannie', 'blinked', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'very', 'expensive', 'episode', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'difference', 'even', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'less', 'silly.3', 'John', 'Carter', 'hung', 'multi-million-dollar', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'untested', 'lead', 'actor', 'took', 'two', 'Armie', 'Hammers', 'make', 'Winklevoss', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'redeem', 'lead', 'status', 'future', 'vehicle', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'now', 'supporting', 'actor.4', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Plenty', 'been', 'said', 'performance', 'wonder', 'whole', 'concept', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', 'matter', 'what', 'did', 'Tonto', 'very', 'much', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'only', 'voice', 'sounds', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Bedtime', 'Stories.5', 'Sweaty', 'yucky', 'grizzled', 'bulbous', 'bloated', 'scuzzy', 'people', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'followed', 'angry-eyes', 'lady', 'who', 'unhappy', 'mom', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks.6', 'Never', 'release', 'movie', 'heat', 'summer', 'show', 'lot', 'overdressed', 'people', 'who', 'look', ""'re"", 'need', 'bath', 'pass', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'need', 'be', 'hosed', 'down', 'John', 'Carter', 'mistake.7', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'spent', 'SPOILER', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'bridge', 'REALLY', 'big', 'bridge', 'knew', 'would', 'get', 'blowed', 'up', 'real', 'good', 'come', 'tumbling', 'down', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'could', 'have', 'made', '30', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'four', 'movies', 'six', 'radio', 'shows', 'record', 'album', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'Surely', 'point', 'middle.8', 'Way', 'too', 'long', 'issue', 'lot', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'though.9', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'bloopers', 'mostly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'movie', 'making', 'much', 'difference', 'Not', 'being', 'facetious.10', 'Cannibal', 'bunnies.Good', 'points', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'old', 'version', 'Tonto', 'closest', 'character', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Mr.', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Breathtaking', 'photography', 'Armie', 'nice', 'hair', 'when', ""n't"", 'been', 'dragged', 'horse', 'poop', 'Lather', 'rinse', 'repeat.Is', 'seeing', 'Well', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'something', 'compelling', 'astonishing', 'work', 'magnitude', 'gone', 'astray', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'see', 'good', 'western', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'see', 'good', 'western.Clearly', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'do', 'westerns', 'what', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'did', 'pirate', 'movies', 'genre', ""'re"", 'still', 'too', 'problematic', 'day', 'age', 'work', 'film', 'very', 'visible', 'lack', 'success', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'attempt', 'nature', 'happen', 'anytime', 'soon']",The Lone Ranger

Dauria ""daurigl""","[1, 1]","I was disappointed that the Lone Ranger had garnered so many negative reviews but accepted the collective opinion that Disney had produced a clunker despite the talented ensemble they had put together for the movie.  So when it came around on Showtime I thought what the heck, I'll give it a watch.  Wow, I was really surprised how much I liked the film, it was action packed with wonderful settings.  I thought the storyline was solid and that the movie should have been a much bigger hit.  Not entirely sure my judgement was accurate, I asked my usually critical wife to watch it, she too really enjoyed the movie and said that it was much better than what she had expected.  So my bottom line is if you do not have pay per view and are looking for a worthy addition to your Blu-ray collection, do not hesitate to purchase the Lone Ranger, it's an entertaining movie that will be likely viewed more than once.Update:  I purchased The Lone Ranger from Amazon because it is just one of those films that belongs in in a video library.  I have a good home theater system consisting of a 75 inch Samsung with a 7.1 surround system that I really spent too much money on - oh well.  The Lone Ranger is made for such systems, I really do not want to describe the scenes, but consider this: they actually built two locomotive trains with 4 miles of oval track because they wanted realism.  I think it was the director that said, "" you place an actor on top of a train traveling 40 miles an hour and you get better acting then you would if they were placed in front of a blue screen.""",4,Much Better than Expected,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1576,"['was', 'disappointed', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'had', 'garnered', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'accepted', 'collective', 'opinion', 'Disney', 'had', 'produced', 'clunker', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'had', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'So', 'when', 'came', 'around', 'Showtime', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', ""'ll"", 'give', 'watch', 'Wow', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'wonderful', 'settings', 'thought', 'storyline', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'bigger', 'hit', 'Not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'judgement', 'was', 'accurate', 'asked', 'usually', 'critical', 'wife', 'watch', 'too', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'said', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'bottom', 'line', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'view', 'are', 'looking', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Blu-ray', 'collection', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'purchase', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'likely', 'viewed', 'more', 'once.Update', 'purchased', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Amazon', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'video', 'library', 'have', 'good', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'consisting', '75', 'inch', 'Samsung', '7.1', 'surround', 'system', 'really', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'oh', 'well', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'made', 'such', 'systems', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'describe', 'scenes', 'consider', 'actually', 'built', 'two', 'locomotive', 'trains', '4', 'miles', 'oval', 'track', 'wanted', 'realism', 'think', 'was', 'director', 'said', 'place', 'actor', 'top', 'train', 'traveling', '40', 'miles', 'hour', 'get', 'better', 'acting', 'then', 'would', 'were', 'placed', 'front', 'blue', 'screen']",The Lone Ranger
1656345,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B00DJYJWVW,Grimluke,"[0, 1]","Going in this movie with low expectations is probably the best way to go. After all, I did, and I ended up liking this better than all the Pirates movies (except the first). Am I saying that this movie IS better than almost all of the Pirates movies? No, in fact most would probably disagree with me, but this is my review, and I'd like to give my own personal opinion. Now, I would like to say that beating Pirates 2, 3, and 4 is a fairly easy job in my opinion. I thought the second was okay, the third was the second best, and the fourth was a mess. I was very impressed with this movie. It wasn't a great or amazing movie, but it was very entertaining.The humor, I must say, is the strongest point (either that, or Hans Zimmer's soundtrack). I found myself laughing on numerous occasions. Armie Hammer (Lone Ranger) and Johnny Depp (Tonto) make a great duo, which leads to most of the film's humor. The unfortunate thing is that these two are probably the only well developed characters in the movie. I think the writers gave them extra attention so that they can get them just right (being as these two are icons), but I still wished that they hadn't made the other characters so dull. Oh, and I thought that making the Lone Ranger himself seem like the bumbling idiot for most of the film wasn't the best choice.Probably my number one problem with the movie was the amount of graphic images that were shown. I thought that with all that great humor they had a pretty good family movie going for them, but mixing that in with all those disgusting images just didn't make much sense to me. Lord of the Rings can be gross, Gladiator SHOULD be gross, the Lone Ranger... nah. Not to mention they keep advertising this as a Disney movie, so it's just a really weird style they picked. (reminds me of the first G.I. Joe) (NOTE: I did watch this movie on a Clearplay (which mutes language and skips bad or gross scenes). Watching it on Clearplay removed the really gross stuff and kept all the gunslinging cool action scenes, so if disturbing images bother you, Clearplay would be a good idea.)Another problem I had was the weird magic-y spiritual stuff. I thought it was bad enough that they put in their Pirates movies, but now it's in their westerns? Yeah, that's weird. Thankfully, it's not as obvious or weird as the Pirates movies, but it bothers me when it IS there.The only thing I can say about acting is that Johnny Depp is still as entertaining and talented as ever, and Armie Hammer is actually pretty good at acting. My only problem with him is that sometimes it sounds like he has marbles in his mouth. Everyone else's acting is.. decent?Once again, they drew so much attention to the main duo that I really didn't think anyone else was noteworthy in really any sense. At least I can say that there were no actors that stuck out in a bad way.Story was... acceptable. It wasn't really all that interesting (except when it comes to what the main pair are doing), and it was told in the perspective of an elderly Tonto talking to a young boy dressed like the iconic hero. I thought that this was really unnecessary, but it did lead into some pretty funny stuff. One thing I didn't like about the plot was that on at least one occasion, something happened that Tonto would not explain how it happened. It almost was as if the writers of the movie didn't know how it could happen either, so they used Tonto telling the story as an excuse to exclude important details.Like I said, this is not a GREAT movie, but it's a fun one. I thought the humor was exceptional, and I wasn't expecting to be impressed by the action scenes of the film. The final battle was absolutely phenomenal. I'm not going to go into detail (I don't want to spoil it), but it was truly was amazing! To me, if they just removed some of those big problems I had mentioned earlier, this really might've been a great film. Unfortunately, those problems are still there, but I still remain satisfied.

Why put all of  that money and talent into making a film that's going to alienate an entire generation to one of the great mythical Western heroes?

For one thing, there are more uses of Hell and Damn in this film than in any other Disney production (though they avoided taking the Lord's Name in vain this time), the violence is too intense for a Disney film, though of course the worst violence occurs off-screen, just like in John Carter a stream of urine is seen (which is disgusting), the story itself doesn't really make much sense and the frame story is distracting (which plot devices worked for The Princess Bride and THE PRESTIGE, but not for this film). The cannibalism angle was intense for Disney, but they handled it discreetly. Like The Princess And The Frog, though, the suggestion of it was disturbing and too dark for a movie aimed at children.There were some funny bits, including a horse imbibing, but the only part I really enjoyed was the climax, when the last half of the William Tell Overture began playing.View it once.Heigh-ho, Silver.",3,"I Love The Climax, But Not Much Else.",1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,1198,"['Note', 'saw', 'film', 'XFinity', 'Demand.Having', 'listened', 'William', 'Tell', 'Overture', 'Giacchino', 'Rossini', 'growing', 'up', 'last', 'half', 'was', 'used', 'theme', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'interested', 'Disney', 'take', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Alas', 'was', 'more', 'disappointed', 'happy', 'one', 'thing', 'are', 'more', 'uses', 'Hell', 'Damn', 'film', 'other', 'Disney', 'production', 'avoided', 'taking', 'Lord', 'Name', 'vain', 'time', 'violence', 'too', 'intense', 'Disney', 'film', 'course', 'worst', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'just', 'John', 'Carter', 'stream', 'urine', 'seen', 'disgusting', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'frame', 'story', 'distracting', 'plot', 'devices', 'worked', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'THE', 'PRESTIGE', 'not', 'film', 'cannibalism', 'angle', 'was', 'intense', 'Disney', 'handled', 'discreetly', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'though', 'suggestion', 'was', 'disturbing', 'too', 'dark', 'movie', 'aimed', 'children.There', 'were', 'funny', 'bits', 'including', 'horse', 'imbibing', 'only', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'climax', 'when', 'last', 'half', 'William', 'Tell', 'Overture', 'began', 'playing.View', 'once.Heigh-ho', 'Silver']",The Lone Ranger

Heck, even the $2 rental fee seems like a waste in retrospect. Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels must be spinning in their graves over the mess that is 2013's The Lone Ranger. Even the Klinton Spilsbury movie from the 80's was better than this boring, over-long, and soul-less travesty. Guess what? Tonto is now an insult-spouting loon who makes ""funny"" faces after every line he says. And The Lone Ranger himself? Well sir, he's wimpy, whiny, clumsy, anti-violence, anti-gun... and worst of all, a totally clueless moron! Imagine Jerry Lewis in a mask on horseback and you've got a fairly accurate picture, unpleasant though it may be. If Disney had simply advertised this as a straight-up comedy riff on the Lone Ranger I just MIGHT have been able to enjoy it more, or at least stomach it. It wasn't though. This was supposed to be an action film with light comedic touches. What we get though is another typical, heavy-handed, by-the-numbers Jerry Bruckheimer summer blahbuster, and not a particularly funny one either. At least not intentionally. If I'd wanted to watch a comedic western I would've at least picked a GOOD one, like Blazing Saddles, instead of this mindless crap.I recall Johnny Depp making a big issue about getting a chance to pay respect to the native American peoples by portraying Tonto in a positive light when the film was being shot, yet in the finished product his performance comes across EXACTLY like every other white actor in red face make-up that's been on-screen since... ever!  Lower your voice a notch and speak slow, broken English. Wow, that's original. At least when Jay Silverheels did it, it didn't come across sounding so insulting & pretentious. And whose brilliant idea was it for Tonto to be in white muddy war paint with a dead bird tied to his head? Really?!? I don't care how accurate it may or may not have been, from a visually esthetic perspective it's like having a gorilla in green lipstick dressed in a neon orange monokini playing Cheetah. Depp got this job because of his previous work with Disney and Verbinski on the ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" films, nothing more.  His claim of deserving the role because he's part-Indian is bull. So are a lot of other mostly white people in this country. Heck, I've got Chippewa blood in my family lineage but I'm not foolish enough to think I have what it takes to play an iconic native American character like Tonto. Nope, the role should have been played by a full-blooded American Indian. And Johnny, what's with the talking using mostly your upper lip?? You look like Mr. Ed when you do that. Sheesh.Armie Hammer I really cannot fault because he was given a stinker of a script and lousy direction. You give someone poop, tell them to act like poop and pretty much you get... poop. Depp helped produce this horse apple of a film, so he should shoulder a large share of the blame for it. His Tonto is anything but trusty, wise, clever, loyal & noble. Instead he's a wise-cracking smartass who treats John Reid like a burden which he (for no particular reason) has to put up with. So much for a trusted friend & companion. Both of these guys are competent actors so, IMHO, the fault lies with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and the three shmucks who wrote the gawd-awful script. Another minus is the film's musical score. Typical Hans Zimmer background noise which attempts to sound thunderingly iconic but instead ends up being a muddled mess; with lame rip-offs of Ennio Morricone's classic score for ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" and of course a watered-down (and surprisingly UNstirring) adaption of the William Tell Overture. *Yawn*On the plus side, the on-location photography does look nice, but sadly even that has been messed with; over-processed with digital scrubbing to desaturate the landscape's naturally vibrant colors. As a result, much of the beautiful southwestern scenery ends up looking dull & lifeless. A lot of the CGI stuff is pretty bad, too. The action sequences with a CGI Silver are crude and laughably AWFUL to look at, not to mention totally unbelievable and downright stupid: he appears up in the branches of a tree in one scene(!), and in another he leaps down onto and then proceeds to gallop full speed atop a moving train!?! Really? Grounded reality and even the remotest sense of believability is thrown completely out the window here. There isn't enough suspension of disbelief in the universe to make me swallow this junk. It isn't thrilling or awesome, it's just ridiculous. Sadly, poor Silver himself just seems like a tacked on afterthought instead of a rich, integral part of Lone Ranger lore. In fact, Silver's entire backstory has been jettisoned so that we can focus instead on the 'tragic' sob story the writers cooked up for this hip new Tonto's past. Ugh. The whole film just reeks of Jerry Bruckheimer doing his usual ""Let's crank everything up to '11' and that will make it a great film!"" *SIGH*I'll stick with reruns of the original TV series, thank you very much. Yes it's dated and kinda corny, but at least it treats the characters with respect instead of reducing them to laughable buffoons. 2013's The Lone Ranger is yet another perfect example of a movie's creative team NOT respecting (or understanding or caring about) the source material. If you watched this movie and just love it to death then good for you, but please don't bust my chops simply because I happen to have an opinion that differs from yours. If you've never seen the original TV series and are unfamiliar with the characters then you MIGHT be able to shut your brain off and enjoy this as just another big, noisy, mindless, Hollywood summer action flick.  However, for those of us who do remember Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels and fondly recall ""those thrilling days of yesteryear"" this movie is a massively disappointing FAIL.",1,A slap in the face to

Everybody has an opinion, but critics are paid for their opinions because it gives the &#34;average&#34; movie-goes a leg up on what's worth paying $10.00 a ticket for. I did not get to see this film in the theaters because of the awful press it was getting, it was pulled early from locations around my area. So, I took a chance and bought a copy of the DVD on it's December release date. I was not disappointed after seeing the movie. There are some things wrong with this version of The Lone Ranger, but the right things outweigh the wrong ones. In my opinion, this film lived up to the trailers as being humerous, spectacular, and most of all exciting. The Long Ranger radio and TV show was aimed at kids, but was listened to and viewed by children as a forum for learning between right and wrong in an adult world; it taught lessons and very good ones at that. It taught honesty, good was supposed to win out over bad, do not judge a person by the tint of their skin, and loality should be earned through trust and honor. The Lone Ranger of 2013 was not like the Lone Ranger of the 30's, 40's, or 50's, but it was good enough to be watched and enjoyed for what it is: Believing the myth and learning from returning &#34;to those thrilling days of yesteryear when The Lone Ranger rides again&#34;.",5,Give this movie a chance.,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1377,"['Lone', 'Ranger', 'currently', 'many', '34', 'critics', '34', 'Worst', '2013', 'lists', 'Everybody', 'opinion', 'critics', 'are', 'paid', 'opinions', '34', 'average', '34', 'movie-goes', 'leg', 'up', 'what', 'worth', 'paying', '10.00', 'ticket', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'film', 'theaters', 'awful', 'press', 'was', 'getting', 'was', 'pulled', 'early', 'locations', 'area', 'So', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'copy', 'DVD', 'December', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'are', 'things', 'wrong', 'version', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'right', 'things', 'outweigh', 'wrong', 'ones', 'opinion', 'film', 'lived', 'up', 'trailers', 'being', 'humerous', 'spectacular', 'most', 'exciting', 'Long', 'Ranger', 'radio', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'aimed', 'kids', 'was', 'listened', 'viewed', 'children', 'forum', 'learning', 'right', 'wrong', 'adult', 'world', 'taught', 'lessons', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'taught', 'honesty', 'good', 'was', 'supposed', 'win', 'out', 'bad', 'do', 'not', 'judge', 'person', 'tint', 'skin', 'loality', 'should', 'be', 'earned', 'trust', 'honor', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '2013', 'was', 'not', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '30', '40', '50', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'Believing', 'myth', 'learning', 'returning', '34', 'thrilling', 'days', 'yesteryear', 'when', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'again', '34']",The Lone Ranger

1656367,A3CALY5BP8OQ9C,B00DJYJWVW,Infinite Loop,"[7, 9]","OK, some of the CGI , stunts and special effects were a way over the top; frankly a few were just plain dumb, (like riding a horse through a railroad carriage car -- apparently no one bothered to consider the combined height of a man sitting on horseback would far exceed the maximum allowable headroom of the carriage.  But I didn't really care, I was too engaged in the action!  Do you think the Transformers could be real?  Did it really bother you  the &#34;Engineering Section&#34; of the star ship Enterprise was actually a thinly-veiled brewery as shown in the re-booted Star Trek movies?  No! Why? We were to caught up in the action.I challenge you to watch some of the early classic John Wayne westerns, like John Ford's Stagecoach (1939). The characters were bigger-than-life, as was the music, as were the scenery and photography in the desolate Monument Valley.This movie was a classic action-adventure telling a tale as old as Greek mythology. Two strangers from two different worlds are, unknowingly, on the same quest -- the need for redemption. For John Reid, it was bringing his brother's killer to justice (not a revenge-killing); for Tonto, to come to terms with the guilt of an inadvertent unintended act as young boy that, in his mind, caused the deaths of his family and tribe. John Reid was believed to have been killed and Tonto was cast out from his Comanche culture to wander alone; neither could return to his own world.The film could have over-burdened itself with the dark and serious undertones, especially regarding the treatment of Native Americans and imported Chinese slave labor (to build he railroads); proper homage was paid to both groups without getting mired down in an embarrassing and sappy politically-correct guilt trip. The comic relief offered a respite from the darkness but was a bit overdone at times. Once again, there was so much action, you really didn't care.I think the film suffered at the box office due largely to critics jumping on it from the outset. Apparently, some were upset because the film did not stick to the strict canon of the old TV/radio series; others thought it was Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-in-the-old-West. Both complaints were totally unjustified in my opinion.  Had this film been produced by someone other than Disney/Bruckheimer or starred someone other than Depp as Tonto, critics would have raved. I saw no evidence of Jack Sparrow in Depp's portrayal of Tonto though Hammer's portrayal of the Ranger seemed strained at times. Hammer was OK but just lacked the screen presence of a John Wayne or a younger Harrison Ford. The fifty-cent word they use these days is that Hammer lacked the &#34;gravitas&#34; for this kind of role.  Never the less, he held his own throughout the film even though he may have been just miscast.I gave it five stars for the story, special effects, stunt work and an engaging story.  They spared no expense (and perhaps too much) when it came to filming at locations in six different western states. This was a quality production that moved through it's story in a well-paced manner without feeling incomplete or too rushed. There were things that I didn't care for all that much but most were rather trivial or simply matters of personal taste.",5,Ignore The One / Two-Star Critics!,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,3253,"['OK', 'CGI', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'way', 'top', 'frankly', 'few', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'riding', 'horse', 'railroad', 'carriage', 'car', 'apparently', 'one', 'bothered', 'consider', 'combined', 'height', 'man', 'sitting', 'horseback', 'would', 'far', 'exceed', 'maximum', 'allowable', 'headroom', 'carriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'was', 'too', 'engaged', 'action', 'Do', 'think', 'Transformers', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'really', '34', 'Engineering', 'Section', '34', 'star', 'ship', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'actually', 'thinly-veiled', 'brewery', 'shown', 're-booted', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'No', 'Why', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'action.I', 'challenge', 'watch', 'early', 'classic', 'John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Ford', 'Stagecoach', '1939', 'characters', 'were', 'bigger-than-life', 'was', 'music', 'were', 'scenery', 'photography', 'desolate', 'Monument', 'Valley.This', 'movie', 'was', 'classic', 'action-adventure', 'telling', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'Two', 'strangers', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'are', 'unknowingly', 'same', 'quest', 'need', 'redemption', 'John', 'Reid', 'was', 'bringing', 'brother', 'killer', 'justice', 'not', 'revenge-killing', 'Tonto', 'come', 'terms', 'guilt', 'inadvertent', 'unintended', 'act', 'young', 'boy', 'mind', 'caused', 'deaths', 'family', 'tribe', 'John', 'Reid', 'was', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Tonto', 'was', 'cast', 'out', 'Comanche', 'culture', 'wander', 'alone', 'could', 'return', 'own', 'world.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'over-burdened', 'dark', 'serious', 'undertones', 'especially', 'regarding', 'treatment', 'Native', 'Americans', 'imported', 'Chinese', 'slave', 'labor', 'build', 'proper', 'homage', 'was', 'paid', 'groups', 'getting', 'mired', 'down', 'embarrassing', 'sappy', 'politically-correct', 'guilt', 'trip', 'comic', 'relief', 'offered', 'respite', 'darkness', 'was', 'bit', 'overdone', 'times', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.I', 'think', 'film', 'suffered', 'box', 'office', 'due', 'largely', 'critics', 'jumping', 'outset', 'Apparently', 'were', 'upset', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'stick', 'strict', 'canon', 'old', 'TV/radio', 'series', 'others', 'thought', 'was', 'Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-in-the-old-West', 'complaints', 'were', 'totally', 'unjustified', 'opinion', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'produced', 'someone', 'other', 'Disney/Bruckheimer', 'starred', 'someone', 'other', 'Depp', 'Tonto', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'raved', 'saw', 'evidence', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Depp', 'portrayal', 'Tonto', 'Hammer', 'portrayal', 'Ranger', 'seemed', 'strained', 'times', 'Hammer', 'was', 'OK', 'just', 'lacked', 'screen', 'presence', 'John', 'Wayne', 'younger', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'fifty-cent', 'word', 'use', 'days', 'Hammer', 'lacked', '34', 'gravitas', '34', 'kind', 'role', 'less', 'held', 'own', 'film', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'miscast.I', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'stunt', 'work', 'engaging', 'story', 'spared', 'expense', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'came', 'filming', 'locations', 'six', 'different', 'western', 'states', 'was', 'quality', 'production', 'moved', 'story', 'well-paced', 'manner', 'feeling', 'incomplete', 'too', 'rushed', 'were', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'most', 'were', 'rather', 'trivial', 'simply', 'matters', 'personal', 'taste']",The Lone Ranger

Didn't the director; producer(s); studio; ANYONE? look at the &#34;dailies&#34; while they were cranking out this overblown steamer? Where to begin? The obvious answer is Johnny Depp. Depp has been playing the same  character for, ummm, about his last 5 or 6 films. Wacky make-up, mumbling attempts at foreign accents, irritatingly quirky mannerisms, to the extreme, which I'm sure all his adoring fans, and apparently Gore Verbinsky, find s-o-o-o hilarious. More the cinematic equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. This movie gets so sidetracked with Depp's obvious &#34;You know what would be funny?

And when he is on screen, he's irritating and seemingly way over his head as the second banana to Depp's silly blathering. And that hat! That awful hat! It looks like the wardrobe designer got it at a party supply store. (How does everyone's hat stay on while fighting on top of a runaway train?) &#34;Six-shooters&#34; that never run out of bullets, anachronisms in speech patterns, boiler-plate villains that seem to bounce back from repeated beatings/ shootings/ and more beatings without a scratch.

Yet somehow it seemed to flow together quite nicely. This is the best advice I can give. If you just want to see a very entertaining stylish movie, this is definitely it. But if you're wanting to see an actual Lone Ranger movie, forget it. This is where the movie fails miserably. And this is why I hate being forced into a rating system. You see, the reason I was able to enjoy the movie so much was because I was prepped by all the trailers that this is not really a Lone Ranger movie. I mean seriously did any trailer actually look like this was going to be an epic story of The Lone Ranger? NO! Just like another reviewer mentioned how this and The Green Hornet turned the main character into a fool I was noticing the same thing, but at least this movie had a lot more imagination. And unlike the Green Hornet movie which the humor for the most part made me groan, the humor in this movie caused me to laugh out loud quite often. Here's just a little (spoiler warning). Early in the film John Reid is riding on a train, and a little girl, roughly 3 years old accidentally drops her doll. When John picks it up to give it back he naively wants to play catch toss back, but the doll gets sucked out the train window. Needless to say the little girl starts balling her eyes out. Now this is where the modern day movie writer has no clue how to seize an opportune moment and truly touch the heart of the viewer. I thought it would have been so moving, and so beautiful at the end of the movie if the Lone Ranger had somehow found that doll and brought it back to the little girl, with a family member saying ""Who was that masked man?"" then we'd hear ""HI-YO SILVER! AWAY!"" as He and Tonto ride off into the sunset and the Lone Ranger theme kicked in. But unfortunately that scene never happened.  In closing I would just like to say, if Hollywood gets the idea to actually do a respectable Lone Ranger movie, who ever they cast to play The Lone Ranger it should be kept a secret. It should be someone famous AND right for the part. All his John Reid pre Lone Ranger scenes should be either from the back of his head or his face shadowed in darkness. The Opening and Ending credits should only have ""?"" for his name. That way the general public at large can say ""WHO WAS THAT MASKED MAN?""",4,I HATE BEING FORCED INTO A RATING SOMETIMES.,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2407,"['one', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'comedy', 'grim', 'seriousness', 'sometimes', 'total', 'gross', 'out', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'flow', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'very', 'entertaining', 'stylish', 'movie', 'definitely', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'see', 'actual', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'forget', 'where', 'movie', 'miserably', 'why', 'hate', 'being', 'forced', 'rating', 'system', 'see', 'reason', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'was', 'prepped', 'trailers', 'not', 'really', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'mean', 'seriously', 'did', 'trailer', 'actually', 'look', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'epic', 'story', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'NO', 'Just', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'how', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'turned', 'main', 'character', 'fool', 'was', 'noticing', 'same', 'thing', 'least', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'imagination', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'movie', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'made', 'groan', 'humor', 'movie', 'caused', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'quite', 'often', 'Here', 'just', 'little', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'Early', 'film', 'John', 'Reid', 'riding', 'train', 'little', 'girl', 'roughly', '3', 'years', 'old', 'accidentally', 'doll', 'When', 'John', 'up', 'give', 'back', 'naively', 'play', 'catch', 'toss', 'back', 'doll', 'sucked', 'out', 'train', 'window', 'Needless', 'say', 'little', 'girl', 'balling', 'eyes', 'out', 'Now', 'where', 'modern', 'day', 'movie', 'writer', 'clue', 'how', 'seize', 'opportune', 'moment', 'truly', 'touch', 'heart', 'viewer', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'beautiful', 'end', 'movie', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'had', 'somehow', 'found', 'doll', 'brought', 'back', 'little', 'girl', 'family', 'member', 'saying', 'Who', 'was', 'masked', 'man', 'then', ""'d"", 'hear', 'HI-YO', 'SILVER', 'AWAY', 'Tonto', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'theme', 'kicked', 'unfortunately', 'scene', 'never', 'happened', 'closing', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'idea', 'actually', 'do', 'respectable', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'who', 'ever', 'cast', 'play', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'should', 'be', 'someone', 'famous', 'right', 'part', 'John', 'Reid', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'scenes', 'should', 'be', 'back', 'head', 'face', 'shadowed', 'darkness', 'Opening', 'Ending', 'credits', 'should', 'only', 'have', 'name', 'way', 'general', 'public', 'large', 'can', 'say', 'WHO', 'WAS', 'THAT', 'MASKED', 'MAN']",The Lone Ranger

The Indians finally get a fair image in this film. They are no longer the wild people, sorry animals that were depicted for so long. In fact this un acceptable image is completely put upside down and thus the truth is recaptured.The truth is that some people were ready to make a profit, and even a fortune, by all means available. There were some idealists in DC offices that were speaking of progress, humanity, good and happiness for people, etc. But in the field that was a completely different picture. Some who had power were ready to exploit workers building the railroads, essentially Chinese, as if they were slaves without the ""title."" In real life people were not shot dead when resisting, they were the victims of sorry accidents and a silver dollar was given to the widows.These people who had power in the railroad companies, and other industries, were ready to use all those who could impose work for a pittance with violence, brutal violence if necessary, guns and gunshots, if not manipulated and rigged accidents. Who was going to ask questions about dead Chinese?The Indians were in the way. So they were exterminated with the cavalry if necessary who always shot first and asked questions from the Whites about the Indians second. Or they were starved to death by the extermination of all buffaloes by people like Buffalo Bill. Or they were pushed away and locked up in reservations. All kinds of treacherous actions were possible including using outlaws disguised as Indians to attack some farmers and start a war.Add to the phenomenal profits that were to come from the railroads the fact that they found some natural resources that were worth fortunes, in this case silver and you have the magic potion that can turn the most honest and law-abiding clerk into the most aggressive criminal.But the film is also clear about the fact that all people were not like that and there were some who did believe in progress, humanity and the ""government of the people for the people by the people"" and were able to resist the hooligans who were at the head of such industrial ventures, including some women and some children, on both sides actually.When you remember the Pocahontas films who defended a myth of colonial history in Virginia, you can measure the distance that has been run by Walt Disney with this film that is honest and presented in such a way, with such special effects and with no lackluster scene or slowing down so that the interest is constantly at its maximum. Hence the film is perfect for a young audience in the summer that wants entertainment, and yet educational too.  The decolonialization, or mental decolonization, of Indians in the USA is now well on the road to success. And it all started in Alcatraz in 1969.

1656378,ADKW3AEOI6Q8U,B00DJYJWVW,Jake,"[3, 4]","When it was released, most critics despised the film. I mean, they hated it. Hated, hated, HATED, everything about this movie. I steered clear of it initially; not because I believed the &#34;hate-hype,&#34; but because I was a 21-year-old working minimum wage at Walmart that summer. I didn't have the time or money to go see it in theaters. But I had friends and family who did, and out of their mouths came a different story: The Lone Ranger is actually good. By the time I finally did get around to seeing it (a relative brought the DVD to a Christmas party), I didn't know what to expect: the heaping pile of trash the critics claimed it was; or the funny romp that my friends promised.I'm still trying to figure out why critics hated it.Th film follows John Reid, a young lawyer who returns home, and is deputized by his Ranger brother. While out attempting to catch a fugitive outlaw, the posse is gunned down by Cavendash, the man they are hunting. Tonto, an outcast Commanche, comes across their bodies, but finds John still alive. Believing John to be a &#34;spirit walker,&#34; Tonto convinces John to don a mask and hunt down Cavendash, and other wrong-doers in the West, as the vigilante known as the Lone Ranger.First off, this is not classic Lone Ranger. This is definitely a darker tale for the age of &#34;The Dark Knight,&#34; but is injected with a fair amount of humor, both self-parody (&#34;Don't ever do that again!&#34;) and straight-faced (&#34;Horse dead!&#34;), and some intense action sequences, particularly the spectacular finale, taking place onboard a pair of runaway trains.Depp and Armie Hammer play Tonto and Lone Ranger. Their chemistry is reminiscent of buddy-cop movies less like Leathal Weapon, and more like Police Academy. Depp's portrayal of Tonto is essentially Jack Sparrow filtered through a Native American, which isn't nessecarily a bad thing. And he has a bird on his head. The bird has significance to Tonto's story, yes; but leaves the question why it's on his head unanswered. But for a movie like this, the best thing you can do would be to just accept it and move on to the next gag.In all, the film is far from perfect. There are a few plot holes and &#34;plot twists&#34; that don't quite make sense. Some characters are under-utilized, and the film can be quite flippant at times. But this isn't a film made for high-brow cinema; this is like a Michael Bay film: you don't go for the acting, plot, or even for the cinematography; you go because you want to have a good time.

1656383,A32UU82TUU1VSO,B00DJYJWVW,James,"[770, 847]","I wondered why so many gave this movie a negative review when I really like this movie so I read those reviews and I'd like to address some of the more confusing aspects to the story.First the disclaimers: 1). If one goes to the super market and shops for steak and only brings home cheese, then one is diss-appointed, but if one goes for cheese and brings home some of the best cheese out there then they should feel elated. When you see this movie expect over the top action, funny sequences and a modern retake of the original interplay between the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Don't expect this to be a somber tribute or the old TV series and you'll be able to enjoy it for what it is.2). I'm only part native but I have been asked ""What tribe are you from?"" by perfect strangers before I've had the chance to speak more than three words to them.There are plenty of reviews praising this movie and some reviews which don't understand certain things. I can't shed light on everything, but let me shed light on why this movie is deeper than what most people suspect.I've been subjected to a lot of the myths and the stories from the drum circles and the dream keepers and I can shed some light on the oddities in this movie.Here's some things to keep in mind while watching this movie:Johnny Depp showed a deep sadness and a deep madness (part of being manic depressive) - Most Native Americans can say they lost a relative who died of the depression. The spirit sickness. Sometimes those who get overcome by the depression spend half their time laughing and cracking jokes and half their time wishing to die. Their minds only maintain balance if they are forced to focus on something important in their daily life. Tonto also shows hints of being an untrained shaman (as in one who didn't apprentice under an elder) and as such may be seen as just crazy even by other natives. Part of the mysticism is the balance between doubt and belief and the movie doesn't make the choice for you.The fact that this movie doesn't spell things out for people and challenges people with the ""absurd"" is a good thing in my opinion as it can get people to ask questions and to explore things. The movie presents a few mysteries which are always good and I think attempts to persuade people to research Native American culture which is also good. Here are a few things which pertain to the movie.- Medicine men of many tribes may tell you that the power of the spirit can transcend time and space... pay attention to the bag of peanuts when you watch this movie, you'll see that this is touched upon.- The term Wendigo is used to address one of the characters in the movie and it does refer to an evil spirit/alternate form of a human being... it is caused by cannibalism and both silver and boiling fat have been attributed as being weaknesses to it (by pouring boiling fat down it's throat or wounding it with silver).- The Spirit Horse is spirit made flesh and it can show up where it wants and when it wants.- When nature is out of balance, the spirit world (the Hunting Grounds) are like a reflection to the real world, evil and dark spirits can take hold of or poison the thoughts and behaviors of animals in the real world. From [...] when an individual is out of balance ""the individual experiences sickness. While this might be a physical illness, it might also manifest itself as a psychosis."" Though that passage spoke about people the same principals are applied to animals.Now onto the movie: The banter between the Lone Ranger (LR) and Tonto was awesome and reminiscent of the original series (though with a more modern looser sense of what is tolerable or not). Though it is a bit more lop-sided here (yeah Tonto shows a sharper and quicker wit than the LR, but the way Armie Hammer portrayed LR doesn't show a veteran but someone who will become the legendary Lone Ranger ... i.e. think Batman: Year One etc.).Some of the action scenes were a bit over the top and slap stick in nature, but the film doesn't dwell on these or offer them up in awkward sequences - everything seemed to fit together with great pacing.The themes showed in the movie weren't aimed at children: LR's unrequited love of his brother's wife, cannibalism, and a major battle scene all justify the PG-13 rating.The lighting helped set the mood and the photography was great.The music and sound were a bit too old school Disney family fun initially and was distracting for about the first twenty minutes of the movie, but afterwards actually helped set the mood, pacing and overall theme. (Which is a great job since people do tend to have different musical tastes - in my opinion it would have been slightly better to have the music set initially at a lower volume and then set to gradually ramp back up).It was definitely a treat to watch. The acting from both male leads was highly entertaining. I paid for my ticket to get entertained and to see an adventure and I got what I paid for.",5,From the Eyes of a part Native,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,4956,"['wondered', 'why', 'so', 'many',

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[15, 22]","The Lone Ranger, directed by Gore Verbinski, is a re-boot of the old TV series about John Reid, a ""city-man"" moving back to his home town where his brother is Sherriff. But when John, his brother and four other Texas Rangers are gunned down by Butch Cavendish and his gang, John comes back to life as a spirit walker: ""one who has been to the other side."" Now, teamed up with the Native American Tonto, Reid dons a mask and becomes The Lone Ranger, to stop Butch Cavendish and avenge his brother. But as their quest for justice uncovers a conspiracy that spans across the United States, danger lurks around every corner.The Lone Ranger, through my eyes, is what the 4th Pirates movie should have been. I won't go into the mistake that was that Pirates installment, but I will express my love and gratitude for this absolutely awesome movie. Johnny Depp is actually incredibly fantastic as Tonto, being both undeniably weird, and seriously broken. During the really dramatic, emotional scenes, you could tell Tonto was honestly a broken man, haunted by his past that had clouded his beliefs and knowledge. Armie Hammer was good as John Reid, but it was his performance that partially made this movie more fun than truly epic and incredible. Reid here is extremely goofy and Disney-esque, being a practical joke of sorts before dying and coming back. William Fichtner was haunting and disturbing as Cavendish, who is believed by Tonto to be a ""wendigo,"" an evil creature that feeds on the hearts of men (which he literally does in the movie). Gore's directing is very good, having an At World's End-feeling, but in the Old West. The cinematography was superb and award-worthy, and if it isn't nominated for at LEAST two Oscars, well, then there is no hope for the award ceremonies from here on out. Hans Zimmer's musical score is grand and epic, capturing the scope, scale and emotion perfectly, especially the rehashed and expanded William Tell Overture, which is infinitely better here. The visual effects are top-notch too, but there isn't much to begin with, so there's that.Overall, The Lone Ranger is not a classic, is far from perfect, but is a must-see and must-own for anyone who likes action/adventure, Disney, goofy comedy and westerns. I'm just so ashamed and disappointed in the film community, because this movie deserved a bigger audience.

The special effects were outstanding, the action good after the movie got going, the train sequences were excellent,and the cast-acting was splendid.  I got this mainly to see Depp, though I think he is brain dead in real life, on the silver screen heis one of the best.  Watch him in SLEEPY HOLLOW or in FROM HELL.  The lone ranger character was good, though perhaps alittle wimpy.  Perhaps this is Hollywierds was of making up for all the Indians killed the  1950s.  Make the Indian sidekick the smart one..  Anyhow, it worked well,  Being a fanatical admirer of steam locomotives, I especially enjoyed the rail road scenes.  Theproducers seemed to pay attention to detail on the trains, using the correct type of couplers on the cars, though I thought I couldsee air brake shoes on the locomotives.  In 1869 an engineer would stop a train by throttling down  and/or engaging the reversinggear.  And a Trainman would rotate the manual brake wheels on the roofs of the box cars or brake wheels on the passenger cars.Westinghouse invented the air brakes that are still in use today on some trains.Also the passenger cars were period correct types.  The principle loco used in the movie had a straight up smoke stack, indicatingit burned coal not wood.  Wood burning locos had the funnel shaped stack.  The principle loco also had 6 driver wheels, unusualat that time: the standard American loco was a 4-4-0 configuration with 4 drivers.  Still, very handsome locos, helped build thiscountry.I was disturbed with the violence at the end of the film regarding the battle between the US soldiers and the Indians.  It painedme to see all those  young men on both sides dying.  The effects were good and the train race at the end was very effective.I hope the crash was cgi and not a real loco smashed up.  And a very nice rail road bridge crash.All in all a very worthy film and anybody who likes action and see the good guys win in the end will like  this.  Like all my DVDsI got this at Amazon.

For example, if they just did the story minus the narration gimmick where an old Tonto retells the story to a kid at a fair in 1933. I kinda liked bit, but without it the movie is shorter. Maybe they could have found other ways to trim it- also, or instead?? In any case, too long.- Here's the key weakness with the movie: The Lone Ranger. Tonto is fine; I liked Johnny Depp in this role. Armie Hammer does what he can with the Lone Ranger role. The problem is that he's supposed to be a hero yet you won't find a single person who leaves the movie saying ""cool dude... I wish I could be like him..."". This is because he's an idiot. They wrote the script with the hero being a complete fool who makes stupid decisions throughout. I get the idea of the ""wrong brother"", etc, but come on! He's an idiot. As a result you don't want to be him, or care about him, you just end up plain frustrated.- Lastly, although I love westerns, I'm not sure the average person today does.

It is far from perfect but is was entertaining in its own way. I won't give way the plot as too many people have already done that. I will list the good things of the movie that I enjoyed and the bad that could have made the film better:Good:- A lot of fast action and good special effects but too much as to overwhelm the storyline.- A lot of good fight scenes- Good acting in the major roles despite what many people say- A reasonable storyline plot to the movie that was confusing at times due to the many sub plotsBad:- The movie was way too long at 2 hours and 29 minutes it could have been shorter by 30 minutes- The action was at times just over the top and it overwhelmed the storyline- The dialog in the script was just silly and poorly written- To me the Lone Ranger of my childhood was an American icon and the film made him out to be a bumbling lawman who was a lawyer. Most of his feats in the film were supposedly done by pure blind luck.- Tonto was made out to be a depressed and possibly mentally ill Indian that was an outcast even from his own tribe for being a traitor to his people- There is an attempt to make this a comedy which at times worked and at other times the script fell flat on its face.I liked the action part of the film and the acting of Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer saved the film from being a total bust. I believe that the audiences were confused on whether they were watching a western, a comedy film or a convoluted mess of a script. For me the film was a 3 1/2 stars as it started slowly and drug at times. The film should have been a total comedy or a serious remake of the Lone Ranger and Tonto saga. I personally don't know why Hollywood has to make every major character that people grew up revering into a character that acts like a clumsy incompetent clown.The film needed a film direction in what type of movie it was supposed to be as well as be done in 120 minutes.

1656425,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00DJYJWVW,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[12, 37]","Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp attempt to bring back The Lone Ranger for the modern audience, but utterly fail miserably. Admittedly I have been critical of the film, the uninspiring trailers, the one trick pony director and the obviously badly written script. Yes I have been openly critical of The Lone Ranger, but I have also tried to keep an open mind about the film even with my severe doubts about the film, because I have been proven wrong before about films before like the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, and more recently with World War Z. Both films surprised, and I had hoped that The Lone Ranger would surprise me proving my criticism of the film wrong, and at very least be if nothing else an entertaining film. Unsurprisingly I was proven correct about my criticism about The Lone Ranger as the film is a ridiculously embarrassing film with a laughably bad script, cheesy dialoged and uninspired action making the Lone Ranger one of the worst films of the year.The film opens in San Francisco in the 1930's with Will a young child dressed as the Lone Ranger visiting a Wild West museum at a carnival where he meets an aged Tonto (Johnny Depp) who tells him the story of his adventure with The Lone Ranger/John Reid (Armie Hammer). From the beginning when Tanto first meets John while he is traveling with imprisoned famed outlaw Butch Cavendish (played by the talented William Fichtner) to rescuing John after his brother Dan Reid (James Badge Dale) and his Texas Ranger posse are ambushed and killed by Cavendish and his gang to the climax on the railway with one speeding train chasing after another speeding train carrying tones of pure silver. Behind the storytelling of Tanto is the so called plot, which has to do with the transcontinental railway, and two men's goal of mining out all the silver in the mountains of Indian Territory to gain money and power.The flaws of the script are too count, but I will go over a few glaring ones that especially hurt the film. Perhaps the biggest were the scenes in San Francisco with Will and Tanto that added nothing to the film. I am not sure why Verbinski and the writers wanted to add these scenes. Maybe they wanted to convey Tanto's sadness and regret over something he did in the past, and you do see some of that in the film, but I do not think it was necessary to add these scenes when the scenes already conveyed these emotions. The writers certainly did not need to add these scenes that took away from the already bad film. Following the needless scenes that hurt The Lone Ranger was the laughable dialog. I know the writers intentionally mixed humor in with the drama and action, but many of the dialog and scenes were unintentionally funny. One example is with the so called love triangle between John, Dan and Rebecca Reid (Ruth Wilson). The supposedly romantic and dramatic scenes, and dialog between these characters were cheesy and poorly written, which is not helped that no of these characters have any chemistry together. It just sometimes felt like the writers were not sure what direction they wanted to take the film, whether to make The Lone Ranger a western comedy or a serious action western. Sadly the writers failed on both accounts.I do think The Lone Ranger could have overcome some of these flaws if not for the badly written and useless characters. Red Harrington (Helena Bonham Carter) a brothel owner is completely wasted in The Lone Ranger. Her character was only written to move two plot points forward, which is unfortunate because Helena Bonham Carter a capable actress who deserved a better role than Red. The casting of Johnny Depp as Tonto was in my opinion a poor acting choice, but he is Gore's go to actor. Depp has tried to defend his casting of Tanto by saying his partially decedent from native Americans, and maybe that is true, but I would have preferred Bruckheimer and Verbinski had actually casted a native American. I know there are not a lot of well-known native American actors in Hollywood with one being Eddie Spears from Hell on Wheels who I believe could have done a much better job playing Tanto than Depp. Even if Bruckheimer and Verbinski could not get Spears they could have found an up and coming or struggling actor for the role of Tonto, but we ended up being stuck with Depp as Tonto. Depp's performance as Tonto is just a poor characterization of Captain Jack Sparrow, and a badly performed one at that. I do not know why Depp insists on playing eccentric characters like Sparrow, Tonto or the Mad Hatter when I believe Depp delivers better performances as a more grounded character like as Donnie Brasco or George Jung in Blow. These performances as over the top eccentric characters are getting tiring, and are not entertaining as they once were. The one bright spot in the film was the character Butch Cavendish who at vicious and unapologetic, and perhaps the only character in the film that I actually enjoyed. I really enjoy William Fichtner who has given great supporting roles in The Perfect Storm, Armageddon, Prison Break and The Big Band, and think he is a highly underrated actor. In The Lone Ranger he is the polished turd in this crap fest. Fichtner delivers a strong performance as Cavendish, and gives the character life with his menacing facial expressions and dialog. I know it is wrong to root for the villain in the film, but I was hoping he would survive and win unfortunately the writers messed up again in the climax and gave the character and actor a poor farewell.Gore Verbinski directing style has become predictable I mean his past four to five films from the Pirates films to The Lone Ranger to Rango have the same tone, style and feeling to them, and just like Depp's choice to play endless weird characters it is getting tiring and played out. Here in The Lone Ranger he directs the same as his previous films, shows the same kind of action scenes and the almost the exact same type of dialog. A director is supposed to lead the film to its final destination, but Gore seems lost in his story telling meandering between one needless plot point and character to the next. It was interesting and entertaining in the first Pirates film and Rango, but now it is just not compelling at all anymore.Recently I had a discussion with someone who said that The Lone Ranger was filmed basically without any effects or CGI at all. It was laughable then and it is laughable now just not in the way you are thinking. Yes of course there are a lot of effects done by companies like ILM, but they are poorly done and ridiculously bad. There were only two scenes that I remotely enjoyed. The first was the opening action sequence on the train, and the simple action scene where The Lone Ranger and Tonto ambush Cavendish's men in a silver mine. The rest of the action scenes were poorly done, choreographed and filmed. Then there was the climax which was supposed to be compelling and entertaining, but instead was laughably bad, boring, poorly planned out, and uninteresting, which was not helped by the music that went with the scene. Perhaps the only real bright spot in the film besides Fichtner's performance was the cinematography. The Lone Ranger was filmed in New Mexico and Arizona and beautifully showcased the natural geography of the region from the desert canons to the mountains the cinematographer beautifully showcased the natural wonders of the two states.I have never wanted to walk out of a theater in a long time. I think the last film I actually walked out of was Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and I really did want to walk out of The Lone Ranger that is how bad the film was. The Long Ranger is a poorly planned out film, with terrible writing and dialog along with bad acting, effects and action, and piss poor directing with the only saving grace being William Fichtner, but even with his strong performance Fichtner could not single handedly save The Lone Ranger. I am confident without a doubt that The Lone Ranger will go down has one of the worst films of the year along with After Earth and Die Hard, highly recommend everyone avoid this film at all costs.",1,William Fichtner could not save The Lone Ranger from being a total disaster or going down as one of the worst films of the year.,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,8151,"['Jerry', 'Bruckheimer',

I'm shocked that they can't get a great franchise like the Lone Ranger correct on the screen.  First there was that horrible 80's remake, then that ho-hum 2003 TV Movie, now this.  You have Johnny Depp as Tonto, strike one.  Arnie Hammer's buffoon-like portrayal of the Lone Ranger, strike two.  And this horrible script that doesn't know if its a comedy or a western, strike three!  The movie is so uneven that it literally knocks you out of the film.  The villains are completely two-dimensional and way too silly to be scary but they go around slaughtering people, making you wonder if you should laugh or cringe.  The rangers are stereotypically scruffy, dirty and tough but completely out of place in the comedic back drop of this movie.  Tonto goes around quoting one liners with a stuffed crow on top of his head while tromping through the wild west like a Native comedian.  You later find out that his entire tribe was killed by the bad guys but you never feel the gravity of his loss because he acts so goofy throughout the whole film.  And Arnie Hammer comes off more like Judge Reinhold's dorky brother then the Lone Ranger.  He never shows any sadness that his brother was gunned down because he's too busy trying to hump his brother's wife.  And the kissing scene between the Lone Ranger and his dead brother's wife at the end of the film is a bit inappropriate!  An entire tribe of Comanches are slaughtered by the F-Troop like soldiers with a gatling gun and it evokes no emotion in either Tonto or the Lone Ranger because they are too busy doing shtick.  I know that this is an origin story, but the Lone Ranger doesn't even go into action until the last 10 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour film and it consists of him riding a horse on top of a moving train?!?  You never see The Lone Ranger shoot anyone, not even the man responsible for his brother's death?!?  The only time a silver bullet makes an appearance is when he shoots the bad guy's gun?  Why doesn't he just shoot the guy??  And his horse Silver is like some mythical magic horse who eats scorpions, huh??  Mix a completely emotionless female protagonist (who doesn't seem to care that her husband was just killed), her equally solemn son, the ridiculous yet homicidal villains, and the comedic duo of Tonto and The Lone Ranger and you end up with this mess.",1,A Tragedy!,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2398,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'over-long', 'western', '/', 'comedy', 'travesty', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'great', 'franchise', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'correct', 'screen', 'First', 'was', 'horrible', '80', 'remake', 'then', 'ho-hum', '2003', 'TV', 'Movie', 'now', 'have', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Tonto', 'strike', 'one', 'Arnie', 'Hammer', 'buffoon-like', 'portrayal', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'strike', 'two', 'horrible', 'script', ""n't"", 'know', 'comedy', 'western', 'strike', 'three', 'movie', 'so', 'uneven', 'literally', 'film', 'villains', 'are', 'completely', 'two-dimensional', 'way', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'scary', 'go', 'slaughtering', 'people', 'making', 'wonder', 'should', 'laugh', 'cringe', 'rangers', 'are', 'stereotypically', 'scruffy', 'dirty', 'tough', 'completely', 'place', 'comedic', 'back', 'drop', 'movie', 'Tonto', 'quoting', 'one', 'liners', 'stuffed', 'crow', 'top', 'head', 'tromping', 'wild', 'west', 'Native', 'comedian', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'entire', 'tribe', 'was', 'killed', 'bad', 'guys', 'never', 'feel', 'gravity', 'loss', 'so', 'goofy', 'whole', 'film', 'Arnie', 'Hammer', 'off', 'more', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'dorky', 'brother', 'then', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'never', 'sadness', 'brother', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'hump', 'brother', 'wife', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'dead', 'brother', 'wife', 'end', 'film', 'bit', 'inappropriate', 'entire', 'tribe', 'Comanches', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'F-Troop', 'soldiers', 'gatling', 'gun', 'emotion', 'Tonto', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'doing', 'shtick', 'know', 'origin', 'story', 'Lone', 'Ranger', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'action', 'last', '10', 'minutes', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'film', 'riding', 'horse', 'top', 'moving', 'train', 'never', 'see', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'shoot', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'man', 'responsible', 'brother', 'death', 'only', 'time', 'silver', 'bullet', 'appearance', 'when', 'shoots', 'bad', 'guy', 'gun', 'Why', ""n't"", 'just', 'shoot', 'guy', 'horse', 'Silver', 'mythical', 'magic', 'horse', 'who', 'scorpions', 'huh', 'completely', 'emotionless', 'female', 'protagonist', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'husband', 'was', 'just', 'killed', 'equally', 'solemn', 'son', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'homicidal', 'villains', 'comedic', 'duo', 'Tonto', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'end', 'up', 'mess']",The Lone Ranger

Sure it had a few light-hearted, goofy parts.  However, the story that that was told was quite serious, yet without taking itself too seriously.  The Lone Ranger was everything that a moviegoer could want in a summer film and you walk out with this feeling that it was not at all a waste of time and money.  If people are looking for a thought-provoking, deep, philosophical and metaphysical film, then maybe you should watch ""Cloud Atlas"" instead.  ""The Lone Ranger"" is not that type of film and wasn't intended to be.

I have seen a great deal of movies in my lifetime; so I can usually tell when a movie is going to be good or bad. I did not see the movie After Earth. Why? Because it does not look like it is worth the price of admission. And judging by the reviews, it does not look like a rental either. The Lone Ranger was a movie I had been looking forward to for quite some time now.  Was it as good as I hoped?  Lets take a look.The Lone Ranger stars Johnny Depp as Tonto. We also have the guy who (almost played Batman) ArmieHammer as John Reid. Supporting cast consists of Tom Wilkinson as Latham Cole, Rurh Wilson as Rebecca Reid, William Fichtner as the primary antagonist Butch Cavendish ,(great performance)  and Helena Bonham Carter makes minor appearances as Red Harrington. The cast did a decent enough job; more notably Johnny Depp and William Fichtner.The storyline is set in both the 1800s and the early 1900s, in part, because the story itself is being told; or rather narrated. There are some funny moments, the action (for the time and setting) is well put together; andfor the most part, it does feel like a western movie. Unfortunately for the movie itself, there are some problems present.The running time for this movie is almost 150 minutes. And that does not help this particular movieAT ALL. If this movie had been 10-20 minutes shorter, it probably would have been a better movie. This is not The Dark Knight and this is not The Lord of the Rings. This movie is called The Lone Ranger.Another problem is that The Lone Ranger while, it is funny at times, can not decide what type of movie it is exactly. Not only that, it does not always take itself seriously as a movie.There are times when Armie Hammer seems to lack the focus and charisma to play his character. He did an ok job, but another actor could have easily played his role. Johnny Depp did a good job; although i feel William Fichtner's character was more enjoyable. And although this is not a highlight in Johnny Depp's filmography, and certainly not one of my favorites, some people will find that they enjoy this movie nonetheless.The Lone Ranger is a movie I would possibly buy on sale, maybe even at a black Friday sale. But it is not a movie I would pay full price for.

Great cinematography, great music, a nice twist on the myth (which I rushed home from school daily to hear on the radio over 70 years ago), enough humor to poke a bit of fun at being a myth, serious enough to make your heart pound.  Ignore the critics and do not miss this film.  I cheered loudly at its conclusion in rural Texas where you don't make noise in movie theaters.  I joyfully expressed appreciation for those too shy to do so.Eighty years ago the Lone Ranger myth was created: a man committed to justice under the law discovers that those in control of the law are using it for their personal gain and therefore decides to become an ""outlaw.""  Perhaps my preference for this myth over that of other action heroes/heroines has to do with my age and having been reared on a farm and riding horses in the Texas Panhandle.  But I think there is a decided gift in the down-to-earth quality of this particular myth.  I also like that it features a couple, not a single person, and that the partner is a native of the land, one grounded in earth tradition and representing those severely oppressed by encroaching forces who are not grounded in the earth.  So check out the Lone Ranger creed.  Here's the core of it:*  That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world*  That 'this government of the people, by the people, and for the people' shall live always.*  That men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number.It needs to be edited for exclusive language, and of course it would be good to have a female ranger, but otherwise it holds up pretty well.

1656463,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B00DJYJWVW,jude pepper,"[4, 7]","just why is it that the judgements of the professional critics are so often so unreliable?well, like most riddles in this world, i daresay we're not gonna get anywhere looking for easy ""pat"" answers. but one key element is that for some reason they never seem to believe in middle-ground. everything is always either a wonderful masterpiece or a colossal turd. that's one reason for why THE LONE RANGER was the most maligned and persecuted film of the year.the other reason, the poor box office performance and money it didn't make, is alas more tangible. but as i've mentioned in such other reviews as THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION and THE SHADOW, quality of product and box office performance are NOT the joint factors some would like you to think.so what about THE LONE RANGER? yes it is an imperfect film, most obviously in being a good 15 or 20 minutes longer than it really needed to be. but hey, haven't we all seen films which had their flaws, or which took directions other than those we ourselves would've taken, and enjoyed them anyway? pure an' simple, this is one of those films that should've been applauded and celebrated, but were defeated by rumor and resultant juggernaught. i can't help but remember that the audience i saw the film with in the theatre were havin' a gay ol' time.as our hero first arrives, returning from law school, it turns out he's been softened into a ""tenderfoot"" and has to relearn how to live in the West. this may not fall in line with the Clayton Moore version, but it works in it's way. Armie Hammer's portrayal has an ""everyman"" quality that Moore never had, and where Moore's take was a ready-made ""champion of justice,"" here circumstance has to gradually mold John Reid into a hero. so however else Hammer compares to Moore, there's something profound and poetic here that the Clayton Moore series can't offer you.the liberties it takes with Tonto are on shakier ground. simply put, the ""faithful Indian companion"" as portrayed by Johnny Depp has his ""issues."" there's a certain poignancy to his lingering guilt concering a major screw-up from his childhood, but it could well of turned him into a loony. there's a majesty to his suggestion that Lone Ranger-to-be John Reid is an enchanted ""Spirit Walker"" destined by prophesy to bring law and reason to the untamed frontier, but this of course turns out to be delerium. and of course his choice of headwear (a dead bird) isn't exactly precedented. but the good news is that, as does Hammer with the Ranger, Depp does prove to have as much nobility and reliability lurking somewhere in his version of the character as had Jay Silverheels so many decades before. also, Depp brings a surprising charm to his scenes with a young fan at a carnival in 1933. (the year the original radio series premiered, for those of you who don't know their homages.)the story itself is admittedly convoluted in spots, but it has a wonderful Western flavor on the whole. it may be a bit louder and more rambunctious than was altogether necessary, but not unlike VAN HELSING, it offers something worthwhile if you'll look past all that bombast. if nothing else, Depp and Hammer have, maybe not absolute chemistry, but some degree to be sure.i can't help but reflect upon the 1981 film THE LEGEND OF THE LONE RANGER. that rather understated production might seem a few hundred miles removed from this Jerry Bruckheimer extravaganza, but the two do have one significant thing in common: LEGEND too was maligned and a box office failure, again for no more substantial reason than because the juggernaught had started rolling against it. (the most cited point against it, after all, is that it's star, one Klinton Spilsbury, never managed to make another film appearance. which of course doesn't have a great deal to do with the movie itself.) yet that film survived to be readily available on DVD today, so i daresay there's hope for this version to enjoy similar staying power.if Superman can work on both the modest television budget of George Reeves and in the epic cinematic grandeur of Christopher Reeve, if Sherlock Holmes can be represented in both B-movies starring Basil Rathbone and lavish period productions starring Jeremy Brett (to say nothing of ballsy updates starring Benedict Cumberbatch), why can't The Lone Ranger be just as flexible?let he who has never enjoyed a film in spite of it's imperfections and/or box office failure cast the first stone!!",4,"in a nutshell, The Critics Are Morons!!!",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,4441,"['just', 'why', 'judgements', 'professional', 'critics', 'are', 'so',

It truly is a wonderful movie and for people my age (69) it will bring tears to your eyes when The William Tell Overture begins in what has to be the best climax scene in movie history. Armie Hammer on Silver galloping down the top of a train will never be surpassed. I know, I know, it was trick photography, but it is fantastic nonetheless. As for the translation of Kemo Sabey, it means ""Trusty Scout.""  That's what it meant when I was a kid, and that's what it means now.

Well, the Lone Ranger fans were ready and cannot believe all the bad press from moronic critics who almost never get it right anyway.

I don't believe the Transcontinental RR went through Texas or Comanche territory, at least not the original section.

Having been too young to watch and listen to the original lone ranger series when it originally was aired, I did as a kid see them as reruns, I can see where the criticisms come from when comparing the two as this is not what I would consider the Lone Ranger as it was originally intended. With that being said, if you strictly compare the two, then yes this version will fail to live up to your expectations, especially if you grew up on the original. But if view this as something different, then this movie although not a classic, is fun and entertaining. Yes the character interaction and lines are a bit campy, the action over the top, and the movie a bit too long at times but it did keep me entertained. I did think the flashbacks (or flash forwards as they were) with the little boy at the carnival were a bit distracting from the movie and really felt out of place and kind of ruin the pacing of the film. I would almost compare this movie as a mix of Wild Wild West (which this movie is better) and Pirates of the Carribean (which this movie is not as good as). This movie has a mix of light-hearted humor, sarcasm, and some violence and tries to entertain all ages, which actually I think it is its biggest problem.

But this film is just SO long and a constant assault on the senses that I just really didn't feel like sitting through it a second time, and I'm relieved that I only rented it. It IS good, it's just not great. You get a BIG action pay-off right up front, then a bloated and detailed plot/story/exposition middle, then at the end -- maybe as long as 30 mins' worth -- some of the most explosive, waaaaaay over-the-top, acrobatic-stunt action scenes I've ever seen. It's relentless. But still, it's just too long. I got to the 2-hour point and had to restrain myself from FFWDing it just to finally find out how it actually ends. There are huge chunks of it that could have been easily done away with completely, or at least cut way down; ie, Helena Bonham Carter.I knew ahead of time that it would be like ""Pirates of the Mojave Desert"" so I sat down expecting a parody of all sorts of historical/geographical/cultural elements. Like ""Pirates,"" it's heavy on the comedy, funny lines and wordplay, some slapstick, some situational. It's almost like a live-action cartoon. Johnny Depp, of course, is the primary reason to watch this, though Armie Hammer is a super-adorable guy and a pleasantly amusing comic actor who has a great career ahead of him. Johnny Depp, in spite of his leading-man looks, is at his best playing wacky, comic, character parts like this one and he plays Cap'n Tonto as cleverly as he played Cap'n Jack. The film is about half ""character"" parts and half ""straight"" characters and each are played to their perfect extreme. You can't fault the film on its cast; it's a terrific lineup of talented actors. There is some gore, which was kind of unexpected in a Disney film; parents will have to decide about their under-13 children's sensitivity to such content individually.As in too many movies, the ""Extras"" parts on the DVD -- the outtakes and behind the scenes parts -- are actually more entertaining than the actual movie.",3,It's worth watching; cast is really good,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,2128,"['First', 'tall', 'normally', 'watch', 'film', '2', '3', 'times', 'reviewing', 'here', 'purpose', 'discovering', 'finer', 'subtler', 'points', 'might', 'have', 'escaped', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'just', 'SO', 'long', 'constant', 'assault', 'senses', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sitting', 'second', 'time', ""'m"", 'relieved', 'only', 'rented', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'get', 'BIG', 'action', 'pay-off', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'then', 'bloated', 'detailed', 'plot/story/exposition', 'middle', 'then', 'end', 'maybe', 'as', 'long', '30', 'mins', 'worth', 'most', 'explosive', 'waaaaaay', 'over-the-top', 'acrobatic-stunt', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'relentless', 'still', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'got', '2-hour', 'point', 'had', 'restrain', 'FFWDing', 'just', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'actually', 'are', 'huge', 'chunks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'done', 'away', 'completely', 'least', 'cut', 'way', 'ie', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter.I', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'Pirates', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'so', 'sat', 'down', 'expecting', 'parody', 'sorts', 'historical/geographical/cultural', 'elements', 'Pirates', 'heavy', 'comedy', 'funny', 'lines', 'wordplay', 'slapstick', 'situational', 'almost', 'live-action', 'cartoon', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'course', 'primary', 'reason', 'watch', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'super-adorable', 'guy', 'pleasantly', 'amusing', 'comic', 'actor', 'who', 'great', 'career', 'ahead', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'spite', 'leading-man', 'looks', 'best', 'playing', 'wacky', 'comic', 'character', 'parts', 'one', 'Cap', 'n', 'Tonto', 'as', 'cleverly', 'played', 'Cap', 'n', 'Jack', 'film', 'half', 'character', 'parts', 'half', 'straight', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'perfect', 'extreme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'cast', 'terrific', 'lineup', 'talented', 'actors', 'gore', 'was', 'kind', 'unexpected', 'Disney', 'film', 'parents', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'under-13', 'children', 'sensitivity', 'such', 'content', 'individually.As', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'Extras', 'parts', 'DVD', 'outtakes', 'scenes', 'parts', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'entertaining', 'actual', 'movie']",The Lone Ranger

Being a fan of the true old west I was really impressed by the costuming throughout the film.The story is vaguely like most westerns; revenge for the slain brother, justice for the widow and friendship between two unlikely men, but woven through it are several subplots that bring the characters depth.The stunt scenes are epic.

Putting a dress on Jesse Ventura does not transform him into Lady Gaga, any more than titling this film &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; makes it such. Beyond using the oft repeated moniker, any similarity between this story and the Lone Ranger chronicle is casual at best and irrelevant for its purpose. The secret, therefore, is realizing that this film is NOT a platform for the Lone Ranger legend and should be judged accordingly. Any evaluative judgment of its merits and deficiencies should be made independently of its source name and weighed for what it is&#8230; a stand-alone western, meandering along its own course.A myriad of influences provide this film with its core essence. Some of &#8220;A Little Big Man&#8221;, Keaton&#8217;s &#8220;The General&#8221;, and the Indiana Jones trilogy combine with a sprinkling of &#8220;The Guns of Navarone&#8221; and &#8220;The Bridge over the River Kwai&#8221; in providing us with a moderately entertaining film which often overextends its boundaries in a search for a stable horizon. While sometimes overreaching and predictable, the actors, and Johnny Depp in particular parlay a simple premise into a film that should be enjoyed and appreciated for what others often portray as lacking. Not to be ever confused with a classic within the genre, it nonetheless clearly meets its goal of providing a fun story to be enjoyed and appreciated on its own terms and merits.

1656512,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00DJYJWVW,K. Reynolds,"[1, 3]","I HAD BIG HOPES when I heard the creative crew behind Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; franchise planned to reboot this Western classic with executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, to star Johnny Depp.I love Westerns. From &#8220;Shane&#8221; to &#8220;Tombstone,&#8221; I&#8217;m there. And so I was for &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; but what a mess. It&#8217;s not so much a bad Western as plain old bad story-telling.Any genre movie can be ruined by an excess of subplots and useless characters &#8211; like the madam played by Helena Bonham Carter, who makes a big show of her trick leg made of scrimshawed whale bone. It comes in handy in an end stunt, but other than that, she&#8217;s got nowhere to go and nothing to do. General Custer appears midway, again demonstrating what an insufferable ass he was. (The film is loaded with clich&eacute;s.) Depp&#8217;s Tonto, shown as an old man in a carnival show, narrates the story in a way to delay or break action. His make-up makes sense but stays in place throughout all calamities; we all know the stuff just doesn't work that way. When the real Native Americans show up, it makes Depp&#8217;s Tonto less than genuine, despite his heritage. Worst of all, Armie Hammer&#8217;s Lone Ranger spends so much time being a comic doofus, he never makes a credible transition to hero. There&#8217;s no chemistry between Depp and Hammer. Mean jokes, yes; chemistry, no.A personal gripe is the ugly thugs who like to wear bits of lady&#8217;s clothing. It wasn't that funny in the Caribbean and falls flat here.Still, the good stuff is very good. Tonto has a heartbreaking and believable backstory. Bruckheimer and Verbinski give us some fun through big-time stunts, many of which have that comic edge we saw in &#8220;Pirates.&#8221; The villain is a nightmare: Butch Cavandish, a scar-faced bandit cannibal played by William Fichtner. Tonto tells John Reid (Hammer), the Lone Ranger-in-training, that Cavandish is a wendigo, a creature from Native American lore described as a man who becomes a demon from eating human flesh. There&#8217;s a missing scene between Tonto and John Reid after we learn more about the Ranger&#8217;s sidekick.That&#8217;s the kind of juice that could have given this reboot a genuine kick.It&#8217;s easy to like Hammer, the actor. He is so enthusiastic, taking us through the &#8220;Armie&#8217;s Western Roadtrip&#8221; extra, giving a tour of shooting locations in New Mexico. &#8220;Becoming a Cowboy&#8221; shows how the actors learned to ride a horse, use a lariat and fire weapons in Cowboy Boot Camp. &#8220;Riding the Rails of The Lone Ranger&#8221; demos how to shoot action scenes atop moving trains (don&#8217;t try this at home). One deleted scene and bloopers round out the bonus features. DVD people should note that the bloopers are the only extra on the disc. There is no commentary.Word is that Disney did not renew the project development contract with Bruckheimer because of &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8217;s&#8221; poor showing in theaters. It is difficult to understand how the film was released in the shape it&#8217;s in. This is a huge company and Bruckheimer&#8217;s team is made up of experienced professionals. Surely a good editor could have streamlined the story and given Hammer some points on how to be a hero.Meanwhile, we have a beautiful, high-def picture, showing gorgeous location shots and outstanding sets, with a truly magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.

1656556,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B00DJYJWVW,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[2, 8]","The same Disney ""Pirates of the Carrabian"" production team is back. That is producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Amazing Race, Armageddon), Director Gore Verbinski (The Mexican, The Ring) and the Star and Executive Producer himself Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Finding Neverland) have come together again to bring another legendary character back to life in this modern 21st century day and age and I'm sure in their hopes - another $$$ franchise.The movie itself is way too long for what it has to offer. The story is weak and almost so thin it may lead you to think, `what IS the story here', but the overriding factor that makes it tolerable is Johnny Depp playing Tonto himself. Whenever he is on screen you just can help but be drawn into him. He is exactly as funny as you would think. He is heroic. He is amazingly talented in his craft and always visually interesting to look at as he created the character visually himself. Johnny Depp is the only real interesting character in this film that keeps you hooked.Written by Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road, Snitch), Ted Elliot (Legend of Zorro, Pirates Films) and Terry Rossio (Laundry, Deja Vu), the story reworks the legend a little and try's real hard to make a strong dramatic point about a man who loses his family in the name of the law to a somewhat corrupt character named Cole, played marvelously by Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton, Batman Begins).Playing the title character of John Reid aka The Lone Ranger is Armie Hammer (The Social Network, Mirror, Mirror) who gives it a go at trying to be witty and funny, but his acting chops against Depp, he just can't keep up. He is a charming and tall in stature, but doesn't have the screen warmth and debonairness that this heroic character needs and was originally written like. Ruth Wilson (Saving Mr. Banks, Luther) plays his sister-in-law and the unannounced requited love of John Reid, known even to his brother, who was played quite well by James Badge Dale (Departed, Iron man 3), is almost a throw away part of the story.Enter the sharp shooting, evil minded and fairly gross looking villain Butch Cavendish played brilliantly by William Fichtner (Contact, The Dark Knight) who is one of those actors who amazingly transforms himself into his characters. In fact it's Depp and Fichtner that make this movie worth watching. Everything else runs slow and a little pointless.There's a lot of action, gunfights and some fairly law of physics-defying stunts and explosions that occur, but sprinkled it all with Depp's humor and Fichtner's gross evilness, and it makes it more than slightly above fantasy/believable. The vistas of the southwest desert were very well photographed and beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Bojan Bazelli (Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the Ring) did an amazing job with the photography. The film does looks great!The other narrative thing they do is the entire history of The Lone Ranger is told through the story-telling abilities of a very old (and I thought he was a wax figure) Tonto (Depp) to a young boy in a museum like environment. So what happens?  They keep cutting back and forth, in and out of the story, to take you to various stages of the dynamic duo's initial meetings. It did get a little old after a while.

And it was also great that they used it sparingly and ONLY at the right moment for heightened effect. Nice touch!5) I liked the bad guy - I don't know who he is, but he was &#34;good&#34;.Now what I didn't like about this flick:1) Though both actors did a fine job, in many parts were their portrayals simply cheesy, campy, and over-the-top. Just too cartoonish for my taste.2) The dialogue - some of the exchanges amongst the characters were just (oh, there is that word again!)...CHEESY!And for the BIGGEST culprit of this flick....the Lone Ranger is SNIVELING WIMP.Yes, that is correct.

The posse are ambushed and all but the brother are killed, he is rescued by Tonto and a rather amazing horse (who has some fun moments in the film) and becomes the lone ranger as part of his quest for justice.The film is well shot and while it's reasonably long it doesn't feel drawn out.

1656613,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B00DJYJWVW,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[10, 22]","The Lone Ranger is a movie I've been looking forward to since I first heard that the masked western hero would be brought back to the big screen. My wife and I just came back from seeing the New Disney/Brukheimer Lone Ranger and boy was I disappointed.The movie stars Armie Hammer (great-grandson of billionaire Armand Hammer and movie/publishing mogul Michael Armand Hammer) as John Reid, a morally upright lawyer returned to Texas from the big city where he studied law. He's set to become the new prosecutor, bringing justice to his old home town. But the train carrying him back to Colby, Texas is also carrying two prisoners: outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and Comanche Indian Tonto (Johnny Depp). With the help of someone who hid a gun in the floor of the prison transport car, Cavendish manages a bloody escape. John Reid incompetently tries to stop the escape, and nearly gets himself and Tonto killed. Butch flees into the wilderness with a gang of vicious killers. Dan Reid, John's brother and the local sheriff, forms a posse to go after them. John volunteers to join the posse but refuses to carry a gun (what good is an unarmed rider in a posse chasing vicious killers?). The posse is betrayed and every last member killed. John Reid is shot and apparently resurrected by Tonto and a white Spirit Horse. Tonto make him a mask from his brother's vest and tries to convince him that his destiny is to become an instrument of justice. John Reid and Tonto track down Cavendish, who also killed Tonto's tribe. The young lawyer prevents the Indian from taking revenge, but when he delivers Cavendish to the authorities, it's John Reid who finds himself running from corrupt authorities. John must take up the mask and take justice into his own hand.While this movie had a lot going for it, it fell short on so many levels. Here are my main criticisms:(1) The story....The Lone Ranger is told as a series of flashbacks with an aged Tonto (working in a carnival) telling the story to a little boy dressed as the Lone Ranger. I can only think of two movies where this device worked, Little Big Man and Citizen Cane. This movie was no Little Big Man nor was it Citizen Cane. The flashback as story sequencing just didn't work. Later still, the movie included a flashback within a flashback (a device I've only seen used in the terrible Dragon Wars).(2) The humor...In this movie humor was pretty much limited to the slapstick kind. Given the types of laughs the writers and director went for, this movie could have starred Kevin James and Will Farrell. When looking back at the combination of slapstick and violence, the movie that Lone Ranger seems most comprable to his Seth Rogan's Green Hornet. But the violence in Green Hornet is less disturbing. I found the combination of slapstick humor and gratuitous violence a little disconcerting. I love a good laugh but this movie mixed slapstick tomfoolery with wholesale massacres.(3) Violence...first of all I'm not one of those people who decry movie violence. If you're playing The Magnificent Seven, Reservoir Dogs or Wild Geese on the big screen I'll be the first one to come over for movie night. But there was a certain cognitive dissonance to the violence in this movie that I bothered me. Extreme violence is depicted and even more is insinuated. An entire posse is gunned down, the sheriff's heart is cut out, and the Comanche army is annihilated. Yet the Lone Ranger barely shoots his gun and never actually shoots anyone. For some reason it's OK for him to crush a villain under a train but intolerable for him to shoot a villain even when that villain is about to murder an innocent.(4) Geography...the movie takes place in Texas. But much of the scenery is clearly Utah or Colorado. Do they not know what Texas looks like (no jagged mountains), or did they think that guys on foot and horseback would wander out of Texas and into the Rockies in just a few hours?(5) Guns...If you've ever gone target shooting, you know that putting a bullet in a target is a lot harder than it looks, even with a modern target pistol. Using a .45 caliber single action pistol is multiples harder. John Reid returns to Texas as the anti-gun lovechild of Michael Bloomberg and Rosie O'Donnell. He doesn't believe in guns and hasn't held a gun in 8 years. There's no place for men who carry guns in the new law abiding west. When deputized as a peace officer, he refuses to carry a gun...and he's going after a gang of murderers. Yet by the second time he picks up a gun he's making impossible shots from the back of a moving horse. And ne never runs out of bullets and never has to reload.(6) Casting...The one thing this movie had going for it was Johnny Depp; he did a great job as Tonto even if it did cost a Native American actor a job. If I were casting this movie I would have cast Adam Beach (but I would have made a different movie). Because his dialogue was so bad, I really can't tell if Armie Hammer is capable of acting. Hammer didn't carry the role but the writers didn't give him much to work with. Ruth Wilson plays John's sister-in-law and an object of lust by the villain. She seemed to be making the ducklip-face throughout the movie.With slapstick comedy, violence galore, top notch digital effects, and a massive budget, the makers of The Lone Ranger were hoping for another franchise to rival Pirates of the Caribbean. In fact, the brothel scene seemed like it was taken directly from POTC. But because this movie tried to be all things to all people, it will probably end up being nothing to most movie viewers. I will be very surprised if it becomes a franchise.",2,The Lone Ranger misses its target,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,5643,"['Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'first',

1656614,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00DJYJWVW,Miles D. Moore,"[11, 22]","There's no question that ""The Lone Ranger"" is exactly the movie director Gore Verbinski and the Disney organization set out to make. It is very much taken from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" playbook. There are some funny gags throughout the movie, as well as spectacular runaway train sequences at the beginning and end, ensuring full employment for the stuntmen's union. Johnny Depp is very funny as Tonto--nobody does a better deadpan stare than he does--and there are good supporting performances by Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner and Tom Wilkinson. Also, the horse playing Silver is the best equine thespian since Lee Marvin's nag in ""Cat Ballou.""Unfortunately, all praise must end here. The middle of the story sags, largely because Verbinski & Co. care far more about their set pieces than about creating a coherent story or consistent characters. The real victim here is Armie Hammer in the title role. Hammer is a likable and accomplished actor, but Verbinski gives him no role to play. Essentially, the scriptwriters change the Lone Ranger's character to fit whatever they want him to be or do at the time. At times he's a goody-twoshoes and total klutz; at others he's unbelievably mean and unlikable, particularly in one sequence where the Ranger and Tonto are buried up to their necks by the Comanches. Only at the end is he truly a hero, and it just doesn't fit with what we've learned about the character up to then.The framing device Verbinski creates--about a little boy encountering the aged Tonto at a Wild West show in 1933--also doesn't work. It's confusing and adds nothing to the story, and would have been better left on the cutting-room floor.Verbinski recycles material wholesale from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""  movies, even to the point of having one of the bad guys dressing up in drag. Apparently he and the producers (of whom Depp was one) were counting on audiences being satisfied with a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequel in cowboy costume.

This is a spectacularly filmed journey with realistic (CGI) locales, costumes and colors reminiscent of the old west......and who can overlook the crusty, unshaven, filthy bad guys who execute their roles with indifference and speak with parsed English!  The plot centers around the expansion of the Railroad, the uneasy peace with the Comanche Nation and the unheralded arrival of the town's new Attorney (Armie Hammer).  All the pieces will be thrown together with daring escapes, deadly ambushes, Indian uprising and the most action packed , hysterically funny, dynamic train chase sequence ever filmed.  Our hero, who by a series of misfortunes and tragedies, evolves as the  mask-wearing avenger for &#34;justice&#34; who develops an uneasy alliance with the odd Indian loner, Tonto.  I believe this film faired poorly at the box office because audiences have become accustomed to the image of a &#34;super hero&#34;--the He-man who wins the girl, dispenses the evil doers and all doing so with the most spectacular special effects available.  I don't think many people are ready to laugh at characters who are fallible and funny amidst gunfights, explosions and moments of seriousness.

The impression that I was left with was the objective of this movie was to ridicule the traditional image and reputation of the Lone Ranger.  The traditional image as I have come to know it, is an image of a bold, street-smart and intelligent cowboy who carried out justice in the pattern that Wyatt Earp did or that Karl did in Lonesome Dove.  But in this movie it seemed that the Lone Ranger theme was manipulated to actually portray someone who is not the Lone Ranger of the past movies but just some nincompoop whose name just happens to be the Lone Ranger.  I was disappointed with the movie's portrayal of the Lone Ranger and Tonto.  This movie should be done again and bring in a stronger characterization of both Tonto and the Lone Ranger.

The first time I saw a still of Johnny Depp in his Tonto makeup with the stuffed crow on his head I said to myself, I've gotta see this. Then, after seeing it in the theater, I thought it was so extremely fantastic in every way that I had to go back a couple of days later to make sure it really was as good as I'd remembered.I like the way this film takes time-honored cliches of the Western film and uses them as a solid framework for a very unique, creative and eclectic take on the Western. You've got so much going on here, with the parable of the corporate raider versus the unlikely alliance of the left-wing lawyer turned outlaw and the rogue Native American libertarian (I'm thinking Mitt Romney versus Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul.) But most enchanting to me is Johnny Depp's tragicomic Tonto, who I think is his finest character to date.

1656635,A3QQG36VOYQB5U,B00DJYJWVW,MurphtheSurf,"[15, 22]","At the end of The Lone Ranger, a sizable portion of a largely appreciative audience stayed to view the credits of this much maligned bit of summer fun. I was not surprised. From the first moments of the film, the audience clearly was enjoying it- a lot. No restlessness, but lots of laughter, enthusiastic comments, and the sense that the film had the audience's complete attention immediately neutralized the critics negative buzz. As people left the theater they talked about how wrong the critics were and more than a few, including me, planned to see it again. In the days that followed my friends and I kept quoting lines from it- mostly from Tonto.Ten years ago, director Gore Verbinski and star Johnny Depp created one of the all-time best summer blockbusters, &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.&#34; It was funny, slick, bright, brisk, lighthearted and exciting &#8212; much like the Lone Ranger.&#34;The Lone Ranger,&#34; is a bit of romantic western lore about a masked cowboy hero and his &#8220;faithful Indian companion&#8221; who was created in 1933 for radio and has since appeared on TV, movie serials, in juvenile boys' novels and in comic books. This Lone Ranger does not stray far from its origins. In fact, I was struck by how close the screenplay for the film stuck to that of the radio serial.The plot-heavy story involves a murderous silver thief (William Fichtner) with a scarred &#34;Jonah Hex&#34;-like face, an evil corporate railroad man (Tom Wilkinson), a romance with a young widow (Ruth Wilson) plus revenge and destiny.Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger is chiseled, handsome and heroic, but a doofus who does not understand the nature of life in this very wild West. He has very few of the skills needed to be a hero. His brother has them, but his death (along with most of his posse) is the starting point of the Lone Ranger&#8217;s halting journey into heroism. Tonto (Johnny Depp) has been searching for a partner and thought he found one in the great warrior who is now dead. He gets stuck with his inept younger brother who he calls Ke-mo sah-bee (which might mean either &#8220;trusted friend&#8221; or &#8220;wrong brother&#8221; or both). The name &#8220;Tonto&#8221; also has more than one translation, &#8220;wild one&#8221; or &#8220;fool&#8221; or both.What is unique about this version of the Lone Ranger story is that it is Tonto&#8217;s story. He is its principal character, its narrator, and its guardian. The story is told by him in his old age to a young boy dressed as the Lone Ranger at a Wild West Show. Depp conjures up a sympathetic Tonto, the guru for the Lone Ranger, with face paint and a bird headdress based on a Native American painting called &#34;I Am Crow.&#34; His deadpan delivery of almost all of the best  lines in the film works very well and yet the other characters remain memorable.Depp creates a real inner world for the kooky, mystical character, anchored in an all too likely atrocity against his people when he was a child. That atrocity is mirrored later in the film when members of his tribe take on gatling guns.The agent who transforms Tonto and the Ranger into an effective team (and seemingly imbues the hapless Ranger with a whole new set of skills essential for a hero) is the &#8220;Spirit Horse&#8221; who chooses the Ranger and is every bit as crazy as Tonto. The horse? Silver, of course.It's all here: &#34;William Tell Overture&#34; theme music, beautifully photographed canyons, and a couple of exhilarating chase and fight sequences (just enough really given the tendency of summer films to over-indulge in madcap, often senseless action).In the last moments of the film, the nave attorney reborn as the masked hero proclaims &#8220;Hi-Yo, Silver!  Away,&#34; as he rears up his horse waving his hat in the iconic greeting from the TV show. He looks quite silly in doing so Tonto tells him, &#34;Don't ever do that again.&#34; A great punch line. I hope it is not a prophetic one.

Both characters have had their belief of fair living and justice violated by corruption and it becomes their quest to avenge these wrong doings.The cinematography provides some breathtaking scenes and out of all the Lone Ranger works this version probably contains heavier violence than the others, however the narrative contains some clever and entertaining moments which balances out the movie.Nicholas R.W.

1656655,A3D7XHEPZGD8UY,B00DJYJWVW,No BS guy,"[3, 5]","I've grown far too tired of politically correct Hollywood films.  Even though a decent, if a bit overblown, action film, I've growing tired of Hollywood's slavish committment to political correctness.  While I think it was good to flesh out Tonto and make him a true partner to the Lone Ranger, this could have been done without diiminishing the Lone Ranger character.  Instead, as with &#34;the Green Hornet&#34;, the title hero is just some stupid white guy buffoon who amounts to nothing until his ethnic sidekick teaches him to fight.  While the Ranger catches on quickly, he really didn't need to start out as a fool.Second problem in my mind was the identity issue.  One of the main points of being the lone ranger was that no one really knows who he is.  In this movie, everyone knows who he is.  There really was no need to wear the mask.More political correctness comes in the form of the indians and the millitary.  Simply said: military bad; indians good.  The military guys are doing the bidding of the bad guys and therefore are villians.  Unlike the actual military in the Indian wars, they were all white.  In the real Indian wars, many were African Americans-the so called &#34;buffalo soldiers&#34;- but to include them would break Hollywood racial sterotypes so the military is portrayed as all white and all bad.  The Indians are the good guys, but, in this movie, they are stupid.  The plains Indians were some of the best guerilla fighters in history, using hit and run tactics and never attacking positions of overwhelming force.  Yet, the Indians in this movie charge right into the gatling guns and are slaughtered.  Real Commaches would not have been that stupid.Finally, however, I must give one compliment.  When the action scenes start up, the William Tell overture roars in the background.  This is a vast improvement over the many dorky Hollywood films that do a remake of a classic then blast some goofy rap theme in the background.  They did get the music right in this film, even if many things were wrong.This is not a bad film.  There is plenty of action.  However, I am tired of the modern Hollywood stereotypes and the belittling of all that was once respected in our society.

1656687,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,B00DJYJWVW,Perry,"[7, 22]","The original lone ranger in film began with ""Enter the Ranger"" and while this movie does take much of the story into account when telling the first 30 minutes or so of this movie, it is more of a parody or spoof than it is the telling of the legend.To start off , the movie is a flash back of Tonto as he tells a kid his tale at a local carnival. I guess, maybe you could say this was Tonto's version of the tale as it certainly wasn't the Ranger's vision.The Butch Cavendish Gang was the villain for both the movie and the original TV Show Episode and he did setup an Ambush with Collins. Collins in the series was a half-breed outcast and Butch Cavendish shot him in the back the moment he was done with the Rangers (yes he survived and was brought to justice by the Lone Ranger and Tonto). The scenery for the Ambush appeared to be the exact same location and that's a pretty cool tribute on the part of those making the movie so I give them credit for that.With the Ambush, the TV show had all six Rangers shot and all six Rangers actually were fighting back with their own guns. The Movie had 5 of the 6 Rangers fighting back with the man who would become the Lone Ranger refusing to wield a gun even to save his life. Of course, they're all left for dead in the TV Series where the movie has Butch Cavendish playing the part of Shiite Militia Style Villain and eating the lead Rangers heart (Very bizarre twist). Overall, this was altered in a way that left you uninspired by the Lone Rangers plight and more disgusted at the character of the villain.When Tonto entered the scene in the original story, he found the John Reid (The Lone Ranger) by a creek that he crawled to for sustenance and the trinket was around John's neck as it was given to him by Tonto when Tonto was a boy, you see the Ranger saved his life then when he was younger after a band of renegade Indians killed Tonto's tribe (He also nicknamed him Kim-O-Sabe at that time). In the new story, Tonto finds Reid lying near his brother and he finds the trinket around Dan Reid's neck but, Tonto never recognizes the amulet as his own and claims it was given to Dan by another tribe for being a peace keeping trusty scout. Another discrepancy is that John Reid tells Tonto to dig the 6th grave as it is his plan to remain dead and fight for justice as a Lone Ranger that hunts the outlaws of the region.As for Silver, that was always John Reid's horse, he wasn't some mystical beast that could practically fly. Silver never pointed toward the grave to indicate the man that would be the hero.Ultimately, Tonto was not grateful to John Reid for anything in this new rendition because, this Ranger never really saved his life and nursed him back to health when he was younger. Basically, there was no real bond between the men and the one that developed in this story was very shallow at best.Anyway, this movie to me represented a huge disappointment and I would rather that it were given the ""True Grit"" treatment as a remake but instead, it got ""The Green Hornet"" treatment. Of course most people will never know the original legend because it was before their time but, those of us who knew it will be disappointed by this story.",1,Not the ranger you were looking for!,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,3202,"['original', 'lone', 'ranger', 'film', 'began', 'Enter', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'take', 'much', 'story', 'account', 'when', 'telling', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'more', 'parody', 'spoof', 'telling', 'legend.To', 'start', 'movie', 'flash', 'back', 'Tonto', 'kid', 'tale', 'local', 'carnival', 'guess', 'maybe', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'Tonto', 'version', 'tale', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'Ranger', 'vision.The', 'Butch', 'Cavendish', 'Gang', 'was', 'villain', 'movie', 'original', 'TV', 'Show', 'Episode', 'did', 'setup', 'Ambush', 'Collins', 'Collins', 'series', 'was', 'half-breed', 'outcast', 'Butch', 'Cavendish', 'shot', 'back', 'moment', 'was', 'done', 'Rangers', 'yes', 'survived', 'was', 'brought', 'justice', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'scenery', 'Ambush', 'appeared', 'be', 'exact', 'same', 'location', 'pretty', 'cool', 'tribute', 'part', 'making', 'movie', 'so', 'give', 'credit', 'that.With', 'Ambush', 'TV', 'show', 'had', 'six', 'Rangers', 'shot', 'six', 'Rangers', 'actually', 'were', 'fighting', 'back', 'own', 'guns', 'Movie', 'had', '5', '6', 'Rangers', 'fighting', 'back', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'refusing', 'wield', 'gun', 'even', 'save', 'life', 'course', ""'re"", 'left', 'dead', 'TV', 'Series', 'where', 'movie', 'Butch', 'Cavendish', 'playing', 'part', 'Shiite', 'Militia', 'Style', 'Villain', 'eating', 'lead', 'Rangers', 'heart', 'Very', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'Overall', 'was', 'altered', 'way', 'left', 'uninspired', 'Lone', 'Rangers', 'plight', 'more', 'disgusted', 'character', 'villain.When', 'Tonto', 'entered', 'scene', 'original', 'story', 'found', 'John', 'Reid', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'creek', 'crawled', 'sustenance', 'trinket', 'was', 'John', 'neck', 'was', 'given', 'Tonto', 'when', 'Tonto', 'was', 'boy', 'see', 'Ranger', 'saved', 'life', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'band', 'renegade', 'Indians', 'killed', 'Tonto', 'tribe', 'also', 'nicknamed', 'Kim-O-Sabe', 'time', 'new', 'story', 'Tonto', 'Reid', 'lying', 'brother', 'trinket', 'Dan', 'Reid', 'neck', 'Tonto', 'never', 'amulet', 'own', 'claims', 'was', 'given', 'Dan', 'tribe', 'being', 'peace', 'keeping', 'trusty', 'scout', 'discrepancy', 'John', 'Reid', 'Tonto', 'dig', '6th', 'grave', 'plan', 'remain', 'dead', 'fight', 'justice', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'outlaws', 'region.As', 'Silver', 'was', 'always', 'John', 'Reid', 'horse', 'was', ""n't"", 'mystical', 'beast', 'could', 'practically', 'fly', 'Silver', 'never', 'pointed', 'grave', 'indicate', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'hero.Ultimately', 'Tonto', 'was', 'not', 'grateful', 'John', 'Reid', 'anything', 'new', 'rendition', 'Ranger', 'never', 'really', 'saved', 'life', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Basically', 'was', 'real', 'bond', 'men', 'one', 'developed', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'shallow', 'best.Anyway', 'movie', 'represented', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'would', 'rather', 'were', 'given', 'True', 'Grit', 'treatment', 'remake', 'instead', 'got', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'treatment', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'original', 'legend', 'was', 'time', 'who', 'knew', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'story']",The Lone Ranger

But I found it hard to stomach the future Lone Ranger who was so fixated on a faith in the justice of the system when faced with so much evil and corruption. Just pull the darned trigger I kept thinking. In this sense it dragged and maybe some editing could have helped. Thus minus one star.For me it picked up after he finally figured out that the whole system was corrupt from the railroad barons to the military, and the Indians never had a chance. Isn't that where a lot of young people around the world are today in fact? They are shedding any idealism that they once had and are ready for some game change.When the Lone Ranger finally claims ""his manhood"" and begins to fight seriously and to realize why he needs to wear a mask, then the film picked up for me and the ending scenes were spectacular.

Yes, I had heard all of the negative reviews, but figured that a slight remake could not be that bad.  So, I went ahead and ordered it.  Here is what I liked:1.  Much like Roger Rabbit, this film tries to present some of the truth that is often left out about the way corporations can coopt law enforcement, military, and other branches of the government.2.  I found some of the extra features to be very interesting, especially the parts about making up items for the movie.3.  I was glad that I did not go to the movies and instead bought this DVD to see the movie with.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  The movie runs so counter to the original series and movies about the Lone Ranger that it is hard to reconcile them.  Perhaps if they had named the movie something else, it might have worked better.2.  The movie had a very disjointed feel to it.  The story seemed to jump around too much.  One was reminded of the movie &#34;Little Big Man&#34; from the way it was told, it just did not flow as easily.3.

""The Lone Ranger"" tells the story of lawman John Reid and how he transforms into the Wild West legend known as the Lone Ranger. When justice is threatened by Butch Cavendish, John (Armie Hammer) teams up with Native American Warrior Tonto to save the day. The story is told by an elderly Tonto years after the Lone Ranger's reign and begs the question, ""Is the legend just a fable? Or, did this crusader of justice really roam the Wild West?"" Our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics viewed it last week and, all of them loved it. ""This movie is fantastic to its core!,"" claims Gerry O. ""It is funny, entertaining, and very thrilling,"" remarks Raven D. See their full reviews below.The Lone Ranger, By Gerry OI already had an idea what this movie would be like, cowboys fighting each other. Based on all the stories about Lone Ranger, I also anticipated one of the characters would be the Indian,  Tonto. I was right! This film is worth waiting for - amazing adventure, action, romance. It is  funny and has the most gorgeous horse ever!At first I thought this movie was about a cowboy and Indian fighting bad guys, I was very wrong! It starts off so nicely and ends so action packed!The adventure begins when it's 1930 and there's an old western amusement park. A child is walking around dressed like the Lone Ranger and he goes to this exhibit where he finds Tonto the Indian. Tonto tells this boy about the story of the Lone Ranger who was being held captive in a train. The criminal escapes and a man helps Tonto escape as well. The train crashes but they and the passengers don't get hurt. This man joins his brother to look for the criminal. The brother and everyone else in the group dies but the man, whose name is John, lives. Tonto escapes jail and finds John and what's called a spirit horse. The two men and the horse go on many adventures and run into many problems (that the horse usually ends up fixing!) as they search for the criminal. Along the way, they get a little surprise!The movie is immaculate. The actors are great! I mean who doesn't like Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp?! The cinematography is stupendous! Everything is just fantastic! There's really nothing to complain about in this movie.My favorite scene is when Tonto finds all the dead rangers. He digs up little graves and tries to take what he can from them. Thinking all of them are dead he goes to John and he tries to take something and then John wakes up. Tonto is all surprised and just knocks him out and starts putting sand back on him.  The house saves John in this situation, but you have to watch the film to see the most hilarious scene of all.Since this movie has quite a lot of action and quite a bit of violence as well, I recommend it for  ages 12 and up. This movie is fantastic to its core so I give it 5 out 5 stars plus a few more if possible. This movie will be available in theaters everywhere July 3rdThe Lone Ranger, Reviewed by Raven D""The Lone Ranger"" tells the story of lawman John Reid and how he transforms into the Wild West legend known as the Lone Ranger. When the justice is threatened by Butch Cavendish, John, played by Armie Hammer, teams up with Native American Warrior Tonto, played by Johnny Depp to save the day. The story is told by an elderly Tonto years after the Lone Ranger's reign, so is the legend just a fable? Or, did this crusader of justice really roam the Wild West?I enjoy this film a lot. I feel that the costumes, set and film location stay very true to the style of old westerns while also keeping the visuals interesting and giving it a modern quality. I really like all of the scenery shots, especially in the desert. The arches and wildlife views make good transitions and I enjoy the artistic vibe it brings to the screen. I love the makeup and prosthetics that were used on Johnny Depp when he plays the elderly version of Tonto. It is so realistic and incredible that I could hardly even tell it was Johnny Depp! I also really love that Silver, the Lone Rangers trusty steed, does the craziest things throughout the film. At the most random times Silver will just be in a tree, on a roof, wearing a hat...and nobody questions it. It brings a sense of playfulness and lightens the mood and seriousness of the film.My favorite character is Tonto because Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying this character. He says the funniest things and makes very comical remarks throughout the film, which I really enjoy. I did think this would be a serious film, but it was actually quite humorous and light-hearted and Tonto has a big part in that. Tonto has a dead bird that he wears on his head and he always tries to feed it which was hilarious to watch!I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because of violence that typically goes along with westerns. I think ""The Lone Ranger"" is funny, entertaining, and very thrilling. I give it 4 out of 5 stars so be sure to check out the ""Lone Ranger.""For more reviews, please visit kidsfirst.org",5,Fantastic to its Core!,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,5088,"['film', 'based',

The humor was not too far offshore even though many scenes were highly unbelievable in just plain logic, but that's the beauty of cinema after all.The location shots and western sets are stunning and immaculate. The main score is the legendary lone ranger theme itself used to the fullest during a train scene that reminds me of How The West Won, & even Back To The Future III.

1656761,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B00DJYJWVW,Royce Callaway,"[9, 20]","It is hard to describe this Johnny Depp showpiece.  It certainly bares little resemblance to the Lone Ranger character from the radio and TV.  The Lone Ranger - as played by Arnie Hammer  -- seems to need not only a Shave but some therapy.  There was never a lot of plot with the radio / TV Lone Ranger but he was always a hero supported by his faithful Indian companion Tonto  The movie version is a politically correct view of the Lone Ranger which transforms him from a gun wielding ex-lawman into a gun hating lawyer determined to do good -- if possible with the aid of his intellectually superior companion.  That companion is TONTO -- made up to look more like a VooDoo priest than any Native American.  In fact I am beginning to wonder if you stripped the weird makeup from Johnny Depp's many characters could he actually act?There is a little required political stuff but overall this is just another shoot'em up with little plot.  The opening train sequence seems to go on forever followed by the posse pursuing the escaped prisoners.  The soon to be ""Lone Ranger"" escapes the gory massacre and is saved by the ""Spirit Horse"" and Tonto.  Tonto gives more lectures than a college professor and is --as usual overacted by Depp.  Feeding corn to the bird in his headdress I presume is Depp's idea of acting..  This movie is over two hours long which is way too long.  Midway through I began to wonder ""will this never end"" and indeed one of the critics said "" about halfway through, the movie made a fateful decision not to end, it then went on for another hour not ending"" that precisely sums up my experience.

Nobody in this whacked production seemedserious. The Blind Wink is deprecatory, a obvious insult. But the worst word was Nihil.The dictionary definition of nihilism, to quote: '&#34;The rejection of all religiousand moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless&#34;.&#34;(In) Philosophy: 'extreme skepticism maintainingthat nothing is the world has a real existence&#34;.&#34;Historical: The doctrine of an extreme Russian revolutionary party circa1900, which found nothing to approve of in the established social order.&#34;I get a sense that a number of the cast/production/writing names are what Hollywood calls 'Dark Horse' names; names to be used by actors and crew when they don't want to be connected, their reputations associated with a flop. By ducking as they have I see them a so disillusioned and cynical they turned mean and bailed, maybe before they left. Before the right-on unhyped really bad reviews hit. No wonder it turned out so awful.Only one name on that production credits I applaud: BOJAN BAZELLI.5-Stars to him. He was the director of photographyThese participants, from the Disney Board to the creative folk, caused Disney includingits investors a $200,000.000 loss, perhaps damaging Walt's reputation even more.No doubt creatives were at odds with Disney; I can imagine how it went when business marketeers clashed with creatives; especially eccentrics like Johnny Depp. Scary. Wasteful. Methinks This Lone Ranger movie came from such wars. Not much fit, made sense, stayed true to the Lone Ranger concept.In fact I knew and worked with a man at Procter & Gamble who became Disney's Board Chairman. When I knew him as a just-hired MBA grad - 3000 men interviewed; only three hired.  Eventually the go-getter got to be Disney President, then Chairman of  Disney's Board. The third guy I never met.And me, I left P&G; and went to a national ad agency (yes, I was a Mad Man in the 60's), agencies after agencies (six or seven in 15 years) I was a gypsy. Had so much fun. Far more than presidents had/have. Never stopped to think. Wonderful. Johnny Depp beats me though; I admire his life and achievements. Maybe we have the same formulae, Only he got rich.Johnny Depp has a great life. All on his own terms, I expect and applaud. I wonder if he got burned in this fiasco. Heard he has a contract with Disney. Maybe there'll be a movie about it? Maybe he could play the Disney Chairman of the Board . . .Last note: I really object to the portrayal of the Lone Ranger in this generally awful film. Clayton Moore's Lone Ranger was an icon, noble, intelligent and he shot guns out of bad guys hand so's he could be take them to trial; not because he missed when he was aiming for a kill shot, as in this flick. I knew Mr. Moore. In fact my mother dated him. Her only mistake was she introduced him to her roommate Sally, whom he married. Ain't life interesting? If you  let it be.Whew, this's a long review. Final last note: Read the reviews for the Long Ranger TV series of yore at Amazon, many choices, prices.. With the real Ranger, Clayton Moore. He really believed in the virtues his character represented. He loved being the Lone Ranger.There are new DVD sets out on the REAL Long Ranger. I just ordered about$50 worth of 'em from Amazon.

Bruckheimer apparently had a skilled historian of, maybe, himself.Additionally, this Blu-ray presentation had exceptional Dolby 7.1 sound with bullets zinging all around the room and the &#34;William Tell&#34; overture scored to the action. The Film was crystal clear on my 80-inch Sharp TV. Maybe part of it was that this was shot with film instead of digital.I also noticed that unlike most period pieces, the trains were accurate replicas of the original trains.

Hammer's protrayal of the Lone Ranger was one of a hero in training.  Some reviewers opined that this Lone Ranger was not accomplished enough, and something of a klutz.  Well, yes and no.  However, like Clayton Moore's Ranger, Hammer's interpretation retained that puritanical sense of fair play and proper dispensation of justice that made the Lone Ranger the enduring role model that he is.As for Tonto, suffice it to say that Depp should have received Oscar consideration for his mesmerizing performance.  Both as the young and old Tonto, Depp infused the character with both the nobility and tragedy of his Comanche ancestors, while at the same time being funny and witty.Add in the spectacular visuals, the flawless timing between Depp and Hammer, and superbly executed action scenes, and you have a movie that any Lone Ranger fan should love.",5,CRITICS ARE STUPID,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,1285,"['Having', 'watched', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'version', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'kid', 'having', 'great', 'dislike', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'actor', 'was', 'ready', 'hate', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'satellite', 'dish', 'plan', 'was', 'watch', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'immediately', 'entranced', 'film.It', 'was', 'complete', 'recasting', 'story', 'highly', 'respectful', 'forbears', 'visual', 'delight', 'Hammer', 'protrayal', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'one', 'hero', 'training', 'reviewers', 'opined', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'not', 'accomplished', 'enough', 'something', 'klutz', 'Well', 'yes', 'However', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'Ranger', 'Hammer', 'interpretation', 'retained', 'puritanical', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'proper', 'dispensation', 'justice', 'made', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'enduring', 'role', 'model', 'Tonto', 'suffice', 'say', 'Depp', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'young', 'old', 'Tonto', 'Depp', 'infused', 'character', 'nobility', 'tragedy', 'Comanche', 'ancestors', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'funny', 'witty.Add', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'flawless', 'timing', 'Depp', 'Hammer', 'superbly', 'executed', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'movie', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'fan', 'should', 'love']",The Lone Ranger

Maybe this makes sense if you are more familiar with the franchise, but as someone who's not, I didn't know what to make of this. To what level is the story of the Lone Ranger fictionalized in this already-fictional world? Help.The script is also pretty poorly written; the storyline is complex, as were the far superior Pirates of the Caribbean films, but, unlike the Pirates movies, the motivations of the Ranger's characters don't match their actions. The main love interest punches the Lone Ranger before kissing him at the end...even though the Ranger did nothing to wrong her and did not deserve getting hit, even if for comedic effect. At the end, the Ranger is presented an award from the local authorities for no clear reason...he settled his own score, but the consequences of the Ranger's actions honestly weren't in the best interests of the town. I don't get it.We also get some rather lousy dialogue, a masterful blend of typical popcorn flick exchanges as well as bizarre one-liners (""I served in Gettysburg. There were 12,000 casualties before lunch."").Some aspects of the film do work, however. The really tragic parts of the story aren't exactly tear-jerking, but they are somewhat powerful. They pair well with the excellent score by Hans Zimmer, often elevating the stupid action or dialogue into something much more impactful than it deserves to be.The Lone Ranger is also a surprisingly entertaining movie, for what it is.

I rented this movie.  It's rather long.  Since I have two more rental days on it I may try to watch again before falling asleep, and maybe there are answers to the questions I have.Questions I have as a non-Lone fan, only relying on this movie for info on the character.  There's some pieces of the title character's story missing that make this the three star movie. Questions like: Why does Lone not want to shoot a gun and didn't for the past eight years? I'm getting a slight hint that it had something to do with Lone's dad's Ranger experience?  How did Lone get so good with a gun but then turned against it?  Why is Lone initially portrayed as bumbling and merely lucky when he gets the bad guys and then later he's very skilled and the hero? Why did he leave the woman he loves and has no bad feelings with his brother about him taking her, and why is brother so cool with telling Lone she liked him best?  One character asked why the woman was so desired, not just by Lone and his brother, but also by this other old dude.  I wonder too.  Why is Lone's 'wild' horse already tame or was it just a stray?  Why is the law that Lone studied so exalted that it washes away any anger and internal struggle with wanting instant justice against the man that horribly murdered someone (see I'm not spoiling it)?  There are some bad guys that dress weird, really weird, and they question why Lone wears the mask, how can that mask be so unusual to people dressed that way that they'd make a comment (and ignore Tonto)?The comedic banter, the action, the story, ...in each, enough things are missing that the suspension of belief needed to sit back and just enjoy this action-adventure retelling of the Lone Ranger can't be sustained before questions pop up and then that distraction leads to looking for a good spot to hit the pause button and do something else.",3,3 stars = it's okay,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2021,"['not', 'movie', ""'d"", 'care', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'seeing', 'so', '3', 'stars', '=', '34', 'okay', '34', 'amazon', 'rating', 'system', 'about', 'right', 'rented', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', 'have', 'two', 'more', 'rental', 'days', 'may', 'try', 'watch', 'again', 'falling', 'asleep', 'maybe', 'are', 'answers', 'questions', 'have.Questions', 'have', 'non-Lone', 'fan', 'only', 'relying', 'movie', 'info', 'character', 'pieces', 'title', 'character', 'story', 'missing', 'make', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'Questions', 'Why', 'Lone', 'not', 'want', 'shoot', 'gun', 'did', ""n't"", 'past', 'eight', 'years', ""'m"", 'getting', 'slight', 'hint', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Lone', 'dad', 'Ranger', 'experience', 'How', 'did', 'Lone', 'get', 'so', 'good', 'gun', 'then', 'turned', 'Why', 'Lone', 'initially', 'portrayed', 'bumbling', 'merely', 'lucky', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'later', 'very', 'skilled', 'hero', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'woman', 'bad', 'feelings', 'brother', 'taking', 'why', 'brother', 'so', 'cool', 'telling', 'Lone', 'liked', 'best', 'One', 'character', 'asked', 'why', 'woman', 'was', 'so', 'desired', 'not', 'just', 'Lone', 'brother', 'also', 'other', 'old', 'dude', 'wonder', 'too', 'Why', 'Lone', ""'wild"", 'horse', 'already', 'tame', 'was', 'just', 'stray', 'Why', 'law', 'Lone', 'studied', 'so', 'exalted', 'away', 'anger', 'internal', 'struggle', 'wanting', 'instant', 'justice', 'man', 'horribly', 'murdered', 'someone', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'dress', 'weird', 'really', 'weird', 'question', 'why', 'Lone', 'mask', 'how', 'can', 'mask', 'be', 'so', 'unusual', 'people', 'dressed', 'way', ""'d"", 'make', 'comment', 'ignore', 'Tonto', 'comedic', 'banter', 'action', 'story', 'enough', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'suspension', 'belief', 'needed', 'sit', 'back', 'just', 'enjoy', 'action-adventure', 'retelling', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sustained', 'questions', 'pop', 'up', 'then', 'distraction', 'looking', 'good', 'spot', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'do', 'something', 'else']",The Lone Ranger

Given that, if TLR is to be compared to those movies, it most closely resembles the third one, because that's the one that was all over the map and relied more on explosions and CGI tricks to keep the audience in a slack-jawed endorphin rush in lieu of anything resembling a consistent feel or intelligence.Johnny Depp continues his string of overboard performances, harkening back to Jack Sparrow and going up through Barnabas Collins, playing the heretofore taciturn Tonto as the quirky jokester to Armie Hammer's dry and lifeless straight man take as The Lone Ranger. I really like Depp's work, but I fear he is becoming (has already become?) a Jack Nicholson-esque caricature of himself. I'd love to see Depp in a role that doesn't rely on accents or fey, droll, oddball behaviors, but it clearly won't be in TLR. William Fichtner plays Butch Cavendish with as much sneering malevolence as he can render, even adding in some Hannibal Lecter for extra creep factor, but he relies a bit too much on scars and bad teeth.  Poor Tom Wilkinson is simply not up to the kind of excess required of the cartoonish bad guy, and is never really scary or threatening as a run-of-the-mill greedy railroad capitalist. Helena Bonham Carter picks up a paycheck as a brothel madam with a surprise up her skirt and little else to contribute. Her inexplicably unnecessary role begs the question of whether or not Tim Burton was at the helm. Rounding out the cast are Ruth Wilson as the drab love interest to The Vanilla Ranger and Barry Pepper as a Custer-like cavalry officer who goes from a conscience-wrestling soldier to a barbaric killer for no apparent reason other than he didn't want to get left out of the ham-fest.To be fair, this is not a character-driven movie despite the star power, but rather an excessive action romp that tries to do too much, has too much filler, and never really seemed like anything more than yet another lowest common denominator offer from Hollywood. As I said, a good 30-45 minutes could have been eliminated without destroying any of the threadbare plot; thus helping to tighten up the parts of the movie that dragged. Additionally, the movie heaves a dose or two of liberal sensibility upon the audience that was not only out of place in this lightweight popcorn flick, but seemed as if it was done for no other reason beyond superficial finger waving.The majority will eat this up with a spoon and Walt Disney Inc. is counting on that, but for those who hoped for a bit more, something with a little more cleverness and respect for the audience, you'll be disappointed. Just turn off your brain, eat your popcorn, wash it down with your gallon of soft drink, and stare in wide-eyed amazement at the explosions on the screen.

1656840,A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,B00DJYJWVW,S. WIlliams,"[3, 4]","As parents with a family tradition of a weekly movie night, we eventually see just about every Disney movie there is. I admit that even though I gifted my son this with blu-ray at Christmas, I wasn't really looking forward to watching, given the film's critical drubbing and having been burned by a ""how bad can it be?"" blas&eacute; about last year's big Disney disasterJohn Carter, which proved to be a truly dismal viewing experience.Because we'd been so turned off by Carter, and also hated Depp's last Western, the animatedRango, we only reluctantly finally indulged our son, who has been happily building hisLEGO The Lone Ranger Constitution Train Chaseand other sets from the series since Santa brought them last month, by watching this film. And, guess what? It didn't suck. Far from it, actually.It probably helps that I have great childhood affection, passed on to me by my father, for the Lone Ranger black and white TV series, and I even saw the critically-pannedThe Legend of the Lone Rangerin the theater (apparently, we were the only ones), with my folks and a few friends, when I was just about my son's age and, though I can't say I had particularly refined artistic tastes at the time, remember loving it. And, as I recall, so did all my friends. We played Lone Ranger for weeks around the neighborhood and tried to make ourselves blood brothers/sisters with pocketknives. (Not the best lesson, but the most memorable part of that movie for me.) Therefore, my memories of the franchise's various incarnations are all good ones. (By the way, I also remember the various parents that took us complaining about how bad that 1981 movie was.)The storyline here is pretty much what you'd expect from a Lone Ranger origin film. The train escape of Butch Cavendish, followed by the canyon ambush of the Rangers by Cavendish and his gang; Tonto rescuing John Reid after his brother and all the others are killed; the appearance of the wild white horse who becomes Silver; etc. Throw in a silver mine and some calvary vs Native American action and that's the gist of the plot.Johnny Depp is treading well-worn territory here with Tonto only a slight variation on his Jack Sparrow character from thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, but my husband and I both laughed several times at his deadpan one-liners. Armie Hammer does a sturdy, if non-spectacular, job as the law abiding, straight-laced, always-ethical Lone Ranger. And frequent Depp co-star Helena Bonham-Carter makes a memorable one-legged prostitute. Good use was made of the classic William Tell Overture theme and the action sequences, particularly the train sequences that bookend the film, were very well done. (The final action sequence also seems to contain an overt nod to another Disney film:Toy Story 3)The movie, in fact, looked fantastic. Great action, picturesque, scenic set pieces and a real, classic ""Old West"" feel. The dialogue was fairly snappy and was, at times, quite sharp and funny. There are plenty of call backs for Lone Ranger fans, including several jibes about the silly, made-up Native American sounding words that litter the Ranger canon, a relic from the far less enlightened 1930s origins of the characters. They also managed to include just about every classic Lone Ranger trope, but put a little bit of a twist on them to better suit modern sensibilities. Of course, they did miss, perhaps, the biggest one of all, neglecting to include: ""Who was that masked man?,"" which seems like a fairly large oversight. (It's totally possible that all the ""What's with the mask?"" lines were meant to mock it.)I'd say the framing device of an elderly Tonto telling the story to a young boy dressed like the Ranger--which kept making me think of the opening ofYoung Guns 2, another guilty-pleasure modern Western--set in 1933, the year the Ranger premiered on radio, didn't always work very well, but it wasn't awful enough to ruin the film.All in all, while this is far from classic fare, we enjoyed it from beginning to end, which is a lot more than we can say about Carter. I'm not saying it was a great film, but it was far better than several other, far more critically acclaimed but ultimately awful and boring movies we've sat through recently: &lt;cough>Man of Steel&lt;cough>.This was entertaining and fun, suitable for most kids (there's some fairly gruesome violence, but it's more discussed rather than seen), but clever enough to also hold adults'  attention ...  Which is pretty much all I ask of in a family action film. I'm not sure what else to add other than that we enjoyed it FAR more than we expected, since we went in with extremely low expectations, and came away feeling like we had a really good time.",4,Much

This was the only foundation I could find for any negative reviews. Also I wished they had filmed it in full screen instead of the wide screen using the black bars across the top and bottom.

I didn't appreciate the way the movie started with a native American in a display case labeled &#34;savage&#34; and there was Johnny Depp in the display instead of a model. I think Johnny Depp is an ok actor but he's gotten to where he just plays kind of the same part with the same facial expressions and he was not the right one for this part. If you have a Native American or an Asian or an African American in a story, the part should be played by a Native American, Asian or African American.

As with any bet, there will be winners and losers. If they win, the inevitable sequels have built in promotion and they will continue to generate revenue for years to come.But if they lose...Gore Verbinski's ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer (""J. Edgar"", ""The Social Network""), Tom Wilkinson, William Fichtner (lots of TV work, currently on NBC's ""Crossing Lines"") and Helena Bonham Carter is the Disney Studios' big gamble for 2013. Narratively, the film is good, but the built up anticipation makes it feel like a loss. Financially, the film is already labeled a dud and it is a film Disney is already trying to overcome. Don't expect any ""Lone Ranger"" attractions at any of the Disney parks.Johnny Depp has made a career of playing strange, over-the-top characters. He does them well, providing interesting performances, even when the film doesn't measure up. But in the last few years, this type of character seems to be all he does and the public is growing less interested; his last few films have flopped. I am personally growing tired of the strange, heavily made-up characters that seem to have become the actor's stock and trade. I know he gets huge paychecks for these films (reportedly $40 million for the last ""Pirates"" film), but he would be well served by taking a less-showy role, allowing him to show off his acting chops.The unusual aspects of his characters also seem to permeate the few more normal roles he has recently done. In Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"", he played a gangster who seems crazier than was probably necessary. ""The Tourist"" is an interesting idea, but it doesn't work either. ""The Rum Diary"" was a spectacular failure; no one seemed interested in Depp's return as Hunter Thompson. And let's face it, if there is a human being similar to any of the strange characters Depp plays, it is Thompson.Unfortunately, it looks like we can expect more of the same. Depp already had ""Pirates 5"" lined up before this film was released. But when it quickly became apparent ""Ranger"" was a flop, Depp's people went into hyperdrive and lined up  ""Through the Looking Glass"", the sequel to ""Alice in Wonderland"". These are exactly the types of roles Depp should be staying away from.In ""The Lone Ranger"", Depp plays Tonto, a Comanche Indian who seems very involved in the story from the beginning. He is being held prisoner in the same rail car with Butch Cavendish (Fichtner), a notorious outlaw who according to legend eats the still-beating hearts of his victims. When Cavendish escapes, Tonto quickly gets free and never seems to be far behind the outlaw. John Reid (Hammer), an idealistic lawyer returning to rural Texas to start his new practice, joins his brother Adam (James Badge Dale) in a posse. The posse is quickly ambushed and Tonto rescues John, encouraging him to become the Masked Man. A Masked Man will be able to more easily extract revenge for both of them.There is a definite attempt to make this a more PC-appropriate portrait of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Basically, Tonto seems to be the brains, molding and shaping Reid into his personal vigilante. My problem with this setup comes from Hammer's portrayal of Reid as a buffoon. Early on, Reid is full of himself; confident he can make a change in the Wild West by simply sticking to his idealism and ignoring the reality of his new environment. As he morphs into the Lone Ranger, he continues to make dumb decisions and more often than not, his simple dumb luck seems to help him persevere.As this character trait continues, a couple of things happen. Reid doesn't change a lot, which makes him less interesting. It also shows us that Tonto seems to regard his partner as a buffoon illustrating the fact they don't really like one another. Which leads to the question: why should we care about them if they don't care about each other?The most successful aspect of the film is the storytelling device. A young boy walks into a Wild West Show at a San Francisco carnival in 1933. As the boy, wearing a Lone Ranger outfit, wanders through the displays, he stops to look at the ""Noble Savage"" and is startled when the statue's eyes begin to move. The elderly Tonto begins to relate the story of the origins of the legend. While it may seem strange to have a human being, let alone a Native American, working as a human mannequin, this helps to spin and sell the tall-tale aspect of the film. The young boy could be imagining the conversation with the elderly Tonto; he probably is, because he stops the story a few times when Tonto's narrative becomes too outlandish.Verbinski and the writers (all of whom created the ""Pirates"" films) don't do a very good job of hiding a potential plot twist. As soon as a character makes an appearance, you know he or she will be revealed as something else all together, making this moment pointless.The best aspect of the film is the action; Verbinski clearly has a lot of fun playing with his toys. There are a number of lengthy, complicated action sequences involving or set on trains. At one point, Depp's Tonto jumps and swings back and forth between two moving trains. Depp's stone face and the nature of the stunts instantly brought to mind the great silent comedian Buster Keaton. Given Depp's well-documented admiration for Keaton, the similarity is not a mistake. It's nice work and it is well done.Less interesting is the pacing of the film. At 149 minutes, it is too long and despite all of the narrative and action, it seems to drag. The filmmakers depict the lengthy backstory of both the Lone Ranger and Tonto, which is a big mistake. The backstories and the framing device seem to slow down a film packed with elaborate, fun action scenes. It would have made sense to save one of these stories for the sequel, and concentrate on just one of the characters in this film. I suspect that because Depp is the star, the draw, and he is playing the non-title character, the filmmakers included both to make Depp's performance viable. It was a bad decision made because a lot of money is at stake,There is an impressive collection of character actors involved in the film. In addition to Wilkinson and Fichtner, James Badge Dale, Leon Rippy, Barry Pepper and others are all naturals for a big, all-out Western. Even James Frain, a popular British actor who has appeared in ""Tron: Legacy"", ""True Blood"" and many other films and television shows, pops up as one of Cavendish's henchmen in a role that can barely be labeled a cameo. It is nice to see all of these actors in roles that are a natural fit. Their appearances make the landscape feel more real and viable.Much like Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter has been hiding behind elaborate, over-the-top characters and too much makeup for a long time. Maybe both have been hanging around Tim Burton for too long, but we'll save that for another review. In ""Ranger"", Bonham-Carter plays Red Harrington, the red-haired madam of a whorehouse. But she is no ordinary madam; she has a porcelain leg with special features. The porcelain leg is strange and unusual. We don't know why she has it, so it just becomes an unexplained oddity.Normally, I would focus on the good parts of a movie and then discuss any bad moments. For this movie, it was necessary to skip back and forth. ""The Lone Ranger"" is the very definition of a mixed bag, with both good and bad, making it difficult to clearly differentiate between the two. And, ultimately, this makes the film a bit of a wash.Mr. Depp;Sign on for the next Woody Allen film, the next Derek Cianfrance film, the next Nicholas Winding Refn film.

Going into this I was not expecting much at all. I was really not excited to see this for a few reasons. One was because I am too young to remember the TV series and I am not a big Johnny Depp fan at all.

There were some pretty funny parts and I did laugh throughout but this is really only a one time watch at most.

1656879,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00DJYJWVW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","""The Lone Ranger"" is an action-packed adventure movie starring Johnny Depp, directed by Gore Verbinski and co-produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The three names are responsible for the hugely successful ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" that spawned three sequels so far. So it is nothing surprising for us to see them together again. It should be a winning formula for Disney, but somehow things didn't turn out as the studio had expected.I'm not talking about the film's box office revenue, but the film itself, which is reasonably entertaining, but too long by thirty minutes and uneven in tone. ""The Lone Ranger"" starts with a ""frame narrative,"" where a young boy listens to the story of an aged native Indian posing like a mannequin.The unique narrative device could have worked better had the main story not been so convoluted. ""The Lone Ranger"" opens and ends with fine action set-pieces, but spends so much time in the mid-section about the back stories of John Reid/Lone Ranger, Tonto and villains, that when you finally hear the famous William Tell overture, the film is almost over.For a film that begins with a Disney logo, the body count is pretty high. The actors have nice chemistry, but the film doesn't know how to make full use of it. I for one enjoyed the climactic Buster Keaton-inspired action sequence, though some viewers may find it too long and silly. Certainly ""The Lone Ranger"" is not that bad. It is not that great, either, however, wasting the fine performances from the leads Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer.",3,"Nice Performances from the Leads, But the Film Is Too Slow-Paced",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1524,"['Lone', 'Ranger', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'movie', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'directed', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'co-produced', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'three', 'names', 'are', 'responsible', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'spawned', 'three', 'sequels', 'so', 'far', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'see', 'together', 'again', 'should', 'be', 'winning', 'formula', 'Disney', 'somehow', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'studio', 'had', 'expected.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'film', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'too', 'long', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'uneven', 'tone', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'frame', 'narrative', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'story', 'aged', 'native', 'Indian', 'posing', 'mannequin.The', 'unique', 'narrative', 'device', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'main', 'story', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'convoluted', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'opens', 'fine', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'mid-section', 'back', 'stories', 'John', 'Reid/Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'villains', 'when', 'finally', 'hear', 'famous', 'William', 'Tell', 'overture', 'film', 'almost', 'film', 'Disney', 'logo', 'body', 'count', 'pretty', 'high', 'actors', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'film', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'make', 'full', 'use', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'climactic', 'Buster', 'Keaton-inspired', 'action', 'sequence', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'long', 'silly', 'Certainly', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'however', 'wasting', 'fine', 'performances', 'leads', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Armie', 'Hammer']",The Lone Ranger

Some of the stunts on the locomotive and the wreck were totally sick.  I watched the movie a second time just to see some of those scenes again.  Awesome!  Those who grew up hero-worshipping the Lone Ranger may be disappointed initially, however, because the story is told from the viewpoint of Tonto, a quirky outcast Comanche brave on a spiritual quest for redemption, played admirably by Johnny Depp.  Tonto is the reluctant hero who rescues and then gives birth to the Lone Ranger, who is actually a dork throughout most of the movie(albeit a brave one).  The two do not begin as friends, but end up as partners as fate and a common goal bring them together again and again.The humor is delightful: sometimes twisted, sometimes silly but always clever and often unexpected. I laughed when Tonto dragged the Ranger through a pile of fresh horse dung, and again when Mrs. Reid ended up riding backwards on a horse,then grabbed its tail to try and steer it!  Hilarious! It definitely reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean.  As an added bonus, the scenery in the movie is unforgettable, full of stunning panoramic shots of colorful bluffs, unusual stone formations and wild desert canyons. The movie also has depth, and a subtle message about history.I highly recommend this movie.  The Lone Ranger is a solid Western and a truly marvelous action flick, with all the quirky delights and humor of the Pirates of the Caribbean. It is an adult version of the Saturday matinee classic in many ways, but the tremendous climax will still return viewers to the thrilling days of yesteryear.

1656904,A2XOS0D485JSMM,B00DJYJWVW,webhawk50,"[3, 4]","Here I was all set to hate this movie.  I had put off even watching this movie because of all the negative comments I'd heard along with all of the negative reviews I&#8217;d read about it.  Since I couldn&#8217;t find anything else to watch last night, I decided to give it a go.  The first half hour or so had me almost convinced that the critics were right and I was ALMOST prepared to shut it off and go watch something else.  I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.  The next two hours were absolutely entertaining stuff, swinging wildly between some extreme action and some VERY funny dialogue.  Johnny Depp played his part wonderfully.  I had heard nothing but criticism about him playing Tonto, but he played it so deadpan that I had to laugh.This version of Lone Ranger was, in many respects a throwback to many older films.  The Marx Brothers &#8220;Duck Soup&#8221;, for example,  is the one that most frequently came to my mind.  At first, I suffered from what I believe might have tainted many reviewers negative sense about this movie: perhaps a kind of &#8220;sacred&#8221; notion of who and what the Lone Ranger &#8220;should&#8221; be.  I have experienced this before with the Batman and Robin TV series that turned the Dark Knight into a kind of campy idiot.  I thoroughly despised that series in turning one of my favorite childhood heroes into this utterly un-Batman-like fool. So it was that my initial reaction to this version of the Lone Ranger was entirely negative.  Here, another one of my childhood heroes was being depicted as a complete nerd-like dork and Tonto, his faithful sidekick was this rather insane, outrageous Comanche who walked around with a dead bird on his head.  This was enough to make any hard-core Lone Ranger fan foam at the mouth.  But then, as the movie progressed and the old stereotype of what the Lone Ranger &#8220;should&#8221; be was rapidly dashed to pieces, the true nature of this film began to emerge as an absolutely fun movie with some truly great slapstick, puns, and really good action.  In short,  by the end of the movie, I was converted from a hater to a complete appreciator of this movie.Many critics complained of it&#8217;s length&#8212;two and half hours&#8212;and it&#8217;s true; two and a half hours is ridiculously long for a funny action movie.  But you know what?  I didn&#8217;t even realize it was that long until I read those reviews afterwards.  It seemed to be just as long as it needed to be in order to complete the movie properly.  There was not one part of it that I would cut, even though the beginning didn&#8217;t make any sense to me at first.  Having watched it all the way, the beginning was essential in bringing the movie full circle.I am given to suspect that many of those harsh critics of this Lone Ranger movie would probably have given &#8220;Duck Soup&#8221; or other Marx Brothers or WC Fields absurdities high marks as some of the great movie comedy classics.  So why not this Lone Ranger?  It was every bit as funny.  The photography and acting were first rate.  It was full of some excellent action sequences (unlike what several critics have alleged).Bottom line:  The Lone Ranger was one fun movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone capable of suspending their personal notions about the &#34;sacredness&#34; of the Lone Ranger & Tonto characters.  This Lone Ranger is a funny parody; a what-if kind of speculation in an alternate universe where the heroes are turned into a kind of goofy buddy-movie that for me, at least, was very funny and highly entertaining. It's also a kind of speculation and prequel as to how the Lone Ranger became the great Lone ranger.",4,"The Lone Ranger was a pleasant, funny surprise",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,3667,"['Here', 'was', 'set', 'hate', 'movie', 'had', 'put', 'off', 'even', 'watching', 'movie', 'negative', 'comments', ""'d"", 'heard', 'negative', 'reviews', '8217', 'd', 'read', 'couldn', '8217', 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'had', 'almost', 'convinced', 'critics', 'were', 'right', 'was', 'ALMOST', 'prepared', 'shut', 'off', 'go', 'watch', 'something', 'else', '8217', 'glad', 'didn', '8217', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'were', 'absolutely', 'entertaining', 'stuff', 'swinging', 'wildly', 'extreme', 'action', 'VERY', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'played', 'part', 'wonderfully', 'had', 'heard', 'nothing', 'criticism', 'playing', 'Tonto', 'played', 'so', 'had', 'laugh.This', 'version', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'many', 'respects', 'throwback', 'many', 'older', 'films', 'Marx', 'Brothers', '8220', 'Duck', 'Soup', '8221', 'example', 'one', 'most', 'frequently', 'came', 'mind', 'first', 'suffered', 'what', 'believe', 'might', 'have', 'tainted', 'many', 'reviewers', 'negative', 'sense', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'kind', '8220', 'sacred', '8221', 'notion', 'who', 'what', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '8220', 'should', '8221', 'be', 'have', 'experienced', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'TV', 'series', 'turned', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'kind', 'campy', 'idiot', 'thoroughly', 'despised', 'series', 'turning', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'utterly', 'un-Batman-like', 'fool', 'was', 'initial', 'reaction', 'version', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'entirely', 'negative', 'Here', 'one', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'was', 'being', 'depicted', 'complete', 'nerd-like', 'dork', 'Tonto', 'faithful', 'sidekick', 'was', 'rather', 'insane', 'outrageous', 'Comanche', 'who', 'walked', 'dead', 'bird', 'head', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'hard-core', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'fan', 'foam', 'mouth', 'then', 'movie', 'progressed', 'old', 'stereotype', 'what', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '8220', 'should', '8221', 'be', 'was', 'rapidly', 'dashed', 'pieces', 'true', 'nature', 'film', 'began', 'emerge', 'absolutely', 'fun', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'slapstick', 'puns', 'really', 'good', 'action', 'short', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'converted', 'hater', 'complete', 'appreciator', 'movie.Many', 'critics', 'complained', '8217', 'length', '8212', 'two', 'half', 'hours', '8212', '8217', 'true', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'funny', 'action', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'even', 'realize', 'was', 'long', 'read', 'reviews', 'afterwards', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'needed', 'be', 'order', 'complete', 'movie', 'properly', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'part', 'would', 'cut', 'even', 'beginning', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'Having', 'watched', 'way', 'beginning', 'was', 'essential', 'bringing', 'movie', 'full', 'circle.I', 'am', 'given', 'suspect', 'many', 'harsh', 'critics', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'given', '8220', 'Duck', 'Soup', '8221', 'other', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'WC', 'Fields', 'absurdities', 'high', 'marks', 'great', 'movie', 'comedy', 'classics', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'bit', 'funny', 'photography', 'acting', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'full', 'excellent', 'action', 'sequences', 'what', 'several', 'critics', 'have', 'alleged', '.Bottom', 'line', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'one', 'fun', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'capable', 'suspending', 'personal', 'notions', '34', 'sacredness', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Tonto', 'characters', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'funny', 'parody', 'what-if', 'kind', 'speculation', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'heroes', 'are', 'turned', 'kind', 'goofy', 'buddy-movie', 'least', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'also', 'kind', 'speculation', 'prequel', 'how', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'became', 'great', 'Lone', 'ranger']",The Lone Ranger
1656905,A1JV1FA7LCDDA3,B00DJYJWVW,Wendell Best,"[3, 7]","When I was a kid I watched the Lone Ranger everyday after school. It was in black and white, the Lone Ranger had a trick horse and could do amazing trick shots that foiled the bad guys, he always used silver bullets. At the end of every episode he waved his hat and said &#34;Hiho Silver! Away!&#34;. Tonto was his faithful friend and they brought justice to the old west. Yeah, Tonto said things in a corny way, but it's the 40's and 50's and I doubt Tonto talking like a college graduate would have been very convincing at that time. Try to translate that into present day and you have a challenge.I liked that they made pointed references to the the things that made the Lone Ranger what he was. I like how they viewed it with humor because now a days those things aren't perceived as being realistic. Would an actual American Indian playing Tonto been more authentic? Sure, but aren't actors supposed to be playing a part that isn't them? I was actually impressed with Johnny Depp's performance in that he DIDN'T channel Jack Sparrow into his performance. People are so tied up with not offending minorities these days we never stop to think things like, &#34;Did the actor treat the character with respect?&#34; First of all, ask a American Indian if they were offended. Secondly, this is a period piece and Indians were seen as uncivilized and savages. Lastly, Tonto had a way of speaking that marked him as Tonto so yeah, he said the &#34;Me um's&#34; and spoke with broken English. If they made the movie politically correct it would be boring! I also think it's a good thing to remember that there was a time people thought that way and it should remind us now how we need to look beyond what we see and try to truly understand the people around us for who they are and not what we perceive them to be by their surface appearance. I think that Tonto's reason for being locked up made that point very clear when he said his crime was, &#34;Indian&#34;.I was thoroughly entertained by this movie, yes it is over the top but I don't go to the movies for a repeat of the television show. Good solid story and acting by the entire cast and it is one of those movies I have watched more than once and still enjoyed the same each time. When the William Tell overture played I got excited, it really took me back to those times of watching the TV show and hearing the music play whenever the exciting part of the show began.

1656916,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B00DJYJWVW,William Krischke,"[7, 16]","It seems like all Native America wanted to talk about this summer was ""The Lone Ranger"" and whether it honored or offended Native Americans. I've read articles from Native people on both sides, so I'll let my words be few on this topic. Frankly, I expected it to be worse. It makes some honest, if clumsy and possibly misguided, attempts to honor Native peoples. Its greatest sin is that it relegates Native Americans to the past. Tonto appears to be the last living Indian, and he's hardly more than a peanut-guzzling wax figure in a Wild West museum. The filmmakers might be surprised to find that there are vital and growing Native communities in the 21st century.""The Lone Ranger"" opens in a Wild West museum, where an extremely old Tonto is part of the display. This ancient Indian narrates the entire story to a young boy wearing a toy six-shooter and cowboy hat. About halfway through the film, we learn that Tonto (Johnny Depp), because of childhood trauma, has suffered a break with reality and is completely nuts. When you put these two scenes together - when you recognize that the whole movie is a story told by a man who has completely lost touch with reality - things start to make a little more sense.This is a schizophrenic film. The experience of watching it is similar to what I imagine a visit to a mental hospital would be like. It veers from ridiculous to campy, from fast-paced and breathless to terribly serious to suddenly, perhaps unintentionally, funny again. It's hard to keep up. It might be pointless to try. Like an amusement park ride, the way it moves, jerks, veers and swoops will either make you light-headed and woozy, or it will make you puke.Armie Hammer stars as a self-righteous lawyer who seems to believe that he can singlehandedly bring Justice and Order to the wild, wild West. This is the good guy, and also the film's first big problem: he's completely unlikable. From the beginning of the film to the end, he's stiff, and arrogant, and self-righteous. Even Tonto doesn't like him, but we'll get to that.Hammer quickly gets deputized and rides out into the desert, where the bad guy, who literally eats the heart of his enemy, slaughters everyone around him. Yep, this is a kid's movie. Depp shows up to bury the dead bodies, but discovers that this one's only mostly dead. Mostly dead means slightly alive, so he nurses the stranger with the big white hat back to health, convinced by a bird (or a hallucination of a bird, I'm not sure) that this man can't be killed.Depp and Hammer ride after the bad guys, only to discover that the good guys are actually the bad guys, and the original bad guys don't matter that much, and before long, the Army's involved, and we're all thoroughly confused as far as who's on which side and why.Actually, I'd like to pause and talk about the Army, because it might be the one place where ""The Lone Ranger"" actually has something interesting to say. Barry Pepper plays the Army commander, who is sent in by the government to fight the Comanches, who attacking and killing innocent folks along the frontier. Pepper is presented by the film as a good man sent to do a job, and only concerned with doing it well and completely. It's only after he and his army have slaughtered an entire Comanche war party that he discovers that it wasn't the Comanches killing the ranchers after all, but railroad workers dressed up as Comanches because the evil railroad baron (Tom Wilkinson) wants the Comanches out of the way. Fuller has been tricked and manipulated.Then, so quickly that you might miss it, Pepper comes to a watershed moment in his life -- will he admit that he has unwittingly done a terrible thing, slaughtering innocent people, then repent and try to make amends? Or will he continue down the road he's found himself on, buying the lie he's been told, a lie that justifies his own actions? In this all-too-brief moment, I think the makers of ""The Lone Ranger"" have hit upon the situation of most white Americans, and the tough choice in front of them -- to ignore/justify the past, or to go about the hard, soul-searching work of repentance and reconciliation, and seek a better future. Sadly, I'm afraid most people choose the same path Pepper chose.""The Lone Ranger"" was a big box office disappointment for Disney, and I can't say that you'll miss much if you decide to skip it when it comes out on DVD soon.

1656928,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B00DJYJWVW,Yu Narukami,"[1, 3]","IN RETROSPECT ""There come a time, when good man must wear mask.""Johnny Depp essentially transports himself from the pirates and the high seas to a landlocked Wild West with sheriffs and bandits. A Jerry Bruckheimer production of a Gore Verbinski film, The Lone Ranger is hopefully a rousing start to Disney's new wannabefranchise after the popular success of The Pirates of the Caribbean films.Its box-office figures will determineifa sequel will make any sort of headway, but judging by what I've seen, I must say that mainstream audiences will take to Verbinski's new film like fish to water. Only thatthe water is muddied by a host of narrative clich&eacute;s and some of the most preposterous action sequences you will see this year.Depp plays Tonto, a tribal kind of person who has lost his tribe because of an incident, and whose face must have erased chalk work from thousands of blackboards. His partner, an outlaw of sorts played by Armie Hammer (The Social Network, 2010; J. Edgar, 2011) wears a mask tobattle the violent bandits of the West.The movie tells the story of Hammer's characterfrom the perspective of Tonto, who recounts from memory the eventsthatwould make up the film'sbloated 149-minute runtime. That is an issue because the film seems to be striving for an epic Western feel, but in the end its blockbuster sensibilities result in a comedy-adventure that doesn't quite hit the high notes of grandeur.There are a couple of minutes of pure visual-aural grandeur though asan arrangement of Rossini's ""William Tell Overture"" accompanies the beginningof the climactic act. Depp's performance brings up the humour quotient, and it must be said that without his presence in the film (and as its key marketing strategy), The Lone Ranger would have bombed, John Carter-style. It still might, if poor reviews sway audiencesaway.The annoying toggling between the timelines of an old Tontoinconceivably recounting the legend of the maskedhorse-ridertoa young boy in a museum, and the younger Tonto and his noble ""sidekick"" during their adventures on the high sands absorbs much of the narrative momentum, contributing to some needless pacing issues.The Lone Ranger is like Spielberg's dud Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) - action that borders on ridiculousness, plot development that lacks sense-making, and humour that falls flat more frequently thannot.
