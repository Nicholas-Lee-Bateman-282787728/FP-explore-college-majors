Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[3, 3]","Renee Fleming & Dmitri Hvorostovsky: A Musical Odyssey in St. PetersburgI am a big fan of Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky and that is why I knew that eventually I was going to buy this DVD.When I saw these two singers performing together in Eugene Oneguin aside of that they are very good singers they also have chemistry when they act together.The parts that I enjoyed the most were when they sang together, in this DVD they do some duets and they have to play different roles, like lovers, daughter and father, etc and they do it very well like those feelings are really true, they also sang different areas and songs very well.This DVD also can be very enjoyable for people that are not into opera because it also shows this beautiful city, its history and art as well as all the palaces they sang. Renee Fleming narrates episodes from the history of Saint Petersburg that can be also very interesting and with a lot of information that of course the DVD has to be watched more than once to get all this knowledge, but that is good if someone is going to buy a DVD is to see it many times and enjoy it.",5,A great concert,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1111,"['Renee', 'Fleming', 'Dmitri', 'Hvorostovsky', 'Musical', 'Odyssey', 'St.', 'PetersburgI', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'Dmitri', 'Hvorostovsky', 'why', 'knew', 'eventually', 'was', 'going', 'buy', 'DVD.When', 'saw', 'two', 'singers', 'performing', 'together', 'Eugene', 'Oneguin', 'aside', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'singers', 'also', 'have', 'chemistry', 'when', 'act', 'together.The', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'were', 'when', 'sang', 'together', 'DVD', 'do', 'duets', 'have', 'play', 'different', 'roles', 'lovers', 'daughter', 'father', 'etc', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'feelings', 'are', 'really', 'true', 'also', 'sang', 'different', 'areas', 'songs', 'very', 'well.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'opera', 'also', 'beautiful', 'city', 'history', 'art', 'as', 'well', 'palaces', 'sang', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'narrates', 'episodes', 'history', 'Saint', 'Petersburg', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'lot', 'information', 'course', 'DVD', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'get', 'knowledge', 'good', 'someone', 'going', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see', 'many', 'times', 'enjoy']",N/A

I did not enjoy all the pieces but Renee's voice is marvelous.  I wish her wardrobe was comparable.  It looked as though she wraped herself in a bolt of fabric or curtains, very unflattering and looked like a crumpled mess.  The presentation in various beautiful palaces/museums in St Petersburg is well done and aesthically appealing compared to most staged performances in concert halls.  You even get a tour of the city in short segements.  The sound track quality is very good.  A very pleasing experience.",4,This is a delightful production.,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,587,"['Overall', 'program', 'few', 'Italian', 'mostly', 'Russian', 'composers', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'pieces', 'Renee', 'voice', 'marvelous', 'wish', 'wardrobe', 'was', 'comparable', 'looked', 'wraped', 'bolt', 'fabric', 'curtains', 'very', 'unflattering', 'looked', 'crumpled', 'mess', 'presentation', 'various', 'beautiful', 'palaces/museums', 'St', 'Petersburg', 'well', 'done', 'aesthically', 'appealing', 'compared', 'most', 'staged', 'performances', 'concert', 'halls', 'even', 'get', 'tour', 'city', 'short', 'segements', 'sound', 'track', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'pleasing', 'experience']",N/A
