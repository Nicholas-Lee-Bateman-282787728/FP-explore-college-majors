Play find the homage to your favorite movies & tv series. Also, stick around thru the end of the credits for an additional scene. Thanks, from me, to all the people who allowed them to use your stuff or parody them. Helped make it great.  Honestly, I bought the movie because of Danielle, whom I met back in March @ Horror Hound Weekend.  She was really sweet so I am slowly buying her stuff.  I was expecting a kids movie.  However, it turned into more of a movie like FANBOYS for me.

1255055,A19O1QVH7K39H0,B00283QELG,Glen Hubbard,"[1, 3]","I saw this movie advertised on another DVD I recently ordered. I am a huge superhero fan, and thought if I could get this cheap; I'd give it a shot. I thought I was lucky when I did get it cheap at Amazon. I wasn't. This movie is HORRIBLE! Though I have wasted enough time merely watching this movie, in the interest of the public good, I decided to spend a little more time here critiquing it with the hope of possibly sparing someone else some viewing agony.AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!This movie aspires to be like the recent parody movies ""Epic Movie"" or ""Date Movie"", only for kids. Those movies stink, but this movie is far far worse a film.Looking at other reviews, I cannot believe that some people gave this garbage 5 stars. They must be related to someone in the film or have a stake in the profits. Simply saying ""It's for kids!"" does not excuse the poor writing and direction of this nightmarish catastrophe of a film. There are many low budget kids' films written intelligently that are entertaining. This is not one of them.What makes me so angry is that the film has a good premise. Someone in a costume stops a mugging and is arrested for using overwhelming force. They assume he is a superhero, so they sentence him to become a member of a super team in training to better learn to use his ""powers"". So much possibility is there. But every single scene is sluggish, awkward and dull. The mediocre special effects of this film (which are actually not that bad) could have easily been overcome by better writing and direction, but they are NOT. The director should be banned from Hollywood.The writers' idea of comedy/parody seems to be lifting entire scenes WORD FOR WORD from well known movies, and then re-creating them in this film, only adding the main characters' voice over ""Hey, this is familiar! It's from `Return of the Jedi', isn't that funny?"" Umm... sorry, no it's not.I feel sorry for the lead actor of this film. The director apparently told him, ""Just say the line with a smile and them mug to the camera, trust me it's funny."" and he believed it. It never works, and it is tried over and over and over..... It's like they are constantly letting us in on a joke, THAT IS NOT THERE! ARGH! No matter how many times ne smiles and mugs, delivering a line from a much better film, it's not a joke, and it's never ever EVER funny.I watched this movie alone to make sure that my 7 year old daughter could watch it. Now I refuse to let her see it because she will think I am a moron for buying this  piece of garbage. And yes, I watched the whole film through the credits and was never rewarded by any sign of entertainment. To quote a famous doctor ""It's dead, Jim.""PLEASE NOTE: OF ALL THE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE ON AMAZON, I AM THE ONLY VERiFIED AMAZON PURCHASE! I doubt some of the others (five stars) even own the movie.THIS MOVIE IS NOT GOOD FOR KIDS OR ANYONE.

Zwick,"[5, 8]","A movie virtually guaranteed to wind up in the DVD bargain bin in record-setting time, ""Super Capers"" is an indescribably awful attempt at superhero parody.  It features a group of inept comic book figures, clad in ill-fitting get-ups, who bumble and stumble their way to victory against a passel of toothless bad guys.The movie's idea of humor consists mainly of goofy sound effects and corny musical cues playing on the soundtrack, though I suspect that their sole function is to alert us as to when we should be laughing (there`s really no other way for us to know, since, unlike a TV sitcom, it doesn`t come equipped with its own laugh track).Out of respect for any possible careers they may still have ahead of them, the actors shall remain nameless, though Adam West (TV's Batman), Clint Howard and June Lockhart stop by to show us just how far has-been actors can be forced to lower themselves when there simply aren't any decent roles left for them anymore.At the end, the director of this fiasco, Ray Griggs, thanks the ""directors who inspired"" him during his childhood, namely George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Peter Jackson.
