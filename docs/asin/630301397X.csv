350704,A2IY9M330NKBW6,630301397X,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Steven Soderbergh, while maybe not the world's greatest director, has made some great films and all his films are worth watching. This borders on great.Here's the scoop. It's depression era St. Louis. Mr. and Mrs. Kurlander and their two boys, Aaron and Sullivan, live in a small apartment. Dad needs a job and mom's on her way to T.B sanitorium. They need to send Sullivan to a relative's house because they cannot afford to keep him. Dad gets a job as a travelling salesman and needs to leave Aaron alone with naught but his wits, and his buddy Lester, to get by.What a cool flick. This is a good snapshot of the times. The viewer is whisked back in time with a lot of detail to make him/her believe they're there. The costumes, cars, places are all spot on. The color palette is also something to behold. The colors are slightly over-saturated giving it a very vivid appeal. It's also peppered with some notable characters. Aaron is a tremendously bright young man. He also has a steady moral compass and is not easily intimidated, a trait that helps further the story. His buddy Lester however, ( a pre-fame Adrien Brody) is more on the fringe of things. Not a bad guy but he likes to skirt the rules to his favor. But much of the movie revolves around Aaron trying to survive alone and dodge the hotel lackey that is trying to evict him. There are a lot of minor adventures throughout, and it's interesting to see how Aaron attracts some of the young ladies around him, but much of this a social snapshot on how the depression effected the middle American.This is a terrific watch. There's something for almost everyone and there is not a dull moment to be had. If you want a good time, with some real depth, check this baby out.",4,The Movie Who Would Be King,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1734,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'maybe', 'not', 'world', 'greatest', 'director', 'made', 'great', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'borders', 'great.Here', 'scoop', 'depression', 'era', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Kurlander', 'two', 'boys', 'Aaron', 'Sullivan', 'live', 'small', 'apartment', 'Dad', 'job', 'mom', 'way', 'T.B', 'sanitorium', 'need', 'send', 'Sullivan', 'relative', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'keep', 'Dad', 'job', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'leave', 'Aaron', 'alone', 'naught', 'wits', 'buddy', 'Lester', 'get', 'cool', 'flick', 'good', 'snapshot', 'times', 'viewer', 'whisked', 'back', 'time', 'lot', 'detail', 'make', 'him/her', 'believe', ""'re"", 'there', 'costumes', 'cars', 'places', 'are', 'spot', 'color', 'palette', 'also', 'something', 'behold', 'colors', 'are', 'slightly', 'over-saturated', 'giving', 'very', 'vivid', 'appeal', 'also', 'peppered', 'notable', 'characters', 'Aaron', 'tremendously', 'bright', 'young', 'man', 'also', 'steady', 'moral', 'compass', 'not', 'easily', 'intimidated', 'trait', 'further', 'story', 'buddy', 'Lester', 'however', 'pre-fame', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'more', 'fringe', 'things', 'Not', 'bad', 'guy', 'skirt', 'rules', 'favor', 'much', 'movie', 'Aaron', 'trying', 'survive', 'alone', 'dodge', 'hotel', 'lackey', 'trying', 'evict', 'are', 'lot', 'minor', 'adventures', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Aaron', 'young', 'ladies', 'much', 'social', 'snapshot', 'how', 'depression', 'effected', 'middle', 'American.This', 'terrific', 'watch', 'something', 'almost', 'everyone', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'be', 'had', 'want', 'good', 'time', 'real', 'depth', 'check', 'baby', 'out']",King of the Hill VHS
350705,A2GCSJJSTHZVIN,630301397X,Evan Stern,"[55, 56]","I watched this film for the first time as a freshman in high school, and  found myself simply captivated by its utter beauty and humanity. Over the  course of the picture I came to truly identify with the character of Aaron,  and his story struck a chord within my soul that I never kew existed.As  the years have passed, I have come back to this movie time and time again,  and I find that &quot;King of the Hill&quot; only grows better with each  viewing. Undoubtedly this film has a tremendous amount to say about  endurance, triumph, love, and adversity, and Soderbergh tackles such themes  with great eloquence and ease. But what is most striking about this  beautiful picture are the endless number of images that appear throughout  the course of its story. I will never forget the tragic dance scene in  which the character of Ella experiences a random seizure, the brilliant  exchanges between Spalding Gray and Elizabeth McGovern, or the touching  final interaction between Aaron and an elevator operator. But for me, the  most incredible sequence comes at the story's very beginning when Aaron  stands before his class and reads a report on Charles Lindbergh as it  offers fantastic insight into Aaron Kurlander's strong  spirit.Beautifully acted, and brilliantly written, this film is an  underrated jewel. I recommend &quot;King of the Hill&quot; to anyone, and  make no apologies for saying that this is my very favorite film.",5,A Small Gem of a Movie,968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,1439,"['watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'freshman', 'high', 'school', 'found', 'simply', 'captivated', 'utter', 'beauty', 'humanity', 'course', 'picture', 'came', 'truly', 'identify', 'character', 'Aaron', 'story', 'struck', 'chord', 'soul', 'never', 'kew', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'find', 'quot', 'King', 'Hill', 'quot', 'only', 'better', 'viewing', 'Undoubtedly', 'film', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'say', 'endurance', 'triumph', 'love', 'adversity', 'Soderbergh', 'tackles', 'such', 'themes', 'great', 'eloquence', 'ease', 'what', 'most', 'striking', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'are', 'endless', 'number', 'images', 'appear', 'course', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'tragic', 'dance', 'scene', 'character', 'Ella', 'random', 'seizure', 'brilliant', 'exchanges', 'Spalding', 'Gray', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'touching', 'final', 'interaction', 'Aaron', 'elevator', 'operator', 'most', 'incredible', 'sequence', 'story', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'Aaron', 'class', 'report', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'fantastic', 'insight', 'Aaron', 'Kurlander', 'strong', 'spirit.Beautifully', 'acted', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'film', 'underrated', 'jewel', 'recommend', 'quot', 'King', 'Hill', 'quot', 'anyone', 'make', 'apologies', 'saying', 'very', 'favorite', 'film']",King of the Hill VHS

Although the plot brings nothing new, this movie is still very well-crafted, suceeding in every element. The acting is uniformely great, the score is compelling, the directing is captivating and the colour texture of the scenes is memmorable. Soderbergh manages to tell a bitersweet tale, both funny and sad, remaining believable and true-to-life from beginning to end. The last scene in particular is an excellent mix between hapiness and melancholy, providing and adequate ambiguous resolution. Jesse Bradford is excellent as the confused smart kid in trouble, offering an honest and very convincing performance.

350707,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,630301397X,Jason,"[2, 2]","Living inside a seedy St. Louis hotel, Erin (Bradford) has a family life broken by poverty, nothing but lint in his pockets, and the early burden of adulthood.  Tough life for a kid who just graduated middle school.  Left to fend for himself when his dad takes a traveling salesman job (think Willy Loman without the misconceptions), Erin lies, cheats, steals and starves to survive.Aside from an early look at Katherine Heigel, Adrien Brody, and Jesse Bradford, King of the Hill is a drab Great Depression journey seen through the eyes of a thrifty preteen.  Depression-era castes are exposed, as the poor are separated from the aristocracy by uniformed, sadistic enforcers, blue collars without the grit and dirt of hard work.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, who I find completely hit or miss, this movie surprises me in that it is only moderately enticing.  I was neither enthralled nor bored.  Surely this will strike a chord with anyone who has gone through difficulties with poverty or family strife.  The overall ambiguous feel of the movie balances humor and joy of simply family life, and the utter despair of poverty and helplessness.Pleasing yet understated, it's worth a single viewing to see so many early efforts from several big names.",4,Subtle resiliency during hardship,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1248,"['Living', 'seedy', 'St.', 'Louis', 'hotel', 'Erin', 'Bradford', 'family', 'life', 'broken', 'poverty', 'nothing', 'lint', 'pockets', 'early', 'burden', 'adulthood', 'Tough', 'life', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'middle', 'school', 'Left', 'fend', 'when', 'dad', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'job', 'think', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'misconceptions', 'Erin', 'cheats', 'steals', 'starves', 'survive.Aside', 'early', 'look', 'Katherine', 'Heigel', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'King', 'Hill', 'drab', 'Great', 'Depression', 'journey', 'seen', 'eyes', 'thrifty', 'preteen', 'Depression-era', 'castes', 'are', 'exposed', 'poor', 'are', 'separated', 'aristocracy', 'uniformed', 'sadistic', 'enforcers', 'blue', 'collars', 'grit', 'dirt', 'hard', 'work.Directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'find', 'completely', 'hit', 'miss', 'movie', 'only', 'moderately', 'enticing', 'was', 'neither', 'enthralled', 'bored', 'Surely', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'difficulties', 'poverty', 'family', 'strife', 'overall', 'ambiguous', 'feel', 'movie', 'balances', 'humor', 'joy', 'simply', 'family', 'life', 'utter', 'despair', 'poverty', 'helplessness.Pleasing', 'yet', 'understated', 'single', 'viewing', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'early', 'efforts', 'several', 'big', 'names']",King of the Hill VHS

350709,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,630301397X,Westley,"[32, 33]","""King of the Hill"" was Steven Soderbergh's third film, following ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and the inscrutable ""Kafka.""  Compared to these films, ""King of the Hill"" is a small and straight-forward tale of the Depression.  Jesse Bradford (""Swimfan"") stars as Aaron Kurlander, a bright youngster in 1933 St. Louis.  His family is impoverished, although his salesman father (Jeroen Krabbe) manages (barely) to keep them fed and housed.  However, when the family's fortunes take a down-turn, they decide to send Aaron's younger brother to live with relatives.  Then Aaron's mother has a relapse of TB and goes to a sanitarium.  Finally, his father gets a traveling salesman job and leaves.  So, Aaron finds himself alone in their apartment trying to fend for himself.Based on a memoir by A. E. Hotchner, ""King of the Hill"" is a cruel film.  Anyone who has ever been mistreated as a youth is likely to wince at scenes depicting Aaron's hurt at being left behind or his painful attempts to cover up his poverty from his wealthy classmates.  The film is outstanding at every level - directing, acting, cinematography.  Jesse Bradford has gone on to a career as a bit of a vapid teen idol, but his performance here is as wise and deep as any I've seen from a child.  Adrien Brody also has one of his earliest roles as Aaron's older ""mentor.""  Finally, watch for Lauryn Hill as the gum-popping elevator operator.As of this writing, ""King of the Hill"" has not been released on DVD.  That such a terrific film has been so overlooked is nothing short of criminal.  It's obviously a small film, but by focusing on one boy, ""King of the Hill"" is able to portray the horrors and desperation of the Depression far more vividly than many ""bigger"" dramas, such as ""Ironweed.""
