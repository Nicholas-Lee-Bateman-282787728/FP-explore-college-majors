The director does an amazing job. This film just pulls you in and you just can't seem to turn away. As much as i wish the film was longer it would probably lose its allure if it was drawn out. The appeal is that the scenes move so fluidly. Everyone's performance in the film is excellent except Hayden. He isn't awful but he is not the scene stealer in the film. I love the special feature of the 60 minutes interview with Stephen because the real Stephen Glass was G*Y and very obvious from the interview. I wonder if anyone else picked up on it. I am not going to get into details about the story but will give you a quick recap, as it's a story about a young journalist the youngest on his team fabricating his stories to impress his co-workers.

The movie was mentioned so I went right to Amazon and I loved it.I could not believe someone could pull the wool over the eyes of experienced editors so easily.

796485,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001907AI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I saw this movie back in 03 and really liked it.  My wife found in dreadfully boring but I remember being pretty engrossed and I walked away really enjoying myself.  It was a smart and provocative look at a field that I am very intrigued in (journalism has always been a strong dream of mine).  What's funny is that years have gone by since I've seen this film, and up until last week my recollection has been that this was a good film with some stellar performances but that it was not a film I needed to see again.  I was entertained, nothing more.  I watched it again with some friends though and found myself blown away by how powerfully controlled this film really is.This film is remarkably explosive.This film tells the mesmerizing story of Stephen Glass, a journalist who managed to deceive his way to the top, concocting false stories that finally caught up to him when a online reporter and a suspicious editor start to crack down on him.  As Stephen's world crumbles in around him he realizes that there is no hiding from the fall, but no one acquainted with Stephen could even imagine how devastating that fall was going to be.I really have to give props to everyone involved, especially Billy Ray, the films writer and director.  The sharp screenplay is surprisingly deep and informative, and the marvelous way Ray creates a tone very reminiscent of a political thriller keeps the film an object of suspense.  My second viewing really made this apparent to me.  You watch the film on pins and needles waiting for the fall out, and when it comes it just creates a tidal-wave of emotional impact.Not what I expected.Taking great direction from Ray is a stellar cast that includes some of the most underused and underrated actors in independent cinema.  I am a huge fan of Chloe Sevigny, and have boasted her `Boys Don't Cry' performance as one of the greatest supporting performances of all time (and I still stand by that statement).  She is stunning in every sense of the word here, just milking her natural melancholia for all it's worth.  Hank Azaria (a more famed name in the cast) is natural and supremely believable as the respected Michael Kelly.  I normally am not a huge fan, but he works magic here.  Melanie Lynskey is one of those superb supporting actresses who can't seem to catch a break.  Sharing a film debut with Kate Winslet, you'd think she would have soared to stardom (and Oscardom) as well, but she is rather obscure.  Here she is her quirky and likable self.  Steve Zhan is another actor who shines more times than not, and here in another example of the talent that he rarely gets recognized for.But in the end this is a showdown between two men, Hayden Christensen and Peter Sarsgaard.  Christensen is remarkable here, really sinking into Glass and giving him a tense sense of reality.  This is the best he has ever been (which isn't saying a lot since he is generally underwhelming).  Sarsgaard is OUTSTANDING here.  This is not my favorite performance by the man, but it is one of the best supporting roles of the past decade (goes to show you what I think of his BEST work, which I will review next).  He just simmers on ever frame with this ever-building understanding of his circumstances.  When I mentioned that this film is `remarkably explosive' I was referring to the dynamics that come from Sarsgaard's transformation, for it is his characters gradual grasp of the situation that make for the most explosive of climax's.His Oscar snub is disgusting.In the end I highly, highly recommend this film.  I will give you a word of caution; if you are not into brooding character studies then this will bore you.  Like I mentioned, my wife loathed it, and I will also mention that out of the group of friends I watched this with last week, only one other person walked away with my exact sentiments.  It is a film that has an audience, and if you are privileged to be in that audience then you will discover something truly rewarding.",5,Completely shatters my recollection...,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,3975,"['saw', 'movie', 'back', '03', 'really', 'liked', 'My', 'wife', 'found', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'remember', 'being', 'pretty', 'engrossed', 'walked', 'away', 'really', 'enjoying', 'was', 'smart', 'provocative', 'look', 'field', 'am', 'very', 'intrigued', 'journalism', 'always', 'been', 'strong', 'dream', 'mine', 'What', 'funny', 'years', 'have', 'gone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'up', 'last', 'week', 'recollection', 'been', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'stellar', 'performances', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'needed', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'entertained', 'nothing', 'more', 'watched', 'again', 'friends', 'found', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'powerfully', 'controlled', 'film', 'really', 'is.This', 'film', 'remarkably', 'explosive.This', 'film', 'mesmerizing', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'journalist', 'who', 'managed', 'deceive', 'way', 'top', 'concocting', 'false', 'stories', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'when', 'online', 'reporter', 'suspicious', 'editor', 'start', 'crack', 'down', 'Stephen', 'world', 'hiding', 'fall', 'one', 'acquainted', 'Stephen', 'could', 'even', 'imagine', 'how', 'devastating', 'fall', 'was', 'going', 'be.I', 'really', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'everyone', 'involved', 'especially', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'films', 'writer', 'director', 'sharp', 'screenplay', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'informative', 'marvelous', 'way', 'Ray', 'tone', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'political', 'thriller', 'film', 'object', 'suspense', 'second', 'viewing', 'really', 'made', 'apparent', 'watch', 'film', 'pins', 'needles', 'waiting', 'fall', 'out', 'when', 'just', 'tidal-wave', 'emotional', 'impact.Not', 'what', 'expected.Taking', 'great', 'direction', 'Ray', 'stellar', 'cast', 'most', 'underused', 'underrated', 'actors', 'independent', 'cinema', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'have', 'boasted', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'performance', 'one', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'performances', 'time', 'still', 'stand', 'statement', 'stunning', 'sense', 'word', 'here', 'just', 'milking', 'natural', 'melancholia', 'worth', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'more', 'famed', 'name', 'cast', 'natural', 'supremely', 'believable', 'respected', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'normally', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'magic', 'here', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'one', 'superb', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'Sharing', 'film', 'debut', 'Kate', 'Winslet', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'soared', 'stardom', 'Oscardom', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'obscure', 'Here', 'quirky', 'likable', 'self', 'Steve', 'Zhan', 'actor', 'who', 'more', 'times', 'not', 'here', 'example', 'talent', 'rarely', 'recognized', 'for.But', 'end', 'showdown', 'two', 'men', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Christensen', 'remarkable', 'here', 'really', 'sinking', 'Glass', 'giving', 'tense', 'sense', 'reality', 'best', 'ever', 'been', ""n't"", 'saying', 'lot', 'generally', 'underwhelming', 'Sarsgaard', 'OUTSTANDING', 'here', 'not', 'favorite', 'performance', 'man', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'roles', 'past', 'decade', 'show', 'what', 'think', 'BEST', 'work', 'will', 'review', 'next', 'just', 'simmers', 'ever', 'frame', 'ever-building', 'understanding', 'circumstances', 'When', 'mentioned', 'film', 'remarkably', 'explosive', 'was', 'referring', 'dynamics', 'come', 'Sarsgaard', 'transformation', 'characters', 'gradual', 'grasp', 'situation', 'make', 'most', 'explosive', ""climax's.His"", 'Oscar', 'snub', 'end', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'word', 'caution', 'are', 'not', 'brooding', 'character', 'studies', 'then', 'will', 'bore', 'mentioned', 'wife', 'loathed', 'will', 'also', 'mention', 'group', 'friends', 'watched', 'last', 'week', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'walked', 'away', 'exact', 'sentiments', 'film', 'audience', 'are', 'privileged', 'be', 'audience', 'then', 'will', 'discover', 'something', 'truly', 'rewarding']",Shattered Glass
796486,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B0001907AI,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[3, 3]","I loved this movie.Hayden Christensen does a terrific job as the real life Stephen Glass, journalist for ""The New Republic,"" part time writer for ""Rolling Stone"" and ""George,"" and full time con man.He charms the educated staff at ""The New Republic"" where he's suitably diffident, helpful, and cunning.  He's also imaginative because most of his articles are made up.His new editor, Charles Lane, finally catches on when a reporter at the ""Forbes"" online magazine becomes suspicious of one of Glass's articles and does some research of his own.  Lane (who now works for the Washington Post) is played by Peter Saarsgard who first defends him, then comes to realize that Glass isn't a kid being fooled by his sources; rather he's a full blown con man who's been fooling the supposedly sophisticated staff of a well-respected journal.The tension between the two men is fascinating to watch.  As Glass reveals his dishonesty and tries to wheedle Lane into accepting his apologies, Lane's integrity and perception grow and we see what an appealing human being he is.  This very ordinary, decent man becomes a hero.Saarsgard rightly won awards for his performance, but he wouldn't have been as impressive if he hadn't had the whining and self serving Christensen character to play against.One point of concern.  In explaining the ease with which Glass fooled his fellow reporters and editors, the movie states that the average age at The New Republic was 26.  It also mentions that the magazine is a favorite on Air Force One, the President's plane.

796488,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B0001907AI,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[1, 2]","The Amazon acknowledgement of ""All the President's Men"" for  comparisons sake is just. Both movies are great storytelling of  what goes on behind the scenes of journalism, it's responsiblity and misuse. I'd' throw in movies like ""Call Northside 777, "" Citizen Kane,"" and even ""His Girl Friday,"" to some extent, as movies that paint credible pictures of journalism, albeit each in its own way- all my fave flicks about the daily rags. But ""Shattered Glass"" (a movie I watched after stumbling across it while scanning the many offerings on the Dish one day and thought, what the heck) goes even deeper into the responsibilities of journalism, and how easily those responsibilities can be abused. The ensemble cast is first rate. Peter Sarsgaard steals the show, Hayden Christiansen paints a picture of duplicity that's exclusive not only to journalism, but is the face of deception that many of us cross in our daily lives. And Hank Azaria, Mike Blum (Depserately Seeking Susan; Crocodile Dundee), Steve Zahn (You've Got Mail), and Chloe Sevigny all combine for an award worthy ensemble cast. ""Glass"" paints a solid behind the scenes picture of a newspaper or magazine, doing it with a diverse collection of personalities, lending credence and viability to the atmosphere that such a web of lies and deceit can take place in. But this is much more than a movie about journalism. Though the film is explicitly about Glass, his transgressions and betrayal to his profession and those he works for and with. It's about the Stephen Glasses we all know in any field of life- the extent some folks will go in their deception to portray themselves as something they are not. One can't watch Christiansen's performance and not think of someone we've crossed in our lives and seen the same behavior and tactics, the web of lies behind the facade of credibility and extent one is willing to go to continue the charade: the incredible stories backed by increasingly incredible stories, the mannerisms, the erratic behavior, the inability to look one in the eye without great effort when confronted. This movie is just as much about those who've mastered the art of deception and the lengths they'll go perpetuate it- the pathological liar. And Sarsgaard portrays the person inside all of us that wants so badly to get to the truth that, when not able to get it with generosity, the lengths we'll go to to maintain credibility, if not integrity. We've all seen the stories in the past decade or two where journalists (or persons) so desperate to be in the spotlight, to get the big story, that they conjur up stories so good to be true, that more than likely, they aren't. SIDENOTE: This was my first sampling of Sarsgaard and Sevigny, both of whom I'm a huge fan of now, confessing to an obssession with the talented and alluring Sevigny. I was attracted to her by her acting as much as her sex appeal in a relatively conservative role, to the point of which I've bought, rented and borrowed as many of her movies as possible (though not for the reasons many juveniles are obssessed with ""The Brown Bunny""). A talented actress who takes on roles for their quality, not the money, and is regarded as the queen of the independent movies. She makes some unusual choices, but this is the role that sold me.",5,"Outstanding!

With the red flags up, I charged ahead into this movie anyway, because I was on an airplane and had finished my book earlier than I had expected.Hayden Christianson is the charming rogue (Glass) at the center of the story, and we meet him early.  We know he's a charming rogue because the movie tells us that.  To look at him, he appears to be a little boy playing dress-up, with all the charisma and charm of a bottle of salad dressing.  His acting (excuse me, this is an Important Movie, so he is Acting) doesn't convey that he is a charming rogue.  But the other characters tell us how funny and charming he is, so I guess he really is.  The other characters are hip and young--indeed, so hip and young that it's hard to tell them apart.  Some of the scenes where they're all in a meeting room are unintentially hilarious, where the camera pans across generic white GQ-looking extra after generic white GQ-looking extra, and you wonder if they didn't just splice in the same guy again.  And what's up with all the white people?  For a progressive Democratic magazine, the New Republic is made out to look as WASPy as it gets, with nothing but earnest young white people as far as the eye can see.While Christianson is making up stories and passing them off as news, because he's so charming that no one fact checks him, there are internal politics at his magazine, with a Stodgy Old Editor not wanting to break tradition and run photos with stories.  Boo!  Hiss!  You can tell he's evil, or at least skewing that way, because the script says so.For this movie to work, you have to believe that Christianson is capable of snowing an entire magazine staff; that he is so affable, charming and audacious that he can do anything he wants and circumvent the normal safeguards at the publication.  The problem is that Christianson can't Act this way; he seems more like a befuddled high school intern who wandered out of the mailroom than the type of person who could get away with what he did.Some stuff happens.  Overly-dramatic, self-important stuff that wastes good actors like Hank Azaria.  Christianson helps teach a journalism class, which allows him to vocalize his inner dialogue.  That's great filmmaking, to move the camera slowly around a roomful of students while he drones on, trying to Act while the extras playing the students try to look enraptured.  You may want to go make a sandwich or something.  Don't bother pausing.The magazine finds out he lied.  They have a big meeting where the Stodgy Old Editor breaks the news to everyone.  Before the meeting, the Wise Old Receptionist, the Yoda of the film, tells him that if they only had photos in the magazine, Glass couldn't have gotten away with his fictional stories.  The Stodgy Old Editor is thus magically transformed into the Bad Guy, and Glass is off the hook for his breach of journalistic ethics.  Plus, we reinforce one of the hoariest movie cliches, which is that of the Wise Old Secretary/Receptionist.  Yawn.Then there's an ending, with plenty of opportunities for more Acting, and it's over.  Finally.Run, do not walk, from this movie.

The film looks at Stephen Glass, a young writer and associate editor for The New Republic who, in the mid- to late '90s, rose to notoriety with his vivid, colorful articles - many of which were later found to be, in whole or in part, simply products of his imagination.The movie focuses on the period in 1998 when Glass' jig was just about up. In order to cover his tracks, he's forced to fake his notes, manipulate office politics, create phantom voicemail accounts and manufacture Web sites and business cards. As depicted by ""Shattered,"" passing off fiction as journalism isn't just a despicable practice, it also appears to involve about four times more sweat than doing actual, honest work.It's a fascinating story that, on the whole, is deftly handled. Unfortunately, Hayden Christensen, who plays Glass, doesn't seem as skilled a con artist as the guy he's portraying had to have been. With his passive-aggressive apologies and transparent flattery, he's more of an Eddie Haskell than a convincing fraud. I'm a reporter at a newspaper that's a long way away from the infinitely more sophisticated, more competitive New Republic, yet Glass' manipulation, as rendered by Christensen, wouldn't fly in my newsroom for five seconds.As a result, the movie suffers somewhat and, while that may also be a fault of the writing, the script doesn't fail actors Peter Sarsgaard and Hank Azaria who, as Glass' editors Charles Lane and Michael Kelly, give smart, flawless performances and are the best reasons to see the movie (yes, Sarsgaard is every bit as good as the hype claims).Also solid is Steve Zahn as Forbes reporter Adam Penenberg, and the scenes in which he disproves one of Glass' articles fact-by-fact play like lighter reversals on ""All the President's Men.""On the DVD: The lone extra feature is a brisk ""60 Minutes"" segment on the real Glass, in which we see what a low-key, blank-eyed cipher he actually is. There's also a somewhat self-serving though no-less-interesting commentary track by Lane and writer-director Billy Ray that, ironically, points out the many inventions and dramatic licenses that were taken in order to make the story more cinematic.  It's too bad they didn't give the actual subject of the movie an opportunity to comment on the movie that's been made from an unfortunate, pathetic chapter of his life; that would've been something to hear.",3,"""Glass"" is see-through but still compels",1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,2685,"['March', 'was', 'big', 'month', 'ethically', 'challenged', 'journalists.First', 'infamous', 'ex-New', 'York', 'Times', 'reporter', 'Jayson', 'Blair', 'published', 'book', 'Burning', 'Down', 'My', 'Masters', 'House', 'tome', 'generated', 'reviews', 'uniformly', 'more', 'interesting', 'actual', 'contents', 'pages.Then', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'young', 'writer', 'associate', 'editor', 'New', 'Republic', 'who', 'mid-', 'late', ""'90s"", 'rose', 'notoriety', 'vivid', 'colorful', 'articles', 'many', 'were', 'later', 'found', 'be', 'whole', 'part', 'simply', 'products', 'imagination.The', 'movie', 'period', '1998', 'when', 'Glass', 'jig', 'was', 'just', 'up', 'order', 'cover', 'tracks', 'forced', 'fake', 'notes', 'manipulate', 'office', 'politics', 'create', 'phantom', 'voicemail', 'accounts', 'manufacture', 'Web', 'business', 'cards', 'depicted', 'Shattered', 'passing', 'off', 'fiction', 'journalism', ""n't"", 'just', 'despicable', 'practice', 'also', 'involve', 'four', 'times', 'more', 'sweat', 'doing', 'actual', 'honest', 'work.It', 'fascinating', 'story', 'whole', 'deftly', 'handled', 'Unfortunately', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'who', 'Glass', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'skilled', 'con', 'artist', 'guy', 'portraying', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'passive-aggressive', 'apologies', 'transparent', 'flattery', 'more', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'convincing', 'fraud', ""'m"", 'reporter', 'newspaper', 'long', 'way', 'away', 'infinitely', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'more', 'competitive', 'New', 'Republic', 'yet', 'Glass', 'manipulation', 'rendered', 'Christensen', 'would', ""n't"", 'fly', 'newsroom', 'five', 'seconds.As', 'result', 'movie', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'fault', 'writing', 'script', ""n't"", 'fail', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'who', 'Glass', 'editors', 'Charles', 'Lane', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'give', 'smart', 'flawless', 'performances', 'are', 'best', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', 'yes', 'Sarsgaard', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'hype', 'claims', '.Also', 'solid', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Forbes', 'reporter', 'Adam', 'Penenberg', 'scenes', 'one', 'Glass', 'articles', 'fact-by-fact', 'play', 'lighter', 'reversals', 'President', 'Men', 'DVD', 'lone', 'extra', 'feature', 'brisk', '60', 'Minutes', 'segment', 'real', 'Glass', 'see', 'what', 'low-key', 'blank-eyed', 'cipher', 'actually', 'also', 'somewhat', 'self-serving', 'no-less-interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'Lane', 'writer-director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'ironically', 'points', 'out', 'many', 'inventions', 'dramatic', 'licenses', 'were', 'taken', 'order', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'cinematic', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'actual', 'subject', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'comment', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'unfortunate', 'pathetic', 'chapter', 'life', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'something', 'hear']",Shattered Glass

The film may be slow moving, but it is truly engrossing and will keep your interest long after the credits have rolled.  What holds this film together, besides the stellar script, is the brilliant cast including the Oscar SNUBBED Peter Sarsgaard and the surprisingly on-point Steve Zahn.  The story follows Stephen as his career skyrockets thanks to his expert journalism, but to no ones knowledge, Glass has been fabricating his stories, embelishing and completly making up events to gain popularity and respect.  All in all Stephen just wanted people to like him, but it had great cost since his lies are bound to catch up to him.  Stephen worked for 'The New Republic' in the mid-ninties which at the time set the standard for journalism in the US.  That's what made his story so important for if you couldn't trust TNR then who could you trust?  Glass is exposed by a reporter (Zahn) who realizes theres something a little fishy and a bit far fetched about Glass's current article.  Wrongs, quite a few of them, must be made right.  Hank Azara plays Stephen's ex-boss and mentor, and Sarsgaard plays the new editor for TNR who is at first dispised but soon respected as he handles the situation with dignity.  Billy Ray (director) gives us a great look at the dark side of journalism and does well the explain the goings on at the office, office politics as their called, so we can truly see how Glass's deception was posible.  Steller supporting roles include Chloe Savigny and Rosario Dawson as well as Melanie Lynskey and the aformentioned Steve Zahn, but it truly is Christensen and Sarsgaard that steal the show and prove they were made for the art of film making by sinking their teeth into their roles and absorbing the essence of their charactors.

So I was amazed when the director (Billy Ray) was able to present in such a way as to not rely soley on the plot, but involve some great acting and a few side stories that worked quite well: Having Glass in a classroom telling his success story to high school students, showing the journalist who wanted to change her writing style to that of the successful Glass, and touching on the concept of what makes a great editor.This movie pulls you in right from the start and keeps you interested the whole way through.  I wouldn't even answer the phone while watching the movie.Hayden Christensen turned in a flawless performance as Stephen Glass.  It was a pleasure watching this young actor work his magic on screen.Peter Sarsgaard was also brilliant as the new editor at the magazine.

""Daniel""","[1, 1]","SHATTERED GLASS was the first movie written and directed by Billy Ray, a screenwriter who wrote or co-wrote, among others, the screenplay ofFlightplan (Widescreen Edition)andSuspect Zero (Widescreen Edition). As though SHATTERED GLASS is based on a true story, the movie is more the portrait of a man than the account of a [...] that shook the small world of journalism.SHATTERED GLASS is told in a flashback mode by Stephen Glass, the journalist a la mode in 1998. Stephen explains to a class of students how to write a good article.

This true story of magazine journalist Stephen Glass who wrote and published phony articles  is wonderfully told.  Though some questions remain answered, it tells how and why such a young and brilliant journalist would take such actions.  Such chain of events lead to a compelling conclusion.  The brilliant plot shows definite research in the subject.  Few other films have desplicted this matter so well.  The struggles and the thrills begin growing more intense when co-workers begin investigating the sources of Glass's latest artice.  Chain of events lead audiences wondering how much or if they should feel sorry for Glass.  Such question and others keep audiences watching closely up to the end, when they are answered.  The deception and the unremorseful actions are written and acted beautifully.  Christiansen's expressions give the movie theme its added edge.  His talents alone give the film the added interest.  &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; stars Chloe Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard reunite, once again giving amazing performances.  Sarsgaard's Golden Globe nominated role proves that he deserves to become a big name actor in the near future.  &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; is a great unforgettable drama that audiences of all kinds will enjoy.

At 94 minutes, you're unlikely to get more explosive drama for your buck.  There's no gunplay, there's no sex, and you already know how the story ends, so how come this is all so fascinating?  Credit director Billy Ray with constructing a script that has no dead spots whatsoever.And the cast!  George Lucas should never be allowed near an actor again.  Hayden Christiansen is a revelation as the weasally Stephen Glass, who slowly breaks down as each lie he has constructed is picked apart like a giant scab.  Peter Sarsgaard also shines as Glass' nemesis, Chuck Lane, who takes over the New Republic just as Glass' world begins to unravel.  Together, they take you through a meditation on the nature of lies and just how destructive it can be when people go to great lengths to preserve them (Fitting, then, that the setting here is Washington, DC).Shattered Glass is the finest meditation on office politics in recent history, and that includes the brilliant ""The Office"" TV series.  Here, as people take their jobs more and more seriously, office politics have real and powerful consequences that, in many ways, cannot be avoided.  If you put ambitious people in a high pressure workplace, some will inevitably clash, affecting the entire dynamic in that environment.I've said too much already.

796507,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0001907AI,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Directed and written by first-timer Billy Ray, this is a surprisingly effective character study told from the outside, as the protagonist remains a cipher throughout the story. In the central role, Hayden Christensen portrays journalist Stephen Glass, a writer for the Washington D.C.-based current events magazine, The New Republic, a publication whose staff is largely comprised of people under the age of thirty. As with any movie about the press from ""The Front Page"" to ""All the President's Men"", the need to get the best story first has always been key to the plot since it's an inherent part of the news business. But this time out, the journalist violates the cardinal rule of crossing into fiction with 27 of 41 stories he wrote for the magazine over two years, an unforgivable breach that throws the integrity of the news business out the window.The first half of the film focuses on Glass, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the magazine's late editor, Michael Kelly, and as such, an ambitious toady who insinuates himself into news staff with his imagination and talent. He effortlessly woos his co-workers with exhilarating story pitches delivered at staff meetings, so well positioned is he that his fabricated stories get past the magazine's fact checkers with ease. But from the get-go, there is something one cannot trust or respect about Glass, and Christensen is effective in showing these unattractive layers by emphasizing the juvenile, ""like-me"" behavior.  After the beloved Kelly gets fired and unpopular new editor Chuck Lane takes over, Glass' world really begins to unravel when Adam Penenberg, a writer for the online magazine Forbes Digital, catches wind of Glass' story entitled ""Hack Heaven,"" allegedly about a teenage computer hacker who manages to strike a lucrative deal working for a software company that he had attacked. When Penenberg begins to unravel the untruths, the pressure comes down hard and heavy on Glass, and this is where Ray's outside view of Glass proves invaluable since the perspective of the film switches to Lane in the second half. Clearly conflicted about Glass, Lane seeks the truth unabated with the clear mission to uphold the reputation of The New Republic. A subtle actor of precise technique, Peter Sarsgaard easily gives the film's best performance as Lane. There's an intensity that builds so believably, but is skillfully contained, especially in scenes when he's asked to unleash his anger and frustration. As he proves subsequently in ""Kinsey"", Sarsgaard has a constant aura of wariness that suits this role as well. The film shows Lane both at home and at work, and portrays him as a man who takes both duties seriously. Recognizable actors fill out the rest of the cast fitfully - an almost sedate Steve Zahn as Penenberg, a rather sanctimonious Hank Azaria as Kelly, a comparatively low-key Chlo Sevigny as a fact checker at the magazine.Most importantly, this 2003 movie shows the truth can be harder to obtain than most would imagine. With more information options available than ever, the importance of questioning one's sources can never be overstated. I have to say that the movie does veer sometimes into TV-movie-style twists and turns, which prevents it from resonating more thoroughly, but for a first-time directorial effort, Ray does a fine job conveying his message of compromised ethics and their ramifications on a free press. The DVD includes an intriguing ""60 Minutes"" interview with the real Glass, and the film is backed by a commentary track from Ray and the real Lane.",4,Ethically Bankrupt Glass Overshadowed by Conscientious Lane,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,3551,"['Directed', 'written', 'first-timer', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'character', 'study', 'told', 'outside', 'protagonist', 'cipher', 'story', 'central', 'role', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'journalist', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'writer', 'Washington', 'D.C.-based', 'current', 'events', 'magazine', 'New', 'Republic', 'publication', 'staff', 'largely', 'comprised', 'people', 'age', 'thirty', 'movie', 'press', 'Front', 'Page', 'President', 'Men', 'need', 'get', 'best', 'story', 'first', 'always', 'been', 'key', 'plot', 'inherent', 'part', 'news', 'business', 'time', 'out', 'journalist', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'crossing', 'fiction', '27', '41', 'stories', 'wrote', 'magazine', 'two', 'years', 'unforgivable', 'breach', 'integrity', 'news', 'business', 'window.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Glass', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'magazine', 'late', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'such', 'ambitious', 'toady', 'who', 'news', 'staff', 'imagination', 'talent', 'effortlessly', 'woos', 'co-workers', 'exhilarating', 'story', 'pitches', 'delivered', 'staff', 'meetings', 'so', 'well', 'positioned', 'fabricated', 'stories', 'get', 'magazine', 'fact', 'checkers', 'ease', 'get-go', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'respect', 'Glass', 'Christensen', 'effective', 'showing', 'unattractive', 'layers', 'emphasizing', 'juvenile', 'like-me', 'behavior', 'beloved', 'Kelly', 'fired', 'unpopular', 'new', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'over', 'Glass', 'world', 'really', 'unravel', 'when', 'Adam', 'Penenberg', 'writer', 'online', 'magazine', 'Forbes', 'Digital', 'wind', 'Glass', 'story', 'entitled', 'Hack', 'Heaven', 'allegedly', 'teenage', 'computer', 'hacker', 'who', 'strike', 'lucrative', 'deal', 'working', 'software', 'company', 'had', 'attacked', 'When', 'Penenberg', 'unravel', 'untruths', 'pressure', 'down', 'hard', 'heavy', 'Glass', 'where', 'Ray', 'outside', 'view', 'Glass', 'invaluable', 'perspective', 'film', 'switches', 'Lane', 'second', 'half', 'Clearly', 'conflicted', 'Glass', 'Lane', 'truth', 'unabated', 'clear', 'mission', 'uphold', 'reputation', 'New', 'Republic', 'A', 'subtle', 'actor', 'precise', 'technique', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'easily', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Lane', 'intensity', 'so', 'believably', 'skillfully', 'contained', 'especially', 'scenes', 'when', 'asked', 'unleash', 'anger', 'frustration', 'subsequently', 'Kinsey', 'Sarsgaard', 'constant', 'aura', 'wariness', 'suits', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Lane', 'home', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'duties', 'seriously', 'Recognizable', 'actors', 'fill', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'fitfully', 'almost', 'sedate', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Penenberg', 'rather', 'sanctimonious', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Kelly', 'comparatively', 'low-key', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'fact', 'checker', 'magazine.Most', 'importantly', '2003', 'movie', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'harder', 'obtain', 'most', 'would', 'imagine', 'more', 'information', 'options', 'available', 'ever', 'importance', 'questioning', 'one', 'sources', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'overstated', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'veer', 'sometimes', 'TV-movie-style', 'twists', 'turns', 'resonating', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'first-time', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Ray', 'fine', 'job', 'conveying', 'message', 'compromised', 'ethics', 'ramifications', 'free', 'press', 'DVD', 'intriguing', '60', 'Minutes', 'interview', 'real', 'Glass', 'film', 'backed', 'commentary', 'track', 'Ray', 'real', 'Lane']",Shattered Glass
796508,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0001907AI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","SHATTERED GLASS is all about a reporter (Stephen Glass, played by Hayden Christiansen in an unusually good dramatic turn) who totally invents stories. Whatever will happen next? This film was (I say ""was"") a favorite of mine since its release in 2003, though it was overshadowed by that other Big Fat Liar's movie (BELLY OF THE BEAST, Steven Seagal). This is a generally good movie, with solid acting though some of it is on the phoned-in side.Ah well, it's only Wallywood.SHATTERED GLASS, acceptable though it may be as film, is really the unbearable  true story of 'reverse-bullying'. A nasty little twenty-something from the 1990s (Glass) got himself a major reputation as a reporter for a snooty sociopolitical magazine, ""The New Republic"". This film beautifully captures the arrogance of the up-and-coming of the 1990s. I sometimes look upon the character of Glass with more pity than anything because I think this was a young man simply fighting to survive in this snob-eat-snob world.Turns out more than half of Glass' work was totally made up - not bad fiction, but he wrote this fiction in the worst of all places, an uppity magazine that prided itself on its integrity. In fact it is one of the things I recall about ""The New Republic"" that I liked. The fact that an online version of ""Forbes Magazine"" caught on to him makes it somehow all the more ironic. Or maybe it just makes it all the more moronic.The reverse-bullying part comes from Glass himself: he is constantly alternating between charming the pants off everyone and whining in corners like a baby with the crocodile tears streaming. You have to be a real sketch if your closest friends get angry and tell you to ""knock it off"" whenever you begin weeping.This film is about something solid and positive: it is about how we deal with dishonest people who don't seem to care about anything except their webs of lies. What irks me most is this film shows few of the consequences of Glass' careerist lying. The sorry reality is Glass destroyed much in his years of writing fiction when he ought to have been reporting news stories.If you can stand the interminable ""Are-you-mad-at-me"" line, the sad magician's tactics and girlish weeping of a silly Hayden Christiansen (was Glass really like that?) get the film. If you're curious about Glass himself, get the film. If you disliked ""The New Republic"" magazine and its pretentiousness, get the film.As I hear it told, the real Stephen Glass is at present working in a comedy troupe in NYC, unless they kicked him out for stealing jokes. It seems even his post-apocalyptic life is a lie, and his latter-day apologies were not accepted by anyone, anywhere. After he wrote an autobiographical novel, people hated him even more. And NO, this film is not based on Glass' novel. Though some believe it is, Glass actually rode the coat-tails and followed this film with his novel.How noble.Personally I really see nothing more than a bit-better-than-mediocre 98-minute time-killer, otherwise known as a ""popcorn movie"". There's no sex in this, no sexual interest because it seems Glass might be gay - more likely he's simply afraid of any intimacy and even invents a brother no one believes he actually has - and his closest relationship is with his editor (Hank Azaria). A bit of age really sharpens a film buff's perspective, and it sharpens even more the stink of a rotten compulsive liar.This is a more-or-less quality film, all in all, with almost everyone doing great acting (aside from the few stiff performances) and Christiansen was starting to show some flair as an actor here - which makes me sadly wonder what happened to him. I only saw him in two other movies and he was very good in those also.Most importantly, this family fare can serve the younger crowd as an object lesson: this shows how the 1990s operated, how news magazines of the era were gaining in progressive liberal power, and how lots of liars and con artists destroyed the progressive liberal dream.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[2, 2]","So says twentysomething journalist Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen) after describing virtually all his articles for the ""New Republic"" magazine.  Such a kidder, that Glass!  At first the viewers, along with the NR staff, assume Glass is being modest, wants to ingratiate himself with his less-talented, less-prolific colleagues, and deflect envy.  After all, this is a guy who has incoming calls from ""Rolling Stone"" and other publications which his colleagues (Melanie Lynskey, Chloe Sevigny) would love to be wooed by.  Yet he tells the secretary to put them all through to voice mail.  You gotta like a guy like that.But hold on a moment.  Turns out (spoiler alert) that there are a few holes in a story Glass wrote about a young man who winds up getting hired by the same company who he humiliated by hacking into their website.  Attempts by Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn), a writer at a rival publication, to track down names and phone numbers go nowhere.  Sensing that he's onto an expose, he pursues the story, forcing the new NR editor, Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) to pin down the facts for good.  Though Lane doesn't share the same affection for Glass as his colleagues, he sees him as a ""troubled kid,"" a term which turns out to be more accurate than anyone at the NR suspected.Attempting to extract the truth out of Glass is like trying to nail Jello to a tree, and Sarsgaard gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the editor saddled with a job he really doesn't want, on top of dealing with inter-office politics and a new family.  Christensen is also excellent as a guy who, when faced with the probability of his world collapsing, switches personas faster than a chameleon in a vain attempt to keep from being exposed as the fraud he is.  Was Glass a calculating sociopath or just a guy who made a lot of bad mistakes?

A small but poignant piece by freshman director Billy Ray chronicles the downfall of Stephen Glass, a subversive and charismatic journalist who single-handedly disgraced the heralded New Republic magazine with the fall of his career.I went into this movie rather skeptical, thinking I would have no patience for Glass' co-workers who we know are being duped from the very beginning. I planned on spending the entire film slapping my forehead thinking `Who on earth would've believed him?!' But the cast (including Peter Sarsgaard, Hayden Christensen, and a skillfully restrained Hank Azaria) paints a very convincing picture of office politics and friendships, and the instinctive trust we give others... that we NEED to give those around us, almost as a self-defense mechanism.Ray tells the story as a member of the press would; succinctly and impartially. One can tell Hayden Christensen is in his element, as he delicately depicts Glass as a character for whom the audience, who knows he's lying, actually find ourselves empathizing and wanting to trust. And the extremely underrated Peter Sarsgaard, as editor Chuck Lane who stands behind his enigmatic reporter and friend even as Glass charges him of prejudice and jealousy.Watch the film. Watch the Special Feature interview with the real Stephen Glass. Watch the film again. Notice the layers of Ray's direction and Christensen's portrayal of a very shifty, manipulative, and self-serving individual with the warmth and charm of a truly gifted pathological liar.

796512,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0001907AI,Emily Todd,"[2, 3]","""Shattered Glass"" is the unbelievable true story of Stephen Glass; a rising young star at ""The New Republic"" magazine in the late 1990's who's abrupt downfall is almost identical to that of Jayson Blair.  Consider the similarities between the two men's stories, both were successful young journalists at famous news publications (Blair, incase you didn't already know, worked at the Old Gray Lady, ""The New York Times"") until it was found that they both had concocted most of their most popular news stories.  In light of the Blair scandal, ""Shattered Glass"" is even more fascinating for audiences to watch.Aside from its subject matter, ""Shattered Glass"" is a wonderful film in its own right.  The script is quick and snappy, the acting stellar, and the film itself is remarkably suspenseful considering we already know how it's going to end before even setting foot in the theater.  I was surprised to find myself so deeply involved in this film and so concerned for Stephen Glass.  Audiences will either sympathize with Glass, as I did, and understand that it was the pressures of journalism that drove him to lie or they will find him to be repulsive liar.  I find it interesting that the filmmakers seem undecided on whether or not they have sympathy for Glass and thus leave Glass's morality for us to judge.  While I sympathized with Glass, my father took an entirely opposite stance.  I love it when a film strikes up a bit of debate!Hayden Christensen nailed this role.  For those of you out there left with a bad impression of Christensen after the ""Star Wars"" debacle, fear not, he more than proves himself in this film.  One might think his portrayal of Glass is overdone; the puppy dog earnestness, the nauseating sweetness, the impeccable manners; it all seems a bit much.  However, that is what Glass was/is really like.  Interviews upon interviews with Glass's coworkers and the man himself show this.

Based on a true story dating back to 1998, Director Billy Ray has managed to tell the story of how Stephen Glass smooth talked and buffaloed his way through the unsuspecting staff of The New Republic magazine manufacturing false stories that were printed as fact.  In telling this scandal Director Ray paces this quasi-documentary with such finesse that even knowing the final outcome the audience rides along with the tale with relentless speed.

796515,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B0001907AI,guillermoj,"[12, 13]","This is a gem of a movie should have received more commercial acclaim than it did when, as I think that it's one of 2003's very best. Although I did not see it during its theatrical run, I am glad that listened to a friend of mine who loved the movie when he saw it at the movies. It's so good that I am going to buy it, and I am not a big DVD buyer.Although many of you are already familiar with this hard to believe true story, as it received much press and even appeared in the television show ""60 Minutes,"" nothing you've heard can prepare you for this movie as its strength lies in its sublime acting, and even more importantly in the way the story is framed by writer and first time director Billy Ray. It makes for a quite a suspenseful and thrilling ride.Possible spoiler ahead: If you've never heard of Steven Glass or the events that this movie chronicles, you may want jump to the next two paragraphs as not knowing anything in advance could make your movie experience may even more pleasurable than for those who know a little about it. In a nutshell the movie tells the story of a journalist at The New Republic"" magazine, who had the unique talent to come up with and chronicle colorful stories that were a shot in the arm to a traditional magazine that was a must read mainly for policy-makers (yes, even Presidents) and other politicos.Even those of you who know that Mr. Glass will not be remembered for his reporting but for the series of events that led to his ultimate downfall, will enjoy what is in essence a universal story about ambition, power, manipulation, reinvention and that we should not always believe what hear or even see in print. This message is especially important with the advent of the internet.For those who skipped the previous paragraphs, the water is safe now. The movie brilliantly chronicles the ups and downs of a young journalist (played by Hayden Christensen in one of the year's best and most underrated performances) of a high-brow political magazine. At the start I mention that the movie's main strength lies in the manner in which it is framed, and I won't give that away.One interesting fact that you will find out in the director's commentary (which is an invaluable extra on this DVD) about the movie's greatest strength is that was originally not told in its eventual framework. It was a last minute decision made when the original structure failed to impress anyone, including the director himself. From seeing the movie, you'd never know that to be the case, and it's one of those inside stories that to me represent the very best of what DVD extras should be about.If it had not been for an additional couple of days of shooting after the initial wrap, the result was still have been good, but certainly not brilliant. While the release has no deleted scenes or outtakes (which is for the best as there is usually a reason for their exclusion from a film), I was overjoyed to hear the director's commentary over the entire movie as it is a lesson in filmmaking from a guy who directing his very first movie. The commentary was so interesting that I wound up in essence seeing the whole movie twice, as I saw it and immediately jumped into the commentary and I could not stop until it ended. Thank God that the movie is very tight and lasts just over 90 minutes.As indicated above, Hayden Christensen's performance as Stephen Glass is as good as there was during 2003 and shows that he's not a one trick pony. He should in no way be judged solely on his wooden work in the underwhelming ""Star Wars"" series as there must be a dumbing down bacteria in water of where George Lucas is filming this trilogy. Peter Sarsgaard who portrays Chuck Lane, Glass' editor of The New Republic, gives one of the most nuanced and brilliant performances ever captured on film. He plays a guy you want to dislike, but you just might find yourself rooting for before the movie ends. Sarsgaard would have been a major movie star in the '70s, yet I hold hope that this performance makes other directors see what a talent he is. The performances would be considered outstanding even if they were not based on real people, but downright brilliant when one considers how hard it is to walk the line between caricature and an honest portrayal of real people, especially when some of the real people in the story were actually present during the making of this film.There is really not a single performance that is not solid and it shows what great things can happen when a writer-director gives his all and is supported not only by a great cast but a crew that makes him look so masterful. In the commentary Ray gives specific credit to several experts in their respective fields who also supported him as a first time director. Even as a seasoned movie buff, I was surprised at my lack of appreciation of the people who make good directors look even better. Whether it's lighting, framing, scouting, or casting, the commentary made me want to know much more about the role of the people who we never get the public recognition that those in the forefront do. The director's commentary (maybe out of homage to journalism) highlights the few artistic liberties that he took in making this movie, which were supported by Chuck Lane, who also comments and expands on the words of Billy Ray.The last five minutes of the movie are worth seeing time and time again. Although this may not mean anything right know, pay close attention to the group of people that Glass is speaking to as there is more than irony in those scenes. No, there is no big shock that is revealed, but something entirely more subtle and honest to the movie's structure. This is a must-see film which easily earns 5 stars.",5,One of 2003's very best movies.

796517,A1J5TC13BSPA2M,B0001907AI,"James Simpson ""James Simpson""","[3, 3]","""Shattered Glass"" is an intriguing little sleeper that works as your typical arthouse/indie with several large doses of imagination. The plot details a reporter who works for a distingushed News magazine called ""The New Republic"" that is the magazine that is circulated to Air Force One. He is considered somewhat brilliant and the film begins with his perspective on being a Journalist and the world around him. Sympathies are with him but it's clear that the guy is a strange one. He seems to always be involved in outrageous stories and repeats himself often with lines about his work and does it suffice. Hayden Christensen plays the reporter, Stephen Glass as something of a cold fish. Perhaps, that's appropiate and while he is effective at times, at other times he just irritates, very much like he did as Darth Vader in the Star Wars prequels.Eventually Glass is found out by his new editor(Peter Sarsgaard) who discovers that the reporter is a pathological liar and a nutcase. The film has an interesting narrative beginning with Glass adressing a High School class about Journalism being prided over by a former English Teacher. This structure remains with the film throughout untill this too appears to be a ruse and only within Glass' mind.The film is ably presented and the story is certainly of interest with some strong performances by Hank Azaria as the former editor of The New Republic and his replacement editor,Peter Sarsgaard, who both deliver the film's most naturalistic performances. A problem with the rest of the cast is seemingly everyone else is ridiculously underwritten. Characters are introduced and dropped off without notice. Most appear interchangeable and there is no real attempt to add to these individuals. A point in the film that springs to mind is when a rival magazine(Forbes) begins to crack down on an article by Glass, the characters from this are just dropped off without any thought. It's also odd to see a familiar actress like Rosario Dawson wasted in such a small, thankless role in these scenes.Another unfortunate aspect is that the film is overloaded with a bombastic dramatic score that seems to dwarf the scope of the picture. Clearly, a smaller story like this would have benefited from a much more naturalistic approach but that unfortunately does not happen.Overall, this is certainly an interesting curio-piece about a fascinating true account of a troubled individual. It's well directed and has a good pace but clearly could have used some more finesse to keep it afloat.

By late 1998, Stephen Glass was the shame of the journalistic community, discovered to have made up persons, places, organizations, and details in most of his articles. This film is the story of what exactly happened in those crucial months.The two main characters are Stephen Glass (Hayden Christiansen) and his editor, Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard). By an unfortunate event in the shape of two ambitous on-line journalists (Steve Zahn, Rosario Dawson) looking to do a 'day two' story expanding on one of Glass's articles, Lane gradually discovers not only that Glass's sources have been invented, but that Glass had gone to unbelievable lengths to cover up that fact. With the pace of a detective film, we watch as Lane uncovers Glass's web of lies.What makes this film work is the chemistry between the cast. Christiansen and Sarsgaard do well in their roles of Glass and Lane, bringing an appropriate tension to their scenes. Chloe Sevegny does a notable job as Glass's friend and fellow journalist, reluctant to believe Lane's charges.In addition to a very interesting and well acted film, this DVD is to be noted for its special features, of which there are two. The first is a segment that newsmagazine 60 MInutes did on Stephen Glass, including an interview with Glass himself.

If all of them had been fabricated I couldn't care less, but on the face of it, it's pretty amazing that the boy Stephen Glass could get away with it not just once but dozens of times. He must have been a very cynical youth, thinking to himself, people don't even read the rag, they'll buy anything.Director Billy Ray does a good job exposing the late ""GEORGE"" magazine as a kind of only slightly more upscale National Enquirer. I don't know what to make of the suggestion that, if THE NEW REPUBLIC ran photographs, Glass's career of deceptions couldn't possibly have gotten off the ground. Are they serious or what? When I was an American boy growing up in France, officials in the 17th arrondissement found themselves in hot water for apparently looking the other way as a vast photo-based system of fraud threw their welfare system out of whack. Methinks there will always be people to pose for pictures just to get their picture in the magazine. There should be a sequel to SHATTERED GLASS exposing the ""Lonelygirl 15"" deceptions.The highlight of SHATTERED GLASS was the pleasure of seeing Chloe Sevigny, always a welcome presence in small pictures, but one who has long relied on her particular brand of charisma to do all her acting for her, here turning in a riveting and completely unexpected performance. The scenes in which her resentment and anger brim to the surface mark a moment in screen history, look everyone, Chloe is really acting! And her opposite number Rosario Dawson is almost as good. Those of us with long memories recall Chloe and Rosario as Larry Clark discoveries in his movie KIDS, and in the accompanying photo sets he produced for the high art crowd. It's nice to see the two great stars gathered together once again in another picture. Unfortunately the schemata of SHATTERED GLASS refused them any screen time together, much less any meaty scenes, I suppose it would have been too much to have a scene where a disenchanted ""Caitlin"" quite TNR and goes to work at the Forbes Digital Tool office where Rosario Dawson holds down a desk and looks so foxy!",4,Happy Reunion,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2220,"[""'m"", 'always', 'suspicious', 'articles', 'reporter', 'light', 'whole', 'new', 'subculture', 'had', 'previously', 'no', 'inkling', 'had', 'been', 'fabricated', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'face', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'boy', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'dozens', 'times', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'cynical', 'youth', 'thinking', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'rag', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'anything.Director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'good', 'job', 'exposing', 'late', 'GEORGE', 'magazine', 'kind', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'upscale', 'National', 'Enquirer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'suggestion', 'NEW', 'REPUBLIC', 'ran', 'photographs', 'Glass', 'career', 'deceptions', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'ground', 'Are', 'serious', 'what', 'When', 'was', 'American', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'France', 'officials', '17th', 'arrondissement', 'found', 'hot', 'water', 'apparently', 'looking', 'other', 'way', 'vast', 'photo-based', 'system', 'fraud', 'threw', 'welfare', 'system', 'whack', 'Methinks', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'people', 'pose', 'pictures', 'just', 'get', 'picture', 'magazine', 'should', 'be', 'sequel', 'SHATTERED', 'GLASS', 'exposing', 'Lonelygirl', '15', 'deceptions.The', 'highlight', 'SHATTERED', 'GLASS', 'was', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'always', 'welcome', 'presence', 'small', 'pictures', 'one', 'who', 'long', 'relied', 'particular', 'brand', 'charisma', 'do', 'acting', 'here', 'turning', 'riveting', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'performance', 'scenes', 'resentment', 'anger', 'brim', 'surface', 'mark', 'moment', 'screen', 'history', 'look', 'everyone', 'Chloe', 'really', 'acting', 'opposite', 'number', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'long', 'memories', 'recall', 'Chloe', 'Rosario', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'discoveries', 'movie', 'KIDS', 'accompanying', 'photo', 'sets', 'produced', 'high', 'art', 'crowd', 'nice', 'see', 'two', 'great', 'stars', 'gathered', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'picture', 'Unfortunately', 'schemata', 'SHATTERED', 'GLASS', 'refused', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'much', 'less', 'meaty', 'scenes', 'suppose', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'scene', 'where', 'disenchanted', 'Caitlin', 'quite', 'TNR', 'work', 'Forbes', 'Digital', 'Tool', 'office', 'where', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'down', 'desk', 'so', 'foxy']",Shattered Glass

Stephen knows how to mingle and to make people feel welcome as he wins their trust.  However, his charade is about to be discovered as one of his stories turns out to be pure fiction.

You really get a strong sense that these characters know and love each other. This movie is, at once, a crash course in journalism and a warning to those who would exploit the field's weaknesses. Hayden Christensen is convincing as Stephen Glass, who offers (ironically) really good advice on the value of a keen memory, good note-taking, and competent fact-checking. He also has a strong sense of what makes a good editor.Glass' classroom lecture, which culminates in one of the best ""I-should-have-seen-that-coming-but-did-not"" twist endings I've ever seen, is increasingly heartbreaking as you realize how cynically he is betraying everything he praises.I showed this movie to a classroom of journalism students who were unfamiliar with the plot. I decided not to tell them about it ahead of time. The result was interesting. Different students started calling out the nonsense at different points, but it wasn't until late in the (relatively short) film that folks realized just how deep Glass' deception ran.Odds are, if you're this deep into an Amazon.com page to get to this review, you already know the plot. My recommendation: share this movie with a friend, without telling him the plot, and enjoy watching both the film and the viewer.They say truth is stranger than fiction, but our willingness to believe that undermines our commitment to the truth.

796530,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001907AI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","I had a bad semester with students plagiarizing papers, catching a half-dozen of them.  What was upsetting was not their audacity but rather their stupidity.  It was not that the papers were clearly not their own work but rather than they did not meet the assignments, so that they would have received failing grades even if an internet search did not reveal their source in ten seconds.  Every time I find another plagiarized paper and see how little effort they put into cheating I am reminded of something a professor told me years ago, which was that to get away with plagiarism you had to work so hard to cover up what you are doing that you might as well have done the work in the first place.  With the case of ""New Republic"" reporter Stephen Glass you have to admit that he certainly put a lot of effort into making up sources and support for his stories, but with that much effort he could have just stuck to the truth.Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen) is the youngest writer at the ""New Republic"" and apparently knows everything he should be doing to be liked by his young co-workers.  The story of how he was found out is paralleled with his talking to the journalism class at Highland High School, while his teacher beams proudly.  While Glass tells the kids about the right way to get ahead in the wonderful world of journalism, we get to see whether he practices what he preaches in the real world.  It becomes clear that what Glass comes up with are stories that are funny, bright, and clever, filled with characters who seem too good to be true, from one about a convention of political novelties enjoying the Monica Lewinsky scandal to Young Republicans turning a National Convention into a drunken frat party.The reluctant hero of the film is Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), who becomes the young editor of the ""New Republic"" when Micheal Kelly (Hank Azaria) is fired).  Glass is worried Lane is jealous of his ability to come up with great stories, but, of course, that is not the real problem, which emerges when Glass comes up with his latest great story on Hackers.  The story is all about a teenage hacker who hits a company and then gets paid off to back off and leave the company alone.  The story is so great the editor at the on-line magazine for ""Forbes"" demands to know of his reporter, Steve Zahn (Adam Penenberg), why he did not get the story first?  Zahn is ticked off that he did not, and when he tries to do a follow up on the Glass piece it becomes clear there is something very wrong here, although the truth is so beyond belief that they people are thinking there has to be something else going on with the article.The result is like watching a building fall down in slow motion, because you keep thinking that the whole house of cards Glass has constructed is going to quickly fall apart.  But then at one point Glass explains to the class the complicated process by which stories are written, checked, rewritten, verified, and rewritten again before seeing publication.  The irony is that this process could not catch Glass in his web of lies before the stories were published and then slowed down the actual process of revealing his deception.  Of course, Glass is scrambling to plug the holes in the dike and it takes a while for Lane and the rest of the ""National Republic"" staff to accept what is going on with this guy they all seem to like so much.  You have to appreciate how much friendship got in the way of these people seeing the flaws in Glass and underscores why this is a story worth telling, even if you do not want to be a journalist when you grow up.The extras on this DVD are the ""60 Minutes"" interview with Stephen Glass, which features Chuck Lane, who does a fascinating commentary track with director Billy Ray.  The pair talk about not only where things come from and the accuracy of what we are seeing on screen, which is a reasonable concern given the topic, but the real world concerns of trying to understand why Glass was doing all of this.  This is one of the best commentary tracks for a feature film I have heard in several months and anybody who watches the movie has to treat themselves to this bonus as well.  Ironically, after his down fall Glass went on to write a novel, ""The Fabulist,"" which is supposed to be fictional story of a pathological liar who makes up newspaper stories but which apparently has more truth in it that most of the articles he wrote for the ""New Republic"" and other publications.",4,"Hey, boys and girls, see what happens when you plagiarize?",1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,4478,"['had', 'bad', 'semester', 'students', 'plagiarizing', 'papers', 'catching', 'half-dozen', 'What', 'was', 'upsetting', 'was', 'not', 'audacity', 'rather', 'stupidity', 'was', 'not', 'papers', 'were', 'clearly', 'not', 'own', 'work', 'rather', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'assignments', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'failing', 'grades', 'even', 'internet', 'search', 'did', 'not', 'reveal', 'source', 'ten', 'seconds', 'time', 'find', 'plagiarized', 'paper', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'effort', 'put', 'cheating', 'am', 'reminded', 'something', 'professor', 'told', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'get', 'away', 'plagiarism', 'had', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'cover', 'up', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'done', 'work', 'first', 'place', 'case', 'New', 'Republic', 'reporter', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'have', 'admit', 'certainly', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'making', 'up', 'sources', 'support', 'stories', 'much', 'effort', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'stuck', 'truth.Stephen', 'Glass', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'youngest', 'writer', 'New', 'Republic', 'apparently', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'be', 'liked', 'young', 'co-workers', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'found', 'out', 'paralleled', 'talking', 'journalism', 'class', 'Highland', 'High', 'School', 'teacher', 'beams', 'proudly', 'Glass', 'kids', 'right', 'way', 'get', 'ahead', 'wonderful', 'world', 'journalism', 'get', 'see', 'practices', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'clear', 'what', 'Glass', 'up', 'are', 'stories', 'are', 'funny', 'bright', 'clever', 'filled', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'one', 'convention', 'political', 'novelties', 'enjoying', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'scandal', 'Young', 'Republicans', 'turning', 'National', 'Convention', 'drunken', 'frat', 'party.The', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'film', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'young', 'editor', 'New', 'Republic', 'when', 'Micheal', 'Kelly', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'fired', 'Glass', 'worried', 'Lane', 'jealous', 'ability', 'come', 'up', 'great', 'stories', 'course', 'not', 'real', 'problem', 'when', 'Glass', 'up', 'latest', 'great', 'story', 'Hackers', 'story', 'teenage', 'hacker', 'who', 'company', 'then', 'paid', 'off', 'back', 'off', 'leave', 'company', 'alone', 'story', 'so', 'great', 'editor', 'on-line', 'magazine', 'Forbes', 'know', 'reporter', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Adam', 'Penenberg', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'story', 'first', 'Zahn', 'ticked', 'off', 'did', 'not', 'when', 'do', 'follow', 'up', 'Glass', 'piece', 'clear', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'here', 'truth', 'so', 'belief', 'people', 'are', 'thinking', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'article.The', 'result', 'watching', 'building', 'fall', 'down', 'slow', 'motion', 'keep', 'thinking', 'whole', 'house', 'cards', 'Glass', 'constructed', 'going', 'quickly', 'fall', 'apart', 'then', 'one', 'point', 'Glass', 'class', 'complicated', 'process', 'stories', 'are', 'written', 'checked', 'rewritten', 'verified', 'rewritten', 'again', 'seeing', 'publication', 'irony', 'process', 'could', 'not', 'catch', 'Glass', 'web', 'lies', 'stories', 'were', 'published', 'then', 'slowed', 'actual', 'process', 'revealing', 'deception', 'course', 'Glass', 'scrambling', 'plug', 'holes', 'dike', 'while', 'Lane', 'rest', 'National', 'Republic', 'staff', 'accept', 'what', 'going', 'guy', 'seem', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'appreciate', 'how', 'much', 'friendship', 'got', 'way', 'people', 'seeing', 'flaws', 'Glass', 'why', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'journalist', 'when', 'grow', 'up.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', '60', 'Minutes', 'interview', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'who', 'fascinating', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'pair', 'talk', 'not', 'only', 'where', 'things', 'come', 'accuracy', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'screen', 'reasonable', 'concern', 'given', 'topic', 'real', 'world', 'concerns', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'Glass', 'was', 'doing', 'one', 'best', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'feature', 'film', 'have', 'heard', 'several', 'months', 'anybody', 'who', 'movie', 'treat', 'bonus', 'as', 'well', 'Ironically', 'down', 'fall', 'Glass', 'went', 'write', 'novel', 'Fabulist', 'supposed', 'be', 'fictional', 'story', 'pathological', 'liar', 'who', 'up', 'newspaper', 'stories', 'apparently', 'more', 'truth', 'most', 'articles', 'wrote', 'New', 'Republic', 'other', 'publications']",Shattered Glass
796531,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001907AI,Lawyeraau,"[55, 58]","This is a superb directorial debut by Billy Ray, who also wrote the script for this engrossing film. It tells the true story of how one journalist, Stephen Glass (Hayden Christiansen), a star journalist for the self-styled, in-flight magazine for Air Force One, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, bamboozled his editors for years with bogus stories. This was to have a devastating impact on a magazine that was well-respected in the political community.The film is a riveting study of a pathological liar who had the need to be the center of attention. For years, Stephen Glass had regaled his colleagues with journalistic feats, only to have them eventually discover that they were mere mumbo jumbo, as few of them had little more than a grain of truth to them. Stephen Glass is portrayed as a slightly obnoxious, self-deprecating character, who binds his colleagues to him through his smarmy, somewhat ingratiating. personality.Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria) is the first editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; with whom Stephen Glass worked. When Kelly finds something questionable in one of the stories submitted by Glass, Stephen is able to explain it away, and the incident is glossed over. When Kelly is fired by the publisher, Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) takes over under difficult circumstances, as the staff is loyal to Kelly and resentful of Lane. Still, Lane perseveres, occasionally crossing swords with Stephen Glass.All comes to a head when a reporter from another publication questions the veracity of one of Stephen's stories. An inside investigation by an anguished and angry Chuck Lane clearly shows that Stephen's story is not fact based but, rather, an elaborate deceit, false from beginning to end. Stephen's journalistic house of cards comes tumbling down around him, rocking the integrity of The New Republic. Chuck Lane is placed in the difficult position of exposing the full breadth of Stephen's journalistic perfidy, which ended up being widespread.The cast of the film is excellent overall, though I did find that Hayden Christiansen's portrayal of Stephen Glass paints him as too obvious a liar. I found it a tad difficult to believe that his colleagues gave him as much credence as they did. Chloe Sevigny contributes a fine performance as fellow journalist, Caitlin Avey, who was one of Stephen's bamboozled friends.Hank Azaria gives a fine portrayal of popular editor Michael Kelly, which shows that he can handle serious dramatic roles as adeptly as he handles comedic ones. The stand out performance, however, is that of  Peter Sarsgaard, whose understated, poignant portrayal of  Kelly's replacement, the beleaguered, unpopular Chuck Lane, is sensitive yet very powerful and complex.The DVD has first class audio and visuals, as well as an excellent audio commentary by both the director and Chuck Lane.

796532,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0001907AI,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","I love The New Republic magazine and have a subscription.  But I started reading it a mere two years ago, well after the scandal of 1998, in which a Stephen Glass, a boy-wonder reporter, was proven to have fabricated no less than 27 stories.  How could this have happened in this staid political magazine, which hadn't changed much since its early beginnings in 1914 and is so low key that it doesn't even have photographs?Well, Stephen Glass, brilliantly played by Hayden Christensen, was likable.  He was the self-effacing, quiet type who would bring lunch to a fellow-staff member on a deadline.  He told humorous stories and kept people smiling.  And, most of all, he wrote the kind of stories that everyone wanted to write.  His writing was always peppered with the kind of quotes that put life into the story.  And he was excellent at his craft.  Everyone loved him.  Problem was that most of his stories were partially or completely fabricated.When veteran editor, Jack Kelly, is fired, one of the writers, Chuck Lane is promoted to take his place.  Everyone hates him because they had loved the older editor. Peter Sasgaard plays this role with just the right amount of angst of a young man who is slightly unsure of himself  and has been given difficult job to do.  And, as the story of Stephen Glass's lies begins to break, we all can identify with this harried editor.  This time Steven Glass had gone too far.  He wrote a story about a convention of hackers and a young teenager who was courted by and awarded some big bucks to work for the company he just had hacked.  When the online publication ForbesOnline, saw this story, they immediately started asking questions about Glass's sources.Stephen Glass began to lie. The lies got bigger.  His excuses got stranger.  He even created a false website and some false voice-mail boxes.  His own editor wanted to believe him.  But the evidence mounted.  And, eventually Glass was discovered and fired.All this took place a mere six years ago but I couldn't help being reminded at how technically advanced we've all come since then.  And Glass was able to get away with some things just because his editor was unwise in the world of computers.I really did get into the story, which was well paced and well acted.  And then, as a special bonus on the DVD, there was a recent interview with Glass from ""60 Minutes"".  Glass says he's reformed after years of therapy and has recently written a novel.  He has also graduated from law school and now has a law degree.  Whether or not he'll ever be able to practice law is in question, however, due to his background.  He came across as sincere and believable.  But we all now understand that he always was able to do that.  Frankly, I would never trust him.",5,Fabricated stories got this wonder-boy journalist fired!,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2759,"['love', 'New', 'Republic', 'magazine', 'have', 'subscription', 'started', 'reading', 'mere', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'well', 'scandal', '1998', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'boy-wonder', 'reporter', 'was', 'proven', 'have', 'fabricated', 'less', '27', 'stories', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'staid', 'political', 'magazine', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'early', 'beginnings', '1914', 'so', 'low', 'key', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'photographs', 'Well', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'was', 'likable', 'was', 'self-effacing', 'quiet', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'bring', 'lunch', 'fellow-staff', 'member', 'deadline', 'told', 'humorous', 'stories', 'kept', 'people', 'smiling', 'most', 'wrote', 'kind', 'stories', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'write', 'writing', 'was', 'always', 'peppered', 'kind', 'quotes', 'put', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'excellent', 'craft', 'Everyone', 'loved', 'Problem', 'was', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'partially', 'completely', 'fabricated.When', 'veteran', 'editor', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'fired', 'one', 'writers', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'promoted', 'take', 'place', 'Everyone', 'had', 'loved', 'older', 'editor', 'Peter', 'Sasgaard', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'angst', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'slightly', 'unsure', 'been', 'given', 'difficult', 'job', 'do', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'lies', 'break', 'can', 'identify', 'harried', 'editor', 'time', 'Steven', 'Glass', 'had', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'wrote', 'story', 'convention', 'hackers', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'was', 'courted', 'awarded', 'big', 'bucks', 'work', 'company', 'just', 'had', 'hacked', 'When', 'online', 'publication', 'ForbesOnline', 'saw', 'story', 'immediately', 'started', 'asking', 'questions', 'Glass', 'sources.Stephen', 'Glass', 'began', 'lie', 'lies', 'got', 'bigger', 'excuses', 'got', 'stranger', 'even', 'created', 'false', 'website', 'false', 'voice-mail', 'boxes', 'own', 'editor', 'wanted', 'believe', 'evidence', 'mounted', 'eventually', 'Glass', 'was', 'discovered', 'fired.All', 'took', 'place', 'mere', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'reminded', 'how', 'technically', 'advanced', ""'ve"", 'come', 'then', 'Glass', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'things', 'just', 'editor', 'was', 'unwise', 'world', 'computers.I', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'well', 'acted', 'then', 'special', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'was', 'recent', 'interview', 'Glass', '60', 'Minutes', 'Glass', 'reformed', 'years', 'therapy', 'recently', 'written', 'novel', 'also', 'graduated', 'law', 'school', 'now', 'law', 'degree', 'not', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'practice', 'law', 'question', 'however', 'due', 'background', 'came', 'sincere', 'believable', 'now', 'understand', 'always', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'Frankly', 'would', 'never', 'trust']",Shattered Glass
796533,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B0001907AI,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[2, 3]","Shattered Glass is a tour de force, a deftly built house of cards that falls in disarray when a reporter for The New Republic Magazine, Stephen Glass, is exposed as a charlatan. Serious journalism has rules, all articles carefully fact-checked in a tedious, but necessary process before being sent to print. In a fluke, an online journal, Forbes Digital, fact-check's Glass's ""Hacker Heaven"". The Forbes reporter, played by Steve Zahn, is curious about the allegations made by Glass; the deeper he digs, the more questions arise about the authenticity of the story authored by The New Republic's golden boy. ""Hacker Heaven"" is full of errors and misinformation, leading to serious questions about the reliability of Glass's sources and the authenticity of the article. Glass has exploited a hole in the fact-checking system: in some articles, the only source material is provided by the author's notes.Glass (masterfully played by Hayden Christenson) begins a frantic song and dance to cover his tracks, but his editor, Charles Lane (an equally impressive Peter Sarsgaard), is increasingly suspicious of the popular and prolific Glass. The more Lane pushes, the worse it gets, until Glass breaks down, admitting that he took a few liberties with his facts, made a few assumptions. In his zeal to make a name for himself, Glass has surrendered his journalistic ethics. The extent of his betrayal grows increasingly obvious to Lane. Glass' denouement is a stunning dramatic moment, each lie falling apart before a disgusted Lane, who sits in the reception area of the office,  surrounded by copies of The New Republic, all with questionable stories authored by Glass.In one powerful scene, of which there are many, primarily between Glass and Lane, Stephen manipulates the other writers at The New Republic, convincing them that he is being railroaded by an editor who is out to destroy him. But Lane is adamant, finally forced to fire the histrionic Glass. Even as he stands convicted, Glass refuses to accept the inevitable. With a great supporting cast, Hank Azaria, Chloe Sevigny and others, director Billy Ray focuses on Glass and Lane, a slow dance in which Stephen thrusts and parries, while Lane circles patiently, watching.This is an important movie, exposing the inherent flaws of reporting in an electronic age, where information can be manipulated by a creative reporter on the trail of notoriety. For those who love journalism, this is a fascinating expose of the vulnerability of a national publication's reputation. Brilliantly acted, both Christenson and Sarsgaard perfectly render their complicated characters; by the end, twenty-seven of Glass's forty-one pieces for the magazine were falsely predicated on his falsified notes. In a stunning observation, the receptionist at the magazine speaks to Lane about preventing the scandal: ""How could you make up a story if everyone had to be photographed?""

796536,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0001907AI,M. Burns,"[15, 18]","When Billy Ray's new film, Shattered Glass, begins we hear the enthusiastic narration of the film's quasi-title character, Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen), who is happily relaying his feelings about journalism and how an article with substance may not necessarily be as great as an article with character. This sounds quaint and noble coming from the lanky Glass, who enters the film doing one of the things that he seems to do best - observing things around him. He enters his alma mater to speak to a journalism class about the subject, and we also learn that he is a contributing writer to George, Rolling Stone, and the associate editor of The New Republic. He is a celebrity of the first order in the world of budding journalists - he may be the fresh fish of The New Republic, but he can own an audience. This rapt audience of students becomes the frame that flashes back to the chronological beginning of Shattered Glass, and the movie begins its steady course on the emotional and ethical rollercoaster that it becomes.As of early 1998, Glass is an esteemed writer on the staff of The New Republic. Sure, the staff's median age is 26, but he's the youngest and also a favorite of editor Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria). His co-workers view him as a superior even with their age or seniority above him, and in fact: he is. Glass can weave a story like no one else on the staff, and it shows in the meetings where he tantalizes his coworkers with details of his next article. Things take a turn, though, and Kelly is fired with Glass's rival, Chuck Lane (Sarsgaard) stepping in. When Lane hears of the Republic's boss's intent of firing Kelly, he immediately steps back and doesn't want to be a part of it for he considers Kelly a friend. When Kelly is fired, though, Glass and his co-workers see Lane as a villain while the audience has seen what an upstanding character he really is.Things go downhill with Lane as editor, and not with the magazine. Glass publishes an article called ""Hack Heaven"" that gets much attention from an online magazine, but not exactly the kind of attention the Republic would want. Company names don't check out, sources are unreachable, and the seeds of doubt about Glass' integrity are sewn.. We don't see things from Glass's point of view, but rather from the perspective of the online mag trying to expose him and Lane, who wants to believe Glass but is beginning to lose faith. Christensen becomes truly amazing here. He's pushed into a corner with the investigation of his article's integrity, but he maintains that it all checks out. He never gives anything away in his slow unraveling. Sarsgaard really stands out, though, and an Oscar nom for Supporting Actor had better come his way. The emotional spiral of the movie is really seen through him, and he alternates between doubt, despair, and anger with such nuance that he practically owns the movie.Sarsgaard would own the movie if Christensen didn't make Glass such a likeable character, even as he is eventually revealed for what he truly is. Glass is the kind of movie that puts your mind and your stomach in a pretzel, but not in a Usual Suspects or Vanilla Sky way. The mind-bending of the film exists on a purely emotional and ethical level, and it's refreshing, considering the manipulative junk that is out most of the time (*cough* Runaway Jury *cough*). Movies like Jury present its narrative with little motivation or reason behind its characters, but Glass lets it all fly with such supported precision, it's quite a feat. We never learn much about Stephen Glass's history, but there's a ponit behind it - the movie isn't about why he did it, but what he did and how. From trailers and even my review, it may become obvious exactly what Glass did, but the depth and the impact of his actions aren't really revealed until the end of the film.The facts in the movie certainly take twists and turns that make it seem more typical, but the 'facts' don't really drive the narrative - the characters do. Sarsgaard makes a speech to another character toward the end of the film all about journalistic integrity and ethical duty, and in any other movie it would come off as silly and pretentious. In Glass, it gets to the heart of it all. Even though Stephen Glass knew what words could do and used it to his advantage in the film, director Billy Ray's script wastes not one word. Movies like this are a gift to its actors, and whatever the results in February, Christensen has topped himself as Kevin Kline's son in Life as a House and given a (so-far) career-defining performance that shows great promise. Sarsgaard has had a few bit parts in the past, but he blasts onto the screen here with an incredibly intense role.Shattered Glass dissects issues of morality and ethics in the field of journalism in a way that some movies could never even begin to touch. It's not about actions or plot twists or MacGuffins, but it's about changes in the movie's characters that can never really be predicted. Glass is a thriller in the best sense of the word, because it gets its thrills from things that should be tapped into more often. Shattered Glass is a step above the rest of the 'thrillers' with which it will be unfortunately placed, not to mention, it&#8217;s about as great as anything you'll see all year. Despite all the lies you'll hear in the course of the movie, that's not one. Shattered Glass is a great step forward for human drama on film, and one of the best movies made about journalism.",5,An essential film on journalism and morality - compelling!,1073865600,"01 12,

The only think that confused me about this movie at first was that it was a bit unclear what scenes were occurring in ""present tense,"" since there are so many flashbacks.

Apart from Glass' editor (played by Peter Sarsgaard), there are no heroes in this tale. If you watch the 60 Minutes interview (included on DVD), you'll see that Hayden Christensen has captured Glass' odd physical presence and vocal stylings.

The movie focuses on this pathological liar, the determined editor who brings him down and the effect it has on all involved.  The movie's narrative foundation in which Glass talks about his success in his hometown is appropriately misleading as flashbacks reveal what led to this journalistic faux pas.  Hayden Christensen as Glass is mesmerizing; his lies are obvious to the viewer, but one can see how he fooled his cohorts.  Peter Sarsgaard is absolutely astonishing in his brilliantly understated yet powerful performance as Chuck Lane, the new editor who has to face the loyal staff who adored their previous editor (played with relish by the under-rated Hank Azaria).  Oscar nominee Chloe Sevigny (Boys Don't Cry) is very good as Glass' best friend and coworker.  As Glass' lies fall down around him, we see just how truly manipulative and pathological he really is.  Director Billy Ray makes what could have been a rather cerebral movie into an involving suspense story.  The extras include an interview with the real Stephen Glass on 60 Minutes that lets us see how truly disturbed Glass was.

796541,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0001907AI,Michael Crane,"[2, 3]","""Shattered Glass"" is a stunning and fantastic film, and I can't believe it took me this long to finally watch it.  I never really saw it advertised when it was out in theatres.  A very rare thing happened when I watched this... I watched it again, immediately.  Then, I watched it again the next day.  Not too many movies can do that for me, but this one did and it is a fine film based on a true story that will have you asking the question, ""What news source can I really trust?""Stephen Glass is the youngest reporter working for ""The New Republic,"" a well respected news magazine.  He's nice to everybody and he does his best to make everyone happy.  His news stories make him a star, since he sometimes goes undercover to get the story.  However, that all changes when his sources and facts become questionable on a piece that he did on a hackers conference.  When the new editor of ""The New Republic,"" Chuck Lane realizes that there's a problem and confronts Glass, and going over his sources and facts one by one, a whole avalanche is created and this once prominent news reporter is exposed for what he truly is.I have to admit that I never heard this story before, so I was even more shocked when I watched the film.  I love true stories like this, because it gives you an interesting take on past events... and this is a scandal that isn't even really that old!  The film does a great job of hooking you in from the very first minute.  Writer and Director Billy Ray knew that this was an important story to tell, and he achieves that by showing us all with his craft.  He gives us all of the necessary pieces to the puzzle, never leaving a moment that is nothing more but ""filler.""  The movie is constructed and executed flawlessly, if you want my honest opinion.These actors are no longer actors in our eyes, but they become the actual real people.  And because there aren't too many big names in this movie, that makes it all the more realistic.  I didn't even recognize Hayden Christensen when I first saw him, and he was able to convince me that he was in fact ""Stephen Glass.""  Yet, I have to say that the real showstopper is Peter Sarsgaard, who plays ""Chuck Lane.""  He is an absolute juggernaut, because he doesn't seem like a major player at the beginning.  He's very quiet and non-threatening, but then when you're not expecting it he goes for the gusto and really delivers one memorable performance.The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but the little things that are included are extremely worth-while.  Extras included are commentary by Billy Ray and the real Chuck Lane (although this isn't mentioned on the box) and a ""60 Minutes"" piece that is an interview with the real Stephen Glass.  I highly recommend checking out the interview, for you will see how perfectly Christensen played him.  I do wish that the DVD could've included a little more, as I'm sure there were more news channels that followed this unbelievable story.  Still, that is the only thing that I found lacking and that really has nothing to do with the actual film.""Shattered Glass"" is extremely entertaining and surprisingly revealing.  Again, I went into this never hearing of this scandal, but now that I know a little more about it I would like to find out more.  If you're interested in movies based on true events, then this is really something you should see.  It's a pretty short movie, so it's not like it would even take up your entire night.  This has quickly become a new favorite of mine, and I can see myself watching this movie again very soon.  An excellent film that should've gotten more recognition. -Michael Crane",5,"""Are you mad at me...?""",1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,3631,"['Shattered', 'Glass', 'stunning', 'fantastic', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'took', 'long', 'finally', 'watch', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'advertised', 'when', 'was', 'out', 'theatres', 'very', 'rare', 'thing', 'happened', 'when', 'watched', 'watched', 'again', 'immediately', 'Then', 'watched', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'did', 'fine', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'asking', 'question', 'What', 'news', 'source', 'can', 'really', 'trust', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'youngest', 'reporter', 'working', 'New', 'Republic', 'well', 'respected', 'news', 'magazine', 'nice', 'everybody', 'best', 'make', 'everyone', 'happy', 'news', 'stories', 'make', 'star', 'sometimes', 'undercover', 'get', 'story', 'However', 'changes', 'when', 'sources', 'become', 'questionable', 'piece', 'did', 'hackers', 'conference', 'When', 'new', 'editor', 'New', 'Republic', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'problem', 'confronts', 'Glass', 'going', 'sources', 'facts', 'one', 'one', 'whole', 'avalanche', 'created', 'once', 'prominent', 'news', 'reporter', 'exposed', 'what', 'truly', 'is.I', 'have', 'admit', 'never', 'heard', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'love', 'true', 'stories', 'interesting', 'take', 'past', 'events', 'scandal', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'old', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'hooking', 'very', 'first', 'minute', 'Writer', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'knew', 'was', 'important', 'story', 'tell', 'showing', 'craft', 'necessary', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'never', 'leaving', 'moment', 'nothing', 'more', 'filler', 'movie', 'constructed', 'executed', 'flawlessly', 'want', 'honest', 'opinion.These', 'actors', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'actors', 'eyes', 'become', 'actual', 'real', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'big', 'names', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'able', 'convince', 'was', 'fact', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'have', 'say', 'real', 'showstopper', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'absolute', 'juggernaut', ""n't"", 'seem', 'major', 'player', 'beginning', 'very', 'quiet', 'non-threatening', 'then', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'gusto', 'really', 'one', 'memorable', 'performance.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'offer', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'extremely', 'worth-while', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'commentary', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'real', 'Chuck', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'box', '60', 'Minutes', 'piece', 'interview', 'real', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'interview', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'perfectly', 'Christensen', 'played', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'could', ""'ve"", 'included', 'little', 'more', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'more', 'news', 'channels', 'followed', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'Still', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'lacking', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'actual', 'film', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'surprisingly', 'revealing', 'Again', 'went', 'never', 'hearing', 'scandal', 'now', 'know', 'little', 'more', 'would', 'like', 'find', 'out', 'more', ""'re"", 'interested', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'then', 'really', 'something', 'should', 'see', 'pretty', 'short', 'movie', 'not', 'would', 'even', 'take', 'up', 'entire', 'night', 'quickly', 'become', 'new', 'favorite', 'mine', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'very', 'soon', 'excellent', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'more', 'recognition', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Shattered Glass

Hayden Christensen plays Glass, whose self-deprecating, obnoxiously ingratiating manner somehow blinds his co-workers to his machinations, all while he makes self-righteous speeches about journalistic integrity. Christensen's portrayal of Glass is convincing enough to paint the man as a real character, but I hope Glass was a better liar in reality than he is in this film, because it left me dumbfounded that anyone would have ever believed a word he said. The film's stand-out performance is Peter Sarsgaard's portrayal of &quot;The New Republic&quot; editor, Chuck Lane, under whose authority Stephen Glass was exposed and sent packing. Chloe Sevigny and Hank Azaria also give memorable performances as fellow journalist Caitlin Avey and Michael Kelly, who was the magazine's editor before Chuck Lane, respectively. Stephen Glass was a pathological liar and a con artist, but far more interesting than Glass are the holes in journalism's fact-checking systems that his success revealed and the willingness of a bunch of the nation's supposedly bright up-and-coming journalists to believe things that were so obviously preposterous. Director Billy Ray has done an admirable job of dramatizing this true story with an impressive script which he wrote himself, based on an article by H. G. Bissinger. &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; is an interesting look at integrity, gullibility, and delusion in those who write the news and those who read it. And Peter Sarsgaard's performance is one of the best of 2003.The DVD: There aren't many bonus features, but what's there is excellent. There is a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview with the real Stephen Glass in which he recounts how and why he started fabricating new stories. There is also an audio commentary by director Billy Ray and the real Chuck Lane, the editor who discovered the extent of Stephen Glass' deception. This is one of the best audio commentaries I've heard on a film. Ray and Lane are both  articulate and engaging. The commentary doesn't meander or have awkward silences. Lane contributes a lot of additional information on Glass and the workings of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Ray talks about filming, editing, and story-telling decisions. Sitting through the film a second time to listen to the commentary won't bore you to tears. If Stephen Glass' story interests you at all, I highly recommend both the commentary and the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview.",5,The Fourth Estate a Glass House?,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,2812,"['1999', 'quot', 'New', 'Republic', 'quot', 'magazine', 'so', 'prided', 'insightful', 'political', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'plunged', 'scandal', 'when', 'was', 'discovered', 'one', 'magazine', 'star', 'reporters', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'had', 'fabricated', 'many', 'stories', 'quot', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'quot', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'fall', 'bright', 'young', 'star', 'pariah', 'journalistic', 'community', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Glass', 'self-deprecating', 'obnoxiously', 'ingratiating', 'manner', 'somehow', 'co-workers', 'machinations', 'self-righteous', 'speeches', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'Christensen', 'portrayal', 'Glass', 'convincing', 'enough', 'paint', 'man', 'real', 'character', 'hope', 'Glass', 'was', 'better', 'liar', 'reality', 'film', 'left', 'dumbfounded', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'believed', 'word', 'said', 'film', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'portrayal', 'quot', 'New', 'Republic', 'quot', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'authority', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'was', 'exposed', 'sent', 'packing', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'also', 'give', 'memorable', 'performances', 'fellow', 'journalist', 'Caitlin', 'Avey', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'respectively', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'was', 'pathological', 'liar', 'con', 'artist', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Glass', 'are', 'holes', 'journalism', 'fact-checking', 'systems', 'success', 'revealed', 'willingness', 'bunch', 'nation', 'supposedly', 'bright', 'up-and-coming', 'journalists', 'believe', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'obviously', 'preposterous', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'true', 'story', 'impressive', 'script', 'wrote', 'based', 'article', 'H.', 'G.', 'Bissinger', 'quot', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'quot', 'interesting', 'look', 'integrity', 'gullibility', 'delusion', 'who', 'write', 'news', 'who', 'read', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'performance', 'one', 'best', '2003.The', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'bonus', 'features', 'what', 'excellent', 'quot', '60', 'Minutes', 'quot', 'interview', 'real', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'how', 'why', 'started', 'fabricating', 'new', 'stories', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'real', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'editor', 'who', 'discovered', 'extent', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'deception', 'one', 'best', 'audio', 'commentaries', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'Ray', 'Lane', 'are', 'articulate', 'engaging', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'meander', 'have', 'awkward', 'silences', 'Lane', 'lot', 'additional', 'information', 'Glass', 'workings', 'quot', 'New', 'Republic', 'quot', 'Ray', 'talks', 'filming', 'editing', 'story-telling', 'decisions', 'Sitting', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'listen', 'commentary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'tears', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'story', 'interests', 'highly', 'recommend', 'commentary', 'quot', '60', 'Minutes', 'quot', 'interview']",Shattered Glass

From 1995-1998, Steve managed to become a well known writer and gain respect from his peers despite his young age. Unfortunately, 27 out of the 41 articles that Steve wrote for the magazine were completely made up by him. The film takes you step by step through Steve's rise to the top, as well as his downfall.Shattered Glass is an amazing film, and easily one of the best films to come out of 2003. It is a shame that not that many people have heard of this film, and that is why I consider Shattered Glass to be an unknown gem. First of all, I love films that are based on true stories. Shattered Glass has to be one of the most accurate fact based accounts ever caught on film. The DVD features the actual &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview that was given with the real Stephen Glass. The majority of what was discussed in the interview was captured in the film. The cast is what really makes this film a treat to watch. It is a shame that Hayden Christian is being typecast as Anakin Skywalker from the Star Wars films, because hs truly is a talented actor. He was amazing in &quot;Life as a House&quot;, and he brings that same brilliance to Shattered Glass. He not only physically resembles the character, but he also captured every aspect of Glass's personality as well. The rest of the cast did a great job as well and includes Peter Sarsgaard, Chlo Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, Steve Zahn, and Hank Azaria.Overall, Shattered Glass was one of the best films I have seen in quite awhile. The film captured all of the facts effectively and offered an authentic recreation of events, and the entire cast was amazing in their roles.

So as he speaks to the class, the director eloquently cuts from that to the actualities, where Glass lives the lie.Of course this is also one of those films where we know the basic plot beforehand, but the film is set-up so that you keep wondering.  Hayden Christensen, who played Glass, does an excellent job keeping in line with the mystery, and just being Glass; whether being the kind office worker helping those out with little issues, remembering birthdays, or just the ever apologetic, youthful journalist trying to please his boss (and get by at the same time too.)""Give me the facts, give me the intrigue"", is what the movie's tagline could be because it does just that, and whether you are into journalism or not I can safely say you should see, and will enjoy this film.",4,So stories they are,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1094,"['such', 'scandals', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'other', 'notable', 'news', 'organizations', 'Glass', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'wrote', 'created', 'New', 'Republic.In', 'film', 'Glass', 'presented', 'classroom', 'introduced', 'high', 'school', 'alma', 'mater', 'graduate', 'life', 'now', 'model', 'premier', 'journalist', 'So', 'class', 'director', 'eloquently', 'actualities', 'where', 'Glass', 'lie.Of', 'course', 'also', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'know', 'basic', 'plot', 'beforehand', 'film', 'set-up', 'keep', 'wondering', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'who', 'played', 'Glass', 'excellent', 'job', 'keeping', 'line', 'mystery', 'just', 'being', 'Glass', 'being', 'kind', 'office', 'worker', 'helping', 'little', 'issues', 'remembering', 'birthdays', 'just', 'ever', 'apologetic', 'youthful', 'journalist', 'trying', 'please', 'boss', 'get', 'same', 'time', 'too', 'Give', 'facts', 'give', 'intrigue', 'what', 'movie', 'tagline', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'are', 'journalism', 'not', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'should', 'see', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",Shattered Glass

Not since All The President's Men has there been a movie that showed us the fetid stench of corruption in Washington.  Not among its government officials this time, but among the people who inform the public what they're doing.  Who's the guilty party now?Stephen Glass was a rising star at The New Republic magazine in the mid 90s.  He wrote funny and clever articles of political satire and events, was earning a six figure salary, and seemed to have it made.  One day he wrote an article about a teenage hacker who was offered a position with a company he hacked into, Jukt Microtronics, because it was cheaper for the Jukt to hire him into their payroll rather than sue him for losses.  At Forbes Magazine a few weeks later, another reporter was doing a follow up story on this zany adventure when they discovered that none of the people mentioned in the story seemed to exist.  Neither did the hacker convention, neither did the corporation, neither did anything.  Glass supplied his notes, email addresses, phone numbers, and other things that would allow for the follow up, but they were just lies to cover up the other ones.  Soon his other work fell into question.  The story about the Monica Lewinsky condoms.  The evangelical church that worshiped George Bush Sr.  It was all a lie.Hayden Christensen plays this role quite well, in the fact that he desintegrates into a crying, sniveling little worm desperate to be believed and yet knowing he's been caught.  How many others are lying to us?  Not just in the field of journalism, but all around us.  The best special feature of them all is on this disc, the 60 Minutes Interview with Glass.  He explains himself, and we meet his coworkers who had to stand by him as a corporation but watched as they exposed his lies.The message is NEVER TELL A LIE.

He makes Hayden Christianson as Stephen Glass remarkably whimpy, and cloyingly, irritating.In the storyline Glass is a likable, (to the inexperienced) and engaging writer with a sly sense of hip humor who writes charming, colorful, and interesting stories.When chided for not getting the jump on THE NEW REPUBLIC article on a computer hacker who gets a huge contract to prevent his hacking at Juct Electronics, a ""Bigtime"" software firm, reporter Adam L. Penenberg, of Forbes Online tools, an Internet periodical, digs into the story and finds, that almost nothing about the story checks-out. His investigation begins the unraveling, and dissembling of Glass and the near ruin of The New Republic.At THE NEW REPUBLIC, new and unpopular incoming editor Chuck Lane, because he replaced a popular editor, is blindsided by the growing incongruities of the story, as reluctantly, but systematically he drags himself and Glass, through mountains of fiction covering a grain of reality.Later research uncovers that 27 of 41 pieces written by Glass, were either partly or entirely fictionalized. Lane fires Glass amidst Glass's cover-up, lies, inconsistencies, and excuses, with Glass  initially supported by young and naive' staff who believe that Lane is witch-hunting.The story of the Glass fiction-for-realty, is well known, but what was missing from the news reports was the annoying, ingratiating, personality Ray displays for Glass, as well as Glass's ability to play the martyr and gather the sympathy of those with motherly instincts, who seek to protect him from what they see as an Inquistional investigation by editor Chuck Lane, who they beleive to be the opportunistic usurper of the previous editor, the late Michael Kelly, who since was killed in Iraq.As Adam L. Penenberg of Forbes Online tools, an Internet News site, dug up one anomaly after another, describing to the characters, places and entities, to his editor  as nonexistent, he quips, in all seriousness, ""There is only one thing that does check out, though."" ""What's that,"" his editor replies, ""There does appear to actually be a State called Nevada.""Systematically, Editor Chuck Lane unravels the Glass fiction; while Glass whiningly struggles to throw up roadblocks and arguments against the truth,and although the once noble Investigative News profession took a hit in this instance, but not nearly as bad a hit as they've taken since their mishandling, misreporting of political events these last five years.Watch SHATTERED GLASS and witness a great directorial and acting masterpiece, topped by an incredibly agile and swiftly paced screenplay, also by Director Billy Ray.I rate it 6 stars out a possible 5 stars.",5,A RAY MASTERPIECE,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2761,"['Billy', 'Ray', 'master', 'director', 'screen', 'writer', 'debut', 'Hayden', 'Christianson', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'remarkably', 'whimpy', 'cloyingly', 'storyline', 'Glass', 'likable', 'inexperienced', 'engaging', 'writer', 'sly', 'sense', 'hip', 'humor', 'who', 'charming', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'stories.When', 'chided', 'not', 'getting', 'jump', 'THE', 'NEW', 'REPUBLIC', 'article', 'computer', 'hacker', 'who', 'huge', 'contract', 'prevent', 'hacking', 'Juct', 'Electronics', 'Bigtime', 'software', 'firm', 'reporter', 'Adam', 'L.', 'Penenberg', 'Forbes', 'Online', 'tools', 'Internet', 'periodical', 'story', 'finds', 'almost', 'nothing', 'story', 'checks-out', 'investigation', 'unraveling', 'dissembling', 'Glass', 'near', 'ruin', 'New', 'Republic.At', 'THE', 'NEW', 'REPUBLIC', 'new', 'unpopular', 'incoming', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'replaced', 'popular', 'editor', 'blindsided', 'growing', 'incongruities', 'story', 'reluctantly', 'systematically', 'Glass', 'mountains', 'fiction', 'covering', 'grain', 'reality.Later', 'research', 'uncovers', '27', '41', 'pieces', 'written', 'Glass', 'were', 'either', 'partly', 'entirely', 'fictionalized', 'Lane', 'Glass', 'amidst', 'Glass', 'cover-up', 'inconsistencies', 'excuses', 'Glass', 'initially', 'supported', 'young', 'naive', 'staff', 'who', 'believe', 'Lane', 'witch-hunting.The', 'story', 'Glass', 'fiction-for-realty', 'well', 'known', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'news', 'reports', 'was', 'annoying', 'ingratiating', 'personality', 'Ray', 'displays', 'Glass', 'as', 'well', 'Glass', 'ability', 'play', 'martyr', 'gather', 'sympathy', 'motherly', 'instincts', 'who', 'seek', 'protect', 'what', 'see', 'Inquistional', 'investigation', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'who', 'beleive', 'be', 'opportunistic', 'usurper', 'previous', 'editor', 'late', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Iraq.As', 'Adam', 'L.', 'Penenberg', 'Forbes', 'Online', 'tools', 'Internet', 'News', 'site', 'dug', 'up', 'one', 'anomaly', 'describing', 'characters', 'places', 'entities', 'editor', 'nonexistent', 'seriousness', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'check', 'out', 'though', 'What', 'editor', 'replies', 'appear', 'actually', 'be', 'State', 'called', 'Nevada', 'Systematically', 'Editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'Glass', 'fiction', 'Glass', 'whiningly', 'throw', 'up', 'roadblocks', 'arguments', 'truth', 'once', 'noble', 'Investigative', 'News', 'profession', 'took', 'hit', 'instance', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'hit', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'mishandling', 'misreporting', 'political', 'events', 'last', 'five', 'years.Watch', 'SHATTERED', 'GLASS', 'witness', 'great', 'directorial', 'acting', 'masterpiece', 'topped', 'incredibly', 'agile', 'swiftly', 'paced', 'screenplay', 'also', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Ray.I', 'rate', '6', 'out', 'possible', '5', 'stars']",Shattered Glass

I had read a few good reviews of SHATTERED GLASS, but just didn't find the subject matter all that compelling.  But I went ahead and got it, and I'm VERY glad I did.It tells the story of young Stephen Glass, a reporter for The New Republic (and others) and details  how eventually one of his stories (and much later, lots of others) slowly unraveled to be revealed as a complete falsehood.There isn't much action in the movie...lots of talking.  But the pacing is brisk, clean and never wastes a moment. The acting is thorougly committed and the writing is superb.  We are sucked in to the story almost instantly, and it is kept nice and easy for us to follow...with relish!Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker in Parts II &amp; III) is really good as Glass.  We see how he totally ingratiates himself with everyone, so that they are willing to stand up for him.  And when he's caught in little &quot;inaccuracies,&quot; he apologizes so thoroughly and genuinely, people always cut him slack.  We never really get an idea of WHY he does it...we have to guess.  And this isn't really a vacuum for the viewer...it makes us believe that Glass is just...simply...EMPTY.Peter Sarsgard plays his editor, a nerdy, serious guy, not very popular with his staff, who slowly begins to see the scope of what's happened to his beloved magazine.  He discovers that they've been dupped, and he's willing to put himself right at the top of the list of who has been duped.

It's the best performance in a film full of great performances.Hank Azaria, Stephen Zahn (a favorite of mine), Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson are the other &quot;names&quot; involved.

The power of the film is based in how much you want to like Stephen Glass, a true people pleaser, played by Hayden Christiansen. The desperation and intensity of the performance is a wonder. In fact, the entire cast is a joy to watch from Stephen Zahn finally revealing himself as something other than a nerd to Hak Azaria being serious to Sargaard stepping forward and  out of the shadow of his sidekick character status. Even the score is outstanding, offering a unique combination of range and consistency.As a study of codependency gone over the edge, this film is incredible. Glass was so desperate for praise and to tell people what they wanted to hear, the truth was at first exaggerated, then neglected and finally forgotten.The DVD also offers commentary by the director and Chuck Lane, the TNR editor who along with  Forbes exposed Glass. The commentary allows this movie to step beyond Hollywood history to being actual history.On a final note, it's interesting that Tom Cruise is an executive producer of this film.

796559,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001907AI,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","One of the unsung and unheralded movie treasures of 2003, ""Shattered Glass"" tells the fascinating story of Stephen Glass, one of the top reporters for The New Republic in the 1990's, who rocked the media world when he had to finally confess that he had fabricated many of his stories.  ""Shattered Glass"" plays like a modern Greek tragedy, centered on a man of great talent and potential brought down by his own internal weaknesses.  Glass was only 24 when he fell from grace; prior to that, he was a hot shot reporter who, in the highly competitive world of high stakes journalism, kept looking for that little added edge to make his stories saleable.  For a number of years, Glass managed to slip those stories past his editors and fact-checkers without being discovered.  However, in the spring of 1998, his world came crashing down around him after an internet magazine became suspicious of a story he had written about a computer hacker who, it turns out, never actually existed.""Shattered Glass,"" which is based on an article by Buzz Bissinger, succeeds as both a complex character study and a top notch thriller.  The film never gives us any easy answers as to just why Glass put his journalistic integrity and career on the line by perpetrating these frauds.  As portrayed in the film, Glass is a paradoxical mixture of both arrogance and insecurity, a smooth manipulator who can charm and sweet talk his way into getting people to like and trust him while at the same time employing those same skills to get himself out of tough situations.  Eventually, however, the act runs out of steam and he is exposed for who and what he really is.  Yet, who, indeed, is he?  Is Glass simply a pathological liar?  Is he a stressed-out, overworked ""kid"" trying desperately to keep his head above water in the cutthroat world of professional journalism?  Is he merely a smooth-talking, unethical charmer who knows what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it?  Could it be that he is some or all of these things at the same time?  The fact that the film never fully answers these questions is what pulls us so deeply into the drama.  Moreover, Hayden Christensen gives a superb performance as Glass, making the character both smarmy and vulnerable, repellant and sympathetic all at the same time.  In addition to Christensen, the film is filled with brilliant, subtle performances by Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Hank Azaria and many others.Superbly written and directed by Billy Ray, ""Shattered Glass"" is one of the most suspenseful films of recent times, far more gripping than most so-called thrillers because the film is dealing with real-world issues of integrity and ethics.  We watch with morbid fascination the slow unraveling of a man's ""crime"" and character, as Glass becomes more and more ensnared in a web of his own making.  The step-by-step process by which a promising young man's true nature is uncovered, then his reputation destroyed, becomes the stuff of classic tragedy.Although The New Republic eventually recovered from this debacle, the filmmakers do not let the magazine off the hook quite so easily.  The thing we are most struck by is how incredibly young the reporters at the magazine were at the time (we are told their average age was 26!).  How such unseasoned writers came to play so prominent a part in so major and venerable a publication is indeed one of the great mysteries of the story - and one of the sharpest indictments leveled against the magazine by the makers of the film.""Shattered Glass"" is an ineffably sad film, one that makes us mourn the loss of  a promising, talented individual who sowed the seeds of his own destruction (he is currently a lawyer).  Yet it also inspires and uplifts us by reminding us that men of integrity will almost always triumph over men of little or no integrity in the long run.  That`s a truism worth remembering in this time of great moral confusion in which we find ourselves living.

796560,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0001907AI,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 9]","""Shattered Glass"" tells the of Stephen Glass (Hayden Christiansen), a hotshot writer at ""The New Republic"" (or TNR) undone by his need to entertain and for approval.  Taking literally the old saw about choosing legend over the truth when the truth isn't story enough, and prefiguring the Jayson Blair debacle at The Times, Glass fabricated numerous stories at TNR - the magazine of choice on ""Air Force One"".  Admired by his peers and supervisors, Glass rose above the office fray while writing spectacular articles on trade-fairs for political consultants, drunken partying Young Republicans and (most significantly here) a super-hacker genius with his own agent.Unfortunately for Glass, it's 1998: the internet is still hot enough to generate friction between new-media in the form of on-line magazines, and established mags like TNR.  At first sore over missing the super-hacker story, Adam Penenberg, a reporter at ""Forbes Digital"" webzine, quickly realizes how little story there is.  In Glass's fatal article, a computer company decides to hire the teenage computer genius that hacked their website - figuring they can more profitably exploit than fight him.  In a power-lunch attended by the hacker's mother and his agent (the story's inventive idea was to elevate hackers to the status of celebrity athletes or actors), the hacker negotiates a deal that will pay for his Miata and piles of porn - once he's old enough to buy either.  Also, the deal is sealed during a convention of hackers.  Glass narrates the story of the end of his career to fawning high-schoolers, describing the elaborate editing process at TNR which contains no small amount of fact-checking, but missed his fabrications entirely.  Unfortunately, he warns, the process suffers a major loop-hole: for conventional stories, editors can use established references to verify accuracy.  But Glass's stories, tapping into Clinton-era Zeitgiest, were by definition unconventional, leaving Glass the sole judge of his own accuracy.  Penenberg (Steve Zahn, taking a break from his usual loveable knucklehead-persona) cuts through the geist, finding nothing - no computer company listed under that name in any state, no hacker convention, and no super-agent for super-hackers.  (The existence of Nevada, he glibly notes, checks out.)  A marathon conference call between Forbes and TNR only further erodes Glass's story.  Chuck Lane, Glass's editor, at first accepts his story, then slowly realizes otherwise.  With Glass in tow, Lane follows up on the story and sees the holes (among them - the building in which a conference was held in one of Glass's stories, turns out to have been closed on that day).  At every downturn, Glass aches for approval - ""are you mad at me?"" he asks.  His notes are bogus - phone numbers have the wrong area codes and lead to suspicious voicemails (Penenberg's confirms his suspicions by placing two calls to the same number at Glass's million dollar company, and getting a busy signal rather than voicemail); the hacker-agent's business card and the computer company's website are obviously bogus (in a pointed commentary, the website seems legit to TNR staff, but is instantly spotted by Forbes reporters as fake).  Lane doesn't want to can Glass, but the pressures in Glass's favor - mostly his popularity with TNR's other young reporters - force him to confront the veracity (or lack thereof) of his other articles.""Glass"" is one of those movies actually split.  It's strongest in the first half - exploring how young reporters see the degradation of the media in the burgeoning internet-age.  (Pretty soon, they muse, ""People"" and ""Time"" will be indistinguishable.)  The workplace politics of TNR are also interesting, but glanced over.  Lane takes over when TNR fires their popular editor Michael Kelly; played by Hank Azaria, Kelly will lose his life 5 years later in Iraq, but in '98, put his job on the line for his writers.  Knowing the staff's adoration of Kelly, Lane keeps his reins loose, until the Forbes article makes that impossible.  Unfortunately, the tightening also hurts the story, focusing on Glass and those wringing the truth out of his articles.  The movie skirts over the dynamic of the other writers who are supportive of him - even as he was the ideal they were measured up against, and mercilessly edits the stories they send to him.  His sincerest defender at TNR is played by Chloe Sevigny, but she has little respect for the admiration that Glass attracts, has little patience for the other writers' attempts to emulate him and just seems too serious to fall into the same trap that everybody else has.  The script sidesteps the sea-change that brought TNR's staff to Lane's side - presumably against Glass.  Glass himself, according to the script is pathological - his dependence on approval underlined by the fawning he receives from those high-schoolers (the ending seems to confirm that these admiring students were part of his delusion).  In its need to be as pat as any Hollywood product, the film comes to a perfunctory happy ending - with Lane finally winning the approval sought by Glass.  It's a scene so redolent in its need for our applause, you'd almost believe that Glass wrote it.",3,The end of Journalism?,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,5231,"['Shattered', 'Glass', 'Stephen', 'Glass',

796561,A387BD735MI50R,B0001907AI,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","This is an absorbing account of how a failure of journalistic ethics at ""The New Republic"" magazine was uncovered. It is like a serious version of ""The Office,"" with a number of people eventually reaching beyond their individual workspace cubicles to collaborate on finding out whether the fascinating stories that Stephen Glass submitted to the magazine were fact or merely fictions he invented to advance his career as a writer.There is a lot of suspense in this movie. Like me, you may find yourself holding your breath, waiting to see if a given website that Glass cites as a reference to substantiate the factuality of his story - actually exists. And in those tense moments, you are not sure what you are hoping, where your sympathies should lie. The times you cheated on school exams or failed to report something on your income tax form may flash through your mind.So the film centers on detective work, but not the kind of detective work that Sherlock Holmes would readily recognize. It involves tracking elusive sources through cyberspace, through re-routed and hand-off websites, through drop-box email addresses.The presumption is that if Glass' stories are fictitious, he has committed the ultimate journalistic transgression. The viewer is left with no alternative but to agree with that strict standard. But the movie might have left just the least little bit of wiggle-space for an advocate of leniency. After all, """"The New Republic"" is a magazine of feature stories written from a definite personal point of view.

Truth is, other than ""All the President's Men,"" we hardly ever witness how a reporter's story is written and ultimately hits the printed page. ""Shattered Glass"" is an exception. It is a nearly flawless film about the self-destruction of the real-life, fast-rising media star, Stephen Glass, former reporter and associate editor for The New Republic magazine. Eager to make his mark as well as his fortune, Glass, portrayed very convincingly against-type by Hayden Christiansen, cannot resist the temptation of substituting fiction for fact to make his contributions more attractive, not to mention publishable and famous. Not only do we see how Glass's imagination, purpoted to be the truth, appeals to his editors, but how easily his ingratiating personality seduces and manipulates the entire TNR staff.  He is be-friended, admired and envied by his co-workers who seek to emulate his approach and style. His skyrocketing trajectory, however, comes crashing down when a fact-checking writer for the online magazine Forbes Digital Tool begins to question more than a few of the items in one of his stories, ""Hack Heaven,"" which appeared in a May 1998 issue of TNR.  Alerted to some of the inconsistencies in Glass's story, unpopular TNR editor Charles Lane, played superbly by Peter Sarsgaard, begins to do some fact checking of his own, methodically unravelling the layers of deception and duplicity until he finally discovers that Glass is merely a pathetic charlatan.  In what could have been a dry expose of the inner workings of a highly-regarded, current events and policy publication, Billy Ray, in his directorial debut, presents us with a version of the story as tense and intriguing as any mystery.  Its ethical message is disturbing, but as drama, it is simply riveting. To emphasize the poignancy if not the significance of Glass's transgression, Ray also effectively employs the device of juxtaposing the scenes in which Glass is lecturing to a high school class on the fundamentals of reporting against those in which he is composing his stories, that is, fabricating events- which we first see as actually occurring.  Anyone who has ever known or crossed paths with the people who exist in this world cannot help but be impressed with the authenticity we find here. Yet, it is a delight even for the uninitiated.

This film tells the story of how a comparatively new online magazine uncovers and exposes one of Glass's lies, bringing the entire `glass house' down around him.The way that Glass piled lie after lie on top of each other is enough to make you cringe, and Hayden Christensen plays Stephen Glass with a liar's panache, innocently spewing out one untruth after the other until the weight of his fabrications is monumental.  Glass's new editor, Chuck Lane, becomes suspicious when confronted with unanswerable questions posed by Forbes Online Magazine, and must face the truth that he, too, has been duped.After watching the movie, I highly recommend watching the Commentary in the special features, something that I do not normally do.  In doing so, you will find out just how close the movie, Shattered Glass, sticks to the real facts of the story.  Very little had to be invented to make the story film-worthy, the story being so flamboyant in and of itself.One of the more interesting facts about the commentary is that they got the real Chuck Lane to pitch in, expertly combining the factual source with the creative forces for an interesting piece.  Also noteworthy is the 60 Minutes interview with the real Stephen Glass, where you will get a chance to see the manipulator working his pleas on you and the public at large.Not an action movie, or even fast paced, Shattered Glass still manages to entertain with the absurdity that this pathological liar was able to weave such a complex web in a world of investigative journalism.  Special mention goes to Peter Sarsgaard who plays Chuck Lane with a quiet finesse, Hank Azaria plays editor Michael Kelly with a dignified demeanor, and Hayden Christensen puts his whining voice to superb usage as Stephen Glass.

796572,AB4WQ9HGVCCD,B0001907AI,"Tony Rome ""mine is fine as wine and I should ...","[1, 1]","In 1998 Stephen Glass was the Tom Cruise of print journalism-he was the youngest Associate Editor in the history of the New Republic and he wrote successful free lance pieces for magazines like George and Rolling Stone...The party ended in the spring of '98 when the New Republic published Glass' 'Hack Heaven,"" which detailed how a 15 year old computer hacker, Ian Restel, blackmailed a major Software company,Jukt Micronics, into giving him a security job--all of this supposedly went down at a hacker's 'convention' where Restel, aided and abetted by a high powered sports agent, Joe Hiert, also wrangled himself from Jukt executives enough money to buy a Miata, the first issue of X-Men comics, and lifetime suscriptions to both Playboy and Penthouse.Adam Penenberg, a hip young reporter for Forbes Digital On Line, delved into Glass' article and soon found that ""Hack Heaven' was a total fabrciation, made up of whole cloth from Glass' imagination---Ian Restil did not exist, there was no hacker's convention, nor was there ever a sofware company called Jukt Microronics....The pins quckly fell as it was discovered that the vast majority of Glass' previous New Republic pieces were also fabrications (as was his George article on Vernon Jordan, in which Jordan was portayed as a lecher with a penchant for teenage girls).The movie ""Shattered Glass"" written and directed by young Billy Ray (Ray's screenplay is based on a Vanity Fair article by H.G.Bissinger) is a triumph of independent filmmaking.Ray's obvious passion not only for the material, but for the canvas of print journalism,  is evident in every frame and he getstruly impressive performances from his cast; especially the fine Peter Sarsgaard, whose terrific, self effacing portrayal of TNR editor Chuck Lane gives the film its ground--there are also excellent performances by Hank Azaria as Michael Kelly (Jones'predecessor as TNR, who was killed in Iraq in 2003) and Steve Zahn as Penenberg.Hayden Christensen as Glass does some amazing things, but since the script gives us no motivation for Glass' behavior or actions,there are moments when Christensen's Glass comes across as no more than semi-slimy and annoying--each time he asks an editor or co-worker""are you mad at me?"", you want to punch him.There's also a brief segment in the film when Glass reveals to a co worker that he's often suspected as being gay--but the subject is not expanded on or addressed again in the film so you wonder why it was included at all.Upon retrospect, you wonder why no one else initially questioned the validity of 'Hack Heaven' even as they were reading it.....since when do computer hackers, who can only surivive by living in the shadows,hold conventions at major hotels?--what would be next-- a convention of bank robbers or pedaphiles?The DVD contains a commentary by Ray and Chuck Lane and a 60 minute interview with the real Stephen Glass  conducted by Steve Croft.Note--Glass went on to graduate from law school and in 2003 published a novel ""The Fabulist' about a reporter with a penchant for inventing stories.",4,'Glass' Houses,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,3080,"['1998', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'was', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'print', 'journalism-he', 'was', 'youngest', 'Associate', 'Editor', 'history', 'New', 'Republic', 'wrote', 'successful', 'free', 'lance', 'pieces', 'magazines', 'George', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'party', 'ended', 'spring', ""'98"", 'when', 'New', 'Republic', 'published', 'Glass', 'Heaven', 'detailed', 'how', '15', 'year', 'old', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Ian', 'Restel', 'blackmailed', 'major', 'Software', 'company', 'Jukt', 'Micronics', 'giving', 'security', 'job', 'supposedly', 'went', 'down', 'hacker', ""'convention"", 'where', 'Restel', 'aided', 'abetted', 'high', 'powered', 'sports', 'agent', 'Joe', 'Hiert', 'also', 'wrangled', 'Jukt', 'executives', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'Miata', 'first', 'issue', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'lifetime', 'suscriptions', 'Playboy', 'Penthouse.Adam', 'Penenberg', 'hip', 'young', 'reporter', 'Forbes', 'Digital', 'Line', 'delved', 'Glass', 'article', 'soon', 'found', 'Hack', 'Heaven', 'was', 'total', 'fabrciation', 'made', 'whole', 'cloth', 'Glass', 'imagination', 'Restil', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'was', 'hacker', 'convention', 'was', 'there', 'ever', 'sofware', 'company', 'called', 'Jukt', 'Microronics', '.The', 'pins', 'quckly', 'fell', 'was', 'discovered', 'vast', 'majority', 'Glass', 'previous', 'New', 'Republic', 'pieces', 'were', 'also', 'fabrications', 'was', 'George', 'article', 'Vernon', 'Jordan', 'Jordan', 'was', 'portayed', 'lecher', 'penchant', 'teenage', 'girls', '.The', 'movie', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'written', 'directed', 'young', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'article', 'H.G.Bissinger', 'triumph', 'independent', 'filmmaking.Ray', 'obvious', 'passion', 'not', 'only', 'material', 'canvas', 'print', 'journalism', 'evident', 'frame', 'getstruly', 'impressive', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'fine', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'terrific', 'effacing', 'portrayal', 'TNR', 'editor', 'Chuck', 'Lane', 'film', 'ground', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Michael', 'Kelly', ""Jones'predecessor"", 'TNR', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Iraq', '2003', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Penenberg.Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Glass', 'amazing', 'things', 'script', 'motivation', 'Glass', 'behavior', 'actions', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Christensen', 'Glass', 'more', 'semi-slimy', 'annoying', 'time', 'editor', 'co-worker', 'are', 'mad', 'want', 'punch', 'also', 'brief', 'segment', 'film', 'when', 'Glass', 'co', 'worker', 'often', 'suspected', 'being', 'gay', 'subject', 'not', 'expanded', 'addressed', 'again', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'included', 'all.Upon', 'retrospect', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'else', 'initially', 'questioned', 'validity', ""'Hack"", 'Heaven', 'even', 'were', 'reading', '..since', 'when', 'do', 'computer', 'hackers', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'surivive', 'living', 'shadows', 'hold', 'conventions', 'major', 'hotels', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'convention', 'bank', 'robbers', 'pedaphiles', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Ray', 'Chuck', 'Lane', '60', 'minute', 'interview', 'real', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'conducted', 'Steve', 'Croft.Note', 'Glass', 'went', 'graduate', 'law', 'school', '2003', 'published', 'novel', 'Fabulist', 'reporter', 'penchant', 'inventing', 'stories']",Shattered Glass
796573,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001907AI,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","You may not find it shocking when the ace writer for The New Republic, one of the country's prestigious magazines, was actually writing a series of falsehoods, and none of them was detected by the editor, or fact checkers, of the company.  Similar cases have been reported before that.  So far, 'Shattered Glass' is offering nothing new.But the film deals with the case in such an intelligent way that you will be drawn to the hectic world of jounalism depicted here.  Hayden Christensen ('Episode II') plays the real-life writer Stephen Glass, whose very interesting reports (all 27 in number) on The New Republic magazine turned out fabricated -- all or partially.The film is not about why or how he did it.  It is about how one editor Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) finds the truths behind the writings, after the writer of Forbes online Magazine Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn) realizes one strange thing about Stephen Glass's amusing (and amazing) story about one computer wizard kid.The actors are perfect; besides Christensen, Sarsgaard, and Zahn (who is in a serious mode), the film features Hank Azaria, Rosario Dawson, Melanie Linsky, and Chloe Sevigny.  Though Christensen is at his best, Sarsgaad and Sevigny are real standout, as one who suspects Glass's fabrications, and one who tries to protect (only psychologically) from him.Shot in a pretty orthodox method, 'Shattered Glass' not only uncovers the scandal but shows how certain people are misunderstood for what they are not, and reveals quite convincingly how people would act under the extreme mental pressure.  The film is not a preachy tract on the media; it is more like a study on humans, and is a great success.

796574,A9OVXY24IY777,B0001907AI,"""velurion""","[6, 8]","I remember thinking (back in 1998 when the New Republic scandal was making headlines) how strange and intriguing the story was. Promising young writer Stephen Glass of a reputable current events and policy magazine - and apparently the then in-flight magazine of the president's Air Force One - is exposed for making up facts, events, and people in his articles. This excellent film re-tells that story. It's important to pay attention in the beginning, as the pacing is a bit slow (albeit deliberately), but it's to show us the characters' motivations and the interpersonal dynamics of the staff and work environment at the New Republic office. Once the story gets going, it really becomes an engrossing drama.Hayden Christensen plays Stephen Glass, and he's actually quite good in this role. I had only seen him as Anakin in the Star Wars films, but he shows more depth here, though, I'm still not convinced that he's as versatile an actor as others his age. Hank Azaria - veteran 'voice' in The Simpsons TV series - is absolutely believable in his smallish role as Michael Kelly, the senior editor. Peter Sarsgaard (who I liked and feared in Boys Don't Cry) plays Chuck Lane, who takes over for the departing Michael Kelly as Glass's boss and is ultimately the hero of this story. Sarsgaard, alone, is worth the ticket price (or DVD rental/purchase). Chlo Sevigny also stars and Rosario Dawson and Steve Zahn have small parts as well.So you can see by the featured actors that a lot of young talent is at hand. I was well impressed with this film. There is no gun-play, no action, no sex, and no F-words, so it's probably going to bore unenlightened viewers. But for those of us who like human drama, it's pretty special.As for the bonus features, there is an excerpt of a 60 Minutes Special on Glass, which is really amusing as we get to meet the real Stephen Glass. By the end of the featurette, one certainly does get a sense for what a weasel Glass was (and probably still is).There is also a feature-length commentary with director Billy Ray and the real Chuck Lane. This is one of the best parts of the DVD actually, because Lane is such a knowledgeable, likeable and modest guy, it's really a gift to hear his insight into the real-life events that took place. In contrast, Billy Ray annoys with his superfluous praising of his cast and crew; he practically confesses his incompetence as a first-time director. I don't doubt Billy Ray's intelligence and abilities, because the movie is excellent and it's clear that he really wanted to do the drama and the facts justice (and succeeded!); but it felt like he was using the commentary track as his own personal soapbox to thank everyone for being so ""extraordinary"" and ""fantastic"".All in all, I was extremely pleased with my purchase. I don't watch all my DVDs over and over, but you'll want to watch this one at least a second time for the engaging commentary with the director and Chuck Lane.
