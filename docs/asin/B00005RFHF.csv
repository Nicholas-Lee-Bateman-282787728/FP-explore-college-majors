679163,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005RFHF,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I was at first disgusted with director Sun-Woo Jang because I had felt that he cheated me.  Jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element.  I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best ... yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it.  What stayed with me wasn't the story, it wasn't the characters, nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film, but the transition that Jang demonstrated between Y and J.  If you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step.  As they continue to meet, exploring new avenues of pleasure, they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed.  Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y.  It is a very small change, and due to the graphic content of this film, it can easily be missed, but it is there.  It becomes apparently clear near the end when J cannot live with Y, as their meetings become less frequent, and J attempts to become a part of normal society.  This was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.I will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there.  It is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers.  What happens behind closed doors is never known ... or so we should believe.  While the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director Jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery.  Our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh.  This is fun at first, but again, Jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting.  This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film.  Jang had a great story with Gojitmal, but where he failed (outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side) was that he took scenes, repeated them time and again, without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters.  Where was Jang going with this movie?  Did he want the sex to tell the stories, or did he believe the characters would?  He failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about Y and J that we could care less how they resolve themselves.  The ending seems almost random at best as Jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two, absolute unknowns, of this film.  I have to give Jang some credit for trying, but not much.  He attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking, but they just couldn't congeal well together.  Y's brother and J's wife were those plot points, but again, due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element, these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull.  Maybe it was just how I viewed this film, but outside of the sexual scenes, nothing else worked together.  We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.Finally, I would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us, the viewers, closer to the emotions being felt by J and Y.  From what I can remember, and I am trying to push this film far from my mind, I don't remember any musical undertones.  Gojitmal may have been a stronger film if Jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings.  While I understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself, there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more.  Technically, this was a poor film.  Obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature.  I didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above, I just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough.  This was no Larry Clark production; this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release!Overall, I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy, but I felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them.  The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived.  Our characters were uneventful, our story was underdeveloped, and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between Y and J into something more symbolic than sex.  To me, Jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic ... and it failed miserably.  This was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.Grade: ** out of *****",2,*Whip/Crack* went this frumpy tale...,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,5529,"['was', 'first', 'disgusted',

Y later retaliated by asking her friends to pass message around top reach his brother's ears which made him confused that he got into a bike accident(which killed him). Y learnt of his brother's death and went back to the family where she later met J the last time in Paris before she flew off to Brazil to meet her kins there.

The only positive thing about this morals society/ community watchdog group/ lobby group/ national menace is the free publicity they give movies- never mind they seldom bother to WATCH the movies that wind them up. David Lane had to watch BAISE MOI twice for it to fully sink in- which remains the only movie I've seen they've &quot;publicized&quot; where their complaints actually lived up to all the controversy hype. Proof that he's isn't half as clever as he thinks he is.In actuality, LIES is a movie that will offend only the most wet-behind-the-ears conservatives, &amp; could be described as 9 1/2 WEEKS meets THE GRADUATE.Based on Jang Jung Il's novel &quot;Tell Me A Lie&quot;, LIES tells of a torrid S&amp;M based relationship between J (Lee Sang Hyun), a 38 year old sculptor whose wife is in Paris on business &amp; Y (Kim Tae Yeon), a 17 year old student whose main goal is to lose her virginity before she graduates. We later learn that this is an emotional response to the suicide of her sister, a victim of brutal sexual abuse- Y would prefer to lose her virginity at a young age to a stranger than to lose it later through potential rape. Heavy stuff.On a (slightly) lighter note, LIES features shots of the actors talking direct to the camera during the sex scenes &amp; ECU's of nipple chomping, as well as lots of full frontal nudity. This softcore art outing soon takes a different turn when J &amp; Y introduce BDSM practices into their relationship... and this of course marks the beginning of the end. It's probably safe to presume the movie's foley artist had a great time.LIES is similar to the later British movie INTIMACY (which almost put me to sleep) except it's a bit more interesting.Continuing the lighter contrast, the film is split into chapter segments which are titled to make the whole affair seem like a round of golf (this will make sense when you watch the movie).The dialogue is often hilarious- in one scene the narrator says &quot;J whips her 35 times to match her hip size&quot;. And more I can't write here so it will be a nice surprise when you see it for yourself.Another interesting angle is that director Jang Sun-Woo has incorporated behind the scenes material into the actual film with the actors explaining why they chose to take on such controversial roles. Unfortuately, good intentions aside; this ploy comes off as simply intrusive &amp; ruins the overall impact of the movie. It's still worth a look for all the (unnecessary) controversy it stirred up. I was a bit disappointed in that sense. LIES is far from being a masterpiece but its still worth watching for curiosity's sake.",3,Not as shocking as you've been led to believe,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,2773,"['Korean', 'film', 'was', 'focus', 'SPCS', 'moaning', 'unfounded', 'usual', 'so', 'naturally', 'immediately', 'went', 'list', 'must-see', 'movies', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'morals', 'society/', 'community', 'watchdog', 'group/', 'lobby', 'group/', 'national', 'menace', 'free', 'publicity', 'give', 'movies-', 'never', 'seldom', 'bother', 'WATCH', 'movies', 'wind', 'up', 'David', 'Lane', 'had', 'watch', 'BAISE', 'MOI', 'twice', 'fully', 'sink', 'in-', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'quot', 'publicized', 'quot', 'where', 'complaints', 'actually', 'lived', 'up', 'controversy', 'hype', 'Proof', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'clever', 'is.In', 'actuality', 'LIES', 'movie', 'will', 'offend', 'only', 'most', 'wet-behind-the-ears', 'conservatives', 'amp', 'could', 'be', 'described', '9', '1/2', 'WEEKS', 'THE', 'GRADUATE.Based', 'Jang', 'Jung', 'Il', 'novel', 'quot', 'Tell', 'Me', 'A', 'Lie', 'quot', 'LIES', 'torrid', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'based', 'relationship', 'J', 'Lee', 'Sang', 'Hyun', '38', 'year', 'old', 'sculptor', 'wife', 'Paris', 'business', 'amp', 'Y', 'Kim', 'Tae', 'Yeon', '17', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'main', 'goal', 'lose', 'virginity', 'later', 'learn', 'emotional', 'response', 'suicide', 'sister', 'victim', 'brutal', 'sexual', 'abuse-', 'Y', 'would', 'prefer', 'lose', 'virginity', 'young', 'age', 'stranger', 'lose', 'later', 'potential', 'rape', 'Heavy', 'stuff.On', 'slightly', 'lighter', 'note', 'LIES', 'shots', 'actors', 'talking', 'direct', 'camera', 'sex', 'scenes', 'amp', 'ECU', 'nipple', 'chomping', 'as', 'well', 'lots', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'softcore', 'art', 'outing', 'soon', 'different', 'turn', 'when', 'J', 'amp', 'Y', 'introduce', 'BDSM', 'practices', 'relationship', 'course', 'marks', 'beginning', 'end', 'probably', 'safe', 'presume', 'movie', 'foley', 'artist', 'had', 'great', 'time.LIES', 'similar', 'later', 'British', 'movie', 'INTIMACY', 'almost', 'put', 'sleep', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting.Continuing', 'lighter', 'contrast', 'film', 'split', 'chapter', 'segments', 'are', 'titled', 'make', 'whole', 'affair', 'seem', 'round', 'golf', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', '.The', 'dialogue', 'often', 'hilarious-', 'one', 'scene', 'narrator', 'quot', 'J', '35', 'times', 'match', 'hip', 'size', 'quot', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'surprise', 'when', 'see', 'yourself.Another', 'interesting', 'angle', 'director', 'Jang', 'Sun-Woo', 'incorporated', 'scenes', 'material', 'actual', 'film', 'actors', 'explaining', 'why', 'chose', 'take', 'such', 'controversial', 'roles', 'Unfortuately', 'good', 'intentions', 'aside', 'ploy', 'off', 'simply', 'intrusive', 'amp', 'overall', 'impact', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'unnecessary', 'controversy', 'stirred', 'up', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'sense', 'LIES', 'far', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'curiosity', 'sake']",Lies

There is not much plot to go along with the S&M; Light scenes in the film but it was never intended to really have one.  This film was more of a rebellion against the Korean film industry which tends to censor films not meeting the government's moral or political dogma.  I believe the film maker based his movie around the subject of S&M; simply because the Korean Film Industry said he could not.Many of its scenes (if not all) were filmed on one take ala El Mariachi. The film was actually banned in Korea for a short period of time.  This film should be celebrated and supported for it's originality, spirit and stand against censorship rather than dismissed because of it's risqu&eacute; subject matter.

The movie does start out in that direction, but soon spirals out of control into whipping and beating. (Not to mention the low point of the film: A scat kiss.) The character J at first seems to be a sadist, as he begins whipping Y prior to having sex with her. Later in the film the whip is turned on him and his true colors begin to emerge. As this relationship progresses it seems more and more like J is just taking advantage of Y's desperate circumstances to satisfy his own obsession with the whip.
