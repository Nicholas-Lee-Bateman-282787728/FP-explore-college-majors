It has a good story with a nice array of characters to fill the world of Conan and for those who thirst for blood there is plenty of it splashing the screen. All the actors do a great job in their roles, the special effects are just right not to over the top and the enviornments fit the feel of the movie perfectly.

1400598,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B004EPYZT4,Adam B. Krenn,"[24, 29]","Yeah, and the producers/writers/director/whomever clearly do not understand the character or stories of Conan hence they do not wield it effectively. As a Sword & Sorcery film it was okay, at best. As a Conan story it was terrible. As with the Milius version we get yet another sentimental version of the character. Conan was many things in his fictional career, indeed he has been a thief, pirate, military and mercenary Captain, even a desert chieftain and finally King. But sentimental? Nope, sorry. Given my experience of reading the character I feel Conan would view sentimentality as a weakness.I knew something was wrong during the narrative intro by an oddly misplaced Morgan Freeman voiceover (the first time I didn't like him in something). The voice over started off correctly but then deviated wildly from the history of Hyborea. Conan is made to stand out as something special, unique and somehow important. This time he is gifted with near superhuman skills and abilities which takes away from the excitement as you never feel like Conan is ever in danger of actually losing (even though you know he won't) let alone getting injured or suffering. The written character of Conan was not unique, different or special. He actually was an outsider and his father and exile. At fifteen he (for the most part) ran away and eventually sought his fortunes farther south. Conan, at its heart is an everyman tale (if an arrogant everyman). He is not heroic, although his actions could surely often be interpreted as such but more often than not was seeking to better his lot while furthering his ambitions. Mostly he was just a man that kept growing, surviving and gaining skill all though his life until he achieved his goals in Aquilonia and even then had some more adventures. This, to me anyway, makes for a much more identifiable and interesting character.A note on comparisons versus the 1982 Milius version: Neither of the films are very good Conan films but Milius' worked so much better as a Sword & Sorcery film for various reasons. One being that Conan in that film actually suffered more than once and was in no way superhuman. This one seemed to lack a sense of continuity and I felt like I was simply being dragged from one set piece to the next with little time to reflect on anything. Heck, even the sex scene seemed like a set piece.A note regarding Jason Momoa: I do think he COULD make a good Conan but I do not think he made a very good one here. Not sure if this was his or the director's fault but running through a film constantly looking angry really makes for a bland hero. Even Arnie got to show a wide range of facial emotions in the Milius version. It may seem like a small detail but it does go a long way to humanizing the character.Cast notes: Stephen Lang was good as a bad guy. Much more complete a character than Avatar (where he played a pretty one dimensional soldier) and overlooked by Hollywood for too long.Ron Perlman: Please, I would watch Ron Perlman sitting alone in a room for two hours. He makes EVERYTHING he is in, better.Rose McGowan, initially, I didn't like her in this, she was weird, creepy and disturbing. But then I realized that is EXACTLY the kind of bad guy witch woman I would want in a Sword & Sorcery flick. I have changed my stance on her and liked her in this film.Rachel Nichols: Not really needed here. Not that I disliked her, just didn't care for her character and she seemed little more than the ""love interest contrivance"" for the script. Still, with that bit of a part, I admit she did exude charisma.A few more notes: The filmmakers apparently pulled from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Yet, the story is VERY similar both in plot and theme to the 1982 one. What the what? Comics and images? There seems to be this major disconnect between what a comic is and how it is interpreted by Hollywood in general. A comic does NOT show the moments in-between, this is something our brains do and it is called closure. Movies rarely have that luxury as they are moving pictures and the in-between (at least within those moments) is laid out for us. Hollywood, in general, clearly does NOT understand what a comic book is. Also, many of the SSoC were based off of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter stories. What about the guy that created Conan? Remember him? Robert E. Howard. Does his original work have so little merit or influence despite being the actual creator!?! I would argue that the original literary work from Howard (or DeCamp or Carter for that matter) had much influence at all.Final note: Ultimately I was bored watching this film. So much so I had trouble even watching the third act, compounded by the fact that it was the worst of the three. (Stephen Lang did make a great villain though) What did that mask actually do for Khalar Zym anyway? It sure didn't help him fight any better or survive.Ultimately a let down and Conan the Destroyer (for ALL of it's faults) still remains the closest to an actual Conan film (if seemingly based on a later Carpenter or Jordan novel) despite its campy tone.",1,...to wield it you must first understand it.,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,5169,"['Yeah', 'producers/writers/director/whomever', 'clearly',

1400600,A32O98PFC3OP7K,B004EPYZT4,A Gamer at Heart,"[3, 4]","Not every movie needs to be re-made.  Or stolen from.  The original ""Arnooold"" Conan tells a superior tale of woe and warrior than the update.  I really like Jason Momoa from Game of Thrones, love Stephen Taylor from Avatar and Terra Nova, and Ron Jeremy from Sons of Anarchy.  But, the story in this movie is just flat and boring.  And a rip-off.  Here's what you learn in the first 30 seconds. (mild spoiler alert, but this is right in the beginning) There was an ancient, magical face mask made from pieces of bone.  When all the bone pieces are together, the mask wearer can rule other kings.  The original evil mask owner was vanquished long ago in an epic battle, and the mask's bone pieces were separated and spread about the land.  But, a new evil ruler-to-be wants to reassemble the mask, and needs all the pieces so he can - wait for it - rule all the other kings.  Sound familiar?  All this movie needs is Frodo and a ring and the rip-off would be complete.  I found myself drifting off.  The update changes up the story from the original obviously, and starts off promising a decent updating of a classic movie despite the been-there, done-that plot, but then it just drifts off into the same generic revenge movie you have seen a million times.  The swordfights are so frequent, uninspiring, and by the numbers, that you will find yourself wondering why you can't hear the music that all these choreographed fighters/dancers are dancing to. We never cared about any of the characters because they are so one-dimensional that you know what they are going to say and do before they do it on screen.Love the actors (I hope Jason becomes a movie star - his role on Game of Thrones as Khal Drogo was truly epic) but his talents are just wasted here.

Howard's Conan the Barbarian, and most will remember that he was famously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. How, then, would a remake fare, with a new story and a new Conan? Not very well, actually. This time around, Jason Momoa plays the titular warrior, who is born in the heat of battle and trained as a warrior until his entire family is slaughtered by an evil warlord named Khalar Zym in search of pieces to a mystical mask. Conan escapes the onslaught and lives on as a pirate until a chance meeting provides him with a new lead to seek vengeance for his clan's extermination. Co-starring Rose Mcgowan, Rachel Nichols, and Ron Perlman in small role as Conan's father, Conan the Barbarian failed to impress.

1400609,A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK,B004EPYZT4,amster,"[14, 23]","Conan the Barbarian as a film is about as subtle as getting shot in the privates with a paint ball gun. It's near impossible to judge this as a ""good"" film in the traditional sense. I have no doubt that many people are going to hate it, including some, if not many, Robert E. Howard fans. But as a film in the grindhouse tradition, it's a friggin' masterpiece. I grew up on Robert E. Howard, but it's certainly not all that I grew up with. Somewhere along the way, I developed a taste for shocking exploitation cinema as well, and I attribute this love, at least in some part, to my love of Howard. I love The Evil Dead Trilogy, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Stuart Gordon Lovecraft films, The Pinky Violence Collection, and The Sword and the Sorcerer, just to name a few. Having just learned about its existence, I really want to see ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"". ""But why??? Why would you possibly want to see a film like that?"" Well, to quote Randall from Clerks 2, ""Because its f'd up, that's why!"" Having said that, I feel like I've just witnessed one of the greatest exploitation films of all time, and I'll be shocked if this doesn't become something of a cult classic among those of us who ""get it"". As far as ""getting it"" is concerned, either you do or you don't, and if I have to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, but I would ask the question, ""What is grindhouse cinema if not the cinematic equivalent of pulp fiction?"" ""Well yeah"", some might say, ""Robert E. Howard wrote for the pulps, but his writings transcend the limitations and the bad clich&eacute;s that exemplify the vast majority of the pulp medium"". And I agree, but when talking about exploitation cinema, so does the Evil Dead Trilogy and Reanimator, and in my opinion, so does this film.  Robert E. Howard's fiction is full of deep philosophical subtext, but we're kidding ourselves if we think that the baser, more exploitation oriented material isn't in there as well. Just ask Margaret Brundage. Going back to my earliest days as a fan, I still remember hiding my Savage Sword of Conan magazines from my parents, because I knew that those Frazetta inspired covers with the perfectly proportioned females, their breasts fully exposed save for silver dollar sized brass pasties, would likely throw my Mom into a tirade. But even the comics did little to prepare me for the real thing, that is, Robert E. Howard's prose. When I first started reading the Lancers, I was shocked at how brutal and graphic it was.But I digress. About the film: outside of the horror genre, I can't recall a film in recent memory that's so in your face, so completely unabashed and unapologetic, so ""I really don't give a **** what you think"" in forwarding its ideological agenda. And yes, there is an underlying philosophy here, though you might miss it amiss the chaos and mayhem. In terms of sheer audacity, the only recent non-horror film that even remotely comes to mind is ""The Passion of the Christ"". As far the Sword and Sorcery genre of film is concerned, I can't think of a single film to compare it to. Conan the Barbarian is the first of its kind.""But Rotten Tomatoes gives it a rating of 27%. How can all of these people possibly be wrong?"" Good question! Let me try my best to explain. While waiting for the film to start, I was subjected to what they like to call the ""pre-show entertainment"", and let me tell you, if every sinner is subjected to their own personal Hell after death, then this would be pretty close to mine. I felt like I had to endure wave upon wave of the most insipid crap one could imagine. A painfully unfunny sitcom where a wife seeks to spice up her and her husband's love life by dressing up as a sexy nurse and making him fill out patient information forms. Taylor Lautner, with his adorable little pug nose, trying to pass himself off as an action hero as he mutters ""Not if I find you first!"" in his little girly man voice. This is what passes for entertainment these days? Apparently, yes, or they wouldn't continue making it. ""Oooo! That looks good"". Uh...yeah. I have a strong suspicion that there's a significant overlap between the kind of people who consider this stuff to be quality entertainment and those who post comments such as ""Oh God! Not another remake!"" and ""Looks like Prince of Persia meets Clash of the Titans to me"" on film forums. A long time ago, before this film was made, I referred to them as the ignorant masses, and I think my characterization was spot on. In my own twisted and demented view of the world, these are people virtually devoid of anything that even remotely passes for an imagination, or the capacity for independent thought. ""Roger Ebert gives it a bad review, so that settles it"". That's not a joke, by the way. People are actually saying it. Robert E. Howard had another word for them: civilized, and this is not a film that was made for civilized people.Ridley Scott's ""The Hour of the Dragon"", which redefined and reinvigorated the Sword and Sorcery genre of film while racking up several Oscar nominations, and for the first time in 80 years put Robert E. Howard's fiction on the best seller list, is a film that I'd love to see. And in some parallel universe I'm sure Howard fans are raving about it. But in this universe, that's not the film we got. I love Gladiator. I love Kingdom of Heaven. I love Braveheart; not to mention Alexander Nevsky and The Seven Samurai. I certainly have no problem with Oscar worthy historical epics, and I know them when I see them. But Ridley Scott is, after all, a civilized filmmaker. Even at his R rated best, there's a line that the conventions of a polite society dictates that he won't cross. Or at least he hasn't crossed it yet. Marcus Nispel completely ignores such boundaries. In fact, he brazenly steps over them, drops his pants, and waves his private parts at those who are appalled at such behavior. In a hypothetical universe, I think a Conan film directed by Peter Jackson would be amazing. But instead of the Peter Jackson who directed Lord of the Rings, how about the Peter Jackson who directed Brain Dead? Or Sam Raimi before he got his hands on Spiderman? In other words, before these filmmakers were corrupted by civilization. I truly believe that this is the Conan film that we got. In the best tradition of Howard, Nispel puts forth the question of barbarism vs. civilization and unequivocally sides with the barbarian, and not so much in terms of the story, but in the methods he uses to tell the story. ""Not so fast"", you say, ""One can explore the inherent struggle between barbarism vs. civilization and challenge the decorum of polite society without all this gratuitous crap. We don't need to see people's noses getting chopped off, people peeing themselves, and women being disrespected to convey that message."" In other words, we don't need to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone. I disagree. Just look at some of the more ""respectable"" films that explore the same themes, such as Deliverance or A Clockwork Orange, films which use some of the conventions of grindhouse cinema to get their point across.This almost palatable contempt for the conventions of polite society and those who adhere to it is best exemplified by Momoa himself. Rarely is the point of view of the protagonist and that of the director in such perfect synch. As for Momoa, he's like a big jungle cat, which is the highest compliment I can think of. In capturing the character that Robert E. Howard put down on paper, he nailed it. He absolutely nailed it. In the hands of a lesser actor, this film could have been an unmitigated disaster, but Momoa IS the film. He's in virtually every scene, which is fortunate, because his performance is a joy to behold. I was quite literally dumbfounded by how spot on it was. This is a character with virtually no regard for the ""rules"" of civilized behavior, a character that would not be slightly abashed about nailing a pirate queen on the deck of her own ship with the entire crew looking on, a character who is willing to do on a whim things that most ""civilized"" people would not even consider, such as deliberately getting himself arrested and subsequently slaughtering the entire police force to get his hands on his intended target. I can only imagine how some feminists will be outraged at his treatment of Tamara, but that's the whole point. She's civilized, and as such, she lives with the illusion that the pillars of civilization guarantee her a basic level of dignity and equality. Conan, on the other hand, has no such illusions. He knows innately that civilization is just an illusion, and that beyond its boundaries no one is guaranteed any level of self autonomy unless they are physically able to enforce it for themselves. So yeah, she gets a gag stuffed in her mouth. She doesn't get to talk just because she thinks she has a ""right"" to. A hard lesson, but a valuable one nonetheless.""But what about the story?"" Well, it's a pastiche, but I would certainly rate it higher than most Conan pastiches I read, which is something of a miracle, considering the fact that about half of it is written by Donnelly and Oppenheimer (with MAJOR improvements by Sean Hood, god bless him). The opening sequence, in which Morgan Freeman starts reading from the Nemedian chronicles, was so absurdly over the top that my initial gut reaction was bad flashbacks of ""Kull the Conqueror"". It was like riding in the passenger seat down the highway, safely along, when all of the sudden your driver has a spontaneous psychotic meltdown and swings the car off the road. And then, the birth scene; Jesus! I found myself going ""Really? I mean, really???"" It wasn't even the premise of the scene that really got to me. It was how so over the top and melodramatic the film was in depicting it. But then, somehow, miraculously, it didn't manage to land in the ditch. It got better. Much, much better. Or worse, depending on how you look at it. Leo Howard was totally convincing in his brief stint on young Conan, and I absolutely loved the scene with him against the Picts. Khalar and Marique are sufficiently over the top and scenery chewing (as well as creepy...really, REALLY CREEPY). Conan is given a literal rogues gallery of colorful villains, both male and female, to kill; all of them one dimensional, but damn fun to watch nonetheless.I have to say I loved the look of the film, and I thought the cinematography was impressive, not to mention the natural scenery of Bulgaria. I think it really captured the look of the Hyborian Age as Howard described it. I loved the actions scenes. Absolutely loved them. I think the film totally delivered on the sheer carnage factor. And let's admit it, that's a huge part of Conan's appeal, and this film has a pre-gunpowder body count that rivals ""Lone Wolf and Cub"". Momoa's speed and agility with a sword were nothing short of amazing to watch, and I've never seen sword work on film that looked quite like this, and I've seen plenty of sword films, both eastern and western. ""Unorthodox, but instinctive and natural as that of a timber wolf""; yeah, I think Momoa nailed it. The music? It was just sort of there. It carried the story, but it didn't particularly draw attention to itself. There were no distinctive and hummable leitmotifs that I can recall, which in itself is a disappointment. Tyler Bates has delivered better in the past.So, to sum things up now, when I read some of the initial reviews, I was worried that I was going to be hugely disappointed, so I tried my best to watch the film with my purist goggles off. But as it turns out, the Howard purist in me is perfectly okay with it as well, and ultimately that's the highest compliment I can think of. I know that there are people who will vehemently disagree with me on every point, and I'm perfectly okay with that. Honest. I'll be sorely disappointed if there are not future installments, but even if not, at least I'll have this film. If I can't get a filmed version of a genuine Howard story, at least I'll have a Conan film that gets the character right. Jason Momoa: YOU ARE THE MAN! I want to take home the unrated Blu-Ray Extended Edition and get gloriously drunk while watching it. Repeatedly. Did I forget to mention that Conan is fun?And in case anyone hasn't noticed by now, I've made quite a deliberate point of not bringing up the Milius film, nor comparing the two. Suffice it to say, if this were the film I had seen in 82, I think I would have been very happy indeed.",5,From One Die-Hard Howard Fan's Perspective,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,12580,"['Conan',

1400611,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B004EPYZT4,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Conan the Barbarian is about sort of the start of Conan's legend. Our hero is born on the battlefield after his mother receives a fatal blow and he is raised by his father. Later when Conan is a young boy an evil warlord and his witch daughter come to his village, everyone but Conan get killed and the whole movie is a quest for revenge. Yes there is a rather flimsy story in there about ancient artifacts and a necromantic mask and even a maiden in distress but plot wise this movie is lacking. I sat watching the entire movie expecting some plot twist, some depth, anything, but no there is nothing there is just fight, fight, fight, kill the bad guy and stop his evil plot, get the girl, ride off into the sunset, and that is all there is. The plot of Conan the Barbarian is sourly missing.Now I do not think this is a bad movie, the visuals are fantastic, the fight scenes are exiting and very creative and the actors all do a good job. Jason Momoa is perfect as Conan, Rachel Nichols do a good job with our main heroine, though the character herself is rather bland, Rose McGowan is ravishing as the evil witch Marique, my favorite character of the whole movie, Stephen Lang manages to get the very stereotypical bad guy Khalar Zym interesting. The supporting cast to do a great job. The music of Conan the Barbarian is forgettable but do frame the movie well.As eye candy this movie work well, it is entertaining, however I wonder a bit where the producer is going with this, even the short stories in the Conan comic books have more depth than this story, none of the characters are more than cardboard cut outs and they never develop during the course of the movie, and then there are the plot holes like how come Tamara who is a monk in a secluded monastery do not bat an eyelash at killing people? I am not saying she have to be innocent, but give some explanation for when I see a cleric in white robes I am not thinking cold blooded murderer, fighting skills yes, sure she can have learned those at the monastery, but why is she so used to killing people?I did enjoy myself when I watched this movie, it is a good popcorn flick but I had hoped for something more, some betrayals, some story twists, anything but oh I am going to kill the man who killed my father, what do you know I found him, let me just plow through his henchmen and then get him. For the entertainment value and the great visuals I give Conan the Barbarian 3 stars, the movie do really capture the look of the books and the comics, but I can not give it more due to the flat storyline no matter how much i really want to like it.I recommend Conan the Barbarian as a mindless action flick, a way to spend two hours if you are bored and just want to stare at a screen and be entertained by swords, magic, guts and boobs, a few good one liners which will make you smile, and a basic revenge plot, if however you want anything more than that then this movie is not for you.",3,Visually this movie get an A but is sorely lack plot.,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2952,"['Conan', 'Barbarian', 'sort', 'start', 'Conan', 'legend', 'hero', 'born', 'battlefield', 'mother', 'fatal', 'blow', 'raised', 'father', 'Later', 'when', 'Conan', 'young', 'boy', 'evil', 'warlord', 'witch', 'daughter', 'come', 'village', 'everyone', 'Conan', 'get', 'killed', 'whole', 'movie', 'quest', 'revenge', 'Yes', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'story', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'necromantic', 'mask', 'even', 'maiden', 'distress', 'plot', 'wise', 'movie', 'lacking', 'sat', 'watching', 'entire', 'movie', 'expecting', 'plot', 'twist', 'depth', 'anything', 'nothing', 'just', 'fight', 'fight', 'fight', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'stop', 'evil', 'plot', 'get', 'girl', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'plot', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'sourly', 'missing.Now', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'movie', 'visuals', 'are', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'exiting', 'very', 'creative', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'perfect', 'Conan', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'main', 'heroine', 'character', 'rather', 'bland', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'ravishing', 'evil', 'witch', 'Marique', 'favorite', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'get', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'bad', 'guy', 'Khalar', 'Zym', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'music', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'forgettable', 'do', 'frame', 'movie', 'well.As', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'work', 'well', 'entertaining', 'however', 'wonder', 'bit', 'where', 'producer', 'going', 'even', 'short', 'stories', 'Conan', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'story', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'outs', 'never', 'develop', 'course', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'how', 'come', 'Tamara', 'who', 'monk', 'secluded', 'monastery', 'do', 'not', 'bat', 'eyelash', 'killing', 'people', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'have', 'be', 'innocent', 'give', 'explanation', 'when', 'see', 'cleric', 'white', 'robes', 'am', 'not', 'thinking', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murderer', 'fighting', 'skills', 'yes', 'sure', 'can', 'have', 'learned', 'monastery', 'why', 'so', 'used', 'killing', 'people', 'did', 'enjoy', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'good', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'had', 'hoped', 'something', 'more', 'betrayals', 'story', 'twists', 'anything', 'oh', 'am', 'going', 'kill', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'found', 'let', 'just', 'plow', 'henchmen', 'then', 'get', 'entertainment', 'value', 'great', 'visuals', 'give', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', '3', 'stars', 'movie', 'do', 'really', 'capture', 'look', 'books', 'comics', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'more', 'due', 'flat', 'storyline', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'i', 'really', 'want', 'like', 'it.I', 'recommend', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'bored', 'just', 'want', 'stare', 'screen', 'be', 'entertained', 'swords', 'magic', 'guts', 'boobs', 'few', 'good', 'one', 'liners', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'basic', 'revenge', 'plot', 'however', 'want', 'anything', 'more', 'then', 'movie', 'not']",N/A

But if you've actually read Robert E. Howard's (1906-1936) Conan stories, it's a whole lot closer then Arnold's stumbling fool. It's odd, the quote people made fun of ""I live, I love, I slay -- I am content""... is actually right out of the books.I think the fault of this movie was trying to incorporate some of the Arnold Schwarzenegger films story line into it. The whole vengeance on the people who killed his family has nothing to do with Robert E. Howard's Conan, the same with the riddle of steel stuff. Also, why is he in a dress? And what's with the obviously silly swords, (two blades?) while not as bad as the helmet worn by Mickey Rourke in The Immortals, or Russell Crowe's chrome job in Gladiator... it's obvious the designers wanted something new and cool, but stood out as ""simply wrong"".

I wasn't expecting much going into this movie to begin with but it ended up being alot worse than I was expecting it to be. You'd think with a $90 Million budget, we'd see something absolutely spectacular. The thing that gets me even more is the fact that the director is Marcus Nispel. Marcus Nispel, as you all may know, is the director who remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre & Friday the 13th(both of whom were box-office successes). To me, the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  was even better than the original so you can see why it really gets to me.This remake tells the story of a young boy born on the battlefield who grows up hellbent on avenging his father's death yet his vendetta escalates into something much more where he faces the most impossible of odds.Seems to me that where the film falls is in actor Jason Momoa. His portrayal of Conan is simply awful. Like I read somewhere in another review of the movie online, it seems as though Momoa felt like he couldn't live up to Arnold Schwarzennegar's Conan. Let's face it, Momoa has the pecs for the movie...I just wish he would've shown some passion for the role. Too, the screenplay lacked depth and scope which could've been another reason why this movie failed.The action in the movie is tight, however, and gory. That, I hate to say, seems to be the only redeeming value to this movie.As much as I'd like to recommend this Conan to everyone, I'm afraid that I can't. Heck, Conan the Adventurer(the TV series) was even better than this and it was made on a cheaper budget. I'd hunt down the original Conan movies.

It's not true to the Arnold Schwarzenegger version from the 80s movies. Even if you toss out the entire Conan premise and take it as a generic fantasy action film, it still sucks. Why?- the plot is extremely generic, yet still rife with implausibilities (why didn't they just shatter the bone fragments into smaller fragments... and then smaller fragments... and then into dust?) and holes (in Conan's homeland, dominated by proud barbarian tribes, who were those animal guys supposed to be, where did they come from, and what was the point of their wandering around shirtless on a frozen mountaintop right next to a village of dangerous barbarian warriors?)- the music is bombastic and generic.- the violence, which should be the FOCUS of this film, is disappointing. There are a couple grisly moments, but they're gross-out, not visceral combat. You see some severed heads and a bloody face-hole AFTER the fighting is done, but the combat is all 'swing sword, don't really show it cutting,dismembering or impaling, then show a huge splash of cartoon blood'. It's gratuitous without being gratifying. It's like they took a PG movie's battle scenes, then added some CG blood splashes to get that R rating.- Conan doesn't look tough. He has big muscles in the way that the barbie-doll dudes do at the gym. They work out daily and have muscles, but they also pluck their eyebrows, shave their legs, and style their hair. What's so manly about that? Arnold's Conan looked as though he could (and would) rip you in half.

While it attempts to remain closer to the works of Robert E. Howard, it lacks the heart and epic qualities of Howard's writing. The casting is like a bad joke. Jason Momoa may look the part, but his over-confidence and exaggerated expressions come off as being silly instead of stern and powerful. There is no consistency whatsoever in the accents or dialects of the various groups of people that Conan encounters in his travels. The world of Hyboria is dramatically reduced as a result, especially considering how quickly Conan is able to travel from land to land in search of his betrayers. Most of the story and background are related by an unseen narrator, who quickly tries to piece things together for the audience in between the overblown action sequences. Zym is a bland and forgettable villain that would cower before James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. What is worse, the grand scheme that has taken him over 20 years of battling and searching to complete is spoiled in one brief and unsatisfying final conflict. This consists mostly of unbelievable feats and unnecessary computerization. The only entertainment comes from the absurd amount of bloodshed and heavy reliance on nude wenches.

But it helps when you have vengeance driving you.Even though they are Barbarians, they are not untouchable. That is the hard lesson that young Conan learns when a foreign army invades his village, slaughters the people, and leaves him to die right alongside his father. Up until then he had a decent life. It was hard and full of bloodshed and loss, but his dad was teaching him the finer points of swordsmanship and how to be a decent warrior. But in that moment everything changed. Khalar (Stephen Lang) is after only one thing: the missing pieces to a mythical mask that gives its wearer the power of necromancy. It seems that the local do-gooders killed his sorceress wife and he wants her back again, so she can bring an underworld army with her and make him the most powerful thug on the face of the earth. But in order to activate the mask, he needs the blood of someone from one of the original necromancer bloodlines.Twenty years later, he is still seeking her out, along with his sorceress daughter Marique (Rose McGowen). But Conan (Jason Momoa) has grown up in the meantime with a grudge nearly as big as his muscles. He wants revenge for the death of his father and the destruction of his village. And if he has to kidnap the beautiful Tamara (Rachel Nichols), the last of the ancient bloodline, to do it, he will. This leads to a confrontation of sorcery and necromancy as the two enemies are pitted against one another in a battle that is both personal and otherwise. Overall, the movie isn't awful but it isn't magnificent either. It falls somewhere in the middle, hampered by the frequent gore and absurd departures from rational characterization. (Why would a pure little ""monk"" like Tamara get down and dirty for a night with Conan, and then return to her chaste monastery as if nothing had happened? And why would Marique take her on in a closed space and not use magic?) But the music is stirring and the performances are good. It is even a halfway decent plot with good visuals to fill in the gaps.But that's when we get to the real problems here -- for me, maybe as a woman and maybe merely as a viewer, the film dragged in places, particularly when it was just Conan doing battle with sandmen, or a giant octopus-like creature, or simply a bad guy in the dungeons. It picked up the pace whenever Tamara was around but the downside is that in showcasing how cool Conan is, they kind of ignored the much more interesting characters -- like Marique, the stuff of Barbarian nightmares. This film is also simply beautiful to look at, with lush, rich surroundings that range from panoramic daylight to the dank underground. And I loved the costuming; it isn't much to look at for the first half, but when we get into the female priestesses and ceremonial robes, it's gorgeous.Inspired by the earlier film in the same vein, one does not expect epic writing brilliance from Conan the Barbarian. One expects gorgeous women in distress, oiled muscles glinting in the sunlight, blood spraying in all directions, and some good old fashioned sorcery -- and that is pretty much what one gets. There were moments I really enjoyed, moments where I was bored, moments that disgusted me, and moments in which I wished it had simply been better. Because the potential was there, it just got kind of sidetracked in its desire to be a formulaic success.",3,Visually Stunning,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3492,"['Life', ""n't"", 'easy', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'weighted', 'down', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'sheer', 'enthusiasm', 'hard', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'when', 'have', 'vengeance', 'driving', 'you.Even', 'are', 'Barbarians', 'are', 'not', 'untouchable', 'hard', 'lesson', 'young', 'Conan', 'when', 'foreign', 'army', 'village', 'people', 'die', 'right', 'father', 'then', 'had', 'decent', 'life', 'was', 'hard', 'full', 'bloodshed', 'loss', 'dad', 'was', 'teaching', 'finer', 'points', 'swordsmanship', 'how', 'be', 'decent', 'warrior', 'moment', 'everything', 'changed', 'Khalar', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'pieces', 'mythical', 'mask', 'wearer', 'power', 'necromancy', 'local', 'do-gooders', 'killed', 'sorceress', 'wife', 'back', 'again', 'can', 'bring', 'underworld', 'army', 'make', 'most', 'powerful', 'thug', 'face', 'earth', 'order', 'activate', 'mask', 'blood', 'someone', 'one', 'original', 'necromancer', 'bloodlines.Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'seeking', 'out', 'sorceress', 'daughter', 'Marique', 'Rose', 'McGowen', 'Conan', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'grown', 'up', 'meantime', 'grudge', 'nearly', 'as', 'big', 'muscles', 'revenge', 'death', 'father', 'destruction', 'village', 'kidnap', 'beautiful', 'Tamara', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'last', 'ancient', 'bloodline', 'do', 'will', 'confrontation', 'sorcery', 'necromancy', 'two', 'enemies', 'are', 'pitted', 'one', 'battle', 'personal', 'otherwise', 'Overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'awful', ""n't"", 'magnificent', 'either', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'hampered', 'frequent', 'gore', 'absurd', 'departures', 'rational', 'characterization', 'Why', 'would', 'pure', 'little', 'monk', 'Tamara', 'get', 'down', 'dirty', 'night', 'Conan', 'then', 'return', 'chaste', 'monastery', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened', 'why', 'would', 'Marique', 'take', 'closed', 'space', 'not', 'use', 'magic', 'music', 'stirring', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'halfway', 'decent', 'plot', 'good', 'visuals', 'fill', 'gaps.But', 'when', 'get', 'real', 'problems', 'here', 'maybe', 'woman', 'maybe', 'merely', 'viewer', 'film', 'dragged', 'places', 'particularly', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'Conan', 'doing', 'battle', 'sandmen', 'giant', 'octopus-like', 'creature', 'simply', 'bad', 'guy', 'dungeons', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'whenever', 'Tamara', 'was', 'around', 'downside', 'showcasing', 'how', 'cool', 'Conan', 'kind', 'ignored', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Marique', 'stuff', 'Barbarian', 'nightmares', 'film', 'also', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'look', 'lush', 'rich', 'surroundings', 'range', 'panoramic', 'daylight', 'dank', 'underground', 'loved', 'costuming', ""n't"", 'much', 'look', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'get', 'female', 'priestesses', 'ceremonial', 'robes', 'gorgeous.Inspired', 'earlier', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'one', 'not', 'expect', 'epic', 'writing', 'brilliance', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'One', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'distress', 'oiled', 'muscles', 'glinting', 'sunlight', 'blood', 'spraying', 'directions', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sorcery', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'one', 'were', 'moments', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'bored', 'moments', 'disgusted', 'moments', 'wished', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'better', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'just', 'got', 'kind', 'sidetracked', 'desire', 'be', 'formulaic', 'success']",N/A

Second, it is not the exact same as the Arnold one, so that is good.This film, as expected, is dull, has no appeal, bad acting and we could care less about the characters, we only want the movie to end.  Films like these need to have a sense of purpose and adventure - this had none.  Part of the problem is Conan was killer child from the get go and was superman invincible throughout the film.  We never felt that he was in danger because he was always killing at will, regardless of how many things there were.Compare this to Arnold's film where he was a slave, his mind was of the slave mind, then he turned into a killer and he could be defeated.  Of course, in Arnold's film, he was the main attraction, but the story was much better with no idiotic punchlines and cliches.  That one had a sense of suspense, adventure, the right amount of action and a good story.  Clearly people doing remakes can't even get that right, which is why they are doing remakes!This is another remake that should not have been made and was a waste for all involved.  If the actors did not need the money, I am sure they would have turned this one down.  Also, Schwarzenegger was of a Germanic descent (other part black) so he fit the Barbarian role.  This Jason Momoa does not of course.  In case you don't know, barbarians were the Germanic tribes who had no history, culture, structure or civilization, but who constantly invaded Europe and harassed Rome until it fell.  Those tribes went onto form the modern nations of The UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, The US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Scandinavia, And the rest of western Europe, including Italy and Spain.  The latter still retained a Roman and African culture.The bottom line is - stay away from this one.  This cannot be added to the collection - unless you like uninteresting films.

The lead roles in this plot less version are shallow at best. Conan's whole quest was due to his father's murder, in John Milius's version Conan had a lot more to be mad about, his family and village destroyed and then he is put into slavery pushing a wooden wheel for twenty years. Then the antagonist kills Conan's Queen. The clown in this version was just not convincing, the only battle training Conan received was from his father. While in the original, Conan was sent to the oriental War Masters to learn to become a great warrior, he was also forced into reading and writing. Jason momoa or whatever his name is would surprise me if he actually knew how to read. Again in the original Conan was not a lone wolf, he had friends who would die for him and together they brought down Thulsa Doom. In this version the antagonist is not quite as frightening as James Earl Jones, not quite as potent. Stephen Lang looked like an overly adorned fool. There was no character development and the movie was very loud and looked more like 'The Mummy"". They substituted acting and plot for special effects and noise. There was also almost no allusion to the original works of Robert E. Howard.

And unto this, Conan, destined to wear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow.  It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga.  Let me tell you of the days of high adventure.""So begins the awesome prologue of Conan The Barbarian released in 1982.  The original Conan helped catapult Arnold Schwarzenegger to super stardom.  This summer's reboot stars Jason Mamoa, who plays Khal Drogo in the HBO series, A Game of Thrones.  While Jason Mamoa is perfectly cast as Conan, the Conan reboot is no match for the original film.  Though this reboot of Conan is better than 1984's Conan The Destroyer.Reboots necessarily invite comparison to the original movie.  Unfortunately for this reboot, the original Conan The Barbarian is a cult classic because it is actually a really good movie.  This may be hard to believe if you have not seen the original 1982 film because of the governator's reputation for making brain dead action movies, but here are a few fun facts about the 1982 film.  The original Conan The Barbarian was directed and co-written by John Milius (writer of Apocalypse Now) with writing help from Oliver Stone.  Arnold played the title role, but the movie wouldn't have been the classic it was without James Earl Jones' portrayal of the villainous Thulsa Doom.  To top it off, the music was composed by Basil Poledouris.  You may not know the name but you know his music -- Robocop, Starship Troopers and Red Dawn to name a few.Now comes the 2011 Conan reboot, which is in all fairness, a respectable action movie directed by Marcus Nispel, starring the aforementioned Jason Mamoa.  Ron Perlman does a great job playing Conan's father and Leo Howard almost steals the show as the young Conan.  The makers of the Conan reboot wisely opted for an R rating.  There is sufficient bloodletting to do justice to the Conan mythos. Where Conan begins to go off track is with its one dimensional characters and underutilized fantasy elements.  Chief among the weak characters is the villain, Khalar Zym, played by the extremely talented Stephen Lang.  Khalar Zym is a poor shadow of the villainous Thulsa Doom.Zym is introduced as an all conquering bad ass on the quest for a fabled mask that is supposed to bestow great power upon whoever wears it.  Despite all the buildup of this mystical super weapon, it turns out to have about as much power as a flashlight.  Epic super weapon fail.  Without a strong villain to provide a suitable challenge for Conan, the movie doesn't ever pick up steam.  Most of the elements for a good movie are in place -- great cast, good action scenes and strong production values, but Zym and his cadre of bad guys just don't carry their weight as fantasy villains.  In the pantheon of villains, Zym is a forgettable b-lister.Hopefully, the writers can remedy the lack of a strong villain in a sequel.  There's a lot of potential for a franchise and Jason Mamoa is the ideal Conan, but this Conan fan is still waiting for the days of high adventure.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",2,Epic Super Weapon Fail,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3180,"['Review', 'time', 'when', 'oceans', 'drank', 'Atlantis', 'rise', 'sons', 'Aryas', 'was', 'age', 'undreamed', 'Conan', 'destined', 'wear', 'jeweled', 'crown', 'Aquilonia', 'troubled', 'brow', 'chronicler', 'who', 'alone', 'can', 'tell', 'thee', 'saga', 'Let', 'tell', 'days', 'high', 'adventure', 'So', 'awesome', 'prologue', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'released', '1982', 'original', 'Conan', 'helped', 'catapult', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'super', 'stardom', 'summer', 'reboot', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'who', 'Khal', 'Drogo', 'HBO', 'series', 'A', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Conan', 'Conan', 'reboot', 'match', 'original', 'film', 'reboot', 'Conan', 'better', '1984', 'Conan', 'Destroyer.Reboots', 'necessarily', 'invite', 'comparison', 'original', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'reboot', 'original', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'cult', 'classic', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', '1982', 'film', 'governator', 'reputation', 'making', 'brain', 'dead', 'action', 'movies', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'fun', 'facts', '1982', 'film', 'original', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'was', 'directed', 'co-written', 'John', 'Milius', 'writer', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'writing', 'help', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Arnold', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'was', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'portrayal', 'villainous', 'Thulsa', 'Doom', 'top', 'off', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'name', 'know', 'music', 'Robocop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'name', 'few.Now', '2011', 'Conan', 'reboot', 'fairness', 'respectable', 'action', 'movie', 'directed', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'starring', 'aforementioned', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Conan', 'father', 'Leo', 'Howard', 'almost', 'show', 'young', 'Conan', 'makers', 'Conan', 'reboot', 'wisely', 'opted', 'R', 'rating', 'sufficient', 'bloodletting', 'do', 'justice', 'Conan', 'mythos', 'Where', 'Conan', 'go', 'off', 'track', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'underutilized', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'Chief', 'weak', 'characters', 'villain', 'Khalar', 'Zym', 'played', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Khalar', 'Zym', 'poor', 'shadow', 'villainous', 'Thulsa', 'Doom.Zym', 'introduced', 'conquering', 'bad', 'ass', 'quest', 'fabled', 'mask', 'supposed', 'bestow', 'great', 'power', 'whoever', 'buildup', 'mystical', 'super', 'weapon', 'out', 'have', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'flashlight', 'Epic', 'super', 'weapon', 'fail', 'strong', 'villain', 'provide', 'suitable', 'challenge', 'Conan', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'Most', 'elements', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'place', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'strong', 'production', 'values', 'Zym', 'cadre', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'fantasy', 'villains', 'pantheon', 'villains', 'Zym', 'forgettable', 'b-lister.Hopefully', 'writers', 'can', 'remedy', 'lack', 'strong', 'villain', 'sequel', 'lot', 'potential', 'franchise', 'Jason', 'Mamoa', 'ideal', 'Conan', 'Conan', 'fan', 'still', 'waiting', 'days', 'high', 'adventure.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",N/A

At the same time, I was reading bodybuilding magazines when an amazing Austrian kid started winning major contests.  Back then it wasn't hard to find some of the old Weird Tales issues, so I even read some of the real Howard stories.  (The Lancer paperbacks were heavily edited, and some of the content wasn't Howard's writing at all.)  My take is that Schwarzenegger's Conan was great, and a lot of fun, even if the critics ridiculed it at the time.  Momoa's Conan isn't the same a Schwarzenegger's, but it's also great, and also a lot of fun.  Everyone involved with this movie was a real fan, and they put their hearts into it.

1400673,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B004EPYZT4,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Apparently, this film took place during the dark ages......or.......everything bloody had to take place on a dark day.  I don't know how else to explain why the filmmakers took every opportunity to stage the bulk of the swordplay in dark ill-lit interiors or during the gloom of day.  They were also inordinately fond of nighttime scenes.  The battle to end all battles took place in a dark cave barely lit by torches.  I ache for the days when movies were made in such a way that everything could be seen.  Otherwise, what's the point?  What's the point in staging elaborate sword fights if they're next to impossible to see?  Especially in this case, when the film is little more than a series of fight sequences strung together.  What little plot there was involved multiple quests for a pure blood woman, parts of a magic mask, and, of course, vengeance.  Lots of locales are visited, each thoughtfully provided with an onscreen place name.  Both good and bad, this movies rushes along at a fast pace hardly allowing for anything to register.  Very little of it is memorable.  Everything is so carefully orchestrated that the results seem mechanical and by the numbers.  This is supposed to be a sword and sorcery film, where's the magic?  There's plenty of swordplay but little in the way of the supernatural.  What little there is conjured up belongs to the dubious charms of Marique (Rose McGowan) the witch daughter of Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang).  Rose McGowan gives what amounts to the laziest performance by channeling Freddy Krueger right down to the knives/fingers.  If this isn't an act of plagiarism, I don't know what is.  Every nuance of her ""witch"" is a clich&eacute;.  Unfortunately, she is not the lone straggler as far as performances go.  Jason Momoa as Conan takes the honors as the worst of the lot by snarling on cue while glaring mightily.  That's the extent of his range.  If scowling were a fine art, he'd still fall short of the mark.  He has only one facial expression barely visible under his mop of hair.For all the savagery depicted, this film is curiously detached, passionless, with characters as cold as the sets they pose on.

1400674,AYG1U47VFZ165,B004EPYZT4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","As someone who watches a lot of films, I know that there are certain flicks I'm simply prone to like more than others.  B movies - good ones and bad ones - have always been a fascination of mine.  Over my years of writing about films, I've tried to narrow down specifically to what interests me most about these `side' pictures, but I've never been able to nail my arguments exactly on the head.  I tend to think it's that, like any good purveyor of film, I'd like to think - if the opportunity presented itself - I could pen a great screenplay.  I could give it all the right pieces; I could cast the right actors; I could devise the right look and capture the right feel.  I could produce a pretty solid blockbuster, one that would net me untold riches, praise and adulation of fanboys everywhere, and a contract to continue churning out film after film for the entertainment of the masses so the cycle could repeat itself over and over again until my sad passing.Then, I watch a film like 2011's CONAN re-launch, and I figure, ""Why bother?""  I quickly follow up that thought with, ""Is THIS the best we can do?""If THE LORD OF THE RINGS franchise taught the entertainment industry anything, then that lesson would be that, simply, ""There's an astonishingly huge audience for well-made, well-produced, well-assembled fantasy films.""  The Conan property - in many respects - has great similarity to Tolkien's works: (1) it involves its own world creation; (2) there are strong men and strong women as central characters; (3) there's more than enough swords and sorcery to keep an audience captivated; and (4) there're creatures and castles aplenty!  Sure, maybe Conan - with its heavy emphasis on blood, broads, and broadswords - is more of an adult-themed fantasy property, but I think you get the drift.  There're volumes and volumes of source material on top of Robert E. Howard's written words, and, it's clear that the makers of the film were familiar with the pieces that make-up a Conan story ... but how could they have gotten it so horribly wrong?I suppose there's something to be said about casting a relative unknown in the lead role.  Jason Momoa cut his teeth on SyFy's ""Stargate: Atlantis"" but he really came to fruition in the role of Khal Drogo in HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" series.  Transitioning into the role as the lead Cimmerian could've required stronger acting chops only if the material (i.e. ""the script"") required it, but let's face facts, folks: we're not talking Shakespeare here.  Robert E. Howard essentially grew Conan for the pulps of the 1930's (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Thankfully, this reboot kept Conan light on talk and relatively heavy on action.  `Nuff said on that front.I suppose there's something to be said about placing the property of Conan in the hands of a relatively `fresh' director.  Marcus Nispel's filmography on IMDB.com lists 16 films, but many of them appear to be documentaries associated to music videos.  But there was the 2004 remake of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  He also directed PATHFINDER, a film that might be aptly described as very Conan-ish in appearances.  He also directed the re-imagining of FRIDAY THE 13TH in 2009.  While these are not necessarily any highbrow properties, one could wonder what a more skilled craftsman behind the camera might've done with the script.  I can say that the film includes one horribly edited horse chase sequence ... first, Conan's trailing behind the baddie ... suddenly, he's alongside the baddie ... then he's behind the guy again ... now, he's somehow coming at him from the front ... ??? ... ???  In the hands of a more experienced director, this probably wouldn't have happened.And, then, there's something to be said for story ...The film is an origins tale.  Studios seem to prefer some tweaking of any hero's beginnings when they re-visit a franchise, and CONAN is treated no differently.  After being cut from the womb of his mother dying on a battlefield (no other context is given nor apparently felt needed by the scriptors), baby Conan matures into a young, bloodlusting killing machine.  His father (played with little effort by genre-regular Ron Perlman, an actor who deserved better material than this) tries to tame his boy's predilection for violence, but his untimely death at the hands of the film's villain - Khalar Zym (played by the underrated Stephen Lang) - essentially gives the lad his life mission: to avenge his father's murder.  (So, at this point, we're basically looking at Batman in a loincloth!)  However, the next we see Conan, he's grown into manhood, chiseled his own abs, and - lo and behold - never really done anything about going after the men who killed his old man.  It's a good thing that the script suddenly called for a chance encounter with one of the bad guys, or, otherwise, Conan may've suffered his first mid-life crisis before he avenged dear old dad.  (This assumes that the average Cimmerian's life expectancy craps out around 38 years old.)Keep in mind: I love B pictures, of which CONAN clearly is a variety.  I also love the property; I think ""Conan the Barbarian"" is one of Robert E. Howard's greatest creations.  I also love fantasy films.But, again I ask, ""Is this the BEST we can do?""All of the right pieces were there.  There's some solid location shooting.  There's pretty standard costuming and effects work for a B picture.  Much like the Conan of written legend, there are plenty of heavy, surly types that need to be dispatched at the hands of our hero.  There are even plenty of maidens to be wooed; in fact, the earlier scenes from the film showed the greatest promise!  Conan's hanging out in a dimly lit tavern.  He's drinking and yucking it up with the men and he's virtually surrounded by the best scantily-clad women a casting director could find!  It's fantasy come true, lifted right from the pages of any Conan comic book!  Too bad the best stuff ended right there.Meanwhile, back to the story ...Khalar Zym's quest?  Well, as best as I can surmise, there's this magical mask (the one covered in the film's obligatory opening sequence narrated by Morgan Freeman?) that renders the wearer ... what ... er ... magical?  Mystical?  Well, let's just agree that it's powerful!  It never gets clearly defined, but, suffice it to say, once Zym has the mask, he'll have the power to bring his dead sorceress/wife back from beyond the grave ... not that we're ever shown any footage of their loving marriage to believe he'd want to do it.  We're just supposed to accept his quest it at face value.  Besides, his wife's only scenes were those of her burning at the stake by ... well ... it's never quite explained, but I'm sure they meant to do it!  Alas, we're never quite clear as to why that happened.  It must've been because either (A) she was a sorceress or (B) it was Monday, and that's what rapers and pillagers do on a Monday in the Hyborean Age.Lo and behold, Zym has a daughter, Marique (played by Rose McGowan in what must singly be the absolute worst casting mistake for 2011).  Now, don't ask me why, but, apparently, Marique has the hots for her old man (she tries to seduce him in one scene).  Despite having an obvious attraction for dad that could be better acted upon with mom out of the picture (hint hint), Marique still joins daddy dearest on his personal mission to bring big bad momma back from the dead.  Why exactly?  Again, we're not told, so, as an audience, we're just supposed to accept the obvious irony.  Sadly, Marique preens about every scene, dangling menacingly her Freddy Krueger-like finger blades, and spouts her nonsensical lines in an almost fairy-tale voice that only further distorts any logical foundation for her character.  (I'd really like to see the director's notes to Ms. McGowan on this one!)Seriously, you could take all of the parts of the world's best sports car and lay them on the floor of an automotive garage.  You could follow a massive instruction manual to assemble it properly.  But, unless you complete the task properly, you're not going to have the world's best sports car.  You may end up with a reasonable facsimile (think the first Conan movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger), but that doesn't mean anyone's going to want to buy it.  Likewise, CONAN - as a motion picture - had all of the right pieces.  A burly actor in a role that required burliness!  Magicians and sorcerers!  Voluptuous women throwing themselves at men!  Buckets of bloodspray every time a baddie is gutted alive!  A fairy princess (of sorts) that needs rescue!  Caves full of skulls!  Oceans with monsters!  Swords as big as a man!  Castles aplenty!  But I've absolutely no idea whether the makers consulted the owner's manual or not when they made this picture because what we're left with was such a bruised and bloodied mess that should've been vastly more entertaining than it was.Recommended only if you like epic failures, of which this is one, but I'll still give it two stars for effort and because, as I've said, I like B pictures.  So sue me.  It's make a great B picture.",2,CONAN: Is This All There Is?,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,9107,"['someone', 'who', 'lot', 'films', 'know', 'are', 'certain', 'flicks', ""'m"", 'simply', 'prone',

That's good enough for people like me, but as a remake of the original Conan (1981) the fans might be a little disappointed because the original Conan has a SUPERB concept made by John Milius and Oliver Stone that doesn't focus so much on the action, this version is so action-packed but the concept is not so interesting for the fans.

That said, it ain't as good as the original with Arnie!Jason Momoa is an excellent Conan and brings him to life in a very different way to Arnie's. Momoa's Conan gets more out of the character, his charm, his brutality and his roguishness. Arnie's Conan is rather enigmatic. A lot of the time, stuff is happening to him, rather than him making stuff happening. For example, he doesn't escape his slavery, he is released. Momoa's Conan would have bust his way out and killed every one of his oppressors.The beginning is perhaps the best part of the 2011 version. The egg chase is very well done (similar to the one in Rapanui)and the battle with Kalar Zym's army is well handled too. However, the 80's version somehow did it better, with less guys and less effects. The middle of the film is ok as well, and its good to see Conan aboard a pirate ship, as per the Howard yarns. It's the end of the movie where it comes a bit unstuck and leaves you unsatisfied.The 80s version had that fantastic bloodbath battle at the standing stones, and Conan's 'Da hell wid you!' speech to Crom. This one has a lot of scrappy swordfights in tunnels with the main villains. Where did their armies go? The villain's pay off is weak too. Having achieved his magical ambition, he never gets to flex his muscles, raise a zombie army, call up a horrible demon, any of that stuff. Which is a pity.Design wise, the 2011 version is very nice, but not as good (sigh) as the 1980s version. John Milius spent a lot of time trying to get the 'historicity' of Hyborea right, and he achieved it very well. I couldn't help but miss Arnie's standing stones battle armour, which had just the right look to it. In a way, I think that all the action sequences in this film should have happened in reverse order, small fight to large battle, still with a tentacled beastie in the middle.Hopefully all the crappy reviews this film has received won't prevent more films of this nature being made, but I suspect it may, at least for the present.

1400687,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004EPYZT4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 8]","In the dark and ancient Hyborian Age, Conan the Cimmerian, brooding and grim and restless, roamed the lands in towering strides, fighting, wenching, thieving, and occasionally inadvertently saving the world from malevolent sorcerous threats. In the fullness of time, he is destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. Except that this film reboot fails to deliver on that moody pulp sensibility of which writer Robert E. Howard was such a master. And, to cut to the chase, yes, the Arnold Schwarzenegger version is superior. That one had more of an epic scope. And, as I remember it, more of a sense of fun.I saw CONAN THE BARBARIAN at a midnight showing. What initially began as a hopeful and raucous audience, clapping and hooting, gradually became this subdued crowd, disappointment all palpable. No one clapped when the end credits rolled. Certainly, Morgan Freeman's civilized voice-over narration doesn't get your blood pumping quite like Mako was able to do in the 1982 film. And certainly this tired interpretation could've benefited hugely from Basil Poledouris's rousing score. GAME OF THRONES' Jason Momoa makes for a good Conan. He has the physical presence and he's got the baleful hooded stare down pat. You believe him when he's wielding his sword and carving fleshy bits off those what get in his way. You can't fault him for the dialogue (but you can fault the screenplay writers). Casting Jason Momoa means more closely honoring Robert E. Howard's description of his iconic barbarian. Momoa is lithe and catlike quick and glowering. And he's not a lumbering blond Austrian, which is as far from Howard's specs of Conan as you can get.Born on a battlefield, Conan, even at a young age, demonstrates exceptional fighting prowess. Leo Howard, in  his brief stint as young Conan, proves to be a disquietingly savage child, and there's a bit of stealing Momoa's thunder here, even before Momoa's arrived on screen. I think the best bits in the film happen when Leo Howard is getting his blood up and facing off against adult warriors (and winning!). But young Conan's game efforts aren't enough to thwart the pillaging of his village, the slaughter of his people, the torture and murder of his father. Still, the implacable warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) should not have suffered the boy to live. This is a big bad's typical bungle.We were never going to be treated to an award-winning script with this movie. But I wonder how less disjointed the plot would've been had it only stuck to one thread? To Conan's seeking revenge on Khalar Zym, maybe? The messiness of the narrative surfaces once Khalar Zym and his creepy witch daughter Marique (goth pin-up model Rose McGowan) are allowed to have their own sub-plot, namely their quest to reconstruct the bone mask of Asheron, an artifact of which broken shards had been scattered across Hyboria but which, when reassembled, can be used in a spell to resurrect the dead. Khalar Zym desperately wants his dead wife brought back to life. His freaky daughter thinks she can just as easily slide into her place. Eew[...]Another required element to the spell is the pure blood of a descendant of the necromancers of Asheron. And so cue Tamara (Rachel Nichols), straight out of the monastery (yet well-versed with a blade). Tamara starts out as this promisingly capable and self-reliant girl, and so it's bitterly disappointing that she eventually succumbs to damsel-in-distress-itis. Rachel Nichols sure can scream a bunch.For the lusty, testosterone-ridden teen, CONAN meets its sword and sorcery obligations. Claret flows, viscera erupts. Noses are abused inhumanely. There are some rather gruesome moments, some brutal kills. There are a fair number of topless wenches, and even one random and arbitrary sex scene. The set designs are somewhat reminiscent of Frank Frazetta's paintings (and Frazetta's covers are what got me reading Conan stories in the first place). So that's gravy.There is non-stop action which may or may not become tedious in your eyes. The best fighty fights occur when kid Conan was doing his thing and then, much later, when the creepy witch daughter blows a kiss, this mystically summoning a unit of sand golems.I have to mention two more things.

The 1982 version was all loaded with plot and a lot less action creating a sense a evil, good, and pleassure.  This 2011 version did not even make much sense let alone create any feeling of good of evil other than as shamelessly spelled out by naming characters &#34;monks&#34; or whatever.  Also, as an epic tale the cast of 30 was just another shortcoming to go with the lost plot.  The 1982 version had hundreds of extras really adding to the image of completeness.  Am sure there are many who would like this version better.  For them I would suggest the recent Mission Impossible (Impossibly ridiculous)  movies by Tom Cruise, bad acting, no plot, and no congruence.  For those who like to become engaged mentally this is definitely not the one to watch.  In this, the hero always wins, the bad guy almost always comes up short.

1400692,A1XJWXF9LDFSL0,B004EPYZT4,Hwang,"[0, 0]","As a fan of Conan, I've read several Robert E. Howard novels on the character and religiously followed the marvel adaptations of the novel by way of graphic novels; not to mention consuming with regularity the Dark Horse BW annuals. I've never learned to appreciate the REH novels as I found the storyline boring, the descriptions less than well written by way of descriptive writing and the action scenes less than well encapsulated in the written form and boring. As for the Marvel comics, I found the storyline well written, the characters well drawn, while featuring some of the more alluring women ever drawn; incorporating some of the best known art ever featured in comics by the legendary artist Frank Frazetta whose work has been memorialized in hard-back editions of art books featuring illustrations spanning his career in the comic book industry, primarily cover illustrations for Marvel and Dark Horse. As for the Dark Horse annuals, we are introduced to some of the best drawn illustrations of Conan, as well as mouth-watering women, while being presented with the some of the best stylized and artistically rendered illustrations that constitute the first attempt by the comic industry to feature impressionist like illustrations that also incorporate some of the best storyline ever conceived in comicdom despite being in Black and White. So, when my childhood idol, Arnold Schzenegger ,was chosen to play the part of Conan in a Dino De Laurentis adaptation of the novel, I not only eagerly anticipated the release of the movie but also had high expectations; only to find myself disappointed with a rather poorly conceived storyline, less than inspired acting by Arnorld (despite his ever impressive muscles that was highly emphasized in the movie which presented him with ample opportunities to showcase his well sculptured body), and was let down by the poorly choreographed sword play that was less than inspiring and rather less than exciting; this despite being an aficionado of sword fighting in Shaw Brothers movies as well as kung fu flicks. So, when this remake was released, I was one of the first to watch the movie in 3D, and was greatly impressed with some of the best 3D simulations ever captured on film that featured a rich storyline, well developed characters, some of the most amusing exchanges between Conan and the heroine, some of the best sword fighting sequences ever choreographed and captured on film by Hollywood, while introducing the best ever version of Conan ever encapsulated in film - featuring an unknown actor by the name of Jason Momoa, who, despite lacking the well toned body that has become characteristic of the comic version of Conan, nevertheless, plays the part convincingly. Another worthy note: Rachel Nichols is captivating on film and alluring, and her smile is bewitching, and the amusing exchanges between her and Conan is endearing while the movie features the seat gripping excitement seldom found in Hollywood action films.A note about the special features: It presents a very informative account of John Howard's life as well as the manner in which Conan developed as a comic book character.

The thing that people should do is to not compare the two movies to each other, but compare them to the source material. Have any of you actually read the Conan stories written by Robert E. Howard?Conan The Barbarian 2011 brings Conan to his actual origin story; Howard did mention that Conan was born on a battle field and that he was an accomplished warrior before the age of 13. The bloody violence of this film captured the violence of the books. Jason Mamoa's sword choreography was far better than Arnold's swordsmanship in the original. I will admit that the main villian fell short of James Earl Jones' charismatic performance of the original. Rose Mcgowan stole the show for me in this version.

He did that later in ""The Terminator.""  Luckily, Jason Momoa was braver here (or filmmakers knew there would be an audience for his booboo).  Near the end of the film, you can see some of Jason's booty; that's reason enough to see this flick.The thing is: the booty is not staring at the camera.  He's also not in a position where his face is at the top of the screen and his calves are at the bottom.  This was filmed similarly to Warren Beatty's butt in ""Shampoo"" and Ethan Hawke's in ""Before the Devil.""  It's filmed where the butt is further away than the cranium, so it seems a bit oblique, or not fully there.  Here's the thing: Momoa has buns of steel.  I saw it and was like, ""Later for his sword!  Why does his butt look like it was carved out of precious metal!?!?!?""  It may make you think, ""No way!  No human can have a booty that perfect and beautiful!""I do think you get to see more of Jason's prized possession on ""Game of Thrones.""  Also, this made me scream to the heavens, ""Turn me into Lisa Bonet this instant!!!""

I can still see a young Conan pushing the giant grain mill stone with dozens of other older men and 20 years later he was pushing it by himself and the man ready to become the warrior.

So long as those of us who enjoy these kinds of movies pay good money to see films that insults the characters and stories we grew up on, and which insults us on the assumption that we'll accept trash like this just so long as it can be connected to memories and enjoyments we still value, our old heroes will continue to be treated like the cheap raw material for a fast buck by talentless movie-makers literally banking on our gullibility.

The storyline is extremely generic and you've most likely seen something similar many times before.What did I like? Conan does have some decent action scenes and a few ""wow!"" moments; I liked the sand scene a bit. It had decent acting from some of the cast. Music matched the setting.What did I dislike? As I previously stated, it's extremely generic. The young, pretentious Conan wants to be a warrior but his father tells him he isn't ready to wield his sword yet because he doesn't think when he fights; later, his father dies and it leads to your typical revenge flick. The characters had no depth and I found most of them very annoying. Very little dialogue and background. I thought the film would be saved by the action, but there aren't any mind-blowing scenes aside from a few vicious deaths. A couple of sword fights but nothing to set it apart from others. Also, it had small things like a decapitated head blinking and a dismembered hand moving; why??Overall, I feel a bit generous giving this film 2 stars, but it isn't the worst movie of all time.

So enter this remake of the 1982 Arnold swords and sorcery epic ""Conan: The Barbarian"" where a young man named Conan (Jason Momoa, HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") is born on a battlefield and is raised by his dad (Ron Perlman, ""Hellboy"") to be a great warrior.So after going on a test with some young soon to be warriors Conan is attacked by and kills a few savages, then soon after an army of these savages and their new leader Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang, ""Avatar"") attack Conan's village and his dad ends up dead. Zym is looking for bone fragments of an ancient bone mask that if pieced back together would give the person wearing it great power.After seeing his dad die Conan embarks on a vengeance sparked quest to avenge his father, but soon learns he must help lead the rest of the warrior nations against the bloodthirsty leader before he can reassemble the mask. There's lots of blood, fighting, more blood, a little good natured slave freeing, monsters and well you know how these type of movies go.Initially its basic and bare bones action and dialogue, however it does quickly become quite dull and hollow even as the blood flies and the body count multiplies. Momoa is at the very least a hulking presence and makes a good action hero, even if he's little more than a meat head.The rest of the cast includes Rachel Nichols (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra""), Rose McGowan (""Scream"") and Bob Sapp (""Elektra"" and a former K-1 competitor), so at least there's one attractive woman to gain the attention of the male viewer in between action sequences (I'd normally say two but Rose looks bizarre as Zym's daughter). But the film honestly gets very tiresome after the second or third fight segment, and most people will probably want the credits to roll long before the film ends. * out of 4 stars.",1,Conan: The Borebarian,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2009,"['Remakes', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'partly', 'cause', 'technology', 'better', 'can', 'have', 'bigger', 'sets', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'partly', 'cause', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'running', 'out', 'original', 'ideas', 'So', 'enter', 'remake', '1982', 'Arnold', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'epic', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Conan', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'born', 'battlefield', 'raised', 'dad', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Hellboy', 'be', 'great', 'warrior.So', 'going', 'test', 'young', 'soon', 'be', 'warriors', 'Conan', 'attacked', 'kills', 'few', 'savages', 'then', 'soon', 'army', 'savages', 'new', 'leader', 'Khalar', 'Zym', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Avatar', 'attack', 'Conan', 'village', 'dad', 'up', 'dead', 'Zym', 'looking', 'bone', 'fragments', 'ancient', 'bone', 'mask', 'pieced', 'back', 'together', 'would', 'give', 'person', 'wearing', 'great', 'power.After', 'seeing', 'dad', 'die', 'Conan', 'vengeance', 'sparked', 'quest', 'avenge', 'father', 'soon', 'must', 'help', 'lead', 'rest', 'warrior', 'nations', 'bloodthirsty', 'leader', 'can', 'reassemble', 'mask', 'lots', 'blood', 'fighting', 'more', 'blood', 'little', 'good', 'natured', 'slave', 'freeing', 'monsters', 'well', 'know', 'how', 'type', 'movies', 'go.Initially', 'basic', 'bare', 'bones', 'action', 'dialogue', 'however', 'quickly', 'become', 'quite', 'dull', 'hollow', 'even', 'blood', 'flies', 'body', 'count', 'multiplies', 'Momoa', 'very', 'least', 'hulking', 'presence', 'good', 'action', 'hero', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'meat', 'head.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'Scream', 'Bob', 'Sapp', 'Elektra', 'former', 'K-1', 'competitor', 'so', 'least', 'one', 'attractive', 'woman', 'gain', 'attention', 'male', 'viewer', 'action', 'sequences', ""'d"", 'normally', 'say', 'two', 'Rose', 'bizarre', 'Zym', 'daughter', 'film', 'honestly', 'very', 'tiresome', 'second', 'third', 'fight', 'segment', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'credits', 'roll', 'long', 'film', '*', '4', 'stars']",N/A

During the opening dialog and title there are 7+ CG effects near 25%. Also, the ending credits have glowing embers floating to a maximum of 25%.The cardboard cutout syndrome is fairly obvious in this title. Many scenes appear to have only 1 to 3 depths with the background or sides starkly flat. Usually when the syndrome wasn't apparent, the 3D lacked depth and crispness. I don't believe this movie was ever intended to be converted into 3D but if it was, they should not admit it.On a positive note, there were zero of the single instance 3D flaws normally seen in a conversion (that I noticed).

The film has some nice moments and Jason Momoa makes the role his own -- REH would have been happier with him than he ever would be with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yet, like the Milius adaption it suffers from this bizaare need to give Conan an origin that Howard never bothered with -- beyond references to his being born on a battlefield, fighting at the sack of an Acquilonian outpost when he was fifteen.  Ian Fleming never felt the need to do an origin on James Bond -- in CASINO ROYALE you meet a full-fledged professional agent.  Howard's first Conan story he is King of Acquilonia. In the second he is a thief new to the lands south of his native Cimmeria.  He wrote the saga as if the old adventurer was sitting around a campfire, regaling with his adventures as they came to him. Sean Hood has idea for the 2nd film, a pre-credits sequence using ""The Frost Giant's Daughter"" and after the credits, ""Queen of the Black Coast"".  That would be more like it.  Howard's Conan tales are mostly novellas -- which makes them perfect for adaption as movies.  One can only hope that the overseas box office and home video justify a second film (ala THE PUNISHER).  Will I buy this on blu ray?  Yes.  It is certainly better than CONAN THE DESTROYER, KULL THE CONQUEROR or RED SONJA.  It could have been so much more. Tyler Bates score is servicable but anyone is going to suffer in comparrision to the late Basil Pouldouris.  What do I like?  Well, beyond Momoa, I love Ron Perlman and he does well as always.  The action is wall to wall and Momoa does it incredibly.  Rose MacGuowan is suitably creepy as Marique. Stephen Lang is a good actor but the role somehow seems lacking. The sand golem sequence is terrific.  Yet all in all, this film doesn't quite fit the bill. One can only wonder what a Walter Hill, Oliver Stone or Robert Rodriguez could do with the property.  I am placing my hopes of a good adaption on Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER.  Listen, don't get me wrong.  Did I enjoy this film.  I did. I am just disappointed that it wasn't it really could have been.  Let us all cross our collective fingers that a second Conan film gets made and they get it right.",3,"Well, it really doesn't suck",1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2256,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'someone', 'do', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'right', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'film', 'nice', 'moments', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'role', 'own', 'REH', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'ever', 'would', 'be', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Milius', 'adaption', 'bizaare', 'need', 'give', 'Conan', 'origin', 'Howard', 'never', 'bothered', 'references', 'being', 'born', 'battlefield', 'fighting', 'sack', 'Acquilonian', 'outpost', 'when', 'was', 'fifteen', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'never', 'felt', 'need', 'do', 'origin', 'James', 'Bond', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'meet', 'full-fledged', 'professional', 'agent', 'Howard', 'first', 'Conan', 'story', 'King', 'Acquilonia', 'second', 'thief', 'new', 'lands', 'south', 'native', 'Cimmeria', 'wrote', 'saga', 'old', 'adventurer', 'was', 'sitting', 'campfire', 'regaling', 'adventures', 'came', 'Sean', 'Hood', 'idea', '2nd', 'film', 'pre-credits', 'sequence', 'using', 'Frost', 'Giant', 'Daughter', 'credits', 'Queen', 'Black', 'Coast', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'Howard', 'Conan', 'tales', 'are', 'mostly', 'novellas', 'perfect', 'adaption', 'movies', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'overseas', 'box', 'office', 'home', 'video', 'justify', 'second', 'film', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'Will', 'buy', 'blu', 'ray', 'Yes', 'certainly', 'better', 'CONAN', 'THE', 'DESTROYER', 'KULL', 'THE', 'CONQUEROR', 'RED', 'SONJA', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Tyler', 'Bates', 'score', 'servicable', 'anyone', 'going', 'suffer', 'comparrision', 'late', 'Basil', 'Pouldouris', 'What', 'do', 'like', 'Well', 'Momoa', 'love', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'well', 'always', 'action', 'wall', 'Momoa', 'incredibly', 'Rose', 'MacGuowan', 'suitably', 'creepy', 'Marique', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'good', 'actor', 'role', 'somehow', 'lacking', 'sand', 'golem', 'sequence', 'terrific', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'bill', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'could', 'do', 'property', 'am', 'placing', 'hopes', 'good', 'adaption', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'Listen', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', 'am', 'just', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Let', 'cross', 'collective', 'fingers', 'second', 'Conan', 'film', 'made', 'get', 'right']",N/A

1400743,ALND45MWBGUQS,B004EPYZT4,Lunar Boulevard,"[1, 1]","I'm not terribly familiar with the Conan series, although I know the basic plot and some of the characters. I can see why people enjoy the stories and the original film; they had a fantasy charm that was larger than life and provided some fun and memorable moments. That makes it all the more puzzling why this reboot exists, although with the state Hollywood is in these days I guess I'm not surprised. In short: this film is great for a laugh but serves little purpose beyond that. The characters are one-dimensional and completely uninteresting, meaning that it's hard to feel any connection to them. A majority of the players serve no purpose and by the end you'll probably forget who's who or lose your ability to care.The story itself is simplistic and the action sequences serve no real purpose other than to keep the viewer interested. I can't recall a single battle or fight that got me emotionally invested or felt like it had any bearing on the plot. Each one was the same thing: Conan yells and randomly charges in, a mediocre battle with shaky-cam editing ensues, and then it's off to the next one. There are some gory deaths along the way that aim to be creative but fall flat. Like the battles, they feel unnecessary and grow old rather quickly.However, it's the CGI that stands out. Not because it's superb but due to it being painfully bad. Granted, most CGI is noticeable to the human eye and often has trouble seamlessly blending into a film. Here it's just laughable and far to obvious. The original looked gritty and at least gave you the impression that it was a living, breathing world. Modern technology, as great as it may be, has ruined a lot of this effect and this movie is a prime example of what happens when you take a big budget and put spectacle over story. The pacing, effects, and characters are just awful. The film attempts to be epic and instead reeks of having too many haphazard elements thrown together without fleshing any of them out.I started laughing within the first ten seconds and that continued for the entire duration. My wife and I enjoy having bad movie nights once in a while and this film certainly fits the bill. It's terrible but at least fun enough to laugh at as mindless entertainment, hence the two star rating.

And I didn't mind the story changes at all, since I was expecting that.However, I didn't like the portrayal of the young Conan. This kid had a scowl on his face every time you saw him, and he looked at his father like he hated his guts. Is this how the director made the young Conan look tough? He looked like a juvenile delinquent who was mad at the world. So, of course, when he broke down when his father died, well, it seemed out of character.The two principal female characters always looked like they just stepped out of a beauty parlor, with lipstick and eye enhancement, especially the wicked witch, so not very convincing in their roles.But my major complaint was with the editing of the fight scenes, of which there are quite a few. I got a headache trying to follow the action. Oh, there was a lot of action and loud noise, and I normally like to watch a good fight scene, but not in this movie. When there was action, it was so fast that all I could see was a lot of movement. Mind you, I don't want to see the fight scenes in slow motion, but I felt the film editing was at fault. I understand some young movie fans like the action depicted like this, but I can't imagine why. It reminded me of some of the terrible previews of today, with fast-action biff-bam-boom in every scene, and if you blink your eyes you miss it.And I missed an intriguing villain like James Earl Jones, and the rousing background music by Basil Pouledouris was definitely a plus in the original. And I thought there was too much gratuitous violence, with blood spattering everywhere, in this version of the Conan story.I'm glad I saw it in a DVD borrowed from the library. I would definitely be angry if I paid good money for this. Too bad for the actor, in a way.

1400745,A24KZBAAUTC83R,B004EPYZT4,Mace & Lacey Gannon,"[14, 22]","I just saw this film. Been a HUGE Conan fan since the early 70's, from comic-books to novels to the films.When Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen to be the 1st Conan on film,I had my doubts. But after seeing it, despite some awkward dialogue, Arnold embodied at least most of the true heart of the character, helped MAJORLY by a collection of screen writer and director who obviously loved Robert E. Howard's greatest creation.John Milius just proved to me that modern-day writers, directors, and special effects doth not make a solid Conan film. The new one had great production, and an actor that just proved he has the look and feel of Conan. But the poor actor had to deal with the cards he was given to play one of the most beloved fantasy icons ever written.This film started out decently enough, but then spiraled ever downward faster than a speeding bullet with a ton of boulders on top of it. What a shame. Why is it that Hollywood can seemingly do comic-book caped crusader type heros great - but can't do Conan or Tarzan justice? For the life of me I can't figure this out. Filmmakers have TONS of choice written material with which to draw from. And yet, for this latest film, 3 or 4 screen writers cannot get it right. All it takes is one to screw it all up. This one took several.I hope SOMEONE with some true vision can take this poor new Conan actor and give him a much better Conan script and director - and make Conan the Barbarian the RIGHT way! Don't need an origin story. THAT has already been done. Like Batman and Superman. Leave it alone. Just pick up from the origin and get these heros to bigger and better adventures! STICK with the source material.I guess poor Tarzan, like Conan the barbarian, will be done half-assed until SOMEONE with half a brain can see that they have a wealth of source material from which to do a TRULY spectacular Tarzan or Conan film.

1400748,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004EPYZT4,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","Jason Momoa hit every note perfectly - not only does he truly look like REH's description of the wild barbarian (unlike the previous film incarnation), he sounds and acts just like the Conan of the novels. Sadly, it's the stupefying one-dimensional direction that sinks this film. A list of what it lacks is equal to the weights Momoa must have lifted to achieve those amazing pecs.What surprised me most was learning the film cost $70 million dollars to make, yet the flick feels and plays low-budget. I have to wonder what happened to all that funding? The CGI was adequate, hardly the jaw-dropping spectacle I was hoping to see. And this soon-to-be-on-SciFi-Saturday certainly did not expend its funding on a proven director. Just what about Marcus Nispel's resum&eacute; said he could guide an established action cache attached to such a historical fanbase? To live up to and exceed expectations? Stunning shortsightedness on the part of the producers is the only reasonable explanation in hiring someone whose background is music videos. Even a commercial director has some sense of character development, of pacing a story, and depth of characterization. Music video directors are their neo-hippie drooling step-cousins; their flashy productions don't even have to make sense.And it would be an understatement to say I was let down by screenwriters Thomas Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. They previously scripted a favorite flick in 'Sahara' with Matt McConaughey, so I presumed their story would be the foundation upon which fans could be proud. Instead, we're delivered a half-baked mess with only the flimsiest pretense of a plot.Further, with the sole exception of the always enjoyable Stephen Lang, I found many of the bad guy actors woefully lacking and uninspired. Especially the inner circle of henchmen who were appallingly flat, leaving a great deal to be desired. And coming from a fan of Rose McGowan: Having seen similar roles in a variety of flicks - her performance, while spot-on for her character - lacked a unique style that she could call her own. In my opinion all this, again, lands directly at the feet of Director Nispel. He could've easily gotten more from his artists. Lack of ability and lack of experience shows through on virtually every superficial and inadequate scene.What made this even more cringe-worthy was the cinematography - Nispel reveals his music video background with every multiple close-up and laughable posed shot.Then there's the car-sized plot holes:Example: The chief bad guy and his wannabe incestuous daughter are pulled all over creation in a giant boat. Why? No clue. It's never explained. It certainly seemed important - obviously we're supposed to be intrigued that this humongous water craft is being dragged over dry deserts and high mountains. And bleep me, they sure spent a lot time (money?) making sure we got to see that thing from every angle; as Nispel spends an inordinate amount of film getting it in almost every shot.Again - why? Can one even have a boat fetish?Following up on the logic of that boat. The bad guy's intent is to become a god as soon as possible, be reunited with this dead wife, and rule the world. Okay, got that part. And in order to facilitate all that, he and his thugs have to run all over the countryside to locate the various missing pieces so their boss can perform the profane ceremony, check. So then why take a massive ocean voyaging ship over hard scrabble land? Don't think that's going to expedite your mission dude, quite the opposite. In fact, why not just use a bunch of horses? You know, the whole 'speed' thing. If he was in such a flipping hurry, this bad guy sure took his sweet ass time. If this were a more serious film, I would hazard a layman's psychiatric analysis and suggest he subconsciously didn't want to proceed and did everything he could to actually slow down the process.Stuff like this is what's so infuriating - these are simple issues to work out in pre-production. Having the director and writers sit down over one long lunch and incongruities like these can be addressed, long before a single strip of film passes through the cameras.Overall, it was an okay flick, but I had higher expectations. Love Momoa's version of the Cimmerian, and again, Stephan Lang can do no wrong as far I'm concerned.

We're not exactly talking Conan The ""Librarian"" here. And yet somehow - and despite Herculean effort (if you'll forgive the terrible pun) - it just doesn't click.It should though. All the right ingredients for an update of this comic-book hero are there - bad guys with bad teeth - a minion with a severed nose and a tasty set of thumb-screws - an evil witch sporting razors for nail extensions - exotic wenches sporting very little else... And all the while a longhaired body-builder does his best to act while wielding a sword of destiny, riding a horse through haunted forests, causing landslides in slave mines, sneaking through secret passages into a turreted castle of ultimate doom (you know the sort) - and even finding time to shag a monastic nubile in a mud hut with very fetching candlelight. Not to mention all manner of burly warriors with more facial battle scars than members of the Scunthorpe Debate Society after a particularly rough game of Cribbage.To be fair to the lead actor on which pretty much everything rests - it's hard to follow in the triceps of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But Jason Momoa as Conan The Barbarian is likeable and a very credible presence on screen (he clearly bought a Bullworker in the last few months as well). Stephan Lang (of ""Avatar"" fame) is the main villain - a power-obsessed overlord trying to get an ancient mask back that will make him a God (I felt the same way last week when I was queuing in Tescos). He thoroughly enjoys a psychotic frown as he pokes your eyes out and regularly rabbits on about ""...rivers of blood..."" and other such delightful bedside chatter (dialogue above). There are loads of battle sequences to keep the action ante up and the BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout (it comes as a 'Double Play' set and there's a '3D' version too). There's even a believable 'attraction' between Jason Momoa and the gorgeous Rachel Nichols as Tamara the 'pure blood'. There's also the ever-watchable Ron Perlman as Corin (Conan's father) and Nonso Anozie plays Conan's loyal sidekick Artus - a man with Byzantine dreadlocks and personal hygiene issues.And yet this new remake grows tiresome very quickly - rather like ""The Prince Of Persia"" did. I think the main culprit is the incredibly derivative storyline - we've seen and heard all of this epic warrior and his journey nonsense before - and way too many times too. A boy witnesses his father and entire village be slaughtered - grows up to be a fierce warrior - systematically avenges all involved - meets fab-looking dolly bird en-route - saves the world from the forces of darkness - returns to a nicer mud hut at the end - has a shower (wash the blood and entrails off) - and settles in with a nice cup of cocoa and the Downton Abbey Christmas special. It sounds like great fun - it sounds rip-roaring - and at times it is. But it also feels a little empty-headed somehow. It's hard to get excited about this - and I'd admit to fast forwarding on more than one occasion. I also doubt I'd want to watch it again - so it's a rental rather than a purchase.Still - if you're up for a bit of a He-Man actioner - you could do worse - you could try Poker night at the Scunthorpe Debate Society...",3,"""...Behold...And Despair!""",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,3402,"['ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'accuse', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'fantasy', 'being', 'namby-pamby', 'cracked', 'skulls', 'slashed', 'limbs', 'plenty', 'enough', 'ketchup', 'worry', 'Burger', 'King', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'talking', 'Conan', 'Librarian', 'here', 'yet', 'somehow', 'Herculean', 'effort', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'terrible', 'pun', 'just', ""n't"", 'click.It', 'should', 'though', 'right', 'ingredients', 'update', 'comic-book', 'hero', 'are', 'there', 'bad', 'guys', 'bad', 'teeth', 'minion', 'severed', 'nose', 'tasty', 'set', 'thumb-screws', 'evil', 'witch', 'sporting', 'razors', 'nail', 'extensions', 'exotic', 'wenches', 'sporting', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'longhaired', 'body-builder', 'best', 'act', 'wielding', 'sword', 'destiny', 'riding', 'horse', 'haunted', 'forests', 'causing', 'landslides', 'slave', 'mines', 'sneaking', 'secret', 'passages', 'turreted', 'castle', 'ultimate', 'doom', 'know', 'sort', 'even', 'finding', 'time', 'shag', 'monastic', 'nubile', 'mud', 'hut', 'very', 'fetching', 'candlelight', 'Not', 'mention', 'manner', 'burly', 'warriors', 'more', 'facial', 'battle', 'scars', 'members', 'Scunthorpe', 'Debate', 'Society', 'particularly', 'rough', 'game', 'Cribbage.To', 'be', 'fair', 'lead', 'actor', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'hard', 'follow', 'triceps', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'likeable', 'very', 'credible', 'presence', 'screen', 'clearly', 'bought', 'Bullworker', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'well', 'Stephan', 'Lang', 'Avatar', 'fame', 'main', 'villain', 'power-obsessed', 'overlord', 'trying', 'get', 'ancient', 'mask', 'back', 'will', 'make', 'God', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'last', 'week', 'when', 'was', 'queuing', 'Tescos', 'thoroughly', 'psychotic', 'frown', 'eyes', 'out', 'regularly', 'rabbits', 'rivers', 'blood', 'other', 'such', 'delightful', 'bedside', 'chatter', 'dialogue', 'are', 'loads', 'battle', 'sequences', 'keep', 'action', 'up', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'picture', 'quality', 'immaculate', ""'Double"", 'Play', 'set', ""'3D"", 'version', 'too', 'even', 'believable', ""'attraction"", 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'gorgeous', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Tamara', ""'pure"", 'blood', 'also', 'ever-watchable', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Corin', 'Conan', 'father', 'Nonso', 'Anozie', 'Conan', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'Artus', 'man', 'Byzantine', 'dreadlocks', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'issues.And', 'yet', 'new', 'remake', 'tiresome', 'very', 'quickly', 'rather', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'did', 'think', 'main', 'culprit', 'incredibly', 'derivative', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'epic', 'warrior', 'journey', 'nonsense', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'too', 'boy', 'father', 'entire', 'village', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'up', 'be', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'systematically', 'involved', 'meets', 'fab-looking', 'dolly', 'bird', 'en-route', 'world', 'forces', 'darkness', 'returns', 'nicer', 'mud', 'hut', 'end', 'shower', 'blood', 'entrails', 'off', 'settles', 'nice', 'cup', 'cocoa', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Christmas', 'special', 'great', 'fun', 'rip-roaring', 'times', 'also', 'little', 'empty-headed', 'somehow', 'hard', 'get', 'excited', ""'d"", 'admit', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'also', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'rental', 'rather', 'purchase.Still', ""'re"", 'up', 'bit', 'He-Man', 'actioner', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'could', 'try', 'Poker', 'night', 'Scunthorpe', 'Debate', 'Society']",N/A

1400758,A3GJGIQ3GGW7UB,B004EPYZT4,"Matthew S. Spencer ""horror/fantasy author""","[3, 4]","So as a hardcore fantasy geek, I owe director Marcus Nispel and star Jason Momoa a ""Thank you"" for NOT taking an utter massive steaming dump on the legacy of Robert E. Howard, one of the founding fathers of modern heroic adventure fiction, though obviously not for lack of moron studio execs trying to make them.2011's CONAN THE BARBARIAN - Way better, more invigorating and involving than I'd hoped, but still a frustratingly uneven movie - mostly in the writing, but also tonally. Everything that's right/wrong with this picture can be summed with Morgan Freeman's opening voice-over narration. As the music and lights rise, we hear Freeman speaking ""Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities..."" And yep, it's the most awesome such oration this side of Ian McKellen uttering ""One Ring to rule them all..."" ...Then about a third in, said voice-over veers off into some LOTR-ripoff scattered-deus-ex-machina evil artifact bulls**t from the hack end of the screenwriting-by-committee team. Of people who gave this thumbs-up/thumbs-down, everyone agrees that the opening act, featuring Conan-as-a-boy (Leo Howard - no known relation to REH) and his father (Ron Perlman) is the best part. And DAMN, were they not kidding! I'd have been perfectly happy had the whole movie stuck with the young-Conan-and-Dad team. The chemistry's so right, I ain't gonna lie, the inevitable conclusion of this portion had me a little choked up. The rest of the movie can't seem to decide if it wants to be a remake of the '82 Milius/Schwarzenegger movie or its own, truer take on the material. What keeps it afloat is Jason Momoa as Conan. He strikes a harder-than-it-looks balance between likable, intelligent and relateable, but also believably savage and ruthless, at times downright terrifying to a startlingly *un*likable degree. To say we don't get big screen action-hero characters with this much dimension often enough is an understatement. I just wish more of the story-telling surrounding him had as much sense. Nods/references to Howard's original stories were a joy to spot, but I have to ask myself the same question one often asks about, say, the Star Wars prequels: If it weren't for my built-in fondness for what it's drawing on, would it stand on its own so well in this context? Sadly, I don't think so. The villains: Stephen Lang is no James Earl Jones by a long shot, but he's convincingly, palpably nasty, and is no easy pickin's for our hero/anti-hero; As for Rose McGowen as an evil sorceress, all I can really say is... Mmmmmm, yeeeesssssss... She's a baaaaaaaad girl who does baaaaaaaaaaad things... and I like her >:-) *AHEM!* Anyway. The action here is brutal, breathless, visceral... and often jaw-droppingly over the top, with supernatural/fantastical elements that often play into this nicely. I frequently laughed out loud (in a good way) at the sheer audacity of how bugf**k bats**t ""HOLY CRAP, DID THEY REALLY JUST FREAKIN' DO THAT?"" insane this gets, in ways I won't spoil (my favorite bit involves a guard sliding back a panel to see who's there, then NOT getting what he expects when he opens the door). But this also becomes one of the film's biggest problems. This may sound weird to some talking about a Conan movie, but after a while it gets TOO heavy on one huge action set-piece after another. Yeah, the Hyborian Age is a chaotic, primal, dangerous, tough-as-nails, morally ambiguous, unforgiving world, but it's also a haunting, brooding, fantastical, bittersweet, hypnotically beautiful, mystery-shrouded landscape like none other. The best Conan stories are as much about this as all the bloody mayhem, the cinematography captures it spot-on, and I found myself longing for more of those quiet, reflective moments to just bask in it a spell.",4,CROM!!!,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,3797,"['So', 'hardcore', 'fantasy', 'geek', 'owe', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'star', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'Thank', 'NOT', 'taking', 'utter', 'massive', 'steaming', 'dump', 'legacy', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'one', 'founding', 'fathers', 'modern', 'heroic', 'adventure', 'fiction', 'though', 'obviously', 'not', 'lack', 'moron', 'studio', 'execs', 'trying', 'make', 'them.2011', 'CONAN', 'THE', 'BARBARIAN', 'Way', 'better', 'more', 'invigorating', 'involving', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'still', 'frustratingly', 'uneven', 'movie', 'mostly', 'writing', 'also', 'tonally', 'Everything', 'right/wrong', 'picture', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'opening', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'music', 'lights', 'rise', 'hear', 'Freeman', 'speaking', 'years', 'when', 'oceans', 'drank', 'Atlantis', 'gleaming', 'cities', 'yep', 'most', 'awesome', 'such', 'oration', 'side', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'uttering', 'One', 'Ring', 'rule', 'Then', 'third', 'said', 'voice-over', 'veers', 'off', 'LOTR-ripoff', 'scattered-deus-ex-machina', 'evil', 'artifact', 'bulls**t', 'hack', 'end', 'screenwriting-by-committee', 'team', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'thumbs-up/thumbs-down', 'everyone', 'opening', 'act', 'featuring', 'Conan-as-a-boy', 'Leo', 'Howard', 'known', 'relation', 'REH', 'father', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'best', 'part', 'DAMN', 'were', 'not', 'kidding', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'had', 'whole', 'movie', 'stuck', 'young-Conan-and-Dad', 'team', 'chemistry', 'so', 'right', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'lie', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'portion', 'had', 'little', 'choked', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'be', 'remake', ""'82"", 'Milius/Schwarzenegger', 'movie', 'own', 'truer', 'take', 'material', 'What', 'afloat', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'Conan', 'harder-than-it-looks', 'balance', 'likable', 'intelligent', 'relateable', 'also', 'believably', 'savage', 'ruthless', 'times', 'downright', 'terrifying', 'startlingly', '*un*likable', 'degree', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'big', 'screen', 'action-hero', 'characters', 'much', 'dimension', 'often', 'enough', 'understatement', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'story-telling', 'surrounding', 'had', 'much', 'sense', 'Nods/references', 'Howard', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'joy', 'spot', 'have', 'ask', 'same', 'question', 'one', 'often', 'say', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'were', ""n't"", 'built-in', 'fondness', 'what', 'drawing', 'would', 'stand', 'own', 'so', 'well', 'context', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'villains', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'long', 'shot', 'convincingly', 'palpably', 'nasty', 'easy', 'pickin', 'hero/anti-hero', 'Rose', 'McGowen', 'evil', 'sorceress', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'Mmmmmm', 'yeeeesssssss', 'baaaaaaaad', 'girl', 'who', 'baaaaaaaaaaad', 'things', 'like', '>', '*AHEM', '*', 'Anyway', 'action', 'here', 'brutal', 'breathless', 'visceral', 'often', 'jaw-droppingly', 'top', 'supernatural/fantastical', 'elements', 'often', 'play', 'nicely', 'frequently', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'good', 'way', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'how', 'bugf**k', 'bats**t', 'HOLY', 'CRAP', 'DID', 'THEY', 'REALLY', 'JUST', 'FREAKIN', 'DO', 'insane', 'ways', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'favorite', 'bit', 'guard', 'sliding', 'back', 'panel', 'see', 'who', 'there', 'then', 'NOT', 'getting', 'what', 'when', 'door', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'biggest', 'problems', 'may', 'sound', 'weird', 'talking', 'Conan', 'movie', 'while', 'TOO', 'heavy', 'one', 'huge', 'action', 'set-piece', 'Yeah', 'Hyborian', 'Age', 'chaotic', 'primal', 'dangerous', 'tough-as-nails', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'unforgiving', 'world', 'also', 'haunting', 'brooding', 'fantastical', 'bittersweet', 'hypnotically', 'beautiful', 'mystery-shrouded', 'landscape', 'none', 'other', 'best', 'Conan', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'bloody', 'mayhem', 'cinematography', 'spot-on', 'found', 'longing', 'more', 'quiet', 'reflective', 'moments', 'just', 'bask', 'spell']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","I read the original Conan series after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger muscling it up as the titular beefcake hero in multiple films. To my delight Conan was much more verbal and a lot less muscle-bound in Robert E. Howard's fiction. I can only assume that's what the producers were striving for when they decided to remake ""Conan the Barbarian.""In so many ways, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is similar to ""Immortals"": nave but violent young man (Leo Howard as young Conan) witnesses a parents' death (Ron Perlman as Corin), swears to avenge himself on the megalomaniac (Stephen Lang as Khalar Zym) responsible, stumbles across a beautiful yet chaste priestess (Rachenl Nichols as Tamara) who just happens to be the Chosen One that the megalomaniac is hunting, the villain manages to capture an artifact without her help anyway, and then in a final climactic battle the hero duels the madman over some precipice. If that's all there was to ""Conan the Barbarian"" it would be a passable if unremarkable film. But this is Conan the freaking Barbarian we're talking about, so that's not good enough.Things aren't helped by the fact that adult Conan doesn't appear on screen for the first 15 minutes; that Conan has no character development whatsoever (he's more interesting as a child than a man); that most violence seems to be less about slashing and instead clubbing people with swords so that special effects blood appear at random; and cliffs and forest terrain appear completely out of nowhere.""Conan"" does get a few things right. Topless women abound. There's definitely a Lovecraftian feel to the Dweller, but after seeing the villain's men marching in uniform black armor accompanying a ship carried by elephants, it's hard not to make parallels to ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Because Conan never manages to really create a sense of place, it just seems like it ripped off other, better fantasy films.And that's a shame. Jason Momoa does a good job of making Conan more than muscles, although he has those in spades too. His spunky sidekick Tamara stands out in sharp contrast to the other Hyborean women, but she never does anything noteworthy enough to matter. Tamara's the same helpless princess in all the Conan stories, only now she juts out her lip and claims she's ""no man's property."" Of all the characters, the only one of interest is Rose McGowan's Marique, managing to create a sexy/creepy villainess with incestuous undertones. SPOILER THE BARBARIAN: Marique uses her magic on a special effect that seems wasted (sand dwellers aren't the archetypical Conan monster I would have picked) and she suffers an ignominious death that's not worthy of the character, but that's note McGowan's fault.In the end, ""Conan the Barbarian"" bears little resemblance to the books that inspired it.

Stephan Lang as the villain was noteworthy as well. He was rather cliche, but pulled it off well. Computer generated special effects were first rate as well. On the downside was Conan, Jason Momoa, was good in looking the part and in the action scenes, but his acting was worse than Arnold's. Can't they find a muscle bound guy that can act too?  Rachel Nichols as Tamara, his love interest was okay. She just seemed mis-cast. She was too demure and then too vicious. She seemed like a good actress though. The most irritating part of the movie is its logic and poor story line. Overall it is typical in that an evil person wants to rule the world. It was just some scenes were just so foolish.

Unfortunately, not much else is.  Conan (Jason Momoa) is born on the battlefield, cut out of his mother's womb by dad as she lay dying.  As a teen he is forced to watch the execution of his father (Ron Perlman), so of course he is out for revenge.  That's pretty much it.  The head bad guy and wannabe god is played with gusto by Stephen Lang (""Avatar"", TV's ""Terre Nova"").  Lang's more recent tough guy characters are a long way from his role as a milk-toast tabloid reporter in ""Manhunter.""  Of course there is a hottie who Khalar (Lang) is after.  Something about being a pure blood that completes the magical spell to raise his wife from the dead.  Tamara  is played woodenly by Rachel Nichols.  Yes, of course she also is spunky and spars with Conan before they get real friendly.  Still, there is no chemistry between them so we don't really care much.  The best thing about the film other than the ""Topless Wenches"" (so credited at the end) may be an eyebrowless Marique (Rose McGowan), the witchy daughter of Khalar.  She gives even old dad pause.

It is a poorly paced stinker with cheap sets, poor location work, awful continuity, and lingering shots of matte paintings that fail to convince us the generic caves and ruins it takes place in are in fact far-off fantasy cities.All this is more the shame because Jason Momoa is probably the best Conan ever. He seems to have read Howard's description of the character - ""Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet"" - daily as a primer on the role. He looks the part and acts the part, showing neither Schwarzenegger's endearing but inappropriate humor nor the streaks of predictable heroism one might expect. His Conan is a true barbarian, vicious and lawless, but with a calculating intellect his enemies overlook to their own detriment.

Howard's savage world to life, but other than that, the film itself feels oh so empty.  Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) stars as Conan, the Cimmerian warrior seeking vengeance for the destruction of his people at the hands of warlord Khalar Zym (a scene-chewing Stephen Lang), and in turn embarks on a quest to save all of Hyboria as Zym's master plan begins to come to fruition.  Along for the ride are Rose McGowan as Zym's witchy daughter, and hottie Rachel Nichols as the pawn in Zym's plot; granted neither of them have all that much to work with.  In fact, nearly the entire cast of Conan the Barbarian do little to make things memorable, other than Stephen Lang.

This version of Conan follows a different story-line than the original two Schwarzenegger films.  Here, we see an origins story of Conan, from birth to childhood, to his learning how to use and forge a sword, the destruction of his family, and his pursuit of revenge.  All throughout are graphic fight scenes high on blood on low on gore.  The special effects are good, though not original.  The dialogue is plain, enough to get the ideas across but nothing inspirational.  The biggest letdown are the lack of comedy and the boring soundtrack.  The original Conan movies had a steady mix of subtle and overt humor; whether it be the camel spitting on Conan, or Conan knocking himself out on a tree.

For his time, Arnie did a pretty good job embodying the Conan character but I always felt he was too musclebound compared to the way Howard described him. I wasn't even too sure about Jason Momoa until I saw the actual trailer for this film and I realized he did his homework in understanding Howard's Conan. After seeing the film I realized he was the perfect match to play the young barbarian in his new adventures in the Hyborian world. I am not referring at all to the comics because they were a genre unto themselves. I am referring to the orginal, Howard's Conan. For any of us who were fans ofREH prior to the comics and films, this was the definitive source material to reference in this movie. Yes, there are weak spots of story line in the film, but generally I felt I was actually watching the exploits of Conan as Howard had imagined him and I believe REH would have been pleased with the results of this movie. No, you are not going to make every Howard fan happy with this film, we are a diverse lot and very impassioned about our hero and his author. But for me, I felt very happy with the result. I hope the sales of this DVD shyrocket enough to warrant a sequel, because I was so depressed to see so few who actually went to see this movie in the theaters. Jason Momoa, you are truly Conan.

I'm glad they did not remake the original but did a different story.As in 80s Conan The Barbarian and Conan The Destroyer, the villain Khalar Zynn's (Stephen Lang) mission is similar - world domination. To do so, he must find pieces of the mask and use pure blood to activate the powers.Zynn engineers the demise of Conan's father Corin (Ron Pearlman) for one piece of the mask and a young Conan (Leo Howard) vows revenge.This Conan delivers action and gore fast and furious. I thought the most exciting segment was the battle with sandmen. The parts with the snake/octopus creature and the final fight sequence were a little too dark for me to really see what was going on.Ron Pearlman (Hellboy) puts on a memorable performance here as a dad who sacrifices his life. And Rose McGowan (Scream) really did look super evil with all that fingernails (Freddy Krueger!). Her sorceress Marique made Zynn look like Father Christmas. Watch her stick those nails into those poor girls! Speaking of incest, the deviant attempts to seduce her daddy. Funnily enough her make up reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter in Alice In Wonderland.Casting Jason Monoa as Conan was a brave choice as he was a relative unknown then. He certainly has the looks and  killer bod - check out those glutes!The version released in my country clocks in at 108 minutes compared to the 113 minutes version sold here. I'm sure a raunchy love scene between Conan and the pure blood heroine Tamara (Rachel Nichols) was cut. Someone kindly confirm?Extras include cast and crew interviews a B roll footage and a trailer.

Although I'll admit I was mildly disappointed to learn that it was not actually Rachel Nichols performing nude.... still, you can't criticise THAT. I mean, look at that.So we'll give 'Conan 2011' a star for gratuitous shots of female and male buttocks.bing! *And I applaud the director's (Marcus Nispel) decision, knowing that his movie already had a hard R-rating for graphic violence, to show us some of Bulgaria's Most Beautiful Bosoms. Too long have American R-rated movies suffered from a dearth of breasts. I remember a time (the 1980s) when the average movie viewer could reasonably expect an R-rated film to contain at least one gratuitous full frontal shot of Jamie Lee Curtis's or Tanya Roberts' breasts. Then came the travesty that was the 90s, and Jet Li's 'Cradle 2 The Grave' - a god awful R-rated 'action' flick which contains a dance/striptease scene in which THE BARE-TORSOED ACTRESS DOES NOT EVEN TURN AROUND. I should've asked for my money back. For shame, Hollywood.So we'll go right ahead and give 'Conan' another star for its show of appreciation for natural, womanly beauty, and for putting the 'Right On!' back in R.bing! **And for those of you hating on Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) because he's not James Earl Jones, I give you Akhun, portrayed by 6-foot-11, 360lb Australian powerlifter and wrestler Nathan Jones (no relation).It is a proven fact that a giant man who roars his lines, beats his chest in fury, and wields a 'Thorgrim' war-hammer makes any sword and sorcery flick better. Nathan Jones, whose character has lines and who has never gotten his collarbone broken by Cro Cop, gets no billing at all in the main credits; but American MMA guy Bob Sapp, as Ukafa, has no lines at all, yet he gets his name printed on the DVD case AND in the end credits?!?So we'll give 'Conan' another star for Nathan 'RRRRGGHAAAAAGGH!' Jones, to correct this obvious oversight in the movie's credits. IMO, Nathan Jones should appear in every sword n' sorcery and sword n' sandal and Asian martial arts flick, roaring and swinging a ridiculously heavy spiked mace-hammer thing at everybody, because I say so.bing! ***Having said that, I think other reviewers nailed it when they wrote, essentially, 'Take away the name Conan and this movie could be any generic sword and sorcery story.' I don't have much to add to that.In most of Robert E. Howard's stories, the Conan character was almost like Blackbeard without the beard, and (mostly) without the ship. Barbarians and desert tribesmen in Howard's Hyboria followed Conan into battle, not only because Conan's fighting skills impressed them, but because he was their meal-ticket. Conan loved to fight and rarely lost a battle. He loved to steal treasure, to pillage, to captain pirate vessels, and he loved to lead hordes of ravening barbarians and/or howling desert tribesmen against armies of 'civilised' opponents. Conan was mostly amoral, but with his own barbaric code of honour, and he possessed a William Wallace-like charisma with the warrior classes. He spent his gold as fast as he got it, loved the women, loved the booze, loved to party, and it took a twist of fate during a major rebellion (with Conan strangling the despotic King of Aquilonia on his own throne, and seizing the crown by conqueror's right) to finally settle him down to a life of responsibility.Conan was a criminal vagabond, a schemer, a sellsword and a hardcore killer. Howard's primary concept was pretty far from any notions of 'knightly derring-do' or 'noble savagery,' which was part of what made Howard's Conan 'yarns' so much fun: the unpredictability of Conan. Conan wasn't hampered by the laws and taboos of any nation he visited; he did absolutely whatever he could get away with.At its core, 'Conan 2011' is just your basic action movie. Overall, the stuntwork and the fights are well executed, but a lot of the action suffers from a lack of intensity and craziness and 'total battle chaos' that (in my opinion) ought to be the main attraction in any Robert E. Howard adaption. Some of the action here, unfortunately, feels a little too much like Stephen Sommers' remake of 'The Mummy' (1999), fortunately without the latter's corny humour.Then again, I'm not so sure that 'Conan 2011' was given enough of a budget to create those kinds of battle scenes, battles that could've propelled the movie into that Peter Chan's 'Warlords' or 'Braveheart' territory, which is what any Robert E. Howard adaption truly deserves. It definitely should've been budgeted for that, because why would anyone want to go see a movie based on Howard's writing, where the battle action hasn't been budgeted up to the max?Jason Momoa does his competent best, but all in all the storyline is too generic and the script too weak to allow him to be very 'Conan-like.' Credit is definitely due to this unknown actor (I'd never heard of Momoa before this), who pulls off some difficult Hong Kong stuntman style jumps and falls, that I've rarely seen a non-pro wrestling Westerner perform (because you can really get hurt doing such stunts). It's a wonder he didn't seriously injure himself, since he's obviously not wearing any protective gear on his arms and torso.And if they ever decide to make Howard's 'A Witch Shall Be Born' into a movie, I believe Marique (Rose McGowan) could easily step into the role of Salome/Queen Taramis, and nail that character to the wall a la Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue in 'The Two Towers.' Although, sadly, I don't think such a film will ever be made, because of the many weaknesses in 2011's 'Conan the Barbarian.' It's a shame that Howard's writing rarely - if ever - gets the cinematic treatment it fully deserves.Final verdict: file this one under `Remakes - Missed Opportunities' and hurry up, because by the end of the 2010s, you might not find any room to file anything else in there.",3,I have got to stop watching these remakes,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,6475,"['Time', 'when', 'reviewer', 'drank',

Great depth to tell apart objects easily with two eyes, and occasionally, some objects that move outside the screen.Having just reviewed the film a second time, this time on the 3D Blu Ray, the 3D in the 2nd half of the movie, starting with the scene where Conan fights the Sand People, has great 3D depth that does not disappoint. The first half however, lacks enough depth, and takes the 8/10 3D down to a 7/10 3D rating. The first hour of the 1h52m film has very average 3D where you question why you're bothering wearing 3D glasses. You can see some hint of depth, is the best way to put it. But if you're a 3D fan looking for a really good and brutal sword battle movie, buy the 3D version, as it also includes 2D viewing on the same disc, and the 2nd hour of the film has great 3D. Nonetheless, the film itself makes up for the 1st hour's minimal 3D with some thrilling, gory action.3D: 7/10. The 2nd half of the film's 3D looks great. It's like they put all of their post process effort into that point onward. Before that though, mostly average 3D and not enough depth in that first half, which all comes down to the stereographers doing the 3D post processing. Did they have the time, or were they lacking the boldness required to make a scene POP? Or did they learn their lessons from the first half as evidenced by the well done 3D in the 2nd half?Conan the Barbarian 2011 has plenty of bloody combat with swords, sorcery and is well filmed, so you can follow the fights visually without confusion. Conan sets off on his adventure to avenge his father, stop the powerful Leader from gaining the mask of power, rescue the beautiful babe and slaughter anything that stands in his way. If you're looking for a film to enlighten the mind, Conan isn't about that. This film is about adventure and barbaric swordfighting. By the end of the film, I was really impressed with the amount of nearly non stop action here. In the end, a gritty sword adventure showcasing a fearsome, brutal army of enemy warriors for Conan to face, along with Sand People, a Tentacle Creature in the water, and more.Recommended for action, fantasy genre fans who want action before story.",4,3D CONAN Blu Ray Review,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2235,"['3D', 'Conan', '2011', 'Review', 'Buy', 'REVIEW', 'What', 'do', 'expect', '3D', 'Great', 'depth', 'tell', 'apart', 'objects', 'easily', 'two', 'eyes', 'occasionally', 'objects', 'move', 'screen.Having', 'just', 'reviewed', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'time', '3D', 'Blu', 'Ray', '3D', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'starting', 'scene', 'where', 'Conan', 'Sand', 'People', 'great', '3D', 'depth', 'not', 'disappoint', 'first', 'half', 'however', 'enough', 'depth', '8/10', '3D', 'down', '7/10', '3D', 'rating', 'first', 'hour', '1h52m', 'film', 'very', 'average', '3D', 'where', 'question', 'why', ""'re"", 'bothering', 'wearing', '3D', 'glasses', 'can', 'see', 'hint', 'depth', 'best', 'way', 'put', ""'re"", '3D', 'fan', 'looking', 'really', 'good', 'brutal', 'sword', 'battle', 'movie', 'buy', '3D', 'version', 'also', '2D', 'viewing', 'same', 'disc', '2nd', 'hour', 'film', 'great', '3D', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'up', '1st', 'hour', 'minimal', '3D', 'thrilling', 'gory', 'action.3D', '7/10', '2nd', 'half', 'film', '3D', 'great', 'put', 'post', 'process', 'effort', 'point', 'onward', 'though', 'mostly', 'average', '3D', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'first', 'half', 'down', 'stereographers', 'doing', '3D', 'post', 'processing', 'Did', 'have', 'time', 'were', 'lacking', 'boldness', 'required', 'make', 'scene', 'POP', 'did', 'learn', 'lessons', 'first', 'half', 'evidenced', 'well', 'done', '3D', '2nd', 'half', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', '2011', 'plenty', 'bloody', 'combat', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'well', 'filmed', 'can', 'follow', 'fights', 'visually', 'confusion', 'Conan', 'off', 'adventure', 'avenge', 'father', 'stop', 'powerful', 'Leader', 'gaining', 'mask', 'power', 'beautiful', 'babe', 'slaughter', 'anything', 'way', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'enlighten', 'mind', 'Conan', ""n't"", 'film', 'adventure', 'barbaric', 'swordfighting', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'amount', 'nearly', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'here', 'end', 'gritty', 'sword', 'adventure', 'showcasing', 'fearsome', 'brutal', 'army', 'enemy', 'warriors', 'Conan', 'face', 'Sand', 'People', 'Tentacle', 'Creature', 'water', 'more.Recommended', 'action', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'action', 'story']",N/A
1400799,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B004EPYZT4,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[1, 1]","First, this film is terrible. Second, if you love Conan, you should see it, in part because it genuinely leaves a more favorable impression of the original films, in part because it will allow you to see what a truly horrible script can do to good actors and, in part, because anyone who loves Conan will at least enjoy the action in this unfortunate endeavor. The lead, Jason Momoa, as see in Stargate Atlantis and Game of Thrones is actually quite a decent actor (and getting better with each larger part he plays). Rachel Nichols, of Continuum and The Inside, is very good, having also started out as simply acceptable and improving steadily over the course of her career. There was no reason to think that these two actors, as their abilities stood when filming began, would deliver anything less than a fantastic fantasy film for fan consumption. And, yet, this film disappointed on nearly every level. With the exception of some excellent action sequences, the story was loose and uninspired, the villain was practically a tragedy (played, again, by an actor of greater talent than the role could make use of), the oddity of manufactured romance was uncomfortable and even unlikable in moments of unnecessarily awkward dialogue, and, of course, there was one last great failing that, I think, deserves its very own paragraph.Conan should be street smart, fighting smart, big and strong, but he should also be stupid, book dumb, not much for the mathematics, bordering on illiterate, and then some.In the books, as wonderful as they are, Conan is smart, witty, as sort of odd combination of personality traits exist within his hero's persona, and it works because we accept it. But there was a reason Dino De Laurentiis opted for the direction of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 film of the same name, not as a learned man of the caliber of the character of Kalidor in Red Sonja but, rather, as a near moron in his weakest moments. What makes a dumb Conan, of such a young age, lovable and relatable is that he doesn't have too many gifts. We don't find it odd that he is so very strong and so very witty and so very cunning and so very capable and so very good at not losing a fight. We find him real. In truth, it was difficult for the world to accept that Schwarzenegger himself is actually a bright man because it seems impossible that someone could have so much of so many different desirable qualities. Momoa is also a bright young man but this brightness, which served him so well in playing other characters, was a detriment in this film as the producers actually made note of his own personal characteristics when envisioning their version of Conan. They saw that he was smart and, suddenly, Conan, as written, as a smart man, witty, charming, no one's fool, became an actual honest to goodness possibility. This would have been fine if Conan was an old man, having lived an old man's life and learned an old man's lessons, but Momoa is a young man and so is Conan, far too young to be so crafty. And so, we all missed out on what could have been a wonderful series of multiple films staring a solid and always enjoyable actor who is young enough to give to the genre a series worthy of our time and fandom because mistakes were made too early in the game to be fixed in post. Instead of that series that will never be, we have this one and only film, and it is terrible. If you think Momoa was to blame, watch Game of Thrones season one. If you blame Nichols, watch Continuum season one. If you blame McGowan, pick up a movie, pretty much anything she's done in the last ten years (other than this). If you do, hopefully you will see what I see, that they couldn't help what this became. The script was poor. The director was lost in the minutia of the action and special effects sequences and missed out on even beginning to craft what we all wanted to see, the big picture, the big story, the thing that makes us watch again and again, even so many decades after we saw it for the very first time. All that concern over story and moments shared between actors that make a film, filling in the cracks and pulling the audience in, all the drama and excitement and, of course, an opponent that doesn't so border on the ridiculous as to render the telling of the story (such as it is) pointless, all of that brilliant concern that we get from the men and women we call great writers and directors was simply lacking here. I don't imagine the production team on this one will make the same mistakes twice and it is just our loss that they made them with this film and not with something no one cared about.If you are a Conan fan, it is worth the suffering to place it into the dark of your mind, in the catalogue, for comparison sake. If you are not a lover of the books or the other films, you are better off not wasting your time.

Drew ""Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","[15, 27]","Top 10 check list for a lousy Conan Movie....1) Find the most monotone, uninspiring narrator possible for voice-over (Morgan Freeman)2) Cast Conan as a gym drop-out, muscle-less B-list actor3) Cast Ron Perelman in any role4) Ignore everything Robert E. Howard ever wrote about Conan5) Only use Frazetta inspired imagery for the baddies6) Create a truly bland, forgettable score7) Pay as little as possible for props - buy plastic swords, knives and costumes on closeout from a Halloween store8) All wood must be rotten, so head-butts or stomps will shatter any plank, spindle or board9) The only power a ""new"" god has is the power to scream like a woman10) Those who are evil, will in the end, forget how to fight, get clumsy and chicken outAnd that's just the start.  The only thing this mess had to do with Conan was that they called one of the characters by that name. They could have cast Conan O'Brien as Conan and it would not have been worse. It would have sold more tickets, though.I like Morgan Freeman - in the appropriate place. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" ""March of the Penguins"" ""Conan the Barbarian"" - which movie does not belong in that list?Look, Cimmeria is supposed to be a rugged land of warriors - not some lame 2nd rate vacation re-enactment spot.  ""300"" had it right - send the kids out, see who survives. In this waste of time? Have the kids run around a hill with a small egg in their mouth. Whomever returns with the unbroken egg, wins.  What's next? Run down the hill with a cup of beer and see who spills the least?!? Then there's Conan's birth.  Anyone else notice that this was in the middle of a raging (albeit very lame) battle - and during the birth, everyone vanished - maybe it was lunch time.Perlman's lack of muscle and tone was distracting - I mean, this is a Cimmerian warrior?!? Jason Momoa would not have placed in the top 20 at any fitness or bodybuilding show. No muscles to speak of - not even a six-pack. This is the ""massive"" warrior who ""towered"" over everyone in his tribe, even as a youth. Yet here, Conan is the runt of the tribe. When he returns to his village with his collection of gory trophies, the men and women seem ready to faint. Huh? These are seasoned, blood-thirsty WARRIORS, remember? The tribe should have been more like the warriors from ""300"" - all ready to kick butt, not pass out at the first sign of blood.The battles were pathetic - the choreography was terrible. Watch the slave drivers use the whip - they have no idea how to us it! Or the scene where Conan ""frees"" the slaves. He rolls boulders down a hill, indiscriminately - yet only the slavers (and a cart of lettuce and some oranges) gets nailed!  When the topless women  slaves ask what's to become of them, it's basically servitude to Conan and his army (of which we ever only see three or four people) - and everyone cheers! I should note that the topless women are played by the least animated women ever to ""grace"" the screen - who thought bouncing C's and D's could be this uninspiring? Or un-interesting. They needed lessons from Russ Meyer.Watch when the freed slaves have to retrieve the key - look at the blades. Blunt and plastic! The bone mask? OK, it was broken with a simple sword blow.  Everyone knows it should never be reassembled.  Why not just destroy the fragments? Toss them in a volcano, crush them, and so on - keep them in ornate boxes under a floorboard?! (and did you notice how generations later the boards looked the same and there was no dust on the box?!) When it is complete - nothing. No effects - audio or visual. Did it look to you like they simply forgot to add the effects there? Oh yea, the DVD / BlueRay cover? Photoshop. Totally touched up. The movie slogan ""Born on the battlefield"" - how lame is that?One of the paragraphs from a Conan book still sticks in my mind. Conan returned to his homeland after years of adventures.  Hey lays on the frozen, snow covered ground to sleep, half naked.  Conan bunches up some ice and snow to rest his head on.  One Cimmerian warrior remarks - to paraphrase - ""He has become soft - look - Conan needs a pillow to rest his head on!""  Does this sound like the wimps that infest this movie?Conan is constantly out of breath, panting after a run uphill. When he has to scale a wall, it's look for the easy way or stairs. In the novels, Conan is spidey-like in his ability to scale walls, cliff faces, craggy fortress walls - you name it. Here, he looks for the stairs.

However it's not the original and one should not expect it to be. Jason Mamoa is not Arnold and doesn't have the command screen presence. It's &#34;prettier&#34; than the original but also more CGI effects ridden and the added story of not only avenging his father but saving the royal blood line. Lots of the movie is &#34;dark&#34; and not in the sense of story, but in cinematography as even on dark days, lights off, large screen (39&#34;) some is difficult to see, especially if there is any glare from anywhere. I purchased this as saw it on broadcast TV, but with all the commercials, just couldn't watch it, so ordered it used on Amazon. Glad I did, as if I had paid regular theater price I would have been disappointed but &#34;used like new&#34; was worth it. Normally I watch the movies I ordered several times over as they sound good as well as look good. This has a nice &#34;clear&#34; look to it, and sounds &#34;acceptable&#34; when you're moving around the house (not over blaring) but not sure it's going to be one of those I watch several times over.

1400820,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B004EPYZT4,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[2, 2]","I like the original Arnold Schwarzennegger's ""Conan the Barbarian"" better because the original had a simpler story, which is easier to follow, and it even possessed a pleasant level of humor where even just a little bad acting adds to the humor of the original film.Jason Momoa was a pretty good casting for the role of Conan, but I think he was just too much of a ""pretty boy"" for this role.  He would have been better placed in the 1984 film of ""Conan the Destroyer"" which, to me, plays more like a campy soft porn fantasy, but without any actual porn. ""Conan the Destroyer"" was just a bunch of pansy acting and was a truly unworthy sequel to the original. I'm sure even Arnold regrets that film too.Plus, I really appreciated what Sandahl Bergman as Valeria brought to the screen of the original 1982 version.  I wasn't too impressed with Rachel Nichols as Tamara in this new film.  She's OK, but she's no where's near as attractive or as ""exciting"" on the big screen as Sandahl Bergman was. She was a ""goddess"" to me in the original film.Even the scene with the Witch portrayed by Cassandra Gava added a bit of sexy campiness to the original 1982 film.Plus, the original 1982 version of Conan had the powerful presence of James Earl Jones, and the dry wit, but mystical and mysterious performance of Mako as the Wizard.  All the characters in the original film showed powerful performances, but yet it was all a simplified enjoyable Saturday matinee experience. This new version had too many screen consuming added effects which makes all of the film seem to have too much irrelevance only to make the visuals more aggressive for the eyes. I like cool visuals, but I still want a simpler story to follow.I'd watch this film again, sooner than I would watch Schwarzenegger's 1984 film ""Conan the Destroyer"", but as a film to own, I wouldn't watch either one ever again, so I wouldn't buy it either.

1400848,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B004EPYZT4,The Man With No Name,"[3, 4]","I just watched this on the Epix Movie Channel in HD.  I was really looking forward to seeing this as I missed it at the theaters and on DVD release.  As I sat down with my dinner and flipped the channel on I had high hopes that once again I would be transported to Hyboria.Well...I wasn't.  I'm not sure where I was transported to, but it wasn't Hyboria.  Let me say first off that the Arnold incarnation of Conan was not perfect either, but it was still loved and rewatched numerous times by us action lovers.  It, dispite it flaws, was a GOOD movie and had the perfect lead.  This new 2011 'Conan' is not a rewatch.--Story--**(Some Spoilers)**The movie begins by showing an ancient group of Necromancers doing some sort of occult ritual.  The flaw in the scene is that you see nothing happening.  There is a mask, (which is the MAIN plot point in the film), that these Necromancers made that was supposed to grant GREAT power to the wearer.  Well...the Necromancers are defeated by the barbarian tribes and the mask broken up into little pieces and spread amoung the tribal heads for safe-keeping.This is flaw one.  If this mask is so evil, they should have just beat the @#$& out of it and turned it into dust.  Why allow the possibility of it being used again in the future???The movie flashes ahead to little Conan, still an infant inside his mother.  We see a sword get thrush into his mother and just miss the baby.  Conan's father (Ron Pearlman) cuts Conan out and let's the mother see the infant before dying.  This scene is extremely unrealistic.  But this violant birth on a battle field gives Conan the title/statis of ""Battle Born.""  This is alluded to as one reason he is so well equipped at fighting.As mentioned earlier the main focus of this film is the Necronmancer Mask.  I guess the mask allows the user to bring back the dead.  That's all the villan Khalar Zym, (Stephen Lang, the bad guy from 'Avatar'), talks about the whole film.  It is his desire to resurrect his witch-wife and have her use her increased powers to inslave the world for him.  His wife was burned at the stake, shown in a flash back scene.Khalar Zym destroys Conan's village, kills Conan's father (or at least sets him up to die...) and leaves Conan furious, and this sets him on his bloody path.This is flaw two.  Arnold's Conan was shown at various stages in his life.  Once he was grown, we witness him as a slave on the Mill of Agony, as a gladiator, once he is set free he discovers the cave of Grom and gets that cool sword.  Then he's a thief for a while before being hired by a king to rescue the kingdom's princess from James Earl Jones.  My point is we see Conan doing a lot of things, just like in the books.Unfortunately we just go from child Conan to Jason Momoa.  No scenes of his struggles or escapades.  We are just thrust to the future and see him freeing slaves.  No backstory what-so-ever.  Thus the viewer doesn't really grow attached to the character, nor do we really care about him in the film...ever.Conan later on rescues a red-haired woman, (Scarlet from 'G. I. Joe'), and spends the rest of the movie saving/protecting her.  For some reason her blood is important.  As this is all Rose McGowan talks about endlessly...I won't give anymore plot points away.  This is the jist of the movie.  Nothing too deep or interesting.--Character Choices--Jason Momoa as Conan was wrong for one reason.  He's not big enough.  You can't go from an Austrian body-builder to a surfer.  Granted he did bulk up for this film, he still lacked the physique of a Cimmerian warrior, in my opinion.  In Momoa's defense, it is evident that he gave this movie 100 percent.  It still though wasn't enough.  The film not being stellar is also not ALL his fault.  Bad writing, bad casting decisions, THEN Momoa are what took this film down.  Momoa was GREAT in 'Stargate: Atlantis', but not great as Conan.  I personally think he had TOO much dialogue.  Arnold's character did not speak much in the first film, and I think it was a PLUS for the character.  Conan does not strike me as chatty.  Momoa's Conan was too chatty.  This was probably again though due to BAD WRITING.Stephen Lang while a great villian in 'Avatar', does not deliver in this.  He looked too old, and had a WAY too close relationship with his daughter.  Any minute I thought they were going to get it on, and I would puke.  He is ruthless in the film, having a TONS of people slaughtered whenever he feels the urge.  He has no reason for killing in my opinion, it's always for this stupid mask or something related to it.  FYI, when he finally does get the mask ensembled and puts the ""pure blood"" in it, all that happens is that is wriggles around like a starfish.  He puts it on his face and it wraps itself around making a helmet.  That's it.Rose McGowan, while good as Cherry from 'Planet Terror', was not good as Khalar Zym's witch daughter.  She played a witch on 'Charmed', and must have been good, as the show was on FOREVER.  However in 'Conan' she never displays any powers.  She does once make some dust people that Conan fights for 5 minutes.  Other than that, besides sniffing all the time for the ""pure blood"" like Wolverine, she demonstrates no witch powers.  She looks out of place in the film, and does not pull off the look of a Hyborian Witch.  Plus her scenes where she is coming on to her father are pretty gross.I couldn't tell you much about the rest of the characters, as I said you never get attached to anyone in the film.  Ron Pearlman is in the movie, and does an OKAY job as Conan's father.  The red haired woman who played Scarlet in 'G. I. Joe' is the woman Conan is always protecting.  She does not add anything to movie acting wise.  The french guy from 'G. I. Joe' is here also, he's the guy with an eye patch, the thief who helps Conan.  He's actually pretty good.--Wrapping up--Bad casting choices and terrible writing killed this film.  If you were one of the few who LOVED this movie, don't expect a sequel.  This movie is evidence that sometimes a franchise is better left alone.  Revisiting a movie franchise with new actors and writers usually doesn't equal success.  Will the new 'Total Recall' be a disaster???  Time will tell, one things for certain, the original wasn't broken in any way.  Why do we need a remake???Well, that's my 2 cents worth and opinions on this new 'Conan'.  Is is worth buying, NO.  Watch it on tv, it will be on FX really soon I'm sure...",3,I Miss The Days Of Arnold...,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,6470,"['just', 'watched', 'Epix', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'HD', 'was', 'really',

In this film we get a significant childhood view of Conan as a person who has more heart than brains. After his village is destroyed and his father killed, Conan wanders the earth to find the man and seek revenge.He comes to a town involved in slave trade, kills the traders and frees the topless women in a cage. Later soldiers show up and Conan deliberately gets himself arrested so he can get inside of the prison camp to get information. Of course armed guards are no match for a chained Conan.Conan is a barbarian, a Viking type. Another tribe appears to mimic Native Americans with Mohawks and another of the 12 tribes mimics Mongolian. The problem with Conan, the Barbarian is that he speaks as a barbarian with bad lines and a bad delivery. The CG specials effects make this a better film.

1400861,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004EPYZT4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","The character of Conan the Barbarian needs no new introduction. Most people know a few things about the pop culture icon Robert E. Howard created, which Arnold Schwarzenegger played in the 1982 film adaptation. In the 2011 ""reboot"" of the Conan franchise Jason Momoa plays Conan the Cimmerian seeking for revenge, being the sole survivor of the massacre by Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), a cold-blooded warlord.The film starts out promisingly, but it then goes downhill, descending into a sort of randomly assorted action set-pieces. The story often feels rushed, jumping from one action set-piece to another, without telling us much about the characters we are supposed to care. Jason Momoa looks perfect as a sword-wielding hero, but what he does soon becomes repetitious. Rachel Nichols (a 2009 film ""Star Trek"") plays Tamara, a character that always looks bored. In fact, Rose McGowan's character, an evil sorceress with a Goth makeup, was much more interesting with knowingly campy overacting.The film's action is certainly gory and visceral, with the stunt that in itself is decent, but ""Conan the Barbarian"" lacks creativity and imagination. The hectic editing that hardly lets us know what is going on does not help.It seems Marcus Nispel, who began his career as a film director with the 2003 version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" is specializing in remaking.

Yet, his father Corin (Ron Perlman) believes his son is too violent and not prepared to wield a proper sword. When their village is attacked by the evil Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), Conan is left as the only survivor. Zym is intent on using the mystical Mask of Acheron to resurrect his dead wife and rule all of Hyborea as a demi-god. Years later, the adult Conan (Jason Momoa) has traveled around the world and had many adventures, yet he still hasn't found the men responsible for his father's death and the destruction of his village. A chance encounter with a master thief called Ela-Shan (Said Taghmaoui) leads Conan to a trail that will bring him face to face with those responsible for his father's death. Along the way he meets a female monk named Tamara (Rachel Nicholas) and rescues her from Zym's invading army. She falls in love with Conan and Conan, well, he's just too much of a man for one woman. Zym needs Tamara's blood because she's the last of a line of pureblood's responsible for the original destruction of the Mask of Acheron. It's a game of cat and mouse with the possible fate of all of Hyborea on the line.I had been looking forward to watching CONAN THE BARBARIAN. It has been years since I saw the 1982 version with Arnold Schwarzenegger, so when I saw the previews for this version, I thought it would be a decent reboot. The movie has some great visual effects and set designs and the cinematography isn't bad. You really get the sense that this is the world of Hyborea that Robert E. Howard wrote about and not just some desert. The visuals are the best thing about the movie.The acting in the movie is flat. There's just no life to the characters. Jason Momoa tries, but he's really not given much terms of dialogue. Schwarzenegger didn't have a ton to say in the 1982 movie, but I think he had better dialogue than Momoa's Conan does. Not only that, but Arnold's Conan had a ton more personality than Momoa's version. Stephen Lang has the best role as the villain Zym. In fact, he's about the only character in the whole movie that has any life to him whatsoever. There's lots of blood and some nudity, but it doesn't mean anything because the story is so lackluster and the characters are so lifeless.The movie isn't a complete waste, but it could have been so much more. In short, if you are a fan of Howard's novels or the character of Conan, you will probably want to watch the movie. Action fans will probably be split on whether they like it or not. Though I didn't think it was terrible, I actually prefer the 1982 version.",2,"Great Visuals, But Lackluster Script and Lifeless Characters. 2 1/2 Stars",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,2671,"['Born', 'battlefield', 'dying', 'mother', 'young', 'Conan', 'Leo', 'Howard', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'even', 'boy', 'father', 'Corin', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'son', 'too', 'violent', 'not', 'prepared', 'wield', 'proper', 'sword', 'When', 'village', 'attacked', 'evil', 'Khalar', 'Zym', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Conan', 'left', 'only', 'survivor', 'Zym', 'intent', 'using', 'mystical', 'Mask', 'Acheron', 'resurrect', 'dead', 'wife', 'rule', 'Hyborea', 'demi-god', 'Years', 'later', 'adult', 'Conan', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'traveled', 'world', 'had', 'many', 'adventures', 'yet', 'still', ""n't"", 'found', 'men', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'destruction', 'village', 'chance', 'encounter', 'master', 'thief', 'called', 'Ela-Shan', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'Conan', 'trail', 'will', 'bring', 'face', 'face', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'way', 'female', 'monk', 'named', 'Tamara', 'Rachel', 'Nicholas', 'Zym', 'invading', 'army', 'love', 'Conan', 'Conan', 'well', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'man', 'one', 'woman', 'Zym', 'Tamara', 'blood', 'last', 'line', 'pureblood', 'responsible', 'original', 'destruction', 'Mask', 'Acheron', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'possible', 'fate', 'Hyborea', 'line.I', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'CONAN', 'THE', 'BARBARIAN', 'been', 'years', 'saw', '1982', 'version', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'version', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'decent', 'reboot', 'movie', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'set', 'designs', 'cinematography', ""n't"", 'bad', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'world', 'Hyborea', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'wrote', 'about', 'not', 'just', 'desert', 'visuals', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'flat', 'just', 'life', 'characters', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'tries', 'really', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'Schwarzenegger', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ton', 'say', '1982', 'movie', 'think', 'had', 'better', 'dialogue', 'Momoa', 'Conan', 'Not', 'only', 'Arnold', 'Conan', 'had', 'ton', 'more', 'personality', 'Momoa', 'version', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'best', 'role', 'villain', 'Zym', 'fact', 'only', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'life', 'whatsoever', 'lots', 'blood', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'story', 'so', 'lackluster', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lifeless.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'short', 'are', 'fan', 'Howard', 'novels', 'character', 'Conan', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'Action', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'split', 'like', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'terrible', 'actually', 'prefer', '1982', 'version']",N/A
1400863,A1JNKGC3C6OVGQ,B004EPYZT4,"Ujjwal Dey ""2write""","[1, 3]","Conan the Barbarian (2011)I didn't watch this in the cinemas because I was not at all impressed with the previews and trailers. Watched it in regular DVD today. I actually liked it. There is good reason why.This one has no connection nor shared mythology with the wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the 80s - this one is a good followup though it failed to reboot the franchise at the box office. It is a good pulp action movie. Everything you would expect from a costume-sword-sorcery-legend. I didn't like the first few minutes with the narration, they should have worked it into the plot. But I guess if they did that, they would have to make long drawn out boring trilogy like The Lord of the Rings which is still not as worse as the boring snoozefest written by Tolkien. But after that brief narration, when this movie starts, it starts in amazing style and drama. You have to watch it to realise it.This is an engaging remake of the original Conan the Barbarian movies. Much better production of course, thanks to improvement in technology and design. I don't understand the criticisms of this movie. Sure, it is a predictable pulp fiction plot. But that is why I am watching it, no? A real pulp no-holds-barred thrill.The pace is good. The story doesn't rush forward. It unfolds its plot well. The action is on a grand scale. Real war. Million times better than watching a bunch of dwarf kids running around with a magical ring in Middle Earth. Conan rises. He is the prodigal son born out of war and death. His father raises him under due discipline. But Conan has wild barbarian blood in him. The child actor playing the young Conan, Leo Howard is brilliant. He does a good job showing the cold-blooded brutality and harsh reality of a savage world of an ancient era. The man playing his father is also a very good character actor here. The son grows up alone and he seeks revenge. He slays and pillages and loots. He has comrades. But the man he seeks, he shall fight him alone. This raw energy is well portrayed by the actor Jason Momoa. He is a fresh change from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course the image of Arnold as Conan the Barbarian shall be imprinted on our minds forever. But see this movie as a new one, a fresh narration. Actor Jason Momoa is an athletic, intelligent and impressive man, not the bulging angry hulk that Arnold portrayed. Jason Momoa is also quite handsome and delivers his lines well with good amount of emotion and strength in his voice. That dialogue delivery alone takes him up a few notches to match up with the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a more realistic depiction of an ancient warrior.During the making of the Arnold version of Conan, many scenes were cut on the editing table because of graphic violence. This 2011 version doesn't suffer that fate. Here the savagery is naked and startling. But the Arnold version was true to the sword and sorcery genre. This 2011 remake is more mainstream and seeks more ""realistic"" depiction of ancient warfare, chaos and belief systems. I like both. I can't pick one over the other. Both as they stand alone are beautifully made and well directed. The 2011 version is in epic proportions, a lot more money having been spent on making this one. The cinematography and lighting is very complimentary to the storyline as it progresses.Jason Momoa is a great find. I haven't seen any other movies of his. I would like to. I hope his career isn't affected by the boxoffice results of this Conan adventure. He has great potential as an action hero in any type of movie, period or modern. His talent shines here and carries the movie on his broad scarred shoulders as he rampages against an evil warlord. He is one good reason to go watch this movie. The other is the costumes. It is not overdone like in Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings. Here the costume doesn't steal the limelight and attention from the actors playing their vicious roles. In Conan 2011, the costumes blend in and become an essential accessory of the storyline. We don't get distracted. It just makes everything more real.The franchise has a real chance of surviving. It needs better brand management among other things. Such as a whole new storyline, updating the ancient Robert E. Howard texts by making it more attractive to modern day sword-sorcery-fantasy fans. This would mean a real reboot of the series. There is so much that can be done. I hope a serious director takes up this project in the near future and rebuilds it as it deserves to.The sets and location of Conan 2011 is spectacular. It overshadows any compliment you could give to the 1982 movie. The climax especially is in epic proportions and righly so. Lot of good work has gone into this movie and this is apparent as it progresses through the second half.Among other memorable characters, there is a real talent in the actress playing the evil daughter-witch - Rose McGowan. She exudes evil and she lives it in the role of Marique. Stunning! The other villains also steal the show. They are more memorable than say Conan's allies such as his pirate-friend or the master-thief. Stephen Lang does justice to his role as a warlord. He is not overtly evil. He is patient and wise and calculating. Well portrayed to bring a worthy adversary to Conan. And of course there is the incredibly recognisable and impressive narrative voice of Morgan Freeman retelling the legend of Conan.Actually, the movie needed better marketing effort. I now wish I had seen this on the big silver screen in 3D as it was meant to be. Never mind! Watch it, you won't be disappointed - it is a entertainer and awe-inspiring effort too. I am giving this 5 stars. The Oscar winners don't know what fun they are missing!Those who are complaining about this movie saying it is a travesty or saying that they liked the 1982 film but this one is horrible - you know, these are the same people who would have given bad reviews to the 1982 film if we were living in 1982. But now, they call that a great movie and call this poor. LOL.",5,See it to believe it.

1400869,A2S2QOH5JERUV7,B004EPYZT4,William,"[0, 0]","This remake of Conan the Barbarian hasn't gotten much respect from fans.  But I think it's as true to the spirit of Conan as the version from way back in 1982, even if it falls a little short of that movie's epic feel.  The sorcery was always a problem for these kinds of movies back in the 80s, and while I generally feel like CGI is overused in todays action films, in this movie it is used well.

Let's start off with the main issues this movie had.1.) Editing was just awful, supposedly there's this huge world that Conan is supposed to travel, yet he seems to arrive at each location in a manner of seconds.2.) Conan was very one dimensional. Sure he was shown as being a bit more creative in fighting his opponents and made him into more of a rogue, cheater, stealthy guy. But his motives and personality were very one note and not interesting at all.3.) Let's talk about the editing again, IT SUCKED! It made the action sequences very boring and generic.4.)

1400875,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004EPYZT4,Wuchak,"[229, 273]","Since this 2011 film is a remake/reboot of the '82 version ofConan the BarbarianI'll draw comparisons throughout this review.Although the film's set-up is the same as the '82 version -- raiders destroy Conan's Cimmerian village and thus the barbarian seeks revenge -- the ensuing story is completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, once they attain the needed pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic (or something to this effect).WHAT WORKS:- Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent. Far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan.- The Bulgarian locations are outstanding.- The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth.- Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.- Brutal, thrilling action throughout.- Convincing swordplay.- Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie.- Excellent sets/props. It definitely looks like the Hyborian Age.- Good serious vibe, despite the cartooney, over-the-top last act.- Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy.- Ron Perlman as Conan's father is outstanding.- The whole opening sequence.- I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence.- You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:- Deviated from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like ""A Witch Shall be Born"" or ""Beyond the Black River.""- Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too cliched and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique.- Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria.- The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and ""Conan The Destroyer."" This score defintely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' score?- Too much ""Modern Blockbuster Syndrome"" that appeals to those with ADHD.- Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's ""Jewels of Gwahlur,"" so maybe it's not so far off the mark.- The 3D format was interesting but unnecessary. Why do theaters burden films with this needless expense?- The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film.- Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but -- again -- it needed more.The film runs 113 minutes.THE DVD: I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie slightly more on non-3D DVD. Need I point out that the cover of the DVD is Conan to a 't'? The extras include a director's commentary (Marcus Nispel), a commentary with Momoa and McGowan, a 12-minute feature on REH, a slightly longer one on the character of Conan, and a couple of features on the action scenes.CONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its ""blockbuster"" mediocrity. It's violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just cartooney overkill. Here's hoping that there will be a future Director's Cut DVD with important character-defining moments that were needlessly cut for the theatrical release (""Daredevil (Director's Cut)"" comes to mind).UPDATE: I just finished my third viewing of the movie and, I have to say, I was entertained from beginning to end. Isn't this the most important factor when viewing a movie, particularly an action-adventure one? Yes, it lacks the epic-ness and magic of the '82 version; and its focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness, but it's still a very worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal, and -- thankfully -- lacks ""cute"" characters. It's certainly better than ""Conan the Destroyer"" and leagues better than ""Red Sonja"" and (rolling my eyes) ""Kull the Conqueror.""GRADE: Visually and action-wise, this is a Grade A adaption of Conan all the way, but storywise I'd give it a C+ or B-, even though it has a couple glimpses of greatness.

How do you have good special effects, good looking actors and still manage to mess up a plot so badly? The Conan books are full of GREAT stories and any one of them would have made a better plot than this drivel. It wasn't original. The acting was terrible and there were SO many stupid holes in the plot it was laughable.Even the beginning was dumb....His mother is dressed as a warrior, looks like a model and is PREGNANT and supposedly in labor as she is fighting this war. Somehow, it goes wrong and Conan gets sliced OUT of his mother becoming a ""war born"" baby. Seriously? I was laughing from this point on. How could anyone even let an opening scene like this be put into a movie? The acting was so bad, college drama students could have done a better job acting these parts. The war scene, the blood and the emotions all seemed 100% FAKE in the opening scene. How is this any way to start a movie? Were they trying to win over the moms and female fans with this beginning? Obviously not! As a woman I found this not quite offensive...just unrealistic and annoying. Did we REALLY need that scene in there? I don't remember anything about Conan being ""war born"" in any of the books or other movies. Why make it a CONAN story when it's a totally different character with a different background from the original guy?Now lets move on to Conan. Okay...the guy is good looking. But even Arnold in the 80's could deliver a line and had more charisma than this guy. He has no personality as Conan and doesn't have the right personality for the part. He comes off as a pretty boy and it's hard to believe this guy is supposed to be tough and ""war born"" when he looks like he should be an underwear model.Then, we have the female lead...The VIRGIN! Oh, how original! NOT! This plot detail is this is totally lame and she looks way too OLD to be a convincing virgin. Shouldn't they have made her look 18-21? This woman looks 30. Who even cares anyway if she has ever had sex or not? When we get to the love scene, that is cheesy and unrealistic too. This plot idea was so predictable and dumb by this point you already know exactly how this is going to end...Badly...This is such a clich&eacute; idea I can't believe they would even put this in a movie in the year 2011. This seems more like a plot from 1950 or 1960. There was nothing original in this storyline and the women playing ""the virgin"" was not even that good of an actress or that good looking. Could they not have found someone with talent? A good action movie with a good plot does not need a cheap sex scene or clich&eacute; ""virgin"" priestess...but this movie isn't good so maybe they thought they needed this in there.Finally, we have Rose McGowan. I actually LIKE her acting but there was no way of her saving this movie. She did the role of the ""bad"" character well but it was obvious this was very beneath her ability. She almost seemed to be cringing on some of the lines she had to say and it showed. They also put some VERY weird looking prostatic pushed back ""hairline"" on her forehead that makes her look like an 80 year old man with a balding mullet. She is WAY better looking than the dumb ""virgin"" character yet they manage to make her look awful.Someone probably thought Rose's ""alien forehead"" was a cool costume idea...It wasn't, at ALL! When you see it on the big screen in a movie theatre like I did you CONSTANTLY have to endure long, focused shots of this awful, fake looking rubber forehead with bad makeup all over it and a weird hairline. So the ONE person in the movie that was nice to look at, fit the part somewhat and could ACT, they ruined the role by making her weird forehead the focus of almost the whole movie. Pretty soon I wasn't even paying attention to the plot, I was just looking at HER FOREHEAD the whole time wondering why any director would put something so fake and low-budget looking into a movie like this. Rose is gorgeous. Why not cash in on that and make her a PRETTY evil character? Were they afraid she would outshine and out-act the ""virgin"" character? Honestly, she should have been the lead not the other actress.So my advice: Don't bother with this movie unless you are watching it as a comedy. It has some okay action but the lame plot and poor acting totally kill the movie. Even from the opening scene, I knew it was going to suck! When Hollywood makes a remake or ""reboot"" movie as I call it, they really need to make it BETTER than the original. Even with all the amazing effects we have today, the 80's Conan movies are still MUCH more entertaining than this dreck. So just like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, they had to totally mess up what could have been a really cool remake. This movie seemed very poorly thought out when it came to plot, costumes, acting and originality. Most of all it just seems badly directed and carelessly thrown together like someone just to make money and not a genuinely great movie!",1,"Call this movie ""Rose Mcgowen's forehead"" and just be
