1373372,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B003Y5H5B0,Adam Gagnon,"[0, 0]","From my site [...]Based on the 1987 TV show that launched Johnny Depp this self aware comedy was one of the freshest movies of 2012. Channing Tatum really showing off his comedic chops and Jonah Hill&#8217;s own brand of comedy worked so well together that 21 Jump Street was absolutely the funniest movie of 2012.Despite a rocky personal history Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) bond in policy academy and become fast friends. After graduating from the academy, being sub-par cops land the two in a strange undercover program that puts cops into local high schools. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) does a great job of setting up the concept of the movie while at the same time berating Schmidt, Jenko, the plot of the movie itself, and the overall lack of creativity in recent Hollywood projects. &#8220;We&#8217;re reviving a canceled undercover project from the &#8217;80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they&#8217;ve run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle s*** from the past and hope that nobody will notice.&#8221; Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is the man in charge of running Jump Street. He was the first to admit he is the stereo-typical angry black man. Almost all of Dickson&#8217;s lines are shouted, but they are also all hysterical. Dickson puts Schmidt and Jenko on the case of finding a new synthetic drug called HFS (look the acronym up yourself) after a kid at the school dies from the drug, a fact no one at the school seems to care at all about. Schmidt and Jenko find the dealer in with ease but the supplier proves to be a much harder task. Eric Molson (Dave Franco) is the environmentalist popular guy at school and the popular click takes a liking to Schmidt immediately where Jenko gets stuck with the nerdy kids because their identities get switched. The role reversal was a brilliant comedic move and the bizarre situations are knowingly over-the-top but the comedy all ramps up and actually does contribute to the plot of the movie.Channing Tatum didn&#8217;t start his film career with the best movies and only dabbled in comedies. 21 Jump Street shows that Tatum can handle more than strutting with his shirt off and second rate action movies. Only a few of Tatum&#8217;s gags are physical and his willingness to look stupid and put himself out there conflicts with his past film resume but sell the comedy on Jump Street so solidly. Jonah Hill comes from the complete opposite side of the industry than his co-star. Hill has been known for his comedies and most of them are quite funny. In 21 Jump Street Hill doesn&#8217;t get to stretch his acting as far as Tatum appeared to but he is still very funny and his on-screen personality gets to clash nicely with the action in the movie. The supporting cast is equally as funny as the lead actors despite their somewhat limited screen time. Dave Franco (yep, the brother of the amazing James Franco) plays the popular drug dealing Eric Molson. Franco has done some very funny material. Along with smaller roles in movies he also did a great series with his older brother for Funny or Die. After 21 Jump Street he should be getting some more substantial comedic roles. The absolutely adorable Brie Larson plays the closest thing to a love interest this movie gets. Schmidt falls for her the second he arrives back at school and she fell in line properly with the popular crowd. Larson is really the only character in the movie who got to show some range of emotion. She is funny with the rest of the cast the majority of the time but she also plays the heart-broken school girl very well. Ice Cube doesn&#8217;t really strain himself as an actor but the man is very funny and embraces his stereo-typical role well.For a movie based off of an 80s TV show its safe to say expectations weren&#8217;t high. Screen Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Manic, Project X) took a silly idea and ran with it. Admitting that the movie was goofy and having the lead actors be just as goofy as the core concept let the audience sit back and really enjoy themselves. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller don&#8217;t have extensive amounts of directorial experience but they certainly did due diligence to a fantastic script.If you haven&#8217;t give 21 Jump Street a change. It is funny from the opening shot to the end. The story is told along with the jokes, it doesn&#8217;t suffer from switching tracks because it can only handle one thing at a time. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a brilliant comedic team. 21 Jump Street is a mockery and pays homage to the serious show it was based on.",5,"Believe it or not, this is amazing",1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,4645,"['site', '[', ']', 'Based', '1987', 'TV', 'show', 'launched', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'self', 'aware', 'comedy', 'was', 'one', 'freshest', 'movies', '2012', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'really', 'showing', 'off', 'comedic', 'chops', 'Jonah', 'Hill', '8217', 'own', 'brand', 'comedy', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'was', 'absolutely', 'funniest', 'movie', '2012.Despite', 'rocky', 'personal', 'history', 'Schmidt', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Jenko', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'bond', 'policy', 'academy', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'graduating', 'academy', 'being', 'sub-par', 'cops', 'land', 'two', 'strange', 'undercover', 'program', 'cops', 'local', 'high', 'schools', 'Chief', 'Hardy', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'great', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'concept', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'berating', 'Schmidt', 'Jenko', 'plot', 'movie', 'overall', 'lack', 'creativity', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'projects', '8220', '8217', 're', 'reviving', 'canceled', 'undercover', 'project', '8217', '80s', 'revamping', 'modern', 'times', 'people', 'lack', 'creativity', '8217', 'run', 'ideas', 'what', 'do', 'now', 'just', 'recycle', 's***', 'past', 'hope', 'nobody', 'will', 'notice.', '8221', 'Captain', 'Dickson', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'man', 'charge', 'running', 'Jump', 'Street', 'was', 'first', 'admit', 'stereo-typical', 'angry', 'black', 'man', 'Almost', 'Dickson', '8217', 's', 'lines', 'are', 'shouted', 'are', 'also', 'hysterical', 'Dickson', 'Schmidt', 'Jenko', 'case', 'finding', 'new', 'synthetic', 'drug', 'called', 'HFS', 'look', 'acronym', 'up', 'kid', 'school', 'drug', 'fact', 'one', 'school', 'care', 'Schmidt', 'Jenko', 'find', 'dealer', 'ease', 'supplier', 'be', 'much', 'harder', 'task', 'Eric', 'Molson', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'environmentalist', 'popular', 'guy', 'school', 'popular', 'click', 'liking', 'Schmidt', 'immediately', 'where', 'Jenko', 'stuck', 'nerdy', 'kids', 'identities', 'get', 'switched', 'role', 'reversal', 'was', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'move', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'are', 'knowingly', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'ramps', 'up', 'actually', 'contribute', 'plot', 'movie.Channing', 'Tatum', 'didn', '8217', 'start', 'film', 'career', 'best', 'movies', 'only', 'dabbled', 'comedies', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Tatum', 'can', 'handle', 'more', 'strutting', 'shirt', 'second', 'rate', 'action', 'movies', 'Only', 'few', 'Tatum', '8217', 'gags', 'are', 'physical', 'willingness', 'look', 'stupid', 'put', 'there', 'past', 'film', 'resume', 'sell', 'comedy', 'Jump', 'Street', 'so', 'solidly', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'complete', 'opposite', 'side', 'industry', 'co-star', 'Hill', 'been', 'known', 'comedies', 'most', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Hill', 'doesn', '8217', 'get', 'stretch', 'acting', 'as', 'far', 'Tatum', 'appeared', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'on-screen', 'personality', 'clash', 'nicely', 'action', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'as', 'funny', 'lead', 'actors', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'yep', 'brother', 'amazing', 'James', 'Franco', 'popular', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Eric', 'Molson', 'Franco', 'done', 'very', 'funny', 'material', 'smaller', 'roles', 'movies', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'series', 'older', 'brother', 'Funny', 'Die', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'substantial', 'comedic', 'roles', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'closest', 'thing', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'Schmidt', 'second', 'back', 'school', 'fell', 'line', 'properly', 'popular', 'crowd', 'Larson', 'really', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'who', 'got', 'show', 'range', 'emotion', 'funny', 'rest', 'cast', 'majority', 'time', 'also', 'heart-broken', 'school', 'girl', 'very', 'well', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'doesn', '8217', 'really', 'strain', 'actor', 'man', 'very', 'funny', 'stereo-typical', 'role', 'well.For', 'movie', 'based', '80s', 'TV', 'show', 'safe', 'say', 'expectations', 'weren', '8217', 'high', 'Screen', 'Writer', 'Michael', 'Bacall', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'Manic', 'Project', 'X', 'took', 'silly', 'idea', 'ran', 'Admitting', 'movie', 'was', 'goofy', 'having', 'lead', 'actors', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'goofy', 'core', 'concept', 'let', 'audience', 'sit', 'back', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Directors', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'extensive', 'amounts', 'directorial', 'experience', 'certainly', 'did', 'due', 'diligence', 'fantastic', 'script.If', 'haven', '8217', 'give', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'change', 'funny', 'opening', 'shot', 'end', 'story', 'told', 'jokes', '8217', 'suffer', 'switching', 'tracks', 'can', 'only', 'handle', 'one', 'thing', 'time', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'make', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'team', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'mockery', 'homage', 'serious', 'show', 'was', 'based']",N/A

I never saw the show, so there is no nostalgic factor here and while I'm a fan of both the actors (despite not generally thinking they are all that talented) I just am so over the whole `High School Comedy'.  This, however, from the very first scene, was a pure delight.  It just never stopped being funny, and the cleverness of the script was impressive to me; the way they contrasted what is `cool' now and then to perfect effect.  Tatum struggling to be cool in a school where jocks are demoted for their shallowness and being smart and health conscious and `tolerant' is cool was hilarious.I blame `Glee'.The plot is full of holes and isn't really all that interesting, but it doesn't matter much.  The concept of them stopping some new drug from escaping a singular school is rather ridiculous since it would have spread far before it was noticed by the feds.  Hill and Tatum are a perfect pair though, and they juggle their dual roles (incompetent cops and incompetent students) really well.  The supporting cast is also at the top of their game, with Ice Cube spouting profanities left and right and Dave Franco completely making the most of his unfortunate face (that's just the way he looks).I also want to say that Jack Johnson, between this and `Safety Not Guaranteed', is like my new favorite thing about movies.Flashy, loud and fast paced, this buddy cop comedy is one of the best.",5,Who cares if the story is dumb; this film is HILARIOUS!,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,1437,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'like', 'much', 'never', 'saw', 'show', 'nostalgic', 'factor', 'here', ""'m"", 'fan', 'actors', 'not', 'generally', 'thinking', 'are', 'talented', 'just', 'am', 'so', 'whole', 'High', 'School', 'Comedy', 'however', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'pure', 'delight', 'just', 'never', 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'cleverness', 'script', 'was', 'impressive', 'way', 'contrasted', 'what', 'cool', 'now', 'then', 'perfect', 'effect', 'Tatum', 'struggling', 'be', 'cool', 'school', 'where', 'jocks', 'are', 'demoted', 'shallowness', 'being', 'smart', 'health', 'conscious', 'tolerant', 'cool', 'was', 'hilarious.I', 'blame', ""Glee'.The"", 'plot', 'full', 'holes', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'concept', 'stopping', 'new', 'drug', 'escaping', 'singular', 'school', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'have', 'spread', 'far', 'was', 'noticed', 'feds', 'Hill', 'Tatum', 'are', 'perfect', 'pair', 'juggle', 'dual', 'roles', 'incompetent', 'cops', 'incompetent', 'students', 'really', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'spouting', 'profanities', 'left', 'right', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'completely', 'making', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'face', 'just', 'way', '.I', 'also', 'want', 'say', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'new', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movies.Flashy', 'loud', 'fast', 'paced', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'one', 'best']",N/A

I was talking about this with a friend not that long ago, and the only two movies I could think of from the last 10 years that made me laugh much were Shaun of the Dead and Fantastic Mr. Fox. I stayed away from 21 Jump Street when it first came out for mostly dumb reasons. One being that I never saw the original show when it aired, and the other being that I'm not a big fan of Jonah Hill given that he's already suffering from Adam Sandler/Seth Rogen syndrome- playing the same character in every movie. Leave it to free passes to the sequel, 22 Jump Street, to get me slightly interested, along with having someone leave their copy of 21 Jump Street at my home and never taking it back. Last night I put the disc in and took a chance, figuring I'd end up turning it off after 20 minutes or so.I'm happy to say that didn't happen.We start out with our two main characters in high school. Schmidt is a short, chubby kid who's about to ask a girl that he's known for a long time to prom. Things don't go well, as the girl becomes alarmed, asking if he's asking her to prom, and a couple of guys are watching him, laughing the whole time. One of them, Jenko, is your typical jock guy, who shortly after making fun of Schmidt, finds out from the principal that he's not going to prom because of his poor grades. Cut to a few years later where they both end up training to be police officers, and start to help each other- Schmidt helps Jenko with the knowledge, Jenko helps push Schmidt through the physical tests. They graduate, become officers, and are ready for their first job. Unfortunately, things go wrong here too. After a lengthy drug bust in a public park, Jenko forgets to read the drug user his Miranda rights, and both he and Schimdt get put on an undercover assignment instead. Their job? Find out who the source is of a new drug that's become wildly popular in high schools, and put an end to it. Things aren't what either man expects when it turns out that what's &#34;cool&#34; now is what was considered lame just a couple of years ago. Two straps while wearing your backpack? Being environmentally friendly? What is this place???First things first, the movie is aware of its doing, and never takes itself that seriously. Several of the big jokes here come from scenes where characters point out things like how people run out of ideas and remake something old, thinking no one will notice. Another was towards the end from someone who mentions that he just wanted to be cool and for people to like him, so he puts on tons of stupid outfits hoping for the best. When you find out who it is, it's hilarious. At the same time, the movie doesn't rely on jokes like these. It had me laughing a couple of times because of how real the humor is. Hill and Tatum have excellent chemistry, and remind me of how well Pegg and Frost worked together in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's just plain good writing and delivery that gets the job done here. No obnoxious sounds or over the top facial expressions, just good humor. It was great having a jock character feel like a fish out of water at a school where everyone's so mellow and doesn't seem to care about much. Usually in movies the athletic characters are written as being annoying and dumb. Here, Tatum's character does exactly what a lot of us -want- to do to people who do nothing but mope about x hurting the environment (you know what I mean, so don't get huffy over that), or getting too offended by a simple remark.Along with the great comedy, there's plenty of action here, including some fun chase sequences. Just like the plot, the action rarely takes itself that seriously, especially when it comes to explosions. Even in the middle of some big chase that's key to helping the heroes out, Jenko will compliment a woman on how fine she looks before taking her pink VW Bug to chase drug dealing bikers. The movie gets its R rating mostly from language, drug use, and the situations going on...and there's a tiny bit of nudity, though nothing's really seen. Rarely do I mention how well a movie is edited, but here, I took note. When the party really gets started, the movie turns into a kind of music video, and it's awesome. It even continues into the closing credits.21 Jump Street is the ultimate buddy-cop movie. Both of these guys did a great job, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to 22 Jump Street. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it runs a bit long at 109 minutes, though it never really gets boring. The movie moves at a fast pace, and is a hell of a ride.In Korean Jesus' name, the end.",4,Way better than I expected- the first comedy I've laughed along with in ages.,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,4743,"['not', ""'m"", 'hard', 'please', 'when', 'comedy', 'movies', 'just', 'rarely', 'find', 'anything', 'genuinely', 'was', 'talking', 'friend', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'could', 'think', 'last', '10', 'years', 'made', 'much', 'were', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'stayed', 'away', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'mostly', 'dumb', 'reasons', 'One', 'being', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'other', 'being', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'given', 'already', 'suffering', 'Adam', 'Sandler/Seth', 'Rogen', 'syndrome-', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'Leave', 'free', 'passes', 'sequel', '22', 'Jump', 'Street', 'get', 'slightly', 'interested', 'having', 'someone', 'leave', 'copy', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'home', 'never', 'taking', 'back', 'Last', 'night', 'put', 'disc', 'took', 'chance', 'figuring', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'off', '20', 'minutes', 'so.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.We', 'start', 'out', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'high', 'school', 'Schmidt', 'short', 'chubby', 'kid', 'who', 'ask', 'girl', 'known', 'long', 'time', 'prom', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'girl', 'alarmed', 'asking', 'asking', 'prom', 'couple', 'guys', 'are', 'watching', 'laughing', 'whole', 'time', 'One', 'Jenko', 'typical', 'jock', 'guy', 'who', 'shortly', 'making', 'fun', 'Schmidt', 'out', 'principal', 'not', 'going', 'prom', 'poor', 'grades', 'Cut', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'training', 'be', 'police', 'officers', 'start', 'help', 'other-', 'Schmidt', 'Jenko', 'knowledge', 'Jenko', 'push', 'Schmidt', 'physical', 'tests', 'graduate', 'become', 'officers', 'are', 'ready', 'first', 'job', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'here', 'too', 'lengthy', 'drug', 'bust', 'public', 'park', 'Jenko', 'read', 'drug', 'Miranda', 'rights', 'Schimdt', 'get', 'put', 'undercover', 'assignment', 'instead', 'job', 'Find', 'who', 'source', 'new', 'drug', 'become', 'wildly', 'popular', 'high', 'schools', 'put', 'end', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'man', 'when', 'out', 'what', '34', 'cool', '34', 'now', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'lame', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Two', 'straps', 'wearing', 'backpack', 'Being', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'What', 'place', 'First', 'things', 'first', 'movie', 'aware', 'doing', 'never', 'seriously', 'Several', 'big', 'jokes', 'here', 'come', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'how', 'people', 'run', 'ideas', 'remake', 'something', 'old', 'thinking', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'was', 'end', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'cool', 'people', 'like', 'so', 'tons', 'stupid', 'outfits', 'hoping', 'best', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'hilarious', 'same', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rely', 'jokes', 'had', 'laughing', 'couple', 'times', 'how', 'real', 'humor', 'Hill', 'Tatum', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'remind', 'how', 'well', 'Pegg', 'Frost', 'worked', 'together', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'writing', 'delivery', 'job', 'done', 'here', 'obnoxious', 'sounds', 'top', 'facial', 'expressions', 'just', 'good', 'humor', 'was', 'great', 'having', 'jock', 'character', 'feel', 'fish', 'water', 'school', 'where', 'everyone', 'so', 'mellow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'about', 'much', 'Usually', 'movies', 'athletic', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'being', 'annoying', 'dumb', 'Here', 'Tatum', 'character', 'exactly', 'what', 'lot', '-want-', 'do', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'mope', 'x', 'hurting', 'environment', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'huffy', 'getting', 'too', 'offended', 'simple', 'remark.Along', 'great', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'action', 'here', 'including', 'fun', 'chase', 'sequences', 'Just', 'plot', 'action', 'rarely', 'seriously', 'especially', 'when', 'explosions', 'Even', 'middle', 'big', 'chase', 'key', 'helping', 'heroes', 'out', 'Jenko', 'will', 'compliment', 'woman', 'how', 'fine', 'taking', 'pink', 'VW', 'Bug', 'chase', 'drug', 'dealing', 'bikers', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'mostly', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'situations', 'going', 'tiny', 'bit', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'really', 'seen', 'Rarely', 'do', 'mention', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'edited', 'here', 'took', 'note', 'When', 'party', 'really', 'started', 'movie', 'kind', 'music', 'video', 'awesome', 'even', 'closing', 'credits.21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'ultimate', 'buddy-cop', 'movie', 'guys', 'did', 'great', 'job', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', '22', 'Jump', 'Street', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'bit', 'long', '109', 'minutes', 'never', 'really', 'boring', 'movie', 'fast', 'pace', 'hell', 'ride.In', 'Korean', 'Jesus', 'name', 'end']",N/A

Jonah Hill (Moneyball) plays Schmidt, a former high school nerd and current police officer newbie with skills of the brain, but no physical skills. Channing Tatum (The Vow) plays Jenko, who is just the opposite. Together, they are a perfect fit and a disaster waiting to happen.""21 Jump Street"" is a lot of fun and always entertaining. The movie introduces you to the characters and their personalities. You know them and you relate to them. The story is even fairly intriguing, which isn't always the case in movies like these. As Schmidt finds himself getting over all the things that plagued him in high school, you find yourself rooting for him.There are constant jokes and laughs throughout the movie. Although, I did notice that many of the best laughs were spoiled by previously released promotional materials. Thankfully there are plenty of laughs to go around. The movie never lets up and is always interesting, funny and strangely endearing. It is also hilarious watching the two cops return to high school and finding the ways of the past to be just that.

1373431,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B003Y5H5B0,Cool Breeze,"[79, 99]","I've never been a fan of Channing Tatum for an assorted number of reasons. My principle reason for my disliking Channing Tatum is his lack of acting talent. His deficiencies as an actor were made apparent in every genre of film. Ever since he broke onto the scene with ""Step Up"",he has delivered his signature one-note performance in every movie in which he has been cast. And it seemed as if he would never get any better. I was ready to give up on him until I read the reviews for ""21 Jump Street"". Not only was the movie supposed to be well done, but Mr. One Note Channing Tatum was supposed to have turned in one of his best performances as well. Out of a morbid sense of curiosity, I had to see the movie for myself; and after nearly two hours of continuous guffawing, I left the theatre with a new sense of hope. Channing Tatum may have found his niche as a movie actor:he can be a funny man. Channing Tatum is......funny.I remember watching 21 Jump Street as a youngster in the 1980's. I loved it when it was on network television.  The premise: a bunch of young looking 20 something detectives pose as high school students as they attempt to curb the criminal activity that is perpetrated by high school students. This show became a career launching pad for many of the principle characters, including the venerable and legendary Johnny Depp. However, the show has become pretty dated, and I doubt that I could watch it with the same enthusiasm now that I'm in my thirties. And when I heard that they were remaking this television show for the big screen, I nearly gagged. But after seeing the movie remake with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, I have to say that I am so happy that I went against my instincts and saw this film.  It is the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time. I actually laughed out loud while watching this movie, and it has been a long time since I have laughed out loud during any film.The plot of the movie is not difficult to follow. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are enemies in high school; with Channing Tatum being the popular high school jock(Jenko), while Jonah Hill is the socially awkward and geeky Eminem look-a-like(Schmidt). A few years after they graduate from high school, they enroll in the police academy. While at the academy, they discover that Schmidt is able to master the academic part of the training and Jenko is able to master the physical aspect of the police training. Jenko and Schmidt soon realize that if they are to make it past their respective exams, they are going to have to help one another. Their decision to cooperate with each other leads to a special friendship, and after graduating from the academy they are able to secure assignments in the same police unit.Jenko and Schmidt prove to be inept as police officers in the bike unit, but they are given a second chance as undercover police officers. Their mission: infiltrate a drug operation in a high school that is run by a smarmy high school senior played by David Franco(James Franco's brother). Here the roles of Jenk and Schmidt are reversed. It is Jenko who is the social outcast while Schmidt is the cool insider. Turns out that in the year 2012 it is okay to be openly gay, carry your backpack using both straps, openly campaign for the preservation of the environment, and do well in school-which are all of the traits that Jenko used to hate about Schmidt. While they are trying to infiltrate the drug operation, Schmidt's popularity causes a rift in their friendship; and as their relationship collapses, so does their work as undercover officers. Eventually their antagonistic supervisor(played by Ice Cube!!!) has to fire them, and all hope seems to be lost for the two former friends. It does not take long for Jenko and Schmidt to become friends again; and with their friendship repaired they are able to prove their worth as officers through their special form of vigilantism.As I've said before, Channing Tatum is really funny in this film. Jonah Hill and Ice Cube also deliver some really good liners as well. Although a remake, the film is original in its execution of the conventional screenplay. I highly recommend this film. And I have to say that if you choose to see this movie, you will be greeted with a really nice surprise near the end.",5,Channing Tatum is Funny 4.5 Stars,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,4293,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'assorted', 'number', 'reasons', 'principle', 'reason', 'disliking', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'deficiencies', 'actor', 'were', 'made', 'apparent', 'genre', 'film', 'Ever', 'broke', 'scene', 'Step', 'Up', 'delivered', 'signature', 'one-note', 'performance', 'movie', 'been', 'cast', 'seemed', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'better', 'was', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'read', 'reviews', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'One', 'Note', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Out', 'morbid', 'sense', 'curiosity', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'myself', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'continuous', 'guffawing', 'left', 'theatre', 'new', 'sense', 'hope', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'niche', 'movie', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'man', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'funny.I', 'remember', 'watching', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'youngster', '1980', 'loved', 'when', 'was', 'network', 'television', 'premise', 'bunch', 'young', 'looking', '20', 'something', 'detectives', 'pose', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'attempt', 'curb', 'criminal', 'activity', 'perpetrated', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'show', 'became', 'career', 'launching', 'pad', 'many', 'principle', 'characters', 'including', 'venerable', 'legendary', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'However', 'show', 'become', 'pretty', 'dated', 'doubt', 'could', 'watch', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'now', ""'m"", 'thirties', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'remaking', 'television', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'nearly', 'gagged', 'seeing', 'movie', 'remake', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'went', 'instincts', 'saw', 'film', 'funniest', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'watching', 'movie', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'film.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'are', 'enemies', 'high', 'school', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'being', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'Jenko', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'socially', 'awkward', 'geeky', 'Eminem', 'look-a-like', 'Schmidt', 'few', 'years', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'enroll', 'police', 'academy', 'academy', 'discover', 'Schmidt', 'able', 'master', 'academic', 'part', 'training', 'Jenko', 'able', 'master', 'physical', 'aspect', 'police', 'training', 'Jenko', 'Schmidt', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'make', 'respective', 'exams', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'help', 'one', 'decision', 'cooperate', 'other', 'special', 'friendship', 'graduating', 'academy', 'are', 'able', 'secure', 'assignments', 'same', 'police', 'unit.Jenko', 'Schmidt', 'prove', 'be', 'inept', 'police', 'officers', 'bike', 'unit', 'are', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'undercover', 'police', 'officers', 'mission', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'operation', 'high', 'school', 'run', 'smarmy', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'played', 'David', 'Franco', 'James', 'Franco', 'brother', 'Here', 'roles', 'Jenk', 'Schmidt', 'are', 'reversed', 'Jenko', 'who', 'social', 'outcast', 'Schmidt', 'cool', 'insider', 'out', 'year', '2012', 'okay', 'be', 'openly', 'gay', 'carry', 'backpack', 'using', 'straps', 'openly', 'campaign', 'preservation', 'environment', 'do', 'well', 'school-which', 'are', 'traits', 'Jenko', 'used', 'hate', 'Schmidt', 'are', 'trying', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'operation', 'Schmidt', 'popularity', 'rift', 'friendship', 'relationship', 'collapses', 'so', 'work', 'undercover', 'officers', 'Eventually', 'antagonistic', 'supervisor', 'played', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'fire', 'hope', 'be', 'lost', 'two', 'former', 'friends', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'Jenko', 'Schmidt', 'become', 'friends', 'again', 'friendship', 'repaired', 'are', 'able', 'prove', 'worth', 'officers', 'special', 'form', 'vigilantism.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'really', 'funny', 'film', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'liners', 'as', 'well', 'remake', 'film', 'original', 'execution', 'conventional', 'screenplay', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'choose', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'greeted', 'really', 'nice', 'surprise', 'end']",N/A

1373434,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5H5B0,C. Sawin,"[3, 4]","I had a bad feeling going into 21 Jump Street. I never watched the original series and I'm not a fan of Channing Tatum (nobody really seems to be who isn't a woman). I also really disliked the last comedy Jonah Hill was in (The Sitter) since it just felt like a rehash of everything he did before it without offering much of anything new. With all the trailers, clips, and red band media from the movie hitting the web, it felt like I had seen the majority of the movie going into it anyway. Then there was the co-worker who went to an even earlier screening and swore on its massive hilarity. How often does that work out in a positive light? ""Some guy I sort of know said this was really funny!"" Then you go see it with high expectations and anticipation dripping from your armpits and it turns out to be about as amusing as a moldy loaf of bread. That invisible type of mold that looks fine until you sit down to eat it in a sandwich or as toast or something and then it just tastes like you're licking fresh algae off of a wet rock. Fortunately, this didn't go down quite like that.The first thirty to forty five minutes are pretty much ruined and spoiled by the trailers. The F-word is thrown around quite a bit and random people are dry humped to bridge the gap between the clips you have seen, but things don't begin to look up and feel fresh until Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) take the HFS drug. Maybe Channing Tatum has just been type casted into the wrong genres his entire career because he was downright hysterical. His ""F--- science!"" and band practice scenes while on HFS will have you in tears. Jonah Hill delivers exactly the type of humor you've come to expect from the recent Oscar nominee and is pretty funny, but it feels like Tatum has made this huge breakthrough in comparison.The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is also a pretty big selling point. The movie relies on the two of them to work together as a team or at least create classic moments together and it works in ways you can't even begin to imagine. Their past, their assignment, their fights with one another, and the way they both seem to get in too deep make their friendship all the more believable and extremely entertaining to watch. The scene when they're trying to make each other throw up not only shows how close they are but illustrates how hilarious they can be together.21 Jump Street has this element of unexpected; laugh out loud hilarity buried underneath all of the clips you've seen in the trailers. While the known rule of ""the less familiar you are with everything the better"" would work in spades here, 21 Jump Street still offers quite a few surprises and really funny antics. Their take on explosions for example is brilliant. By now you probably know Johnny Depp has a cameo in the movie since he had a recurring role in the original series. The crazy part is that this is the most enjoyable live-action Johnny Depp role in years. I'd even venture to say it's his best since his performance as Sir James Matthew Barrie in Finding Neverland since it's short, sweet, vulgar, and straight to the humorous point.21 Jump Street is one of the funniest R-rated films of the past few years and quite possibly the funniest since the original Hangover. This movie might end up with more people liking Channing Tatum or at least being able to tolerate him a bit more. Nobody could have guessed he'd tap into some comedic brilliance here. 21 Jump Street is a big-time comedy hit packed with loads of laughs to make it feel like the summer blockbuster season is already upon us.",4,It rhymes with grape!,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,3576,"['had', 'bad', 'feeling', 'going', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'nobody', 'really', 'be', 'who', ""n't"", 'woman', 'also', 'really', 'disliked', 'last', 'comedy', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'was', 'Sitter', 'just', 'felt', 'rehash', 'everything', 'did', 'offering', 'much', 'anything', 'new', 'trailers', 'clips', 'red', 'band', 'media', 'movie', 'hitting', 'web', 'felt', 'had', 'seen', 'majority', 'movie', 'going', 'anyway', 'Then', 'was', 'co-worker', 'who', 'went', 'even', 'earlier', 'screening', 'swore', 'massive', 'hilarity', 'How', 'often', 'work', 'out', 'positive', 'light', 'guy', 'sort', 'know', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'Then', 'go', 'see', 'high', 'expectations', 'anticipation', 'dripping', 'armpits', 'out', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'amusing', 'moldy', 'loaf', 'bread', 'invisible', 'type', 'mold', 'fine', 'sit', 'down', 'eat', 'sandwich', 'toast', 'something', 'then', 'just', ""'re"", 'licking', 'fresh', 'algae', 'wet', 'rock', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'quite', 'that.The', 'first', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'spoiled', 'trailers', 'F-word', 'thrown', 'quite', 'bit', 'random', 'people', 'are', 'dry', 'humped', 'bridge', 'gap', 'clips', 'have', 'seen', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'look', 'up', 'feel', 'fresh', 'Schmidt', 'Hill', 'Jenko', 'Tatum', 'take', 'HFS', 'drug', 'Maybe', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'just', 'been', 'type', 'casted', 'wrong', 'genres', 'entire', 'career', 'was', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'F', 'science', 'band', 'practice', 'scenes', 'HFS', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'exactly', 'type', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Tatum', 'made', 'huge', 'breakthrough', 'comparison.The', 'chemistry', 'Hill', 'Tatum', 'also', 'pretty', 'big', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'two', 'work', 'together', 'team', 'least', 'create', 'classic', 'moments', 'together', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'past', 'assignment', 'fights', 'one', 'way', 'seem', 'get', 'too', 'deep', 'make', 'friendship', 'more', 'believable', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'scene', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'other', 'throw', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'how', 'hilarious', 'can', 'be', 'together.21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'element', 'unexpected', 'loud', 'hilarity', 'buried', 'clips', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'known', 'rule', 'less', 'familiar', 'are', 'everything', 'better', 'would', 'work', 'spades', 'here', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'still', 'quite', 'few', 'surprises', 'really', 'funny', 'antics', 'take', 'explosions', 'example', 'brilliant', 'now', 'probably', 'know', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'cameo', 'movie', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'original', 'series', 'crazy', 'part', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'live-action', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'role', 'years', ""'d"", 'even', 'venture', 'say', 'best', 'performance', 'Sir', 'James', 'Matthew', 'Barrie', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'short', 'sweet', 'vulgar', 'straight', 'humorous', 'point.21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'one', 'funniest', 'R-rated', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'quite', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'original', 'Hangover', 'movie', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'more', 'people', 'liking', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'least', 'being', 'able', 'tolerate', 'bit', 'more', 'Nobody', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', ""'d"", 'tap', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'here', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'big-time', 'comedy', 'hit', 'packed', 'loads', 'laughs', 'make', 'feel', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'season', 'already', 'upon']",N/A

After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park. Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs.In 2005, Schmidt and Jenko are high school students, one an honor roll geek, the other a cool, athletic underachiever. By 2012, they are rookie cops, paired together, on bike patrol yearning to make arrests. After a screw up, they're sent undercover back to high school to find the source of a dangerous synthetic drug. They mix up their names, and Schmidt gets the no-brainer classes where he auditions for Peter Pan and falls in love with Wendy; Jenko gets AP classes where he falls in with high-achieving dweebs.

Fast forward a few years, and they become fast friends while going through police academy.  The only problem is, they're lousy cops.  But they're young looking, which makes them perfect candidates for the departmental revival of an 80's undercover program, headquartered at 21 Jump Street.  Their job: infiltrate a local high school, disguised as students, and stop a drug smuggling operation.  However, they both find that high school is not what it used to be.  Hijinks ensue.Surprisingly, 21 JUMP STREET is funny.  In spots, it's absolutely hilarious.  It slowly comes apart in its third act (one particular gag goes a little too far, though it's funny at first), but the first two-thirds are genuinely amusing and occasionally thoughtful.  As Schmidt, Jonah Hill tones down his usual schtick (and his body mass); as Jenko, Channing Tatum is actually hilarious (who knew he could act?!).  The actors' chemistry is undeniable (they're real-life buddies), and helps carry the film.  The supporting cast is equally strong: Dave Franco, Brie Larson, Robb Riggle, and Ice Cube stand out.  And a pair of hilarious cameos helps cap things off.As good as the acting talent is, the real star here is the script.  There's obviously a lot of imrpov, but the script manages to flip high school cliches on their head.  Part of the fun of the film is watching Schmidt and Jenko react to this new high school world; throw in a few high-octane scenes perfectly parodying action films, and you come up with a film that may not be brilliant, but it's at least pretty smart.

1373445,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003Y5H5B0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","For many people who grew up in the '80s, ""21 Jump Street"" was the ultimate ensemble cop show.Aimed at a younger generation, the crime drama series was part of the beginning of the FOX network, which fascinated many people for its youthful or politically incorrect television series and in the case of ""21 Jump Street"", many were fascinated by its stars.Created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannel, ""21 Jump Street"" would star young talents Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson, Peter DeLuise, Dustin Nguyen, Frederic Forrest, Steven Williams, Richard Grieco and many more. The concept of the series would be about police officers with youthful appearances and thus, would allow them to be undercover cops in high schools and colleges to investigate drug trafficking and abuse.The series would air in 1987 through 1991 with a total of  103 episodes.  Fast forward to 2008, Columbia Pictures would have the rights to the film adaptation of the series and actors Jonah Hill (""Superbad"", ""Moneyball"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Michael Bacall (""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Pumpkin"") would be responsible for writing the story.  And in Hill's words, his goal was to create an ""R-rated, insane, ""Bad Boys"" meets John Hughes type movie"".Tapped to direct the film were writing duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", ""Clone High"" and co-executive producers of the TV sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"").The film would be a departure from the original TV series which was created as a drama series with a moral message.  The film adaptation would be more of an action comedy film and instead of featuring a group, it would focus on two police officers played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (""The Vow"", ""Dear John"", ""Step Up"").And the film which was budgeted at $42 million would become a success for Columbia Pictures/MGM/Original Film as it would earn over $192 million in the box office and also receive positive reviews from film critics.VIDEO:""21 Jump Street"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  For video quality, it appears that there was an intentional decision by cinematographer Barry Peterson (""Jumper"", ""Zoolander"", ""Starsky & Hutch"") to shoot the film with more subdued colors.  So, the creative decision to go that direction leads to a warmer, subdued, dare I say a little softer look at times.  But there are also scenes that look brighter and darker and if anything, it works for the film.  Black levels are nice and deep, details are good but the film is not vibrant as one may hope for it to be.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""21 Jump Street"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French, Spanish, Thai, English-Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from a film with plenty of action, the lossless soundtrack for ""21 Jump Street"" is fantastic.  From gun shots, explosions, crunching metal to you name it...there is wonderful use of the surround channels and LFE.  Dialogue is crisp and clear and even the music sounds fantastic!  Overall, listeners will enjoy the immersive soundscape of those action sequences during their viewing of the film.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese Mandarin (Traditional and Simplified), Indonesian/Bahasa, Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES""21 Jump Street"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.Deleted Scenes - (29:32) Featuring 20 deleted scenes.Gag Reel - (4:58) Featuring outtakes from ""21 Jump Street"".Cube-O-Rama - (1:53) Featuring Ice Cube scenes and improv not featured in the final cut of the film.Back to School - (7:45) Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Neil Moritz (producer) talk abut going back to high school, its storyline and how the film came to be.Brothers in Arms - (11:30) Producer Neil Moritz, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum talk about their action sequences and casting two opposites.Johnny Depp on Set - (4:42) Directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord along with the cast talk about Johnny Depp's cameo in the film and their thoughts when they saw him appear on the set.The Rob Riggle Show - (9:24) A featurette on Rob Riggle and how he was cast for the film.Peter Pan on Freeway - (4:12) A featurette of the shooting of the freeway scene.EXTRAS:""21 Jump Street"" comes with an UltraViolet code to allow for streaming to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:Prior to ""21 Jump Street"" being released to theaters, I was dreading the film.Why?  Because I was one of those teenagers in the '80s who loved ""21 Jump Street"" on television.  I wanted to dress like Officer Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Officer Harry Truman Ioki (Dustin Nguyen) and the show was a big part of my teenage life.  When Depp sported the '70s vintage watch strap with no watch, I did the same.  When, Nguyen sported a certain hairstyle, I did the same. I would listen to the ""21 Jump Street"" soundtrack over and over and would have VHS tape of TV recordings of the series.So, suffice to say, when you hear Jonah Hill will be writing ""21 Jump Street"", I kept asking ""Why?"".And now, having watched ""21 Jump Street"", I have to say that I really enjoyed this hilarious film.  Yes, it deviates from the TV series that it is more comedy-driven, a lot of crude and sexual content and humor, but it works.  And instead of the ensemble cast, it becomes more of the police buddy movie that has been done before, but with even more crazy comedy and humor that overshadows similar police buddy comedy films such as ""Rush Hour"", ""Starsky & Hutch"" or ""The Other Guys"".And of course, it's written by Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall, two men who know crude comedy that works for today's generation.  For example, in one scene, both men were forced to take the synthetic drug and in order to make themselves to vomit it out, both subject themselves to fingering each other's mouths. Or another scene where the drug reaches its height with the character of Schmidt, and during a track meet run, uses the baton and pretends it's his own penis.  There are so many crazy, gut-busting scenes that made me laugh out loud and the comedy works.  Especially one hilarious, gross out scene at the end of the film involving actor Rob Riggle, which you don't see coming.And ""21 Jump Street"" is a film that allows Ice Cube to get back to the character with so many F-bombs, it's so crazy!But what lends to the film's efficacy is the unknown.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the unlikely police duo, similar to how Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were in ""The Other Guys"" but not as annoying and much more funnier.  ""21 Jump Street"" taps into the opposites attract and with this unlikely bromance, Hill and Tatum played their characters wonderfully.  And considering the film has made so much money, there is no doubt that we will see a sequel.As for the old ""21 Jump Street"" TV series, fans also get to see Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson Peete play their original characters.  While some talents are shown on a TV screen, this small homage to the TV series also made me wonder if the character Greg Jenko (Tatum) had any relation to the short-lived ""21 Jump Street"" character Captain Richard Jenko from the TV series.So, while the ""21 Jump Street"" film adaptation was much different from the TV series, as a fan of the original TV series, I'm glad there were major differences but also managed to interject some of the show into the film, especially showcasing the bromance between original characters Officer Tom Hanson (Depp) and Officer Doug Penhall (DeLuise) and with Schmidt and Jenko.  More or less, the passing of the baton of one era to another.As for the Blu-ray release, while video quality was good, I wish it was more vibrant but I understand the more dimmer look of the film was possibly a creative decision.  As for the audio, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic.  And there are also many short special features included on the Blu-ray release.Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" was a gut-busting, piss in your pants type of action comedy film.  I was dreading the film as a die-hard fan of the original TV series but by the end of the film, I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait for the sequel!

1373450,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B003Y5H5B0,Douglas King,"[1, 1]","""21 Jump Street"" shares little in common with the 80's TV series of the same name that helped launch both Johnny Depp's career and the Fox network. Although the film's two main characters Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) both enter into the same undercover police program that has its officers posing as high school students, ""21 Jump Street"" the film is really a raunch-with-a-heart-of-gold romp from the Judd Apatow school of moviemaking, with a little bit of classic ""Lethal Weapon"" style action-comedy-calamity thrown in for good measure.Surprise! The film actually works, and manages to be funny, entertaining and endearing throughout. Much of this has to do with the chemistry of the film's leads. Hill's Schmidt is book smart, but awkward, and Jenko is brawny but oafish. The two originally meet in high school, with Jenko's popular kid bullying Schmidt's nerd, but when they meet again years later in the police academy, they find that their differences actually make for a great friendship.When the two return to high school in the Jump Street program to infiltrate a drug ring, they realize that much has changed over the years. The ""cool kids"" are now politically correct, sensitive, and eco-conscious, and they surprisingly accept sensitive Schmidt and reject apathetic Jenko. Jenko instead finds his niche with the science nerds, finding their mastery of technology appealing. In this way, the film makes a skin-deep commentary about how subjective and fleeting things like popularity and acceptance can be.But mostly the whole thing is just played up for lots of laughs, with Hill and Tatum showing that they're up for just about anything; including singing showtunes, dressing up like Peter Pan, reciting poems about chemistry, and, in the film's funniest sequence, getting stoned out of their minds on an illegal designer drug while at school. Two supporting actors also shine in the film, Brie Larson (""United States of Tara"") as the popular theatre aficionado who Schmidt falls for, and David Franco as the film's politically correct high school drug kingpin. Johnny Depp also makes a brief but pivotal and hilarious cameo in the film's manic climax.",4,Bromantic Comedy,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2183,"['21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'shares', 'little', 'common', '80', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'helped', 'launch', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'career', 'Fox', 'network', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Schmidt', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Jenko', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'enter', 'same', 'undercover', 'police', 'program', 'officers', 'posing', 'as', 'high', 'school', 'students', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'film', 'really', 'raunch-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'romp', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'school', 'moviemaking', 'little', 'bit', 'classic', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'style', 'action-comedy-calamity', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.Surprise', 'film', 'actually', 'be', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'endearing', 'Much', 'do', 'chemistry', 'film', 'leads', 'Hill', 'Schmidt', 'book', 'smart', 'awkward', 'Jenko', 'brawny', 'oafish', 'two', 'originally', 'meet', 'high', 'school', 'Jenko', 'popular', 'kid', 'bullying', 'Schmidt', 'nerd', 'when', 'meet', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'police', 'academy', 'find', 'differences', 'actually', 'make', 'great', 'friendship.When', 'two', 'return', 'high', 'school', 'Jump', 'Street', 'program', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'ring', 'realize', 'much', 'changed', 'years', 'cool', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'politically', 'correct', 'sensitive', 'eco-conscious', 'surprisingly', 'accept', 'sensitive', 'Schmidt', 'reject', 'apathetic', 'Jenko', 'Jenko', 'instead', 'niche', 'science', 'nerds', 'finding', 'mastery', 'technology', 'appealing', 'way', 'film', 'skin-deep', 'commentary', 'how', 'subjective', 'fleeting', 'things', 'popularity', 'acceptance', 'can', 'be.But', 'mostly', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'played', 'up', 'lots', 'laughs', 'Hill', 'Tatum', 'showing', ""'re"", 'up', 'just', 'anything', 'including', 'singing', 'showtunes', 'dressing', 'up', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'reciting', 'poems', 'chemistry', 'film', 'funniest', 'sequence', 'getting', 'stoned', 'minds', 'illegal', 'designer', 'drug', 'school', 'Two', 'supporting', 'actors', 'also', 'shine', 'film', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'United', 'States', 'Tara', 'popular', 'theatre', 'aficionado', 'who', 'Schmidt', 'David', 'Franco', 'film', 'politically', 'correct', 'high', 'school', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'also', 'brief', 'pivotal', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'film', 'manic', 'climax']",N/A

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum take their roles about as seriously as the film does itself (read: not at all) but still manage to develop a weird sort of chemistry as a helplessly stupid, modernized odd couple. It's to be expected that they'll stumble and bumble their way to the head of a major criminal organization. But rather than trying in vain to avoid the cliches inherent with such a familiar premise, Jump Street completely embraces them and actually dictates its decision to do so. Maybe the best example of this is in Nick Offerman's all-too-brief cameo, as he stares down the lens and deadpans a monologue about recycling thin gimmicks from the past. For storyline purposes, he's talking about the department resuscitating the Jump Street undercover program, but it doesn't take a grin or a wink to know what he's really on about. He grins and winks anyway. As a parody of everything from its genre to its audience, this is pointedly effective stuff.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Pooh-pooh-ers of the Generation X persuasion may rake me over the coals, but I'll shout it from the rooftops anyway: The 2012 big screen remake of 21 JUMP STREET is better than the original. And maybe it's the low expectation... I never anticipated this movie to be this entertaining and this funny. The rumor mill indicates a sequel is in the offing. I'm so down with that.Whereas the Fox television series was a straight-up undercover police drama with teen angst thrown in, the film lifts the original premise but then veers off into different territory. The modern-day 21 JUMP STREET tilts heavily towards raunchy comedy, with the teen angst spun for laughs. It's a clever and affectionate spoofing of 1980s nostalgia and of familiar teen movie clich&eacute;s.Seven years after high school, former pudgy nerd Schmidt and dim bulb ex-jock Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) are reacquainted in the police academy. Despite inhabiting opposite ends of the social spectrum, Schmidt and Jenko become pals. Something about one's reach not exceeding one's grasp, and the pair while on bike patrol ef up royally during a drug bust. They're reassigned to an undercover unit in which youthful-appearing cops pass themselves off as high school students to investigate crimes. Schmidt and Jenko are tasked with infiltrating a high school and smoking out the main supplier of a new synthetic drug. But Schmidt and Jenko take the ""smoking out"" bit too literally.Schmidt and Jenko are in for a culture shock. Things have switched up since their time in school seven years ago. Comic books and being environmentally responsible are now cool. Suddenly Schmidt is the cool kid on the block and Jenko, the dumb loser. Jenko's response: ""Fudge you, Glee!"" (Except he didn't really say ""Fudge."")No cow is too sacred to slay in this movie. Tropes from buddy cop cinema are exposed and poked fun at. Even Channing's age is brought up more than once, how he looks more like a 40 year old than a teenager. I love how the action scenes would play out in typically thunderous fashion but then suddenly get undermined by either the switching of camera perspectives or the sudden muting of the score. 21 JUMP STREET will have you laughing end to end. Several satisfying cameos are guaranteed to stretch that grin. Just keep in mind that there are copious moments of profanity and drug use.Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Channing Tatum are pitch perfect. Tatum, especially, is a revelation, proving here that he can do comedy. He submits one of the most hilarious deadpan performances of the past few years. 21 JUMP STREET had no right to be this funny and sweet. I don't want to neglect Ice Cube's awesome turn as the unit's sullen head honcho. Sodapop came out my nose over his line about Korean Jesus.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller & actors Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum- ""Back to School"" - behind-the-scenes peek with the cast & crew (00:07:44 minutes)- 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:08:33 minutes)",4,"""Teenage the fudge up!""

There is a twist to the narc cops go back to high school as students story. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the studious, nerdy guy in high school. His nemisis Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the good looking, not so bright jock type. Years later, they end up fairly useless police officers send undercover to expose a high school drug ring.Though it hasnn't been that many years since high school for Schmidt and Jenko, the rules have changed. Today's high school kids are socially conscious vegetarians worried about the mileage their cars get. Brainless jocks are out. Nerdy intelligent guys are now popular. The rules have changed except for one thing. Someone is suppling the high school kids with a new ""feel good"" drug that quickly turns bad and potentially fatal.Although the dialogue can get rather ""colorful"" and there are a lot of references to the male ""organ,"" 21 JUMP STREET is actually a coming of age story between two opposites who learn to love and respect each other. Despite the raunchy humor and drug use, there is a gentle nature to the story. Hill and Tatum work together well and there is a genuine friendly chemistry between them. One of the funniest scenes is when the two have to take the drug to prove they are not cops and the hallucinations are hilarious. Don't miss the small but very noticeable cameos by an original 21 JUMP STREET TV star and current top movie star.We all need a funny movie at times and for once this is not a mindless rauchy comedy.

To be honest though, it's not bad, delivering some fairly solid laughs amid some really ludicrous setups and pretty much everything you see in Act One is a setup for a punch line in the finale.As usual, all the high schools kids look way too old to be in high school which gets around the potential creepiness of these guys going on prom dates with teenagers. And if vulgarity turns you off, this may not be the movie for you since it's on par with The Hangover for the inevitable stream of juvenile sex jokes.The film is about 15-20 minutes too long so by the end it gets a little long in the tooth. The supposed case they are solving is barely worth much attention and plays out as you would expect.

I had to admire how cannily screenwriters Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall tailored their script with the right language (profane), situations (interfering parents), and embarrassments left over from adolescence (prom dates and bad grades) for the 17/30-year-old ticket buyer. No wonder it has made so much money. Smart guys!We have two buddies, totally different, both of whom make it through the Police Academy, only to botch their first big arrest. Consequently, they are assigned to an angry sergeant who is stuck in a Korean Church (at 21 Jump Street) and sent undercover to a local high school to find the distributor of a lethal drug that is making its way into the teenage culture. Unfortunately, this means they have to live at home again.Part of the joke is that former jock Tatum is mistakenly assigned to the brainy classes, while poor pudgy Hill is sent to the track team. Another joke is several setups for blowie uppie stuff that simply do NOT explode. Our heroes are confused because they were counting on explosions. Of course the party when the parents leave town is predictably lewd and destructive. Even Mom's Kokopelli jug from Sedona bit the dust!These guys gave it their all:* Channing Tatum (""The Vow""), demonstrating hitherto unknown comedy chops. Who knew? (He's the jock.)* Jonah Hill (""Moneyball""), more slender now than he has ever been, his character has a real problem shooting a gun. (He's NOT the jock.)* Ice Cube (""Rampart""), is the astonishingly profane (and furious) sergeant.* Dave Franco (""Fright Night""), is a politically correct environmentalist who is scared to death of going to prison.

They are taken off the streets and sent to a high school where they are tasked with infiltrating a drug dealing gang. The humor when these two become students is priceless, with plenty of laugh-out-loud hijinks and slapstick. It helps that the two leads are charming too. The story has very little to do with the 80s TV series and the leads are never as cool here as Johnny Depp was when he did the series. In fact, Tatum and Hill are downright silly which I think probably helped the movie considerably because it is hard to top Depp's coolness in the series (back then he was the bomb.

I had no idea what to expect from this movie revival, but heard it was incredibly funny.  Funny?The story opens with Jenko (Tatum), a jock, and Schmidt (Hill), a nerd, in high school where they don't get along.  They come together as they go through the police academy to share their strengths.  Unfortunately, they suck at being bike cops and get reassigned as undercover cops who will go back to high school to expose a drug ring.  Jenko again screws up and gets their cover identity backwards once in the school.  This might have been a problem, but it turns out that things are much different in high school a decade later.  What was once cool is now verboten and being a tree-hugging hipster is mucho cool.This movie was a riot.  Jonah Hill is always excellent at physical humor but Channing Tatum is able to hold his own.  When they take the new designer drug and proceed to freak out, I laughed so hard I almost cried.  The physical humor is also balanced with some witty dialogue and sarcastic humor.  Add in Ice T and David Franco (James Franco's adorable younger brother) and you have a great cast you connect with.This movie will keep you satisfied whether or not you saw the TV show.  It gives an appropriate nod toward the show without relying too heavily on inside jokes or old storyline.

I've been a Johnny Depp fan since Edward Scissorhands.)  I was excited for the new movie, and even went to see it in theaters as a birthday present to myself.  I saw it again this Sunday, with my sister, renting it from the local Redbox.And I still liked it!  The kids were asleep, we had fresh pumpkin brownies, and it was so nice to watch something that wasn't Spongebob Squarepants.  (Nickelodeon, why do you play the same episodes over and over again?)21 Jump Street is a pretty straightforward action-comedy.  Janko (Channing Tatum) and Schmitt (Jonah Hill) weren't friends in high school, but they became buds in the police academy.  Janko was good at the physical stuff; Schmitt at the mental.  Now, after a failed drug bust, they're back in high school trying to stop a drug ring from spreading.Not all of the humor is to my taste, but 21 Jump Street made me laugh a lot.  Tatum and Hill have great timing and chemistry.  In addition to pretty funny - and self-aware - dialogue, there are lots of physical gags.  Keep an eye out for the guys maneuvering around a couch in the climatic shoot-out.  Moving away from drama for comedy in the reboot was a good choice.I'm not so big on the romantic storyline.  Schmitt ends up having a bit of a thing with Molly (Brie Larson), although it's more flirting on the phone than anything physical.  It's still a grown guy hitting on an underage girl under false pretenses.  It's skeevy.  (Given less screen time is Ellie Kemper as a teacher with a crush on Tatum's character, which fortunately goes nowhere.)Basically, I'm glad they're making a sequel.  21 Jump Street is a fun movie and I'm ready to see the guys go to college.",4,Funny movie,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1823,"[""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'have', 'seen', 'original', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'television', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'way', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'What', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'was', 'excited', 'new', 'movie', 'even', 'went', 'see', 'theaters', 'birthday', 'present', 'saw', 'again', 'Sunday', 'sister', 'renting', 'local', 'Redbox.And', 'still', 'liked', 'kids', 'were', 'asleep', 'had', 'fresh', 'pumpkin', 'brownies', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'watch', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'Spongebob', 'Squarepants', 'Nickelodeon', 'why', 'do', 'play', 'same', 'over', 'again', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'action-comedy', 'Janko', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Schmitt', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'were', ""n't"", 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'became', 'buds', 'police', 'academy', 'Janko', 'was', 'good', 'physical', 'stuff', 'Schmitt', 'mental', 'Now', 'failed', 'drug', 'bust', ""'re"", 'back', 'high', 'school', 'trying', 'stop', 'drug', 'ring', 'spreading.Not', 'humor', 'taste', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'made', 'lot', 'Tatum', 'Hill', 'have', 'great', 'timing', 'chemistry', 'addition', 'pretty', 'funny', 'self-aware', 'dialogue', 'are', 'lots', 'physical', 'gags', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'guys', 'maneuvering', 'couch', 'climatic', 'shoot-out', 'Moving', 'away', 'drama', 'comedy', 'reboot', 'was', 'good', 'choice.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'big', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'Schmitt', 'up', 'having', 'bit', 'thing', 'Molly', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'more', 'flirting', 'phone', 'anything', 'physical', 'still', 'grown', 'guy', 'hitting', 'underage', 'girl', 'false', 'pretenses', 'skeevy', 'Given', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'Ellie', 'Kemper', 'teacher', 'crush', 'Tatum', 'character', 'fortunately', 'nowhere', 'Basically', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'re"", 'making', 'sequel', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'fun', 'movie', ""'m"", 'ready', 'see', 'guys', 'go', 'college']",N/A

I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film, but I can see why the reviews have been generally positive. Directors Phil Lord (Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs) and Chris Miller (Again Cloudy...) to a old TV show popular with teens and gave it a modern twist..... story by it's Executive Producer and Star Jonah Hill (Moneyball, Knocked Up) and Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) and its screenplay by Bacall it basically tell of stud and a nerd and everything that comes with each working against each other to eventually being best friends.Not taking itself too seriously it shows two police academy graduates being assigned a special undercover operation involving a high school. Jonah is partnered with Channing Tatum (Dear John, G.I. Joe, The Dilema) and they eventually realized they complement each other with their own personal special abilities.In the process they go through hilarious scenes involving ""accidental"" use of drugs, some wonderful high school tuxedos of the eighties and a running joke involving a series of questionable bikers that have one of the biggest TWISTS at the end of the film. (Spoilers!)Rob Riggle (The Hangover, The Other Guys) gives an over-the-top performance as a High School coach with `issues' and a phony front to students Dave France (Superbad, Fight Night) and Brie Larson (13 Going On 30, Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) who believe he is what he is.Meanwhile Channing and Jonah are guided by a over-zealous Police Captain played by Ice Cube (Fridays, First Sunday, Barber Shop) who thinks that this is a mission only they can handle because of the youthful looks - but will fail because - even together they are not so smart.The film has lots of comedy, action, adventure, close-calls and some very clever dialogue.....not to mention that `Spoiler' - I mentioned earlier....do you wanna know? Then read on. If not STOP HERE!Two original series regulars make an appearance in this reinvention of an 80's TV series (that by the way, makes fun of itself by commenting that all sargents do now is try and reboot old things from the 80's) - the real' 21 Jump Street' stars of the ORIGINAL series Johnny Depp (21 Jump Street, Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3), Richard Grieco (21 Jump Street ,Point Doom ) and Peter DeLouise (Seaquest, 21 Jump Street) have an amazingly funny came...that borders on `black comedy' because of what happens to them. I'll say no more.21 Jump Street is a funny film with a big heart. I enjoyed this very much and I think if you want legitimate comedy with a fantastic premise...this is your movie.

1373551,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003Y5H5B0,Mark Turner,"[6, 8]","Back in the 80s there was a TV series that helped kick off the new network known as FOX. It starred a bunch of new actors just getting noticed and featured them as policemen who went undercover in high school to fight crime among the younger generation. Among these actors was a guy named Johnny Depp who you may have heard of. Depp eventually left and the show finally finished but has developed a cult following. Enough of one that they apparently decided a remake in feature length format was warranted. But don't go in thinking this is the same old 21 JUMP STREET.Jonah Hill plays Schmidt, the smart, nerdy kid who wants to be liked so much so that he dies his hair blonde and cuts it to look like Eminem. Jenko (Channing Tatum) is his high school nemesis, the jock that doesn't think much and picks on the nerd. For one reason or another both find themselves unable to go to prom.Fast forward to find both of them applying to become policemen at the academy. They become friends and each uses their strengths to help the other one graduate. Thinking they'll be hitting the streets and stopping crime they're stunned to find themselves on bicycle duty. When they see a biker gang involved in a drug deal they think that will all change. It does but not the way they hoped. Having failed to read the criminals their Miranda rights, the only way to avoid being kicked out is to work in a special outfit.The Jump Street program is headed by tough as nails Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube). It takes youthful looking police officers and places them in high schools to fight crime. In this particular incident they're trying to find the supplier of a new drug in schools that's already resulted in one teen death. Now the two cops who didn't fare well in high school are going back.But things aren't like they were. The things that made Jenko popular are now frowned upon by the cool kids. And the nerdy things that Schmidt did are now making him popular. It gets even more twisted up when the duo get their undercover identities mixed up and Jenko is supposed to be the smart one while Schmidt is the jock! Couple that with the fact that the kids think Jenko looks much older than his ""age"" and you can see where this is going.What you end up with is a bit of a twist on the Odd Couple tossed in with an attempt by two twenty somethings trying to fit in. They must also find the dealers of the drugs and then follow up to see who their supplier is. Along the way they each have the chance to walk in the other's shoes from the past and with any luck will appreciate each other more after doing so.The movie is filled with the gross out or inappropriate humor Hill is becoming known for but not to the extent that it distracts from the story or hinders it (like happened with THE SITTER). The bonding between these two characters and the chance that it will unwind makes for an interesting film as does the chance for Schmidt to finally get the chance to have a decent high school experience. Except that he isn't a student and almost falls into the trap of getting too involved in his undercover identity.There are plenty of laughs and a few decent action sequences. My favorite laugh involved a chase scene where things that would normally explode in any other movie don't. In addition to the story laced with humor we get some decent cameos by members of the original series including Holly Peete Robinson, Peter DeLuise and Depp himself (though you'll never recognize him until he wants you to). It's not a bad movie and one I can actually see myself watching again down the line.

This time the producers take a popular show from the mid '80's that was a launching pad for Johnny Depp, who played a cop who goes undercover at a high school.  I never watched the show but it is my understanding it was played as a straight-ahead police drama but with teens in lead roles.  Smart for ratings.This time, while the overall plot is the same, it's played for laughs.  And it partially succeeds.  We're used to seeing Jonah Hill in comedic roles and he's always good.  Hunky co-star Channing Tatum has pretty much been in dance oriented flicks, dramas or action films so this is a step up (pun intended) in a new direction.  The two rookie cops were high school classmates 7 years earlier.  Jenko (Tatum) was a stud, but dumb.  Schmidt (Hill) was a geek and very smart.  In their new assignments, the principal gets their aliases confused (our cops also can't seem to remember what their undercover names are) and so they get the wrong schedule.  Oh yeah.  They're supposed to be brothers.With only 30 days left in the school year you would think these two could assimilate into the school and catch the drug dealers.  But even the supposedly smart one (Schmidt) manages to get in over his head.  I realize that each character is to have a second chance at finishing high school the right way, but really?  The film ends tidily and there are enough good laughs to give the film a modest recommendation.The Blu ray disc is just fine if not very colorful or explosive.  It has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is excellent in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is very immersive.

Directors Lord and Miller, of MTV's Clone High and the similarly way-better-than-you'd-expect Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, mix clear storytelling, energetic camerawork, and a sure grasp of both comedy and character beats. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, and Tatum in particular finally sheds the marble-mouthed stolidity of his earlier films to have some long-overdue fun.

1373579,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B003Y5H5B0,pastapadre,"[14, 18]","While 21 Jump Street is based on the popular '80s TV series it isn't a straight remake - rather it presents a modern day take on the concept of police officers infiltrating crime rings by going undercover within places like high schools. The film takes a much more comedic angle, while mixing some action in, and it all really works.Two inept cops - played by Jonah Hill (who also co-wrote the script) and Channing Tatum - get reassigned to the 21 Jump Street program and are tasked with finding and bringing down the supplier of a new synthetic drug.While they have become friends on the force in the past Jenko (Tatum) was the popular kid in high school while Schmidt (Hill) was the one who got picked on. Amusingly what represented ""popularity"" years before has changed and that throws a wrench into their expectations.Though their friendship is never completely established or entirely credible (maybe the only gripe I would have but ultimately an unnecessary one) there is a sense that the two genuinely like each other. How they play off one another, as they go through various experiences and challenges throughout the film, is flat out fun to watch. Basing their investigation on a fictional drug makes it especially hilarious as the characters and audience go along for the ride together learning about its effects and influence on events.Never having considered myself a fan of Channing Tatum he impressed with some great comedic timing - the movie was so good that it actually made me really like him. Meanwhile Jonah Hill brought exactly what one would expect out of him, Brie Larson was endearing as a love interest, and Ice Cube and Rob Riggle flat out stole some scenes. There are also some big payoffs in the way of cameos.21 Jump Street did a fantastic job of playing against expectations and cliches while providing some truly hilarious moments throughout. It's the funniest film I've seen since The Hangover - not only did it deliver all the laughs but it was more clever and simply a more complete movie. There isn't much more anyone could ask for out of 21 Jump Street and hopefully it's just the start of a franchise that would actually be deserving of one.",5,21 Jump Street is the funniest movie in years,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2179,"['21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'based', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', ""n't"", 'straight', 'remake', 'rather', 'modern', 'day', 'take', 'concept', 'police', 'officers', 'infiltrating', 'crime', 'rings', 'going', 'undercover', 'places', 'high', 'schools', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'comedic', 'angle', 'mixing', 'action', 'really', 'works.Two', 'inept', 'cops', 'played', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'get', 'reassigned', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'program', 'are', 'tasked', 'finding', 'bringing', 'down', 'supplier', 'new', 'synthetic', 'drug.While', 'have', 'become', 'friends', 'force', 'past', 'Jenko', 'Tatum', 'was', 'popular', 'kid', 'high', 'school', 'Schmidt', 'Hill', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'picked', 'Amusingly', 'what', 'represented', 'popularity', 'years', 'changed', 'wrench', 'friendship', 'never', 'completely', 'established', 'entirely', 'credible', 'maybe', 'only', 'gripe', 'would', 'have', 'ultimately', 'unnecessary', 'one', 'sense', 'two', 'genuinely', 'other', 'How', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'go', 'various', 'experiences', 'challenges', 'film', 'flat', 'out', 'fun', 'watch', 'Basing', 'investigation', 'fictional', 'drug', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'audience', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'together', 'learning', 'effects', 'influence', 'events.Never', 'having', 'considered', 'fan', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'impressed', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'actually', 'made', 'really', 'Meanwhile', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'brought', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'was', 'endearing', 'love', 'interest', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'flat', 'out', 'stole', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'payoffs', 'way', 'cameos.21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'expectations', 'cliches', 'providing', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'funniest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hangover', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'deliver', 'laughs', 'was', 'more', 'clever', 'simply', 'more', 'complete', 'movie', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'hopefully', 'just', 'start', 'franchise', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'deserving', 'one']",N/A

Usually not a big fan of remaking classic movies but they did a good job with 21 Jump Street. I know its not a strict remake but more of a sequel in that the characters are fresh and new but it will always be compared to the original. I do think the original is the better of the two but watching both provides good entertainment. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill do a great job. The two actors worked well together and really fed off each other to make a very funny movie. The supporting case was great. Rob Riggle was hilarious as usual. Dave Franco was great as well. Ice Cube was probably my favorite character, aside from &#34;Korean Jesus&#34; (you will get it once you watch it). The one lacking part of the movie I thought was the love story. Obviously you have to tone it down considering the main characters pretend to go back to high school but it felt a little forced. Ellie Kemper as the teacher swooning over Tatum's character was pretty funny. But Jonah Hill and Brie Larson did not click for me on screen.Overall I would recommend that you go and check it out.

It's still a good movie though.I liked how they made a lot of jokes and the actors didn't try to hard to make it funny. I like how there were twisted to how kids today are somewhat different than kids in the 90 let say. Example from the movie was that acting smart or being smart wasn't very cool back then. But, now it's seen as okay. Also, there was a part in the movie where Channing Tatum said he was wearing skinny jenes. Yes, today that is what the cool kids wear. ha ha But, back then, you probably just get beat up for that. Back then it was all about the baggy style jenes. The more baggy the better. I remember there was even a filing system like baggy, baggier, and baggiest! Very comfortable comparable to skinny jenes. ha haI would had like the film to show more of what could had been and what else that happened. I would had liked to see Channing Tatum character develop more with the chemistry teacher. Also with Joah Hill character, I'd like to know if Hill could had keep on seeing the H.S. girl after graduating. Then, there was the situation with the H.S. boy that was friends with Hill character. What happened to him after he got caught? He just goes to jail and that's it? Shouldn't he got off a bit easier? He was lower level dealer and was con into selling the stuff by the supplier.

Therefore, I was pretty interested to see how they were going to connect this movies to the precursor. The creators definitely deviated drastically from the original, but this does not mean that we got a film that is undeserving of praise. On the contrary, I found myself watching a production that had me laughing out loud and causing others in the plane to look my way to check if I was unstable.When Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return to high school as undercover agents, things had changed from the times when they were students. Jonah used to be the nerd and Channing the stud, but the new environment has turned things on their head. This of course provides with plenty of opportunities to create hilarious situations, and those opportunities are not wasted. The fact that the two main actors can deliver comedy at the highest level definitely helps in this regard.Besides the fine humor, I thoroughly enjoyed Ice Cube's performance. He plays the role of supervisor of the undercover group and his over the top acting goes well with that role. But maybe one of the finest ""jokes"" in the movie has to do with the link to the old series.

The surprise isn't that it goes bad but how it goes bad: Tatum's character, ""Jenko"", is the typical dumb cool kid jock who seemingly had everything that all the nerds wanted in HS while Hill's character, ""Schmidt"", was the smart fat loser kid.  As the two get out of their car and re-enter the world of HS almost 7 years afterward, posing as brothers, Jenko rides Schmidt for wearing his backpack using both straps instead of just one slung over the side a la the cool kids.  ""I don't want to be seen with you, man, you don't wear your bag like that!""  But as they walk along the camera shows you all of the cool kids, the jocks and preppies and rich kids and clubbers, are all wearing their backpacks with both straps on.  Jenko, bewildered, scratches his head, ""What is this, man?""  As they walk past more groups that aren't cool (the goths, the stoners, and even a small chirp of Japanese girls dressed in cosplay whom Jenko acknowledges, ""I don't even know what they are!"") Jenko drops his jaw as they are all single-slinging it.  Schmidt, with a big grin, is avenged.  As with much of this movie everything for the partners is turned inside-out, upside down.It is moments like this that make this film an enjoyable comedy.  It is the updated, fish-out-of-water notions that are well and wisely played here that offer up the biggest laughs.  The preoccupation with jokes concerning male genitalia and some of the more routine odd-couple buddy cop comedies are nicely played if nothing new.  The cameos of our heroes from the original television series (but where was Aoki? and Fuller?) are fun and even surprising (DeLuise is almost unrecognizable and I completely missed Richard Grieco) and will only add to the enjoyment of those of us who remember the original series with some fondness.

1373644,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B003Y5H5B0,Todd Bartholomew,"[3, 3]","I had low expectations for ""21 Jump Street"" and wondered to myself why you would make a 1980s Fox drama into a movie, as the television series was something of a stretch to begin with.  There've been so many terrible remakes/reworkings of old TV shows that I wondered why you'd bother, but ""21 Jump Street"" does take some liberties with the original and toys with the formula a bit.  It's the combination of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum that drives the movie as the two really click and do so masterfully right from the start and maintain it throughout.  The script is also hilarious with many in-jokes that poke fun at the obviously ridiculous premise of these two twenty-somethings trying to pass themselves off as high school students.  The choice of Ice Cube to play Captain Dickson was similarly brilliant as he brings a manic intensity to the role.  Hill and Tatum are transferred to Jump Street to try and infiltrate a high school drug ring and what unfolds is often hilarious and never dull, with a lively mix of humor and action.  There's no ridiculous overuse of CGI here, just Hill and Tatum going through a series of false starts, mishaps, and mistakes.  I won't give away how the movie concludes, but there's a wonderful homage to the original cast in a cameo that was a mix of gruesome and hilarious.  There wasn't a second of this movie that dragged and it was probably one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen all year.

1373645,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003Y5H5B0,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","I used to watch the TV show 21 Jump Street, and while it was clever, I didn't think it was anything special. When I heard they were making a movie, it peeked my interest, but the previews made it look like it would be God awful, in one of the worst marketing campaigns for a film I've ever seen. After hearing some good things from friends and being that it had a good cast, I decided to give the film a shot and it far exceeded my expectations. Two of the dumbest and most immature cops on the force are sent on an undercover mission to infiltrate a local High School and find out where a new designer drug is coming from. Right from the start you could tell the film would lean more to the comedic side as opposed to the show, which was more dramatic. Going the comedic way, especially with the cast they had, was the right way to go, but much of the film was still unbelievable. Anyone who believes that either Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum could even come close to passing for High School student are completely out of their minds. Also, the speed in which these two idiots went from being the worst cops on the force to celebrated heroes was ridiculous. It would have been far more enjoyable if these guys just sorta stumbled into solving the crime, rather than all of a sudden becoming great cops. As for the cast, Jonah Hill continues to be the most underrated comedic actor in Hollywood. I have yet to see this guy do a bad movie. Channing Tatum was pretty good too, he's known more for his looks than his talent, but he fit his role extremely well. It was probably written specifically for his persona, similar to his role in Magic Mike, but he still is very good. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Dave Franco, the younger and better looking brother of James Franco, who for the very first time shows that he is more than just a kid, getting work because of his brother. He was very solid and perhaps the most believable and likeable character in this film. 21 Jump Street is nothing new, it's another cop movie that blends comedy and action, like almost every other Lethal Weapon wannabe. The story isn't better than the rest, but it is funnier than most of the other films and it has some terrific cameos.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,2218,"['used', 'watch', 'TV', 'show', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'was', 'clever', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'anything', 'special', 'When', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'peeked', 'interest', 'previews', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'God', 'awful', 'one', 'worst', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hearing', 'good', 'things', 'friends', 'being', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'Two', 'dumbest', 'most', 'immature', 'cops', 'force', 'are', 'sent', 'undercover', 'mission', 'infiltrate', 'local', 'High', 'School', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'new', 'designer', 'drug', 'coming', 'Right', 'start', 'could', 'tell', 'film', 'would', 'lean', 'more', 'comedic', 'side', 'opposed', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Going', 'comedic', 'way', 'especially', 'cast', 'had', 'was', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'unbelievable', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'could', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'passing', 'High', 'School', 'student', 'are', 'completely', 'minds', 'Also', 'speed', 'two', 'idiots', 'went', 'being', 'worst', 'cops', 'force', 'celebrated', 'heroes', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'guys', 'just', 'sorta', 'stumbled', 'solving', 'crime', 'rather', 'sudden', 'becoming', 'great', 'cops', 'cast', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'be', 'most', 'underrated', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'guy', 'do', 'bad', 'movie', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'known', 'more', 'looks', 'talent', 'fit', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'probably', 'written', 'specifically', 'persona', 'similar', 'role', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Finally', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'younger', 'better', 'looking', 'brother', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'just', 'kid', 'getting', 'work', 'brother', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'perhaps', 'most', 'believable', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'nothing', 'new', 'cop', 'movie', 'comedy', 'action', 'almost', 'other', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'wannabe', 'story', ""n't"", 'better', 'rest', 'funnier', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'terrific', 'cameos']",N/A

1373647,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B003Y5H5B0,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[22, 28]","Be real. When you first heard that Jonah Hill was planning to remake 1980s era, Stephen Cannell produced cop series, 21 Jump Street, you probably scoffed and wrote it off immediately. You wouldn't be alone, and the reaction isn't without justification. Helping to launch the career of Johnny Depp and being the highlight for others like Holly Robinson and Richard Grieco, the show was ridiculous on its face, centered on a special crime unit of youthful looking adults infiltrating colleges and high schools.  Frankly, the show was more cool than good, and neither by the final season. Fortunately, Jonah Hill and writer Michael Bacall knew there was no reason to revere the source material, deciding to go for something akin to Superbad meets Police Academy. It was a gamble, but a gamble that paid off as 21 Jump Street isn't just hilarious, it's a modern day comedy classic.Achieving the heights of hilarity that 21 Jump Street does couldn't have been accomplished by simply bringing the same old tired idea and plopping it onto the big screen. Too many other attempted remakes have made that mistake, thinking adding a few modern wrinkles will suffice. High school is nothing like it was twenty years ago. The social dynamics are different, the students are different, and the idea of who should be popular has experienced quite a shift. Setting up the change beautifully, we are first introduced to Morton Schmidt(Hill) and Greg Jenko(Channing Tatum) in high school, where Morton is an nerd doing his best Eminem impression, while Greg is the prototypical popular jock stud.Fast forward a few years and both are enrolling in the police training program, and both are terrible for reasons the other can compensate for.  Greg becomes the brawn, and Morton the  brains. After proving they don't have what it takes to handle the rough 'n tumble beat as bike cops, they are unceremoniously dumped into a rehashed program to use young looking cops as undercover agents in high schools. Wearing a sense of self awareness on its sleeve, the film takes a few jabs at itself for being a warmed over rehash as well, up to and including the use of Ice Cube as the token angry, African-American police captain. Cube, who has become an expert at playing off his old N.W.A. persona, is in rare form here, snarling and sneering at every opportunity. If there's a scene stealer, it's him.When it comes to comedy, it's the little details that matter the most are often the funniest. Greg is hyped for an opportunity to go back to high school and be the popular guy again, while Morton is justifiably terrified of reliving those traumatic years. What they discover upon arrival is that the entire culture is different. Greg's bullying antics make him a loner, while Morton's brains and gentle nature earn him cred with the cool kids, which he uses to try and infiltrate their drug ring.  In a lot of ways, 21 Jump Street has smarter insights into the ways teens think than some documentaries dedicated to the subject. You know from the start that Greg is going to get drunk off his new found popularity, and while it plays out like something out of Can't Buy Me Love, it works.Insightful thought it may be, there's plenty of room for gross out gags, penis jokes, and toilet humor. Hill is old hat at this type of thing by now, although it's unfair to say he's playing the same role here. His character is a little less self confident than usual, and not at all the miscreant he played in Superbad. Tatum, a better actor than many want to give him credit for, shows an affinity for physical comedy we haven't seen from him before. It's hilarious to watch his blank, clearly confused face as the world he thought he knew is flipped upside down. Even more so, he's a ball to watch leaping over cars and beating up rowdy teenagers. The jokes at his expense, since he clearly has the body of a thirty year old man and towers over everybody, are some the film's best. Tatum seems more than willing to roll with the punches and cut loose. For the most part, the supporting cast shines as well. Bridesmaids co-star Ellie Kemper is equal parts sweet and filthy as a teacher with a Mary Kay Leternou style obsession with Tatum. Dave Franco doesn't have much to do, but Brie Larson gives a winning performance as Molly, the girl who falls for Hill's charms.With so much attention focused on Hill, Tatum, and Bacall, it's easy to forget that the glue holding this madcap adventure together are directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Their only gig up to this point was the animated Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and you can see they brought some of the comic madness of that film into 21 Jump Street. The action sequences, of which there are plenty, are fast paced and splashed with a little bit of Looney Tunes wackiness.You don't have to have been a fan of the show to appreciate this 21 Jump Street, but if you were then the film will feel even more special. Cameos are sprinkled throughout, including one especially brilliant appearance special for 'Jump Street' die-hards. There's practically nothing this film gets wrong. Even the closing credits rock. If there's one thing that they can do to screw this up it's making us wait too long for a sequel.",4,Review: '21 Jump Street',1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,5234,"['Be', 'real', 'When', 'first',

While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because ""the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago"". Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is clich&eacute;, is fantastic.

1373649,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003Y5H5B0,Turfseer,"[3, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by.

The trouble is, they are all very predictable and evidence that this genre of film (begun by ""Superbad"") may be beginning to die.For a basic plot summary, this film sees two rookie cops given an undercover assignment back in their old high school.  Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the high school loser now turned cooler, while Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the high-profile jock who now has trouble reclaiming that identity.Like I said, there are a few genuinely funny moments in this movie.  Unfortunately, they are very few and far between.  This type of comedy has been made so many times that it is almost as if the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.It doesn't help that Jonah Hill's ""trying to escape adolescence"" character might be starting to wear thin after a number of similar flicks.  In all fairness, he does provide probably the funniest gags of the film, but it just isn't quite as funny as it used to be.And then, of course, there is Channing Tatum.  Women will likely give this film a full star higher rating just by looking at his sculpted physique.  Men, on the other hand, will probably be more likely to recognize how wooden he can be at times.  He isn't a total loss, but he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards anytime soon.Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" is the typical crude, profane, & stupid comedy seen a million times since ""Superbad"" had such great success.
