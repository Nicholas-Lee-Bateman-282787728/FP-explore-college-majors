Missed this tour (sold out before I even found out about the date, and actually had tickets for the aborted Schenker-Roth-West tour!) Michael's concert dvd output has been as sketchy as his up and down career, so I approached this new one with a little trepidation. But WOW! WOW! WOW! In fact, I tried to form the word WOW several times watching this incredible show but couldn't due to my jaw continually dropping to the floor. At sixty years of age, Michael's playing now is not only unbelievable, but at some points on this show even better than the old days. It's all there (again): the dexterity, the tone, the phrasing, the melodic structure of the solos, the fills. The playing here rivals even ""Strangers in the Night"", generally considered one of UFO's finest performances as well as one of the great 70's live albums - and in light of the rumors that that album is a bit of a cut-and-paste affair, this performance is particularly amazing). 'Rock Bottom', though, is the album highlight, Michael's solo slowly building to a crescendo of speed and precision that literally left me wanting to get up off the couch and bow to the TV. Another highlight of the dvd is the fact that the drumming and bass duties are handled by two of the original Scorpions members (original if you don't count ""Lonesome Crow"", that is), so it's nice to hear Michael rip into all the songs he recorded with them for the ""Lovedrive"" album. Other than that, it's pretty evenly divided between Michael's solo material, UFO songs and a couple of tunes from the new album. But, it's Michael's playing throughout this show that is simply stunning, and his return to form is revelatory. Additionally, the sound quality (5.1 DTS!!!) is just fantastic!! Don't miss this!",5,Melted my face off!!!,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1839,"['next', 'best', 'thing', 'being', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'be', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'Missed', 'tour', 'sold', 'out', 'even', 'found', 'out', 'date', 'actually', 'had', 'tickets', 'aborted', 'Schenker-Roth-West', 'tour', 'Michael', 'concert', 'dvd', 'output', 'been', 'as', 'sketchy', 'up', 'down', 'career', 'approached', 'new', 'one', 'little', 'trepidation', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'fact', 'tried', 'form', 'word', 'WOW', 'several', 'times', 'watching', 'incredible', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'due', 'jaw', 'continually', 'dropping', 'floor', 'sixty', 'years', 'age', 'Michael', 'playing', 'now', 'not', 'only', 'unbelievable', 'points', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'old', 'days', 'there', 'again', 'dexterity', 'tone', 'phrasing', 'melodic', 'structure', 'solos', 'fills', 'playing', 'here', 'even', 'Strangers', 'Night', 'generally', 'considered', 'one', 'UFO', 'finest', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'great', '70', 'live', 'albums', 'light', 'rumors', 'album', 'bit', 'cut-and-paste', 'affair', 'performance', 'particularly', 'amazing', 'Bottom', 'album', 'highlight', 'Michael', 'solo', 'slowly', 'building', 'crescendo', 'speed', 'precision', 'literally', 'left', 'wanting', 'get', 'up', 'couch', 'bow', 'TV', 'highlight', 'dvd', 'fact', 'drumming', 'bass', 'duties', 'are', 'handled', 'two', 'original', 'Scorpions', 'members', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Lonesome', 'Crow', 'nice', 'hear', 'Michael', 'rip', 'songs', 'recorded', 'Lovedrive', 'album', 'Other', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'divided', 'Michael', 'solo', 'material', 'UFO', 'songs', 'couple', 'tunes', 'new', 'album', 'Michael', 'playing', 'show', 'simply', 'stunning', 'return', 'form', 'revelatory', 'Additionally', 'sound', 'quality', '5.1', 'DTS', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

I love Michael's playing all the way back to UFO and I really like Doogie Whites work with Rainbow and Cornerstone, but I'm not sure what happened here. Did he have a stroke or something? His annunciation of the words in the lyrics was bad, like he was slurring the lines. It really detracted from the great performance of the rest of band. Schenker was on fire, playing flawlessly! I really think Schenker should have just used Michael Voss for all the vocals as i think he was a much better fit and I like the fact that there would have been 3 great lead guitarists on stage! The other thing wrong with this DVD is that I wished there would have been more songs from the MSG catalog. I could have done without some of the Scorpions songs, like Coast to Coast, which is really boring.",3,"Great band, but what happened to Doogie???",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,823,"[""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'real', 'here', 'love', 'Michael', 'playing', 'way', 'back', 'UFO', 'really', 'Doogie', 'Whites', 'work', 'Rainbow', 'Cornerstone', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'Did', 'have', 'stroke', 'something', 'annunciation', 'words', 'lyrics', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'slurring', 'lines', 'really', 'detracted', 'great', 'performance', 'rest', 'band', 'Schenker', 'was', 'fire', 'playing', 'flawlessly', 'really', 'think', 'Schenker', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'used', 'Michael', 'Voss', 'vocals', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'fit', 'like', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'been', '3', 'great', 'lead', 'guitarists', 'stage', 'other', 'thing', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'wished', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'songs', 'MSG', 'catalog', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Scorpions', 'songs', 'Coast', 'Coast', 'really', 'boring']",N/A

The constant among all of the concerts is Michael Schenker's tremendous guitar prowess and dedication to his craft. Temple of Rock is fantastic and I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for that clear, crisp, audio and video that the DVD just can't quite provide.
