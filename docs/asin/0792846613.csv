Happy catchy tunes and cute characters.Inclusion of bad character(s) teaches the child to recognize and how to navigate through an undesirable situation through cooperation - not isolation.Recommended for 3+ year olds. Watched this as an adult with my nieces/nephews in the late 80s/ early 90s and loved it myself.

So I'm going to forget all the revisionist junk about product placement and get to my review of the actual content. The Care Bears are a community of bears who live literally in the clouds in a kingdom call Carealot. This story is about two characters;two abandoned children named Kim and Jason who the Care Bears are trying to bring back to a state of joy.The other is a bungling magicians assistant named Nicholas who falls under the influence of an evil spirit that lives in a spell book,who tries to manipulate Nicholas to do it's evil bidding. Once they're convinced Kim and Jason end up having to help the Care Bears as the spirit works overtime to destroy Carealot and humanity's kind spirit in general. In the end the plot gets really interesting and almost Shakesperean in a kids cartoon sense;Nicholas,the villian of the story doesn't get destroyed.The Care Bears convince him he was never a failure and doesn't need to take his insecurities out on the world. Funny thing is I didn't really get any of this until I re-watched this as a teenager. It was the 90's and the culture of the day was rejected what the Care Bears represented,prefering to lump with with a decade my generation wanted badly to reject. To be honest many people I knew as a teen ended up a lot like Nicholas lol. Especially some of the ""faux"" goth kids. With some people I was looking for the evil magic book.

156877,A2C1NPEX2UORHT,0792846613,A Reviewer,"[3, 4]",This is what made me love the Care Bears! I liked the second movie a little better but this one was cute too. As a Christian I noticed that both movies have some occultish undertones but I don't think it's anything too bad. All in all it was a cute and fun movie and I liked all the songs.PSI decided to respond to some of the reviews about the bad guys. I think this goes to the heart of what the Care Bears of the 80's were supposed to be about. They weren't made to be some cutesy claptrap like today but about a good vs evil theme with some morals thrown in. It was the villains that made Care Bears so great. As far as showing it to kids of 2 - 3 it might not be a good idea simply because they won't understand it very well. I see no reason why older kids like 5 - 8 can't watch it. I think the big problem is that some parents just want to shelter their kids. Now exposing your child to cartoons like South Park is not what I'm suggesting but come on!

156879,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0792846613,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","well, I wasn't born an English Major, and in younger days, I did fall under the spell of the Care Bears. In some ways, this movie exposes the 90 + % of the shoot em up filth that comes out in the movies today.the movie starts with Mr. Cherrywood telling the story of the Care Bears to put some children to sleep. He is voiced very well by Mickey Rooney. (Some of you may know that Rooney did Puck in an older version of ""Midsummer Night's Dream."" As an English Major I had to point that out.)the story revolves around a magicians assistant named Nicholas. Basically, Nicholas tries, but is never quite good enough. As a result, he is under appreciated and this is where trouble begins. He finds an old magic book with a malignant force inside it. With a little persuasion from this dark force, Nicholas turns dark.I'm not sure even the writers of this film knew what they stumbled on.  Some of the darkest villains in Shakespeare such as Edmund from ""King Lear"" could fall into this category. Like some of the superb villains in Shakespeare, theonly joy Nicholas can get is from destroying the happiness of others. (To be sure, he was urged on by the malignant force, but the grounds were already set.)Well, this is where our heroes come in. The Care Bears are concerned that the 'care Meter' is down and they realize what is up. I will admit the story does drag now and then, but this is infinitely more tolerable than filling the time with people getting shot as action movies tend to do.  There are plenty of songs on a childhood level, but they do have their charm.Later, Nicholas starts to have 2nd thoughts about what he is doing. This movie seems to know something Hollywood never will. Once you take a step towards revenge, it does NOT end so easily. Once you take a step towards revenge, you will probably end up taking it to the point where you hurt people who had NOTHING TO DO with what you suffered. While Nicholas grows dark, we never quite forget that he is a human being. Well, the Care Bears do what they can to show Nicholas that he is cared about and this seems to reawaken his conscience. It seems that Hollywood often prefers to just shoot a villain. Well, the reality is that it is easy to pick up a gun and shoot someone. It is NOT EASY to convince someone that he is cared about.The CARE BEARS are WAY MORE HEROIC than Hollywood's fake heroes who try to outdo each other with bigger guns. The Care Bears also emphasize that redemption and reconciliation are more to be sought than revenge. Wouldn't we rather Nicholas redeem himself than be blown up?There is a special surprise end that I won't give away. But it isn't too hard to suspect. While I hold ""Time to Kill"" as one of the most vile disgusting piece of filth I have ever seen, I hold the ""Care Bears Movie"" as one of the most profound redeeming movies I have ever seen.

Ream ""xdelusion""","[1, 1]","Ok, first off let me mention that I grew up with this stuff in the 80's, and the Care Bears have always annoyed me, as there is only room in my heart for one Bear and that's the Poo, none the less I found this first movie actually enjoyable when I watched it as it played with the whole theme of a good natured character is faced and tempted with Evil like he has never encountered before and which of course tests him to great ends!It is stories like these, like Star Wars (classic), like the old Disney films, etc. Stories in which the comedy is not dependant upon a knowldege of the topical pop culture and ""issues"" of the main stream media of the time and country in which it was made. Stories in which the characters did not have to reflect Consumer Culture, Vanity, the aspiration to be a self proclaimed Diva/Princess/Brat. Stories that were very basic, very close to the human experience, to the heart, and to what makes a human......humn, to be quite plain and simple. Which is kind of shocking considering that this film was designed to make kids mindlessly salibate for the toys, which makes one wonder,""is it really the toys that are so appealing, the pieces of gender altering plastic, or is it the conditioning of being raised in a co-depentant, shop for happiness, the mall is the meca, consumer based families and societies?"" You just got to ask yourself.Which brings me to my second point. What is with all the bashing of this film like it is special in that it is a marketting campain for a toy? What is new? Movies have been used as adverts for products for a very very very long time, worse yet, media in general has been used not only for selling the slave labour toys and prodcuts made from ""developing nations"" for our children and for ourselves, but also the fact that media, musick, movies, etc. Are used to con the masses into idealogies which lead to mass murder, opression, indentured servitude, etc. Yet no one seems to be awake to this idea even though the concept is as old as the celluloid it is made upon if not older...Besides it's like singling out that one pop singer for lip syncing on SNL and the Orange Bowl or what ever. Why single out one egg, when the whole carton is bad?!!??!?!Again, regardless of being a marketting tool, it delivers a wholesome message, so for once in my life I will say commerciallism in this instance is far from mindless, and far from harmful nationalistic or relgious propagana, just pure, simpl fun!

After this, the animal friends are known as  the Care Bear Cousins, and they help the Care Bears care about people on  Earth.

I can understand why some reviewers think it's too scary for younger kids. The evil spirit is pretty scary, so young kids might be a little freaked out. I was about four or so when I first saw this. Being a Care Bear fanatic since birth, I had no problems with it.I give the movie five stars, but I give the DVD itself three. I was very disappointed in the bonus feature, ""Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine."" Not many people know this about ""Freeze Machine,"" but it was a half hour TV special in 1984, which the PTE (Powers That Be) butchered it to turn it into an episode of the Care Bears Family TV series. Why do I say they butchered it? The original begining credits were cut out, and the original credits were one of the cutest Care Bear songs in history: Hugs and Tugs' duet, ""I Wanna Be a Care Bear"" (which is actually the theme to the DIC Care Bears series, but I digress). I grew up with the uncut ""Freeze Machine"" and I was pretty ticked off when I found it edited.But other than that, this is one of my all time favorite movies. If you are a Care Bear fanatic, you'll love it. My advice to those who have young children, use your best judgement.

156891,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,0792846613,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[4, 7]","Ah, The Care Bears, one of the more popular  cartoon characters in the mid 80's next  to ""The Transformers"", ""He-Man"" and othercartoons.However, unlike these other two classics,  ""The Care Bears"" would have a somewhat  short run. They would fall into the category  of a forgotten fad, because no one nowadayseven knows or even has heard of them, unlike  ""Transformers"" and ""He-Man"" which are still  popular even today in 2003.  The Care Bears were the product of Nelvana Entertainment/Unlimited who rode the profitable  merchandise of the characters till their  demise.The movie itself (I've watched it a couple  of times for nostalgic reasons) isn't  that bad at all. The only thing aboutthe movie is the Care Bears message  about friendship and caring is something  unheard today, in todays greedy corporateand selfish lives, and the ""every man  for himself"" mentality.The movie deals with the Care Bears having  to deal with a boy named Nicholas, who  has dreams of becoming a great magician(he is simply an apprentice) who wants  to have alot of friends. However, things  go wrong with Nicholas's magic act, which  end up with alot of kids laughing at him.Nicholas, does not take this well, and  stumbles upon a magic book that is inhibited  by an evil spirit who promises Nicholasthat will have great power and wizandry  for him (kind of like the evil version  of Harry Potter. lol).The spirit convinces Nicholas to set her  free by saying that Nicholas will have  many friends because of his powers, orhave the ability to ruin everyone else's  lives on earth.Meanwhile , TenderHeart Bear, sees what's  going on and tries to warn the other Care  Bears about what's happening, but it's too  late. The spirit breaks through, and unleashesalot of havoc and uncaring around the world.This has alot of repercusion as ""Care Alot""  land, the land of the Care Bears becomes  almost destroyed, including the CareMeter, which measures the caring of the world.  As one Care Bears puts, when the meter  reaches zero, no one in the world will care.So Care Bears, and two orphans Kim and  Jason, who have become the Care Bears  friends, work together to stop Nicholasand his evil spirit friend.The animation for the movie, is pretty  good, considering that the Care Bears  tv series was just a kiddy show. However,the animators did a pretty good job, doing  alot of things with the movie that they  obviously couldn't do with the budget ofthe tv series.There are also a couple of nice twists  in the movie, like when a couple  of Care Bears get stuck in an alternate  universe in between Care Bear Land and Earth.  The voices are not that bad either including  Mickey Rooney for one.All in all ""The Care Bears Movie"" is not  bad at all, definitely alot better than  those other cheap movies based on kids  tv series (like Might Morphin Powers Ranger,or as like to call the Mighty Retard PowerRangers).Definitely recommended for kids.",5,Care Bears Movie Great for Kids,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,2924,"['Ah', 'Care', 'Bears', 'one', 'more', 'popular', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'mid', '80', 'next', 'Transformers', 'He-Man', 'othercartoons.However', 'other', 'two', 'classics', 'Care', 'Bears', 'would', 'have', 'somewhat', 'short', 'run', 'would', 'fall', 'category', 'forgotten', 'fad', 'one', 'nowadayseven', 'even', 'heard', 'Transformers', 'He-Man', 'are', 'still', 'popular', 'even', 'today', '2003', 'Care', 'Bears', 'were', 'product', 'Nelvana', 'Entertainment/Unlimited', 'who', 'rode', 'profitable', 'merchandise', 'characters', 'till', 'demise.The', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'couple', 'times', 'nostalgic', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'bad', 'only', 'thing', 'aboutthe', 'movie', 'Care', 'Bears', 'message', 'friendship', 'caring', 'something', 'unheard', 'today', 'todays', 'greedy', 'corporateand', 'selfish', 'lives', 'man', 'mentality.The', 'movie', 'deals', 'Care', 'Bears', 'having', 'deal', 'boy', 'named', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'great', 'magician', 'simply', 'apprentice', 'who', 'have', 'alot', 'friends', 'However', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Nicholas', 'magic', 'act', 'end', 'up', 'alot', 'kids', 'laughing', 'him.Nicholas', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'magic', 'book', 'inhibited', 'evil', 'spirit', 'who', 'Nicholasthat', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'power', 'wizandry', 'kind', 'evil', 'version', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'lol', 'spirit', 'convinces', 'Nicholas', 'set', 'free', 'saying', 'Nicholas', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'powers', 'orhave', 'ability', 'ruin', 'everyone', 'else', 'lives', 'earth.Meanwhile', 'TenderHeart', 'Bear', 'what', 'going', 'tries', 'warn', 'other', 'Care', 'Bears', 'what', 'happening', 'too', 'late', 'spirit', 'breaks', 'unleashesalot', 'havoc', 'uncaring', 'world.This', 'alot', 'repercusion', 'Care', 'Alot', 'land', 'land', 'Care', 'Bears', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'including', 'CareMeter', 'caring', 'world', 'one', 'Care', 'Bears', 'when', 'meter', 'zero', 'one', 'world', 'will', 'care.So', 'Care', 'Bears', 'two', 'orphans', 'Kim', 'Jason', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'Care', 'Bears', 'work', 'together', 'stop', 'Nicholasand', 'evil', 'spirit', 'friend.The', 'animation', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'Care', 'Bears', 'tv', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'kiddy', 'show', 'However', 'animators', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'alot', 'things', 'movie', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'budget', 'ofthe', 'tv', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'nice', 'twists', 'movie', 'when', 'couple', 'Care', 'Bears', 'get', 'stuck', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Care', 'Bear', 'Land', 'Earth', 'voices', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'including', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'one.All', 'Care', 'Bears', 'Movie', 'not', 'bad', 'definitely', 'better', 'other', 'cheap', 'movies', 'based', 'kids', 'tv', 'series', 'Might', 'Morphin', 'Powers', 'Ranger', 'call', 'Mighty', 'Retard', 'PowerRangers', '.Definitely', 'recommended', 'kids']",N/A

The eighties, when the Care Bears first came out (when I grew up!)... I don't know what they've done to them today. I checked out one of the new Care Bears movies, and it was just weird. I think it was the animation. They do NOT need to ""modernize"" the Care Bears. They changed them from drawn to computer animation and they just looked so freaky! So... wrong! Just because it's 25 years later doesn't mean they HAVE to change, does it? Things like SpongeBob are flat and he is pretty popular. (Has anyone seen the My Little Ponies on the shelves these days? They've gotten kind of weird looking too.)Anyway. If you want to watch the Care Bears, THIS is the movie you want. I used to watch the TV show too, but I don't really remember that all that well. I do remember that the evil book lady in this movie scared me to death when I was 5 years old. Especially that scene at the end. She's still kind of scary, really. All she does is say a few mean words and all of a sudden all the kids have dark circles under their eyes and turn into creeps. And there's nothing you can do about it! I always found it interesting that Nicolas could read her book. There's not an English word in it. Ish Kabibble. Haha!I'd definitely recommend this movie, though. I remembered this movie with such fondness that I had to buy it as an adult the instant I found out it was available on DVD!The sequel is an excellent movie as well. The only problem is it doesn't really make sense with the first movie. In the first, The Care Bears and the Cousins meet in the middle of the movie. But in the second, they grow up together as cubs. So it's like the second takes place first, and they forgot the others existed (they were separated into Care-A-Lot and the Forest of Feelings).

With great voice acting, including Mickey Rooney as the narrator, Mr. Cherrywood, this is a special treat that will warm your heart and make you laugh.The opening song was written and sung by the great Carole King.  It sets the stage for what the Care Bears are all about.  In their clouds and rainbow filled Care-A-Lot, they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend.  Little stars flit about and help them.The story is about a magician's assistant named Nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit.  Nicholas has always felt lonely.  The evil spirit takes advantage of that, and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring.  This is almost too much for the gentle Care Bears.  Luckily, they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the Forest of Feelings with other cute critters.There are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful.  As far as this being a feature-length commercial, the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more Care Bear Cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge.  But that is minor.My husband even loved this movie and was humming along at the closing song!",4,Care-A-Lot Is A Place We All Can Go . . .,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,1290,"['Care', 'Bears', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'including', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'narrator', 'Mr.', 'Cherrywood', 'special', 'treat', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'make', 'laugh.The', 'opening', 'song', 'was', 'written', 'sung', 'great', 'Carole', 'King', 'stage', 'what', 'Care', 'Bears', 'are', 'clouds', 'rainbow', 'filled', 'Care-A-Lot', 'look', 'down', 'see', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'stopped', 'caring', 'need', 'friend', 'Little', 'stars', 'flit', 'help', 'them.The', 'story', 'magician', 'assistant', 'named', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'magic', 'book', 'evil', 'spirit', 'Nicholas', 'always', 'felt', 'lonely', 'evil', 'spirit', 'advantage', 'pawn', 'scheme', 'get', 'world', 'stop', 'caring', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'gentle', 'Care', 'Bears', 'Luckily', 'get', 'help', 'kind', 'lion', 'who', 'Forest', 'Feelings', 'other', 'cute', 'are', 'lots', 'cute', 'songs', 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'touching', 'delightful', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'feature-length', 'commercial', 'only', 'thing', 'smacks', 'commercialism', 'when', 'more', 'more', 'Care', 'Bear', 'Cousins', 'keep', 'popping', 'woodwork', 'character', 'development', 'dialouge', 'minor.My', 'husband', 'even', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'humming', 'along', 'closing', 'song']",N/A

I have to say they're really addicting to watch. She loves them and has about 30 of them which she plays with them by having a Care Bear Conference and it's no suprise she loves this movie. I've always been a fan of Mickey Rooney and he was wonderful in this film. This story follows the care bears as they battle an evil spirt who has tricked a boy named Nicolas into destroying all the caring in the world. They encounter the care bear cousins as they search for the two remaining children who care in the world. The story teaches lids about caring and loving and it is a great movie for children.

There are some scary parts. The core story is about a boy named Nicolas who is essentially possessed by an evil spirit in a magic book. If your children are sensitive to scary things, I would recommend that you watch it first, just to be sure.

These two were landmarks for me because I really feel I put more effort into them. I got down to the nitty gritty of the products based on other customer reviews as well at my own findings. Hope you my reader will approve. I noticed that this one got 2 out of 3 posstive approvals.There it was just lying on a Best Buy shelf, waiting for a mother of small children or a serious `80's buff to buy it and believe me 10 bucks is a sweet deal for such a rarity. I first got into the Care Bears when I was 4 now I'm 21 and proud to say I still care for these cool bears. This full-length film is criticized as being an hour long commercial to sell merchandise based on the new Care Bear Cousins. Though it seems to be true after watching it, I realized there is something more.As the Care Bears travel to an Earth gone mad they are being followed by the cause of the madness. A friendless boy possessed by an evil spirit bent on turning the whole world into a wasteland of hatred. Watch this movie again if you have it or are totally against it, because you might learn a thing or two about the Care Bears. This movie proves that the Care Bears are not invincible. The Care Bear Cousins provide the extra strength and ability the Care Bears could not supply alone. Some of these examples include aqua abilities (Cozy Heart Penguin), air ability (Playful Heart Monkey) and night vision (Bright Heart Raccoon) just to name a few. Plus the song and scene where the Cousins get their tummy symbols is always fun to watch.The movie's story is not as good as the second, but what I like about this one, is the fact that all the care bears actually say at least one line each, even Secret Bear! If you are a new fan or an old school fan, let this review be a reminder that the Care Bears are back!
