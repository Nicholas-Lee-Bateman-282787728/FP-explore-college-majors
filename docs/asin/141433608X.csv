169527,A1ZSWL641H5018,141433608X,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[73, 75]","I watched this documentary last night on TV. I had just seen the book in Costco and thought about buying it. I've read a lot of books about people who claim to have gone to Heaven, and also have a stack of books to read I haven't gotten to yet, so I passed on it. When I saw this listed on the TV schedule I made sure to be home to see it.From the title, you would think there would be a lot of content regarding what this little boy Alex (who, at six years old, was in a horrific car accident and survived) reported seeing in Heaven. There isn't. The only part I can remember him talking about Heaven at all is that Jesus took him away from the hospital so he didn't have to see the hospital personnel working on him and that he spent most of the time in Heaven in God's palace.What is on the DVD are testimonies from various people such as those who lived near where the accident occurred; paramedics and law officials who responded to the accident; doctors and nurses who cared for him in the hosptial and performed operations; pastors and church people who have gotten to know the family and how their town responded which such love and service to the family even though the Malarkey's were new in town; friends who cared for their children so the Alex's parents could be with him at the hospital; Alex's brother, Aaron, talking about his brother and how close they are; his father and mother talking about their deepening faith through this experience of bringing their paralyzed son home; and others who were influenced and inspired by the Malarkey family.If you think that sounds mundane and not especially worth your time watching the DVD, all I can say is you need to see it to understand the profound effect it can have on you, as it did on me. Alex's mother, Beth, is a remarkable woman and every time she talked about how God has brought good to their family and community from this accident, she brought all the attention back to God and His glory over and over again. She is a woman of deep conviction in the love and faithfulness of God. I cried a lot while watching this, but mostly when she talked about how God and Jesus, and not her son, are the focus of this documentary.There were at least two supernatural experiences where Alex tells his father an angel named John has a message for him. The father tries to see the angel, but cannot. Alex tells him to make his spirit transparent, but the father doesn't know how. In frustration, because he can't share in what his son wants him to see, he takes out the garbage down their long driveway and then prays. He begins to say words he thinks are given to him and finishes with ""Thus says the Lord""--or maybe it was ""Thus saith the Lord""--but he rushes back to their house and writes it all down and then shares it with Alex. Alex tells his father he got all of the message right. Another experience is when he told a family friend that her son would be returning home and it happened two weeks later, although he had never met her son and his name is the same as in the passages he told her to read in the Bible.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in what is beyond this life but also anyone who needs a faith boost or even is stuck in unbelief. I've looked for it online and saw it will be available in September and plan to buy it to share with others.Although Alex is paralyzed right now he believes he will walk again and be a missionary. I think he will do that and more. The people who attend church near where the accident occured bought the family a van and the license plate is ""WIL WALK"". I hope we hear more about Alex's progress in the future, but just being able to know this much will bless many people, so he already is a missionary.",5,Not what you'd think would be depicted by the title,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,3735,"['watched', 'documentary', 'last', 'night', 'TV', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'book', 'Costco', 'thought', 'buying', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'books', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'have', 'gone', 'Heaven', 'also', 'have', 'stack', 'books', 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'passed', 'When', 'saw', 'listed', 'TV', 'schedule', 'made', 'sure', 'be', 'home', 'see', 'title', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'content', 'regarding', 'what', 'little', 'boy', 'Alex', 'who', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'survived', 'reported', 'seeing', 'Heaven', ""n't"", 'only', 'part', 'can', 'remember', 'talking', 'Heaven', 'Jesus', 'took', 'away', 'hospital', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'working', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'Heaven', 'God', 'palace.What', 'DVD', 'are', 'testimonies', 'various', 'people', 'such', 'who', 'lived', 'where', 'accident', 'occurred', 'paramedics', 'law', 'officials', 'who', 'responded', 'accident', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'who', 'cared', 'hosptial', 'performed', 'operations', 'pastors', 'church', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'family', 'how', 'town', 'responded', 'such', 'love', 'service', 'family', 'even', 'Malarkey', 'were', 'new', 'town', 'friends', 'who', 'cared', 'children', 'Alex', 'parents', 'could', 'be', 'hospital', 'Alex', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'talking', 'brother', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'father', 'mother', 'talking', 'deepening', 'faith', 'experience', 'bringing', 'paralyzed', 'son', 'home', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'influenced', 'inspired', 'Malarkey', 'family.If', 'think', 'mundane', 'not', 'especially', 'time', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'need', 'see', 'understand', 'profound', 'effect', 'can', 'have', 'did', 'Alex', 'mother', 'Beth', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'time', 'talked', 'how', 'God', 'brought', 'good', 'family', 'community', 'accident', 'brought', 'attention', 'back', 'God', 'glory', 'over', 'again', 'woman', 'deep', 'conviction', 'love', 'faithfulness', 'God', 'cried', 'lot', 'watching', 'mostly', 'when', 'talked', 'how', 'God', 'Jesus', 'not', 'son', 'are', 'focus', 'documentary.There', 'were', 'least', 'two', 'supernatural', 'experiences', 'where', 'Alex', 'father', 'angel', 'named', 'John', 'message', 'father', 'see', 'angel', 'can', 'not', 'Alex', 'make', 'spirit', 'transparent', 'father', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'frustration', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'what', 'son', 'see', 'out', 'garbage', 'down', 'long', 'driveway', 'then', 'prays', 'say', 'words', 'are', 'given', 'finishes', 'Thus', 'Lord', 'maybe', 'was', 'Thus', 'saith', 'Lord', 'back', 'house', 'down', 'then', 'shares', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'father', 'got', 'message', 'right', 'experience', 'when', 'told', 'family', 'friend', 'son', 'would', 'be', 'returning', 'home', 'happened', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'son', 'name', 'same', 'passages', 'told', 'read', 'Bible.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'what', 'life', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', 'faith', 'boost', 'even', 'stuck', 'unbelief', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'online', 'saw', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'September', 'plan', 'buy', 'share', 'others.Although', 'Alex', 'paralyzed', 'right', 'now', 'will', 'walk', 'again', 'be', 'missionary', 'think', 'will', 'do', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'attend', 'church', 'where', 'accident', 'occured', 'bought', 'family', 'van', 'license', 'plate', 'WIL', 'WALK', 'hope', 'hear', 'more', 'Alex', 'progress', 'future', 'just', 'being', 'able', 'know', 'much', 'will', 'bless', 'many', 'people', 'already', 'missionary']",N/A
