I understand some Japanese but I definitely need the english sub-titles and I was not able to activate the subtitles for this movie. If I clicked on subtitle yes and then clicked on return to movie, the subtitle button seemed to deactivate. It was interesting to see the special features appear with subtitles but the movie itself had no subtitles. The actors in the movie are very attractive and the story seems to be very nice but without the subtitles, it is not as enjoyable as it should be.",3,problem with subtitles,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,572,"['have', 'ordered', 'dvd', 'twice', 'times', 'had', 'trouble', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'definitely', 'need', 'english', 'sub-titles', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'activate', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'clicked', 'subtitle', 'yes', 'then', 'clicked', 'return', 'movie', 'subtitle', 'button', 'seemed', 'deactivate', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'appear', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'had', 'subtitles', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'subtitles', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'should', 'be']",Schoolboy Crush
