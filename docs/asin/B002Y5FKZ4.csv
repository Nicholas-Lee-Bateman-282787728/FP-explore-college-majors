I concluded that review with a suggestion that we should wait to purchase until this production became available.  I concluded that review, ""Based on the broadcast, it is sure to be a winner.""I was only partially correct.  Musically, this production is superb, just as the broadcast was.  But, this is another of the Metropolitan's new productions which do not honor the time frame of the opera.  ""Thais"" takes place in fourth century Egypt.  The opulence of Nicias' home in Scene Two, with its long winding staircase, suggests a much later time, as does the rifle-wielding servant who greets Athaniel when he enters.  Nicias, dressed in a white tuxedo shirt, tie, and vest, helps to complete the incorrect picture.  The convent nuns in the final scene are dressed in habits that suggest much later than the fourth century.  In total, there is a mish-mash of time periods represented in this production.  I have not read anywhere what era John Cox and Paul Brown were attempting to portray; but whatever it was, it was not.On the plus side, Renee Fleming's Thais is much more sensuous than Eva Mei's, notwithstanding the latter's nudity.  And, watch Fleming's face in the final scene; nowhere else will you see such peace with oneself and with God.",4,Music 5; production 3,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,1422,"['Several', 'months', 'ago', 'just', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'performance', 'Thais', 'wrote', 'review', 'Venice', 'Opera', 'DVD', 'Eva', 'Mei', 'title', 'role', 'concluded', 'review', 'suggestion', 'should', 'wait', 'purchase', 'production', 'became', 'available', 'concluded', 'review', 'Based', 'broadcast', 'sure', 'be', 'winner', 'was', 'only', 'partially', 'correct', 'Musically', 'production', 'superb', 'just', 'broadcast', 'was', 'Metropolitan', 'new', 'productions', 'do', 'not', 'honor', 'time', 'frame', 'opera', 'Thais', 'place', 'fourth', 'century', 'Egypt', 'opulence', 'Nicias', 'home', 'Scene', 'Two', 'long', 'winding', 'staircase', 'much', 'later', 'time', 'rifle-wielding', 'servant', 'who', 'Athaniel', 'when', 'Nicias', 'dressed', 'white', 'tuxedo', 'shirt', 'tie', 'vest', 'complete', 'incorrect', 'picture', 'convent', 'final', 'scene', 'are', 'dressed', 'habits', 'suggest', 'much', 'later', 'fourth', 'century', 'total', 'mish-mash', 'time', 'periods', 'represented', 'production', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'anywhere', 'what', 'era', 'John', 'Cox', 'Paul', 'Brown', 'were', 'attempting', 'portray', 'was', 'was', 'not.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'Thais', 'much', 'more', 'sensuous', 'Eva', 'Mei', 'notwithstanding', 'latter', 'nudity', 'watch', 'Fleming', 'face', 'final', 'scene', 'else', 'will', 'see', 'such', 'peace', 'oneself', 'God']",N/A

If you do the same, you will not be disappointed!  Fans of Thomas Hampson will also be pleased with his performance.  This opera could just have easily been entitled ""Athanael & Thais"", as his role is at least equal to hers.  The Met orchestra is in top form and the Meditation was played particularly well by David Chan.I do not generally care for productions set outside the composer's intended period of history, but I did not find this distracting at all.In short, this DVD should be added to every opera lover's collection!",5,Absolutely outstanding!,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,690,"['famous', 'Meditation', 'Mirror', 'Scene', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'opera', 'being', 'major', 'fan', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'do', 'same', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Fans', 'Thomas', 'Hampson', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'pleased', 'performance', 'opera', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'entitled', 'Athanael', 'Thais', 'role', 'least', 'equal', 'hers', 'Met', 'orchestra', 'top', 'form', 'Meditation', 'was', 'played', 'particularly', 'well', 'David', 'Chan.I', 'do', 'not', 'generally', 'care', 'productions', 'set', 'composer', 'intended', 'period', 'history', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'distracting', 'all.In', 'short', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'opera', 'lover', 'collection']",N/A

There may be others in the future, but it is highly unlikely that they (it) will unseat the position that this Met production enjoys. That is not to say that it is perfect. Indeed almost any production of a French opera is in a quandry because of the lack of French singers and the ability to project the text as only a French trained singer can do. The recent Carmen managed to meet this problem head on and do a very good job of. Of course Carmen is a masterpiece and Thais while highly enjoyable and ranking almost with Manon and Werther is a more fragile work.Aside from the fact that neither lead is French my main bone of contention with the DVD is the very generic production. Fourth century Hellenic Egypt! Not even close. Why in heaven's name was Nicias wearing a white bow tie and white vest and what looked like a thirties lounging robe. This is nit picking, but even so it is glaring because he never changes his costume. Fleming is a diva and I suppose is entitled to all the perks that attend to the position. Her costumes are no more evocative of the setting than those of Nicias, especially her Act I costume. Only those of Hampson's are apt. Fleming's were designed for her and probably cost a lot of money; they are somewhat glitzy and I can't imagine any other opera that would find them acceptable.What is more important are the singers up to the job, something that previous productions were only able to do with marginal success. Leaving aside French style, both Fleming and Hampson deliver the goods. Renee still has a top that allows her to negotiate the difficult passages without strain. She sings the two high D's in the finale with ease. It is almost incredible to realize that at her age (very ungallant of me to even bring this up)she not only looks far younger than she is, but sings as well as she does--and may she continue to. Dramatically she may skate over the role but to anyone who can sing this role after the wretched attempts of Frittoli and Mei I couldn't care less. Ideally Anathael should be sung by a more heroic baritone than Hampson, but he is such a canny artist and with many years behind him he is able to manage not only this role but a number of others that one would not associate with his lyric baritone. Think Amfortas, Macbeth, Mandryka, et.al. Ideally my Anathael would be sung by Michel Dens, but France is not delivering this kind of singer, so I am more than happy to have an artist of the distinction of Hampson. Nicias is almost a thankless role and Schade performs it well.Supporting the opera is one of the great opera orchestras in the world and a conductor, though Spanish is at one with the Massenet idiom.

The opera is a clunker but when the production was fresh, the opera came off as believable and sounded gorgeous.  Revisiting their roles together seven years later was a bad idea.  She sounds vocally stretched and the beautiful tone is thick and leaden.  She's never been a great actress and this performance accentuates that short coming.  Why she doesn't embrace the music of Mozart or Strauss exclusively is a mystery to me.  Hampson's voice sounds dry and the old fashioned silent movie acting renders the plot unbelievable and ridiculous.The production is a complete bore and lacks any freshness it had in Chicago.  There are several other HD transmission from the Met that would have been more satisfying in a DVD format.  The hit productions of ""Barber of Seville"" and ""Madama Butterfly"" would have been choices.  Of course this release is star driven but that's not always the best reason to buy a copy of a performance.  Certainly this DVD is a perfect example.

The concertmaster who played the famous tune are very solid and confident. Though, I wish he could not be too 'strong' in tone quality at the beginning, to fits the scenario of 'meditation'.

Well, ain't all the stars are dying to keep young?The costumes are fabulous which I imagine turns on desires of all the divas on the market.Good show.",4,Thais - a not well known opera,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1328,"['guess', 'ask', 'ten', 'random', 'people', 'street', 'know', 'opera', 'would', 'be', '9.5', 'people', 'said', 'fact', 'only', 'solo', 'violin', 'melody', 'made', ""'popular"", 'classical', 'circles.For', 'modern', 'audiences', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'are', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'religious', 'point', 'aspect', 'third', 'acts', 'real', 'drama', 'interesting', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'become', 'opera', 'written', ""'Handel"", 'cut', 'third', 'acts.The', 'music', 'fascinating', 'orchestra', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'concertmaster', 'who', 'played', 'famous', 'tune', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'confident', 'wish', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'too', ""'strong"", 'tone', 'quality', 'beginning', 'fits', 'scenario', ""'meditation"", 'ai', ""n't"", 'sometimes', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'impress', 'audience', 'forget', 'what', 'was', 'truth', 'music', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'wrong', 'was', 'beautiful', 'playing.Ms', 'Fleming', 'was', 'obviously', 'star', 'was', 'very', 'confident', 'just', 'superstars', 'celebrities', 'secure', 'voice', 'Let', 'have', 'small', 'talk', 'think', 'had', 'something', 'inject', 'face', 'especially', 'forehead', 'almost', 'look', 'like', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'noticed', 'immediately', 'when', 'watched', 'bonus', 'video', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'stars', 'are', 'dying', 'keep', 'young', 'costumes', 'are', 'fabulous', 'imagine', 'turns', 'desires', 'divas', 'market.Good', 'show']",N/A
