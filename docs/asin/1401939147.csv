168328,A4QPV67OL3TLJ,1401939147,J. Woodrum,"[3, 3]",I bought this from Hay House but will do a review here.  What a disappointment this DVD is.  The audio and video are very poor; one of the guest speakers can't be understood at all and the audience noise is very distracting. There is nothing new here just more of the same from previous works.  I have always been a Wayne Dyer fan but this collection is not worth the money.,2,Experiencing the Miraculous,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,374,"['bought', 'Hay', 'House', 'will', 'do', 'review', 'here', 'What', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'one', 'guest', 'speakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'audience', 'noise', 'very', 'distracting', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'previous', 'works', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'fan', 'collection', 'not', 'worth', 'money']",N/A
