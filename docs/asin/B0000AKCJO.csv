763725,A2GSRIHX7VIIK9,B0000AKCJO,"Amazon Customer ""douggw""","[2, 3]","It is hard to classify this movie, it was not very funny and the drama was light.  This is leaves the description of quirky.  Bought this DVD as the only way to see Mandy Moore's performance (movie never released to theaters).  She was 18 when this was filmed.  She shows she can carry herself with more veteran actors, and will be a great star once she is given good material.  Like her recent theater release &quot;How to Deal&quot;, &quot;All i want&quot; has a poorly thought out slow paced script.  This movie shows she has the talent to play mature characters, not just high school kids.This movie is worth a look, Elijah Wood plays his character (Jones Dillon) with a tongue in cheek seriousness, but is clearly having fun.  He has scenes where he appears child like, but this is countered by his skill at purchasing booze with fake id and a line, and his adult interactions with his mother (Elizabeth Perkins).  The movie falls flat at the end, it was almost like the director stuck a pin in the overinflated plot which then collapses.  High rating is due to Mandy Moore and Elijah Wood's performances.  I enjoyed it overall especially as they shot scenes at my school, the University of British Columbia.  Rent it, not worth purchasing.

Or at least, it's tough for Jones Dillon, the slightly neurotic teenage hero of &quot;All I Want,&quot; a fitful but rather amusing romantic comedy that breaks some rules and sticks religiously to others.Seventeen-year-old Jones (Elijah Wood) arrives at a university -- unless he enrolls, he can't access the sizable inheritance his grandpa left him. But after being scared off by the roommate from hell, he drops out and heads to a local sublet apartment building. The building comes with some unusual roommates: gay cowboy Brad (Aaron Pearl), sultry aspiring actress Lisa (Mandy Moore), and sullen photographer Jane (Franka Potente).Settling into his new home, Jones bickers with his estranged mother from Texas, and writes (very imaginative) letters to the mysterious father he never knew. But to deal with the problems of his life, this confused teen will have to face up to the reality around him -- and the women who want him. Especially when he learns that the truth is harsh, and might just break his heart.Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, and most of them are forgotten the moment the credits roll. In contrast, &quot;All I Want&quot; (original title: &quot;Try Seventeen&quot;) manages to be pretty memorable. Different settings, different characters, and a different kind of lead -- rather than a Holden Caulfield wannabe or a stud, Jones is the kind of likable kid who lives down your street.The script is somewhat flawed. The ending is pure Hollywood cliche. And it's hard to see why Jones would prefer the alcoholic and abusive Jane over the sweeter if sluttier Lisa. However, relative directing newbie Jeffrey Porter shows plenty of quirks and humor that you won't find in any Julia Roberts comedy -- Jones daydreaming about blasting a car with a bazooka, while blonde bombshells fawn over him, is especially funny.Elijah Wood gives a wonderfully nuanced, layered performance as Jones, a naive teenager whose life is in a tangle. Wood plays Jones as a sweet, wistful lad with some unusual quirks, but also gets to be rough'n'tough in the delicious &quot;revenge&quot; scene near the end. Mandy Moore shares good chemistry with him, and gives astonishing depth to what could have been a soulless role; her Lisa is flawed, but a pleasant person with regrets and personality. And most memorable is Blondie singer Debbie Harry, as a sexy matron who invades Jones's dreams.A fun if flawed romantic comedy, &quot;All I Want&quot; features excellent acting from Wood and Moore, and a likably quirky sensibility. Fun and cute, and certainly worth curling up in front of.",4,All I want?,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,2696,"['tough', 'being', 'seventeen-year-old', 'virgin', 'Especially', 'one', 'active', 'imagination', 'gallons', 'hormones', 'least', 'tough', 'Jones', 'Dillon', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'teenage', 'hero', 'quot', 'Want', 'quot', 'fitful', 'rather', 'amusing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rules', 'sticks', 'religiously', 'others.Seventeen-year-old', 'Jones', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'university', 'ca', ""n't"", 'access', 'sizable', 'inheritance', 'grandpa', 'left', 'being', 'scared', 'off', 'roommate', 'hell', 'out', 'heads', 'local', 'sublet', 'apartment', 'building', 'building', 'unusual', 'roommates', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'Brad', 'Aaron', 'Pearl', 'sultry', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'Lisa', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'sullen', 'photographer', 'Jane', 'Franka', 'Potente', '.Settling', 'new', 'home', 'Jones', 'bickers', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Texas', 'writes', 'very', 'imaginative', 'letters', 'mysterious', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'deal', 'problems', 'life', 'confused', 'teen', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'up', 'reality', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'Especially', 'when', 'truth', 'harsh', 'might', 'just', 'break', 'heart.Romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'most', 'are', 'forgotten', 'moment', 'credits', 'roll', 'contrast', 'quot', 'Want', 'quot', 'original', 'title', 'quot', 'Try', 'Seventeen', 'quot', 'be', 'pretty', 'memorable', 'Different', 'settings', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'kind', 'lead', 'rather', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'wannabe', 'stud', 'Jones', 'kind', 'likable', 'kid', 'who', 'down', 'street.The', 'script', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'ending', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Jones', 'would', 'prefer', 'alcoholic', 'abusive', 'Jane', 'sweeter', 'sluttier', 'Lisa', 'However', 'relative', 'directing', 'newbie', 'Jeffrey', 'Porter', 'plenty', 'quirks', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'comedy', 'Jones', 'daydreaming', 'blasting', 'car', 'bazooka', 'blonde', 'bombshells', 'fawn', 'especially', 'funny.Elijah', 'Wood', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'layered', 'performance', 'Jones', 'naive', 'teenager', 'life', 'tangle', 'Wood', 'Jones', 'sweet', 'wistful', 'lad', 'unusual', 'quirks', 'also', 'be', 'rough', ""n'tough"", 'delicious', 'quot', 'revenge', 'quot', 'scene', 'end', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'shares', 'good', 'chemistry', 'astonishing', 'depth', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'soulless', 'role', 'Lisa', 'flawed', 'pleasant', 'person', 'regrets', 'personality', 'most', 'memorable', 'Blondie', 'singer', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'sexy', 'matron', 'who', 'Jones', 'dreams.A', 'fun', 'flawed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Want', 'quot', 'features', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Wood', 'Moore', 'likably', 'quirky', 'sensibility', 'Fun', 'cute', 'certainly', 'worth', 'curling', 'up', 'front']",All I Want

It grabbed my attention for some reason, so I bought it.Big mistake.I'm shocked to read other reviews giving it the maximum amount of stars. Did we see a different film? Cos it's absolutely dire. There's absolutely no plot, it's just a series of disjointed scenes, making no sense, and just plodding along. Nothing could save this film, not even the actors. Franka Potente has an accent that appears and disappears throughout the movie, Elijah Wood is really starting to look like Daniel Radcliffe's older brother and Mandy Moore doesn't sing. For once. Debbie Harry appears only briefly, looking like a relative of Dolly Parton. Then there's the dream sequences. I won't even go there. How pointless could you be?!Then the was the whole mother/son relationship. Surely she could have had the decency to tell him more about his estranged father? Surely she could see the character was messed up because there was no father figure in his life? He's writing letters to his father telling him about everything, simply because he has an old typewriter of his father's, and he wants to be a writer, because his father wrote.I hung about for all of the whole of the film, but never really giving it my full attention, thinking it was going somewhere, and playing Solitaire on my phone at one point! I seriously considered turning it off a number of times, and watching something relatively decent. But no, I thought it would get better.

763734,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000AKCJO,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 10]","Also known as inexplicable 'Try Seventten,' 'All I Want' stars Elijah Wood, Franka Potente ('Run Lola Run'), Mandy Moore ('Walk to Remember'), and Elizabeth Perkins.  The film, as you know, seems to have been directly sent to video, in spite of the presence of Frodo, and if you see the film, you soon realize there are good reasons behind that.The story is just a standard one, about a seventeen-year-old boy Jones (Wood), coming from Texas (where he lived with his mom always drinking), and without reasons he drops out from the college on the first day.  Jones instead takes up a room, where he meets unique characters, photographer Franka Potente, and actress-wannabe Mandy Moore.Romance ensues, but not in the way we expect.  Actually, Ms. Moore's role is not as big as you suppose, and (as you see for yourself in the opening 30 minutes) it's Ms. Potente that steals the heart of Jones, and the film itself.  But how could an immature 17-year-old boy with a bad habit of daydreaming be the love of this elder, tough, and independent woman with a fragile heart?The story itself is promising, and the film is not totally bad, like 'Gigli' or something.  'All I Want' is (at least) trying to be a comfortable romance with love story, and possibly healthy amount of humor.  Endure the awfully slow and contrived opening 30 minutes, and you will pretty enjoy yourself.But the film is flawed at many points.  First of all, Elijah Wood (b. 1981) never looks seventeen, even with his wide eyes.  To make matters worse, his acting here is too bland.  Incredible as it sounds, but I couldn't tell whether it's Wood's character or Wood himself that looks very boring on the screen.The poor direction doesn't help, either.  The boy's frequent 'fantasy' is strictly amateur hour, each shot annoyingly lacking the quality of real fantasy.  His family history back in Texas sorrounding Elizabeth Perkins's character is nothing original, let alone amusing or touching.Perhaps 'All I Want' can be best enjoyed as love story of Franka Potente, who alone can brings life to this oft-told story that looks assembled from better movies about teens and teenage angst, like John Hughes back in the 80s.
