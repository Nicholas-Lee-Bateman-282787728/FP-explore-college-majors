The stories and acting on The Rifleman are outstanding.A question to trivia experts: am I remembering correctly that the introductory scenes varied from season to season?

906381,A3RUSD36FWAGGD,B0009IWFNI,Moon Mist,"[11, 12]","Putting it shortly and simply, there is no need to review the show, one of the best western TV shows ever.  If you are over 45 or so and you don't know the show, you must have been living in a cave or in some third-world country, and even in those countries, everyone has a TV and you can probably still get the show in syndication.The production company was Four-Star Productions, but I would give the product here only three stars, simply because I want the original show in its entirety - the original opening credits and the original closing credits, and everything in between, for each and every episode, season-by-season in episode order.  There has yet to be a season-by-season DVD release of the original episodes of ""The Rifleman"", just repackaged stuff like this.  This is true for another great western series, ""Bonanza.""  I also hope those are released one day in their original form instead of in the bastardized collections currently available.",3,"Four stars for the product, five stars for the show - ""A Four-Star Television Production"")",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,958,"['Putting', 'shortly', 'simply', 'need', 'review', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'western', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'are', '45', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'third-world', 'country', 'even', 'countries', 'everyone', 'TV', 'can', 'probably', 'still', 'get', 'show', 'syndication.The', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'Four-Star', 'Productions', 'would', 'give', 'product', 'here', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'simply', 'want', 'original', 'show', 'entirety', 'original', 'opening', 'credits', 'original', 'closing', 'credits', 'everything', 'episode', 'season-by-season', 'episode', 'order', 'yet', 'be', 'season-by-season', 'DVD', 'release', 'original', 'episodes', 'Rifleman', 'just', 'repackaged', 'stuff', 'true', 'great', 'western', 'series', 'Bonanza', 'also', 'hope', 'are', 'released', 'one', 'day', 'original', 'form', 'instead', 'bastardized', 'collections', 'currently', 'available']",N/A
