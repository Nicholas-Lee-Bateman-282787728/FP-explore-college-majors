908399,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0009MUBEY,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[9, 10]","Although fitting a mainstream audience, 'Karol: A Man Who Became Pope,' has to be one of the greatest movies in Catholic cinema.  Taking the life of Pope John Paul II (featuring Polish actor Piotr Adamczyk) from the Nazi invasion of Poland to his rise to the papacy, 'Karol...' clocks in at 3:06 without a wasted scene.  The acting is decent to solid, and there are enough threads throughout to create a seamless presentation.  Relationships are focused upon clearly while the story weaves its way through the ordeal and horror of Nazi occupation to the decades of communism until the man who said, ""Evil will devour itself,"" becomes that self-fulfilling prophecy.Familiar to most people, not just Catholics, the story is a study in resiliency, a witness to a spirit that isn't broken--even in the direst of circumstances.  The highlights include his relationships with Jewish friends, his underground actor days, his eventual embrace of priesthood, and his scholarly and ecclesial roles as they develop.  At the forefront are history defining moments that swirl around the main protagonist.  Always authentic, never dull, and stirring without a shred of sentimentality, 'Karol:  A Man Who Became Pope' is a master portrait of a man and his flock over time.",5,Triumph from Misery,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1257,"['fitting', 'mainstream', 'audience', ""'Karol"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Became', 'Pope', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'Catholic', 'cinema', 'Taking', 'life', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'featuring', 'Polish', 'actor', 'Piotr', 'Adamczyk', 'Nazi', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'rise', 'papacy', 'clocks', '3:06', 'wasted', 'scene', 'acting', 'decent', 'solid', 'are', 'enough', 'threads', 'create', 'seamless', 'presentation', 'Relationships', 'are', 'focused', 'clearly', 'story', 'way', 'ordeal', 'horror', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'decades', 'communism', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'Evil', 'will', 'devour', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecy.Familiar', 'most', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'Catholics', 'story', 'study', 'resiliency', 'witness', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'broken', 'even', 'direst', 'circumstances', 'highlights', 'include', 'relationships', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'underground', 'actor', 'days', 'eventual', 'embrace', 'priesthood', 'scholarly', 'ecclesial', 'roles', 'develop', 'forefront', 'are', 'history', 'defining', 'moments', 'swirl', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Always', 'authentic', 'never', 'dull', 'stirring', 'shred', 'sentimentality', ""'Karol"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Became', 'Pope', 'master', 'portrait', 'man', 'flock', 'time']","Karol - The Pope, the Man"

It chronicles his life in Poland during World War II and the Soviet Communism following. I saw the movie with my grandmother who was about the Pope's age about 50 kilometers from the site when Poland was attacked during the war and she thought the movie conveyed the times pretty realistically. Actually, that is also what she said she didn't like about the movie because it brought her back to the times she didn't want to go back to. As for me, the younger generation (I am in my early 20s), the movie was emotional, dramatic and involving. It is hard to believe it was someone's real life because it really reads more like fiction. The acting was great as well.

That's the reason why this film is called what it is; as it tries to convey how the man himself was ""made"" by a particular historical era into the man the world has since come to know.  If you are looking for an all encompassing 'Life of John Paul II' this isn't the film for you. (See ""Witness to Hope"" on DVD for that, and/or read George Weigel's biography of Pope John Paul II by that same title.) Roughly half of this presentation concerns the era in which World War Two was fought, leaving not much time to address the half century of this man's service that followed. In many ways, thus, this film is very much a window into Nazi-occupied Poland; a film that one could usefully watch along with ""The Wannsee Conference,"" ""Schindler's List,"" and others. On that level it is a fine film indeed. Piotr Adamczyk, the actor who portays the future pope, moreover, handles the role with remarkable aplomb.  As the story of ""The Man who became Pope,"" however, this film suffers from some very serious shortcomings. In the film pivotal scenes, for instance, are portrayed by a ""Father Tomasz Zaleski,"" who plays Karol's close friend of many years---his spiritual advisor even; a man we ultimately see get shot by a Nazi firing squad. Too bad all this is, in George Weigel's words, ""a complete invention. Young Karol Wojtyla did have a spiritual director, Father Kazimierz Figliewicz, but Figliewicz was not his contemporary and was not shot by the Germans, "" Weigel has written. Karol's relationship with ""Hania,"" in real life the Polish actress Halina Krolikiewicz Kwiatkowska, is also doctored. A close friend of Karol, she is portrayed as kept in the dark by his decision to join the priesthood (seemingly belied by the fact that he was very open about this with friends supposedly); who then doesn't marry for 7 years---seemingly to imply something here. But she actually married soon thereafter. And her first child was later (1946) baptized by Father Karol. And lastly, to quote Weigel again: ""The filmmakers also invent a member of a Wojtyla youth group who is really working for the SB, the secret police. This is not only a total fabrication; it's an insult to the men and women who were, in fact, Karol Wojtyla's closest lay friends, and whose networks were certainly not penetrated by Polish intelligence."" But the film adds the fictional priest above, the hint of romantic relations that didn't exist, and---for added measure---some espionage spice that no evidence exists to support. To reiterate: The film is well done and does convincingly convey the spirit of the future John Paul II. Just don't take all the details of the story presented herein as gospel should you choose to view this film along with ""Witness to Hope.""

In 1993 to 1995 I lived in Lublin, Poland, where the Karol once worked. Many people spoke with great affection about the man, who would one day become Pope. Seeing this film on DVD I was intrigued with who and what made this man.The film is 3 hours long. It is a great biopic of the man, but I feel it dwells too much on his early life in the war. Over 1 hour is spent on this period and only 10 minutes on him becoming Pope. I would have liked a little more about his Papal election. This election was controversial, yet is passed over very quickly. There is no analysis of why he was chosen or the Geo Political earthquake his election help create. I also think some more analysis of the time he was Arch Bishop of Nova Hoota would have been appropriate. For many Poles the period he spent negotiating and building this Church against State opposition is what made him a legend in Poland, long before he was elected Pope.It is also obvious that this is a made for TV film, and does suffer from some very poor special effects.If you accept the short comings of this film and just enjoy learning something about this GREAT man, then the film is worth watching.

I then address a word of admiration to the director and writer, Giacomo Battiato, and to the actors, especially Piotr Adamczyk who played the part of John Paul II, to the producer Pietro Valsecchi and to the networks ""Taodue"" and ""Mediaset"".I cordially greet the other Cardinals, Bishops, priests, Authorities and all those who wanted to take part in this viewing in honour of the beloved Pontiff, recently deceased. We all remember him with deep affection and heartfelt gratitude. Yesterday, he would have celebrated his 85th birthday.""Karol, un uomo diventato Papa"" [Karol, a man who became Pope] is the title of the drama, taken from a text by Gian Franco Svidercoschi. The first segment, as we have seen, highlights the situation in Poland under the Nazi regime, with emphasis - now and then very emotionally strong - given to the repression of the Polish people and to the genocide of the Jews. These are atrocious crimes that show all of the evil that was contained in the Nazi ideology.Young Karol, shocked by so much suffering and violence, decided to do something about it in his own life, answering the divine call to the priesthood. The film presents scenes and episodes that, in their severity, awaken in the viewers an instinctive ""turning away"" in horror and stimulates them to consider the abyss of iniquity that can be hidden in the human soul.At the same time, calling to the fore such aberration revives in every right-minded person the duty to do what he or she can so that such inhuman barbarism never happens again.Today's viewing takes place just some days after the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On 8 May 1945 the conclusion was marked of that frightful tragedy which sowed destruction and death, in a measure never-before heard of, in Europe and in the world.Ten years ago, John Paul II wrote that World War II appears with evermore clarity as a ""suicide of humanity"". Each time a totalitarian ideology crushes man, humanity as a whole is seriously threatened. With the passing of time, memories do not have to fade; rather, they must be a stern lesson for this and future generations. We have the responsibility of reminding especially youth of the forms of unprecedented violence that can lead to contempt for men and women and the violation of their rights.Under the light of Providence, how can we not read as a divine plan the fact that on the Chair of Peter, a Polish Pope is succeeded by a citizen of that Country, Germany, where the Nazi regime was the most vicious, attacking the nearby nations, Poland among them?In their youth, both of these Popes - even if on opposing fronts and in different situations - knew the cruelty of the Second World War and of the senseless violence of men fighting men, people fighting people.During the final days of the Second Vatican Council held here in Rome, the Polish Bishops consigned the ""letter of reconciliation"" to the German Bishops; the letter contained those famous words that today too resound in our souls: ""We forgive and we ask forgiveness"".In last Sunday's Homily I reminded the newly-ordained priests that ""nothing can improve the world if evil is not overcome. Evil can be overcome only by forgiveness"" (L'Osservatore Romano English Edition, 18 May, p. 7). May the mutual and sincere condemnation of Nazism, as with atheistic communism, be everyone's duty for the building of reconciliation and peace on forgiveness.""To forgive"", our beloved John Paul II again reminds us, ""does not mean to forget"", adding that ""if memory is the law of history, forgiveness is the power of God, the power of Christ that works in the vicissitudes of man"" (cf. Insegnamenti di Giovanni Paolo II, XVII/2 [1994], p. 250). Peace is, in the first place, a gift of God, who makes sentiments of love and solidarity arise in the heart of the person who welcomes it.I hope that, thanks also to this witness of Pope John Paul II commemorated in this meaningful film, there will be a revival on the part of each person in the proposal to work - each in his or her own field and according to one's means - at the service of a definite action for peace in Europe and in the entire world.I entrust the hope of peace that all of us carry in our heart to the maternal intercession of the Virgin Mary, who is venerated especially in this month of May. May she, Queen of Peace, encourage the generous contribution of those who intend to put their efforts toward the building of true peace on the solid pillars of truth, justice, freedom and love. With these sentiments, I extend to all my Apostolic Blessing.-- POPE BENEDICT XVI[...]",5,Touching and Inspiring,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,5193,"['would', 'think', 'best', 'words', 'used',

908421,A65CM44WE6K9E,B0009MUBEY,"Marion Capriotti ""missmvc""","[3, 5]","I wanted to see this film because Karol Wojtyla/Pope John Paul II was a major figure in 20th-Century history, and a fascinating person in his own right.  Being Jewish, I also wanted to see how the film would treat the Polish Pope's early life in Poland during the Holocaust, and whether or not it would deal with the Catholic Church's overall silence with respect to the Holocaust.The film is emotionally compelling and engrossing.  An amazingly talented Polish actor, Piotr Adamczyk, portrays Karol Wojtyla as a gifted, compassionate young student/budding artist who decides to devote his life to the priesthood in response to the horrors he witnessed and experienced during the Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland.  The film disproportionately highlights and celebrates the ""Righteous Gentiles"" among Wojtyla's college friends; while it is very likely true that a Polish intellectual in his early 20's during the late 1930's probably socialized exclusively with fellow Poles who were not anti-Semitic, the film ignores and eliminates by avoidance the huge problem of endemic anti-Semitism throughout Polish culture.Thus, the film is intrinsically biased in favor of showing Polish Catholicism particularly, and the Catholic Church in general, as innocent, when history shows that it is not.  I think this is understandable, but it is an obvious bias and should be taken into account when viewing.Overall, the film is a very fine work of art, and the performance of Piotr Adamczyk really brings the character of Karol Wojtyla to life.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in understanding major figures in 20th/21st century world history, but would caution them to keep in mind the vested interests involved in the making of the film.",4,"Beautifully-done biopic; biased, but honestly so",1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,1752,"['wanted', 'see', 'film', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla/Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'was', 'major', 'figure', '20th-Century', 'history', 'fascinating', 'person', 'own', 'right', 'Being', 'Jewish', 'also', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'treat', 'Polish', 'Pope', 'early', 'life', 'Poland', 'Holocaust', 'not', 'would', 'deal', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'overall', 'silence', 'respect', 'Holocaust.The', 'film', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'engrossing', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'Polish', 'actor', 'Piotr', 'Adamczyk', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'gifted', 'compassionate', 'young', 'student/budding', 'artist', 'who', 'devote', 'life', 'priesthood', 'response', 'horrors', 'witnessed', 'experienced', 'Nazi', 'invasion', 'occupation', 'Poland', 'film', 'disproportionately', 'highlights', 'Righteous', 'Gentiles', 'Wojtyla', 'college', 'friends', 'very', 'likely', 'true', 'Polish', 'intellectual', 'early', '20', 'late', '1930', 'probably', 'socialized', 'exclusively', 'fellow', 'Poles', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'anti-Semitic', 'film', 'ignores', 'eliminates', 'avoidance', 'huge', 'problem', 'endemic', 'anti-Semitism', 'Polish', 'culture.Thus', 'film', 'intrinsically', 'biased', 'favor', 'showing', 'Polish', 'Catholicism', 'particularly', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'general', 'innocent', 'when', 'history', 'not', 'think', 'understandable', 'obvious', 'bias', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'account', 'when', 'viewing.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'fine', 'work', 'art', 'performance', 'Piotr', 'Adamczyk', 'really', 'character', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'life', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'understanding', 'major', 'figures', '20th/21st', 'century', 'world', 'history', 'would', 'caution', 'keep', 'mind', 'vested', 'interests', 'involved', 'making', 'film']","Karol - The Pope, the Man"

908428,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B0009MUBEY,Richard J. Brzostek,"[16, 18]","Pope John Paul II is probably the most famous Pole in recent history.  Before he was Pope John Paul II, he was Karol Wojtyla.  Before he became the Pope, he was an actor, poet, teacher, and priest.  ""Karol: A Man who Became Pope"" traces his personal history from the early days of the second world war up until the time he becomes the Pope.  His life story is an interesting and inspirational.The movie begins with a young Karol at the start of World War II, we get to see a close up look at the brutal German invasion of Krakow and how Karol managed to lived though it.  The arrival and occupation of the city must have been a traumatic experience, and we get to see the death and destruction the Nazis brought from the perspective of Karol and his friends.  Events in the war influenced Karol and made him decide to become a priest so he could help others.With the end of the war, Poland did not have an easy time, as now the Russians controlled Poland.  Priests were a persecuted group as the communists were atheists.  A spy was placed to watch Wojtyla as he was deemed to be a threat to communism.  We get to see the future Pope develop as a person and spiritually, as he touches the lives of so many people.  It was incredible to watch how all of this unfolded.There are several messages in the film.  One theme is life and death, as Karol sees others suffer and even die; yet he does not loose his faith.  He remains hopeful and strong in situations where others would give up.  This brings us to the other major themes of the movie: faith and love.  He never lost his faith in a better future.  We also see how love can triumph over hate.  Love can pave the way to a better future, and whatever banner hate has, it will not triumph over love.""Karol: A Man who Became Pope"" shows us the amazing story of how Karol Wojtyla persevered from Nazi to communist persecution, detailing the incredible story of an amazing man.

908432,A3NAK0QG32XFKL,B0009MUBEY,"Tefilo de Jess ""Vivificat's blogmaster""","[4, 4]","This biopic is well done, true to life in terms of sets and costumes. This is no amateur production. The principal actors themselves are Polish: Piotr Adamczyk played Karol Wojtyla and Malgorzata Bela played leading lady, a platonic love never consumated. Obviously, there were some liberties taken here, but they do not detract much from the known trajectory of the Pope's life.Adamczyk plays a convincing Wojtyla, reacting with profound emotions and absorption to every evil he sees. This is consontant with Wojtyla's phenomenological leanings. He was able to capture the late Pope's penetrating gaze and ample smile.Main bad guys: Matt Craven, who played Hans Frank, Poland's Nazi governor and Hristo Shopov, whose name has been grievously omitted from the Cast Biographies and the Media Kit available from the distributor's website. We all know Shopov: he played Pontius Pilate in the Passion of the Christ. The guy has a nack to play evil dudes. In this movie, he played a Polish Communist apparatchik who tries to capture Wojtyla in a fumble that would justify his arrest, but can't.Supporting cast: Raoul Bova played Father Thomasz Zaleski, pastor of Wawel Cathedral in Cracow and a mentor of young Karol. Zaleski lost his life at the whim of Governor Hans Frank. Ennio Fantasthichini played Nowak, a mine worker Wojtyla befriended while working at the Solway quarry who became a lifelong friend and mentor of sorts. There are more, but these are the ones I have the most information for the moment. I want to say that no secondary character was wasted in this movie; all of them contributed actively to the setting, to the environment, and to the pathos of the movie.The script: In my opinion, perhaps the one thing that could have been improved. Sometimes the character appear to be delivering one-liners that sort of ""cruise"" past the other. In his more pedagogic moments, Wojtyla seems to be delivering straight quotes from the Pope's own works: _Love and Responsibility_ and _The Acting Person_. Adamski's delivery of these lines is magisterial and saves the day. He was able to integrate seamlessly them into a normal dialogue.If the late Pope was like this, no wonder he is so beloved!",4,Great Biopic,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2199,"['biopic', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'life', 'terms', 'sets', 'costumes', 'amateur', 'production', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'Polish', 'Piotr', 'Adamczyk', 'played', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'Malgorzata', 'Bela', 'played', 'leading', 'lady', 'platonic', 'love', 'never', 'consumated', 'Obviously', 'were', 'liberties', 'taken', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'much', 'known', 'trajectory', 'Pope', 'life.Adamczyk', 'convincing', 'Wojtyla', 'reacting', 'profound', 'emotions', 'absorption', 'evil', 'consontant', 'Wojtyla', 'phenomenological', 'leanings', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'late', 'Pope', 'penetrating', 'gaze', 'ample', 'smile.Main', 'bad', 'guys', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'who', 'played', 'Hans', 'Frank', 'Poland', 'Nazi', 'governor', 'Hristo', 'Shopov', 'name', 'been', 'grievously', 'omitted', 'Cast', 'Biographies', 'Media', 'Kit', 'available', 'distributor', 'website', 'know', 'Shopov', 'played', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'guy', 'nack', 'play', 'evil', 'dudes', 'movie', 'played', 'Polish', 'Communist', 'apparatchik', 'who', 'capture', 'Wojtyla', 'fumble', 'would', 'justify', 'arrest', ""can't.Supporting"", 'cast', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'played', 'Father', 'Thomasz', 'Zaleski', 'pastor', 'Wawel', 'Cathedral', 'Cracow', 'mentor', 'young', 'Karol', 'Zaleski', 'lost', 'life', 'whim', 'Governor', 'Hans', 'Frank', 'Ennio', 'Fantasthichini', 'played', 'Nowak', 'mine', 'worker', 'Wojtyla', 'befriended', 'working', 'Solway', 'quarry', 'who', 'became', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'mentor', 'sorts', 'are', 'more', 'are', 'ones', 'have', 'most', 'information', 'moment', 'want', 'say', 'secondary', 'character', 'was', 'wasted', 'movie', 'contributed', 'actively', 'setting', 'environment', 'pathos', 'movie.The', 'script', 'opinion', 'perhaps', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'Sometimes', 'character', 'appear', 'be', 'delivering', 'one-liners', 'sort', 'cruise', 'other', 'more', 'pedagogic', 'moments', 'Wojtyla', 'be', 'delivering', 'straight', 'quotes', 'Pope', 'own', 'works', '_Love', 'Responsibility_', '_The', 'Acting', 'Person_', 'Adamski', 'delivery', 'lines', 'magisterial', 'day', 'was', 'able', 'integrate', 'seamlessly', 'normal', 'dialogue.If', 'late', 'Pope', 'was', 'wonder', 'so', 'beloved']","Karol - The Pope, the Man"
