935350,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000AYFGYQ,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[15, 15]","Is 'Kenny Vs. Spenny' the greatest television show in the history of television?  Probably.  Is Kenny Hotz one of the most interesting people in the world?  Yep.  Does Spencer Rice deserve the constant humiliation he is subject to?  Absolutely.The show's concept is basically this:  two Canadian best friends challenge each other to various competitions.  The winner of said competition gets to humilate the other.  Its a fairly simple premise that allows the two friends to try and outdo one another in anyway they can think of.  First, we have Kenny Hotz:  deviant mastermind who loves video games, not bathing, and going to any lengths to destroy his best friend, Spenny.  Secondly, we have Spencer 'Spenny' Rice:  a neurotic, by-the-book goon who deserves to lose.  And lose he does.While all 24 episodes are hysterical, some of the highlights of season one are:  'Who Can Gain The Most Weight?', 'Who Is The Better Boxer?', 'Who Is Saner?', and 'Who Can Live In A Van The Longest?'.This set contains 24 episdoes of the first season of the show.  Watch as Kenny humiliates Spenny...you will love it.  Guaranteed.  'Kenny Vs. Spenny' is probably the funniest television show in the history of the world.",5,Best Show Ever?

935351,A1ETTI01TOOEO3,B000AYFGYQ,F. Rodriguez,"[8, 9]","The competitions are silly, the humiliations are hilarious (and often brutal), and the strategies employed to win border on criminal. Kenny Hotz is a brilliant, ruthless, unscrupulous competitor. Spenny is the honest guy that believes in hard work and perseverence. The clash of personalities is yet another element that adds to the hilarity. I have never been so entertained by a reality show. This is a must see and must own.

935353,A2KEKPMI3WQMPA,B000AYFGYQ,"pancake_repairman ""pancake_repairman""","[4, 19]","It has it's moments. Decent concept, somewhat entertaining, but unsatisfying because I really just wanted both of them to lose most of the time. The jerky Kenny and boring Spenny are both equally pathetic and unlikeable. I don't know what the bigger mystery is, why they're friends or why anyone gave them a tv show. They're not a very entertaining example of the prankster/straight-man dynamic, because while Spenny's annoyed/angry reactions are often funny, Kenny doesn't seem to be having much fun eliciting them. He's usually too serious about bullying Spenny for his antics to be endearingly goofy.The outcomes of the challenges were often unsatisfying too. With no impartial judge all Kenny has to do to ""win"" a challenge is to convince Spenny that he has won even if he hasn't, or try to find some loophole in the criteria of the challenge which usually ends up being too questionable in it's validity to be impressively clever.There were also moments that made me wonder whether some parts of the show were scripted. The most glaring example being when Spenny finds a vial of testosterone in the fridge, and assumes not only that it's being used by Kenny's sister who doesn't live at the house and presumably doesn't come by there very often, but that Kenny and/or his sister didn't want or expect Spenny to find the vial. There is no way anyone is actually that stupid.It is still a kinda entertaining show, but it has more weak points than strong points and is one of my more disappointing dvd tv show purchases. Not as good as The Amazing Race, Viva La Bam, or 30 Days.",3,Please enter a title for your review,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,1580,"['moments', 'Decent', 'concept', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'unsatisfying', 'really', 'just', 'wanted', 'lose', 'most', 'time', 'jerky', 'Kenny', 'boring', 'Spenny', 'are', 'equally', 'pathetic', 'unlikeable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'bigger', 'mystery', 'why', ""'re"", 'friends', 'why', 'anyone', 'gave', 'tv', 'show', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'entertaining', 'example', 'prankster/straight-man', 'dynamic', 'Spenny', 'annoyed/angry', 'reactions', 'are', 'often', 'funny', 'Kenny', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'much', 'fun', 'eliciting', 'usually', 'too', 'serious', 'bullying', 'Spenny', 'antics', 'be', 'endearingly', 'goofy.The', 'outcomes', 'challenges', 'were', 'often', 'unsatisfying', 'too', 'impartial', 'judge', 'Kenny', 'do', 'win', 'challenge', 'convince', 'Spenny', 'won', 'even', ""n't"", 'try', 'find', 'loophole', 'criteria', 'challenge', 'usually', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'questionable', 'validity', 'be', 'impressively', 'clever.There', 'were', 'also', 'moments', 'made', 'wonder', 'parts', 'show', 'were', 'scripted', 'most', 'glaring', 'example', 'being', 'when', 'Spenny', 'vial', 'testosterone', 'fridge', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'used', 'Kenny', 'sister', 'who', ""n't"", 'live', 'house', 'presumably', ""n't"", 'come', 'very', 'often', 'Kenny', 'and/or', 'sister', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'expect', 'Spenny', 'find', 'vial', 'way', 'anyone', 'actually', 'stupid.It', 'still', 'kinda', 'entertaining', 'show', 'more', 'weak', 'points', 'strong', 'points', 'one', 'more', 'disappointing', 'dvd', 'tv', 'show', 'purchases', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', '30', 'Days']",Kenny Vs.

The concept may be simple (i.e., two friends engage in competitions with each other with the loser having to do something humiliating); however, the way Kenny and Spenny feed off of each other is priceless.  It makes the show that much better.  Kenny is willing to do whatever it takes to win (i.e., lie, cheat, steal, etc&#8230;), whereas, Spenny (who considers himself a true competitor) tries to win in an honest fashion.  Spenny may be the more annoying of the two, but his reactions to Kenny&#8217;s antics are simply the best.
