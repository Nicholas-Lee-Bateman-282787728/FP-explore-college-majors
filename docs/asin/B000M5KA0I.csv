1043794,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000M5KA0I,Aion,"[0, 0]","Scrapped Princess is one of those series that's simply enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The main characters are all likeable (a huge plus for an anime very focused on the central characters), the plot is great and the music is good... There's not much more you can ask for out of an anime, is there?The problem? The R1 Scrapped Princess DVD's. For whatever reason, nearly all the episodes suffer from serious dot crawl and shimmering/rainbowing issues that would really ruin the visuals for anyone watching on a HDTV/LCD monitor. The episodes suffering from dot crawl are easy to spot since the title shows at its worst right at the start and you can't really miss the shimmering/rainbowing. I hoped these issues would only exist on the first 2 episodes after they vanished on episodes 3 and 4, but the issues are there in the vast majority of the episodes.The R4 (Aussie) DVD's don't show the dotcrawl and shimmering/rainbowing issues anywhere near as much, so it's rather shocking the R1 releases were allowed to be sold without these issues being worked out as much as possible.I'm giving this a 4/5 because the series itself is excellent and this set is VERY cheap for what's included. My rating would be 2-3/5 if it was for the individual volumes due to how bad the video quality is.",4,"Excellent anime, poor R1 video quality.",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,1296,"['Scrapped', 'Princess', 'one', 'series', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'huge', 'plus', 'anime', 'very', 'focused', 'central', 'characters', 'plot', 'great', 'music', 'good', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'out', 'anime', 'there', 'problem', 'R1', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'DVD', 'reason', 'nearly', 'episodes', 'suffer', 'serious', 'dot', 'crawl', 'shimmering/rainbowing', 'issues', 'would', 'really', 'ruin', 'visuals', 'anyone', 'watching', 'HDTV/LCD', 'monitor', 'episodes', 'suffering', 'dot', 'crawl', 'are', 'easy', 'spot', 'title', 'worst', 'right', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'shimmering/rainbowing', 'hoped', 'issues', 'would', 'only', 'exist', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'vanished', 'episodes', '3', '4', 'issues', 'are', 'there', 'vast', 'majority', 'episodes.The', 'R4', 'Aussie', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'dotcrawl', 'shimmering/rainbowing', 'issues', 'anywhere', 'as', 'much', 'rather', 'shocking', 'R1', 'releases', 'were', 'allowed', 'be', 'sold', 'issues', 'being', 'worked', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'possible.I', ""'m"", 'giving', '4/5', 'series', 'excellent', 'set', 'VERY', 'cheap', 'what', 'included', 'rating', 'would', 'be', '2-3/5', 'was', 'individual', 'volumes', 'due', 'how', 'bad', 'video', 'quality']",Scrapped Princess - Anime Legends Complete Collection

I thought this would be any other fantasy anime that's out there, but I'm glad to say that I was surprised by this anime--more animes should be like this.Pacifica Casstul's life is a rough one and for good reason--she's fated to destroy the world according to St. Grendel when she's 16 years old.  Her father, the king, threw her out and ordered her murdered to prevent her from destroying the world.  However, she survives and has an adopted brother and sister to look after her.

I must say I was glad I did. The story line and the characters are very likable and you'll get hooked by episode 5 at least. There isn't any great fighting scenes, so if you're expecting that, forget it. It's meant to be a somewhat drama/comedic type anime and it achieves that well. The voice acting in English and Japanese are well done as is the animation quality. Music lacks a bit, with the same ending (which is pretty good) and opening(which I couldn't stand) songs.

Plus, Crispin Freeman has become one of my favorite American voice actors, and I prefer the English dubs when he is one of the cast.If you want any plot reviews look up others' reviews, but basically the story revolves around the 'scrapped princess' who is destined to cause the destruction of the world on her 16th birthday.  Her adopted siblings vow to protect her from virtually every person in the world since they all want her dead.  This is an amazing, underrated series that is a STEAL in the legends collection packaging.  Buy it and you will not be disappointed.Pros: Animation, voice acting, plot, action, mystery, characterizationCons: Really nothing except the goofy intro song =)Viewing Preference: Both ways, though watch first in English for a few episodes before deciding.

I ran out of items that I considered higher priority and bought this not expecting too much.Was I wrong!The story is told very well... and though it is medieval in its appearance it is filled with creative technology.In addition the classic argument that can be seen in Shirow Masamune's ""Appleseed"" (and many others) is delivered in a new package, but not really seen in new light.Is it better to live in ignorance inside the safety of a gilded cage or be free even at the cost of your own destruction?This take on this age old question is delightful.The characters have meaningful relationships with each other. The relationships are contrasted with the backstories of the subordinate characters who want this kind of special relationship but can only enjoy/experience it by being associated with the Scrapped-Princess and her guardians.A story of love, but not a story of lovers. More of a story about someone very special and that person's protectors.You could compare the relationships to that of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in the cult classic by Luc Besson ""The Professional"". The relationships are not sexual but they ARE Powerful and leave you aching when the story is over... like saying good bye to friends.(Yes, yes... the directors cut of ""The Professional"" was a little more suggestive... but it still wasn't a sexual relationship.)All and all this collection is a keeper.I gave it 4 stars in stead of 5 because the episodes seemed a bit short and the artwork seemed clean but flat (we need more Haruhiko Mikimoto types out there).

With Pacifica are her brother Shannon(Voiced By Shinichiro MIKI/Crispin Freeman)and her sister Raquel(Voiced By Sayaka OHARA/Bridget Hoffman)who act as both her protectors and family.  During the series you will find out who Pacifica's true parents are and why the supposed messengers of the gods fear her and what she truly is prophecized to do.  Along the way the Casull family will find both friends and foes that help them and surprisingly some who you would think enemies become trusted friends.  The video is standard format with Japanese/English audio and both the English and Japanese voice actors are superb in this series.  The extrasaren't much just what you expect with most of the complete sets just some trailers and text-less intro/ending songs the animation is sharp and clear and the music for the series is pretty decent.
