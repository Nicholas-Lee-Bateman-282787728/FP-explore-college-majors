307367,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,6302316049,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[2, 3]","The Enterprise meet with the USS Fearless, a ship that recently had its Warp drive performance improved significantly by a supposed propulsion expert and consultant named Kosinski (Stanley Kamel). Kosinski is a pompous ass from the get-go and he rubs everyone the wrong way. He comes with his assistant who is from Tau Alpha-C, a world on the far reaches of the Milky Way. He has a name that is not pronouncable by humans, but refers to himself simply as Kosinski's assistant, and later as a ""Traveler.""The Chief Engineer and Riker look over Kosinski's specs for intermix changes and surmise that his calculations are utter gibberish - that they will have absolutely no affect on the engines and absolutely won't improve them.While Kosinski is working in main Engineering with Riker and the Chief over his shoulder, the Traveler is huddled away at another work station. Kosinski says his assistant will enter in other calculations much faster than a human can - but this is laughable when you see that he only has 3 fat fingers on each hand and you never see him move even half as fast as a human - he's like a humanoid sloth, actually.Wesley, who was already in Engineering as part of a school project, quickly befriends the Traveler and the Traveler takes an instant interest in Wesley when he realizes that Wesley understands much more than what he should at his tender age. He realizes that when it comes to space-time and travel, Wesley is the equivalent of an idiot savant - a freakin' genius, but he is still just a boy. Poor Wesley - he is made out to be such a geek and one has to wonder why the wardrobe department thought he would look like a normal teenage boy wearing what looks like his mom's cable-knit sweater - geeky-uncool.The Traveler gets distracted by Wesley and all of a sudden the warp engines go into overdrive - and that's a major understatement. Before they know it, they are nearly 3 million light years from where they were - they have travelled not only past their own galaxy, but through 2 more when they finally answer all-stop.At maximum warp, it will take them 300 years to get back home and their computer registers that they have only been travelling at warp 1.5 the whole time, but travelled to galaxy M-33 in about 3 minutes. Kosinski claims he made a mistake, but ""a wonderful  mistake"" and now claims that he has changed the way starships will travel. The Chief Engineer tries to keep from wetting himself, because the premise is laughable, since all Kosinski was doing was entering in calculations and they couldn't have been responsible for what has happened - but in the absence of another explaination, they decide to let Kosinski try to do the same thing, but in reverse so they can get home.Wesley was the only one who noticed that the Traveler ""phased"" during the whacky ride and he tries to tell Riker twice, but Riker keeps saying, ""not now, Wesley!"" and shrugs him off like an annoying insect.During the attempt to go home, things go even wrong-er! All of a sudden they are over a BILLION light years from home and really weird crap starts happening all over the ship. Worf sees his pet targ on the bridge, then it vanishes, then Tasha sees her pet kitty from when she was being chased by rape gangs on her homeworld and Picard sees his grandmother ""Maman"" down a corridor, followed by an ensign that starts doing a ballet in the cargo bay.The Traveler is near death - exhausted and Dr. Crusher doesn't even know how to treat him because of his unusual physiology. During the second trip to the outer rim of the universe, Riker sees the Traveler phase and now regrets he didn't listen to Wesley the first time. It is now clear that Kosinski was indeed typing in gibberish and that the improvements to other Starfleet engines were work of the Traveler.Picard is in a pickle - they will be travelling at Warp 9.9 for about a million years to get home - and a high speed like that can't even be maintained for long. Their only hope is to have the Traveler's help. The Traveler, almost too weak to walk, apologizes for putting them in this situation and promises he will try to get them back home. Before they head back to engineering, the Traveler shares some interesting information with Picard about Wesley - a foreshadowing of things to come in 2 future episodes, one in which Dr. Crusher gets stuck in a static warp bubble and another one in which Wesley manages to start a war with Cardassia and leaves his career.An important episode on many fronts and the beginning of Wesley's career as he is made acting-Ensign. Cheesy in many areas, but still a solid episode.",4,time and space and thought,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,4615,"['Enterprise', 'meet', 'USS', 'Fearless', 'ship', 'recently', 'had', 'Warp', 'drive', 'performance', 'improved', 'significantly', 'supposed', 'propulsion', 'expert', 'consultant', 'named', 'Kosinski', 'Stanley', 'Kamel', 'Kosinski', 'pompous', 'ass', 'get-go', 'everyone', 'wrong', 'way', 'assistant', 'who', 'Tau', 'Alpha-C', 'world', 'far', 'Milky', 'Way', 'name', 'not', 'pronouncable', 'humans', 'refers', 'simply', 'Kosinski', 'assistant', 'later', 'Traveler', 'Chief', 'Engineer', 'Riker', 'look', 'Kosinski', 'specs', 'intermix', 'changes', 'surmise', 'calculations', 'are', 'utter', 'gibberish', 'will', 'have', 'absolutely', 'affect', 'engines', 'absolutely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'improve', 'them.While', 'Kosinski', 'working', 'main', 'Engineering', 'Riker', 'Chief', 'shoulder', 'Traveler', 'huddled', 'away', 'work', 'station', 'Kosinski', 'assistant', 'will', 'enter', 'other', 'calculations', 'much', 'faster', 'human', 'can', 'laughable', 'when', 'see', 'only', '3', 'fat', 'fingers', 'hand', 'never', 'see', 'move', 'even', 'half', 'fast', 'human', 'humanoid', 'sloth', 'actually.Wesley', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'Engineering', 'part', 'school', 'project', 'quickly', 'Traveler', 'Traveler', 'instant', 'interest', 'Wesley', 'when', 'Wesley', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'should', 'tender', 'age', 'when', 'space-time', 'travel', 'Wesley', 'equivalent', 'idiot', 'savant', 'freakin', 'genius', 'still', 'just', 'boy', 'Poor', 'Wesley', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'geek', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'wardrobe', 'department', 'thought', 'would', 'look', 'normal', 'teenage', 'boy', 'wearing', 'what', 'mom', 'cable-knit', 'sweater', 'geeky-uncool.The', 'Traveler', 'distracted', 'Wesley', 'sudden', 'warp', 'engines', 'go', 'overdrive', 'major', 'understatement', 'know', 'are', 'nearly', '3', 'million', 'light', 'years', 'where', 'were', 'have', 'travelled', 'not', 'only', 'past', 'own', 'galaxy', '2', 'more', 'when', 'finally', 'answer', 'all-stop.At', 'maximum', 'warp', 'will', 'take', '300', 'years', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'computer', 'registers', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'travelling', '1.5', 'whole', 'time', 'travelled', 'galaxy', 'M-33', 'about', '3', 'minutes', 'Kosinski', 'made', 'mistake', 'wonderful', 'mistake', 'now', 'changed', 'way', 'starships', 'will', 'travel', 'Chief', 'Engineer', 'keep', 'wetting', 'premise', 'laughable', 'Kosinski', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'entering', 'calculations', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'what', 'happened', 'absence', 'explaination', 'decide', 'let', 'Kosinski', 'try', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'reverse', 'can', 'get', 'home.Wesley', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'Traveler', 'phased', 'whacky', 'ride', 'tell', 'Riker', 'twice', 'Riker', 'saying', 'not', 'now', 'Wesley', 'shrugs', 'off', 'annoying', 'insect.During', 'attempt', 'go', 'home', 'things', 'go', 'even', 'wrong-er', 'sudden', 'are', 'BILLION', 'light', 'years', 'home', 'really', 'weird', 'crap', 'happening', 'ship', 'Worf', 'pet', 'targ', 'bridge', 'then', 'then', 'Tasha', 'pet', 'kitty', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'chased', 'rape', 'gangs', 'homeworld', 'Picard', 'grandmother', 'Maman', 'down', 'corridor', 'followed', 'ensign', 'doing', 'ballet', 'cargo', 'bay.The', 'Traveler', 'death', 'exhausted', 'Dr.', 'Crusher', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'treat', 'unusual', 'physiology', 'second', 'trip', 'outer', 'rim', 'universe', 'Riker', 'Traveler', 'phase', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Wesley', 'first', 'time', 'now', 'clear', 'Kosinski', 'was', 'indeed', 'typing', 'gibberish', 'improvements', 'other', 'Starfleet', 'engines', 'were', 'work', 'Traveler.Picard', 'pickle', 'will', 'be', 'travelling', 'Warp', '9.9', 'million', 'years', 'get', 'home', 'high', 'speed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'maintained', 'long', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'Traveler', 'help', 'Traveler', 'almost', 'too', 'weak', 'walk', 'apologizes', 'putting', 'situation', 'will', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'head', 'back', 'engineering', 'Traveler', 'shares', 'interesting', 'information', 'Picard', 'Wesley', 'foreshadowing', 'things', 'come', '2', 'future', 'episodes', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Crusher', 'stuck', 'static', 'warp', 'bubble', 'one', 'Wesley', 'start', 'war', 'Cardassia', 'career.An', 'important', 'episode', 'many', 'fronts', 'beginning', 'Wesley', 'career', 'made', 'acting-Ensign', 'Cheesy', 'many', 'areas', 'still', 'solid', 'episode']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 6: Where No One Has Gone Before VHS"
307368,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6302316049,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 1]","Certainly the most interesting development in Wesley Crusher's (Wil Wheaton) character during the first season was his initial meeting with the Traveler (Eric Menyuk) in ""Where No One Has Gone Before.""  Not only was the Traveler the most interesting alien introduced in the early going of the series but the special bond he would form with Wesley would be integral to the evolution of the latter in future episodes.Specialist Kosinski (Stanley Kamel) boards the Enterprise-D with boastful claims that he can magically improve the efficiency of the ship's warp engines.  Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frankes) and Chief Engineer Argyle (Biff Yeager) are skeptical of their visitor but they allow him to continue with his upgrades.  Wesley becomes intrigued with Kosinki's assistant, an alien called the Traveler, who turns out to be the secret behind Kosinki's past success.  The truth behind the charade is exposed after the Traveler accidentally hurls the Enterprise into another dimension.""Where No One Has Gone Before"" starkly illustrates another difference the new Star Trek series would have from its predecessor.  The special effects that depict the Enterprise's journey into the unknown are of feature film quality and easily outdoes anything seen on the original series.  The guest stars are strong also with Menyuk turning in a very memorable performance as Wesley's future mentor.  It is no surprise that the producers decided to make him a recurring character after his work in this episode.  In sum, ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" was a welcome outing that broke a run of average episodes.",3,"""Is Mister Kosinski what he seems?

Enterprise and crew bring aboard a cocky warp engines mechanic and his assistant to do tests on the starship&#8217;s new warp engines and even more.The U.S.S. Enterprise has intercepted the U.S.S. Fearless and brings aboard a cocky warp engines mechanic named Kosinski and his assistant on board the Enterprise.They head to Engineering and begin the first test, with the Enterprise going at warp 1.5. The assistant does a mistake and begins to dematerialize in the engine room. After that, the Enterprise goes into super-warp, going past warp 10. On the viewscreen, quasars and pulsars go flying past the Enterprise. Picard orders the starship to come to a full stop. The starship Enterprise ends up in a different galaxy than their own. La Forge calculates that the Enterprise has ended up on the far side of the Triangulum Galaxy, also known as M-33 and they left their own galaxy and passed two other ones. Picard asks Data how far they have traveled. Data says that the Enterprise has gone 2,700,000 light-years from their former position. That&#8217;s impossible! La Forge calculates that it will take the starship three centuries even at their fastest speed. Kosinski explains what happened to the Enterprise when they were in warp.Picard asks Kosinski to do the same thing as before to get back to the galaxy they live in, and Kosinski agrees and heads back to the Engine Room. They do it again and the assistant begins dematerializing again and this time Riker sees what is happening to the ship. The Enterprise goes into super-warp and suddenly, disappears from the Triangulum Galaxy. The starship starts to shake violently. They stop again, and they aren&#8217;t in their galaxy but in another strange one. Picard asks what the place is called.  Data says for his friend, &#8220;Where none have gone before.&#8221; The U.S.S. Enterprise&#8217;s present position is at least over a billion light-years from their own galaxy. Picard heads to the Engine Room and sees the alien dying.  Later, in Sickbay, the alien calls himself a &#8220;traveler&#8221;. The reason the Enterprise is in this galaxy because the warp formula had thought in it. He also tells him that Wesley is special and must get the best attention like Mozart, the famous composer of the 17th and 18th centuries. As Picard tries to get to the Bridge, a crewman is thinking of fire and is trapped. Picard tells the crewman to put it out in his thoughts. It works, and he continues his duties.  Picard talks to the crew to think of the Traveler or his or her duty, it might be enough to get the crew back to the Milky Way Galaxy.Picard puts the starship on Red Alert and gets ready to go back to the Milky Way Galaxy. Counselor Troi and Lt. Yar tell Picard that there will be stress and general fear by the crew. Picard orders La Forge to set a retroactive course to get back to the Milky Way Galaxy, and The Enterprise goes to warp speed. They are getting faster and it is not enough yet. What&#8217;s worse, is that the alien is trying to dematerialize again. It was enough, and the alien disappears. What&#8217;s also great, is that the Enterprise is back in the Alpha Quadrant and back in their galaxy.La Forge calls this trip through the universe a &#8220;sleigh ride.&#8221; Captain Picard summons Wesley and has been commissioned &#8220;Acting Ensign&#8221; Until Starfleet Academy can accept him.
