Not all is fun and games and what is important wins in the end.Only one problem here was it was not worth more than ten dollars on DVD. Well they finally lowered the price, and I plan to get a copy.

165543,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0800176936,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Between 1992 and 1996, Pauly Shore was a star. After the modest hit Encino Man in 1992, he appeared in the moderately successful Son-in-Law in 1993 and In the Army Now in 1994. Then, in 1995, came Jury Duty, the first step in his downward spiral that culminated in 1996's Bio-Dome, effectively ending this chapter of Pauly Shore's career. After 1996, Shore would never again headline a widely released comedy. Was it because the critics hated him from the start? Was it because audiences tired of his shenanigans? Perhaps it was because he cut his hair? Regardless, his choice of film roles did not help. Jury Duty is an amateurish, lazily written film that two scenes in is obviously a product of the `90s.Shore plays Tommy, too lazy and perhaps too stupid to get a job. Babied by his mother (Shelley Winters...rather unfortunately), Tommy lives comfortably and care-free in their trailer home until his father and mother take off with the trailer for Las Vegas and leave Tommy with no food or shelter and only his dog Peanut as a companion. When Tommy is given jury duty to decide the fate of Carl Wayne Bishop (Sean Whalen), who has been accused of murdering fast food employees, Tommy sees it as an opportunity to have a place to stay and food to eat for a while as a member of the sequestered jury.Obviously, Tommy would be immediately booted from any jury but this movie is just a showcase for Pauly Shore and realism is irrelevant to such a movie. Once on the jury, Tommy finds himself roommates with his former school principal and attempts to woo a fellow juror named Monica (Tia Carrere). There are some familiar faces included in Jury Duty, but, unfortunately for Shore, they are of actors who went on to much better careers. Stanley Tucci (who would go on to an Oscar nomination) plays a juror and looks embarrassed, while Jack McGee (terrific as Mark Wahlberg's father in 2010's The Fighter) plays the sheriff in charge of watching the jury.Jury Duty was released in the wake of the media circus that was the O.J. Simpson trial, yet has a remarkable amount of relevance today, especially in the wake of the recent Casey Anthony trial. The strongest jokes in the film satirize the media and Jury Duty could have been an effective satire on the harmful effects of media coverage on judiciary trials. There are some clever lines, but strong satire doesn't seem to be a goal of this movie. I don't blame Shore for this either, but the three screenwriters behind this movie. Alas, it doesn't appear that any of these writers put any effort into the script and it's no surprise that only one went on to write more films. There's just no effort in the script; many, many jokes fall flat on their face. Some are so weak; the best delivery couldn't save them. There's a needless love interest, but there is no charisma. No charisma between Shore and the actress, but nothing in the script that suggests there should be charisma either. There's no character development and the whole plot feels haphazardly strewn together. Shore's characters in Son-in-Law and Encino Man were developed. Jury Duty just says ""here's Tommy. He's a loser."" He's also a one-note character that the writers seemed to write worthless ideas around to form their story. The biggest sin of the script is blatant continuity errors and complete lapses in logic. In one instance, a juror has tickets to a basketball game and says they are for that night. After Tommy keeps the jury going late, the juror angrily tears his tickets in half. After we see him tear them up, we see him with them again not once but twice more. There should be no reason to explain how this defies both logic and physics. The script also expects audiences to believe that Tommy has a complete change of character overnight. Since Tommy is underdeveloped, there's no reason to root for him or believe that his underdeveloped character can change on a whim into a different underdeveloped character.The film itself is amateurishly made, cheap-looking and directed with no sense of humor. Not that it takes itself seriously, but tired gags like a face (unconvincingly) hitting a window and sliding down are expected to make people laugh. Not even the addition of an adorable dog redeems the film. With that said, I must admit there were moments of amusement. The montage of Shore getting kicked off of various juries made me laugh, I found the satire of media amusing and relevant, and the infomercial for a night-light that looks like the accused killer in an electric chair was quite funny. But with bored looking actors and a convoluted, illogical, idiotic, and rushed ending that passes in minutes yet seems like it's taking forever, there's no saving grace here.I like Pauly Shore and I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's something so `90s about his existence and, as a child of the `90s, there's something about his presence that brings me back to those years. Still, the fact remains, Pauly Shore is a one-dimensional actor. There's nothing wrong with being one-dimensional in the comedy genre as long as you're funny. Shore didn't sit right with critics, who never found him funny nor did audiences tolerate him for more than a brief time. Eventually, everyone seemed to conclude that Pauly's ""Weasel shtick"" was obnoxious, unlikable, and (the ultimate comedic sin) not funny. I've found Shore's heyday films are at least passable and at worst one-note. Jury Duty is just a terrible film.GRADE: D-",2,The Beginning of the Death of Pauly Shore's Career,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,5454,"['Between', '1992', '1996', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'was', 'star',

You know it's going to be a fabulous film when the movie opens with Shore as a male stripper whose onstage persona is ""The Milkman"" at the ""International House of Beefcakes."" Pauly Shore in a sequined thong writhing in milk is a sight I could have done without for the rest of my life.Shore wriggles his way onto a jury in a sensational murder trial and repeatedly annoys Abe Vigoda, whose portrayal of a judge and utter contempt for Shore gets the nod for best performance in the movie. Shore ends up in love with fellow juror Tia Carrere, and has unusual relationships with his former principal, the accused, and several other oddballs. Along the way we are treated to typical Shore humor showcases, many of which involve the bathroom (extended physiological needs, ducks in the tub, etc.,) cross-dressing, or his ugly dog who is addicted to watching ""Jeopardy.""In a completely predictable turn of fate, Shore ends up being a cross between Columbo and Clouseau as he solves a felony, causes a mistrial, and becomes a national and environmental hero. It was a forgone conclusion that Shore would end up the hero and get the pretty girl, so if you want to see that, this movie might appeal to you.
