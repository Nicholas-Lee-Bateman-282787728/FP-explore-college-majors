Sydney Penny is perfect in this lovely story as a young, beautiful widow with two children who has her faith tested when everything seems to go wrong in her life. There is something about Penny's performance that is subtle yet strong, as well as delicate but very moving. And of course she is such a natural beauty that all those qualities become even more appealing. And Jason Gedrick also does a fine job as the mysterious war veteran with the goood manners and kind ways that draws Penny into a sweet relationship with this gentle but strong man. Throw in the great Shirley Jones as the ever prodding and full-of-faith Aunt Batty, and you have a wonderful story and beautifully produced film that tugs at the heart and delivers such a heart-warming finish that you will want to play this one over again, and again.

1007993,A2F5B0TI5FK4AZ,B000GYI048,A Sharer,"[3, 3]","I really love Gabe (Jason Gedrick); he is adorable, believable, handsome; modest; plays the part perfectly; is able to make the transitions credible as he slowly fits in to and rises to meet the challenges of, his new situation.  I love how he surprises the family with his honest, touching blessings at each meal. The story is very sweet (no sex, violence or offensive language, though there is a death and crying and a beautiful, loving kissing scene), and the period costumes and scenery are nice. The slow gentle pace is wonderful, for there is time to really feel into the characters' experience and emotions. The kids are fantastic actors and really cute.  Shirley Jones of course is an amazing actress but there is something that doesn't work - it is not her fault; she plays her part wonderfully, with a knowing and lovingness that comes with age, a perfect elderly female relative. She has a strong faith which I love, but maybe it is just too much, too intnese, maybe she is trying too hard or it is just the way it has been edited/directed, and Sydney Penny (Eliza) (though Sydney is a great actress) doesn't click with her in a believable way. I know Eliza is meant to be more doubtful, but there is a woodenness to how she relates to Aunt Batty, and she also has undertones of anger that just seem to get in the way for me. Eliza is tough and strong, and there is a scen where she speaks to the children after the funeral that is wonderful; in fact, the way she is with the kids is great. But I just wish that as the story plays out, she softens more, especially with Gabe and Aunt Batty - there is a lingering hardness to her that I wish would surrender, as she and Gabe get together. I guess I admire Eliza for her courage and for how dear she is to the kids, but I just don't like her. I lost respect for her when she sneaked looking at the journal, and Batty encouraged it - and they continued!  And why does she  continue to agree to be called ""Batty""?  She is not batty; she is the most grounded, wise and strong person in the story.  Also, the way the scenes are edited sometimes is mechanical, like there is a scene thrown in where Batty is laughing but it just seems artificial. Barry Corbin the sheriff is believable with his slow southern drawl. Much of this is very well done, with gorgeous scenes of orange groves and people doing kind things for others and happy togetherness, and  a twist or three at the end, with a very satisfying and beautiful ending. It shows how people coming together in hard times can lift each other up and support each other in taking risks that are for the greatest good, for choosing the high road, with patience and trust.",3,"Wonderful acting and story, but something didn't work",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,2679,"['really', 'love', 'Gabe', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'adorable', 'believable', 'handsome', 'modest', 'part', 'perfectly', 'able', 'make', 'transitions', 'credible', 'fits', 'rises', 'meet', 'challenges', 'new', 'situation', 'love', 'how', 'family', 'honest', 'touching', 'blessings', 'meal', 'story', 'very', 'sweet', 'sex', 'violence', 'offensive', 'language', 'death', 'crying', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'kissing', 'scene', 'period', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'are', 'nice', 'slow', 'gentle', 'pace', 'wonderful', 'time', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'experience', 'emotions', 'kids', 'are', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'really', 'cute', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'course', 'amazing', 'actress', 'something', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'fault', 'part', 'wonderfully', 'knowing', 'lovingness', 'age', 'perfect', 'elderly', 'female', 'relative', 'strong', 'faith', 'love', 'maybe', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'intnese', 'maybe', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'just', 'way', 'been', 'edited/directed', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'Eliza', 'Sydney', 'great', 'actress', ""n't"", 'click', 'believable', 'way', 'know', 'Eliza', 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'doubtful', 'woodenness', 'how', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'also', 'undertones', 'anger', 'just', 'seem', 'get', 'way', 'Eliza', 'tough', 'strong', 'scen', 'where', 'children', 'funeral', 'wonderful', 'fact', 'way', 'kids', 'great', 'just', 'wish', 'story', 'out', 'more', 'especially', 'Gabe', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'lingering', 'hardness', 'wish', 'would', 'surrender', 'Gabe', 'get', 'together', 'guess', 'admire', 'Eliza', 'courage', 'how', 'dear', 'kids', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lost', 'respect', 'when', 'sneaked', 'looking', 'journal', 'Batty', 'encouraged', 'continued', 'why', 'continue', 'agree', 'be', 'called', 'Batty', 'not', 'batty', 'most', 'grounded', 'wise', 'strong', 'person', 'story', 'Also', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'edited', 'sometimes', 'mechanical', 'scene', 'thrown', 'where', 'Batty', 'laughing', 'just', 'artificial', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'sheriff', 'believable', 'slow', 'southern', 'drawl', 'Much', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'orange', 'groves', 'people', 'doing', 'kind', 'things', 'others', 'happy', 'togetherness', 'twist', 'three', 'end', 'very', 'satisfying', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'how', 'people', 'coming', 'together', 'hard', 'times', 'can', 'lift', 'other', 'up', 'support', 'other', 'taking', 'risks', 'are', 'greatest', 'good', 'choosing', 'high', 'road', 'patience', 'trust']",Hidden Places

1008000,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000GYI048,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[11, 11]","Now and then, it's okay to pause in that quest to be ever hip; it's okay to take a breath and clamp down on contemporary cynicism, and to let out the inner romantic. So curl up with your loved ones and see this one, do, if you're in the mood for a sentimental, good old-fashioned slice of Americana. The mild heads-up is that HIDDEN PLACES offers no twisty topsy-turvy plot, no ""Hey, notice me!"" performances by anyone in the cast, or gimmicky special effects, or trendy innovative camera shots. HIDDEN PLACES, boiled down, is simply a warm and watchable made-for-television movie, structured on the bedrock of professional acting and solid narrative. The bonus is that it's also a period piece.Set in the backdrop of 1930s California, deep in the Depression era, this Hallmark Channel piece tells of a young widow named Eliza (Sydney Penny) who struggles to keep her home and her as yet unharvested orange orchard. But a death in the family devastates Eliza and her two little children and a looming debilitating mortgage payment may just be the final nail in the coffin. But, then, unlikely aid arrives in the shape of a grief-stricken hobo.Who isn't a sap for hardluck stories? The plot to HIDDEN PLACES won't surprise anyone, but the cast still makes it work, and beautifully.  Sydney Penny simply looks radiant and she offers up an intimate, heartfelt performance; I wouldn't mind at all seeing her in more films, if she can just sneak away from her soap opera gig. Jason Gedrick is low key but effective as Gabriel Harper, the down-and-out WWI veteran now riding the rails but who sticks around long enough to lend a hand. And with these two leads looking the way they look and with that bit of spark between them, you can probably figure out how the rest of the story unfolds. The supporting cast is first rate, including the two kid actors and especially Shirley Jones, who plays the unconventional Aunt Batty. Aunt Batty, besides providing moral support for and dispensing a series of practical advice to Eliza, proves to be the catalyst to bringing Eliza and Gabe together. And it's always neat to see Mrs. Partridge.You'll have to overlook the cliche about the evil banking institution, of course. That's pretty much par for the course in films like this. HIDDEN PLACES is a lovely little gem, and one you can spend happily watching with your children and your parents. Even though the film takes place decades and decades after the frontier and settler days, it still hearkens to that strong can-do pioneer spirit. The movie speaks of putting in that good sweat and perseverance and harboring compassion and a measure of trust for those not so lucky as you. All this is old-fashioned stuff, and tried and true, but certainly these messages haven't lost any of their timeliness. And I'm thinking, we should maybe thank Hallmark Channel for safeguarding and nourishing its tiny corner of wholesome.",4,If you're down with good old-fashioned family movies...,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2908,"['Now', 'then', 'okay', 'pause', 'quest', 'be', 'ever', 'hip', 'okay', 'take', 'breath', 'clamp', 'down', 'contemporary', 'cynicism', 'let', 'out', 'inner', 'romantic', 'So', 'curl', 'loved', 'ones', 'see', 'one', 'do', ""'re"", 'mood', 'sentimental', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'slice', 'Americana', 'mild', 'heads-up', 'HIDDEN', 'PLACES', 'twisty', 'topsy-turvy', 'plot', 'Hey', 'performances', 'anyone', 'cast', 'gimmicky', 'special', 'effects', 'trendy', 'innovative', 'camera', 'shots', 'HIDDEN', 'PLACES', 'boiled', 'down', 'simply', 'warm', 'watchable', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'structured', 'bedrock', 'professional', 'acting', 'solid', 'narrative', 'bonus', 'also', 'period', 'piece.Set', 'backdrop', '1930s', 'California', 'deep', 'Depression', 'era', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'piece', 'tells', 'young', 'widow', 'named', 'Eliza', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'who', 'keep', 'home', 'as', 'yet', 'unharvested', 'orange', 'orchard', 'death', 'family', 'Eliza', 'two', 'little', 'children', 'looming', 'debilitating', 'mortgage', 'payment', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'then', 'unlikely', 'aid', 'shape', 'grief-stricken', 'hobo.Who', ""n't"", 'sap', 'hardluck', 'stories', 'plot', 'HIDDEN', 'PLACES', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'cast', 'still', 'work', 'beautifully', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'simply', 'radiant', 'up', 'intimate', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'films', 'can', 'just', 'sneak', 'away', 'soap', 'opera', 'gig', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'low', 'key', 'effective', 'Gabriel', 'Harper', 'down-and-out', 'WWI', 'veteran', 'now', 'riding', 'rails', 'who', 'sticks', 'long', 'enough', 'lend', 'hand', 'two', 'leads', 'looking', 'way', 'look', 'bit', 'spark', 'can', 'probably', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'rest', 'story', 'unfolds', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'including', 'two', 'kid', 'actors', 'especially', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'who', 'unconventional', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'providing', 'moral', 'support', 'dispensing', 'series', 'practical', 'advice', 'Eliza', 'be', 'catalyst', 'bringing', 'Eliza', 'Gabe', 'together', 'always', 'neat', 'see', 'Mrs.', 'Partridge.You', ""'ll"", 'have', 'overlook', 'cliche', 'evil', 'banking', 'institution', 'course', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'course', 'films', 'HIDDEN', 'PLACES', 'lovely', 'little', 'gem', 'one', 'can', 'spend', 'happily', 'watching', 'children', 'parents', 'Even', 'film', 'place', 'decades', 'decades', 'frontier', 'settler', 'days', 'still', 'strong', 'can-do', 'pioneer', 'spirit', 'movie', 'speaks', 'putting', 'good', 'sweat', 'perseverance', 'harboring', 'compassion', 'measure', 'trust', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'old-fashioned', 'stuff', 'tried', 'true', 'certainly', 'messages', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'timeliness', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'should', 'maybe', 'thank', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'safeguarding', 'nourishing', 'tiny', 'corner', 'wholesome']",Hidden Places

Of course you knew how it would end but the getting there was told in such a good way.  I have always loved Shirley Jones.  She did a fantastic job as Aunt Batty.  The role showed there is truth in the old adage "" With age comes wisdom"".  The story takes place in a time I can barely remember.  I was born during WWII. I've heard about the hard times during the depression and that helped me to understand more than some of the younger people who might be considering purchasing this dvd.  My advice is buy it.  It is more truth than fiction and might give you some insight into the lives of your grandparents or perhaps the generation before them.  There are lessons to be learned and this movie is the vehicle for some of them.  The story moves clearly through the lives of ordinary people and shows their extraordinary strength. The actors are well cast for their roles.  I hope you buy it and enjoy it as much as I did.

A mysterious hobo shows up to help.  What's his story?  What's her story? Will the farm be saved from foreclosure?  Will romance ensue?I like the actors: Sydney Penny as the suffering, worried mom.  I remember her from (I believe) the TV show Gidget and Pale Rider with Clint Eastwood; Shirley Jones as the wise, faithful aunt; Jason Gedrick, I like him better in The Christmas Choir, nice romance in that one, too.  He also was in a sci-fi giant worm movie!  I have to say he always gives it his all.  Kind of king of the made for TV movies.  The child actors and all the veterans perform very well, too.My gripe, the story's a tad over the top on sweetness and making it's point.  Plus, they really needed to tone down or drop the musical background some.  It's sappy.  Less is more!  ***SPOILER***  And there's a big hole in the tale when the hero leaves unexpectantly without a word or note, much to the distraught of the family at the worse possible time, totally out of character- done for obvious dramatic effect.***END SPOILER***I know, I know, it's Hallmark, and it's well made with beautiful, country scenery, clean and family friendly.

The photography and location are fabulous.  What I really wonder is if the producers even read Ms Austin's book.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hold them to the letter of the book but I would think the book was chosen for it's richness, the movie totally eliminates the depth which sets the book apart in the first place. This is a book about a woman and her children who have fallen on hard times during the depression, a drifter and their Aunt Batty.  (Who can not like Shirley Jones as Aunt Batty but!!!!!)  The book is called Hidden Places, it is about people who are wounded ,broken shells because of the ""loved ones"" in their lives who abuse, torment, devalue and reject them.  Aunt Batty is so because she has been til the onset of the book somewhat a recluse, a nobody but she is really aloving, albeit eccentric individual with hurts and a past of her own.  She lives life to the full and loves to the full.  To totally leave out this diminsion of the book is in my opinion to leave out what sets it apart as a fine book and leaves the movie therefore a little flat and lifeless.",4,Lacks soul!,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,1278,"['casting', 'wonderful', 'even', 'secondary', 'characters', 'children', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'little', 'darker', 'resemble', 'mother', 'really', 'non', 'issue', 'suppose', 'photography', 'location', 'are', 'fabulous', 'What', 'really', 'wonder', 'producers', 'even', 'read', 'Ms', 'Austin', 'book', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'letter', 'book', 'would', 'think', 'book', 'was', 'chosen', 'richness', 'movie', 'totally', 'depth', 'book', 'apart', 'first', 'place', 'book', 'woman', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'depression', 'drifter', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'like', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'book', 'called', 'Hidden', 'Places', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'wounded', 'broken', 'shells', 'loved', 'ones', 'lives', 'who', 'abuse', 'torment', 'devalue', 'reject', 'Aunt', 'Batty', 'so', 'been', 'onset', 'book', 'somewhat', 'recluse', 'nobody', 'really', 'aloving', 'eccentric', 'individual', 'hurts', 'past', 'own', 'life', 'full', 'full', 'totally', 'leave', 'out', 'diminsion', 'book', 'opinion', 'leave', 'out', 'what', 'apart', 'fine', 'book', 'movie', 'little', 'flat', 'lifeless']",Hidden Places

Lane,"[5, 6]","There is nothing objectionable in this movie so the whole family can enjoy watching it together, but after watching it through just once, I've got it basically memorized. The book may have more depth and emotion -- I don't know because I haven't read it, or anything else by Lynn Austin. The plot of this movie, at any rate, is so simple that a child could have come up with it. No offence to fans of the movie; I'm just the kind of person who doesn't get captivated by a movie unless there's a lot of sweep and drama. I didn't cry or sit on the edge of my seat, I just sat back and enjoyed. It's an OK movie, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it unless you've rented it first, and are sure you'd like to watch it again. The acting was mediocre, the whole story-line was very predictable, and the plot had some holes. For example: there is a part near the end where Eliza goes to Gabes room one morning and finds he is gone . . . just when they need him the most. Sure he won't be coming back, she is broken-hearted. The next morning he has come back with a band of hobos willing to pick a harvest of oranges in exchange for a filling breakfast, and Eliza is overjoyed that Gabe didn't walk out on her after all. But I already guessed he went for help of some kind. My question is: Why didn't he leave a note? Kindof weird. I know they meant for him disapearing to add suspense, but all it did for me was suspend my belief. So, three stars.
