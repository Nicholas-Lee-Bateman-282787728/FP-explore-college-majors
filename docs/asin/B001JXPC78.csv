This season presents a very good serial murder story but it doesn't do anything gound breaking yet. The serial murderer is very clever.  He has his wife cover for him, his girlfriend, his child, a retarded man and two brothers.  Our detectives are able to press his prosecution after he mistakenly leaves one victim alive. However with all the covering up by all of these other people it is an up hill battle. There is more courtroom aspect to this one than any of the others and some are going to find that a little tedious after awhile.  There is a dynamite resolution, however, so hang in there.",4,Male Creep as Sadistic Serial Killer,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,731,"['Season', 'Two', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'season', 'one', 'hold', 'show', 'just', 'hitting', 'stride', 'season', 'three', 'terrific', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'serial', 'murder', 'story', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'gound', 'breaking', 'yet', 'serial', 'murderer', 'very', 'clever', 'wife', 'cover', 'girlfriend', 'child', 'retarded', 'man', 'two', 'brothers', 'detectives', 'are', 'able', 'press', 'prosecution', 'mistakenly', 'one', 'victim', 'alive', 'However', 'covering', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'up', 'hill', 'battle', 'more', 'courtroom', 'aspect', 'one', 'others', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'little', 'tedious', 'awhile', 'dynamite', 'resolution', 'however', 'so', 'hang', 'there']",Trial and Retribution: Set 2
