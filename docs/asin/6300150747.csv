Now that I have waited, it looks like pt 2 and 3 are soon to be no longer avaliable on dvd... Does this mean that there will be a boxed set released with pt 1, 2, and 3 together? God I hope so.

Thankfully, it found new life on video and cable. Great character actor Terry 'O' Quinn, plays a psychotic madman who is determined to have the perfect, all american family. When that family disappoints him in some way, well, they pay with their lives. Then he's on to a new family and identity. He meets Shelly Hack, and her daughter, played by Jill Schoelen. The daughter knows that her new stepfather is not who he seems to be, and she sets out to prove herself right. 'O' Quinn is scary. His stepfather is just as creepy when he's nice as he is when he's stark raving mad. A teriffic, and underrated performance. The movie is not your typical horror/slasher film. It's more mature and intelligent. There is very little blood here, and that makes it a better film. The intelligence of this film was scarred by two horrible sequels that went down the typical 80's slasher road. Skip those and see this. One of the most underrated suspense/horror films.

197094,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6300150747,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[7, 8]","Nearly twenty years after its initial release, Joseph Ruben's The Stepfather remains one of the best horror films of the 1980s.  The Stepfather is based on the true story of Joseph List, a suburban accountant who was described as the ideal neighbor and was apparently just an all-around great guy as long as you didn't hold the weekend when he happened to brutally murder his entire family against him.  The movie's version of List is blandly friendly real estate agent, Jerry Blake.  As played by Terry O'Quinn, Jerry is a rather likeable sort -- the type of suburban dad who makes Ward Cleaver look like a degenerate.  He's the type of guy who rarely loses his temper in public, never says anything aloud that could be found offensive, and who is always ready to great the world with a smile.Unfortunately, Jerry has one, big problem.  He expects the rest of the world to be as perfect as he sees himself as being and when the world fails to live up to that ideal, he has a tendency to go on a killing rampage.  Presumably, that's why he kills his first family shortly before the film's opening credits.  The rest of the movie follows Jerry as he moved to yet another wholesome suburban street and romances single mom Shelly Hack.  Hack is charmed by the polite, responsible man who speaks so sincerely about how much he loves family.  Her rebellious teenage daughter (Jill Schoelen) is a little less charmed.  In fact, she knows something is off about Jerry from the beginning and, despite Jerry's best attempts to turn her life into an old Saturday Evening Post cover, she remains convinced that there's something not quite right about her stepdad.  The more she rebels, the closer Jerry comes to snapping once again.The Stepfather is often referred to as a slasher film and it does have many things in common with that much maligned genre -- Jerry is a remorseless, at times unstoppable killer and the main target of his wrath is a teenager.  However, what sets the Stepfather apart from the Friday the 13ths of the world is Terry O'Quinn.  As Jerry, O'Quinn creates one of cinema's most terrifying psychos and it is his performance that gives the film its haunting power.  O'Quinn wisely underplays Jerry's madness and, in scenes where he's not killing, actually makes this killer a sympathetic figure.  Indeed, the film's most terrifying moments come not when Jerry starts killing but instead during the scenes where a frustrated Jerry goes down to his pristine basement and starts muttering to himself about how nobody understands the sacrifices that he makes to keep everyone happy.  It is in these scenes that we see truly see the sociopathic monster lurking so closely under the surface of Blake's friendly smile and the scenes are all the more disturbing because many viewers will probably be reminded of times when they had similar thoughts.  Mention should also be made of Schoelen who doesn't play the heroine as a typical idealized horror film teen but instead reveals that her character, at times, can be a spoiled, sullen brat -- in other words, a typical teenager who isn't perfect but doesn't deserve to be murdered either.  Indeed, Jill Schoelen's character is probably the most believable and sympathetic horror film heroine since Jamie Lee Curtis in the original Halloween.The film is well directed by genre master Joseph Ruben who wisely emphasizes the blandness of his suburban setting and keeps the plot moving at a good pace.  The script, by novelist Donald Westlake (who, writing as Richard Stark, created Parker, another strangely sympathetic monster) is full of nicely quirky moments and avoids most horror film cliches.  Ignore the amazingly unworthy sequels and instead, watch the Stepfather and see just how brilliant the horror genre can be.",5,Still one of the best,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,3775,"['Nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'Stepfather', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', '1980s', 'Stepfather', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Joseph', 'List', 'suburban', 'accountant', 'who', 'was', 'described', 'ideal', 'neighbor', 'was', 'apparently', 'just', 'all-around', 'great', 'guy', 'as', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'weekend', 'when', 'happened', 'brutally', 'murder', 'entire', 'family', 'movie', 'version', 'List', 'blandly', 'friendly', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Jerry', 'Blake', 'played', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Jerry', 'rather', 'likeable', 'sort', 'type', 'suburban', 'dad', 'who', 'Ward', 'Cleaver', 'look', 'degenerate', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'rarely', 'temper', 'public', 'never', 'anything', 'aloud', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'offensive', 'who', 'always', 'ready', 'great', 'world', 'smile.Unfortunately', 'Jerry', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'rest', 'world', 'be', 'as', 'perfect', 'being', 'when', 'world', 'live', 'up', 'ideal', 'tendency', 'go', 'killing', 'rampage', 'Presumably', 'why', 'first', 'family', 'shortly', 'film', 'opening', 'credits', 'rest', 'movie', 'Jerry', 'moved', 'yet', 'wholesome', 'suburban', 'street', 'romances', 'single', 'mom', 'Shelly', 'Hack', 'Hack', 'charmed', 'polite', 'responsible', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'sincerely', 'how', 'much', 'family', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jill', 'Schoelen', 'little', 'less', 'charmed', 'fact', 'something', 'Jerry', 'beginning', 'Jerry', 'best', 'attempts', 'turn', 'life', 'old', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', 'cover', 'convinced', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'stepdad', 'more', 'closer', 'Jerry', 'snapping', 'once', 'again.The', 'Stepfather', 'often', 'referred', 'slasher', 'film', 'have', 'many', 'things', 'common', 'much', 'maligned', 'genre', 'Jerry', 'remorseless', 'times', 'unstoppable', 'killer', 'main', 'target', 'wrath', 'teenager', 'However', 'what', 'Stepfather', 'apart', 'Friday', '13ths', 'world', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Jerry', ""O'Quinn"", 'one', 'cinema', 'most', 'terrifying', 'psychos', 'performance', 'film', 'haunting', 'power', ""O'Quinn"", 'wisely', 'Jerry', 'madness', 'scenes', 'where', 'not', 'killing', 'actually', 'killer', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'Indeed', 'film', 'most', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'come', 'not', 'when', 'Jerry', 'killing', 'instead', 'scenes', 'where', 'frustrated', 'Jerry', 'down', 'pristine', 'basement', 'muttering', 'how', 'nobody', 'sacrifices', 'keep', 'everyone', 'happy', 'scenes', 'see', 'truly', 'see', 'sociopathic', 'monster', 'lurking', 'so', 'closely', 'surface', 'Blake', 'friendly', 'smile', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'disturbing', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'reminded', 'times', 'when', 'had', 'similar', 'thoughts', 'Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Schoelen', 'who', ""n't"", 'play', 'heroine', 'typical', 'idealized', 'horror', 'film', 'teen', 'instead', 'reveals', 'character', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'spoiled', 'sullen', 'brat', 'other', 'words', 'typical', 'teenager', 'who', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'murdered', 'Indeed', 'Jill', 'Schoelen', 'character', 'probably', 'most', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'horror', 'film', 'heroine', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'original', 'Halloween.The', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'genre', 'master', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'who', 'wisely', 'blandness', 'suburban', 'setting', 'plot', 'moving', 'good', 'pace', 'script', 'novelist', 'Donald', 'Westlake', 'who', 'writing', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'created', 'Parker', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'monster', 'full', 'nicely', 'quirky', 'moments', 'avoids', 'most', 'horror', 'film', 'cliches', 'amazingly', 'unworthy', 'sequels', 'instead', 'watch', 'Stepfather', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'brilliant', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'be']",N/A

197100,A3IMNZSYDOTTU6,6300150747,"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[0, 0]","Did you ever wonder what would happen if you had a new member of the family who was a ""perfectionist"" in a psychotic sense? Did you ever wonder if there was a violent rage lurking quietly underneath the surreal charm and caring sensibility? Well, THE STEPFATHER is one of the those films that answers all those questions...and then some. If you've ever had some doubts about why you think there's something wrong with mom's new man, well this movie will give you some answers.THE STEPFATHER centers around a calm, quiet man who, in a fit of rage, has murdered off his first family. When you first meet him, he's got some blood on his clothing and face, but you're not sure what's happened. He cleans up, shaves, cuts his hair, dresses up in a classy outfit, and puts in his contacts and sheds the glasses. After he leaves the bathroom and tidies things up a bit, he heads downstairs and...we see a murdered family. Could this be his dirty work? Oh yes, and he did it because they let him down, and they were not the family he envisioned and dreamed of having in his lifetime. With a cool calm, he leaves the house and swipes the paper and heads off to leave and move onto life somewhere else. He dumps the briefcase with all the evidence and leaves behind his former life.Pick up a year later with new family...daughter Jill and wife Susan, both of whom are now a part of that man's life. His new identity is Jerry Blake, the American Eagle Realty owner, loving husband, and caring father. Life seems to be going good for Jerry, but his new step-daughter has some doubts about him. She suspects there's something not right about him, and of course doesn't like him at first. She is going to therapy after her real father's death, and she talks about Jerry as if he were an evil existing in life. But the therapist is trying to convince her to give Jerry a chance. Jerry tries everything to win her over: gets her a cute little dog; helps her get back in school; foils her plan to find out who the family killer is (ha! did you think he'd let her see his picture...no way).Now we know when Jerry gets stressed, he likes to go down to the basement and build birdhouses. He's a craftsman, and the first time we see him there he actually manipulates us into liking him, believing he really wants the best for this family. However, someone from the past is trying to track him down and put an end to his reign. At first the authorities don't want to help, but then reluctantly they team up to help track down Jerry Blake (although they don't know it's him). After Jill's therapist tries to get in touch with Jerry, he ends up at a house showing where Jerry finds out some about him and ends up killing him. Jerry's outbursts can be chilling, especially the first time we see him go ballistic in the basement with Jill watching...very intense. Things start to go downhill after Jerry decides his new family just isn't working out and starts to set up a new life. When he returns home, a confrontation between him and Susan erupts, and then the violence begins. Poor Jill, upstairs naked in the shower, has no idea that all her instincts were dead on about her new stepfather. Mayhem ensues after he kills off the guy looking for him, and then tries to dispose of Susan and Jill and fails. The film's ending was quiet, and the toppling of the birdhouse reminds us that there was once a respect for Jerry but now that's all but gone.The perfomances in the movies, for the most part, are actually good for a film of this caliber. Shelly Hack is passable as Susan; Jill Schoelen is actually good as Stephanie, the stepdaughter who's got every suspicion her new father figure isn't so grand; but it's Terry O'Quinn who steals the movie as the diabolical Stepfather. He has the charisma and the conviction that carries the role he fills in perfectly. Every time Jerry is disappointed, you feel it. Every time he tries to make good with the family, you admire him. But deep down, you know he's not a good guy. He may take care of business, but that doesn't mean he's not evil.

Westlake.And an absolutely mesmerizing performance from Terry O'Quinn, who invests his character with enough repressed fury to make most screen psychos look like Mr Rogers.The film starts out with a real sense of style as O'Quinn washes his bloody hands in a bathroom sink then proceeds to alter his appearance drastically before walking downstairs to his murdered family; its a startling and creepy beginning and the rest of the film is as stylish and well done. I think its biggest strength is the well-developed psychopathology of Terry O'Quinn's character;his behavior actually makes sense in terms of his madness; this is a refreshing change of pace from most films of this type, where the killers have zero motivation and are just plot-devices.",5,Terry O'Quinn makes his mark,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,891,"['one', 'best', 'thrillers', 'emerge', '1980', 'got', 'assured', 'direction', 'Joseph', 'Reuben', 'excellent', 'script', 'Donald', 'E.', 'Westlake.And', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'who', 'character', 'enough', 'repressed', 'fury', 'make', 'most', 'screen', 'psychos', 'look', 'Mr', 'Rogers.The', 'film', 'out', 'real', 'sense', 'style', ""O'Quinn"", 'bloody', 'bathroom', 'sink', 'then', 'alter', 'appearance', 'drastically', 'walking', 'downstairs', 'murdered', 'family', 'startling', 'creepy', 'beginning', 'rest', 'film', 'stylish', 'well', 'done', 'think', 'biggest', 'strength', 'well-developed', 'psychopathology', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'character', 'behavior', 'actually', 'sense', 'terms', 'madness', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'most', 'films', 'type', 'where', 'killers', 'have', 'zero', 'motivation', 'are', 'just', 'plot-devices']",N/A

The late 80's/early 90's gave us a whole series of what I call ""the ____ from hell"" type of movie.  Fatal Attraction gave us the affair from hell, Pacific Heights gave us the tenant from hell, and The Hand that Rocked the Cradle gave us the nanny from hell.  As the title suggests, ""Stepfather"" was the stepfather from hell starring Terry O' Quinn, one of my favorite character actors.Quinn is Jerry Blake...or maybe he isn't.  Blake is a homicidal maniac looking for the perfect family in the perfect neighborhood.  all he wants is the 1950's style Americana life with a nice white picket fence, a family that has dinner together and plays together.  He marries Susan (Shelly Hack) who has a teenage daughter Stephanie (Jill Schoelen).  Stephanie begins to suspect something isn't quite right about Jerry and begins checking him out.  This infuriates Jerry who finds her rebellious leading to numerous run-ins.  Jerry then takes on another alias and begins scouting for a new family.  Meanwhile a member of the last family that Jerry killed is on his trail looking to kill him before Jerry can kill another family.Terry O' Quinn is fantastic in his role moving from a Mr. Brady/Father Knows Best dad to a raging maniac at the drop of a hat.  When everything goes well, Jerry is the loving father and husband everyone would want, but when things don't live up to his expectations...well...Look out!  A very underrated slasher that is as much psychological horror as it is slasher film.  Hopefully this will be on DVD soon.
