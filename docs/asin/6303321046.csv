369191,ASLVBGA9Z1Y63,6303321046,"Janice Harrison ""Janice""","[5, 7]","Although this video was shot some time ago, by the famed photographer Mary Ellen Mark, the conditions are as applicable now as they were back when it was made some years ago.  This video ""Streetwise"" portays the life of several street kids in Seattle: ""Tiny"", the prostitute, who can't be any more than about 13 or 14; ""Rat"" who goes dumpster-diving for food; and Roberta Josephine (Bobbie Jo) who was eventually strangled to death by Gary Ridgway, the ""Green River Killer"", active in Seattle at that time and responsible for the deaths of many runaways in the Seattle area.The conditions under which these kids live and survive is appalling. ""Rat"" lives in an abandoned hotel, the windows boarded up, sleeping on an old mattress on the floor.  It's chilling to think of a kid being there, though he is with an older friend. You have to wonder how terrifying their home lives must have been to make them flee like that and end up on the streets with nowhere to go, and nobody to turn to. One boy hanged himself because he couldn't stand his life anymore.The parents of these kids are nowhere to be seen; if they are, they are completely apathetic and uninvolved in their kids' lives; their boyfriends are far more important.  This goes on as I write this; today, many kids live on the streets just as they did when this video was made.  Yet nothing is being done about it.  This video is well worth viewing; it provides an eye-opening look at the lives of these children, seen as ""throwaways"". In an age when everyone is baby-crazy, and going to any length whatsoever to have a child, it makes me wonder why some of these people don't take in foster kids and help them.  I highly recommend this video. I'm a former college professor and I showed it to a graduate class of mine three years ago; they could not stop talking about it!",5,"Heartbreaking, eye-opening view of streetlife for runaway kids",1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,1831,"['video', 'was', 'shot', 'time', 'ago', 'famed', 'photographer', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Mark', 'conditions', 'are', 'applicable', 'now', 'were', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'ago', 'video', 'Streetwise', 'life', 'several', 'street', 'kids', 'Seattle', 'Tiny', 'prostitute', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'about', '13', '14', 'Rat', 'who', 'dumpster-diving', 'food', 'Roberta', 'Josephine', 'Bobbie', 'Jo', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'strangled', 'death', 'Gary', 'Ridgway', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'active', 'Seattle', 'time', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'many', 'runaways', 'Seattle', 'area.The', 'conditions', 'kids', 'live', 'survive', 'appalling', 'Rat', 'abandoned', 'hotel', 'windows', 'boarded', 'up', 'sleeping', 'old', 'mattress', 'floor', 'chilling', 'think', 'kid', 'being', 'there', 'older', 'friend', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'terrifying', 'home', 'lives', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'flee', 'end', 'up', 'streets', 'nowhere', 'go', 'nobody', 'turn', 'One', 'boy', 'hanged', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'life', 'parents', 'kids', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'are', 'completely', 'apathetic', 'uninvolved', 'kids', 'lives', 'boyfriends', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'write', 'today', 'many', 'kids', 'live', 'streets', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'video', 'was', 'made', 'nothing', 'being', 'done', 'video', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'eye-opening', 'look', 'lives', 'children', 'seen', 'throwaways', 'age', 'when', 'everyone', 'baby-crazy', 'going', 'length', 'whatsoever', 'have', 'child', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'foster', 'kids', 'help', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', ""'m"", 'former', 'college', 'professor', 'showed', 'graduate', 'class', 'mine', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'talking']",Streetwise VHS

Gordon,"[1, 1]","The filmmakers spending months with runaway teens on the streets ofSeattle, to gain their trust and allow them to be filmed.There is something oddly 'stagy' about some of the behavior. The kidsare clearly aware of the camera. Yet, as one writer pointed out, that'salso part of the power of the film, since adolescence has so muchposturing and acting out anyway.The film tries to stay un-judgemental and avoids commentating in obviousways, sometimes at the expense of seeming disconnected or uncomfortablevoyeuristic.Yet there are moments of tremendous power here, both in seeing thesekids cling to what bits of joy they can find, and to each other, and inseeing the grim realities of both their street and home lives, inhard-to-believe detail.

369193,A2PSW98I67L4CU,6303321046,"Lavenderbyrd ""lavenderbyrd""","[9, 12]","I originally saw this movie when it was released and shown at ""arthouse"" theatres, back in the day, and never forgot it.  Recently, I obtained a used copy off e*B*a*y, and have watched it several times.  THIS is what the film ""Times Square"" tried to capture.  THIS is what every sick hollywood director succumbing to ""directing"" scripted so-called ""reality shows"" only wish they could recreate.  This is true reality and it still goes on today- look around you: there will always be throw-away kids.  America doesn't really give a damn about the poor.  Ask President Bush. He'll tell you-  give them soup for breakfast and it'll all be fine.  What a shame.  I, like a another reviewer wondered, where are those kids today? Did any make it alive to see their adulthood?  The only one I ever heard an update on was Tiny.  Nightline did an update on her life/situation (about 1992-93?), and as you may have guessed.... she was interviewed living in a sleazy motel room with a baby... fighting with some loser she desperately wanted to keep as her man.  Kinda figured that, huh?  I recommend you get this on video until it is released on dvd, if ever.  And while you're searching for it, get your hands on the video trilogy ""The Decline Of Western Civilization (1981), ""The Decline Of Western Civilization II (1988): L.A. Metal Scene"", and ""The Decline Of Western Civilization III (1999): The Hollywood Homeless"".

369196,A1IEGPT1Q5D3R2,6303321046,T.G.,"[5, 7]","For those who suspect this film was ""scripted"" (not surprising in the current age of irony and cynicism) -- drop by Mary Ellen Mark's website (Photographs, do a web search) and click on Books, then ""Streetwise,"" then read the preface and postscript, which reveals quite a bit more about the film.  Then think to yourself -- do you know any *professional* adolescent actors talented enough to pull off a scripted version of Streetwise?It should dawn on you then, that Streetwise is one of a kind.  There may have been some hamming in front of the camera, but I'm fairly certain none of this was scripted.  I'm not sure what it was competing against that year at the Academy Awards, but imagine if it had won... the film would certainly still be in print (probably restored and out on DVD), and the next generation would have the opportunity to see this important work of art... also, Martin Bell would probably have gotten more work as befits his incredible talents.  As it stands, I figure this just may have been too painful to watch for Academy voters... or I wonder if they thought it was scripted too.Anyway, this film is a ""must-see"" even if you have to buy an expensive, used copy.  Of course I may be somewhat biased... I live in and grew up in (near) Seattle, and have met the director (I was living nearby where ""American Heart"" was filmed).
