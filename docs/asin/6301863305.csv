Richard is a serial killer who calls his victims and leaves a message on their answering machine before he kills them. One day their paths cross...The story flows quite naturally as does the dialogue. And the acting is good all over. Still, it never really gets engaging (nor scary).

Really, Lisa should have died in the end, but the improbable, predictable ending forbade it. For most of the film, it was good, and it had a healthy pace. Then, the ending pretty much killed it all, putting my perspective in place and describing Lisa as a stupid, spoiled brat.

Moffett as the candle light killer/ Richard. Again it's very tame in comparison to what I usually watch and review but I have a soft spot for it because it's in the vein of most of the early 90's thrillers.the climatic third act is action packed and has a big fight for survival as a mother a child fight to save each others lives.",4,Always use your Telephone responsibly,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,929,"['great', 'thriller', '1990', 'remember', 'renting', 'VHS', 'lot', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining.It', 'only', 'had', 'maybe', 'drop', 'two', 'blood', 'still', 'two', 'boy', 'crazy', 'teenage', 'girls', 'prank', 'call', ""'Candlelight"", 'killer', 'accident', 'become', 'infatuated', 'not', 'realizing', 'are', 'putting', 'everyone', 'love', 'including', 'danger.Lisa', 'played', ""'Staci"", 'Keanan', 'pretends', 'be', 'mom', 'Ladd', 'talking', 'Richard/The', 'Candle', 'light', 'killer', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'sticky', 'dangerous', 'interesting.it', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'starring', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'Staci', 'Keanan', 'D.W.', 'Moffett', 'candle', 'light', 'killer/', 'Richard', 'Again', 'very', 'tame', 'comparison', 'what', 'usually', 'watch', 'review', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'vein', 'most', 'early', '90', 'thrillers.the', 'climatic', 'third', 'act', 'action', 'packed', 'big', 'fight', 'survival', 'mother', 'child', 'fight', 'save', 'others']",N/A
