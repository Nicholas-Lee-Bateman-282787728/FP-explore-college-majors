1539295,A3FTZOZQR02L62,B007WB5DK2,Carl Sharpe,"[0, 3]","It looked like a recording session laying down rough cuts to be sweetened later. For example, no harmony vocals, no audience, the band while quite skilled looked bored. I did know Albert was no front man, but that's all the more reason to have the extras.Best part for me was the bonus material which provided Albert's progression over the years. I'm sorry to say I would not recommend especially at the price.Carl Sharpe",3,Not his best presentation.,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,421,"['looked', 'recording', 'session', 'laying', 'down', 'rough', 'cuts', 'be', 'sweetened', 'later', 'example', 'harmony', 'vocals', 'audience', 'band', 'quite', 'skilled', 'looked', 'bored', 'did', 'know', 'Albert', 'was', 'front', 'man', 'more', 'reason', 'have', 'extras.Best', 'part', 'was', 'bonus', 'material', 'provided', 'Albert', 'progression', 'years', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'especially', 'price.Carl', 'Sharpe']",Albert Lee: Tearing It Up

The Audio and Video are superlative, and compliment the artistry of Albert Lee perfectly. The feature I really found helpful, is the ability to change the audio tracks on the fly without interrupting the song. Simply hit the menu button while the song is playing, and a small menu appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Choose audio setup, and the audio choices are displayed while the song continues to play. Make your choice, and the disc switches to that mode without interrupting the song. This is a great feature when you are trying to compare how the different audio tracks sound in your particular media room.",5,This Blu-Ray does justice to Albert Lee,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,681,"['have', 'little', 'add', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'here', 'Audio', 'Video', 'are', 'superlative', 'compliment', 'artistry', 'Albert', 'Lee', 'perfectly', 'feature', 'really', 'found', 'helpful', 'ability', 'change', 'audio', 'tracks', 'fly', 'interrupting', 'song', 'Simply', 'hit', 'menu', 'button', 'song', 'playing', 'small', 'menu', 'lower', 'right', 'hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'Choose', 'audio', 'setup', 'audio', 'choices', 'are', 'displayed', 'song', 'play', 'Make', 'choice', 'disc', 'mode', 'interrupting', 'song', 'great', 'feature', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'compare', 'how', 'different', 'audio', 'tracks', 'sound', 'particular', 'media', 'room']",Albert Lee: Tearing It Up

1539299,A81P47EIXM8HA,B007WB5DK2,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[3, 4]","I love this artist, and this company ,AIX, makes quality products. The bonus interview is nice but the show itself isn't as long as I'd hoped for but my biggest gripe is that they have a peddle steel guitarist sharing licks and sonic space with Albert and I blame the producer for that. I bought this hoping to hear Alberts' insane guitar playing, not his sidemen. For me this comes off more like a producer in love with getting all the other instruments in the action rather than a producer who realizes that Albert and his guitar should be the big issue and the other instruments and players are support. It IS Alberts' face on the cover and this isn't a cheap product by any means. I'd expect a longer show and more Albert to give this more than an average review...sadly.",3,Albert Lee : SHARING it up ... should be the title.,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,775,"['love', 'artist', 'company', 'AIX', 'quality', 'products', 'bonus', 'interview', 'nice', 'show', ""n't"", 'as', 'long', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'have', 'peddle', 'steel', 'guitarist', 'sharing', 'licks', 'sonic', 'space', 'Albert', 'blame', 'producer', 'bought', 'hoping', 'hear', 'Alberts', 'insane', 'guitar', 'playing', 'not', 'sidemen', 'off', 'more', 'producer', 'love', 'getting', 'other', 'instruments', 'action', 'rather', 'producer', 'who', 'Albert', 'guitar', 'should', 'be', 'big', 'issue', 'other', 'instruments', 'players', 'are', 'support', 'Alberts', 'face', 'cover', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'product', 'means', ""'d"", 'expect', 'longer', 'show', 'more', 'Albert', 'give', 'more', 'average', 'review', 'sadly']",Albert Lee: Tearing It Up
1539300,A6MSIL4MSA08G,B007WB5DK2,Stephen,"[0, 0]",This is more of a studio type thing than a live performance with an audience like I had expected. Love Albert Lee and he is one of my guitar heroes.

1539301,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B007WB5DK2,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[7, 8]","About 10 years ago I reviewed a DVD from Producer Mark Waldrep's AIX record label, featuring string-wizard John McEuen. It featured HD sound and HD video, as well as a feature that let you choose the camera angle. (All this was before the advent of Bluray.)This new BD from AIX  - though a 2012 release - was recorded in 2006 at the Colburn School for Performing Arts in Los Angeles (Lee lives in Malibu when not on the road).Lee is what I call the Zelig of the Americana music world. Though born and raised in the UK (he's a contemporary of  Beatles, Stones,  Yardbirds (he replaced Jimmy Page in a band when Page joined the Yardbirds), his heart was always in skiffle music in the UK and Country in the US. He came to the US as part of the band Head Hands and Feet who had a top US hit with ""Country Boy"" and 1971 and decided to stay. From there he began playing guitar and touring with Eric Clapton (5 years) and the Everly Brothers (20 years). He was also part of Emmy Lou Harris's band. While he had a couple of solo albums, he was more at ease as part of a backup group. But this guy can play and loves guitars.I had the chance to see Lee in Memphis a few Years ago at the International Folk Alliance and his set blew me away. When I got this DVD I felt the same way. He leads his touring band and does the vocals for 58 minutes covering 14 songs by John Hiatt, Rodney Crowell, Johnny Burnette, Fats Domino, and TWO by Felice and Boudreau Bryant (who penned most of the Everly Brothers hits). The band also play the Lee co-write ""Country Boy"". The sound and the camera work is great and, even thought it's in HD, the image looked great on my 30 year old standard def television.The DVD comes with some nice bonues. First there is a 35-minute interview (well, you don't hear the questions; just Lee's answers)  with the very personable Lee about his career. The producer cleverly inserts archival  still photos - and even video clips! - at appropriuate points in the interview. There are two other ""interview"" sections - recorded at the same time. In the first (7 minutes) Lee discusses how he learned to play the guitar and demonstrates it with his favorite model. In the last clip (4 minutes) he discusses his favorite guitars over the years.There are text bios of the band members an a screen of liner notes.The package incluses a 12 page booklet with the lyrics to all the songs performed.Lee is often confused in name with another guitarist, Alvin Lee, from the band Ten Years after, but, while both play guitar, they are far different players. For my money, Albert wins hands down.I know that producer Waldep added lots of tekkie bells and whistles to this DVD but most are beyond my sonic grasp. I do know that I loved watching this and found the performance (as well as the lengthy interview) highly entertaining.I  hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Great guitar work and vocals from Lee meet HD sound and video on this rockin' and rollin' DVD,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,2918,"['10', 'years', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'Producer', 'Mark', 'Waldrep', 'AIX', 'record', 'label', 'featuring', 'string-wizard', 'John', 'McEuen', 'featured', 'HD', 'sound', 'HD', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'feature', 'let', 'choose', 'camera', 'angle', 'was', 'advent', 'Bluray', 'new', 'BD', 'AIX', '2012', 'release', 'was', 'recorded', '2006', 'Colburn', 'School', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Lee', 'Malibu', 'when', 'not', 'road', '.Lee', 'what', 'call', 'Zelig', 'Americana', 'music', 'world', 'born', 'raised', 'UK', 'contemporary', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'Yardbirds', 'replaced', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'band', 'when', 'Page', 'joined', 'Yardbirds', 'heart', 'was', 'always', 'skiffle', 'music', 'UK', 'Country', 'US', 'came', 'US', 'part', 'band', 'Head', 'Hands', 'Feet', 'who', 'had', 'top', 'US', 'hit', 'Country', 'Boy', '1971', 'decided', 'stay', 'began', 'playing', 'guitar', 'touring', 'Eric', 'Clapton', '5', 'years', 'Everly', 'Brothers', '20', 'years', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'Emmy', 'Lou', 'Harris', 'band', 'had', 'couple', 'solo', 'albums', 'was', 'more', 'ease', 'part', 'backup', 'group', 'guy', 'can', 'play', 'guitars.I', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Lee', 'Memphis', 'few', 'Years', 'ago', 'International', 'Folk', 'Alliance', 'set', 'blew', 'away', 'When', 'got', 'DVD', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'touring', 'band', 'vocals', '58', 'minutes', 'covering', '14', 'songs', 'John', 'Hiatt', 'Rodney', 'Crowell', 'Johnny', 'Burnette', 'Fats', 'Domino', 'TWO', 'Felice', 'Boudreau', 'Bryant', 'who', 'penned', 'most', 'Everly', 'Brothers', 'hits', 'band', 'also', 'play', 'Lee', 'co-write', 'Country', 'Boy', 'sound', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'even', 'thought', 'HD', 'image', 'looked', 'great', '30', 'year', 'old', 'standard', 'television.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'bonues', 'First', '35-minute', 'interview', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'questions', 'just', 'Lee', 'answers', 'very', 'personable', 'Lee', 'career', 'producer', 'cleverly', 'archival', 'still', 'even', 'video', 'clips', 'appropriuate', 'points', 'interview', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'interview', 'sections', 'recorded', 'same', 'time', 'first', '7', 'minutes', 'Lee', 'how', 'learned', 'play', 'guitar', 'favorite', 'model', 'last', 'clip', '4', 'minutes', 'favorite', 'guitars', 'are', 'text', 'bios', 'band', 'members', 'screen', 'liner', 'notes.The', 'package', '12', 'page', 'booklet', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'performed.Lee', 'often', 'confused', 'name', 'guitarist', 'Alvin', 'Lee', 'band', 'Ten', 'Years', 'play', 'guitar', 'are', 'far', 'different', 'players', 'money', 'Albert', 'hands', 'down.I', 'know', 'producer', 'Waldep', 'added', 'lots', 'tekkie', 'bells', 'whistles', 'DVD', 'most', 'are', 'sonic', 'grasp', 'do', 'know', 'loved', 'watching', 'found', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'highly', 'entertaining.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Albert Lee: Tearing It Up
