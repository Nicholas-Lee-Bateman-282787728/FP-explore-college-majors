738175,A3B249FQ2OJBCQ,B00008DDG1,"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy""","[0, 0]","Volume 2 covers episodes 6-10 of ""Ai Yori Aoshi"".  First, Taeko-san, Kaoru's fellow photo club member, has been fired from her live-in housekeeper job and comes to the mansion in search of aid. Can the group convice Miyabi-san to hire her? Then Aoi-chan joins Kaoru's photo club for an outing to an onsen and an evening of fun.  Next, Tina buys a ferret but can she convince Miyabi-san to let her keep it?  Then when Aoi-chan and Miyabi-san have to leave for a day, Kaoru, Tina, and Taeko-chan are left at the mansion.  However, when Taeko-chan ends up taking off for a photo shoot, will Tina and Kaoru survive the night alone? Finally, Aoi-chan wants to learn more about Kaoru, so she takes some taiyaki to his college for them to share.The stories are fun, but still full of fanservice.  Tina loves to grab women's breast and the animators show this frequently.  The romance between Aoi and Kaoru isn't as much of a focus in this volume, but two of the episodes allow Aoi to get to know Kaoru better.As for the DVD, ""Ai Yori Aoshi"" may be the best-done title in the Pioneer/Geneon stable.  As before, the Japanese honorifics are left in the subtitles and some are even in the dub.  The only odd thing was that Tina's use of ""chii"" or ""chin"" after a name (ie: Tae-chii) was dropped from the subtitles.  The two other male members of the photo club usually refer to Taeko as ""Minazuki-kun"", but this was dropped everytime save one.  Still, these are minor complaints though.Bottom line: If you enjoyed volume 1 and can get passed the fanservice, you'll enjoy volume 2.",4,Enter Taeko!,1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,1568,"['Volume', '2', 'covers', 'episodes', '6-10', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'First', 'Taeko-san', 'Kaoru', 'fellow', 'photo', 'club', 'member', 'been', 'fired', 'live-in', 'housekeeper', 'job', 'mansion', 'search', 'aid', 'Can', 'group', 'Miyabi-san', 'hire', 'Then', 'Aoi-chan', 'Kaoru', 'photo', 'club', 'outing', 'onsen', 'evening', 'fun', 'Next', 'Tina', 'ferret', 'can', 'convince', 'Miyabi-san', 'let', 'keep', 'Then', 'when', 'Aoi-chan', 'Miyabi-san', 'have', 'leave', 'day', 'Kaoru', 'Tina', 'Taeko-chan', 'are', 'left', 'mansion', 'However', 'when', 'Taeko-chan', 'up', 'taking', 'off', 'photo', 'shoot', 'will', 'Tina', 'Kaoru', 'survive', 'night', 'alone', 'Finally', 'Aoi-chan', 'learn', 'more', 'Kaoru', 'taiyaki', 'college', 'share.The', 'stories', 'are', 'fun', 'still', 'full', 'fanservice', 'Tina', 'grab', 'women', 'breast', 'animators', 'show', 'frequently', 'romance', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'focus', 'volume', 'two', 'episodes', 'allow', 'Aoi', 'get', 'know', 'Kaoru', 'better.As', 'DVD', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'may', 'be', 'best-done', 'title', 'Pioneer/Geneon', 'stable', 'before', 'Japanese', 'honorifics', 'are', 'left', 'subtitles', 'are', 'even', 'dub', 'only', 'odd', 'thing', 'was', 'Tina', 'use', 'chii', 'chin', 'name', 'ie', 'Tae-chii', 'was', 'dropped', 'subtitles', 'two', 'other', 'male', 'members', 'photo', 'club', 'usually', 'refer', 'Taeko', 'Minazuki-kun', 'was', 'dropped', 'everytime', 'save', 'one', 'Still', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'though.Bottom', 'line', 'enjoyed', 'volume', '1', 'can', 'get', 'passed', 'fanservice', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'volume', '2']",N/A

738178,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00008DDG1,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 1]","The second volume of the Ai Yori Aoshi anime corresponds roughly with most of the second manga, but without the story of the photo club having a traditional tea house for the college fest-that's put off until the fourth DVD!  And only a few stories from the third manga are incorporated here.  Story so far:  Kaoru and Tina are tenants in a Western-style mansion, with lovely Aoi Sakuraba as the landlord and strict Miyabi-san as manager.  Kaoru and Aoi must keep their engagement and relationship secret to avoid a scandal.Taeko joins the group proper when after being fired as a live-in housekeeper, finds herself without a job or place to live.  Kaoru and Tina want to help, and Aoi wants to hire her.  However, her clumsiness sorely tests the patience of Miyabi-san.  Aoi though sees that Taeko tries very hard, and because of her clumsiness, she has to give it her all just to give average results.  Taeko also has no sense of direction, as seen when the photo club members and Aoi go on a hot springs trip, and tops herself by accidentally booking everyone for reservations for the next year.  What to do?  Tina, Suzuki, and Sato are clearly the party animals, as they pig out on food to the bewilderment of the more modest Kaoru and Aoi.  In one scene, Tina is putting away both sake and beer, so that before long, a wall of bottles appear in front of her.  The difference is that in the manga, Taeko is employed AFTER the hot springs trip and not before per here.""A beautiful atmosphere is needed for inner peace,"" says Miyabi as she polishes the grandfather clock.  However, when Tina brings home a cute and cuddly ferret, Miyabi-san gets anything but inner peace, as the animal is a bit mischievous.  When the ferret steals Miyabi's fountain pen, Miyabi loses her temper and chases the animal around.  An exterior shot of the mansion is overlaid with sounds of crashing and screaming, including ""it's [whizzing] over here!""  A devastating scene of destruction is then seen.  In the manga, Miyabi's freaking out over the ferret having a bug and the naming of the ferret was in the special episode in Volume 5.  They have combined elements of the ferret's introduction in manga vol. 3 and naming in the same story here.  But despite her apparent strictness, Miyabi-san does have her soft side.Aoi and Miyabi then leave for a memorial service, while Taeko plays train conductor for a photo shoot for Suzuki and Sato, leaving Kaoru and Tina alone in the mansion.  Here, we see how Tina has a crush on Kaoru, but is unable to express herself.  However, she fills us in on how Kaoru was before meeting Aoi and shows a keen admiration for Aoi.  From her POV, Kaoru looked rather lonely, not wanting to let anyone inside his heart, and that was why Tina invited him to join the photo club.  ""The landlord and manager put your heart at ease.  They don't look at me funny `cause I'm American, and when I'm in trouble, they actually worry about me.  It's just like a real family.  Miss Landlady's really nice and can do any household chore.  That's you'd call a traditional Japanese beauty.  I wanted to be born Japanese just like Miss Landlady.  If I had been...""Aoi is interested in Kaoru's fun stories of his time at college, and impulsively gets the opportunity to visit Meiritsu College, just to share some taiyaki with him, the reason being that the mythically delicious taiyaki is from a shop that shows up in random places.  However, her traditional clothing draws stares from the more modern-dressed students, who think she's an actress or model, causing the poor girl bewilderment.  There's a cute scene when she flops down on Kaoru's bedding.  She grows a pair of cat ears and wagging tail!With the addition of Taeko and Uzume the ferret, the tableau is missing two more characters, one of whom debuts on the next disc.  However, the lineup so far is, just as Tina mentioned, just like a real family.",5,"Aoi Sakuraba and friends, just like a real family",1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,3910,"['second', 'volume', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'anime', 'roughly', 'most', 'second', 'manga', 'story', 'photo', 'club', 'having', 'traditional', 'tea', 'house', 'college', 'fest-that', 'put', 'off', 'fourth', 'DVD', 'only', 'few', 'stories', 'third', 'manga', 'are', 'incorporated', 'here', 'Story', 'so', 'far', 'Kaoru', 'Tina', 'are', 'tenants', 'Western-style', 'mansion', 'lovely', 'Aoi', 'Sakuraba', 'landlord', 'strict', 'Miyabi-san', 'manager', 'Kaoru', 'Aoi', 'must', 'keep', 'engagement', 'relationship', 'secret', 'avoid', 'scandal.Taeko', 'group', 'proper', 'when', 'being', 'fired', 'live-in', 'housekeeper', 'job', 'place', 'live', 'Kaoru', 'Tina', 'want', 'help', 'Aoi', 'hire', 'However', 'clumsiness', 'sorely', 'patience', 'Miyabi-san', 'Aoi', 'sees', 'Taeko', 'very', 'hard', 'clumsiness', 'give', 'just', 'give', 'average', 'results', 'Taeko', 'also', 'sense', 'direction', 'seen', 'when', 'photo', 'club', 'members', 'Aoi', 'go', 'hot', 'springs', 'trip', 'tops', 'accidentally', 'booking', 'everyone', 'reservations', 'next', 'year', 'What', 'do', 'Tina', 'Suzuki', 'Sato', 'are', 'clearly', 'party', 'animals', 'pig', 'out', 'food', 'bewilderment', 'more', 'modest', 'Kaoru', 'Aoi', 'one', 'scene', 'Tina', 'putting', 'away', 'sake', 'beer', 'long', 'wall', 'bottles', 'appear', 'front', 'difference', 'manga', 'Taeko', 'employed', 'hot', 'springs', 'trip', 'not', 'here', 'beautiful', 'atmosphere', 'needed', 'inner', 'peace', 'Miyabi', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'However', 'when', 'Tina', 'home', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'ferret', 'Miyabi-san', 'anything', 'inner', 'peace', 'animal', 'bit', 'mischievous', 'When', 'ferret', 'steals', 'Miyabi', 'fountain', 'pen', 'Miyabi', 'temper', 'animal', 'around', 'exterior', 'shot', 'mansion', 'overlaid', 'sounds', 'crashing', 'screaming', 'including', '[', 'whizzing', ']', 'here', 'devastating', 'scene', 'destruction', 'then', 'seen', 'manga', 'Miyabi', 'freaking', 'out', 'ferret', 'having', 'bug', 'naming', 'ferret', 'was', 'special', 'episode', 'Volume', '5', 'have', 'combined', 'elements', 'ferret', 'introduction', 'manga', 'vol', '3', 'naming', 'same', 'story', 'here', 'apparent', 'strictness', 'Miyabi-san', 'have', 'soft', 'side.Aoi', 'Miyabi', 'then', 'leave', 'memorial', 'service', 'Taeko', 'train', 'conductor', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Suzuki', 'Sato', 'leaving', 'Kaoru', 'Tina', 'alone', 'mansion', 'Here', 'see', 'how', 'Tina', 'crush', 'Kaoru', 'unable', 'express', 'However', 'how', 'Kaoru', 'was', 'meeting', 'Aoi', 'keen', 'admiration', 'Aoi', 'POV', 'Kaoru', 'looked', 'rather', 'lonely', 'not', 'wanting', 'let', 'anyone', 'heart', 'was', 'why', 'Tina', 'invited', 'join', 'photo', 'club', 'landlord', 'manager', 'put', 'heart', 'ease', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'funny', 'cause', ""'m"", 'American', 'when', ""'m"", 'trouble', 'actually', 'worry', 'just', 'real', 'family', 'Miss', 'Landlady', 'really', 'nice', 'can', 'do', 'household', 'chore', ""'d"", 'call', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'beauty', 'wanted', 'be', 'born', 'Japanese', 'just', 'Miss', 'Landlady', 'had', 'been', 'Aoi', 'interested', 'Kaoru', 'fun', 'stories', 'time', 'college', 'impulsively', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'Meiritsu', 'College', 'just', 'share', 'taiyaki', 'reason', 'being', 'mythically', 'delicious', 'taiyaki', 'shop', 'up', 'random', 'places', 'However', 'traditional', 'clothing', 'draws', 'stares', 'more', 'modern-dressed', 'students', 'who', 'think', 'actress', 'model', 'causing', 'poor', 'girl', 'bewilderment', 'cute', 'scene', 'when', 'down', 'Kaoru', 'bedding', 'pair', 'cat', 'ears', 'wagging', 'tail', 'addition', 'Taeko', 'Uzume', 'ferret', 'tableau', 'missing', 'two', 'more', 'characters', 'one', 'whom', 'debuts', 'next', 'disc', 'However', 'lineup', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'Tina', 'mentioned', 'just', 'real', 'family']",N/A
738179,A2HH9HB8IVSNAH,B00008DDG1,"J. Fink ""hodgemo2""","[2, 3]","I keep flipping back and forth on this anime.  It came highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy anime, and can stomach a fair amount of fan service.  I know that the amazon.com review says ""for Love Hina fans"" but it's not quite in the same ballpark.  Love Hina (IMHO) was much more lighthearted, with a fair amount of slapstick humor.  Ai Yori Aoshi seems to take itself a little more seriously.  (Although the 2nd disc is WAY more lighthearted than the 1st)  There seems to be a message out there, although I haven't quite figured out what that is.In the interest of time saving, and in an attempt to not repeat (too much) what other reviewers have said, here is a brief diatribe on the pros and cons of Ai Yori Aoshi thus far:1.  The fact that it is more serious at heart is appealing at first, but I find it hard to reconcile this sweet love story with Tina's chest grabbing, and panty shots galore.2.  While it is interesting to see a ""traditional Japanese beauty"" in Aoi, and to get a look in the more traditional Japanese culture (most animes portray Japan in such a way that you could almost imagine it taking place in the US),  in this day and age, it may seem a little outdated.  In one of the episodes on disc 2, Aoi goes to the university and doesn't know how to act, or speak, in the slightest.  Personally, while I wasn't able to empathize with her character much because of the culture gap, it was her voice that I found most annoying.  (I think it is acually the VA who did Chi in Chobits)--OK, I was corrected on that point, it isn't the VA who voiced Chi.  But I still found her voice a bit annoying.3.  Also in the cast of characters is an American, and a Japanese girl from England.  While it is cool to hear Mayu actually speaking English in the sub version for a minute, and to have a broad background in the characters to get a bigger perspective, I feel this show falls victim to promoting sterotypes.4.  The music is pretty, but doesn't draw you in the way that Steel Angel Kurumi or Love Hina do during the theme songs.5.  The show, thanks to Pioneer is released on 5 discs, which at 26 episodes, is 5-6 episodes a disc!  However, there isn't really much in the way of extras, though the inserts have some small amount of information in the way of japanese culture, architecture, etc.All in all, I would say this is worth a watch.  There are some funny moments, though I don't think I've done more than chuckle or snicker.  There are some touching moments as well (I'm in love with that ferret!  That was the most moved I've been the entire show!).  I would recommend it over Please Teacher and His And Her Circumstances (which is a great series for the 1st 2 of 5 discs...then it falls apart and there is absolutely no satisfaction in watching it).  But if you can only but a couple of series, buy Love Hina and Steel Angel Kurumi before you give this a shot.",4,The vote is still out...,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,2909,"['keep', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'anime', 'came', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'anime', 'can', 'stomach', 'fair', 'amount', 'fan', 'service', 'know', 'amazon.com', 'review', 'Love', 'Hina', 'fans', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'ballpark', 'Love', 'Hina', 'IMHO', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'fair', 'amount', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'seriously', '2nd', 'disc', 'WAY', 'more', 'lighthearted', '1st', 'be', 'message', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'interest', 'time', 'saving', 'attempt', 'not', 'repeat', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'brief', 'diatribe', 'pros', 'cons', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'thus', 'far:1', 'fact', 'more', 'serious', 'heart', 'appealing', 'first', 'find', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'Tina', 'chest', 'grabbing', 'panty', 'shots', 'galore.2', 'interesting', 'see', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'beauty', 'Aoi', 'get', 'look', 'more', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'most', 'animes', 'portray', 'Japan', 'such', 'way', 'could', 'almost', 'imagine', 'taking', 'place', 'US', 'day', 'age', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'outdated', 'one', 'episodes', 'disc', '2', 'Aoi', 'university', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'speak', 'slightest', 'Personally', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'empathize', 'character', 'much', 'culture', 'gap', 'was', 'voice', 'found', 'most', 'annoying', 'think', 'acually', 'VA', 'who', 'did', 'Chi', 'Chobits', 'OK', 'was', 'corrected', 'point', ""n't"", 'VA', 'who', 'voiced', 'Chi', 'still', 'found', 'voice', 'bit', 'annoying.3', 'Also', 'cast', 'characters', 'American', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'England', 'cool', 'hear', 'Mayu', 'actually', 'speaking', 'English', 'sub', 'version', 'minute', 'have', 'broad', 'background', 'characters', 'get', 'bigger', 'perspective', 'feel', 'show', 'victim', 'promoting', 'sterotypes.4', 'music', 'pretty', ""n't"", 'draw', 'way', 'Steel', 'Angel', 'Kurumi', 'Love', 'Hina', 'do', 'theme', 'songs.5', 'show', 'thanks', 'Pioneer', 'released', '5', 'discs', '26', 'episodes', '5-6', 'episodes', 'disc', 'However', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'inserts', 'have', 'small', 'amount', 'information', 'way', 'japanese', 'culture', 'architecture', 'etc.All', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'chuckle', 'snicker', 'are', 'touching', 'moments', 'well', ""'m"", 'love', 'ferret', 'was', 'most', 'moved', ""'ve"", 'been', 'entire', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'Circumstances', 'great', 'series', '1st', '2', '5', 'discs', 'then', 'apart', 'absolutely', 'satisfaction', 'watching', 'can', 'only', 'couple', 'series', 'buy', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Steel', 'Angel', 'Kurumi', 'give', 'shot']",N/A
