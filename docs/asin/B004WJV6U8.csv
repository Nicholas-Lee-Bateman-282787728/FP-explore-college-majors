Just really liked the soul sound of ""100 Miles from Memphis"" CD and this concert adds flavor to even her classics with a twist. It's different, and I really like it!! She seems like she is actually enjoying herself performing this style and this blu-ray really shows that. I have most of her concerts on DVD/blu-ray and this is my second favorite(Sheryl Crow: Live From Londonbeing my favorite). The picture quality and sound quality of this latest release is a delight!The change DID do her good!! It's not the same retread over again!Crank it up!

1430652,A81P47EIXM8HA,B004WJV6U8,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[40, 61]","I really like Sheryl Crow....have all her DVDs, have seen her live several times.  Her most recent album100 Miles From Memphisisn't my favorite but its grown on me.  This concert represents in my humble opinion , a bored artist who like so many before her have tried to get in touch with a soul side they may or may not in reality have. For Sheryl to begin to re interpret her songs with a new urban vocal phrasing it just doesn't come off as authentic to me but posing in the soul world.  I know she grew up enjoying this music but that doesn't mean you can do it...heck the world is full of artists who were influenced by Elvis and The Beatles ...and many became legendary themselves but they had to go their own way instead of forcing bad imitations on the world. Its one thing to make an album that is for yourself and perhaps goes another direction but taking it on the road with todays inflated concert ticket prices and foisting not only 10 new songs on fans but reworking songs they know and love seems self indulgent to me. Hey...that's just my opinion which is what reviews are and I rarely write terrible reviews preferring to let others do that but I also think with budgets being what they are folks read these things to decide if and what to buy and I hope those on the fence might try one of Sheryl's other wonderful DVDs first if they are not completists as I am.Perhaps I'm just too much of the ""if its not broke don't fix it"" mentality but I think this is easily the least interesting Sheryl Crow show to date.  I don't mind artists trying to spread their wings and Sheryl has always grown as a songwriter on her albums to my ears. I just find the whole white artist trying to pretend they are black thing so played, tired and as George Carlin would say ""Lame"". By scrapping her band and covering the stage with black back up singers, horn players and band members it doesn't infuse her with soul it just makes her look and sound even more out of place and wrong.  Oh goodness some of this show is frankly cringe inducing...and when she trying to channel a REAL soul singer singing in a freelance and pathetic adlib ""what the F... is going on"" I am thinking as a viewer...that she read my mind.As far as the video ...it seems desperately trying to invest this show with some current relevance and a hip factor by the use of angles,cuts,cropping and colors and only seems to point out the weakness of the actual musical content. Close ups of Sheryl's high heels just seem stupid...and Sheryl doesn't seem to be comfortable and know what to do with her arms without a guitar or Bass.My goodness in the liner notes that come with this ,written by Sheryl, she has all the humility to call one of her song performances ""epic"". She named her band ""the Thieves"" and I was feeling robbed half way through watching this...but counted myself lucky that it was cheap and that I didn't actually go to the show that was filmed as it was in my town and I had considered going.Sheryl is a great rock n roller...hall of fame material to my thinking and she just doesn't have the legitimate soul vocal chops to stand on a stage and pretend to be what she isn't. Get your guitar and your rock n roll band and do what makes you special is what I'd say to her and be a great Sheryl Crow instead of a wannabee Aretha...LATE EDIT... I watched this again tonight, after getting over my initial disappointment and I have to add the LOW point has to be her scat singing after ""Strong Enough"" she talks/sings about looking for a man...laments that since the show is in LA she's probably already been with all the guys? Then sings that she's looking for a good man...one that could be a step father or father...(legit enough) then scats Republicans need not apply and he needs to make as much money as her...then after that loving thought...well maybe not spend as much as her"". And folks wonder why beautiful and talented women like her adopt and can't seem to find love?  Then...when I think I've lost all respect for her she redeems herself musically anyway, with two wonderfully performed tunes (the acoustic guitars are good and the background vocalists are very sympathetic with her) on Redemption Day and Long Road Home ...which are good enough to offset the prior scat lunacy and would cause me to rate this 3 stars.",2,The Change didn't do her good.....,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,4315,"['really', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', '.have', 'DVDs', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'several', 'times', 'most', 'recent', 'album100', 'Miles', 'Memphisis', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'grown', 'concert', 'humble', 'opinion', 'bored', 'artist', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'touch', 'soul', 'side', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'reality', 'have', 'Sheryl', 'begin', 're', 'interpret', 'songs', 'new', 'urban', 'vocal', 'phrasing', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'authentic', 'posing', 'soul', 'world', 'know', 'grew', 'up', 'enjoying', 'music', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'do', 'world', 'full', 'artists', 'who', 'were', 'influenced', 'Elvis', 'Beatles', 'many', 'became', 'legendary', 'had', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'instead', 'forcing', 'bad', 'imitations', 'world', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'album', 'perhaps', 'direction', 'taking', 'road', 'todays', 'inflated', 'concert', 'ticket', 'prices', 'foisting', 'not', 'only', '10', 'new', 'songs', 'fans', 'reworking', 'songs', 'know', 'love', 'self', 'indulgent', 'Hey', 'just', 'opinion', 'what', 'reviews', 'are', 'rarely', 'write', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'preferring', 'let', 'others', 'do', 'also', 'think', 'budgets', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'folks', 'read', 'things', 'decide', 'what', 'buy', 'hope', 'fence', 'might', 'try', 'one', 'Sheryl', 'other', 'wonderful', 'DVDs', 'first', 'are', 'not', 'completists', 'am.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'mentality', 'think', 'easily', 'least', 'interesting', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'show', 'date', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'artists', 'trying', 'spread', 'wings', 'Sheryl', 'always', 'grown', 'songwriter', 'albums', 'ears', 'just', 'find', 'whole', 'white', 'artist', 'trying', 'pretend', 'are', 'black', 'thing', 'so', 'played', 'tired', 'George', 'Carlin', 'would', 'say', 'Lame', 'scrapping', 'band', 'covering', 'stage', 'black', 'back', 'singers', 'horn', 'players', 'band', 'members', ""n't"", 'infuse', 'soul', 'just', 'look', 'sound', 'even', 'more', 'place', 'wrong', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'show', 'frankly', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'when', 'trying', 'channel', 'REAL', 'soul', 'singer', 'singing', 'freelance', 'pathetic', 'adlib', 'what', 'F', 'going', 'am', 'thinking', 'viewer', 'read', 'mind.As', 'far', 'video', 'desperately', 'trying', 'invest', 'show', 'current', 'relevance', 'hip', 'factor', 'use', 'angles', 'cuts', 'cropping', 'colors', 'only', 'point', 'out', 'weakness', 'actual', 'musical', 'content', 'Close', 'ups', 'Sheryl', 'high', 'heels', 'just', 'seem', 'stupid', 'Sheryl', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'comfortable', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'arms', 'guitar', 'Bass.My', 'goodness', 'liner', 'come', 'written', 'Sheryl', 'humility', 'call', 'one', 'song', 'epic', 'named', 'band', 'Thieves', 'was', 'feeling', 'robbed', 'half', 'way', 'watching', 'counted', 'was', 'cheap', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'go', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'town', 'had', 'considered', 'going.Sheryl', 'great', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', 'hall', 'fame', 'material', 'thinking', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'legitimate', 'soul', 'vocal', 'chops', 'stand', 'stage', 'pretend', 'be', 'what', ""n't"", 'Get', 'guitar', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'do', 'what', 'special', 'what', ""'d"", 'say', 'be', 'great', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'instead', 'wannabee', 'Aretha', 'LATE', 'EDIT', 'watched', 'again', 'tonight', 'getting', 'initial', 'disappointment', 'have', 'add', 'LOW', 'point', 'be', 'scat', 'singing', 'Strong', 'Enough', 'looking', 'man', 'show', 'LA', 'probably', 'already', 'been', 'guys', 'Then', 'looking', 'good', 'man', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'step', 'father', 'father', 'legit', 'enough', 'then', 'Republicans', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'make', 'much', 'money', 'then', 'loving', 'thought', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'spend', 'as', 'much', 'folks', 'wonder', 'why', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'women', 'adopt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'love', 'Then', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'respect', 'musically', 'anyway', 'two', 'wonderfully', 'performed', 'tunes', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'are', 'good', 'background', 'vocalists', 'are', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Redemption', 'Day', 'Long', 'Road', 'Home', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'offset', 'prior', 'scat', 'lunacy', 'would', 'cause', 'rate', '3', 'stars']",Sheryl Crow: Miles from Memphis Live at the Pantages Theatre
