1247536,AS31UPUVR0MZB,B0021L8V0M,Amazoning,"[0, 0]","3.5 starsCIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a Russian spy by a Russian spy named Orlov.  Salt denies being a Russian spy, but her counter intelligence colleagues are divided about whether or not this is true.  She makes a break for it, escaping from her colleagues.  The movie follows Salt as she uncovers the truth behind Orlov's accusation, all while dodging pursuit from numerous, heavily armed U. S. agents.  The action is intense, and plentiful.  I think all aspects of Jolie's portrayal of Salt are believable, and well done.  The film does fail in some points.Part of the plot near the end of the theatrical release is sketchy.  A witness is left alive, one whose testimony would be fatal to their attacker.  This is addressed in the director's cut.  U. S. agents shooting at Salt in situations crowded with civilians, and in traffic, stretches credibility for me.  Next, there are too many happy (for Salt) coincidences during Salt's escape from the U. S. agents.  Four different vehicles -- perfect for her needs -- just happen by, at just the right time, for Salt to use.  The result is an incredible action sequence that's tainted by too many unbelievable coincidences.  Salt so effectively evades those searching for her, I don't think she could have done a better job of avoiding detection if she wore a cloak of invisibility.The biggest problem I have with the film is that Salt seems to have suprahuman healing abilities.  She takes on some physical damage that would result in a mere mortal having an extended hospital stay, if they even survived.  Yet, Salt walks away from such events, usually with only a bit of a limp, a grimace, and a sideways glance.  At times, Salt comes across like the X-Men's Wolverine, due to her amazing recuperative powers.The story does a nice job handling the truth about whether or not Salt is a Russian spy.  Jolie is the standout, as her portrayal shows Salt as being complex.  From being vulnerable and gentle towards those Salt cares about, to being chillingly efficient when attacking an adversary.Overall, I think the movie is a worth viewing.",3,"Lots of Action, Lots of Implausibility",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,2122,"['3.5', 'starsCIA', 'agent', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'accused', 'being', 'Russian', 'spy', 'Russian', 'spy', 'named', 'Orlov', 'Salt', 'being', 'Russian', 'spy', 'counter', 'intelligence', 'colleagues', 'are', 'divided', 'not', 'true', 'break', 'escaping', 'colleagues', 'movie', 'Salt', 'truth', 'Orlov', 'accusation', 'dodging', 'pursuit', 'numerous', 'heavily', 'armed', 'U.', 'S.', 'agents', 'action', 'intense', 'plentiful', 'think', 'aspects', 'Jolie', 'portrayal', 'Salt', 'are', 'believable', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'fail', 'points.Part', 'plot', 'end', 'theatrical', 'release', 'sketchy', 'witness', 'left', 'alive', 'one', 'testimony', 'would', 'be', 'fatal', 'attacker', 'addressed', 'director', 'cut', 'U.', 'S.', 'agents', 'shooting', 'Salt', 'situations', 'crowded', 'civilians', 'traffic', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'Next', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'happy', 'Salt', 'coincidences', 'Salt', 'escape', 'U.', 'S.', 'agents', 'Four', 'different', 'vehicles', 'perfect', 'needs', 'just', 'happen', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'Salt', 'use', 'result', 'incredible', 'action', 'sequence', 'tainted', 'too', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'coincidences', 'Salt', 'so', 'effectively', 'evades', 'searching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'avoiding', 'detection', 'wore', 'cloak', 'invisibility.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'Salt', 'have', 'suprahuman', 'healing', 'abilities', 'physical', 'damage', 'would', 'result', 'mere', 'mortal', 'having', 'extended', 'hospital', 'stay', 'even', 'survived', 'Salt', 'away', 'such', 'events', 'usually', 'only', 'bit', 'limp', 'grimace', 'sideways', 'glance', 'times', 'Salt', 'X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'due', 'amazing', 'recuperative', 'powers.The', 'story', 'nice', 'job', 'handling', 'truth', 'not', 'Salt', 'Russian', 'spy', 'Jolie', 'standout', 'portrayal', 'Salt', 'being', 'complex', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'gentle', 'towards', 'Salt', 'cares', 'about', 'being', 'chillingly', 'efficient', 'when', 'attacking', 'adversary.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.

This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes I know this story is been done before but never as well acted.Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her own people? And it appears that she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities.

1247549,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B0021L8V0M,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[9, 13]","Angelina Jolie's acting has often been overshadowed by her marriage. Anyone who has viewed Changeling or Girl, interrupted, has obviously witnessed her great range in different and equally challenging roles. However, at the end of the day, she and her husband are viewed as mere celebrities-not different than reality stars-than serious actors. She has long affirmed her place among the great actresses of the last decade, but her public persona has often overshadowed her career. Salt is proof that even in the Hollywood blockbuster, she is as versatile as one can be.In the beginning of the film, we view CIA agent Evelyn Salt, played by Jolie, being tortured by North Korean authorities. Due to a miraculous trade between the Americans and North Koreans, she is freed to return home. Not long after her arrival in her country, she comes in contact with a Russian defector who informs of a deadly operation named ""Day: X."" Planned since the onset of the Cold War, the execution of this plan will mean the end of the United States. Possibly indicative of its execution is his testament that the Russian President will die at the funeral of the American Vice-President. Salt is a throwback to those classic films, notably The Manchurian Candidate, which focused on the conflicts and animosity between the two countries. This film may seem quite dated, as the cold war and the most notable of the two nation's conflicts seems to have ended, but it focuses on current times and events, implicating that the animosity of many Russians have yet to end. They are still training operatives, from childhood, and releasing them within the United States and awaiting the best time to take action.Fortunately, this ""Day: X"" does not seem to be under the control of the Russian authorities, but old men of the Cold War era who want to put an end to the US. As politically correct as possible, the film avoids introducing the motives behind ""Day: X."" Is this a war against democracy, the current US president, or generally do these men enjoy seeing this superpower feel threatened for a change? Such claims are never addressed, keeping the film quite light in ideology and philosophy. For the sake of argument, let's suppose the mastermind of the plan simply hates all that is American about the US and needs to wipe this country of the map to rest easily. The film is Hollywood entertainment that simply wants to suppose that America has enemies for some very vague and unknown reasons, despite its efforts to spread ""peace"" across the globe.The film will invariably will be compared to the Manchurian Candidate for its countless twists. That classic film is obviously of enormous social and historical importance, but both are fascinatingly deceptive in toying around with the audience's perception of the main characters. For some time, Salt shows infinite amount of courage in alienating its American audience by showcasing the success of the Russians in causing havoc in the United States; some may even see parts of the film, before the major revelation as hugely anti-American. Seeing this in a packed theater, I did sense some anger or tension from fellow viewers. It was the unbelievable sense of betrayal from a film that took pleasure in lambasting and lampooning the secret service, or the ease by which the Russians were able to overcome all the security barriers and harm such powerful diplomats. Of course, Hollywood would never want to cause a stir by showing an incident that may mirror 9/11, and display a more wide scale target and tragedy. No, that would be thoughtful and somewhat depressive, and studios have a strong disdain for portraying the foreseeable, yet unfortunate, future-they would rather fill our heads with countless post apocalyptic junk. Sure, the film eventually loses its fire in relation to its intriguing post-cold war analysis of the relation between these two nations, but for a blockbuster even such an attempt is admirable. Salt does not have an actual agenda in regards to the relations of Russia and US at present, but it cleverly uses the elements of the old cold war films, many which were propaganda products, to tell its tale. If the film actually had been faithful to its vision, it would have initiated an abundant amount of controversy for this film; controversy that really would not aid the film in any shape or form.The real loser, overall, is Tom Cruise who lost the role to Jolie-as it was later rewritten for her. Choosing Jolie was a wise move, considering that a female character more successfully balances out the tension and anger of the media and the appreciation of her Russian comrades. A female character can convey better her loyalty and betrayal for each side, without seeming as sinister and excessively callous. Jolie really deserves more challenging role, such as those which Kate Winslet seems to always attain, but she still gives a dedicated performance. It is quite bewildering that we feel sorry for her misfortunes, but later grow to dislike her as her true colors begin to show. She picks exactly the right tone for her performance, caring, emotional, and superficially honest. Jolie brings the unexpected masculinity to the film that is quite unexpected of her. Such films are often reserved for butch male actors, and often bodybuilders, such as Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Jean Claude Van Damme, but Jolie proves that actresses can bring much needed likeability and vulnerability to the role. Salt eventually lags near the ending-in regards to the realism of its Russian-US relations and the outcome of Evelyn's crimes and their belated revelation-but considering its conception as a Hollywood blockbuster, it is surprisingly fresh and a winner.",5,4.5 Stars: Quite remarkable for a Hollywood Blockbuster!

It is definately worth watching and entertaining depending on your taste in movies. Yet, in recent years, Hollywood, screenwriters and movie producers have taken a poor step in the keep em' happy direction. 'Keep em' happy' in the sense of the movie shouldn't stop. The audience paid for action and their gonna get it.Well, the audience is getting action, but at the expense of character development and setup and explanation and just plain mood. There is little to zero effort by the filmmakers to let us know what is going on inside the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).The movie opens up with a violent scene of interrogation as Salt is beaten by N.Korean soldiers, accused of being a spy as she repeatedly assures them that she isn't a spy. The audience affectively wonders if maybe she isn't a spy and she is a victim of mistaken identity. Yet, as the scene breaks and she is escorted back to an American helicopter, released by some high power, the movie then jumps to a scene where we discover, quite unceremoniously that, well, she is a spy and an agent for the U.S. government.This pretty much sums up the entire movie from that point on. There are many twists and turns in SALT, but none of them have an ounce of setup or tactic to keep the audience guessing. Everything is right in your face and gets straight to the action, as if the entire movie viewing world weren't smart enough to be toyed with.None of the twists and turns in SALT, and there are many, garner a gasp, or surprise or any reaction other than, ""where's the popcorn?""A good movie that will fall, if it hasn't already, into the pile of movies that will not be thought of ever again, 3 weeks after its video release.",3,TOO FAST no Character development,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1790,"['Just', 'issued', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'SALT', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'definately', 'worth', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'depending', 'taste', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriters', 'movie', 'producers', 'have', 'taken', 'poor', 'step', 'keep', 'em', 'happy', 'direction', 'em', 'happy', 'sense', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'audience', 'paid', 'action', 'gon', 'get', 'it.Well', 'audience', 'getting', 'action', 'expense', 'character', 'development', 'setup', 'explanation', 'just', 'plain', 'mood', 'little', 'zero', 'effort', 'filmmakers', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'main', 'character', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', '.The', 'movie', 'up', 'violent', 'scene', 'interrogation', 'Salt', 'beaten', 'N.Korean', 'soldiers', 'accused', 'being', 'spy', 'repeatedly', ""n't"", 'spy', 'audience', 'affectively', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'spy', 'victim', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Yet', 'scene', 'breaks', 'escorted', 'back', 'American', 'helicopter', 'released', 'high', 'power', 'movie', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'discover', 'quite', 'unceremoniously', 'well', 'spy', 'agent', 'U.S.', 'government.This', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'point', 'are', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'SALT', 'none', 'have', 'ounce', 'setup', 'tactic', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'Everything', 'right', 'face', 'straight', 'action', 'entire', 'movie', 'viewing', 'world', 'were', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'toyed', 'with.None', 'twists', 'turns', 'SALT', 'are', 'many', 'garner', 'gasp', 'surprise', 'reaction', 'other', 'where', 'popcorn', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'fall', ""n't"", 'already', 'pile', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'thought', 'ever', 'again', '3', 'weeks', 'video', 'release']",N/A
1247572,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0021L8V0M,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 7]","Isn't it amazing how we play the entertainment card to make excuses for preposterous films? We as audiences will buy into a whole host of cinematic flaws as long as there are sights and sounds to keep us amused, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. Maybe it's just what is. ""Salt,"" like so many summer action movies before it, is a fun thrill-a-minute stunt caper, and yet it possesses not a single shred of plausibility. It's one of those movies that gives you license to put your brain on autopilot; you're not supposed to question it, you're just supposed to enjoy it for what it is. I hope this isn't a copout on my part, considering all the other escapist summer films I've dismissed (""Eagle Eye,"" the ""Transformers"" films, ""The A-Team""). The fact that it's a spy thriller may have something to do with why it works. Tales of international intrigue involving secret agents are generally successful.The plot: Trusted CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused by a Russian defector of secretly being a sleeper agent for the KGB, Russia's foremost internal security organization. He also says she will be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of Russia, who will be in New York City attending the funeral of the American Vice President. Although she denies the defector's claims, she realizes that she will be held against her will, which will endanger the life of her German husband, a spider scientist (a plot point that isn't as inconsequential as it might seem). Using every trick in the book, Salt escapes headquarters and goes on the run, claiming that she's out to clear her name. Pursuing her are Agents Winter (Liev Shreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the former is willing to believe her innocence while the latter is highly suspicious.One of the film's most ridiculous yet clever story points is an elaborate decades-old scheme by the Russian government to brainwash children into being KGB agents. Their goal: Raise them to blend in, have them infiltrate the United States, and then let them bide their time until X Day, an operation that will plunge the country into nuclear war with the rest of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sinister plot in a James Bond film, with or without the silly gadgets and gizmos built into wristwatches and ball-point pens. What does any of this have to do with Evelyn Salt? Wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say that, whatever her association, she gets to take part in many death-defying stunts, including impressive acrobatic leaps from the tops of semi trucks and gas tankers, all moving along at average freeway speeds.Stories like this require a plot twist or two, and you'll get them both in ""Salt."" I will say that, given the formulaic nature of spy thrillers, the twists aren't all that surprising - one is, in fact, so predictable that I could tell it was coming as early as the first ten minutes. But what this movie lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in sheer action spectacle, aided greatly by decent casting choices. Jolie, still in her prime, has been amazingly versatile, with credits as diverse as ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" ""Changeling,"" ""A Mighty Heart,"" and ""Wanted"" to her name; it's always a good sign when an actor can convincingly touch you deeply in one movie and get your heart pounding in another. Schreiber and Ejiofor play fairly generic roles, but in all fairness, they do the best with what little they're given.The only disappointment is Salt's husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl), who's featured so infrequently that I couldn't bring myself to care about him. This is bad because he is an important character, not merely because of his field of study, but also because of his emotional ties to Salt. Flashback sequences showing the two together should have been enough, but for me, something was missing. Maybe it was just a matter of too little screen time; had he been more actively involved, had he been given more dialogue, something substantial could have developed. As it is, I don't think anything of great importance would have been lost if this character had been altogether removed. Let the spider thing work itself in differently.We need another mindless action film about as much as we need another reality show. But if they absolutely have to be made, then ""Salt"" is a good indicator of what they should be like. Yes, it's silly from start to finish. Yes, it doesn't bother with anything that's even remotely realistic. But boy, it certainly knows how to keep an audience entertained. The action is plentiful. The mystery is engaging. The characters are well-played. The suspense is palpable. It's a lot of fun. And here I go again, sliding that entertainment card from out my sleeve, slipping into a fairly weak hand. Are we too easily amused? Movies like this are enjoyable distractions, but I shudder to think this is all we have left when it comes to summer popcorn flicks. As is the case with real salt, too much isn't good for you - just a pinch will do.",4,Just a Pinch Will Do,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,5045,"[""n't"", 'amazing', 'how', 'play', 'entertainment',

I agree with Stallone in feeling that there is a shortage of these types of films in general, let alone descent ones; the last good one I can remember offhand, being The Punisher (2004).Angelina Jolie has impressed me and no doubt Stallone as well, with her latest film Salt, where she shows that it doesn't take a man to walk into a room and kill everyone; she can do it too. And man, does she do it; with skill, style and sex appeal. Short of maybe Charlize Theron, no other actress could have pulled this role off.She is Evelyn Salt. She's a spy for the CIA. Or is she? A dangerous looking Russian man walks himself into the CIA headquarters to report that a Russian Spy living in America, will assassinate the president of Russia, during his visit to the states. Ready for the kicker? The creepy Russian man leers at Evelyn from across the interview table and informs her that she is said Russian Spy / future assassin!You can imagine the look of shock on the faces of her comrades, who are taping the interview from the next room; not to mention Evelyn's. Sadly, that's all I can divulge to you. Trust me, there's so much more to tell, that it's killing me not to - but you'll have to see it for yourself! Twist and turn after twist and turn. Some you may see coming, others you probably will not. Either way - you will have a blast watching her run for her life; the filmmakers leaving us in limbo as to whether we should be rooting for her or not.The film is over the top, sure. At times it's even a tad irritating, having you sitting there going, `Oh, come on."" A knife being snuck into the CIA headquarters; unnoticed information on CIA agents' background checks; the Whitehouse being penetrated as easily as a few 17-year-olds sneaking into a frat party; leaps from helicopters and freeways and moving vehicles, and etc., etc. My personal favorite would be Jolie (to quote Woody, from Toy Story), ""falling with style"", down an elevator shaft, passing several floors with each jump, and grabbing onto a ledge just right each time. This is something they should have had her do in the Lara Croft movies, as it was done in the videogames; but they didn't, so never mind.Speaking of videogames, Salt could make a very interesting one indeed and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is followed by a sequel. Videogames? Sequels? `One girl killin' everyone?"" I know - sounds like it could be a too much, but the film works. It's very cleverly written and directed, and Jolie's butt kicking action scenes are matched evenly throughout the film, with dramatic ones sharing brilliant acting from her two co-stars, Live Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Schreiber and Ejiofor both play CIA operatives that work with Salt, and are tasked with tracking her down when she has fled. Neither of them is entirely sure if they should trust her alleged innocence, as the film hurls them after her through suspenseful stimulated action chase scenes close to the flavor of those in The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.Director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer know this genre like the back of their hand and the film proves it. A list of their best achievements would be unrelenting; but a short version between the two of them could include Law Abiding Citizen, Street Kings, The Bone Collector, Patriot Games and The Saint.In closing, having enjoyed the film a great deal, but also having pointed out how un-plausible some of the events were, I feel the need to defend it one last time. I can say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means. At least most of the elements in this film could maybe happen; and the performances of the actors, only add believability to us finding those things being possible.",4,Salt Review,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,4263,"['SALTSTARRING', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Daniel', 'Olbrychski', 'August', 'Diehl', 'Daniel', 'Pearce', 'Hunt', 'BlockWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Kurt', 'WimmerDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Phillip', 'NoyceRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'Action', 'ThrillerRelease', 'Date', '23', 'July', '2010Review', 'Date', '30', 'August', '2010Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'new', 'film', 'Expendables', 'several', 'prototypes', 'characters', 'one', 'guy', 'kills', 'everyone', 'movies', '80s', 'agree', 'Stallone', 'feeling', 'shortage', 'types', 'films', 'general', 'let', 'alone', 'descent', 'ones', 'last', 'good', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'offhand', 'being', 'Punisher', '2004', '.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'impressed', 'doubt', 'Stallone', 'as', 'well', 'latest', 'film', 'Salt', 'where', ""n't"", 'take', 'man', 'walk', 'room', 'kill', 'everyone', 'can', 'do', 'too', 'man', 'do', 'skill', 'style', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Short', 'maybe', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'other', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'role', 'off.She', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'spy', 'CIA', 'dangerous', 'looking', 'Russian', 'man', 'CIA', 'headquarters', 'report', 'Russian', 'Spy', 'living', 'America', 'will', 'assassinate', 'president', 'Russia', 'visit', 'states', 'Ready', 'kicker', 'creepy', 'Russian', 'man', 'leers', 'Evelyn', 'interview', 'table', 'said', 'Russian', 'Spy', '/', 'future', 'assassin', 'can', 'imagine', 'look', 'shock', 'comrades', 'who', 'are', 'taping', 'interview', 'next', 'room', 'not', 'mention', 'Evelyn', 'Sadly', 'can', 'divulge', 'Trust', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'tell', 'killing', 'not', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'Twist', 'turn', 'twist', 'turn', 'may', 'see', 'coming', 'others', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'watching', 'run', 'life', 'filmmakers', 'leaving', 'limbo', 'should', 'be', 'rooting', 'not.The', 'film', 'top', 'sure', 'times', 'even', 'tad', 'irritating', 'having', 'sitting', 'there', 'going', 'Oh', 'come', 'knife', 'being', 'snuck', 'CIA', 'headquarters', 'unnoticed', 'information', 'CIA', 'agents', 'background', 'checks', 'Whitehouse', 'being', 'penetrated', 'as', 'easily', 'few', '17-year-olds', 'sneaking', 'frat', 'party', 'helicopters', 'freeways', 'moving', 'vehicles', 'etc.', 'etc', 'personal', 'favorite', 'would', 'be', 'Jolie', 'quote', 'Woody', 'Toy', 'Story', 'falling', 'style', 'down', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'passing', 'several', 'floors', 'jump', 'grabbing', 'ledge', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'movies', 'was', 'done', 'videogames', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'never', 'mind.Speaking', 'videogames', 'Salt', 'could', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'indeed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'followed', 'sequel', 'Videogames', 'Sequels', 'One', 'girl', 'killin', 'everyone', 'know', 'sounds', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'very', 'cleverly', 'written', 'directed', 'Jolie', 'butt', 'kicking', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'matched', 'evenly', 'film', 'dramatic', 'ones', 'sharing', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor.Schreiber', 'Ejiofor', 'play', 'CIA', 'work', 'Salt', 'are', 'tasked', 'tracking', 'down', 'when', 'fled', 'entirely', 'sure', 'should', 'trust', 'alleged', 'innocence', 'film', 'hurls', 'suspenseful', 'stimulated', 'action', 'chase', 'scenes', 'close', 'flavor', 'Fugitive', 'Enemy', 'State.Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'screenwriter', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'know', 'genre', 'back', 'hand', 'film', 'list', 'best', 'achievements', 'would', 'be', 'unrelenting', 'short', 'version', 'two', 'could', 'include', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'Street', 'Kings', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Saint.In', 'closing', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'also', 'having', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'un-plausible', 'events', 'were', 'feel', 'need', 'defend', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'definitely', 'seen', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'believability', 'lot', 'further', 'Salt', 'offered', 'only', 'phony', 'acting', 'return', 'justify', 'means', 'least', 'most', 'elements', 'film', 'could', 'maybe', 'happen', 'performances', 'actors', 'only', 'believability', 'finding', 'things', 'being', 'possible']",N/A

Sawin,"[15, 27]","At first glance, Salt  looked like it had a lot of potential to deliver a thriller that utilized both pulse racing action and a strong female lead. However, it's unfortunate that that's all the film really was. Other than Angelina Jolie beating the snot out of men twice her size for an hour and a half, the film offered little else.It makes sense that children who are trained to be Russian spies while they're young would be capable of doing extraordinary things that the average human being wouldn't be able to, but Salt seemed borderline superhuman at times. The ability to handle various firearms and making homemade bombs out of cleaning supplies is one thing, but climbing around skyscrapers and bouncing off the walls like Spider-Man seemed like a bit of a stretch. The way she'd steal things as she was passing by came off as more of an unlikely repeated occurrence of both luck and convenience rather than a skillful attribute.The storyline is also ridiculously outlandish. It includes such gems as Lee Harvey Oswald actually being a Russian spy named Alek and a rather predictable plot twist in the climax. One of the weakest parts of the film is how inconclusive Salt's motifs come off as. The film was probably trying to keep you guessing as to whether or not Salt was actually a spy up until the big reveal, but her actions appear more confusing than anything and are relatively unclear until the end. Then her reasoning behind her actions just seemed so one-dimensional and dull that you wonder why you even bothered to watch this thriller to begin with. Not to mention that the film has a bigger open-ending than Predators did earlier this year.Salt does deliver some fast paced, bone crunching action and features an incredibly strong female lead, but its preposterous and predictable storyline drags it down. Salt is way too similar to everything else Angelina Jolie has done to go out of your way and see. The bottom line is the film treads familiar ground that you've already seen before and has probably been done better. If you're dead set on seeing Salt, I strongly encourage you to wait until it hits DVD and Blu-ray.

With a few exceptions, all of the chasing, fighting and shooting was aimed at stopping the bad guys, not killing them.  I am sure that Jolie did not do many of the stunts, but it was filmed and edited so well that one could not tell if it was her performing the death defying actions of her character.  The premise and story of the film added to its interest but a number of motivations and actions were either unclear or somewhat non-sensical.  This may have been due to editing out some of the details or just not incorporating them to begin with.  However, these weaknesses could probably be cured by writing more specific purpose for several scenes that would not take more that an additional 5 or 10 minutes of film.  I did watch the film twice to make sure I did not miss certain explanatory information.  I do not think I missed anything of significance.So, I rate this film 5 stars for its excitement and enjoyment but reduce that rating by 1 star because the film was not logically and tightly put together as it could have been.

The theatrical version starts with a bang and the pace keeps going at a rapid clip for the rest of the movie.

1247591,A313OU4NOWZDBY,B0021L8V0M,David R. Allen,"[1, 1]","Salt (2010 Columbia) starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Philip Noyce is a duplication and update of a well done French classic movie make in 1990 titled La Femme Nikita (1990 France) starring Anne Parillaud and directed by Luc Beeson.See the ""Alternatiave Ending"" version of this movie.....it's better, makes better sense, should have been chosen as the ""primary"" or ""main"" version of the movie released to movie houses. The Alternative version ending is very intelligent and satisfying in a way the ""official,"" ""main"" version of the movie is not. Nuff said!Well....more about that....(to drive the point home!)......The ""Alternative Ending"" version of ""Salt"" (2010) available on DVD's with several variations of the movie is the best one, and all interested in the great ""Salt"" movie should see that version, rather than the version which was released to the movie houses in 2010, and which is the ""default"" ""official,"" and ""main"" version viewers see unless they visit the ""special features"" section of the DVD of ""Salt"" and choose the ""alternative ending.""To get back to the comparison of ""Salt"" (2010) with ""La Femme Nikita"" (1990), both movies are about beautiful females who look like high fashion ramp models, both unusually underweight with exotic faces and thick, sensuous lips, who are recruited, manipulated, forced to become government assassins, and who murder many innocent people in cold blood 'doing their job"" during the course of the story and the movie, but in the end ""jump ship"" and escape from their government manipulator puppet-masters, and disappear at the end of both movies to an unknown and uncertain future....the price both women pay for escaping from their roles as forced government assassins.Both movies demonstrate and assert that the classical ""femme fa tale"" may be part of a story which has almost nothing to do with romance or connection with any male, and also that the female protagonist in an action/ mystery story (both Salt and La Femme Nikita are action/ mystery stories) can be capable of astonishing feats of physical prowess and strength against male antagonists in which the female wins physical fights and the males lose....repeatedly.Both Angelina Jolie as ""Evelyn Salt"" in SALT and Anne Parillaud (one of the top fashion models in France before she became a movie star) as ""Nikita"" retire from the stories both star in ""undefeated"" in all serious contests they engage in....the men they come up against always lose, the female protagonists always win.The female protagonists never face female antagonists in either movie, which is significant.The Salt (2010) movie uses a lot of tricky editing and fast paced cutting to assist Angelina Jolie 'do her thing"" beating up men and doing Harrison Ford style action miracles which would easily kill most people....The La Femme Nikita (1990) movie is smoother, and more believable for that reason, and probably the better of the two movies for that reason.....it is much less a ""video-game"" Dark Knight type movie, relies far less on gimmicks and technical/ digital tricks.....Salt (2010) starring Angelina Jolie lacks the needed humorous and human intervals provided in La Femme Nikita (1990). The main female character in Salt (2010) is much less lovable and far more driven...she really does stay ""on task"" and is almost a machine as military ideal soldiers are supposed to be. Women may or may not be capable of all the superstar action and heroic stunts Angelina Jolie performs as the ""Evelyn Salt"" character, but such ladies are like the napkins neatly folded for wedding anniversaries Angelina Jolie (""Salt"") comments on at the start of the movie...""Not too sexy."" How true, how true.But Salt is a good movie worth seeing....so, of course is/was La Femme Nikita (1990).The DVD disc version for home viewing I bought included three different versions of the movie, including an ""extended cut"" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending. I can see why the version ultimately released in movie houses and offered as the ""official version"" was chosen. The released version (the ""official"" one) is more logical, and the ending is closer to La Femme Nikita (1990 French).Both Salt (2010) and La Femme Nikita (1990) examine the potential and unexpected physical and mental power of beautiful females built like super-models one sees on Vogue Magazine covers, and almost never in Hollywood (or French) action movies.Both are good movies. We need more just like them....odd that it took 20 years for Salt (2010) to pick up where La Femme Nikita (1990) left off.--------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",5,Salt (2010 Columbia) starring

1247595,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0021L8V0M,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","Move over James Bond!  Stand aside Jason Bourne! Welcome Evelyn Salt.If there is one formula in Hollywood that seems to work, that is having actress Angelina Jolie as your action star. The actress has appeared in several action-based films such as the ""Tomb Raider"" films, ""Wanted"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and her films continue to be box office hits but her role as Evelyn Salt may just be what Hollywood has been wanting and needing, a femme fatale, a spy who literally kicks ass!  And there is no doubt about it, Evelyn Salt kicks ass and the potential of her character is fantastic.In 2010, Jolie's spy thriller ""SALT"" became another dominating hit film in the box office for the actresss raking in over $293 million worldwide and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" will be released courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on December 21st.  And for those who love the film, will enjoy more of Evelyn Salt as you get three different versions of the film.""SALT"" is directed by Phillip Noyce (""The Patriot Games"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", ""The Bone Collector"") and features a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (""The Thomas Crown Affair"", ""Law Abiding Citizen"", ""Ultraviolet""), music by James Newton Howard (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fugitive"") and cinematography by Robert Elswith (""Duplicity"", ""There Will Be Blood"", ""Michael Clayton"" and ""Boogie Nights"").""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" comes with three different versions of the film.  While there will be two DVD releases of the film, one with the original theatrical edition and the other with a director's cut and extended edition.As for the Blu-ray release of ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"", It is important to note that there are three different versions of the film.  The original theatrical edition and the extended edition are literally two different films in which the story of both films tend to go on different paths right after Evelyn meets up with Orlov.The director's cut has a few slight modifications to the original theatrical edition with a voice over that changes the ending of the original theatrical version of the film.  So, in essence, each of the three versions of ""SALT"" have a different ending.VIDEO:""SALT"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The picture quality of ""SALT"" is absolutely fantastic.  ""SALT"" is a film that looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  The colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and plenty of detail galore.  The cinematography by Robert Elswit combined with the visual effects really make ""SALT"" look realistic.  From the scenes on the White House lawn to the visual effects to make New York look lively from high above to the detail of Angelina Jolie's hair and her teary eyes.I didn't detect any blurriness, compression artifacts, banding...no visual blemishes at all.  ""SALT"" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""SALT"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English - Audio Description Track Dolby Surround English Stereo.  Because this is an action film, you can expect a solid lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack.  From crowd ambiance, glass shattering, cars crashing into each other, bullets hitting metal,  bullets zipping to trains on the tracks and many instances of things blowing up, there is a good amount of sound being diverted to the surround channels and just enough LFE that makes ""SALT"" really envelop the soundscape in your viewing area.There is not one scene that I can say this is where the best sound is because these action sequences are so frequent and numerous that you can expect an active soundtrack throughout the film.Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music soundtrack coming from the front and center channels.  ""SALT"" features a wonderful lossless soundtrack that compliments its wonderful picture quality.SPECIAL FEATURES:""SALT"" comes with the following special features:* Added Footage Marker - A marker that is activated during the viewing of the film and points out the differences between the unrated director's cut and unrated extended cut as compared to the theatrical version of the film.* movieIQ - If you are watching ""SALT"" on a Blu-ray 2.0 player connected to the Internet, you can pull up cast information and other information about the film.* Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - While watching ""SALT"", you get a picture-in-picture sequence in which the filmmaker, producer or talent talk about the various scenes of the film and you get to see the behind-the-scenes making of various scenes from ""SALT"".* The Ultimate Female Action Hero - (8:04) Director Phillip Noyce, producers and cast talk about how Angelina Jolie is an awesome actress who is willing to take on fearless role.

Note: Do not watch this featurette before watching the movie as there are many spoilers.* Filmmakers' Commentary - Audio commentary by Director Phillip Noyce who talks about his father who was an Australian spy.  Noyce also talks about his love for creating a spy film and how the earlier script was much different than the finished film and how it was originally crafted for a male character.  Joey Rand (music editor) gives his commentary about the music of the film.* Unrated Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated director's cut of the film.* Unrated Extended Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated extended cut of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:A pulse-pounding, spy thriller with twists and turns from beginning to end, Angelina Jolie absolutely embodies the new line of action hero stars like Bond and Bourne.  ""SALT"" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.But there is so much that I loved about the film.  For one, it was great to see a female heroine (or is she a villain?) and Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!  According to director Phillip Noyce, Jolie wanted a Bond-like character and simply, the character of Evelyn Salt fit perfectly.  Also, a wonderful job by actors Liev Schreiber, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski.  But it's hard to talk about these characters without spoiling the film, also its even more difficult to even talk about the original theatrical version of the film now that the Blu-ray release has these different versions.  And dare I say, the director's cut and the very different extended version were much better than the original.So, I'm not going to even bother discussing what I liked about the original film as this is one of those rare moments for a Blu-ray review where the original theatrical edition may not mean as much as you may have a liking towards the other two versions of the films.  I have to admit that when I watched ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"", I figured that this release would have wonderful PQ and AQ, especially since it was an intense spy thriller with so many action scenes, that was a given.  But I was not expecting a film that would literally feature a different second half and become a whole new different story.  It was wonderfully done and to be truthful, I kind of wished that the extended version was the original theatrical version.  But still both this and the director's cut of the film were well-done and a major improvement over the original.According to director Philip Noyce, the change of endings was the filmmaker trying to keep the focus of who is the ultimate villain to one character than the other.  He enjoyed both versions, I enjoyed both versions and I have no doubt that the viewers will too. Unlike other films which have various versions included on a Blu-ray disc. typically they don't exactly add much to the film but in the case of ""SALT"", these three different versions of the film included are quite substantial.  But for me, the extended version literally ends with a bang and has a memorable shot of Evelyn Salt.  A shame the extended version was not used for the theatrical version as it would have been a classic shot.And just when you think you have watched all three films and that you are done, there is somewhat of a fourth way to watch the film in which you can watch the film but have a picture-in-picture segment on the making of ""SALT"". You also get audio commentary for each of the three films.Granted, it's the same commentary but with additional commentary supporting those differing scenes or added footage.  You also get a good amount of special features, especially an interesting featurette by former spies from the CIA and KGB who talk about how life really was for a spy plus other featurettes such as radio interview, visual effects making of, disguises of Evelyn Salt and more.  And last, for the videophiles and audiophiles, ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"" is fantastic!  Awesome PQ and AQ to literally round out this magnificent Blu-ray release.Overall, if you enjoyed ""SALT"", you're going to love ""SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition"".  Such a refreshing character and I am hoping for a sequel!Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: Awesome PQ/AQ/Special Features but you also get three versions of the films.  I am impressed by this release!!!!,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,10795,"['Move', 'James', 'Bond', 'Stand', 'aside', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Welcome', 'Evelyn', 'Salt.If', 'one', 'formula', 'Hollywood',

So a lot of bloody beatings and shootings, car chases and special effects, a hot babe who can beat up guys, and a lot of fake techno talk. The 'plot' is so absurd and implausible as to be funny in parts; something about Russian sleeper agents in the US, and absolutely everyone working for the US government eventually turns out to be one of them. Or something - they lost me on the details. Hasn't anyone told these people that the Cold War was over, er, some time ago?But viewers don't seem to care. From a business angle, this piece of dreck brought $300M in revenues against a budget of $100M for production. I find this offensive. In no other industry (ie, honest hardworking industry) could such an indifferently conceived product earn two hundred million in a year. Hey, following the porn model, why not just give up any pretense of a story and film pure violence for two hours? Sad commentary on the Hollywood business model.Now that I got that off my chest, Angelina is kind of fun in this movie, playing the James Bond instead of the James Bond chick. Pretty good for a scrawny 36 year old mother of six, although to keep her lips puffed up like that they must have brought in a 55 gallon drum of bee venom. Liev Schreiber is an excellent actor. And it was clever of her to steer the runaway police car by systematically tasering the driver; taser left to turn right, taser right to turn left, taser front to stop, taser back to accelerate.

But ""Salt"" actually exceeded my expectations. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a tough and smart CIA agent accused of being a secret mole working for Russian defectors and plotting to assassinate the president of Russia (during his visit to the U.S.), and later the President of the U.S. himself. Her superiors immediately try to apprehend her, but Salt escapes them and embarks upon an action-packed, car-smashing, stunt-driven chase thriller as she seeks to prove her innocense and wipe out her evil Russian accusers.But is Salt really innocent? Is she really a Russian spy, or are others within her agency the real spies? This rollercoaster ride of adventure and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end. In spite of the obvious holes in the plot and the implausible stunts, ""Salt"" delivers on action, suspense and entertainment, and Jolie plays the role superbly.

The disk has all three versions and lots of interesting extra features, including a commentary by Phillip Noyce, and interviews with real-life spies, such as the famous former Counterintelligence KGB General Oleg Kalugin, now an American citizen.""Salt"" is an enjoyable film, better, I say, than all Bourne films, or ""Mission Impossible"", with the possible exception of the 1996 one, directed by Brian de Palma, where Angelina Jolie's father plays, and also better than many James Bond films, with, perhaps, the exception of the 1963 ""From Russia with Love"", from which ""Salts"" borrows something - remember Colonel Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya ?Moles in the CIA (and FBI), ""sleepers"", ""illegals"" in dormant state waiting to be activated for sinister purposes against the West, Soviet/Russian (KGB, SVR, FSB) defectors after defectors ... all are true and not new (Kalugin confirms this) - see ""Telefon"" (1977, with Charles Bronson), ""The Fourth Protocol"" (1987, with Pierce Brosnan), ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006, also with Angelina Jolie), ""The Company"" (2007, TV with Michael Keaton).Angelina Jolie, Liev Schrieber, and Daniel Olbrychski do well, and, like many others, I liked watching them, but I have two serious problems with the plot.  Not so much the impossible acrobatics, escapes and infiltrations ... but the premise of the film itself:- How is it possible to depict (and make us believe that) The Secret Service is so ineffective ... Bystanders ... ?- The ""defector"".1. A Russian spy comes to the CIA and reveals top secrets about former Soviet, now Russian operations against the United States.  He even uncovers the identity of a mole inside CIA ranks.  OK - Good deeds !  But, if he is a genuine defector, why, after being interviewed, does he kill his CIA guards, and then escapes ?  Doing this only discredits his testimony.  That is not how a genuine defector behaves.2. If, on the other hand he is not a genuine defector, but an active enemy agent, someone who came to activate ""sleepers"", why does he have to come in and reveal everything to the CIA, including uncovering the identity of a top mole in the CIA, thus, gravely endangering the mission his agents (the sleepers) are to carry out ?  If he only needed to provide instructions to his undercover agents, he could have used other methods of communication.  This is not how an offensive (let us call him ""a non-genuine defector"") behaves.3. If, further, this was is a temporary defection, with the sole purpose of uncovering to the CIA the identity of a mole (the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of the film, but not the Extended version suggests this), than it was not at all necessary to reveal the rest of the plan to the CIA (that this mole, a Russian agent will soon attempt to kill ...), and, definitely, it was absolutely wrong for the defector to kill his guards and escape.  Credibility !So, bad logic. Am I wrong ?We, the viewers like thrillers, action, adventure, spy stuff (deception after deception, double-cross, double agents), but we also like solid, smart and plausible intelligence (brain, analytical) work behind the action - e.g. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" (1979, TV) and  ""Smiley's People"" (1982, TV), both with Alec Guiness.  Not too much ""intelligence"" work in ""Salt"", just a lot of (great !) action sequences ... there is too much Phillip Noyce expects us to accept, take for granted.On the positive side:  ""Salt"" may also be viewed as the soul-searching journey of a double-agent who struggles with the question: ""On which side am I ?"" or ""On which side should I be ?""  In the end, the agent decides where the allegiance should be placed, and choses the side who advocates morality and humanity.If you do not ask (too many) questions, ""Salt"" is definitely enjoyable, and the Blu-ray disk is great.",3,"Enjoyable to Watch, but Hardly Believable - 3.5/5.0",1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,4013,"['enjoy', 'spy', 'films', 'remember', 'having', 'liked', '1994', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'starring', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'also', 'directed', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'decided', 'see', 'Salt', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'Amazon', 'disk', 'three', 'versions', 'lots', 'interesting', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'interviews', 'real-life', 'spies', 'such', 'famous', 'former', 'Counterintelligence', 'KGB', 'General', 'Oleg', 'Kalugin', 'now', 'American', 'citizen', 'Salt', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'better', 'say', 'Bourne', 'films', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'possible', 'exception', '1996', 'one', 'directed', 'Brian', 'de', 'Palma', 'where', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'father', 'plays', 'also', 'better', 'many', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'perhaps', 'exception', '1963', 'Russia', 'Love', 'Salts', 'something', 'remember', 'Colonel', 'Rosa', 'Klebb', 'played', 'Lotte', 'Lenya', 'Moles', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'sleepers', 'illegals', 'dormant', 'state', 'waiting', 'be', 'activated', 'sinister', 'purposes', 'West', 'Soviet/Russian', 'KGB', 'SVR', 'FSB', 'defectors', 'defectors', 'are', 'true', 'not', 'new', 'Kalugin', 'confirms', 'see', 'Telefon', '1977', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Fourth', 'Protocol', '1987', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Good', 'Shepherd', '2006', 'also', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Company', '2007', 'TV', 'Michael', 'Keaton', '.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Daniel', 'Olbrychski', 'do', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'liked', 'watching', 'have', 'two', 'serious', 'problems', 'plot', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'impossible', 'acrobatics', 'escapes', 'infiltrations', 'premise', 'film', 'How', 'possible', 'depict', 'make', 'believe', 'Secret', 'Service', 'so', 'ineffective', 'Bystanders', 'defector', '.1', 'Russian', 'spy', 'CIA', 'reveals', 'top', 'secrets', 'former', 'Soviet', 'now', 'Russian', 'operations', 'United', 'States', 'even', 'identity', 'mole', 'inside', 'CIA', 'OK', 'Good', 'deeds', 'genuine', 'defector', 'why', 'being', 'interviewed', 'kill', 'CIA', 'guards', 'then', 'escapes', 'Doing', 'only', 'testimony', 'not', 'how', 'genuine', 'defector', 'behaves.2', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'genuine', 'defector', 'active', 'enemy', 'agent', 'someone', 'who', 'came', 'activate', 'sleepers', 'why', 'have', 'come', 'reveal', 'everything', 'CIA', 'including', 'uncovering', 'identity', 'top', 'mole', 'CIA', 'thus', 'gravely', 'endangering', 'mission', 'agents', 'sleepers', 'are', 'carry', 'out', 'only', 'needed', 'provide', 'instructions', 'undercover', 'agents', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'other', 'methods', 'communication', 'not', 'how', 'offensive', 'let', 'call', 'non-genuine', 'defector', 'behaves.3', 'further', 'was', 'temporary', 'defection', 'sole', 'purpose', 'uncovering', 'CIA', 'identity', 'mole', 'Theatrical', 'Director', 'Cut', 'versions', 'film', 'not', 'Extended', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'reveal', 'rest', 'plan', 'CIA', 'mole', 'Russian', 'agent', 'will', 'soon', 'attempt', 'kill', 'definitely', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'defector', 'kill', 'guards', 'escape', 'Credibility', 'So', 'bad', 'logic', 'Am', 'wrong', 'viewers', 'thrillers', 'action', 'adventure', 'spy', 'stuff', 'deception', 'deception', 'double-cross', 'double', 'agents', 'also', 'solid', 'smart', 'plausible', 'intelligence', 'brain', 'analytical', 'work', 'action', 'e.g', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', '1979', 'TV', 'Smiley', 'People', '1982', 'TV', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'intelligence', 'work', 'Salt', 'just', 'lot', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'too', 'much', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'accept', 'take', 'granted.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Salt', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'soul-searching', 'journey', 'double-agent', 'who', 'question', 'side', 'am', 'side', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'agent', 'where', 'allegiance', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'side', 'who', 'morality', 'humanity.If', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'Salt', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'Blu-ray', 'disk', 'great']",N/A

I made a few comments on their reviews to post under the bluray edition and not the reg. DVD but guess what, Amazon is mixing the reviews from each edition. Yes, when you read a review on it's own, it will tell you on the right side which edition it is. Now, these reviews from other editions are reflected on this edition? Not cool.On to the review of the Spec. Edition I saw.I will admit that when I saw the trailers I said, ""Why is she so thin?"" and ""I'm not sure if I'll see this.""Common complaints are that, ""How is a 100lb anorexic woman taking on multiple armed guards and doing all these amazing things?"" and I have to agree. THAT part was just too much for me. Being a past martial arts student, my sensei would teach different students how to protect themselves by the basics but then would take some students that were smaller or very large and teach them alt. ways to survive/fight based off their particular differences or limitations. There is no way she would be landing these blows and doing any real damage. So...fight choreography gets a big thumbs down.The misleading trailer made it appear that in the beginning Salt is told she is a secret spy and goes on the run immediately and it made it look like she was innocent and was running to clear her name. The edition I saw (Extended edition) was a very different story line. I won't post spoilers but you know very early if she is a spy or not. Why she would run if innocent?

It's also one of these post-cold war movies where  Russia and America are still locked into the mutual destruction thing.

But wait, she was originally brainwashed (trained) to be a sleeper agent for Russia and was awakened in the US by the capture of her trainer during a questioning period. Well, she then reverted back to her Russian training and become a potential assassinator of the president of the US. Well, this story had more twists and turns than the Mississippi River and I just lost interest in this bizarre  and impossible fantasy spy adventure. It's a high adventure action flick and some of the stunts are really amazing and will hold your attention. Likewise, there's a lot of bullets flying, death and destruction.

We've seen the likes of this before, and usually there's some redemptive qualities that help make the level of violence more palatable.  In this case the female protagonist Evelyn Salt proves to be a cold blooded emotionless killer, and we see quite a trail of bodies in her wake.  The plot is quite suspenseful, because we're never entirely sure what side she and her surrounding cast are on.  The notion of sleeper agents is particularly interesting, but there are a few big holes in the story (e.g. why does Olsov go to CIA headquarters to blow Salt's cover?  Why doesn't she seem to know what he is talking about, but then cooperate fully with his plan?).

1247631,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B0021L8V0M,Graham,"[2, 3]","Salt is a Bourne film on speed -- that's the best way to describe it. Evelyn Salt, as portrayed by Angelina Jolie, is a super-spy who spends the vast majority of the movie running, jumping, fighting, blowing stuff up, and generally causing all sorts of really cool looking mayhem. This is an action movie, through and through. The suspension of disbelief is mandatory here, because without it the audience won't last more than 15 minutes. Salt tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who is set up (or is she?) by a mysterious Russian agent. According to him, Salt is in fact a Russian spy planning to assassinate the Russian president, providing Russia with provocation to launch their own attacks on the United States. Convoluted? Sure. Ridiculous? Maybe. However, once Jolie launches into action, the film never stops for a breather and what follows are some of the best action sequences in recent memory.The fact that Salt succeeds despite a fairly ludicrous central plot is a testament to the prowess of Angelina Jolie. With the Tomb Raider films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Wanted, and now Salt, Jolie has proven to be not only one of the biggest movie stars on the planet, but perhaps it's biggest action star as well. The fact that we are talking about a woman who probably tips the scales at 115 pounds is a testament to the charisma and power that Jolie conveys onscreen. You just believe that she could take on two armed secret service agents in a narrow hallway and leave them both unconscious. Angelina Jolie is one of the very few true movie stars left, and Salt would not work without her. Liev Shreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the agents assigned to catch Salt and both do a predictably good job. Shreiber, in particular, has really come into his own lately and it's nice to see him working with good material after the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine.Aside from the breakneck pace and star power of Jolie, the greatest thing that Salt has going for it is the mystery of Evelyn Salt's true intentions. Is she really a Russian spy? Or is she playing both sides? Just who is she working for? The screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right up to the finale. Yes, the screenplay can get a bit ridiculous, but that's par for the course in this type of film. It should be stressed that this is not Syriana, or even a Bourne film. Phillip Noyce previously brought us both Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger and this time around he largely ignores the political machinations and double-crosses of the Jack Ryan films for a more action-focused entry. Nevertheless, the pedigree is there and Salt remains a damn fine political thriller. Noyce takes it to the next level, a level filled with more explosions, more car chases, and more hand-t0-hand combat. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea that's fine, but for the rest of us, this is the action movie of the summer, thus far. Enjoy Salt for what it is.

Engaging from beginning to end. Angelina Jolie is as good here as she was in the TOMB RAIDER movies, which is very impressive. There's plenty of suspense and twists & turns. The ending will shock you. Sort of like a female version of MINORITY REPORT, starring Tom Cruise, who was originally attatched to star, but he withdrew saying that his the character was too much like Ethan Hunt from the MISSION: Impossible movies, and he was right. But Ms. Jolie manages to make the character her very own. Well-written script. Had I written it, though, I would have deleted the misuse of God's name (ie. God followed by a mild profanity), as I feel it is blasphemous. Plenty of action and suspense. I recommend it. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG. A sequel looks like F-U-N.Review Of SALT- Director's CutThe Director's Cut of SALT is a bit longer than the theatrical cut, with some additional flashback sequences cut from the Theatrical Version, some more violence, and an entirely different end for the President and Michael. Good fun, though I think that the added voiceover at the end implying Salt's death could just be a cover for a possible sequel. I prefer the open ending of the theatrical version.

She doesn't give an ef about style points. In combat, her application of Muay Thai and Krav Maga allows her to dispose of her opponents directly and viciously and often permanently. Evelyn Salt is a highly skilled, highly lethal CIA operative. When she's set up and fingered as a Russian sleeper agent, her immediate concern is for her husband's safety. Evelyn Salt goes on the lam, and so re-enforces the accusation placed against her. The CIA goes on the warpath. But so does Evelyn Salt.Decades out of relevance, the Cold War strikes again. Somewhere, John Le Carr&eacute; and Robert Ludlum are smiling. SALT is an engrossing espionage thriller and so twisty it had me half-convinced that I'm a Russian mole. It's not long before you start questioning Evelyn Salt's every move. Who is Evelyn Salt? What's her true agenda? Where is her allegiance? You don't learn for certain until deep into the film, when Salt is put in a position to prevent a nuclear holocaust... or trigger it.This is old hat for Angelina Jolie. Her mojo is such that she carries the film effortlessly. I'm not even that surprised to learn that SALT, in its early stages, intended to feature Tom Cruise as ""Evan Salt."" Jolie belongs to an elite club. She's one of those very few actresses who is sexy, can act, and do some serious buttkicking. Off the top of my head, there are Jolie, Yeoh, Jovovich, Hamilton, and Weaver - and all have presence. Jolie has great acting chops. She commits to her role, not only tonally, but physically. Although, fine, I don't think she quite pulls off her disguise as a Russian officer. Still, it's an impressive sight watching a seriously pisssed Salt embark on a killing spree. Let me say, though, that it's just really wrong how, from the back seat of a speeding car, a captive Salt remote controls the cop driver thru rampant application of her taser (and yet I couldn't stop laughing). And like Yeoh and Jovovich, Jolie relishes performing her own stunts, so she's no wilting lily. Speaking of stunts, the most spectacular one involves Salt's various insane leaps onto the roofs of various trucks criss-crossing on the freeways. My jaw got all agape.Don't mean to dis the menfolk. Liev Schreiber lends gravitas as Salt's CIA friend and colleague who reluctantly joins in the (wo)man hunt. Dude is a good actor and makes a good foil for Jolie. Meanwhile, Chiwetel Ejiofor - playing a by-the-books government agent - becomes the Tommy Lee Jones to Jolie's Harrison Ford. SALT is more action-packed than it is cerebral. More BOURNE IDENTITY than THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. And with the cliffhanger ending positioning SALT to be another film franchise for Jolie, it looks like Tom Cruise made a booboo opting out.",4,the truth of Evelyn Salt,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2829,"['Evelyn', 'Salt', ""n't"", 'fancy', 'high-kicking', 'heroine', 'whatever', 'get', 'job', 'done', ""n't"", 'give', 'ef', 'style', 'points', 'combat', 'application', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'Krav', 'Maga', 'dispose', 'opponents', 'directly', 'viciously', 'often', 'permanently', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'highly', 'skilled', 'highly', 'lethal', 'CIA', 'operative', 'When', 'set', 'up', 'fingered', 'Russian', 'sleeper', 'agent', 'immediate', 'concern', 'husband', 'safety', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'lam', 'so', 're-enforces', 'accusation', 'placed', 'CIA', 'warpath', 'so', 'Evelyn', 'Salt.Decades', 'relevance', 'Cold', 'War', 'strikes', 'again', 'Somewhere', 'John', 'Le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'are', 'smiling', 'SALT', 'engrossing', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'so', 'twisty', 'had', 'half-convinced', ""'m"", 'Russian', 'mole', 'not', 'long', 'start', 'questioning', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'move', 'Who', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'What', 'true', 'agenda', 'Where', 'allegiance', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'certain', 'deep', 'film', 'when', 'Salt', 'put', 'position', 'prevent', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'trigger', 'it.This', 'old', 'hat', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'mojo', 'such', 'film', 'effortlessly', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'surprised', 'learn', 'SALT', 'early', 'stages', 'intended', 'feature', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Evan', 'Salt', 'Jolie', 'elite', 'club', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'actresses', 'who', 'sexy', 'can', 'act', 'do', 'serious', 'buttkicking', 'top', 'head', 'are', 'Jolie', 'Yeoh', 'Jovovich', 'Hamilton', 'Weaver', 'have', 'presence', 'Jolie', 'great', 'acting', 'chops', 'role', 'not', 'only', 'tonally', 'physically', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'disguise', 'Russian', 'officer', 'Still', 'impressive', 'sight', 'watching', 'seriously', 'pisssed', 'Salt', 'embark', 'killing', 'spree', 'Let', 'say', 'though', 'just', 'really', 'wrong', 'how', 'back', 'seat', 'speeding', 'car', 'captive', 'Salt', 'remote', 'cop', 'driver', 'thru', 'rampant', 'application', 'taser', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'Yeoh', 'Jovovich', 'Jolie', 'performing', 'own', 'stunts', 'wilting', 'lily', 'Speaking', 'stunts', 'most', 'spectacular', 'one', 'Salt', 'various', 'insane', 'leaps', 'roofs', 'various', 'trucks', 'criss-crossing', 'freeways', 'jaw', 'got', 'agape.Do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'dis', 'menfolk', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'gravitas', 'Salt', 'CIA', 'friend', 'colleague', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'wo', 'man', 'hunt', 'Dude', 'good', 'actor', 'good', 'foil', 'Jolie', 'Meanwhile', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'playing', 'by-the-books', 'government', 'agent', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Jolie', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'SALT', 'more', 'action-packed', 'cerebral', 'More', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'THE', 'SPY', 'WHO', 'CAME', 'IN', 'FROM', 'THE', 'COLD', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'positioning', 'SALT', 'be', 'film', 'franchise', 'Jolie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'made', 'booboo', 'opting', 'out']",N/A

When she is released, we are told that she has been working as a top agent for the CIA. We are also told that had a certain man not caused a lot of publicity about her capture, the CIA would not have tried to get her released. She hears this from her CIA boss.Two years later, when she is married to the man who helped get her released, a top Russian agent comes to the CIA claiming that he wants to defect. He reveals that Russians want to kill the Russian president while he is visiting the US and participating in the funeral service for the American Vice President. He says that Salt is the Russian agent assigned to do the murder. Government agents try to arrest her, but she escapes. We begin to see that she has many skills. She tries to locate her husband who does not answer any of her calls. We see a long and exciting chase by government agents after Salt.The film raises the questions: What happened to Salt's husband?

But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clich&eacute;s that come with the genre.Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator?The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.But good is always the victor in these films.

The action in ""Salt"" is so non-stop, so relentless, so slam-bang-in-your-face, that the film moves at warp speed and it's over almost before you realize it.  That the plot is patently ridiculous somehow doesn't seem to matter very much.  This movie is meant to be pure fun, and on that score, it delivers.Jolie plays Evelyn Salt (it's interesting that this role was originally written for a male actor, but Jolie proves she is more than able to handle it), a CIA operative married to a German scientist who specializes in all kinds of deadly spiders, who managed to get her out of a North Korean prison where she is being gruesomely tortured as the film opens.  But it turns out she may or may not be a Russian sleeper agent who is scheduled to go into action as soon as some very nasty stuff hits the fan; specifically, the assassinations of both the Russian and American presidents, and the detonation of a nuclear bomb or two.Salt's cover is blown (maybe) and she protests she was set up, but since nobody believes her, she's off and running in some really exciting chase sequences.  Jolie actually did some of her own stunts in this movie, although not the more dangerous ones such as jumping from the top of one speeding truck to another.  The real fun in this film comes from the fact that we can't really tell who Salt is.  Is she an American agent, or Russian, or Russian pretending to be American, or American pretending to be Russian?  By the end of the film we still don't know, but we know one thing: the way this film ends, a sequel is probably already on the storyboards.All of the actors give creditable performances, but Jolie's performance is what really makes you want to see this film more than once.  Tabloid gossip aside, she's a damn good actress, and she totally throws herself into this movie, literally and figuratively.  Tune in next summer (hopefully) for the next exciting episode.UPDATE 4/4/11:I just watched the DVD with all three versions of the film (theatrical release, director's cut and extended cut), and am wondering why in the world didn't the studio release the extended cut in the theaters?  It's a totally different ending, which I'm darned if I'm giving away, except to say that it's much more satisfying and makes for a vastly better movie overall.You can choose your version simply by going to the DVD menu, click on Play Movie, and then select whichever of the three you want.

1247668,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B0021L8V0M,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[4, 5]","The latest spy thriller to hit the box office, 'Salt', starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, written by Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland, and directed by Philip Noyce, is a cat and mouse game with a plot straight from the good ol' days of James Bond that does what Bond used to do- entertain you.The movie opens two years prior to current events with CIA operative Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being interrogated in a North Korean prison.  She's released in a prisoner exchange- against standard spy protocol- not so much at the behest of the CIA but the man who's her current cover assignment and love interest, Krause, a German arachnologist (spider biologist).Fast forward to present times and on the day of her anniversary Salt and her supervisor Tom Winter (Schreiber) interview a 'walk-in'- a spy who literally hands themselves over- in the presence of Peabody (Ejiofor), from Internal Affairs.  This man, Orlov, spins a tale about the KA-12 Project: Russian sleeper agents trained since childhood and integrated throughout the United States in preparation for 'Day X', the deadliest covert strike against US Imperialism imaginable- beginning with the assassination of the Russian President on American soil.  The assassin's name... Evelyn Salt.Orlov manages a bloody escape from custody, placing Salt squarely in the CIA's sights.  Now suspected of being a sleeper agent and her husband gone missing, Salt engineers her own escape and heads to New York where the Russian president will be appearing at a funeral service.  Despite Peabody and Winter leading the hunt, she manages to infiltrate the church.  Yet even after surrendering to the police she once again slips her captors, leading to even more questions: is Salt really a Russian sleeper agent?  Why has her husband disappeared?  Who are the KA-12 agents...?The performances are pretty solid throughout; Jolie's desperation and determination, Schreiber's professional calm and Ejiofor's active disbelief all come off good- though Ejiofor sometimes looks constipated instead of cynical.  The pacing is good, too- with slices of Salt's life interspersed through the action to show us what she's fighting for.  And it's always good to see veteran actor Andre Braugher in anything, but like Laurence Fishburne in Predators, there wasn't anything for him to do other than collect a check.  The action sequences are impressive and inventive- Jolie gets down and dirty in this one and handles herself well (my personal faves were her takedowns of the two main bad guys and her creative use of a taser to escape the police).  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of earlier Bond films, or even MacGyver but it's all part of the fun.

Certainly, this applies to just about every genre in the industry (save for anything golf-related), but poli-thrillers have the benefit of being centered around an aspect of life that simply gets audiences riled up by defailt:  That is, the innards of modern day politics.  It's an active panic trigger of a concept that comes with no manual, simply because most directors and screenwriters know precisely what to do with it.I don't really know where Phillip Noyce went wrong with Salt.  It could've been enticing enough to encourage me to keep guessing HOW it would end, as opposed to WHEN.  Unfortunately, there's something inherently wrong with this movie's methods of scheming us into believing that anything of importance is up its sleeves, when there simply isn't.Salt's depth lies in Jolie, who flourished as an actress years ago and no one seems to have caught on quite yet.  Benefiting from her committed performance, it's easy to stare into the movie's murky premise and see something substantial, only to soon realize they were simple mirages that the writers likely acknowledged, but failed to incorporate into the story, as the film progresses onwards without them.Salt denies any real association with the complexities of espionage and massive political struggles, instead choosing to be kinetic and action-oriented, at the expense of being predictable.  It's a common trade-off, attempting to compensate for banality with the talent of their choreographers and intricate wire work, and it usually works.Trouble is, Salt's uninspired nature is a disease that seems to have seeped into every aspect of the film, and Angelina isn't dynamic enough to save everything.  Chase scenes revolve around jumping aimlessly from one vehicle to another in identical fashion, and the fight sequences are tame and brief.Everything about Salt seems to be determined to deny itself release from mediocrity; truth be told, there is potential here.  What could have been a half-decent Bourne clone is instead limited in scope, bland in visual richness, and dependent upon the charisma of Jolie, who cannot seem to encourage her supporting cast to follow in her wake, and it's not like Jolie is alone in the dark with amateur performers, either.

1247678,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0021L8V0M,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 4]","As I've said several times before, the sub-genre of spy films (or espionage/spy thrillers as they're sometimes referred) has long been a popular well for Hollywood to draw from for inspiration and box office success. Typically these films have centered on a tough-as-nails male action hero type, many times with a strong desire for women and specific types of alcoholic beverages. In 2010, that all changed with the release of the action-packed thrill ride ""Salt"" starring Angelina Jolie (""Wanted"") in the title role.""Salt"" chronicles the espionage powder keg that explodes when CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a double agent for Russia tasked with assassinating the President of the United States. With her loyalty in question, her career in jeopardy, and the life she's known being turned on its ear; Salt will do whatever it takes to clear her name, reclaim her life, and prevent an international incident from occurring before time runs out.Let me start by saying this: leave it to Angelina Jolie to be the first woman to successfully infiltrate this predominantly male headlined sub-genre of film. Not only that, but with her acting prowess, determination and physicality, be able to convincingly portray a character that can stand toe-to-toe with Bond and Bourne. Of course, this shouldn't be that surprising given that Angelina has proven time and again through various roles that there is not a single genre in which she cannot find success.As the character of Evelyn Salt, Angelina is truly run through a veritable gauntlet of physical and emotional tests. In one scene she can be scaling the side of a very tall building (a stunt she performed herself) or witnessing a horrible act as she tries to remain stoic, but a subtly quivering lip belies her inner turmoil. Or desperately trying to convince those around her of the truth; no matter what the scene calls for Angelina always delivers to perfection.I don't think there are too many other actresses out there, if any, that could have believably pulled off such a demanding role that is rife with intensity, duplicity, drama, and action. Sure several actresses could have handled some of the facets of the character, but all of them? In this I believe Angelina stands alone, and that is why I believe her to be probably the best, and certainly the most versatile, actress of her generation.An interesting side note for the character is that originally Tom Cruise (""Mission: Impossible"") was attached to the role, but reportedly dropped out to film the romantic action comedy ""Knight and Day"". Thus, prompting the role to be rewritten from a male to a female, supposedly with Angelina in mind from then on.Anyway, alongside Angelina are two very talented actors in the primary supporting roles, Liev Schreiber (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") and Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Four Brothers"").Liev plays a fellow CIA agent of Salt's named Ted Winter, and is the only person at the agency who seems to believe that she is innocent of the accusations against her. Liev's character is a mixture of the typical no-nonsense agent, but with a healthy sense of humor and a protective, brotherly relationship with Salt. Aside from those character traits, Liev also imbues the character with charm and an underlying sense that he will do whatever it takes to protect Salt whether she's innocent or guilty.All together Liev's performance makes his character much more memorable than one would expect from such a role. Plus, the early scenes between him and Salt bantering back and forth are enjoyable to watch.As for Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays a government operative named Peabody who unlike Winter is not inclined to simply believe in Salt's innocence, despite her years of service to the red, white, and blue. For the most part, Ejiofor plays the role by the book as the clich&eacute;d government stooge that is blind to anything except the evidence on display. Even with this fairly one-dimensional character, Chiwetel still manages to make his scenes pop, thanks entirely to his charismatic disposition.One more bit of casting I would like to discuss before moving on, and this one in particular struck me as odd when watching this film. Why, oh why did Andre Braugher (""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"") sign on to the most thankless role of Secretary of Defense? With an actor of his caliber and credibility, one would expect that he signed on for the role due to it being such a good character. However, he's given nothing to do other than run around in one scene and hand phones to people, all the while saying only a sentence of dialogue.Seriously, this is a role that should have been handled by some no-name actor or even someone like Cuba Gooding, Jr. who has been relegated to the realm of Direct-to-DVD. Wasting the talent of Andre Braugher on a role such as this is completely mind-boggling and somewhat insulting to his long-lasting career. But, overall this was a minor issue and I digress.Of course the cast would be nothing without the script written by Kurt Wimmer (""A Perfect Getaway""), who has proven yet again to be a terrific storyteller. Loaded with twists and turns, gripping action set pieces, and engaging drama, the story for ""Salt"" is entertaining from start to finish.Understandably with a movie like this one has to be careful in how much is revealed, because the risk of spoiling is incredibly high. So, the only other thing I will say about this film's story is this: at the end of the movie, I guarantee you will be left begging for more.Now I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the other major contributor to this movie's success, director Phillip Noyce (""Clear and Present Danger""). With a movie so jam-packed with fast-paced, hard-hitting action scenes one would expect the movie to have been directed by someone more oriented with the action genre. Not to say that Phillip Noyce is unfamiliar with action scenes, it's just his films aren't generally so heavy in this area. Even so, he directs the pulse-pounding action with as sure a hand as he does during the quieter, more dramatic moments.Also, Noyce's excellent directing and pacing of the film ensured that the story was provided plenty of breathing room to unfold naturally; that way it wouldn't seem as if the story was there to serve the action rather than the other way around. And the use of flashbacks, which can backfire for some films, was perfect for providing character development and context, while breaking up the monotony of linear storytelling. It's no wonder why Phillip Noyce is heralded as a master of the espionage thriller.All in all, ""Salt"" is a thoroughly entertaining movie, filled to the brim with excitement and intrigue. This film and its star, Angelina Jolie, prove that they belong in the pantheon of spy thrillers and hopefully we haven't seen the last of Evelyn Salt.""Salt"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",4,"Move Over Bond and Bourne, Salt Has Arrived...",1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,6916,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'sub-genre', 'spy', 'films', 'thrillers', ""'re"",

Almost non-stop action--car chases, run from the CIA, lots of shooting and fighting, and a few twists and turns.Evelyn Salt is a CIA intelligence officer.  She is married to a German National who has easy access to move freely, in and out of Korea.  She is about to go home to celebrate her wedding anniversary when a Russian defector shows up at the office, telling a story.  He says he is dying of cancer and has nothing to lose.  He explains that many years ago, the Russians developed a plot to ruin America, the ""KA"" program (""kill America"", I guess).  They trained many, many children and then substituted them into American life as ""sleepers"", to participate in a well-orchestrated plot at a much later time.  When the time is right, these children would be activated.  The one assigned to kill the Russian president was Evelyn Salt!As Evelyn is interrogating the defector, the other agents are running a body scan on him which indicates he is telling the truth.  Uh oh.  They begin to look at Evelyn a little differently.  Meanwhile, she is concerned about her husband's safety and takes off to find him.  This begins Evelyn's chase and a ton of action.Is ""our"" Evelyn Salt really Agent Chenkov?  Or is someone setting her up?  Watch and see.  I think you will really enjoy this movie if you like action.BTW--Yes, there is a lot of BS in the chase scenes, where Evelyn would likely have been killed in real life many times over, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun!  They get up and keep on going--they are the ONE person in the whole world who could survive or could achieve something.  Get real--that's what you go to see--the so-called impossible stuff!

1247682,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B0021L8V0M,Kay Shackleton,"[4, 7]","You would think that having a beautiful, 28 year-old Russian woman caught by the FBI for spying for mother Russia would be the ultimate movie stunt for the release of Angelina Jolie's new film ""Salt."" But the arrest of stunning Anna Chapman was a mere coincidence rolled into a Movie Studio's dream.But unfortunately, it takes more than that to make a film a big hit. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA operative living in the Washington D.C. On what seems to be an average day, Evelyn's life is turned upside down when a Russian agent defects and declares that Evelyn is a Russian spy poised to kill the visiting Russian President. The rest of the film is one action sequence after another, and Evelyn's devotion to her country seems to be at risk.What ""Salt,"" loses on most though is an audience eager for such a release. For the best comparison, ""Salt,"" is a movie depiction of a comic book character without the advantage of having the comic book world anxious to see its story brought to film. Many of the scenes are outlandishly laughable, yet do we laugh when Batman dons his cape or when Superman flies in the air? No, of course not, these stories have been in our culture for years and Evelyn Salt is yet an infant in comparison.Angelina Jolie does a great job as the central figure and Liev Schreiber continues to prove himself as Salt's CIA partner. If you are eager to see a film with a lot of action with a good cast, this is a great two hour diversion. And if you give it a try, you might find that Evelyn Salt is a character comparable to other comic icons like Wonder Woman, yet with a distinctive flavor of her own.For more reviews and film industry news see Kay's articles at: [...]-Kay Shackleton is a film historian with special focus on the Silent Film Era, see her work at [...]",4,Want to spice up your summer?

Welcome to Salt, from Salt's Russian training to her relationship with Orlov and her fellow assassins to a tepid to nonexistent chemistry with her husband - this movie lacks punch.

Heck, I'd take Liam Neeson in Taken with all of his technique and sheer heart - natural talent over this tale which I hate to say really doesn't seem real. There's no character development for starters, you are talking about one dimensional characters - we're not even beginning to touch on the 'torture' scene which is laughable at best. Oh and exchange of Salt to the US? Come on now, what foreign country is going to trade up someone whom they think is a spy?? I don't care if another country offered the US the Lindberg baby or Jimmy Hoffa - we would NEVER and I mean NEVER EVER give up a spy for either of those two.

It takes a while to figure this out and you get to see Angelina go through scores of physical gyrations and stunts unlike anything her other cartoon character, Laura Kroft, ever achieved. For instance, at various times in this chase-filled film, Jolie:-- Scales skinny window sills of a high rise D.C. apartment building with her dog in the backpack -- in her bare feet.-- Escapes capture by jumping from a freeway overpass onto a semi truck moving at freeway speed.-- Jumps from that semi to a similarly haulin' gasoline tanker with a skinny grated deck.-- Jumps to another vehicle moving at highway speed and hangs onto the edge by one hand before righting herself.All this without a scratch or without mussing her makeup or hair. Later on:-- She takes on at least 50 CIA agents in several combat scenes, without nary a scratch.-- In purusit of the U.S. president, she repeatedly jumps downward in an elevator shaft, 3-4 floors at a time, always landing perfectly on little triangular steel ledges.-- She survives and walks away from a car crash when the vehicle goes off the edge of a freeway, plummets 20-30 feet, and lands atop a bunch of other vehicles.She walks away from all this without a scratch. Oh yes, one time she cut herself. Later on, she destroys the funeral of the vice-president to the chagrin of 500 security agents and, to top that, saves the world from nuclear annihilation. If none of this is enough for you, in the final scene she takes a dive from a moving helicopter into a freezing ocean without a parachute or even her shirt, makes it to shore, then runs off into a fade to black screen, apparently setting the scene for ""Salt II: The Return of Wonder Woman.""To say this film defeats the concept of suspended disbelief is like saying the Hindenburg had a little accident.

1247714,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0021L8V0M,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","Angelina Jolie has definitely reached star status. She makes films that have a certain cerebral quality that the critics enjoy but she remains true to her fans, those that bought repeat tickets to see TOMB RAIDER, by making action films as well. And if nothing else SALT is a non stop action thrill ride that those fans will love but with enough story to satisfy the critics.Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who as the film starts has been captured by the North Koreans and then traded due to the insistence of her boyfriend, an arachnologist (he studies spiders) she was involved with. The two marry and Evelyn continues working for the CIA without his apparent knowledge.Move forward two years and Evelyn is about to go home for the night. But she and her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) are stopped before going to interrogate a man who has just turned himself in saying he was a Russian spy and knows of a big event about to take place. As she interrogates the man he tells her about a spy movement begun during the cold war when deep undercover spies were placed throughout the U.S. to be activated years later. That time is now. Viewing his statement as nothing more than talk, she begins to leave until he tells her the name of the spy who will assassinate the Russian president: Evelyn Salt.The team goes on high alert and Evelyn is place in a holding cell till they can sort through it all. The Russian is being escorted to a cell of his own but kills his guards and escapes. Fearful of what might happen to her husband, Evelyn breaks out on her own after a creative escape. She has to find him and protect him.While Ted continues to defend Salt, Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (a sort of internal affairs agent) leads the chase to bring Salt back into custody and prevent what appears to be a legitimate threat to the Russian president. Set to deliver the eulogy for the recently deceased Vice President, the assassination could result in a world war.Salt is tracked to her apartment where she finds the remains of an abduction of her husband, her worst fears come to pass. She barely makes it out before the CIA comes crashing in but once she hits the streets they follow. A sequence involving Salt jumping from the top of one semi-truck to another makes for one of the best chase scenes filmed in some time.Salt makes her escape, changes her look and begins preparing...to assassinate the Russian president! This is where the film brings on a fantastic twist. Where we would normally think that since this is Jolie she has to be innocent, we're suddenly wondering if she really could be the spy they think she is, an assassin. And when she causes panic and blows up the floor of the church where the Vice President's funeral is taking place, bringing the Russian president down a floor and into her gun sights, who knows if she is innocent of guilty?But long viewing film fans will figure out pieces of the puzzle before the last minutes of the film. As Salt continues on her path, reuniting with the Russian agent we saw her interrogate, more deep cover spies are revealed. It seems there was more to this story. Perhaps hundreds of these spies were placed long ago and now the plan is to turn them lose in an attempt to destroy the United States. Will Salt be the one to bring this plan to its ultimate goal or is she really trying to stop it before it begins?You'll have to watch to find out in a movie that has the feel of a roller coaster ride, swinging you this way and that until you roll into the station. The action is non stop, enhanced by both fantastic stunt work and a fast paced musical score that adds to the mix.Jolie does a great job here and should win over new fans. She offers both a tender side to the character as she worries about her husband and a killer side that plots out the destruction of those set in her sights. Best of all she switches those emotions without words but with acting, a tough job to accomplish.

1247716,APMKMM6284FH4,B0021L8V0M,Matt,"[2, 3]","I would like to talk to you about a little movie called Salt. Oh where do I begin? Let me first start with the title. I think this title is stupid. You think the title is stupid. I realize that there are people in this crazy world whose surname is synonymous with a vital chemical compound, just like there are people named ""Jane Water"" or ""Peter Vitamin C."" However, a good movie title it does not make. Is it supposed to be some kind of play-on-words that I'm missing? Like ""salt"" of the earth (which would make no sense) or ""salt"" in the wound (which makes slightly more sense maybe)?Anyway, Salt stars Angelina Jolie, she of the strange facial amalgamation of angular and puffy, as CIA operative Evelyn Salt (ugh) who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. That is pretty much the whole plot of the movie, sorry for not giving you a SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the film basically revolves around the question of ""Is she or isn't she?"" set into the framework of chase sequences and obligatory, balletic beat downs/gun battles that you expect from a summer action vehicle. In that aspect, Salt doesn't disappoint. The action sequences are thrilling, if not totally original. They do manage to strain at the limits of believability without crossing them, which is really the goal of any action movie of this type.That being said, Salt does have a couple of major flaws that, when combined, prove too much. The first problem is Ms. Jolie herself. Now, calm down, let me explain myself. Angelina is a badass. I totally buy into her killing black op mercenaries with her bare hands. She exudes such power, confidence and badassery that she should have been in The Expendables instead of Randy Couture. But because of that, I've always had a problem with her when she has to play vulnerable. A critical aspect of the film is Salt's love for her husband and her need to protect him. It drives the action and is pretty much the entire basis for the movie. So it's unfortunate that Jolie and August Diehl have all the onscreen chemistry of a cardboard cut-out and an inanimate carbon rod. Since Diehl's total screen time is about 10 minutes, I'm afraid most of the blame has to go on Jolie. Even when she is talking about him or begging her now-suspicious CIA cohorts to help him, it seems like so many crocodile tears. It appears that, much like Chuck Norris, Angelina Jolie only seems to have two settings: Wait and Kill.The second problem I had with the film is the bloat it develops as the story progresses. I was into this film for the first third of it, right up to what turns out to be the FIRST twist. This first twist comes early enough that you are like ""Cool! Now that that is out of the way, let's see how the rest of this plays out."" And it is exciting up to and after the first twist! I was all, ""Yay Salt!"" But then twist number two comes up and I'm all ""Ummmm...ok...well, I guess that kind of makes sense. On with the plot!"" Then the third twist comes (really?), then a fourth (Oh come on!). By the last set of twists and reveals, you've figured this whole thing out way in advance and you're just not interested anymore. To top it all off, they've worked so hard to make it complicated that the ending seems lazily thrown in there. It's an ambitious bit of storytelling but in the end, it's a mess and is ultimately unsatisfying.",3,"""Salt""y goodness?

This movie is way over the top unbelievable. And thus I couldn't get into it. The director copies the film style and editing techniques of the Jason Bourne movies. The Bourne movies you will recall were hugely successful and had great action scenes. When Bourne took on other super elite spies you got the feeling of danger, that he could be killed or captured. Not here. The skinny armed heroine takes on a bunch of SWAT guys in hand to hand combat with no problem, takes on a whole ship full of nasty Russians again with no problem. This movie was reportedly slotted for T. Cruise but he turned it down/had other projects to work on. Jolie gets it and there is apparently no script rewrite to show the difference of how a female spy would vanquish her foes.The plot shows Salt as a dedicated trusted US trained spy. But evidence comes to light that shows she assisted Russian spies. Rather than explain herself, tell how it's all wrong, she goes on the run and the audience is left to wonder what side she is truly on. Fair enough, but again the action scenes are so preposterous that I lost interest. The usual good work of British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (Redbelt, Serenity & Children of Men) is wasted here. I don't want to give anything away but when you see the scene where she, a presumed rogue Russian killer, has to get to the President at the WH and they know she's coming yet still pulls it off - then you will know that it is a ridiculous waste. Rather than waste $ on this 2nd rate film I would recommend these way better espionage films as substitutes - of course you can't go wrong with the previously mentioned Bourne films.

""Salt"" restored my confidence that an action movie could be educational, entertaining, and spiritually uplifting.From the start to the end, the scenario appeared logical, smart, and ingenious. From North Korea, to Washington DC, to New York, and Moscow, you get a sense of reaching around the globe in a matter of minutes. The severe torture of a woman by the North Koreans will leave you traumatized until the next and more painful episode ensues. In those brief and intense moments, my mind was split between the agony and sacrifices of a women involved in acting as a way of living and the parallel lifestyle of real official government spies. Either way you look at it, the insult outweighed the gain.The tortured and patriotic American spy is transformed in a snap into a traitor and fugitive  while the viewer was still recovering from her gruesome torture scenes. The apparently ruthless and calculated spy possessed a soft spot for building and guarding her love nest. The escape of the accused traitor and the chase by the feds occupied very good part of the action and never appeared boring or excessive. Without a single bone broken from jumping from the roof to the top of a moving truck, followed by another, and a third, the viewer will still be left gripped with dilemma facing an apparently innocent woman.The third episode of sneaking and disrupting a high level security funeral blended very well with the previous two episodes. You could easily forgive the moviemakers for exaggeration by making a lone and weak woman to cause such upheaval in such heavily secured settings.Then, in the wolves den, the weak and lone woman managed to take revenge for her lost love by eliminating those who did him and her harm. The scene of the Russian rebels in the Brooklyn harbor was as impressive as it could be. Dancing with wolves and getting out alive sounded within reach with smart planning.The questionable double spy or traitor will soon unveil other spies in her next assignment to steal the nuclear arsenal of America. In the White House, the long sleeper spy reveals his ugly face during a critical moment of nuclear survival.Putting a feeble yet determined woman at the center of action made the ""A-Team"" look miserably poor. The movie was filled with action, plotting, and twists of human nature that made is a real piece of art. Doctors should envy the neural scan that performed brain imaging without cumbersome magnets, specialized hospital rooms, or IV dyes.",5,Well done.

She carries this movie on her skinny shoulders. What's up with her lack of weight? She looked great back in the Tomb Raider days, now she looks like a twig. I guess she's still a little sexy, but that's mainly due to her on-screen presence and butt kicking attitude. She and Milla Jovovich don't really look the part at first glance, but both have become the two main female action stars on the planet. The only difference being that Jolie has a much wider range with her acting talent.The plot and writing are decent, but the whole Russia vs. the U.S. thing has been old for decades. There are a couple of neat twists along the way and early on you're not quite sure if Jolie's character is good or bad, so that keeps things interesting. I thought the storyline with her husband needed to be expanded upon, especially since his character is vital in changing the mindset of an important individual. The action scenes are well shot and violent for PG-13, with Jolie taking out countless armed guards with ease. Her acting ability and body control makes it all the more believable. You also get a lot of real stunts and very little CGI, which is always welcomed.Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor (dude needs a harder name to pronounce) are the only other main characters. They are both okay, but only a certain one gets to shine a bit more towards the end.Salt leaves room for a sequel or two. I read that this movie was originally written for Tom Cruise, so with the writing geared toward Angelina Jolie in future installments, I think they can be even better.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",4,The Russians are coming!,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1749,"['Salt', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'same', 'level', 'similar', 'Bourne', 'films', 'thanks', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'just', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'movie', 'skinny', 'shoulders', 'What', 'up', 'lack', 'weight', 'looked', 'great', 'back', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'days', 'now', 'twig', 'guess', 'still', 'little', 'sexy', 'mainly', 'due', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'butt', 'kicking', 'attitude', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'part', 'first', 'glance', 'have', 'become', 'two', 'main', 'female', 'action', 'stars', 'planet', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'Jolie', 'much', 'wider', 'range', 'acting', 'talent.The', 'plot', 'writing', 'are', 'decent', 'whole', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'thing', 'been', 'old', 'decades', 'are', 'couple', 'neat', 'twists', 'way', 'early', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'Jolie', 'character', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'interesting', 'thought', 'storyline', 'husband', 'needed', 'be', 'expanded', 'especially', 'character', 'vital', 'changing', 'mindset', 'important', 'individual', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'shot', 'violent', 'PG-13', 'Jolie', 'taking', 'out', 'countless', 'armed', 'guards', 'ease', 'acting', 'ability', 'body', 'control', 'more', 'believable', 'also', 'get', 'lot', 'real', 'stunts', 'very', 'little', 'CGI', 'always', 'welcomed.Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'dude', 'harder', 'name', 'pronounce', 'are', 'only', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'okay', 'only', 'certain', 'one', 'shine', 'bit', 'more', 'end.Salt', 'room', 'sequel', 'two', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'so', 'writing', 'geared', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'future', 'installments', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'better.3', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Reviews proclaimed that Angelina Jolie was the female Bourne - and I assumed that meant Lara Croft with a bit more smolder and sweat, in a slightly more realistic setting.  No thanks.But I was wrong.  I really liked this.  Salt is every bit as intense as the Bourne trilogy, and Jolie pulls it off with style.  It's not at all plausible, but neither is Bourne; and in both series the non-stop action kept me so engaged I never had time to wonder whether it made any sense until afterwards.  While it's happening it's simply intense and exciting, and kept me guessing.  I did anticipate the major twist towards the end, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.  The basic set up - of a defecting KGB agent, who tells the CIA that Salt is a sleeper double agent, allegedly as his only way to get her activated and give her a mission - is pretty far fetched when you stop and think about it.  The action also, is over and above what's humanly possible - but it's rendered so precisely that you don't get lost while it's going on.  What struck me, afterwards, is that Salt managed to achieve the same intensity as, say, the Bourne Ultimatum, but without the lack of clarity that you find in that film due to the shaky camera and jump cuts.Salt's a fun flick - an intense and exhilarating, non-stop, keeps-you-guessing spy game.  It looks great on Blu-Ray, and includes an extended edition and director's cut.

At least, James Bond franchise knows not to take itself seriously. And in Bourne movies we care about the protagonist. With Salt we have James Bond extravaganza which we suppose to care about but we don't. Angelina Jolie is a wonderful action actress but she was never capable of expressing an emotion on screen to save her life and the character is not developed for us to at least pretend to care. The husband!? Care even less.OK, so now that we are through the movie impression, the action on the screen is top notch, though suspended from reality in the best traditions of Die Hard franchise. The disc comes with three different versions of the movie, providing very alternative takes on some of the twists and how the story concludes. I, personally preferred the Unrated Extended cut. It allows us to guess on who's side Salt really is till the very late part of the movie, keeping the suspense going. It also has very different ending from both Theatrical and Director's cuts, which concludes the movie better, IMO.Video and audio quality are both top notch - referential material for how the movie should be presented on Blu-Ray. The bonus materials are just that - bonus, as they do not carry any eye-opening information about movie or the espionage business.Overall, this is an OK movie that definitely needs to be watched for any action junkie. Rent the Blu-Ray to see alternative cuts and give an exercise to your home theater.

Now 2 years later, she returns with ""Salt"", which, as you could tell from the trailer, is your typical summer action flick. So if you're expecting anything deep like ""Inception"", do be prepared to be disappointed. But if you're like me, asking for just a summer action flick, then you'll be satisfied.Evelyn Salt works in a cubicle in a CIA-owned office building. It's her anniversary day, and she is trying to figure out a perfect way to hold her anniversary dinner with her arachnid-fascinated husband Mike. She is called to interrogate a mysterious Russian man when she finds herself in two troublesome situations: 1) Rumor is spreading that she is working with Russian Intelligence and 2) In 24 hours, the Russian president will be assassinated by a Russian spy upon giving a Eulogy at the Vice President of the USA's funeral. She must prove her innocence from this accusation, as well as stop this spy from assassinating the Russian president.So yeah, a typical summer fare plot. Obviously you know that half the movie will just be Angelina beating guys up, and this film does not disappoint in that aspect. Action-wise, this film has some great action scenes, including a particularly exciting car chase that involves Angelina jumping from truck to truck. Her stunt work is quite impressive too, and it has some of her best stunts she's performed since the Tomb Raider movies. She is in great shape evidently, and so therefore her action scene work is quite fun to watch. Acting wise, she really can act, and she shows it well enough here.So yeah, it's fun and all. Good twist near the end makes it worth it as well. So why 2.5 stars? Because really, this film is like a fast food hamburger. Enjoyable while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache. After the film, you're left wondering why you watched it, just like after you finish eating a fast food burger, you're left wondering why you ate it, despite the enjoyment you got out of it.In short, It's worth it while it lasts, and that's mainly it.",3,"2.5/5- Fun while it lasts, but leaves a ""salty"" taste in your mouth afterward",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2313,"['one', 'female', 'can', 'bring', 'summer', 'action', 'fare', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', '2', 'years', 'got', 'Wanted', 'where', 'played', 'smokin', 'hot', 'Fox', 'name', 'certainly', 'right', 'smart', 'super-tattooed', 'female', 'who', 'poor', 'depressed', 'Wesley', 'clan', 'assassins', 'called', 'Fraternity', 'Now', '2', 'years', 'later', 'Salt', 'could', 'tell', 'trailer', 'typical', 'summer', 'action', 'flick', 'So', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'deep', 'Inception', 'do', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'asking', 'just', 'summer', 'action', 'flick', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied.Evelyn', 'Salt', 'cubicle', 'CIA-owned', 'office', 'building', 'anniversary', 'day', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'perfect', 'way', 'hold', 'anniversary', 'dinner', 'arachnid-fascinated', 'husband', 'Mike', 'called', 'interrogate', 'mysterious', 'Russian', 'man', 'when', 'two', 'troublesome', 'situations', '1', 'Rumor', 'spreading', 'working', 'Russian', 'Intelligence', '2', '24', 'hours', 'Russian', 'president', 'will', 'be', 'assassinated', 'Russian', 'spy', 'giving', 'Eulogy', 'Vice', 'President', 'USA', 'funeral', 'must', 'prove', 'innocence', 'accusation', 'as', 'well', 'stop', 'spy', 'assassinating', 'Russian', 'president.So', 'yeah', 'typical', 'summer', 'fare', 'plot', 'Obviously', 'know', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'Angelina', 'beating', 'guys', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'aspect', 'Action-wise', 'film', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'car', 'chase', 'Angelina', 'jumping', 'truck', 'truck', 'stunt', 'work', 'quite', 'impressive', 'too', 'best', 'stunts', 'performed', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'movies', 'great', 'shape', 'evidently', 'so', 'therefore', 'action', 'scene', 'work', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch', 'Acting', 'wise', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'well', 'enough', 'here.So', 'yeah', 'fun', 'Good', 'twist', 'end', 'worth', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'why', '2.5', 'stars', 'really', 'film', 'fast', 'food', 'hamburger', 'Enjoyable', 'consumed', 'yet', ""'re"", 'left', 'lingering', 'stomach', 'ache', 'film', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'watched', 'just', 'finish', 'eating', 'fast', 'food', 'burger', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'ate', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'it.In', 'short', 'mainly']",N/A

This film definitely did that for me:  it is fast, scary, and for the most part just realistic enough.  A few scenes are over the top, but not many.  Spy action films can also be very fun in that they keep you guessing as to what is really going on, with clues, sudden choices, and shocking revelations.  This filkeeps you guessing more or less to the very end, changing the viewer's mind not once, but twice or even three times in what may be a record.  Good guys become bad guys and vice versa, but multiple times!  Even some (admittedly crude) politics come into it.  Of course, there is also a question of style, that is, how cool the characters are, how sexy.  Here again, Jolie proves herself a gifted, charismatic screen presence, one of the greatest woman character actors at the moment as well as a star.  She is sleek, strong, and sinuous, exuding both sensuality and hard concentration.  These elements work in this film eminently well.However, at the deeper level, that of emotional identification with the character, the film is weaker.  Sure, Salt has connections with her past and present that make themselves felt, but I did not empathize much with her mission and plight.  To be sure, that isn't required in an action film, but it is in the very best of the genre.  The supreme masterpiece that does this is the Bourne Trilogy, which reached a new level of realistic action with an emotional overlay.  Bourne sets a new standard that the new James Bond series accomplishes with some success for an old character, but Salt doesn't quite reach it - yet.Recommended.

Of course, the trade-off is that to a significant extent the action comes at the sacrifice of more plot and character development.All that having been said, this film does have an interesting storyline; something of a ""Charm School"" theme for my fellow Nelso DeMille fans.

The final bit of information he gives on the plot is the name of the would-be assassin; Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).  The part that I felt was never addressed in the previews was why she would run instead of just proving she wasnt going to kill anyone.  She runs because she is afraid that the Russians may have her husband and she leaves to find him.  I thought this added some realism to the movie rather than taking the direction ""Im going to run because Im innocent"".  At this point the movie is part Bourne, part The Fugitive and all around captivating.  I wont go any further that this so that there wont be any spoilers.Here are a few other things that I liked about the movie, the first being the movie versions.  In a day and age when most movies try to milk you out of every penny offering a theatrical version, followed by the extended, and finally directors cuts of the movie, Salt offers all three versions on one Bluray.  I chose to watch the Directors Edition,  I havent done the research to see what all the differences are as of yet, but I thought it would be a good place to start.  One of the differences that I noticed was the lack of ""sexual scenes"", especially those that were in the previews, gone is Angelina's typical ""sex symbol"" role.  I noticed this when I was watching the bonus content ""Salt: Disclosed"" and they flashed through a few scenes that were in the previews that I retroactively noticed werent in the directors cut.  The thing that I liked about this is that usually ""directors cuts"" add in either more sex or violence that they had to cut to make a more favorable rating.  The fact that the director cut the ""sex"" to make the movie more like he wanted really stood out to me.  I dont have any problems with mature content in mature movies, but I thought it was admirable to not just cash in on the extra draw of more nudity or sexual situations, and rather focus on making the movie just how you want it.  Also retrospectively I noticed that I dont believe there was any profanity in the movie, or very little at most.  On the other hand the violence was quite brutal and abrupt.  I dont mean that it was gorey or over the top or uncalled for, quite the opposite.  It felt that the violence matched the type of people in the movie, these are all trained CIA and Russian agents, they arent going to spend a lot of time hesitating to shoot someone who is a threat to them, and arent going to waste a lot of time regretting having to have shot someone who just tried to kill them.All these things together made a movie good enough that not only do I plan to purchase the movie, but I would like to go back and watch the other two versions of the movie and try and see what all the differences are.  Both Angelina and Liev put up great performances, and fans of either should watch this movie, also any fans of the spy/thriller genre will definitely enjoy it as well.",5,Great spy action... plus much more,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,3464,"['rented', 'movie', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'story', 'had', 'plenty', 'action', 'fairness', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'merely', 'spy', 'action', 'flick', 'kept', 'feeding', 'just', 'enough', 'contradicting', 'information', 'keep', 'second', 'guessing', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'happening.In', 'case', 'havent', 'seen', 'previews', 'story', 'when', 'Russian', 'defector', 'CIA', 'inform', 'assassination', 'plot', 'Russian', 'president', 'when', 'American', 'vice', 'presidents', 'funeral', 'final', 'bit', 'information', 'plot', 'name', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'part', 'felt', 'was', 'never', 'addressed', 'previews', 'was', 'why', 'would', 'run', 'instead', 'just', 'proving', 'wasnt', 'going', 'kill', 'anyone', 'afraid', 'Russians', 'may', 'have', 'husband', 'find', 'thought', 'added', 'realism', 'movie', 'rather', 'taking', 'direction', 'Im', 'going', 'run', 'because', 'Im', 'innocent', 'point', 'movie', 'part', 'Bourne', 'part', 'Fugitive', 'captivating', 'wont', 'go', 'further', 'so', 'wont', 'be', 'spoilers.Here', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'liked', 'movie', 'first', 'being', 'movie', 'versions', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'movies', 'try', 'milk', 'penny', 'offering', 'theatrical', 'version', 'followed', 'extended', 'finally', 'directors', 'cuts', 'movie', 'Salt', 'three', 'versions', 'one', 'Bluray', 'chose', 'watch', 'Directors', 'Edition', 'havent', 'done', 'research', 'see', 'what', 'differences', 'are', 'yet', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'One', 'differences', 'noticed', 'was', 'lack', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'especially', 'were', 'previews', 'gone', 'Angelina', 'typical', 'sex', 'symbol', 'role', 'noticed', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'bonus', 'content', 'Salt', 'Disclosed', 'flashed', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'previews', 'retroactively', 'noticed', 'werent', 'directors', 'cut', 'thing', 'liked', 'usually', 'directors', 'cuts', 'add', 'more', 'sex', 'violence', 'had', 'cut', 'make', 'more', 'favorable', 'rating', 'fact', 'director', 'cut', 'sex', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'wanted', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'dont', 'have', 'problems', 'mature', 'content', 'mature', 'movies', 'thought', 'was', 'admirable', 'not', 'just', 'cash', 'extra', 'draw', 'more', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'rather', 'focus', 'making', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'want', 'Also', 'retrospectively', 'noticed', 'dont', 'believe', 'was', 'profanity', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'most', 'other', 'hand', 'violence', 'was', 'quite', 'brutal', 'abrupt', 'dont', 'mean', 'was', 'gorey', 'top', 'uncalled', 'opposite', 'felt', 'violence', 'matched', 'type', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'trained', 'CIA', 'Russian', 'agents', 'arent', 'going', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'hesitating', 'shoot', 'someone', 'who', 'threat', 'arent', 'going', 'waste', 'lot', 'time', 'regretting', 'having', 'have', 'shot', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'tried', 'kill', 'them.All', 'things', 'together', 'made', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'plan', 'purchase', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'other', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'differences', 'are', 'Angelina', 'Liev', 'put', 'up', 'great', 'performances', 'fans', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'also', 'fans', 'spy/thriller', 'genre', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

They run 1:39:56, 1:40:58, and 1:43:59 respectively (credit to Interzone_Records for the correction).  Here are the major differences as compared to the base Theatrical Cut, e.g. Theatrical vs. Extended, and Extended vs. Director's Cut.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.  There are a few major, significant differences between the versions.The Director's Cut makes the most sense plot-wise, and includes some better character development, in my opinion.THEATRICAL vs. DIRECTOR's CUT*****************************************************1)  Evelyn Salt's opening interrogation scene in North Korea is longer and more brutal.  The soldiers force a tube down her throat and subject her to more intense questioning, followed by several kicks to the abdomen.2)  Extended scene of Orlov training little kids who will be future sleeper agents.  As the kids finish a race through the woods, Orlov asks which kid was first, and which was last, whipping the last kid with a riding crop.3)  Abduction of Michael (Salt's husband) by Orlov's thugs is shown.4)  Additional scene where Michael tells Salt about a new species of spider that he has discovered.5)  Childhood scene between Salt and Schnaider at Orlov's training camp.6)  Salt's husband is NOT shot in the Director's Cut; rather, he is slowly drowned and Salt is forced to watch.  Michael's death is much more harrowing in the Director's Cut.7)  Salt kills Orlov with a broken bottle, and the stabbing is shown in more detail, rather than off-screen.8)  Salt's rampage through Orlov's freighter HQ is more graphic.9)  Gunfights depict more bullet holes and blood, but nothing overly gory.10) Winter kills the president in the Director's Cut, whereas in the Theatrical cut, Winter only knocks him unconscious.  I always thought the Theatrical cut never made much sense, because the President would easily be able to identify Winter as the traitor.11)  At the end of the movie, there is a voiceover that subtly suggests that the vice president is actually one of Orlov's sleeper agents, setting the stage up for a sequel.  This voiceover is not present in the Extended Cut.EXTENDED CUT vs. DIRECTOR's CUT*****************************************************1)  The changes listed above in the Director's Cut are also done in the Extended Cut, with the exception of the differences below.2)  The President is only knocked unconscious in the Theatrical Cut (and killed in the Director's Cut).  In the Extended Cut, Winter attempts to make his way towards the unconscious President, who is being wheeled away on a stretcher, in order to kill him.3)  The biggest difference in the Extended Cut is that Salt doesn't kill Orlov until the end of the movie.  So the entire sequence in the Theatrical and Director's Cuts where Salt annihilates Orlov's thugs on the barge is missing.At the end of the Extended Cut, she is being interrogated by Peabody, where she fakes suicide and is taken to a hospital.  She subsequently escapes from the hospital, finds Orlov (back in Russia somewhere), and kills him.",5,Unrated Edition vs. Theatrical Cut Differences,1291766400,"12 8, 2010",2010,3160,"['are', '3', 'versions', 'Salt', 'available', 'viewing', 'Theatrical', 'Extended', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'run', '1:39:56', '1:40:58', '1:43:59', 'respectively', 'credit', 'Interzone_Records', 'correction', 'Here', 'are', 'major', 'differences', 'compared', 'base', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'e.g', 'Theatrical', 'vs.', 'Extended', 'Extended', 'vs.', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Note', 'SPOILERS', 'follow', 'below', 'so', 'read', 'own', 'risk', 'are', 'few', 'major', 'significant', 'differences', 'versions.The', 'Director', 'Cut', 'most', 'sense', 'plot-wise', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'opinion.THEATRICAL', 'vs.', 'DIRECTOR', 'CUT*****************************************************1', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'opening', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'North', 'Korea', 'longer', 'more', 'brutal', 'soldiers', 'force', 'tube', 'down', 'throat', 'subject', 'more', 'intense', 'questioning', 'followed', 'several', 'kicks', 'abdomen.2', 'Extended', 'scene', 'Orlov', 'training', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'sleeper', 'agents', 'kids', 'finish', 'race', 'woods', 'Orlov', 'kid', 'was', 'first', 'was', 'last', 'whipping', 'last', 'kid', 'riding', 'crop.3', 'Abduction', 'Michael', 'Salt', 'husband', 'Orlov', 'thugs', 'shown.4', 'Additional', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'Salt', 'new', 'species', 'spider', 'discovered.5', 'Childhood', 'scene', 'Salt', 'Schnaider', 'Orlov', 'training', 'camp.6', 'Salt', 'husband', 'NOT', 'shot', 'Director', 'Cut', 'rather', 'slowly', 'drowned', 'Salt', 'forced', 'watch', 'Michael', 'death', 'much', 'more', 'harrowing', 'Director', 'Cut.7', 'Salt', 'Orlov', 'broken', 'bottle', 'stabbing', 'shown', 'more', 'detail', 'rather', 'off-screen.8', 'Salt', 'rampage', 'Orlov', 'freighter', 'HQ', 'more', 'graphic.9', 'Gunfights', 'depict', 'more', 'bullet', 'holes', 'blood', 'nothing', 'overly', 'gory.10', 'president', 'Director', 'Cut', 'whereas', 'Theatrical', 'cut', 'Winter', 'only', 'unconscious', 'always', 'thought', 'Theatrical', 'cut', 'never', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'President', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Winter', 'traitor.11', 'end', 'movie', 'voiceover', 'subtly', 'vice', 'president', 'actually', 'one', 'Orlov', 'sleeper', 'agents', 'setting', 'stage', 'up', 'sequel', 'voiceover', 'not', 'present', 'Extended', 'Cut.EXTENDED', 'CUT', 'vs.', 'DIRECTOR', 'CUT*****************************************************1', 'changes', 'listed', 'Director', 'Cut', 'are', 'also', 'done', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'exception', 'differences', 'below.2', 'President', 'only', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'killed', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Winter', 'make', 'way', 'unconscious', 'President', 'who', 'being', 'wheeled', 'away', 'stretcher', 'order', 'kill', 'him.3', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Salt', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Orlov', 'end', 'movie', 'entire', 'sequence', 'Theatrical', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'where', 'Salt', 'Orlov', 'thugs', 'barge', 'end', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'being', 'interrogated', 'Peabody', 'where', 'suicide', 'taken', 'hospital', 'subsequently', 'hospital', 'Orlov', 'back', 'Russia', 'somewhere']",N/A
1247794,ACFAFWFVZN1FJ,B0021L8V0M,Ser Gregorie,"[5, 6]","Salt is your run-of-the-mill summer action movie with a twisted story akin to The Bourne series or James Bond  of old. Like those movies the action is over the top and crazy, guns blaze and sparks fly but the PG-13 rating spares us the blood and guts that should accompany such wicked projectiles. One scene has Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie)  killing a guy by ramming the jagged end of a broken bottle into his neck but this is left to your imagination since all we see is the motion and then the discarded bloody bottle after the fact. Am I the only one who prefers his action graphic and R-rated? Still Salt was highly likable and the liking goes beyond the beauty at the helm.The plot of Salt is not easily summarized without offering up spoilers so I cannot go there. I will say however that it involve the CIA, a super-spy named Evelyn Salt, her fellow spy Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and a plot involving Russia, North Korea and terrorism. Angelina Jolie does her thing as Evelyn Salt, with the action looking very much like she did the stunts herself (which she did). Speaking of stunts, unlike the Bourne series, the fighting and action in Salt was done extremely well. When Evelyn fought bigger guys she would use objects and moves that made sense for a smaller woman. I have grown tired of seeing small, slight women throwing roundhouses, jabs and fancy moves to drop big 300lb muscle men in action films. Salt takes guys out by kicks to the groin, trapping the knee, breaking bottles across their faces and choking them out with chains. If anything, this really impressed me with the action.What I didn't like about the action was the tired, incorrect and convenient knockouts that occurred when people got beat up. Movies tend to lean on this to discard bad guys who they don't want to have the hero kill. The hero will punch baddies in the gut and step on their hand and they will lie on the ground knocked out no matter where they were hit. Salt did a good job on the choreography but guys were getting knocked out from subtle blows and it really bothered me that they took this route. Film quality fluctuates at times especially during the traffic scenes but it isn't enough to distract the viewer from the scenes that are playing out.Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Peabody and is a strong presence as he always - which leads me to wonder when he will headline his own picture.

1247804,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0021L8V0M,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 4]","Salt (action, crime, mystery)Directed by Phillip NoyceStarring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel EjioforSony Pictures | 2010 | 101 min | Unrated | Released Dec 21, 2010Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0French: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, SpanishDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray DiscBD-LiveThe Film 4/5Salt is full of action and includes an air of mystery. The opening scene takes us back two years and we see Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogated in North Korea. She's in pretty bad shape after being beaten, but refuses to talk, even when a tube is forced down her throat and gasoline is poured in. She's eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange and returns to work as a CIA agent. This all happens at the start of the movie and sets up what is to come.The final thing I'm going to reveal is an encounter with a Russian defector. She's selected to interview him and discovers that there's a plan underway to substitute certain Americans with Russians. They become sleepers who will eventually act on behalf of Russia. He informs any agents who might be listening that Evelyn Salt is the name of one such agent.Salt has a decision to make. Which of her colleagues can she trust? Should she stay and answer the accusations? Would it be better to run and try to prevent other sleeper agents from fulfilling their purpose? She decides to run and most of her colleagues see it as an admission of guilt. We're placed in her position and it's one with no obvious solutions. It has the same feel as the Bourne movies, with confusion surrounding her identity.The CIA isn't happy that she evaded capture and sends agents to bring her back. This results in a huge chase scene in which Salt makes some unlikely decisions. If you're a fan of action movies, this is where the story really takes off. The first chase scene happens on a highway and sees Salt making improbable leaps between moving vehicles to evade capture.Jolie looks capable of making some of the jumps, and we see her continually revise her plan as she flees her pursuers. The story keeps us guessing about the level of her involvement and we can't be sure what her motivations are. She's resourceful and uses her intelligence in order to predict the moves of her pursuers and discover the motivations of the Russian group.If you enjoy movies such as Taken, Wanted, Bourne or Die Hard, this is your kind of story. The first adrenalin rush comes early and we rarely have time to breathe. There is a plot, although it's secondary to the action. This is a movie that entertains because of its pacing and spectacular chase scenes. There's not a great deal of thought required, but you will see that everything makes some kind of sense if you think about what you have just seen. Well, it makes as much sense as the average James Bond movie.If you want to see Jolie running around, climbing, jumping and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride. The loose ends are tied up neatly and the conclusion is satisfying. The acting is convincing, although Jolie never has to show the range of emotion that she achieved in Changeling. Schreiber and Ejiofor are always good and both play their roles well.Video Quality 5/5It's hard to fault the look of the movie. Colors appear natural and detail is strong. There's a fine layer of grain and the picture has considerable pop. I felt like I was in the middle of the action. Sony has delivered another great transfer.Audio Quality 5/5There's a lot happening on the screen and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything that's thrown at it. Chase scenes sound incredible, while scenes involving explosions and gunfire have the appropriate impact. Dialogue doesn't suffer either, and the surrounds are active throughout the duration of the movie. The score adds to the action scenes and completes the experience. You won't have any complaints about the presentation.Special Features 4.5/5The additional features all appear in full HD.Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - The movie includes three cuts and this feature is only available on the theatrical version.Filmmakers' CommentaryThe Ultimate Female Action Hero (8:05) - Showing some of the stunts that Jolie performed.The Real Agents (12:33) - Former spies talk about their experiences.Spy Disguise: The Looks of Evelyn Salt (5:26) - A look at the various appearances Jolie used in the movie.The Modern Master of the Political Thriller: Phillip Noyce (9:15) - Noyce explains why he has good insight into the life of a spy, and describes how he tries to capture the attention of the audience.Salt: Declassified (29:47) - A thorough ""making of"" feature that goes into more depth about some of the things covered in the other features.""The Treatment"" Radio Interview with Phillip Noyce (27:12) - Elvis Mitchell interviews Noyce.PreviewsBD-LiveSalt is a well-crafted spy movie that's heavy on the action, although there are a couple of twists in there too. Jolie looks the part and is convincing in her role and the supporting cast does a great job. If you want to be thrilled for 100 minutes without having to think too much, this will get the job done. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent and the special features contain a wealth of additional information if you're curious.Overall Score 4.5/5",4,Salt: Delivers exactly what you would

1247805,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B0021L8V0M,Steven Carrier,"[134, 150]","Now this is what I'm talking about. Phillip Noyce's ""Salt"" is my type of summer movie. First and foremost ""Salt"" is an action film and it succeeds with flying colors in that regard. But what I really admired about this picture is that it took place in reality. The action was grounded in physics and therefore made it messy, mean and hard hitting. Then we have bon-a-fied movie superstar Angelina Jolie in her best action performance. Where ""Salt"" also succeeds stupendously is with Evelyn Salt's characterization, which is complex, dualistic, fascinating and ultimately enigmatic. Jolie thrives in this role which plays to literally every one of her strengths as an actress. You root for her and sympathize with her even though it's never clear what side Evelyn truly falls into. It's in this intense dynamic between plot, character and action that leaves ""Salt"" head and shoulders over films like ""Eclipse"", ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" and yes, even ""Inception"". But also on a side note it's just plain refreshing to see a film that has Russians trying to take down America, crisp and clean action cinematography and a true movie star like Jolie leading things along.

The movie had me hooked about 20 minutes into it. Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable ""twists"" predictable enough for dummies.The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the ""behind the back"" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place.

There is a person saying that Jolie is working for another country, Jolie saying she has to make sure her loved ones are safe, and the world seeing chasing after her. As the plots begin to spin, you begin to wonder if anyone is who they say they are and who, exactly, Salt is. she is ruthless, that's for sure, and she knows her stuff. Still, she is an agent with a past and that past is something that mingles with some high profile people.Salt is one of those movies that hits the ground running and waits for you to catch up. For an adrenile movie it has something of a complex plot (meaning it is complex on a Hollywood standard but a C- when looked out outisde of action), and i think this helps it. In the beginning you actually see how hard things are for an agent, see how complex it is when you work as a supposed spy, and then have that bubble deflated for you. you also have love added into the equation, making things interesting.When you look at this movie, a lot of it does revolve around the notion of love. From the start this is explain and given as part of the character, and from that start you gage what is transpiring. I have to hand it to jolie on this job because she seems to hold her own on all fields and she does it with style and a bit of mystery to her. Considering her real life and the microscope she operates under, you can see just how well this is portrayed there.The action here is fast, is solid, and the ideas are good. The movie is a run, Lola, run movie with a lot of firepower, and there are positions of the plot map that make you say ""cool."" I like the way some things happen and the way Salt stays ahead, but the movie doesn't make her chasing people's total fools. They are not far behind and she seems ready, but a plot portion of the movie and the past explains this. And, again, you cannot for the love piece.As much as this is the same movie in some ways, it differs in some good ways as well. The way jolie gets to do things, interesting things, to get out is interesting to me as well. I liked the fact that we do not see bullets into a wall as some means to get out or shooting hundreds of people.

To make my review short and not to spoil anything about the film, I can only say is that the fast-paced and action-packed thriller, penned by Kurt Wimmer (""The Recruit""), keeps you guessing until the end, though you may notice lots of plot holes when you leave the theater, or even before.This is not to say the film is bad. ""Salt"" delivers goods with Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who remains a mystery from the very start (the film begins with a sequence set in North Korea, slightly reminiscent of one James Bond film). In fact some parts of the film remind us of James Bond or Jason Bourne films, but Jolie lends energy (if not credibility) to the convoluted storyline, which looks sometimes dated with the heroine's back story and these inevitable ""villains."" Or maybe we should call it old-fashioned.""Salt"" is mindless fun with lots of actions. The action set-pieces including chases and shoot-outs are all well-done though some of them stretch credibility to the point where Salt looks almost superhuman (never afraid of ricocheting bullets).

Sure some (or most depending on how well you know the thriller genre)of the twists in ""Salt"" are clever but what makes ""Salt"" a step above most mediocre thrillers is how the director unfolds his story. ""Salt"" is a good if predictable film where some of the cliches of the genre are turned inside out. ""Salt"" plays as a cross between ""No Way Out"" (itself a remake of ""Out of the Past"") and the Bourne movies and, although not as good as those films, manages to be an entertaining thrill ride with plenty of action so you don't really notice some of the holes in the plot until after the movie is over.Image quality is exceptionally crisp without being over process. The lossless audio sounds exceptional and is immersive. We get subtitles with this as well.SPOILERS BELOW:Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted when a rogue Soviet spy master named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski)shows up and states that she is a Soviet spy and is there to kill the Russian President who will be attending the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. While Salt denies that she is a Soviet spy everything including the fact that she goes on the run indicates to her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and Counter Intelligence Agent Peabody (Chiewetel Ejiofor)that she is, indeed, a Soviet spy who has been living and working undercover for most of her life. Salt claims she has gone on the run because whenever a spy's cover is blown their entire family is taken out and she's concerned that the only person in her life her husband will be assassinated.END OF SPOILERS:Directed by veteran thriller director Phillip Noyce (""Clear and Present Danger"", ""The Quiet American"", ""Rabbit Proof Fence"") and written by Kurt Wimmer (""Law Abiding Citizen"", ""Street Kings"")""Salt"" plays with the expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films. What really sells ""Salt"" though are the performances and the stunts in the film as well as the ingenious flashback story that is integrated into the main film revealing almost everything about Salt well before the midway point of the movie. While these attributes don't save the movie entirely, it does make the film diverting and entertaining.There are some gaps in logic/the narrative but these are pretty easy to over look because you end up if you become involved in the movie. The ending which sets up a sequel wasn't quite as conclusive as it should have been as they could easily have left it open on the theatrical version but given us a bit more closure for the audience. Most films that leave an opening this large just don't work and it is a major Achille's heel for ""Salt"".You can watch the ""Director's Cut"" an ""Unedited Version"" or the theatrical cut of the film with the Blu-ray. You should note that the story unfolds and is resolved in a slightly different fashion with the ""Director's Cut"" rather than the theatrical cut. As to which one you enjoy most, it'll, again, depend on your expectations of the movie but most of the changes are fairly cosmetic (i.e., don't add or subtract from the overall impact of the film).There's also featurettes on the production of the movie as well as Noyce providing a commentary track that is quite interesting particularly when it comes to the decisions for the editing decisions made for the film.If you set your expectations aisde set up from the preview trailer, ""Salt"" is an enjoyable action flick (of course it has little to do with reality but when was the last time you saw an action flick that DID have something to do with reality) and you might want to give it a chance to ""prove"" it's case.",3,Solid thriller spiced up by plot twists of other thrillers  3 1/2 stars,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,3840,"['REVIEW', 'FOR', 'BLU-RAY', 'EDITION', 'ONLY', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Salt', 'was', 'bit', 'underwhelmed', 'frankly', 'trailer', 'set', 'up', 'different', 'thriller', 'Sure', 'most', 'depending', 'how', 'well', 'know', 'thriller', 'genre', 'twists', 'Salt', 'are', 'clever', 'what', 'Salt', 'step', 'most', 'mediocre', 'thrillers', 'how', 'director', 'story', 'Salt', 'good', 'predictable', 'film', 'where', 'cliches', 'genre', 'are', 'turned', 'Salt', 'cross', 'No', 'Way', 'Out', 'remake', 'Out', 'Past', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'be', 'entertaining', 'thrill', 'ride', 'plenty', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'holes', 'plot', 'movie', 'over.Image', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'crisp', 'being', 'over', 'process', 'lossless', 'audio', 'exceptional', 'immersive', 'get', 'subtitles', 'well.SPOILERS', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'suddenly', 'being', 'hunted', 'when', 'rogue', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'master', 'named', 'Orlov', 'Daniel', 'Olbrychski', 'up', 'states', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'there', 'kill', 'Russian', 'President', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'funeral', 'Vice', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Salt', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'everything', 'including', 'fact', 'run', 'boss', 'Ted', 'Winter', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Counter', 'Intelligence', 'Agent', 'Peabody', 'Chiewetel', 'Ejiofor', 'indeed', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'working', 'undercover', 'most', 'life', 'Salt', 'gone', 'run', 'whenever', 'spy', 'cover', 'blown', 'entire', 'family', 'taken', 'out', 'concerned', 'only', 'person', 'life', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'assassinated.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Directed', 'veteran', 'thriller', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Quiet', 'American', 'Rabbit', 'Proof', 'Fence', 'written', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'Street', 'Kings', 'Salt', 'expectations', 'thriller', 'genre', 'Noyce', 'Wimmer', 'knowing', 'use', 'twists', 'turns', 'other', 'films', 'What', 'really', 'Salt', 'are', 'performances', 'stunts', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'ingenious', 'flashback', 'story', 'integrated', 'main', 'film', 'revealing', 'almost', 'everything', 'Salt', 'well', 'midway', 'point', 'movie', 'attributes', 'do', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'entirely', 'make', 'film', 'diverting', 'are', 'gaps', 'logic/the', 'narrative', 'are', 'pretty', 'easy', 'look', 'end', 'up', 'become', 'involved', 'movie', 'ending', 'up', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'conclusive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'left', 'open', 'theatrical', 'version', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'closure', 'audience', 'Most', 'films', 'leave', 'opening', 'large', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'major', 'Achille', 'heel', 'Salt', '.You', 'can', 'watch', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Unedited', 'Version', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'should', 'note', 'story', 'unfolds', 'resolved', 'slightly', 'different', 'fashion', 'Director', 'Cut', 'rather', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'one', 'enjoy', 'most', ""'ll"", 'again', 'depend', 'expectations', 'movie', 'most', 'changes', 'are', 'fairly', 'cosmetic', 'i.e.', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'subtract', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'also', 'production', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Noyce', 'providing', 'commentary', 'track', 'quite', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'when', 'decisions', 'editing', 'decisions', 'made', 'film.If', 'set', 'expectations', 'aisde', 'set', 'up', 'preview', 'trailer', 'Salt', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'flick', 'course', 'little', 'do', 'reality', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'action', 'flick', 'DID', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'reality', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'chance', 'prove', 'case']",N/A

1247836,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0021L8V0M,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[8, 9]","This summer has had some outstanding summer movies, and Salt is one of them. It starts with Angelina Jolie in the title role, Evelyn Salt, a CIA spy. A Russian defector suddenly shows up at one of their front businesses. During questioning, he announces to one an all that the visiting Russian president will be assassinated - by Evelyn Salt, supposedly a deep-cover Russian spy. The fact that the 'defector' then kills two agents escaping the building never enters into some folks' wholehearted belief his story. They take her in for questioning, she busts loose (super-agent that she is), and the chase is on.I really can't say anything else about the plot. There are so many reversals than anything would be a spoiler, and you deserve to see them for yourself. Of course, Jolie completely takes command of the role, and of pretty much everything else in sight. I'm sure it will surprise no one that the role was orginally written for a male actor ('Edwin,' not 'Evelyn') but, when it came time to cast the manliest action actor they could find, Jolie's name topped the list.This movie stands well above its genre. There are plenty of fight scenes, some pretty amazing chases, and a satisfying ending that begs for sequels. More than just that, there's an actual plot, one that keeps you guessing almost (but not quite) to the end.-- wiredweird",5,Great guns'n'chases flick,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1346,"['summer', 'had', 'outstanding', 'summer', 'movies', 'Salt', 'one', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'title', 'role', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'CIA', 'spy', 'Russian', 'defector', 'suddenly', 'up', 'one', 'front', 'businesses', 'questioning', 'one', 'visiting', 'Russian', 'president', 'will', 'be', 'assassinated', 'Evelyn', 'Salt', 'supposedly', 'deep-cover', 'Russian', 'spy', 'fact', ""'defector"", 'then', 'two', 'agents', 'escaping', 'building', 'never', 'folks', 'wholehearted', 'belief', 'story', 'take', 'questioning', 'loose', 'super-agent', 'chase', 'on.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reversals', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'deserve', 'see', 'course', 'Jolie', 'completely', 'command', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'sight', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'surprise', 'one', 'role', 'was', 'orginally', 'written', 'male', 'actor', ""'Edwin"", 'not', ""'Evelyn"", 'when', 'came', 'time', 'cast', 'manliest', 'action', 'actor', 'could', 'find', 'Jolie', 'name', 'topped', 'list.This', 'movie', 'well', 'genre', 'are', 'plenty', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'chases', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'begs', 'sequels', 'More', 'just', 'actual', 'plot', 'one', 'guessing', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'end.', 'wiredweird']",N/A

One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions.
