773731,A12GP54HKAEO7M,B0000C7PU4,,"[1, 2]","The Original TMNT are back!I was always a fan of TMNT ever since,  back in the 1980's,  I ask the young Army Lieutenant why the ""heck""  he  had turtles with Martial Art's weapons on his desk? The Lieutenant stammered that he had been roommates or friends, can't remember which, with the cartoon's creator in college. Little did he know that I worked for a SiFi Game Company on the side or that I was close friends with the then editor of, ""Dragon Magazine"". I was mildly interested, so I looked into the ""underground"" comic that featured TMNT and fell in love with it. The deeper than normal comic book story line and edgier banter were what I think grabbed my attention.Jump forward a few years to the original  TV cartoon. A big disappointment in my eyes.  The animation was far too commercial, or what Jack Kirby would call, ""industrial"", the banter was not edgy and the dialogue was abysmal and pizza obsessed.Jump forward again, 2009. Kids and Grandson are up visiting for the 4th of July. Grandson is in love with, (don't get ahead of me here), you guessed it, TMNT. As I tried to run herd on a way too energetic 4 year old one night, I asked him if he wanted to watch cartoons. Of course he came bouncing up with TMNT. I sigh and say, ""O.K., we'll watch these"", as I reluctantly fire up the DVD Player.Much to my surprise this was not the original cartoon. The stories are much better, the animation is border line Aname and rather well done. Granted that the plots are not quit as gritty as the original comic's, (but only slightly dumbed down for young kids), but they are 100 times better than the original cartoon's. I ended up watching the whole set of DVD's long after the little tike had fallen asleep.All & all Highly recommended if you were a fan of the original comic's. If You were a fan to the original cartoons, go rent one of each an watch them one after the other. I think that you will find that this is the better of the two. I also thought that the superior tribute to comic legend Jack Kirby was a very nice touch.Spence the Elder""Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc""-M. Addams-",4,OMG!

Now if they were to release classic TMNT in box sets, I'd give it five stars and would definitely buy.

773734,A3JADS9AZXTBAG,B0000C7PU4,"Timstuff ""tim16733""","[9, 11]","Simply put, this show does for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles what Batman Beyond did for Batman. Me and my brothers were obsessed with Ninja Turtles when we were kids (even if our Mom didn't like them), and I've got to say this show, hands down kills the original show easily in so many ways. It is much closer to Laird and Easman's original comic, rather than the franchised kiddy fare that we grew up with. While the violence of the original underground comic is still absent (Leo and Raph still don't show off their blade skills), it captures the dark essence of the Ninja Turtles. Ninja buffs like myself can appreciate the subtle touches of Ninja authenticity spiced throughout the show, too. While not exactly historically accurate, the turtles are very stealth oriented, and there ares some neat historical references laced throughout. The action in the show is pretty cool, even if they had to water down the violence for kids' TV. And the animation, while not up to the high standards of shows like Batman Beyond or even X-Men Evolution still gets the job done, and the art style itself is very well done, even if the animation isn't that fluid.For a long time, I had thought I had outgrown TMNT. But this show has definately rekindled my interest.
