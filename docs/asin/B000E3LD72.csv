967602,AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B000E3LD72,Daniel Maltzman,"[42, 47]","Poison's new DVD ""Seven Days Live,"" (2006) from the band's performance at London's Hammersmith Apollo is a very unusual and unexpected concert that the band would choose to release. One might expect Poison to release a DVD from a more recent tour (which is more or less a nostalgia act) or release a DVD from the 1990 ""Flesh and Blood"" tour, when the band was at its commercial peak. But a show from 1993 is totally surprising for a few reasons.First, this lineup of Poison features guitarist Ritchie Kotzen, stepping in for C.C. Deville, who left Poison from 1991 to 1996. Kotzen made only one album with Poison, 1993's mature and bluesy ""Native Tongue,"" before being fired for shagging drummer Rikki Rocket's fianc&eacute;. It seems odd to release a DVD with Kotzen, considering that his tenure in the band was so short lived and that the classic lineup of Poison, with C.C., is hands down the definitive version of the band.Another reason a show from '93 is an unusual choice is that the set list relies heavily from the band's ""Native Tongue"" (1993) album. Although ""Native Tongue"" is a strong and well-written album, it was a relative failure. ""Native Tongue"" was the band's first album that failed to go platinum, winding up in the dreaded cut-out bin, sitting next to Vince Neil's ""Exposed,"" (1993) Motley Crue's 1994 self-titled album, and David Lee Roth's ""A Little Ain't Enough"" (1991) by the end of 1994. ""Native Tongue"" is now out-of-print and is only available used or as a cut-out. It seems odd to release a DVD from a concert showcasing an album that was virtually ignored upon its release and is now forgotten.All this taken into consideration, a show from 1993 is either desirable or undesirable, depending on what you're looking for. If you are a casual fan or a Poison purist, and want a show of all the hits, you may find yourself disappointed with this DVD. As previously stated, a lot of the songs (nearly half) are from the ""Native Tongue"" album and many fans will probably be unfamiliar with that material. Also, Kotzen is far more technically proficient than C.C. Deville, and jazzes up the solos from the C.C. material, so purists may be put-off, or they may just be put off by seeing anyone but C.C. on lead guitar.But other fans may get a lot out of this DVD. I've seen Poison a few times in the last few years, and although I always enjoy the show, I am disappointed that they play virtually the same songs all the time. It's as though the band is frozen in 1990. While a Poison show in the 00s is still a lot of fun, it's most definitely a nostalgia act. With this DVD, it's great to see the band out promoting fresh material.  I really enjoyed the ""Native Tongue"" album, so it's great to hear those songs performed live, because the band nowadays certainly won't do it (although they have played ""Stand"" with C.C.)  And while some fans may not like Kotzen's interpretations of the songs, I find them to be a refreshing change of pace.Recorded at London's Hammersmith Apollo on April, 23, 1993, among a wildly enthusiastic sold-out crowd, it's easy to forget that outside the hall, most of the audience that so loved Poison only a few years before, were  now listening to Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that Poison never really survived grunge and has now been reduced to being a nostalgia act, because they deserve better. With ""Native Tongue,"" the band didn't jump on any bandwagon or rehash a tired formula. With ""Native Tongue"" the band made an earnest attempt to grow as artists and made an album that deserved to be heard. It's a shame that the general public of 1993 wasn't mature enough to like both Poison and Nirvana and felt they had to abandon one and embrace another. But for a few hours within a hall, several thousand fans didn't care if Poison was cool or not.The actual taping of the show is superb. Shot in mostly color, with some black and white footage, ""documentary style,"" the show is professionally shot and looks and sounds great. Charismatic frontman Brett Michaels has the audience by the palm of his hand, and along with the rest of the band, gives 100 percent.In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD for fans of the ""Native Tongue"" album and the more die-hard fans that are familiar with the lesser known material. Casual fans may be disappointed with the lack of big hits, although there are still enough big hits, like ""Every Rose Has its Thrown"" and ""Something to Believe in"" to please, although purists still may be put off by Kotzen's interpretations.",4,An unusual and unexpected concert,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,4521,"['Poison', 'new', 'DVD', 'Seven', 'Days', 'Live', '2006', 'band', 'performance', 'London', 'Hammersmith', 'Apollo', 'very', 'unusual', 'unexpected', 'concert', 'band', 'would', 'choose', 'release', 'One', 'might', 'expect', 'Poison', 'release', 'DVD', 'more', 'recent', 'tour', 'more', 'less', 'nostalgia', 'act', 'release', 'DVD', '1990', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'tour', 'when', 'band', 'was', 'commercial', 'peak', 'show', '1993', 'totally', 'surprising', 'few', 'reasons.First', 'lineup', 'Poison', 'features', 'guitarist', 'Ritchie', 'Kotzen', 'stepping', 'C.C', 'Deville', 'who', 'left', 'Poison', '1991', '1996', 'Kotzen', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'album', 'Poison', '1993', 'mature', 'bluesy', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'being', 'fired', 'shagging', 'drummer', 'Rikki', 'Rocket', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'odd', 'release', 'DVD', 'Kotzen', 'considering', 'tenure', 'band', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'lived', 'classic', 'lineup', 'Poison', 'C.C.', 'hands', 'down', 'definitive', 'version', 'band.Another', 'reason', 'show', ""'93"", 'unusual', 'choice', 'set', 'list', 'relies', 'heavily', 'band', 'Native', 'Tongue', '1993', 'album', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'strong', 'well-written', 'album', 'was', 'relative', 'failure', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'was', 'band', 'first', 'album', 'failed', 'go', 'platinum', 'winding', 'up', 'dreaded', 'cut-out', 'bin', 'sitting', 'next', 'Vince', 'Neil', 'Exposed', '1993', 'Motley', 'Crue', '1994', 'self-titled', 'album', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'A', 'Little', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Enough', '1991', 'end', '1994', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'now', 'out-of-print', 'only', 'available', 'used', 'cut-out', 'odd', 'release', 'DVD', 'concert', 'showcasing', 'album', 'was', 'virtually', 'ignored', 'release', 'now', 'forgotten.All', 'taken', 'consideration', 'show', '1993', 'desirable', 'undesirable', 'depending', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'are', 'casual', 'fan', 'Poison', 'purist', 'want', 'show', 'hits', 'may', 'find', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'previously', 'stated', 'lot', 'songs', 'nearly', 'half', 'are', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'album', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'material', 'Also', 'Kotzen', 'far', 'more', 'technically', 'proficient', 'C.C', 'Deville', 'up', 'solos', 'C.C', 'material', 'purists', 'may', 'be', 'put-off', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'C.C', 'lead', 'guitar.But', 'other', 'fans', 'may', 'get', 'lot', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Poison', 'few', 'times', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'always', 'enjoy', 'show', 'am', 'disappointed', 'play', 'virtually', 'same', 'songs', 'time', 'band', 'frozen', '1990', 'Poison', 'show', '00s', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'most', 'definitely', 'nostalgia', 'act', 'DVD', 'great', 'see', 'band', 'out', 'promoting', 'fresh', 'material', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'album', 'great', 'hear', 'songs', 'performed', 'live', 'band', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'have', 'played', 'Stand', 'C.C', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Kotzen', 'interpretations', 'songs', 'find', 'be', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace.Recorded', 'London', 'Hammersmith', 'Apollo', 'April', '23', '1993', 'wildly', 'enthusiastic', 'sold-out', 'crowd', 'easy', 'forget', 'hall', 'most', 'audience', 'so', 'loved', 'Poison', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'were', 'now', 'listening', 'Nirvana', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'shame', 'Poison', 'never', 'really', 'survived', 'grunge', 'now', 'been', 'reduced', 'being', 'nostalgia', 'act', 'deserve', 'better', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'rehash', 'tired', 'formula', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'band', 'made', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'grow', 'artists', 'made', 'album', 'deserved', 'be', 'heard', 'shame', 'general', 'public', '1993', 'was', ""n't"", 'mature', 'enough', 'like', 'Poison', 'Nirvana', 'felt', 'had', 'abandon', 'one', 'embrace', 'few', 'hours', 'hall', 'several', 'thousand', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Poison', 'was', 'cool', 'not.The', 'actual', 'taping', 'show', 'superb', 'Shot', 'mostly', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'documentary', 'style', 'show', 'professionally', 'shot', 'great', 'Charismatic', 'frontman', 'Brett', 'Michaels', 'audience', 'palm', 'hand', 'rest', 'band', '100', 'percent.In', 'conclusion', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'album', 'more', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'are', 'familiar', 'lesser', 'known', 'material', 'Casual', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'big', 'hits', 'are', 'still', 'enough', 'big', 'hits', 'Every', 'Rose', 'Has', 'Thrown', 'Something', 'Believe', 'please', 'purists', 'still', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'Kotzen', 'interpretations']",N/A

967604,A235NA61RC6YC1,B000E3LD72,George Dionne,"[8, 13]","The GoodThe show itself is shot in a documentary style, sans backstage interviews. The majority of it is shot in color, with some artsy back and white shots thrown in here and there. Poison sounds great throughout their fifteen songs set. Ritchie Kotzen injects new life into the band with his tremendous guitar playing. It's apparent from the first solo that Kotzen is far superior to DeVille. Most notable, a lot less tremolo wails and a lot more technical playing.The set lays heavy on the Native Tongue material, so if you're not familiar with it, you probably won't like it. It was a lot less glam and more alternative. Only one or two of them ever make it to Poison's `hits' compilations. That's not to say that songs like ""The Scream,"" ""Body Talk,"" and ""7 Days Over You"" aren't good, they're just not what I think of when I think of Poison. ""Stand,"" which was also from that album, is really the only one that still follows the group. There's a splattering of their high energy hits that include, ""Ride the Wind,"" ""Fallen Angel,"" ""Unskinny Bop,"" and ""Nothin' But a Good Time.""The BadBy relying heavily on Native Tongue material, I just don't see a lot of interest in this.The VerdictI have been a fan of Poison since day one, but even I found it hard to swallow the alternative, ballad-ridden Poison era. I saw it as a `sell-out' attempt by Michael's to jump on the grunge wave (although his group was not the only one to try this). This show sounds great, but a lot of the material does nothing for me. Kotzen runs circles around DeVille, but it was DeVille's wackiness and complete lack of guitar knowledge that made him interesting.

I, for one had know idea that Poison was going to be releasing a concert dvd. It also struck be as odd, that this is from 1993's supporting tour for the Native Tongue album, which pretty much went straight to the cutout bin. I went ahead and bought this dvd, mainly out of curiosity. When I got to watch the dvd, I was very pleased with my purchase.While, some fans will be reluctant to buy a Poison dvd without C.C. on it, but Ritchie Kotzen is a good guitar player, and I don't think he really goes as good with the band as C.C.On Seven Days Live, Poison tears threw 6 or 7 tracks from Native Tongue, and about 7 or 8 songs from their first three albums. Most the classics like Every Rose, Nothin but a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, Unskinny Bop, and Look What the Cat Dragged In. Only missing one major hit, I Want Action, and a couple favorites like your Mama Don't Dance. The performances by the band are good.

While their popularity was almost gone in the states, the Brits seemed to really turn out and dig this concert throughout the DVD.The biggest treat to this DVD is, we get to see the band on the ""Native Tongue"" tour with guitarist Ritchie Kotzen. While most Poison fans detest all things Kotzen related, I actually dug what he brought to the band in 1993. The guy was a talented song writer and guitar player, and he more than handled C.C. Deville's parts in this DVD. Another shocker with this DVD release is that most of the songs represented here are from the aforementioned ""Native Tongue"", which we know didn't sell very well for Poison here in the states. To me, this is a real treat. We get to see them perform songs they probably have never performed since and probably never will again.The quality of the DVD is very cool as well. Some of the concert is in black & white, however most is in marvelous bright colors. The band also sounds very tight and business-like on this DVD.

Deville left the band, and once I did start to like the Native Tongue album, the more I started to love it. I found Richie Kotzen brought an intensity to the band that wasn't there before. If you listen to the way Bobby, Bret and Rikki play off of each other with Richie in the band, it's undeniable. He brought out the best in everyone. It's a shame how it ended, but onto the review of this dvd.I had my suspicions that this dvd would suck, and I was half right. Richie Kotzen live is an animal to say the least. He has some great presence, and some great licks. However, I found a few things lacking with this performance. I found Bobby and Rikki were the ones holding things together, or at least trying to background vocal wise. Richie seemed too occupied with his guitar playing to hold down any kind of background vocals, except on a few songs. You'd think with a great voice like Richie has, he'd want to utilize it live, but think again. This concert was well performed by Bret, Rikki and Bobby, but Richie only really soared on the Native Tongue tracks, which he cowrote. It seemed like he didn't care about doing any justice to any of the classic Poison songs.So now I'll do a track by track analysis, and give some thoughts on each.The Scream-Great opening number from the Native Tongue record. They really slam with this one. I think this is one of the best performances on the dvd.Strike Up The Band-Another great performance by all. It seems the Native Tongue stuff sounds really awesome live judging by the first 2 performances.Ride The Wind-Man, I can't stress how awful this sounds. Bret, Bobby and Rikki do their parts fine, but Richie massacres this one. He can't even play the main riff right. It's so bad that the riff barely even sounds like the same song.Good Love-This one kind of gets screwed up. Bret starts singing the second verse first, and then when he's supposed to sing the second verse, he repeats it again! Weird stuff. Overall though a pretty good performance, but I can't get past the vocal screwup.Body Talk-Another great song. Richie does change some solos on the Native Tongue songs, but they're his songs, so who cares really, cuz they still sound decent.Something To Believe In-I find Richie does a pretty good job in tapping into what the song is about. He changes the solo on this song, but for once I think he did a good job with it.Stand-This actually sounds pretty cool live. I was surprised. Without the choir vocals it still sounds good.Fallen Angel-I've always loved this song, but this performance is probably one of the least impressive tracks on here. Strong performance by Bret, Bobby and Rikki, though.Look What The Cat Dragged In-Finally a song that Kotzen didn't screw up. This one slams from start to finish.Until You Suffer Some-Another great performance. I liked that they included a good chunk from Native Tongue instead of relying heavily on the hits.7 Days Over You-This was a great addition. I never thought they'd play this one live, but it came off well, and sounded great.Unskinny Bop-This is probably one of the sleeper tracks. I don't remember much about this performance, so it must not have been all that great, and it's not one of my favourite songs anyway, so who cares right?Talk Dirty To Me-This performance was okay, but again nothing special.Every Rose Has It's Thorn-Richie again taps into the soul of this song, and also screws it up at the same time. I think it was solo #1 sounded amazong, and then solo #2 completely sucked! It goes to show you, if you try too hard you end up ruining the song.Nothing But A Good Time-Same Ol' Same Ol' as it says in the song. I wasn't at all impressed with any of the classic hits, and I think Kotzen is to blame. They didn't have that fire that they had with C.C. and it really shows with these live performances.I would recommend this dvd if you really love the Native Tongue album, but if you are in love with the classic lineup this dvd isn't for you. To hear Kotzen butcher the classic tunes is a bloody shame. I for one love the classic lineup, but also love the Native era lineup. I find their 2 best cd's are tied with Flesh & Blood and Native Tongue. So if you want something different check this out, but don't buy it expecting the classic songs to be played to perfection.I give them a 4 for effort because Bret, Bobby and Rikki play their hearts out on this. It's too bad it gets ruined by Kotzen. It wouldn't be so bad if he played the hits the way they're supposed to be played, rather than putting his own stamp on them.",4,Not what you might expect...,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,4619,"['took', 'long', 'time', 'open', 'up', 'new', 'Poison', 'lineup', 'C.C', 'Deville', 'left', 'band', 'once', 'did', 'start', 'like', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'album', 'more', 'started', 'love', 'found', 'Richie', 'Kotzen', 'brought', 'intensity', 'band', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'before', 'listen', 'way', 'Bobby', 'Bret', 'Rikki', 'play', 'other', 'Richie', 'band', 'undeniable', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'everyone', 'shame', 'how', 'ended', 'review', 'dvd.I', 'had', 'suspicions', 'dvd', 'would', 'suck', 'was', 'half', 'right', 'Richie', 'Kotzen', 'live', 'animal', 'say', 'least', 'great', 'presence', 'great', 'licks', 'However', 'found', 'few', 'things', 'lacking', 'performance', 'found', 'Bobby', 'Rikki', 'were', 'ones', 'holding', 'things', 'together', 'least', 'trying', 'background', 'vocal', 'wise', 'Richie', 'seemed', 'too', 'occupied', 'guitar', 'playing', 'hold', 'down', 'kind', 'background', 'vocals', 'few', 'songs', ""'d"", 'think', 'great', 'voice', 'Richie', ""'d"", 'want', 'utilize', 'live', 'think', 'again', 'concert', 'was', 'well', 'performed', 'Bret', 'Rikki', 'Bobby', 'Richie', 'only', 'really', 'soared', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'tracks', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'doing', 'justice', 'classic', 'Poison', 'songs.So', 'now', ""'ll"", 'do', 'track', 'track', 'analysis', 'give', 'thoughts', 'each.The', 'Scream-Great', 'opening', 'number', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'record', 'really', 'slam', 'one', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'dvd.Strike', 'Band-Another', 'great', 'performance', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'stuff', 'really', 'awesome', 'live', 'judging', 'first', '2', 'Wind-Man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'how', 'awful', 'Bret', 'Bobby', 'Rikki', 'do', 'parts', 'fine', 'Richie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'main', 'riff', 'right', 'so', 'bad', 'riff', 'barely', 'even', 'same', 'song.Good', 'Love-This', 'one', 'kind', 'screwed', 'up', 'Bret', 'singing', 'second', 'verse', 'first', 'then', 'when', 'supposed', 'sing', 'second', 'verse', 'again', 'Weird', 'stuff', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'vocal', 'screwup.Body', 'Talk-Another', 'great', 'song', 'Richie', 'change', 'solos', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'songs', ""'re"", 'songs', 'who', 'really', 'cuz', 'still', 'sound', 'decent.Something', 'Believe', 'In-I', 'find', 'Richie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'tapping', 'what', 'song', 'about', 'solo', 'song', 'once', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'it.Stand-This', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'live', 'was', 'surprised', 'choir', 'vocals', 'still', 'good.Fallen', 'Angel-I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'song', 'performance', 'probably', 'one', 'least', 'impressive', 'tracks', 'here', 'Strong', 'performance', 'Bret', 'Bobby', 'Rikki', 'though.Look', 'What', 'Cat', 'Dragged', 'In-Finally', 'song', 'Kotzen', 'did', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'one', 'slams', 'start', 'finish.Until', 'Suffer', 'Some-Another', 'great', 'performance', 'liked', 'included', 'good', 'chunk', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'instead', 'relying', 'heavily', 'hits.7', 'You-This', 'was', 'great', 'addition', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'play', 'one', 'live', 'came', 'off', 'well', 'sounded', 'great.Unskinny', 'Bop-This', 'probably', 'one', 'sleeper', 'tracks', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'performance', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'not', 'one', 'favourite', 'songs', 'anyway', 'who', 'right', 'Talk', 'Dirty', 'Me-This', 'performance', 'was', 'okay', 'again', 'nothing', 'special.Every', 'Rose', 'Has', 'Thorn-Richie', 'again', 'soul', 'song', 'also', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'solo', '1', 'sounded', 'amazong', 'then', 'solo', '2', 'completely', 'sucked', 'show', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'end', 'up', 'ruining', 'song.Nothing', 'Good', 'Time-Same', 'Ol', 'Same', 'Ol', 'song', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'classic', 'hits', 'think', 'Kotzen', 'blame', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fire', 'had', 'C.C', 'really', 'live', 'performances.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'really', 'love', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'album', 'are', 'love', 'classic', 'lineup', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Kotzen', 'classic', 'tunes', 'bloody', 'shame', 'one', 'love', 'classic', 'lineup', 'also', 'love', 'Native', 'era', 'lineup', 'find', '2', 'best', 'cd', 'are', 'tied', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'So', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'check', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'expecting', 'classic', 'songs', 'be', 'played', 'perfection.I', 'give', '4', 'effort', 'Bret', 'Bobby', 'Rikki', 'play', 'hearts', 'out', 'too', 'bad', 'ruined', 'Kotzen', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'played', 'hits', 'way', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'played', 'rather', 'putting', 'own', 'stamp']",N/A
