1213904,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B001L9EXSY,A. Boston,"[2, 4]","Unfortunately, we barely made it thru this whole movie. I personally liked Good Luck Chuck, as I have no issues with nasty humor and it usually totally entertains me.  I watched My Best Friend's Girl with my boyfriend, who loves funny movies -- he most recently favorite is step-brothers. I myself like romantic comedies and really like listening to Dane Cook's stand up stuff, so I thought it would be a great choice for both of us. We both watch a lot of movies and we're not above loving fun ""bad"" movies.I really like Kate Hudson & Dane Cook, I can deal with Jason Biggs. But this movie was just..boring and not funny!! My boyfriend looked even more bored then I did. I found myself going for the fastforward button and he would look at me with a sigh of relief.Dane Cook was over-done and trying to push boundaries but in the end just looked stupid. Jason Bigg's character was pathetic and I felt so bad for him that when awful things happened, it wasn't amusing. Kate Hudson was fine -- but she was just her typical character to be honest. Very similar to her other romantic comedies, she's the ""awesome hot girl"". The only thing I really enjoyed about it was that it was filmed and set in Boston, so it was fun recognizing where they were being we live here.It was predictable and not in a good way. I won't tell you how in case you're still looking forward to seeing this movie. The characters seemed to get in long drawn out talks and you knew where they were going so we skipped over a couple of conversations between Dane Cook and Alec Baldwin. We'd give it a chance to see if it'd be funny, but it wasn't -- so here comes the fast forwarding.In all, I don't think this movie not being good can be blamed on the cast. Cook and Hudson definitely had chemistry and did the best with what they were given. It was well cast and the directing was fine and it made Boston look gorgeous. It was most likely the writing and story -- can someone please come up with something thats original and NOT predictable?? I would really appreciate it. =)UPDATE: the special features were good. I really liked the one about filming in Boston and how Dane Cook was a real asset being he grew up in the area. There was also a cute one about the cast and crew's dating tips as well as one about proms and the prom scene of the movie. Sadly, there was no gag reel, which is something I really look forward to in the special features section of DVDs.",2,not funny.,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2437,"['Unfortunately', 'barely', 'made', 'thru', 'whole', 'movie', 'personally', 'liked', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'have', 'issues', 'nasty', 'humor', 'usually', 'totally', 'watched', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Girl', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'funny', 'movies', 'most', 'recently', 'favorite', 'step-brothers', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'really', 'like', 'listening', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'stand', 'up', 'stuff', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'choice', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', ""'re"", 'not', 'loving', 'fun', 'bad', 'movies.I', 'really', 'like', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'can', 'deal', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'movie', 'was', 'just..boring', 'not', 'funny', 'boyfriend', 'looked', 'even', 'more', 'bored', 'then', 'did', 'found', 'going', 'fastforward', 'button', 'would', 'look', 'sigh', 'relief.Dane', 'Cook', 'was', 'over-done', 'trying', 'push', 'boundaries', 'end', 'just', 'looked', 'stupid', 'Jason', 'Bigg', 'character', 'was', 'pathetic', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'awful', 'things', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'amusing', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'just', 'typical', 'character', 'be', 'honest', 'Very', 'similar', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'awesome', 'hot', 'girl', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', 'set', 'Boston', 'was', 'fun', 'recognizing', 'where', 'were', 'being', 'live', 'here.It', 'was', 'predictable', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'case', ""'re"", 'still', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'characters', 'seemed', 'get', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'talks', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'so', 'skipped', 'over', 'couple', 'conversations', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', ""'d"", 'give', 'chance', 'see', ""'d"", 'be', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'here', 'fast', 'forwarding.In', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'cast', 'Cook', 'Hudson', 'definitely', 'had', 'chemistry', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'directing', 'was', 'fine', 'made', 'Boston', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'writing', 'story', 'can', 'someone', 'please', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'thats', 'original', 'NOT', 'predictable', 'would', 'really', 'appreciate', 'UPDATE', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'good', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'filming', 'Boston', 'how', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'was', 'real', 'asset', 'being', 'grew', 'up', 'area', 'was', 'also', 'cute', 'one', 'cast', 'crew', 'dating', 'tips', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'proms', 'prom', 'scene', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'was', 'gag', 'reel', 'something', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'DVDs']",My Best Friend's Girl

Cook and Hudson are hilarious.  Yes, it's dirty, is that something new to people here?  Filthy humor has been in the movies for 40 years and more.To those here who walk out on movies in the middle, fast-forward through them, or in the case of one woman, HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT YET, I don't see how you can offer unbiased reviews.To me, it's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. With a fresh, clever premise and all the jokes that will easily flow from that premise.  Cook's best movie by far.If you think the first two American Pie movies are funny, you'll love this one, too.  If you think you are too ""evolved,"" this one ain't for you.  But it IS incredibly funny, not just because F-bombs are thrown around as on Def Comedy Jam (where there's no humor in curse words alone), but in this movie, it's within clever dialogue.You MUST get the UNRATED version; it is FAR funnier than the R-rated version. I've viewed both from beginning to end and compared them scene-for-scene where the differences occur, and there are LOTS of differences.  There is NO comparison between the two versions, the Unrated version is far, far funnier.

It's about an EXTREMELY obnoxious guy (played by Dane Cook's character) who does and says the worst things imaginable to every woman he goes out on a date with.Well, on one date he gets more than he ever expected (Kate Hudson's character).Now the storyline is a bit tricky to understand but let me explain it.Dane Cook's character has a friend, and this friend actually wants to be with Kate Hudson, but Kate apparently wants nothing to do with him as far as a serious relationship is concerned.So Dane and his friend come up with this brainstorm idea- in order for Kate's character to truly fall in love with Dane's friend, Dane Cook must go out on a date with Kate Hudson and act like his typically obnoxious jerk self.  The logic here is that Kate will find out how lucky she is to be with a sweet gentlemen (Dane's friend) and fall in love with him.What happens though, is a big surprise to Dane.  The storyline then develops from here.I really liked the majority of the jokes.  Dane Cook's character takes his obnoxiousness to a whole new level near the end of the storyline.

I have an average tolerance for lewdness as I can stand to watch Sex and the City but this is probably on the level of a real bloke's lewdness.  The vulgar language was also something to be grasped.  May be all of that was part of the supposed charm of the movie but I was not convinced - all the comedic drama I can manage but the vulgarity of it all made me think - was that reaaaally necessary to the story?  Not really.  I had to 'chunk' the movie into manageable bits and watch a little bit at a time - as that was all I can manage - but I did survive the movie to finish it (unlike Good Luck Chuck...Bleh!!!)  If you can manage to sift through all the vulgarity, there is a sweet story behind it all.  Dane Cook plays a professional jerk who helps blokes get their girls back but ends up falling in love with one of'em.  He also tries to do the right thing which was also a sweet touch.  Kate Hudson is a force to be reckoned with as she is beautiful.  But I think the terrible-ness of everything else kills the sweet story line.

Yet women ""say"" they ""really"" want a nice, sweet, romantic, respectful guy.

Dane Cook was only a name to this over-50 viewer; I have not seen (and won't seek, I don't think) his other starring vehicles.

And as maybe the only adult who has not endured any of the American Pie franchise, Jason Biggs was also new to me.....so, no preconceptions, no expectations.Well, I think you can get an accurate perception from the many reviews here. If you enjoy people saying outlandish things, especially to old women and kids, using profane language, and generally behaving as offensive and selfish jerks (the opposite kind of heartless jerk as The Wedding Crashers--over the top sludge instead of over the top loveydovey) then this is your kind of movie. If you expect something other than endless fish-very-out-of-water foul language, then, with a couple of surprising glimmers of humor, you will be bored.

1213952,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001L9EXSY,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`My Best Friends Girl' is an average comedy where a guy called Tank earns his money by going out with girls on dates and by giving them such a bad time they go running back to their ex boyfriends. Unfortunately, he does this for his best friend (Dustin) so he can win the girl (Alexis) of his dreams and ends up falling in love with her instead. This has some genuinely funny moments amidst some of the more cruder jokes and the bit where Tank dances at a prom is especially good. Alexis' roommate Ami is quite humorous as well and comes out with some funny lines. Alec Baldwin plays Tanks father and is an ageing lothario who taught Tank all he knew about women and although he is crass as hell, he also has some funny lines which will raise a chuckle. This has a good soundtrack with some standout songs by Teddy Thompson and Johnny Cash. This isn't the best comedy you will ever see and some of the more cruder jokes may make you cringe, but all in all it is a fairly innocuous way to spend an evening and will raise a laugh here and there. It is good, but not great.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",3,My Best Friends Girl,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1139,"['Best', 'Friends', 'Girl', 'average', 'comedy', 'where', 'guy', 'called', 'Tank', 'money', 'going', 'out', 'girls', 'dates', 'giving', 'bad', 'time', 'go', 'running', 'back', 'ex', 'boyfriends', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'friend', 'Dustin', 'can', 'win', 'girl', 'Alexis', 'dreams', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'instead', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'amidst', 'more', 'cruder', 'jokes', 'bit', 'where', 'Tank', 'prom', 'especially', 'good', 'Alexis', 'roommate', 'Ami', 'quite', 'humorous', 'well', 'out', 'funny', 'lines', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Tanks', 'father', 'ageing', 'lothario', 'who', 'taught', 'Tank', 'all', 'knew', 'women', 'crass', 'hell', 'also', 'funny', 'lines', 'will', 'raise', 'chuckle', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'standout', 'songs', 'Teddy', 'Thompson', 'Johnny', 'Cash', ""n't"", 'best', 'comedy', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'more', 'cruder', 'jokes', 'may', 'make', 'cringe', 'fairly', 'innocuous', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'will', 'raise', 'laugh', 'here', 'there', 'good', 'not', 'great.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",My Best Friend's Girl

I have read and heard how offensive this film is to some people but I would venture to say no one will be trying this film (now) that does not already know - if you get offended by chauvinism and egocentric male pigs in film, just skip this altogether. This is not a first date film, or a tenth date film, this is a Boston guys film all the way.The BD contains both the rated full screen 101 minute version (yeck) and the unrated wide screen 113 minute cut. I watched the extended cut and was very impressed with the quality. Lionsgate went all out on preserving a plethora of beautiful Boston exteriors and landscapes in hidef. Both the day and night wide shots looked extremely detailed and rich. The 7.1 was not used too extensively but when Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" song overtakes the channels (wedding scene) I was sold on this one. Admittedly, 2 Live Crew's overamped song in the car tested the higher channels, but with over 30 different songs listed, your system's speakers will get a decent workout.The featurettes total around 30 minutes and give some nice insight on Boston filming and production; 3 of the docus are short and forgettable on dating, chauvinism and prom stuff though. The deleted scenes could have been left in and would have made the film 2 hours long, but still laughable. I could not access the MoLog and associated features but they sound fascinating, including being able to import graphics and text into the film, along with the usual BDLive fun.I gave this a higher rating because of the whole BD package: great preservation, good sound, awesome soundtrack (especially with Cash and the Cars), funny/informative commentaries, and for making an obviously crude, yet laughable film. Be aware that you cannot play the menus in a mixed crowd either (offensive language and text on screen), and that would be the main shortcoming of the BD are the unfriendly menu navigation screens and no ""play all"" options in any of the screens. In other words, for the amount of extras and menus, you would think they would make them easier to navigate and use.",5,"Funny, offensive yet great Bostonian BD",1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,2265,"['have', 'not', 'been', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Dane', 'become', 'poisonous', 'rental/sales', 'revenue', 'lately', 'watching', 'comedy', 'have', 'different', 'appreciation', 'talents', 'have', 'read', 'heard', 'how', 'offensive', 'film', 'people', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'trying', 'film', 'now', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'get', 'offended', 'chauvinism', 'egocentric', 'male', 'pigs', 'film', 'just', 'skip', 'altogether', 'not', 'first', 'date', 'film', 'tenth', 'date', 'film', 'Boston', 'guys', 'film', 'way.The', 'BD', 'rated', 'full', 'screen', '101', 'minute', 'version', 'yeck', 'unrated', 'wide', 'screen', '113', 'minute', 'cut', 'watched', 'extended', 'cut', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'quality', 'Lionsgate', 'went', 'out', 'preserving', 'plethora', 'beautiful', 'Boston', 'exteriors', 'landscapes', 'hidef', 'day', 'night', 'wide', 'shots', 'looked', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'rich', '7.1', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'too', 'extensively', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Man', 'Around', 'song', 'channels', 'wedding', 'scene', 'was', 'sold', 'one', 'Admittedly', '2', 'Live', 'Crew', 'overamped', 'song', 'car', 'tested', 'higher', 'channels', '30', 'different', 'songs', 'listed', 'system', 'speakers', 'will', 'get', 'decent', 'workout.The', 'featurettes', 'total', '30', 'minutes', 'give', 'nice', 'insight', 'Boston', 'filming', 'production', '3', 'docus', 'are', 'short', 'forgettable', 'dating', 'chauvinism', 'prom', 'stuff', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'still', 'laughable', 'could', 'not', 'access', 'MoLog', 'associated', 'features', 'sound', 'fascinating', 'including', 'being', 'able', 'import', 'graphics', 'text', 'film', 'usual', 'BDLive', 'fun.I', 'gave', 'higher', 'rating', 'whole', 'BD', 'package', 'great', 'preservation', 'good', 'sound', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'especially', 'Cash', 'Cars', 'funny/informative', 'commentaries', 'making', 'obviously', 'crude', 'yet', 'laughable', 'film', 'Be', 'aware', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'menus', 'mixed', 'crowd', 'offensive', 'language', 'text', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'main', 'shortcoming', 'BD', 'are', 'unfriendly', 'menu', 'navigation', 'screens', 'play', 'options', 'screens', 'other', 'words', 'amount', 'extras', 'menus', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'easier', 'navigate', 'use']",My Best Friend's Girl

But... having watched this film, and a few others that Cook has been in (Good Luck Chuck and Employee of the Month come to mind), I think I may have to soften that stance and admit that occassionally I actually do find Dane Cook to be, well, funny.Cook's stand-up comedy is not funny to me, at least not regularly so.  I know he has fans, but I just don't care for his style and delivery and find his humor to be lacking in anything that would make me laugh.Take Cook and put him in the appropriate starring role though and I find myself laughing along with the crude humor (as in Good Luck Chuck and Employee of the Month), which is precisely the forumla that the team behind My Best Friend's Girl has gone for.Cook plays a character that proudly carries the a--hole tag as a badge of honor.  He works by referral to serve as a complete a--hole that takes a--hole to a whole new level.  I won't spoil the gags and bits, but if you watch the film you'll see how it all plays out and you too would recognize that Cook's character is intentionally behaving as an a--hole just so we can inspire the women that would be girlfriends or significant others for the guys that are paying for his services to run crying back into the arms of those guys.  After one horrible date with Cook the ladies he chooses to go out with typically call up their boyfriends and apologize profusely for having chased away those boyfriends somehow.  Basically Cook's character makes those women appreciate the guys that paid him to work on their behalf.The title of the film is My Best Friend's Girl so you know that somehow Cook will wind up with his best friend's girl.  Sure enough his overly sensitive best friend (American Pie's Jason Biggs) is hung up on one girl in particular that happens to be played by Kate Hudson.  When you have a resource such as Cook at your disposal and you are faced with the thought of being a creepy stalker or watching the girl you think you love go search for someone else, of course you convince your friend to work his magic for you.  Except, well, that magic doesn't seem to work as expected and Cook and Hudson may just wind up as more than friends.Cook definitely generates several laughs with his boorish and crude behavior along the way.  When he's 'in character' as an a--hole he goes all out with somewhat hilarious results.  Toss in the quirks of Biggs' character, and a small part that is played incredibly well by Alec Baldwin and you have a pretty funny, although crude, film.The picture quality is quite nice along the way, and the soundtrack is laden with several current tunes to enjoy, and also a bit of music to date by (you'll see what I mean if you watch) when Cook picks up his dates.  If you are going to watch this film, definitely go for the un-rated version for the extra laughs.As noted, the Blu-ray version comes with Digital Copy as a bonus.",4,"As the banner says, crude, lewd, rude and funny",1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,2967,"['Normally', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'statement', ""'m"", 'not', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'fan', 'Normally', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'few', 'others', 'Cook', 'been', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'Employee', 'Month', 'come', 'mind', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'soften', 'stance', 'admit', 'occassionally', 'actually', 'do', 'find', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'be', 'well', 'funny.Cook', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'not', 'funny', 'least', 'not', 'regularly', 'so', 'know', 'fans', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'style', 'delivery', 'find', 'humor', 'be', 'lacking', 'anything', 'would', 'make', 'laugh.Take', 'Cook', 'put', 'appropriate', 'starring', 'role', 'find', 'laughing', 'along', 'crude', 'humor', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'Employee', 'Month', 'precisely', 'forumla', 'team', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Girl', 'gone', 'for.Cook', 'character', 'proudly', 'hole', 'tag', 'badge', 'honor', 'referral', 'serve', 'complete', 'hole', 'hole', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'gags', 'bits', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'out', 'too', 'would', 'recognize', 'Cook', 'character', 'intentionally', 'behaving', 'hole', 'just', 'can', 'inspire', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'girlfriends', 'significant', 'others', 'guys', 'are', 'paying', 'services', 'run', 'crying', 'back', 'arms', 'guys', 'one', 'horrible', 'date', 'Cook', 'ladies', 'go', 'out', 'typically', 'call', 'up', 'boyfriends', 'apologize', 'profusely', 'having', 'chased', 'away', 'boyfriends', 'somehow', 'Basically', 'Cook', 'character', 'women', 'appreciate', 'guys', 'paid', 'work', 'behalf.The', 'title', 'film', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Girl', 'know', 'somehow', 'Cook', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'Sure', 'enough', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'best', 'friend', 'American', 'Pie', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'hung', 'up', 'one', 'girl', 'particular', 'be', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'When', 'have', 'resource', 'such', 'Cook', 'disposal', 'are', 'faced', 'thought', 'being', 'creepy', 'stalker', 'watching', 'girl', 'think', 'love', 'go', 'search', 'someone', 'else', 'course', 'convince', 'friend', 'work', 'magic', 'well', 'magic', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'expected', 'Cook', 'Hudson', 'may', 'just', 'wind', 'up', 'more', 'friends.Cook', 'definitely', 'several', 'laughs', 'boorish', 'crude', 'behavior', 'way', 'When', ""'in"", 'character', 'hole', 'somewhat', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Toss', 'quirks', 'Biggs', 'character', 'small', 'part', 'played', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'have', 'pretty', 'funny', 'crude', 'film.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'nice', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'laden', 'several', 'current', 'tunes', 'enjoy', 'also', 'bit', 'music', 'date', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'when', 'Cook', 'up', 'dates', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'film', 'definitely', 'go', 'un-rated', 'version', 'extra', 'laughs.As', 'noted', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'bonus']",My Best Friend's Girl
