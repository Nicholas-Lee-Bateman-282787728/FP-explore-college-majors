1043063,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000M341T6,Brett Corkins,"[1, 4]","I won't deny, I was really looking forward to seeing Roman, even despite the unfavorable reviews. I loved May and was sure a follow-up couldn't be all bad. Boy, was I wrong.Roman is terrible. Not once was I worried or dreading what might come next, not once did I even have a question as to what would happen at the end--it's very obvious--and not once did I think, ""This is actually a pretty good movie."" Quite the contrary really. Pretty much, Roman is one of the most predictable movies I've seen in recent memory. Hands down.Roman is obsessed with the girl in the apartment across from his. Everyday at 5:32pm he opens his shades and sits at his window to watch her (Kristen Bell) walk by to get her mail. Every once in a while he'll work up the nerve to go to the mail box too just to get a closer look. Then she (I call her 'she' because she was never given a name) made the mistake of talking to him. Cut to about 25 minutes later and a new girl, Eva (played brilliantly by Nectar Rose), comes into play. Her and Roman start a relationship, blah blah blah, something happens.For me, the ONLY redeeming thing about this movie was the women involved. Kristen Bell was terrific in the extremely brief time she was in it--her explanation of how pork and beans are made is hilarious--and Nectar Rose, whom I've never heard of, played the quirky, eccentric, Eva with ease. That's it. Lucky Mckee was incredibly bland as Roman, which yes, feels right for the character, but didn't help the finished product. As far as the random scenes from the breakroom at Roman's job, they seem pointless with horrid acting.For those on the fence about whether to watch this or not, don't. Even I, a huge Kristen Bell fan, say nay. She's not in it long enough to warrant a view. Nothing about this movie leaves a lasting impression past the fact of how mad you'll probably be after watching it, inevitably thinking ""Seriously, why did I pay money to see this?"" This is nothing like May, don't even think that. Roman is a loser who, even at his best, isn't the least bit interesting.

OK.Roman spends his days working at a metal shop,With no TV in his apartment, he spends his afternoons staring out his front window,Staring at a world he wants to be apart of,Staring at the same girl everyday.Is he lonely, or is he in love?  Or maybe he's just obsessed?Angela Bettis & Lucky McKee reverse roles in what is essentially the same movie as ""May""I would really prefer to see Lucky direct, but I'll take what I can get.At first glance this movie appears to be shot on a home camcorder.But after the first few scenes it gets better(Or maybe I just got used to it, I don't know)Anyway it starts off really slow,but if you stay with it,you'll be rewarded when it finally picks itself upJust when you think this flick can't get any duller, your heart does a double back-flip with a half gainer into your throat.That's when you're hooked.And when the narrative starts, (Halfway through the movie mind you.) your eyes are glued wide-open.Now for the details:The acting is enjoyable, great characters galore. (I love the nature chick) & Lucky does a better job than you'd think he would.The lighting leaves alot to be desired, but it's forgivable.Despite the unnecessary, trippy dream sequences it's a good story, starts out slow but keeps you interested & wondering what'll happen next.My only complaint is that the dialogue is ridiculously low, while the soundtrack is amazingly loud, so you'll have to keep playing with the volume throughout the entire movie.The bad news is there's no blood in sight,But the good news is there are 2 emotional death scenes to speak of, and alot of off-screen :(  mutilations.And the ending is pure poetic justice.In conclusion:Yeah, it's kinda slow, and it takes it's time ambling to it's point, but it gets there, and gets the job done.It's definitely an aquired taste, hence all the negative reviews.If you haven't seen ""May"", watch that one first, it's superior, and you'll know what you're diving into with this flick.MORAL OF THE STORY:'Tis better to have loved & killed than never to have killed at all.",4,"If ""May"" Was a Guy Named ""Roman""",1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,2116,"['Here', 'boring', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'ready', 'May', 'Want', 'one', 'OK.Roman', 'days', 'working', 'metal', 'shop', 'TV', 'apartment', 'afternoons', 'staring', 'out', 'front', 'window', 'Staring', 'world', 'be', 'apart', 'Staring', 'same', 'girl', 'everyday.Is', 'lonely', 'love', 'maybe', 'just', 'obsessed', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'reverse', 'roles', 'what', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'May', 'would', 'really', 'prefer', 'see', 'Lucky', 'direct', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get.At', 'first', 'glance', 'movie', 'be', 'shot', 'home', 'camcorder.But', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'better', 'maybe', 'just', 'got', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Anyway', 'really', 'slow', 'stay', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'when', 'finally', 'upJust', 'when', 'think', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'duller', 'heart', 'double', 'back-flip', 'half', 'gainer', 'throat.That', 'when', ""'re"", 'hooked.And', 'when', 'narrative', 'starts', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'mind', 'eyes', 'are', 'glued', 'wide-open.Now', 'details', 'acting', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'characters', 'galore', 'love', 'nature', 'chick', 'Lucky', 'better', 'job', ""'d"", 'think', 'lighting', 'leaves', 'alot', 'be', 'desired', 'forgivable.Despite', 'unnecessary', 'trippy', 'dream', 'good', 'story', 'out', 'slow', 'interested', 'wondering', 'what', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'next.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'dialogue', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'soundtrack', 'amazingly', 'loud', ""'ll"", 'have', 'keep', 'playing', 'volume', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'bad', 'news', 'blood', 'sight', 'good', 'news', 'are', '2', 'emotional', 'death', 'scenes', 'speak', 'alot', 'off-screen', 'mutilations.And', 'ending', 'pure', 'poetic', 'justice.In', 'conclusion', 'Yeah', 'kinda', 'slow', 'time', 'ambling', 'point', 'there', 'job', 'done.It', 'definitely', 'aquired', 'taste', 'hence', 'negative', 'reviews.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'May', 'watch', 'one', 'first', 'superior', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'diving', 'flick.MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', ""'T"", 'better', 'have', 'loved', 'killed', 'never', 'have', 'killed']",N/A

Most of the story occurs in a sleazy, low-rent apartment complex and the shabby ambiance rings true. With outstanding camera work, lighting, and an amazing musical score by Jaye Barnes/Poperratic, the descent into true psychosis rings true.  Especially chilling is the bizarre black and white cartoon of a skeletal boy on a ghost horse that the anti-hero watches.What's great about ""Roman"" is that this no formulaic movie where you can figure out every twist of the plot before it happens. You're kept being surprised througout and thanks to Lucky McKee's extraordinary portrait of a psycho, you're enwrapped in this eerie, dark little world.Nectar Rose, an unknown actress to me, is perfect as Eva, the dream girl.What's also striking is Angela Bettis' technique of using very short scenes, some lasting only a few seconds as we watch Roman's steady slide into insanity.This is a true treat for any movie psycho fan who seeks an outstanding film experience.Bettis proves once and for all that to create a movie triumph like this gem,  you don't need multi-million dollar budgets and big name stars.

An isolated, sad, socially awkward young man works at a factory where he has no friends, and lives alone in a depressing apartment.  His only joy is watching a beautiful young neighbor he fantasizes about.  In a stroke of luck he ends up on a date with her, but things go horribly, tragically wrong.  Before long he has struck up a relationship with a new, free-spirited but death obsessed young artist who has moved into the building, but he remains unable to fully invest himself in the relationship, largely for fear of things going wrong again.The film was shot on low quality video, and looks very rough, but there are times when that adds to the intimate &#8216;reality&#8217; feel.  At other times it just looks a little cheap.  There&#8217;s a surprising amount of humor, and Lucky McKee, who wrote the script as well as playing the lead does a good job a creating a very strange protagonist you still find yourself feeling for.  Certainly this has it&#8217;s fair share of flaws, and moments that don&#8217;t quite come off, but it has originality and bravery on it&#8217;s side, and in it&#8217;s best moments it achieves a sort of David Lynch vibe.

Along comes a good looking neighbor, whom Roman watches every late afternoon, after coming home from his boring welding job.  What could have been a good story quickly become rahter trivial.  Roman accidently kills his new (girl)friend, and tries (literally) to cover it up.  This wouldn't have been a bad story line, although by itself, it would be far to plain.  So in comes another good looking girl, who shows a considerable amount of interest in Roman.  Again, he takes his chances with her.

1043079,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B000M341T6,Michael R Gates,"[1, 2]","Though it is often touted by fans as a gender-reversed companion piece to Lucky McKee's contemporary psychological thriller MAY (2002), the 2006 film ROMAN is less a study of a loner's descent into madness and more a story of how a shy outcast's quest for companionship turns him into a tragic victim of circumstance.  Like MAY, this film is scripted by McKee--who also stars in the titular role--but behind the camera, the reigns are in the hands of first-time director Angela Bettis, a longtime collaborator of McKee's and star of his earlier film MAY.  As Roman, McKee is not as engagingly bizarre as Bettis' May, but he nonetheless creates an affecting and sympathetic portrait of a shy loner who unwittingly surrenders his fate to a quirky female companion.  And in many ways, this makes the film seem more realistic and believable than MAY.  Also, Bettis' tight, restrained directorial style almost gives the film a documentary feel, which underscores McKee's melancholy, matter-of-fact performance and, in turn, heightens the overall sense of realism.The DVD edition of ROMAN from Echo Bridge offers the film at its original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but the transfer is not, unfortunately, anamorphic.  On the other hand, the picture quality is decent, and the Dolby Pro Logic soundtrack is crisp and clear.  DVD extras are somewhat sparse, though there is a feature commentary are some interviews with cast members.ROMAN may not be as quirky or as frightening as the McKee-directed MAY, but it is still a wonderfully acted and emotionally moving character study that has some genuinely creepy moments.  In short, fans of McKee and Bettis will definitely appreciate the film and will want to add it to their collections, but other cinephiles and horror fans will also find it compelling and worth a watch.",4,A MAY-like ROMANce?,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,1822,"['often', 'touted', 'fans', 'gender-reversed', 'companion', 'piece', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'contemporary', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'MAY', '2002', '2006', 'film', 'ROMAN', 'less', 'study', 'loner', 'descent', 'madness', 'more', 'story', 'how', 'shy', 'outcast', 'quest', 'companionship', 'tragic', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'MAY', 'film', 'scripted', 'McKee', 'who', 'also', 'titular', 'role', 'camera', 'reigns', 'are', 'hands', 'first-time', 'director', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'McKee', 'star', 'earlier', 'film', 'MAY', 'Roman', 'McKee', 'not', 'engagingly', 'bizarre', 'Bettis', 'May', 'nonetheless', 'affecting', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'shy', 'loner', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'fate', 'quirky', 'female', 'companion', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable', 'MAY', 'Also', 'Bettis', 'tight', 'restrained', 'directorial', 'style', 'almost', 'film', 'documentary', 'feel', 'McKee', 'melancholy', 'matter-of-fact', 'performance', 'turn', 'overall', 'sense', 'realism.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'ROMAN', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'film', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'transfer', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'anamorphic', 'other', 'hand', 'picture', 'quality', 'decent', 'Dolby', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'soundtrack', 'crisp', 'clear', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'sparse', 'feature', 'commentary', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members.ROMAN', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quirky', 'as', 'frightening', 'McKee-directed', 'MAY', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'character', 'study', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'short', 'fans', 'McKee', 'Bettis', 'will', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collections', 'other', 'cinephiles', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'compelling', 'watch']",N/A

Five bucks for eight feature length films to maybe fuel my future ghost - and, speaking of ghosts and loving Halloween as I do, how therefore could I resist?  After having watched a tepid five of the eight I had no high hopes for the next one - ROMAN - but if it was anything like the previous ones, at least it'd be entertaining, even if minimally. And the transfers were surprisingly good, unlike so many cheapo compendiums concocted from the poorest of sources.So the movie started - and I knew absolutely nothing about it except the title - and the first thought that popped into my head with the title was Roman Polanski.  Little did I know that this ROMAN would have much in common with Polanski's superb REPULSION.  Anyway, I fell under the slow, hypnotic spell of ROMAN and the deeper I got into it the more I hoped it wouldn't stumble and fall and end up a washout.  Well, the credits rolled and I can in all honesty say that this movie is arguably the  best movie I have seen in a very long time.  It is, in its own manner, a damn masterpiece!If Edgar Poe were alive in our times and he was a screenwriter and director...this is the kind of movie he would make.  Oh, let me throw in a Spoiler Alert here - because this is a movie that one should watch with, ideally, knowing absolutely nothing about it.  As I myself watched it.  And one should know upfront that ROMAN is not primarily a horror film at all. Rather it is a very dark romance.  It is a poem filled with pain and pathos. It is a wonderfully acted, expertly directed, hauntingly scored and deeply felt and written film that addresses the largest issues of life, love, loneliness, loss and death.  Poe's themes are all here, brought up-to-date: isolation, madness, Poe's most poetical subject of all - the death of a beautiful woman, murder, dismemberment, suicide. And yet, when all is done, the movie is untimately...a love story!After watching the movie, I did some googling and found out that the extremely insightful screenwriter and totally convincing star, one Lucky McKee, has a cult following.  Prior to this film, I had never heard of him - or the director Angela Bettis - or the movie MAY which McKee wrote and directed and which starred Angela Bettis.  And I had never seen Nectar Rose, the Poe-esque female lead in ROMAN, before - but once having seen her she is near impossible to forget.  She is a knockout - in addition to being a terrific actor.  Anyway, now that I am aware of the work of these truly talented folks, I have ordered ROMAN as the single DVD with extras I am anxious to watch.  I also ordered MAY and another McKee film called THE WOMAN.The five or so bucks I spent on that eight film, two disc set in Shop-Rite were the best five bucks I have spent in some time - for, once again, ROMAN is one of the better films I have seen in ages.  One thing:  it is NOT for everyone.  It is NOT gratuitous in any way, as are the majority of ""horror"" films made in the last forty years or so.  What it is is a deep and dark vision dealing with the most important and vital urges and needs of Life.  Not to be missed!P.S.

1043083,A311XX0ZTZGY7H,B000M341T6,Styles1333,"[3, 4]","I will be honest.  This movie came in a set with 3 other horror movies (titled CLASSIC horror movies) for $5 so in that case, it was hit and miss if this movie would be good or not.  The plot as to what the movie was about seemed interesting when I read it on the cover, but I felt this movie was horrible, mainly the plot.  The acting itself was fine.  Kristen Bell's character was very lively and funny, especially that part about the baked beans. Lucky McKee, whom I've never heard of, played his very odd, weird, strange character Roman fine and Nectar Rose, whom I've also never heard of, played Eva, who was also a lively character.  The acting was overall okay, nothing really to complain about.  That's really the only reason I gave it 2 stars/5.  There were just some little things I didn't like:I didn't like how this movie was called a horror movie because there really wasn't anything scary about it at all.  Roman kills his neighbor (Kristen Bell), and then at the end Eva (Nectar Rose) kills herself basically after Roman unknowing verbally agrees to it.  To me, a horror movie actually has parts of the movie that randomly happen to scare you, or if there is an eventual death, it has good buildup to it.  None of that occurs in this movie.  In this movie, Roman does hear these voices on occasion in his head, but it's basically his obsession thoughts or him thinking to himself what he should do next.  He occasionally has brief flashbacks of the girl he killed.  However, it's nothing at all that gets your heart racing, it's basically guilt.  So I don't see where the horror comes into play.I know this was a low budget movie, but still, the way this movie was filmed, it only had like 6 scenery places...Roman welding, Roman in breakroom with co-workers, Roman in apartment room, Roman sitting on rooftop, and Roman seeing Eva's place for the first time.  Each of these same places constantly come back so it really makes it a dull atmosphere.  Also, add that the lack of suspense and boring dialogue make it rather boring.  You can look at a non horror film like Phonebooth...even though it mainly takes place in or near the phonebooth, there is a lot of suspense and things going on around to keep you wanting to pay attention. This movie just lacks it.This movie would've been a lot more interesting if they had either simply had Roman have nightmares where Kristen Bell was haunting and torturing him and somehow coming back to kill him, or perhaps even had Eva actually been Kristen Bell's sister and tried to attach herself to Roman and exact her revenge at the end of the movie by killing him instead of how she just randomly killed herself.  I admit the ending was kind of surprising, but it was just unnecessarily random and pointless.Overall, this movie is not a horror movie by any means and is very dull.  I honestly wouldn't recommend this one",2,Not a horror film and different in a bad way?,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2876,"['will', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'came', 'set', '3', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'titled', 'CLASSIC', 'horror', 'movies', '5', 'so', 'case', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'plot', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'when', 'read', 'cover', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'mainly', 'plot', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'lively', 'funny', 'especially', 'part', 'baked', 'beans', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'played', 'very', 'odd', 'weird', 'strange', 'character', 'Roman', 'fine', 'Nectar', 'Rose', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'heard', 'played', 'Eva', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'lively', 'character', 'acting', 'was', 'overall', 'okay', 'nothing', 'really', 'complain', 'about', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars/5', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'scary', 'Roman', 'neighbor', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'then', 'end', 'Eva', 'Nectar', 'Rose', 'basically', 'Roman', 'unknowing', 'verbally', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', 'parts', 'movie', 'randomly', 'happen', 'scare', 'eventual', 'death', 'good', 'buildup', 'None', 'movie', 'movie', 'Roman', 'hear', 'voices', 'occasion', 'head', 'basically', 'obsession', 'thoughts', 'thinking', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'next', 'occasionally', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'girl', 'killed', 'However', 'nothing', 'heart', 'racing', 'basically', 'guilt', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'horror', 'play.I', 'know', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'still', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'only', 'had', '6', 'scenery', 'places', 'Roman', 'welding', 'Roman', 'breakroom', 'co-workers', 'Roman', 'apartment', 'room', 'Roman', 'sitting', 'rooftop', 'Roman', 'seeing', 'Eva', 'place', 'first', 'time', 'same', 'places', 'constantly', 'come', 'back', 'really', 'dull', 'atmosphere', 'Also', 'add', 'lack', 'suspense', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'make', 'rather', 'boring', 'can', 'look', 'non', 'horror', 'film', 'Phonebooth', 'even', 'mainly', 'place', 'phonebooth', 'lot', 'suspense', 'things', 'going', 'keep', 'wanting', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'just', 'it.This', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'simply', 'had', 'Roman', 'have', 'nightmares', 'where', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'was', 'haunting', 'torturing', 'somehow', 'coming', 'back', 'kill', 'perhaps', 'even', 'had', 'Eva', 'actually', 'been', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'sister', 'tried', 'attach', 'Roman', 'exact', 'revenge', 'end', 'movie', 'killing', 'instead', 'how', 'just', 'randomly', 'killed', 'admit', 'ending', 'was', 'kind', 'surprising', 'was', 'just', 'unnecessarily', 'random', 'pointless.Overall', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'means', 'very', 'dull', 'honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

It is a rather dark look into the life of someone who could be your normal 'shy guy'.  However, this one's got a secret that he's now got to punish himself for.  The movie moves a little slowly, but definitely gives itself time to build up the characters (not hard, considering it's focused on 'Roman' (Lucky McGee), who gets almost all the screen time).  By the end of the film, I was really starting to feel for the character and hoping to see things go his way, despite his issues.  I have watched this movie a few times now, and will be continuing to do so quite a few more...and am looking forward to the regular DVD release so I can check out the bonus features.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves horror, as well as general fans of Lucky McGee or Angela Bettis.  Glad to see another good one come out!",5,Definitely an interesting film,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,898,"['feel', 'very', 'fortunate', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'grab', 'promo', 'copy', 'film', 'rather', 'dark', 'look', 'life', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'normal', ""'shy"", 'guy', 'However', 'one', 'got', 'secret', 'now', 'got', 'punish', 'movie', 'little', 'slowly', 'definitely', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'characters', 'not', 'hard', 'considering', 'focused', ""'Roman"", 'Lucky', 'McGee', 'who', 'almost', 'screen', 'time', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'starting', 'feel', 'character', 'hoping', 'see', 'things', 'go', 'way', 'issues', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'continuing', 'do', 'so', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'regular', 'DVD', 'release', 'so', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'bonus', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'fans', 'Lucky', 'McGee', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Glad', 'see', 'good', 'one', 'come', 'out']",N/A
