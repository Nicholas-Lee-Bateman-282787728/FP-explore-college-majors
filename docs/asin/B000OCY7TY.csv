I thought this movie would turn out like the book that I read in High School, but it SUCKED! It was like they didn't care enough about the central points that made the book work in the first place. I feel that the movie ripped me off because the characters in it didn't connect to the book at all! First of all, there's Agnes Bruckner, who played Vivian. She looked nothing like the ""Vivian"" in the book, her agenda and motivation were not the same,her personality was completely different from the book,her performance in the movie was poor in that Agnes just wasn't in character most of the time. The script was very stale and terrible! My imagination longed for more drama and accuracy. The red-haired woman who played Esme` underplayed the character(for whom was the most important hench-villaness in the book).  Everybody's acting in this movie was just too flat in general!Whatever you do, avoid this movie like the plague! This movie wasn't even scary or clever.

This is in fact a Romeo and Juliet / West Side Story sort of film, the young man (Hugh Dancy) being the black sheep of his family, while his love interest (Agnes Bruckner) is a wolf in girl's clothing.  You don't get much more opposite than carnivore and meat, but attract they do, much to the dismay of her pack, especially the leader, Gabriel (Olivier Martinez).In this film, werewolves in their human form jump around like crouching tigers and hidden dragons. They transform at will by leaping or twisting creatively through the air, emerging in lupine form from a blazing streak of luminous light.  The sight or smell of blood causes their pupils to glow with a weird yellowish tinge, and as you know, amber means ""caution"".As Duran Duran might have sung in ""Hungry Like the Wolf"":Sharpen the silver, light up a pyreWolves in the city, eyes are on fireDo do do do do do dodo dododo dodoAiden, he wants her, shows her a signBut when he's bleeding it sends chills up her spineDo do do do do do dodo dododo dodoOther than Bruckner, the acting isn't the best, even for a werewolf movie, and you'll find it's less like ""An American Werewolf in London"" and more like ""Teen Wolf"".Amanda Richards, July 14, 2007",3,Just give me the chocolate,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,1370,"['movie', 'based', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'major', 'changes', 'plot', ""'re"", 'looking', 'traditional', 'gory', 'werewolf', 'film', 'look', 'further', 'fact', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', '/', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'sort', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'being', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'love', 'interest', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'wolf', 'girl', 'clothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'more', 'opposite', 'carnivore', 'meat', 'do', 'much', 'dismay', 'pack', 'especially', 'leader', 'Gabriel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', '.In', 'film', 'werewolves', 'human', 'form', 'jump', 'crouching', 'tigers', 'hidden', 'dragons', 'transform', 'will', 'leaping', 'twisting', 'creatively', 'air', 'emerging', 'lupine', 'form', 'blazing', 'streak', 'luminous', 'light', 'sight', 'smell', 'blood', 'causes', 'pupils', 'glow', 'weird', 'yellowish', 'tinge', 'know', 'amber', 'caution', '.As', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'might', 'have', 'sung', 'Hungry', 'Wolf', 'Sharpen', 'silver', 'light', 'up', 'pyreWolves', 'city', 'eyes', 'are', 'fireDo', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'dodo', 'dododo', 'dodoAiden', 'signBut', 'when', 'bleeding', 'up', 'spineDo', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'do', 'dodo', 'dododo', 'dodoOther', 'Bruckner', 'acting', ""n't"", 'best', 'even', 'werewolf', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'less', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'more', 'Teen', 'Wolf', '.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '14', '2007']",N/A

Among all monster/creature movies this is one of the best. ""Big Bad Wolf, Dog Soldiers and The Howling"" are the three best Werewolf movies of all time. ""B & C"" ranks right up there at No.1. I love the type of horror movie that concentrates more on the story, than the monster. Even though ""Dog Soldiers and BBW"" had excellent special effects, the use of regular wolves in this movie did not hurt ""B & C"" at all. The ""young lovers forbidden from being together"" angle, though done a thousand times, was beautiful. Hugh Dancy and Agnes Bruckner were perfect in their interpretation of Romeo and Juliet. Oliver Martinez, as the patriarch of the werewolf klan held a foboding presence whenever he appeared on screen. His charismatic ""enemy of the good guy/girl"" vs Hugh Dancy as the young hero was a perfect match. Martinez' evil did not antagonistically snatch at the audience.Don't look for the 8ft werewolf that you find im almost all other werewolf movies. Lookfk for a great transition from human to wolf though as the body motions of the actors jell perfectly into the shinning light before they are transformed into regular wolves. The regular wolf look will also make one concentrate more on the stories that the wolves just happen to be a part of. Agnes Bruckner was good as a brooding, bordering on depressed ""waiting for the fire in her life"" werewolfet. Any more depressed though and she would have taken from the ""rescue me from my life please"" beauty waiting for her heroic beau. Their ""stay at arms length, I wish I had, I love you regardless"" romance was done to perfection.Martinez's son(I do not know the name of the actor)was the perfect little menace, best described as ""a little snot"". His rebellious, no matter what, face was perfect and will get him many similar jobs in the future. It doesn't hurt that he is extremely talented as the ""leader of the ""Jr. wolf pack"". I do not know what Hollywood calls it, but the non-vivid colors of the entire movie and the perfect visuals of Romania added to the dread of a ""werewolf"" tale. This movie goes to show what I have always beleived; If you have a good horror-romance /slasher flick, you do not need all the blood,entrails and popping eyeballs. This story is not new, but the enjoyment is. I would recommend it, not just to werewolf fans,not just to horror fans, not just to slasher fans, but to all other movie fans.

First off, if you are going to be using parts of the book and not even follow the whole story, and change things that were in the book. Then don't call it ""Blood and Chocolate"". Just say that it's ""loosely"" based on the book, which in fact it is. I was so disappointed in this movie. I thought for sure it was going to be good, since when i was in high school i loved the book. But no, i was gravely disappointed in this Hollywood POS. Secondly, the book was for a young reader, like the Twilight series. Though an adult could read the Twilight series and Blood and Chocolate and still enjoy it. They cast actors that are in their late twenties to early thirties. Hell i think Olivier Martinez is around 40 or older. They needed a much younger cast. They decided to base the movie in another frigging country, when really it was based in the United States. They have Vivian work in a chocolate shop, when in the book she didn't. There are just so many flaws in that movie, its laughable. If you've never read the book Blood and Chocolate, then you might enjoy the movie. But don't watch the movie, then read the book, because you'll probably hate the movie afterward. This movie could have been so much better than what they did to it. If i was the author i would be embarressed to see this movie. Also when you name a book ""Blood and Chocolate"" and describe what the blood and chocolate stands for in the book, than the reader understands why you named it that way. When you decide to make it a movie, then don't name the movie ""Blood and Chocolate"" because even i, who read the book, is going to think a name like that is laughable, especially when you see the previews. If i filmed this movie, i would have tried to put in as much as i could from the book and i might have titled it ""Vivian"" since she is the main character in the book and the movie.

The unconvincing cast causes the film to fall flat on more than one occasion, especially throughout the passionless performances by the two young lovers. In the rush to introduce the players and establish the growing conflict within the pack, director Katja von Garnier neglects to develop any form of rapport between Agnes Bruckner and Hugh Dancy, and even less of an emotional connection between the characters and the audience.

This is something I initially didn't think possible, considering how classic stories like ""The Wolf Man"" portray werewolves as unsympathetic monsters. But on reflection, such an idea makes perfect sense: werewolves are shunned by human society due to their ravenous canine appetites, making any attempt at coexistence seem pointless and subtracting; likewise, werewolves are forced to live as outcasts merely for trying to survive. While ""Blood and Chocolate"" doesn't explore this theme in depth, enough is given to make the message clear to the audience. However, I can't say whether or not this makes the film good; it has some glaring flaws, most notably the fact that the entire werewolf mythos is barely developed.Nonetheless, I'll go out on a limb and give the film four stars. I think what I found most enticing was the character of Vivian (Agnus Bruckner), who's full of teenage angst despite being in her early twenties. The film begins ten years ago in Denver, Colorado, where we see Vivian's parents murdered by a heavily armed group of men. We have yet to understand why such a terrible thing has happened; all we're initially told is that, in the present day, she lives in Romania with her aunt, Astrid (Katja Riemann). We also learn that she's a Rougarou--another term for a werewolf--the descendent of a long line of canine hunters. Contrary to popular belief, Rougarous are not affected by the full moon, and they have complete control over when and where they transform.Unfortunately, being a Rougarou has its drawbacks, the most obvious one being they have to hide their true natures from the human population. They're also a traditional race of beings, adhering strictly to the belief that werewolves can only be romantically involved with werewolves. The reason is simple: if involved with a human, a Rougarou risks exposure and the possibility of extinction. But for Vivian, these rigid restrictions pale in comparison to the belief that she's mentioned in an ancient prophesy. Apparently, she will one day lead Rougarous into a new age of hope, free from the fear, pain, and hopelessness they've had to endure. Because of this, her future has already been planned; she's been chosen to be the mate of Gabriel (Olivier Martinez), the current leader of the pack. (I found this a little odd; Gabriel is also Astrid's lover, and their son is Vivian's cousin. Is incest always necessary in such stories?)As you may have surmised, Vivian is a free spirit, and she views her current life as nothing but a prison. Her only escape is running around the local park, which is clearly symbolic of running away from her problems. She will never accept Gabriel, especially since she's expected to do so. But despite her convictions, she's weary of the unknown, which is exactly what she sees in Aiden (Hugh Dancy), an American graphic novelist. There's a definite attraction at work here, made stronger by the fact that Aiden also comes from a strict family that had expectations. When they meet, Vivian smiles for the first time, which, under these circumstances, is always indicative of someone trying to find his or her place; she may physically belong to a pack of superhuman creatures, but her mind and heart are unbounded.Of course, Gabriel finds this unacceptable. So does his son, Rafe (Bryan Dick), who's so arrogant and hotheaded that one can't help but hate him. Moments between him and Vivian are always tense, and they're made worse by his consistently condescending attitude. Both he and his father vow to rid themselves of Aiden, not only for Vivian's own good, but for the good of the entire Rougarou species, as well. Unfortunately, they have yet to understand that Aiden is quite capable of defending himself (thanks to being raised by an abusive father).As the film builds to a climax, Vivian's emotions are running higher than they've ever run: is she to remain loyal to her own kind, or is she to find happiness with an outsider she truly cares about? I found this dilemma interesting, especially since it's utilized in a werewolf story; she and Aiden may be of a different species, but that doesn't mean that she's incapable of showing him love. She also recognizes that Gabriel's hatred for humanity is fueled by fear. This is shown in a scene involving a ritual, one in which a human is forced to run through the forest while being chased by werewolves. If the human can make it to a river, his or her life will be spared (but it won't be easy; the human is cut before he or she runs, and the smell of blood drives the wolves crazy).Such barbaric treatment brings the film's message out into the open: if there's to be any hope for a new beginning amongst Rougarous, such negative emotions have to be set aside. I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm looking at ""Blood and Chocolate"" too closely; isn't it just a supernatural thriller about werewolves? Maybe so, but I'd like to think there's something more to it, something that can be cleverly disguised as a meaningless movie. I see it as a story of identity and acceptance, of tolerance and existence. While none of these qualities make for a particularly original story, at least they make for a more satisfying experience at the movie theater.",4,Hungry Like the Wolf,1170115200,"01 30,

They are passionate, feral creatures, but there are rules and traditions that, if broken, carry dire consequences. So when young, headstrong Vivian - promised to be their leader's next 'mate' - gets too close to a human boy who threatens to steer her from the path she's preordained to lead, she is forced to choose between her family heritage and the one she loves.I first read BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE by Annette Curtis Clause years ago when I was a teen, and from my vague recollection of the story this movie didn't stay entirely true to the book and yet it didn't stray too terribly far either. It was actually a lot better than I thought it would be but, as usual, it was not as good as the book. I did, however, think the 'gathering hunt' scenes were really well shot, albeit in the book they stripped COMPLETELY naked, not partially so, but I guess they had to maintain that PG-13 rating.Overall I found this film to be decent enough and definitely worth watching if you've read the book.

A clan of werewolves resides in Romania, but there are rules which must be followed.  The clan only hunts as a pack ~ no solo hunting and / or using one's beastly talents for revenge against a human.  Violating these rules can lead to expulsion from the clan, or worse.Agnes Bruckner is a perfect choice to play the lead role (Vivian).  While Vivian is a werewolf, she would much prefer to spend her days & nights making chocolate treats rather than hunting humans.  Indeed, she is actually repulsed by the bloodthirsty attributes of her clan.  Bruckner's austere eastern European beauty and athletic body make her an exceptional match for the portrayal of a female werewolf.Naturally, Vivian encounters an American tourist named Aiden, and her dark secrets begin to slip outside of the wolf clan.  As you can surmise, a courtly love like a werewolf version ofRomeo & Julietarises.If you like werewolf movies, then the unique approach of the current film will be enticing.

Freely adapted from the Annette Curtis Klause's novel by screenwriters Ehren Kruger and Christopher Landon and directed by Katja von Garnier, this version of the loup-garou legend takes place in Bucharest, Romania and while the corps group of 'night creatures' carrying the mantle of the clan appears small, the group seems more updated in its views of survival in the world of 'normal man' than most: the werewolves are a normal appearing bunch who change into rather elegant wolves through computer generated magic in a manner that removes much of the gruesome element form the film.  It helps.Loup-garou child Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) witnessed the death of her parents at the hands of men in Colorado and escaped to Bucharest where 10 years later she is the next in line to be the 'bride' of pack leader Gabriel (a gaunt appearing Olivier Martinez).  Her aunt Astrid (Katja Riemann) with whom she lives had been the first love of Gabriel and a tension is set early in the film about the plight of the pack versus the desire to be a normal human, a tension that will help the resolution of the film's love story.  The mysterious, questioning Vivian meets young artist Aiden (Hugh Dancy) who himself has escaped America and his own demons.  An obvious infatuation cum attraction occurs and though Vivian admits to warm feelings for Aiden, she knows her affair is doomed: her cousin Rafe (Bryan Dick) and his pack of five discover her tragic near crossover the line of human desire, and the crisis of the story proceeds along the lines of victim and pursuer.The unfortunate title for the film is clumsily drawn from the negligently important job Vivian has working in a chocolate factory, hardly a comparison for the importance blood plays in the hunt and kill formula that the title supposedly represents.  But then it does set up the dichotomy of choice Vivian must make, whether to obey her loup-garou destiny or enter the realm of normal human motivations and desires. Yes, it all gets pretty corny, but in many ways this 'netherworld of monster types' film rises above others in its management of the transformation scenes (actually quite beautiful) and in the acting of Hugh Dancy. In the end it is the chance to see how truly Bucharest as a city really is that makes the movie worth watching.  The cast does the best it can with the weak material.

Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[4, 6]","When we saw the trailer for this movie several months ago, we thought that this was one of the worse titles for a werewolf movie--or any movie for that matter. The question is; where was Willy Wonka? Maybe he would have had a better a time playing with these wolves than eating chocolate.""Blood and Chocolate""--from the German independent film director Katja von Garnier--tells the story of a young woman named Vivian (Agnes Brunkner) who happens to be a sexy she-wolf. She lives in the outskirts of Bucharest, Romania along with hundreds of her kind--during the day she works in a chocolate factory. Their secret society (loux garoux), must remain unknown to the rest of humanity--if any human comes across them, they will meet an unfortunate end. Vivian longs for a loving relationship but unfortunately, she is not attracted to any of the other werewolves--the alpha males--that are in the pack. While hanging out in an old church, she comes across a man named Aiden (Hugh Dancy), and they fall in love--Vivian decides for now to hide her real identity. Their romance, of course, does not go well with Gabriel ([Oliver Martinez] who is the leader of the werewolves), because of the strict laws of their society. He must take a bride every seven years and Vivian has been destined to be Gabriel's next bride. Will Vivian succumb to Gabriel or will she go with Aiden?The director of this film (Katja von Garnier) has never done a horror movie--it shows--but has done more films dealing with woman relationships. She takes a different perspective with ""Blood and Chocolate"" (based on a romantic supernatural (werewolf) novel for young adult readers by Annette Curtis Klause.)Katja von Garnier is more interested in the modern trend of ""cool visuals"" supernatural horror movies. To follow this new style, she gets an army of Calvin Klein like models who look like manikins and as a result, the move suffers. Also the close-up cinematography is dull and makes these characters look lifeless.The screenplay adapted by Christopher Landon gives us a shallow story--something what would be accepted from a soap opera theme--with neither a strong romantic theme nor horror suspense that the book offered. In other words, Blood and Chocolate doesn't know if it wants to be a horror film or a dark romance.Even the transformation from human to werewolf is pretty amusing and has no interesting qualities as werewolf films from the past. No signs of neither the terrible anguish of ""An American Werewolf in London"" or the sadistic delight of ""The Howling"". Instead, the audience views a very magical/spiritual type of outcome. In this film, humans change into werewolves by diving like Olympic swimmers with a glowing aura, then change almost instantaneously into ordinary wolves. To make things worse, the camera shows different angles of perspective as they are leaping--which reminds us of Lassie as a wolf.If you never read this review, you will probably think this movie is about a sadistic killer who likes chocolate. However, if you have never seen a classic werewolf movie, then you will think werewolf movies are about young women who live in Romania. They have love affairs with humans, and work in chocolate factories. A movie like this cannot be recommended unless you have a sweet tooth for chocolate--or better yet, spend your money on a real Hershey's instead.",2,Blood and Chocolate this is probably one of the worse titles for a werewolf of all time.,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,3365,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'worse', 'titles', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'movie', 'matter', 'question', 'where', 'was', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'playing', 'wolves', 'eating', 'chocolate', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', 'German', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Vivian', 'Agnes', 'Brunkner', 'who', 'be', 'sexy', 'she-wolf', 'outskirts', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'hundreds', 'kind', 'day', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'secret', 'society', 'loux', 'garoux', 'must', 'remain', 'unknown', 'rest', 'humanity', 'human', 'will', 'meet', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'Vivian', 'longs', 'loving', 'relationship', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'attracted', 'other', 'werewolves', 'alpha', 'males', 'are', 'pack', 'hanging', 'out', 'old', 'church', 'man', 'named', 'Aiden', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'fall', 'love', 'Vivian', 'decides', 'now', 'hide', 'real', 'identity', 'romance', 'course', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'Gabriel', '[', 'Oliver', 'Martinez', ']', 'who', 'leader', 'werewolves', 'strict', 'laws', 'society', 'must', 'take', 'bride', 'seven', 'years', 'Vivian', 'been', 'destined', 'be', 'Gabriel', 'next', 'bride', 'Will', 'Vivian', 'succumb', 'Gabriel', 'will', 'go', 'Aiden', 'director', 'film', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'never', 'done', 'horror', 'movie', 'done', 'more', 'films', 'dealing', 'woman', 'relationships', 'different', 'perspective', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', 'based', 'romantic', 'supernatural', 'werewolf', 'novel', 'young', 'adult', 'readers', 'Annette', 'Curtis', 'Klause', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'more', 'interested', 'modern', 'trend', 'cool', 'visuals', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movies', 'follow', 'new', 'style', 'army', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'models', 'who', 'look', 'manikins', 'result', 'move', 'suffers', 'Also', 'close-up', 'cinematography', 'dull', 'characters', 'look', 'lifeless.The', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Christopher', 'Landon', 'shallow', 'story', 'something', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'accepted', 'soap', 'opera', 'theme', 'strong', 'romantic', 'theme', 'horror', 'suspense', 'book', 'offered', 'other', 'words', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'dark', 'romance.Even', 'transformation', 'human', 'werewolf', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'qualities', 'werewolf', 'films', 'past', 'signs', 'terrible', 'anguish', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'sadistic', 'delight', 'Howling', 'Instead', 'audience', 'very', 'magical/spiritual', 'type', 'outcome', 'film', 'humans', 'change', 'werewolves', 'diving', 'Olympic', 'swimmers', 'glowing', 'aura', 'then', 'change', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'ordinary', 'wolves', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'camera', 'different', 'angles', 'perspective', 'are', 'leaping', 'Lassie', 'wolf.If', 'never', 'read', 'review', 'will', 'probably', 'think', 'movie', 'sadistic', 'killer', 'who', 'chocolate', 'However', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'classic', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'think', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'are', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'Romania', 'have', 'love', 'affairs', 'humans', 'work', 'chocolate', 'factories', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'recommended', 'have', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'chocolate', 'better', 'yet', 'spend', 'money', 'real', 'Hershey', 'instead']",N/A
1063676,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000OCY7TY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[82, 99]","SPOILERS for the movie and the book.I thought this movie might be in trouble when I saw the trailer weeks before its release date and the theater audience howled with derisive laughter at the trailer voice-over's oh-so-dramatic unveiling of the awkward title: ""BLOOD...AND CHOCOLATE."" The thing is, people who haven't read the book wouldn't get the seemingly incongruous title. In Annette Curtis Klause's 1999 Young Adult novel (read it eons ago), BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE was a metaphor for Vivian's internal struggle between her werewolf heritage (the ""blood"") and her desire for a human boy (the ""chocolate""). Here, the ""chocolate"" part seemingly refers to her being employed in a chocolate shop.But let's get to the movie plot. In contemporary Bucharest, one of the very last wolf packs on earth survives and continues to hunt. Vivian Gandillon (Agnes Bruckner) is a troubled (but hot) young werewolf, haunted by a tragic past. She revels in running thru the Romanian woods but abhors the pack's bloodcurling tendency to chase down the occasional human victim. Vivian spends her days toiling away in a chocolate shop and her nights haunting the hot Bucharest night spots. One evening, while hanging out in a desolate chapel, she has a chance encounter with Aiden (Hugh Dancy), an artist who is researching the legends of the loup garoux (werewolves) for his next graphic novel. He's interested. She is, too, but rebuffs him. He persists and she succumbs to seeing him. Of course, they fall in love. Of course, it's not quite that easy.As per ancient custom, it seems that the leader of the werewolf pack, Gabriel (Olivier Martinez), must take a new wife every seven years and has been eyeing Vivian for his latest bride; so he's not about to let some human get in his way. Add to that the unsavory capers perpetrated by Viv's cousin Rafe (Bryan Dick) and his clique, the ""Five,"" and the love story of Vivian and Aiden threatens to fizzle out before its time. Shades of Capulet and Montague!I wondered if the film would be able to survive the burden of an incongruous title. Sadly...no. BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE suffers firstly from having a PG-13 rating as the movie finds itself reduced to a fangless state, with neither enough goriness nor titillation. Too, this film horribly butchers Annette Curtis Klause's popular book. Readers of the novel are bound to be disappointed and even heart-broken by all the changes made to make the feature more ""Hollywood,"" as the book's core story is basically gutted, leaving the character names and the lycantrophic premise as the sole survivors of the wholesale alterations. Briefly, some of the things that were changed: in the movie, the story is set in Bucharest, Romania, instead of in the U.S.; in the movie, Vivian works in a chocolate shop, instead of being in high school; Vivian's mother isn't present in the film (she has a key role in the book); also, the book depicts Vivian as embracing her werewolfness; and, importantly, the natures of Gabriel and Aiden have been drastically modified.A word to the gorehound: the film focuses more on the romantic aspect than the horror elements. In fact, I wasn't too impressed with the horror elements or the action sequences. Here, when the werewolves transform, they do so in a sterilized blur, instead of the nifty, gory and messy gradual segue from man to monster. And since these are the same producers who did UNDERWORLD, I guess they're trying to make Vivian over in Kate Beckinsale's Selene mold. But I think there are enough film babes out there who deliver these same trite action scenes. Meanwhile, the special effects are serviceable, if ho-hum.The actors are gorgeous but prove to be inconsequential. Agnes Bruckner and Hugh Dancy have some chemistry, but their ponderous acting serves to sabotage their rapport. Olivier Martinez, to me, is just miscast for the role of the heavy. Maybe it's too hard to be villainous when you have a French accent, unless everyone in the cast is French. Or maybe Martinez is just too...lightweight.Another drawback. I've always thought there was an element of tragedy in the werewolf mythos, of being forced to become a ravening beast against your will and losing all control and inhibition when the moon is full. But, in this movie, the moon's phase isn't much of a factor as the pack can transform at will. To me, this takes away some of the tension and part of the allure of the werewolf mythos. As well with this movie's proposition that werewolves can't infect their victims and ""turn"" them. You're either born a loup garou or you're not. This premise also takes away from some of the implied peril in the movie. When in a zombie, vampire, or werewolf flick, one of the biggest fears and carriers of suspense is that the viewer's favorite characters might become infected.Now I realize that part of my lukewarm reaction to this flick is that, after all these years, I still fondly remember the book I've read. I've pretty much accepted that when a great book becomes a movie, it loses something in translation. Every now and then, you do have superb film renditions of books (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, LORD OF THE RINGS, HARRY POTTER...) or, even in rare instances, a film that improves on the book (TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT), but mostly, we'll get efforts like BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE. So let me say this, if I haven't read the book, I probably would've rated this film higher, maybe three stars. I'm usually pretty generous and I normally enjoy supernatural/fantasy horror features. But I have read the book and anjoyed it, and I'm a bit put out that so much was changed. Add to that the fact that the film's story is rife with cliches, the dialogue is boring, and the acting is only so-so. So, two stars from me, one star because Agnes Bruckner is hot.But, hey, at least Uwe Boll didn't direct this one, right?",2,"Not much blood, not much chocolate",1169856000,"01 27,

Now for some reason I was expecting this movie to be darker, edgier, perhaps even a horror movie, who am I fooling I knew I wasn't going to get one. The PG-13 rating didn't phase me as so many horror movies are coming out now with PG-13 rating. But this one borders on PG on it good-heartedness and gentleness. It's not particularly entertaining since there's not much drama in the movie, not much to look forward to.The lazy script co-written by Ehren Kruger and Christopher Landon follows Vivian (the oddly bland Agnes Bruckner) a chocolatier (hence, I suppose, the title) living in Romania who happens to be one of a subculture of werewolves who, from what we can tell, hang out in abandoned buildings jumping from rafters. Vivian herself enjoys jogging, throwing in the occasional leap off the wall just to show us that there's something special about her. In fact, when she first appears on screen, there's an audible sigh on the soundtrack (that might have been the sound of my interest being sucked out of the room, I'm not sure). Vivian meets-cute with the improbably-named Aiden Galvin (Hugh Dancy), a graphic-novelist doing research on, wouldn't you know it, the lore of the `Rougarou' (a fancy name for werewolves). No sooner do Vivian and Aiden start hanging about downtown Bucharest than the head baddie - named, natch, Gabriel (Olivier Martinez) - shows up to claim Vivian as his own.If you're not bored yet, you will be. Not only does director Katja von Garnier assemble a cast almost entirely lacking in charisma but the script is full of odd-sayings like ""May you recognize the age of hope when you see it,"" ""What we're not is what we're taught to fear,"" and my personal favorite ""If you cared about me, you'd have left me before we ever met."" I spent more time thinking about that last one than the whole rest of the movie. Mr. Kruger is usually good for a few laughs, but he's slumming it here with expository nonsense like ""It's...silver!"" and ""Creeks...lead to rivers!"" The love story didn't convince me all that much. On the positive side, I like the fact that this was filmed in Bucharest, it sure looks like an interesting city so there are some great sights here. My main concern here is that the wolves may have been harmed during filming. At the end of the movie there is no disclaimer that no animal was harmed, instead there's something to the effect that efforts were made avoid injury, which isn't quite the same. The mythology behind the story is good too. I like the special effects and the transformations to loup garou change, but even that wasn't anything that eye-catching.""Blood and Chocolate"" is too slow for its own good, the characters too bland and the plot too convoluted to reach the heights to which it aspires (and with a pedigree like ""from the creators of `Underworld'"", it doesn't aspire too much).

Probably something a group of high school seniors could have come up with - especially the ""age of hope"" line they kept repeating there at the end. There was little real suspense. I've never read the novel, so I have no clue how it did or didn't follow the book. So, I watched the film with no preconceived notions of what the story was about other than a pretty girl that was a werewolf. I think the film was good, but failed in the story line and the script. I would probably give it two stars, but there were some redeeming qualities. I find it refreshing that the two main characters did not (yes not) hit the sack. There are no heavy petting scenes. But, there is a booty and crotch grab in the beginning of the movie, which I found did not fit in with the style of the rest of the movie. It seemed to be put there to keep you watching. The rest of the movie was comprised of a few wolf chases, a few cutesy scenes between the romantic duo, and over all, less action than I've ever seen in what I thought was supposed to be a horror movie.

I love how the werewolves in this movie are actual animals than just the plain half-human half-wolf beasts you see in other movies or change during full moon, this one owes more to ""The Howling"" where the werewolves turn at anytime.

1063688,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B000OCY7TY,Keith Mirenberg,"[2, 2]","I found this film story to be one of the more interesting twists on the wolf legend but thought the films special effects to be less than first rate. I had no idea it was based on a book until I read reviews by dissapointed readers. Since I never read the book the film could scarcely have been a let down.  However, the book must have been grand indeed to have produced so many unhappy critics of this fine film.I also think the idea of the element silver producing blood poisoning relative to normal wolf blood chemistry was also an original movie concept and another area in which gifted writers of modern horror movies can make this field always young, vibrant and wide open to original ideas.I was dissapointed with the way this film presented humans morphing into wolves.  It was a good concept which was poorly done and as a screen visual effect just didn't do it for me. However, the basic film plot was fascinating and held my interest, despite what I think were poor visual effects.

No, what I found slightly disturbing was that I did not sympathize with the heroine.  **Spoiler**  I did not like it that in order for her to ""get away"" she had to kill her own people.  In order to be free she had to leave everything that wasn't human behind.  And she had to do all this by destroying her past, culture, and familial history.  It seems too often in this day and age we are encouraged and sometimes even demanded to let go of tradition that is seemed too old fashioned.  The logic behind her reasoning for doing what she did was weak and too new-age.  I could practically see some self-help guru's words coming out of her mouth.  I think this film would have done better and perhaps even have soothed the book fan's ruffled insulted feathers that instead of taking the easy route of choosing either human or animal they delved deeper and found a way for balance between modern change and unchanging tradition.

Her first film ""Bandits"" starred Katja Riemann who plays Astrid in ""Blood & Chocolate.""  This film has a great gothic look, but perhaps doesn't build dynamically enough to the final climax, although Aiden's chase sequence is excellent.Ehren Kruger who wrote screenplays for the ""Ring"" movies & ""Brothers Grimm"" teams with Christopher Landon for this film.  The screenwriting is probably the MOST controversial aspect of the film.  We expect screenplays from books to sometimes telescope events, perhaps leaving out some scenes or even minor characters.  Annette Curtis Klause's book had a strong following.  So remaking Gabriel's character to have a darker aspect and eliminating Aiden's betrayal of Vivian radically changes the story, as does having Vivian's mother die and trying to blend all of her raising into Astrid's character.  Probably, it would be a good idea NOT to let Kruger work on the final Harry Potter screenplay because fans of the book go crazy with as much dramatic license as Kruger has taken with ""Blood & Chocolate.""Agnes Bruckner plays Vivian Gandillon.  Bruckner was nominated for Best Actress in the Independent Spirit awards for ""Blue Car"" in 2003.  As Vivian, the audience never feels like they deeply identify with her.  We get a TV-quality performance of a girl falling in love who has the complication of a crazy family.  The fear factor and the seriousness of the consequences never play strongly.  Her performance has more romance than horror, when both were needed.  She looks very sweet as she works making chocolates.  One of the DVD deleted scenes that is chilling has to do with a boy who comes into the shop.  We think he's an ordinary customer until he casually comments that the ""hunt"" will be tonight.Former boxer Oliver Martinez, who made a big impression in 2002 inUnfaithful (Widescreen Edition)and was also in ""Taking Lives"" & ""S.W.A.T.,"" plays the dark brooding leader of the pack.  The film veers from the book where humans were not hunted to this limited-hunt version.  Kata Dobo makes a stunning visual appearance as the bloodthirsty redheaded vampire at the hunts.  One of the deleted scenes shows an unclad Martinez walking in the woods after he has switched back from his wolf form.  Making the audience not like Gabriel is one of the contradictions that is hard for even a good-looking actor like Martinez to satisfy.  How can you be charismatic enough to hold a pack together and romantic enough to earn Astrid's loving loyalty and also be a rather shallow jerk at the same time?  Whether this is actor, director or screenwriter, it doesn't play well.Hugh Dancy plays the human artist Aiden Galvin.  Dancy has been in ""Black Hawk Down,"" played Galahad inKing Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)& was nominated for an Emmy for his work in ""Elizabeth I.""  As the romantic lead, he probably is the most successful in the film.  Yes, he becomes fearful when faced with Vivian's blood sucking relatives, but he comes across as a very nice guy that the audience roots for to win Vivian's heart.Bryan Dick's rooftop-hopping Rafe is pompous and repellant.  As events unfold, the audience cheers his fate.Katja Riemann's Aunt Astrid is a complex nervous woman.  She is in love and losing love at the same time.  Riemann won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice International Film Festival forRosenstrasse, a film about marriages between Jews & non-Jews during World War II.  She is a nervous ball of energy in this movie, always moving in several directions at once.  It is an excellent performance.""Blood & Chocolate"" works less well than its producers from ""Underworld"" might have hoped.  The story goes in too many directions at once.

I rented it and would consider adding it to my dvd library if the price was right.  Based on the very vocal NAYS in reviews, me thinks the movie was advertised as more of a supernatural/thriller which would disappoint since it really doesn't make it on that level.  Sure, the werewolf lore (with a refreshing twist) was there but it wasn't the heart of the movie, it was the doomed love affair between our heroine (whose destiny controls the fate of her blue-blooded werewolf line) and a mere mortal man.  The Romeo/Juliette overtones are what drives this movie and the werewolf storyline is a great way to retell the classic romantic story of two ill-fated lovers.  I won't go into details since enough are provided elsewhere.

1063697,A2XVRMODZKON7B,B000OCY7TY,Missy Machete,"[0, 0]","First off, I read Annette Curtis Klause's wonderful book (of the same title) when I was about thirteen or fourteen and I remember being so blown away by the amazing story and wonderfully thought out charecters that when I loaned my copy of the book out to a friend some years later and never got it back, I was devestated until I managed to scrounge up a used copy at a bookstore. I saw the movie almost five years ago and remember going, WHAT THE F*&^! I don't even know why I'm bothering to review now, but I guess its because a part of me just wants to lament over the butchering of a fantastic book by Hollywood.First things first: the storyline is so off it's ridiculous. Vivian and her pack lived in the US, not Romania! Vivian's mother, Esme, was a HUGE part of the book, I couldn't believe it when her charecter was completely scrapped in the movie version. And no one's mentioned Astrid...I was so excited to see how the movie would portray a complicated villaness like she was in the book...imagine my disbelief when they portrayed Astrid as Vivian's loving aunt! No way that should have been allowed, in the book, Astrid tries to kill Vivian not once, but twice.I REALLY, REALLY wanted to see how the producers described 'The Old Way' or the fight ritual in which the male werewolves battle in their wolf-skin for control of the pack. That wasn't even included. I wanted to see the gore, I wanted them to re-create the world that Curtis-Klause made you see, smell and almost touch in her book...this movie has none of that. The only things it kept were the premise of werewolves and the names of the charecters. It also kind of irked me that the producers introduced the idea of werewolves being able to 'control' their change, as in mind over matter. Sorry, but traditional werewolf folklore just does not work that way. Even in the book, the members of the pack had limited control over the ability to change...they could if they wanted to, but at other times they have no choice, just like the werewolves of old.The cast was so-so. I really was not expecting Oliver Martinez as Gabriel, and it just did not sit well with me, the idea of this power mad leader that the movie describes him as....no humanity at all....whereas in the book, Gabriel is complicated and extremely conflicted over his double identity and sometimes comes off as the most human in the way he cares for and protects his pack. Agnes Bruckner is lovely as Vivian but her acting leaves something to be desired.All in all, if you read the original Blood and Chocolate and loved it, stay far, far away from the movie version. I guarantee you, you will be very dissapointed to the point of sadness. It's nothing but the name and a waste of a good 2 1/2 hours of your life.

She decides to be contrary, in wanting the freedom to marry whom she chooses. Besides the chosen locale, the European influence can also be seen by their fascination for Rave-style Discos.

It did for werewolves in a smaller amount of time what Ann Rice's Vampire Chronicles series did for vampires:  Made them human and empathetic.Klaus's story wasn't just one of people who became wolves at night and preyed on humans, but of the inner struggle their human part has with their animal part.  Vivian learns eventually that she cannot help being what she is and that it's not so bad with a good, strong leader like her father once was.Here is a disgusting story about nothing but senseless bloodshed, bad special effects, and it leaves you cold once the end credits begin to roll.  There is no moral to the story about being true to yourself--just one long, cheap bloodbath that couldn't even begin to satisfy the most hardcore horror fans.

Zwick,"[2, 2]","In the movie's official press release, ""Blood and Chocolate"" is described as a ""female version of `I Was a Teenage Werewolf,'"" although, in terms of its plot, the movie has nothing whatsoever to do with that 1957 camp classic, except that one of the screenwriters, Christopher Landon, is the son of the late Michael Landon, the star of that film.Actually, a more accurate title for the movie might have been ""A Romanian/American Werewolf in Bucharest,"" since it's all about a freethinking 19-year old girl from the States who isn't exactly thrilled about her lycanthropic heritage (the ""chocolate"" of the title comes from the fact that she works at a small candy-making shop; the ""blood"" you can probably figure out for yourself).  Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) hails from a long line of werewolves who have gone into hiding in and around the city of Bucharest, fearful that if they make their presence known, the well-armed humans will hunt them down and exterminate them as they`ve done in the past.  As a child, Vivian's parents took her to live in America (which explains her lack of a Romanian accent), but when their true bestial natures were uncovered, the locals took matters into their own hands, killing her mother and father and burning their home.  Vivian, who barely escaped the incident with her life, now lives with the memory of the event, determined to keep her identity a secret and deny the beast within.  Complications arise when Vivian finds herself promised in ""marriage"" to the local lycanthrope leader (Olivier Martinez), while at the same time falling madly in love with a young, highly inquisitive artist from America (Hugh Dancy).  This makes ""Blood and Chocolate"" an interspecies version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as well.  Heck, there`s even an ""A Boy Like That"" moment lifted straight out of ""West Side Story"" to certify the parallel.Based on the book by Annette Curtis Klause, ""Blood and Chocolate"" is a stultifying tedious and boring movie that spends more time on musical montage sequences and darkly lit shots of people running through the forest than on generating thrills.  The film even cheats by having these ""werewolves"" turn completely into wolves, which, of course, keeps special effects and makeup costs down, although the kennel and dog-training bills must have been enormous.  The Bucharest setting is unusual and intriguing, but beyond that there is literally nothing worth recommending about this film.As I recall, there were more genuine thrills in ""Teen Wolf"" - a movie that actually WAS ""inspired"" by ""Teenage Werewolf"" - than there are in this silliness.

The title is a metaphor for Vivian's (the heroine) internal struggle between her werewolf heritage (the ""blood"") and her desire for a human boy (the ""chocolate"").In this story, werewolves are still among us, happily living in Bucharest, where this story takes place. This is not the classical story of werewolves Hollywood has portrayed. Here, werewolves can change from human to wolf by the mere thought of it, whether it is a full moon or not, whether night or day. The change takes place in a glow of light, almost instantaneously. There is no metamorphosis into a monster between human form and wolf. Furthermore, those bitten by a werewolf do not become a werewolf. Upon their death, werewolves do not become vampires, as related in folklore. This movie therefore departs from traditional folklore. In this movie, werewolves are shown to be revered, not feared. Like in the classical stories though, they are susceptible to silver, and they do hunt humans.There are no scary scenes in this movie like traditional werewolf movies.

1063709,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000OCY7TY,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[0, 0]","As an adolescent, I loved Annette Curtis Klause'sBlood and Chocolate, the gripping tale of a modern-day werewolf pack. In the film adaptation by Katja Von Garnier (screenplay by Christopher B. Landon and Ehren Kruger), Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) and her pack live in Bucharest, Romania after fleeing a massacre in the United States. The solitary Vivian jogs, works in a chocolate shop, and avoids the advances of her cousin Rafe and his slimy friends. At night, she sips absinthe in trendy basement clubs. One night she runs into graphic novelist Aiden (Hugh Dancy), who is working on a piece about the loup-garou (werewolves), and Aiden seems to speak her language, viewing werewolves as noble.Vivian tries to shake Aiden's interest in her, as she is destined to become leader Gabriel's (Olivier Martinez) wife and future leader. However, the two eventually become involved, with tragic consequences for all involved. The so-called romance felt forced and unrealistic.The film is very dark and violent, with several scenes of pack hunting, vigilante justice, and graphic murders. It seemed to be all style and no substance; sure, the location footage of Bucharest looked beautiful, but served no purpose to further the story. There was no integration with local culture, and the trendy clubs could have been in any major European city.What little plot there was focused on vengeance, with shamefully little devoted to the werewolf lore that was the center of the original novel. In the film, there are no special effects when the humans (rarely) change into werewolves; instead, we're shown a brief blur that dissolves into real wolves. Disappointing to say the least; given, it's not a human in a bad werewolf suit, but none of the mystery or romance from the original novel is there. The chase scenes were heavy handed and overused, as were the numerous club scenes. The violence was gratuitous and largely without merit, but not scary enough to make this a horror film.Other than the names of several characters, little has been preserved from the original novel, and that's a shame. Klause penned beautiful descriptions of the change from human to werewolf, and of Vivian's delight in her dual sensual natures. In the original novel, Vivian is wrapped up in school and the pack hierarchy, and in many ways is a normal teenager interested in art and music. In the film version, Vivian feels empty; we never know what she enjoys, we never see her at school or with friends. Instead of the well-outlined pack hierarchy in the novel, Olivier Martinez's Gabriel is focused on protecting the pack through violence; there is none of the code of honor featured in the novel, and the werewolves' code is much more animalistic here. In the novel, Klause makes it possible to sympathize with the pack members who have all suffered personal loss and tragedy because of what they are; here, we never meet (or care about) the faceless pack members that exist only to kill humans.The DVD offers several deleted scenes, a commentary from Olivier Martinez, and widescreen and fullscreen versions.Final verdict: next time, stick closer to the source material. Some changes may have given the story a fresh new face, but the screenwriters basically rewrote the entire Blood and Chocolate story without any of the romance or wonder.",2,"Highly stylized, but an empty shell of a great novel",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,3314,"['adolescent', 'loved', 'Annette', 'Curtis', ""Klause'sBlood"", 'Chocolate', 'gripping', 'tale', 'modern-day', 'werewolf', 'pack', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Katja', 'Von', 'Garnier', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'B.', 'Landon', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'Vivian', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'pack', 'live', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'fleeing', 'massacre', 'United', 'States', 'solitary', 'Vivian', 'jogs', 'works', 'chocolate', 'shop', 'advances', 'cousin', 'Rafe', 'slimy', 'friends', 'night', 'absinthe', 'trendy', 'basement', 'clubs', 'One', 'night', 'graphic', 'novelist', 'Aiden', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'who', 'working', 'piece', 'loup-garou', 'werewolves', 'Aiden', 'speak', 'language', 'viewing', 'werewolves', 'noble.Vivian', 'tries', 'shake', 'Aiden', 'interest', 'destined', 'become', 'leader', 'Gabriel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'wife', 'future', 'leader', 'However', 'two', 'eventually', 'become', 'involved', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'involved', 'so-called', 'romance', 'felt', 'forced', 'unrealistic.The', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'violent', 'several', 'scenes', 'pack', 'hunting', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'graphic', 'murders', 'seemed', 'be', 'style', 'substance', 'sure', 'location', 'footage', 'Bucharest', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'served', 'purpose', 'further', 'story', 'was', 'integration', 'local', 'culture', 'trendy', 'clubs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'European', 'city.What', 'little', 'plot', 'was', 'focused', 'vengeance', 'shamefully', 'little', 'devoted', 'werewolf', 'lore', 'was', 'center', 'original', 'novel', 'film', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'humans', 'rarely', 'change', 'werewolves', 'instead', ""'re"", 'shown', 'brief', 'blur', 'real', 'wolves', 'Disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'given', 'not', 'human', 'bad', 'werewolf', 'suit', 'none', 'mystery', 'romance', 'original', 'novel', 'there', 'chase', 'scenes', 'were', 'heavy', 'handed', 'overused', 'were', 'numerous', 'club', 'scenes', 'violence', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'largely', 'merit', 'not', 'scary', 'enough', 'make', 'horror', 'film.Other', 'names', 'several', 'characters', 'little', 'been', 'preserved', 'original', 'novel', 'shame', 'Klause', 'penned', 'beautiful', 'descriptions', 'change', 'human', 'werewolf', 'Vivian', 'delight', 'dual', 'sensual', 'natures', 'original', 'novel', 'Vivian', 'wrapped', 'up', 'school', 'pack', 'hierarchy', 'many', 'ways', 'normal', 'teenager', 'interested', 'art', 'music', 'film', 'version', 'Vivian', 'feels', 'empty', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'never', 'see', 'school', 'friends', 'Instead', 'well-outlined', 'pack', 'hierarchy', 'novel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'Gabriel', 'focused', 'protecting', 'pack', 'violence', 'none', 'code', 'honor', 'featured', 'novel', 'werewolves', 'code', 'much', 'more', 'animalistic', 'here', 'novel', 'Klause', 'possible', 'sympathize', 'pack', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'personal', 'loss', 'tragedy', 'what', 'are', 'here', 'never', 'meet', 'care', 'faceless', 'pack', 'members', 'exist', 'only', 'kill', 'humans.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions.Final', 'verdict', 'next', 'time', 'stick', 'closer', 'source', 'material', 'changes', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'story', 'fresh', 'new', 'face', 'screenwriters', 'basically', 'rewrote', 'entire', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', 'story', 'romance', 'wonder']",N/A
1063710,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B000OCY7TY,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[3, 5]","Despite the somewhat soap opera-ish title of this film, I picked it up because it's from the creators of the Underworld films which were an excellent take on the vampire/werewolf genre and still some of my top favs to date.First, B&C; is being pushed as a werewolf film.  These are not the dark brooding monsters we were treated to in the Underworld films, but rather National Geographic wolves down on all fours with humans transformed into them just by jumping into the air and transforming into the wolf in a ball of light.We meet Vivian, a troubled wolf girl outside the pack.  Her family was killed when she was a child.  She lives with an aunt who oogles over a fractured affair with the pack leader, who isn't really like a leader at all.  He's just some hot guy with sexy hair and a beard.  Vivian is distant to the pack and also distant to the movie viewer.  It's very hard to get to know her.The pack is more of a shirtless boy band leaping off walls like acrobats.  The leader enforces certain rules upon the pack to keep them alive, including a carefully set-up hunt for a captive human running in the woods who can go free if they can reach the river.Vivian breaks law by falling for a human, a graphic novel writing tourist who is researching werewolf folklore.  He tears up his train ticket to stay with Vivian and spend time with her.  Quite the sappy and clean teenage love affair of hand holding and running through fountains.He kills Vivian's cousin (who is also the pack leader's son), almost by accident, who had been sent by the pack leader to force boyfriend to leave.  The hunt is soon on when the human boyfriend becomes the hunted as the pack leader wants to avenge the murder of his son.  We finally get to see Vivian as a wolf as she sets out to save her love.  Spoiler: The best scene in the movie is where he almost kills Vivian because he doesn't know it's her.Still lost over the title of the movie?  I was too.  Vivian works in a chocolate shop, which isn't really important to the plot.  Her aunt mentions something of a quote about the taste of blood and chocolate in your mouth.  And that's about it.  The blood is minimal.  The love affair with Vivian and the tourist is quite innocent.  The tourist becoming a silver bullet commando in the end to save the day is a bit like your favorite daytime soap opera.  The ballet-like leaps through the air and flashes of light among the boy band pack turning into Jack London's wolves is a joke.I kept thinking my teenage niece would probably just fall in love with this movie, and that's okay.  If it had come before the Underworld films, I probably would have enjoyed it more too.  It could probably be appreciated more if it had a different title.  More blood and gore (like Underworld) would have upped the premise and hype!  But that's not really what the film is about.  Actually, for those who love shows like Buffy, or 90210, or all those other teen dramas, this movie would have actually made an excellent TV nighttime drama.  So, you might like it.So...overall...not bad, but not all that good either if you are like me and much prefer the dangerous werewolves that scare us to death, not the ones who fall in love with the boy next door.",3,"More chocolate than blood, but that's not such a bad thing...",1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,3227,"['somewhat', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'title', 'film', 'picked', 'up', 'creators', 'Underworld', 'films', 'were', 'excellent', 'take', 'vampire/werewolf', 'genre', 'still', 'top', 'favs', 'date.First', 'B', 'C', 'being', 'pushed', 'werewolf', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'dark', 'brooding', 'monsters', 'were', 'treated', 'Underworld', 'films', 'rather', 'National', 'Geographic', 'down', 'fours', 'humans', 'transformed', 'just', 'jumping', 'air', 'transforming', 'wolf', 'ball', 'light.We', 'meet', 'Vivian', 'troubled', 'wolf', 'girl', 'pack', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'aunt', 'who', 'fractured', 'affair', 'pack', 'leader', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'leader', 'just', 'hot', 'guy', 'sexy', 'hair', 'beard', 'Vivian', 'distant', 'pack', 'also', 'distant', 'movie', 'viewer', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'know', 'her.The', 'pack', 'more', 'shirtless', 'boy', 'band', 'leaping', 'off', 'walls', 'acrobats', 'leader', 'certain', 'rules', 'pack', 'keep', 'alive', 'including', 'carefully', 'set-up', 'hunt', 'captive', 'human', 'running', 'woods', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'free', 'can', 'reach', 'river.Vivian', 'breaks', 'law', 'falling', 'human', 'graphic', 'novel', 'writing', 'tourist', 'who', 'researching', 'werewolf', 'folklore', 'up', 'train', 'ticket', 'stay', 'Vivian', 'spend', 'time', 'sappy', 'clean', 'teenage', 'love', 'affair', 'hand', 'holding', 'running', 'fountains.He', 'kills', 'Vivian', 'cousin', 'who', 'also', 'pack', 'leader', 'son', 'almost', 'accident', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'pack', 'leader', 'force', 'boyfriend', 'leave', 'hunt', 'soon', 'when', 'human', 'boyfriend', 'hunted', 'pack', 'leader', 'avenge', 'murder', 'son', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Vivian', 'wolf', 'out', 'save', 'love', 'Spoiler', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'almost', 'Vivian', ""n't"", 'know', 'her.Still', 'lost', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'Vivian', 'chocolate', 'shop', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'plot', 'aunt', 'mentions', 'something', 'quote', 'taste', 'blood', 'chocolate', 'mouth', 'blood', 'minimal', 'love', 'affair', 'Vivian', 'tourist', 'quite', 'innocent', 'tourist', 'becoming', 'silver', 'bullet', 'commando', 'end', 'save', 'day', 'bit', 'favorite', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'ballet-like', 'leaps', 'air', 'flashes', 'light', 'boy', 'band', 'pack', 'turning', 'Jack', 'London', 'wolves', 'joke.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'teenage', 'niece', 'would', 'probably', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'okay', 'had', 'come', 'Underworld', 'films', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'too', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'appreciated', 'more', 'had', 'different', 'title', 'More', 'blood', 'gore', 'Underworld', 'would', 'have', 'upped', 'premise', 'hype', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'Actually', 'who', 'love', 'shows', 'Buffy', '90210', 'other', 'teen', 'dramas', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'excellent', 'TV', 'nighttime', 'drama', 'So', 'might', 'like', 'it.So', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'are', 'much', 'prefer', 'dangerous', 'werewolves', 'scare', 'death', 'not', 'ones', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'boy', 'next', 'door']",N/A

It brings twisting books to a whole new level of perversity and `why did they even buy the copyrights'- ness.I will say why I despise this movie very plainly, so even if you haven't read the book, you'll know what I mean. ""SPOILER WARNING!""In the book, our heroine, Vivian, loves being a werewolf and gets along with most of the other werewolves. The wolves only want to be left in peace, and are extremely careful not to hunt humans, while in the movie they're a sadistic lot who likes terrorizing and killing humans in a sick game where the whole pack hunts one person.In the book, Vivian's werewolf love interest, Gabriel, is a firm but very fair pack leader who wants a mate (and wife) for life. Gabriel does not force attention on Vivian, he very patiently waits to see if she'll become interested. He is in his early twenties, she in her late teens. In the movie, the pack leader picks a new mate every seven years (??) Gabriel is supposed to be forty-ish (to Vivian`s late teens/early twenties) , and is the father of Vivian's cousin. Her aunt is still in love with him. And he stalks Vivian and insists she can't do anything about her `destiny'. Uh, gross!!! Oh, and in the movie she SHOOTS and kills him - that DOESN'T happen in the book!!In the book, Vivian's human love interest doesn't except her for what she is - in the movie, he's totally cool about it.And...in the book, a certain character tries to murder Vivian - in the movie that persons her aunt, whom she lives with!!The movie is actually less scary than the book - I know, all those plot changes, and not more of a thriller? The movie is just occasional gore and violence - the book is really creepy and well-written.I think the worst thing about this movie was it's total lack of respect for the author's work, and the total inability of the movie-makers to realize that an original plot about being a teenager - longing for acceptance and true love, and being unsure - with an awesome supernatural plot that is just as strong as the characters, would be a way better, more popular movie than a not-so-thriller with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.
