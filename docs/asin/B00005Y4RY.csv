I felt that way about &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;The English Patient&quot;.  So when I kept reading glowing reviews of &quot;The Deep End&quot;, I was hesitant to fall for them.  I expected it to be another disappointment.I was wrong.Ably directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, &quot;The Deep End&quot; is a lovely, atmospheric, domestic drama about the lengths to which a mother will go to protect her son.  When Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton, in a fine performance) finds the body of her teenage son's lover on the beach by her home, she reacts by dumping the body in the lake, and not telling anyone about it.  Soon, a dark, brooding man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic) appears, demanding money in exchange for a tape showing Margaret's son and the dead man.From there, &quot;The Deep End&quot; takes many twists and turns (some believable, some a bit contrived).  Yet, it is essentially a simple tale, about the love between a mother and a son.  Tilda Swinton deserved an Oscar nomination for her haunting portrayal of a desperate mother.  Everything about &quot;The Deep End&quot; is wonderful, from the cinematography (Lake Tahoe has never looked so beautiful), to the music and performances.  This is one of those films that are little-known, but worth digging up.

688705,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005Y4RY,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","A while back I was listening to a ""high brow"" talking- head discussion about the sea-change that has been occurring in the way American parenting has evolved over the past thirty years or so (the speakers however covered themselves with the caveat that this trend excludes certain ethnic, racial, cultural and class exceptions, in short, this was about how middle, now middle, and upper class parents raise their progeny). The gist of the argument is that the new ""coddle"" generation (say those under thirty, okay) have never learned to fail, parents have never allowed them to experience failure, and therefore they have never learned how to fly out of the nest unaided and therefore are ill-equipped to face the wicked old world and its snares. And that seems pretty close to some personal anecdotal evidence I have accumulated over the years.Subsequently I watched this film, The Deep End, which seems to be nothing but a homage to the trend those speakers spoke of- ""coddle"" nation. Here dear old mom (well not so old, at least not so old looking, played by Tilda Swinton) has to play mom and dad (dad off flying planes somewhere) and is forced to ""pick up"" after her teenage sonny boy. Seems he had a torrid love affair with an older man, the older man, a sleaze, tried to put the dough bite on mom to keep things quiet, sonny boy didn't like that when he found out and confronted that older man about it. Older man fell off the family pier where the confrontation took pace and the chase was on, for mom that is. Sonny boy just kind of went about his teen alienated way.First mom, no problem, disposed of the incriminating older man's body, including a dip in the lake to help let it sink. Then all hell breaks loose. It seems that the older man took some very compromising video of the pair having sex and that video would up in exactly the wrong hands, some sleaze associate and his enforcer.  So blackmail, big time blackmail entered the scene. Of course mom had no serious ready cash on hand when the enforcer man came calling and so things deteriorated  from there, although ever resourceful mom tried every avenue, including hocking her jewels, to come up with the dough. The squeeze was on though from the sleaze associate, although the enforcer, kind of smitten with mom and her pluckiness, started going to bat for her, and lost his own life over it in the end. That messy battle over with life went back to normal. With sonny boy head in the clouds, not a care in the world. Now that I think of it though I wouldn't have minded a mom like that although with my own hard-faced mom I learned to face this wicked old world, and survive.",3,Something About Mom,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,2649,"['while', 'back', 'was', 'listening', 'high', 'brow', 'talking-', 'head', 'discussion', 'sea-change', 'been', 'occurring', 'way', 'American', 'parenting', 'evolved', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'speakers', 'however', 'covered', 'caveat', 'trend', 'certain', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'cultural', 'class', 'exceptions', 'short', 'was', 'how', 'middle', 'now', 'middle', 'upper', 'class', 'parents', 'raise', 'progeny', 'gist', 'argument', 'new', 'coddle', 'generation', 'say', 'thirty', 'okay', 'have', 'never', 'learned', 'fail', 'parents', 'have', 'never', 'allowed', 'experience', 'failure', 'therefore', 'have', 'never', 'learned', 'how', 'fly', 'nest', 'unaided', 'therefore', 'are', 'ill-equipped', 'face', 'wicked', 'old', 'world', 'snares', 'pretty', 'close', 'personal', 'anecdotal', 'evidence', 'have', 'accumulated', 'years.Subsequently', 'watched', 'film', 'Deep', 'End', 'be', 'nothing', 'homage', 'trend', 'speakers', 'spoke', 'of-', 'coddle', 'nation', 'Here', 'dear', 'old', 'mom', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'old', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'old', 'looking', 'played', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'play', 'mom', 'dad', 'dad', 'off', 'flying', 'planes', 'somewhere', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'teenage', 'sonny', 'boy', 'had', 'torrid', 'love', 'affair', 'older', 'man', 'older', 'man', 'sleaze', 'tried', 'put', 'dough', 'bite', 'mom', 'keep', 'things', 'quiet', 'sonny', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'confronted', 'older', 'man', 'Older', 'man', 'fell', 'off', 'family', 'pier', 'where', 'confrontation', 'took', 'pace', 'chase', 'was', 'mom', 'Sonny', 'boy', 'just', 'kind', 'went', 'teen', 'alienated', 'way.First', 'mom', 'problem', 'disposed', 'incriminating', 'older', 'man', 'body', 'including', 'dip', 'lake', 'help', 'let', 'sink', 'Then', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'older', 'man', 'took', 'very', 'compromising', 'video', 'pair', 'having', 'sex', 'video', 'would', 'up', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'hands', 'sleaze', 'associate', 'enforcer', 'So', 'blackmail', 'big', 'time', 'blackmail', 'entered', 'scene', 'course', 'mom', 'had', 'serious', 'ready', 'cash', 'hand', 'when', 'enforcer', 'man', 'came', 'calling', 'so', 'things', 'deteriorated', 'there', 'ever', 'resourceful', 'mom', 'tried', 'avenue', 'including', 'hocking', 'jewels', 'come', 'up', 'dough', 'squeeze', 'was', 'sleaze', 'associate', 'enforcer', 'kind', 'smitten', 'mom', 'pluckiness', 'started', 'going', 'bat', 'lost', 'own', 'life', 'end', 'messy', 'battle', 'life', 'went', 'back', 'normal', 'sonny', 'boy', 'head', 'clouds', 'not', 'care', 'world', 'Now', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'mom', 'own', 'hard-faced', 'mom', 'learned', 'face', 'wicked', 'old', 'world', 'survive']",N/A
688706,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005Y4RY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Deep End is a pretty good movie.  The movie title has two meanings (one obvious, one subtle) and you'll see why when you begin to watch how the events unfold.A mother has a son that has a preference for men, and after a scuffle she hears in the middle of the night, the next morning she takes a walk and discovers the dead body of her sons boyfriend laying on the ground.  Now THIS presents an interesting situation.  If she were to report it to the police, they'd find out the dead guy was the boyfriend of the mothers son and would obviously accuse him of murder due to a fight that had taken place the night before between the two of them.  A caring loving mother in the Jodie Foster look-alike Tilda Swinton wouldn't want that, would she?  By the way she's a FANTASTIC actress and totally nails her role as a protective mother.  No, she wouldn't want that- she'd want to protect her sons potential involvement and keep a low profile, so she finds a sneaky and convincing way to ditch the body.Here's where I'm caught in a tough situation.  If I explain anything more, I'd ruin all the crucial events that take place throughout the movie.  So let's just say, a mysterious guy shows up one day and knows about the guys death and demands a large sum of money or the video evidence that he's somehow obtained would *easily* target the mothers son and have him locked in prison for murder.  From here, several ""I can't believe Tilda's luck- easily the worst day of her life!"" moments take place involving not only Tilda's character, but her father, her son, the mysterious money-demanding man, and another less-than-friendly character that plays a big role near the end.The ending is very satisfying I thought.  Everything was wrapped up accordingly.  The pace overall is relatively slow but it always leads to a memorable scene so there's no problem there.

688707,A30TQET02FLSUX,B00005Y4RY,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","I just love character-driven dramas like this film...at least when they are done well. And this small indie film was very well made. It's actually a bit of a ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" as well. But at its core its about the characters.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars and can't encourage you enough to see this movie. I caught in on HBO recently and it reminded me I needed to add it to my DVD collection.  Surprisingly, the film has two directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, which is rare. And its even rarer that the 2 are not brothers, which seems to be the typical co-director types.This was the first film where I was introduced to Tilda Swinton, and it was one of actor Goran Visnjic's first major movie roles, after he joined the ER cast on tv. Both actors are perfectly cast in their roles, and the chemistry between them is wonderful. The way their relationship develops from ""enemies"" to ""friends"" is well written and well acted. I don't want to give too much about the plot away since that is where the enjoyment of this movie lies. Swinton plays Margaret, the mother of a family of three kids, with her husband Tom out at sea in the Navy. She has her husband's elderly father at the house with the kids, but she's the captain of this family ship while her husband is away. The eldest son, Beau, played with perfect teen angst by Jonathan Tucker, is discovering his sexuality by fooling around with a gay nightclub owner named Darby, played surprisingly well by Josh Lucas. Unfortunately, Darby accidentally dies while visiting Beau one night at his house...only to be found the next morning on the beach by Margaret. As a mother, Margaret wants to protect her son at all costs, and she assumes Beau is responsible for Darby's death in some way, so she wants to cover it up to protect him. Darby had debts with some ""bookies"" who know about Darby's affair with Beau and come to collect from Margaret, assuming she will pay to protect her son and her family from a scandal, or Beau going to jail. Goran Visnjic plays Alek, one of the two bookies, who blackmails Margaret. With her husband at sea and in the dark about Beau being gay, Margaret is left to solve this mess on her own.The film was shot on location in Lake Tahoe and Reno, and the incredible deep blue lake is a character of its own within this drama. The photography by Giles Nuttgens is beautiful, with a natural feel that puts you right there in the movie. The soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film and helps build tension and emotion quietly. This movie grows on you as you get to know the characters and their emotions. I've enjoyed the subtlety of viewing this movie 3 or 4 times now and it is in my Top100 movie list. It's not a ""flashy"" Hollywood film, but that's what I like about it. It's in the vein of another favorite character-driven thriller movie of mine: Dead Calm (1989). It's not nearly as creepy and twisty as Dead Calm, but it has the same elements in a subtler way.The trailer is not as representative of the brilliance of this movie as I think it could be.

""cscotts""","[1, 4]","Released last year among wide critical acclaim, THE DEEP END opens with Margaret Hall confronting her teenage gay son's older lover, basically imploring him to stay away from him.  As the plot progresses, someone ends up dead and Margaret is trying at all cost to shield her son from the possible consequences. Blackmail enters the picture when a man confronts the mother with an incriminating videotape of her son and the deceased, which he threatens to reveal if certain monetary demands aren't met.  Tilda Swinton, in a usually thankless role, gives one of the most subtle, nuanced and Oscar-caliber performances of last year--despite the fact that she failed to score one.

DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","The family is more or less all-American, the house is on the shores of Lake Tahoe, the father is a senior naval officer away on duty but back soon, the mother is coping silently, maybe a little unhappily. She has three kids. The eldest is 17 years old, a teenager who is trying to come to grips with his homosexuality. He's been running with an older, sleezy opportunist. The mother discovers this and tries to break things up. This leads to a fight, a death which could be murder, the discovery that her son is gay, blackmail and a resolution that works.The movie, in my opinion, is first rate. It's well-acted, the son's sexuality isn't dwelled upon and is treated matter-of-factly, and the story is full of nuances. Tilda Swinton plays the mother, and the story is about her absolute determination to protect her children, especially her son. She takes steps she thinks are best, or at least best of the choices she has, and they have consequences that are seldom tidy or expected. The relationship that developes between her and one of the blackmailers is tentative and even believeable.

Yet what has mesmerized critics including Roger & Ebert is probably the dynamic performance of Tilda Swinton who clinches the psychological thriller part with her moral dilemmas and parental obligations conflicting with her anxiety for her closeted gay son. Even my cine-illiterate mother agrees that the movie is more of an exploration of mother-son relationship which is at times touching and poignant. The movie requires patience - which many of the commerical thriller fanatics have little of - and the impact of the vicarious fear comes only after the movie when you relive the horror of making one wrong turn leading to another.

This is one of those movies that gets acclaimed, but slips in and out of theatres and cable so fast you sometimes miss it.  Besides, Goran Visnjic is my wife's latest mental Boy Toy, so that helped get it prioritized for a viewing in our limited movie-viewing time.On the good side, Tilda Swinton does deserve every bit of acclaim she got for the role.  She could have easily replace another Nicole Kidman ice-cold-man-manipulator role as an Oscar nominee, IMHO.  It can't be an easy task for a mother to walk into a male gay nightclub, ask for the owner, and tell him to stay away from her son.  She shows the fear as well as the determination well in doing this task.  When she also portrays to Visnjic, from the viewpoint of a soccer mom, exactly why it's tough for her to scrape all the money he wants to steal from her in such a short time, I would think it would be convincing to many a hardened criminal.Goran Visnjic is also pretty good, as he has to portray a criminal with a potential change of heart.  This role could have easily been reduced to ""Ruthless People"", where the demands for the money keep getting reduced, but he strikes a good balance between uncertainty and his obligation to his superior.Where it goes wrong, and unfortunately this is fairly big for me, is the ending.  Where we see this woman putting together a heroic effort to protect a son that probably doesn't deserve it, I was hoping that there would be some kind of triumphant ending brought about by her wits.

688727,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B00005Y4RY,James Carragher,"[5, 5]","Let's concede the main criticism of The Deep End right up front -- some plot elements are wildly arbitrary and improbable.  The crotchety old father-in-law exists only to trigger a pivotal moment in the movie.  And, yes, it is totally illogical for Tilda Swinton to dump the body where it will be found, but hey, without that decision, there's no movie!Suspend your disbelief, however, and what you have here is a  wonderfully acted and thoroughly engrossing film.  Two scenes between Mom (Tilda Swinton) and the blackmailer (Goran Visnjic)--the first when he comes upon the emergency involving Mr. Crotchety and the second at the house's shoreline after she has missed a meeting with him -- turn both their relationship and the movie upside down.  In the hands of lesser actors, it wouldn't work; but with Swinton and, equally (because he must make the greater character change from coldly calculating to human), Visnjic, a viewer believes the transformation.The beneficiary of Mom's cleanup, the gay son, remains clueless from start to finish.  Having early on lied to his mother, ""he's just a friend,"" when talking about his older lover, he cannot believe that is the truth when she says the same thing about the blackmailer.  Another fine moment comes when he tells the lover that Mom doesn't know about their relationship and the older man snorts, ""She knows...she's a mom, not a moron.""Spectacular views of Lake Tahoe abound and, fitting to the title, water is a constant motif.  A bonus of the DVD is Anatomy of a Scene, in which the filmakers describe the complexities and numerous takes of the shoreline scene, making subsequent viewings all the more rewarding.Know what you are getting into -- The Deep End is a melodrama from start to finish.  It is not filled with big ideas or entirely believeable.  It is an entertainment, a superbly constructed, filmed, and acted one.

Swinton deserves all the more praise for the fact that she could even pull such a believable and, ultimately, heartbreaking performance from what is essentially a b-movie script with uninspired direction and altogether unimpressive supporting performances.first off, it was impossible for me to sympathize with the plight of Margaret's son, Beau, because of the fact that Jonathan Tucker provides such a sniveling, pathetic portrayal that i actually had a difficult time believing he was worth all of his mother's effort. all he does in the film is whine and mope and blush like a pre-raphaelite maiden and stupidly cast off his mother's attempts at establishing some sort of meaningful rapport with him (and she makes some honest, real, and sensitive attempts). it is only at the end, after Margaret has been through absolute hell for him and back, that it suddenly begins to dawn on his brilliant little mind that she had been on his side all along. sure, sure, blame it on pig-headed adolescent teen angst if you will; perhaps i could have done the same if it wasn't for the fact that Tucker gives such a one-dimensional performance that obnoxiously screams, ""hey, look at me, the troubled and sensitive teen!"" without providing any of the depth to allow the character to resonate with us. this kid should really take some acting tips from Nick Stahl, who adds layers and layers of complexity to the similar ""sensitive young man"" he plays in ""In the Bedroom.""and then there is the stunningly ludicrous plot development of Goran Visnjic's character -- you know, the one who threatens to expose Margaret's secret if she doesn't cough up a huge wad of dough -- actually falling in love with Margaret and, even more ridiculous, her actually returning his affections. i mean, sure, i realize that walking into a movie, i'm going to need to suspend disbelief to some extent, but come on, this is WAY too much for the filmmakers to ask. for Margaret to fall in love with the man who represents the greatest threat to her family's stability, the very threat that allows her to pull together the strength needed to act in the remarkable, if disturbing, ways she does, is to completely undermine the integrity of that strength.",2,see it for swinton,1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,2498,"['two', 'stars', 'i', 'give', 'film', 'go', 'entirely', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', '5', 'star', 'performance', 'who', 'simply', 'phenomenal', 'Margaret', 'Hall', 'woman', 'desperate', 'actions', 'face', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'help', 'altogether', 'redefine', 'notions', 'mother', 'love', 'child', 'Swinton', 'more', 'praise', 'fact', 'could', 'even', 'pull', 'believable', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'what', 'essentially', 'b-movie', 'script', 'uninspired', 'direction', 'altogether', 'unimpressive', 'supporting', 'performances.first', 'was', 'impossible', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'Margaret', 'son', 'Beau', 'fact', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'such', 'sniveling', 'pathetic', 'portrayal', 'actually', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'believing', 'was', 'worth', 'mother', 'effort', 'film', 'whine', 'mope', 'blush', 'pre-raphaelite', 'maiden', 'stupidly', 'cast', 'off', 'mother', 'attempts', 'establishing', 'sort', 'meaningful', 'rapport', 'honest', 'real', 'sensitive', 'attempts', 'only', 'end', 'Margaret', 'been', 'absolute', 'hell', 'back', 'suddenly', 'dawn', 'brilliant', 'little', 'mind', 'had', 'been', 'side', 'along', 'sure', 'sure', 'blame', 'pig-headed', 'adolescent', 'teen', 'angst', 'will', 'perhaps', 'i', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Tucker', 'such', 'one-dimensional', 'performance', 'obnoxiously', 'hey', 'look', 'troubled', 'sensitive', 'teen', 'providing', 'depth', 'allow', 'character', 'resonate', 'kid', 'should', 'really', 'take', 'acting', 'tips', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'who', 'layers', 'layers', 'complexity', 'similar', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'Bedroom', 'then', 'stunningly', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'development', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'character', 'know', 'one', 'who', 'expose', 'Margaret', 'secret', ""n't"", 'cough', 'up', 'huge', 'wad', 'dough', 'actually', 'falling', 'love', 'Margaret', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'actually', 'returning', 'affections', 'i', 'mean', 'sure', 'i', 'realize', 'walking', 'movie', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'need', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'extent', 'come', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'ask', 'Margaret', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'greatest', 'threat', 'family', 'stability', 'very', 'threat', 'pull', 'together', 'strength', 'needed', 'act', 'remarkable', 'disturbing', 'ways', 'completely', 'undermine', 'integrity', 'strength']",N/A

She is neither man nor woman in ""Orlando"" for example, and here, in this new release she proves why critics around the world consider her one of the finest actresses in film today.  Denied Oscar nominations for this and Orlando, the actress shines in an almost thankless role as a mother protecting her eldest son from a potentially disastrous situation that threatens his future.  When she discovers his boyfriend's body on a beach near her home, she goes to work, burying the evidence and taking great personal risks to protect her child from harm's way.  Soon, she is being blackmailed by the man's cronies and ends up in a game of cat and mouse that occassionally takes the breath away.  The male lead - Goran Visnjic - is a sore spot in the movie, and one reason the film in the end isn't as effective as it might be otherwise.  HIs con man, who ends up with feelings for his victim, is neither here nor there - and his poor command of English doesn't help matters.  Sometimes, you find yourself wondering what he's said, while other times, it's so unimportant to the plot, you're wondering why something was written in the script in the first place.  That serves ultiumately to derail the film but Swinton does her best mama-protecting-her-cub layered work here.  Like ""Orlando"" this is an actress whose time has come and who must be recognized for the ambisexual textures she brings to every performance.  Again, the actress was robbed of an Oscar nod for her work here, and after watching the ""Deep End"" one can only hope she continues to take risky roles so that a larger audience grows to appreciate the serene presence she brings to every character on screen.

Corn ""reviewer""","[39, 42]","A movie I loved so much that I actually stayed on my treadmill till it was over, extending my usual hour-long workout into 2 hours (and I'm paying the price today, ouch!)From the opening scene to the last credit, you won't be able to tear your eyes from the screen. Tilda Swinton, the star and focus of this film, is perfect in the role of a woman trying to protect her family from tragedy while maintaining her daily routine.A brief summary: Her adolescent son has been piecked up by a manipulative man and then the man tries to blackmail the boy's mother for money. Afterwards, he dies in cirucmstances that make the boy a possible suspect - although he is, in fact, innocent (I'm not giving anything away here; all of this is revealed early on in the movie).Swinton is calmly focused (most of the time), single-mindedly determined in her quest to hold everything together in the face of nearly insurmountable odds. She is equally determined to make sure her family - son, 2 daughter, elderly father-in-law - aren't aware of what is going on, of the tragedy that took place within minutes of their front doorstep. Meanwhile, her life is changing but not in ways she could have foreseen. In spite of her best efforts, she can't control everything.Watching Swinton juggle all her everyday duties (cooking, cleaning, keeping the kids organized and on time for school and after school activities) while dealing with the burden of hiding a body, covering up the evidence and keeping everyone in the dark, I couldn't help marveling at her apparent selflessness in the face of so much and at her incredible ability to fool those around her.This movie is one of the best of the year.

Tilda Swinton plays a woman, a Navy wife busy taking care of her three children and father-in-law, whose life is shattered when her son's older, drunken lover is mysteriously killed on their property. She desperately attempts to cover up the crime and protect her son, while playing cat-and-mouse with a blackmailer (Goran Visnjic) who appears at her door with an incriminating videotape.Swinton's terrific performance holds this film together--she projects despair, grief and gritty determination with equal skill. The ironic juxtaposition of everyday life with the nightmarish intrusions of murder and blackmail is telling as well: Swinton calling banks and credit-card companies to raise cash, shifting her car-pooling schedule so she can meet her extortionist. It's not quite enough to cover various holes in the plot that might have been less obvious in a 1940s film noir (of which this has the strong feel of a remake), but that are all too obvious here. There are also shifts in character and motivation midstream that are difficult to believe--scenes seem to have been cut that might better have been left in. Finally, another and less attractive remnant of an earlier era is the homophobia which underlies and drives much of the story--the viewer will have to make up his or her mind, but I for one was left wondering why on earth this film received so much laudatory gay press.",3,Film noir with a new and not altogether pleasant flavor,1000166400,"09 11, 2001",2001,1528,"['beautiful', 'scenery', 'sparkling', 'waters', 'Lake', 'Tahoe/Reno', 'area', 'make', 'suitably', 'ironic', 'backdrop', 'dark', 'happenings', 'film', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'woman', 'Navy', 'wife', 'busy', 'taking', 'care', 'three', 'children', 'father-in-law', 'life', 'shattered', 'when', 'son', 'older', 'drunken', 'lover', 'mysteriously', 'killed', 'property', 'desperately', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'protect', 'son', 'playing', 'cat-and-mouse', 'blackmailer', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'who', 'door', 'incriminating', 'videotape.Swinton', 'terrific', 'performance', 'film', 'together', 'projects', 'despair', 'grief', 'gritty', 'determination', 'equal', 'skill', 'ironic', 'juxtaposition', 'everyday', 'life', 'nightmarish', 'intrusions', 'murder', 'blackmail', 'telling', 'as', 'well', 'Swinton', 'calling', 'banks', 'credit-card', 'companies', 'raise', 'cash', 'shifting', 'car-pooling', 'schedule', 'can', 'meet', 'extortionist', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'cover', 'various', 'holes', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'obvious', '1940s', 'film', 'noir', 'strong', 'feel', 'remake', 'are', 'too', 'obvious', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'shifts', 'character', 'motivation', 'midstream', 'are', 'difficult', 'believe', 'scenes', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'might', 'better', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Finally', 'less', 'attractive', 'remnant', 'earlier', 'era', 'homophobia', 'underlies', 'drives', 'much', 'story', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'earth', 'film', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'laudatory', 'gay', 'press']",N/A

Based on the novel 'The Blank Wall' by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding (filmed once before by Max Ophuls as THE RECKLESS MOMENT [1949]), THE DEEP END updates an old-fashioned story for modern sensibilities: Tilda Swinton (longtime favorite of the late Derek Jarman) plays the devoted mother of 'sensitive' teen Jonathan Tucker (SLEEPERS, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) who's just broken up with abusive boyfriend Josh Lucas (ALIVE, THE HULK) following a violent quarrel. After discovering Lucas' corpse in front of their beautiful lakeside house - he had stumbled drunkenly and was fatally impaled after parting company with Tucker - Swinton assumes that he was murdered, and she moves the body to another location, hoping to conceal her son's involvement in the 'crime'. When the body is later recovered by police, she's confronted and blackmailed by a handsome stranger (Goran Visjnic, ""ER"") who has evidence apparently linking Tucker to the victim...In a Sundance Channel featurette which accompanied the original US DVD release, McGehee and Siegel compare their work to the films of Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, most notably MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION (1954) and TEA AND SYMPATHY (1956), but while THE DEEP END employs all the trappings of melodrama (multilayered story, clearly defined characters, corkscrew plot developments, etc.), it swaps the commercial artifice of those vintage potboilers for an altogether more subdued narrative style, allied to a range of intense, carefully modulated performances.Swinton anchors the film as a dedicated parent who pays a heavy price for loving her son too much, while Visnjic smoulders beautifully as a would-be villain forced to re-evaluate his moral position when confronted by Swinton's desperate reaction to his demands. Production-wise, the movie is near-flawless: Giles Nuttgens' widescreen photography makes a virtue of the glorious Lake Tahoe settings, and Peter Nashel's haunting theme music loans the film an appropriately solemn tone from the outset. Too slow for mass appeal, too clever to be dismissed, THE DEEP END is very much an acquired taste.",2,"Smouldering intensity, but few genuine thrills",1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,2459,"['DEEP', 'END', 'USA', '2001', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'Panavision', 'Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalDespite', 'intricate', 'plot', 'developments', 'sophisticated', 'surface', 'gloss', 'THE', 'DEEP', 'END', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Scott', 'McGehee', 'David', 'Siegel', 'belated', 'follow-up', 'well-received', 'debut', 'feature', 'SUTURE', '1993', 'more', 'mood-piece', 'outright', 'thriller', 'Based', 'novel', 'Blank', 'Wall', 'Elisabeth', 'Sanxay', 'Holding', 'filmed', 'once', 'Max', 'Ophuls', 'THE', 'RECKLESS', 'MOMENT', '[', '1949', ']', 'THE', 'DEEP', 'END', 'old-fashioned', 'story', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'longtime', 'favorite', 'late', 'Derek', 'Jarman', 'devoted', 'mother', ""'sensitive"", 'teen', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'SLEEPERS', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'who', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'ALIVE', 'THE', 'HULK', 'following', 'violent', 'quarrel', 'discovering', 'Lucas', 'corpse', 'front', 'beautiful', 'lakeside', 'house', 'had', 'stumbled', 'drunkenly', 'was', 'fatally', 'impaled', 'parting', 'company', 'Tucker', 'Swinton', 'was', 'murdered', 'body', 'location', 'hoping', 'conceal', 'son', 'involvement', ""'crime"", 'When', 'body', 'later', 'recovered', 'police', 'confronted', 'blackmailed', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'Goran', 'Visjnic', 'ER', 'who', 'evidence', 'apparently', 'linking', 'Tucker', 'victim', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'featurette', 'accompanied', 'original', 'US', 'DVD', 'release', 'McGehee', 'Siegel', 'compare', 'work', 'films', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'most', 'notably', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'OBSESSION', '1954', 'TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', '1956', 'THE', 'DEEP', 'END', 'trappings', 'melodrama', 'multilayered', 'story', 'clearly', 'defined', 'characters', 'corkscrew', 'plot', 'developments', 'etc', 'commercial', 'artifice', 'vintage', 'potboilers', 'altogether', 'more', 'subdued', 'narrative', 'style', 'allied', 'range', 'intense', 'carefully', 'modulated', 'performances.Swinton', 'film', 'dedicated', 'parent', 'who', 'heavy', 'price', 'loving', 'son', 'too', 'much', 'Visnjic', 'smoulders', 'beautifully', 'would-be', 'villain', 'forced', 're-evaluate', 'moral', 'position', 'when', 'confronted', 'Swinton', 'desperate', 'reaction', 'demands', 'Production-wise', 'movie', 'near-flawless', 'Giles', 'Nuttgens', 'widescreen', 'photography', 'virtue', 'glorious', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'settings', 'Peter', 'Nashel', 'haunting', 'theme', 'music', 'loans', 'film', 'appropriately', 'solemn', 'tone', 'outset', 'Too', 'slow', 'mass', 'appeal', 'too', 'clever', 'be', 'dismissed', 'DEEP', 'END', 'very', 'much', 'acquired', 'taste']",N/A

Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel understand the power of melodrama and use it to full effect here. This is excellent adult entertainment.Margaret [Swinton] discovers that her 17-year old son is having an affair with a much older man and tries to put a stop to it. She doesn't succeed. When she finds the man dead near the boathouse of the family's Lake Tahoe home, she assumes the worst and takes measures to assure that her son's promising future is not ruined. Everything she does, though, only causes her to go deeper and  deeper into a world of homicide and blackmail. The audience is draw into the story because it knows things Margaret and other characters don't.Of special note are the coldly beautiful cinematography by Giles Nuttgens and the haunting musical score by Peter Nashel.

Be thankful I wasn't asked, for Tilda Swinton gives the performance of her lifetime in this film directed by the duo of David Seigel and Scott McGehee.  Set in the Lake Tahoe/Reno area, the plot of &quot;Deep End&quot; is straight out of film noir and as such usually doesn't allow for much in the way of delving into a characters personality or psychology.  All the chracters in a film noir are archetypes:  cool blond Grace Kelly in &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; or Robert Mitchum as the tough, hard-drinking detective in &quot;D.O.A.&quot;  Seigel/McGehee use the film noir tradition as a jumping off point and layer on the shadings and angles that can make a movie character &quot;pop&quot; as personified in the Alek Spera role played with an uncanny combination of danger, empathy and sympathy by Goran Visnjic (T.V.'s &quot;ER&quot;).  Visnjic is a revelation is this role.  Notice how with just a slight eye or face movement he can transmit a multitude of emotions.  Great film actors use their faces to tell their stories.  Spera approaches Hall the first time to blackmail her for $50,000 over a sex tape that his boss, Carlie Nagel has in his possession. Smudging the bad guy/blackmailer image to the hilt, Spera quickly becomes attached to Hall and her family with surprising results that I will not reveal here.  What does transpire is that Visnjic and Swinton are such multi-faceted and complex characters involved in a many layered situation that you can't help but be fascinated by the whole enterprise.  If I had to make one small gripe it would be about the character of Darby Reese, a bar owner played by Josh Lucas.  This guy is strictly out of the Simon Legree mold of villian what with his pencil mustache and toothy sneer.  It's as if he belongs in another movie altogether.

Tilda Swinton is excellent as Margaret Hall, a normal everyday housewife who juggles the usual maternal duties effectively, while her naval officer husband is out to sea.  Jonathan Tucker plays her son, Beau, who she discovers has been hanging out with an older guy at a gay club, and she asks the man to stop seeing her son.  Once the son finds out, though, he resents his mom's interference, and meets with his lover secretly in their boat house.  However, circumstances result in an altercation, and Beau runs off leaving a staggering boyfriend behind, who...well, I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie.Tucker is effective as the closeted son, and Peter Donat does a nice turn as the children's grandfather.  Raymond J. Barry again turns in a creepy performance (see BEST MEN for more) as a blackmailer who plans to expose Beau's secret unless Tilda comes up with fifty thousand bucks.  His partner is played by Goren Visjnic (ER, Spartacus, Practical Magic), who finds himself sympathetic to his victim's plight.  Visjnic is certainly a handsome gentleman, but his performance is weak in a pivotal role; his accent doesn't help, either.  But due to Swinton's perfectly controlled performance, the movie doesn't cave in because of Visjnic.There's some beautiful scenery and neat directorial touches, such as the drop of water through which we see Swinton enter the house and the neat fade from the real mountains of Lake Tahoe to the fake ones at a performance of Swan Lake.A very good movie, with an outstanding performance.",4,A MOTHER'S LOVE,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,1662,"['Ultimately', 'DEEP', 'END', 'mother', 'love', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'protect', 'son', 'family', 'lives', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'excellent', 'Margaret', 'Hall', 'normal', 'everyday', 'housewife', 'who', 'usual', 'maternal', 'duties', 'effectively', 'naval', 'officer', 'husband', 'out', 'sea', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'son', 'Beau', 'who', 'been', 'hanging', 'out', 'older', 'guy', 'gay', 'club', 'man', 'stop', 'seeing', 'son', 'son', 'out', 'though', 'mom', 'interference', 'meets', 'lover', 'secretly', 'boat', 'house', 'However', 'circumstances', 'result', 'altercation', 'Beau', 'leaving', 'staggering', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie.Tucker', 'effective', 'closeted', 'son', 'Peter', 'Donat', 'nice', 'turn', 'children', 'grandfather', 'Raymond', 'J.', 'Barry', 'again', 'creepy', 'performance', 'see', 'BEST', 'MEN', 'more', 'blackmailer', 'who', 'expose', 'Beau', 'secret', 'Tilda', 'up', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'bucks', 'partner', 'played', 'Goren', 'Visjnic', 'ER', 'Spartacus', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'victim', 'plight', 'Visjnic', 'certainly', 'handsome', 'gentleman', 'performance', 'weak', 'pivotal', 'role', 'accent', ""n't"", 'help', 'due', 'Swinton', 'perfectly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'cave', 'Visjnic.There', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'neat', 'directorial', 'touches', 'such', 'drop', 'water', 'see', 'Swinton', 'enter', 'house', 'neat', 'fade', 'real', 'mountains', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'fake', 'ones', 'performance', 'Swan', 'Lake.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'performance']",N/A

David Siegel and Scott McGehee's film gives us fascinating characters, taut suspense and a story that is blessedly unpredictable. Tilda Swinton gives a performance of great subtlety and power as a Lake Tahoe housewife who takes bold action when she suspects her teenage son may have murdered his lowlife gay lover. She is matched by Jonathan Tucker, as the son, and by Goran Vishnijc as a blackmailer with a conscience. There have been many movies that have depicted evil infiltrating an ordinary family; the most famous is probably &quot;Shadow of a Doubt.&quot; &quot;The Deep End&quot; isn't quite a masterpiece on that level, but it is still quite splendid.

The son doesn't change expression from the beginning to the end of the film. We are just supposed to accept that he is a typical teenager, angry for no reason.

The movie was just fraught with inconsistency. If the extortionists knew about Darcy going to visit Beau, wouldn't it follow that other people at the club knew as well?Aside from that though, the movie annoyed me for the most part because the entire plot hinged on the fact that the mother never had the conviction to stand up to her wimpy son and ask just what the hell happened.

688749,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005Y4RY,Reviewer,"[6, 12]","The myriad effects of the natural instincts of a mother are at the heart of this film, which explores the positive aspects, as well as the inherent flaws of those same instincts.  The ways in which an ordinary person will react under extraordinary circumstances often produces results that are most inexplicable; and when it's a mother responding to a situation in which her son is involved, the results may, in fact, be absolutely incomprehensible.  And in such cases, decisions made quickly in the shadows of the subjective are often revealed as unconscionable in the cold light of objectivity, a scenario examined by writers/directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel, in their tension laced drama, ""The Deep End,"" starring Tilda Swinton.Margaret Hall (Swinton) lives with her family in a picturesque lakeside home in Tahoe City, Nevada; but her life is about to become less than that offered by her distinctive surroundings.  Her husband is away at sea on an extended tour of duty, and the care and responsibility of raising their three children has fallen to her.  And all is not well.  Her seventeen-year-old son, Beau (Jonathan Tucker), an aspiring musician who hopes to garner a scholarship to study music at college, has become involved with a man, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas) who owns a bar, The Deep End; and once she is aware of it, it's a situation of no little concern for a mother.For her son's welfare, Margaret knows that this relationship-- whatever the context-- must end, and she goes to Reese, insisting that he leave her son alone.  There is some question as to whether or not he agrees, but regardless, late that night he shows up at Margaret's home, where he entices Beau to come outside with him.  Things go badly, and by the next morning, Margaret is embroiled in a situation beyond her wildest nightmares.  Blinded by fear and concern for Beau, she does something out of character for any rational person, yet within the parameters established by the unconditional love of a mother for her son.  It's an act that brings more bad news to her doorstep, in the form of a man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic).  And it's the beginning of a series of events that will take her into places darker than any she has ever known.McGehee and Siegel adapted their screenplay from the novel ""The Blank Wall,"" by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, and it's a taut thriller, to be sure; but it is so singular of purpose that it decidedly becomes more of a character study that focuses on Margaret, and the effects of that natural bond between mother and son that provides the catalyst for her motivation and the impetus of her actions.  It's a story that clearly illustrates how even the most discerning individual (and most especially a mother) will abandon reason in the heat of the moment, giving way to the most primitive and basic instincts for survival that are inherently a part of the human condition.  And though MeGehee and Siegel maintain the tension of the situation throughout the film, it does wear a bit thin along the way, and at least one pivotal element of the plot is questionable, and strains the credibility of the overall story.  The real interest of the film, however, is the study of what the mother/son relationship is really all about, and how affecting it can be, especially under extreme circumstances.What really makes the film work, though, and what maintains interest, is the performance by Tilda Swinton as Margaret.  And it's quite a feat, given the fact that the emotional boundaries she is given to explore are somewhat limited, as the conflict begins even as the film begins, and Margaret is driven on and presented in an emotional state that gives her very little latitude in which to operate.  To her credit, however, Swinton finds all of the variables one could expect in what is basically a lone emotion, which encompasses concern and apprehension, and she conveys them admirably; it is, in fact, what keeps the film afloat.  Her portrayal of Margaret is subtle, concise and introspective, and most importantly, comes across quite naturally; all of which makes her character and her actions-- which on the surface and in the cold light of day may seem questionable-- convincing.As Alek, Goran Visnjic gives a solid performance, though it somewhat lacks the kind of emotional depth that could have made this character more than what it is.  Whether it is the way the character was written, or the way it was acted, there is an ambivalence to Alek that makes him less than believable.  He looks good on the surface, and Visnjic does have some nice touches, but he doesn't tap into the absolute credibility that he needs.  And it makes one aspect of the film seem a little too pat, as if the character is there merely as a means to an end, to help the story along and tidy up the resolution.  It's a minor weakness, not worthy of blame; suffice to say that something apparently was missed in the translation of the material from page to screen.  In retrospect, Visnjic does a good job with what he is given to work with.In a smaller, but pivotal role, Josh Lucas gives a good performance as Reese, creating a character that is repugnantly smarmy, a guy whose influence over one's son would be any mother's nightmare.  Lucas does exceptionally well in this regard, and with comparatively little screen time; he uses his time well, however, as it is the nature of his character more than anything else that gives credence to Margaret's actions.The supporting cast includes Peter Donat (Jack), Raymond J. Barry (Carlie), Tamara Hope (Paige) and Jordan Dorrance (Dylan).  As a thriller, this one has merit; but viewed as a character study/drama, ""The Deep End"" is even more engrossing.  It's flawed, but it's still smart, thought provoking entertainment-- the magic of the movies.",4,Insightful Study of the Mother/Son Relationship,1020902400,"05 9, 2002",2002,5810,"['myriad',

Things only get worse, and escalate,  and...well, Htchcock would've loved a script like this. Hitchcock aside, the writers and directors took a 1947 book, updated it a bit, and the result is a thoroughly satisfying suspense film that surpasses anything Hollywood has done in 30 years. Setting the film in Tahoe is a stroke of genius. Tilda Swinton avoids so many obvious acting cliches, providing a most mesmerizing portrayal of a woman in crisis. So much talk about the lack of great roles for women; Tilda blew 'em all away. There's able support from Goran Visjnik, playing a difficult role, bad guy who's questioning his destiny.

The movie depicts the torture one goes through once one starts weaving a web of deception. Story expert, Robert McKee describes how stories are about choices and the unexpected outcomes they produce. This is a great example of how choices change everything. Tilda Swanton did a great job portraying the angst and agony a parent going through tough choices. There are some nice twists and character arcs in this murder story and an ending that while not providing resolution, is, nonetheless, satisfying. It does include the most graphic depiction of male homosexual lovemaking I've ever seen in a mainstream movie, so it may not be something you want to take your teenager to see. On the other hand, it does give a clear message and lesson on the effects a teen experimenting then getting in trouble can have on a whole family (whether it is a minor having sex with an adult, using drugs, etc.) The film shows how profoundly a whole family can be affected by one teen's impulsive poor judgment.

688752,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005Y4RY,Robert Moore,"[28, 36]","There is always room for legitimate difference of opinion, but many of the negative reviews of this film border on science fiction.  Many seem to be based either on fallacies or misunderstandings.  Let me mention this first.Number one, some have claimed that this is a thriller without thrills.  Why would anyone think this is a thriller and that its purpose is to evoke thrills?  It is a suspense film, and while there are few thrills (nor were there meant to be), there is considerable suspense.  Negative reviews along this line try to define the film as being this or that, when in fact it is something, and then criticizing it because it doesn't conform to the fallacious definition.  So, no, this is not a thriller.Two, the acting is superb, not bad.  Several reviews mention bad acting, but as a former actor and hard core movie buff, I can spot bad acting when it occurs, and it is not apparent in this film.  The film turns completely on Tilda Swinton's performance, and she is just stunning.  And for the few critics who criticize her because she is so serious and glum, this is blaming her for the fault, if indeed it is a fault, of playing the character as it is written.  Happy things do not happen to her in this movie, and to express anything other than abject desperation would be inappropriate.  When the movie came out, many felt that she would not merely be nominated for the Oscar, but would win it.  I agree that her performance should have garnered her an Oscar nomination.  She wasn't nominated, but it should be noted that she not only was nominated by a number of other awards organizations for her performance but also won several Best Actress awards.Third, although this was not really the basis for criticism, several reviewers referred to it as a film noir.  It is not.  Not all suspense films are film noir, and this one lacked virtually every element that is constitutive of film noir.  The only element that it shares with film noir is the sense of moral ambiguity, but even that is lost when one realizes that the mother's actions are motivated almost entirely by a desire to care for her child.Fourth, there is criticism of the way in which a gay character falls in love with Tilda Swinton's character.  First (and I verified this by rewatching the film), nowhere is it intimated that Alek is gay.  That is an presumption that some are reading into the film.  Nor is it exactly clear that he ""falls in love"" with her.  Nagle, Alek's business associate, when perplexed by his attempts to help her, asks him if he was having sex with her (he was not), we know that he is being utterly wrongheaded.  I would suggest that reviewers who see him as unambiguously falling in love with her as also wrongheaded.  Instead, I believe that Alek is placed in a position where he ceases to see her as a ""business opportunity,"" because of his need to help her revive her father-in-law when he suffers a heart attack, and begins to see her as a human being.  After she drives off in an ambulance, Alek looks around the house and sees photos that reveal an entirely different world, a kind of world that is completely closed off for him.  His actions, I believe, are not based on a love for her in a romantic sense, but a deep and profound affection for the quality of life that she has, and that he does not have.  There is, in the end, some emotional tension, but even if the movie had ended differently, I do not think that Alek would have attempted any kind of romantic entanglement.Finally, whatever else one can say about this film, labeling it ""stupid"" or ""dumb"" is about as far off the mark as it is possible.  Instead, this movie is brimming with intelligence, and one of the marks of this is the fact that the more you think about it, there more thought it provokes.  It isn't like a truly dumb film that the more you think about it, you realize that it doesn't hold water, and conceptually disintegrates, putting an end to all thought.",5,Some of the reviews here completely miss the mark,1026000000,"07 7, 2002",2002,3963,"['always', 'room', 'legitimate', 'difference', 'opinion', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'border', 'science', 'fiction', 'Many', 'seem', 'be', 'based', 'fallacies', 'misunderstandings', 'Let', 'mention', 'first.Number', 'one', 'have', 'claimed', 'thriller', 'thrills', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'think', 'thriller', 'purpose', 'evoke', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'thrills', 'were', 'there', 'meant', 'be', 'considerable', 'suspense', 'Negative', 'reviews', 'line', 'try', 'define', 'film', 'being', 'when', 'fact', 'something', 'then', 'criticizing', ""n't"", 'conform', 'fallacious', 'definition', 'So', 'not', 'thriller.Two', 'acting', 'superb', 'not', 'bad', 'Several', 'reviews', 'mention', 'bad', 'acting', 'former', 'actor', 'hard', 'core', 'movie', 'buff', 'can', 'spot', 'bad', 'acting', 'when', 'not', 'apparent', 'film', 'film', 'completely', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'performance', 'just', 'stunning', 'few', 'critics', 'who', 'criticize', 'so', 'serious', 'glum', 'blaming', 'fault', 'indeed', 'fault', 'playing', 'character', 'written', 'Happy', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'happen', 'movie', 'express', 'anything', 'other', 'abject', 'desperation', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'felt', 'would', 'not', 'merely', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'would', 'win', 'agree', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'nominated', 'number', 'other', 'awards', 'organizations', 'performance', 'also', 'won', 'several', 'Best', 'Actress', 'awards.Third', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'basis', 'criticism', 'several', 'reviewers', 'referred', 'film', 'noir', 'not', 'Not', 'suspense', 'films', 'are', 'film', 'noir', 'one', 'lacked', 'virtually', 'element', 'constitutive', 'film', 'noir', 'only', 'element', 'shares', 'film', 'noir', 'sense', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'even', 'lost', 'when', 'one', 'mother', 'actions', 'are', 'motivated', 'almost', 'entirely', 'desire', 'care', 'child.Fourth', 'criticism', 'way', 'gay', 'character', 'love', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'character', 'First', 'verified', 'rewatching', 'film', 'nowhere', 'intimated', 'Alek', 'gay', 'presumption', 'are', 'reading', 'film', 'exactly', 'clear', 'love', 'Nagle', 'Alek', 'business', 'associate', 'when', 'perplexed', 'attempts', 'help', 'was', 'having', 'sex', 'was', 'not', 'know', 'being', 'utterly', 'wrongheaded', 'would', 'suggest', 'reviewers', 'who', 'see', 'unambiguously', 'falling', 'love', 'also', 'wrongheaded', 'Instead', 'believe', 'Alek', 'placed', 'position', 'where', 'see', 'business', 'opportunity', 'need', 'help', 'revive', 'father-in-law', 'when', 'heart', 'attack', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'off', 'ambulance', 'Alek', 'house', 'photos', 'reveal', 'entirely', 'different', 'world', 'kind', 'world', 'completely', 'closed', 'off', 'actions', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'based', 'love', 'romantic', 'sense', 'deep', 'profound', 'affection', 'quality', 'life', 'not', 'have', 'end', 'emotional', 'tension', 'even', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'differently', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Alek', 'would', 'have', 'attempted', 'kind', 'romantic', 'entanglement.Finally', 'else', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'labeling', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'about', 'far', 'mark', 'possible', 'Instead', 'movie', 'brimming', 'intelligence', 'one', 'marks', 'fact', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'thought', ""n't"", 'truly', 'dumb', 'film', 'more', 'think', 'realize', ""n't"", 'hold', 'water', 'conceptually', 'disintegrates', 'putting', 'end', 'thought']",N/A

After an argument between Margaret's son and his lover, his body is found near the sea deck. Margaret has no choice and needs to protect her son getting rid of the body. A few days later, two men start blackmailing her, because of a tape which reveals Margaret's son having sex with his lover.The great thing about this movie is that it reminds me of hitchcok's films. It's not so memorable like his movies, but really keeps hitchcoks tradition of showing a regular person, with a boring life getting involved with a crime scene and challenges she/he would never face.

688754,A387BD735MI50R,B00005Y4RY,R. Schultz,"[4, 5]","This movie tends to be like the musical score that opens it and weaves through it - simultaneously haunting and irritating.Deep End is essentially a two-character play, an intimate dance between a protective mother and her blackmailer. The haunting element is the unexpected, rare fondness that develops unspoken between these two. Their relationship is reminiscent of the saving tenderness and respect that grows between the characters played by Audrey Hepburn and Richard Crenna in Wait Until Dark.We feel this blackmailer's inclination to be better than his deeds early on, when he is left briefly alone in his victim's house. We can see him being touched by the order and goodness of the home Margaret has made for her absentee husband and her son. It makes me ache to realize how seldom such quiet appreciation happens in real life. I can hardly imagine a door-to-door salesman being diverted from his strictly commercial manipulations by anything he sees in a house. How much less likely it is that a blackmailer would pause to be charmed by his victim. But then, that's the poetic license we go to movies to find.The irritating part of the movie could be the result of a bad editing job. Parts of the movie seem to be missing. For the first quarter of the film, I was distracted by wondering who the older man living in the household was. I may have missed the explanation that he was a grandfather. However, I don't think the puzzling gaps in the relationship between the blackmailer and Margaret were due to my having missed anything. At one point, Margaret refers to the blackmailer's gambling debts. How did she know he even had a penchant for gambling? In the only meetings they presumably have, they are not shown exchanging much personal information at all. The viewer gets the feeling that some crucial scenes definitely got left on the cutting room floor.This is too bad, because the main value of this movie lies in its delicate quality of blossoming in the shade. We would like to understand more of what lay at the root of the blackmailer's absorption with the person who started out to be only a job to him. Tilda Swinton, the actress who plays the role of mother, seems too spare and monochromatic to inspire such a reversal, without our seeing more of an interaction between the two.However, the haunting, touching aspects of the film very much outweigh its lapses.I hope we will get to see Goran Visnjic in more big-screen roles.

Granted it's an exercise in neo-noir and hence not overly burdened with ideas or introspection. Unfortunately, it has inexcusable holes in basic character and action big enough for Lake Tahoe to flow through. One of them is the gay business, and this not for reasons of tolerance or homophobia. The boy in the film is only 17. He's been drinking (at the Deep End bar?) and having sex with a person the law might deem a pedophile, not a gay man. Is it probable that a post-modern suburban MOM would go to the bar with the wimpy request that the older man &quot;stay away from my son?&quot; Now it's true that she's a boomer and a yuppie. After all, her son plays water polo, and her daughter takes ballet. These are dead giveaways. But how much &quot;tolerance&quot; should we expect from her ?More probably, she'd try to get the bar closed down for serving minors and the older man arrested for statutory rape. Similarly, if she sought to reach her husband on a ship at sea, in these circumstances she certainly would say, &quot;Yes.

Indeed, the parents' ignorance of their son's homosexuality sets the film in motion.  (The father is the most isolated character of all -- always out at sea in the navy.)  One comical example of this is when the mother tells her father-in-law that she needs some money and he gives her $80, thousands of dollars less than she needs, but she can't bring herself to tell him the truth.  Yet despite their ignorance of the real concerns of other family members, there is a deep and abiding love in the family that can lead them to make extreme sacrifices, as we witness in the mother's actions throughout the film.  Even as we shake our heads at the mother's reckless actions (hiding a potential homicide) and irresponsible parenting (not pushing to find out whether her son killed his gay lover), we empathize with her love and maternal protective instincts.The camera loves Tilda Swinton, which is good, because you'll see a lot of closeups of her in this film. She gives an excellent performance of a quiet but tough-as-nails mother. Acting kudos must go to the son too.The blackmailer-with-a-heart-of-gold angle stretches credulity. Here's a tough guy knee-deep in crime, and he suddenly turns soft?
