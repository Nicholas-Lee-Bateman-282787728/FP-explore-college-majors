I made my way through the third, then bogged down in the fourth as it seemed located in Budapest or somewhere and I believe the plot was left there as well.  I used imdb to get an idea of what the heck was going on, then used imdb to check out the fifth movie, and the plots seemed the same, which was not a good thing...For the price it is worth it for the first movie, consider the second a bonus, and the third if you ever get really bored.",3,"Great condition dvd, movies start great, but...",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,696,"['Dvd', 'flawless', 'first', 'two', 'Prophecy', 'movies', 'were', 'quite', 'watchable', 'first', 'one', 'must', 'see', 'Walken', 'performance', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'funny', 'way', 'one', 'wince.The', 'second', 'one', 'very', 'watchable', 'well', 'off', 'quickly', 'made', 'way', 'third', 'then', 'bogged', 'down', 'fourth', 'seemed', 'located', 'Budapest', 'somewhere', 'believe', 'plot', 'was', 'left', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'used', 'imdb', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'then', 'used', 'imdb', 'check', 'out', 'fifth', 'movie', 'plots', 'seemed', 'same', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'price', 'first', 'movie', 'consider', 'second', 'bonus', 'third', 'ever', 'get', 'really', 'bored']",N/A

Fletcher ""David-Jack""","[0, 0]","The first movie was interesting enough, the story about the fallen angels etc. and Christopher Walken always plays intriguing characters. However, by the time the end of the first film came, I felt there were no surprises, no plot twists, no characters I really cared for. The film was very formulaic (though, we might look at the mid-90s to explain that). For its day, I suppose the film would have been a smash hit at the box office. I found it a little too preachy, though.The second film tried to be different, I thought, but ended up being almost the same; the fight for humanity, the jaded protagonist etc. In a strange way, the second film was reminiscent of Terminator, where the main character was pregnant with the saviour of humanity. Obviously the context was different, however I did find several similarities, which was a let-down for me.The third film tried to be really different again, where Christopher Walken is now the good guy. We see some familiar faces, but again it is quite preachy, and also highly formulaic, and to be honest it was not the most exciting movie. The storyline was not bad, I feel as though the films creators felt they needed to stay true to the original two (after all, it was intended to be a trilogy), which can be quite limiting.The fourth and fifth films lead me to question why they were even made. The trilogy is over, let it be. Instead, someone decided we needed another 2 instalments of a franchise already dead by the time the third film began production. The 4th film is very ordinary and the fifth is basically a remake of the fourth. I got the distinct sense that these films were only made for profit, rather than to add anything interesting or exciting to the franchise.Overall, if you enjoy movies about God and angels, then you may enjoy these a lot. However if you are seeking films with excellent characters, plot development, twists and turns and a conclusion worth watching, then perhaps consider something else.

I love books in this area of fantasy, but movies have been disappointing. I don't go to the movies very often, so I had not seen any of these in the theatre. I'm sorry now. Walken's interpretation of the archangel Gabriel is fabulous. The development of the character throughout the three movies in which he appears is subtle and fascinating. By the third movie he has changed dramatically and your interest in seeing how things will play out grows. This is not a series where the quality of the films deteriorates in script, character or creativity.The last two movies, without Walken, are not at quite the same level of intensity, but they are interesting in their own right. They continue to explore the very Old Testament version of the concepts of angels and their relationships to god and man. Our modern, sentimental view of angels dates from those romantic paintings of the Renaissance. Angels were not seen as being benign or necessarily sympathetic to humans in earlier times. They did the bidding of their ruler, which was often brutal and destructive. You may find your ""Roma Downey-Della Reese"" concepts challenged if you consider the underpinnings of these movies seriously. The inspiration comes straight out of the Bible.Leaving comparative religion aside, the movies contain excellent performances, clever plot angles and plenty of action. Chris Walken towers over the original trilogy like a colossus. His Gabriel is furious, funny, arrogant, brutal, and painfully childlike in his portrayal of the spoiled favorite son who has been supplanted in his father's favor (as he sees it) by smaller, imperfect, mortal creatures he can barely tolerate. His hatred and jealousy make him more like them (us, actually) every day.This set is a real bargain for the five movies included with all the entertainment they provide and thought they provoke.",5,Chris Ain't No Angel - not matter what he says!,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1982,"['recently', 'bought', 'set', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'talent', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'concept', 'love', 'books', 'area', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'very', 'often', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'theatre', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'now', 'Walken', 'interpretation', 'archangel', 'Gabriel', 'fabulous', 'development', 'character', 'three', 'movies', 'subtle', 'fascinating', 'third', 'movie', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'interest', 'seeing', 'how', 'things', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'grows', 'not', 'series', 'where', 'quality', 'films', 'script', 'character', 'creativity.The', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'Walken', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'intensity', 'are', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'continue', 'explore', 'very', 'Old', 'Testament', 'version', 'concepts', 'angels', 'relationships', 'god', 'man', 'modern', 'sentimental', 'view', 'angels', 'dates', 'romantic', 'paintings', 'Renaissance', 'Angels', 'were', 'not', 'seen', 'being', 'benign', 'necessarily', 'sympathetic', 'humans', 'earlier', 'times', 'did', 'bidding', 'ruler', 'was', 'often', 'brutal', 'destructive', 'may', 'find', 'Roma', 'Downey-Della', 'Reese', 'concepts', 'challenged', 'consider', 'underpinnings', 'movies', 'seriously', 'inspiration', 'straight', 'Bible.Leaving', 'comparative', 'religion', 'aside', 'movies', 'contain', 'excellent', 'performances', 'clever', 'plot', 'angles', 'plenty', 'action', 'Chris', 'Walken', 'towers', 'original', 'trilogy', 'colossus', 'Gabriel', 'furious', 'funny', 'arrogant', 'brutal', 'painfully', 'childlike', 'portrayal', 'spoiled', 'favorite', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'supplanted', 'father', 'favor', 'smaller', 'imperfect', 'mortal', 'creatures', 'can', 'barely', 'tolerate', 'hatred', 'jealousy', 'make', 'more', 'actually', 'day.This', 'set', 'real', 'bargain', 'five', 'movies', 'included', 'entertainment', 'provide', 'thought', 'provoke']",N/A
