1445430,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,B0058YPG1G,AC,"[1, 1]","I debated whether to leave a review for this show, given the many hundreds that already exist, but thought I'd go ahead and add to the chorus, as well as 'doing my part' to incrementally increase the strength of the overall 5-star rating that exists for this season's shows.Although I didn't expect that any of the show's fantastic qualities would suddenly 'get bad' (no pun intended), I was nonetheless surprised by just how good this 4th season was -- I thought it was even better than previous seasons (which is no small feat).  It was excellent from start to finish, and after viewing it, I was left uttering, ""Wow..."" aloud, and smiling (while shaking my head back and forth, slowly, as though practically mesmerized), in appreciation of yet another fantastically creative and amazingly well-written and acted sequence of shows.I watched this season set the way I watched the others -- in marathon viewing fashion (something made much easier, of course, by the limited number of episodes, but still -- it's a riveting show (especially the 4th season), and as such, after viewing one episode, I immediately wanted to begin viewing another episode).If you've watched the previous seasons, and are 'on the fence' in any way, when it comes to watching another season (I wasn't as gung-ho about the 3rd season -- I'm glad that I ventured forth in watching this season), then do yourself a favor, and watch this set -- and have it re-whet your appetite for this remarkable show, if it happens to need any such 'boost' (or if you are otherwise 'taking your time' getting to the 4th season (like I was) -- after viewing it, I wished I'd done so earlier)... :)Lastly, and as much as I feel as though I'm 'stating the obvious' (given the track record of this remarkable show), the writing, acting, and production in the 4th season are top notch... and I can't help giving a special 'tip of the hat' (so to speak) to Giancarlo Esposito, whose portrayal of the calm, cool, and collected -- yet ruthless and menacing -- Gustavo Fring, was striking, and is truly one of the most exceptional portrayals of a villain I've ever seen.What a show this is!",5,"Wow, wow, wow... an INCREDIBLE season",1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,2141,"['debated', 'leave', 'review', 'show', 'given', 'many', 'hundreds', 'already', 'exist', 'thought', ""'d"", 'go', 'ahead', 'add', 'chorus', 'as', 'well', ""'doing"", 'part', 'incrementally', 'increase', 'strength', 'overall', '5-star', 'rating', 'season', 'shows.Although', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'show', 'fantastic', 'qualities', 'would', 'suddenly', ""'get"", 'bad', 'pun', 'intended', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'good', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'previous', 'seasons', 'small', 'feat', 'was', 'excellent', 'start', 'finish', 'viewing', 'was', 'left', 'uttering', 'Wow', 'aloud', 'smiling', 'shaking', 'head', 'back', 'forth', 'slowly', 'practically', 'mesmerized', 'appreciation', 'yet', 'fantastically', 'creative', 'amazingly', 'well-written', 'acted', 'sequence', 'shows.I', 'watched', 'season', 'set', 'way', 'watched', 'others', 'marathon', 'viewing', 'fashion', 'something', 'made', 'much', 'easier', 'course', 'limited', 'number', 'episodes', 'still', 'riveting', 'show', 'especially', '4th', 'season', 'such', 'viewing', 'one', 'episode', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'begin', 'viewing', 'episode', '.If', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', ""'on"", 'fence', 'way', 'when', 'watching', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'gung-ho', '3rd', 'season', ""'m"", 'glad', 'ventured', 'forth', 'watching', 'season', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'set', 'have', 're-whet', 'appetite', 'remarkable', 'show', 'need', 'such', ""'boost"", 'are', 'otherwise', ""'taking"", 'time', 'getting', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'viewing', 'wished', ""'d"", 'done', 'so', 'earlier', 'Lastly', 'as', 'much', 'feel', ""'m"", ""'stating"", 'obvious', 'given', 'track', 'record', 'remarkable', 'show', 'writing', 'acting', 'production', '4th', 'season', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'giving', 'special', ""'tip"", 'hat', 'speak', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'portrayal', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'yet', 'ruthless', 'menacing', 'Gustavo', 'Fring', 'was', 'striking', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'exceptional', 'portrayals', 'villain', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'show']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

1445432,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B0058YPG1G,AKN,"[4, 4]","My addiction to this series is no different from the addiction of the methamphetamine users who are the consumers that main character Walter White supplies.Take a lifelong nerdy high school chemistry teacher, make him go off the deep end when he is given two years to live, throw every crazy unimaginable problem someone who cooks meth can have at him and you have something so suspensefull you can't tear your eyes away.Lead actor Bryan Cranston's wrinkled face and perpetually horror stricken expression supplies the backdrop to some truely gruesome yet fascinating situations.  This character wallows in deception and immorality, lying continually to those he loves, never giving a moments thought to what he is actually doing to contribute to the misery of the addicts he is supplying.  Any thoughts of right and wrong are strangely lacking in this man.  And yet, his friends and family continue to see him as a good and decent fellow.  His wife finally must accept that he is a constant liar and up to no good but gets sucked into his greed.All the acting is great in this.  From Walter's wife Skylar, who starts out as naive and moral and quickly succumbs to join her husband in his persuit of money, to DEA agent Hank, who although good at his job is obnoxious consistently in his forced, crude insulting humor, to his wife Marie who has amusing episodes of kleptomania, each character is fleshed out and interesting. Sleazy shyster Saul Goodman (s'all good man) provides comic relief.Son Walt Jr. provides the one character that remains pure, in contrast to his parents.Never have I seen anything that threw at the characters so many horrific dangerous situations simultaneously.  Danger comes at Walter from every possible place.  His lifebecomes a juggling act of lies, violence, drug cartel murderers, and greed.  While it was baffling to see this lifelong good guy turn into such a cold violent monster so easily,it was fun to see him squeek by continually as he walked the criminal tightrope between life, prison, and death.There were lots of glaring instances of ridiculous improbability at the end of the last episode which unfortunately I can't reveal here or it would spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it.  These instances were disappointing to me, as up until then this show had been pretty believable, without too many loose ends.  One concerns reporting to work at a drug lab in plain view of lots and lots of people and not expecting to get caught as well as leaving your car parked in front of it every day.Season Five begins next month.  Hopefully you will be caught up with all the Season Four episodes by then because each episode is a continuation of the last.As for me, I can't wait to see where this picks up.  Will Walter continue his drug making?How will he get it sold?  What will happen to his partner?This is the best TV dramatic serial of all time in my opinion.",5,My Obsession,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,2903,"['addiction', 'series', 'different', 'addiction', 'methamphetamine', 'users', 'who', 'are', 'consumers', 'main', 'character', 'Walter', 'White', 'supplies.Take', 'lifelong', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'make', 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'when', 'given', 'two', 'years', 'live', 'throw', 'crazy', 'unimaginable', 'problem', 'someone', 'who', 'meth', 'can', 'have', 'have', 'something', 'so', 'suspensefull', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tear', 'eyes', 'away.Lead', 'actor', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'wrinkled', 'face', 'perpetually', 'horror', 'stricken', 'expression', 'backdrop', 'truely', 'gruesome', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'situations', 'character', 'deception', 'immorality', 'lying', 'continually', 'never', 'giving', 'moments', 'thought', 'what', 'actually', 'doing', 'contribute', 'misery', 'addicts', 'supplying', 'thoughts', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'strangely', 'lacking', 'man', 'yet', 'friends', 'family', 'continue', 'see', 'good', 'decent', 'fellow', 'wife', 'finally', 'must', 'accept', 'constant', 'liar', 'up', 'good', 'sucked', 'greed.All', 'acting', 'great', 'Walter', 'wife', 'Skylar', 'who', 'out', 'naive', 'moral', 'quickly', 'succumbs', 'join', 'husband', 'persuit', 'money', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Hank', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'obnoxious', 'consistently', 'forced', 'crude', 'insulting', 'humor', 'wife', 'Marie', 'who', 'amusing', 'episodes', 'kleptomania', 'character', 'fleshed', 'interesting', 'Sleazy', 'shyster', 'Saul', 'Goodman', ""s'all"", 'good', 'man', 'comic', 'relief.Son', 'Walt', 'Jr.', 'one', 'character', 'pure', 'contrast', 'parents.Never', 'have', 'seen', 'anything', 'threw', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'horrific', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'simultaneously', 'Danger', 'Walter', 'possible', 'place', 'juggling', 'act', 'lies', 'violence', 'drug', 'cartel', 'murderers', 'greed', 'was', 'baffling', 'see', 'lifelong', 'good', 'guy', 'turn', 'cold', 'violent', 'monster', 'so', 'easily', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'squeek', 'continually', 'walked', 'criminal', 'tightrope', 'life', 'prison', 'death.There', 'were', 'lots', 'glaring', 'instances', 'ridiculous', 'improbability', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'would', 'spoil', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'instances', 'were', 'disappointing', 'then', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'pretty', 'believable', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'One', 'reporting', 'work', 'drug', 'lab', 'plain', 'view', 'lots', 'lots', 'people', 'not', 'expecting', 'get', 'caught', 'as', 'well', 'leaving', 'car', 'parked', 'front', 'day.Season', 'Five', 'begins', 'next', 'month', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'Season', 'Four', 'episodes', 'then', 'episode', 'continuation', 'last.As', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'up', 'Will', 'Walter', 'continue', 'drug', 'making', 'How', 'will', 'get', 'sold', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'partner', 'best', 'TV', 'dramatic', 'serial', 'time', 'opinion']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

1445435,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0058YPG1G,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","To borrow a couple of terms from Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel (later movie) A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, the previous season (third) of BREAKING BAD, while not without violence, is more ""weepy-tragic"" in its analysis of personal relationships, but this Season Four is full-out ""ultra-violent.""  Expect some general spoilers:  This is the year where practically everyone arms himself, whether it's a snub-nosed .38 revolver, a box-cutter, or a Ricin-laced cigarette.  The major players like Jesse Pinkman and Walter White take responsibility for their own protection, which means they keep disappearing at crucial moments, beyond reach even of multiple cell phones and daily routines.  It's the year where practically everyone goes rogue:  Walt's wife Skyler has financial secrets she can't share with her husband but with her lawyer, and even some she can't share with her lawyer but with her former employer. Walt's brother-in-law Hank Shrader, the DEA agent (Dean Norris), keeps sniffing ""something big"" under his nose, drug-wise; and even though he has officially been removed from his fruitless investigation he keeps poking around.  Even so, he doesn't know what we do, that Walt and the community's genial fried-chicken king and beloved community supporter, Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), have become essentially the Mexican drug cartel's New Mexico wing.  Trips south of the border give much of Season 4 the flavor of a modern Western yet, miraculously, the show's celebrated dark humor and interpersonal foul-ups are still evident.Walt and Gus, *narcotraficantes* both, are on the verge of becoming narco-terrorists.  Walt starts cooking up a bomb in the next-to-last episode, and by the season's end enough damage has been done that BREAKING BAD could easily have ended then.  Had the series not been such a success across the boards, it might have.  Another sixteen episodes were made, though, which rather confusingly are labeled and marketed as Seasons 5 and 6 with eight episodes apiece.  Some legends refuse to die, and the fan of BREAKING BAD who hasn't witnessed Season 4 yet will surely find it matches and at times even tops prior years.",5,An amazing Season 4:  Probably the best yet,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,2152,"['borrow', 'couple', 'terms', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'dystopian', 'novel', 'later', 'movie', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'previous', 'season', 'third', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'not', 'violence', 'more', 'weepy-tragic', 'analysis', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Season', 'Four', 'full-out', 'ultra-violent', 'Expect', 'general', 'spoilers', 'year', 'where', 'practically', 'everyone', 'arms', 'snub-nosed', '.38', 'revolver', 'box-cutter', 'Ricin-laced', 'cigarette', 'major', 'players', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'Walter', 'White', 'take', 'responsibility', 'own', 'protection', 'keep', 'disappearing', 'crucial', 'moments', 'reach', 'even', 'multiple', 'cell', 'phones', 'daily', 'routines', 'year', 'where', 'practically', 'everyone', 'rogue', 'Walt', 'wife', 'Skyler', 'financial', 'secrets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'husband', 'lawyer', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'lawyer', 'former', 'employer', 'Walt', 'brother-in-law', 'Hank', 'Shrader', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'sniffing', 'something', 'big', 'nose', 'drug-wise', 'even', 'officially', 'been', 'removed', 'fruitless', 'investigation', 'poking', 'around', 'Even', 'so', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Walt', 'community', 'genial', 'fried-chicken', 'king', 'beloved', 'community', 'supporter', 'Gus', 'Fring', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'have', 'become', 'essentially', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'cartel', 'New', 'Mexico', 'wing', 'Trips', 'south', 'border', 'give', 'much', 'Season', '4', 'flavor', 'modern', 'Western', 'yet', 'miraculously', 'show', 'celebrated', 'dark', 'humor', 'interpersonal', 'foul-ups', 'are', 'still', 'evident.Walt', 'Gus', '*narcotraficantes*', 'are', 'verge', 'becoming', 'narco-terrorists', 'Walt', 'cooking', 'up', 'bomb', 'next-to-last', 'episode', 'season', 'end', 'enough', 'damage', 'been', 'done', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'ended', 'then', 'Had', 'series', 'not', 'been', 'success', 'boards', 'might', 'have', 'sixteen', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'rather', 'confusingly', 'are', 'labeled', 'marketed', 'Seasons', '5', '6', 'eight', 'episodes', 'apiece', 'legends', 'refuse', 'die', 'fan', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'who', ""n't"", 'witnessed', 'Season', '4', 'yet', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'matches', 'times', 'even', 'tops', 'prior', 'years']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

I'm watching the final two episodes of last season again tonight because small things matter, and problem dogs are not always what we think they are...or who.  Right now, I have my eye on a man with a greying moustache and a certain law enforcement agency...I love a program that makes me use my imagination!  This one could train us all to be Sherlock Holmes, or darned-good CSIs.  Little, minute details come back to the characters and the plot in the most interesting ways.I was wrong...and right in speculations last week about the Challenger.  Yet, another of Walt's house of cards that has to topple.  Everything Walt does this season reflects a comment about him early on...an underachiever who walked away from great potential because of his ego.  This season, his ego and his frustration over not being able to flaunt his success will be his undoing, and he will take pretty much everyone with him.Jesse is finally beginning to understand his potential and his role in sculpting his life, such as it is.  He's finally listening to important little birds, but it's probably too late for him, even with epiphanies blossoming in front of him.  Aaron Paul needs to share best actor with Bryan Cranston this year.  Much as I love Michael C. Hall in Dexter, their intensity is the quiet scream of our own souls as they lash out, plot their futures, understand their past and make grand mistakes in judgement.  The difference between them and us is that they are the games our minds play with us each and every day.  They are us in a parallel Universe.  They are us in our worst fantasies...and in the end, fortunately, they are not us in our actions.Giancarlo Esposito, Gus Frin, is the master villain because he is the master manipulator, the master negotiator and to him, life has become a game where he doesn't care how he benefits, only how he plays, and yet, he has made at least two potentially fatal mistakes.Skyler is in so far over her head that she is drowning in the ocean that was once her backyard pool.  Everything that Walt has done and the situation, as she becomes more aware of it, simply pulls her farther out into a rip-tide she could never imagine.  How do you launder the kind of money the carwash is supposed to handle?  Where can she even put it?  And then, of course, there is Walt, his ego, his anger and his mouth...Hank has put enough together that he pretty much has to be the target again...Gus won't like where he is going.  Walt may go over some paranoid brink.

Not only is season 4 the best so far but the video and audio presentation with the blu ray is spectacular.  The black/white ratio is perfect and colors are vibrant and pop when necessary and subdued when in need.  The picture always has superb clarity and detail.  The beautiful outdoor shots which are a big part of this show look amazing.  Flesh tone is always realistic.  And the audio is perfection.  From hearing a pin drop to a gun shot the sound is always strong, clear and direct.  Dialogue is prominent and comes from the speakers strong and central.  The surround speakers are put to amazing use with this season.  Each episode here varies from dialogue driven scenes to powerful dramatic action scenes and the DTS 5.1 audio makes it even better.This is one show where the blu ray provides a far superior viewing experience to the dvd.  And that is saying a lot for the dvd also looks excellent.  BREAKING BAD is an amazing show with an overall plotline that crosses over so many different emotions and varying subject matter.  And the acting is excellent.  The entire cast from Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn just to mention a few continue to meet the high level of expertise this series demands.  It is surely one of the best drama series to ever be on television.  And the season 4 blu ray comes with amazing bonus features.  There are over 15 hours of them from an extended version of the amazing season finale, interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes and a gag reel.  The list goes on and on.  Bottom line, BREAKING BAD season 4 is a must for fans and the entire series is a must for fans of high quality television.  There is no waste in the extras.  It is a feast of information and background on this amazing series.  As I said, every season of this series is exceptional and highly recommended but with season 4 the show reached new highs.

1445451,A2OH5IR87L7F1B,B0058YPG1G,BigCityMtnWoman,"[1, 1]","This is a story about a guy who thought he could 'just' use his skills and cook a little speed and leave money for his family..This idea occurred as he was suddenly told he was dying soon, of terminal lung cancer, at about 45 years old. He got screwed financially -by his old pals-in a chemist patent (or something close to a patent). As a result, he is financially strapped  works as Cranston is now a high-school chemistry-teacher, his salary- 40k.While he is living the low-budget life, the fake friends who just forgot him, are really livin large. They do insist that he come to their big parties, why I dont know.  And now,- when Cranston's wife spilled his terminal secret, they want to help him -now that he is dying. Make amends suddenly. He is not havin it.Why people watch this is because it got beyond complicated. Cranston had to go over to the selling side of this drug-world hell when his young high-school student messed up the sales part of their partnership.  That is when it turned into a terrorizing sort of horror flick. (I dont like scary movies with ghosts etc..but this, is different, way different)When Cranston has to man-up, you see a transformation that is mind-blowing. He OWNS the worst Mexican Cartel thugs that are about to kill him. We watch them decide to try. I believe these guys could be real. No, the USA is not talkin about Mexican cartel. But they are here. One of the scenes, a head on a skateboard is based on a true practice done commonly in Mexico. One of the more famous killers for the one of the real Cartels often decapitates and sends souvenirs around.  I no longer want to move closer to the border-out of the worst ozone where seasons are milder. I think I will stay in the cold north country. Even though no one is safe, not even in Vermont.The whirlpool of events gives a believable picture of what drug dealing really is. See what is past the street corners and you go over to the wholesale side. It does not matter what role, in this world, that some person might think would be 'safe' to make a bit of fast cash. Thoughtful planning, great strategies- just dont pan out. Sleazy lawyers with brand new tricks fall flat. Seems everything fails. Clearly anyone involved, or just in the vicinity, can be killed--just to serve as a 'message' from competitors. Sure we have seen the 'let this massacre be a message to others, who would try to betray us' - this type of drug story has been told before.Definitely its Cranston AND Aaron Paul, his right arm, that makes this into a sort of psycho-drama, along with too many others to mention. Aaron can not be denied as the  crazy, street smart right arm of the gritty Cranston, whose life is like a runaway train ready to fly off the tracks.Its not /just/ violence-its a compelling story. Its too real to deny. In each episode I expect Walt to be killed, or someone around him killed. Close calls are all over the place. Oh yes, people die or get mangled real bad. You never know who is left, at the end of any episode.I think the drug-sellin+ usin-life-- is presented intensely well here. Intensely well. Cranston started out thinkin he had a month or two to live. He thought that he would get a little money to leave to his sharp-cookie/cool wife, AND his brilliant kid with some special needs, AND even enough for the future of their suprise baby who arrived mid-life, truly not planned. Seemed to be a lot to do, but he got there pretty fast, and all seemed posed to end well.Its a bizarre, wrenching mess that sort of turns into blackmail. If Cranston does not continue to produce-dot dot dot. His wife is not dumb. Cranston tried to keep his dealin sidejob secret from her. And eventually she gets siderailed as well, while he is 'out walking' too many hours, too many nites. She pushes to get him to open up to her, he pulls back and avoids the truth about where he 'goes.'He argues that he does have cancer, why should he not be allowed to just take a 'walk' when he must...  She is just not diggin it.Meanwhile, he learns to become at least as crazy acting- as the heavies who threaten him. The trained killers stir him to stand up, -face them down. Just a thrilling transformation of character. In my worst nightmrares.""Walt's"" stunning need to leave money for his family after he passes is hard to imagine. Where he gets this drive, to survive, while living with with terminal lung cancer.. As he sometimes chokes for air. He gets knocked down on the ground, kicked in the chest over and over, left in the dust choking.still it goes forward, week by week.  Its twistingly realistic, truly sick, and it stays real, ugly just like ugly reality.Its a brutal visual of what 'the life' really is not.The fourth season is just as much on-the-edge, just as full of new/bizarre events, as the first three. Unbelievable.Personally, I thought Sopranos was cheesy and 'full of drugs and violence,""- yet with no worries, predictable murders, sooh day-to-day. It tried to make the most greedy/base/-bunch -of meatheads- seem to have a good life. It worked if you like to see guys with blood in their fingernails eat interesting gourmet Italian food, and go back to it.  My opinion, Sopranos, were wanting to 'be all-Godfather,' and fell flat.Instead, I see Breaking Bad as a true tragedy of events, NOTHING about it glorifies violence. No one enjoys the money being made. No parties, no fancy cars and vacaions and women throwing themselves around the guys.Gut wrenching violence, new rules, old rules, it never gets slow and its never over. Drugs are shown to be a much deadlier business than most people can imagine or realize.We generally are dulled by chronic stories of bad guys, with watered down content, or by the latest news updates. It seems that fairly young people actually listen to some of the dumbest rap, and watch some of the duller 'hood' videos on MTV. As if these fake rich guys and some cheap-acting young women are all actually drawn to the dream of livin-large-just driving around in 250 grand cars all day, doin nothin-what a load.Breaking Bad blows that 'stoopit-stylin' fairytale to pieces.The REALISM HERE is what draws me in.  People dont get rich, they die tryin. Its real drug life, most people/, most young people, know that.But seein a family man stand up to a very angry cartel boss.. is stellar, if unlikely.  Cranston is tough enough, AND smart enough to hold the line.  Buy some time.

1445453,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0058YPG1G,B. Martin,"[1, 1]","The fourth season of the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed series, Breaking Bad opens with an episode that contains a shockingly gruesome act of violence (don't worry, no spoilers here) and concludes with an episode that features another shocking scene--perhaps the most jaw-droppingly violent in the show's four season run.  The two episodes serve as bookends to what is the most suspenseful, unsettling and violent batch of episodes yet. In fact, season four just may be the best yet which is going to place a lot of pressure on creator Vince Gilligan to bring things to a fitting conclusion with the upcoming fifth and final season.Anyone who has followed the series this far knows that there is no turning back now, not for the audience or for Walter White who has reached a point of no return.  When Breaking Bad debuted back in 2008, Walt was a flawed but sympathetic antihero.  Stricken with cancer, he opted to use his impressive knowledge of chemistry to cook and sell Crystal Meth in order to make quick money and leave a nest egg behind for his family.  But instead Walt has become an addict himself.  Not to the drug the manufactures and peddles, but to the endless cash flow it provides and to the sense of power that goes along with being a drug kingpin.  Season four finds Walt's transformation from mild mannered chemistry teacher and self loathing door matt to a black hearted villian nearly complete.  When he snarls at Skyler that, ""I am the danger!"" it's clear that there is no hope of redemption for him.  Perhaps most disturbing is that he doesn't appear to be too concerned with that.  You almost get the sense that he has become the man that he has always wanted to be.Cranston's performance is, as usual, superb and another Emmy win will likely be coming his way.  But every player in the ensemble is excellent as well.  Aaron Paul continues to bring new dimensions to Jesse who spends a large chunk of this season trying to come to terms with his murder of Gail at the end of Season three.  Anna Gunn portryas Skyler as a woman who is frightened yet resourceful and Dean Nooris as Walt's DEA angent brother-in-law continues to flesh out his character while positioning him to become a major foe for Walt in the show's final season.  And then there's Gus.  Portrayed brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito, he provides much of the sense of dread that runs throught season four.  It is absolutely fascinating to watch the cat and mouse game that plays out between he and Walter.  There is only room for one of these two in the meth business and season four barrels toward that inevitable conclusion like a freight train.How this will all end is anyone's guess but it sems more than likely that it won't be good.  Walt is in too deep and seems to have lost his soul quite a while ago.  The ultimate question may turn out not to be if Walter White will die, but rather will he rediscover his own humanity before that time comes.  That, more than anything else is what has driven this brilliant series from the very beginning.",5,I Am The Danger!,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3048,"['fourth', 'season', 'groundbreaking', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'series', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'episode', 'shockingly', 'gruesome', 'act', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'spoilers', 'here', 'episode', 'shocking', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'most', 'jaw-droppingly', 'violent', 'show', 'four', 'season', 'run', 'two', 'episodes', 'serve', 'bookends', 'what', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'unsettling', 'violent', 'batch', 'episodes', 'yet', 'fact', 'season', 'four', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'yet', 'going', 'place', 'lot', 'pressure', 'creator', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'bring', 'things', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'upcoming', 'fifth', 'final', 'season.Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'series', 'far', 'turning', 'back', 'now', 'not', 'audience', 'Walter', 'White', 'who', 'reached', 'point', 'return', 'When', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'debuted', 'back', '2008', 'Walt', 'was', 'flawed', 'sympathetic', 'antihero', 'Stricken', 'cancer', 'opted', 'use', 'impressive', 'knowledge', 'chemistry', 'cook', 'sell', 'Crystal', 'Meth', 'order', 'make', 'quick', 'money', 'leave', 'nest', 'egg', 'family', 'instead', 'Walt', 'become', 'addict', 'Not', 'drug', 'manufactures', 'peddles', 'endless', 'cash', 'flow', 'sense', 'power', 'along', 'being', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Season', 'four', 'Walt', 'transformation', 'mild', 'mannered', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'self', 'loathing', 'door', 'matt', 'black', 'hearted', 'villian', 'nearly', 'complete', 'When', 'snarls', 'Skyler', 'am', 'danger', 'clear', 'hope', 'redemption', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'disturbing', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'too', 'concerned', 'almost', 'get', 'sense', 'become', 'man', 'always', 'wanted', 'be.Cranston', 'performance', 'usual', 'superb', 'Emmy', 'win', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'coming', 'way', 'player', 'ensemble', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'bring', 'new', 'dimensions', 'Jesse', 'who', 'large', 'chunk', 'season', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'murder', 'Gail', 'end', 'Season', 'three', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'Skyler', 'woman', 'who', 'frightened', 'yet', 'resourceful', 'Dean', 'Nooris', 'Walt', 'DEA', 'angent', 'brother-in-law', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'positioning', 'become', 'major', 'foe', 'Walt', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'then', 'Gus', 'Portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'much', 'sense', 'dread', 'throught', 'season', 'four', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'out', 'Walter', 'only', 'room', 'one', 'two', 'meth', 'business', 'season', 'four', 'barrels', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'freight', 'train.How', 'will', 'end', 'anyone', 'guess', 'more', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'Walt', 'too', 'deep', 'have', 'lost', 'soul', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', 'ultimate', 'question', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'Walter', 'White', 'will', 'die', 'rather', 'will', 'rediscover', 'own', 'humanity', 'time', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'driven', 'brilliant', 'series', 'very', 'beginning']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

Obraztsov,"[198, 211]","The best television dramas of all time don't TELL you what is good or bad, or WHO is good or bad - they let people be people, and then you form your own opinions of the characters.  From the Sopranos, to the Wire, to the Shield, and now Breaking Bad.  And honestly, I think this may surpass them all, even the Sopranos.Meet Walter White. Well, if you're already on Season 4, I assume you know his story.  From dorky chemistry teacher/car wash worker to million-dollar methamphetamine cook, the transformation is unbelievable, yet believable at the same time.  You know his story, how he got here, and it all seems to fit.  The writers have made it clear for a long time that Breaking Bad was similar to Scarface - that Walt is comparable to the transformation of Mr. Chips to Scarface, and this season shows that perfectly.Walt has and still believes coming into season 4 that he is doing this all for his family.  But is he?  How far will he go?  And is this all for money, or something else?  We get to see many ethical dilemmas and inner moral battles in most of the characters this season - Walt, Skyler, Jesse, Mike, Hank, Marie and even maybe a small glimpse into the past of chicken man and meth king-pin - Gustavo Fring.Each episode gets more and more dark (did you think it was possible?), and Walt continues to surprise the audience with strange decisions and a terrifying look into the path he is going down.  If you look back at season 1 episode 1, before the meth and cancer, that angry, tortured individual was already inside of him.  That results in the question: was Walt ever even really that good of a guy?  He hasn't changed as much as you may think, but his anguish, pain, and stress is amplified by about 200x.  And as expected, the end of each episode is usually a major cliff-hanger, and you'll be begging for more.The acting is nothing but simply perfect.  Bryan Cranston as Walt will make you laugh, cry, or even get angry with him.  Giancarlo Esposito as Gus becomes a huge player this season, and he should be up for an Emmy.  The glazed, empty, evil look in his eyes is terrifying, and there aren't many boundaries he won't cross to get what he wants.This is definitely the darkest, thought-provoking, best acted show on television at the moment, and maybe ever.  If you haven't watched it, start from the beginning and follow Walt's odd and morally perplexing adventure into the life of a meth cook.",5,The parallels of good and evil.,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,2428,"['best', 'television', 'dramas', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'TELL', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'WHO', 'good', 'bad', 'let', 'people', 'be', 'people', 'then', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'characters', 'Sopranos', 'Wire', 'Shield', 'now', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'honestly', 'think', 'may', 'surpass', 'even', 'Sopranos.Meet', 'Walter', 'White', 'Well', ""'re"", 'already', 'Season', '4', 'assume', 'know', 'story', 'dorky', 'chemistry', 'teacher/car', 'wash', 'worker', 'million-dollar', 'methamphetamine', 'cook', 'transformation', 'unbelievable', 'yet', 'believable', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'fit', 'writers', 'have', 'made', 'clear', 'long', 'time', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'was', 'similar', 'Scarface', 'Walt', 'comparable', 'transformation', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'Scarface', 'season', 'perfectly.Walt', 'still', 'coming', 'season', '4', 'doing', 'family', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'inner', 'moral', 'battles', 'most', 'characters', 'season', 'Walt', 'Skyler', 'Jesse', 'Mike', 'Hank', 'Marie', 'even', 'maybe', 'small', 'glimpse', 'past', 'chicken', 'man', 'meth', 'king-pin', 'Gustavo', 'Fring.Each', 'episode', 'more', 'more', 'dark', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'Walt', 'surprise', 'audience', 'strange', 'decisions', 'terrifying', 'look', 'path', 'going', 'down', 'look', 'back', 'season', '1', 'episode', '1', 'meth', 'cancer', 'angry', 'tortured', 'individual', 'was', 'already', 'results', 'question', 'was', 'Walt', 'ever', 'even', 'really', 'good', 'guy', ""n't"", 'changed', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'think', 'anguish', 'pain', 'stress', 'amplified', '200x', 'expected', 'end', 'episode', 'usually', 'major', 'cliff-hanger', ""'ll"", 'be', 'begging', 'more.The', 'acting', 'nothing', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Walt', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'even', 'get', 'angry', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'Gus', 'huge', 'player', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'Emmy', 'glazed', 'empty', 'evil', 'look', 'eyes', 'terrifying', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'boundaries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cross', 'get', 'what', 'definitely', 'darkest', 'thought-provoking', 'best', 'acted', 'show', 'television', 'moment', 'maybe', 'ever', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'start', 'beginning', 'follow', 'Walt', 'odd', 'morally', 'perplexing', 'adventure', 'life', 'meth', 'cook']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

This season all my suspicions about Pinky and Brain are confirmed:  all the shaved heads represent slave labor at Auschwitz hence Jesse's appearance and persistent look of fear, Jesse and Walt's insistence that they will not work if the other is killed, Alberquerque with its barren landscape and low buildings is Auschwitz and YES! the Axis continues to be behind illicit drug activity worldwide.  Remember that Domingo's cousin was surnamed KOYAMA.Note the thin SEMITIC character who shrugs ""it's a living"" referring to his salvage business.  Get it?  SALVAGE work in the  Konzentrationslager, or KZ.And in Giancarlo's unforgettable scene at Casa Tranqillo, you will be reminded of Arnold Schwarzenegger inThe Terminator.This show is instrumental in directing our attention or at least a glance at the Wikipedia page at Nazi-era nuke scientist Werner Heisenberg who PROBABLY had something to do with U-864 (Hitler's Last Deadly Secret).

The fourth season lived up to the standards of excellence that the series had set, garnering more than a dozen Primetime Emmy Award nominations.  This DVD set contains all 13 episodes of Season Four that originally aired on AMC from July 2011 to October 2011.These episodes see the relationships between Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and between Walt and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) continue to have their ups and downs depending on the vicissitudes of their involvement in the meth business in Albuquerque.  Survival becomes even tougher as the three sink even deeper into the morass of crime--Walt also lies serially, including lying to himself about his motives.  His pride also comes back to haunt him again at a key moment, leading his DEA brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) to re-open his case.Another of this season's themes is that life is regressive, as several of the characters find that trouble often snowballs, finding its way to those already in trouble.  The violence of the show becomes even more gruesome in Season Four, but there are also awesome shots of the New Mexico desert.

I watched the three previous seasons on DVD and tore into season 4 as soon as the set arrived from Amazon.  It did not disappoint as the story of cancer stricken chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine cook Walter White spiraled even further out of control.From the opening episode, Box Cutter, that resolves season 3's cliffhanger to the final confrontation with drug kingpin/chicken franchise owner, Gus Fring in the season ending episode, Face Off, the tension is non stop as it is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels. Watching these characters stew in a hell of their own making makes for terrific drama.  Everyone is back for the ride: Walter, Jesse, Skylar, Hank, Mike, Marie, Gus, Walter Jr. Saul, and even nasty old Uncle Tio, who plays a very significant part in the action before the season is done.Impossible as it seems, Walter's life becomes even more complicated this season: he's increasingly on thin ice with Gus; his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, is starting to have divided loyalties; wife Skylar is buying a car wash as a cover to launder all the money Walt's meth making as brought in and trying to help her shifty former boss dodge the IRS at the same time; and his DEA agent brother in law, Hank, is sniffing at Gus's trail and getting closer to the laundry that houses Walt and Jessie's meth lab.  At every turn, Walter is finding himself in ever more desperate straits.And the viewer is left with the question first posed back in the very first episode: is Walter White a good man forced by dire circumstances to do bad things or was he an evil man all along, whose dark nature was liberated by his own very bad choices? There's no definitive answer in Season 4 for me, but the final image of the season ender will make up the mind of many viewers.The acting is exceptional, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter; he literally makes us feel this character's rage, panic and sheer hell bent determination in every line of dialogue and smallest gesture.  But all high praise to Aaron Paul as Jesse, Anna Gunn as Skylar, Dean Norris as Hank; Bob Odenkirk as Saul, Jonathon Banks as Mike, Mark Margolis (who does it all with his eyes) as Uncle Tio, and certainly to Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, the perfect embodiment of ice cold evil.  Because of these great actors, we feel we know their characters much better then they know themselves.  And let's not leave out the fine writing and directing.Is BREAKING BAD a scathing commentary on the decline of the middle class or a 21st Century film noir?

Meanwhile, he gets his brother-in-law back on his trail by intimating the dead guy they found isn't the real ""Heisenburg"", he buys $300 bottles of wine and a souped up sports car for his son.  He won't listen to sense from his wife - hey, Walt, how do you account for all this cash?  Oh, yeah, card shark!  His boss in an effort to make Jessie less of a liability has him team up with one of the muscle guys just to keep him busy, but Walter can't see the good in that - instead he brings in some of the local cleaning ladies to help clean up 'the lab' while Jessie's not there, whereon they are all deported back to Honduras afterwards!  Really, it's a joke how unreasonable and argumentative Walter has become - Jessie is seeming the sane one!I started getting into this fourth season toward the end of the second episode, and once it gets going the season really does take off..Just a note though.. I've had my reservations about Breaking Bad since Season 3 where one whole show was shot in the lab with them trying to kill a fly.  Whether or not it gave us insight into Walter's character it had seemed mainly like filler and that the writers were running out of ideas (note to the writers:  avoid too much time in the lab).  Well, I was sort of geared up for more of the same when I started Season 4 of Breaking Bad and the first episode didn't do a whole lot to change my general wariness..However, by the end of the second episode and on, interest kicks in and holds out pretty strong for the bulk of the season but by the last few episodes it starts losing steam mainly due to too many plot contrivances.  The first is that Jessie starts dominating Walt, throwing him around and beating him up in a few scenes and that just looks fake.  There's no way Jessie would be throwing Walt around, who is a lot bigger, stronger, and with even more attitude than when the show started with him as a mild mannered chem teacher.  For people who say this series is believable, explain that.  Then Walt makes a bomb all of a sudden - like hey, do they teach chem students that in grad school?  No, but perhaps they teach it to screenplay writers in ""Plot Contrivance 101"".  Unfortunately for the series,  scenes like this give the impression that they're grabbing at straws again.Breaking Bad, Season 4 has many good moments, and many weak ones as well, and while the writing is way far-fetched (though fun mostly) to begin with, Cranston's acting in earlier episodes is sometimes so over-the-top as to be unbelievable (sad to say, most of the best scenes this season usually involve characters other than Walt somehow). Later, it's less his acting that's over the top, and more the ridiculousnous of the scenarios, like when we're supposed to accept that the drug boss poisons the child of Jessie's girlfriend with the cigarette Walt had given Jessie.. like, what??!!!  And that Jessie thinks Walt had something to do with it!  Puh-lease.I've enjoyed this season more than the previous one, and a lesser season of Breaking Bad is still better than most, but what made the first 2 seasons so great was that it didn't go so far off the deep end as to completely defy the laws of logic.",4,Still managing to clock in at interesting...,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,3313,"['oh', 'man', 'tiresome', 'watching', 'Walt', 'make', 'one', 'unbeleivably', 'bad', 'decision', 'supposed', 'be', 'smart', 'one', 'Meanwhile', 'brother-in-law', 'back', 'trail', 'intimating', 'dead', 'guy', 'found', ""n't"", 'real', 'Heisenburg', '300', 'bottles', 'wine', 'souped', 'up', 'sports', 'car', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'sense', 'wife', 'hey', 'Walt', 'how', 'do', 'account', 'cash', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'card', 'shark', 'boss', 'effort', 'make', 'Jessie', 'less', 'liability', 'team', 'up', 'one', 'muscle', 'guys', 'just', 'keep', 'busy', 'Walter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'good', 'instead', 'local', 'cleaning', 'ladies', 'help', 'clean', 'up', ""'the"", 'lab', 'Jessie', 'not', 'there', 'whereon', 'are', 'deported', 'back', 'Honduras', 'afterwards', 'Really', 'joke', 'how', 'unreasonable', 'argumentative', 'Walter', 'become', 'Jessie', 'seeming', 'sane', 'one', 'started', 'getting', 'fourth', 'season', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'once', 'going', 'season', 'really', 'take', 'off..Just', 'note', 'though..', ""'ve"", 'had', 'reservations', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Season', '3', 'where', 'one', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'lab', 'trying', 'kill', 'fly', 'not', 'gave', 'insight', 'Walter', 'character', 'had', 'seemed', 'mainly', 'filler', 'writers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'note', 'writers', 'avoid', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'lab', 'Well', 'was', 'sort', 'geared', 'up', 'more', 'same', 'when', 'started', 'Season', '4', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'first', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'change', 'general', 'wariness..However', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'interest', 'kicks', 'out', 'pretty', 'strong', 'bulk', 'season', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'losing', 'steam', 'mainly', 'due', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'first', 'Jessie', 'dominating', 'Walt', 'throwing', 'around', 'beating', 'up', 'few', 'scenes', 'just', 'fake', 'way', 'Jessie', 'would', 'be', 'throwing', 'Walt', 'who', 'lot', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'even', 'more', 'attitude', 'when', 'show', 'started', 'mild', 'mannered', 'chem', 'teacher', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'series', 'believable', 'explain', 'Then', 'Walt', 'bomb', 'sudden', 'hey', 'do', 'teach', 'chem', 'students', 'grad', 'school', 'No', 'perhaps', 'teach', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'Plot', 'Contrivance', '101', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'scenes', 'give', 'impression', ""'re"", 'grabbing', 'straws', 'again.Breaking', 'Bad', 'Season', '4', 'many', 'good', 'moments', 'many', 'weak', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'writing', 'way', 'far-fetched', 'fun', 'mostly', 'begin', 'Cranston', 'acting', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'sad', 'say', 'most', 'best', 'scenes', 'season', 'usually', 'involve', 'characters', 'other', 'Walt', 'somehow', 'Later', 'less', 'acting', 'top', 'more', 'ridiculousnous', 'scenarios', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'accept', 'drug', 'boss', 'child', 'Jessie', 'girlfriend', 'cigarette', 'Walt', 'had', 'given', 'Jessie..', 'what', 'Jessie', 'Walt', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Puh-lease.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'season', 'more', 'previous', 'one', 'lesser', 'season', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'made', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'deep', 'end', 'completely', 'defy', 'laws', 'logic']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

While it has good acting, there are some things that have been troubling me. First off, Walt has become an unlikeable character at this point. What was once a man who was all in it for 'fam' has now become this egotistical prick. I'm not gonna lie, I was actually rooting for Gus this season. How do the writers let that happen? Aren't you supposed to maintain some shred of sentiment towards the main character so that the viewers want to root for the protagonist and keep watching? And God, if they show one more scene of him walking away from a pending explosion I'm going to explode! They did that in the first season, so why recycle it in the 4th? I was so hoping he'd just die already. Though, I'm pretty sure that's coming soon. My main issue was after Walt has been so cautious about not being caught with Jesse. He not only shows up at the hospital and vocally makes himself noticed in front of the cops, but he also brings a bomb in with him! Uhhhh, so I guess it's safe to say that next season the cops will somehow mention this to Dean and he will get access to the hospital tapes and see his brother-in-law: live and in living color! Also, I don't understand why Jesse has lived this long.You mean to tell me that Walt has been able to geuss all and I do mean ALL of Gus's plans to undermine him but he couldn't lose this perpetual screw up? Jesse is the biggest testament to Walt's weakness. And while we are all humans who have our own weaknesses, this is uncharactersitic for a man who takes all these precautions to keep his 'other' life hidden. Jesse has always been a liability. From the first season of him revealing Walt's info to Krazy-8 to several other acts of semi-retardedness he's committed (hydrochloric acid in tub incident, drained battery, talking Tuco out of takiing the poison, etc) and trust me I do mean et cetera. Why is Walt so devoted to him? And don't say it was answered already because the answer he gave Gus is not backed up by the plot. When Gus posed the question to Walt I was actually on the edge of my seat and not because of the acting but because I really wanted to know, too. Having access to all of the information as audience members and still not being able to grasp the answer to that question beforehand is a poor storyline.  I understand that now they have been through so much they've become emotionally invested in each other but what I'm saying is that it should have never gotten to that point. Jesse has been more of a roadblock than endearing. He was an idiot almost the whole 2nd and 3rd season. There is no question about his stupidity in the first season. BUT NOW I GET IT! They have used Jesse as a writing crutch to spare the life of Walt and vise versa for the 4th season. Crutches have become a sort of visual symbol throughout this season with Walt, Jr., Dean, and now the actual plot! Well I'm growing tired of these crutches and can't wait for them to turn on each other. That is the only way this show will interest me again for season 5. It was the shows comparison to The Wire that brought me here.

The series itself is the best drama ever to come to TV. Period. End of Story, as Betsy Brandt's character is wont to say. That's not the issue. The problem is that for those of us with significant hearing loss who depend on captions or subtitles will find these discs in particular do not have either. The DVDs are in French and Spanish. Well, hallelujah! Twice in Spanish for some stupid reason. I do not speak either language. For unexplained reasons, when Sony Entertainment put this season together wherever they do these things, people speaking English were completely left out of the picture. No captions or subtitles for you, speaker of English. Fooey on you! So, taking the bull by the horns, I finally got a decent answer from Sony quite recently. They apologized and said that this season above all others, made the mistake of no captions or subtitles in English. Does not really make any difference if you have an all-region DVD player. What matters is if you have a decoder. If you are sharp enough to install VLC Media Player onto your home theater operation, more power to you, because it might be able to decode what's on there.

1445525,A2IMXKLFI5YETU,B0058YPG1G,"James Schumaker ""Shoeone""","[0, 0]","The fact that I am reviewing a DVD that hasn't been produced yet for a series year that hasn't been completed yet should be a solid indicator that I am a big fan of this show.  Season 4 is every bit as good as the previous three seasons, and my only criticism is that Season 5 will apparently be the last for the series.  This is sad news for me -- I've been spending each week anticipating with pleasure what new bad decision the series characters will make.  They seem to have an inexhaustible repertoire, especially, of course, Walt.I don't want to discuss the show in too much detail, since that would lead to spoilers, so instead I will make a few bold predictions.  I have the feeling that the show is going to end badly for almost everybody, and if someone comes out alive and whole at the end, it will just be due to good luck. Walt is almost certainly a dead man, as he himself remarked in a recent episode.  Most likely, as the series ends, he will either die of cancer or finally fall victim to one of his numerous criminal enemies.  Jesse will either die of an overdose or get rubbed out (my money is on the former), and his surviving business partners, Skinny Pete and Badger will wind up in jail.  Hank will either get too close to Gus' operation and have a fatal accident, or, he might just keel over and die from a heart attack.  Marie and Skyler will most likely end up in jail, the former for renewed binges of shoplifting, the latter for accounting fraud, although Sky is crafty enough to get out of town with the cash before that happens, so maybe it won't turn out all bad for her. Meanwhile, Gus will either wind up sipping tequila on a Caribbean island, or in a hole in the desert.  I can't see him getting put in the slammer as he's too smart for that. Maybe he'll go back to Chile, as he seems to have something of a criminal past there. Mike, like any good soldier, will either follow Gus into exile or wind up in the same hole in the desert. Finally Saul will almost certainly end up behind bars, or murdered by an irate client, or perhaps both if he happens to land in the wrong prison.  Like I said, it looks bad for almost everybody, but that's what keeps me watching. As one of the few major characters not involved in some sort of criminal activity, Walter Jr. will probably go on to college and become a chemist, like his dad, in preparation for the spinoff series, Breaking Bad, Part 2.

Instead he is thrown into a world he knows nothing about and where mistakes can mean death. He starts to unravel some of what it takes to survive in the brutal, ruthless world he has entered into and he realizes just how big a mistake his original decision was.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone other than to say that the story does end so you do have closure instead of being brought to the edge only to find out the series has been cancelled. I've had this happen so many times on shows, I felt, were excellent and had great potential like; Heroes, Journey man, John Doe, Stargate Universe, Farscape (although they did finally make a movie), Firefly, etc., etc.To me, it is disrespectful to the viewers who have stuck by and they deserve closure by allowing a few more runs just to allow an end to be made. If anything, they could make digital only releases for fans to buy at Amazon or other pay to view site.I really did enjoy this series and hated that it ended but was so glad that it did end and didn't leave me never knowing what happened next.Warning: The series is about drugs, the cartel, and so has some graphic violence and language.

He sees the demands of the position and makes his moves accordingly. He tries to minimise the friction by keeping his emotions out of the picture. He will be ruthless, but only when he needs to be. When the demands of the position call for it, blood will be spilt. But when the position calls for quieter measures he will do this too - such as waiting on customers in his restaurant business.Walt sees himself as cast in the same mould. But he is deluding himself. He is fully rational only in his own mind. His days of being a carwash cleaner are over for good and there is no going back. He has never felt more alive than when hatching his adrenaline fueled plans. In reality, he is in touch with his own inner psychopath. It's the game itself that now turns him on.By contrast, for Gus it's mainly about the appreciation of capital. And the sacrifices that must be made to get at it. There is something almost noble about him.Walt is more of a terrifying suicide bomber. When his back is to the wall, he becomes very, very dangerous. He cannot be controlled. The mistake Gus makes is to think he can control Walt. Nitroglycerin is useful for clearing obstacles, but not if there is a bumpy road ahead.Gustavo's initial judgment is the correct one. He once rejected Walt as being unsuitable for the business. He should have stuck to that decision. But then we would all have been deprived of the ensuing drama.This is the end of Season 4.

From the first episode, &#8220;Box Cutter&#8221;, featuring Gus cutting someone&#8217;s throat open, you know this season will offer some shocking scenes.  Season 4 has several of my favorite episodes of the entire season, including &#8220;Hermanos&#8221; (Gus&#8217;s back story), &#8220;Salud&#8221; (massive showdown with the Cartel), and the season finale &#8220;Face Off&#8221; (which more than lives up to its name).  Rarely does the small screen produce such a big screen level powerhouse, but this show makes me feel like I&#8217;m watching a movie every episode.  The show never feels episodic; it&#8217;s like an epic novel adapted chapter for chapter, with all of the late-developing plot twists devised right from the very beginning.  Vince Gilligan and the writers seem to know where every character and idea was headed before Season 1 ever hit the air.

That's why I had high expectations for season four, and that's why I found season four to be quite disappointing.First, the drug kingpin Gus is the most fascinating character in the &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; series, and I expected his character and background to be fully developed with the same nuance and subtlety that went into developing the major characters in the series.  Instead, what we got was a lame backstory and a silly, melodramatic, and not at all believable resolution to the Gus vs. Mexican cartel storyline -- it just seemed lazy and hackneyed writing.In fact, the entire season seems disjointed, incoherent, and illogical.  There was too much emphasis placed on &#34;character development,&#34; which revealed nothing new about the characters and which just stalled the plot.  The way that Gus and Walter used Jesse as a proxy war was an interesting conceit, but given Jesse's absolute loathing of Gus not entirely believable.The main problem was that Walter White, who was at the very least sympathetic, interesting, and believable as a proud family forced to do wrong in season two and three, descends into madness and ceases to be sympathetic, interesting, and believable -- and in fact by the end of season three Walter becomes a detestable and loathsome character.

It is the reason that this show is still so great through the current seasons, and yet I can't help but it got to where it was through a cheat in the story telling.  The entire show has pretty much been flawless and without major gaps in logic or plot holes.  It is just one great twist after another.  What I can say is that is with the exception of this season.  I will say, without giving anything away, that the resolution from last season completely leaves me scratching my head.  Despite the fact that both Walter and Jesse should be in hot water for what they have done, Gus, for some reason, only holds it over Walt's head.  He then goes towards Jesse, to promote him in an attempt to separate Jesse and Walt, when that makes absolutely no sense, considering that he spent all of Season three trying to convince to let Jesse go at best, and kill him at worst, and now because Walt made a mistake and backed his friend, Gus is going to show him the error of his ways by doing the exact same thing.  This is not to say that there are not a lot of great twists and turns, or that Jesse wasn't needed in Gus's corner for the purpose of the finale, but I really found the explanations at the beginning of this season hard to swallow.  Like the reason they didn't trust Walt was because of his personality, which would make sense if they had a crystal ball, but really doesn't make sense considering that to this point, his reasoning to deal with Gus mostly had to do with his need to settle down and stop taking risks.  Like I said, still a great season and a great build up, but what I can say is that for the only time on the show, the writers do cheat a little bit to serve their story, but knowing where it goes from there, I'm rather glad they did.",5,Mixed bag with great ending,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1870,"['have', 'say', 'think', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'single', 'best', 'episode', 'ever', 'been', 'TV', 'reason', 'show', 'still', 'so', 'great', 'current', 'seasons', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'got', 'where', 'was', 'cheat', 'story', 'telling', 'entire', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'flawless', 'major', 'gaps', 'logic', 'plot', 'holes', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'twist', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'exception', 'season', 'will', 'say', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'resolution', 'last', 'season', 'completely', 'scratching', 'head', 'fact', 'Walter', 'Jesse', 'should', 'be', 'hot', 'water', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'Gus', 'reason', 'only', 'Walt', 'head', 'then', 'towards', 'Jesse', 'promote', 'attempt', 'separate', 'Jesse', 'Walt', 'when', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'considering', 'spent', 'Season', 'three', 'trying', 'convince', 'let', 'Jesse', 'go', 'best', 'kill', 'worst', 'now', 'Walt', 'made', 'mistake', 'backed', 'friend', 'Gus', 'going', 'show', 'error', 'ways', 'doing', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'Jesse', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'Gus', 'corner', 'purpose', 'finale', 'really', 'found', 'explanations', 'beginning', 'season', 'hard', 'swallow', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Walt', 'was', 'personality', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'had', 'crystal', 'ball', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'considering', 'point', 'reasoning', 'deal', 'Gus', 'mostly', 'had', 'do', 'need', 'settle', 'down', 'stop', 'taking', 'risks', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'season', 'great', 'build', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'time', 'show', 'writers', 'do', 'cheat', 'little', 'bit', 'serve', 'story', 'knowing', 'where', 'there', ""'m"", 'rather', 'glad', 'did']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

We see his gradual transformation from a Ned Flanders-like wimp to a hardened, rage-filled villain that would do Machievelli proud throughout the last 3 seasons, but things come to an explosive (pun intended) conclusion with the wrap of season 4.Now this is the way to portray a 'good man's descent into villainy' story.  Yeah lookin at YOU Darth Vader & George Lucas.In addition to Cranston's 3-time Emmy winning performance, other standouts include Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, brillaint character actor Jonathan Banks and Bob Odenkirk constant scene-stealer as Saul Goodman.  This rich cast of supporting characters give life to the well written story that constantly ramps the feeling of tension, danger and dread as we see Walt continue to spiral in a direction that will lead to an inevitable end.If you haven't started watching this series and enjoy crime drams like the Sopranos, Wire, The Shield, then this is a much watch.

The performance by the actors, the writers, the cinematography, the characters they all fit together perfectly and complement each other. This season things get much more intense as Walter finds out the more he gets into this world of organized crime, drug peddling, extortion, and other things that represent the underbelly of society the more danger seems to follow him. Walter walks a very fine line knowing that his amazing talents will be helpful for his employer/enemies but at the same time constantly look over his shoulder for the next approaching threat. In this season Walter White also aims too settle the score with old adversaries and move on with his life with his family and also to deal with the new conflicts that are gradually approaching. The acting is one of the many great things that makes this show so good.Bryan Lee Cranston (Walter White) and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) are both amazing and have a great chemistry between them. Also Anna Gunn (Skyler White) Dean Norris (Hank the DEA agent) are also amazing in the series and also Gus (Esposito) is an excellent main villain of this season. Also one of the most believable and relatable characters in the show Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) actually does have a minor case of CP which causes difficulty in motor skills. What also helps create the very realistic and gridy environment of the series is the set design. The music is like the premise of the show is very dark, and sometimes, humerous, corky, and vigorous.Overall this is a very good show and its on a very respectable network, AMC.

Walt is not going to die from his cancer but murdered by Mike, Gus' primary hit man.  Jesse is also being worked with to see if he can develop alliances with Gus and turn away from his loyalty to Walt.  The season builds and builds to an amazing conclusion.  All the time his brother in law Hank is following his trail without realizing it even from a wheelchair.  Skyler begins to operate a car wash to launder meth money and begins to take some gangster traits of her own.  Who survives and dies is an overarching question in this season but it also takes a good look at how the carnage and goings on affect the survivors.  Some retain a sense of morality even if warped but others seem to become convinced of their own immortality and claim the right to protect themselves from others no matter what the cost.

I can tell you that Breaking Bad still has all of it's zap, and remains, for me, one of the best TV shows of all time.  I don't make that comment lightly; I have seen a lot of good shows, only a few of which I would call terrific, and I don't often give five stars.The pattern for this season is familiar.  Having resolved the cliff hanger at the end of the last season, there is a bit of catching their breath, or is it cleaning up the wreckage, or even more correctly building a grim ""bottom"" upon which to build the new story of the fourth season.  Things are REALLY bad, and really broken.  Broken Bad.  For me, it was at this point, in the ultra-grim second episode, that it was clear what the only possible solution could be.  I think this was deliberate, that they set the agenda, and indeed the outcome, of this season, early on.But it seemed quite impossible to get there.  How could they get there?  How WOULD they get there?  DO they indeed get there?  I won't answer these questions, because therein lies the joy, and the jolt, of watching this show.I can tell you that after the grim second episode, it's like getting into a train that begins to accelerate on shaky tracks, and going faster and faster.  Minute by minute, it seems like it is going to jump the tracks.  At times, it seems like it already has jumped those tracks.Eventually, the metaphorical train rushes, unstoppable, to the inevitable end of the season, and what a season climax it is.  What happens seems impossible, and I think it is, but they had lot of fun doing the impossible.If you're interested in the fun they had doing it, they have a documentary on just the season finale for your enjoyment after you finish the episodes, on the last disc of the DVD set.  Because this is one memorable season finale, with imagery you won't soon forget, and it's worth learning more about it.",5,Holding up very well in fourth season,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1996,"['SPOILERSWith', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'few', 'seasons', 'one', 'wonder', 'will', 'start', 'lose', 'zap', 'can', 'tell', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'still', 'zap', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'comment', 'lightly', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'good', 'shows', 'only', 'few', 'would', 'call', 'terrific', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'give', 'five', 'stars.The', 'pattern', 'season', 'familiar', 'Having', 'resolved', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'bit', 'catching', 'breath', 'cleaning', 'up', 'wreckage', 'even', 'more', 'correctly', 'building', 'grim', 'bottom', 'upon', 'build', 'new', 'story', 'fourth', 'season', 'Things', 'are', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'really', 'broken', 'Broken', 'Bad', 'was', 'point', 'ultra-grim', 'second', 'episode', 'was', 'clear', 'what', 'only', 'possible', 'solution', 'could', 'be', 'think', 'was', 'deliberate', 'set', 'agenda', 'indeed', 'outcome', 'season', 'early', 'seemed', 'quite', 'impossible', 'get', 'there', 'How', 'could', 'get', 'there', 'How', 'WOULD', 'get', 'there', 'DO', 'indeed', 'get', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'therein', 'joy', 'jolt', 'watching', 'show.I', 'can', 'tell', 'grim', 'second', 'episode', 'getting', 'train', 'accelerate', 'shaky', 'tracks', 'going', 'faster', 'faster', 'Minute', 'minute', 'going', 'jump', 'tracks', 'times', 'already', 'jumped', 'tracks.Eventually', 'metaphorical', 'train', 'rushes', 'unstoppable', 'inevitable', 'end', 'season', 'what', 'season', 'climax', 'What', 'impossible', 'think', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'doing', 'impossible.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'fun', 'had', 'doing', 'have', 'documentary', 'just', 'season', 'finale', 'enjoyment', 'finish', 'episodes', 'last', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'memorable', 'season', 'finale', 'imagery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'worth', 'learning', 'more']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

Season 4 started off with a bang by having the scene where Gus shows us how truly monstrous he really is.I admit, for much of the season the show got a bit slow. But the last episodes certainly make up for the earlier slowness of the show. And the very last episode has one of the most epic scenes in the entire series (won't spoil it here but I'll just say that Gus has gotten what he deserves). This season seems to be more about tension and suspense for most of the season rather than action and it really delivers because my heart was beating quite fast in quite a few moments this past season.Like past seasons the acting by the entire cast is awesome. Cranston and Paul continue to shine in their roles as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman and deserve the awards they have received so far. Giancarlo Esposito is amazing as Gus and is one of my favorite TV villains ever (he really needs to at least be nominated for best supporting actor). And, of course, every other cast member are perfect in their roles as well.The people that create the DVDs and Blu-Rays have been awesome at making the DVDs/Blu-Rays better with more audio commentaries as each season is released. I hope there is an audio commentary on every episode for Season 4....I cannot wait to hear the commentaries on some of the episodes!!Overall, these last episodes have saved the season and kept it on par with the past three seasons and I cannot wait for season 5!",5,Breaking Bad is still amazing!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1554,"['favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'thought', 'S4', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'less', 'amazing', 'Season', '4', 'started', 'off', 'bang', 'having', 'scene', 'where', 'Gus', 'how', 'truly', 'monstrous', 'really', 'is.I', 'admit', 'much', 'season', 'show', 'got', 'bit', 'slow', 'last', 'certainly', 'make', 'up', 'earlier', 'slowness', 'show', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'scenes', 'entire', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Gus', 'gotten', 'what', 'season', 'be', 'more', 'tension', 'suspense', 'most', 'season', 'rather', 'action', 'really', 'heart', 'was', 'beating', 'quite', 'fast', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'past', 'season.Like', 'seasons', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'awesome', 'Cranston', 'Paul', 'continue', 'shine', 'roles', 'Walter', 'White', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'deserve', 'awards', 'have', 'received', 'so', 'far', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'amazing', 'Gus', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'villains', 'ever', 'really', 'least', 'be', 'nominated', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'course', 'other', 'cast', 'member', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'well.The', 'people', 'create', 'DVDs', 'Blu-Rays', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'making', 'DVDs/Blu-Rays', 'better', 'more', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'season', 'released', 'hope', 'audio', 'commentary', 'episode', 'Season', '4', '.I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'hear', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'Overall', 'last', 'episodes', 'have', 'saved', 'season', 'kept', 'par', 'past', 'three', 'seasons', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', '5']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

There are some that find the aura of menace that runs mostly below (but not always) the surface to be disturbing. What I like is the feeling that life is all too often like this. We get ourselves into predicaments for all the best reasons, even if they exhibit poor judgement, with the best of intentions. We cannot imagine what the consequences might be and then have to deal with them in order to attempt to keep the balance of our lives intact. I am fascinated by how the characters continue to exhibit real world dilemmas and values while confronting psychopathic realities and behaviors in others.

Seeing Walt transform from the underappreciated high school chemistry teacher with cancer to the crystal meth kingpin is really fun to watch!  I enjoyed this season a lot because it got a little darker in the storyline, Walt became even more of a badass, and it leads up well and gets you guessing for what they will do with the final season of Breaking Bad, season 5.  I personally liked the 3rd season a little more because of Hank's character being more prevalent and entertaining, but that's just me.

1445615,A2WYPTUQ7F16IH,B0058YPG1G,"Pinkyrose ""Pinky""","[1, 5]","Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and snap back at parents who ask them to do it. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believable.3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house-case over.4. At Tio's when Tuco throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. When there is a death like Tuco&#8217;s, law enforcement workers search miles around the crime scene.5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman/man  on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers. Gilligan shows that he is writing about how he thinks it goes in schools, not how it truly works.7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believable.10. Hank would have not only driven by the laundry once, he would have been driving by several times and he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night, and sent others to do the same.11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant. The DEA agents would have noticed one of their own acting suspiciously.17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. DNA does not go anywhere. Also, the magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed. All hospitals film everyone coming and going because of having narcotics present in the facilities.20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.28. Once Skyler found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????30. Walt would have been traveling to the Cayman islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skyler. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat in New Mexico with heat in the 100's to 110's?36. Skyler would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.38. The police are portrayed as bumbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believable that no police officer can put two and two together.39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Junior. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have done so in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle or even look dirty. Not believable.45. Too many bullets fly in the shooting scenes. My brothers both use automatic weapons and I know plenty of law enforcement officials who tell me that when the bullets fly from an automatic rifle, someone dies. Oh, Hank falls to the ground as his defense against automatic weapon fire. Hank would be dead. He would have been hit with many bullets and his head would explode like a watermelon bursting open.46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them. Too many ways both Walt and Jesse would have been seen with the ones they killed. All cities have cameras on the streets. All major roads have &#34;eye in the sky&#34; cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.47. All in all, too many things just are not believable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.48. Yes, I know I will get those letters from die hard fans, but get real--DNA would have sunk them after the first murder.49. Good fantasy, but not good realism.",5,Flaws with Breaking Bad,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,9161,"['Yes', 'am', 'fan', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'however', 'are', 'major', 'flaws', 'story', 'just', 'have',

1445616,A9J4EJK4Y8K6U,B0058YPG1G,prelln90,"[0, 0]","When I first started watching Breaking Bad, it was hard to tell a difference between this series and Weeds.  I say this because they are both about drugs, but after watching all four seasons I now see the difference.  The first season I felt was really slow and boring, but once you get into season two, you cannot stop watching.  The plot is set up greatly.  The episodes will start off with a flashback or a flash forward.  This makes you want to see more because you do not know when you will be able to view this clip.  The storyline makes sense.  A high school science teacher who has a pregnant wife, and has recently found out he has cancer, needs to make some money fast and easily.  When season four hits, Walt is willing to do whatever it takes to keep himself alive.  Thinking about it, who wouldn't try to keep themselves alive?  When you get to the last episode of season four, it leaves you hanging.  You know that the bomb was significant and caused a lot of damage, but it saved Walt and Jesse's lives.  My question is will Jesse ever find out what Walt did?  If he was to figure it out what would happen to their relationship?  Knowing that season five is out there, I want to view it right away.  I suggest this series if anyone is into watching action.  It is never ending and always keeps you hanging.",5,Worth Watching,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1321,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'difference', 'series', 'Weeds', 'say', 'are', 'drugs', 'watching', 'four', 'seasons', 'now', 'see', 'difference', 'first', 'season', 'felt', 'was', 'really', 'slow', 'boring', 'once', 'get', 'season', 'two', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'plot', 'set', 'up', 'greatly', 'episodes', 'will', 'start', 'off', 'flashback', 'flash', 'forward', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'clip', 'storyline', 'sense', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'cancer', 'make', 'money', 'fast', 'easily', 'When', 'season', 'four', 'hits', 'Walt', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'keep', 'alive', 'Thinking', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'keep', 'alive', 'When', 'get', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'four', 'hanging', 'know', 'bomb', 'was', 'significant', 'caused', 'lot', 'damage', 'saved', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'lives', 'question', 'will', 'Jesse', 'ever', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Walt', 'did', 'was', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'relationship', 'Knowing', 'season', 'five', 'there', 'want', 'view', 'right', 'away', 'suggest', 'series', 'anyone', 'watching', 'action', 'never', 'ending', 'always', 'keeps', 'hanging']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

Walter and Jesse cooked, and Gus led the meth to the money. These three lived under the threat of death, and in the fourth season we realize it is either Gus or Jesse and Walter. The episodes leading to the finale were tough, tense and violent. When the big bang came, it was so unexpected. It was an exquisite set-up, Walter hiding at the Senior Nursing Home, outside the the window, and the cute little white haired lady yelling hello to him.  Gus arriving with his entourage, and then leaving in that fashion. Kudos!Skyler knows the story, and now she is implicated, big time. Walt Junior goes on trusting his dad as the best there is, and wondering what is wrong with his mother. The baby oblivious to everything.  Hank will be vindicated at the end, the lab burned down and he realized something was there. Hank alone suspected Gus. Here is a man who can't see inside his own family, but everything else seems pretty clear headed.

1445618,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0058YPG1G,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","I loved Season One, was disappointed in the second and third and was was happily surprised when Season Four picked up again.  There's plenty of action, some new locales---the Drug dealer's nice spread in Mexico and a nursing home and a car wash in Albuquerque.  Jesse goes through some major changes and grows from a punk kid to a responsible adult....well as responsible as a meth maker could be said to be.  He finds a new love which helps him and shaves his head which gives him a new mean, lean look...matching that of the new Walt.  Walt is still Walt, flayling around, but he, too, is helped out in this series by the knowledge of Sklyer so we don't have the constant drain of his energy by having to lie to her.  Now he just lies to Hank and Marie but they seem so inconsequential that we don't much care. I have to say that in the final scene he looks....magnificent!  It does concern me that Walt, who is a sweet loving father never seems to think about what meth actually does to young people.  He stays in his clean lab and it's Jesse who rubs shoulders with the meth heads who are not an attractive bunch.I think what adds too to the entertainment value of this season are the supporting characters who are by now more well-developed.  First off is the amazing Gustavo Fring. Who could have conceived of a such a character...a  brilliant, hyper-polite, Black Chilean chicken cook/drug dealer?!  His treatment of his trusted aid with the box cutter was chilling, to say the least.  And his amazing courtesy, his super straight posture, his skill in the kitchen....what a guy!  The actor's face is quite beautiful, I think, reminding me of the mask of an Egyptian pharoah and time after time we see his expression change just imperceptibly to give a hint of what's really going on inside.  He did a brilliant job.  I liked the way the writers didn't reveal  Gus's back story until this episode.  I kept wondering what would have made such a nice-looking man so dangerous.  This episode gave us the answer and also hinted at his friendship with Gale, the young chemist.  I loved his name, too...so perfectly odd.  I checked in the Albuquerque phone book and found no Fring.We meet the too-good-looking Ted Beneke again and he shows more of his slimey personality.  Too bad about that rug, Ted!Saul Goodman is hilarious and brings comic relief to each scene he appears in as well as some practical advice to our boys.  Saul's a snappy dresser, too...you gotta love him.The 12-step group gave another interesting change of pace.  I loved the scene in which Jesse broke into a rage at the leader who kept advising him to ""accept"" himself and his actions.  Yea Jesse...he remains the voice of authenticty in the show, even as he does have his own ups and downs.Mike is intriguing, too.  The sweet grandpop who bought balloons to his grandchild and who seems to have a warm spot in his heart for Jesse, is also capable of a lot of killing.  Did they leave him behind in Mexico?  I hope he comes back.All is all I think there was enough interesting human drama going on to offset the sheer violence.  That's what made this season better than the last two.  I hope it keeps up.",4,Season Four -- better than Two and Three,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,3179,"['loved', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'disappointed', 'second', 'third', 'was', 'was', 'happily', 'surprised', 'when', 'Season', 'Four', 'picked', 'up', 'again', 'plenty', 'action', 'new', 'locales', '-the', 'Drug', 'dealer', 'nice', 'spread', 'Mexico', 'nursing', 'home', 'car', 'wash', 'Albuquerque', 'Jesse', 'major', 'changes', 'grows', 'punk', 'kid', 'responsible', 'adult', '.well', 'as', 'responsible', 'meth', 'maker', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'new', 'love', 'head', 'new', 'mean', 'lean', 'look', 'matching', 'new', 'Walt', 'Walt', 'still', 'Walt', 'flayling', 'around', 'too', 'helped', 'out', 'series', 'knowledge', 'Sklyer', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'constant', 'drain', 'energy', 'having', 'lie', 'Now', 'just', 'Hank', 'Marie', 'seem', 'so', 'inconsequential', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'have', 'say', 'final', 'scene', '.magnificent', 'concern', 'Walt', 'who', 'sweet', 'loving', 'father', 'never', 'think', 'what', 'meth', 'actually', 'young', 'people', 'clean', 'lab', 'Jesse', 'who', 'shoulders', 'meth', 'heads', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'attractive', 'bunch.I', 'think', 'what', 'too', 'entertainment', 'value', 'season', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'well-developed', 'First', 'off', 'amazing', 'Gustavo', 'Fring', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'conceived', 'such', 'character', 'brilliant', 'hyper-polite', 'Black', 'Chilean', 'chicken', 'cook/drug', 'dealer', 'treatment', 'trusted', 'aid', 'box', 'cutter', 'was', 'chilling', 'say', 'least', 'amazing', 'courtesy', 'super', 'straight', 'posture', 'skill', 'kitchen', '.what', 'guy', 'actor', 'face', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'think', 'reminding', 'mask', 'Egyptian', 'pharoah', 'time', 'time', 'see', 'expression', 'change', 'just', 'imperceptibly', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'inside', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'liked', 'way', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'Gus', 'back', 'story', 'episode', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'nice-looking', 'man', 'so', 'dangerous', 'episode', 'gave', 'answer', 'also', 'hinted', 'friendship', 'Gale', 'young', 'chemist', 'loved', 'name', 'too', 'so', 'perfectly', 'odd', 'checked', 'Albuquerque', 'phone', 'book', 'found', 'Fring.We', 'meet', 'too-good-looking', 'Ted', 'Beneke', 'again', 'more', 'slimey', 'personality', 'Too', 'bad', 'rug', 'Ted', 'Saul', 'Goodman', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'relief', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'practical', 'advice', 'boys', 'Saul', 'snappy', 'dresser', 'too', 'got', 'ta', 'him.The', '12-step', 'group', 'gave', 'interesting', 'change', 'pace', 'loved', 'scene', 'Jesse', 'broke', 'rage', 'leader', 'who', 'kept', 'advising', 'accept', 'actions', 'Yea', 'Jesse', 'voice', 'authenticty', 'show', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'ups', 'downs.Mike', 'intriguing', 'too', 'sweet', 'grandpop', 'who', 'bought', 'balloons', 'grandchild', 'who', 'have', 'warm', 'spot', 'heart', 'Jesse', 'also', 'capable', 'lot', 'killing', 'Did', 'leave', 'Mexico', 'hope', 'back.All', 'think', 'was', 'enough', 'interesting', 'human', 'drama', 'going', 'offset', 'sheer', 'violence', 'what', 'made', 'season', 'better', 'last', 'two', 'hope', 'up']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

1445622,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B0058YPG1G,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[3, 5]","WARNING: This Series Is Extremely Addictive (Spoiler FREE Review)This series truly has a perfect balance. The drama, both crime and family, is portrayed excellently. There is a nice blend of dark and light humor. The action and tension keeps you addicted and craving more. Then there are equal parts of character development and exploration that add a nice depth to the mix. Add all those elements together and they have found the perfect formula for this series. It really earns it's reputation as one of television's greatest series (filling a specific void that has been lingering since series like The Sopranos, The Shield and The Wire left our screens). This season is great and Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to show how they earned their respective 2010 Best Lead/Supporting Actor Emmy Awards. Their pairing and subsequent chemistry are what binds this series together.Some have said this season was too slow for too long and that the series lost its previously inspired pacing, I had similar thoughts but trusted the writing staff and if the beginning of the season is slower paced the last four or five episodes certainly balance out the equation with nonstop twists, action and developments.The fourth season consists of the following thirteen episodes:1 Box Cutter2 Thirty-Eight Snub3 Open House4 Bullet Points5 Shotgun6 Cornered7 Problem Dog8 Bug9 Hermanos10 Salud11 Crawl Space12 End Times13 Face OffThis season is once again amazingly crafted. It picks up exactly where the third season left off with a suspenseful and eventful premiere that sets up a conflict that plays out the entire season, slow burn has been most used to describe it. If it seemed to slow down after that initial episode and focus on character exploration it can be forgiven as the show has earned that by this point. By episode 9 things are clearly building to an endpoint of magnificent crafting and the final 5 episodes are amazingly entertaining in escalating proportion. The key to this fourth season will be rewatch value, what seemed to be slower paced filler will be seen in second viewing as establishing important plotlines that needed to pay off by the finale.  A finale which Gilligan has said was crafted to be satisfactory as a series finale in case the show didn't make it back (which thankfully it has).*The one thing I agree felt random though was a storyline that once again focused on Marie stealing things, not sure what that paid off towards in the long term? Anyone else have ideas?Special Features:I'll list the official specs when they are announced but these sets always have behind the scenes and some informative audio commentaries with Vince Gilligan and the actors. While I love Mad Men and those sets reveal a lot of information in their commentaries they are nowhere near the Breaking Bad sets when it comes to behind-the-scenes. The Breaking Bad sets are, in my opinion, the best television series sets you can buy for your money.  Both in terms of features and the aforementioned rewatch value.The other thing about Breaking Bad, and I've said it before but will keep saying it, is that it has it's own unique niche. There are other great series on television, arguably Mad Men, Walking Dead and Boardwalk Empire among others, but Breaking Bad has something all its own. It doesn't have a period setting, it doesn't have any supernatural elements such as vampires or zombies, it is set in a modern day reality. While those other things are fun, Breaking Bad is a refreshing series that doesn't have to pay service to anything other than its story. This means that it is always attemping to tell its story in unique and interesting ways. They are always trying to break new ground and push the envelope in every way. The directing, the music selection, the writing/storytelling, every single element of this series tries to do something new or original and it is quite apparent when watching any of the episodes.  Viewers also have to realize how little funds this great series is given to work with in comparison with others, keeping that in mind I'd say they definitely utilize their money for optimum production value. So if this season seems to play slower in the begining I say that after three amazing seasons the writer's and crew have earned that right. This will no doubt be the most breathing room the series ever has, now that there are officially only 16 episodes left in its production life, they will be running towards a finish in a fashion one can only expect from Breaking Bad.I should note I own the first three seasons on Blu-ray and they look great, but I've also seen them on DVD and they still look pretty darn good, so DVD buyer's won't be missing much. That said I'll definitely being going all in for the fourth time and getting the Blu-ray. I had withdrawal symptoms while waiting between the third and fourth seasons and while I hope they take time to craft the final 16 episodes properly I really want to get my next fix started by next year at this time. I can't wait to buy this and hopefully it comes out long before the fifth season so that I can have a temporary fix, though I assume they will try to coincide its release with the next season premiere

Every nerve-wracking scenario you can think of (and not) comes to a head in these episodes. Secondary characters begin to play a major part and, in light of Walt's increasing loss of control, they almost outshine the main character's genius. I won't repeat what others have rightly said about the complexity of the plot and character development - every compliment is deserved.I would, however, like to add that the soundtrack is incredible. Not only the music provided by Dave Porter is eerie and unnerving (particularly at the end of ""Crawl Space""), but also the ""random"" mix of old and newer hits give Breaking Bad that cherry on top. In truth, nothing is random about the songs - I downloaded a lot of them (lists of songs used in respective episodes are available online, as the official soundtrack only contains some songs from seasons 1 & 2). I was astounded how well the lyrics often fit to the story unfolding; you'd think they were written specifically for BB, the way ""Negro Y Azul"" was. Examples include ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" by Gnarls Barkley or ""Catch Yer Own Train"" by The Silver Seas, though Ana Tijoux, Holy F*** and the many reggae greats make it such an all-rounder that I watch for the plot as much as for the new musical inspiration.

Then there is television that challenges the viewer, drags them into the story and gives them a flawed hero to relate to.  This series is the latter.  Everything about the Walter character makes us want to dislike him - he is not just a drug dealer but a drug manufacturer.  His ability to rationalize moral questions in order to justify what he does makes us uneasy.  But what makes us uneasy is the very fact that we begin to relate to Walter and we realize that the seed of Walter is in all of us and we have to say, ""but for the grace of God, there go I.""  Spoiler alert: if you are one concerned about ultimate justice and making sure Walter pays for his crimes, you will not like the end.  Other ""evil-doers"" in the story pay the price but not Walter.  And we are left wondering why he should be different from the others.

I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.SPOILERS:After the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.Walt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.Gus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.END OF SPOILERS:""Breaking Bad"" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator/producer/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't ""lite"" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.While the Blu-ray doesn't look as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.The 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.The special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the ""Inside Breaking Bad"" featurettes. We also get ""Better Call Saul"" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get ""uncensored"" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.The fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.Highly recommended.",4,"The fourth season of ""Breaking Bad"" gets a very good presentation as well as some terrific special features--recommended.",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3176,"['fairly', 'typical', 'say', 'season', 'first', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'was', 'game', 'changer', 'case', 'fourth', 'season', 'IS.Blu-ray', 'review', 'contents', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'Blu-ray', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'same', ""'d"", 'give', 'season', '5', 'stars', 'BD', '4', 'transfer', 'issues.SPOILERS', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murder', 'Gale', 'who', 'Gus', 'had', 'hired', 'eventually', 'replace', 'Walt', 'Jessie', 'unlikely', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'found', 'once', 'again', 'demand', 'increasingly', 'unhappy', 'Gus', 'who', 'STILL', 'had', 'plans', 'replace', 'point', 'murder', 'Gus', 'pushes', 'Jessie', 'dark', 'place', 'been', 'before', 'never', 'quite', 'so', 'deep', 'Skylar', 'decides', 'Walt', 'must', 'have', 'way', 'funnel', 'massive', 'amount', 'money', 'making', 'decides', 'invest', 'business.Walt', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Jessie', 'back', 'knowing', 'particular', 'eventually', 'put', 'Gus', 'way', 'also', 'as', 'long', 'Gus', 'can', 'get', 'access', 'Jessie', 'man', 'not', 'need', 'Walt', 'longer', 'will', 'put', 'Walt', 'Skylar', 'son', 'harm', 'way', 'well.Gus', 'Jessie', 'feel', 'important', 'one', 'stunning', 'set', 'pieces', 'season', 'home', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Mexico', 'where', 'Gus', 'plans', 'ultimately', 'eliminating', 'competition', 'not', 'realizing', 'Walt', 'similiar', 'plans', 'own.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'television', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'given', 'competition', 'there', 'AMC', 'other', 'networks', 'Creator/producer/writer', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'craft', 'dark', 'compelling', 'TV', 'series', ""n't"", 'lite', 'entertainment', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'looking', 'something', 'will', 'entertain', 'asking', 'difficult', 'questions', 'taking', 'characters', 'like', 'sometimes', 'admire', 'down', 'road', 'temptation', 'should', 'look', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'stunning', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'issues', 'banding', 'occur', 'are', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'just', 'episode', 'Most', 'previous', 'seasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'issue', 'recall', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'look', 'again', 'confirm', 'why', 'perplexing', 'problem', 'here.The', '5.1', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'good', 'use', 'directional', 'effects', 'present', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'presented', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Blu-ray.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'set', 'including', 'videopod', 'casts', 'commentary', 'tracks', '13', 'episode', 'are', 'usually', 'quite', 'informative', 'also', 'get', 'extended', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'Inside', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'also', 'get', 'Better', 'Call', 'Saul', 'commercials', 'series', 'amusing', 'gag', 'reel', 'variety', 'featurettes', 'production', 'series', 'also', 'get', 'uncensored', 'versions', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'final', 'episode', 'fourth', 'season.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'brink', 'Walt', 'final', 'descent', 'madness', 'world', 'adopted', 'final', 'shot', 'episode', 'how', 'desperate', 'how', 'madness', 'Jessie', 'everyone', 'contact', 'with.Highly', 'recommended']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

""Walt"" (Bryan Cranston from Drive, Malcolm in the middle) is an incredible actor and really nails the character.  He can handle the script, has the acting chops (who would of guessed a largely comedy actor had such drama chops) and makes his part real and gritty.""Jesse"" (Aaron Paul) actually won an Emmy Award for season 1 (I think?) so I guess they gave him a larger role in seasons 2-4.  Don't get me wrong he does an outstanding job, it's just his dialog parts too often seem longer and speech oriented, as opposed to plot development.  I found myself disengaged a couple of time throughout the season with him.Overall, a great series about drug abuse that even points out indirectly most meth heads do not get clean (I think 3% that try have one year clean).  Violent too, though again it shows meths effect on society.",4,"Knocked off a star due to ""Jesse"" overacting IMHO.",1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,927,"['Anti-hero', 'show', 'not', 'glorify', 'drug', 'use', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'down', 'hard', 'Walt', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Drive', 'Malcolm', 'middle', 'incredible', 'actor', 'really', 'character', 'can', 'handle', 'script', 'acting', 'chops', 'who', 'would', 'guessed', 'largely', 'comedy', 'actor', 'had', 'such', 'drama', 'chops', 'part', 'real', 'gritty', 'Jesse', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'actually', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'season', '1', 'think', 'guess', 'gave', 'larger', 'role', 'seasons', '2-4', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'outstanding', 'job', 'just', 'dialog', 'parts', 'too', 'often', 'seem', 'longer', 'speech', 'oriented', 'opposed', 'plot', 'development', 'found', 'disengaged', 'couple', 'time', 'season', 'him.Overall', 'great', 'series', 'drug', 'abuse', 'even', 'points', 'out', 'indirectly', 'most', 'meth', 'heads', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'clean', 'think', '3', '%', 'try', 'have', 'one', 'year', 'clean', 'Violent', 'too', 'though', 'again', 'meths', 'effect', 'society']",Breaking Bad: Season Four

1445680,A1SMTC16E3UW9T,B0058YPG1G,"Yogesh. Pama ""Yogesh""","[2, 2]","I started watching season 1 with some apprehension.I found the subject matter vaguely unappealing, as I did the main characters.  However, the show had come  highly recommended by a reliable source and I persevered.  Still, I wasn't absolutely sold after the first season, despite admitting readily that the writing and story line were innovative and unpredictable and the direction and camera work stunning.More than 2 years later I caught up with the second, third and fourth seasons, again having been advised by my friend not to miss out.  However this time I fell right into it and gobbled up the entire fare in the shortest possible time.  WOW!  Even my wife, who normally refuses point blank to watch films with too much violence, was completely mesmerized.Without hesitation or exception, I now consider Breaking Bad one of the VERY BEST shows that TV has to offer and what is more, that I have ever seen.WHY?Because it satisfies deeply and intelligently on just about all levels.  The writing, camera work, editing, the total freshness and unpredictability of events to come, its innate intelligence, AND, above all, the outstanding humor (if deliciously black).  And there there's the totally remarkable and utterly believable acting from all concerned.  For fear of omission, I'd rather not mention any names, as all of the main characters' performances are beautifully crafted and superbly executed.Well done to you all!  I really hope and trust that the people responsible for the creation of this amazing series, have received the praise that they deserve.
