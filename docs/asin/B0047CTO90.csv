It's all goo, silliness, and cutesy slop--just barely tolerable.  Oh, those smart, articulate little kids.  Oh, that old duffer being drooled over by the hot pants school teacher.

1388362,A3LZ5AU3KJEQCR,B0047CTO90,Carl Stewart,"[16, 16]","While it would be difficult to call this relatively minor Masterpiece Contemporary film great movie-making, I think it would be impossible to watch it and not be smiling virtually all of the way.  The premise is a simple one;  a water leak at the National Gallery in London threatens to damage many of the invaluable works of art.  The Curator decides that the National must be emptied of its paintings until the water leak is found and repaired.  The paintings are carefully boxed and taken to a remote village in Wales to be placed in a former underground slate mine.  Of course, the sight of many large trucks winding through their mountainous Welsh village arouses the interest of the townspeople.  There is no great intrigue or mystery here but the movie is eminently watchable because of several things;  first are the performances of the two lead characters, Trevor Eve as the curator, and Eve Myles as the somewhat eccentric schoolteacher at the one room schoolhouse in the little village of Manod.  There are also fine performances by some child actors.  There are surely many less pleasant ways to spend an hour and a half.  A nice, happy, romantic ending, although a bit improbable, is still a satisfying one.Masterpiece Contemporary: Framed",5,"A ""small"" delightful story, beautifully told and acted",1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1252,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'call', 'relatively', 'minor', 'Masterpiece', 'Contemporary', 'film', 'great', 'movie-making', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'watch', 'not', 'be', 'smiling', 'virtually', 'way', 'premise', 'simple', 'one', 'water', 'leak', 'National', 'Gallery', 'London', 'damage', 'many', 'invaluable', 'works', 'art', 'Curator', 'National', 'must', 'be', 'emptied', 'paintings', 'water', 'leak', 'found', 'repaired', 'paintings', 'are', 'carefully', 'boxed', 'taken', 'remote', 'village', 'Wales', 'be', 'placed', 'former', 'underground', 'slate', 'mine', 'course', 'sight', 'many', 'large', 'trucks', 'winding', 'mountainous', 'Welsh', 'village', 'interest', 'townspeople', 'great', 'intrigue', 'mystery', 'here', 'movie', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'several', 'things', 'first', 'are', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'curator', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'somewhat', 'eccentric', 'schoolteacher', 'one', 'room', 'schoolhouse', 'little', 'village', 'Manod', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'surely', 'many', 'less', 'pleasant', 'ways', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'nice', 'happy', 'romantic', 'ending', 'bit', 'improbable', 'still', 'satisfying', 'one.Masterpiece', 'Contemporary', 'Framed']",Masterpiece Contemporary: Framed

1388369,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0047CTO90,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 20]","""Framed"" is a new television co-production of the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), and the American PBS--public broadcasting stations-- the Masterpiece Theatre Contemporary program.  It stars the intense and gripping Trevor Eve as Quentin Lester, a curator at London's world-famous National Gallery that houses some of the world's most valuable, most loved art work. (Eve stars in the mystery seriesWaking the Dead - The Complete Season 1 and Pilot Episode, andHeat of the Sun Boxed Set).  His co-star is Eve Myles as Angharad Stannard, schoolteacher in Manod, a small, remote Welsh village that was largely abandoned after its local mines went dry.  (Myles was once called ""Wales' best-kept secret"" by Russell T. Davis, screenwriter ofCasanova (Masterpiece Theater), who created the role of Gwen for her inTorchwood: The Complete First Season. The actress was last seen on Masterpiece Theatre as Maggy inLittle Dorrit. She has appeared in a number of other BBC television series includingDoctor Who: The Complete Fifth SeriesandMerlin: The Complete First Season). The filmed entertainment was based on a best-selling British childrens' book of the same name (Framed) by Frank Cottrell Boyce, who also wrote the screen play.Lester is portrayed as a man who prefers ""his"" glorious pictures to messy old humanity, and doesn't realize how lonely and estranged he is.  That is, until the malfunction of the Gallery's overwhelmed, Victorian-era plumbing system floods the place and requires emergency measures.  The pictures must be evacuated.  So the gallery officials borrow a page from history - actual, true history, according to Boyce's production notes:""During World War II, Winston Churchill made the safety of the paintings in the National Gallery his personal responsibility. Art is often looted in wartime (that's how a lot of the paintings in the gallery got there in the first place), and he was determined that it wouldn't happen in London. The paintings were hidden in a vast cave, in a slate mine, a mile underground in the remote town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales. It was supposed to be top secret but a convoy of trucks must have been a fairly conspicuous event in the town. Especially as the railway bridge was too low to let them pass and they had to lower the road.""Thus, the gallery officials decide, once again, to truck the pictures to the same disused slate mine, in the village here called Manod.  And in Manod, Lester bumps up against the adorable, feisty and eccentric schoolteacher Angharad, who is too young to be his daughter, and a busload of adorable, feisty school children, all of whom take too much interest in his precious Raphaels, Titians, Donatellos and Velasquez.  Well, it's interesting to look at rural Wales, and the photography is fine.  The acting is appropriate to the vehicle.  Apart from that, the plot shows all too clearly its lineage as a childrens' book, and is all too predictably linear.  The whimsy is sometimes thick as the local fog, and the sentimentality could flood that vast cave in the mines.  Dunno, perhaps Eve wanted to lighten up his intense and somber image, but I wish he'd chosen another way to do it.",2,Shows All Too Clearly Its Lineage as a Childrens' Book,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,3180,"['Framed', 'new', 'television', 'co-production', 'BBC', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'American', 'PBS', 'public', 'broadcasting', 'stations', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Contemporary', 'program', 'intense', 'gripping', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'Quentin', 'Lester', 'curator', 'London', 'world-famous', 'National', 'Gallery', 'houses', 'world', 'most', 'valuable', 'most', 'loved', 'art', 'work', 'Eve', 'stars', 'mystery', 'seriesWaking', 'Dead', 'Complete', 'Season', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'andHeat', 'Sun', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'co-star', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'Angharad', 'Stannard', 'schoolteacher', 'Manod', 'small', 'remote', 'Welsh', 'village', 'was', 'largely', 'abandoned', 'local', 'mines', 'went', 'dry', 'Myles', 'was', 'once', 'called', 'Wales', 'best-kept', 'secret', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davis', 'screenwriter', 'ofCasanova', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'who', 'created', 'role', 'Gwen', 'inTorchwood', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'actress', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Maggy', 'inLittle', 'Dorrit', 'appeared', 'number', 'other', 'BBC', 'television', 'series', 'includingDoctor', 'Who', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'SeriesandMerlin', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'filmed', 'entertainment', 'was', 'based', 'best-selling', 'British', 'childrens', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Framed', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play.Lester', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'glorious', 'pictures', 'messy', 'old', 'humanity', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'lonely', 'estranged', 'malfunction', 'Gallery', 'overwhelmed', 'Victorian-era', 'plumbing', 'system', 'place', 'emergency', 'measures', 'pictures', 'must', 'be', 'evacuated', 'gallery', 'officials', 'borrow', 'page', 'history', 'actual', 'true', 'history', 'according', 'Boyce', 'production', 'notes', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'made', 'safety', 'paintings', 'National', 'Gallery', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'Art', 'often', 'looted', 'wartime', 'how', 'lot', 'paintings', 'gallery', 'got', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'determined', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'London', 'paintings', 'were', 'hidden', 'vast', 'cave', 'slate', 'mine', 'mile', 'underground', 'remote', 'town', 'Blaenau', 'Ffestiniog', 'North', 'Wales', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'top', 'secret', 'convoy', 'trucks', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'conspicuous', 'event', 'town', 'Especially', 'railway', 'bridge', 'was', 'too', 'low', 'let', 'pass', 'had', 'lower', 'road', 'Thus', 'gallery', 'officials', 'decide', 'once', 'again', 'truck', 'pictures', 'same', 'disused', 'slate', 'mine', 'village', 'here', 'called', 'Manod', 'Manod', 'Lester', 'bumps', 'up', 'adorable', 'feisty', 'eccentric', 'schoolteacher', 'Angharad', 'who', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'daughter', 'busload', 'adorable', 'feisty', 'school', 'children', 'whom', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'precious', 'Raphaels', 'Titians', 'Donatellos', 'Velasquez', 'Well', 'interesting', 'look', 'rural', 'Wales', 'photography', 'fine', 'acting', 'appropriate', 'vehicle', 'Apart', 'plot', 'too', 'clearly', 'lineage', 'childrens', 'book', 'too', 'predictably', 'linear', 'whimsy', 'sometimes', 'thick', 'local', 'fog', 'sentimentality', 'could', 'flood', 'vast', 'cave', 'mines', 'Dunno', 'perhaps', 'Eve', 'wanted', 'lighten', 'up', 'intense', 'somber', 'image', 'wish', ""'d"", 'chosen', 'way', 'do']",Masterpiece Contemporary: Framed

Trevor Eve is Quentin Lester, a stuffy sort despite his generally laid-back but upscale appearance (think TV's Frasier if he wasn't so often an ass) and who also happens to manage London's National Gallery.  A convenient problem occurs requiring Lester to undertake a hare-brained plan to save priceless works of art and involves said small town and a network of forgotten caves.  Of course it's really just the excuse to get Lester to meet Angharad Stannard (Eve Myles), a Bohemian, bookishly sexy schoolteacher, the sort of kind and genuine spirit one can't help but fall in love with.  There is the requisite collection of harmless eccentrics and also a family, the Hughes, whose struggles are at times a bit cloying, though the youngest daughter, Minnie, is played with such kinetic alacrity that she makes up for it.  I found myself rooting for Lester and Angharad -- the trouble with most romances is that I don't really care much for the people involved, but these two characters, as well as the actors playing them, are winningly sympathetic because they are such appealing people.  And while some people may criticize the television production for being too ""light,"" sometimes we need an antidote from the tribulations of real romance, where compromises and disappointments can take their toll.  Here, true love rises above petty self interest, and that's not just entertaining, it's soul affirming.
