333356,A3QQO9GVE0GOFE,6302777283,Louis Rios,"[209, 210]","First of all, it's useful to know that there are two sets of ""Richard Scarry"" videos available, each produced by a different company:  Cinar/Polygram/USA Films offers a video series called ""The Busy World of Richard Scarry"", and Sony/Random House has a set of videos named like ""Richard Scarry's Best (fill in the blank) Video Ever"".  There are notable differences between them.The ""Busy World of...."" series consists of episodes from an actual television series, although I don't know what network originally carried it.  It's kind of bland and generic kids TV, and it sorely lacks the Richard Scarry charm.  Not recommended.Our family much prefers the ""Best...Video Ever"" home video series. This series features simple storylines and really sweet, catchy songs that both preschoolers and parents enjoy even after multiple viewings.  ""Best Learning Songs"" is probably our favorite because it covers such a variety of subjects.  The story is extremely simple:  Huckle and friends put on a show in their backyard. Their show consists of gently educational songs about the alphabet, counting, shapes, opposites, common courtesy, etc.On the downside, the animation is pretty primitive, the image quality doesn't improve from VHS to DVD (we now own both), and the price could be better for a 30-minute program.  But those charming, educational songs really carry the day, and both of our kids were completely entranced by this series of videos while they were preschoolers.",4,A sweet video that enchants toddlers,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,1469,"['First', 'all', 'useful', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'sets', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'videos', 'available', 'produced', 'different', 'company', 'Cinar/Polygram/USA', 'Films', 'video', 'series', 'called', 'Busy', 'World', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'Sony/Random', 'House', 'set', 'videos', 'named', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'Best', 'fill', 'blank', 'Video', 'Ever', 'are', 'notable', 'differences', 'them.The', 'Busy', 'World', 'series', 'episodes', 'actual', 'television', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'network', 'originally', 'carried', 'kind', 'bland', 'generic', 'kids', 'TV', 'sorely', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'charm', 'Not', 'recommended.Our', 'family', 'much', 'Best', 'Video', 'Ever', 'home', 'video', 'series', 'series', 'simple', 'storylines', 'really', 'sweet', 'catchy', 'songs', 'preschoolers', 'parents', 'enjoy', 'even', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Best', 'Learning', 'Songs', 'probably', 'favorite', 'variety', 'subjects', 'story', 'extremely', 'simple', 'Huckle', 'friends', 'put', 'show', 'backyard', 'show', 'gently', 'educational', 'songs', 'alphabet', 'counting', 'shapes', 'opposites', 'common', 'courtesy', 'etc.On', 'downside', 'animation', 'pretty', 'primitive', 'image', 'quality', ""n't"", 'improve', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'now', 'own', 'price', 'could', 'be', 'better', '30-minute', 'program', 'charming', 'educational', 'songs', 'really', 'carry', 'day', 'kids', 'were', 'completely', 'entranced', 'series', 'videos', 'were', 'preschoolers']",N/A

Furthermore, the bad sound quality really bothered me so much that I had to throw away this DVD.  For young children, good quality audio (music, verses, etc.) is a must, and this DVD doesn't deliver that.  There are alot of noise from the start to finish.

333358,ALWKZ81HDSCC1,6302777283,Stefanie  N,"[6, 6]","Richard Scarry's Best Learning Songs video brings together catchy songs, both familiar (&quot;Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes&quot; for instance) and new.  Huckle and the gang are putting on a variety show for family and friends which highlights all the things they know. (This implication that a kid can be an expert on a lot of subjects is a nice confidence-booster.) The material is illustrated and sung in a very clear way.  A song about shapes has the viewer identifying circles, squares and triangles in Busytown storefronts, and then those shapes are isolated and outlined so your child can see a direct correspondence between objects and geometric shapes.  All the songs are done in a similarly clear manner without a lot of overload.  The children's voices are robust and refreshingly non-professional.  Well, I guess they must be professionals or they wouldn't be on this video--but none of them sound like they're auditioning for &quot;Annie.&quot;",5,Simple and sweet,970012800,"09 27, 2000",2000,959,"['Richard', 'Scarry', 'Best', 'Learning', 'Songs', 'video', 'together', 'catchy', 'songs', 'familiar', 'quot', 'Head', 'Shoulders', 'Knees', 'Toes', 'quot', 'instance', 'new', 'Huckle', 'gang', 'are', 'putting', 'variety', 'show', 'family', 'friends', 'highlights', 'things', 'know', 'implication', 'kid', 'can', 'be', 'expert', 'lot', 'subjects', 'nice', 'confidence-booster', 'material', 'illustrated', 'sung', 'very', 'clear', 'way', 'song', 'shapes', 'viewer', 'identifying', 'circles', 'squares', 'triangles', 'Busytown', 'storefronts', 'then', 'shapes', 'are', 'isolated', 'outlined', 'so', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'direct', 'correspondence', 'objects', 'geometric', 'shapes', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'similarly', 'clear', 'manner', 'lot', 'overload', 'children', 'voices', 'are', 'robust', 'refreshingly', 'non-professional', 'Well', 'guess', 'must', 'be', 'professionals', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'video', 'none', 'sound', ""'re"", 'auditioning', 'quot', 'Annie.', 'quot']",N/A
