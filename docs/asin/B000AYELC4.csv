935129,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000AYELC4,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Originally broadcast by the BBC over the Christmas period in 1996, THE MOONSTONE is based on the classic Wilkie Collins novel, regarded as one of the first great detective stories.  Although this 2-part TV version cuts out many pertinent events from the original novel, it moves at a cracking pace and is quite entertaining when taken in the right spirit.The ""moonstone"" in question is a priceless gem, stolen from a sacred Hindu temple by Sir John Herncastle (Terrence Hardiman), the black sheep of the Verinder family.  When he attempts to visit his niece Rachel (Keeley Hawes) on her birthday, he is politely turned away, but vows to never forget the girl or the present he has set aside for her.  On Rachel's 18th birthday, Franklin Blake (Greg Wise) finally presents Rachel with the gift from now-dead Herncastle - the moonstone gem.  During the ensuing night, however, the stone mysteriously disappears from Rachel's bedroom.  Franklin calls in London's esteemed Sergeant Cuff (Antony Sher), but he runs into nothing but roadblocks, culminating in Rachel, bewildered and angry, running back to London despite the protestations of Franklin, Cuff and her mother Lady Julia (Patricia Hodge).A year passes, in which time Franklin has been completely estranged from Rachel, and the case, frustratingly, unsolved.  But a trail of new clues will soon emerge into the light, leading Franklin, Rachel and Cuff to the real culprit... but will they be too late to reclaim the moonstone?Despite it's shortcomings, this MOONSTONE is quite enjoyable, and a lot of the credit must go to the cast.  Greg Wise (""Madame Bovary"", ""Cranford"") and Keeley Hawes (""Wives and Daughters"", ""Tipping the Velvet"") pair beautifully as Franklin and Rachel, and their scenes together are a delight.  Patricia Hodge adds a great deal of wry, pithy humour to Lady Julia, and Antony Sher is fantastic as the inspector.  The Verinder house is stocked with suspects including disturbed chamber maid Rosanna (Lesley Sharp) and her companion ""Limping Lucy"" (Elizabeth Berrington).There is an earlier BBC miniseries from 1972 which I hope to see and compare soon, but in the meantime I can heartily recommend this 1996 production.",4,"tight and compact ""Moonstone"" a prime showcase for Wise and Hawes",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2197,"['Originally', 'broadcast', 'BBC', 'Christmas', 'period', '1996', 'MOONSTONE', 'based', 'classic', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'novel', 'regarded', 'one', 'first', 'great', 'detective', 'stories', '2-part', 'TV', 'version', 'cuts', 'out', 'many', 'pertinent', 'events', 'original', 'novel', 'cracking', 'pace', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'when', 'taken', 'right', 'spirit.The', 'moonstone', 'question', 'priceless', 'gem', 'stolen', 'sacred', 'Hindu', 'temple', 'Sir', 'John', 'Herncastle', 'Terrence', 'Hardiman', 'black', 'sheep', 'Verinder', 'family', 'When', 'visit', 'niece', 'Rachel', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'birthday', 'politely', 'turned', 'away', 'never', 'forget', 'girl', 'present', 'set', 'aside', 'Rachel', '18th', 'birthday', 'Franklin', 'Blake', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'finally', 'Rachel', 'gift', 'now-dead', 'Herncastle', 'moonstone', 'gem', 'ensuing', 'night', 'however', 'stone', 'mysteriously', 'Rachel', 'bedroom', 'Franklin', 'London', 'esteemed', 'Sergeant', 'Cuff', 'Antony', 'Sher', 'nothing', 'roadblocks', 'culminating', 'Rachel', 'bewildered', 'angry', 'running', 'back', 'London', 'protestations', 'Franklin', 'Cuff', 'mother', 'Lady', 'Julia', 'Patricia', 'Hodge', '.A', 'year', 'passes', 'time', 'Franklin', 'been', 'completely', 'estranged', 'Rachel', 'case', 'frustratingly', 'unsolved', 'trail', 'new', 'clues', 'will', 'soon', 'emerge', 'light', 'leading', 'Franklin', 'Rachel', 'Cuff', 'real', 'culprit', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'reclaim', 'moonstone', 'shortcomings', 'MOONSTONE', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'cast', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'Cranford', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'Tipping', 'Velvet', 'pair', 'beautifully', 'Franklin', 'Rachel', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'delight', 'Patricia', 'Hodge', 'great', 'deal', 'wry', 'pithy', 'humour', 'Lady', 'Julia', 'Antony', 'Sher', 'fantastic', 'inspector', 'Verinder', 'house', 'stocked', 'suspects', 'including', 'disturbed', 'chamber', 'maid', 'Rosanna', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'companion', 'Limping', 'Lucy', 'Elizabeth', 'Berrington', 'earlier', 'BBC', 'miniseries', '1972', 'hope', 'see', 'compare', 'soon', 'meantime', 'can', 'heartily', 'recommend', '1996', 'production']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[13, 14]","Wilkie Collins's ""Moonstone"" was the earliest known detective novel, so it's inevitable that someone would have made a good adaptation of it: Suspense, superstitition, and suspicion are kept intact in the 1996 adaptation. There are one or two casting flaws, but overall it is magnificently done.During a battle in India, Colonel Sir John Herncastle stole the fabled Moonstone from a statue, and apparently brought down a curse on himself. Many years later, a young relative named Franklin Blake (Greg Wise) brings the Moonstone to the country manor of young Lady Julia (Patricia Hodge). But immediately things start to go wrong.The Moonstone is stolen in the middle of the night, and everyone has an alibi. A mysterious band of Indian brahmins is hanging around. A house-maid, who is smitten with Franklin, commits suicide. And Lady Julia, who is suspected of stealing it herself, refuses to investigate further -- or to speak to Franklin. Desperate to know the truth, Franklin and the eccentric Sergeant Cuff (Antony Sher) try to unravel the mystery of the Moonstone....Wilkie Collins wrote dozens of books and plays, but ""Moonstone"" is undoubtedly his best one. And for a Victorian-era novel, it's rather unprettified: drugs, mystical gems, conquerers, murder, and true love. It sounds like a bomb, but instead it's an entracing look at the dark side of that era of English history. The opening scene, where Franklin dreams of a murderous Sir John, is one of the most riveting (if a bit theatrical) scenes of the movie.The darkness of the plot is in contrast to the beautiful surroundings -- lots of stately houses, ornate furniture and manicured gardens. Robert Bierman does an excellent job with the direction, slowly building up tension and suspicion. He does not skimp on personal details either, such as how the mysteries and crimes hang over everyone involved in the Moonstone.Greg Wise is best known for his role as cad Willoughby in ""Sense in Sensibility,"" but he shows here that he can carry a movie very well. His Franklin is a bewildered innocent of sorts, and Hodge makes a strong female counterpart, who loves Franklin but doesn't believe him. The only weak link is Sher, whose character is too self-consciously quirky.The inspector is too weird to be likable, but otherwise ""The Moonstone"" is a mystery that is still fresh after more than a century.

Based on a classic novel, beautifully produced period piece, I'm a fan of the lovely Keeley Hawes who plays the lead.This production is superb in production values and an interesting story... so why only 4 stars?  Something is a bit off, and I just can't put my finger on it.  Partially it is that the characters portayed by Keeley Hawes and Greg Wise are not particularly likable, individually and/or together - perhaps chemistry is missing, too - but I just don't really care about their relationship.  There is something about the actor playing the dectective - a precursor to Hercule Poirot - that is a bit repulsive- not in a good way.  He makes me want to turn away from the screen... is it his seedy beard?  I dunno, but ick.The pace of the production is a little too slow in connecting the dots, so despite the fact that I like it and have watched it several times, my interest always flaggs towards the end.  The most interesting and compelling performance and plot element is the maid that has unrequited love for the leading man.  Since this is a 2 hour adaptation, we probably had a lot of details cut there, and it is too bad, because she is so sympathetic and has a very interesting back story.Like other Collins' stories, it is very dark in its view of the world, the upper class, and humanity.  But that lends more interest.The production just misfired somewhere.  There's just that something is missing, and it could very well be something that was something edited out of the book or on the cutting room floor.

So who exactly has taken the Moonstone, and will it ever be restored to its rightful owner?!For those of you worried about content: the first scene in the film shows a man in bed with a woman (they are not married), they are sleeping; there is a small amount of violence; a character ends up committing suicide in the film; there are some tense moments & some lying, all in all the content is fairly minimal.If you like mysteries, check out this great hauntingly beautiful film version of Wilkie Collin's ""The Moonstone""...",4,Well done haunting Wilkie Collins mystery film!,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1298,"['always', 'well-done', 'film', 'version', 'mystery', 'classic', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'were', 'good', 'choices', 'film', 'storyline', 'entertaining', 'keeps', 'guessing', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'other', 'classics', 'entertaining', 'well-written', 'own', 'right.It', 'deals', 'precious', 'jewel', 'called', 'Moonstone', 'bequethed', 'young', 'woman', 'uncle', 'death', 'moment', 'Moonstone', 'house', 'where', 'young', 'lady', 'Rachel', 'Verinder', 'aunt', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Rachel', 'childhood', 'friend', 'now-grown', 'Franklin', 'Blake', 'one', 'delivering', 'stone', 'mysterious', 'Indians', 'seem', 'follow', 'stone', 'everywhere', 'when', 'up', 'missing', 'be', 'one', 'blame', 'Rachel', 'point', 'figure', 'who', 'exactly', 'taken', 'Moonstone', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'restored', 'rightful', 'owner', 'worried', 'content', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'man', 'bed', 'woman', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'are', 'sleeping', 'small', 'amount', 'violence', 'character', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'film', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'lying', 'content', 'fairly', 'minimal.If', 'mysteries', 'check', 'out', 'great', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'version', 'Wilkie', 'Collin', 'Moonstone']",N/A
935141,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,B000AYELC4,Reliable Reviews Too,"[5, 9]","Attractive lead actors perform an average script of a period murder-mystery.Technically good in costumes, lighting, and attractive sets. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today.  The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. The story holds your attention; therefore, maybe 3-stars for some people (I rate 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again years later).5-star Mystery DVD's are: ""Road to Avonlea-Season 3"",  episode: ""A Dark and Stormy Night"", starring Christopher Reeve; or the modern, clever, murder-mystery series ""Columbo"", Seasons 1-7 & ""Columbo Murder Mystery 1991-1993""; or ""Sherlock Holmes"" starring Basil Rathbone; or the ""Original Nancy Drew Movie Mystery Collection"" 1936, starring Bonita Granville.This did not have what I was looking for, some adventure, more believability, more charm, and more cleverness.The sets are attractively ""staged""; rather than sets that take you there.

The movie cuts a lot out but moves at a faster pace than the novel, which is overall a good move though at times I think it loses something in the editing. Not a lot of substance to it, but it's okay. If you've never read the book, it might be confusing or perhaps just more interesting because you don't know how it will end. Overall, it's a good movie but probably not one I'll watch again and again.
