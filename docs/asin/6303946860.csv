In a true-life portrayal of George  McKenna, new principal to the trouble-torn George Washington Memorial High  School, he is wholly convincing. The problems he encounters are not solely  those caused by the students, but also the parents and indeed some of the  teachers. His determination to turn things round stems from his passion  that his pupils WILL graduate to college if they want to, and that this  will never happen if they don't feel anyone cares about them. Despite  resistance from some pupils and teachers,(not to mention ongoing gang  warfare within the grounds), others rise to the occasion, both for  themselves and for McKenna himself, such is the respect he gains. In the  process of such diligence his once supportive girlfriend leaves him under  the pressure of his split commitments, but as for the School, he succeeds.  Seeing the graduating students really is a heartwarming moment! Having  previously seen &quot;187&quot;, it does make the violent scenes and  troublesome pupils here look bland by comparison, but its hard to tell if  this film was sanitised or &quot;187&quot; sensationalised. Regardless, its  still well worth the watch, especially if you respect Denzel's work in  later movies already.",4,Denzel Strikes Again!,936748800,"09 8, 1999",1999,1414,"['seriously', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'able', 'give', 'anything', 'less', 'performance', 'total', 'conviction', 'once', 'again', 'here', 'one', 'earliest', 'leading', 'roles', 'true-life', 'portrayal', 'George', 'McKenna', 'new', 'principal', 'trouble-torn', 'George', 'Washington', 'Memorial', 'High', 'School', 'wholly', 'convincing', 'problems', 'encounters', 'are', 'not', 'solely', 'caused', 'students', 'also', 'parents', 'indeed', 'teachers', 'determination', 'turn', 'things', 'round', 'passion', 'pupils', 'WILL', 'graduate', 'college', 'want', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anyone', 'cares', 'resistance', 'pupils', 'teachers', 'not', 'mention', 'ongoing', 'gang', 'warfare', 'grounds', 'others', 'rise', 'occasion', 'McKenna', 'such', 'respect', 'gains', 'process', 'such', 'diligence', 'once', 'supportive', 'girlfriend', 'pressure', 'split', 'commitments', 'School', 'Seeing', 'graduating', 'students', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'moment', 'Having', 'previously', 'seen', 'quot', '187', 'quot', 'make', 'violent', 'scenes', 'troublesome', 'pupils', 'here', 'look', 'bland', 'comparison', 'hard', 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'sanitised', 'quot', '187', 'quot', 'sensationalised', 'Regardless', 'still', 'well', 'watch', 'especially', 'respect', 'Denzel', 'work', 'later', 'movies', 'already']",George Mckenna Story VHS

Walsh,"[12, 19]","Being a teacher and Denzel Washington fan, I thought I might find some enjoyment and inspiration from a film purporting to illustrate the difficulties and solutions of the inner city high school experience. I experienced neither. Only frustration penetrated my senses as I wasted a couple of hours watching this film (after wasting ten bucks buying it)!The story line might have worked, though I doubt it, if a few obvious needs had been mandated in the production and direction, like proper casting and a believable script. Worst of these offenses was the casting, as all of the ""high school"" students were at least twenty-five, and most older. Talk about suspension of disbelief! The same cast would have worked were they cast as the parents of the students! At times Denzel looked younger than the student he was mentoring. Indeed, it was preposterous.I'm sure Mr. Washington looks upon this film as nothing more than a poor experience on the way to excellence, one of those setbacks we learn from to help us find our way.Don't waste your time or money.",1,Worst than bad,1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,1056,"['Being', 'teacher', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'fan', 'thought', 'might', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'inspiration', 'film', 'purporting', 'illustrate', 'difficulties', 'solutions', 'inner', 'city', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'experienced', 'Only', 'frustration', 'penetrated', 'senses', 'wasted', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'film', 'wasting', 'ten', 'bucks', 'buying', 'story', 'line', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'doubt', 'few', 'obvious', 'needs', 'had', 'been', 'mandated', 'production', 'direction', 'proper', 'casting', 'believable', 'script', 'Worst', 'offenses', 'was', 'casting', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'were', 'least', 'twenty-five', 'most', 'older', 'Talk', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'same', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'were', 'cast', 'parents', 'students', 'times', 'Denzel', 'looked', 'younger', 'student', 'was', 'mentoring', 'Indeed', 'was', 'preposterous.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'poor', 'experience', 'way', 'excellence', 'one', 'setbacks', 'learn', 'help', 'find', 'way.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money']",George Mckenna Story VHS
