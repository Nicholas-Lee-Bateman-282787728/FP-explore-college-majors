1411745,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B004K4FU9S,Elyse Wheeler,"[0, 0]","I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Your Love Never Fails was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking of alcohol; mild cleavage and tension/arguing between a husband and wife.  It is rated G and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and then bought the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.  I wouldn't say it is my favorite, mostly because of the wife.  She is kind of selfish.  She first left her husband and father in Texas and moved to New York with her daughter, because she wanted a better life/job and he wouldn't go with them because he wanted to stay on his family's ranch.  (You would think that she wouldn't have married him if she didn't want to run the ranch/stables with him).  She is then angry that after many years he files for joint custody of their daughter.  (Even though it was her that just &#34;never got around&#34; to getting the divorce).  She then still upset with her husband throughout almost the entire show that he just can't see that he should completely relinquish custody.  (Even though she is finding that she still loves him).in spite of all of this, you do get past it (and so does she) and when she finds that he is about to lose everything, she realizes that he needs his daughter as much as she and his daughter need him.  The final odd thing was that she didn't end up staying in Texas even though she found that she was enjoying the simple life she left, but rather he moved to New York with her.  Oh well...as I said I am grateful for when I can find a clean movie and the story and characters were enjoyable.  It deals with family values, making difficult decisions, forgiveness, and includes a fine though brief sermon from the local pastor, Pastor Frank, played nicely by John Schneider. The pastor makes a nice comment which is, &#34;The goal of God's command is love.&#34;Overall, I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again.",4,Your Love Never Fails - Will Watch Again,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2257,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Love', 'Never', 'Fails', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'was', 'few', 'utterances', 'mild', 'crude', 'language', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'mild', 'cleavage', 'tension/arguing', 'husband', 'wife', 'rated', 'G', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'approved', 'ages.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'favorite', 'mostly', 'wife', 'kind', 'selfish', 'first', 'left', 'husband', 'father', 'Texas', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'better', 'life/job', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'wanted', 'stay', 'family', 'ranch', 'would', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'married', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'run', 'ranch/stables', 'then', 'angry', 'many', 'years', 'joint', 'custody', 'daughter', 'Even', 'was', 'just', '34', 'never', 'got', '34', 'getting', 'divorce', 'then', 'still', 'upset', 'husband', 'almost', 'entire', 'show', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'should', 'completely', 'relinquish', 'custody', 'Even', 'finding', 'still', 'spite', 'do', 'get', 'so', 'when', 'lose', 'everything', 'daughter', 'as', 'much', 'daughter', 'need', 'final', 'odd', 'thing', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'staying', 'Texas', 'even', 'found', 'was', 'enjoying', 'simple', 'life', 'left', 'rather', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'Oh', 'well', 'said', 'am', 'grateful', 'when', 'can', 'find', 'clean', 'movie', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'values', 'making', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'forgiveness', 'fine', 'brief', 'sermon', 'local', 'pastor', 'Pastor', 'Frank', 'played', 'nicely', 'John', 'Schneider', 'pastor', 'nice', 'comment', '34', 'goal', 'God', 'command', 'love.', '34', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",Your Love Never Fails

She just lights up the screen, and she is very believable with each of her characters.  She has exceptional comic timing, which makes her a good choice for a light-hearted romantic comedy.  In this movie, Elisa is a single mother who chose to leave her unsupportive husband many years ago to take on a career in the city, and just became too busy to get around to filing for that little thing called a divorce.  When the husband files for joint custody of their daughter, Elisa must take time off from work (something she rarely does) to move back to her little country town while she takes care of this mess.  But as she starts spending more time with her daughter, and less time at work, she starts to realize what's really important.  She also begins to see her husband in a brand new light, and realizes he's not the same man he use to be, because he also knows what's important in life, and isn't afraid to fight for it.

1411755,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B004K4FU9S,mk,"[24, 24]","Family friendly, beautiful setting, with some Christian values on display, tried and true veteran support actors make for an overall good, clean show.The story: long separated parents come together in Texas to fight for custody of daughter.  Business driven Mom lives in the big city with daughter; Dad remained in the simpler, gorgeous, horse country of  Texas.  The judge(Catherine Hicks) wants them to all spend time together while awaiting the final determination.  Mom and daughter stay at easy going, wise grandpa's (Tom Skerritt) place, visit with gentle, counselor/pastor(John Schneider), and interact with varying results with the dad(Brad Rowe) who still pines for his family.There's mild and sometimes amusing tension between the parents and the dad's potential love interest.  Most everyone wants them to get back together, but will the two blind, ex-lovebirds realize it for themselves?When I first watched this film: the 2 fighting leads really annoyed me. I felt better about them, watching it again.  The writing was a bit forced, and they came across selfish, petulant, overplayed or smarmy.  I didn't find their interaction that humorous. Perhaps, it was meant to be that way, and then as they mature around each other and see the bigger picture, they become more likeable.The tried and true veterans, who have important but much smaller roles, like, Fred Willard, as the mom's boss- who pretty much acts in the whole movie via the phone- along with Skerritt and Schneider are quite easy to watch.  Their acting comes across so natural and real.  I would say the same for the actor playing the daughter- who does a terrific job conveying all the emotions involved in a broken family.Overall, a pleasant film if not totally stirring or new. I think it's meant to be more comedic and love felt than dramatic.

1411765,ADGLADSOHAQMJ,B004K4FU9S,The Book Runner,"[11, 18]","Did not like this movie!  Apparently, Laura and Dylan were married with a small daughter, Kelsey, when she decided she wanted to move to New York for her career.  Dylan did not want to leave Texas, so he let Laura go with his daughter thinking she would fail and come back to him.  Six years later, Laura is a successful bank VIP and Dylan is financially struggling.  Since Laura has not signed the divorce papers in the six years she and her daughter have been in New York, Dylan files for custody of their daughter in order to have more time with her.  Laura and Kesley have to go to Texas to stand before a judge to oppose Dylan's custody battle.  While there, Laura and Dylan start to see how important family is and rekindle the spark that was once their marriage.Why I gagged on this movie: 1) the acting was awful.  The dialogue seemed ad-libbed and way too sweet.  It was cringed-worthy. 2) Dylan was not manly enough.  Seriously, what did she see in him? In fact, Laura seemed to have all the men in her life whipped.  The pastor (John Schneider, who really needed a hair cut for this movie) seemed to be the only one able to handle her. 3) The clincher - SPOILER***** It appears that Dylan was fighting for custody of Kelsey because he knew that it would bring his wife back into town.  Then, he purposely tries to make Laura jealous by inviting her biggest rival over while they have a family dinner.  Dylan wants her back and is NOW willing to move to New York because he is bankrupt????!!  Come on!  I just really could not see the redeeming value of this movie or the love story.  I really just hated it.Would I/Did I buy it? NoWould I watch it again? NoWould I recommend it to friends?
