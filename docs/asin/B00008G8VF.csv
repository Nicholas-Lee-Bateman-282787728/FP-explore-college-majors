742080,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,B00008G8VF,Dumb Ox,"[19, 20]","During the early seventies, groups formed out of members of other rock bands that explored avenues of music that combined rock and classical elements.  This was progressive rock, best represented by bands such as Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Triumvirat and this trio of Englishmen who go by their last names.  Keith Emerson (The Nice), Greg Lake (King Crimson) and Carl Palmer (The Crazy World of Arthur Brown) were lean and hungry in their early years, willing to go off the deep end in their passion for music.  This DVD of an old Belgian TV show is a prime example of the group's early work.  It is fresh and powerful, without the trappings that later accompanied ELP's success.  Brief interviews with the trio show that they had a sense of humor about themselves but not their music:  Carl Palmer freely admits he's never held a job apart from drumming and Greg Lake says he'd probably kill himself if he was unable to be a musician.  Their performances are powerful and riveting, from Emerson stabbing his synthesizer and riding it like a bucking bronco, to Lake pouring out emotions in his amazing voice, and to Palmer playing so hard that he has to strip off his sweat-soaked shirt.  The trio come across like brothers, emotionally interacting onstage and off.  The songs are Barbarian, Rondo/Bach Improvisation, Drum Solo, Nut Rocker, Take A Pebble and Knife Edge.  Each is performed with a rare blend of power and polish that is enjoyable to watch.  Though only about an hour long, the show is a valuable glimpse into a musical genre that unfortunately peaked in the late 70s and faded.  There is little in the current music scene to compare with groups like ELP and their ilk.  Purchasing this DVD has only whetted our appetite for more, so we will be on the search for similar material.  We enjoyed this show and recommend it to anyone who enjoys excellent music, whether ELP fans or not.",5,Progressive Rock's Finest Hour,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1897,"['early', 'seventies', 'groups', 'formed', 'members', 'other', 'rock', 'bands', 'explored', 'avenues', 'music', 'combined', 'rock', 'classical', 'elements', 'was', 'progressive', 'rock', 'best', 'represented', 'bands', 'such', 'Yes', 'Genesis', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Triumvirat', 'trio', 'Englishmen', 'who', 'go', 'last', 'names', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'Nice', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'King', 'Crimson', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'Crazy', 'World', 'Arthur', 'Brown', 'were', 'lean', 'hungry', 'early', 'years', 'willing', 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'passion', 'music', 'DVD', 'old', 'Belgian', 'TV', 'show', 'prime', 'example', 'group', 'early', 'work', 'fresh', 'powerful', 'trappings', 'later', 'accompanied', 'ELP', 'success', 'Brief', 'interviews', 'trio', 'show', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'music', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'freely', 'never', 'held', 'job', 'apart', 'drumming', 'Greg', 'Lake', ""'d"", 'probably', 'kill', 'was', 'unable', 'be', 'musician', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'riveting', 'Emerson', 'stabbing', 'synthesizer', 'riding', 'bucking', 'bronco', 'Lake', 'pouring', 'out', 'emotions', 'amazing', 'voice', 'Palmer', 'playing', 'so', 'hard', 'strip', 'off', 'sweat-soaked', 'shirt', 'trio', 'come', 'brothers', 'emotionally', 'interacting', 'onstage', 'off', 'songs', 'are', 'Barbarian', 'Rondo/Bach', 'Improvisation', 'Drum', 'Solo', 'Nut', 'Rocker', 'Take', 'Pebble', 'Knife', 'Edge', 'performed', 'rare', 'blend', 'power', 'polish', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'valuable', 'glimpse', 'musical', 'genre', 'unfortunately', 'peaked', 'late', '70s', 'faded', 'little', 'current', 'music', 'scene', 'compare', 'groups', 'ELP', 'ilk', 'Purchasing', 'DVD', 'only', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'search', 'similar', 'material', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'excellent', 'music', 'ELP', 'fans', 'not']",Masters from the Vaults: Family
742081,A1S7BFT0HDF3HA,B00008G8VF,"loce_the_wizard ""loce_the_wizard""","[2, 2]","Let's go with the good news first, and let me state up front that my criticisms---the bad news---are not directed at Family but at ""Masters From the Vaults: Family (1971).""This lively set captures the band after the departure of original members Rick Grech and Jim King with short-timer Jim Weider brought on board to replace Grech (both played bass and violin) and Poli Palmer, who had the longest tenure of any member besides Townsend, Chapman, and Whitney, to round out the sound with flute, keyboards, vibes, and odd percussion.Part of the Load is my favorite track here, and apparently it and Weaver's Answer were recorded during the same session (not that they follow one another on the DVD). The montage of images in Part of the Load, which was filmed in a British military museum, is wildly disturbing and fun. The opening cut, Strange Band, shows the band in great form and while they may not have been masters of fashion, Family comes across as a muscular, rocking band. Apparently the camera operators filming Good News, Bad News were so enthralled with Chapman's performance, which was dubbed ""idiot dancing"" back then---and it is a sight to behold---that they forget to include the rest of the band. A more mellow side of the band surfaces in Procession/ No Mules Fool, revealing the folk elements that helped Family gain such a following in rural England back in the `70s.It's a revelation to actually see Family perform and this is treasured footage to be sure. I wish there were more shots of Charlie Whitney searing the strings off that wild-looking 12-string and Rob Townsend making a case as to why he is perhaps the best overlooked rock drummer of his time.Now for some of the bad news: Unfortunately, Weaver's Answer and Holding the Compass are both truncated (why and by whom, I wonder?) versions of these classics, and it's hard to get past the fact that somewhere, someone eviscerated these two fine performances. For instance, not one note of Whitney's awesome guitar solo makes it into the video, which is a criminal offense in my book. Dim, listed on the track list as the final cut, is not a video at all but rather just playing in the background during the credits! The quality of the video is uneven at best, and certainly more could have been done to improve it.Given that only about 30 minutes of footage from Family graces this DVD, the production outfit loaded it up with bonus footage from DVDs from various other dinosaur bands in its catalog. (After watching some of this mostly awful stuff, I'm actually glad that there has not been a Family reunion.) There is other video footage of Family available as anyone who has checked out some of the more thorough Web sites knows---could some of this material not have been added as well?Why are there no interviews with the surviving members of Family? Certainly, Whitney, Chapman, Townsend, Palmer, Weider, King, and Wetton (RIP Grech and Ashton) would have been able to provide some excellent commentary and insights. I'd have paid a king's ransom for that sort of bounty.Being able to watch Chapman impale a tambourine on a microphone stand over and over does help sooth my troubled soul. So, all in all, the band gets five stars for their performance but the overall DVD gets zero stars.",2,"Family gets 5 stars, the DVD gets zero",1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,3273,"['Let', 'go', 'good', 'news', 'first', 'let', 'state', 'up', 'front', 'criticisms', '-the', 'bad', 'news', '-are', 'not', 'directed', 'Family', 'Masters', 'Vaults', 'Family', '1971', 'lively', 'set', 'band', 'departure', 'original', 'members', 'Rick', 'Grech', 'Jim', 'King', 'short-timer', 'Jim', 'Weider', 'brought', 'board', 'replace', 'Grech', 'played', 'bass', 'violin', 'Poli', 'Palmer', 'who', 'had', 'longest', 'tenure', 'member', 'Townsend', 'Chapman', 'Whitney', 'round', 'out', 'sound', 'flute', 'keyboards', 'vibes', 'odd', 'percussion.Part', 'Load', 'favorite', 'track', 'here', 'apparently', 'Weaver', 'Answer', 'were', 'recorded', 'same', 'session', 'not', 'follow', 'one', 'DVD', 'montage', 'images', 'Part', 'Load', 'was', 'filmed', 'British', 'military', 'museum', 'wildly', 'disturbing', 'fun', 'opening', 'cut', 'Strange', 'Band', 'band', 'great', 'form', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'masters', 'fashion', 'Family', 'across', 'muscular', 'rocking', 'band', 'Apparently', 'camera', 'operators', 'filming', 'Good', 'News', 'Bad', 'News', 'were', 'so', 'enthralled', 'Chapman', 'performance', 'was', 'dubbed', 'idiot', 'dancing', 'back', 'then', '-and', 'sight', 'behold', 'forget', 'include', 'rest', 'band', 'more', 'mellow', 'side', 'band', 'surfaces', 'Procession/', 'No', 'Mules', 'Fool', 'revealing', 'folk', 'elements', 'helped', 'Family', 'gain', 'such', 'following', 'rural', 'England', 'back', '70s.It', 'revelation', 'actually', 'see', 'Family', 'perform', 'treasured', 'footage', 'be', 'sure', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'shots', 'Charlie', 'Whitney', 'searing', 'strings', 'off', 'wild-looking', '12-string', 'Rob', 'Townsend', 'making', 'case', 'why', 'perhaps', 'best', 'overlooked', 'rock', 'drummer', 'time.Now', 'bad', 'news', 'Unfortunately', 'Weaver', 'Answer', 'Holding', 'Compass', 'are', 'truncated', 'why', 'whom', 'wonder', 'versions', 'classics', 'hard', 'get', 'fact', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'eviscerated', 'two', 'fine', 'performances', 'instance', 'not', 'one', 'note', 'Whitney', 'awesome', 'guitar', 'solo', 'video', 'criminal', 'offense', 'book', 'Dim', 'listed', 'track', 'list', 'final', 'cut', 'not', 'video', 'rather', 'just', 'playing', 'background', 'credits', 'quality', 'video', 'uneven', 'best', 'certainly', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'improve', 'it.Given', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'footage', 'Family', 'graces', 'DVD', 'production', 'outfit', 'loaded', 'up', 'bonus', 'footage', 'DVDs', 'various', 'other', 'dinosaur', 'bands', 'catalog', 'watching', 'mostly', 'awful', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'actually', 'glad', 'not', 'been', 'Family', 'reunion', 'other', 'video', 'footage', 'Family', 'available', 'anyone', 'who', 'checked', 'out', 'more', 'thorough', 'Web', 'knows', '-could', 'material', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'well', 'Why', 'are', 'there', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'members', 'Family', 'Certainly', 'Whitney', 'Chapman', 'Townsend', 'Palmer', 'Weider', 'King', 'Wetton', 'RIP', 'Grech', 'Ashton', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'provide', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'insights', ""'d"", 'have', 'paid', 'king', 'ransom', 'sort', 'bounty.Being', 'able', 'watch', 'Chapman', 'impale', 'tambourine', 'microphone', 'stand', 'over', 'help', 'sooth', 'troubled', 'soul', 'So', 'band', 'five', 'stars', 'performance', 'overall', 'DVD', 'zero', 'stars']",Masters from the Vaults: Family
742082,A2N0X5UF78XJ9Z,B00008G8VF,"M. A Maupin ""mikmaupin""","[65, 68]","Emerson Lake Palmer's first album was always my favorite and this video was shot around the time of that first release.  With a young Emerson Lake & Palmer in top form performing three songs from that first album, this is now my favorite DVD from ELP.It appears to be transferred from film (although the aspect ratio is still 4:3).  The digitally re-mastered DD 5.1 sound is really very good.  That is, as long as you are not comparing it to DVDs recorded with modern technology standards.  But I'd rather see an outstanding performance of a young ELP with very good sound than a recent lackluster performance with great sound.There are some ""special effects"" that are annoying (typical of concert footage from that era), but they are not nearly as annoying as the effects in the Pictures at an Exhibition DVD.I've included the track list and liner notes from the DVD.Track list:Barbarian (Emerson, Lake, Palmer, Bartok)Rondo / Bach ImprovisationsDrum SoloNut RockerTake A Pebble (Lake)Knife Edge (Emerson, Lake, Frasier, Janacek)Liner Notes from the DVD:The first true super group of the seventies Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were a world wide phenomenon and rose to prominence as one of the highest grossing acts in the history of rock.The band was assembled by brining together three young musical geniuses in the form of keyboard wizard Keith Emerson from the Nice along with bassist/vocalist Greg Lake from King Crimson and the legendary Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster on drums.This was an outstanding collection of musicians and the band almost instantly shot to worldwide fame on the back of their spectacular first album.It is that first album which is featured here with ELP jamming and improvising around the core structure of the extended pieces.  This is a young Emerson Lake and Palmer captured at the very beginning of a legendary career.As these pieces were filmed at the time when the band had only just recorded their ground breaking first album ELP had not yet built a large repertoire and therefore had to use all of their huge individual creative talents to create a full show.  That's what makes this film so special.Keith Emerson gives a dazzling display of extensive improvisation including all of the stage tricks, which would make ELP famous and triumphant.  In this film the keyboard maestro demonstrates his full range of stunts including playing the organ upside down.  Despite the showmanship the music remains rock steady as Emerson flies through a series of breathtaking improvisations based around JS Back's ""Well Tempered Clavier"".You'll also find inventive percussions from Carl Palmer including a breathtaking solo spot which amply demonstrates why Palmer would go on to become the most famous rock drummer of all time.The film is capped by a bravura performance at the mike and both on bass and acoustic guitars by the young Greg Lake.Taken together these mind blowing individual performances add up to the magic of Emerson Lake and Palmer and make this an essential addition to the collection of any fan of the progressive rock era.",5,A great concert fron a young ELP on the verge of success!,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3068,"['Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'first', 'album', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'video', 'was', 'shot', 'time', 'first', 'release', 'young', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'top', 'form', 'performing', 'three', 'songs', 'first', 'album', 'now', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'ELP.It', 'be', 'transferred', 'film', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'still', '4:3', 'digitally', 're-mastered', 'DD', '5.1', 'sound', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'not', 'comparing', 'DVDs', 'recorded', 'modern', 'technology', 'standards', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'young', 'ELP', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'recent', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'great', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'annoying', 'typical', 'concert', 'footage', 'era', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'annoying', 'effects', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', 'DVD.I', ""'ve"", 'included', 'track', 'list', 'liner', 'notes', 'DVD.Track', 'list', 'Barbarian', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'Bartok', 'Rondo', '/', 'Bach', 'ImprovisationsDrum', 'SoloNut', 'RockerTake', 'A', 'Pebble', 'Lake', 'Knife', 'Edge', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Frasier', 'Janacek', 'Liner', 'Notes', 'DVD', 'first', 'true', 'super', 'group', 'seventies', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'were', 'world', 'wide', 'phenomenon', 'rose', 'prominence', 'one', 'highest', 'grossing', 'acts', 'history', 'rock.The', 'band', 'was', 'assembled', 'brining', 'together', 'three', 'young', 'musical', 'geniuses', 'form', 'keyboard', 'wizard', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'Nice', 'bassist/vocalist', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'King', 'Crimson', 'legendary', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'Atomic', 'Rooster', 'drums.This', 'was', 'outstanding', 'collection', 'musicians', 'band', 'almost', 'instantly', 'shot', 'worldwide', 'fame', 'back', 'spectacular', 'first', 'album.It', 'first', 'album', 'featured', 'here', 'ELP', 'jamming', 'improvising', 'core', 'structure', 'extended', 'pieces', 'young', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'captured', 'very', 'beginning', 'legendary', 'career.As', 'pieces', 'were', 'filmed', 'time', 'when', 'band', 'had', 'only', 'just', 'recorded', 'ground', 'breaking', 'first', 'album', 'ELP', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'built', 'large', 'repertoire', 'therefore', 'had', 'use', 'huge', 'individual', 'creative', 'talents', 'create', 'full', 'show', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'special.Keith', 'Emerson', 'dazzling', 'display', 'extensive', 'improvisation', 'including', 'stage', 'tricks', 'would', 'make', 'ELP', 'famous', 'triumphant', 'film', 'keyboard', 'maestro', 'full', 'range', 'stunts', 'including', 'playing', 'organ', 'upside', 'down', 'showmanship', 'music', 'rock', 'steady', 'Emerson', 'series', 'breathtaking', 'improvisations', 'based', 'JS', 'Back', 'Well', 'Tempered', 'Clavier', '.You', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'inventive', 'percussions', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'including', 'breathtaking', 'solo', 'spot', 'amply', 'why', 'Palmer', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'most', 'famous', 'rock', 'drummer', 'time.The', 'film', 'capped', 'bravura', 'performance', 'mike', 'bass', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'young', 'Greg', 'Lake.Taken', 'together', 'mind', 'blowing', 'individual', 'performances', 'add', 'up', 'magic', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'make', 'essential', 'addition', 'collection', 'fan', 'progressive', 'rock', 'era']",Masters from the Vaults: Family

Here's the deal- there is a whole lot of footage that was done back in the 'acid-days', when the film makers were tripping, and figured everyone watching was gonna be tripping, too. It's NOT the subjects that is that's the problem (it's the messenger). The producers of the DVD don't even have it together enough to spell-check the cover-art for the DVD case... they keep referencing 'Mike'... what they mean is 'mic', as in microphone. (dufus) Well... in this case, it IS a pretty good clue as to what to expect.Save your money. Instead, DO buy ELP ""Beyond the Beginning"". It has many of the same cuts, concerts, etc., but not nearly as many of the ones that would make you cringe as an ELP fan. Plus, 'BTB' has stuff like The California Jam, complete with the 'flying piano' footage. That particular concert is special for me because exactly one week to the day before, I saw ELP in Memphis, where I sat '4th row center'. Actually, the Memphis show was better than the C-Jam... (I have it on cassette).Back to this DVD.... I am a modular synth player, and was quite disappointed that because of the stupid 'acid-crazed' hokey production... you can't really even see any good close-ups of the equipment.

The other performances here are of the same level of quality and the drum solo played by Carl Palmer here is one of the most different ones I have ever seen and listened in my life, his ability and rhythm control capacity are only equalled by Neil Peart from Rush.
