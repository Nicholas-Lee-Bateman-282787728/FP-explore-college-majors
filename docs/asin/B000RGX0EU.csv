While The Devils Rejects has the true mark of Rob Zombie stamped throughout...the lack of Karen Black's revival of the Mama role, in this sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, is sorely missed.  Is there gratuitous violence...why yes, yes there is...but of course this is the hallmark of this series and a must to illustrate the degenrative level of sociopathic behavior imbred within this family.  The line between right and wrong blurs further regarding those who represent hero/saviour figures (law enforcement) who demonstrate a raw barbarism of their own when dealing with the clan.The 3rd disc, 30 Days in Hell, is a documentary type autobiographical journal of the filming of The Devils Rejects, which allows you a peek into the mind of Rob Zombie, also his methodology and at times reasoning behind shooting scenes as he does.  This documentary features interviews with Zombie, cast and crew, make - up and wardrobe information, as well as screen tests for those who fill the roles of other than lead(s).I have rated this collection 4 of 5 stars only because I feel the 3rd disc, while interesting, served no purpose...actually it went out of its way to explain what should have been left to the viewers imagination.",4,Rob Zombie 3 - Disc Collector's Set,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1391,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'devotees', 'will', 'delight', '3', 'disc', 'collection', 'Capt', 'Spaulding', 'etal', 'clan', 'socially', 'rebellious', 'arguably', 'mentally', 'defective', 'outcasts', 'Devils', 'Rejects', 'true', 'mark', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'stamped', 'lack', 'Karen', 'Black', 'revival', 'Mama', 'role', 'sequel', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'sorely', 'missed', 'there', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'why', 'yes', 'yes', 'course', 'hallmark', 'series', 'must', 'illustrate', 'degenrative', 'level', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'imbred', 'family', 'line', 'right', 'wrong', 'blurs', 'further', 'regarding', 'who', 'represent', 'hero/saviour', 'figures', 'law', 'enforcement', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'raw', 'barbarism', 'own', 'when', 'dealing', 'clan.The', '3rd', 'disc', '30', 'Days', 'Hell', 'documentary', 'type', 'autobiographical', 'journal', 'filming', 'Devils', 'Rejects', 'peek', 'mind', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'also', 'methodology', 'times', 'reasoning', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'features', 'interviews', 'Zombie', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'up', 'wardrobe', 'information', 'as', 'well', 'screen', 'tests', 'who', 'fill', 'roles', 'other', 'lead', 's', 'have', 'rated', 'collection', '4', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'feel', '3rd', 'disc', 'interesting', 'served', 'purpose', 'actually', 'went', 'way', 'explain', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'viewers', 'imagination']",Rob Zombie Collector's Set: House of 1000 Corpses / The Devil's Rejects / 30 Days in Hell: The Making of The Devil's Rejects
1081622,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000RGX0EU,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 2]","This DVD set includes what are perhaps Rob Zombie's 2 most popular projects:  THE HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.  The third disc is a ""making of"" documentary which I was disinterested in watching.REJECTS is the sequel to CORPSES.  Bucking the traditional trend, I found REJECTS to be the far superior flick.  Of course, ""superior"" is a relative term here as both movies are pretty warped.The films center around a dysfunctional, twisted family of murderers.  It would seem to me that Rob had inspiration from the Manson family murders of 1969 as his ""model"" for his group of sadists.  There are some obvious differences;  the Manson ""family"" was  a family in name only as it was a commune / cult.  Rob's goobers, meanwhile, are an actual family.  Also, the Mansons had a misguided political agenda, whereas Rob's goobers just like to torture & kill people - period.The most haunting character is portrayed by Sherri Moon Zombie.  Just like the lovely young women ""recruited"" by Charles Manson, she is gorgeous and seems in some clips like an all-American girl-next-door.  That's precisely what is so terrifying about her persona;  she can seem to be normal (and perhaps flighty) but is nonetheless the embodiment of pure evil.Ironically enough, the ultimate didactic utility of Rob Zombie movies is to teach us all to show kindness to each other.  After seeing the hideous mindset & acrimonious hatred of the characters in his movies, we relish simple courtesies from other people all the more.",5,Mesmerized like a zombie!,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1511,"['DVD', 'set', 'what', 'are', 'perhaps', 'Rob', 'Zombie', '2', 'most', 'popular', 'projects', 'HOUSE', '1,000', 'CORPSES', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'REJECTS', 'third', 'disc', 'making', 'documentary', 'was', 'disinterested', 'watching.REJECTS', 'sequel', 'CORPSES', 'Bucking', 'traditional', 'trend', 'found', 'REJECTS', 'be', 'far', 'superior', 'flick', 'course', 'superior', 'relative', 'term', 'here', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'warped.The', 'films', 'center', 'dysfunctional', 'twisted', 'family', 'murderers', 'would', 'seem', 'Rob', 'had', 'inspiration', 'Manson', 'family', 'murders', '1969', 'model', 'group', 'sadists', 'are', 'obvious', 'differences', 'Manson', 'family', 'was', 'family', 'name', 'only', 'was', 'commune', '/', 'cult', 'Rob', 'goobers', 'meanwhile', 'are', 'actual', 'family', 'Also', 'Mansons', 'had', 'misguided', 'political', 'agenda', 'Rob', 'goobers', 'just', 'torture', 'kill', 'people', 'period.The', 'most', 'haunting', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'Just', 'lovely', 'young', 'women', 'recruited', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'gorgeous', 'clips', 'all-American', 'girl-next-door', 'precisely', 'what', 'so', 'terrifying', 'persona', 'can', 'seem', 'be', 'normal', 'perhaps', 'flighty', 'nonetheless', 'embodiment', 'pure', 'evil.Ironically', 'enough', 'ultimate', 'didactic', 'utility', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'teach', 'show', 'kindness', 'other', 'seeing', 'hideous', 'mindset', 'acrimonious', 'hatred', 'characters', 'movies', 'relish', 'simple', 'courtesies', 'other', 'people', 'more']",Rob Zombie Collector's Set: House of 1000 Corpses / The Devil's Rejects / 30 Days in Hell: The Making of The Devil's Rejects

1081626,A1SHIUVOIHSZJO,B000RGX0EU,"Jason A. Kentros ""SharkByte""","[17, 24]","Nothing new here: this set features Rob Zombie's first two films exactly as they were released originally, with a new cover to persuade buyers.If you have not seen these two films, or just haven't gotten around to buying them; this is the perfect set for you.  The Devil's Rejects follows the Firefly family from House of 1,000 Corpses as they are hunted down by the brother of slain sheriff Wydell.House of 1,000 Corpses has a small gathering of fun special features, while The Devil's Rejects boasts a large selection of extras, along with ""30 Days In Hell"" which follows the making of the film from pre-production to read-through, and beyond.  You'll feel like you were on set.My first instinct upon seeing this new set was disappointment in Rob Zombie, who has always gone against the commercial grain.  However, I have the feeling that Lions Gate may have been more responsible for this than Mr Zombie himself so I can give him the benefit of the doubt.  Just as record labels push ""best-of"" cd's, production companies want their share as well.Once you get past the commercialism of a repackaged version of what the fans already have at home, these are two very important horror films and I don't think any filmmaker can match movies like these as a starting point for their career.

I love how he puts incredible detail into it, like the scary props at Captain Spaulding's and all the HALLOWEEN decorations were awesome. Four college students named Bill, Jerry, Mary, and Denise are traveling throughout America looking at different road-side attractions, until they come to Captain Spaulding's who tells them about Dr. Satan. They become interested and run into the sadistic Firefly family, who act friendly at first, but turn to psychopaths. On HALLOWEEN, they torture them by using a razor on Bill's face, cut through Jerry's scalp, dress Denise up like a little girl, Mary's dad gets shot and his face torn off, etc. (It would be sad if this happened in real life.) Later, Denise must survive Dr. Satan's underground chamber. The climax was a little silly, but it's horror film. If you love HALLOWEEN, Zombie's movies and his style, you'll love HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES!!!The Devil's Rejects- When I very first saw this in 2005 at the theatre, I hated it! I thought it was a piece of crap, I had not seen the original and didn't know it was going to make us side with the bad guys. In summer of 2007, I decided to give this a 2nd chance because Rob Zombie was directing a remake to my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I like better now than when I first saw it. It starts with Sheriff John Quincy Wydell and his troopers begin a full-scale attack against the Firefly family. Only Otis and Baby make it out. Mother Firefly is caught. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding plan to meet at the Kahiki Palms Hotel. They torture and kill the members of Banjo & Sullivan, then they seek refuge at brothel owned by Captain Spaulding's brother, Charlie Altamont. Wydell turns into a vigilante and hires bounty hunters to find the Fireflys. Wydell threatens Charlie into giving up the Fireflys. Wydell then takes them back to their house and tortures them.
