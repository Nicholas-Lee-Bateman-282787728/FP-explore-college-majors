1272165,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002JTMO0E,Amazon Customer,"[12, 13]","Interesting foreign language film (subtitles) based on a late 1500s storyline of a joint Finnish/Russian expedition working to define the border between their two countries.  As they walk the actual disputed line, they commit a few unchoice acts that come back to haunt them, and also discover a village that is not on any map.  Eerie things follow (trying to avoid giving a spoiler).Overall, this was generally enjoyable.  The mood maintains a dreary and eerie feeling throughout, but perhaps too much.  It almost never lets up, as strange acts continue and the actors engage in several savage acts.  This could be a negative; the story unendingly plods through dark territory with interspersed horror moments that more abruptly arise rather than be built up.  Also, its kinda slow.  The story unfolds somewhat discontinuously (which, at times, is very well done), but generally it moves from one slowly developed scene to another, all of which are more notable for the human-human brutality (which is more often implied than actually shown) than the paranormal horror.",3,"Good creepy atmosphere, but slow",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,1070,"['Interesting', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'subtitles', 'based', 'late', '1500s', 'storyline', 'joint', 'Finnish/Russian', 'expedition', 'working', 'define', 'border', 'two', 'countries', 'walk', 'actual', 'disputed', 'line', 'commit', 'few', 'unchoice', 'acts', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'also', 'discover', 'village', 'not', 'map', 'Eerie', 'things', 'follow', 'trying', 'avoid', 'giving', 'spoiler', '.Overall', 'was', 'generally', 'enjoyable', 'mood', 'dreary', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'never', 'up', 'strange', 'acts', 'continue', 'actors', 'engage', 'several', 'savage', 'acts', 'could', 'be', 'negative', 'story', 'unendingly', 'plods', 'dark', 'territory', 'interspersed', 'horror', 'moments', 'more', 'abruptly', 'arise', 'rather', 'be', 'built', 'up', 'Also', 'kinda', 'slow', 'story', 'somewhat', 'discontinuously', 'times', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'generally', 'one', 'slowly', 'developed', 'scene', 'are', 'more', 'notable', 'human-human', 'brutality', 'more', 'often', 'implied', 'actually', 'shown', 'paranormal', 'horror']",N/A
1272166,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B002JTMO0E,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching this movie. And I must say that it is a very good horror movie. Now for many horror fans this might not be what they expect, there is no cheap scares, I did not jump once. There is hardly any gore and the plot moves very slowly. Now this is both a good thing and a bad thing. In a way the plot of the movie would not work if it moved faster, but there is a thin line between artistic buildup and boredom and at times this movie crosses that line. But overall the peacing is great. Visually this film is a feast for the eyes. It is set in a very gritty, war torn land and it has this great, dark dreary atmosphere.The characters in this movies is wonderful. Without spoiling to much I will say that the plot is about two Swedish brothers who after a long and bloody war between Sweden and Russia is over is set together with a Russian party to draw up new borders for the two nations. Both brothers are troubled by what they have seen and done in the war. Eerik the older brother had killed 73 pepole and Knut the younger brother have locked a young girl in a cellar and left her there. The brothers begin to see ghostly apparitions of the pepole they have hurt. The film is about sin and forgiveness, but not really in the classic Christian sense. The story is gripping, unfortunately I feel that the ending was to abrupt and leaves to many questions unanswered. I do not feel like I have watched a complete story, and that cost the movie the fifth star. The ending was weak compared to the rest of the film which is excellent.I should also mention that while this is not a creature feature, and it is not heavy on special effects. The film do have the most creepy monsters I have seen on film since Silent Hill. It is really rare for the designers of a film to really manage to make something creepy, but the faceless sauna demons (Or whatever they are, this is never explained.) are really excellent. Many movies have gross,impressive, cool, creative, shocking monsters but few manages to make some which are really creepy. For those few scenes alone which features the faceless sauna demons you should get this movies. Those monsters alone is worth the price of the film for any horror fan.If you are in the mood for a different, moody and rather artistic horror movie which takes it's time getting there but who have beautiful visuals and great characters along the way, then I can definitely recommend this film. It's ending is flawed but it is still a top notch film.",4,Faceless sauna demons for the win!

1272167,A518CRYX4QKAH,B002JTMO0E,Bookworm936,"[0, 1]","The movie could have been so much better with a little more information.  A group discovers a town in the middle of a swamp near a sauna.  The town has no children, except one.  The head of the town states the town has 70+ people; yet only a handfull is shown.  When the group tries to question the people about the town they don't remember much.  I suppose the ""mystery"" or ""unknown"" factor is suppose to be eerie or something to that effect.  Also, the film doesn't show or explain what happened to the guy who dug his eyes out and ate his tongue.  It never tells us what happens.  It doesn't show it either (not alot of gore to be seen).  And no, I don't watch a movie for gore but if I am not going to get any information about the story I might as well be shown something to look at.  Erik calls people who worship certain religions ""traitors""; yet, his beef against religion is not explained.  Knut locks a girl in the celler to protect her yet he fancies her (according to Erik).  So just who was Knut protecting her from?  Ericks physical brutality or his lust for her.The who movie is about Erik atoning for the 75 people he has killed.  His brother seems to be possessed or gone a little batty..whichever way...the ending could have been a bit more cohesive.  And I guess to make this a ""horror"" type movie they threw in some white ghosts with black features (much like the ones seen numberous movies before this one) who move in jerky motions.The setting was nice and desolate.  The colors were muted and subdued.  The acting was well done.  I could have done without the shot of Erik's willie in the bathroom.

I reccomend not watching the trailer as it does ruin the movie (trailer fail) but I can guarantee that all the time it invests in building up that tension is definitely worth it.

1272169,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002JTMO0E,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 2]","This is by no means a bad movie, but at the end of the day it doesn't quite hang together.Here's the scoop. It's the close of the 16th century. The Russian's, Fins and Swedes have just finished a 25 year war with each other. A small surveying party embarks on a mission to map out whose territory is whose. They stumble across a small hamlet in the middle of a swamp and things aren't quite as they seem. Something is wrong and the party begins to unravel.This movie benefits from a few things. First is the time and place. I never knew there WAS a 25 year war involving these three countries, and I doubt anyone who is not a scholar of this chunk of history has any idea what life was like in this time and place, so the viewer is thrust into a mysterious world right from the get-go. Then the landscape changes. These guys are in the middle of nowhere and Knut's (one of the surveying team) compass starts acting up. The viewer gets the sense of being lost in an otherworldly place not unlike ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Objective."" It IS unsettling. Then there are a few things that happen (which I won't spoil) that turn the creepy dial up to eleven.The town they come upon is weird in that it's in the middle of nowhere and it's particularly well kept as are its inhabitants. Where are the kids? There aren't any save for one young teen who might be a boy or a girl (depending on who you talk to).Where it fails is in not getting to know the characters and their histories well enough. We know the surveyors are Swedes, but what of the others in the troop? Russians? Fins? Both? Why does Erik seem to be the big dude and and why is he so hostile toward everyone? Why the extreme hatred of religion and those who believe? Why does he leave the girl to die in the root cellar? Maybe I missed something but I doubt it. I have to point the finger at the writer and director.This is a decent watch for a lot of reasons but in the end it needed more.",3,Didn't Make Me Sweat,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1956,"['bad', 'movie', 'end', 'day', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hang', 'scoop', 'close', '16th', 'century', 'Russian', 'Fins', 'Swedes', 'have', 'just', 'finished', '25', 'year', 'war', 'other', 'small', 'surveying', 'party', 'embarks', 'mission', 'map', 'out', 'territory', 'stumble', 'small', 'hamlet', 'middle', 'swamp', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'Something', 'wrong', 'party', 'unravel.This', 'movie', 'benefits', 'few', 'things', 'First', 'time', 'place', 'never', 'knew', 'WAS', '25', 'year', 'war', 'involving', 'three', 'countries', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'scholar', 'chunk', 'history', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'time', 'place', 'viewer', 'thrust', 'mysterious', 'world', 'right', 'get-go', 'Then', 'landscape', 'changes', 'guys', 'are', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Knut', 'one', 'surveying', 'team', 'compass', 'acting', 'up', 'viewer', 'sense', 'being', 'lost', 'otherworldly', 'place', 'not', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Objective', 'unsettling', 'Then', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'turn', 'creepy', 'up', 'eleven.The', 'town', 'come', 'upon', 'weird', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'particularly', 'well', 'kept', 'are', 'inhabitants', 'Where', 'are', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'save', 'one', 'young', 'teen', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'boy', 'girl', 'depending', 'who', 'talk', '.Where', 'not', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'histories', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'surveyors', 'are', 'Swedes', 'what', 'others', 'troop', 'Russians', 'Fins', 'Why', 'Erik', 'seem', 'be', 'big', 'dude', 'why', 'so', 'hostile', 'everyone', 'Why', 'extreme', 'hatred', 'religion', 'who', 'believe', 'Why', 'leave', 'girl', 'die', 'root', 'cellar', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'something', 'doubt', 'have', 'point', 'finger', 'writer', 'director.This', 'decent', 'watch', 'lot', 'reasons', 'end', 'needed', 'more']",N/A
