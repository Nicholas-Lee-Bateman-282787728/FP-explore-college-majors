1381765,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0041KKZIM,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","A long time ago when after I had come of age, come of political age in my early twenties, an old socialist I knew and sought personal and political consul from told me after I had ended a fiery affair with a fellow women political activist that that combination did not mix. Meaning that between ego, the stress of high-wire political activity, and just the likelihood of long separations portended doom to two highly political types surviving together for long. (He did not mention the sexual temptations of being away a lot although if I had asked he probably would have added that as well, or as he well should have). Well, apparently, no, obviously, two literary types like Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn the subjects of this film under review, Hemingway and Gellhorn, are under the same constraints. From a long look (almost two and one half hours) at the film it sure looked that way.When you think about it the above comment makes sense. Take one high-powered manly man (from all appearances, inclinations, life-style and his own bravado) and a top-rated 20th century author, Ernest Hemingway (played by Clive Owen), and one fetching fearless and feisty journalist, Martha Gellhorn(played by Nicole Kidman), and while sparks may fly in the bedroom they almost surely would fly when careers and other issues came up as well, and they did. From the first meeting in Hemingway watering hole Key West (among many others) when they began that dance that eventually led to the bedroom there was always a  one-ups-manship (oops personship) relationship between them from drinking each other under the table to vying for interesting and dangerous war assignments. War assignments that Gellhorn carried out for the rest of her long journalistic career well as the first women to do so, and do it well, after she split with Hemingway in 1945.Of course meeting in 1936, meeting at time that the Spanish Civil War was breaking out, a time when people, political people had to take sides, so they did her gathering an assignment as a war correspondent and he working on the film Spanish Earth which was produced to raise money for the Republican side. As a longtime interested party in the Spanish Civil, having written many pieces about the struggle, I will add here what I have expressed elsewhere-those who fought and defended the Republican side whatever else our political perspectives from the International Brigades to writer like Gellhorn, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Langston Hughes, and the like are kindred spirits. Kudos for Spain.Naturally in a modern romance-centered drama the romance part (okay, okay the sex part) eventually gained center stage and while in Spain for important political business they were able to finally stop dancing around each other and ruffle up the sheets. Hemingway had a little problem though he was still married his second wife. Eventually that problem got resolved by his divorce and subsequent marriage to Gellhorn. That marriage (rather than living together. let&#8217;s say) proved to be a big mistake since Gellhorn had justified big ambitions to cover the impeding wars ahead in Europe and elsewhere after the defeat of the Republicans in Spain and that was a bone of contention throughout their five-year marriage. So, yes, my old socialist friend&#8217;s advice applies as well to the literati as well. Enough said.Note: There are many steamy scenes (oaky, okay sex scenes) in the film between the pair (and why not with a fetching Nicole Kidman) as one would expect in a film using some cinematic license with the true story line. A recent Gellhorn biography and some of her own later comments on the men she had loved and her feelings about sex though would belie some of that torrid sexually displayed. Just so you know if you watch the film. But like I said that&#8217;s what cinematic license is all about.",4,When The Literary Titians Roared,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,3858,"['long', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'come', 'age', 'come', 'political', 'age', 'early', 'twenties', 'old', 'socialist', 'knew', 'sought', 'personal', 'political', 'consul', 'told', 'had', 'ended', 'fiery', 'affair', 'fellow', 'women', 'political', 'activist', 'combination', 'did', 'not', 'mix', 'Meaning', 'ego', 'stress', 'high-wire', 'political', 'activity', 'just', 'likelihood', 'long', 'separations', 'portended', 'doom', 'two', 'highly', 'political', 'types', 'surviving', 'together', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'sexual', 'temptations', 'being', 'away', 'lot', 'had', 'asked', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'Well', 'apparently', 'obviously', 'two', 'literary', 'types', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Martha', 'Gellhorn', 'subjects', 'film', 'review', 'Hemingway', 'Gellhorn', 'are', 'same', 'constraints', 'long', 'look', 'almost', 'two', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'film', 'sure', 'looked', 'way.When', 'think', 'above', 'comment', 'sense', 'Take', 'one', 'high-powered', 'manly', 'man', 'appearances', 'inclinations', 'life-style', 'own', 'bravado', 'top-rated', '20th', 'century', 'author', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'one', 'fetching', 'fearless', 'feisty', 'journalist', 'Martha', 'Gellhorn', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'sparks', 'may', 'fly', 'bedroom', 'almost', 'surely', 'would', 'fly', 'when', 'careers', 'other', 'issues', 'came', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'first', 'meeting', 'Hemingway', 'watering', 'hole', 'Key', 'West', 'many', 'others', 'when', 'began', 'dance', 'eventually', 'led', 'bedroom', 'was', 'always', 'one-ups-manship', 'oops', 'personship', 'relationship', 'drinking', 'other', 'table', 'vying', 'interesting', 'dangerous', 'war', 'assignments', 'War', 'Gellhorn', 'carried', 'out', 'rest', 'long', 'journalistic', 'career', 'well', 'first', 'women', 'do', 'so', 'do', 'well', 'split', 'Hemingway', '1945.Of', 'course', 'meeting', '1936', 'meeting', 'time', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'breaking', 'out', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'political', 'people', 'had', 'take', 'sides', 'did', 'gathering', 'assignment', 'war', 'correspondent', 'working', 'film', 'Spanish', 'Earth', 'was', 'produced', 'raise', 'money', 'Republican', 'side', 'longtime', 'interested', 'party', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'having', 'written', 'many', 'pieces', 'struggle', 'will', 'add', 'here', 'what', 'have', 'expressed', 'elsewhere-those', 'who', 'fought', 'defended', 'Republican', 'side', 'else', 'political', 'perspectives', 'International', 'Brigades', 'writer', 'Gellhorn', 'Hemingway', 'Dos', 'Passos', 'Langston', 'Hughes', 'like', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'Kudos', 'Spain.Naturally', 'modern', 'romance-centered', 'drama', 'romance', 'part', 'okay', 'sex', 'part', 'eventually', 'gained', 'center', 'stage', 'Spain', 'important', 'political', 'business', 'were', 'able', 'finally', 'stop', 'dancing', 'other', 'ruffle', 'up', 'sheets', 'Hemingway', 'had', 'little', 'problem', 'was', 'still', 'married', 'second', 'wife', 'Eventually', 'problem', 'got', 'resolved', 'divorce', 'subsequent', 'marriage', 'Gellhorn', 'marriage', 'rather', 'living', 'together', 'let', '8217', 's', 'say', 'proved', 'be', 'big', 'mistake', 'Gellhorn', 'had', 'justified', 'big', 'ambitions', 'cover', 'impeding', 'wars', 'ahead', 'Europe', 'elsewhere', 'defeat', 'Republicans', 'Spain', 'was', 'bone', 'contention', 'five-year', 'marriage', 'So', 'yes', 'old', 'socialist', 'friend', '8217', 's', 'advice', 'applies', 'as', 'well', 'literati', 'as', 'well', 'Enough', 'said.Note', 'are', 'many', 'steamy', 'scenes', 'oaky', 'okay', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'pair', 'why', 'not', 'fetching', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'using', 'cinematic', 'license', 'true', 'story', 'line', 'recent', 'Gellhorn', 'biography', 'own', 'later', 'comments', 'men', 'had', 'loved', 'feelings', 'sex', 'though', 'would', 'belie', 'torrid', 'sexually', 'displayed', 'Just', 'know', 'watch', 'film', 'said', '8217', 's', 'what', 'cinematic', 'license']",N/A

First Kidman is sexy and magnificent as Gellhorn, especially when appearing as the aging writer with some wonderful reflective acting. Clive is very good, using his muscular stature and larger than life ""braggadocio"" style to project an especially beastial and boistorous Hemingway character, but I think also with a sensitive and human perspective.The opening bloody scene with the Marlin is extremely evocative in summarizing Hemingway's philosophical view that brutality is, in a sense, at the center of life and that ""all things must die"".It clearly underlines the ""existential"" perspective that pervades Hemingway's writing, and his own violent and self-abusive struggle with life. However, what I found most remarkable is the semi-documentary style of the movie, with the grainy original footage, sometimes including digitized insets of Kidman and Clive. The gorgeous sets, the great supporting actors, the good, if not great, acting by the key characters, and a fabulous story of adventure and humanitarian horror, all project an engaging and eventful film well worth watching. I think it is a far better film than the academy award winning ""Reds"" by Warren Beatty (1981), similar in general plot and character.

This procedure was well thought out and well carried out.  I learned that Martha Gellhorn was considered the best woman war correspondent of her time.

This latter technique is especially good when it comes to showing Hemingway (Clive Owen) and Gellhorn (Nicole Kidman) and their involvement in the Spanish Civil War, and on their return to late Thirties New York.  The main problem with Philip Kaufman's film, however, is the plot, which does not have much to say about the two protagonists, other than the fact that Hemingway's capacity to love women was often severely affected by his obsessive masculinity.  The desire to prove himself triumphed over everything; it invaded every aspect of life, rendering him quite an unpleasant, if successful person.  Gellhorn comes across as a feisty person, but we wonder precisely why she remains so attracted to Hemingway.  Partly the fault lies in Clive Owen's performance; at no point does he come across as someone blessed with extraordinary creative talents.  On the contrary he seems petty-minded, almost babyish.  Nicole Kidman does what she can with a thankless role, but her performance remains studiously one-note.  The film is at least an hour too long; it simply makes its central point about Hemingway's behavioral shortcomings over and over again.

1381774,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0041KKZIM,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 10]","""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" should have been amazing. It's produced by HBO, based upon Ernest Hemingway's relationship with his third wife Martha Gellhorn. It has a very talented cast including Nicole Kidman, Clive Owens, Parker Posey, Rodrigo Santoro and Tony Shalhoub.All the ingredients are there. And yet... it fall completely flat. Instead of a passionate story of two intelligent, adventurous writers whose lives briefly intersected in marriage, we get a flabby tale of a two obnoxious rich Americans who dabbled in important wars when they weren't warring with each other.Martha Gellhorn (Kidman) first encountered Ernest Hemingway (Owens) at a bar in 1936, where he was showing off a dead marlin he had caught -- and after trading poorly-written quips, she is invited to his home where he hangs out with various friends. She is inspired to go to Spain to cover the civil war that is happening, and it turns out that Heminway is also going there, helping his friends shoot a documentary about the war.During their time in Spain, they quickly embark on an affair, despite Hemingway being married to his second wife Pauline (Molly Parker). After he divorced Pauline, they later married and embarked on a new life together, traveling and changing the world with their writing -- his novels and her war correspondence. But their relationship was not destined to last.It's hard to put your finger on exactly why ""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" doesn't work as a movie. But one important factor is that the true story of Gellhorn and Hemingway has been ""Hollywoodized"" -- the story has been stripped down, squashed into a mold, and dropped in a misshapen, bland form into our laps.For instance, the true Martha Gellhorn was already a war correspondent when she met Hemingway. In this film, she's an idle rich girl who is inspired to BEGIN her career because of Hemingway... presumably because the writers couldn't imagine an independent woman connecting to a man unless she ""owed"" him somehow.It's directed in a rather flabby, unenthusiastic style -- the entire sequence in Spain drags on forever, leaving you wishing that they would go ANYWHERE else. And the entirety of WORLD WAR II is somehow trivialized into just something for the feuding spouses to write about. There's no excitement, no passion here.The dialogue tends to be trite (""They'll be reading me long after you've been eaten by worms!"") and the ""romantic"" scenes feel hideously shoehorned. Example: a weird scene where Hemingway basically molests Gellhorn backstage at their movie premiere.It also doesn't help that both Gellhorn and Hemingway are depicted as being obnoxious people -- both come across as wealthy, condescending snobs who alight briefly on the oppressed before going back to their lives of privilege. And the movie has a thinly-veiled contempt for Hemingway's second wife Pauline, apparently because she was a Catholic, wasn't an artist, and dared to disagree with her husband's politics.Kidman easily gives the best performance of the movie, both as a gravel-voiced, elderly woman and a fiery blonde war correspondent. Too bad her forehead appears as immobile as marble, though. Owen gives a decent enough performance, but honestly he just seems to be going through the motions -- and given that Hemingway appears to be nothing but a caricature, I can understand his lack of enthusiasm.""Hemingway and Gellhorn"" is proof that you can have all the ingredients of a brilliant movie, only to have it fall completely flat.

1381776,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0041KKZIM,Grady Harp,"[8, 15]","Philip Kaufman who directed this long and boring mess of a film knows better (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Twisted, etc) and the idea of reflecting on the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn which took place during so many important historical events (Spanish Civil War in Franco's Spain, WW II complete with the Allied Invasion of Europe at Normandy Beach, the Russian Invasion of Finland, the turmoil in China as Communism rose in reaction to the Japanese invasion, the strange position of Cuba in all of this). But the screenplay is so mediocre to very bad (screenwriters Jerry Stahl and Barbara Turner) and the level of acting is so superficial that it simply falls flat.Martha Gellhorn, the Collier's reporter who becomes a war correspondent and marries Ernest Hemingway as she travels up the ladder of fame, is by far the main character here.  A very well made-up aged Martha (Nicole Kidman) opens the story as she is being interviewed for a TV program.  We immediately are in flashbacks to how this stern woman met Hemingway in a Key West bar, matched him quip for poorly written quip and finally follows him in a very phony setup: Hemingway (Clive Owens in a shoddy performance) is traveling with John Dos Passos (David Strathairn), Spanish patriot Paco Zarra (Rodrigo Santoro) and crew to shoot a film by Joris Ivens (Lars Ulrich) to show the public the atrocities of Franco in the Spanish Revolution - a tiresomely overused gimmick. Everyone drinks a lot and Hemingway finally seduces Gellhorn to his bed in Madrid (he is currently married to the very Catholic Pauline (Molly Parker) who upon discovery his adultery refuses to divorce him). As the situation in Spain falls down, Hemingway and Gellhorn take their need to write - Hemingway to complete FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and Martha flies off to various war fronts to be a war correspondent. Together they fight their way through experiences in China and other hot spots until ultimately Hemingway remains drunk in Cuba `fighting off German U boats' and Gellhorn gives up on him.Nicole Kidman gives the only remarkable performance; Clive Owens could have phoned in his role.  Others in the huge cast of miniscule parts are Robert Duval , embarrassingly bad as a Russian General, Joan Chen as Madame Chiang, Tony Shalhoub as the Russian spy Koltsov, an excellent Santiago Cabrera as the famous war photographer Robert Capa, Peter Coyote (don't blink), Diane Baker, Parker Posey, and Connie Nielsen.  The film runs 2  hours on HBO and could easily have been edited down to an hour and a half.  The only real saving grace (meaning the only reason to watch it0 is the very artistic way the film is a blend between contemporary cinematography and real film footage from the events in the story.

This film takes a close look at how she got into the business of becoming a celebrity reporter who was attracted to capturing human suffering on paper. While she comes across in this film as a bit of a free-spirited adventurer in search of fame, hers was an honest quest. She quickly made her mark in the Spanish Civil War and the Chino-Japanese conflict as a writer who had an unique angle on world affairs: civilians in war. Complicating her life was her six-year fling with Ernest Hemingway, that famous boisterous, womanizing buccaneer of war columnist cum popular novelist. They met in the Florida Keys, again in Madrid and married in Cuba in 1940. The one feature in their lives that gets stressed repeatedly is their shared passion for action, danger, and intrigue. This docudrama stresses both the irrepressible macho in Papa and the seductive charm in Gellhorn. What a torrid fling was theirs; what a savage parting of the ways. Hemingway betrays his new wife by unceremoniously stealing her job. Forever afterwards, Gellhorn worked her career to erase any memory of her relationship with Ernest. While this film doesn&#8217;t reveal anything new about Hemingway - still ever the uproariously lusty old drunk - it does provide some interesting insights into modern warfare and the use of propaganda to win the hearts and minds of the people. As the action runs out and there are no more battles to report on, we see the old man&#8217;s gusto turn to despair and angst.

1381781,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0041KKZIM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","There were pretty lofty expectations going into HBO's prestige piece ""Hemingway & Gellhorn."" With the tempestuous relationship between the writers and the scope of history that they survived, this seemed like a can't miss proposition. Oscar nominated director Philip Kaufman assembled a top tier cast including Nicole Kidman and Clive Owen and set his film on an immense international canvas. And yet, rarely has a production so divided mainstream critics as well as viewers. If you look at the critical consensus, the ratings start at absolute raves (Entertainment Weekly) to excoriating pans (New York Times) and everywhere in between. While HBO films is used to being a leader in TV films, this is indeed a project that has divided its audience with both fervent supporters and equally vocal opponents. Truthfully, I can understand both viewpoints. The film is overlong, comes to a strangely rushed ending, underutilizes a strong supporting cast, and is visually devised in an almost surreal sepia-toned Forrest Gump-like blend of actors into actual historical footage. It's big, bold, and messy in a very in-your-face way, just like the central pair. And I found it both strangely off-putting and strangely appealing!Hemingway, of course, is always a larger-than-life figure. The film is told in a series of flashbacks as an elderly Gellhorn (Kidman) recounts her life with the great man. Their primary story begins in Key West in 1936 and wraps up with Hemingway's suicide in 1961. In between, though, is the meat of the relationship as the couple fall in love in war torn Spain, vacation in politically volatile China, separate for different assignments, and eventually attempt to cohabitate in domestic bliss. Gellhorn, a war correspondent (and inspiration for Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls), ends up being the real centerpoint of the story. Whereas there have been many portraits of Hemingway, and this offered little in the way of new information, I did understand the influence and impact that Gellhorn had on the man. This was not a story that I was overly familiar with, so it certainly held my interest. Owen is suitably blustery, appealing but never going very deep. Kidman (while I know some found her miscast) actually does quite well in my estimation. The supporting cast includes Molly Parker, a wasted Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub, Parker Posey, David Strathairn (always relaible), Connie Nielson, Joan Chen, and a barely seen Peter Coyote among a plethora of familiar faces.The story of Hemingway and Gellhorn is certainly a fascinating one. Where Kaufman's piece suffers is in an inconsistent tone. Playing at times as comedy, sometimes as romance, sometimes as domestic drama, sometimes as adventure--I never knew exactly what I supposed to take seriously. Some of the shots that put our actors into real footage elicited actual giggles from me, and I'm sure that was not their intent. Some of the battle sequences were done for amusement, some for horror. It was weird in many ways, at least tonally and stylistically. But Kaufman never plays it safe, creating this bold and outlandish vision. In the end, it never really works--but it is always strangely fascinating. What the story misses most is its heart. When the couple have a moment or two to really connect believably, the film lights up briefly. So much time is spent in visual trickery, I couldn't help but yearn for more simplicity, more traditional storytelling. Yet, I never disliked ""Hemingway & Gellhorn."" It may not be fully successful, but it's strikingly different. About 3 1/2 stars.

1381787,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0041KKZIM,M. Oleson,"[36, 38]","This HBO film is more about the career and life of Martha Gellhorn who became Ernest Hemingway's third wife.  Don't get me wrong, Clive Owen's Hemingway gets equal screen time with beautiful Nicole Kidman's Gellhorn but as she puts it at the end of the movie, she won't be a footnote in someone else's life.With a close up of Kidman as a now 70-something subject of an interview, the opening scene gives the viewer an idea of the quality that would persist throughout the next 2  hours.  I'm reminded of Kidman's ability to become unrecognizable in ""The Hours"" from 2002.  Here as well, as she not only uses a masterful makeup job but the deeper voice and cadence of an older more experienced woman.  Marty Gellhorn was a reporter for ""Collier's"" magazine, a weekly that competed with ""Life"" and ""Look"" in days past.  After meeting Hemingway in a sweaty bar in Key West, she becomes interested in a civil war in Spain which would eventually lead up to WW II.While Hemingway goes there as well, he goes in luxury as the famed writer that he was.  Gellhorn, hitches rides where she can, including inside an army tank.  Directed by Phillip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff""), the film mixes in scenes in beautiful living color along with regular changes that drift throughout the artist pallet.  This includes grainy black and white to match real news footage of the late 1930's.  That trick was a little off-putting at first but becomes very effective as the film progresses.While I'm a big fan of Clive Owen, I wasn't taken with him as Hemingway.

The combined magnetism of Hemingway and Gellhorn ushered them into social circles that included the elite of Hollywood, the aristocracy of the literary world, and the First Family of the United States.  As witnesses to history, they covered all the great conflicts of their time.The first-rate performance by Kidman can't save the movie from its soap-opera script as Martha increasingly endures the jealousies of her husband.  Owen's portrayal is unfortunately inconsistent.  In some scenes, he is seductive, in others kind of silly.
