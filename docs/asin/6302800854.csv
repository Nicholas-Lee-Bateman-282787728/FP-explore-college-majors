336477,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302800854,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","This movie started the wave of biopics that began after WWII. Larry Parks doesn't look the least bit like Al Jolson. For that matter, the script doesn't look much like Jolson's life either. However, the film is very entertaining with a few ironies for the classic film buff. When Parks is on stage, you really get a taste of Jolson in his prime. Al Jolson actually tutored Parks in how to move and interact with the audience using his own style, and it comes across well, even if it is obvious that you are hearing Jolson's voice during the performances and that this voice does not match Larry Parks' speaking voice at all.Jolson's life story has been sanitized here to keep in line with the values of the post-war motion picture production code, right down to extending the life of Jolson's mother an extra forty years - she died when Al was ten. Also, the movie has Jolson playing the career-absorbed bachelor until he meets his wife Julie Benson (code for Ruby Keeler) when he is in his forties. Yes, Al was career-absorbed, but he still went through two marriages and two divorces before he ever got to Ruby Keeler.Two very interesting points are the insertion of the fictional character Steve Martin that allegedly got Al into show business and also the choice of director. The first interesting point is that fictional character Steve Martin is played by William Demarest, who actually had a bit part in 1927's ""The Jazz Singer"". You'll see him sharing a plate of eggs with Al at Coffee Dan's just minutes before Al bursts into song in ""Toot Toot Tootsie"". Demarest was a bit player over at Warner's during the beginning of his career. He had no real association with Al Jolson that I know of.  The second interesting point is the choice of director - Alfred E. Green. Mr. Green was among that group of directors that ground out the early talkies for Warner Bros during the time that Jolson was a star at that studio. However, he never directed any of the eight motion pictures that Al Jolson starred in for Warners. There were four directors that Jolson worked with over at Warner Brothers that were still alive when this film was made, but for some reason none of them got the job.At any rate, the movie is very entertaining and well-paced with great renditions of Jolson's acts and songs. For the unvarnished truth about Jolson's life, try to find a copy of the documentary ""The Real Al Jolson Story"" made in 1986 and originally telecast by Bravo, back when they really were dedicated to the performing arts and before they became so concerned with Top Chefs and Flipping Out - you know, the same kind of stuff you can find on 50 other channels.",5,Highly entertaining and almost completely fictional,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2655,"['movie', 'started', 'wave', 'biopics', 'began', 'WWII', 'Larry', 'Parks', ""n't"", 'look', 'least', 'bit', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'matter', 'script', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'Jolson', 'life', 'either', 'However', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'few', 'ironies', 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'When', 'Parks', 'stage', 'really', 'get', 'taste', 'Jolson', 'prime', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'actually', 'tutored', 'Parks', 'how', 'move', 'interact', 'audience', 'using', 'own', 'style', 'across', 'well', 'even', 'obvious', 'are', 'hearing', 'Jolson', 'voice', 'performances', 'voice', 'not', 'match', 'Larry', 'Parks', 'speaking', 'voice', 'all.Jolson', 'life', 'story', 'been', 'sanitized', 'here', 'keep', 'line', 'values', 'post-war', 'motion', 'picture', 'production', 'code', 'right', 'down', 'extending', 'life', 'Jolson', 'mother', 'extra', 'forty', 'years', 'died', 'when', 'Al', 'was', 'ten', 'Also', 'movie', 'Jolson', 'playing', 'career-absorbed', 'bachelor', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Benson', 'code', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'when', 'forties', 'Yes', 'Al', 'was', 'career-absorbed', 'still', 'went', 'two', 'marriages', 'two', 'divorces', 'ever', 'got', 'Ruby', 'Keeler.Two', 'very', 'interesting', 'points', 'are', 'insertion', 'fictional', 'character', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'allegedly', 'got', 'Al', 'show', 'business', 'also', 'choice', 'director', 'first', 'interesting', 'point', 'fictional', 'character', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'played', 'William', 'Demarest', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'bit', 'part', '1927', 'Jazz', 'Singer', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sharing', 'plate', 'eggs', 'Al', 'Coffee', 'Dan', 'just', 'minutes', 'Al', 'song', 'Toot', 'Toot', 'Tootsie', 'Demarest', 'was', 'bit', 'player', 'Warner', 'beginning', 'career', 'had', 'real', 'association', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'know', 'second', 'interesting', 'point', 'choice', 'director', 'Alfred', 'E.', 'Green', 'Mr.', 'Green', 'was', 'group', 'directors', 'ground', 'early', 'talkies', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'time', 'Jolson', 'was', 'star', 'studio', 'However', 'never', 'directed', 'eight', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'starred', 'Warners', 'were', 'four', 'directors', 'Jolson', 'worked', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'reason', 'none', 'got', 'job.At', 'rate', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well-paced', 'great', 'renditions', 'Jolson', 'acts', 'songs', 'unvarnished', 'truth', 'Jolson', 'life', 'try', 'find', 'copy', 'documentary', 'Real', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'made', '1986', 'originally', 'telecast', 'Bravo', 'back', 'when', 'really', 'were', 'dedicated', 'performing', 'arts', 'became', 'so', 'concerned', 'Top', 'Chefs', 'Flipping', 'Out', 'know', 'same', 'kind', 'stuff', 'can', 'find', '50', 'other', 'channels']",The Jolson Story VHS

Roberts ""movie buff""","[61, 63]","The young Asa Yoelson (Scotty Beckett) runs away from home to join Steve Martin (William Demarest) in vaudeville against the wishes of his parents. They find him and realising how much he wants to get into show business they reluctantly agree for him to join Martin on tour. As he grows up he changes his name to Al Jolson (now played by Larry Parks) and becomes a big Broadway star. He meets Julie Benson (Evelyn Keyes) and they get married. However, all that Jolson really cares about is to get in front of an audience and sing so his marriage suffers because of it. He stars in one successful Broadway show after another and then is invited to go to Hollywood to take the lead in the first ever talking picture &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. In later years his popularity declines and he finds it harder to get work. He does in fact make a sensational comeback and is in even bigger demand than ever which was portrayed in the sequel &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot;.When I first saw &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; I had never heard of its star Larry Parks although I had bought a few Jolson records prior to seeing the film. Parks gave a magnificent portrayal but apart from appearing in &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot; three years later he made very few films after that due to the McCarthy communist &quot;witch hunt&quot; which was a shame.Some favourite lines from the film:William Demarest: &quot;Give that boy a spotlight!&quot;.Tamara Shayne (to Ludwig Donath): &quot;Papa, Asa isn't Asa any more!&quot;.Larry Parks (to orchestra leader): &quot;Oscar, what are you doing with that phone - this is no time to call up women!&quot;.Parks (to audience in theatre): &quot;Settle back folks - you ain't heard nothin' yet!&quot;.Parks (to audience in theatre): &quot;I'm going into what they call talking pictures - don't know what's going to happen to me - but er, if I come back you'll let me - won't you?&quot;.&quot;The Jolson Story&quot; is one of those rare movies that you can enjoy over and over again and has a high place in my Top Ten films of all time. Wonderful acting, superb colour, fascinating story (even though not entirely accurate), and how about those memorable old songs - &quot;California Here I Come&quot;, &quot;April Showers&quot;, &quot;Swanee&quot;, &quot;Rockabye Your Baby&quot;, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, &quot;Mammy&quot;, &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot;, &quot;I'm Sitting On Top of the World&quot;, &quot;About a Quarter to Nine&quot;, etc. This film is worth seeing just to hear the real Al Jolson belting out the songs that made him famous.

With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.The Al Jolson Story is an excellent reminder of the music that was sung by African-American singers and musicians that most American paid little attention to until a Jewish man born in Russia (Lithuania)embraced it fully and brought a music style that he loved to all Americans.",5,Imitation is the highest form of flattery,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1268,"['Al', 'Jolson', 'Elvis', 'Pressley', 'two', 'Europen', 'Americans', 'who', 'black', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'took', 'imitation', 'highest', 'level', 'According', 'music', 'historian', 'Larry', 'Stempel', 'No', 'one', 'had', 'heard', 'anything', 'quite', 'Broadway', 'Author', 'Stephen', 'Banfield', 'writing', 'Jolson', 'style', 'was', 'arguably', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'factor', 'defining', 'modern', 'musical', 'enjoyed', 'performing', 'blackface', 'makeup', 'theatrical', 'convention', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'unique', 'dynamic', 'style', 'singing', 'black', 'music', 'jazz', 'blues', 'was', 'later', 'credited', 'single-handedly', 'introducing', 'African-American', 'music', 'white', 'audiences', 'As', 'early', '1911', 'became', 'known', 'fighting', 'anti-black', 'discrimination', 'Broadway', 'Jolson', 'well-known', 'theatrics', 'promotion', 'equality', 'Broadway', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'many', 'black', 'performers', 'playwrights', 'songwriters', 'including', 'Cab', 'Calloway', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'Ethel', 'Waters.The', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'excellent', 'reminder', 'music', 'was', 'sung', 'African-American', 'singers', 'musicians', 'most', 'American', 'paid', 'little', 'attention', 'Jewish', 'man', 'born', 'Russia', 'Lithuania', 'embraced', 'fully', 'brought', 'music', 'style', 'loved', 'Americans']",The Jolson Story VHS

I loved this film and used to sing the songs all the time.  My grandmother knew many of these songs and was delighted to hear me sing them.  As a matter of fact, one of my dad's customers gave us a box of old toys, and in there was a costume with striped pants and a long tailed coat.  I used to wear this and pretend I was in blackface singing the score.Because this movie was televised with commercials, often it was trimmed down, so it was nice to see the entire film restored.  I'm sure there were several scenes I had never seen before.The color print is amazing.  As a matter of fact, I had remembered this to be a black and white movie; it wasn't, but we only had b&w; tv!  The film looks like it was meticulously restored, but the cover doesn't say anything about that.  There was only one early scene, where the young Asa (Scotty Beckett) is singing Ave Maria in a catholic boys choir, that the sound is distorted. Otherwise the picture and sound are clear and crisp.My only disappointment is that there are no extras on the DVD except for two trailers - which I expected to be for The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again, but they were for the original Lost Horizon (just a promo, not even scenes from the film); and for Pal Joey, which has no connection to the Jolson Story.I would have preferred a commentary track; clips of the real Al Jolson; some documentary material about Jolson and also about Larry Parks and his great success in the role, and subsequent fall from grace through the House Unamerican Activities Committee.Finally, you CAN'T have this film without it's companion, Jolson Sings Again.",5,Beautiful print!

U.K. The movie changed my life from then on i wanted to sing and to this day i still make my living as a vocalist. In the days before TV and only having the Radio to listen to i grew up thinking Larry Parks really was Al Jolson and the shock in later years to find that he really did`nt look like him and the story was pure Hollywood hoakam. It was almost as big as the shock i had learning Bing Crosby wore a toupee.After all these years i don`t care its a wonderful movie that still brings a tear to the eye when i think of that small boy going to the movies with his mother and aunt. Larry Parks was brilliant ( can anyone name any other movies he was in ) The great Al was still in top form singing the songs that he made famous sadly leaving us just as part two was released.

Unfortunately, the story has been changed quite a bit from what the reality was for Jolson. However, the convincing acting is incredible and the plot moves along at a very good pace.We see the movie begin with young Asa Yoelson (who changed his name to Al Jolson) coming very late for his father's synagogue service because he was singing in a burlesque theater. Of course, Asa Yoelson gets quite a punishment from his parents, Cantor Yoelson and Mrs. Yoelson (Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne, respectively). Eventually Asa runs away from home to join up with a vaudevillian named Steve Martin (William Demarest) and Asa gets his start in show business and a name change along the way. We also see Jolson constantly moving up the ladder and getting more and more of the spotlight especially after he leaves Steve Martin and joins Lew Dockstader's show. We then see Al move to the Winter Garden Theater where he loves his audience and they love him for living them.Al eventually hires Steve Martin to be his manager and proceeds to tackle show business with a manic fit that never seems to stop. After every triumph, Al wants more. He falls in love and marries Julie Benson (Evelyn Keyes) although in real life Jolson was never married to anyone named Julie Benson. He was in fact married to four women including Ruby Keeler; and for some reason I can't figure out there is no mention of Ruby Keeler in this movie. There's also some doubt that Al Jolson's father was actually a Cantor in a synagogue.What will happen after Al marries Julie Benson--a woman who wants to live life at a slower pace in the country? How will Al and his wife reconcile their differences? He wants to entertain and tour in big cities; she wants to the simple, quiet life. No spoilers here--watch the movie to find out the answers to these questions and more!The DVD offers few extras; but with a film this good, you can overlook the lack of extras and even, to some extent, the discrepancies between Al Jolson's real life and the biopic. I guess Hollywood in 1946 wanted to ""sanitize"" Al Jolson's story especially since he was still living at the time this film was released. However, I'm disappointed in the discrepancies between Jolson's real life and the life story told in this movie. I will give four stars to The Jolson Story on DVD.Even with its flaws, I still highly recommend this for people who want to know about one of America's greatest entertainers ever. It has been said time and again that Al Jolson was one of the first to be able to reach out to his adoring audiences and make every last person feel that he was truly singing to them and them alone. Al Jolson deserves to be remembered much, much more than he is; and this movie is a great way for us to remember the remarkable talents of this man.",4,give that man a spotlight !!!,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,2899,"['Jolson', 'Story', 'first', 'what', 'essentially', 'two', 'part', 'biopic', 'life', 'times', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'been', 'changed', 'quite', 'bit', 'what', 'reality', 'was', 'Jolson', 'However', 'convincing', 'acting', 'incredible', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace.We', 'see', 'movie', 'begin', 'young', 'Asa', 'Yoelson', 'who', 'changed', 'name', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'coming', 'very', 'late', 'father', 'synagogue', 'service', 'was', 'singing', 'burlesque', 'theater', 'course', 'Asa', 'Yoelson', 'quite', 'punishment', 'parents', 'Cantor', 'Yoelson', 'Mrs.', 'Yoelson', 'Ludwig', 'Donath', 'Tamara', 'Shayne', 'respectively', 'Eventually', 'Asa', 'away', 'home', 'join', 'up', 'vaudevillian', 'named', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Asa', 'start', 'show', 'business', 'name', 'change', 'way', 'also', 'see', 'Jolson', 'constantly', 'moving', 'up', 'ladder', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'spotlight', 'especially', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Lew', 'Dockstader', 'show', 'then', 'see', 'Al', 'move', 'Winter', 'Garden', 'Theater', 'where', 'audience', 'love', 'living', 'them.Al', 'eventually', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'be', 'manager', 'proceeds', 'tackle', 'show', 'business', 'manic', 'fit', 'never', 'stop', 'triumph', 'Al', 'more', 'love', 'marries', 'Julie', 'Benson', 'Evelyn', 'Keyes', 'real', 'life', 'Jolson', 'was', 'never', 'married', 'anyone', 'named', 'Julie', 'Benson', 'was', 'fact', 'married', 'four', 'women', 'including', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'mention', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'movie', 'also', 'doubt', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'father', 'was', 'actually', 'Cantor', 'synagogue.What', 'will', 'happen', 'Al', 'marries', 'Julie', 'Benson', 'woman', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'slower', 'pace', 'country', 'How', 'will', 'Al', 'wife', 'reconcile', 'differences', 'entertain', 'tour', 'big', 'cities', 'simple', 'quiet', 'life', 'spoilers', 'here', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'questions', 'more', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'film', 'good', 'can', 'overlook', 'lack', 'extras', 'even', 'extent', 'discrepancies', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'real', 'life', 'biopic', 'guess', 'Hollywood', '1946', 'wanted', 'sanitize', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'story', 'especially', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'However', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'discrepancies', 'Jolson', 'real', 'life', 'life', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'DVD.Even', 'flaws', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'entertainers', 'ever', 'been', 'said', 'time', 'again', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'out', 'adoring', 'audiences', 'make', 'last', 'person', 'feel', 'was', 'truly', 'singing', 'alone', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'be', 'remembered', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'remember', 'remarkable', 'talents', 'man']",The Jolson Story VHS

336510,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,6302800854,"Phred ""Phred""","[2, 2]","Among my earliest musical memories was finding myself enthralled with the musical stylings of the great Al Jolson. By this time the Jolson story and most of his music was available to me only by rerun television shows. Even so I was an Al L Jolson fan before I knew the name of any AM Radio top 40 singers. That said I fully expected the Jolson story to be a slam-dunk five-star no questions asked great movie.Allowing that this is a fairly standard period film biopic the portrayal of the great Al Jolson is surprisingly complex. We follow the young cantor's son from his preadolescent break with his father -with his father's grudging approval up through a rather abrupt ending which appears to coincide with the ending of his marriage. In between the best news about this movie is that Al Jolson sings while his on-screen actor counterpart, Larry Parks lip-synchs. That Larry Parks speaks without any of the New York accent of Al Jolson is forgivable but painfully apparent every time Mr. Parks bursts out with Al Jolson's signature ""You ain't heard nothing yet!""As much as I loved all of the singing, all of the choreography was dull. Al Jolson was one of singers who linked tin-pan alley to jazz to Broadway but other than changes in costumes there was a distinct shortage of clues as to what time periods were being portrayed. Full marks should go to the folks in makeup who did a brilliant job in aging many of the supporting actors. The aging of William Demarest (Steve Martin), Ludwig Donath (Cantor Yelson) and Tamara Shayne (Mrs. Yoelson) constituted noteworthy cosmetic effects and the most reliable indicators of the passage of time. Larry Parks of course receives only a light graying at the temple ensuring that even the mature Al Jolson is portrayed as a handsome man perhaps more so than the real Al Jolson.A final point this movie seriously dragged out. This may have been to provide sufficient storyline to justify so many different musical numbers;  all of them near signature tunes for the many hit wonder Jolson.One problem watching a 60-year-old movie in the 21st century. Al Jolson built part of his early career as a black faced singer. A typical 1946 audience would have known this and not given it a thought. I found myself very uncomfortable and desperately wishing that this portion of the man's history could quickly be concluded. By the end of th emovie, everytime I heard the word ""Mammy"", I was shuddering.The real Al Jolson was a lot of things. He was one of the all-time great singing entertainers in the history of America. According to the movie he was a great guy if more than a little of a workaholic. He was also an enormous egotist. He was famous for stopping a show to give a spontaneous concert under the theory that he was the only reason why the audience was there. This is portrayed in the movie but absent any of the friction it tended to cause with performers who also wanted their chance to be seen. The Al Jolson Story of course emphasizes the best of this performer but too many of the details around the edges were sacrificed. You may love the experience of Jolson singing but get fustrated with impatience for this movie to end.",3,"Love, Love LOVED the singing.. but...too much of a period piece",1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,3181,"['earliest', 'musical', 'memories', 'was', 'finding', 'enthralled', 'musical', 'stylings', 'great', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'time', 'Jolson', 'story', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'available', 'only', 'rerun', 'television', 'shows', 'Even', 'was', 'Al', 'L', 'Jolson', 'fan', 'knew', 'name', 'AM', 'Radio', 'top', '40', 'singers', 'said', 'fully', 'expected', 'Jolson', 'story', 'be', 'slam-dunk', 'five-star', 'questions', 'asked', 'great', 'movie.Allowing', 'fairly', 'standard', 'period', 'film', 'portrayal', 'great', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'follow', 'young', 'cantor', 'son', 'preadolescent', 'break', 'father', '-with', 'father', 'grudging', 'approval', 'up', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'coincide', 'ending', 'marriage', 'best', 'news', 'movie', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'sings', 'on-screen', 'actor', 'counterpart', 'Larry', 'Parks', 'lip-synchs', 'Larry', 'Parks', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'forgivable', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'time', 'Mr', 'Parks', 'out', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'signature', 'ai', ""n't"", 'heard', 'nothing', 'yet', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'singing', 'choreography', 'was', 'dull', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'was', 'one', 'singers', 'who', 'linked', 'tin-pan', 'alley', 'jazz', 'Broadway', 'other', 'changes', 'costumes', 'was', 'distinct', 'shortage', 'clues', 'what', 'time', 'periods', 'were', 'being', 'portrayed', 'Full', 'marks', 'should', 'go', 'folks', 'makeup', 'who', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'aging', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'aging', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Ludwig', 'Donath', 'Cantor', 'Yelson', 'Tamara', 'Shayne', 'Mrs.', 'Yoelson', 'constituted', 'noteworthy', 'cosmetic', 'effects', 'most', 'reliable', 'indicators', 'passage', 'time', 'Larry', 'Parks', 'course', 'only', 'light', 'graying', 'temple', 'ensuring', 'even', 'mature', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'portrayed', 'handsome', 'man', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'real', 'Al', 'Jolson.A', 'final', 'point', 'movie', 'seriously', 'dragged', 'out', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'storyline', 'justify', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'musical', 'numbers', 'signature', 'tunes', 'many', 'hit', 'wonder', 'Jolson.One', 'problem', 'watching', '60-year-old', 'movie', '21st', 'century', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'built', 'part', 'early', 'career', 'black', 'faced', 'singer', 'typical', '1946', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'not', 'given', 'thought', 'found', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'desperately', 'wishing', 'portion', 'man', 'history', 'could', 'quickly', 'be', 'concluded', 'end', 'th', 'emovie', 'everytime', 'heard', 'word', 'Mammy', 'was', 'shuddering.The', 'real', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'was', 'lot', 'things', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'singing', 'entertainers', 'history', 'America', 'According', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'guy', 'more', 'little', 'workaholic', 'was', 'also', 'enormous', 'egotist', 'was', 'famous', 'stopping', 'show', 'give', 'spontaneous', 'concert', 'theory', 'was', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'audience', 'was', 'there', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'absent', 'friction', 'tended', 'cause', 'performers', 'who', 'also', 'wanted', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'course', 'best', 'performer', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'edges', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'may', 'love', 'experience', 'Jolson', 'singing', 'get', 'fustrated', 'impatience', 'movie', 'end']",The Jolson Story VHS

It covers the life of the incomparable Al Jolson, a wonderful performer best known today for his performance in the first talkie ""The Jazz Singer."" It seems that the film goes nowhere that the ordinary bio-pic about a show-biz star doesn't, but it is somehow better. Perhaps that is because the subject was such an amazing performer.Larry Parks plays Jolson, a seemingly strange choice since the two do not look alike. However, Parks looks quite a bit like an older version of Scotty Beckett who plays the younger Jolson, so the casting works well. Parks does a good job impersonating Jolson's style as a singer even though he is lipsyncing to Jolson's own voice. At first, he seems a bit stiff, but later, the movements become his own and he seems very natural in the part. Jolson was a very complex figure, but he makes the man relatable and enjoyable. It almost doesn't matter if all he does is sing (and over 20 songs too); that is what he did best after all.Evelyn Keyes plays Julie, a thinly disguised substitute for Ruby Keeler. She does not capture Keeler's natural innocence, but she does make a good match for Jolson. Her part in the story adds more emotional connection to the film. In fact, her role at the end of the film makes it all the better since it ends with a sob instead of a soft sigh.There are some inaccuracies in this movie. For example, Jolson did not sing ""There's a Rainbow Round My Shoulder"" in The Jazz Singer.

In the sequel (Jolson Sings Again) he gives full credit to Larry Parks whose performance in both films is phenomenal. Even if not the biggest Jolson fan, any fan of musicals with great songs from Vaudeville days to the Korean War will enjoy this film and its sequel.",5,At the top of biopics,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,470,"['wide', 'agreement', 'initial', 'release', 'continuing', 'today', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'top', 'biopics', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'singing', 'sound', 'track', 'used', 'distant', 'shot', 'sequel', 'Jolson', 'Sings', 'Again', 'full', 'credit', 'Larry', 'Parks', 'performance', 'films', 'phenomenal', 'Even', 'not', 'biggest', 'Jolson', 'fan', 'fan', 'musicals', 'great', 'songs', 'Vaudeville', 'days', 'Korean', 'War', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'sequel']",The Jolson Story VHS
