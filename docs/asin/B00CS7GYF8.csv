I bought it & watched it the day the DVD arrived & as a lover of the whole Indian kidnapping the white woman who falls in love with his gentle and sexy ways over the ""savage"" white man, I sure was not disappointed by either the characters of Anna and Tokalah and the secondary characters, nor the stunning actors that portrayed the two.An overview of the amazing movie following:Anna on her way to marry a white man she is yet to meet is ambushed by fierce Sioux Indians, many are killed but Anna is spared by the stunning Tokalah as he has had visions of her that we learn about later. Anna marries but not long after Tokalah finds her and kidnaps her with her friend Sarah. Anna in time falls for the gentle, sweet and gorgeous Tokalah and gives in to her temptations, having told him she would never betray her husband.With the love comes the heartbreaking decision of making a choice, save Tokalah and his people and return to her husband, brother and life she knew before or remain and risk their death. However, is the U.S Cavalry trustworthy and going to keep their word and can Anna stay away from a life and love that have captured her heart?I know reality would have been different but I still love the fantasy that comes with this genre of books and movies that I completely get lost in",5,Tokalah Captured My Beating Heart,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1444,"['just', 'happened', 'come', 'trailer', 'movie', 'searching', 'Native', 'American/White', 'Woman', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'hooked', 'instantly', 'bought', 'watched', 'day', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'lover', 'whole', 'Indian', 'kidnapping', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'gentle', 'sexy', 'ways', 'savage', 'white', 'man', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Tokalah', 'secondary', 'characters', 'stunning', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'two.An', 'overview', 'amazing', 'movie', 'following', 'Anna', 'way', 'marry', 'white', 'man', 'yet', 'meet', 'ambushed', 'fierce', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'many', 'are', 'killed', 'Anna', 'spared', 'stunning', 'Tokalah', 'had', 'visions', 'learn', 'later', 'Anna', 'marries', 'not', 'long', 'Tokalah', 'kidnaps', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'Anna', 'time', 'falls', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'gorgeous', 'Tokalah', 'temptations', 'having', 'told', 'would', 'never', 'betray', 'love', 'heartbreaking', 'decision', 'making', 'choice', 'save', 'Tokalah', 'people', 'return', 'husband', 'brother', 'life', 'knew', 'remain', 'risk', 'death', 'However', 'U.S', 'Cavalry', 'trustworthy', 'going', 'keep', 'word', 'can', 'Anna', 'stay', 'away', 'life', 'love', 'have', 'captured', 'heart', 'know', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'still', 'love', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'books', 'movies', 'completely', 'get', 'lost']",Stolen Women; Captured Hearts

The Native American culture[s] generally took captives and used them to replace persons killed or captured by other tribes. They wanted these people healthy enough to work, so abuse is not part of their traditions. This, of course, according to the many books I've read on the subject.

I have this on VHS taped from t.v. years ago and, I'm ashamed to say, have looked at it several times.  It is right up there with a regency romance novel for being something I'm ashamed to admit I like.  I do not read romance novels but I guess I can't brag about that because I continue to look at this movie.  Janine Turner is only a so so actress in it but I guess she does the best she can with the script and she looks so beautiful that you don't care. When she and Michael Greyeyes lock eyes your heart will roll over in your chest.  I've never seen anything like the electricity between them on screen before.This story may indeed be based on a true one and I'm sure in that period of time it happened more than once.  Kidnapped woman falls for her captor - don't they call it brain washing or Stockholm syndrome or something modern like that. Michael Greyeyes is gorgeous and there is wonderful palpable chemistry between them. I don't know why he wasn't cast in more movies as a romantic lead. Shades of Valentino - what this guy can do with a look.  Some of the acting by the other characters is good, some adequate.  The ending is not plausible not because of what she does but because nobody will believe she could have found them again.

No one really knows what Anne felt, because she never talked about. Plus this warrior and his tribe didn't take her. it was another tribe that took her and they traded her. Anna also had blonde hair, not red which I wish they had a blonde hair actor. Anna and Sarah were both in their teens, Anna had a very hard life. She had it hard even when she was returned. I loved this movie. because they made it into a romantic story. I watch it all the time even tho I know the real story.",5,A very romantic movie.,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,570,"['love', 'movie', 'alittle', 'disappointing', 'read', 'real', 'Anna', 'Sarah', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'Anne', 'felt', 'never', 'talked', 'warrior', 'tribe', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'was', 'tribe', 'took', 'traded', 'Anna', 'also', 'had', 'blonde', 'hair', 'not', 'red', 'wish', 'had', 'blonde', 'hair', 'actor', 'Anna', 'Sarah', 'were', 'teens', 'Anna', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'life', 'had', 'hard', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'returned', 'loved', 'movie', 'made', 'romantic', 'story', 'watch', 'time', 'even', 'tho', 'know', 'real', 'story']",Stolen Women; Captured Hearts
