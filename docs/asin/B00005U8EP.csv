683561,A150HXN1PBL3C9,B00005U8EP,"Edward S. Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[4, 7]","""The Man Who Loved Women"" is part comedic-drama, part psychological study of the male and female pysche and part relationship manual for males lacking confidence. I believe this is one of Burt Reynolds' best movies for the myriad of themes touched on throughout the movie. For one, the image one might have of the real-life Burt Reynolds doesn't seem too far from his role as David Fowler.  It has been often stated, maybe unfairly, that Burt Reynolds doesn't act, he ""Behaves.""  In this movie he plays a man so obsessed with women that it literally kills him. While this might be a metaphor for a bigger point, Burt's character resonates with a certain truism about the male psyche. Man's insatiable appetite for sexual conquests and new adventures. Now, of course, this is not politically correct for the staunch conservatives who swear such thinking and behavior are relegated to those uncultivated individuals who feed off depravity and debauchery. But, behind closed doors there is a different story--human nature.Burt explains his motives in the movie, which pretty much sums up the feelings of many men, which is that for every commitment one makes within a loving relationship, he yearns for the women he hasn't had.  The typical ""Grass being greener on the other side.""  Sometimes art does replicate reality.  Also, the women who are wooed by David Fowler (Reynolds) are multi-dimensional in scope. They all demonstrate a sense of strength while revealing their vulnerabilities.  It's their strength coupled with these vulnerabilities that attract Fowler to them in addition to their physicality.Can a movie made in the early 1980's still be relevant to the changing gender roles of the 2000's?  A lot has changed between men and women within 25 years, but much has remained the same. Through the subtle humor throughout the movie, I challenge viewers to delve into the subliminal messages expressed. It's all there.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute[...]",4,Burt Reynolds Epitomizes Charisma,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1978,"['Man', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Women', 'part', 'comedic-drama', 'part', 'psychological', 'study', 'male', 'female', 'pysche', 'part', 'relationship', 'manual', 'males', 'lacking', 'confidence', 'believe', 'one', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'best', 'movies', 'myriad', 'themes', 'touched', 'movie', 'one', 'image', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'real-life', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'role', 'David', 'Fowler', 'been', 'often', 'stated', 'maybe', 'unfairly', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', ""n't"", 'act', 'movie', 'man', 'so', 'obsessed', 'women', 'literally', 'might', 'be', 'metaphor', 'bigger', 'point', 'Burt', 'character', 'certain', 'truism', 'male', 'psyche', 'Man', 'insatiable', 'appetite', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'new', 'adventures', 'Now', 'course', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'staunch', 'conservatives', 'who', 'swear', 'such', 'thinking', 'behavior', 'are', 'relegated', 'uncultivated', 'individuals', 'who', 'feed', 'off', 'depravity', 'debauchery', 'closed', 'doors', 'different', 'story', 'human', 'nature.Burt', 'motives', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'feelings', 'many', 'men', 'commitment', 'one', 'loving', 'relationship', 'women', ""n't"", 'had', 'typical', 'Grass', 'being', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'Sometimes', 'art', 'replicate', 'reality', 'Also', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'wooed', 'David', 'Fowler', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'multi-dimensional', 'scope', 'demonstrate', 'sense', 'strength', 'revealing', 'vulnerabilities', 'strength', 'coupled', 'vulnerabilities', 'attract', 'Fowler', 'addition', 'physicality.Can', 'movie', 'made', 'early', '1980', 'still', 'be', 'relevant', 'changing', 'gender', 'roles', '2000', 'lot', 'changed', 'men', 'women', '25', 'years', 'much', 'remained', 'same', 'subtle', 'humor', 'movie', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'delve', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'expressed', 'there.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Image', 'Charisma', 'Institute', '[', ']']",N/A
