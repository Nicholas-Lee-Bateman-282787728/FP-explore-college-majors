500710,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B00000FZL2,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","Control begins with the apparent death of murderer Lee Ray Oliver (Ray Liotta) by lethal injection. We quickly learn, however, that the execution was staged so Lee Ray can be used as a test subject for Anagress, an experimental drug used to suppress people's violent behaviors. The caveat? Anagress's side effects are unknown and could prove deadly.So Control goes. The story is an interesting one, and we witness Lee Ray's progression on-screen under the supervision of Dr. Copeland (Willem Dafoe) with intrigue. The problem with Control is that the script is weak, and not just in an it-could-have-been-better sort of way. It is painfully bad at times, especially in the latter half of the movie. For one, the security guards at the testing facility are so lackadaisical and inept in every single way that the viewer begins to question why they're even around; literally every time something goes wrong in Control it is due to their idiocy. Even worse, Lee Ray becomes incredibly boring once Anagress takes effect. Ray Liotta has never been an outstanding actor, but he did all he could with what he was given. Even Willem Dafoe, someone I would consider to be an exceptional actor, comes across as forced in some scenes, which to me is clear evidence the script is to blame for Control's shortcomings.As another reviewer has said, Control is a tale of two Lee Rays: bad Lee Ray, and good Lee Ray. The night-to-day shift is too sudden and never really strikes the viewer as believable. Moreover, ""good"" Lee Ray is so docile at times he almost seems childlike. Because of this, the revelation at the end of the film ends up being far too fantastical to be taken seriously. There are other problems with Control (the ultra-hokey hitman), but most of them can be traced back to the lousy writing. I'm ok with movies that stretch believability, but I have no tolerance for movies that ask me to be stupid. Control is one of those movies.

500711,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00000FZL2,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 2]","An action/thriller movie, ""Control"" is an entertaining film that follows a young guy who just got off death row with the condition that he volunteer to take part in a test experiment for a new drug. This new drug makes a person feel guilty for past actions and makes them more mellow and non- violent. What better place to test it than at a death- row prison?Ray Liotta plays the main part in this movie, and he is quite good. He is violent and unpredictable, and you never know what he will do next. One second, he seems like he is losing his violent nature, presumably because the doctor, played by Willem Dafoe, has succeeded with his recipe for this special medicine. Then, out of nowhere, he flips out and goes on a violent rampage, striking everyone around him with his bare fists.Control is suspenseful and fun. You keep guessing what will happen at the end, and you will likely guess incorrectly. Will the medicine successfully make this former murderer change his ways and become a productive member of society? Or will the ex- killer resume a life of crime once he hits the streets. You don't really know until the movie is near completion.Not everything about this movie is perfect, and it's certainly not the best of its genre available on DVD. But it is still a good movie, and it's one that has received very little coverage. I didn't even know it existed until I saw a notice of newly released DVD. I never saw a preview for it or heard anything on television about it. It is a basically obscure title, even though it's only a few months old.Overall, Control is a good film, and most people will at least appreciate its originality and its unpredictability. It's no substitute for some of the great action films, but it is still pretty good, with solid, convincing performances from Liotta and Dafoe.",4,A Former Death Row Killer is Out of Control,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,1815,"['action/thriller', 'movie', 'Control', 'entertaining', 'film', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'death', 'row', 'condition', 'take', 'part', 'test', 'experiment', 'new', 'drug', 'new', 'drug', 'person', 'feel', 'guilty', 'past', 'actions', 'more', 'mellow', 'non-', 'violent', 'What', 'better', 'place', 'test', 'death-', 'row', 'prison', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'main', 'part', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'violent', 'unpredictable', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'One', 'second', 'losing', 'violent', 'nature', 'presumably', 'doctor', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'succeeded', 'recipe', 'special', 'medicine', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'out', 'violent', 'rampage', 'striking', 'everyone', 'bare', 'fists.Control', 'suspenseful', 'fun', 'keep', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'will', 'likely', 'guess', 'incorrectly', 'Will', 'medicine', 'successfully', 'make', 'former', 'murderer', 'change', 'ways', 'become', 'productive', 'member', 'society', 'will', 'ex-', 'killer', 'resume', 'life', 'crime', 'streets', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'movie', 'completion.Not', 'everything', 'movie', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'genre', 'available', 'DVD', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'received', 'very', 'little', 'coverage', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'saw', 'notice', 'newly', 'released', 'DVD', 'never', 'saw', 'preview', 'heard', 'anything', 'television', 'basically', 'obscure', 'title', 'even', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'old.Overall', 'Control', 'good', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'least', 'appreciate', 'originality', 'unpredictability', 'substitute', 'great', 'action', 'films', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'solid', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Liotta', 'Dafoe']",Control

They both are really good in this movie.Ray Liotta plays a death-row inmate who is given a second chance by a Pharmicuetical company, who has their scientist played by Willem Dafoe, give Liotta drugs to chance his personality and turn him from being a criminal into being a ""nice guy"".The story line and script were really great. I thought the concept of the story was fascinating. This story would have made an outstanding psycological thriller. But it was kind of a cross between a thriller and an action movie.The only thing that got to me was the age differences between the actors and actresses. For example, Ray Liotta is 50. Michelle Rodriguez is 27, and I felt to young to play his love interest. I hate when movies do this. Maybe they were trying to appeal to the younger male crowd and not only did they add the car chases, but they chose a young actress.

Just watch this movie then!

This drug is supposed to be able to transform criminals, making them feel pity and remorse about what they've done. From one day to the next, this criminal is changing, crying, and is nice. He is put out in the real world to see how he will manage. What will hapeen? Well, you'll just have to find out! The ending is great and a good exclamation point on a great movie. The movie also happens to have its touching moments that made me think...a lot. It goes into the head of a psycho, and shows his human side. Why did he become who he did? This movie gives all the explanations, explanations probably true for most people like this one.Well, for a different movie with an original plot (similiar in originality to Unforgettable's) and a good leading performance, with some good thrills and even sweet moments, check this unheard of movie out.",5,Great movie,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,1650,"['movie', 'probably', ""n't"", 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'unheard', 'movie', 'only', 'picked', 'up', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'now', 'rare', 'mean', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'HEARD', 'OF', 'unheard', 'director', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'Barely', 'ever', 'Control', 'thriller', 'highly', 'creative', 'plot', 'seriously', 'awesome', 'acting', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'was', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Just', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'Watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'especially', 'when', 'playing', 'thta', 'video', 'game', 'blowing', 'away', 'cops.The', 'movie', 'criminal', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'convicted', 'numerous', 'murders', 'who', 'instead', 'beeing', 'put', 'death', 'able', 'be', 'one', 'tests', 'new', 'drug', 'proposed', 'doctor', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'drug', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'transform', 'criminals', 'making', 'feel', 'pity', 'remorse', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'criminal', 'changing', 'crying', 'nice', 'put', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'see', 'how', 'will', 'manage', 'What', 'will', 'hapeen', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'ending', 'great', 'good', 'exclamation', 'point', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'touching', 'moments', 'made', 'think', 'lot', 'head', 'psycho', 'human', 'side', 'Why', 'did', 'become', 'who', 'did', 'movie', 'explanations', 'explanations', 'probably', 'true', 'most', 'people', 'one.Well', 'different', 'movie', 'original', 'plot', 'similiar', 'originality', 'Unforgettable', 'good', 'leading', 'performance', 'good', 'thrills', 'even', 'sweet', 'moments', 'check', 'unheard', 'movie']",Control

Modern pharmacology is the catalyst which turns violent career criminal and sociopath Lee Ray Olivier, (Ray Liotta), into a relatively normal human being, who understands the difference between right and wrong, and is capable of feeling remorse. Consider the implications if this kind of medication, proven effective, could be made available in some distant future. How would this effect violent crime?Mr. Oliver believes he is being executed by lethal injection for his crimes. He shouts four-letter epithets at the witnesses as the fluid enters his bloodstream. When he awakens, however, he is not in Hell - he is alive, lying on a slab at the city morgue. Short and sweet - he is told that, if he is willing to be a test subject for a new medication, he could have a second chance at life. Otherwise, the execution will continue right there, in the morgue, immediately. The little yellow pills alter the brains chemistry, suppress violent tendencies and reduce aggression. What's he got to lose?Dr. Miles Copeland, (William DeFoe), is a neuropharmacologist and the designer of the miracle drug he believes, if taken regularly, with appropriate supervision, can turn a brutal sociopath into an average citizen. There's lots of explosive violence, (Liotta is a master at portraying rage), until his brain chemistry is finally altered. Then the noticeable difference in the man is mind-boggling.Phase two of the experiment has Oliver out on the street, with an apartment and job of his own, a monitoring device locked on his ankle, camera's in every room, and a surveillance van outside the front door. Through a series of ""unforeseeable events,"" he is forced to run, although his heart and soul are with the program. I don't want to give anything away...so I will stop here. But there are some twists and turns that even I did not see coming.There are a lot of problems with this movie, but all-in-all, I liked it. I was certainly riveted to the screen. One is asked to suspend belief, and accept the premise that the state and federal government would turn loose a maniac criminal after only 12 weeks of treatment - just meds, no psychotherapy even. Then we wonder how ""the unforeseeable"" was not foreseen. These guys, a combo of FBI and police, along with the drug company goons, are supposed to be professionals! On the other hand, Liotta does a fabulous job of making his character a sympathetic figure, especially after the super violent beginning. I always like Willem DeFoe, and he is excellent as the idealistic doctor who wants to make a positive contribution to human life. There are some excellent action scenes and the suspense is chilling.

Perhaps so if this conversion is chemically induced.  That's the premise of this well done thriller.  Ray Liotta does a smashup job as a convicted killer whose execution is staged in order for him to become a guinea pig in an experiment by Willem Dafoe (who is excellent as well).  ALthough initially the drug doesn't seem to be working, in time, Liotta expresses remorse over the shooting of a young innocent bystander who subsequently became little more than a child after the brain injury.  Convinced of Liotta's redemption, Dafoe releases him and gets him started on a whole new life, including a romance with his spunky co-worker (well played by Michelle Rodriguez.)  Of course, it isn't long before external factors seem to propel Liotta into a life of crime.  This includes the vengeful brother of the man Liotta wounded.Crisply directed by Tim Hunter and propelled by Liotta's performance, CONTROL has some surprising twists at the end that answer the question of the conversion.",4,CAN EVIL TURN GOOD?,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,1124,"['CONTROL', 'question', 'not', 'sociopathic', 'criminal', 'can', 'do', 'complete', 'turnaround', 'become', 'useful', 'member', 'society', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'conversion', 'chemically', 'induced', 'premise', 'well', 'done', 'thriller', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'smashup', 'job', 'convicted', 'killer', 'execution', 'staged', 'order', 'become', 'guinea', 'pig', 'experiment', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'ALthough', 'initially', 'drug', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'time', 'Liotta', 'remorse', 'shooting', 'young', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'who', 'subsequently', 'became', 'little', 'more', 'child', 'brain', 'injury', 'Convinced', 'Liotta', 'redemption', 'Dafoe', 'started', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'including', 'romance', 'spunky', 'co-worker', 'well', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'course', ""n't"", 'long', 'external', 'factors', 'seem', 'propel', 'Liotta', 'life', 'crime', 'vengeful', 'brother', 'man', 'Liotta', 'wounded.Crisply', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Hunter', 'propelled', 'Liotta', 'performance', 'CONTROL', 'surprising', 'twists', 'end', 'question', 'conversion']",Control

When he wakes up again inside the morgue, things get weird for him.  Dr Michael Copeland (the fantastic Willem DaFoe), a Neuro-pharmacologist, is in the final stages of testing his newest drug - on humans.  Oliver is offered a chance to participate or go through his execution for real.  He agrees, but he's far from the perfect patient.At first he's atrociously violent, attacking guards and attempting escapes, but gradually the drug begins to work.  Oliver's tattoos are removed, preparing him for the final test - a normal life in public.  Dr. Copeland's dream is to take a violent offender and turn them into an average, everyday Joe.  Copeland makes sure Oliver knows, ""You're only alive because of me.""  Gradually, Oliver calms down and begins to exhibit rational thought.Released to work and live in a normal environment while wearing an ankle bracelet, Oliver meets Teresa (Michelle Rodriquez) and they become friendly.  But, can a sociopath actually become an empathetic person?  Can a conscience develop if it wasn't present before?  This movie has quite a few twists to it that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  Ray Liotta's transformation from the murderous killer to the pacifist is a landmark in his acting career, one of his best performances ever.While not as violent or graphic as 'Strangeland', another film of experimental pacification of monstrous personality disorders, 'Control' is still a very good movie.

500728,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00000FZL2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","'Control' begins with a great opening, and poses a very intriguing question -- Can we save someone's soul with medicine?  Can we make someone, say, a convict in Death Row come to truly regret his past deeds, and wish to start a new life by giving him some small pills?  And what if the two leads are played by two character actors Ray Liotta and Willem Dafoe?Sadly this interestng story is fatally damaged by the awfully muddled script.  Yes, the opening section is brilliant.  Ray Liotta is Lee Ray Oliver, convict sentenced to death, waiting for the time to be executed, and we are closely watching the last moments of his life.But someone, or some medical company offer an unexpected help.  If Lee Ray agrees to receive the medical tests for the new medicine they are working on, he will be secretly transported to their labo where they are doing research for the effects and side-effects.  The immediate manager of the experiments is one Dr. Copeland (Dafoe), who is hired by the company's more powerful superior played by Stephen Rea.  In addition to Liotta, Dafoe, and Rae, Michelle Rodriguez and Polly Walker join the cast.The film is fairly strong in the first half, but in the second it gets confusing and even pointless at times.  The biggest problem is the role of Lee Ray, whose character is too flat to take his seriouly.  Casting Liotta works to some extent, for he could be very unpredictable with ease (like in 'NARC'), but in this film his character undergoes changes too suddenly -- it looks as if we are watching two movies, one with bad Ray and the other with good Ray.However, these things could have been much less harmful if Tim Hunter refused to rely on the typical B-action formula (and this was in fact shot in Bulgaria, land of B-movie location).  Russian mafioso sends out a killer who looks exactly like a hitman that Lee Ray can spot him in the crowd.  The company's black suits, while they are supposed to be watching Lee Ray, lose sight of him simply because ... they couldn't find the parking space.  And as to the two ladies, they have nothing to do except that they provide slightest romantic flavor to the story, which could stand on its own without these hackneyed stories.The name of Tim Hunter might remind some viewers of his 'River's Edge,' but his direction here is that of forgettable straight-to-video films, which 'Contol' is actually is.
