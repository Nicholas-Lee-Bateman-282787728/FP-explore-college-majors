I mean, in the very first episode alone there's a marriage on the rocks, a child given up for adoption eight years earlier, a slutty sister-in-law, a meddling mother-in-law, infidelity, a lingerie model (named Chardonnay, no less!), a fight, a coma, a cocaine habit and frontal male nudity!  How's that grab ya?As the episodes progress, you'll witness even more shocking sights including what has to be the *tackiest* wedding ever (and that dress!) as well as one totally messed-up outrageous nurse.  Your jaw will drop as you witness what this woman is capable of!This show more than makes up for all those years of snooty Masterpiece Theater the UK's been sending our way.And I must thank whoever had enough sense to include subtitles on this DVD!

898410,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0008EN6KO,Doctor Trance,"[19, 20]","I stumbled across this first season set, having never seen it, and thought it was similar to Coupling.  I took a chance and what I found that while very unlike Coupling, it had it's own style that keeps you watching.  This is primarily a drama, but it does have it's share of laugh out loud scenes.Every one of the 8 episodes on Season 1 has all sorts of scenarios and crazy new things developing.  The one thing I just noticed after watching it all, that except for maybe Donna and Ian's son that they originally gave up, there are really no innocent, completely likable characters. I mean someone is usually ending up cheating, lying, or deceiving someone else!  No one, and I mean no one is anywhere near sainthood in this one!This close knit team and their families is a very interesting watch, with spot on performance by every actor in their roles.  The German Team Manager use to play Alistair in As Time Goes By and was very funny in that.  While he takes on a more serious role in this, he is again completely fun to watch.  The actress who played Judi Dench's daughter in As Time Goes By also makes an appearance as a physician.All the characters get into so many heated confrontations, deceptions, and flirtations, you have to just keep watching and watching to see what will develop.

898413,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B0008EN6KO,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[5, 5]","Footballers Wives has become one of my favorite television shows to rent since I don't have cable.  It has everything you could want in a cheesy soap opera: sex, drugs, promiscuity, depression, family problems, etc.  The characters in this British comedy are shameless and over the top and it's hard to gauge what they'll do next.  This show takes no prisoners and if you liked the late years of Melrose Place with a bit of NBC's Passions and a hint of Desperate Housewives, this is definitely the show for you.The show focuses on the members of the Earls Park football team and their wives.  The couples are:Jason and Tanya: Jason is the team's captain, and Tanya is his wife (therefore the most important person as far as the women are concerned).  Jason and Tanya's relationship is volatile and hanging on by a thread, but neither one of them will do anything about it.  Instead, Jason is consistently unfaithful and Tanya drowns her sorrows in booze and cocaine.Kyle and Chardonnay: Kyle is one of the team's rising stars and he is engaged to the beautiful Page Three-model (basically topless pictures) Chardonnay Lane.  Theirs is a fairy tale romance and Chardonnay has every intention of making that known with her over-the-top Cinderella wedding theme.Ian and Donna: Ian is Earls Park's newest striker and he's on his best behavior to fit in well with the team.  He's been with his wife Donna since they were teenagers, and they have two children to show for it.  The problem is that their first child was given up for adoption and Donna can't stop thinking about him.  This puts Ian in an awkward position because they were just kids then and he just wants to be happy with the success they've garnered after all this time.A few of the single, and more infamous, characters on the show include Kyle's mother Jackie who constantly nags Chardonnay and still lives at home with her son, Donna's sister Marie who fancies herself in love with Jason and will stop at nothing to get him, and newest Earls Park member Salvatore Biagi who everyone is afraid will step in and take Jason's spot on the team.This show is addictive and if you give it a shot, it won't take long for you to become hooked.

Hebbron ""S B H.""","[2, 3]","The whole point of footballer's wives is extreme in all happenings and such witty, critical, parody of the bizarre modern culture of the overpaid British footballer's (soccer player's) life.The series is at once, searingly accurate and achingly sarcastic. It's insanely addictive and abounds with beautiful people. A super, no holes barred, bitch, sex, drugs and rock and roll fest.There is a whole host of characters who mirror trashy B,C and Dlist UK celebs to, almost litigoius, perfection.Page three topless model/bimbo's, self interested, no brain, players, psychopathic managers, social climbers, schemers and uber bithces!All the cast are fabulous but look out in particular for the pretty and witless ""Chardonnay"" and the bitch of all bitches ""Tanya"", the latter performs like Joan Collins in Dynasty with a spalsh of evil, a dash of menace and a shed load of energy.

This is an excellent trashy and soapy tv show,  there is no way they would make a show like this in the U.S ,  British tv  is far more provocative than in the U.S (except cable ). In the series  there's nudity , foul language , funny and completely disturbed characters and lots of plots and  twists. Don't get turned off by the  football in the title , there's not much of football in there, I hate football myself,too bad there's only 9 episodes per season , but believe me a lot is happening in every episode so I suggest you to order the rest of the seasons from amazon.co.uk!
