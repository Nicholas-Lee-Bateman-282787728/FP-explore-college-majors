1158383,AXJTNYD3UK1BP,B00180OU7U,"1smileycat ""1smileycat""","[0, 0]","""Alice Upside Down"" was an enjoyable movie.  Alyson Stoner plays Alice, who lost her mother 6 years ago (I don't believe the movie indicates how or why her mother died.)  The movie is about Alice and her family (her brother Lester played by Lucas Grabeel, and her father played by Luke Perry) who have just moved to a new city because their father purchased a music store there.Alice is the new girl in 6th grade and doesn't have the best of luck, like her older brother does, making new friends and a perfect new life.  She gets the ""mean"" teacher, played by Penny Marshall, and learns life lessons along the way as her and her teacher grow closer.Alice's mother had a beautiful singing voice, which must mean that Alice does too, right? Alice learns the answer while trying out for the lead part in the school musical.The movie is entertaining with all of Alice's mis-adventures, but has a very real feel to it while it deals with real-life matters surrounding the loss of Alice's mother.  I even found myself in tears a couple of times!  While I enjoyed the movie, it definitely has some heavy life lessons in it.I recommend this movie, as long as there are parents watching it with their kids, to help explain some of the lessons it teaches.-1smileycat :-)",4,Good movie!,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,1260,"['Alice', 'Upside', 'Down', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Alice', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'how', 'why', 'mother', 'died', 'movie', 'Alice', 'family', 'brother', 'Lester', 'played', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'father', 'played', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'city', 'father', 'purchased', 'music', 'store', 'there.Alice', 'new', 'girl', '6th', 'grade', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'luck', 'older', 'brother', 'making', 'new', 'friends', 'perfect', 'new', 'life', 'mean', 'teacher', 'played', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'life', 'lessons', 'way', 'teacher', 'grow', 'closer.Alice', 'mother', 'had', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'must', 'mean', 'Alice', 'too', 'right', 'Alice', 'answer', 'trying', 'out', 'lead', 'part', 'school', 'musical.The', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'Alice', 'mis-adventures', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'real-life', 'matters', 'surrounding', 'loss', 'Alice', 'mother', 'even', 'found', 'tears', 'couple', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'definitely', 'heavy', 'life', 'lessons', 'it.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'parents', 'watching', 'kids', 'help', 'explain', 'lessons', 'teaches.-1smileycat']",Alice Upside Down

I haven't read any of the books, but the movie follows the ""tween"" girl-power formula popularized by the likes of Hannah Montana and any number of Disney-style adolescent comedies.Among the well-worn cliches (boys are either icky or hot, single dad Luke Perry fumbles through cooking a Thanksgiving dinner), the best thing about ALICE is Alice herself, played with believable awkwardness by Alyson Stoner.High School Musical (Encore Edition)'s Lucas Grabeel is fine as Alice's older brother, and Penny Marshall is the reputed meanest teacher in the sixth grade.

1158387,A3U2REB8VQ6RHY,B00180OU7U,"Amy Tiemann ""aka Mojo Mom""","[0, 0]","""Alice Upside Down"" is the movie version ofThe Agony of Alice,the first book in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's popular series.  I had not read the book but I watched the DVD with a girl who vouched that the movie true to the story.Alice is starting sixth grade as the new kid at school.  Her mother has been dead for years, so Alice is looking for a female role model to guide her through adolescence.  Her widowed Dad and older brother are sweet but have their own issues.  At school, Alice finds a mentor where she least expects it.The movie plays a bit like ""Junior High School Musical"" at times, given that Alice is trying out for Drama Club and her brother is played by Lucas Grabeel (Ryan fromHigh School Musical).  But this movie is refreshingly real and down to Earth.  The issues are centered on the genuine agony of feeling that you don't belong, and that everything you touch turns into an embarrassing mess--and worst of all, thinking you are the only one who feels that way.  No one in the movie is a true villain, and Alice makes her own share of mistakes such as spreading gossip without really meaning to.  Alice is shown in fantasy sequences that show the difference between how she sees herself and how others see a situation--a cute way to illustrate that stage that all sixth-graders and most American Idol auditioners seem to go through.Actress Alyson Stoner does a great job as Alice.  She's all dressed up in the movie poster, but her Alice is a realistic kid.  Lucas Grabeel's role as the brother is definitely more than a cameo.  Though I personally didn't need to see him play his guitar with his shirt off in the band ""The Naked Nomads,"" that might be a plus for some fans.Finally, when I saw Luke Perry on the DVD case I thought maybe he'd play a cool teacher.  Imagine my shock that he was the Dad.  Yes, GenX parents reading this review, we're officially old.  (Guess that happens fast to a guy who played a high schooler onBeverly Hills, 90210well into his 20's.)I would recommend Alice Upside Down for 9 to 12 year olds.

1158388,A2FS9CYCWC6HLW,B00180OU7U,"Anna M. Ligtenberg ""AnnaLovesBooks""","[0, 0]","ASIN B00180OU7U - I'm not much of a movie fan and am always more likely to choose a Disney flick than anything else.  Alice Upside Down sounded like a good fit for me and the fact that it's tied to a book series is an added attraction.  I watched it with a nine year old girl, just in case there were things I was simply too old to understand; besides, watching kids' movies with kids is always more amusing.Alice is in middle school, which is a pretty insecure place to be to begin with - it's made worse by the fact that she seems to be compiling a stunning list of embarrassing moments and she's got THE nightmare homeroom teacher in Mrs. Plotkin.  From the first day, things are not looking good and Alice copes by living a rich fantasy life in which she is, of course, popular - and not at all the embarrassing moments queen she seems to feel destined to be.Moms will probably enjoy getting to see Luke Perry... or maybe it'll make them feel suddenly old.  I think the casting there was great, since most parents of 11 year old girls now were close to that age when Perry was at the height of his heart-throbbiness; it's hard to watch the movie and not remember who you were back then, making it easy to relate to Alice and, through her, to your own daughter.  Unlike many currently and recently popular movies for the age group, where kids lack manners, have a tendency to spew swear words as if they were born truck drivers, and the stories tend to revolve around more grown-up themes, Alice Upside Down strikes me as a realistic look at the life of a middle school aged girl who's going to turn out fine - if she doesn't just die of embarrassment first.My nine year old viewing companion absolutely loved the movie and thinks my 4 stars is insufficient.  (I'm taking one away because DVDs usually come with some good ""extras"" and I'm not seeing that here.)  She hadn't read any Alice books, but she's eager to now - a major positive!  Any movie that leads a kid to put their nose in a book is a fine thing.-AnnaLovesBooks",4,Alice Upside Down,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,2029,"['ASIN', 'B00180OU7U', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'fan', 'am', 'always', 'more', 'likely', 'choose', 'Disney', 'flick', 'anything', 'else', 'Alice', 'Upside', 'Down', 'sounded', 'good', 'fit', 'fact', 'tied', 'book', 'series', 'added', 'attraction', 'watched', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'just', 'case', 'were', 'things', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'old', 'understand', 'besides', 'watching', 'kids', 'movies', 'kids', 'always', 'more', 'amusing.Alice', 'middle', 'school', 'pretty', 'insecure', 'place', 'be', 'begin', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'be', 'compiling', 'stunning', 'list', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'got', 'THE', 'nightmare', 'homeroom', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkin', 'first', 'day', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'good', 'Alice', 'copes', 'living', 'rich', 'fantasy', 'life', 'course', 'popular', 'not', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'queen', 'feel', 'destined', 'be.Moms', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'see', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'make', 'feel', 'suddenly', 'old', 'think', 'casting', 'there', 'was', 'great', 'most', 'parents', '11', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'now', 'were', 'close', 'age', 'when', 'Perry', 'was', 'height', 'heart-throbbiness', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'making', 'easy', 'relate', 'Alice', 'own', 'daughter', 'many', 'currently', 'recently', 'popular', 'movies', 'age', 'group', 'where', 'kids', 'lack', 'manners', 'have', 'tendency', 'spew', 'swear', 'words', 'were', 'born', 'truck', 'drivers', 'stories', 'tend', 'revolve', 'more', 'grown-up', 'themes', 'Alice', 'Upside', 'Down', 'strikes', 'realistic', 'look', 'life', 'middle', 'school', 'aged', 'girl', 'who', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'fine', ""n't"", 'just', 'die', 'embarrassment', 'first.My', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'viewing', 'companion', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'thinks', '4', 'stars', 'insufficient', ""'m"", 'taking', 'one', 'away', 'DVDs', 'usually', 'come', 'good', 'extras', ""'m"", 'not', 'seeing', 'here', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Alice', 'books', 'eager', 'now', 'major', 'positive', 'movie', 'kid', 'put', 'nose', 'book', 'fine', 'thing.-AnnaLovesBooks']",Alice Upside Down

Geared at 6th graders, it shows the emotional tribulations of Alice, the new girl at school. Alice's mother died when she was five, so she has no real role models other than her aunt and struggling father. When the family has to move, she feels even more out of place. Clinging to the hope that she'll be able to learn from a 'cool' teacher at school, Alice learns that sometimes the best role models are the last people you'd think of. Penny Marshall is fantastic as the tough teacher, Mrs. Plotkins. Though a talented director, I also love seeing her in acting roles.

1158395,A3FXT4UPI30K7S,B00180OU7U,"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author""","[1, 1]","Teen actress Alyson Stoner (Cheaper by the Dozen),  portrays Alice McKinley in ""Alice Upside Down,"" a young girl whose life is disrupted when her father moves her and her brother to a new town a few years after her mother has died. Luke Perry (Beverly Hills 90210) plays Alice's father, Ben McKinley, and Lucas Grabeel (High School Musical) plays her brother, Lester, in a movie that feels a lot like a Disney made-for-TV special. While most of Alice's problems stem from the fact that she has been struggling to figure out how best to behave like a lady without much in the way of a female role model since her mother died several years earlier, she is also unusually challenged by innate clumsiness and tone deafness.The joy of watching Alice come to terms with each setback and embarrassment is what makes ""Alice Upside Down"" most fun, and young girls will enjoy the vicarious thrill of seeing someone so smart and pretty bumbling through the kinds of situations that most of us run into much more than we'd like in adolescence. Some of the issues dealt with in ""Alice Upside Down"" feel heavy at times, as Alice confronts her father about his difficulty integrating poignant memories of the past (in the form of old home movies and pictures of his wife) with the new life he's building in the new house and town.While the main story line of how Alice can develop her sense of identity in a new town even when things seem to keep going wrong is fairly good, there are some choppy aspects to ""Alice Upside Down.""  The movie's frequent use of voice-over narrative in which Alice looks and speaks directly to the camera kept reminding me that this is ""just a movie,"" and the character development seemed a bit flat and two-dimensional. I would have loved to know more about the other characters than this movie showed... such as why Alice's dad started dating and then suddenly stopped, for example.One of the strong points of ""Alice Upside Down"" is that the actors are fabulous and the cast is strong enough to really hold viewer interest, so even predictable plot development and a made-for-TV vibe didn't dissuade me from watching the movie all the way through to the end. I really loved seeing Penny Marshall playing the role of Mrs. Plotkin, Alice's teacher, and I loved the heart-warming ending of the film in which Alice gained an appreciation for true friends in unexpected places.I recommend this movie for fans of Alyson Stoner, Luke Perry, Lucas Grabeel, and Penny Marshall... and young girls who can handle a movie that deals with serious issues of mortality (death and illness).",4,How to Enjoy Life...

And dis-organized too!Alice frequently reverts in her mind to fairy tale scenes of how she hopes things will turn out.  Problem is, reality tends to not match her fantasy world. Sadly, her mother has passed away, and she only has her father Ben to lean on - at least @ first.  {Ben is played by Luke Perry;  seems like just yesterday he was young enough to portray a HS student inBeverly Hills, 90210 - The Complete First Season& now he is playing the father of a girl in Jr High}We all feel for Alice in her pitfalls because, truth be told, we've all been there.  When I was about her age, I tried out for the basketball team.  I was mortified when I found out that I was on the last string!  Her's is the age where we begin to figure out that life has a tendency not to work out the way we think it will or want it to.

But then he turns around and rejects the advances of a successful former classmate because he has ""too much on his plate."" Huh? Perhaps the most endearing character is big brother Lester.

These dream sequences contrast with Stoner's stumbles as a regular teen trying to fit in.  The acting is pretty good which makes the movie stomach-able for adults.  Stoner is really charming, her brother is believable and her father (played by Luke Perry) does a decent job in the role.  Penny Marshall appears also as a school teacher with an attitude.  Pre-teens will be satisfied by Alice Upside Down's charm and fun.",4,Fun movie for pre-teens,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,863,"['Alice', 'upside', 'down', 'charming', 'kids', 'movie', 'parents', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'kids', 'movie', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'misfit', 'pre-teen', 'moving', 'new', 'town', 'entering', 'new', 'school', 'Alyson', 'deals', 'insecurities', 'imagining', 'actually', 'cool', 'girl', 'movie', 'imaginary', 'sequences', 'where', 'Stoner', 'be', 'seen', 'cool', 'clothes', 'witty', 'comebacks', 'entourage', 'friends', 'dream', 'sequences', 'contrast', 'Stoner', 'stumbles', 'regular', 'teen', 'trying', 'fit', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'stomach-able', 'adults', 'Stoner', 'really', 'charming', 'brother', 'believable', 'father', 'played', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'also', 'school', 'teacher', 'attitude', 'Pre-teens', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Alice', 'Upside', 'Down', 'charm', 'fun']",Alice Upside Down

The movie's main character, Alice, is actually a creation by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor - one of my favorite writers. In the books, the Alice series ranges from readers 9 - 13 and others from 14 and up. Alice in Alice Upside Down is eleven years of age. She lost her mother at age five. It's been rough and she's always felt like she doesn't fit in. Even so, Alice remains optimistic that things will turn out.Her, her father and her brother move to a new house and start all over. Alice is thrown into a new school to find her way. And she does, just not exactly how she envisions it. This movie will have you laughing and in some parts, a little sad.Alyson Stoner did a great job as Alice McKinley, but the one who shined the brightest was Lucas Grabeel as Lester McKinley. Penny Marshall, another actor who could do no wrong in my book - ever, played Mrs. Plotkin. The actor to surprise me was Luke Perry. Remember 90210, the long-running popular primetime television drama series that aired from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000? Remember Luke Perry? He plays Ben McKinley, Alice's father.It's a great cast of characters and I found the movie a delight. My daughter, age eleven, loved it too.

1158408,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00180OU7U,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[9, 12]","""Alice Upside Down,"" based on the ""Alice"" series of books from Phyllis Reynolds Naylor explores the ups and downs of being a pre-teen girl.  Alyson Stoner (""Camp Rock,"" ""Mike's Super Short Show"") portrays Alice McKinley, a young girl who's mother died when she was five and has grown up with her big brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel of ""High School Musical"") under the guidance of their widowed father, Ben (Luke Perry, ""Jeremiah,"" ""Eight Seconds,"" ""Beverly Hills, 90210"").Moving into a new town can be tough for a young girl, especially if she's a tomboy with a wild imagination.  Alice feels that she can't do anything right and always seems to end up in embarassing situations.  She dislikes her new teacher, has a tough time making friends and doesn't understand why girls think her brother is cute.  Lester seems to have adjusted to his new home quite nicely.  He's in a band, has a few girls after him and his grades are decent enough.  Ben has also adjusted to his new digs.  His music shop is a success and he's started a relationship with an old friend.While this sounds like a typical Disney Channel or Nickelodeon film, there are some tough issues that are addressed.  Ben struggles with the loss of his wife.  He also battles his relatives over how to properly bring up his children.  Alice deals with all of the normal problems that face young teens and pre-teens, but her mother's death weighs heavy on her as well.  She is desperate to fit in, but her male-driven upbringing makes her stick out like a sore thumb.  She also has a problem of forming an opinion of people before actually getting to know them.  This especially comes into play when a supposed villain becomes a best friend.The cast is excellent.  The youngsters in the film do a fine job.  There's a slight ""Babysitters Club"" vibe running through the whole picture, and they convey this with ease.  Two of the adults should be easily recognized.  One is the aforementioned Perry and the other is the wonderful director/actress Penny Marshall.  Marshall's role is a bit limited, but her character is key to the development of the story.What's best about this film is the fact that the adults face up to their problems without the usual ""all is lost"" mentality.  The kids act like kids, and respond as expected.  Alice does act a bit older than she really is, but she's the voice of reason for the young audience.  She actually gives some solid advice to younger viewers.This DVD comes with two brief and very unnecessary interviews with Stoner and Grabeel.  They basically answer questions culled from the pages of ""Bop"" and ""Tiger Beat.""  Also included is a brief featurette on the many costumes that Alice dons during the film and trailers for upcoming films.While the heavier issues in this film might be depressing, this film is primarily lighter fare.  The bond between Ben and his children is nice to see on film and I'm glad that teachers are shown in a positive light.  Also, the kids aren't strung out on drugs or having sex every five minutes.Overall, ""Alice Upside Down"" is a positive film about dealing with day-to-day issues for junior high kids.  It's not the most moving film out there and the humor is primarily geared towards the pre-teen set, but your entire family should enjoy this film.

Having lost their mother years before, Alice and her teenage brother Lester are being raised by their father, Ben. Together, they've moved to a new town where Ben owns a music store and Alice will be starting junior high. The film takes us through Alice's first semester as a 6th grader as she deals with her constant feelings of inadequacy, making friends, her father's return to dating, a new teacher she idolizes and another she has misjudged.""Alice Upside Down"" is, not surprisingly, based on a book series aimed at preteens and written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. The movie plays out just that way, too. It doesn't really tell a specific story, but rather follows the lead character through a portion of her life for the benefit of viewers who might relate to her feelings and experiences. For me, that works a bit better as a TV series than a movie. It CAN work for movies, but I think it would require more exciting experiences to do so. ""Alice Upside Down"" is successfully realistic (for the most part) and probably would work well for its very specific target audience of 6th grade girls, if they don't find it too drab, but I think as an overall ""family film"" it falls a little short, or at least wouldn't serve well for more than one viewing. To achieve the level of seriousness the film shoots for, it has to sacrifice the liveliness and cutesiness that made Lizzie McGuire (the series) so charming, so I'm not even sure most 11 and 12 year olds will be captivated by it. In addition, I just never found the lead character of Alice to be very likeable. At times she is a sympathetic character, but not really as often as she should be. Alice is a character who gets herself into trouble, and in the silliest ways, and though she is constantly embarrassing herself or being embarrassed by others, she never seems as believably mortified as the aforementioned Lizzie would, despite cowering a lot. And while I and surely others will appreciate that Alice is less snooty and sassy than most characters in kids' movies or shows, kids kind of are like that nowadays, so I'm not sure I'd say that adds to the realism any.Disney Channel alumni Alyson Stoner and Lucas Grabeel star as Alice and her big brother Lester, Luke Perry (of TV's Beverly Hills 90210) plays their dad, Penny Marshall is the underappreciated Mrs. Plotkin, and Ashley Eckstein the adored and adorable Miss Cole. The acting is actually very good all around, though I have to be honest and say that Allyson Stoner doesn't really have the spark to draw me into her world. Not as bad as that dreadful young actress on Nickelodeon who can't seem to convey emotion (I'll let you guess who I'm talking about), but still not appealing enough for me to care for her Alice character in the moments that aren't tearjerkers over mother-loss or what have you. By the way, she does that thing where she talks directly to the audience in this film, and I really don't think it works here or is necessary at all. Lucas Grabeel does a pretty good job at playing the opposite of his High School Musical character here, and I'm sure both those Disney actors will draw loyal Disney Channel fans. I'm a little more old-school Disney myself, only liking a very small portion of what the channel currently runs. The highlight for male viewers in ""Alice Upside Down"" will undoubtedly be Ashley Eckstein, a gorgeous young actress whom I was surprised to see playing a teacher when I know she was very recently playing Disney Channel high school students herself, but I think she got those gigs with her very youthful appearance. She certainly gets the mouth watering in this film, but I've always enjoyed ogling her onscreen, even on Blue Collar TV. Definitely my favorite aspect of the movie.Overall, ""Alice Upside Down"" is just an okay film, unless you are a girl in or around 6th grade who needs very little excitement or story. I realize it is intended to be a ""coming of age film"" as such, though more likely the first in what is hoping to be several, but I can't shake the feeling that it's just kind of TOO bland. The low-budget quality of the whole thing (something that is usually all the more evident in the music and how it is used), which looks to be lower than a Disney Channel movie's budget (probably much lower than the most recent ones), doesn't help much either. I also wasn't very big on the fantasy sequences, which felt a bit clunky in their presentation. If you or your kid is a fan of the book series though, that would surely add some excitement to seeing this film. Hey, I understand, I grew up with ""Superfudge"" and all that stuff (though I was more into ""Bunnicula"" myself). Who knows how the fans will like it though. From what little I've read about the book series (notably, one that has been praised for its coverage of the topic of sex, which makes the non-reader wonder just how the topic is handled in the books), there are some differences to be sure. The anamorphic widescreen DVD boasts a trailer, an interview with Alyson Stoner, an interview with Lucas Grabeel, and a little vid about Alice's costumes for the film. The interviews surely make nice little treats for the hardcore fans of the stars.",3,"Probably would have worked better as a TV show, but okay.",1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,5326,"['Alice',

Brought back some memories from my jr high years. This is the first in a series of direct to video Alice movies based on the books of the same title.Alyson Stoner does a very good job of acting in this film. Some may remember her from Mikes super short show and Suite life of Zack and Cody.She also guest stared on an ep of Thats So Raven.In the above series her characters were out going in Alice(She plays Alice) the character is subdued compaired to the above. She plays the subdued Alice great, which shows off her range of acting she can do.Her best scene is at the end when she is crying while talking to her dad.You can see real tears. One of the few actresses that pulls off a scene like that so convinceingly.Lucas Grabeel from High School Musical plays Alices brother.Alice is a girl where everything she does seems to go wrong.To borrow a phrase ""If it weren't for bad luck she would have no luck at all.""If that weren't enough her mom died a few years early and they have moved recently to a new house away from eveything she new. She falls on her facefitting in the first day at her new school. The girl across the street does however give her a change at school after there first meeting as they were moving in seemingly taking an instant dislike to Alice.In the end things start to work out. I like that its not a she lives happy every after ending. In the next films she will not dought face new problems to work out.This is sort of Lizzie Mcquireish that we see what she is thinking live action not cartoon. The tone of the film is Nickelodeon. Would be a good network for it to air on.Start collecting these films. Good store, Good lessons, Good acting.Oh there is soundtrack avalable for this movie. Alyson sings two songs.One a solo, and one a duet. Lost and Found and Free Spirit. You can get the soundtrack with the movie in a double pack but only at Walmart. They should do a normal release of the Soundtrack.

The rest of the cast seemed well selected and it was a pleasant surprise to see Penny Marshall acting again. The storyline seemed more like a made for TV show sit-com.

Strongly supported by the fine performance of Penny Marshall as Mrs. Plotkin and Luke Perry as Ben McKinley, the movie depicts the sad and painful years of a teenager who lost her mother when she was five. Her father Ben is of little help since he is still in a state sadness after losing his wife. Adjusting to the life of widower and bringing up two children on his own is a little too much for him. In the meantime Alice learns to live in a fantasy world with vivid imagination to keep her happy. With some help from her teacher Mrs. Plotkin, she learns to be less judgmental in life and grows to a reasonable young woman. The movie shows a contrasting life of her big brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) who seems to have a normal life and even popular among girls. The movie shows the vulnerability of growing young woman without her mother, but apparently has lesser impact on a boy. Alice Stoner offers a brilliant performance in this excellent family drama: Highly recommended for family viewing.1.A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains - Decision Making2.Growing Pain Series - Three Big Teen Issues3.A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains - Protecting Yourself4.Growing Pains - The Complete First Season5.The Facts of Life - The Complete First & Second Seasons6.Family Ties - The Complete First Season7.A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains - Family Changes8.Step by Step (Television Favorites Compilation)9.Diff'rent Strokes -  The Complete First Season10.Full House - The Complete Series Collection",4,Growing Pains: The Alice McKinley story,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1631,"['drama', 'based', 'story', 'Phyllis', 'Reynolds', 'Naylor', 'growing', 'pains', 'teenager', 'named', 'Alice', 'McKinley', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Strongly', 'supported', 'fine', 'performance', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkin', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Ben', 'McKinley', 'movie', 'sad', 'painful', 'years', 'teenager', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'father', 'Ben', 'little', 'help', 'still', 'state', 'sadness', 'losing', 'wife', 'Adjusting', 'life', 'widower', 'bringing', 'up', 'two', 'children', 'own', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'meantime', 'Alice', 'live', 'fantasy', 'world', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'keep', 'happy', 'help', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkin', 'be', 'less', 'judgmental', 'life', 'reasonable', 'young', 'woman', 'movie', 'contrasting', 'life', 'big', 'brother', 'Lester', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'who', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'even', 'popular', 'girls', 'movie', 'vulnerability', 'growing', 'young', 'woman', 'mother', 'apparently', 'lesser', 'impact', 'boy', 'Alice', 'Stoner', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'excellent', 'family', 'drama', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'viewing.1.A', 'Parent', 'Guide', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Decision', 'Making2.Growing', 'Pain', 'Series', 'Three', 'Big', 'Teen', 'Issues3.A', 'Parent', 'Guide', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Protecting', 'Yourself4.Growing', 'Pains', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season5.The', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Complete', 'First', 'Second', 'Seasons6.Family', 'Ties', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season7.A', 'Parent', 'Guide', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Family', 'Changes8.Step', 'Step', 'Television', 'Favorites', 'Compilation', ""9.Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season10.Full', 'House', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection']",Alice Upside Down
1158416,A1K94LXX833JTT,B00180OU7U,Sanpete,"[0, 0]","This is a direct-to-DVD movie based onThe Agony of Alice, the original installment of the Alice series of books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.  It's pitched at the same audience as the book, girls about 12 or younger.  It focuses on some of the issues girls face in a not-too-heavy, often humorous, direct way.  Nothing harsh, no swearing, no drugs, no sex, entirely ""family-friendly.""Alice (Alyson Stoner), whose mother died six years ago, enters the 6th grade at a new school, in a new city, with no friends.  Her father (Luke Perry) is supportive, her older brother (Lucas Gabreel) is basically OK for a brother, but she has to deal with insecurities, embarrassments, the beginnings of boy-issues, Dad dating, and a knack for flubbing things up once in a while.  She seeks a mother-figure, and possible match for Dad, in one of the teachers at school.  Meanwhile she's stuck with a teacher she doesn't like (Penny Marshall).  And there's a school play to try out for.  Alice often speaks to the camera, and there are also fantasy sequences in which she imagines things much better than they are.  There are plenty of moments likely to strike young girls as hilarious.  Not everything gets solved or works out as hoped, but it's all treated in a positive way.The special features are brief-but-long-enough interviews with Stoner and Gabreel and, showing the producers know what matters, an interview with the costume designer about Alice's clothes.  Outtakes run with the closing credits.This is too well intentioned and good-hearted to nit-pick much about.  It's a low-budget film with limited production values, noticeable especially in the score, but I don't think any of that will matter to most of the target audience.  The acting and script are effective enough.  Stoner plays Alice in an engaging, low-key way, easy to empathize with.  Perry and Marshall (who must have taken far less than their usual fees to participate) play their roles sensitively.  Gabreel is fun.  Girls already into Anne of Green Gables or the like might not be impressed, but I think most 12 and under will find it fun and will identify with some of the issues.",4,Family film uses humor and warmth to deal with young girls' problems,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2142,"['direct-to-DVD', 'movie', 'based', 'onThe', 'Agony', 'Alice', 'original', 'installment', 'Alice', 'series', 'books', 'Phyllis', 'Reynolds', 'Naylor', 'pitched', 'same', 'audience', 'book', 'girls', '12', 'younger', 'issues', 'girls', 'face', 'not-too-heavy', 'often', 'humorous', 'direct', 'way', 'Nothing', 'harsh', 'swearing', 'drugs', 'sex', 'entirely', 'family-friendly', 'Alice', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'mother', 'died', 'six', 'years', 'ago', '6th', 'grade', 'new', 'school', 'new', 'city', 'friends', 'father', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'supportive', 'older', 'brother', 'Lucas', 'Gabreel', 'basically', 'OK', 'brother', 'deal', 'insecurities', 'embarrassments', 'beginnings', 'boy-issues', 'Dad', 'dating', 'knack', 'flubbing', 'things', 'up', 'once', 'while', 'mother-figure', 'possible', 'match', 'Dad', 'one', 'teachers', 'school', 'Meanwhile', 'stuck', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'like', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'school', 'play', 'try', 'out', 'Alice', 'often', 'camera', 'are', 'also', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'things', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'likely', 'strike', 'young', 'girls', 'hilarious', 'Not', 'everything', 'solved', 'out', 'hoped', 'treated', 'positive', 'way.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'brief-but-long-enough', 'interviews', 'Stoner', 'Gabreel', 'showing', 'producers', 'know', 'what', 'matters', 'interview', 'costume', 'designer', 'Alice', 'clothes', 'Outtakes', 'run', 'closing', 'credits.This', 'too', 'well', 'intentioned', 'good-hearted', 'nit-pick', 'much', 'low-budget', 'film', 'limited', 'production', 'values', 'noticeable', 'especially', 'score', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'matter', 'most', 'target', 'audience', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'effective', 'enough', 'Stoner', 'Alice', 'engaging', 'low-key', 'way', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Perry', 'Marshall', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'far', 'less', 'usual', 'fees', 'participate', 'play', 'roles', 'sensitively', 'Gabreel', 'fun', 'Girls', 'already', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'like', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'think', 'most', '12', 'will', 'find', 'fun', 'will', 'identify', 'issues']",Alice Upside Down

1158418,A1XJOSJN6FHFO0,B00180OU7U,"Shirley Priscilla  Johnson ""Author/Reviewer -...","[1, 1]","Alice, the star of our movie, is about to enter sixth-grade.  Her self-esteem is anything but good as she feels she can't do anything right and always ends up in one embarrassing situation after another. Yes, she is moving with all the insecurities of someone about to enter their teenage years. Scary!To make matters worse, she doesn't have a mother to guide her as she died when Alice was five.  Now, her father Ben, and her older brother, Lester do the best they can to steer Alice in the right directions, but half the time they don't have a clue as to what her true needs are.  Her father is stuck somewhere between trying to move on in life, and holding onto the memory of his lost wife, unaware of how to deal with the struggles his daughter is experiencing. Now,  to compound Alice's life, her father buys a store and moves his family into a new town.  Definitely not something that Alice approves of. She is already believing herself to be a misfit and is horrified at the thought of trying to fit in a new school and make new friends. She often throws herself into a fantasy world, daydreaming of how she sees situations played out, only to realize she isn't even close to what is happening around her.When Alice is put into Mrs. Plotkins (played by Penny Marshall),  sixth grade class instead of the beautiful, cool, Ms. Coles, she feels her world will end.  Desperate to be near Ms. Cole, who she feels is the perfect role-model that she needs, she signs up to be in a school musical directed by her.  The one problem is, Alice, despite the talent in her family, her brother has a band, her father sings and writes songs, Alice cannot sing.  When she is given a part of one of the frogs, Alice is devastated, until kind Ms.  Cole also gives her a small dancing solo.Of  course the worse happens as Alice trips and falls on opening night, right into the scenery and knocks down the star of the show. Anger arises in both Ms. Cole and our super-star as they blame Alice and ask her to leave.  It is the wisdom of Mrs. Plotkins that takes Alice from a suicidal mess to understanding that life happens and often things do not work out as we fantasize they will. Alice starts to understand that difficult situations and embarrassing moments happen to us all, but that doesn't mean its the end of the world. Those are great messages to leave with our children, and it is portrayed quite well in this movie.However, just when you think Alice has it all together she is thrown another blow when she hears disturbing news about Mrs. Plotkins, but all of this turns around to bring Alice to a place in her life where she can finally begin to live.I really liked this movie.  I felt the actors did a wonderful job in the parts they played.  The banter between Alice and her brother, Lester, was great.  The one thing I particularly liked was the way the movie portrayed a true caring between the two of them.  I have seen way too many movies, and TV shows where brothers and sisters only show anger towards each other, so this was very refreshing. Lester was funny, real, and brought the perfect piece of the puzzle for boys to also enjoy this movie. I watched this with my granddaughter and daughter.  The ending was so touching to them, it brought them to tears, yet there were times in this movie that were quite humorous.  Good mix.All in all I feel this is an outstanding movie that a family would enjoy watching together, as we did.  Characters are great, storyline is great, and the ending is top-notch.  I believe you will enjoy this one.",5,Great Family Movie,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,3547,"['Alice', 'star', 'movie', 'enter', 'sixth-grade', 'self-esteem', 'anything', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'always', 'up', 'one', 'embarrassing', 'situation', 'Yes', 'moving', 'insecurities', 'someone', 'enter', 'teenage', 'years', 'Scary', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', ""n't"", 'have', 'mother', 'guide', 'died', 'when', 'Alice', 'was', 'five', 'Now', 'father', 'Ben', 'older', 'brother', 'Lester', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'steer', 'Alice', 'right', 'directions', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'true', 'needs', 'are', 'father', 'stuck', 'somewhere', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'holding', 'memory', 'lost', 'wife', 'unaware', 'how', 'deal', 'struggles', 'daughter', 'experiencing', 'Now', 'compound', 'Alice', 'life', 'father', 'store', 'family', 'new', 'town', 'Definitely', 'not', 'something', 'Alice', 'approves', 'already', 'believing', 'be', 'misfit', 'horrified', 'thought', 'trying', 'fit', 'new', 'school', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'often', 'fantasy', 'world', 'daydreaming', 'how', 'situations', 'played', 'out', 'only', 'realize', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'what', 'happening', 'around', 'her.When', 'Alice', 'put', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkins', 'played', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'sixth', 'grade', 'class', 'instead', 'beautiful', 'cool', 'Ms.', 'Coles', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'Desperate', 'be', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'who', 'perfect', 'role-model', 'signs', 'be', 'school', 'musical', 'directed', 'one', 'problem', 'Alice', 'talent', 'family', 'brother', 'band', 'father', 'sings', 'songs', 'Alice', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'When', 'given', 'part', 'one', 'frogs', 'Alice', 'devastated', 'kind', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'also', 'small', 'dancing', 'solo.Of', 'course', 'worse', 'Alice', 'trips', 'falls', 'opening', 'night', 'right', 'scenery', 'knocks', 'down', 'star', 'show', 'Anger', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'super-star', 'blame', 'Alice', 'ask', 'leave', 'wisdom', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkins', 'Alice', 'suicidal', 'mess', 'understanding', 'life', 'happens', 'often', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'fantasize', 'will', 'Alice', 'starts', 'understand', 'difficult', 'situations', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'happen', ""n't"", 'mean', 'end', 'world', 'are', 'great', 'messages', 'leave', 'children', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'well', 'movie.However', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'Alice', 'together', 'thrown', 'blow', 'when', 'disturbing', 'news', 'Mrs.', 'Plotkins', 'around', 'bring', 'Alice', 'place', 'life', 'where', 'can', 'finally', 'begin', 'live.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'felt', 'actors', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'parts', 'played', 'banter', 'Alice', 'brother', 'Lester', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'thing', 'particularly', 'liked', 'was', 'way', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'true', 'caring', 'two', 'have', 'seen', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'where', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'only', 'show', 'anger', 'towards', 'other', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'Lester', 'was', 'funny', 'real', 'brought', 'perfect', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'boys', 'also', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'watched', 'granddaughter', 'daughter', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'brought', 'tears', 'yet', 'were', 'times', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Good', 'mix.All', 'feel', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'family', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together', 'did', 'Characters', 'are', 'great', 'storyline', 'great', 'ending', 'top-notch', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one']",Alice Upside Down
1158419,A3NWN21HH5CEWZ,B00180OU7U,S. Smith,"[1, 1]","I anticipated this movie to be around the same age-level as High School Musical.  It was not.  I think this movie, while very well acted, is really for kids ages 11 and over.  There is too much thinking, understanding, brattiness etc... that goes over the heads of younger ones.  I watched it with two 7 year old girls and one 8 year old boy and felt that it was a few years too early for them to be watching it.  Kids kissing, boy rock band with no shirts, very mean girls - it just didn't feel right to watch it with them.  I am not an overbearing mom by any means but I would think twice before letting any kids under 5th grade watch this movie.That all said, Alyson Stoner is such a cute and wonderful actress and played the part of Alice perfectly.  Same with Lucas Grabeel, her brother, who is the total opposite of his High School Musical character.  Luke Perry didn't have much of a part and he was just okay.  It was very nice to see Penny Marshall playing a part instead of behind the scenes.  She did a spot on job of playing the ""mean"" teacher in school and how she is misunderstood.So overall I think it is a very good well acted movie for kids over 10 years old.

1158420,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B00180OU7U,TheBandit,"[2, 5]","""Alice Upside Down"" is not a bad kid's movie.  It's just not a very good one.  The story concerns a sixth grade girl, Alice, who's family has moved to a new city. It's just her, her father, and brother - the mother passed away several years ago.  Alice is awkward and unstylish.  She has a generally hard time fitting in at her new school.  Throughout the movie, we watch Alice trying hard to make new friends and avoid embarrassing situations.The movie was based on a book.  I haven't read it, but I got the feeling that the filmmakers really didn't figure out what story they were telling.  Books can pursue all sorts of plots and subplots, all while adding up to something complete.  This movie is all over the map, plot-wise.  It couldn't settle on just telling Alice's story - it also tried to tell her brother's story and her father's story. In fact, there didn't even seem to be much focus regarding Alice's story.  Is this a movie about a girl trying to fit in with her peers?  Is it a movie about a young girl coming to terms with not having a mother?  Many avenues are explored, but there isn't enough skill in the writing to make it all satisfying in 90 minutes.  Inner monologue is also suited to books.  Having Alice directly address the camera in most scenes was distracting - and usually unnecessary as it rarely revealed anything we couldn't figure out for ourselves.Alyson Stoner plays Alice.  I remember seeing this girl years ago dancing in Missy Elliot videos.  I'm not sure if dancing is still her forte, but they do manage to work it into the movie.  Alice sets her sights on playing the lead in the school play.  Despite having talented musicians in her family (her dad is a singer/songwriter and her brother has a rock band), Alice can't carry a tune.  Unfortunately for her, the school play happens to be a musical.  Even so, she manages to land a role that requires some dancing.On the subject of Alyson Stoner, she is likeable and natural as Alice.  Also convincing is Lucas Grabeel, as her smart-alec brother Lester.  For the older siblings and/or parents who watch this movie - Luke Perry portrays the father.  Penny 'Laverne' Marshall is nicely understated as Alice's teacher.The synopsis on the DVD case makes it seem like Alice lives in a fantasy world of her own conjuring - with her various trials and tribulations alternating between reality and how she envisions them in her imagination. Another problem with the movie is that this concept is hardly explored.  We see a handle of scenes play out as Alice would like them to - with her being more confident and popular.  But it never contributes in any significant way to Alice's character.  In a way, those imagined scenarios just seem like ways to fill extra running time.All that said, the movie is inoffensive and very young viewers (like 12 and under) will likely enjoy it.  The DVD features include short interviews with Stoner and Grabeel and a featurette about the costumes.",2,Watchable time-passer for pre-teens,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,2967,"['Alice', 'Upside', 'Down', 'not', 'bad', 'kid', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'sixth', 'grade', 'girl', 'Alice', 'who', 'family', 'moved', 'new', 'city', 'just', 'father', 'brother', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Alice', 'awkward', 'unstylish', 'generally', 'hard', 'time', 'fitting', 'new', 'school', 'movie', 'watch', 'Alice', 'trying', 'hard', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'avoid', 'embarrassing', 'situations.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'got', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'were', 'telling', 'Books', 'can', 'pursue', 'sorts', 'plots', 'subplots', 'adding', 'up', 'something', 'complete', 'movie', 'map', 'plot-wise', 'could', ""n't"", 'settle', 'just', 'telling', 'Alice', 'story', 'also', 'tried', 'tell', 'brother', 'story', 'father', 'story', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'focus', 'regarding', 'Alice', 'story', 'movie', 'girl', 'trying', 'fit', 'peers', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'coming', 'terms', 'not', 'having', 'mother', 'Many', 'avenues', 'are', 'explored', ""n't"", 'enough', 'skill', 'writing', 'make', 'satisfying', '90', 'minutes', 'Inner', 'monologue', 'also', 'suited', 'books', 'Having', 'Alice', 'directly', 'camera', 'most', 'scenes', 'was', 'distracting', 'usually', 'unnecessary', 'rarely', 'revealed', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'ourselves.Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Alice', 'remember', 'seeing', 'girl', 'years', 'ago', 'dancing', 'Missy', 'Elliot', 'videos', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'dancing', 'still', 'forte', 'do', 'manage', 'work', 'movie', 'Alice', 'sights', 'playing', 'lead', 'school', 'play', 'having', 'talented', 'musicians', 'family', 'dad', 'singer/songwriter', 'brother', 'rock', 'band', 'Alice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'tune', 'Unfortunately', 'school', 'play', 'be', 'musical', 'Even', 'so', 'land', 'role', 'dancing.On', 'subject', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'likeable', 'natural', 'Alice', 'Also', 'convincing', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'smart-alec', 'brother', 'Lester', 'older', 'siblings', 'parents', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'father', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'nicely', 'understated', 'Alice', 'teacher.The', 'synopsis', 'DVD', 'case', 'seem', 'Alice', 'fantasy', 'world', 'own', 'conjuring', 'various', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'alternating', 'reality', 'how', 'imagination', 'problem', 'movie', 'concept', 'hardly', 'explored', 'see', 'handle', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'Alice', 'would', 'like', 'being', 'more', 'confident', 'popular', 'never', 'significant', 'way', 'Alice', 'character', 'way', 'imagined', 'scenarios', 'just', 'seem', 'like', 'ways', 'fill', 'extra', 'running', 'time.All', 'said', 'movie', 'inoffensive', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', '12', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'features', 'include', 'short', 'interviews', 'Stoner', 'Grabeel', 'featurette', 'costumes']",Alice Upside Down

I have five boys, so in our house ""Hannah Montana"" and ""The Suite Life of Zach and Cody"" aren't exactly standard fare.  While reading one of the many parenting magazines I subscribe too, I ran across a short blurb about this movie, and I admit I wanted to see it because Luke Perry (Dylan Mckay....He's soooo dreamy!!) played the father.  While the storyline was pretty standard stuff, we knew what was going to happen well in advance, the interaction between Alice (Alyson Stoner), her older brother Lester (Lucas Grabell of High School Musical fame) and their father Ben (played by Perry) was believable.  It was nice to see a somewhat realistic portrayal of sibling relationships on screen.  Often times the older sibling either ignores the younger one in favor of over the top drama, or the interaction is left off screen, but for the most part Alice and Ben seemed to get along.  Yes, there was some teasing, but I think their relationship was very realistic and I liked seeing that.  Ben was there for his sister, or he tried to be as best he could, and I think in reality that is how most siblings behave.Perry was a treat as well.  I fondly watched 90210 'back in the day' and enjoyed his tormented portrayal of Dylan McKay.  Over the years he has done some ok work, but it was nice to see him in a role more suited to his age.  He seemed lost in dealing with the 'anguish' his daughter felt at being the new girl in school, and his relationship with Stoner was surprisingly touching.Penny Marshall put in a nice turn as the 'mean teacher with a heart of gold.'  Again, the interaction between Marshall and Stoner was truly believable.I could see this as a very popular series, and I think the movie showed there was so much that could be explored regarding this family.  I liked that the family wasn't dealing with silly over the top drama and were simply trying to get through things one day at a time.  I even found myself choking back a bit when Ben was talking to his crying daughter.This won't win any accolades or be nominated to any awards, but it was a nice wholesome family movie, one this mom very much appreciated.",3,Your standard Fare,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2239,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'expected', 'be', 'silly', 'version', 'Disney', 'show', 'have', 'five', 'boys', 'so', 'house', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Suite', 'Life', 'Zach', 'Cody', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'standard', 'fare', 'reading', 'one', 'many', 'parenting', 'magazines', 'subscribe', 'too', 'ran', 'short', 'blurb', 'movie', 'admit', 'wanted', 'see', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Dylan', 'Mckay', '.He', 'soooo', 'dreamy', 'played', 'father', 'storyline', 'was', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'well', 'advance', 'interaction', 'Alice', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'older', 'brother', 'Lester', 'Lucas', 'Grabell', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'fame', 'father', 'Ben', 'played', 'Perry', 'was', 'believable', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'sibling', 'relationships', 'screen', 'Often', 'older', 'sibling', 'younger', 'one', 'favor', 'top', 'drama', 'interaction', 'left', 'off', 'screen', 'most', 'part', 'Alice', 'Ben', 'seemed', 'get', 'along', 'Yes', 'was', 'teasing', 'think', 'relationship', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Ben', 'was', 'there', 'sister', 'tried', 'be', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'think', 'reality', 'how', 'most', 'siblings', 'behave.Perry', 'was', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'fondly', 'watched', '90210', ""'back"", 'day', 'enjoyed', 'tormented', 'portrayal', 'Dylan', 'McKay', 'years', 'done', 'ok', 'work', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'role', 'more', 'suited', 'age', 'seemed', 'lost', 'dealing', ""'anguish"", 'daughter', 'felt', 'being', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'relationship', 'Stoner', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'touching.Penny', 'Marshall', 'put', 'nice', 'turn', ""'mean"", 'teacher', 'heart', 'gold', 'Again', 'interaction', 'Marshall', 'Stoner', 'was', 'truly', 'believable.I', 'could', 'see', 'very', 'popular', 'series', 'think', 'movie', 'showed', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'explored', 'regarding', 'family', 'liked', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'dealing', 'silly', 'top', 'drama', 'were', 'simply', 'trying', 'get', 'things', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'even', 'found', 'choking', 'back', 'bit', 'when', 'Ben', 'was', 'talking', 'crying', 'daughter.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'accolades', 'be', 'nominated', 'awards', 'was', 'nice', 'wholesome', 'family', 'movie', 'one', 'mom', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated']",Alice Upside Down
1158422,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00180OU7U,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I watched ""Alice Upside Down"" with my 8.5-year-old daughter tonight and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. This is a perfect family movie, although it might be better suited for ages 8 and up since younger children may not relate to some of the issues faced by the central character. The story centers around sixth-grader Alice (Alyson Stoner) who reluctantly moves with her widower dad, Ben (Luke Perry) and older brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) to another town. Although it has been six years since Alice's mother's death, it is obvious that Alice misses her mother's presence and so does Ben. Alice tries hard to fit in at school but finds that she can't seem to get anything right, stumbling along, making mistakes, and going through adolescent pangs.Alice takes a shine to the theater teacher, the young and vivacious Miss Cole (Ashley Eckstein), and doesn't quite like her homeroom teacher Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall) who is older and much more strict, but as the movie progresses Alice's experiences teach her mot to judge people by their appearances, and also comes to terms with her mother's death and improves the relationship with her father.The themes explored in this movie will resonate with parents and young adults alike - loneliness/ alienation, grieving the loss of a loved one, adolescent angst, and many more. The main cast does an excellent job in his/her's respective roles, and there is no profanity or offensive language or mature content, so it makes for a great family movie. There is humor but it is on the whole a heartfelt drama that explores one young girl's coming to terms with who she is and how she develops a sense of self-identity and confidence.
