It looked so uninteresting and boring, and then it all changed. It got better and better with every minute. It's  interesting how a boy changed the grown up man's life. It was fun and yet it describes most of people having such a miserable life, like Bill does. His wife is cheating, life and job , sucks, he is fat and unattractive always eats candies and so on. But there is the boy who without a reason helps him. They both starting to like each other even when they don't say anything, you can well see it. The teen kid teaches Bill how to have fun, change the life in a fun way, less caring about job or business or police, way. They get high and the kid teaches Bill something else.

427796,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6304542887,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[10, 14]","In `Meet Bill' Aaron Eckhart once again expands his career repertoire with a role we're accustomed to seeing Steve Carell play.  As partial as I am to both actors, it's refreshing to see him play the fumbling underdog, closer to Carell's performance in `Dan in Real Life'.  Too bad this sitcom worthy movie has little else to commend it. There are original, quirky elements, but the screwball execution is spotty for laughs and disjointed in parts.Bill is in a middle-aged rut.  Dependent on his wife Jess (Elizabeth Banks), he works as head of human relations at his father-in-law's bank.  Jess looks healthy.  She wears workout apparel and continually tries to prod Bill to adhere to his doctor's diet, one that eschews his coveted donut fix.  At work he is like a dog on a leash.  Not thrilled to begin with working under his father-in-law, Bill hates it when he's proposed to join their mentor program.  He meets ""the kid"" (Logan Lerman) he's supposed to mentor in the bathroom, where Bill helps him hide the marijuana he flushes down the toilet before his school liaison catches him.  Next, not only does he have to mentor ""the kid,"" he has to go duck hunting with his in-laws and their sponsored teens.  Being an animal lover, he becomes an awful shot, but provides some of the best laughs of the movie.Getting chubby, the hubby suspects Jess is having an affair.  Planting a camera beneath a translucent hat, he catches her in adultery with a local news reporter, Chip Johnson (Timothy Olyphant).  Things go from bad to worse as Bill goes after Chip and the media gets a hold of the infidelity caught on tape.  With nowhere to live, Bill turns to his gay brother, Sargeant (Craig Bierko*), a sporting goods store owner, and his partner Paul (Reed Diamond) to stay.  A fitness buff, Paul tries to turn Bill's life around.Bill wants to stay in his marriage while getting out of the bank.  Jess hates the surveillance and doesn't say it, but Bill's slob appearance is indicative of his care for her as well.  Forming a friendship ""the kid"" warms up to Bill before he can reciprocate.  His friend and love interest, Lucy (Jessica Alba) seems much more mature than he, but she is a great resource for Bill.  Both of them take an interest in getting Bill and Jess back together.Although I don't condone illegal drug use, I have to admit it's a clever twist to have the mentor corrupted by his young apprentice.  Eckhart plays a stoner scene like a pro as he and ""the kid"" go rock climbing in his brother's sports' store, easily one of the funniest scenes in the movie.For all the oddball factors, 'Meet Bill' won't ruin your evening, but it won't provide the most compelling comedy, either.(If 'Meet Bill' and 'The Forty Year Old Virgin' are any indication, most women don't favor men's body hair.

The story meanders, and feels like the writers knew where it would take off, but not how it should land. The pacing becomes a slow, dull crawl.

When Dolph refuses to 'take the shot' when instructed to do so, the mission controller orders that they pair be executed. On the run, they both meet up for another mission, and find that this time, it's them who's being hunted.The acting is about par for Lundgren. I don't see him winning any academy awards, but he's better than some I've seen. The fight scenes and gun scenes are really what drew me to this film.

There is little, if anything, new in this version.Here's the scoop. Aaron Eckhart is married to Elizabeth Banks. He works for her dad at the family bank. He has a vague title with no real responsibility. Right at the time he begins to mentor a cocky high-schooler, his wife begins an affair with a local news personality. He's now at a crossroads. Which way will he go?I like these actors. Aaron, Elizabeth, Timothy Olyphant, Jessica ALba (she's so-so) so I wanted to like this movie, but it made it nearly impossible for me to do so. If Eckhart is such a doormat, how is it he's married to such a hottie like Banks? If he wasn't always so, how did he get like that? Those questions are only lightly touched on. Most of the situations are forced, and when you got there, they weren't played well. The pot smoking scene, the fireworks buying scene, the girls in the tent scene simply didn't ring true. Eckhart plays a genuinely decent guy and here he is contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Sorry. Didn't buy it. There were so few scenes that were believable it surprised me to see Eckhart's name as one of the producers. He's been around the block a few times and should have seen the lameness of the whole thing. The entire situation is set up in the first five or ten minutes, so the viewer knows what has to happen.

427815,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6304542887,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""Silent Trigger"" is a bit of an odd action vehicle for both Dolph Lundgren and director Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). The cast primarily consists of only four players - two protagonists, an antagonist, and a consistent bystander - three of whom remain unnamed throughout the movie. The majority of the film takes place with the four characters alone in an empty high-rise building. If it weren't for the action scenes, this might very well have been a stage drama, but even though this is the artsy-est storytelling you're ever going to see in a Lundgren film, it remains one of his best and a fan necessity.The story follows a mysterious Special Forces sniper (Lundgren) and his rookie female spotter (Gina Bellman,Coupling) - political assassins forced to go their separate when an overseas mission is compromised but reunited for one last job in a derelict skyscraper. Amidst reliving their initial failed encounter via a series of flashbacks, the pair must contend with the maniacal motives of an insane security guard (Christopher Heyerdahl,Sanctuary) looking to get the better of them in a drug-induced rage...though this doesn't seem to bother his mysterious fellow guard (Conrad Dunn,Nero Wolfe) at all for some reason.Since this is a character-driven piece, acting ability is a must for the performers, and I'm glad to say that for the most part, they come through. Lundgren won't win any awards but he achieves the required balance between secrecy and sincerity needed to make his character likeable, Heyerdahl does well as a chauvinistic man slowly descending into madness, and Dunn remains a rightful enigma until the climax. Bellman has some weak spots that express themselves as unfounded overconfidence, but she eventually ends up performing acceptably when it counts. Even Lundgren's bolt-action sniper rifle has a kind of character to it...The action is sparser than I tend to like, but in this case, it doesn't hurt the movie. There are approximately three shootouts (all of which include the sniper rifle), one hand-to-hand confrontation between Lundgren and Heyerdahl, and one combination shoot-and-punch in which Lundgren takes on a roomful of special ops soldiers. While the sniping action is good, it's not quite as furious as I had been hoping for, and the hand-to-hand stuff is purely beat-'em-up material - no technical martial arts encounters. Surprisingly, what's there is done with such flair and built up so well that it's satisfying nonetheless: every shot counts, every roundhouse kick has a purpose, and this keeps the action fresh, even though there's not an overload of it.""Silent Trigger"" is a TV production made on the relatively modest budget of $15 million, so expect just a couple of insufficiencies when it comes to the CGI. The extended storyline bugs me a bit: the nature of the entity that Lundgren and Bellman work for is never explained - all we know is that it does not tolerate failure to the point of instructing spotters to terminate their snipers should they not deliver, but saw fit to take them both back for one more mission...even though I was sure that Lundgren's character had gone into hiding. That, including the unsolved significance of the high-rise building, was no doubt included to heighten the sense of mystery, but leads to a bit too much head-scratching for me.Rest assured, no flaw is not enough to drag the movie down, and even these shortcomings end up contributing to the film's slightly far-out flavor; it has a bit more character because of its imperfections. Lundgren fans may be a bit surprised at the road their hero went down in this feature, but it's nonetheless worth having on your shelf, even for non- Lundgren-exclusive action fans.",4,Lundgren's Silent Success,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,3714,"['Silent', 'Trigger', 'bit', 'odd', 'action', 'vehicle', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'Highlander', 'cast', 'primarily', 'only', 'four', 'players', 'two', 'protagonists', 'antagonist', 'consistent', 'bystander', 'three', 'whom', 'remain', 'unnamed', 'movie', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'four', 'characters', 'alone', 'empty', 'high-rise', 'building', 'were', ""n't"", 'action', 'scenes', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'stage', 'drama', 'even', 'artsy-est', 'storytelling', ""'re"", 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'Lundgren', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'fan', 'necessity.The', 'story', 'mysterious', 'Special', 'Forces', 'sniper', 'Lundgren', 'rookie', 'female', 'spotter', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'Coupling', 'political', 'assassins', 'forced', 'go', 'separate', 'when', 'overseas', 'mission', 'compromised', 'reunited', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'derelict', 'skyscraper', 'Amidst', 'reliving', 'initial', 'failed', 'encounter', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'pair', 'must', 'contend', 'maniacal', 'motives', 'insane', 'security', 'guard', 'Christopher', 'Heyerdahl', 'Sanctuary', 'looking', 'get', 'better', 'drug-induced', 'rage', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'mysterious', 'fellow', 'guard', 'Conrad', 'Dunn', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'reason.Since', 'character-driven', 'piece', 'acting', 'ability', 'must', 'performers', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'come', 'Lundgren', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'required', 'balance', 'secrecy', 'sincerity', 'needed', 'make', 'character', 'likeable', 'Heyerdahl', 'well', 'chauvinistic', 'man', 'slowly', 'descending', 'madness', 'Dunn', 'rightful', 'enigma', 'climax', 'Bellman', 'weak', 'spots', 'express', 'unfounded', 'overconfidence', 'eventually', 'up', 'performing', 'acceptably', 'when', 'Even', 'Lundgren', 'bolt-action', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'kind', 'character', 'action', 'sparser', 'tend', 'like', 'case', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'are', 'approximately', 'three', 'shootouts', 'include', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'one', 'hand-to-hand', 'confrontation', 'Lundgren', 'Heyerdahl', 'one', 'combination', 'shoot-and-punch', 'Lundgren', 'roomful', 'special', 'ops', 'soldiers', 'sniping', 'action', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'furious', 'had', 'been', 'hoping', 'hand-to-hand', 'stuff', 'purely', ""beat-'em-up"", 'material', 'technical', 'martial', 'arts', 'encounters', 'Surprisingly', 'what', 'done', 'such', 'flair', 'built', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'satisfying', 'nonetheless', 'shot', 'counts', 'roundhouse', 'kick', 'purpose', 'action', 'fresh', 'even', 'not', 'overload', 'Silent', 'Trigger', 'TV', 'production', 'made', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', '15', 'million', 'so', 'expect', 'just', 'couple', 'insufficiencies', 'when', 'CGI', 'extended', 'storyline', 'bugs', 'bit', 'nature', 'entity', 'Lundgren', 'Bellman', 'work', 'never', 'explained', 'know', 'not', 'tolerate', 'failure', 'point', 'instructing', 'spotters', 'terminate', 'snipers', 'should', 'not', 'deliver', 'saw', 'fit', 'take', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'mission', 'even', 'was', 'sure', 'Lundgren', 'character', 'had', 'gone', 'hiding', 'including', 'unsolved', 'significance', 'high-rise', 'building', 'was', 'doubt', 'included', 'heighten', 'sense', 'mystery', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'head-scratching', 'me.Rest', 'assured', 'flaw', 'not', 'enough', 'drag', 'movie', 'down', 'even', 'shortcomings', 'end', 'up', 'contributing', 'film', 'slightly', 'far-out', 'flavor', 'bit', 'more', 'character', 'imperfections', 'Lundgren', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'surprised', 'road', 'hero', 'went', 'down', 'feature', 'nonetheless', 'worth', 'having', 'shelf', 'even', 'non-', 'Lundgren-exclusive', 'action', 'fans']",Silent Trigger VHS

It is a story we have already seen and heard a million times but the cast really makes this one worth watching. His wife (Elizabeth Banks) is a daddy's girl who is sleeping with the local newsman (Timothy Olyphant). Bill knows this but is helpless to do anything since his wife is responsible for everything in his life including his job and all his assets. He dreams of opening his own donut franchise but can't find any backing either from his father in law or his unsupportive wife. While at a local school where his father in law has just made a sizeable donation he meets a young kid that he eventually mentors. It is the kid who ends up teaching him a few things along the way. One of the first things he teaches Bill is that he needs to find a new chick to make the old one jealous. Bill doesn't know anyone so the kid provides the babe a lingerie saleswoman (Jessica Alba) that the kid has a crush on. She doesn't think Bill can be helped but plays along since she is being paid. After a few stints in jail for beating the newsman  Bill is kicked out of his house and forced to live with his brother whose shadow Bill has been living under for years. Everyone loves his brother but few know that he is gay. It is his partner along with the kid that try and get Bill to start caring about himself again by getting him to work out and change his look and wardrobe. They all conspire to help him open his donut franchise and get his wife back. Alba poses as his wife in order to appear more legit to the heads of the donut franchise (SNL's Kristin Wiig and Jason Sudeikis) and as that dream starts to become a reality other things fall into place for Bill. His wife seems willing to give him a second chance but grows jealous when she sees him with the sexy younger girl. Sure it is predictable and unoriginal but it's funny and sweet. The cast is exceptional with Eckhart nailing the role of the self loathing and sarcastic Bill and Banks is fantastic as the ditzy blonde wife who is sleeping with the newsman  because she is embarrassed by Bill and his simple life. Alba is a no brainer as the sexy new girl and is pretty good in her role.

He's nicely supported by Elizabeth Banks as his philandering wife; Logan Lerman as his preppie prot&eacute;g&eacute;; Jessica Alba as a lingerie salesgirl; Reed Diamond as his overly competitive gay brother-in-law; and SNL stars Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis as donut-shop franchise owners who hope to go into business with Bill.And speaking of the entrepreneurial spirit, a veritable goldmine awaits anyone savvy enough to market that amazing belly-busting weight-loss program Bill uses to great effect towards the end of the film.",3,nothing to rave about but has its moments,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1953,"['***1/2Bill', 'midst', 'full-blown', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'Not', 'only', 'job', 'made-up', 'position', 'father-in-law', 'bank', 'wife', 'cheating', 'local', 'news', 'reporter', 'Meanwhile', 'potbelly', 'be', 'expanding', 'increasingly', 'alarming', 'rate', 'condition', 'brought', 'massive', 'quantities', 'donuts', 'candy', 'bars', 'daily', 'nervousness', 'force', 'habit', 'Bill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'step', 'out', 'shadows', 'wife', 'dad', 'brother', 'whom', 'everyone', 'think', 'brighter', 'more', 'financially', 'successful', 'more', 'all-around', 'together', 'Bill', 'fact', 'one', 'hope', 'Bill', 'turning', 'life', 'around', 'may', 'well', 'rest', 'Alex', 'Keating-type', 'prep', 'school', 'student', 's', 'agreed', 'mentor', 'part', 'program', 'entrepreneurial', 'teens.Written', 'directed', 'Bernie', 'Goldman', 'Melisa', 'Walick', 'Meet', 'Bill', 'hilarious', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'just', 'enough', 'dull', 'patches', 'thrown', 'keep', 'raving', 'too', 'much', 'virtues', 'letting', 'too', 'much', 'hearts', 'screenplay', 'frequently', 'sharp', 'comic', 'portrayal', 'middle-aged', 'angst', 'also', 'vaguely', 'rudderless', 'undernourished', 'underdeveloped', 'much', 'time.The', 'real', 'joy', 'film', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'star', 'turn', 'man', 'career', 'personal', 'relationships', 'clearly', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', ""'d"", 'be', 'particular', 'point', 'life', 'nicely', 'supported', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'philandering', 'wife', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'preppie', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'lingerie', 'salesgirl', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'overly', 'competitive', 'gay', 'brother-in-law', 'SNL', 'stars', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'donut-shop', 'franchise', 'owners', 'who', 'hope', 'go', 'business', 'Bill.And', 'speaking', 'entrepreneurial', 'spirit', 'veritable', 'goldmine', 'anyone', 'savvy', 'enough', 'market', 'amazing', 'belly-busting', 'weight-loss', 'program', 'Bill', 'great', 'effect', 'end', 'film']",Silent Trigger VHS

427824,A3FPSY1M6G7XIB,6304542887,RonAnnArbor,"[1, 3]","This is a terrible script with a wonderful performance by Aaron Eckhart. Not surprisingly, the movie was never released beyond it's original run in 28 theatres -- 4 of which were in the two cities where the film was made (Minneapolis and St. Louis).The story is absolutely nonsensical -- a middle aged man with an identity crisis ""mentors"" a drug-using teen who ends up ""mentoring"" him. It makes no sense in any way, and the people in this movie would never really even come into contact with each other, let alone talk to each other and interact. Continuity problems abound - hair on Eckhart's chest for example, in a scene right after where he has shaved it off -- a ""crucial"" scene in the movie, according to the script...and location problems -- are we in Missouri? Are we in Minneapolis? At one point, they are invited ""up"" to Madison -- which is South East of Minnesotta -- at another time, there is a clear reference to Ferndale and they gay couple living there -- which is a reference to Detroit.Through it all, Aaron suffers no end of embarassing acting situations, and he must have gotten a pretty good paycheck for this Project Greenlight film. Both Banks and Alba were not the original choices for their roles, and points to the problems the producers had in even securing cast who were willing to perform in this film. Lindsey Lohan and Amanda Peat were the original choices -- and would have at least been consistent in age with the script's intentions....Alba is clearly 10 years too old for her role. Reed Diamond turns in another solid, though unremarkable, performance as the brother's gay lover.Craig Bierko has a small uncredited role as Bill's gay brother. Look for other uncredited cameos by a host of other actors. While the uncredited roles are often the landmark of small indi films like this one to avoid labor contract problems when donating time, in this case, they are probably the better for it.For Aaron Eckhart fans only.",3,"A wreck of a story, with endearing Eckhart",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1953,"['terrible', 'script', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'original', 'run', '28', 'theatres', '4', 'were', 'two', 'cities', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Minneapolis', 'St.', 'Louis', '.The', 'story', 'absolutely', 'nonsensical', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'identity', 'crisis', 'mentors', 'drug-using', 'teen', 'who', 'up', 'mentoring', 'sense', 'way', 'people', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'really', 'even', 'come', 'contact', 'other', 'let', 'alone', 'talk', 'other', 'interact', 'Continuity', 'problems', 'abound', 'hair', 'Eckhart', 'chest', 'example', 'scene', 'right', 'where', 'shaved', 'off', 'crucial', 'scene', 'movie', 'according', 'script', 'location', 'problems', 'are', 'Missouri', 'Are', 'Minneapolis', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'invited', 'up', 'Madison', 'South', 'East', 'Minnesotta', 'time', 'clear', 'reference', 'Ferndale', 'gay', 'couple', 'living', 'reference', 'Detroit.Through', 'Aaron', 'end', 'embarassing', 'acting', 'situations', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'pretty', 'good', 'paycheck', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'film', 'Banks', 'Alba', 'were', 'not', 'original', 'choices', 'roles', 'points', 'problems', 'producers', 'had', 'even', 'securing', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'willing', 'perform', 'film', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'Amanda', 'Peat', 'were', 'original', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'consistent', 'age', 'script', 'intentions', '.Alba', 'clearly', '10', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'turns', 'solid', 'unremarkable', 'performance', 'brother', 'gay', 'lover.Craig', 'Bierko', 'small', 'uncredited', 'role', 'Bill', 'gay', 'brother', 'Look', 'other', 'uncredited', 'cameos', 'host', 'other', 'actors', 'uncredited', 'roles', 'are', 'often', 'landmark', 'small', 'indi', 'films', 'one', 'avoid', 'labor', 'contract', 'problems', 'when', 'donating', 'time', 'case', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'it.For', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'only']",Silent Trigger VHS
427825,A26WVK274IA7DN,6304542887,Sarah Bellum,"[4, 6]","I tend to have a fairly poor opinion of movies of this sort, meaning inconsequential action movies. This category would include the films of Steven Segal, Jean-Claude van Damme, Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the like. With a few notable exceptions (""The Terminator,"" for example) these are forgettable time fillers. I was aware Dolph Lundgren made action movies, though I always associate him with his role as the Russian behemoth from ""Rocky IV."" Little did I realize he is Swedish, not Russian (the name should have been my first clue), is a martial artist and he is reputedly very intelligent; he holds a master's degree in chemical engineering and had a Fulbright Scholarship to go to MIT. Needless to say, I have newfound respect for Mr. Lundgren. Unfortunately, high intelligence does not necessarily always translate into great films. Such is the case with ""Silent Trigger,"" a mostly forgettable tale about an assassin (Lundgren), who has an epiphany, decides he is the bad guy and refuses to shoot a high-profile target. This leads his spotter (played by the marvelous Gina Bellman) to be ordered to dispose of him. We jump forward to another opportunity for assassination, where Shooter and Spotter again encounter one another. I am impressed by some of the cinematography, and the understated, dark atmosphere sometimes resembles a horror or suspense film. The violence is quite bloody and strong in this, which is something to which I am not very accustomed. I primarily watched this to see Gina Bellman, who is so good as Jane on ""Coupling."" Her physically demanding role here as an assassin is much different, though she is just as likeable. Does Dolph choose roles that do not require him to emote, or is he typecast in these roles? Either way, there isn't much opportunity for him to show his chops here, though we don't go into this film expectin4g as much. The finale is rather satisfying, so I would recommend if you are in the mood for a half-way decent action flick. The DVD offers a good transfer and a few different audio and subtitle options.

The fact that I am still a fan of the actor is testament to his vast on-screen charisma rather then his ability (luck?) to pick winning projects.Well, this is not a bad movie...Waxman is a battle-hardened sniper, working for a non-descript agency, when his moral consciousness comes a knocking, inconveniently, in the middle of an assignement, while he is being assisted by a rookie spotter (the lovely Gina Bellman; check her out in ""Couplings""). We hope he's been told to kill whoever hired the girl, for she has no clue (though looks good in tight clothing). Things go from bad to worse and the couple end up running for their lives thru a war torn country. We see them again re-united a few years later, on another assignement (Waxman's moral conciousness must have taken another break during that time). The job takes them to the top floor of an eery apartment building, still under construction. All is not what it seems though. Neither one trusts the other. The girl makes it clear she is ready to ""retire"" Waxman, should he fail to complete his job this time. And so, obviously,... they have sex (well, research does seem to support the notion that people who have sex during work time are happier in their employment; so, who are we to judge?). High action events take place that derail both characters and lead to a climax that is unexpected to the viewer. Not bad...Really...All the scenes for the second assignement are shot in the beautifully eery Algonquin Hotel in Montreal, Canada. The location heightens the feeling of isolation the two heroes experience; it sets the mood and works well to support the script, the story, and the character development. However, it is the manner in which the first assignement is shot that makes me knock down two stars off the rating. Naive set set-up, undisciplined and unenthused extras are just a couple of the issues. Unfortunately, we see these poorly produced scenes thruthout the entire movie, in form of flashbacks. With the $10-$15 mil budget these scenes have no right to be there...plain and simple. By contrast, Lundgren's ""Retrograde"" was shot for less then $2 mil, but with a more believable result! The end product is uneven, frustrating the viewer with its unrealized potential.Still, there is enough good action and decent acting on part of Lundgren and Bellman, to make this one of my favourite Dolph movies. When I fast forward thru all the flashbacks, I can almost get the feeling of watching a major motion picture.

427827,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,6304542887,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[7, 10]","Aaron Eckhart has been one of my favorite actors for years, he continually flies under the mainstream radar but makes every movie he is in, believable.The first time directors (Bernie/Melissa) tackled a familiar topic in the mid-life crisis film, but since they had AE to carry it, everything came across beautifully. AE plays our married man Bill, as he unhappily fills an undeserved in-law position at a bank. His wife is played by Liz Banks, who I love from Scrubs, that helps lead an amazing supporting cast, including Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood), Jessica Alba, and Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma).The story centers on Bill going through the motions of discovering marital infidelity, becoming a mentor for a smarter than his age school kid, while coming to terms with finding himself through some unorthodox avenues. Jessica Alba finally found a role that she was obviously relaxed with. Her entire presence was believable and she didn't have to wear a swimsuit, a tight blue suit or act scared - to do it. She does not play the love-interest as advertised, she just fills a role of helping out a new friend. I hope she does more films like this. Tim Olyphant has proven himself repeatedly, and I think even these slightly corny roles don't diminish his ability to be the hated character, yet still fun to watch.This film will not appeal to the teens or older crowds, but probably along the same customer lines as Thank You for Smoking, another great Eckhart film. Good for a low-key movie night for that guy that might be in that similar ""mid-life"" stage.

Throughout the movie, we learn about the tough situations in his life and how he deals with them (i.e. cheating wife, in-laws that only care about themselves), and feel badly for him, because his life just sucks.Then, our main character undergoes a sort of personality transformation: he stands up for himself, finally, and acts out against the man that his wife is cheating with, gets himself involved in a program to assist high school students with banking and during this, meets an outgoing student that helps him come out of his shell and learn how to have fun and not take any trash from anybody. Along the way, Eckhart continuously does a great job of acting the role of a nice guy that realizes it is time he put himself first, for the first time in his life, and go out to get what makes him happy. Plenty of drama and chaos ensues, all of which is very realistic and does not ever feel overblown or too coincidental to actually happen to a real person.The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Banks and Jessica Alba, both of whom perform well for the roles they were given.

427830,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304542887,trebe,"[0, 1]","Silent Trigger (1996) is a slick film that starts out with some promise, shrouds what it is really about for a while as it builds up some tension, and then erodes into complete silliness.Many times, Dolph Lundgren has played characters with depth that is paper thin, and this role another, as Lundgren plays a sniper who is part of an organization that engages in assassination.  Proper names are avoided, as Lundgren is the ""Shooter"", while Gina Beeman (Leverage) is similarly billed as ""Spotter"" for the task that her character performs.  The film opens crisply, with the Shooter and Spotter high up in a tower, preparing to assassinate a politician.  On her first mission, the Spotter provides information regarding range and the prevailing winds.  The target arrives, and mission control orders the Shooter to fire, but he refuses.  A chopper suddenly appears out of nowhere, opens fire on the tower, and drops soldiers down to the ground on ropes to attack.  Utilizing a 50 caliber sniper rifle, the Shooter downs the chopper in a nicely executed action sequence, and escapes with the Spotter.The film cuts away from this adventure, and proceeds to a new mission set at an unfinished building, in an unnamed city.  The situation makes almost no sense, as most of the spaces in the Algonquin tower are unfinished with open exterior walls, yet there is electrical power in some areas, including building security, located on the ground floor.  Two security guards are on duty, when the Spotter arrives in the rain, posing as a tech hired to work on computers located in the penthouse (really?).  In the elevator, she has to pull a gun, to fend off the advances of O'Hara (Christopher Heyerdahl), a guard high on cocaine.  Unknown to the Spotter, the Shooter has already entered the building, and is waiting for her in the penthouse.The reunion is unexpected, but the two professionals take things in stride.  What happened in the original mission is slowly revealed in a series of flashbacks.  While preparing for the new assignment, their main concerns are the other guard (Conrad Dunn), and an agitated O'Hara, who returns with the intention of taking revenge on the Spotter.Silent Trigger gets off to an exciting start, but begins to spiral down to a crash landing, once events begin to unfold in the Algonquin.  When a screenplay features the likes of O'Hara as the primary threat, you have a major problem.  The Shooter is supposed to be a pro, but sadly he proves to be quite inept, as the drug crazed nut gives him all he can handle.  Then instead of putting him out of commission, the Shooter handcuffs him to a toilet fixture, which then becomes a gag.The rest of the story is riddled with abject silliness, sure to disappoint anyone seeking some semblance of a credible plot.  Much of the action centers around the building's elevator.  Defying logic, the elevator shaft does not have a consistent look, as it actually changes its physical structure between various scenes.  What a mess!  This is another film with lighting in the elevator shaft, and the raised floor in the penthouse, also has lighting beneath it.  Cinematic perhaps, but like much in the film, utter drivel.Reflecting on the life they have chosen, the Spotter and Shooter find that they have feelings for each other, making love on the floor of the drafty penthouse.  Leaking water leads to the discovery that O'Hara has escaped, but upon returning to the penthouse, the once flooded corridor is now miraculously dry.  So much for continuity.  With O'Hara a threat to jeopardize the top secret mission, the Shooter does very little but relax.  With a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, the pair prepare to make the hit, and once again things do not go as planned.  As before, men suddenly drop down from above, setting the stage for a clumsily executed shootout.Gina Bellman is a step up in class, from the leading ladies typically appearing in Lundgren's films.  Her character could have had a more substantial role, but is mainly around for eye candy.  Often with damp hair, she spends much of the time as a damsel in distress, taking some heavy duty abuse.  She still manages to look damn good, and finally kicks some ass at the climax, but winds up soaking wet again, in a throwaway ending.  Somehow, Dolph Lundgren usually manages to come off as likeable onscreen, even though at times, as in this film, it seems like he isn't making the greatest effort.Unfortunately, even an inspired Lundgren performance, could not overcome the ridiculously bad screenplay.  Director Russel Mulcahy (Highlander) delivers a few tight action scenes, but the less than cogent plot, dooms what could have been a solid action adventure told in an interesting way.  The film does entertain, but loses touch with reality early on, and sadly drifts away into pure nonsense.  This is an outing where the Shooter never completes his mission, and his massive gun (the one used for sniping), is not employed as intended.",3,"could be retitled ""The Reluctant Triggerman""...",1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,4978,"['Silent', 'Trigger', '1996', 'slick', 'film', 'out', 'promise', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'while', 'up', 'tension', 'then', 'complete', 'silliness.Many', 'times', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'played', 'characters', 'depth', 'paper', 'thin', 'role', 'Lundgren', 'sniper', 'who', 'part', 'organization', 'assassination', 'Proper', 'names', 'are', 'avoided', 'Lundgren', 'Shooter', 'Gina', 'Beeman', 'Leverage', 'similarly', 'billed', 'Spotter', 'task', 'character', 'performs', 'film', 'crisply', 'Shooter', 'Spotter', 'high', 'up', 'tower', 'preparing', 'assassinate', 'politician', 'first', 'mission', 'Spotter', 'information', 'regarding', 'range', 'prevailing', 'winds', 'target', 'mission', 'control', 'orders', 'Shooter', 'fire', 'chopper', 'suddenly', 'nowhere', 'fire', 'tower', 'soldiers', 'down', 'ground', 'ropes', 'attack', 'Utilizing', '50', 'caliber', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'Shooter', 'chopper', 'nicely', 'executed', 'action', 'sequence', 'Spotter.The', 'film', 'cuts', 'away', 'adventure', 'proceeds', 'new', 'mission', 'set', 'unfinished', 'building', 'unnamed', 'city', 'situation', 'almost', 'sense', 'most', 'spaces', 'Algonquin', 'tower', 'are', 'unfinished', 'open', 'exterior', 'walls', 'yet', 'electrical', 'power', 'areas', 'including', 'building', 'security', 'located', 'ground', 'floor', 'Two', 'security', 'guards', 'are', 'duty', 'when', 'Spotter', 'rain', 'posing', 'tech', 'hired', 'work', 'computers', 'located', 'penthouse', 'really', 'elevator', 'pull', 'gun', 'fend', 'off', 'advances', ""O'Hara"", 'Christopher', 'Heyerdahl', 'guard', 'high', 'cocaine', 'Spotter', 'Shooter', 'already', 'entered', 'building', 'waiting', 'penthouse.The', 'reunion', 'unexpected', 'two', 'professionals', 'take', 'things', 'stride', 'What', 'happened', 'original', 'mission', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'preparing', 'new', 'assignment', 'main', 'concerns', 'are', 'other', 'guard', 'Conrad', 'Dunn', 'agitated', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'intention', 'taking', 'revenge', 'Spotter.Silent', 'Trigger', 'off', 'exciting', 'start', 'spiral', 'down', 'crash', 'landing', 'once', 'events', 'begin', 'unfold', 'Algonquin', 'When', 'screenplay', 'likes', ""O'Hara"", 'primary', 'threat', 'have', 'major', 'problem', 'Shooter', 'supposed', 'be', 'pro', 'sadly', 'be', 'quite', 'inept', 'drug', 'crazed', 'nut', 'can', 'handle', 'Then', 'instead', 'putting', 'commission', 'Shooter', 'handcuffs', 'toilet', 'fixture', 'then', 'gag.The', 'rest', 'story', 'riddled', 'abject', 'silliness', 'sure', 'disappoint', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'semblance', 'credible', 'plot', 'Much', 'action', 'centers', 'building', 'elevator', 'Defying', 'logic', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'not', 'have', 'consistent', 'look', 'actually', 'physical', 'structure', 'various', 'scenes', 'What', 'mess', 'film', 'lighting', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'raised', 'floor', 'penthouse', 'also', 'lighting', 'Cinematic', 'perhaps', 'much', 'film', 'utter', 'drivel.Reflecting', 'life', 'have', 'chosen', 'Spotter', 'Shooter', 'find', 'have', 'feelings', 'other', 'making', 'love', 'floor', 'drafty', 'penthouse', 'Leaking', 'water', 'discovery', ""O'Hara"", 'escaped', 'returning', 'penthouse', 'once', 'flooded', 'corridor', 'now', 'miraculously', 'dry', 'So', 'much', 'continuity', ""O'Hara"", 'threat', 'jeopardize', 'top', 'secret', 'mission', 'Shooter', 'very', 'little', 'relax', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'pair', 'prepare', 'make', 'hit', 'once', 'again', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'men', 'suddenly', 'drop', 'down', 'setting', 'stage', 'clumsily', 'executed', 'shootout.Gina', 'Bellman', 'step', 'up', 'class', 'leading', 'ladies', 'typically', 'appearing', 'Lundgren', 'films', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'mainly', 'eye', 'candy', 'damp', 'hair', 'much', 'time', 'damsel', 'distress', 'taking', 'heavy', 'duty', 'abuse', 'still', 'look', 'damn', 'good', 'finally', 'kicks', 'ass', 'climax', 'up', 'soaking', 'wet', 'again', 'throwaway', 'ending', 'Somehow', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'usually', 'come', 'off', 'likeable', 'onscreen', 'even', 'times', 'film', ""n't"", 'making', 'greatest', 'effort.Unfortunately', 'even', 'inspired', 'Lundgren', 'performance', 'could', 'not', 'overcome', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'Director', 'Russel', 'Mulcahy', 'Highlander', 'few', 'tight', 'action', 'scenes', 'less', 'cogent', 'plot', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'solid', 'action', 'adventure', 'told', 'interesting', 'way', 'film', 'entertain', 'touch', 'reality', 'early', 'sadly', 'drifts', 'away', 'pure', 'nonsense', 'outing', 'where', 'Shooter', 'never', 'mission', 'massive', 'gun', 'one', 'used', 'sniping', 'not', 'employed', 'intended']",Silent Trigger VHS

Aaron Eckhart plays him as a real slob and is generally an unappealing character throughout the film.The two most interesting actors in the film and who make this film worth watching are Logan Lerman (as The Kid), a 14 year old student who is mentoring with Bill but who reverses the mentorship and basically shows Bill how have to fun again.  Lerman plays the part exceedingly well, is tremendously believable and is consistently funny and a joy to watch.  (For some reason, Lerman gets almost no billing in spite of the fact that he has the second largest part in the movie after Bill.)  The other interesting actor is Jessica Alba who is simply beautiful and whose scenes with Lerman are a delight.Logan Lerman is clearly an actor to watch and I strongly suspect he's the next Shia LeBeouf.  I just hope he doesn't get dragged into those action thrillers that require very little acting as have many of our good actors (like Shia).",3,Lerman & Alba are the reasons to watch this film,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,1142,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'write', 'movie', 'reviews', 'other', 'reviews', 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'mark', 'feel', 'need', 'to.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Bill', 'guy', 'living', 'off', 'father-in-law', 'largess', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'real', 'slob', 'generally', 'unappealing', 'character', 'film.The', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'actors', 'film', 'who', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'are', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'Kid', '14', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'who', 'mentoring', 'Bill', 'who', 'mentorship', 'basically', 'shows', 'Bill', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'again', 'Lerman', 'part', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'tremendously', 'believable', 'consistently', 'funny', 'joy', 'watch', 'reason', 'Lerman', 'almost', 'billing', 'spite', 'fact', 'second', 'largest', 'part', 'movie', 'Bill', 'other', 'interesting', 'actor', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Lerman', 'are', 'delight.Logan', 'Lerman', 'clearly', 'actor', 'watch', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'next', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", 'get', 'dragged', 'action', 'thrillers', 'require', 'very', 'little', 'acting', 'as', 'have', 'many', 'good', 'actors', 'Shia']",Silent Trigger VHS

After watching about the first 15 minutes, both my fiancee and I were asking ourselves, ""How could ANYONE think this film is good?"" This is one of the WORST films I've ever watched. The opening sequence is great, but the rest of film moved at a snail's pace and the plot was absolutely pointless.  Yes, Mulcahy's style is great as in his other films, but he should have become a Director of Photography, NOT a director of people.  While Dolph is as good as Dolph typically gets in a film, the other actors were grade Z cast-offs (although it was fun to see 'Psycho' from ""Stripes"" working again, as a security guard), who delivered their lines as if they had memorized them five minutes before shooting.  There is BARELY ANY ACTION during the remainder of the film, and the flashback sequences show a plot which is just as lame as the story currently unfolding.  The female lead was simply not believable as a sniper.  I don't know how anybody was able to receive financing to film so stupid a story, but I guess the direct-to-DVD trade is only interested in making a profit of $-- the same amount of money I paid for this film at Wal-mart.  I was very disappointed, because I was all set to see a great Lundgren movie -- and I'm even madder at all the Amazon.com reviewers who whet my appetite with their great reviews.
