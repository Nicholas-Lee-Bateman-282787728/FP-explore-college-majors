1033764,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B000KGGIPU,Doug Park,"[7, 7]","{4.5 Stars}Some would-be viewers will avoid ""Vibrator"" simply because of the title; others will view it for that very reason. Either way, that could be a mistake. Don't get me wrong: There's some sex and passion here, but it's definitely NOT a ""nasty film"" per se. It's more a dual character study of two very different people who meet by accident and what they gain by doing so. Shinobu Terashima convincingly plays Rei, an introverted, hard-drinking, and reclusive writer who meets Takatoshi, a free-spirited, hard-edged, yet compassionate truck driver equally well-played by Nao Omori, and on a whim decides to ride with him on his rounds across the main Japanese island of Honshu. It's a quiet, subdued movie, and its wintertime scenery is bleakly beautiful.It's hard to review this film without making it sound dull and/or depressing, but I found it to be neither. Although it's funny in places, ""Vibrator""'s overall mood is simultaneously sad and uplifting. People who want lots of tension and dramatic action may be disappointed here: There's no violence, surprising reversals, or any of that kind of stuff. ""Vibrator"" remains, however, one of the most convincing and gripping slice-of-life pieces I have ever seen. There is something very genuine about the way it shows Rei getting out of herself in a much-needed way for just a little while. I sincerely wish that there were more films like ""Vibrator.""",5,Not What the Title Implies!,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1411,"['4.5', 'Stars', 'would-be', 'viewers', 'will', 'avoid', 'Vibrator', 'simply', 'title', 'others', 'will', 'view', 'very', 'reason', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'mistake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'sex', 'passion', 'here', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'nasty', 'film', 'se', 'more', 'dual', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'meet', 'accident', 'what', 'gain', 'doing', 'so', 'Shinobu', 'Terashima', 'convincingly', 'Rei', 'introverted', 'hard-drinking', 'reclusive', 'writer', 'who', 'Takatoshi', 'free-spirited', 'hard-edged', 'yet', 'compassionate', 'truck', 'driver', 'equally', 'well-played', 'Nao', 'Omori', 'whim', 'ride', 'rounds', 'main', 'Japanese', 'island', 'Honshu', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'movie', 'wintertime', 'scenery', 'bleakly', 'beautiful.It', 'hard', 'review', 'film', 'making', 'sound', 'dull', 'and/or', 'depressing', 'found', 'be', 'neither', 'funny', 'places', 'Vibrator', 'overall', 'mood', 'simultaneously', 'sad', 'uplifting', 'People', 'who', 'want', 'lots', 'tension', 'dramatic', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here', 'violence', 'surprising', 'reversals', 'kind', 'stuff', 'Vibrator', 'however', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', 'gripping', 'slice-of-life', 'pieces', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'very', 'genuine', 'way', 'Rei', 'getting', 'herself', 'much-needed', 'way', 'just', 'little', 'sincerely', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'films', 'Vibrator']",Vibrator

Yes there is a bit of sex here and there, but the main focus of the film is the gradual self-disclosures of two strangers riding the length of Japan in a delivery truck.  The interspersed silent-movie style 'cards' which carry our heroine's thoughts are very effective as emotional punctuations in their journey.
