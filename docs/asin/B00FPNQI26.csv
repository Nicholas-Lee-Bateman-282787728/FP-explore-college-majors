There are two rituals taking place here: the ritual of death, sacrifice of the innocent, and the broken ritual between Tom and Lovely (played oh so fetchingly by Lisa Marie Summerscales). We see all the brutality of the skull headed death mongers, but we never see behind the masks to their true intentions. Their true intentions are clear, they saturate the creepy gloomy Halloween night on which this takes place.

1672355,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00FPNQI26,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[0, 1]","I love satanic cult films. The 70s were the pinnacle of these movies (Racing with the Devil, The Devils Rain, Brotherhood of Satan are some of the better known classics) and I've been known to frequently complain that horror movie makers have forgotten about it. When House of the Devil came out, I was ecstatic. Lords of Salem, though not an exact fit, was also a high for me, tho I don't know why they cut it so much for the DVD/Blu release. So glad I saw it in the theatre. I never expected Ritual to hit the sweet spot. The trailer is not a good representation at all of the film. This is one of the few movies in a long time that had such a naturalistic feel, like I was peeping into someone's life. The actors really brought it. Both Tom and Lovely were very convincing and authentic. The plot kicks off right away (after the retrospective interlude on the beach, which I appreciated;; it gave me a feel for the characters' past that I could contrast with them in the present in a very simple, quick way). I also really appreciated how the backstory, though not a lot is really required for the movie, was organically interspersed in the dialogue. A great example of ""show, don't tell"". The plot kicks off and doesn't let up after that. Since I'm a horror junkie, and got hooked as a child,  its been a lonnng time since any movie ""scared"" me. I am very happy when a movie manages to generate good tension, where I find myself leaning forward, holding my breath at times, and engrossed in the happenings. Ritual succeeded in the tension department. I hope one day before I die, someone will make a movie that  ""scares"" me but till then I am grateful for tension. Usually, the French films are reliable that way. The story is simple and to the point. The technical aspects of the film were good, especially for a low budget feature (compared to many of them on here). The visuals and the audio were well done. I even watched all the way through the credits till it said ""The End"" (there were scenes interspersed throughout the credits- though nothing that changes the movie). I can see the filmmakers love for the genre and enjoyment in the making of it. Given the trend of bashing horror movies, even those which are technically strong, with good budgets, etc. I don't expect that this movie will get the appreciation it deserves, so I am driving the point home here: I loved it!  I hope I don't inflate expectations here, as its best to go in with low to none. Rarely does a movie match my very high expectations, so I try to tone them down. That is even more necessary for low budget, indie, streaming only horror flicks  If you are into Satanic cult flicks, then I can't imagine why you'd be dissatisfied with this one. Perhaps you won't be as thrilled as me but I can't imagine you feeling like it was a waste. On the other hand, if you rarely like a low budget, streaming horror flick, and you don't really get excited about the Devil, then you might not appreciate this one.",5,"Horror Junkie review: Lovely little Satanic cult film, If you are into these, step right up.",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2986,"['love', 'satanic', 'cult', 'films', '70s', 'were', 'pinnacle', 'movies', 'Racing', 'Devil', 'Devils', 'Rain', 'Brotherhood', 'Satan', 'are', 'better', 'known', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'frequently', 'complain', 'horror', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'forgotten', 'When', 'House', 'Devil', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'not', 'exact', 'fit', 'was', 'also', 'high', 'tho', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'cut', 'so', 'much', 'DVD/Blu', 'release', 'glad', 'saw', 'theatre', 'never', 'expected', 'Ritual', 'hit', 'sweet', 'spot', 'trailer', 'not', 'good', 'representation', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'naturalistic', 'feel', 'was', 'peeping', 'someone', 'life', 'actors', 'really', 'brought', 'Tom', 'Lovely', 'were', 'very', 'convincing', 'authentic', 'plot', 'off', 'right', 'away', 'retrospective', 'interlude', 'beach', 'appreciated', 'gave', 'feel', 'characters', 'could', 'contrast', 'present', 'very', 'simple', 'quick', 'way', 'also', 'really', 'appreciated', 'how', 'backstory', 'not', 'lot', 'really', 'required', 'movie', 'was', 'organically', 'interspersed', 'dialogue', 'great', 'example', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'plot', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', ""'m"", 'horror', 'junkie', 'got', 'hooked', 'child', 'been', 'lonnng', 'time', 'movie', 'scared', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'movie', 'generate', 'good', 'tension', 'where', 'find', 'leaning', 'forward', 'holding', 'breath', 'times', 'engrossed', 'happenings', 'Ritual', 'succeeded', 'tension', 'department', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'die', 'someone', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'scares', 'till', 'then', 'am', 'grateful', 'tension', 'Usually', 'French', 'films', 'are', 'reliable', 'way', 'story', 'simple', 'point', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'low', 'budget', 'feature', 'compared', 'many', 'here', 'visuals', 'audio', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'watched', 'way', 'credits', 'till', 'said', 'End', 'were', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'credits-', 'nothing', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'love', 'genre', 'enjoyment', 'making', 'Given', 'trend', 'bashing', 'horror', 'movies', 'even', 'are', 'technically', 'strong', 'good', 'budgets', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'appreciation', 'am', 'driving', 'point', 'home', 'here', 'loved', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'inflate', 'expectations', 'here', 'best', 'go', 'low', 'none', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'match', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'try', 'tone', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'necessary', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'streaming', 'only', 'horror', 'flicks', 'are', 'Satanic', 'cult', 'flicks', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', ""'d"", 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'thrilled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'feeling', 'was', 'waste', 'other', 'hand', 'rarely', 'low', 'budget', 'streaming', 'horror', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'excited', 'Devil', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'one']",Ritual Digital
1672356,A1JRSEI92D90J1,B00FPNQI26,Grelber37,"[1, 2]","Ritual gets four stars--for After Dark fans. Other viewers might give this horror flick a three. However, I watch After Dark Horrorfest offerings and AD Originals faithfully. Ritual is not as good as the stimulating and thought-provoking The Final, Rinne, and Dread. But, it is better than the boring The Abandoned and Nightmare Man. In quality, I would compare Ritual to the recent Dark Circles or The Reeds. It is something to watch that a horrorfan enjoys well enough.Certainly, the lead actors give strong performances. They are believable and empathetic as two damaged people trying to negotiate very weird circumstances straight out of the film Vacancy. Even in real life, what the hell would a person do if he had sickos on his trail and an existing mess in a motel room to take care of. A viewer gets into them and their story. I agree with other reviewers that actress Lisa Marie Summerscales rises to her role's challenges especially. Besides, the performances, I like Ritual's premise. This movie's horrors could and do really happen. That truth gets under a person's skin.However, I do think that Ritual could have openly presented more of its horrors. Instead, it mostly suggests them, perhaps for budgetary reasons. I want more horror imagery to go with my horror viewing. Also, Ritual borrows too often from better horror movies. The events imitate Vacancy, V/H/S, and House of the Devil, but Ritual fails to equal or exceed those fine films.Give Ritual a watch if you wish. Here, it was something to watch with some beer before bedtime.

1672358,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00FPNQI26,Joe Smart,"[3, 3]","Unsatisfying but occasionally striking horror film about a couple who are being pursued by some men in skeleton masks who may be satanists looking to complete a sacrifice--or just wackos who like to kill people while wearing creepy masks and videotaping it.If you're a certain kind of horror fan then as soon as you see Larry Fessenden's name in the opening credits you have a pretty good idea of what kind of horror movie to expect--brainy, low-budget and not a lot of action (despite the jokey warning that opens the film claiming that the movie contains graphic violence).Ritual can be pretty talky but once the couple find the video camera and what's recorded the movie manages to generate a fair amount of suspense with a minimum of resources.Still, Ritual is a bit too low-key for its own good and ultimately feels more like smart people screwing with you than a genuinely effective horror movie.  There's a lot of read in between the lines dialogue with the couple that suggests they have a violent past and may have what happens coming to them but the movie never fills in the blanks.  In fact we find out virtually nothing about either of the lead characters--which makes it hard to care much whether they live or die.Some people will likely love Ritual, if only because its a movie that assumes the audience is smart and very familiar with horror films.  Others will likely find it slow and boring--but if you do have the patience to sit through Ritual make sure to watch all the way through the end credits.",3,Ok rental,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1518,"['Unsatisfying', 'occasionally', 'striking', 'horror', 'film', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'pursued', 'men', 'skeleton', 'masks', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'satanists', 'looking', 'complete', 'sacrifice', 'just', 'wackos', 'who', 'kill', 'people', 'wearing', 'creepy', 'masks', 'videotaping', 'it.If', ""'re"", 'certain', 'kind', 'horror', 'fan', 'then', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'name', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'expect', 'brainy', 'low-budget', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'jokey', 'warning', 'film', 'claiming', 'movie', 'graphic', 'violence', '.Ritual', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'talky', 'once', 'couple', 'find', 'video', 'camera', 'what', 'recorded', 'movie', 'generate', 'fair', 'amount', 'suspense', 'minimum', 'resources.Still', 'Ritual', 'bit', 'too', 'low-key', 'own', 'good', 'ultimately', 'more', 'smart', 'people', 'screwing', 'genuinely', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'lot', 'read', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'couple', 'have', 'violent', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'what', 'coming', 'movie', 'never', 'blanks', 'fact', 'find', 'out', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'lead', 'characters', 'hard', 'care', 'much', 'live', 'die.Some', 'people', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'Ritual', 'only', 'movie', 'audience', 'smart', 'very', 'familiar', 'horror', 'films', 'Others', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'slow', 'boring', 'do', 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'Ritual', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'credits']",Ritual Digital

The reason I mention this is to alert the possible viewer so they won't be duped by all the possible fraudulent high ratings and will review the other repeat reviewers honest reviews.On with this movie. It is a Indie film with a limited budget as is the case for most Indie films. It is mainly shot from either a vehicle or a hotel room as the primary backdrops for most of the movie.  We have two primary lead characters who are in a troubled marriage.  The (ex)wife goes out looking for a hookup, love, career or whatever. The wife gets into some serious trouble and calls the husband to extract her from her predicament. They find out that she was targeted for ? This pretty much sums up what gets the pair in trouble with the ??? and is the basic storyline for this movie.The concept of the story is promising and the acting is decent (the female gets annoying at times) taking into consideration the budget, director, actor experience and so on.The three things that ruin this movie is the director/writer, lighting and the who's, what's and why's these cultists are and why they do what they do. The director lets many of the scenes run way to long and ruins the tension/mood or suspense of the scene. The very dim lighting or blacked out scenes are used to set the tone or mood, but many scenes are just to dimly lit or blacked out to be effective. The director and writer don't really give us very much info on this cult and will leave you wondering what was the purpose of telling us only part of the story when its the title of the story??? We are never given any payment for watching the movie to its conclusion? By that I mean we never really witness the full intent (other than the obvious) of the Rituals nor do we ever know who these guy's are or why they do what they do ???The directors take on the fight for life scene with a firearm was terribly executed and looked foolish especially considering the males firearm experience and background that we are specifically informed of .There is some fairly violent fight scenes with some gore and blood, but not over the top and surprisingly there is a total lack of nudity in this movie. The viewer is exposed to a good amount of cursing including the F word throughout the movie.Overall I will give this 2 generous stars.
