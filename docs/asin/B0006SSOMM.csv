I absolutely loved the early seasons when Matthew Macfadyen was the chief spy for British Intelligence's MI-5.  In the UK, these agents are popularly called spooks, which is the title for the show there.  However, Macfadyen got the opportunity to do movies  and left the show.  I lasted one season after that.  I didn't like that season as much but I liked it ok.  Then they got rid of the other actors I'd liked.  I tried watching the most recent season, now starring Richard Armitage and Hermine Norris.  I couldn't get into it, even though I normally like those actors.  I found its newest incarnation too convoluted and got sick of watching it.  I believe that Macfadyen provided a necessary focus and center to the show and that aspect disappeared when he left.  While he was on, he was an incredibly strong and together spy and he was very believable.  His personal life was a disaster.  He was arrogant.  He was a terrific leader.  With him at the center of this series, it was the best spy show I'd ever seen.  There was a level of realism here that was never tried before. Spies also died and missions didn't always succeed, just like they do in real life. I can't recommend the series strongly enough if Matthew Macfadyen is in the series as its lead, which he is in these first ones. I can't otherwise as I gave up on it myself.",5,Watch the Early Seasons with Matthew Macfadyen in the Lead,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,1424,"['reading', 'here', 'Amazon', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'alone', 'where', 'stand', 'show', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'early', 'seasons', 'when', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'was', 'chief', 'spy', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'MI-5', 'UK', 'agents', 'are', 'popularly', 'called', 'spooks', 'title', 'show', 'there', 'However', 'Macfadyen', 'got', 'opportunity', 'do', 'movies', 'left', 'show', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'much', 'liked', 'ok.', 'Then', 'got', 'rid', 'other', 'actors', ""'d"", 'liked', 'tried', 'watching', 'most', 'recent', 'season', 'now', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Hermine', 'Norris', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'even', 'normally', 'actors', 'found', 'newest', 'incarnation', 'too', 'convoluted', 'got', 'sick', 'watching', 'believe', 'Macfadyen', 'provided', 'necessary', 'focus', 'center', 'show', 'aspect', 'disappeared', 'when', 'left', 'was', 'was', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'together', 'spy', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'disaster', 'was', 'arrogant', 'was', 'terrific', 'leader', 'center', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'spy', 'show', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'level', 'realism', 'here', 'was', 'never', 'tried', 'Spies', 'also', 'died', 'missions', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'just', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'strongly', 'enough', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'series', 'lead', 'first', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'gave', 'up']",N/A

After seeing the new Pride & Prejudice I looked up Matthew Macfadyen for some of his other work and what did I find but MI-5 infiltrating Spooks. I love this drama and truly, after a couple of episodes I even keep up with some of the dodgy dialogue. Due to the nature of the espionage world (as I imagine it) killing off main players only makes sense; although I am always shocked by it. If these people didn't die rather frequently given what they do I would definitely be able to sleep. Which I don't. Until the entire 3 seasons are over, I will be zombified. How many hours did they say this thing runs?? Bleah. Man I love Brit TV.

And my favorites are these early series, when Matthew MacFadyen was still in it.  I liked the later series too, but the best were the ones with him.  Each episode has you on the edge of your seat.  And you cannot have it on and do other things.  Whenever I tried that, I had to just begin all over and sit down and pay close attention and have the sound turned up, because you really have to pay close attention to figure everything out and to know what is going on.  I think our series '24' sort of followed this.  They aren't the same show, but it does look like 24 came from many aspects of this British TV series.  And these early ones have Jenny Agutter.  I like Peter Firth - he is the charcter that stays consistent, as much of the rest of the cast changes in later series. Love the guy that plays 'Danny'.  It's a great cast.",4,mi-5 doen't disappoint,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,900,"['MI-5', 'was', 'PBS', 'awhile', 'got', 'hooked', 'great', 'show', 'favorites', 'are', 'early', 'series', 'when', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'was', 'still', 'liked', 'later', 'series', 'too', 'best', 'were', 'ones', 'episode', 'edge', 'seat', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'Whenever', 'tried', 'had', 'just', 'begin', 'sit', 'down', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'have', 'sound', 'turned', 'up', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'think', 'series', ""'24"", 'sort', 'followed', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'show', 'look', '24', 'came', 'many', 'aspects', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'early', 'ones', 'have', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'like', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'charcter', 'consistent', 'much', 'rest', 'cast', 'changes', 'later', 'series', 'Love', 'guy', ""'Danny"", 'great', 'cast']",N/A

873746,A28N4K0G83YL92,B0006SSOMM,Megan,"[0, 0]","I purchased season one of MI-5 based on other customer reviews, and I have to admit that I was disappointed with the first season.  (I have purchased but not yet viewed seasons 2, 3, and 7.)  While I understand there is a great difference between British dramas and American dramas, I was disappointed that there were only six episodes in the first season (and I thought the price of the series was high for only six episodes, though they are a full 59 minutes each).  Even though the actors are well cast, for the most part, I was not really interested in their personal lives (which could be due to poor back stories).  I found the character who played Ellie (Tom Quinn/Matthew Archer's girlfriend) to be annoying but her daughter was more so and I was frustrated that Tom Quinn's secret profession as a spy was not kept from her.  (I think the plot would have been more intriguing if he had never told her who he really was.)  Aside from a cameo from Hugh Laurie and another from Anthony Head, the first season seems to lack any real depth.  As an avid watcher (and owner) of the full series of ALIAS, I think I was comparing the shows in their plots and character development.  While ALIAS focuses more on the technology and the secret lives of the characters, MI-5 focuses more on what's at stake for Britain; while this is an interesting premise for a show, I felt that the plots in season one were sometimes weak and uninteresting (and echoed movies and other shows I had seen).  I'm hoping that subsequent seasons are more intriguing and I'm looking forward to the inclusion of Rupert Penry-Jones in season three.",2,Disappointing first season,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1621,"['purchased', 'season', 'one', 'MI-5', 'based', 'other', 'customer', 'reviews', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'purchased', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed', 'seasons', '2', '3', '7', 'understand', 'great', 'difference', 'British', 'dramas', 'American', 'dramas', 'was', 'disappointed', 'were', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'thought', 'price', 'series', 'was', 'high', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'full', '59', 'minutes', 'Even', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'personal', 'lives', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'poor', 'back', 'stories', 'found', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'Ellie', 'Tom', 'Quinn/Matthew', 'Archer', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'annoying', 'daughter', 'was', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'frustrated', 'Tom', 'Quinn', 'secret', 'profession', 'spy', 'was', 'not', 'kept', 'think', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intriguing', 'had', 'never', 'told', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'Aside', 'cameo', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'first', 'season', 'lack', 'real', 'depth', 'avid', 'watcher', 'owner', 'full', 'series', 'ALIAS', 'think', 'was', 'comparing', 'shows', 'plots', 'character', 'development', 'ALIAS', 'more', 'technology', 'secret', 'lives', 'characters', 'MI-5', 'focuses', 'more', 'what', 'stake', 'Britain', 'interesting', 'premise', 'show', 'felt', 'plots', 'season', 'one', 'were', 'sometimes', 'weak', 'uninteresting', 'echoed', 'movies', 'other', 'shows', 'had', 'seen', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'are', 'more', 'intriguing', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'inclusion', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'season', 'three']",N/A
