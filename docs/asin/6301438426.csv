But Ghoul School comes nowhere near the surprisingly good Boo Brothers or Reluctant Werewolf and is so far behind modern Scooby Doo animation. It really is the cheapest, shoddiest Scooby effort I've ever seen.There isn't even a mystery, thus explaining the lack of the Mystery Machine (an ugly red van is the replacement). So why on earth they bothered to make this a Scooby Doo movie is puzzling if they weren't deliberately exploiting a popular character.It's just all wrong! Shaggy gets a job in an all-girl (actually Ghoul) school teaching Phys. Ed. I'm sorry but when did Shaggy become a qualified Gym Teacher? There's some pointless story involving a volleyball competition with a Military School next door that isn't good enough to distract from the bore and then after that some old hag called Revolta turns up and turns them all into zombies. Uh...yeah.Shaggy obviously saves the day but by this point I had dozed off. It bored me to sleep!The 1.33:1 full frame picture shows how cruddy the animation is and the sound is plain old mono.

253061,A1EX4410F46C8O,6301438426,"Matt32 ""LIGHT WEIGHT""","[1, 4]","So the basic overview of this Scooby movie is this:  Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy are all hired on to a finishing school for girls (ghouls such as werewolves, mummies, vampires, and frankensteins in this case) to be a volley ball coach.  They finally get over the fear of their strange company and become at home.  However, an evil witch named Revolta is trying to take control of the girls and their powers.  That is basically it.  Bland right?First of all, I don't care for Scooby and Shaggy being stand-alone characters.  They are great characters, but they need the support of Mystery Inc.  There is nothing wrong with that, there are just some characters that are supposed to be part of a whole group or they don't work.  The attempt to pad this with having Scrappy Doo come along is disappointing.  It doesn't feel complete.As one reviewer pointed out, there are many plot holes.  There is no mystery, so the story line seems to be distracting in itself.  Nothing really matches up.  Shaggy has never been athletic so why is he all of a sudden a coach?The very fabric of Scooby Doo is ripped apart by this movie.  Until now, I believe all the villians have simply been bad guys in masks.  Yes, real monsters have worked as in Zombie Island or the live action movie, but here its so out of sorts.  It doesn't even feel like Scooby Doo, but rather a bad spin-off.  What if a movie was made about Alfred from Batman selling time shares in Australia?  Doesn't make sense right?  Really out of place?  Thats the feeling that Ghoul School sends.Oh my God if you want bad puns this is the place for you!  Every single line (no exaggeration) has one!  The writers must have really thought they were on their game when they did this.  It makes the movie unwatchable for the older crowd.My first impression was this Scooby Doo is aimed at a WAY young audience but I'll be honest, its a little bit creepy for younger kids.  Even the heroes are disturbing.  I think young children will have a problem handling Revolta and Creeper.  While most Scoobys are lighthearted, this one deals with a real diabolical subject.  I would avoid getting this to entertain the little ones.  And that puts this movie in a bad place; too immature for older audiences too dark for younger children.  So who is left to watch this?  No one.Honestly, I have to say avoid picking up this (and Arabian Nights).  Its going to be a disappointment.  If you are a collector of Scooby Doo movies like myself, then maybe its worth it.

He may have been more cautious, but the character seemed so much more nicer than any of the other ""meddling kids"".Thus, despite the inclusion of Scrappy (the reason for the taking away two stars) I actually found a lot to like about the movie.Apparently fusing the ""Adams Family"" (the ghoulish stuff) with the ""Facts of Life"" (the movie is also a comedy about an exclusive girls boarding school)this addition to the Scooby cannon is very creative. There are some slow moments in the screenplay, but they do not detract from the overall plot (which has some lessons about women's educational equality hidden throughout the film).Shaggy, Scooby (and unfortunatley, Scrappy) head to a ""ghouls finnishing school"" where Shaggy will be working as a coach and instructor for the children of Hollywood's most famous and infamous classic monsters. Even though it is never revealed what educational training and professional background Shaggy has, it is clear throughout the film that he is serious about doing a good job in his new role and does not consider teaching at an all-girls (he intially believes the instituion is for humans)is any less important or serious.Befitting his afforementioned non-critical nature, Shaggy is truly the most tolerant human in the scooby gang--neither the gender or monster status of his students (or their parents) matters as much as the fact they are happy and safe. Here we see the best side of a historically underutilized character, who clearly demonstrates leadership skills in his own right (when it would have been easier to pack up and leave the school at the first inkling of trouble).Yes, the plot is light compared to other products in the scooby empire (even if the villan in this installation is actually supernatural) but this video is supposes to be more about tolerance than the supernatural underworld.For delivering such a message on a level all audience can understand without being condescending, the video deserves it's three stars.",3,"Finally, Shaggy comes into his own as a hero",1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,2125,"['Having', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'always', 'concerned', 'Shaggy', 'was', 'too', 'frequently', 'picked', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'cautious', 'character', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'nicer', 'other', 'meddling', 'kids', '.Thus', 'inclusion', 'Scrappy', 'reason', 'taking', 'away', 'two', 'stars', 'actually', 'found', 'lot', 'like', 'movie.Apparently', 'fusing', 'Adams', 'Family', 'ghoulish', 'stuff', 'Facts', 'Life', 'movie', 'also', 'comedy', 'exclusive', 'girls', 'boarding', 'school', 'addition', 'Scooby', 'cannon', 'very', 'creative', 'are', 'slow', 'moments', 'screenplay', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'overall', 'plot', 'lessons', 'women', 'educational', 'equality', 'hidden', 'film', '.Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'unfortunatley', 'Scrappy', 'head', 'ghouls', 'finnishing', 'school', 'where', 'Shaggy', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'coach', 'instructor', 'children', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'famous', 'infamous', 'classic', 'monsters', 'Even', 'never', 'revealed', 'what', 'educational', 'training', 'professional', 'background', 'Shaggy', 'clear', 'film', 'serious', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'new', 'role', 'not', 'consider', 'teaching', 'all-girls', 'intially', 'instituion', 'humans', 'less', 'important', 'serious.Befitting', 'afforementioned', 'non-critical', 'nature', 'Shaggy', 'truly', 'most', 'tolerant', 'human', 'scooby', 'gang', 'gender', 'monster', 'status', 'students', 'parents', 'matters', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'are', 'happy', 'safe', 'Here', 'see', 'best', 'side', 'historically', 'underutilized', 'character', 'who', 'clearly', 'leadership', 'skills', 'own', 'right', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'pack', 'up', 'leave', 'school', 'first', 'inkling', 'trouble', '.Yes', 'plot', 'light', 'compared', 'other', 'products', 'scooby', 'empire', 'even', 'villan', 'installation', 'actually', 'supernatural', 'video', 'supposes', 'be', 'more', 'tolerance', 'supernatural', 'underworld.For', 'delivering', 'message', 'level', 'audience', 'can', 'understand', 'being', 'condescending', 'video', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
