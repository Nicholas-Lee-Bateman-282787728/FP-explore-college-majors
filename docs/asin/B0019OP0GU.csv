1164590,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0019OP0GU,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","The BBC's Christmas offering for 2007 was this charming version of BALLET SHOES, based on the Noel Streatfeild novel which I remember with particular fondness from my own childhood.  Despite a few shortcomings, this is a well-scripted and beautifully-cast production which I'm sure will capture the imaginations of all those who remember the original story.World explorer Great Uncle Matthew (or ""Gum""), played by Richard Griffiths, brings home a few extra packages from three of his trips - namely three orphan babies.  Raised by his niece Sylvia (Emilia Fox) and her Nanny (Victoria Wood), the babies grow up into charming young girls with definite ideas about their eventual fates in the history books.Pauline (Emma Watson) wishes to be an actress, Petrova (Yasmin Paige) is crazy about aeroplanes; whilst Posy (Lucy Boynton) wants to be a dancer.  But when ""Gum"" disappears without trace on one of his expeditions, money becomes tight.  Sylvia arranges to rent out some of the larger rooms in their house to lodgers, one of which, Theo Dane (Lucy Cohu) is a teacher at a children's stage academy run by the formidable Madame Fidolia (Dame Eileen Atkins).  The school doesn't charge tuition fees for its working-class pupils, instead collecting a small percentage of the wage when a child is hired out for a stage engagement.  Pretty soon, Pauline and Posy are caught up in the exciting world of show-business, and, realising that there's no such thing as a 14-year-old aviatrix, Petrova half-heartedly tags along.The main issue with this BALLET SHOES is length.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas had a tough assignment in condensing down the events of the book into a 90-minute film (the original book does cover an awful lot of ground) and there are perhaps too many subplots to weave into the narrative; including Sylvia and Mr Simpson (Marc Warren), and the other lodgers Dr Jakes and Dr Smith (brilliantly played by Gemma Jones and Harriet Walter).  The ending feels particularly rushed.  There is an earlier 1975 miniseries (which featured Emilia Fox's mother Joanna David as Theo), and I feel that the 2007 film could have been stronger if it was presented as a longer miniseries, allowing all of the characters the chance to expand and have their own special moments to shine.Fans of the novel will probably lament at what has been left on the cutting-room floor but this is an altogether-delightful film version of BALLET SHOES, despite its shortcomings.",4,delightful screen version of the classic 30's novel,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,2459,"['BBC', 'Christmas', 'offering', '2007', 'was', 'charming', 'version', 'BALLET', 'SHOES', 'based', 'Noel', 'Streatfeild', 'novel', 'remember', 'particular', 'fondness', 'own', 'childhood', 'few', 'shortcomings', 'well-scripted', 'beautifully-cast', 'production', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'capture', 'imaginations', 'who', 'remember', 'original', 'story.World', 'explorer', 'Great', 'Uncle', 'Matthew', 'Gum', 'played', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'home', 'few', 'extra', 'packages', 'three', 'trips', 'namely', 'three', 'orphan', 'babies', 'Raised', 'niece', 'Sylvia', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'Nanny', 'Victoria', 'Wood', 'babies', 'grow', 'up', 'charming', 'young', 'girls', 'definite', 'ideas', 'eventual', 'fates', 'history', 'books.Pauline', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'be', 'actress', 'Petrova', 'Yasmin', 'Paige', 'crazy', 'aeroplanes', 'Posy', 'Lucy', 'Boynton', 'be', 'dancer', 'when', 'Gum', 'trace', 'one', 'expeditions', 'money', 'becomes', 'tight', 'Sylvia', 'rent', 'out', 'larger', 'rooms', 'house', 'lodgers', 'one', 'Theo', 'Dane', 'Lucy', 'Cohu', 'teacher', 'children', 'stage', 'academy', 'run', 'formidable', 'Madame', 'Fidolia', 'Dame', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'school', ""n't"", 'charge', 'tuition', 'fees', 'working-class', 'pupils', 'instead', 'collecting', 'small', 'percentage', 'wage', 'when', 'child', 'hired', 'out', 'stage', 'engagement', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Pauline', 'Posy', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'exciting', 'world', 'show-business', 'realising', 'such', 'thing', '14-year-old', 'aviatrix', 'Petrova', 'half-heartedly', 'along.The', 'main', 'issue', 'BALLET', 'SHOES', 'length', 'Screenwriter', 'Heidi', 'Thomas', 'had', 'tough', 'assignment', 'condensing', 'down', 'events', 'book', '90-minute', 'film', 'original', 'book', 'cover', 'awful', 'lot', 'ground', 'are', 'perhaps', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'weave', 'narrative', 'including', 'Sylvia', 'Mr', 'Simpson', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'other', 'lodgers', 'Dr', 'Jakes', 'Dr', 'Smith', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'ending', 'feels', 'particularly', 'rushed', 'earlier', '1975', 'miniseries', 'featured', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'mother', 'Joanna', 'David', 'Theo', 'feel', '2007', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'was', 'presented', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'allowing', 'characters', 'chance', 'expand', 'have', 'own', 'special', 'moments', 'shine.Fans', 'novel', 'will', 'probably', 'lament', 'been', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'altogether-delightful', 'film', 'version', 'BALLET', 'SHOES', 'shortcomings']",Ballet Shoes

This movie is just a good story about women trying to make it on their own after the war in London.  The Fossil sisters were all foundlings of a collector of all things paleontology.  They grew up in a big old grand London house alongside trilobites and T Rex until those treasures had to go to make room for the growing girls.Petrova wants to be like Amy Johnson when she grows up.  I think Amy Johnson must've been the British Amelia Earhart.  Posy was found with only a pair of pink toe shoes when she was a baby, her mother having been a young ballerina who had neither resources nor time to care for her child.  And the oldest is a stage natural.  These three girls live a life filled with love and possibility, if not one of materialism.  Still, their needs are always met and the girls receive great educations and theatre training.  IN fact, everything in this movie seems to be blessed and appointed by Providence.  Every time they have a need, it's magically filled by strangers literally at the door.

She's breathtaking. It was nice seeing her in a movie outside Harry Potter.  She proved that she can act.  Brains and beauty.  Her character goes through the movie to be onstage and acting. When she becomes real famous she turns a bit into a brat and selfish. She pushes Petrova in acting just to help her own place in theater. Once the lead female role in Alice in wonderland is given to her understudy she realizes her bratty ways and selfishness has gone too far and makes her readjust herself to be more humble and giving.The cast was pretty good and I liked the ensemble for the most part.  It has a decent ending I guess with an overall lesson I guess which is Dreams Do Come True.The DVD includes deleted scenes and about a 20-25 minute interview with Emma Watson about the movie which I enjoyed very much.Definitely worth picking up if you are fan of the book(which I never read) or like Emma Watson like me.

1164593,A3M4C2VDWYJSSA,B0019OP0GU,Compusurge,"[64, 64]","BALLET SHOES (starring Emma Watson... celebrated for her lead roles in the Harry Potter films...along with an all-star acclaimed ensemble cast) is absolutely wonderful. I personally am in love it. Targeting a very large and underserved audience which is best defined as ""moms and their daughters"", Ballet Shoes is a film about realizing ambitions; a film where its tag line `dreams do come true' is really the `spot on' underlying message of the film... and the storyline. I believe it is destined to be a huge success for it is a tale of inspiration indeed.A big-budget Granada film production, originally for the BBC, Ballet Shoes is based on the literary classic penned by Noel Streatfeild that women especially are very familiar with as key reading material from their childhood. A costume drama with absolutely stunning cinematography, the film portrays 1930's London with a sense of dreamy realism. For those who recall the box office smash ""You've Got Mail"", the book is the one being sought after that Meg Ryan launches into a verbal expose about. Ms. Ryan was right on the money, as is this adaptation of the tale.Ballet Shoes is the story of three orphan girls; Petrova, Posie and Pauline (Emma Watson) who are raised as sisters after being brought together by a rich, world traveler as babies. As they grow up, each girl develops a dream of their own. Pauline wants to be an actress; Petrova longs to be an aviator; Posie wishes to dance. Circumstances bring them together, and together they vow to go down in the history books. ""We three Fossils vow..."". This vow launches the three Fossil sisters on their voyage, a journey that they travel individually as well as together, one that can only serve to inspire any young girl who watches the film.On a personal note, I watched this film with my 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son. While my son fought to pay attention (not surprising), my daughter was riveted throughout the film. The appearance of `Hermoine' as a teen brought her into focus early on, and then the tale itself kept her eyes and ears wide open. She's asked repeatedly to watch Ballet Shoes again, which of course she has. My son, of course, is back to watching `his thing', Spiderman, Superman and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers...Ballet Shoes, in a certain sense, is a long form faerie tale, and I recommend it with no reservations whatsoever as superb family viewing.",5,superb family viewing....,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,2408,"['BALLET', 'SHOES', 'starring', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'celebrated', 'lead', 'roles', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'along', 'all-star', 'acclaimed', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'personally', 'am', 'love', 'Targeting', 'very', 'large', 'underserved', 'audience', 'best', 'defined', 'moms', 'daughters', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'film', 'realizing', 'ambitions', 'film', 'where', 'tag', 'line', 'dreams', 'do', 'come', 'true', 'really', 'spot', 'underlying', 'message', 'film', 'storyline', 'believe', 'destined', 'be', 'huge', 'success', 'tale', 'inspiration', 'indeed.A', 'big-budget', 'Granada', 'film', 'production', 'originally', 'BBC', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'based', 'literary', 'classic', 'penned', 'Noel', 'Streatfeild', 'women', 'especially', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'key', 'reading', 'material', 'childhood', 'costume', 'drama', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'film', '1930', 'London', 'sense', 'dreamy', 'realism', 'who', 'recall', 'box', 'office', 'smash', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'book', 'one', 'being', 'sought', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'verbal', 'expose', 'Ms.', 'Ryan', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'adaptation', 'tale.Ballet', 'Shoes', 'story', 'three', 'orphan', 'girls', 'Petrova', 'Posie', 'Pauline', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'who', 'are', 'raised', 'sisters', 'being', 'brought', 'together', 'rich', 'world', 'traveler', 'babies', 'grow', 'up', 'girl', 'dream', 'own', 'Pauline', 'be', 'actress', 'Petrova', 'longs', 'be', 'aviator', 'Posie', 'dance', 'Circumstances', 'bring', 'together', 'together', 'vow', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'books', 'three', 'Fossils', 'vow', 'vow', 'three', 'Fossil', 'sisters', 'voyage', 'journey', 'travel', 'individually', 'as', 'well', 'together', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'serve', 'inspire', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'film.On', 'personal', 'note', 'watched', 'film', '8', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '6', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'son', 'fought', 'pay', 'attention', 'not', 'surprising', 'daughter', 'was', 'riveted', 'film', 'appearance', 'Hermoine', 'teen', 'brought', 'focus', 'early', 'then', 'tale', 'kept', 'eyes', 'ears', 'wide', 'open', 'asked', 'repeatedly', 'watch', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'again', 'course', 'My', 'son', 'course', 'back', 'watching', 'thing', 'Spiderman', 'Superman', 'Adventures', 'Galaxy', 'Rangers', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'certain', 'sense', 'long', 'form', 'faerie', 'tale', 'recommend', 'reservations', 'whatsoever', 'superb', 'family', 'viewing']",Ballet Shoes

He gives them the surname ""Fossils"" due to his penchant for paleontology. Uncle Matthew goes off on another of his many, lengthy adventures leaving the girls in the care of his niece Sylvia (AKA ""Garnie"" or Guardian to the girls)and Nana (Sylvia's nurse when she was a child).The women are forced to open the large London home to an interesting group of borders in order to make ends meet in Matthew's absence. The girls are also sent to dancing school in the hopes of honing some marketable skills. The three girls have very different aspirations (Pauline-acting, Petrova-aviation, and Posy-ballet) but they make a pact to put themselves in the history books and help their Garnie and Nana support the household.What I liked ---The film is very well done with a cast of memorable characters and witty dialogue.-I also found that it communicated good life lessons. For example, Pauline chooses to become a spoiled prima donna while acting in a play and the director demotes her to understudy.-The film also puts an emphasis on the values of hard work and family.-A happy ending.What I did not like --It was such a cute movie that it is really hard to pick it apart and find something not likable.Overall, I would highly recommend this film to any fans of family friendly films or BBC dramas.",4,A charming and well crafted tale,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1491,"['Set', '1930', 'London', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'story', 'three', 'orphans', 'Pauline', 'Petrova', 'Posy', 'who', 'are', 'found', 'Uncle', 'Matthew', 'known', 'Great', 'Uncle', 'Matthew', 'GUM', 'eccentric', 'adventurer', 'surname', 'Fossils', 'due', 'penchant', 'paleontology', 'Uncle', 'Matthew', 'off', 'many', 'lengthy', 'adventures', 'leaving', 'girls', 'care', 'niece', 'Sylvia', 'AKA', 'Garnie', 'Guardian', 'girls', 'Nana', 'Sylvia', 'nurse', 'when', 'was', 'child', '.The', 'women', 'are', 'forced', 'open', 'large', 'London', 'home', 'interesting', 'group', 'borders', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Matthew', 'absence', 'girls', 'are', 'also', 'sent', 'dancing', 'school', 'hopes', 'honing', 'marketable', 'skills', 'three', 'girls', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'aspirations', 'Pauline-acting', 'Petrova-aviation', 'Posy-ballet', 'make', 'pact', 'put', 'history', 'books', 'help', 'Garnie', 'Nana', 'support', 'household.What', 'liked', '-The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'cast', 'memorable', 'characters', 'witty', 'dialogue.-I', 'also', 'found', 'communicated', 'good', 'life', 'lessons', 'example', 'Pauline', 'become', 'spoiled', 'prima', 'donna', 'acting', 'play', 'director', 'understudy.-The', 'film', 'also', 'emphasis', 'values', 'hard', 'work', 'family.-A', 'happy', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'such', 'cute', 'movie', 'really', 'hard', 'pick', 'apart', 'find', 'something', 'not', 'likable.Overall', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'family', 'friendly', 'films', 'BBC', 'dramas']",Ballet Shoes

Peck,"[0, 0]","BALLET SHOES is a 2007 British television film, based on a 1936 novel by Noel Streatfeild, with screenplay by Heidi Thomas, and directed by Sandra Goldbacher.Set in 1930's London, the film tells the stoy of three orphans adopted by an explorer and paleontologist, Uncle Matthew ""Gum"".  The girls live in near poverty in his house with his niece, Silvia Brown, and her former nanny, Nana.  The story describes the girls' struggles to fulfill their dreams: Pauline as an actress, Petrova as an aviatrix, and Posy as a ballerina.  To help make ends meet, Silvia and Nana take in boarders.  Still, the household needs the wages of Pauline as an actress and Petrova as an extra, putting additional weight on their shoulders.The film can teach young viewers some valudable lessions, such as the good and bad aspects of ambition, the need for perseverance in hard times, and the pitfalls of a swelled head. And for adult viewers, there is the acting!  Emilia Fox, Victoria Wood, Eileen Atkins, and Emma Watson are the leads.  Yasmin Paige and Lucy Boynton are the younger sisters.

1164610,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B0019OP0GU,mk,"[6, 6]","What a delightful adaptation of Mary Noel Streatfeild's(1895-1986)story.  She was an actress and prolific writer who very much wanted to provide children with worthwhile reading.  J.K. Rowling is a fan, and there's a few Potter alumni actors in this entertaining fable.A paleontologist(Richard Griffiths, who plays Harry Potter's dunderheaded relative) first adopts Sylvia(Emilia Fox, whom I'll always remember as Georgiana Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice' and simply love).  He complains about it but moves out some dinosaur bones to make room; however, ""Great Uncle Gum"" repeats the process, bringing home three more orphaned, baby girls from various expeditions.  Sylvia cares for them in his museum-like home while he vanishes for twelve years.  Move ahead to the 1930's.  Money runs thin, and the girls make a pact to excel in their endeavors and to help their beleaguered, older sister save the home.  They take in some eccentric boarders and attend a dance academy as they try to discover their gifts and means.The ensemble cast shines.  If you have ever watched BBC or Masterpiece Theatre you'll recognize many of these journeyman actors such as the great Gemma Jones(Dr. Jakes).  In regards to the younger actors, obviously, there's Emma Watson(Pauline) from 'Harry Potter' fame who portrays the thespian talent of the family.  Her character struggles with insecurity and pride, and Emma does a fine job expanding out beyond 'Hermione'.  She candidly talks up a storm about the making of the film in the extras.  She's a talented and bright, young woman.  Yasmin Paige(Petrova) plays the Russian girl who struggles fitting in anywhere.  Can't act or dance for the life of her, she wants to fly.  It's a tougher role since it lacks the flamboyancy of the others.  Finally, there's Lucy Boynton(Posy) whom we loved as Margaret in 'Sense and Sensibility(2007)'.  What a growing star!  Her timing and delivering are impeccable.  Again, she's absolutely hilarious.  Apparently, all the actresses enjoyed the dancing, but poor Lucy didn't much care for the red hair.Sandra Goldbacher directs('The Governess'); Heidi Thomas wrote the screenplay(episodes of 'Cranford' and 'Lilies'- both excellent and a favorite of ours, 'I Capture the Castle').It amazes me how the Brits put out films like this.

However, these anomalies are easily overlooked because the rest of the film really captures the look and feel of the book--the way I always pictured it in my mind. I only wish it could have been longer, so that we could have seen more of the story. Much of the casting is perfect--particularly Pauline, Gum, and Winifred. Emma Watson is the perfect Pauline!

This is partly due to the wonderful assembly of actors chosen to act in it and the various familiar faces - Emilia Fox [ played the role of Ms Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice], Emma Watson [Hermione of Harry Potter fame], Lucy Boynton [played the youngest Ms Dashwood in the 2008 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility], Richard Griffiths [also of Harry Potter], Harriet Walter, Eileen Atkins, and Gemma Jones. It was so wonderful seeing all these beloved actors together in one movie.The story starts with an eccentric paleontologist, Dr GUM [Great Uncle Matthew played by Richard Griffiths] who is forced to take in his orphaned niece Sylvia [later played by Emilia Fox] who is accompanied by her nurse, Nana. Over the next several years, GUM goes off on expeditions returning each time with a baby girl, and the three are raised as sisters - Pauline Fossil [Emma Watson], Petrova Fossil [Yasmin Paige], and Posy Fossil [Lucy Boynton]. When GUM goes off on another expedition and doesn't return for 12 years, the ladies and girls are left to fend for themselves, forced to take in boarders, and Pauline also goes to work on the stage as an actress to supplement the family income. The focus is mostly on the three girls, and though Emma Watson does a credible job with her role, she is often outshined by Yasmin Paige as the middle sister, Petrova, who finds herself in a quandary - she can neither act well like Pauline or dance like Posy. What she wishes for ardently is to be an aviator, a high ambition indeed for one so young and at a time when women pilots were few and far between.There is also a sub-plot [which seems more like an afterthought] focusing on a supposed love triangle between Sylvia, a male lodger, Mr Simpson [Marc Warren], and female boarder Theo Dane [Lucy Cohu].The story was paced well-enough but was flawed in terms of character development if only because of the movie's length - only 84 minutes total running time. But the period details were wonderful and the charming and able cast made it a worthwhile and engaging watch.Some of the bonuses on the DVD include an interview with Emma Watson, some deleted scenes, a movie trailer, and a audiobook reading of an excerpt from Ballet Shoes.",4,Wonderful period drama about three sisters in Depression-era London,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2472,"['Having', 'never', 'read', 'Noel', 'Streatfield', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', '[', 'understand', 'movie', 'condensed', 'version', 'book', ']', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'partly', 'due', 'wonderful', 'assembly', 'actors', 'chosen', 'act', 'various', 'familiar', 'Emilia', 'Fox', '[', 'played', 'role', 'Ms', 'Georgiana', 'Darcy', '1995', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', ']', 'Emma', 'Watson', '[', 'Hermione', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', ']', 'Lucy', 'Boynton', '[', 'played', 'youngest', 'Ms', 'Dashwood', '2008', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ']', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', '[', 'also', 'Harry', 'Potter', ']', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'actors', 'together', 'one', 'movie.The', 'story', 'eccentric', 'paleontologist', 'Dr', 'GUM', '[', 'Great', 'Uncle', 'Matthew', 'played', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', ']', 'who', 'forced', 'take', 'orphaned', 'niece', 'Sylvia', '[', 'later', 'played', 'Emilia', 'Fox', ']', 'who', 'accompanied', 'nurse', 'Nana', 'next', 'several', 'years', 'GUM', 'off', 'expeditions', 'returning', 'time', 'baby', 'girl', 'three', 'are', 'raised', 'sisters', 'Pauline', 'Fossil', '[', 'Emma', 'Watson', ']', 'Petrova', 'Fossil', '[', 'Yasmin', 'Paige', ']', 'Posy', 'Fossil', '[', 'Lucy', 'Boynton', ']', 'When', 'GUM', 'off', 'expedition', ""n't"", 'return', '12', 'years', 'ladies', 'girls', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'forced', 'take', 'boarders', 'Pauline', 'also', 'work', 'stage', 'actress', 'supplement', 'family', 'income', 'focus', 'mostly', 'three', 'girls', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'credible', 'job', 'role', 'often', 'outshined', 'Yasmin', 'Paige', 'middle', 'sister', 'Petrova', 'who', 'quandary', 'can', 'act', 'well', 'Pauline', 'dance', 'Posy', 'What', 'ardently', 'be', 'aviator', 'high', 'ambition', 'indeed', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'time', 'when', 'women', 'pilots', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'also', 'sub-plot', '[', 'more', 'afterthought', ']', 'focusing', 'supposed', 'love', 'triangle', 'Sylvia', 'male', 'lodger', 'Mr', 'Simpson', '[', 'Marc', 'Warren', ']', 'female', 'boarder', 'Theo', 'Dane', '[', 'Lucy', 'Cohu', ']', '.The', 'story', 'was', 'paced', 'well-enough', 'was', 'flawed', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'only', 'movie', 'length', 'only', '84', 'minutes', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'period', 'details', 'were', 'wonderful', 'charming', 'able', 'cast', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'engaging', 'watch.Some', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'include', 'interview', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'trailer', 'audiobook', 'reading', 'excerpt', 'Ballet', 'Shoes']",Ballet Shoes
