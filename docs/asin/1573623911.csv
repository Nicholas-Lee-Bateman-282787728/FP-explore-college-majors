189665,A1IE7D4HZP43E7,1573623911,Amazon Customer,"[8, 12]","I suppose there is no harm in ordering this two-movie set, since it seems to be the same price as the first movie alone, but it might be better not to bother, as the second movie kind of spoils the tighter plot line of the first. If I could I would give the first movie 4 stars (5 if you love the genre) and the second one star (zero if you like Stephen King).The first movie is based on a King short story in the compilation ""Night Shift."" It is a nicely done tale in the vein of the revenge drama, where those who have a grudge against someone return to wear down and destroy their antagonist. In that sense, ""Sometimes They Come Back"" has a dramatic core familiar from ""Kiss of Death"" or ""Cape Fear,"" both movies where a resentful and psychotic gangster returns to destroy the person who they blame for their imprisonment. In ""Sometimes"" three kids who harassed the protagonist as a child and killed his brother return from the dead to avenge themselves for their own deaths, which occurred accidentally in the old incident.The movie interprets the King story quite nicely. The changes made to the last third of the short story don't take too much away from the original ending, and in some ways add to it.But ""Sometimes They Come Back Again"" comes from the ""we made money from the first, let's see if we can squeeze out a few extra nickels"" school of film writing. The story tries to borrow the same three characters (or ones that look like them) with a different plot line. It brings in Satanism, a boring mysterious priest, a little satanic cheesecake, and a plot that might have made a 30-minute TV show. At the end it uses part of the ending of the original King story out of context, where it should have been left well enough alone. The most frightening part of the movie is where they leave room open at the end for another sequel. I shuddered.My teenaged daughter, who likes both horror stories and Stephen King, turned it off midway through. ""Don't you even want to see how it turns out?"" I asked.

189670,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,1573623911,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Sometimes They Come Back:Sometimes They Come Back was the beginning of a 3 part Stephen King trilogy that spanned throughout different years in the 90s. None of the 3 films were ever released in theaters but instead made for TV movies.Sometimes They Come Back was the first of this trilogy that came out in 1991 and is based off of Stephen King&#8217;s short story under the same name. The plot revolves around 36 year old Jimmy Norman who has relocated back to his childhood town with his wife, Sally and his son, Scott to be a high school teacher. Jim left the town after his older brother; Wayne was murdered by a group of greasers by the names of Richard Lawson, Vinnie Vincent, and David North in 1963 in a train tunnel. The greaser crooks were killed shortly after via an oncoming train that sent their car bursting into flames.Now as the anniversary of Wayne&#8217;s death is approaching, Jim begins having nightmares and recollections of his brother&#8217;s death. As Jim begins bonding with some of his students, they begin getting killed off in ways that are made to look like suicides. For every student killed off, they&#8217;re replaced in class with a member of the greaser gang who have now been resurrected as demons.Jim realizes that Lawson, Vincent, and North have returned from the dead to exact revenge on him for their death many years before and that they plan on killing him the same way they killed his brother in the train tunnel with his wife and son as bait. Jim has been running from the past ever since Wayne died, but now Jim is forced to stop running and battle his past demons that are hell-bent on killing him too.Overall: This was a great movie to start off the trilogy. Now while this is no masterpiece, compared to the other films Stephen King has put together, it&#8217;s acceptable and is something to watch if you&#8217;re a Stephen King fan. The effects are decent and the acting is good, while the plot is passable for its time. I&#8217;m not going to lie; the ending pulled at my heartstrings and had a few tears in my eyes. It may very well be the only horror movie I have ever watched that had me in tears at the end of overall for that matter. The bottom line is, I think if you give this movie a chance, you&#8217;ll enjoy it_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Sometimes They Come Back Again:In this sequel, single father, Jon Porter and his daughter Michelle move back to Jon&#8217;s small childhood town of Glenrock after he finds out his mother has died following a mysterious fall she took.  Not too long after moving back, Jon is haunted by painful memories of his past. When he was a kid, Jon witnessed the brutal murder of his sister, Lisa, who was violently stabbed to death by the ruthless Tony Reno and his two thug friends, Vinnie and Sean as part of a Satanic sacrifice. Jon retaliated by throwing an electric pole into a puddle of water where they were standing, that electrocuted them to death instantly.Michelle instantly befriends Steve, the mentally challenged gardener who mowed Michelle&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s lawn. She also befriends the psychic, Jules and the boy-crazy, Maria, two girls who helped clean her grandmother&#8217;s house. The following night after the funeral, with Michelle&#8217;s 18th birthday being days away, she goes to a pre-birthday dinner with Jules and Maria, where a guy who looks extremely similar to Tony Reno shows up and sits at their table. He seems interested in Michelle and gives her a necklace watch as an early birthday present before he leaves the diner and disappears. Meanwhile, Jon is constantly being confronted by eerie priest, Father Archer Roberts who tries to convince Jon that his mother&#8217;s death was no accident.When Tony stops by Michelle&#8217;s house one day to visit her, Jon gets a bad feeling about him. As Michelle&#8217;s friends begin becoming aware that Tony is a killer, they start getting killed in gruesome ways. Jon begins to realize that the satanic Tony and his goons have risen from the dead to take vengeance upon him and that he and Michelle are next on their hit list, unless he can find a way to put an end to their terror and send them back to hell, once and for all.Overall: This is my favorite movie of the Sometimes They Come Back trilogy. I love the actors/actresses in it, the plot is interesting as it takes an entertaining devilish twist with the antagonists, unlike the first one, and our villains in this film are much creepier and brutal. The way they kill off the innocent victims in this film are interesting and the overall atmosphere of them is just creepy. The effects for this movie are also amazing. There's one scene in particular where Tony resurrects one of his friends and he's formed through a pool of blood. It kind of strikes me as odd that Sometimes They Come Back Again is the only movie of the 3 to not yet be released by itself on DVD. Both of these movies are amazing and if you want to see some old-fashioned Stephen King movies, check out Sometimes They Come Back and Sometimes They Come Back Again. Mainly for Sometimes They Come Back Again, though.
