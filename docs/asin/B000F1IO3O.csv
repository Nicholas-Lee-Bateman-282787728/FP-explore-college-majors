I really thought it was going to be more of a movie. In between the stand up comedy there are musical numbers, all of which I have already seen on Youtube a billion times. I don't think Sarah is a very good stand up comedian, she just stands there being rigid trying to get the audience to laugh at her overplayed jokes. I even bought her book ""The Bedwetter"", and that book was sloppily put together and boring.

I remember it was on the verge of cancellation a few times).Anyway, Sarah's stand up performance is EXACTLY what I expected- nonstop offensive humor pertaining to the subjects of sex and race. It's almost entirely THESE two subjects and nothing else, which is why I lowered the rating one point. I would have preferred more variety.  Then again if you make it your mission to disrespect people as hard as possible, these are definitely the best two subjects to allow it to happen!Her style of performing was nice to see. She delivers jokes very slowly to allow the audience to anticipate (and appreciate) when the main point of the joke is revealed, and normally wraps an interesting story behind the jokes (usually pertaining to family members) which is not much different from Larry the Cable Guy, to be honest.I WAS a little shocked how graphic her choice of words were.

Google ""Eddie Murphy"" or ""Richard Pryor"" and you come up with the how-great-they-are/were sites.  Sarah is another minority comedian that is not only hilarious, but able to pull off some of the ""edgy"" (to steal her term) and taboo jokes out there.  Murphy and Pryor did it, but to some it is too difficult to watch a beautiful white woman spewing out some of the most hard-core jokes and rants that we have heard since Eddie Murphy's Delirious or Raw.I'm writing to tell you that Sarah's movie is flat-out hilarious from start to finish.  The songs are sure to bring about a comedy CD (I hope, I hope, I hope), and maybe even a follow up show.If you find harsh, crass, ""edgy"" humor about race, creed, disasters or sex too much for you, then may I suggest going to Blockbuster Video and renting The Notebook - 'Jesus' is not for you.

981323,AZYJ9TS07B02W,B000F1IO3O,Czinczar,"[19, 37]","I'm at a loss to explain why this film failed to satisfy. The yuks were there, but somehow they didn't click. I'm not sure who to point the finger at for this.Sarah delivers some outrageous jokes with an often dry delivery. Dry outrageousness requires absolutely perfect timing to pull it off. She doesn't have that degree of perfection. Edgy, yet droll? She has to keep reminding us how edgy she is. There's an example of her dryness. The best you can hope for with something like that is a good chuckle. The people around me in the theater were doing plenty of chuckling throughout the movie, but I could barely muster a chortle. Was it just me? Was I in a bad mood? Was I expecting something more? Maybe.I guess I was expecting a little more from everyone involved. I needed a little better timing from Sarah (especially in her dressing room scenes) and I expected more proficient work from the director, editor and cinematographer. They need to go back to film school and learn the basics of how to film a stand up comic doing her act. All those rapid cuts of closeups of her face from various different angles, and sometimes with a wobblecam. Wrong, wrong, wrong. They may have been trying to be edgy, but they just ended up being distractingly awkward. Maybe they were just trying to shove her beauty in our face, because that was the main thing they had to work with. I'll confess, I'm stunned by her beauty. I'm smitten with her. If I bought the film, I could just hit the mute button and stare at her for 72 minutes. That would be nice. Her beauty is what pushed my rating up to three stars. Otherwise ....Maybe it's a sign of how jaded I am that her jokes which were designed to offend didn't faze me. Maybe it's just the level of cynicism to which our culture has sunk. Sad. I've heard funnier and more risque things on ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons.""The dressing room scenes had great comedic potential which never materialized because of the poor timing of everyone involved. The musical numbers had me smiling, despite their occasional awkwardness.So I'm left with with a sense of sadness over what could have been if everyone had come through on their job.

981324,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000F1IO3O,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[9, 19]","Sarah Silverman is perhaps the funniest comedienne working today. She is quick, raunchy, profane, and sometimes racist, which is both good and bad. Her new concert film, ""Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic"" is almost as funny as she is. However Silverman seems to have toned it down for this movie. She is not as racist as she has been in the past (the closest she comes is a preachy monologue about how she had a joke with a derogatory term for race in it and thought it was ""edgy"" until people of that race were sitting in the front row of one of her shows.) She keeps the swearing to a bare minimum, and uses gross-out humor only in one quick joke. The humor of this movie is more...printable...we'll say. She still skewers AIDS (""When God gives you AIDS-and he does give you AIDS-you make lemonAIDS""), the Holocasust (""If Hitler knew that in sixty years the people he had based his genocide around would be driving German made cars, would he have changed his opinion? Killing customers just isn't good for business""), 9/11 (""Yes. The events on that day were tragic, unforgiveable, and unforgettable. It was the day I found out the soy chai latte I had been drinking everday had 900 calories""; ""People love things that come first. That's why American Airlines' slogan should be 'American Airlines: First through the towers'. Because they were first""), and, quite briefly, but hilariously, rape (I was raped by my doctor, which is sort of bittersweet for a Jewish girl."") That is where the problem lies in this otherwise near-flawless movie. The taboo subjects that made her famous and basically what she is are just barely touched upon in this movie. The single above mentioned joke is given about thirty seconds, plus at least a minute of the audience not knowing whether they should laugh or feel bad for her before Silverman moves onto talking about 9/11 and how she should buy all the Osama websites (""Then who's he gonna have to come to? Big S, that's who."") Another problem, the only other, with this movie is the sketch comedy bits at the beginning, end, and in the middle. The beginning one is sort of funny, but the end one is unforgivably bad. It almost seems the writers were aiming for how sad she really is instead of comedy. Silverman's humor is so adult-oriented and mature that it seems out of place to see her passionately kissing her mirror image. There are some great musical numbers, one of which has Silverman driving against a fake 1950's backdrop. Towards the end she does a great rendition of something called ""The Bong Song"" (which is less about bongs than Jewish people driving Mercedes'. I found out towards the end it was Silverman herself who wrote ""The Bong Song"" (at least I think that's what it was called, even though the word bong was mentioned only once) was written by Silverman, as where all the other songs except for her show-stopping rendition of 'Saving Grace' (the gross-out part of her act. Alas it last but two minutes). There is also a great song, sung via Silverman to her late grandmothers retirement center called ""You're Gonna Die Soon"". Silverman is very funny, and the movie shows she is, but it needed to be more daring and cringe-inducing. There are many funny moments here, but there could have been more. The end credits are very funny, as is the scene at the very end.

You could make the argument that the musical numbers really weren't necessary, since Sarah's stand-up is so shockingly, insanely funny. But without the musical numbers, I would have missed out on Sarah singing ""You're gonna die soon"" to a group of senior citizens in a nursing home, or her holding the microphone up to her different orafices, all of which have different voices.What I love about Sarah is that her comedy doesn't really seem to have any kind of agenda, other than to make you laugh hysterically as she constantly humiliates every ridiculous thing about our society.",5,Laugh riot,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,903,"['Jesus', 'Magic', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'laughed', 'almost', 'constantly', 'whole', 'thing', 'so', 'did', 'friend', 'everyone', 'else', 'small', 'theater', 'saw', 'in.Essentially', 'concert', 'film', 'Jesus', 'Magic', 'also', 'handful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'scenes', 'could', 'make', 'argument', 'musical', 'numbers', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Sarah', 'stand-up', 'so', 'shockingly', 'insanely', 'funny', 'musical', 'numbers', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'Sarah', 'singing', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'soon', 'group', 'senior', 'citizens', 'nursing', 'home', 'holding', 'microphone', 'up', 'different', 'orafices', 'have', 'different', 'love', 'Sarah', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'kind', 'agenda', 'other', 'make', 'laugh', 'hysterically', 'constantly', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'society']",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic

This is intentional.  In that sense, Silverman's humor is more like Andy Kaufman's than like most other stand-up comedians in that she enjoys making you feel uncomfortable as much as she enjoys making you laugh.  Probably more.  The biggest difference is that Silverman's material is dirtier, probably because it has more shock value coming out of this cute, high voiced girl.On the other hand, once you see her sing ""Amazing Grace"" in 3-part harmony, through 3 different orifices, the shock value does turn to gut-busting laughs.  Also, as with her performance in 'The Aristocrats,' it's frequently hard to separate the moments here when Silverman is being straight with the audience (assume almost never) from when she is leading them directly to the cliff she wants to shove them off.  If you're sensitive about...well, anything...this DVD WILL poke a sharp stick at that sensitive area.In any case, don't expect to walk away from this performance feeling refreshed from an hour or so of hilarity.  The feeling is more like an uncomfortable nod of approval to Silverman for bravely busting society's chops -- often ruthlessly -- over religious hypocracy, political pandering, sexual mores, and racial stereotyping through her VERY provocative and twisted stories and lines.

Sarah is cute, funny, and her play on words would have made for a good 20 minute short. Instead we get over an hour of songs, skits, and other filler, to try and give it some air by getting out off the stage.

Now that Margaret Cho has become almost an irrelevant one trick pony, Sarah is one of the few truly funny females around who mixes it up.

Oh, it didn't seem like a mistake at the time -- in fact, I learned a lot -- but it took most of the edge off ""Jesus Is Magic"", because it reprinted about half the script.  I'd never seen Silverman perform live but I knew half the punchlines.This is mostly a performance film, with a few comedy bits and songs mixed in.  Silverman has an interesting joke structure in which she makes a serious comment about a touchy topic (9/11, racism, religion), then goes one step beyond by making what sounds be an offensive remark... and then comes full-circle by saying what she really means.  It's easy to mistake this for her actually being offensive, when I think she's actually trying to make a point about how people instinctively respond to certain topics.Or maybe she is being offensive.  Whenever there was laughter in the theater where I saw this, I couldn't tell if it came from my audience, or from the on-screen audience.  Sometimes even I couldn't laugh.  Then I came home and saw a TV commercial for a support group about a certain illness, and thought, Sarah Silverman could get four minutes of material out of that.If you don't walk out before the credits, stick around for after the credits.  As a post-credit gag, someone else in the cast tries to deliver two of Silverman's routines, with vastly different results.

Most of the songs and skits were funny, but some of them were also indulgent, and in my opinion, didn't go anywhere (though, I hadn't laughed that hard in anything in a while when she portrayed a Jewish porn star). I should probably watch it again... I probably would anyway, because most of it was pretty hilarious, but I can't pinpoint exactly what this film was missing. It could have been that I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. Is this a stand up comedy act? Is this a series of skits? Is this a documentary? It ended up being a montage of all 3 of them, which was kind of odd, considering that not many films I have seen really do that.

981337,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000F1IO3O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 21]","I happen to think Sarah Silverman is a very talented comedienne, and an eminently entertaining performer.  Her deadly serious delivery of the most outrageously offensive material is her trademark.  She conveys a certain sweetness and naivete, even as the most horrible things come out of her mouth.  She can be provocative, controversial, button-pushing and brilliant.  She is super intelligent and her social commentary, couched in very un-PC jokes, can be biting and relevant.That said, I don't think ""Jesus is Magic"" is as wholly successful a film as I would have liked.  Most of the standup material is good and biting--but be forewarned, it's adult stuff.  If this were a concert film, I'd have been more inclined to a 4 or 4 1/2 star rating.  Whether or not you think someone is funny is often a matter of personal taste and I like Silverman.  There are plenty of other people who have made it huge that I have never thought were very interesting.The more problematic aspects of this film, for me, is where she ventures into ""bits.""  There are a couple of staged music video type numbers.  Now, I love a good musical interlude as much as the next person and I was thrilled when these segments began.  However, while there may have been a funny line or hook--the songs ultimately become repetitive and play out as one-note jokes.  There also some backstage skits.  Again, these provide some minor amusement but don't necessarily enhance the film.If you're a Silverman fan, obviously you're going to watch this.  If you like intelligently offensive comedy, I'd recommend this as well.  As a Silverman supporter, I am hoping her next venture will be a little more cohesive.

It's a combination of Christopher Guest-style mockumentary and stand-up comedy interspersed with musical performances.  Silverman tackles topics from 9/11 to AIDS to the Holocaust and everything in between.  She says the things no one else has the guts to and does so with admirable aplomb.  The title of the movie comes from one of the earlier jokes about the possibilty of the Jewish Silverman and her Catholic boyfriend having children.  She jokes that they'd just be honest with the children telling them, ""Mommy is one of the chosen people and Daddy thinks Jesus is Magic.""  Silverman emphasizes the importance of putting a positive spin on everything, ie, when life gives you AIDS make lemonAIDS.  That's just a taste of the hilarious and over-the-top comedy of this movie.  I laughed out loud several times.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend, but it's not for anyone who doesn't have the ability to laugh at themselves and everyone around them.  Also, be sure to watch through the credits which include even more jokes, including a teenage girl delivering Sarah's jokes to an audience with very different results.",4,An exercise in positive spin,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1253,"['Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Jesus', 'Magic', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'combination', 'Christopher', 'Guest-style', 'mockumentary', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'interspersed', 'musical', 'performances', 'Silverman', 'topics', '9/11', 'AIDS', 'Holocaust', 'everything', 'things', 'one', 'else', 'guts', 'so', 'admirable', 'aplomb', 'title', 'movie', 'one', 'earlier', 'jokes', 'possibilty', 'Jewish', 'Silverman', 'Catholic', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'children', ""'d"", 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'children', 'telling', 'Mommy', 'one', 'chosen', 'people', 'Daddy', 'thinks', 'Jesus', 'Magic', 'Silverman', 'importance', 'putting', 'positive', 'spin', 'everything', 'ie', 'when', 'life', 'AIDS', 'make', 'lemonAIDS', 'just', 'taste', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'movie', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'friend', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'laugh', 'everyone', 'Also', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'include', 'even', 'more', 'jokes', 'including', 'teenage', 'girl', 'delivering', 'Sarah', 'jokes', 'audience', 'very', 'different', 'results']",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic
981339,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000F1IO3O,Lleu Christopher,"[2, 4]","Sarah Silverman is called ""the hippest comic working today"" in a quote from the New Yorker appearing on the cover of the DVD. After watching her for the first time in this film, I think the quote is more than mere hyperbole. Silverman is definitely on the cutting edge of comedy; this will appeal to some and alienate others. While she is very funny, she also expresses a kind of harsh, unapologetic nihilism that is part of modern/postmodern hipness. This film is about three-quarters stand-up routine; the rest are scenes filmed in various locations. There are a few musical numbers as well. Silverman's greatest talent is in her delivery and facial expressions. She takes on a persona of innocence and naivete while saying the most offensive things imaginable. She is able to convey a wide range of subtle and nuanced moods. In the opening sequence, for example, she is speaking to two friends who are telling her about their creative projects. At this point, she tells them about her own show which (according to the script that is) she hasn't even really written yet. She listens to her friends with an expression that perfectly expresses uncertainty and insecurity. Similarly, during her stand-up routine, she is able to replicate the tone of the insipidly inoffensive while delivering the verbal equivalent of poison darts.She discusses (as we can guess from the title) Jesus, 9-11, the Holocaust, her grandmother's death and a myriad of racial stereotypes with a straightforward insensitivity and irreverence that is at once original, shocking and hilarious. What makes Silverman unusual is not only that she goes further than most comics dare, but that at no time does she ever backpedal from her ruthless onslaughts of sacred cows.  Reading some other opinions on Silverman, I notice that she is compared, both favorably and unfavorably to Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and George Carlin -all male comics. I hate to make what sounds like such a banal, politically-correct observation (which is especially ironic when discussing Silverman's material), but I can't help but suspect that many people have a harder time accepting such hard-edged material from a female comic.Some portions of Jesus Is Magic work better than others. I did not find all of the musical numbers especially entertaining or funny. The stand-up portion is otherwise nicely framed by the introduction, where she plans the show, and ending, where she haughtily snubs some friends who visit her dressing room. I will definitely look for more from her in the future. After watching her for two hours (including the supplementary material on the DVD, which has her scene from The Aristocrats among other things), I honestly don't know if Sarah Silverman is a racist, self-absorbed narcissist or if she is just very good at playing one. I suspect she likes it that way.",4,Is she serious?,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,2842,"['Sarah', 'Silverman', 'called', 'hippest', 'comic', 'working', 'today', 'quote', 'New', 'Yorker', 'appearing', 'cover', 'DVD', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'think', 'quote', 'more', 'mere', 'hyperbole', 'Silverman', 'definitely', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comedy', 'will', 'appeal', 'alienate', 'others', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'kind', 'harsh', 'unapologetic', 'nihilism', 'part', 'modern/postmodern', 'hipness', 'film', 'three-quarters', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'rest', 'are', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'various', 'locations', 'are', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'as', 'well', 'Silverman', 'greatest', 'talent', 'delivery', 'facial', 'expressions', 'persona', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'saying', 'most', 'offensive', 'things', 'imaginable', 'able', 'convey', 'wide', 'range', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'moods', 'opening', 'sequence', 'example', 'speaking', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'telling', 'creative', 'projects', 'point', 'own', 'show', 'according', 'script', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'written', 'yet', 'friends', 'expression', 'perfectly', 'uncertainty', 'insecurity', 'Similarly', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'able', 'replicate', 'tone', 'insipidly', 'inoffensive', 'delivering', 'verbal', 'equivalent', 'poison', 'darts.She', 'can', 'guess', 'title', 'Jesus', '9-11', 'Holocaust', 'grandmother', 'death', 'myriad', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'straightforward', 'insensitivity', 'irreverence', 'once', 'original', 'shocking', 'hilarious', 'What', 'Silverman', 'unusual', 'not', 'only', 'further', 'most', 'comics', 'dare', 'time', 'ever', 'backpedal', 'ruthless', 'onslaughts', 'sacred', 'cows', 'Reading', 'other', 'opinions', 'Silverman', 'notice', 'compared', 'favorably', 'unfavorably', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'George', 'Carlin', '-all', 'male', 'comics', 'hate', 'make', 'what', 'banal', 'politically-correct', 'observation', 'especially', 'ironic', 'when', 'discussing', 'Silverman', 'material', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'suspect', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'harder', 'time', 'accepting', 'such', 'hard-edged', 'material', 'female', 'comic.Some', 'portions', 'Jesus', 'Is', 'Magic', 'work', 'better', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'musical', 'numbers', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'stand-up', 'portion', 'otherwise', 'nicely', 'framed', 'introduction', 'where', 'show', 'ending', 'where', 'haughtily', 'snubs', 'friends', 'who', 'visit', 'dressing', 'room', 'will', 'definitely', 'look', 'more', 'future', 'watching', 'two', 'hours', 'including', 'supplementary', 'material', 'DVD', 'scene', 'Aristocrats', 'other', 'things', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'racist', 'self-absorbed', 'narcissist', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'one', 'suspect', 'way']",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic

Problem is she is first a self-indulgent Jewish shock comedienne and then a performer. (The video ""Give the Jew Girl a Toy"" is cute but too much all at the same time. She has a point but don't belabor that point. Sorry, you can't base a career on Santa Claus)When a performer is so much into themselves we seem to be intruding on their inner thoughts; that's where the therapy comes in. However self-loathing, public revelation trumps the poignancy of social commentary.There are the obligatory comments about Nazis, German cars etc. Too bad she had to start the show with an attack on Jesus and Catholicism. Do I have to really say that for a Jew who understands the Holocaust she should be a bit tolerant of other people's religion? Who is she pandering to by insulting Jesus?Shocking but still politically correct.She jokes (a little) about gay men and she jokes (a little) about Black men but never crosses the political correction line. There is the obligatory non-judgmental attitude towards gays and Blacks.  She implies gay sex is okay for them but not for her. She talks about the ""N-word"" but then cowers in front of a couple of Black men (in an otherwise charming music video) lest they beat her.Adolescent filthy jokes about sex and the toilet, laced with profanity are no substitute for maturity nor sophistication.

She's a rare breed of comedian who, like Tom Green and Andy Kaufman, is more interested in consistently surprising her audience than in developing a rapport with them.Most of her act involves making wide-eyed naive statements which treat irrational, and often offensive, beliefs as second nature and leave it up to you to conclude what the irrational belief behind the statement is, but she always finds a way to express it through using the kind of banal anecdotal approach a lot of comedians use to set up their jokes, so it catches you off-guard while also parodying conventional stand-up technique.She does use shock value, but she has a uniquely clever way with twist punchlines. Like that one joke she does about licking jelly off her boyfriend. She starts out with the dirty part, and then uses the clean part, the common phrase the dirty part is playing off of (""oh my god i'm turning into my mother""), as the punchline. I think that's unprecedented. I mean tell me any other dirty joke with a twist punchline by any other comedian which starts out with the dirty part and uses the clean part as the punchline.The comedic value of her material is really in the irrationality of the ideas she expresses. Like she has this one old bit which is like ""I don't like going out to dance clubs. It's very embarassing for me. Because I tapdance."" Most of her more recent offensive material works the same way, throwing in a twist punchline which reveals an amusingly irrational perspective, but the offensive material is open to a more superficial interpretation which disregards the cleverness of the context and sees her appeal as being merely her willingness to be outrageous. I think she's underselling herself by using shock value so much now. I like the way she uses it to play with people's irrational pavlovian responses though.

981351,A387BD735MI50R,B000F1IO3O,R. Schultz,"[2, 6]","I had heard that Sarah Silverman's comedy on this feature DVD of her stand-up performance was outrageous in the extreme and vulgar. Well, I don't think it stretches to any extremes. You can find far worse. But it is fairly crude in patches. And I'm not sure these patches are funny enough to justify the verbal violence. If you are going to butcher sacred cows, you had better have a pretty sharp knife. And Silverman's monolgue doesn't always qualify.For example, I'm not sure her harmonizing trio of body orifices is funny enough to justify the vulgarity. Several of her songs are pretty lame. The offstage masturbation scene is pointless. And what is that raging argument about her brand of bottled water all about? Was there supposed to be a joke about product placement in there somewhere?Also, she lapses into jolting reticence on one point. She is quite willing to sling out all the vulgarisms for the various body parts. But then she inexplicably refers to excrement as ""dooty."" Why the sudden reversion to baby-talk?But I got a few genuine guffaws along the way and could appreciate the number of times she really rips the cloth out from under our polite, silver-service conversation. Her joke about AIDS is a classic. And her rejoinder to Martin Luther King is hilarious.As director Liam Lynch says on the Commentary though, Silverman is essentially an actress. I was engrossed (and yes sometimes grossed out) watching her act out the various petulant, self-absorbed moods of a ""J.A.P."" (After a comedy beat, Silverman corrects the audience's natural assumption about what she meant by that and says of course she meant she was Japanese.) But her expressiveness in her role makes the movie/DVD a much better experience than going to her live performances. Here you can see every pout, every pondering up close.There are a lot of extras on the DVD, but most of the material isn't very worthwhile. Having a Director/Silverman Commentary is a bit circular since Silverman's stage performance is itself a social commentary. And now I'm commenting on the Commentary on the commentary. So we are getting really far removed from any direct experience. The only interesting feature I found about the Director Commentary was the fact of Lynch's obvious admiration for and appreciation of Silverman's every piece of shtick. How wonderful it would be if we all could have a colleague/fan supporting us like that.This isn't quite Margaret Cho, another monologist who uses her particular ethnic background as grist for her mill.

981354,AV2VQXQNL3XKT,B000F1IO3O,"T. Boram ""baltimorescience""","[2, 3]","i cannot endorse another reviewer's wish for a comedy album of sarah's songs.  i wasn't sure what to expect from this DVD, but i was eager to try it.  however, as soon as the opening menu began, playing her opening ""song"" as a background, i was instantly terrified that the ""brilliant"" comedy i was promised by a few trusted friends would not be delivered. luckily, within five minutes or so we the viewer are ushered into a theatre where sarah is giving her live stand-up routine without any bells and whistles.  it is here that i was able to enjoy some of the heralded ""brilliance"" i was told of.  i did not enjoy the several ""songs"" which were interspersed throughout the film at all, but i can attest that sarah's stand-up is a must see for fans of unique and creative stage comedy.what is so good about the comedy is sarah's cadence and manner, and what is so bad about the songs is that they don't capture either of those things.  the songs are more of a twenty-first century wierd-al yankovic kind of half-baked lampoonery.  they are not half as interesting as her stand-up work.sarah's stand-up style works in an odd way.  sarah delivers her show in, i believe, ""character"". at least i really hope it is in character.  this ""character"" is a sort of neurotic, but narcissistic american princess.  she is abrasive in the extreme, though in a vigilantly self-conscious way.  it works well because much of the ""hateful"" content is spewed with meta-caveats, sort of unapologetic acknowlegements of her american ignorances.  she strikes me as clever in this way, because i feel that ""qualifying"" predjudices is an unfortuately typical american post-modernism.  many educated and privledged people in our country have vicious fears and hatreds, but they have some intellectual artillery and ample physical separation from that which they fear as a first layer of defense.  yesterday's predjudices were more of the KKK variety of militant and monomanical proclamations, whereas the current ethos of this country is more one of apathetic and lazy hate.sarah's comedy seems to skewer right through the heart of this.  she is a self centered jewish american princess who isn't afraid of being homophobic and racist because she is both attractive and educated, allowing her easy access to worlds that can nuture her away from that which she isn't compatible with.  however at the same time, her ""character"" is cranky and acidic, an indication that the confusing and ugly world can seap into even a spoiled girl's mind and cause dissonance.  sarah handles this and fleshes out her routine by using typically american lingo, lilting voice patterns, and dead-pan eye-rolls and hair tosses.it is difficult to describe, but it is a complex approach that hits on several levels simultaneously.  i think in this way sarah silverman is a great treasure and is offering something unlike what i've seen before.  i love american-styled ""meta-comedy"" such as mr. show (which she is alumnus), and sarah silverman may improve with time and become an even sharper jab into american obliviousness, or she may lose steam.  time will tell.but for now ""jesus is magic"" is a peek into a powerful american comedy that suffers some by that always ugly head-rearing desire to bust into mediocre song stylings.",3,"unique stand up,

(Nana's funeral, enough said)I enjoy comedians like Dane Cook, Chris Rock, Margaret Cho, Russel Peters, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Seinfeld and more. So, as you can see I have a pretty wide variety of comedic tastes and I don't mind racial humour when it is done fairly (meaning no race is exempt) like Russel Peters. I think the most important thing about a comedian is thier ability to make you see/feel/understand what they are saying. But Sarah Silverman can't do that at all. Be warned, you have to already be like her going in or else you won't like this at all.

It plays as more of a variety show with a lot of singing, and little skits.You will be blown away by how witty and funny Sarah really is.She shows the growing trend in ""our"" generation, not being the way she is for shock-value, but because its what she thinks.Anyone who cant take racy comedy should pass this one, however, I loved it!",5,"Everytime you lose at tag, an Angel gets AIDS!",1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,581,"['love', 'girl', 'such', 'original', 'comic', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'speak', 'mind.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Sarah', 'great', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'know', 'comedy', 'already', 'will', 'LOVE', 'movie.Be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'STAND-UP', 'more', 'variety', 'show', 'lot', 'singing', 'little', 'skits.You', 'will', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'witty', 'funny', 'Sarah', 'really', 'growing', 'trend', 'generation', 'not', 'being', 'way', 'shock-value', 'what', 'thinks.Anyone', 'who', 'cant', 'take', 'racy', 'comedy', 'should', 'pass', 'one', 'however', 'loved']",Sarah Silverman - Jesus is Magic
981361,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000F1IO3O,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 4]","This is the first full Sarah Silverman stand up routine I've seen... although it's not just a stand up routine. It's a weird conglomeration of live stand up with an audience, short clips of film, and music videos.A lot of it is funny, and Silverman does have good comedic timing and an interesting set of jokes, but sometimes the humor of an entire joke is based solely on shock value. If the joke was funny, then shock value would just add to the humor, but shock alone does not a joke make.To me, Silverman seems like a spoiled girl that uses her innocent cute girl look and potty mouth to cash in on people's insecurities with racial and other taboo material. You get the feeling that Silverman is saying if you're offended then you're just too up tight. But I don't know if that's entirely true. When she's at her grandmother's funeral screaming ""You're dying! You're dying!"" it's a little too in-your-face for me, and I can't even really tell if she's trying to be funny or crossing the line into shock value alone.Overall, this movie is a great concept and executed extremely well. I was laughing almost the entire time. It seems like something that other comics would pick up on and follow her example. A film with a standup show in the middle of it is a really funny idea, and I think there are other comedians that could pull it off even better than Silverman, although she does a great job.",3,I'm glad the Jews killed Jesus!
