After his release from a four year prison term, he returns to a suicidal and drug-addled wife.  Law enters as her psychiatrist trying to find the right chemical cocktail to fix what ails her.  Nothing works and he consults with Zeta-Jones, her former psychiatrist, who is not particularly empathetic or helpful. Suddenly Mara, in a sleepwalking fog-a side effect of her latest drug, Ablixa-stabs and kills Tatum.  She gets off the murder charge on an insanity plea due to the drug and has to do a stint in a psych ward, where she begins to improve dramatically.  Law's professional and personal life go to hell as he is blamed for prescribing it. He detects  discrepancies in Mara's statements and behavior, however, and begins to smell a rat.  As he works to exonerate himself, he must step outside legal and professional boundaries and , in doing so, appears somewhat unhinged himself.This film could have been so much better.  The plot is interesting and fairly intricate enough to draw you in.  I think the casting was the issue.  First, if you are a Tatum fan, he has nothing to do here.  He barely appears and is dead early on. A little more development of Mara and Tatums's relationship might have been helpful. There is a flashback that attempts to do this but it is not fleshed out.  Rooney Mara is excellent at developing her character from severely depressed to calculating.  Jude Law does a good job of keeping you on the fence about just who he is.  Is he a good guy?  Is he a competent doctor or a little careless and money-grabbing? Perhaps he is just a little attracted to Rooney, the desperate little bird?  It bothered me that Law and his wife had no chemistry and she walked at the first bump in the road.  However, Zeta-Jones was the real problem for me.  She was so brittle and so plastic from the beginning, not to mention more gorgeous than any doctor you've ever seen, it was a ""tell""....like a clue in a card game.  I suspected her immediately and therefore saw early on where the plot was going.  If her character had been played as an earth mother type who had great insight,  concern, and caring for her former patient, the plot twists would have been less exposed.

1636508,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00BNWWUDY,Brian Driver,"[2, 3]","SIDE EFFECTS is a harrowing story full of pharmaceutical abuse, psychiatric deception, financial trickery and the ugly side of human behavior. While it is NOT a ""feel good"" movie, it IS a well acted and well written film that will command your attention throughout, continuously surprise you, and leave you unsettled.Jude law plays Jonathan Banks, a psychiatrist treating Emily Taylor, a woman who deliberately drove her car into a wall following her criminal financier husband Martin's release from prison. Upon her release from the hospital she agrees to visit the doctor regularly and take anti-depressants to regulate her moods. As one might guess from the title, it's these ""side effects"" that will drive the plot of this movie.My personal advice here is to avoid reviews that want to describe any more of the plot...writer Scott Z. Burns (THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, CONTAGION) and director Steven Soderbergh (ERIN BROCKOVICH, CONTAGION) really pack this film with intrigue, switchbacks and double crosses, creating such a series of claustrophobic twists and turns that it's difficult at times to know who's the victim and who's the villain. That's a lot of the fun, and not knowing what lies ahead makes this a delicious agony to watch.As for the acting, I really believe this is one of Jude Law's better roles; he really gets to demonstrate a wide range of emotional stress. Rooney Mara, too, gets to demonstrate a different side of her than she demonstrated in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  In fact, the entire cast is first rate with Catherine Zeta Jones and Channing Tatum rounding out the central foursome. They are, in a word, terrific.The well-written script is particularly effective as a dynamite thriller yet never seems particularly implausible. Soderbergh has made a history of creating films that wallow in ""uncomfortable"": SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE. TRAFFIC, ERIN BROCKOVICH, AND FULL FRONTAL were all films that looked at the world frankly and seemed at home in the midst of prickly marriage, legal, and other relationship issues. At the heart of so many of his films is the matter of truth and lies, the dynamics of their confrontation, and the aftermath of such collisions.Soderburgh has often declared that he is giving up the game; he has said the time is soon coming when he will relinquish film-making to the young. After a movie as good as SIDE EFFECTS, one can only hope it's another instance of not being entirely truthful.

1636520,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B00BNWWUDY,CinemaMinor,"[3, 5]","So, the first half of the movie is about Emily's (Rooney Mara) depression, from which she's been suffering four hard years, since her formerly wealthy husband Martin (Channing Tatum) was sent to prison for insider trading.  Initially, when still able to maintain her ritzy lifestyle in Greenwich, CT, Emily saw Dr. Seibert (Catherin Zeta-Jones) to help her through the tough times.  But then times got really tough and she had to move back to NYC to find work; without health insurance, continuing to see Dr. Seibert wasn't an option.  The movie begins when Martin gets out of prison, and he and Emily must ""reintegrate"" back to some sort of life together.  Daunted, Emily purposely drives her car into the wall of a parking garage, which results in an encounter at the ER with one Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who becomes her personal psychiatrist and begins prescribing a long list of meds to counteract her depression, including a new one called Ablixa.There's a lot of time spent establishing Emily's state of mind, and a lot of talk about antidepressants and their side-effects.  The Big Bad Pharma Industry gets the type of representation you'd expect.  Emily becomes desperate in her desire to end her life, but knows enough to reach out for help when she needs it and grows overly attached to Dr. Banks, who has a wife and stepson.  The way the dispension of prescriptions is handled can be cliche -- we see the TV ads, doctors are involved in shilling for the drug companies, every woman Emily encounters is on an antidepressant -- which in of itself isn't bad.  However, this time was supposed to be used to set the scene, as it were.  Instead, the movie seems to go off on a tangent, providing commentary about society's/doctors' use of pychotropic meds.  The set-up just goes on too long.Then there's a murder, which is hinted at in the movie's opening shots with images of a bloody floor.  But after that there's a flashback and yada, yada, yada -- it's like an hour later.  Once the murder finally takes place, we're treated to a much different movie.  It actually becomes a thriller.  Except at this point it's not too difficult to figure out what's behind the events that have transpired.  The only thing left to wonder at is how the resolution will unfold, and I don't want to give that away or there's little point in watching.  I will say, reviewers have compared the plot to Hitchcock...I couldn't stop thinking how much it resembles ""Basic Instinct.""  And yes, the subject matter is mature so keep the kids out of the room while you're watching.There are some aspects of the movie that are hard to swallow -- ""contrived"" is an apt description.  But it's a well-made movie with excellent acting from Jude Law.  To me, this was by far Law's show.  Channing Tatum isn't a major player.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the victim of poor writing.  And Rooney Mara is great, but her character is never engaging. Dr. Banks is the one with whom we become involved, as he struggles to get himself out of the mess in which his doctoring -- past and present -- has put him.The reason I think I didn't enjoy the movie more is that it really seems like two different movies -- the first half should have been a quarter, not a half.  And again, there were too many times where the plotting just felt forced.

We have the strong female protagonist and a befuddled but determined male lead; duplicitous supporting characters; and a third-act twist that, if you know your Hitchcock, you can see coming, but is still a nice revelation nonetheless.The plot is predictably complicated: Emily's (Rooney Mara) husband is finally getting released from jail, where he's been doing time for some white collar crimes (take that, Wall Street!).  When Martin (Channing Tatum) gets out, Emily, instead of being overjoyed, drives her car into a wall.  Chance--or is it?--leads her to psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who gives her a new medicine he's been encouraged to prescribe.  Things get better initially--Emily's sex drive is given a jump start, for one--but then turn very sour very quickly.  (I shan't give away more, although the trailers more or less spoiled certain plot elements.)Steven Soderbergh has his legions of fans.  Personally, I've never been blown away by his work; he has his good films (OCEAN'S 11, TRAFFIC) and his stinkers (OCEANS 12 and 13).  SIDE EFFECTS is the first of his films I've seen that doesn't really feel like a Soderbergh film, probably because so much emphasis is upon paying Hitchcock his due homage.  The plot rolls along at a decent pace, and there's a nice change of focus about halfway through, where the film shifts from Mara's shoulders to Law's.  Both actors give riveting performances; the same can be said of the supporting cast, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones as Emily's past psychiatrist.  (Yes, even Tatum continues this career upswing he's been on, proving that he's actually a good actor, and not just eye candy for the ladies.)  The script is solid; none of the twists are really mind-blowing, as perhaps they're meant to be, but the dialogue is decent, upheld by the caliber of performances.If anything, this is SIDE EFFECTS' main weakness: it doesn't have much to offer on its own.  Sure, the acting is solid, and there's some nice social commentary (about twenty years too late, but what the heck), but the film is basically a reworking of the basic Hitchcock tropes.  So basically, if you know your film history, you might not be able to get too far into this one.  However, if you're a determined Soderbergh fan (the man's been over-hyped, but there's no denying he has talent), or if you are unfamiliar with the Master of Suspense, you my find something new in SIDE EFFECTS.  Otherwise, the movie is a solid tribute, but perhaps could have been more than the sum of its parts.",4,"A nice, stylized Hitchock tribute.",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,2671,"['opening', 'shot', 'opening', 'camerawork', 'PSYCHO', 'SIDE', 'EFFECTS', 'out', 'by-the-numbers', 'tribute', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'have', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'befuddled', 'determined', 'male', 'lead', 'duplicitous', 'supporting', 'characters', 'third-act', 'twist', 'know', 'Hitchcock', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'still', 'nice', 'revelation', 'nonetheless.The', 'plot', 'predictably', 'complicated', 'Emily', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'husband', 'finally', 'getting', 'released', 'jail', 'where', 'been', 'doing', 'time', 'white', 'collar', 'crimes', 'take', 'Wall', 'Street', 'When', 'Martin', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'out', 'Emily', 'instead', 'being', 'overjoyed', 'car', 'wall', 'Chance', 'psychiatrist', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'new', 'medicine', 'been', 'encouraged', 'prescribe', 'Things', 'get', 'better', 'initially', 'Emily', 'sex', 'drive', 'given', 'jump', 'start', 'one', 'then', 'turn', 'very', 'sour', 'very', 'quickly', 'sha', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'trailers', 'more', 'less', 'spoiled', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'legions', 'fans', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'work', 'good', 'films', 'OCEAN', '11', 'TRAFFIC', 'stinkers', '12', '13', 'SIDE', 'EFFECTS', 'first', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'Soderbergh', 'film', 'probably', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'paying', 'Hitchcock', 'due', 'homage', 'plot', 'rolls', 'along', 'decent', 'pace', 'nice', 'change', 'focus', 'halfway', 'where', 'film', 'shifts', 'Mara', 'shoulders', 'Law', 'actors', 'give', 'riveting', 'performances', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Emily', 'past', 'psychiatrist', 'Yes', 'even', 'Tatum', 'career', 'upswing', 'been', 'proving', 'actually', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'ladies', 'script', 'solid', 'none', 'twists', 'are', 'really', 'mind-blowing', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'dialogue', 'decent', 'upheld', 'caliber', 'performances.If', 'anything', 'SIDE', 'EFFECTS', 'main', 'weakness', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'own', 'Sure', 'acting', 'solid', 'nice', 'social', 'commentary', 'twenty', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'heck', 'film', 'basically', 'reworking', 'basic', 'Hitchcock', 'tropes', 'So', 'basically', 'know', 'film', 'history', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'However', ""'re"", 'determined', 'Soderbergh', 'fan', 'man', 'been', 'over-hyped', 'denying', 'talent', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'SIDE', 'EFFECTS', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'solid', 'tribute', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sum', 'parts']",N/A

She has other problems, too, including her husband's recent release from prison for insider trading. Of course, anti-depressants are prescribed and Emily tries a few different ones before settling on a new one that does the trick. Or does it? In a matter of months, her husband is killed and she's to blame, although she blames her actions on a sleepwalking side effect of the anti-depressant. Now things really crank up with the re-appearance of Emily's former psychiatrist (Katherine Zeta-Jones) who has some skeletons in her closet, too. Simultaneously, Banks' professional life disintegrates as he's blamed for mis-treating his patient and a number of other dubious professional acts. And just when you think it's over, it's not over in the best possible way. It wraps up almost too perfectly, but in a very satisfying way. Great performance by Jude Law; Zeta-jones could have done a little less misty-voice impressions, but still very good.

I'm thinking great this movie is going to be an indictment of the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry.  Wrong! It turns into one of those thrillers where nothing and nobody is what they seem.  In a word, trash.  Sure the film as helmed by master director Steven Soderbergh has a certain ominous feel to it and the performances are pretty good notably Law's.

1636542,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00BNWWUDY,David R. Eastwood,"[3, 4]","SIDE EFFECTS (2013) has three main characters who look very nice on the outside, appear to be very nice on the inside, but may not be all they seem. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jude Law play the parts of a couple psychiatrists, and Rooney Mara plays the part of a depressed woman who was first Zeta-Jones' patient and then Law's patient. And the medication that Law prescribes to Mara turns out to have dangerous side effects, which may include sleep-walking ... and sleep-cooking ... AND apparently much much more.Progressing quite slowly, SIDE EFFECTS keeps us in suspense for more than half its length as to WHAT kind of film it really is - an expos&eacute; of the drug industry? a psychological thriller? a murder mystery? a revenge tale? or ... ?Then, once it becomes clear just what has taken place, the film's wheels begin to come loose ... and by the ending, all the wheels fall off.We ask ourselves things like ""WHY did Catherine Zeta-Jones' character do that really stupid thing to Jude Law's character?"" ""HOW did Jude Law's character ever begin to see daylight just by spending a couple days on the Internet?"" ""WHAT made him think he was on the right track?"" and ""WHY would Zeta-Jones' character believe what Jude Law's character is telling her?""*SPOILER ALERT* - Then, at the end, after Jude Law's character has found a way to destroy the mind of a patient who lied to him, we ask ourselves things like ""What about his HIPPOCRATIC OATH as a doctor, let alone his integrity and honor as a human being?"" and ""Now that he has almost turned her into a vegetable, HOW is she going to testify at the trial of her accomplice?""The main problem is with the SCRIPT: besides multiple plot holes, it is riddled with massively faulty morality. And the audience apparently is expected to root for and admire the winner at the end of a Dog-Eat-Dog contest. I'm reminded of a parallel case: a disgusting short mystery story by Colin Dexter in which his Inspector Morse and Sgt. Lewis, otherwise very honorable and lovable characters, both connive to FABRICATE FALSE EVIDENCE against a man they cannot honestly and lawfully convict.If I were giving this movie a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a low ""D"", perhaps even a ""D-"". And why not an ""F""?Well, despite the seriously flawed script, Rooney Mara's performance as a many-faceted person is quite good, and the film DOES provide us with a mildly interesting PUZZLE to piece together, despite its totally wretched conclusion. To draw another comparison, I'm also reminded of an old joke in which a house guest is given breakfast that includes an egg which was turning bad; he politely eats all of it, and when asked how it was, he replies, ""Parts of it were quite good!""",2,IF YOU LIKE PLOT HOLES AND SMARMY PEOPLE ...

Granted, Tatum Channing is in the story so barely that yes if you checked it out purely to see him, then this movie will disappoint (and, no, this movie is NOT '21 Jump Street' in any way, shape or form!  Thank God!)And yes I wasn't quite sure where the story was going during the first 20-30 minutes, either -- but this is not a negative, since it is usually difficult to fully comprehend what is happening in the early stages of a complicated psychological thriller (both 'Memento' and  'Inception' come to mind).  It seems relevant that I recently introduced my teenaged sons to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and for the first half hour they were bored stiff and groaned about being made to continue watching -- until Jack Nicholson's character sucked them in and (of course) by the end they proclaimed it one 'of the best movies ever.'  (Duh)And finally, yes, I think the torid secret relationship between the primary female characters is more than a bit fantastic (i.e., at the outer edges of believability) but truth IS often stranger than fiction, and although not probable, it certain is POSSIBLE.  Many well-done movie plots have stretched the limits of believability (can you say 'Thelma and Louise drive over a cliff'?) and yet somehow the films still work, are still thought-provoking stories which deserve the label of 'good cinema.'Here is what I thought MOST believable about this film:  that the wife who lost everything when her husband went to prison could not forgive him and faked concern simply so she could murder him and, through conniving with her unethical therapist, make a S--TLoad of money at the very same time.  From the very beginning of the film I found it not credible that the Tatum Channing character and his wife seemed to pick back up where they left off so easily after he had been away in prison for 5 years.  But it was this very unbelievability in the beginning which helped make the story more believable in the end, when the viewer begins to realize (along with Jude Law's character) that the wife's forgiving, loving attitudes (and 'depressed victim' posture) were a lie and charade all along.Sorry to be a spoiler, but please watch the movie anyway.  If you like subtlety and detail, you will like this film.  If you enjoy seeing 'truth win' and the marginalized, scapegoated hero obtain redemption in the end (like Tim Robbin's character in Shawshank Redemption, Will Smith's character in Enemy of the People, Kevin Spacey's character in The Life of David Gale, Sandra Bullock's character in The Net) you will ADORE this film.  I myself have been unfairly scapegoated and summarily dumped by everyone I knew as a result -- like Jude Law's character -- and so of course it was very gratifying to watch him persevere in doing whatever it took to clear his name and prevailing in the end all on his own, as a result of his own effort.",5,How could you give this movie only 1 star?,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,3056,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'waste', 'time', 'turned', 'off', 'only', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'totally', 'missed', 'out', 'Granted', 'Tatum', 'Channing', 'story', 'so', 'barely', 'yes', 'checked', 'out', 'purely', 'see', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'NOT', ""'21"", 'Jump', 'Street', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Thank', 'God', 'yes', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'first', '20-30', 'minutes', 'not', 'negative', 'usually', 'difficult', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'what', 'happening', 'early', 'stages', 'complicated', 'psychological', 'thriller', ""'Memento"", ""'Inception"", 'come', 'mind', 'relevant', 'recently', 'introduced', 'teenaged', 'sons', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'first', 'hour', 'were', 'bored', 'stiff', 'groaned', 'being', 'made', 'continue', 'watching', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'sucked', 'course', 'end', 'proclaimed', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'Duh', 'finally', 'yes', 'think', 'torid', 'secret', 'relationship', 'primary', 'female', 'characters', 'more', 'bit', 'fantastic', 'i.e.', 'outer', 'edges', 'believability', 'truth', 'IS', 'often', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'not', 'probable', 'certain', 'POSSIBLE', 'Many', 'well-done', 'movie', 'plots', 'have', 'stretched', 'limits', 'believability', 'can', 'say', ""'Thelma"", 'Louise', 'drive', 'cliff', 'yet', 'somehow', 'films', 'still', 'work', 'are', 'still', 'thought-provoking', 'stories', 'deserve', 'label', ""'good"", 'cinema', 'what', 'thought', 'MOST', 'believable', 'film', 'wife', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'when', 'husband', 'went', 'prison', 'could', 'not', 'forgive', 'faked', 'concern', 'simply', 'could', 'murder', 'conniving', 'unethical', 'therapist', 'make', 'S', 'TLoad', 'money', 'very', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'found', 'not', 'credible', 'Tatum', 'Channing', 'character', 'wife', 'seemed', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'easily', 'had', 'been', 'away', 'prison', '5', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'unbelievability', 'beginning', 'helped', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'believable', 'end', 'when', 'viewer', 'realize', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'wife', 'forgiving', 'loving', 'attitudes', ""'depressed"", 'victim', 'posture', 'were', 'lie', 'charade', 'along.Sorry', 'be', 'spoiler', 'please', 'watch', 'movie', 'anyway', 'like', 'subtlety', 'detail', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'win', 'marginalized', 'scapegoated', 'hero', 'obtain', 'redemption', 'end', 'Tim', 'Robbin', 'character', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'Enemy', 'People', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'Net', 'will', 'ADORE', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'unfairly', 'scapegoated', 'summarily', 'dumped', 'everyone', 'knew', 'result', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'so', 'course', 'was', 'very', 'gratifying', 'watch', 'persevere', 'doing', 'whatever', 'took', 'clear', 'name', 'prevailing', 'end', 'own', 'result', 'own', 'effort']",N/A

I give SIDE EFFECTS four stars because it's absolutely gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed with lots of nice, subtle complications. Despite certain structural flaws, this is one of the few films I'd like to watch again in the near future. The loaded dialogue--e.g., ""Depression is the inability to construct a future""--is meaningful to the ultimate theme of the film. Some sex and violence, but it's tasteful regarding what it shows and does not show. SIDE EFFECTS is NOT just all about wacky prescription drugs and should have much appeal to crime thriller/suspense fans.Some people obviously like the big twists toward the end, but some obviously don't, and I'm more in the latter category. SIDE EFFECTS departs a little too abruptly from its original premise and storyline. Many of the turnabouts are tacked on too neatly and executed too easily. Rooney Mara does a fine job of playing troubled Emily Taylor, but the same sudden shift her character makes with all the other elements of the film renders her motivations a little hard to understand. Still, the very lack of predictability creates a riveting ride. While a bit sensational and not exactly complimentary, SIDE EFFECTS is also very illuminating of the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry.

It seems, however, that all of them have side effects (hence the title); one of them being to  reduce Amy into a trance-like state where she does not remember what she is doing.  During one of these periods she inadvertently murders her husband Martin (Channing Tatum).  Sent to a psychiatric hospital for observation, she continues to be treated by Banks.  As the action folds, however, so Banks becomes more and more suspicious; all is not what it seems in Amy's case.  No one believes him: in the end he suffers unexpected side-effects, both personally and professionally.  However he uncovers a plot involving Amy and her former shrink Dr. Siebert (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Director Steven Soderbergh builds up the tension through skillful camerawork, lighting and a taut script to create a d&eacute;nouement full of unexpected twists and turns.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 14]","I know a little something about the side-effects of psychological drugs, and the way they can go wrong.So the idea of ""Side Effects"" was an interesting one -- a psychiatrist begins to suspect that a drug-induced killing may have actually been a devious murder plot. The first half initially reeks of anti-psychiatric propaganda (seriously, they list just about every antidepressant out there!), but it turns out to be a clever set-up for a Hitchcockian second half.After four years in prison for insider trading, Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released and reunited with his wife Emily (Rooney Mara). But not all is well with Emily. She shows signs of severe depression, even attempting suicide by driving her car into a brick wall, and almost leaping in front of a subway car. Her new shrink Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) tries out several antidepressants, finally settling on an experimental drug called Ablixa.Emily says that the drug is helping her, but it's also causing her to sleepwalk. Then she stabs her husband to death, and claims to remember nothing of it. At first, Banks is tormented by what seems to have been a massive mistake, and the bad press that is threatening to sink his career. But slowly he begins to suspect that Emily may have been faking her symptoms, and that she murdered Martin deliberately.""Side Effects"" left a bad taste in my mouth at first, because through the first half, it seemed to be practically cataloguing every single bad thing that could happen to you if you take antidepressants. It was like watching an anti-depressant propaganda film by the Church of Scientology -- ""if you take antidepressants, you'll end up murdering people! That's how it works!""But Steven Soderburgh twists the entire story around in the second half, when it quietly morphs into a sort of medical noir. He keeps the direction muted, sterile and pale, but there's always the sensation that sharks are swimming just under the story's surface, ready to drag Banks down with them. It has a very Hitchcockian flavor, especially when Banks is faced with false accusations if he keeps digging for the truth.And it brings up some interesting ethical problems. Should he preserve his marriage and career and let a murderer go free, or should he try to do the right thing and risk everything? How can a person be punished if double jeopardy protects them?Jude Law and Rooney Mara are the centerpiece of this movie, and Law is simply brilliant as a devoted, intelligent doctor who is dragged into a dark, twisted little scheme, and has to resort to some dirty tactics to get himself out. Mara isn't quite as memorable -- she does a good job, but she acts dopey ALL the time, even when she's not supposed to be. Catherine Zeta Jones does a decent job as a rather brief character, and Channing Tatum... is mainly there to die.""Side Effects"" starts off on a rather odd footing, but it steadies itself into a quiet, rather unnerving noir mystery in the second half.

Emily (Rooney Mara) is finally reuniting with her husband (Channing Tatum) who's been in prison for four years on insider trading. Past issues of loneliness and vulnerability creep up on her so she sees a shrink (Jude Law) who treats her and proscribes a string of pharmaceuticals. These cause further problems for her including sleepwalking. During one episode she stabs her husband to death. She skates the charge on an insanity plea, but the incident also causes problems for Jude, and as he digs deeper the entire incident takes on a whole new color.I like these kinds of movies. It kept me guessing very close to the end. At a certain point I knew what might happen, but I wanted to know how they would pull it off. Some liken it to a Hitchcock mystery/thriller and they're right. This does start out (as many have noted) as an indictment on the psychiatric/pharmaceutical communities, then changes to thriller gear. I loved the way the story unfolded and how Jude began to put the pieces together. Then they add the note regarding Emily's previous shrink (Catherine Zeta Jones), and Jude's sinking further into a near helpless situation, and I was really hooked. As in the best of Hitchcock, the viewer wants (needs) to see the innocent guy claw his way out of the web.Now for the directing. Soderbergh isn't a flashy director, but this was efficient. I always thought he had the camera in the right place and he seemed to know how to set up one shot to transition into the next. I also liked the color palette. It was a pretty movie with colors being not too washed out nor over-saturated. The performances were good, as was the editing and music.

1636583,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BNWWUDY,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Steven Soderbergh has retired (probably) and SIDE EFFECTS is his swan song. It is a fine psychological thriller with as major statement about the pharmaceutical industry and the rather nonchalant some physicians are dispensing drugs today - drugs that have many potential side effects as the seemingly endless commercials on television advertising drone on. Take Soderbergh's skill as a director, Scott Z. Burns' screenplay, and a dandy group of very fine actors and the result is a film that not only entertains but challenges the viewer's ability to keep all the twists and turns straight.Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released form prison on an insider trader fiasco and returns to his young wife Emily (Rooney Mara) who in Martin's absence has had a miscarriage and rather severe bouts of depression and suicide attempts. She is under the care of psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) having a history of being under the care of Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Dr. Banks prescribes a new anti-depressant Ablixa (the only drug mentioned that is a pentagram instead of a real drug) and among the side effects are somnolence and somnambulism, and while on the drug Emily kills Martin. With Emily plea-bargained into mental hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to tear what's left of his life apart even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy. The story steps into the territory of adultery of a novel sort, lesbianism, casual general drug use/abuse by nearly every character in the story, and forensic medicine as manipulated through psychiatrists' minds.In addition to the main characters, each of whom delivers superb acting, there are some fine contributions by the minor characters as played by Polly Draper, David Costabile, Mamie Gummer, and Ann Dowd. This is a clever story with many at times confusing elements but stay with the action and the thoughts and the piece becomes a well-oiled thriller.

1636619,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BNWWUDY,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.I had some high hopes going into Side Effects. Judging from the trailers this looked like it was going to be an intense psychological thriller that had you sitting on the edge of your seat, and for the first 30-40 minutes that's exactly what you're given. However, this film's climax arrives too early which makes the rest of the film fall flat. Side Effects starts as a psychological thriller, but soon turns into yet another movie about money and it was honestly a little disheartening.The film follows a severely depressed woman by the name of Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara). Her husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison after being arrested four years ago for insider trading. For him this is his chance to start fresh and try to get the two of them back to where they were all those years ago. However, this proves to be more difficult than expected as Emily's depression is slowing down any progress he's trying to make.After a suicide attempt in a parking garage, Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) is assigned as her psychiatrist. In an effort to help control her depression he prescribes a series of SSRI anti-depressants, but none of them have any positive results. After consulting with Emily's old psychiatrist Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) he decides to try a new drug called Ablixa. The drug appears to have some positive results with the only side effect being that she begins sleepwalking.Now this is the first half hour in a nut shell, minus the hard details. If the film would have continued down this path I probably would have loved it, but ten minutes later it switches up completely into something it doesn't need to be. The only positive outcome from this sharp change in direction is that it always keeps you guessing. You never know what's going to happen next or what secrets Jonathan is going to uncover and that's enough to keep you watching. With that said, even though it keeps you guessing none of what you find out is terribly interesting.What really drives this movie forward is the script. The script is extremely well written, even if I don't agree with the direction, and it keeps you on your toes. In a movie like this the script can make or break a film if it's predictable and, luckily, Side Effects if far from predictable. You're probably asking yourself ""Well what's the big twist and why is it so terrible?"" Unfortunately I can't really go into that. It's difficult to explain the change in direction without giving away the big, and unnecessary, plot twist. It's one of those films where if you know what's going to happen then there's no real point in watching it anymore (similar to Butterfly on a Wheel, a fantastic film by the way).The cast mainly consists of four main characters and a group of minor characters. The four main gunners are Mara, Law, Zeta-Jones, and Tatum. Objectively each of these actors gave outstanding performances. Mara in particular did a phenomenal job. Previously I've only seen her in The Social Network, but her role here is an entirely different animal. It's very raw and even chilling at times. Just a fantastic performance from start to finish. In addition to the four leads you get performances from Vinessa Shaw, Ann Dowd, Polly Draper, David Costabile, and Mamie Gummer. No one really gave a terrible performance, but most of the minor characters only received a couple of minutes of screen time.Finally, the musical score in Side Effects is phenomenal. Throughout the movie you'll get to here the lovely sounds of Thomas Newman, who's composed for many films including The Shawshank Redemption, Cinderalla Man, and Brothers. Along with the script, the music in this film really does a great job of grabbing your attention. It's big and grand when it needs to be, but it's also quiet and somber at just the right moments. Thomas Newman is just a fantastic composer who always seems to deliver so I'm not really surprised by how much I loved the score.Overall Score: 7/10 - Side Effects isn't really what I expected, or necessarily wanted, but it would be wrong to deny that it is enjoyable from start to finish. It takes an unexpected turn that I personally wouldn't have OK'd if I was working on the film, but there's not much you can do about it now.

Wish I had seen this on the big screen because it is the best Brian De Palma film since Femme Fatale at least, maybe Raising Cain.  However Netflix provided it just fine, though what is with their new policy of suppressing extras on their rental copies--you have to buy the DVD is you want to see ""Behind the Scenes of Side Effects""?  Good thing I didn't really want to see more of the movie (except maybe of the titanic love scene between Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum) otherwise I might have been serious;y pissed and that ain't pleasant!By now (since this is the 510th review on this site) you probably know the general drift of the movie and how reviewers can't really talk about it past the first 20 minutes or so of the film, otherwise they will be revealing some serious spoilers.  In fact just announcing that there are twists and turns in a film is sort of a spoiler, isn't it?  From the very beginning one is on the lookout, especially when the reviewer says, ""Things are not what they seem.""  But that's just what happens in this.  I for one, even knowing that things are not what they seem, was totally unprepared for the death around which the rest of the story revolves.  Perhaps this is what audiences felt like when Janet Leigh went into the shower in Psycho, and something they just didn't expect occurred on the screen.  But, and I hate to say it, but there's a good chance that Rooney Mara out Psycho's Anthony Perkins in this movie.  She won't win the Oscar, but Tony Perkins didn't either, and the two of them will forever live in the category of immortal screen performances.  I saw the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and it was OK, but here she takes acting to a new level and seems to be having the time of her life doing it!  Maybe David Fincher was overcontrolling and Soderbergh allows her to do whatever she likes on film, but from Mara's very first entrance you know something has changed and she has become a great star.  I wish I had Pauline Kael's way with words, for Kael wrote beautifully about Jane Fonda's emergence from kook oddity to acting greatness when she reviewed They Shoot Horses, Don't They, naming Jane Fonda as the natural successor to Bette Davis--and that shocked The New Yorker readers at the time, for to them Fonda was Barbarella or the girl from Barefoot in the Park.  You know what this movie reminded me of (I mean Side Effects)?  Most of you are too young, but years ago there was a movie called Malice, with Alec Baldwin as a doctor and Bill Paxton and Nicole Kidman as, you know I don't remember what they were (college professors?) and the whole movie shifted after forty minutes into the kind of thing you can't believe you're seeing, allowing, if I may put it this way, Kidman a chance to flex her acting muscles for the first time.  After that, people stopped saying, wow, she's tall, is she from Australia?  Just like Rooney Mara here, she wanted to be bad.  Not good-bad, but evil.OK, Side Effects isn't very good as a movie perhaps (neither was Malice come to think of it) but nowadays any film that provides something a little bit different is worth hunting down, and this has it in Spades.  Maybe it was a mistake to cast Jude Law in the central role, it's too soon after Soberbergh's Contagion in which he was also obsessed with the side effects of pharmaceuticals?  This hits too close to some, baby!  These roles, together with his parts in Gattaca and A.I., show very little range but reveal why he is probably Donna Haraway's favorite star if I know my cyborg theory....",5,Star is Born,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,3666,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Side', 'Effects', 'sneaked', 'theaters', 'was', 'busy', 'dusting', 'room', 'exited', 'just', 'as', 'quietly', 'Wish', 'had', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'best', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'least', 'maybe', 'Raising', 'Cain', 'However', 'Netflix', 'provided', 'just', 'fine', 'what', 'new', 'policy', 'suppressing', 'extras', 'rental', 'copies', 'have', 'buy', 'DVD', 'want', 'see', 'Scenes', 'Side', 'Effects', 'Good', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'movie', 'maybe', 'titanic', 'love', 'scene', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'pissed', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pleasant', 'now', '510th', 'review', 'site', 'probably', 'know', 'general', 'drift', 'movie', 'how', 'reviewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'revealing', 'serious', 'spoilers', 'fact', 'just', 'announcing', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'film', 'sort', 'spoiler', ""n't"", 'very', 'beginning', 'one', 'lookout', 'especially', 'when', 'reviewer', 'Things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'just', 'what', 'one', 'even', 'knowing', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'was', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'death', 'rest', 'story', 'revolves', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'felt', 'when', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'went', 'shower', 'Psycho', 'something', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'occurred', 'screen', 'hate', 'say', 'good', 'chance', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'out', 'Psycho', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'Tony', 'Perkins', 'did', ""n't"", 'two', 'will', 'forever', 'live', 'category', 'immortal', 'screen', 'performances', 'saw', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'was', 'OK', 'here', 'acting', 'new', 'level', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'doing', 'Maybe', 'David', 'Fincher', 'was', 'overcontrolling', 'Soderbergh', 'do', 'film', 'Mara', 'very', 'first', 'entrance', 'know', 'something', 'changed', 'become', 'great', 'star', 'wish', 'had', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'way', 'words', 'Kael', 'wrote', 'beautifully', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'emergence', 'kook', 'oddity', 'acting', 'greatness', 'when', 'reviewed', 'Shoot', 'Horses', 'Do', ""n't"", 'naming', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'natural', 'successor', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'shocked', 'New', 'Yorker', 'readers', 'time', 'Fonda', 'was', 'Barbarella', 'girl', 'Barefoot', 'Park', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'reminded', 'mean', 'Side', 'Effects', 'Most', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'movie', 'called', 'Malice', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'doctor', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'were', 'college', 'professors', 'whole', 'movie', 'shifted', 'forty', 'minutes', 'kind', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'allowing', 'may', 'put', 'way', 'Kidman', 'chance', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'first', 'time', 'people', 'stopped', 'saying', 'wow', 'tall', 'Australia', 'Just', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'here', 'wanted', 'be', 'bad', 'Not', 'good-bad', 'evil.OK', 'Side', 'Effects', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Malice', 'come', 'think', 'film', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'worth', 'hunting', 'down', 'Spades', 'Maybe', 'was', 'mistake', 'cast', 'Jude', 'Law', 'central', 'role', 'too', 'soon', 'Soberbergh', 'Contagion', 'was', 'also', 'obsessed', 'side', 'effects', 'pharmaceuticals', 'too', 'close', 'baby', 'roles', 'together', 'parts', 'Gattaca', 'A.I.', 'show', 'very', 'little', 'range', 'reveal', 'why', 'probably', 'Donna', 'Haraway', 'favorite', 'star', 'know', 'cyborg', 'theory']",N/A

Swanson,"[2, 3]","4.5 starsI knew nothing of this ahead of time, and the first half made it seem like a very well-made look at what a bunch of pill-popping zombies we are turning into. Lots of sweet (really more sour) little shots at the evil pharma companies and their total disregard for everything but money. But then things go sideways and suddenly get even more interesting.Jude carries this film easily, though Mara is also very good. Law is slowly becoming a more and more skilled actor, full of nuance and understated moments that say a lot while showing little. And may I just compliment him on not wearing a wig or getting fake hair? He looks more like the love child of Phil Collins and Sting every film, and hats off to him for keeping the hats and wigs off and aging like a real person, not a Hollyweird joker-faced freak like so many of those phonies are becoming. His sense of honesty informs his role here and as he shifts into gear as it rolls along you really start loving what he's doing and connecting with his nrain.Add to that a solid script from Burns and very nicely measured direction and editing and composition from Soderberg and you've got a relatively quiet movie that says a bunch while never having to scream its messages, as some of SS's earlier films do. He says he's retiring, but he'll be baaaack. He's too good at this game, and too willing to tell truths our society needs to face up to, to not resume his mastery of the cinematic arts.The blu-ray is a good transfer, and though the extras are barely ten minutes, the three minute making of is a very sarcastic send-up of how good stars have it on set. The fake ads for Ablexa are also all too accurate, especially the interactive quiz where every yes answer leads to Law telling you how this lovely drug will solve all your issues. While as usual the side effects roll by in small print. Oh, you know, nausea and dizziness and suicide, just the normal things.In decades to come, if we get smart enough to start trusting nature over big-money-run science again, Side Effects will be seen as a very wry and chilling look at how easily we have let ourselves be turned into zombies by people whose only interest is profit. Oh, and social control, of course. That's where the really big money is.Perhaps Soderberg will come back with a film that mentions how most of the school shootings have been done by kids on anti-depressants. Not that there's any connection with doping up children every day for years and them becoming insane, mind you. We couldn't say that without any lawsuits now, could we? Let's just say that it's a potential side effect.I think this movie had to be turned into a thriller to get made by a studio, but what Soderberg really wants to say is, WAKE UP! We're all uncomfortably numb these days, and the pills ain't helping most of us. They're only making it worse.But, you know, side effects...",5,"Bound to be a subtle classic, a touchstone for our legally doped up era",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2884,"['4.5', 'starsI', 'knew', 'nothing', 'ahead', 'time', 'first', 'half', 'made', 'seem', 'very', 'well-made', 'look', 'what', 'bunch', 'pill-popping', 'zombies', 'are', 'turning', 'Lots', 'sweet', 'really', 'more', 'sour', 'little', 'shots', 'evil', 'pharma', 'companies', 'total', 'disregard', 'everything', 'money', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'sideways', 'suddenly', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.Jude', 'film', 'easily', 'Mara', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Law', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'skilled', 'actor', 'full', 'nuance', 'understated', 'moments', 'say', 'lot', 'showing', 'little', 'may', 'just', 'compliment', 'not', 'wearing', 'wig', 'getting', 'fake', 'hair', 'more', 'love', 'child', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'Sting', 'film', 'hats', 'off', 'keeping', 'hats', 'wigs', 'aging', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'Hollyweird', 'joker-faced', 'freak', 'so', 'many', 'phonies', 'are', 'becoming', 'sense', 'honesty', 'informs', 'role', 'here', 'gear', 'really', 'start', 'loving', 'what', 'doing', 'connecting', 'nrain.Add', 'solid', 'script', 'Burns', 'very', 'nicely', 'measured', 'direction', 'editing', 'composition', 'Soderberg', ""'ve"", 'got', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'movie', 'bunch', 'never', 'having', 'scream', 'messages', 'SS', 'earlier', 'films', 'do', 'retiring', ""'ll"", 'be', 'baaaack', 'too', 'good', 'game', 'too', 'willing', 'tell', 'truths', 'society', 'face', 'up', 'not', 'resume', 'mastery', 'cinematic', 'arts.The', 'blu-ray', 'good', 'transfer', 'extras', 'are', 'barely', 'ten', 'minutes', 'three', 'minute', 'making', 'very', 'sarcastic', 'send-up', 'how', 'good', 'stars', 'have', 'set', 'fake', 'ads', 'Ablexa', 'are', 'also', 'all', 'too', 'accurate', 'especially', 'interactive', 'quiz', 'where', 'yes', 'answer', 'Law', 'telling', 'how', 'lovely', 'drug', 'will', 'solve', 'issues', 'as', 'usual', 'side', 'effects', 'roll', 'small', 'print', 'Oh', 'know', 'nausea', 'dizziness', 'suicide', 'just', 'normal', 'things.In', 'decades', 'come', 'get', 'smart', 'enough', 'start', 'trusting', 'nature', 'big-money-run', 'science', 'again', 'Side', 'Effects', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'very', 'wry', 'chilling', 'look', 'how', 'easily', 'have', 'let', 'be', 'turned', 'zombies', 'people', 'only', 'interest', 'profit', 'Oh', 'social', 'control', 'course', 'where', 'really', 'big', 'money', 'is.Perhaps', 'Soderberg', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'how', 'most', 'school', 'shootings', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'kids', 'anti-depressants', 'Not', 'connection', 'doping', 'up', 'children', 'day', 'years', 'becoming', 'insane', 'mind', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'lawsuits', 'now', 'could', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'potential', 'side', 'effect.I', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'turned', 'thriller', 'get', 'made', 'studio', 'what', 'Soderberg', 'really', 'say', 'WAKE', 'UP', ""'re"", 'uncomfortably', 'numb', 'days', 'pills', 'ai', ""n't"", 'helping', 'most', ""'re"", 'only', 'making', 'worse.But', 'know', 'side', 'effects']",N/A

There are clearly two more movies to be made in the trilogy, but for whatever reason, those haven't happened yet. When everyone was starting to forget about her, along comes ""Side Effects"".It's hard to think of a director with a better track record than Stephen Soderbergh. He's had a few duds, but he's made more excellent films in the past decade than anyone who immediately springs to mind. ""Side Effects"" could be his last picture. The director has announced that he wants to take extended time off from directing films, and that's very sad to me. Because ""Side Effects"" is a masterful film that gets better and better with each viewing.I had the pleasure to see ""Side Effects"" in the theater. It's one of the most genuinely surprising films I've seen in a long time. It follows Emily (Mara), a depressed young woman, who after a suicide attempt, starts on a new antidepressant drug under the care of her doctor, Dr. Banks (Jude Law). Bad things happen and people get hurt.It's pivotal that you know as little about this movie as possible when you go into it. There are so many twists and turns, and it is so clever. Every time when you think you know where this movie is going, it takes a surprising turn. After a pivotal event happens in the film's first act, the whole game changes. Everything becomes much more interesting. A very tangled web is weaved. It stops before it becomes farfetched and ridiculous. It's a postmodern Hitchcock thriller. The scary part is the realism, and how possible this stuff is.It's really two different movies. At first, it's an expose on the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. It's also an engaging psychological thriller in the vein of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". When a film tries to be more than one kind of movie, it usually crashes and burns, but that isn't the case here. I enjoyed both entries in this ""double feature"" immensely.Not to mention, there is flawless acting from everybody involved here. Soderbergh has a knack for getting good performances out of his actors. Rooney Mara is Oscar worthy, in my humble opinion. You never exactly know how to feel about her character, and she clearly realizes that this is important. that is.

She's happy, her sex drive improves, her husband is happy and things appear to be progressing. Emily is exposed to one side effect however. She sleepwalks. During one of these episodes, tragedy ensues and Emily is arrested. But who is to blame? Emily, the drug manufacturer or the doctor (Banks) who prescribed it?A previous shrink (excellent Catherine Zeta-Jones) Emily had seen while her husband was in prison re-enters the picture as a collaborator with Dr. Banks.

Heck, that sentence alone is a bit of a spoiler.  So I'll apologize in advance if I appear to give less information than I should about the film.  I'm assuming you haven't heard too much about it, and might enjoy discovering the film on its own.Director Steven Soderbergh has made a slow-burning movie here.  It never really moves at a fast pace, but it maintains a pretty high level of intensity throughout.  It is a film that deals pretty directly with how Americans are perhaps a very over-medicated society, particularly when it comes to anti-depressants.  And how we don't always know about all the ""side effects"" (hence the name of the film).  But to his credit, he's pretty non-preachy about it.  Some of the things people do in this film while under these drugs are pretty scary...but it's all presented in a non-alarmist way.  It acknowledges that these drugs have a place in our society as well.There are four star performances here.  Least successful is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a psychiatrist who may have some nefarious motives.  Her part is a bit unrealistic and feels more like a caricature.  Channing Tatum is more successful as a Wall Street trader just getting out of prison for some insider trading, and looking to readjust to life on the outside and to find his new place in the world.  Tatum doesn't LOOK like a typical ""wall street tycoon"" that one might see in film (he's no Michael Douglas or even Charlie Sheen)...but he brings nice touches to the domestic side of his life in his scenes with Rooney Mara, who plays his deeply troubled wife.  This is Mara's film to win or lose, and she does a nice job.  The temptation in a role like hers would be overact...but Soderbergh is interested in having his team UNDERPLAY things.  He's got a compelling story to tell and there's plenty of suspense to be had.  But he's playing it more like a `70s political thriller than a `00s potboiler...and the film is all the more admirable for that.  And Mara gets her tone just right.As does Jude Law as her psychiatrist.  He's every bit her equal, and he gives us a nuanced character that we root for and root against at varying turns.  He can be either genuinely ingratiating or repulsive.  Law has always been a terrific actor, but never QUITE made it to real stardom.  It would appear as he moves into the ""middle age"" of his career, he's going to give some really solid character turns (his recent work in ANNA KARININA is another example...he stole that film).  Yes, he's fun in the new SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise...but a lot of actors could have played that part.  But when he's called upon to give a real, rounded performance, he delivers the goods.Some may find the pacing of SIDE EFFECTS to be just a little too deliberate.  As I implied, it is a slow-burning affair.  But it has genuine excitement and surprise, a mostly intelligent script (the Zeta-Jones character being the exception), very competent direction and some very nice performances.  It's certainly for an adult audience with a decent attention span.

1636710,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00BNWWUDY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Side Effects (Steven Soderbergh, 2013)How in the flying hell do I review Side Effects? Every problem I had with the film (and they are legion) comes after the Big Twist(TM) that appears about halfway through, and which has been remarkably unspoiled by the media&#8212;I may even be revealing too much by saying that there is, in fact, a Big Twist. The interesting thing is that before that happens, this is Soderbergh's best movie since The Limey, his last great one. There is actually an attempt in the script to make the psychology more than pop-psych 101, and despite my low expectations for anything Soderbergh does these days, I found myself grudgingly impressed. Having Jude Law on board didn't hurt, either, as the doctor spouting all that comforting-yet-incisive stuff. I didn't even hate Channing Tatum in the first half of this movie, and that takes some doing. But then, well, Scott Z. Burns (who also collaborated with Soderbergh on Contagion) had to go and make a huge Gordian knot of everything. The problem with Gordian knots is that if you don't tie them tight enough, they end up full of holes.Plot: Law (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) plays Jonathan Banks, a psychiatrist who is called to the bedside of Emily Taylor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Rooney Mara), a woman who just tried to commit suicide by driving her car into a wall the day after her husband Martin (Tatum, of Magic Mike) was released from prison after doing a stint for insider trading. This being the twenty-first century, Banks prescribes her antidepressants, but nothing seems to work for her, and after a consultation with her former psychiatrist, Victoria Siebert (Chicago's Catherine Zeta-Jones), and enticed by a fifty thousand dollar stipend from a drug company, he prescribes a new SSRI called Ablixa...with disastrous consequences. (This is not a spoiler, as the first shot of the film shows the consequences.) But, it turns out, and I am going to consider this not a spoiler since you may find yourself looking at your watch and wondering what Soderbergh's going to do with the other hour of this movie, all of this is setup for what is really going on here......about which I cannot tell you a blessed thing, as above, as far as what's actually going on. I will tell you that what's actually going on quickly morphs into something bog-standard. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, when you've got a cast of this caliber. Fifteen years ago, Soderbergh might have been able to turn this into a stylistic treat, if one laden with empty calories, and that you probably would have forgotten a month or two after seeing it. But pre-Ocean's Soderbergh and post-Ocean's Soderbergh are two entirely different beasts (all the evidence you need can be had by contrasting 1999's The Limey and 2011's Haywire), and the current incarnation of Soderbergh makes this into exactly the sort of wet-cardboard mess one would expect. Still, the performances by the mains, especially Law and Mara, are credible enough to make it worth watching, even if you find yourself groaning rather regularly by the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. ** ",3,...may include drowsiness.,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,3125,"['Side', 'Effects', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', '2013', 'How', 'flying', 'hell', 'do', 'review', 'Side', 'Effects', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'are', 'legion', 'Big', 'Twist', 'TM', 'halfway', 'been', 'remarkably', 'unspoiled', 'media', '8212', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'saying', 'fact', 'Big', 'Twist', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Soderbergh', 'best', 'movie', 'Limey', 'last', 'great', 'one', 'actually', 'attempt', 'script', 'make', 'psychology', 'more', 'pop-psych', '101', 'low', 'expectations', 'anything', 'Soderbergh', 'days', 'found', 'grudgingly', 'impressed', 'Having', 'Jude', 'Law', 'board', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'doctor', 'spouting', 'comforting-yet-incisive', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hate', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'doing', 'then', 'well', 'Scott', 'Z.', 'Burns', 'who', 'also', 'collaborated', 'Soderbergh', 'Contagion', 'had', 'go', 'make', 'huge', 'Gordian', 'knot', 'everything', 'problem', 'Gordian', 'knots', 'do', ""n't"", 'tie', 'tight', 'enough', 'end', 'up', 'full', 'holes.Plot', 'Law', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'called', 'bedside', 'Emily', 'Taylor', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'driving', 'car', 'wall', 'day', 'husband', 'Martin', 'Tatum', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'was', 'released', 'prison', 'doing', 'stint', 'insider', 'trading', 'being', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Banks', 'prescribes', 'antidepressants', 'nothing', 'work', 'consultation', 'former', 'psychiatrist', 'Victoria', 'Siebert', 'Chicago', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'enticed', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'stipend', 'drug', 'company', 'new', 'SSRI', 'called', 'Ablixa', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'not', 'spoiler', 'first', 'shot', 'film', 'consequences', 'out', 'am', 'going', 'consider', 'not', 'spoiler', 'may', 'find', 'looking', 'watch', 'wondering', 'what', 'Soderbergh', 'going', 'do', 'other', 'hour', 'movie', 'setup', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'blessed', 'thing', 'above', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'quickly', 'morphs', 'something', 'bog-standard', 'Which', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'cast', 'caliber', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'Soderbergh', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'turn', 'stylistic', 'treat', 'one', 'laden', 'empty', 'calories', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'forgotten', 'month', 'two', 'seeing', 'pre-Ocean', 'Soderbergh', 'post-Ocean', 'Soderbergh', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'beasts', 'evidence', 'need', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'contrasting', '1999', 'Limey', '2011', 'Haywire', 'current', 'incarnation', 'Soderbergh', 'exactly', 'sort', 'wet-cardboard', 'mess', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Still', 'performances', 'mains', 'especially', 'Law', 'Mara', 'are', 'credible', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'find', 'groaning', 'rather', 'regularly', 'last', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', '**']",N/A

Crawford,"[6, 8]","If you are looking for an update on the film noire - a caper that speaks to contemporary issues and conditions of life - you cannot do better than this film.  Though I will talk of details in the film, I will avoid spoilers.The film starts off with the image of violence in a home, then cuts to a drama of depression.  A beautiful young woman appears to be fighting for her life, her eyes, her every motion afflicted with existential pain.  Her husband, a crooked financier, is about to leave prison.  She has been waiting for him for 4 years, in a job with supportive boss who understands depression from personal experience.  After an attempt to hurt herself, she goes to see an ambitious young psychiatrist, who seems genuinely concerned and goes the prescription route, which is so commonplace today.  As they run through traditional medications, the psychiatrist finally hits on an experimental one that he happens to be testing as a ""consultant for pay"" to a big pharma company.  For a time it appears to work, then the woman suddenly becomes murderously violent, but perhaps only for a single instance.As the case reaches the media, the doctor's life falls apart.  Did he make mistakes?  Was he ethically compromised?  Did he have ulterior motives?  Is he going crazy?  Or was he somehow set up?  The process becomes one of investigative backtracking, which in his desperation only the doctor believes may help.  It is a story of an intricate and completely believable journey that in the end reveals that no one involved is who they appeared to be.  In the delightful psychological twists, as only a great thriller can do, the viewer's perceptions of the characters is challenged again and again, with mounting fear and horror.This is an absolute delight for connoisseurs of the noire genre, a deliciously wicked puzzle of moral ambiguity and revealed evil.

1636717,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00BNWWUDY,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2Steven Soderbergh's ""Side Effects"" is like a smooth-running train that suddenly derails halfway to its destination. What starts off as a compelling social drama about depression, the pharmaceutical industry and medical ethics suddenly becomes a Hitchcockian brew of false accusations, deception and retribution. It's not that the second half is bad per se - the movie is compulsively watchable from first minute to last - but one feels cheated by the loss of so much potential and promise.Rooney Mara plays a young woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison for insider trading. Emily has long been the victim of depression and, when she attempts suicide, she comes under the care of a seemingly ethical psychiatrist (Jude Law) who prescribes an experimental drug for her. After a tragedy brought on by the medication, the two are suddenly plunged into a crisis that could mean jail time for Mara and the loss of both license and practice for Law.So far so good, as the screenplay by Scott Z. Burns examines the many thorny ethical issues surrounding the over-medicating of patients, the impersonal nature of Big Pharma, the prevalence of medical malpractice and the legal complications that often result when mental illness and prescription drugs are crucial factors in a crime. Burns has created a cast of characters who are believable and empathic, individuals we can clearly identify with because they are caught in a tragedy not necessarily of their own making. But then the writer throws it all away by turning the whole thing into a thriller made up of secret alliances, double and triple crosses, and craftily executed revenge. As stated earlier, Soderbergh pulls it off like a master, but one regrets that the movie turns what could have been an insightful and profound look into a serious social issue into just another melodramatic whodunit.The acting is excellent throughout, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ann Dowd rounding out the ensemble.You won't be able to turn it off, but you also might feel a bit cheated in the end.",3,a potential home run that turns into a solid double,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,2071,"['***1/2Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Side', 'Effects', 'smooth-running', 'train', 'suddenly', 'halfway', 'destination', 'What', 'off', 'compelling', 'social', 'drama', 'depression', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'medical', 'ethics', 'suddenly', 'Hitchcockian', 'brew', 'false', 'accusations', 'deception', 'retribution', 'not', 'second', 'half', 'bad', 'se', 'movie', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'first', 'minute', 'last', 'one', 'feels', 'cheated', 'loss', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'promise.Rooney', 'Mara', 'young', 'woman', 'husband', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'insider', 'trading', 'Emily', 'long', 'been', 'victim', 'depression', 'when', 'suicide', 'care', 'seemingly', 'ethical', 'psychiatrist', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'prescribes', 'experimental', 'drug', 'tragedy', 'brought', 'medication', 'two', 'are', 'suddenly', 'plunged', 'crisis', 'could', 'mean', 'jail', 'time', 'Mara', 'loss', 'license', 'practice', 'Law.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Z.', 'Burns', 'many', 'thorny', 'ethical', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'over-medicating', 'patients', 'impersonal', 'nature', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'prevalence', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'legal', 'complications', 'often', 'result', 'when', 'mental', 'illness', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'are', 'crucial', 'factors', 'crime', 'Burns', 'created', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'believable', 'empathic', 'individuals', 'can', 'clearly', 'identify', 'are', 'caught', 'tragedy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'own', 'making', 'then', 'writer', 'away', 'turning', 'whole', 'thing', 'thriller', 'made', 'secret', 'alliances', 'double', 'triple', 'crosses', 'craftily', 'executed', 'revenge', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Soderbergh', 'off', 'master', 'one', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'insightful', 'profound', 'look', 'serious', 'social', 'issue', 'just', 'melodramatic', 'whodunit.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'rounding', 'out', 'ensemble.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'off', 'also', 'might', 'feel', 'bit', 'cheated', 'end']",N/A

One is about the possible side effects of OTC's (Yes, over the counter has to be included) and in this case Prescription Medications and the other story is about greed, lust and revenge. I loved the premise of this story that involves the side effects of medications that range from itching to death and the possibility of murder.This story is very well acted by all with Jones (Dr. Seibert) and Law (Dr. Banks) taking their roles to heart and their co stars preforming equally well. The direction and the story is where this movie takes a hit by allowing the typical Hollyweird junk in to spoil this story somewhat.I will try to be careful and not spoil to much if any of the story by detailing the rediculous actions that the director/writer allowed to take place. I know they do some of these stupid things so the can keep the stars in the spotlight and or directly involved in the story, but come on lets try and get somewhat real!  Dr. Banks has a ethical and moral conflict with his patient Emily (Rooney Mara) that has caused him so much trouble and yet he is still treating her?  Dr. Banks does some pretty crazy things that shall we just say are a little OTT (over the top) and not very well planned or thought out for his problems. The DA's actions and reactions to Dr. Banks initial meeting about his findings involving Emily's case was not quite believable considering what he did. The DA just wanted to forget about everything and let to case run its course. WTH?The story was not as well thought through as it should have been and instead of a really intelligent and thought provoking thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast we have a good thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast.I'm not sure if the clues were given to us to let us know that something was up with Emily or if they were just oversites. Two really stuck out and smacked me in the nose. One was when Emily was at work and the other was a cop. I am not saying what happens or how it happens just what to look for. There are others, but these really stuck out. For me it would have been much better not getting any clues whether intended or not.The story does have a few twists, but they just don't live up to a Hitchock type thriller/mystery moment or movie for that matter. I think everyone will enjoy the ending to this a little better than average movie with its talented cast.I will give this a 3.5 star rating for the acting and an ok story that had a lot of promise, but suffered from some strange SIDE EFFECTS1Rating 0 to 5Story = 3Acting = 4+Direction = 3Thriller/Mystery = 3Gore/Violence = 1Sex/Nudity = Yes/Yes limited to 3 scened I believe.Cursing = Yes, but very sparinglyEntertainment Value = 3.5",3,Buyer Beware,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2757,"['Side', 'Effects', 'story', 'story', 'One', 'possible', 'side', 'effects', 'OTC', 'Yes', 'counter', 'be', 'included', 'case', 'Prescription', 'Medications', 'other', 'story', 'greed', 'lust', 'revenge', 'loved', 'premise', 'story', 'side', 'effects', 'medications', 'range', 'itching', 'death', 'possibility', 'murder.This', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'Jones', 'Dr.', 'Seibert', 'Law', 'Dr.', 'Banks', 'taking', 'roles', 'heart', 'co', 'stars', 'preforming', 'equally', 'well', 'direction', 'story', 'where', 'movie', 'hit', 'allowing', 'typical', 'Hollyweird', 'junk', 'spoil', 'story', 'somewhat.I', 'will', 'try', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'spoil', 'much', 'story', 'detailing', 'rediculous', 'actions', 'director/writer', 'allowed', 'take', 'place', 'know', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'can', 'keep', 'stars', 'spotlight', 'directly', 'involved', 'story', 'come', 'lets', 'try', 'get', 'somewhat', 'real', 'Dr.', 'Banks', 'ethical', 'moral', 'conflict', 'patient', 'Emily', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'caused', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'yet', 'still', 'treating', 'Dr.', 'Banks', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'things', 'shall', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'little', 'OTT', 'top', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'planned', 'thought', 'out', 'problems', 'DA', 'actions', 'reactions', 'Dr.', 'Banks', 'initial', 'meeting', 'findings', 'involving', 'Emily', 'case', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'believable', 'considering', 'what', 'did', 'DA', 'just', 'wanted', 'forget', 'everything', 'let', 'case', 'run', 'course', 'WTH', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'instead', 'really', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'thriller', 'extremly', 'talented', 'attractive', 'cast', 'have', 'good', 'thriller', 'extremly', 'talented', 'attractive', 'cast.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'clues', 'were', 'given', 'let', 'know', 'something', 'was', 'up', 'Emily', 'were', 'just', 'oversites', 'Two', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'smacked', 'nose', 'One', 'was', 'when', 'Emily', 'was', 'work', 'other', 'was', 'cop', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'what', 'how', 'just', 'what', 'look', 'are', 'others', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'getting', 'clues', 'intended', 'not.The', 'story', 'have', 'few', 'twists', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Hitchock', 'type', 'thriller/mystery', 'moment', 'movie', 'matter', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'little', 'better', 'average', 'movie', 'talented', 'cast.I', 'will', 'give', '3.5', 'star', 'rating', 'acting', 'ok', 'story', 'had', 'lot', 'promise', 'suffered', 'strange', 'SIDE', 'EFFECTS1Rating', '0', '5Story', '=', '3Acting', '4+Direction', '3Thriller/Mystery', '3Gore/Violence', '1Sex/Nudity', '=', 'Yes/Yes', 'limited', '3', 'scened', 'believe.Cursing', '=', 'Yes', 'very', 'sparinglyEntertainment', 'Value', '=', '3.5']",N/A

While this one is probably closer to 3-1/2 stars than four, it's still well-made and pretty engrossing, story-wise.The story seems simple enough - a young woman (Rooney Mara), suffering from depression after her husband (Channing Tatum) is released from several years in jail for insider trading, tries to commit suicide by smashing her car. A psychiatrist (Jude Law) she meets in the hospital ER becomes her therapist, eventually prescribing an experimental drug for her that results in side effects leading to a horrible tragedy.Initially you think this is the crux of the film - the controversy of how easily we (both patients and healthcare officials) will take any pill we think will cure all - but as with any Soderbergh film not everything (or everyONE) is what/who they seem, and the film evolves into a thriller with enough twists to make a pretzel maker happy (and the film worth seeing).While I loved the story, script and actors - and, ultimately, the film - at the same time I just felt the performances were (intentionally?) a little sterile, keeping me from getting emotionally close to any of the main characters (to some degree intentional, I think, but saying anything more would come to close to a spoiler).

Mara plays her part with inscrutable,dark mysteriousness.There are no foundations to the effects of the drug or the character of Emily.Emily sleep walks and still appears suicidal. Mara is phenomenal.Jonathan seeks counsel from Victoria Siebert(Zeta-Jones),Emily's former therapist,who seems to know more than she is willing to reveal.The vulnerability upon which our expectations of Mara are built are soon switched by Soderbergh/Burns's genre-morphing. As with medication we don't know what the long-term effects of each character's moral ambiguity will be.In the next part of the film Dr Banks becomes the central part of the film. Thrown into scandal when his patient is involved in a tragic accident after taking Ablixa.He slowly unravels as his decisions come back to haunt him,and he has to cross several moral boundaries to get his life back on track in a wrong man procedural(aka Hitchcock).His frustrations expertly played by Jude Law.However everything is never what it seems. At times there is a slippery quality and slickness to the proceedings as there are fakers and bigger fakers,a world of double crosses and blackmail where we ourselves are manipulated. Then tricksy mechanics and narrative pirouettes in an impeccable craft makes the story's centre of gravity elusive,its not the story itself but the way it is presented that grabs us.

How can you not trust someone like that, eh? OBTW, he was getting paid by the two Pharmaceutical houses who were making the stuff at the time.It's very difficult to describe much without spoiling the film, so I'll leave the plot intricacies to others. Suffice to say Law (who is great) begins a ""treatment"" of Rooney Mara with that casual explanation we've all been fed; that somehow - by messing with the the serotonin and dopamine processes in a brain we barely understand, we suppose these chemicals are a scientific answer. In addition, his position as psychiatrist places him as both pawn of the drug company whose approval he seeks, as well as lord and master of an institutionalized patient. There are two hidden and dangerous untruths peddled implicitly by Law's character:One is that mental distress is a result of physical abnormalities (fluid imbalance) and these psychiatric drugs: the  anti-psychotics, SSRI's, ADD chemicals - are a scientific answer by ""medicine,"" despite more and more evidence to the contrary.While I agree with another reviewer that it would be a stretch to see Jude Law's character actually in-reality be put in charge of his previous patient (Mara) after all that's transpired up to that point in the film, THE POINT IS that Psychiatry Professors have - as class projects - pretended symptoms to be admitted to Psychiatric hospitals as patients, and then once admitted, returned to their ""normal selves."" They were REFUSED DISCHARGE! It is not so easy to prove one is sane, and in this country - thanks to Big Pharma -  taking the lowest form of Grad Student, the one with the juvenile personality, and allowing them extraordinary power through the creation of Psychiatry's DSM, its accompanying insurance code, medication and authoritative status within the Justice System, we've created something ""other"" outside the normal justice system. This is the TRUTH the film drives home, and the fascist power resulting.The DVD that is a MUST SEE is ""The Marketing of Madness,"" which documents much of these heinous activities. Big Pharma has spent millions to discredit it, but the truth is out there for those who will get up off their knees before their psychiatrist or their addictions to psychiatric meds obtained thru their normal doctors and dare to see they've been ""had.""I've personally walked through the fire of incompetent shrinks, massive doses of anti-psychotic drugs and then having to come off them. Heroin addiction is actually easier to get off than these psychiatric drugs. Remember the motto of a top Big Pharma exec: ""You don't want to kill the patient; and you dont want to cure the patient."" That just leaves ""hooking"" the patient on a drug that will have you in so much mental anguish, anxieties and vulnerabilities trying to get off of it that it can drive people to mass murder. Soderburgh tackles this, and except for a giggle from the movie ""Carnage"" is the only film maker to do so. He has pointed out basic truths, and made a heck of a statement about the unnatural, evil power that Psychiatry and Big Pharma possess; leaving the plot as clothing for this deeper purpose.What is shown here is the lie that the Psychiatrist ""really knows."" This is merely a subjective human being with - in reality - very little training to be successful in the one-on-one ""talking cure"" that we all used to associate with therapy, but instead, has tremendous (and growing) power - in every way, shape and form - over the lives of the people who come to them.",5,Big Pharma Revealed for First Time,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,3963,"['done', 'artfully', 'when', 'movie', 'dark', 'injustice', 'feel', 'called', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'psychiatric', 'lies.The', 'purpose', 'film', 'make', 'people', 'aware', 'feet-of-clay', 'possessed', 'Psychiatry', 'bereft', 'empathy', 'genius', 'full', 'drugs', 'control.This', 'first', 'film', 'fearlessly', 'face', 'biggest', 'rip-off', 'Freud', 'recommended', 'cocaine', '1920s', 'claimed', 'left', 'dependence', 'urge', 'consume', 'more', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'someone', 'eh', 'OBTW', 'was', 'getting', 'paid', 'two', 'Pharmaceutical', 'houses', 'who', 'were', 'making', 'stuff', 'time.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'describe', 'much', 'spoiling', 'film', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'plot', 'intricacies', 'others', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Law', 'who', 'great', 'treatment', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'casual', 'explanation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fed', 'somehow', 'messing', 'serotonin', 'dopamine', 'processes', 'brain', 'barely', 'understand', 'suppose', 'chemicals', 'are', 'scientific', 'answer', 'addition', 'position', 'psychiatrist', 'places', 'pawn', 'drug', 'company', 'approval', 'as', 'well', 'lord', 'master', 'institutionalized', 'patient', 'are', 'two', 'hidden', 'dangerous', 'untruths', 'peddled', 'implicitly', 'Law', 'character', 'One', 'mental', 'distress', 'result', 'physical', 'abnormalities', 'fluid', 'imbalance', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'anti-psychotics', 'SSRI', 'ADD', 'chemicals', 'are', 'scientific', 'answer', 'medicine', 'more', 'more', 'evidence', 'contrary.While', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'would', 'be', 'stretch', 'see', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'actually', 'in-reality', 'be', 'put', 'charge', 'previous', 'patient', 'Mara', 'transpired', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'POINT', 'IS', 'Psychiatry', 'Professors', 'have', 'class', 'projects', 'pretended', 'symptoms', 'be', 'admitted', 'Psychiatric', 'hospitals', 'patients', 'then', 'once', 'admitted', 'returned', 'normal', 'selves', 'were', 'REFUSED', 'DISCHARGE', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'prove', 'one', 'sane', 'country', 'thanks', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'taking', 'lowest', 'form', 'Grad', 'Student', 'one', 'juvenile', 'personality', 'allowing', 'extraordinary', 'power', 'creation', 'Psychiatry', 'DSM', 'accompanying', 'insurance', 'code', 'medication', 'authoritative', 'status', 'Justice', 'System', ""'ve"", 'created', 'something', 'other', 'normal', 'justice', 'system', 'TRUTH', 'film', 'home', 'fascist', 'power', 'resulting.The', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'Marketing', 'Madness', 'documents', 'much', 'heinous', 'activities', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'spent', 'millions', 'discredit', 'truth', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'up', 'off', 'knees', 'psychiatrist', 'addictions', 'psychiatric', 'meds', 'obtained', 'thru', 'normal', 'doctors', 'dare', 'see', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'walked', 'fire', 'incompetent', 'shrinks', 'massive', 'doses', 'anti-psychotic', 'drugs', 'then', 'having', 'come', 'off', 'Heroin', 'addiction', 'actually', 'easier', 'get', 'off', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'Remember', 'motto', 'top', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'exec', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'patient', 'dont', 'want', 'cure', 'patient', 'just', 'hooking', 'patient', 'drug', 'will', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'mental', 'anguish', 'anxieties', 'vulnerabilities', 'trying', 'get', 'can', 'drive', 'people', 'mass', 'murder', 'Soderburgh', 'giggle', 'movie', 'Carnage', 'only', 'film', 'maker', 'do', 'so', 'pointed', 'out', 'basic', 'truths', 'made', 'heck', 'statement', 'unnatural', 'evil', 'power', 'Psychiatry', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'possess', 'leaving', 'plot', 'clothing', 'deeper', 'purpose.What', 'shown', 'here', 'lie', 'Psychiatrist', 'really', 'merely', 'subjective', 'human', 'being', 'reality', 'very', 'little', 'training', 'be', 'successful', 'one-on-one', 'talking', 'cure', 'used', 'associate', 'therapy', 'instead', 'tremendous', 'growing', 'power', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'come']",N/A
1636754,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B00BNWWUDY,The Separator,"[0, 0]","Drugs and depression. Steven Soderbergh takes both subjects head- on in Side Effects, a film that examines how the lives of a group of individuals inevitability become tied together by mental illness and chance.Emily Taylor&#8217;s (Rooney Mara) life is on the brink of total collapse. After waiting four years for her husband to get out of prison, her depression finally overtakes her. She ends up in the Emergency Room after a failed suicide attempt. Here she encounters Doctor Jonathan Banks (Jude Law).Jude Law doesn&#8217;t seem a likely psychiatrist, but it doesn&#8217;t matter, he pulls it off and all the other characters fall into line around him; although Jude Law is the heart of the film, Soderbergh is undeniably at the helm here. He is the brain. Soderbergh&#8217;s characters habituate their New York City with 100% believability, believability so intense in fact, it is haunting.The viewer envies the characters and their glamorous lives, even more as they destroy themselves. The viewer needs to remind themself that these characters do not exist, and this is a fiction, be it an excellently written one by Scott Z. Burns. As a screenwriter I watch this film as a lesson in how to build intersecting plot lines.Banks comes across as a doctor legitimately interesting in helping people, so when Emily claims to be living in a depressive fog Banks takes on the task of trying his best to help her. Emily&#8217;s condition begins to improve, but in the midst of the improvement tragedy strikes, and it threatens to bring down both patient and doctor.As a psychiatrist Dr. Banks did what psychiatrists do, he prescribed drugs. Then more drugs. Then even more drugs. Even though it seems absurd at times just how many medications are being dolled here, for anyone who has ever experienced psychiatric treatment, they will realize that these procedures are standard. So is this a jab at psychiatry&#8217;s habit of throwing handfuls of pills at people in mental distress? However mind-boggling it may be that the treatment for nearly every mental condition is medication, this film doesn&#8217;t come across as serious critique of psychiatric drugs, or the pharmaceutical industry.There is a fog covering the whole film, figuratively in the melancholic tone, and literally in the shades of grey of the cinematography. This fog further complicates an already complex plot, but once you can piece together what has occurred, as I did hours afterwards, you will not be able to shake this film&#8217;s dark presence.In the end it is not drug use that is being criticized here, but rather the avaricious soul-sucking void, the characters' needs to engulf their surroundings, and the sociopathic culture that made them this way.Amazing!Get more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,Best film of 2013!

1636763,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BNWWUDY,Turfseer,"[62, 84]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects', first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, to appreciate it.Rooney Mara (looking quite more appealing than her stint as angry Goth in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), plays Emily Taylor, a seemingly depressed wife of her husband Martin (Channing Tatum), who has just come home after doing four years in prison for insider trading.When it appears that she tries to kill herself by slamming her car into a wall in a parking garage, she's assigned to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks (winningly played by Jude Law). Banks is a fairly typical psychiatrist who prescribes one psychotropic medication after another, hoping that Emily's mood will change. Still feeling forlorn, Banks consults with Emily's former psychiatrist, Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who recommends that Emily be placed on a new experimental drug, Ablixa. Banks takes the pharmaceutical company's money and convinces Emily to participate in the study.The stakes are raised when seemingly despondent Emily stabs husband Martin to death but claims she can't remember anything and blames everything on the Ablixa. Suddenly, Banks is no longer the complacent psychiatrist but is now a scapegoat, as the press blames him for dispensing the medication which everyone assumes is the cause of Emily's violent outburst. His patients start leaving him in droves and he's investigated by the State Licensing Board. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company drops him as one of the testers of the Ablixa study.Soon, Banks figures out that there's something much more sinister underfoot. Like Hitchcock's 'Wrong Man', he now must clear his name. As Emily has taken a plea bargain in which she pleads guilty by reason of insanity, Banks is assigned to be her psychiatrist at the Ward's Island Criminal Psychiatric facility, and has full say as to whether she will be eventually released or not. And here is where I had the biggest problem with this film. If Banks' reputation is so in tatters (he's been smeared in the press) and the state licensing board is investigating him, why would the court even entertain the idea that he should continue to be involved with Emily? And without this caveat, the film's denouement, could never develop as it does.So let's suspend our disbelief over this major plot point and see whether the rest of 'Side Effects' has any more credibility. As it turns out, Banks does indeed figure out that Emily was faking all along that she was depressed. He also discovers that Banks turned out to be the former lover of her former psychiatrist, Victoria, who convinces Emily to participate in an incredible scheme to drive the stock price down of pharmaceutical company who's been promoting Ablixa. By selling short, Emily and Victoria end up making a bundle but once Banks figures everything out, he forces Emily to wear a wire and rat out Victoria.It's pretty much a fantastic scheme and again it involves more suspension of disbelief, since it's not guaranteed that the stock price will go down that much, where the two schemers, will actually make a big profit. Nonetheless, it could remotely happen. Banks being in cahoots with the Assistant District Atttorney to turn Emily but then falsifying her personality profile and illegally ordering her to take mind numbing psychotropic medications such as Thorazine, to shut up her up, seems beyond the pale. Would an ADA risk his job to participate in such an illegal, revenge scheme? I hardly think so.It's also a bit ironic that a psychiatrist who exceeds his authority by authorizing the administration of psychotropic medications when they are not needed, appears justified, since the patient in question, has gotten away with murder. Whether you like this final scenario or not, one wonders why Emily didn't have an attorney who could have worked to expose Banks' illegal actions. It just seemed a little too easy in the way that Banks, along with his allies, so easily were able to keep Emily as a zombie (all doped up with her medications), without any other third parties becoming involved in her case, and perhaps discovering that the 'good guys' (i.e. Banks and company), were suddenly doing a bunch of bad things.'Side Effects' is a passable 'Hollywood-type' thriller.
