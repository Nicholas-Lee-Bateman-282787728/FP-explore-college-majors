I believe this is the last season of Toni, sad to see her go she was muchly missed in the last two seasons. Tracee Ellis Ross is such a firecracker!

This season feels so short and un interesting that it left me feeling like ""THATS IT""?! I mean really? no nothing? this has alot to do with the production being done while the show was on air. the dvd should be alot cheaper sadly the first 2 dvds are alot better. the story lines maybe slow to get to the point but its just a flat cake. of course there are good things but. i didnt orgasam at the last episode. it was a real big disapointment. when i saw these episode on tv they just show the contuniations the next day. but it really wasnt a big deal. the seasons bad. it started off ok it rekindled some type of light then snuffed it out at the end. this dvd sucks",3,I felt Jipped,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1243,"['season', 'Joans', 'J', 'SPOT', 'Gets', 'turned', 'around', 'Wayne', 'brady', 'numerous', 'cute', 'guest', 'appereances', 'spinn', 'whic', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'very', 'lightly', 'gam', 'here', 'life', 'change', 'station', 'then', 'remember', 'watching', 'dvd', 'main', 'character', 'game', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'lynn', 'brother', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'sure', 'felt', 'are', 'only', '3', 'discs', 'dvd', 'case', 'broke', 'second', 'time', 'i', 'opned', 'i', 'know', 'sellers', 'fault', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'cases', 'set', 'have', 'broken', 'season', 'so', 'short', 'un', 'interesting', 'left', 'feeling', 'THATS', 'IT', 'mean', 'really', 'nothing', 'alot', 'do', 'production', 'being', 'done', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'dvd', 'should', 'be', 'alot', 'cheaper', 'sadly', 'first', '2', 'dvds', 'are', 'alot', 'better', 'story', 'lines', 'maybe', 'slow', 'get', 'point', 'just', 'flat', 'cake', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'i', 'didnt', 'orgasam', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'real', 'big', 'disapointment', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'episode', 'tv', 'just', 'show', 'contuniations', 'next', 'day', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'seasons', 'bad', 'started', 'off', 'rekindled', 'type', 'light', 'then', 'snuffed', 'out', 'end', 'dvd', 'sucks']",Girlfriends: Season 6
1217678,AD2FJHFQ8EIG5,B001MVWM6Q,"Gauntletwielder ""gauntletwielder""","[5, 14]","Based on the merits of Season One, I bought the remaining five seasons.  That was a BIG mistake.  ""Girlfriends"" followed the same path as ""MASH"".... it went from comedy to drama... but in a shorter time span.  Some episodes were so dramatic that they were absolutely painful to watch.  The characters ""Joan"" and ""Lynn"" are both AWFUL.  Joan is so neurotic and unattractive (i.e. Rosanna Rosanadanna hairdo, BIG eyes and nose) it is not funny.  Lynn is an unfunny, selfish, inconsiderate, lazy parasite who avoids work and grown up responsibilities.  ""Girlfriends"" would have been a much better show if Joan and Lynn were written off in the first season and the show remained a comedy.This is the last season of the series.  Friends of mine keep saying ""It was a great show!  I don't know why it got cancelled.""  I know why.  It went downhill....steeply.  ""Girlfriends"" became more of a soap opera than a comedy.  Maya, Toni and William are the only funny characters, when there is some humor in a show.The last episode of season six is real painful to watch.  Nothing amusing about it.Do yourself a favor and stay clear of seasons 2 through 6.  SEASON ONE IS GREAT!

The cast, Tony, Maya, Jone, and Lynn were the perfect picks for this wonderful show.  Season seven, without Tony was not the best, but it was ok and when it comes out, I will definitely buy it to finish off my set.  I found season six to be one of the most interesting seasons, not as funny as season 1-5, but definitely one of the best seasons to watch.  It showed how much the girls had grown.  The custody battle with Tony & Todd, Jone's owning her own restaurant/club, Lynn professional music career, Maya's book and her new home in an upscale neighborhood.  It showed a different side of the girls.  Tony embracing motherhood, Jone trying to fit in, Maya and Darnell making strides, and Lynn, well, Lynn is just Lynn, what can I say.
