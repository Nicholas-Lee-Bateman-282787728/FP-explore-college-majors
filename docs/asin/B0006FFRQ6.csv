865603,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0006FFRQ6,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","This movie did not deliver. I love black comedy like the ""Friday"" movies (except for the last one) but this was NOTHING like Friday. In fact, it was extra lame. There were a few funny scenes but not the way you want them to be. I have to agree with most of the previous comments, here, that this movie will most likely be pretty offensive to most black viewers. It's loaded with stereotypes and predictable humor.That aside, I did get a chuckle out of a few of the characters. Tim Meadows' conspiracy whacko character was twisted and amusing. Meadows have a talent for subtle humor with over-the-top characters. This sounds like a contradiction, but it isn't. Danny Glover gets a few laughs in as the heavily ""ball & chained"" neighbor. It helps that his ball in chain happens to be Farrah Fawcett, I suppose. Both Mr. Meadows and Mr. Glover's characters were somewhat stereotypical and unoriginal, but both actors made them work, because they're pros. That old man with a stick was kind of goofy. I mildly enjoy Queen Latifah though, even in a ridiculously written role she was believable and hilarious at times. She at least made it worth my time. I will say Tim Meadows was the highlight of the movie and his lines totaled approximately 5 minutes of dialogue.I found Jennifer Lewis' character to be intensely annoying. She was supposed to come off as ""strong"" and as the pillar of the family, but if I had a parent like her, I'd go to huge lengths to avoid her. Just watching her in a movie made me uncomfortable. I'm surprised that Todd's prospective client didn't head for the hills, immediately. Those grotesque fat twins were annoying. The pot smoking scene with them and Mertaw was horrendous. I was disgusted with the way they looked and acted. Ja Rule was very annoying as Bling Bling and his sidekick was just as awful. The dude Big Pu//y from The Sopranos was OK as a doo doo salesman. Rapper Storm P (aka Quran Pender) as Todd Anderson who played the young, newly-drafted NBA star did a pretty decent job in his role. Eve finally play a sweet character. For a hardcore rapper who always plays tough minded characters,  it was nice to see her lovable and supple but the time she spent on the screen looked more like a cameo.""The Cookout"" has more flaws then virtues, and it will certainly offend anybody concerned with improving the image of African Americans, but it does have its brief moments but I won't recommend this being that it's unrealistic and forgettable.",2,"""The Cookout"" is not that fulfilling.",1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2478,"['movie', 'did', 'not', 'deliver', 'love', 'black', 'comedy', 'Friday', 'movies', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'NOTHING', 'Friday', 'fact', 'was', 'extra', 'lame', 'were', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'not', 'way', 'want', 'be', 'have', 'agree', 'most', 'previous', 'comments', 'here', 'movie', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'pretty', 'offensive', 'most', 'black', 'viewers', 'loaded', 'stereotypes', 'predictable', 'humor.That', 'aside', 'did', 'get', 'chuckle', 'few', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'conspiracy', 'whacko', 'character', 'was', 'twisted', 'amusing', 'Meadows', 'have', 'talent', 'subtle', 'humor', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'contradiction', ""n't"", 'Danny', 'Glover', 'few', 'laughs', 'heavily', 'ball', 'chained', 'neighbor', 'ball', 'chain', 'happens', 'be', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'suppose', 'Mr.', 'Meadows', 'Mr.', 'Glover', 'characters', 'were', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'unoriginal', 'actors', 'made', 'work', ""'re"", 'pros', 'old', 'man', 'stick', 'was', 'kind', 'goofy', 'mildly', 'enjoy', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'even', 'ridiculously', 'written', 'role', 'was', 'believable', 'hilarious', 'times', 'least', 'made', 'time', 'will', 'say', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'was', 'highlight', 'movie', 'lines', 'totaled', 'approximately', '5', 'minutes', 'dialogue.I', 'found', 'Jennifer', 'Lewis', 'character', 'be', 'intensely', 'annoying', 'was', 'supposed', 'come', 'off', 'strong', 'pillar', 'family', 'had', 'parent', ""'d"", 'go', 'huge', 'lengths', 'avoid', 'Just', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'uncomfortable', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Todd', 'prospective', 'client', 'did', ""n't"", 'head', 'hills', 'immediately', 'grotesque', 'fat', 'twins', 'were', 'annoying', 'pot', 'smoking', 'scene', 'Mertaw', 'was', 'horrendous', 'was', 'disgusted', 'way', 'looked', 'acted', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'Bling', 'Bling', 'sidekick', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'awful', 'dude', 'Big', 'Pu//y', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'OK', 'doo', 'doo', 'salesman', 'Rapper', 'Storm', 'P', 'aka', 'Quran', 'Pender', 'Todd', 'Anderson', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'newly-drafted', 'NBA', 'star', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'Eve', 'finally', 'play', 'sweet', 'character', 'hardcore', 'rapper', 'who', 'always', 'tough', 'minded', 'characters', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'lovable', 'supple', 'time', 'spent', 'screen', 'looked', 'more', 'cameo', 'Cookout', 'more', 'flaws', 'then', 'virtues', 'will', 'certainly', 'offend', 'anybody', 'concerned', 'improving', 'image', 'African', 'Americans', 'have', 'brief', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'forgettable']",The Cookout

The lead character is gorgeous and all the supporting characters played their role to a tea.  I think there's something a little off IN REAL LIFE about the sidekick who got sprayed by a skunk, but other than that, the movie was an honest portrayal about what happens when people run into money, capture their dreams as a basketball player, and black family cookouts.  Yes, there were quite a few stereotypes in this movie (rent-a-cop, thugged out villains, materialistic basketball player, golddiger, butler of a black household who makes collard greens, smoked out/country cousins), but it's not like this is hard to believe.  I can start pointing these people out on the street right now.  I thought the movie was entertaining and through comedy, pointed out some serious lessons to learn. 1) You find out who your friends are by watching how they act when you get money. 2) Every woman who likes you doesn't necessarily like YOU.  3) Family is one of the most important parts of keeping a wealthy person grounded.  4) There is more to life than basketball--stop holding brothas back when they don't want to dribble.

I don't think there is one original idea in this film.Just a few stereotypes that stood out were:- The young black guy getting drafted, as if that is all that young black guys aspire to.- The young attractive goldigger girlfriend- The overprotective mother and goofy father- Once blacks move into the neighborhood all of their family come, which are always ghetto, and take over the neighborhood- The ""cool"" white guy that is down with everyone.Geez!Now moving on to the predictability:- From the getgo, did we not know that he would get picked?- It was so obvious way before Eve came in the picture that the goldigger girlfriend would get dropped and that Eve would get the guy.There was no real substance to the film, so other than those 2 points, nothing else was really going on. Farah Fawcett??? Why???I really don't think that I laughed once the entire film. The characters that Queen Latifah and Danny Glover played were just plain embarassing. So over the top and NOT funny. I really don't like this film and probably will never watch it again.I really like the lady that plays the mom (can't remember her name), Queen Latifah and Danny Glover, but I cannot recommend this film.
