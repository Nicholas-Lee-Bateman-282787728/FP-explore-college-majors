396270,A3DKVSMDRVCL0X,6304018940,Helluva Godtime,"[11, 11]","I came to ""Reckless"" the film after seeing the revival of the play of the same name. I had really enjoyed it, and have always been a fan of Craig Lucas. I kept asking myself, ""Why haven't I seen this?"" I had to go to four different video stores all over New York City before I could find a copy, but it was worth it.This is the story of Rachel (Mia Farrow, who's hilarious), a woman who, on Christmas Eve, is informed by her husband that he has taken out a contract on her. A gunman will be there in five minutes to shoot her and make it look like a botched roobery. She jumps out the window, clad only in her nightgown, and is picked up by Lloyd (the great Scott Glenn), a man with a shady past. Lloyd and his wife Pooty (Mary-Louise Parker, who played Rachel to perfection in the revival) take Rachel in, and they become fast friends.I'm not going to say anymore, for fear that I might give too much away. Also, to someone who hasn't seen it, it can get mighty confusing. Just rent it or buy it, no matter what lengths you have to get it. The touching final scene is worth the price of the shipping alone!",5,Why isn't this on DVD?,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1107,"['came', 'Reckless', 'film', 'seeing', 'revival', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'had', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Craig', 'Lucas', 'kept', 'asking', 'Why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'had', 'go', 'four', 'different', 'video', 'stores', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'could', 'find', 'copy', 'was', 'worth', 'it.This', 'story', 'Rachel', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'hilarious', 'woman', 'who', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'informed', 'husband', 'taken', 'out', 'contract', 'gunman', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'five', 'minutes', 'shoot', 'make', 'look', 'botched', 'roobery', 'out', 'window', 'only', 'nightgown', 'picked', 'up', 'Lloyd', 'great', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'man', 'shady', 'past', 'Lloyd', 'wife', 'Pooty', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'who', 'played', 'Rachel', 'perfection', 'revival', 'take', 'Rachel', 'become', 'fast', 'friends.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anymore', 'fear', 'might', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Also', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'can', 'get', 'mighty', 'confusing', 'Just', 'rent', 'buy', 'matter', 'what', 'have', 'get', 'touching', 'final', 'scene', 'price', 'shipping', 'alone']",Reckless VHS

396272,A3IOBAANEH0WS4,6304018940,"Paul J. Smith ""archcorenth""","[9, 9]",Reckless is a black comedy based on a Broadway play of the same title (which recently has had a revival).  It's about a naive young mother of two (Mia Farrow) who is forced out of her home one Christmas by her husband and begins a bizarre odyssey spanning the holidays of several years.  To tell any more of the plot would be to give away some of the best jokes and you should watch this cold the first time.  Suffice it to say that it is a wonderful mix of side splitting humor and a heartwarming story of personal growth (without the least bit of saccharine).,5,My Family's Favorite Christmas Movie.,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,561,"['Reckless', 'black', 'comedy', 'based', 'Broadway', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'recently', 'had', 'revival', 'naive', 'young', 'mother', 'two', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'forced', 'home', 'one', 'Christmas', 'husband', 'bizarre', 'odyssey', 'spanning', 'holidays', 'several', 'years', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'best', 'jokes', 'should', 'watch', 'cold', 'first', 'time', 'Suffice', 'say', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'side', 'splitting', 'humor', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'personal', 'growth', 'least', 'bit', 'saccharine']",Reckless VHS
