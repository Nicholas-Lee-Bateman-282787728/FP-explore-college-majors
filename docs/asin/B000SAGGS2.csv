I hoped that this would have much of the same, but I was very dissapointed.The Good Things:-Zach Ward (dude from ""Titus"") makes a good bad guy-Slow motion gunfighting looks nifty-A few memorable lines...I think...The Bad Things:-As I said above, it has none of the bloody action or sex that made the first one fun-In fact, it has hardly any action at all.  It's boring!-It doesn't feel right as a western.  The medieval setting worked better-Cameramanship is terrible (they shook it way too much)-I don't know how historically accurate any of this is (probably not...but you wouldn't be watching this for quality work anyway!)-There are lots of stereotypes-Natassia Malthe looks great, but she doesn't really portray an appealing character.  All she does is act tough, and it feels like a contrive effort.  Kristanna Loken did better at Rayne.It's pretty crummy.  If you even liked the first film, or if you like westerns or horror or both, rent this and see how bad it is for yourself.This package makes up for it by supplying the first computer game (I like to think that I bought the game and it came with a free movie).

If you don't believe me, look through all my reviews of movies I've seen.Boodrayne 2: Deliverance is a direct-to-DVD sequel to Bloodrayne. Instead of the lovely Kristanna Loken playing the lead role, this time- it is played by Natassia Malthe(who is pretty awesome, in her own right). The story takes 'Rayne to the old west as she battles a gang of outlaw vampires led by Billy the Kid in the western town of Deliverance.While Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance isn't a vampire western quite up to the caliber of, say, Sundown;  it is worth a watch at least once. It is a fairly decent timekiller but one you'll quickly forget. Where the movie goes wrong with me is that the acting is quite dry and uninspired. While Malthe is a joy to look at and very sexy, that can only hold the film for so long. I wish Boll had cast actors that were well-known. It may have made a difference with this movie.Sadly, not unless you find this in a bargain bin somewhere for a five-spot, this is a rental- at best.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 5]","What could possibly be worse than the most horrendously lifeless, plotless, horrendously acted, laughably choreographed movie in many a year, directed by the most reviled director?Why, a sequel, of course.And while ""Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance"" doesn't succeed in actually being worse than its predecessor, it does succeed in being almost as bad. Slipshod production, ghastly acting and a truly laughable central plot (oh come on, a vampire Billy the Kid versus the Ms. Romanian Bustier?) all weight down the flimsiest of campy vampire flicks. It makes for a good drinking game, though.The railroad is coming to the Not-So-Wild West town of Deliverance... and so are some nasty vampiric desperados, led by Billy the Kid. Entre Rayne (Natassia Malthe), a dhampir with lots of leather and some faux-medieval weaponry -- and after she finds some corpses in the snow (which seems to appear and reappear at random), she head to Deliverance.Billy the Kid is ruling the place now, and she's a-fixin' to clean up that town (sorry, I had to say it). Turns out that Billy is not satisfied with Deliverance -- he plans to build an army, and he has spectacular powers that surprise even Rayne. Cue lots of gunshots, faux-Western banter and the occasional Brimstone guy in jail.When the director thinks that people are so stupid that the first line must inform where the movie is set (""Wow! The Wild West!""), you know things can only go downhill. This stinker of a plot might have barely worked in the hands of a cinematic genius, but in the hands of Boll, it's a disaster. Even worse, Boll appears to taking the plot seriously, rather than playing it for camp value.And after the choppy, spasmodic style of ""Bloodrayne,"" the sequel goes the other way -- the entire movie oozes by at the pace of half-dried mud, with a lot of Rayne stalking around, staring at people, and occasionally having long, boring showdowns and conversations. Occasionally extras get killed for scares, or random shots are rendered in epic slow-motion, such as Rayne's horse walking through a river. Not an important river, just a river. Because it looks cool.In other words, Boll seems totally bored and his actual participation is sporadic -- although his enthusiasm flares up at the funniest times, such as the absurdly silly showdowns. In the meantime, he lets the movie marinate in shaky, meandering camerawork and murky lighting, as well as a long stream of truly ghastly dialogue (""A woman alone won't be able to handle those bloodsuckers!"" ""Your fly's open"").I will say this -- the gorgeous Malthe seems like a decent actress, mostly via her body language, her voice and her eyes. Too bad she's forced to spout faux-Western dribble like ""That ain't the work of no bandits!"" and ""You reckoned I'd given up lookin' for you?"" She actually looks pretty miserable, as if wondering how she ended up in this ghastly movie.""Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance"" doesn't manage the heights of hysterical wretchedness as the first movie, but Boll's sleeping-on-the-job direction and ghastly script make this a minor trainwreck.

1085873,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000SAGGS2,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[0, 6]","This is a train wreck.  I can't even get into how bad this movie is.  If you thought the first was bad enough because it made no sense in the Bloodrayne universe, this one is ten times worse.  Usually I don't mind terrible movies from time to time because they at least have an unintentional comedy factor due to absurdity; this happened in the first one quite a bit.  This really doesn't happen at all during the second one.  In fact I'm simply in shock that Uwe Boll was commissioned to do a second installment of Bloodrayne.  The story was so completely botched that I can't believe another film was allowed to be made.  I truly hope this is the end for Bloodrayne's stint on the big screen (or should I say direct to DVD specials).This is a Wild West Bloodrayne story.  That's right... you heard me... Wild West.  At this point you just have to accept the fact that this happened before Rayne was technically supposed to be around.  You just have to accept the fact how bad this story premise is in its own right.  Okay... whoever said ""wouldn't it be cool to see Rayne fight against Billy the Kid, but if Billy was a vampire.""  Should have been shot.  They should've stopped that person right there and said ""please leave the room... now.""  Obviously that didn't happen because here we are and you're reading my review.  Basically this revolves around the story of Billy the Kid waltzing into a town, essentially taking it over with his gang and turning people into vampires etc.  He holds the town hostage by kidnapping everyone's children.  Interesting move.  Anyway, Rayne is going to step in and take him down, only after she finds some completely random ally's to help her out.  Some of which never even get names, like ""The Preacher.""  He's one of the good guys on her ""special"" team and that's seriously his name in the credits.  Clearly a lot of thought went into this film.  How they find these extra people is never explained either... it's just terrible with no depth at all.The least redeeming quality of this film is its lack of unintentional comedy.  Usually when films get this bad they tend to generate a few chuckles from me at how bad or absurd a scene is.  But this film doesn't even do that.  The closest it gets is that whenever someone important dies the death is automatically in slow motion!  Kind of like the video game, but way more lame for some reason.  It was a lot cooler in the game.  Also, maybe it's just me, but it always felt like the camera was shaking... I don't know if anyone else noticed, but it was horribly annoying.  Okay, I still can't get over how bad this script is.  Now I certainly do not mind the use of profanity or vulgar concepts.  Seriously, look at the other things I've reviewed.  But when vulgarity and profanity is forced for no apparent reason it just comes out bad.  There's simply no tact or wit.  I know, I know... we're talking about an Uwe Boll film based around Rayne in a Wild West adventure that makes nose sense, but d**mnit I want my profanity to be worthwhile!I know this is going to sound weird, but the one good part of this film is actually Zack Ward's performance as Billy the Kid... probably because he played the role as more of an elite vampire rather than a cowboy.  If he could get caste in a Bloodrayne movie as a real vampire villain he'd do pretty well.  At that point they'd have to get a suitable writer (*cough* hire one of the guys that wrote the video game *cough*) and also get a suitable girl to play the role of Rayne.  Speaking of which Natassia Malthe was actually a worse Bloodrayne than Kristanna Loken.  I know that sounds pretty messed up because Loken's performance wasn't anything exciting.  Maybe Malthe would've been better in the first film, because it felt like she was better at acting out some of the combat scenarios where Loken felt insanely awkward in the first movie.  Malthe was also way to passive, she didn't have that ultra aggressive quality you'd expect from Rayne.  In the end we still haven't found the right girl to play Rayne.  Speaking of changing things around, seriously, we need a new director.  Maybe we should commission James Cameron to make up for the horrid first two films, since I clearly have no budget to think of here.  I think Rayne could be successful on the big screen for fans of the game and non-fans alike if they'd just make it a bigger production.  As a character Rayne's even more interesting than Selene in Underworld.  Don't get me wrong... Kate Beckinsale is an infinitely better actress in this role than anyone that has been in BloodRayne.  Selene is a cool character concept, but in some regards Rayne is a little cooler in my opinion.  Underworld is a good example of a large scale production Vampire movie that works.  (Not the sequel so much, but the first was great!)Before I finish this up, I seriously have to ask.  Why were vampires dying by regular bullets in this movie?  They made special note that you needed bullets blessed with holy water and so on to kill the vampires... yet at the end the regular town folk using their guns shot and killed a few vampires.  Not to mention... Billy the Kid was ultimately killed by a Gatlin gun with regular bullets.  This makes NO sense.  None at all.  He shouldn't even be dead.  They even say in the film he can get shot and he'll heal without even drinking blood.  Seriously, this script writer was an idiot.  It's like he forgot halfway through the movie what was written in the first half.  They need to hire someone that's an expert in continuity to explain how flow works...Alright, I'll stop ranting and wrap this up.  If you're familiar with the video game or the comic books you're going to hate this movie.  The game and comics at least work into the same time frame and same fantasy universe, but the movies are doing something completely different.  The only similarity is Rayne's blades and the ones in the movie aren't even designed the same way, not to mention her costumes aren't even the same in the movies.  The one other interesting thing on here is they have a ""video comic"" available.  Basically you can read through the issue of ""Tibetan Heights"" and at that point realize you'd rather be reading the comic than watching the movie.  I'm surprised the comic publisher agreed to put their quality product on here.  Maybe they figure the movie is so bad they'll get more sales when theirs is better.  Unfortunately ""Tibetan Heights"" isn't exactly the first in the series, but it's one of the better issues in my opinion.  That's really all I have to say about this movie.  As a director's cut they should've just cut out the entire movie and left us with the video game that comes with it.  At least the video game is better... a LOT better.",1,Amazingly... this is worse than the first!,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,6761,"['train', 'wreck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'how', 'bad',

1085881,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000SAGGS2,Mel Odom,"[20, 24]","Based on a computer/console video game franchise developed by Terminal Reality, BLOODRAYNE 2: DELIVERANCE doesn't quite pick up after the first BloodRayne movie. Several hundred years have passed, and Rayne seems to have become a cowboy, er, cowgirl, in the meantime. Maybe a bounty hunter. I'm not quite sure because it was never revealed. With the time jump, the franchise gets even more convoluted and - to a degree - confusing.Rayne is a dhampir, a cross between a vampire and a human, and her father was a Vampire King. In the original video game, Rayne was battling Nazis, and those are supposed to be the villains in the third movie. The sequel video game, which is included with the DVD to up the value packaging of the film, takes place in the present.As it turns out, Rayne (Natassia Malthe) has come hunting Billy the Kid (Zack Ward) because, as everyone knows, Billy the Kid is a vampire hundreds of years old. She ends up riding with Pat Garrett (Michael Pare), who is a member of the Brimstone Society, the group of vampire hunters that's been around for hundreds of years.Billy the Kid has ridden into the small town of Deliverance where he hopes to turn the children into vampires in time to take over the area. A train is about to start coming through the town and he'll have access to rapid transportation for his vampire gunslingers. Unfortunately for him, two of the kids he's captured were the children of Rayne's friends.There's no way to know how or when Rayne got to meet these friends, but she has them. As soon as she knows that Billy the Kid's responsible for the deaths of the parents and the capture of the children, she rides off to mete out justice. She also meets Pat Garrett, who is hot on the trail of Billy the Kid himself. He offers to join forces, but - of course - she passes on that.In Deliverance, it doesn't take Rayne long to get into more trouble than she can handle. She's quickly overcome and tossed into jail to be hung later.The movie, even though it was billed as a horror-Western, really weighs in more heavily as a Western. The dialogue and the plot's movements and pacing pretty much mirror every B Western movie ever filmed. The hero confronts the villain, has to escape and regroup, then go out to recruit a group to come back and storm the villain's stronghold.There's not much plot here, and even less character building. Thankfully Malthe can carry the barely-there costume and looks good doing martial arts. For some reason, though, the costume on the DVD cover actually looks more skimpy than the one she wears in the movie, and I honestly had to wonder if the DVD cover costume was just airbrushed in.If you're not expecting much from the film, and I wasn't wanting anything more than a diversion with some martial arts mayhem, gunplay, snappy dialogue, and a hawt heroine, you'll probably get your money's worth. This is a DVD to sit down with your buddies with over a bowl of popcorn and prepare to lampoon the plot, the predictability, the pacing, and the characterization. That's what you do with campy horror movies.I liked some of the look of the film. There were parts that had an edgy otherworldliness to them that worked. But even that was cheapened by the weak theatrics. One of the best parts was the trap Billy the Kid set for Rayne when he had the kids she'd come to save strung up from nooses. (Even that stretched credulity, though, because then you had to ask yourself why he'd go to all the trouble if he knew she was coming back. Why not set a better trap to kill her before she even got back into Deliverance?)Unfortunately, both the beginning of the film and the end of it have fuzzy footage. I don't know what caused that, but it looks like straight footage you'd get off an ill-focused handheld video camera. I was entirely too aware of a film being shot and thinking how I would have tried to fix that than to enjoy the scenes.This is director Uwe Boll's fourth movie adaptation, after ALONE IN THE DARK and HOUSE OF THE DEAD.

1085883,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000SAGGS2,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 2]","The good Dr. Boll has outdone himself by following the lacklusterBloodRaynewith a sequel so bad that it givesHouse of the Deada run for its money. While I'm a fan of direct-to-video cinema and am quick to forgive quirks that come with a limited budget, knowing that this film probably wouldn't have been made any differently under Boll even if it had an extra $10 million to spend erases the empathy I might have held for the movie otherwise and allows me to embrace the enmity that I've come to harbor for the director's output.The story: an 1880s western town has fallen to vampire infestation, headed by the notorious and bloodthirsty Billy the Kid (Zack Ward,Titus). Searching for old friends, vampiric femme fatal Rayne (Natassia Malthe,Elektra) rides in to save the day, but is nearly destroyed by the Kid's henchmen. Aided by cowboy Pat Garret (Micheal Par&eacute;,Streets of Fire), she mounts a counterstrike against Billy's plan to use the railroad to create an army of cowboy vampires with which to conquer the New World.The original ""Bloodrayne"" feels nothing short of Oscar-worthy by the standards of ""Deliverance;"" at least the first film had Ben Kingsley and a couple of mountaintop camera shots to its credit. The sequel, however, has Boll's new favorite actor Zack Ward giving the most atrocious performance of his career alongside some of the most boring storytelling and poor video production that I've seen in some time.  There's a grand total of maybe three laughable action scenes in the movie, and veterans of the director's previous three adaptations will need no reminding that there's no hope of plot intrigue to help us waste the time between fights away. Plainly, it's the convoluted parts ofAlone in the Darkall over again.While I expected the dramatic content to be bad, it's the technical aspects of the film that take the cake for pure shoddiness. These are the worst production values I've ever seen in a Boll movie. For example, the film takes place in the Wild West, but it literally looks like a bunch of actors are playing dress-up around some renovated old landmarks - everything and everybody looks just a bit too clean. Where actual filming is concerned, the movie has two kinds of camera angles: clich&eacute;d ones and bad ones (in other words, if it's not a slow-motion shot of a horse's hooves galloping through a puddle, it's a shot so wide that it would fit into a documentary about the Savannah). The ""shaky camera"" effect is employed ad nauseum: while some films benefit from the mood and tension such a technique can instill, the impression ""Deliverance"" gave me is that the crew was simply too lazy to set up a tripod.Natassia Malthe looks cool in her outfit, but she doesn't hold a candle to Kristanna Loken's original performance (how sad is that?), and the special effects are pitiful - just a few more nitpicks on the way to trying to prove what a truly dreadful film this is. If I had to praise one aspect, it would be Par&eacute;'s performance, which is acceptable given his immersion into the B-movie genre, but don't bank on him saving the movie. The only reasons that you would need to see this is if you enjoyed the prequel or if you have the same fascination that Boll apparently had about seeing vampires and the wild west mixed.",1,"""Big speech... small guns... you tryin' to compensate for somethin'?""",1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,3290,"['good', 'Dr.', 'Boll', 'outdone', 'following', 'lacklusterBloodRaynewith', 'sequel', 'so', 'bad', 'givesHouse', 'Deada', 'run', 'money', ""'m"", 'fan', 'direct-to-video', 'cinema', 'am', 'quick', 'forgive', 'quirks', 'come', 'limited', 'budget', 'knowing', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'differently', 'Boll', 'even', 'had', 'extra', '10', 'million', 'spend', 'empathy', 'might', 'have', 'held', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'embrace', 'enmity', ""'ve"", 'come', 'harbor', 'director', 'output.The', 'story', '1880s', 'western', 'town', 'fallen', 'vampire', 'infestation', 'headed', 'notorious', 'bloodthirsty', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'Titus', 'Searching', 'old', 'friends', 'vampiric', 'femme', 'fatal', 'Rayne', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'Elektra', 'save', 'day', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'Kid', 'henchmen', 'Aided', 'cowboy', 'Pat', 'Garret', 'Micheal', 'Par', 'eacute', 'Streets', 'Fire', 'counterstrike', 'Billy', 'plan', 'use', 'railroad', 'create', 'army', 'cowboy', 'vampires', 'conquer', 'New', 'World.The', 'original', 'Bloodrayne', 'feels', 'nothing', 'short', 'Oscar-worthy', 'standards', 'Deliverance', 'least', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'couple', 'mountaintop', 'camera', 'shots', 'credit', 'sequel', 'however', 'Boll', 'new', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'giving', 'most', 'atrocious', 'performance', 'career', 'most', 'boring', 'storytelling', 'poor', 'video', 'production', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'grand', 'total', 'maybe', 'three', 'laughable', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'veterans', 'director', 'previous', 'three', 'adaptations', 'will', 'need', 'reminding', 'hope', 'plot', 'intrigue', 'help', 'waste', 'time', 'fights', 'away', 'Plainly', 'convoluted', 'parts', 'ofAlone', 'Darkall', 'again.While', 'expected', 'dramatic', 'content', 'be', 'bad', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'take', 'cake', 'pure', 'shoddiness', 'are', 'worst', 'production', 'values', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Boll', 'movie', 'example', 'film', 'place', 'Wild', 'West', 'literally', 'bunch', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'dress-up', 'renovated', 'old', 'landmarks', 'everything', 'everybody', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'clean', 'Where', 'actual', 'filming', 'concerned', 'movie', 'two', 'kinds', 'camera', 'angles', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ones', 'bad', 'ones', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'slow-motion', 'shot', 'horse', 'hooves', 'galloping', 'puddle', 'shot', 'so', 'wide', 'would', 'fit', 'documentary', 'Savannah', 'shaky', 'camera', 'effect', 'employed', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'films', 'benefit', 'mood', 'tension', 'technique', 'can', 'instill', 'impression', 'Deliverance', 'gave', 'crew', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'lazy', 'set', 'up', 'tripod.Natassia', 'Malthe', 'cool', 'outfit', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'original', 'performance', 'how', 'sad', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pitiful', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'nitpicks', 'way', 'trying', 'prove', 'what', 'truly', 'dreadful', 'film', 'had', 'praise', 'one', 'aspect', 'would', 'be', 'Par', 'eacute', 'performance', 'acceptable', 'given', 'immersion', 'B-movie', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'bank', 'saving', 'movie', 'only', 'reasons', 'would', 'need', 'see', 'enjoyed', 'prequel', 'have', 'same', 'fascination', 'Boll', 'apparently', 'had', 'seeing', 'vampires', 'wild', 'west', 'mixed']",N/A
1085884,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B000SAGGS2,"MK ""Hussar""","[0, 6]","Imagine a movie set in snowy, picturesque Montana.  Then, let your mind's eye travel back some six-score years into the past.  Sprinkle you inner sight with a motley collection of hard-working farmers, tough frontier women, rugged lawmen, women of ill repute, and honest businessmen.  Your brain then creates an antagonist from antiquity's dustbin who threatens the way of life and very existence of the townsfolk.  Finally, a hero emerges who fashions a daring band of do-gooders that pledge to banish the new evil.By the way, the bad guys are all gun-toting cowboy vampires, and their leader is an ancient vampire hailing from the darkest, most forgotten realms of Eastern Europe--the terrible demon known as...Billy the Kid.Infamous director Uwe Boll (""Bloodrayne"") strikes again in ""Bloodrayne 2:  Deliverance,"" and not necessarily into uncharted territory, believe it or not.  The ""vampire-western"" has been done before, and probably done better.  Zack Ward (""Titus"") plays the vampiric Billy the Kid, descending upon the small town of Deliverance to spread woe and death.  Rayne (Natassia Malthe), the beautiful half-human, half-vampire heroine bedecked in full duster glory, rides into town to discover that her friends have been killed, and their children taken.  She soon finds that she is not alone--Pat Garret (Michael Pare), the perennial lawman/backstabber/mercenary (depending on your point of view) presents himself.  She rebuffs his offer of teaming up and rides into town alone, determined to destroy the rot which has infested the land.  Unfortunately, Billy and his accent have other plans for the would-be savior.Intentional or not, Uwe Boll's direction in this movie is noticeably different than in prior films.  Note that I did not say better, but I also don't know if I mean that the direction quality is worse.  Standard Boll strategies of droll sex scenes, bizarre plots with nary a connecting thread, wounds spewing gallons of fresh blood, and video game splice sequences are not in attendance here.  Instead, he introduces numerous extreme close-ups before scenes of questionable emotional impact, multitudes of teeth-gratingly useless slow-motion bits, and pages of musical notation played constantly at ""dramatic"" moments.  Could director Boll actually be trying to become a better film-maker?  We can only hope.I felt that this film was actually a bit superior to the first ""Bloodrayne.""  The opening horror sequence in the farmhouse was unnerving for the most part.  The scene during which ""The Preacher"" is recruited was a fine bit of over-the-top comedy, and actor Michael Eklund completely stole that part of the show.  Zack Ward managed to be creepy and even scary once or twice.  Gatling guns are always, and without exception, totally f****** cool.  The plot was much, much more solid and cohesive than prior Boll efforts, though it still bored to tears.The bad--or rather, the worse, as we are already starting a notch or two lower than average--as it were:  lame fighting, poor acting, overuse of slow-motion shots, and a closing quotation that will have you scratching your head in befuddlement.  It was a hair better than ""Bloodrayne""--take that for what it's worth.",2,"Deliverance us from any more ""Bloodrayne"" sequels",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3207,"['Imagine', 'movie', 'set', 'snowy', 'picturesque', 'Montana', 'Then', 'let', 'mind', 'eye', 'travel', 'back', 'six-score', 'years', 'past', 'Sprinkle', 'inner', 'sight', 'motley', 'collection', 'hard-working', 'farmers', 'tough', 'frontier', 'women', 'rugged', 'lawmen', 'women', 'ill', 'repute', 'honest', 'businessmen', 'brain', 'then', 'antagonist', 'antiquity', 'dustbin', 'who', 'way', 'life', 'very', 'existence', 'townsfolk', 'Finally', 'hero', 'who', 'daring', 'band', 'do-gooders', 'pledge', 'banish', 'new', 'evil.By', 'way', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'gun-toting', 'cowboy', 'vampires', 'leader', 'ancient', 'vampire', 'hailing', 'darkest', 'most', 'forgotten', 'realms', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'terrible', 'demon', 'known', 'Billy', 'Kid.Infamous', 'director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'Bloodrayne', 'strikes', 'again', 'Bloodrayne', '2', 'Deliverance', 'not', 'necessarily', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'believe', 'not', 'vampire-western', 'been', 'done', 'probably', 'done', 'better', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'Titus', 'vampiric', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'descending', 'small', 'town', 'Deliverance', 'spread', 'woe', 'death', 'Rayne', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'beautiful', 'half-human', 'half-vampire', 'heroine', 'bedecked', 'full', 'duster', 'glory', 'town', 'discover', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'children', 'taken', 'soon', 'not', 'alone', 'Pat', 'Garret', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'perennial', 'lawman/backstabber/mercenary', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'rebuffs', 'offer', 'teaming', 'up', 'rides', 'town', 'alone', 'determined', 'destroy', 'rot', 'infested', 'land', 'Unfortunately', 'Billy', 'accent', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'would-be', 'savior.Intentional', 'not', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'direction', 'movie', 'noticeably', 'different', 'prior', 'films', 'Note', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'better', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'mean', 'direction', 'quality', 'worse', 'Standard', 'Boll', 'strategies', 'droll', 'sex', 'scenes', 'bizarre', 'plots', 'connecting', 'thread', 'spewing', 'gallons', 'fresh', 'blood', 'video', 'game', 'splice', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'attendance', 'here', 'Instead', 'numerous', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'scenes', 'questionable', 'emotional', 'impact', 'multitudes', 'teeth-gratingly', 'useless', 'slow-motion', 'bits', 'pages', 'musical', 'notation', 'played', 'constantly', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Could', 'director', 'Boll', 'actually', 'be', 'trying', 'become', 'better', 'film-maker', 'can', 'only', 'hope.I', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'superior', 'first', 'Bloodrayne', 'opening', 'horror', 'sequence', 'farmhouse', 'was', 'unnerving', 'most', 'part', 'scene', 'Preacher', 'recruited', 'was', 'fine', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'completely', 'stole', 'part', 'show', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'managed', 'be', 'creepy', 'even', 'scary', 'once', 'twice', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'are', 'always', 'exception', 'totally', 'f******', 'cool', 'plot', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'solid', 'cohesive', 'prior', 'Boll', 'efforts', 'still', 'bored', 'tears.The', 'bad', 'rather', 'worse', 'are', 'already', 'starting', 'notch', 'two', 'lower', 'average', 'were', 'lame', 'fighting', 'poor', 'acting', 'overuse', 'slow-motion', 'shots', 'closing', 'quotation', 'will', 'have', 'scratching', 'head', 'befuddlement', 'was', 'hair', 'better', 'Bloodrayne', 'take', 'what', 'worth']",N/A
