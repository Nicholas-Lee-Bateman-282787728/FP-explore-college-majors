I was expecting a documentary about a thru-hike southbound on the Appalachian Trail, but was pleasantly surprised to find out this actually had a story.Southbounders tells the tale of a fed-up 20 something who decides to attempt to find something she was missing in her life by hiking southbound from Maine to Georgia on the Appalachian Trail. The film is chock full of gorgeous vistas and shots of beautiful nature. I can really appreciate that they filmed this movie actually on the trail which was great. The soundtrack is one of the films most appealing features. This movie has a lot of heart, you can tell the filmmakers really have a love for hiking and the AT itself.Olivia, the lead of the movie played by Amy Cale Patterson, begins the journey as a ""newbie"" but learns the tricks of the trade by reading the log books scattered throughout the trail and hiking with a goofball ""comic relief"" character named ""Slackpack"". She finds that she is having a strong connection with Rollin, one of the hikers leaving notes in the log book. A crush begins, she sets off to find Rollin and the rest of the film is her hiking with this mysterious man through the rest of the Appalachian Trail. We see the relationship build and ultimately fall as is the life on the mountainous trail.The story was surprisingly good as was the acting. I would have liked to have seen more of the trail and their journey. The movie seemed to have skipped an entire season (Winter), which would have been interesting to see. I suppose the filmmakers couldn't film in those conditions.All in all it was a surprisingly well made film. I enjoyed it and made me want to go hike the AT, so I suppose they accomplished what they set out to do.[...]",3,Unexpected Pleasant Surprise,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,1858,"['first', 'glance', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'documentary', 'Especially', 'viewing', 'opening', 'sequence', 'least', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'expecting', 'documentary', 'thru-hike', 'southbound', 'Appalachian', 'Trail', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'actually', 'had', 'story.Southbounders', 'tale', 'fed-up', '20', 'something', 'who', 'attempt', 'find', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'life', 'hiking', 'southbound', 'Maine', 'Georgia', 'Appalachian', 'Trail', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'gorgeous', 'vistas', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'filmed', 'movie', 'actually', 'trail', 'was', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'appealing', 'features', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'can', 'tell', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'have', 'love', 'hiking', 'AT', 'itself.Olivia', 'lead', 'movie', 'played', 'Amy', 'Cale', 'Patterson', 'journey', 'newbie', 'tricks', 'trade', 'reading', 'log', 'books', 'scattered', 'trail', 'hiking', 'goofball', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'named', 'Slackpack', 'having', 'strong', 'connection', 'Rollin', 'one', 'hikers', 'leaving', 'notes', 'log', 'book', 'crush', 'find', 'Rollin', 'rest', 'film', 'hiking', 'mysterious', 'man', 'rest', 'Appalachian', 'Trail', 'see', 'relationship', 'build', 'ultimately', 'fall', 'life', 'mountainous', 'trail.The', 'story', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'was', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'trail', 'journey', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'skipped', 'entire', 'season', 'Winter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'suppose', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'film', 'conditions.All', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'hike', 'AT', 'suppose', 'accomplished', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do.', '[', ']']",N/A

I especially appreciated the fact that the main character is a woman and illustrates how she was more than capable of accomplishing a through hike. One of the neatest themes was how annoying hikers turned out to be best companions by the end of the hike.  It's not a documentary, but I think it does an entertaining job of capturing some of the struggles and emotions one might experience while hiking the AT.Drug use:  One of the hikers smokes marijuana on several occasions during the hike.Warning:  The show contains nudity.  There is one instance where three hikers moon the Mt. Washington incline train, another instance where two hikers hike nude together (a few seconds worth of video), and a third instance where there is full frontal and rear nudity of a man hiking the trail naked.",3,Nudity Warning,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,891,"['movie', 'dramatized', 'appreciated', 'way', 'wove', 'storyline', 'real', 'life', 'AT', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'woman', 'how', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'accomplishing', 'hike', 'One', 'neatest', 'themes', 'was', 'how', 'annoying', 'hikers', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'companions', 'end', 'hike', 'not', 'documentary', 'think', 'entertaining', 'job', 'capturing', 'struggles', 'emotions', 'one', 'might', 'experience', 'hiking', 'AT.Drug', 'use', 'One', 'hikers', 'smokes', 'marijuana', 'several', 'occasions', 'hike.Warning', 'show', 'nudity', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'three', 'hikers', 'moon', 'Mt', 'Washington', 'incline', 'train', 'instance', 'where', 'two', 'hikers', 'hike', 'nude', 'together', 'few', 'seconds', 'video', 'third', 'instance', 'where', 'full', 'frontal', 'rear', 'nudity', 'man', 'hiking', 'trail', 'naked']",N/A
952066,A12JARSR16QM21,B000BWM5T6,Steve,"[0, 0]","I'm a huge fan of hiking and camping, my wife and I do our best to get out on at least one decent backpacking trip per year. They just don't make many movies about long-distance hiking, so I was pretty psyched to check this one out - and it delivered. Watching this movie I felt a major itch to get back out hiking ASAP, so that's always a good sign.Southbounders is a quirky love story centered around a young woman, Olivia, confronting physical and emotional challenges while hoofing it along a 2,000 mile trail from Maine to Georgia. Through reading entries in shelter logs, Olivia starts to develop a crush on a hiker named Rollin and does her best to catch up with him. As the two meet up and hike together, we experience the development of their relationship framed by life on the trail. This is the central storyline of Southbounders, and the payoff is well worth it.The only significant negative I can really mention about Southbounders is the video quality. I've watched tons of streaming movies, and bought other movies from Video On Demand... and I think Southbounders has the worst video quality of anything that I've watched. Still a great movie, and definitely watchable - but I would have loved a sharper picture.",4,A Solid Film on Uncommon Subject Matter,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,1228,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'hiking', 'camping', 'wife', 'do', 'best', 'get', 'out', 'least', 'one', 'decent', 'backpacking', 'trip', 'year', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'movies', 'long-distance', 'hiking', 'was', 'pretty', 'psyched', 'check', 'one', 'delivered', 'Watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'major', 'itch', 'get', 'back', 'out', 'hiking', 'ASAP', 'always', 'good', 'sign.Southbounders', 'quirky', 'love', 'story', 'centered', 'young', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'confronting', 'physical', 'emotional', 'challenges', 'hoofing', '2,000', 'mile', 'trail', 'Maine', 'Georgia', 'reading', 'entries', 'shelter', 'logs', 'Olivia', 'develop', 'crush', 'hiker', 'named', 'Rollin', 'best', 'catch', 'up', 'two', 'meet', 'up', 'hike', 'together', 'experience', 'development', 'relationship', 'framed', 'life', 'trail', 'central', 'storyline', 'Southbounders', 'payoff', 'well', 'worth', 'it.The', 'only', 'significant', 'negative', 'can', 'really', 'mention', 'Southbounders', 'video', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'tons', 'streaming', 'movies', 'bought', 'other', 'movies', 'Video', 'Demand', 'think', 'Southbounders', 'worst', 'video', 'quality', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Still', 'great', 'movie', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'sharper', 'picture']",N/A
