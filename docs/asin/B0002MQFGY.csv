I did not spend enough time reading the description and thought it was from the ""real"" dog whisperer Cesar Milan. In actuality, it is someone else. Judging from the results of my sister-in-laws dog, the training methods in this video are problematic. Her dog will behave, but only when it expects to receive payment. I've owned a couple dogs in my time, and trained them all to be well behaved using few if any treats. Positive reinforcement works wonders, but treats IMHO should be kept to a minimum. Negative reinforcement is at times necessary as well. I know its not very PC to say that, but it is true. I learned this wile working for a retired veteran who kenneled any number of dogs in the summer for extra income. He hired me to feed and care for these dogs, and during that summer I learned a whole lot 'on the job.' One of the things I learned is you cannot give a dog enough praise or encouragement or treats to break it of the habit of jumping up on people (which would never have happened in the first place with good training, but these were NOT my dogs). You have to use negative reinforcement, which in this case involved knocking the dogs unto their back. Again, I know that isn't very PC, but you can take it from me, it does work, and it works quickly. While I prefer positive reinforcement, as with children, there sometimes need to be consequences.I suggest you spend a bit more and make sure you get an actual Cesar Milan DVD set.
