752009,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B0000950WB,Andrew Kear,"[2, 2]","If you enjoyed Office Space there is a good chance that you will find Bartleby amusing. The film perfectly captures the futility of most office work.  Bartleby is hired because the office manager sees the need for more help. The morose looking Bartleby (played by Crispin Glover) is a model employee who at first causes resentment from the other office workers due to his diligence. He even makes the flirtatious secretary concerned enough to be overly attentive to the boss.However, things take a drastic turn when Bartleby suddenly refuses to do simple tasks in the office. When asked to do something Bartleby simply says, ""I prefer not to"".  Soon Bartleby refuses to do any work at all and repeats the same phrase, ""I prefer not to"" anytime he is asked to work. Soon the only thing that appeals to Bartleby is staring at the ceiling fan.Some have said that Bartleby is simply rebelling against the corporate establishment and is refusing to be a cog in the wheel. I don't really agree with this conclusion, because there are far more effective ways to rebel against the establishment. Bartleby's obstinacy is more of a personality trait. Maybe Herman Melville, who wrote the story in the 19th century, was actually describing an autistic person before there was a definition of one.  In some ways Bartley is like a computer slowly shutting down, much in the way Hal was lobotomized in 2001. Soon the most basic functions elude Bartleby.The boss, played sympathetically by David Paymer eventually follows Bartleby to a homeless refuge under a bridge. He tries to bring him food only to find Bartleby has starved to death. I think Melville is leaving it up to the audience to figure out what caused Bartleby's eventually demise.You could look at the movie and novel as a tragedy, but many will see it as a satire on modern corporate life.",4,Interesting Story,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,1839,"['enjoyed', 'Office', 'Space', 'good', 'chance', 'will', 'find', 'Bartleby', 'amusing', 'film', 'perfectly', 'futility', 'most', 'office', 'work', 'Bartleby', 'hired', 'office', 'manager', 'need', 'more', 'help', 'morose', 'looking', 'Bartleby', 'played', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'model', 'employee', 'who', 'first', 'causes', 'resentment', 'other', 'office', 'workers', 'due', 'diligence', 'even', 'flirtatious', 'secretary', 'concerned', 'enough', 'be', 'overly', 'attentive', 'boss.However', 'things', 'take', 'drastic', 'turn', 'when', 'Bartleby', 'suddenly', 'do', 'simple', 'tasks', 'office', 'When', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'Bartleby', 'simply', 'prefer', 'not', 'Soon', 'Bartleby', 'do', 'work', 'same', 'phrase', 'prefer', 'not', 'anytime', 'asked', 'work', 'Soon', 'only', 'thing', 'appeals', 'Bartleby', 'staring', 'ceiling', 'fan.Some', 'have', 'said', 'Bartleby', 'simply', 'rebelling', 'corporate', 'establishment', 'refusing', 'be', 'cog', 'wheel', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'agree', 'conclusion', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'ways', 'rebel', 'establishment', 'Bartleby', 'obstinacy', 'more', 'personality', 'trait', 'Maybe', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'who', 'wrote', 'story', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'actually', 'describing', 'autistic', 'person', 'was', 'definition', 'one', 'ways', 'Bartley', 'computer', 'slowly', 'shutting', 'down', 'much', 'way', 'Hal', 'was', 'lobotomized', '2001', 'Soon', 'most', 'basic', 'functions', 'elude', 'Bartleby.The', 'boss', 'played', 'sympathetically', 'David', 'Paymer', 'eventually', 'Bartleby', 'homeless', 'refuge', 'bridge', 'bring', 'food', 'only', 'find', 'Bartleby', 'starved', 'death', 'think', 'Melville', 'leaving', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'caused', 'Bartleby', 'eventually', 'demise.You', 'could', 'look', 'movie', 'novel', 'tragedy', 'many', 'will', 'see', 'satire', 'modern', 'corporate', 'life']",Bartleby

752012,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0000950WB,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 8]","Based on one of Herman Melville's less popular works `Bartleby the Scrivener' (heck, Moby Dick was somewhat ill received at the time it came out, probably due to allegorical nature), Bartleby (2001) is a wonderfully honest and true to its' source film providing a fairly seamless update of a story written over 150 years ago.Co-written and directed by Jonathan Parker (his first film), Bartleby stars the ever enigmatic (and kinda creepy) Crispin Glover (River's Edge) along with David Paymer (Payback), Glenne Headly (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), Maury Chaykin (A Nero Wolf Mystery), Seymour Cassel (Tin Men), and Joe Piscopo...also appearing are Carrie Snodgrass (The Attic) and Dick Martin (Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In).The film takes place in the present day, set in a modest public records office.  The boss (Paymer) has received news of more work coming their way, due to a lucrative government contract or such, and decides, in his prudent pragmatism, to hire on an extra person to help deal with the increased workload.  In a completely hilarious bit of un-realism, he composes a want ad, one would expect to see for a position involving risks, adventure, and great rewards, not one befitting the unassuming and ultimately duller than dull tasks involved with working in a public records office i.e. filing, fact checking, ect. (in the original story, they were scriveners, or, basically, human copy machines).  What makes it so hilarious is not only the wording of the ad, but the notion that Paymer's character thinks it's suitable...Vivian (Headly) opts not to post the ad, instead re-writing it to encompass, in her eyes, a very honest interpretation of said position, i.e. low pay, boring work, etc.  Despite (or, because of) the ad's bluntness, one applicant does appear, in a thin, pasty, soft-spoken man named Bartleby (Glover).  Upon seeing no one else is going to apply, Paymer's character hires Bartleby, and things seem to work out well, as Bartleby works very quickly and efficiently, but that soon changes as this once superior worker has now becomes non-working worker, picking and choosing what tasks he wishes to perform (fewer and fewer each day), with the standard reply of ""I'd prefer not to"" to those menial tasks he wishes to no longer perform.  This sets off a quiet struggle between Paymer's character and...the wall?  It might was well be, as Bartleby is as about forthcoming, offering no explanations of any kind for his non-working (oh, he still shows up everyday, he just doesn't do any work).  You'd think this would be cause to terminate the employment of said individual, and Paymer's character tries, but just isn't successful, almost as if he can't, like he's somehow bound to Bartleby in unseen fashion (perhaps a magic tether, one made up of a combination of feelings ranging from guilt to envy).The best part of this contemporary retelling of Melville's classic tale is Paymer, a conformist struggling to understand and come to terms with this non-conformist entity that he has inadvertently allowed into his environment, which has now taken hold like a mold settling into a home.  His frustration grows rapidly, as Bartleby continually confounds his employer with his unrelenting, pacifistic stance of not working, refusing to perform even the simplest of tasks, and offering no reasoning or cause for his behavior.  Glover does very well as Bartleby, and given that he has so few lines, his character must come through in non-verbal means, and does, in a truly cryptic and puzzling manner.  The impression I got was that this character was posing a non-confrontational rebellion against the tedium inherent within the bureaucracy that forces people into the unnatural state of accepting automatons, extracting and crushing the very soul of these individuals by means of menial and tedious tasks for the sake of keeping the machine alive.  Another actor I though did well was Glenne Headly as Vivian, the office manager, and only woman, tempting her male counterparts with homemade candies and a flirtatious nature.  It struck me more that her character acted the way she did to validate her feministic qualities, to her co-workers, and herself, as the day to day humdrum works to obfuscate such qualities, as they only serve to disrupt and distract from the nature of the work.  Chaykin was good, as the sort of office nut and hypochondriac, unwilling to participate in niceties often associated with people who maintain a day-to-day business relationship, and little else.  Piscopo did better than I thought, as the smarmy, sleazy office Lothario (his amorous activities remain mostly outside of business hours), but I couldn't help wonder if he was just playing the role as directed, or if he understood his position within the context the story, and the story itself.  The bits of humor interspersed throughout the film, those not inherent to the original story, helped to make this easier to take for those not familiar with Melville's absurd tale, but I think those who are familiar with the source material will not be disappointed.  Some things have changed (which character was Vivian supposed to represent?  Nipper?  Ginger Nut?), mostly superficial, but the core elements are here, and come through very well.  I thought the direction was done well and helped present the story as well as anyone could to the silver screen.  The sets were minimal (love that 2nd office), providing a suitable backdrop.  Basing the entire score around Theremin music was an interesting choice, and one that seemed entirely appropriate, but it still got on my nerves after awhile.The non-anamorphic wide screen print provided on this DVD looked pretty good, from what I could tell.  I've heard others have had problems with after images trailing the actors, but I saw none.  The sound is quite good, and there are two options; Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.  As far as special features, there are more than I would have thought including a trailer, filmographies, interviews, a featurette titles About the Theremin, and a mini-director commentary.Cookieman108",4,"""I would prefer not to""",1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,6108,"['Based', 'one', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'less', 'popular', 'works', 'Scrivener', 'heck', 'Moby', 'Dick',

It been suggested that Bartleby is suffering from soul sickness. That he is dead inside from all the years spent at the dead letter office.  He is just existing on existence's most minimalist level.

David Paymer is his clueless boss who tries to understand what he is dealing with. Glenne Headly is Vivian, an office secretary, the woman of many adorable talents; Maury Chaykin, and Joe Piscopo are his coworkers in the one of the most boring office ever existed.

I'd prefer not to...I believe Parker made a very impressive debut - the film is creatively shot, the use of music is amazing - Beethoven's sonata turns into a creepy, quirky and moody Bartleby's theme for which Parker used theremin - very interesting and unique musical instrument. Parker and his co -writer transported 'Bartleby the Scrivener' into a surreal and absurd black comedy - satire on bureaucracy and contemporary alienation in the insane and cruel world.Franz Kafka's name came to my mind more than once while watching the film - he would've loved that absurd, funny but dark and sad story.

Isolated and insular, this building houses a public records firm run by an unnamed boss (David Paymer). The film is staffed by Vivian (Glenn Headley), a sexy, flirtatious secretary, Rocky (Joe Piscopo), self-styled ladies man, and Ernie (Maury Chaykin), a sad sack sort of fellow.When the boss gets a city contract, he seeks to hire another employee. Enter Bartleby (Crispin Glover), a cadaverously pale, funereally dressed  man. As there are no other applicants, the slightly creepy Bartleby gets the job. An odd duck, he initially works as if he were a house on fire. As time goes on, his boss discovers that Bartleby prefers not to do any work. This sets off a reaction from all those who work with Bartleby, whose life spirals ever downward with his decision to withdraw from the world.Crispin Glover, David Paymer, and Glenn Headly are brilliant in their respective roles. The more peripheral office characters, unfortunately, have little to work with, though they do their best with the material with which they have to work. Their roles, however, are one dimensional and add little to the film in terms of depth.This off-beat, quirky film also resonates with dissonance through the use of bright, odd color combinations for its sets. It serves to keep the film a tad off balance, which works effectively given its premise. In the end, however, the film fails to sustain itself fully, as it starts a spiral downward towards the end, unable to sustain the weight of its own ballast.",3,QUIRKY AND OFFBEAT...,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,1913,"['Based', 'story', 'Bartleby', 'Scrivener', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'film', 'adaptation', 'author', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'tale', 'existential', 'alienation', 'effectively', 'transposed', 'twenty', 'first', 'century', 'screenwriters', 'Catherine', 'Napoli', 'Jonathan', 'Parker.Featuring', 'stellar', 'cast', 'deft', 'direction', 'film', 'place', 'office', 'building', 'perched', 'high', 'up', 'hill', 'inaccessible', 'pedestrians', 'Isolated', 'insular', 'building', 'houses', 'public', 'records', 'firm', 'run', 'unnamed', 'boss', 'David', 'Paymer', 'film', 'staffed', 'Vivian', 'Glenn', 'Headley', 'sexy', 'flirtatious', 'secretary', 'Rocky', 'Joe', 'Piscopo', 'self-styled', 'ladies', 'man', 'Ernie', 'Maury', 'Chaykin', 'sad', 'sack', 'sort', 'fellow.When', 'boss', 'city', 'contract', 'hire', 'employee', 'Enter', 'Bartleby', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'cadaverously', 'pale', 'funereally', 'dressed', 'man', 'are', 'other', 'applicants', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'Bartleby', 'job', 'odd', 'duck', 'initially', 'were', 'house', 'fire', 'time', 'boss', 'discovers', 'Bartleby', 'not', 'do', 'work', 'off', 'reaction', 'who', 'work', 'Bartleby', 'life', 'spirals', 'ever', 'downward', 'decision', 'withdraw', 'world.Crispin', 'Glover', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Glenn', 'Headly', 'are', 'brilliant', 'respective', 'roles', 'more', 'peripheral', 'office', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'little', 'work', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'have', 'work', 'roles', 'however', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'add', 'little', 'film', 'terms', 'depth.This', 'off-beat', 'quirky', 'film', 'also', 'dissonance', 'use', 'bright', 'odd', 'color', 'combinations', 'sets', 'keep', 'film', 'tad', 'balance', 'effectively', 'given', 'premise', 'end', 'however', 'film', 'sustain', 'fully', 'spiral', 'downward', 'end', 'unable', 'sustain', 'weight', 'own', 'ballast']",Bartleby

And then when he's fired and asked to leave as well. It seems that really Bartleby would prefer not to do anything.Crispin Glover portrays the enigmatic Bartleby with the creepy calmness that is his specialty. This film is really what an independent film should be. It's clear that the budget is low, the sets are simple, the cast small, but the performances and script make this film superb.Having not read the Herman Melville book this is based on, Bartleby the Scrivener, I can't compare this adaptation to the original story, or comment on how it does or doesn't stick to the original themes. What I can say is that this is a very interesting movie with many standout performances. If you like quirky offbeat independent films, this is definitely a movie for you.The DVD has interviews with all the cast members in character, which is pretty cool, but the interview with Crispin Glover discussing the concepts of the film is definitely the best.
