T.V. shows like this we collect for our family DVD collection. Our children LOVE this show so we had to add this to our DVD collection.What we did not know is that there were only five seasons made and only two seasons have been released. So this complete's our DVD collection for this T.V. sitcom series.With today's trash T.V. we just grew tired of paying for crap! We wanted to view T.V. the way we wanted and the shows we wanted to see that we thought had value and worth to them, this is one of those shows.Today's T.V. is so bad to us that we cut paid for T.V. off and purchased Roku and Logi Tech Revue and view T.V. though Netflix. We did not find this show on Netflix show we purchased both seasons.Many people are looking for real T.V. shows and this is one of them. This show is filled with great comedy, lessons, and morals. We are glad to have finally made this purchase as we have our wish list of sitcoms that we want. Since we don't have cable any more we take a portion from our savings and buy the shows we want from time to time. Over time we will have all the shows we want.If you are looking for clean family entertainment for the whole family, this is one sitcom that will keep you going for hours! Give this sitcom a try and support sitcoms such as this so that more can be made and we can get T.V back to the way it should be.Well once we receive our copies we will update their condition and the packaging. For now just know that this is one funny show and keeps our family laughing. This is good for family down time and you don't have to worry about children viewing things they should not.Get your laugh on !",5,Our family Loves family fun filled show..,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,1751,"['are', 'large', 'family', 'consist', 'Husband', 'Wife', 'More', 'show', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'T.V', 'collect', 'family', 'DVD', 'collection', 'children', 'LOVE', 'show', 'had', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection.What', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'were', 'only', 'five', 'seasons', 'made', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'complete', 'DVD', 'collection', 'T.V', 'sitcom', 'series.With', 'today', 'trash', 'T.V', 'just', 'grew', 'tired', 'paying', 'crap', 'wanted', 'view', 'T.V', 'way', 'wanted', 'shows', 'wanted', 'see', 'thought', 'had', 'value', 'worth', 'one', 'shows.Today', 'T.V', 'so', 'bad', 'cut', 'paid', 'T.V', 'off', 'purchased', 'Roku', 'Logi', 'Tech', 'Revue', 'view', 'T.V', 'Netflix', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'show', 'Netflix', 'show', 'purchased', 'seasons.Many', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'real', 'T.V', 'shows', 'one', 'show', 'filled', 'great', 'comedy', 'lessons', 'morals', 'are', 'glad', 'have', 'finally', 'made', 'purchase', 'have', 'wish', 'list', 'sitcoms', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'more', 'take', 'portion', 'savings', 'buy', 'shows', 'want', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'shows', 'want.If', 'are', 'looking', 'clean', 'family', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family', 'one', 'sitcom', 'will', 'keep', 'going', 'hours', 'Give', 'sitcom', 'try', 'support', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'can', 'get', 'T.V', 'back', 'way', 'should', 'be.Well', 'once', 'receive', 'copies', 'will', 'update', 'condition', 'packaging', 'now', 'just', 'know', 'one', 'funny', 'show', 'family', 'laughing', 'good', 'family', 'down', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'children', 'viewing', 'things', 'should', 'not.Get', 'laugh']",N/A

Yes, I will publicly admit Blankman is one of my all time favorite movies.  (""Think about electronics!  Think about electronics!"")I loved the first season of this show.  Damon Wayans plays the a good father to three kids. Tisha Campbell plays the great Mom.  (I always liked her since I first saw her in House Party)The bad part of the second season begins when Damon Wayans character goes to the gas station.  While there, because of his own impatience and stupidity, he has a confrontation with another guy played by Larry Miller.  Larry Miller is always funny.  (In my opinion, Larry Miller contributed the only humor to the otherwise bad movie known as Pretty Woman)The episode goes downhill from there.  Not only that, but it becomes a two-parter.  Yuck!  Damon Wayans character is usually a good role model and dispenses the wisdom of a sage.  Not in these two episodes and a bowling episode later.  His character just continually says and does dumb stuff over and over.  And he never shut-up.  He seemed to be an infinite source of dumb statements.  I became used to laughing a lot while watching this series.  That laughter came to a halt while watching these particular episodes.  I had even hoped the shows would get better towards the end of each episode.  No luck.  No laughter.  It was painful to watch.  When I watch these DVD's again, I will skip over these episodes.Overall, a good set to have, but skip the really dumb & inane episodes.There's my opinion.  Hope it was helpful.  :).",3,Not as Good as the First Season,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1588,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'nothing', 'respect', 'admiration', 'Damon', 'Keenan', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'Yes', 'will', 'publicly', 'admit', 'Blankman', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Think', 'electronics', 'Think', 'electronics', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'good', 'father', 'three', 'kids', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'great', 'Mom', 'always', 'liked', 'first', 'saw', 'House', 'Party', 'bad', 'part', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'character', 'gas', 'station', 'there', 'own', 'impatience', 'stupidity', 'confrontation', 'guy', 'played', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'always', 'funny', 'opinion', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'contributed', 'only', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'bad', 'movie', 'known', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'episode', 'downhill', 'there', 'Not', 'only', 'two-parter', 'Yuck', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'character', 'usually', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'wisdom', 'sage', 'Not', 'two', 'episodes', 'bowling', 'episode', 'later', 'character', 'just', 'continually', 'dumb', 'stuff', 'never', 'shut-up', 'seemed', 'be', 'infinite', 'source', 'dumb', 'statements', 'became', 'used', 'laughing', 'lot', 'watching', 'series', 'laughter', 'came', 'halt', 'watching', 'particular', 'episodes', 'had', 'even', 'hoped', 'shows', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'towards', 'end', 'episode', 'luck', 'laughter', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'When', 'watch', 'DVD', 'again', 'will', 'skip', 'episodes.Overall', 'good', 'set', 'have', 'skip', 'really', 'dumb', 'inane', 'episodes.There', 'opinion', 'Hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

Many times, morals are included at the end of a few episodes, but they are taught in a way that does not make it seem as though they are being forced down our throats. The plots of the episodes are amusing and fun to watch, and the characters are so unlike any families in reality that they make their audience laugh very easily. True, there are some episodes that are not as fun as others, but ""My Wife and Kids"" is still a great comedy that you should buy on DVD as soon as possible.
