It's partly a family film and partly a romantic comedy, but the results are always engaging.Dan Burns (Steve Carell) is a newspaper columnist who gives people family advice.  He's a widower of four years but is rearing his three daughters.  At home he's strict to the point of obsession, so he won't let his fifteen year old date a boyfriend for fear of infatuation.Pending is his family's yearly visit to his parents' rustic New England getaway while he awaits a verdict on whether or not his column will be put in syndication.  Going to a local bookstore he discovers a beautiful woman, Marie (Juliette Binoche) with whom he'd like to connect.  Later, Marie turns out to be his brother (Dane Cook) Mitch's girlfriend.  Trying to juggle his desire to rekindle happiness and be the man he professes to be in his column is difficult at best.Just like other Steve Carrell movies, his character is awkwardly caught in sticky situations.  Unlike the other movies, however, Carrell's performance is more graceful and multifaceted.  Dane Cook, who allegedly has a bad reputation as an actor, seems natural and nuanced as his brother Mitch.  (Actually, the only other performance I've seen him in is his role as the sleazy voyeur in 'Mr. Brooks,' and there he was quite convincing.)  Everyone else keeps a genuine vitality that this comedy needs.Most of the movie spends time like a home video movie.  They play football, sing songs, put on a talent show, play word games, and talk about life.  It's a testament to the film that in the process, the brisk editing makes the whole getaway fun with people we really care about.  'Dan in Real Life' may not deliver the biggest laughs, but it is a warm, heartfelt comedy that gives us all a chance to get away from it all.",3,"""Learning to Live Again""",1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,1821,"['Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'solid', 'premise', 'falters', 'partly', 'family', 'film', 'partly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'results', 'are', 'always', 'engaging.Dan', 'Burns', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'who', 'people', 'family', 'advice', 'widower', 'four', 'years', 'rearing', 'three', 'daughters', 'home', 'strict', 'point', 'obsession', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'date', 'boyfriend', 'fear', 'infatuation.Pending', 'family', 'yearly', 'visit', 'parents', 'rustic', 'New', 'England', 'getaway', 'verdict', 'not', 'column', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'syndication', 'Going', 'local', 'bookstore', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Marie', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'whom', ""'d"", 'like', 'connect', 'Later', 'Marie', 'out', 'be', 'brother', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Mitch', 'girlfriend', 'Trying', 'juggle', 'desire', 'rekindle', 'happiness', 'be', 'man', 'be', 'column', 'difficult', 'best.Just', 'other', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'movies', 'character', 'awkwardly', 'caught', 'sticky', 'situations', 'other', 'movies', 'however', 'Carrell', 'performance', 'more', 'graceful', 'multifaceted', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'who', 'allegedly', 'bad', 'reputation', 'actor', 'natural', 'nuanced', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Actually', 'only', 'other', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'role', 'sleazy', 'voyeur', ""'Mr"", 'Brooks', 'was', 'quite', 'convincing', 'Everyone', 'else', 'genuine', 'vitality', 'comedy', 'needs.Most', 'movie', 'time', 'home', 'video', 'movie', 'play', 'football', 'sing', 'songs', 'put', 'talent', 'show', 'play', 'word', 'games', 'talk', 'life', 'testament', 'film', 'process', 'brisk', 'editing', 'whole', 'getaway', 'fun', 'people', 'really', 'care', ""'Dan"", 'Real', 'Life', 'may', 'not', 'deliver', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'warm', 'heartfelt', 'comedy', 'chance', 'get', 'away']",N/A

The moral is: if you are nuts with obsessive lust for someone and call it love, your family will get totally behind you, even if you ""steal"" the woman from your brother. Besides, your brother will go after the hot gal who likes you the day after you kiss his girlfriend and will somehow forge a lasting relationship and attend your wedding to his ex a few months later.I really wanted to like this film and I appreciate Dane Cook playing someone who is actually kind of nice. I'm embarrassed for Emily Blunt, with what started as a great character and becomes reduced to another script convenience.Also, it felt like the director did almost everything they could to squelch comedy. Was there a ""no comedy allowed"" clause? The comedy that made it in was for the most part, mean. Sure, my family makes me sleep in the laundry room and starts the dryer every night as I go to bed with nothing but a steel-toed boot in it.  ""This corn is like an angel"" was the one funny part. Forget the shower scene.In summary, this is serious movie for those who think all problems must work out conveniently and in their favor, and with no repercussions.

1130622,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00118T632,Andrew Ellington,"[21, 21]","I blame it solely on that horribly cheesy poster art portraying Steve Carell's head laying on a stack of flapjacks, but I wrote off `Dan in Real Life' well before actually seeing it despite the good reviews and word of mouth from friends.  It was supposed to be really good, but in my head all I saw was cheesy ridiculousness pretending to be sincere.  I'm really glad that I finally gave in and watched this film this past weekend.What a treasure.I know this may seem like an odd comparison, and I will say off the bat that the film I'm about to compare it to does have some heavier themes, but this reminded me a lot of last years independent surprise `Rachel Getting Married'.  In fact, I actually think that overall, `Dan in Real Life' is the better of the two films, or at least the most complete and comfortable of the two (when have I ever shunned away from discomfort in a cinematic offering?).  I had a few issues with `Rachel's construction, but here I was completely soaking up every frame.  It was funny, touching, charming, emotionally resonate and beautifully structured.In quoting the film itself, and my review's title; ""Plan to be surprised"".Steve plays Dan, an advice columnist who has lost his wife to an illness and is rearing his three young daughters with difficulty.  His eldest daughter just wants to be given some freedoms, his middle daughter just wants to be allowed to express her newfound love and his youngest daughter just wants a little attention.  Dan, depressed yet never to the dramatically overstated and clich&eacute;d effect that many actors would have played it, is just not capable of giving them what they need.  When they make a trip to visit family, Dan meets the beautiful Marie and sparks fly, but she is involved and so they part only to uncover that they will be spending a lot of time together as Marie is dating Dan's younger brother Mitch.  Trying to hide their growing affection for one another, Dan and Marie try and play cool, but it soon becomes more than either of them can handle.The film is so much more than a glorified rom-com, as it seemed to have been marketed as.  I really wish that this would have gotten the push it deserved, and that it had been campaigned as what it really is; a heartfelt and honest portrait of middle-aged growth and development.  There is a sincerity about the way Dan comes to terms with his own person, trying to understand who he is as a man, as a father, as a widower.  Carell is outstanding here (something I never imagined that I would say).  Juliette Binoche is marvelous, as usual, giving her delicate performance a layer of spunk and wit that makes her delicious in every sense of the word.  I even enjoyed Dane Cook's performance, and I find him repulsive.  He was genuine and charming and natural.I just love the piano-side sing-along (piggyface), for it was scenes like that that gave the film this lovely sense of naturalness.Between the stellar cast and the wonderfully constructed scripting (nothing is ever too clich&eacute;d and even the romance is developed with smarts as apposed to the usual laziness) that contains some comical yet appropriate dialog (""MURDERER OF LOVE!""), `Dan in Real Life' is the real deal.  I am just in such a state of pleasant and very welcomed shock right now.Now, let's talk about fixing that ridiculous cover-art.",5,Plan to be surprised...,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,3347,"['blame', 'solely', 'horribly', 'cheesy', 'poster', 'art', 'portraying', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'head', 'laying', 'stack', 'flapjacks', 'wrote', 'off', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'well', 'actually', 'seeing', 'good', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'friends', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'head', 'saw', 'was', 'cheesy', 'ridiculousness', 'pretending', 'be', 'sincere', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'finally', 'gave', 'watched', 'film', 'past', 'weekend.What', 'treasure.I', 'know', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'comparison', 'will', 'say', 'off', 'bat', 'film', ""'m"", 'compare', 'have', 'heavier', 'themes', 'reminded', 'lot', 'last', 'years', 'independent', 'surprise', 'Rachel', 'Getting', 'Married', 'fact', 'actually', 'think', 'overall', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'better', 'two', 'films', 'least', 'most', 'complete', 'comfortable', 'two', 'when', 'have', 'ever', 'shunned', 'away', 'discomfort', 'cinematic', 'offering', 'had', 'few', 'issues', 'Rachel', 'construction', 'here', 'was', 'completely', 'soaking', 'up', 'frame', 'was', 'funny', 'touching', 'charming', 'emotionally', 'resonate', 'beautifully', 'structured.In', 'quoting', 'film', 'review', 'title', 'Plan', 'be', 'surprised', '.Steve', 'Dan', 'advice', 'columnist', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'illness', 'rearing', 'three', 'young', 'daughters', 'difficulty', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'just', 'be', 'given', 'freedoms', 'middle', 'daughter', 'just', 'be', 'allowed', 'express', 'newfound', 'love', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'just', 'little', 'attention', 'Dan', 'depressed', 'yet', 'never', 'dramatically', 'overstated', 'clich', 'eacute', 'effect', 'many', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'just', 'not', 'capable', 'giving', 'what', 'need', 'When', 'make', 'trip', 'visit', 'family', 'Dan', 'beautiful', 'Marie', 'sparks', 'fly', 'involved', 'so', 'part', 'only', 'uncover', 'will', 'be', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'Marie', 'dating', 'Dan', 'younger', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Trying', 'hide', 'growing', 'affection', 'one', 'Dan', 'Marie', 'try', 'play', 'cool', 'soon', 'more', 'can', 'handle.The', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'glorified', 'rom-com', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'push', 'deserved', 'had', 'been', 'campaigned', 'what', 'really', 'heartfelt', 'honest', 'portrait', 'middle-aged', 'growth', 'development', 'sincerity', 'way', 'Dan', 'terms', 'own', 'person', 'trying', 'understand', 'who', 'man', 'father', 'widower', 'Carell', 'outstanding', 'here', 'something', 'never', 'imagined', 'would', 'say', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'marvelous', 'usual', 'giving', 'delicate', 'performance', 'layer', 'spunk', 'wit', 'delicious', 'sense', 'word', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'performance', 'find', 'repulsive', 'was', 'genuine', 'charming', 'natural.I', 'just', 'love', 'piano-side', 'sing-along', 'piggyface', 'was', 'scenes', 'gave', 'film', 'lovely', 'sense', 'naturalness.Between', 'stellar', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'scripting', 'nothing', 'ever', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'even', 'romance', 'developed', 'smarts', 'apposed', 'usual', 'laziness', 'comical', 'yet', 'appropriate', 'dialog', 'MURDERER', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'real', 'deal', 'am', 'just', 'such', 'state', 'pleasant', 'very', 'welcomed', 'shock', 'right', 'now.Now', 'let', 'talk', 'fixing', 'ridiculous', 'cover-art']",N/A

Dan becomes rather unlikeable.  It seems a stretch that Juliet Binoche's character would remain attracted or at least intrigued.Still, Hedges' fingerprints are all over the film in a masterful way.  He brought the acting group together (save for Carell, who was busy filming 'The Office') to have them practice being a family unit.  That shows - this feels like a family.  I note that he brought together some superb NYC theater actors in his ensemble, most notably Dianne Wiest, Nobert Leo Butz and the incomparable Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone).Also, his choice of Pete Townsend's underrated hit ""Let My Love Open the Door"" is wonderful.

Steve Carrell stars as Dan Burns, an advice columnist raising 3 girls alone since his wife died 4 years ago. It is family vacation time so Dan and his girls drive out to his parents house. They are joined by his two brothers and sister and all their kids in what amounts to a huge mess of a family gathering. In other words, it is a gathering that looks just like one in my family. Dan escapes to go buy the morning paper and on the way meets a woman, Anna Marie, played by Juliette Binoche. They have a great time and Dan falls for her. He knows this is uncharted waters for him, but he takes a chance. He tells his family about it briefly, only to see Marie (what she prefers to be called) at his house. It seems Marie is his brother's Mitch's (Dane Cook) new girlfriend.The rest of the movie follows a few themes. Primarily, Dan is forced to watch Mitch and Marie have a great time knowing in his heart Marie is the one for him. Second, Dan has to struggle to be a good father to his daughters while finally stepping out and doing something for himself. Third, Marie and Dan slowly fall for each other and must find out a way for their relationship to be successful.I've glanced at a few negative reviews of the movie and some complaints included Dane Cook, the pig-faced song, the middle daughter, and the mass confusion of all the characters. I think this movie is my first exposure to Dane Cook and I had no problem with him. He plays the cocky, womanizing younger brother perfectly. While he may be a jerk to the ladies at times, he certainly loves his brother, and you can tell. The pig-faced song was kind of uncomfortable, but it works in this situation because it highlights the absurdity of Dan's plight and plays off the actual appearance of the ""pig-faced"" girl. The middle daugter, only 15, just ""knows"" she is in love and is at times over the top. But her obsession with her own love plays off Dan and his inability to confront love in his own life. Finally, there were definitely tons of family members there, brothers, sisters, cousins, etc. The mass confusion fit perfectly for the movie. You could tell the family loved and accepted each other.This movie is great for older couples, or for people that don't enjoy risque, raunchy humor. There aren't any nasty scenes or even bad language I can recall. If fact, I'm astonished this movie is PG-13. There is really nothing offensive in the movie. I'm a Carrell fan so might be overlooking the lack of chemistry between him and Binoche. When I watch a movie, I always hope for the best and refuse to be so picky that it harms my enjoyment of the film.

That is until Dan discovers later that day that the new woman in his life happens to be dating his younger brother Mitch (Dane Cook).And wouldn't you know, this all takes place at a big family gathering where Dan fails miserably at hiding his newfound romantic inclinations for his brother's special guest.

Neely ""BellaOnline Comedy Movies S...","[2, 2]","Dan In Real Life (directed by Peter Hedges) is a family reunion that you can attend in your own living room. And you won't have to deal with kissing aunts, loud children and bragging cousins.Dan Burns (Steve Carell) is a middle-aged widower with three daughters (Alison Phil, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston). Even though he is a relationship columnist and trained in helping others, he can't help himself find love. While attending a family reunion at his parent's house in Rhode Island, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) at a book shop. The two click instantly but part ways, Dan promising to call her. When he arrives back at the house he discovers that Marie is his younger brother Mitch's (Dane Cook) girlfriend. Chaos ensues as Dan struggles to hold back his feelings for her.The family is perfectly cast. Though overbearing at times, I can sense that they truly care about his well being. They do crosswords together. They exercise, hold a talent show, all while having fun. But they are not perfect. Their remarks about Dan and his lack of a love life are at times crass and unsupportive. The characters are also flawed. Dan's younger brother has a murky past that involves a parade of women. I'm glad that the writers make them loving but most importantly human, imperfect.Carell and Binoche have tremendous chemistry with one another. They are struggling with a situation they've been shoved into. Their love jumps out of the screen and they compel people to root for them.I also enjoy the humor. Carrell is a brilliant humorist. He rises to acting superiority when he takes on complicated movies (I.e. Little Miss Sunshine) as opposed to the family movies he has starred in. Cook also surprises.Some parts of the movie like the shower scene are unrealistic. I cannot picture that happening in real life. I feel that the director threw it into the movie for laughs.The major problem I had was with the daughters; mainly the two eldest. I understand that the middle child is a teenager and has plenty of hormones pumping through her body. I can excuse some of her behavior though not all of it. But the oldest daughter is self-righteous and harsh to Dan. She wants to travel the world. She wants to be perceived as mature. But the way she acts towards her own father proves that she is not capable of doing either. At the beginning she appears to be kind and friendly. However, she loses me when she tells Dan that he doesn't stand a chance with Marie.Despite some of its character and writing flaws, Dan In Real Life is a sweet light-hearted romantic comedy that proves love at first sight is possible.",5,A sweet romantic comedy that will lift spirits,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2619,"['Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'family', 'reunion', 'can', 'attend', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'kissing', 'aunts', 'loud', 'children', 'bragging', 'cousins.Dan', 'Burns', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'middle-aged', 'widower', 'three', 'daughters', 'Alison', 'Phil', 'Brittany', 'Robertson', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'Even', 'relationship', 'columnist', 'trained', 'helping', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'love', 'attending', 'family', 'reunion', 'parent', 'house', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Marie', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'book', 'shop', 'two', 'click', 'instantly', 'part', 'ways', 'Dan', 'promising', 'call', 'When', 'back', 'house', 'Marie', 'younger', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'girlfriend', 'Chaos', 'Dan', 'hold', 'back', 'feelings', 'her.The', 'family', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'overbearing', 'times', 'can', 'sense', 'truly', 'care', 'well', 'being', 'do', 'crosswords', 'together', 'exercise', 'hold', 'talent', 'show', 'having', 'fun', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'remarks', 'Dan', 'lack', 'love', 'life', 'are', 'times', 'crass', 'unsupportive', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'flawed', 'Dan', 'younger', 'brother', 'murky', 'parade', 'women', ""'m"", 'glad', 'writers', 'make', 'loving', 'most', 'importantly', 'human', 'imperfect.Carell', 'Binoche', 'have', 'tremendous', 'chemistry', 'one', 'are', 'struggling', 'situation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shoved', 'love', 'screen', 'compel', 'people', 'root', 'them.I', 'also', 'humor', 'Carrell', 'brilliant', 'humorist', 'acting', 'superiority', 'when', 'complicated', 'movies', 'I.e', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'opposed', 'family', 'movies', 'starred', 'Cook', 'also', 'surprises.Some', 'parts', 'movie', 'shower', 'scene', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'can', 'not', 'picture', 'happening', 'real', 'life', 'feel', 'director', 'threw', 'movie', 'laughs.The', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'daughters', 'mainly', 'two', 'eldest', 'understand', 'middle', 'child', 'teenager', 'plenty', 'hormones', 'pumping', 'body', 'can', 'excuse', 'behavior', 'not', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'self-righteous', 'harsh', 'Dan', 'travel', 'world', 'be', 'perceived', 'mature', 'way', 'own', 'father', 'not', 'capable', 'doing', 'beginning', 'be', 'kind', 'friendly', 'However', 'when', 'Dan', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Marie.Despite', 'character', 'writing', 'flaws', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'sweet', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'possible']",N/A

Here's a film that shows just how unexpected, irregular, and confusing love can be, both in terms of family and romantic interests. There's intelligence to this story that's equally humorous and heartbreaking, proving once and for all that love is difficult to receive and even more difficult maintain. At times, it's also difficult to acknowledge, especially if it's being kept a secret. The greatest difficulty of all is letting go of love, to recognize that the past is the past and to know when to move on. All this is explored in ""Dan in Real Life,"" a smart, witty, and touching romantic comedy that doesn't lose itself to an overabundance of clich&eacute;s. The formulaic elements are there, but they're presented in a new way, and they're used in a story that can actually support them. They're not used simply because we expect them to be.The plot focuses on Dan Burns (Steve Carell), a widowed advice columnist living in New Jersey with his three daughters. They all drive to Rhode Island for an annual family reunion, and its there that Dan meets Marie (Juliette Binoche), a good-natured woman who has traveled the world and seen many sights. Their romance comes to a halt when Dan discovers that Marie is dating his brother, Mitch (Dane Cook). Dan spends the rest of the film struggling with his feelings, unwilling to let Marie go yet unable to be honest with his family, who he can't seem to connect with.As simple as this plot sounds, a number of fascinating, thought provoking elements liven things up. One of the most interesting is the relationship between Dan and his daughters. The two oldest are typical in that they hate Dan: seventeen-year-old Jane (Alison Pill) is desperate to see the world, and a great way to start would be to finally learn how to drive; fifteen-year-old Cara (Brittany Robertson) believes that she's deeply in love with a boy from school, and she openly despises her father for not letting that love develop. At one point, she screams that he's a murderer of love. Dan tries to rationalize the situation--Cara has only known the boy for three days, and it's impossible to know whether or not you're in love so quickly. Eventually, Dan begins to analyze his love for Marie, who he had only met three days earlier. His youngest daughter, Lilly (Marlene Lawston), is the least hostile, despite not understanding why her father behaves the way he does. As his love for Marie deepens, he loses track of Lilly, and he ultimately hurts her feelings by neglecting to read a special book she made for him.Another important element is the relationship between Dan and his immediate family; because he makes himself so distant, they look at him more with concern than with love. Some feel that he needs to finally let go of his dead wife--his parents (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest) set him on a blind date with an old family acquaintance (Emily Blunt), hoping that he'll finally have some fun. This suits his brother, Clay (Norbert Leo Butz), just fine, since he feels that Dan should ""uncork"" himself. The pressure they're putting on Dan is unmistakable, as is the fact that their actions are well intentioned but completely unnecessary. This is probably why he attempts to engage his nieces and nephews, even when they make it clear that they don't want to be engaged.But the relationship between Dan and Marie is the most important element. It all boils down to the fact that two love struck people are under the same roof, unable to show their feelings for each other. How long can this go on? Will anyone notice? Will either of them be able to come clean? These are the questions we find ourselves asking as the film progresses, not only because the story is entertaining, but also because we eventually realize that Dan is not following the advice in his own written columns. Dan himself realizes this when his articles are considered for syndication in a major newspaper--he has become a hypocrite, someone so blindsided by love that he didn't think about who might get hurt by it.Is it normal for love to be this emotionally exhausting? I don't think I'm the right person to answer that question, which is probably just as well; a recommendation for ""Dan in Real Life"" doesn't depend so much on what I think, but on the mindset you bring to the theater. This classic Boy Meet Girl fable is told in a non-traditional way, relying more on genuine emotional development than on a formulaic structure. Although it allows for the film's one weakness--an abrupt ending--the emotional development still does wonders for the story, preventing it from becoming a bland, meaningless romantic comedy. It helps that all of the characters are believable, especially Dan; as he comes to terms with the ups and downs of life, our own humanity is reaffirmed. This alone makes ""Dan in Real Life"" a heartfelt, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable film.",4,"Yours Truly, Love Struck in Rhode Island",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,4988,"['Anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'love', 'many', 'splendored', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'Here', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'unexpected', 'irregular', 'confusing', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'terms', 'family', 'romantic', 'interests', 'intelligence', 'story', 'equally', 'humorous', 'heartbreaking', 'proving', 'once', 'love', 'difficult', 'receive', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'times', 'also', 'difficult', 'acknowledge', 'especially', 'being', 'kept', 'secret', 'greatest', 'difficulty', 'letting', 'go', 'love', 'recognize', 'past', 'past', 'know', 'when', 'move', 'explored', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'smart', 'witty', 'touching', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'lose', 'overabundance', 'clich', 'eacute', 'formulaic', 'elements', 'are', 'there', ""'re"", 'presented', 'new', 'way', ""'re"", 'used', 'story', 'can', 'actually', 'support', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'simply', 'expect', 'be.The', 'plot', 'focuses', 'Dan', 'Burns', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'widowed', 'advice', 'columnist', 'living', 'New', 'Jersey', 'three', 'daughters', 'drive', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'annual', 'family', 'reunion', 'Dan', 'meets', 'Marie', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'good-natured', 'woman', 'who', 'traveled', 'world', 'seen', 'many', 'sights', 'romance', 'halt', 'when', 'Dan', 'Marie', 'dating', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Dan', 'rest', 'film', 'struggling', 'feelings', 'unwilling', 'let', 'Marie', 'go', 'yet', 'unable', 'be', 'honest', 'family', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect', 'with.As', 'simple', 'plot', 'number', 'fascinating', 'thought', 'provoking', 'elements', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'daughters', 'two', 'oldest', 'are', 'typical', 'hate', 'Dan', 'seventeen-year-old', 'Jane', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'desperate', 'see', 'world', 'great', 'way', 'start', 'would', 'be', 'finally', 'learn', 'how', 'drive', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Cara', 'Brittany', 'Robertson', 'deeply', 'love', 'boy', 'school', 'openly', 'father', 'not', 'letting', 'love', 'develop', 'one', 'point', 'screams', 'murderer', 'love', 'Dan', 'rationalize', 'situation', 'Cara', 'only', 'known', 'boy', 'three', 'days', 'impossible', 'know', 'not', ""'re"", 'love', 'so', 'quickly', 'Eventually', 'Dan', 'analyze', 'love', 'Marie', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'met', 'three', 'days', 'earlier', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Lilly', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'least', 'hostile', 'not', 'understanding', 'why', 'father', 'way', 'love', 'Marie', 'deepens', 'track', 'Lilly', 'ultimately', 'feelings', 'neglecting', 'read', 'special', 'book', 'made', 'him.Another', 'important', 'element', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'immediate', 'family', 'so', 'distant', 'look', 'more', 'concern', 'love', 'feel', 'finally', 'let', 'go', 'dead', 'wife', 'parents', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'set', 'blind', 'date', 'old', 'family', 'acquaintance', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'have', 'fun', 'suits', 'brother', 'Clay', 'Norbert', 'Leo', 'Butz', 'just', 'fine', 'Dan', 'should', 'uncork', 'pressure', ""'re"", 'putting', 'Dan', 'unmistakable', 'fact', 'actions', 'are', 'well', 'intentioned', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'probably', 'why', 'engage', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'even', 'when', 'make', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'engaged.But', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'Marie', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'down', 'fact', 'two', 'love', 'struck', 'people', 'are', 'same', 'roof', 'unable', 'show', 'feelings', 'other', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'go', 'Will', 'anyone', 'notice', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'clean', 'are', 'questions', 'find', 'ourselves', 'asking', 'film', 'progresses', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'entertaining', 'also', 'eventually', 'realize', 'Dan', 'not', 'following', 'advice', 'own', 'written', 'columns', 'Dan', 'when', 'articles', 'are', 'considered', 'syndication', 'major', 'newspaper', 'become', 'hypocrite', 'someone', 'so', 'blindsided', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'who', 'might', 'get', 'hurt', 'it.Is', 'normal', 'love', 'be', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'right', 'person', 'answer', 'question', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'recommendation', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', ""n't"", 'depend', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'think', 'mindset', 'bring', 'theater', 'classic', 'Boy', 'Meet', 'Girl', 'fable', 'told', 'non-traditional', 'way', 'relying', 'more', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'development', 'formulaic', 'structure', 'film', 'one', 'weakness', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'emotional', 'development', 'still', 'wonders', 'story', 'preventing', 'becoming', 'bland', 'meaningless', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'especially', 'Dan', 'terms', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'own', 'humanity', 'reaffirmed', 'alone', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'heartfelt', 'funny', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film']",N/A
1130639,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00118T632,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","A lot of romantic comedies follow an incredibly rigid formula. Guy will meet girl and they fall in love but guy does something stupid which breaks it up and while both are trying to move on, guy decides to do something embarassing/public which will win her heart. However occasionally a film will come along that at least plays with the conventions but either doesn't do it sufficiently enough or some story things just feel wrong for the tone. Dan in Real Life is that kind of film where it doesn't deal with romance in a way-too-common manner but what it does with it doesn't work either.Dan Burns is an advice columnist and single dad to 3 daughters after their mom died four years ago. Travelling to family reunion, Dan meets Anne-Marie, a charming woman that Dan almost instantly connects with and is excited at its prospects. Upon returning back to the house he gets a surprise when his brother Mitch is in a relationship with none other than Marie and the family is more than ecstatic with the pairing. With her always around and his own family on the rocks, Dan has to hide his feelings even when Marie shows signs she cares for him as well.I can very much relate with Dan since on more than one occasion I've had feelings for a woman that unfortunately is unavailable (and strangely involved with the poorest excuse for a guy in town) but I never had a family that seems so nasty as this one. Scheduling a blind date with a girl they remember having a slight ""pig-like"" face, the family proceeds to crack jokes and even sing a song that seems more demeaning and teasing than a family affair. Even though it's a romantic comedy, the family seems almost intentionally mean at times and it's almost depressing to watch considering what Dan has to be around.Plus the dynamic between Dan and Marie (helped by the good chemistry they have) doesn't seem to go beyond that bookstore meaning and whereas Mitch is clearly not the right guy, going as far as to use pre-written lines - by Dan, of course - Dan and Marie have one big bonding scene where they can get along before the world crashes down around him and he spends a good time skulking. But at least the acting is generally solid all around, including the actresses who play Dan's daughters while Dane Cook is probably his least irritating though he seems like he's just playing a tamer version of other roles he's played or even a tamer Dane Cook.I would recommend watching the film since it's at least different than those Matthew McConaughey/Kate Hudson-type rom-coms but on the other hand, I appreciate Dan in Real Life for what it wanted to do but I can't based on what it did.",3,A rom-com even guys can stomach,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2641,"['lot', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'follow', 'incredibly', 'rigid', 'formula', 'Guy', 'will', 'meet', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'guy', 'something', 'stupid', 'up', 'are', 'trying', 'move', 'guy', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'embarassing/public', 'will', 'win', 'heart', 'However', 'occasionally', 'film', 'will', 'come', 'least', 'plays', 'conventions', ""n't"", 'do', 'sufficiently', 'enough', 'story', 'things', 'just', 'feel', 'wrong', 'tone', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'kind', 'film', 'where', ""n't"", 'deal', 'romance', 'way-too-common', 'manner', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'either.Dan', 'Burns', 'advice', 'columnist', 'single', 'dad', '3', 'daughters', 'mom', 'died', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Travelling', 'family', 'reunion', 'Dan', 'Anne-Marie', 'charming', 'woman', 'Dan', 'almost', 'instantly', 'excited', 'prospects', 'returning', 'back', 'house', 'surprise', 'when', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'relationship', 'none', 'other', 'Marie', 'family', 'more', 'ecstatic', 'pairing', 'always', 'own', 'family', 'rocks', 'Dan', 'hide', 'feelings', 'even', 'when', 'Marie', 'signs', 'well.I', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'relate', 'Dan', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', ""'ve"", 'had', 'feelings', 'woman', 'unfortunately', 'unavailable', 'strangely', 'involved', 'poorest', 'excuse', 'guy', 'town', 'never', 'had', 'family', 'so', 'nasty', 'one', 'Scheduling', 'blind', 'date', 'girl', 'remember', 'having', 'slight', 'pig-like', 'face', 'family', 'proceeds', 'crack', 'jokes', 'even', 'sing', 'song', 'more', 'demeaning', 'teasing', 'family', 'affair', 'Even', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'family', 'almost', 'intentionally', 'mean', 'times', 'almost', 'depressing', 'watch', 'considering', 'what', 'Dan', 'be', 'dynamic', 'Dan', 'Marie', 'helped', 'good', 'chemistry', 'have', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'bookstore', 'meaning', 'whereas', 'Mitch', 'clearly', 'not', 'right', 'guy', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'use', 'pre-written', 'lines', 'Dan', 'course', 'Dan', 'Marie', 'have', 'one', 'big', 'bonding', 'scene', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'along', 'world', 'down', 'good', 'time', 'skulking', 'least', 'acting', 'generally', 'solid', 'including', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Dan', 'daughters', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'probably', 'least', 'irritating', 'just', 'playing', 'tamer', 'version', 'other', 'roles', 'played', 'even', 'tamer', 'Dane', 'Cook.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'least', 'different', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey/Kate', 'Hudson-type', 'rom-coms', 'other', 'hand', 'appreciate', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'based', 'what', 'did']",N/A

1130643,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00118T632,Cubist,"[1, 3]","As he proved withPieces of April, director Peter Hedges has a knack for depicting the intracies of family dynamics. He's not afraid to show awkward and uncomfortable moments because that's what happens when you get a family of any decent size together - all the old feuds come bubbling to the surface. With a large cast of characters and plenty of overlapping dialogue, Hedges seems to be influenced by Robert Altman with a dash of family dysfunction from Woody Allen'sHannah and Her Sisters.Hedges avoids the usual clich&eacute; of having the flawed brother be a jerk so that we are inclined to root for Dan. Comedian Dane Cook plays Mitch as a nice guy who is funny and seems to genuinely love Marie. Sadly, Juliette Binoche's character is rather two-dimensional and more scenes that explored her background would have been a nice addition. That being said, Dan in Real Life provides all kinds of emotional layers that people love to enjoy in this kind of a film. There are many real moments that illustrate just how messy and complicated life can be.""Just Like Family: The Making of Dan in Real Life"" takes a look at how this film came together. The cast gush about working with Hedges and praises his collaborative spirit. This featurette also takes a look at the house where most of the action takes place and Hedges says that he wanted it to be like another character.""Handmade Music: Creating the Score"" takes a look at the film's soundtrack. Hedges says that he finds most American films to be over-scored and wanted to go for a more minimal soundtrack.Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Hedges. He puts these scenes in context and explains why they were cut. There is a lot more interaction between Dan and his daughters. Hedges is honest about why this footage was cut (he blames his weak direction for one).There is the obligatory ""Outtakes"" reel with the cast blowing their lines when someone else makes them laugh. There is lots of goofing around on the set, mostly by Dane Cook and Carell.Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Peter Hedges. Originally, he was hired to polish an existing screenplay but after working on it for five months, the studio liked it so much that they asked him to direct. Hedges talks about filming certain scenes and his intentions behind them. He also touches upon shaping the film through editing in this fairly engaging track.",5,A nice blend of comedy and drama,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,2412,"['proved', 'withPieces', 'April', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'knack', 'depicting', 'intracies', 'family', 'dynamics', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'what', 'when', 'get', 'family', 'decent', 'size', 'together', 'old', 'feuds', 'come', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'plenty', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'Hedges', 'be', 'influenced', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'dash', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'Woody', ""Allen'sHannah"", 'Her', 'Sisters.Hedges', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'having', 'flawed', 'brother', 'be', 'jerk', 'so', 'are', 'inclined', 'root', 'Dan', 'Comedian', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Mitch', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'funny', 'genuinely', 'love', 'Marie', 'Sadly', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'character', 'rather', 'two-dimensional', 'more', 'scenes', 'explored', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'addition', 'being', 'said', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'kinds', 'emotional', 'layers', 'people', 'love', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'real', 'moments', 'illustrate', 'just', 'how', 'messy', 'complicated', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'Just', 'Family', 'Making', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'cast', 'gush', 'working', 'Hedges', 'collaborative', 'spirit', 'featurette', 'also', 'look', 'house', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'Hedges', 'wanted', 'be', 'character', 'Handmade', 'Music', 'Creating', 'Score', 'look', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Hedges', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'be', 'over-scored', 'wanted', 'go', 'more', 'minimal', 'soundtrack.Also', 'included', 'are', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Hedges', 'scenes', 'context', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'lot', 'more', 'interaction', 'Dan', 'daughters', 'Hedges', 'honest', 'about', 'why', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'weak', 'direction', 'one', 'obligatory', 'Outtakes', 'reel', 'cast', 'blowing', 'lines', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'laugh', 'lots', 'goofing', 'around', 'set', 'mostly', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Carell.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'Originally', 'was', 'hired', 'polish', 'existing', 'screenplay', 'working', 'five', 'months', 'studio', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'asked', 'direct', 'Hedges', 'talks', 'filming', 'certain', 'scenes', 'intentions', 'also', 'shaping', 'film', 'editing', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'track']",N/A

When he goes on a trip to a family get-together, and meets a woman in a bookstore, he sees a new hope for his future--until that girl turns out to be his brother's girlfriend...""Dan in Real Life"" isn't a perfect movie.  The plot--specifically, certain scenes--are a bit contrived.  And there isn't much chemestry between Carrell and Juliette Binoche at first (there's more later on, specifically during the bowling alley scene).  But the film never really sets out to be perfect--in fact, it deals with the imperfections of love.  Dan's own brother tells him he should do whatever it takes to get this girl--but how can Dan do that, when it's his brother's girlfriend?  Combine that with the tired-joke of a self-help writer who can't help himself, and you've got the makins for a (feel) good comedy.If nothing else, watch the movie for Steve Carrell.  Those who know him from ""The Office"" or ""Anchorman"" or even ""40 Year Old Virgin"" might be a bit shocked...but don't be.  Carrell isn't just one of the great comedy actors of our time--he can do drama, too.  He will break your heart.  Dane Cook surprised me; I'm not much of a fan of his standup, and even though he won me over in ""Mr. Brooks,"" I was skeptical about this particular casting choice.  However, he is remarkable (I still refuse to watch ""Employee of the Month"" though, and am ignoring ""Waiting"").  Juliette Binoche is charmingly out of place as the girl torn between two men (I think a little more could have gone into developing her character).  Peter Mahoney is remarkable as always, and the rest of Dan's family (good lord, was Amy Ryan in EVERY movie released in the past year?) is superbly portrayed.  The ""piggy song"" sequence in particular is pure and utter enjoyment.So ""Dan"" isn't perfect (both guy and movie), but is certainly enjoyable (again, guy and movie).  It does indeed border on the ""feel good"" comedy genre, but has hints of genuine pathos in there, far more than most comedies.  It's not really a romantic comedy (don't think of it like that; if anything, it's the antithesis)...it's more in a genre of its own.  And hopefully, it will inspire Steve Carrell to broaden his horizons further (as he did previously in, say, ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" though this is certainly more an out-right comedy than that darkly humorous little gem).  The man can make you laugh 'til your sides hurt one second, and rip your heart out of your chest the next.

I'll give it two stars only because there are a few funny moments here and there, but they only serve as false hope.  Steve Carell is great and catches your interest right off the bat, but, the film SERIOUSLY derails during the shower scene in my opinion.  Everything followed a fairly realistic and somewhat humorous approach until Dan's love interest hops in the shower.  It was like a train hitting a wall at that point.At the immediate point she jumps in the shower, I remember thinking, this is going to start sucking now.  And...oh....it does.  It's like two different directors worked on this.  The one who took over after the shower seems like an intern perhaps.  You are then treated to a never ending barrage of ""family"" group activites which are so over-the-top corny that you will surely cringe.  All I can say is there is far too much singing involved.  If you're on my wave length at all, that's all I need to say.Carrell gets the two stars, but the rest of the cast is unremarkable and slightly annoying.  This was likely a better role for Ben Stiller to play, but it's not nearly as intelligently done as Meet the Parents.

After all, that was a very realistic dysfunctional family drama.Well, something happened to his writing. What was once a very true to life story (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) catapaulted into a somewhat sappy, almost contrived comedy. (Dan in Real Life)I don't want to say that I hated the movie. There were some good moments. Dan burns writes an column in the paper called, ""Dan in Real Life,"" and apparently from what his family says, (You don't get to read much of what is in his articles) he gives marriage and family advice. In his own family, however, some might say that he doesn't live up to his column. Not sure why. He seems to be a dad doing the best he can. His wife died, leaving him with three daughters, and there is really only one of them that he is having problems with. The middle child, who is a young teenager, claims to be in love with her boyfriend after a few days, and will stop at nothing to be with him.Dan has mourned the death of his wife for four years now, so when he visits family in Rhode Island, he is in a bookstore and happens upon Marie, who he only spends a short amount of time with, but he is taken with her. The twist is: (which isn't much of a twist, considering that most of the story was given away in the trailer) that she is already Dan's brother's girlfriend. Even though they know each other for a couple of hours, Dan is in love (or infatuated) with her.I did like that it was a ""real life"" dilemma and wondered how Dan was going to make it through that situation, but there were some things that didn't quite sit well with me.The humor, presented once again in the trailer was present, but lacking. What the trailer showed, aside from a few other belly laughs, was it. Though maybe someone might argue with me here, but...what family spends days together doing every single ""family"" activity you can think of with no hesitation, including competitive crossword puzzles, salsa aerobics, coin tosses, and talent shows with every person participating? I just found that it went a little bit to far. My family plays games and sings karaoke at family parties, but...every hour on the hour a new game or competition? I don't know.There were some good acting moments, from Lily, the youngest daughter, Marie, and Steve's brother Mitch, but at times the story just drifted a little too far into a fantasy land, and it maybe forgettable for me for in the long run.",3,"Sometimes fun, sometimes formulaic...",1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,2533,"['was', 'excited', 'find', 'out', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'writer', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'was', 'co-writer', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'drama.Well', 'something', 'happened', 'writing', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'catapaulted', 'somewhat', 'sappy', 'almost', 'contrived', 'comedy', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'hated', 'movie', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'Dan', 'column', 'paper', 'called', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'apparently', 'what', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'read', 'much', 'what', 'articles', 'marriage', 'family', 'advice', 'own', 'family', 'however', 'might', 'say', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'column', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'be', 'dad', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'wife', 'died', 'leaving', 'three', 'daughters', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'having', 'problems', 'middle', 'child', 'who', 'young', 'teenager', 'claims', 'be', 'love', 'boyfriend', 'few', 'days', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'be', 'him.Dan', 'mourned', 'death', 'wife', 'four', 'years', 'now', 'so', 'when', 'family', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'bookstore', 'upon', 'Marie', 'who', 'only', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'taken', 'twist', ""n't"", 'much', 'twist', 'considering', 'most', 'story', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'trailer', 'already', 'Dan', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Even', 'know', 'other', 'couple', 'hours', 'Dan', 'love', 'infatuated', 'her.I', 'did', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'dilemma', 'wondered', 'how', 'Dan', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'situation', 'were', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sit', 'well', 'me.The', 'humor', 'presented', 'once', 'again', 'trailer', 'was', 'present', 'lacking', 'What', 'trailer', 'showed', 'aside', 'few', 'other', 'belly', 'was', 'maybe', 'someone', 'might', 'argue', 'here', 'what', 'family', 'days', 'together', 'doing', 'single', 'family', 'activity', 'can', 'think', 'hesitation', 'including', 'competitive', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'salsa', 'aerobics', 'coin', 'tosses', 'talent', 'shows', 'person', 'participating', 'just', 'found', 'went', 'little', 'bit', 'far', 'family', 'games', 'sings', 'karaoke', 'family', 'parties', 'hour', 'hour', 'new', 'game', 'competition', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.There', 'were', 'good', 'acting', 'moments', 'Lily', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Marie', 'Steve', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'times', 'story', 'just', 'drifted', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'fantasy', 'land', 'maybe', 'forgettable', 'long', 'run']",N/A

It was viewed on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player.The film makers succeeded in creating a REAL movie. The family, though a bit ""Disney"", was a refreshing break from some of the ""baggage ridden"" portrayals seen in recent films, that were to create them in this way. This family has great on-screen chemistry, and I particularly love the way the mom and dad still care for their older sons. Trying not to let cynicism infiltrate my review, I simply accepted the fact that a family such as this exists, and it made the film all the more sweet.The film creates a seemingly impossible situation, but a very lovable fairytale of love found after much struggle. Dan is invincible to many as he is is disconnected from himself, as well as from the real possibility of love. The otherwise ""funny man"" Steve Carrell does a great job portraying this character, and it did make me see him in a different light-most likely because I am not a watcher of ""The Office""I rented this with my girlfriend of 10 years, and we had a great time experiencing his journey to Marie's character. If you don't like romantic flicks, stay away. If you can lend yourself for 2 hours to this on-screen family, his struggles as a single dad (widower), and believe in the possibility of surprise and love, give this lone a shot.

Unfortunately, she turns out to be his brother Mitch's (Dane Cook) new girlfriend.That's really the whole story--the romance between Dan and Marie, how they make it work out, and the family dynamics.The Good:There aren't any pat answers, though it's obvious to the viewer that Marie is better suited to Dan than to Mitch, but it's not as cut-and-dried as that. Marie and Mitch aren't horribly wrong for each other.Likewise, when Dan realizes he's been neglecting his daughters in his preoccupation with Marie, the answer is neither that he should seek his fulfillment in fatherhood and forget about Marie, nor that he should devote himself to love and assume his daughters will come around eventually.Like real life, it's messy, and the answers lie somewhere in the middle.Also as in real life, the characters aren't perfect, though Dan's parents (Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney) come close.The Bad:The family as a whole is just a little too Norman Rockwell-ish to be believed.

1130658,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00118T632,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","One of the genuine surprises of Judd Apatow'sThe 40-Year-Old Virginwas the sense of self-effacing melancholy Steve Carell brought to the title role. The concept could have gone south quickly, but he brought a certain unexpected gravitas that kept the movie from being strictly a one-joke situation. Director/co-screenwriter Peter Hedges (whose first and last film was the quirkyPieces of April) captures this more fully in his gentle, character-driven 2007 comedy about a widowed father who takes his three daughters to the annual family reunion and finds the love of his life is taken by someone else close to him. From this sitcom-sounding premise comes a surprisingly alert and sweet-spirited movie thanks to a perceptive script by Hedges and Pierce Gardner (whose only previous writing credit is a horror flick,Lost Souls) and especially Carell's heartfelt performance as the emotionally straitjacketed Dan, a more rounded portrayal than he was able to give as the suicidal gay brother inLittle Miss Sunshine. There are plenty of laughs but mostly quiet ones borne out of the characters and their very human situations.The primary irony in the story is how Dan plays a newspaper columnist who gives out parenting advice but cannot seem to follow it in raising his daughters. Each girl is challenged in different ways by Dan's omnipresence in their lives with middle daughter Cara most pained over his intrusion in her budding romance with a smitten classmate. Once they make it to his parents' picturesque Rhode Island home, he meets Marie in the local bookstore where their chemistry becomes palpable almost immediately. After he shares everything about himself to her for hours, Dan sees her rush off only to meet her again back home as her younger brother Mitch's new girlfriend. Everyone is crazy about her, but Dan is only crazed with unfulfilled jealousy and hesitant resignation over his plight. Having just seen her relentlessly downbeat work in Anthony Minghella'sBreaking and Entering, I am happy to see the beguiling touch Juliette Binoche effortlessly brings to such an idealized love interest as Marie. The usually insufferable Dane Cook is surprisingly agile as Mitch, though his casting is obviously a sign of the inevitable turn of events.Sporting a very convincing American accent, Emily Blunt (the viperous first assistant Emily inThe Devil Wears Prada) steals her few scenes as Dan's loose-limbed blind date Ruthie. On the sidelines are John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest as Dan's down-to-earth parents with Wiest particularly sharp in doling out pragmatic advice to her insulated son. It's good to see Broadway's Norbert Leo Butz (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) onscreen as Dan's married brother Clay. The three daughters are dexterously played by Alison Pill (who repeats her level-headed work fromPieces of April) as the eldest Jane, Marlene Lawston (who played Jodie Foster's missing child inFlightplan) as the youngest Lilly and especially Brittany Robertson who captures all the adolescent angst as thong-wearing Cara. The seaside charm of Rhode Island is captured well by Lawrence Sher's expert cinematography, and Norwegian folk rocker Sondre Lerche provides the lilting soundtrack. There is, however, one scene that uses Pete Townshend's pop classic, ""Let My Love Open the Door"", to poignant effect thanks to Carell's affecting rendition. Even with all its predictable touches, this movie caught me off-guard with its warmth and humanism.",4,Carell Matures in a Warm and Winning Ensemble Comedy About Coming to Terms,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,3459,"['One', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'Judd', ""Apatow'sThe"", '40-Year-Old', 'Virginwas', 'sense', 'self-effacing', 'melancholy', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'brought', 'title', 'role', 'concept', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'south', 'quickly', 'brought', 'certain', 'unexpected', 'gravitas', 'kept', 'movie', 'being', 'strictly', 'one-joke', 'situation', 'Director/co-screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Hedges', 'first', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'quirkyPieces', 'April', 'more', 'fully', 'gentle', 'character-driven', '2007', 'comedy', 'widowed', 'father', 'who', 'three', 'daughters', 'annual', 'family', 'reunion', 'love', 'life', 'taken', 'someone', 'else', 'close', 'sitcom-sounding', 'premise', 'surprisingly', 'alert', 'sweet-spirited', 'movie', 'thanks', 'perceptive', 'script', 'Hedges', 'Pierce', 'Gardner', 'only', 'previous', 'writing', 'credit', 'horror', 'flick', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'especially', 'Carell', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'straitjacketed', 'Dan', 'more', 'rounded', 'portrayal', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'suicidal', 'gay', 'brother', 'inLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'ones', 'borne', 'characters', 'very', 'human', 'situations.The', 'primary', 'irony', 'story', 'how', 'Dan', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'who', 'out', 'parenting', 'advice', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'follow', 'raising', 'daughters', 'girl', 'challenged', 'different', 'ways', 'Dan', 'omnipresence', 'lives', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Cara', 'most', 'pained', 'intrusion', 'budding', 'romance', 'smitten', 'classmate', 'make', 'parents', 'picturesque', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'home', 'Marie', 'local', 'bookstore', 'where', 'chemistry', 'palpable', 'almost', 'immediately', 'shares', 'everything', 'hours', 'Dan', 'rush', 'only', 'meet', 'again', 'back', 'home', 'younger', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Everyone', 'crazy', 'Dan', 'only', 'crazed', 'unfulfilled', 'jealousy', 'hesitant', 'resignation', 'plight', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'relentlessly', 'downbeat', 'work', 'Anthony', ""Minghella'sBreaking"", 'Entering', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'beguiling', 'touch', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'effortlessly', 'such', 'idealized', 'love', 'interest', 'Marie', 'usually', 'insufferable', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'surprisingly', 'agile', 'Mitch', 'casting', 'obviously', 'sign', 'inevitable', 'turn', 'events.Sporting', 'very', 'convincing', 'American', 'accent', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'viperous', 'first', 'assistant', 'Emily', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'few', 'scenes', 'Dan', 'loose-limbed', 'blind', 'date', 'Ruthie', 'sidelines', 'are', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Dan', 'down-to-earth', 'parents', 'Wiest', 'particularly', 'sharp', 'doling', 'out', 'pragmatic', 'advice', 'insulated', 'son', 'good', 'see', 'Broadway', 'Norbert', 'Leo', 'Butz', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'onscreen', 'Dan', 'married', 'brother', 'Clay', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'dexterously', 'played', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'who', 'level-headed', 'work', 'fromPieces', 'April', 'eldest', 'Jane', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'who', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'missing', 'child', 'inFlightplan', 'youngest', 'Lilly', 'especially', 'Brittany', 'Robertson', 'who', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'thong-wearing', 'Cara', 'seaside', 'charm', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'captured', 'well', 'Lawrence', 'Sher', 'expert', 'cinematography', 'Norwegian', 'folk', 'rocker', 'Sondre', 'Lerche', 'lilting', 'soundtrack', 'however', 'one', 'scene', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'pop', 'classic', 'Let', 'My', 'Love', 'Open', 'Door', 'poignant', 'effect', 'thanks', 'Carell', 'affecting', 'rendition', 'Even', 'predictable', 'touches', 'movie', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'warmth', 'humanism']",N/A

That sort of ingratiating self-perspective is part of his appeal. Dan in Real Life is a change of pace from his clueless ""The Office"" character and the broader performances that made him stand out in recent hit films.My guess is that Dan is closer to the real Steve. In fact, as the commentary and other bonus material constantly attest, being ""real"" was the constant goal of director Peter Hedges and the cast. Though this film has its share of comic situations, it largely veers away from belly laughs. And it has a definite bittersweet edge. Often times, the lonely detachment Dan feels is painful.The soundtrack is of particular note because it does not rely heavily on familiar pop tunes to elicit a response. Rather, Hedges called upon Sondre Lerche to write original songs. The effect reminded me a bit of Meet the Robinsons, which took the same route to substantial success.The audio commentary is probably the most sincerely magnanimous one I can recall. Hedges is very quick to credit those around him for making up for his own lack of big-screen filmmaking experience, though his vision is very clearly expressed. The interesting thing is that some of the deleted scenes explained the characters and perhaps should have remained in the film; I had to wonder whether the director might have been too close to his work and assumed the audience would pick up on what he already knew.

1130677,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B00118T632,JD,"[3, 7]","I was looking forward to this film, I think Steve Carell can really act when he gets the chance, he is charismatic and easy to watch and he is kind of an every man.  But this movie doesn't deliver anything outside of his acting and even that is hit and miss.Firstly, the movie can't decide what it is.  Is it a drama, comedy, is it supposed to be romantic or tragic? Is the audience supposed to laugh or cry, sympathize or hate? I never could decide while watching the movie what I was suppose to be feeling.This movie also lacks anyone that you can really like.  Sure, the main character you find yourself sympathizing with but at the same time you look at how he runs from confrontation and resolution and you can't help but feel he is setting himself up for everything bad that happens to him.  His family is horrible, his daughters are outright spiteful and hate him, except the youngest which is so nice it is an unwelcome contrast.  His siblings don't offer any help either and the whole extended family made me want to run and hide from them.  You never get introduced to half of them and those you do meet don't do anything to help Dan, but rather further complicate his existence.  And they are just painful to watch as the ""family"" thing is so poorly thrown together, it is just a lot of people crammed into a tight space, each doing their own thing.  Half of the family members could have been cut and you wouldn't have missed them at all.I had high hopes for the film when I was watching Dan in the bookstore with his brother's girlfriend but as soon as he gets home and we get introduced to her formally the movie just goes belly up.  The two are awkward, the family misinterprets Dan's attraction as some kind of wrong obsession or something over his sister-in-law that they treat as gross and when the brother does finally figure out what is going on he knocks out Dan and essentially disappears until the credits when all sins have been forgiven I guess.  This is too bad as that brother was the closet thing to a normal family member that Dan had.Really, I wanted to like this movie, I watched it again to make sure I wasn't just missing something but I liked it less and less the more I watched it.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","Didn't plan to see this, but I've discovered a long time ago that movies are more enjoyable when you have no idea what it is about-in other words, unexpected surprises. Well, Dan in Real Life is one of those unexpected surprises. It was thoroughly charming and often funny, not as in laugh out loud funny but more of feel-good funny. Sometimes, comedies like this are the ones that get me more than the laugh out loud comedies (ex. Superbad). Its warmth totally won me over, like a puffy winter jacket. You don't want to wear it cause it looks ugly outside but later on, it wins you over cause it's warm inside. The movie is like that.The man on my left is Steve Carell, who I've despised for being himself, no not really, but he does seem to play same character in all of his movies. `Dan in Real Life' follows a depressed, lonely, widowed father of three girls, Dan Burns (Steve Carell), heading to Rhode Island to see his happy family. His three daughters aren't too happy about the trip, and aren't too happy at his stomping on anything that might resemble a relationship. Upon arriving there, he meets a woman in a bookstore and the two hit it off almost instantly. What Dan doesn't know is that the mystery woman, Marie (Juliette Binoche) is the new girlfriend of Dan's brother Mitch (Dane Cook). Now Dan must be under the same roof as his new crush for a couple of days and hide his obvious adoration for her before the family finds out and the situation gets any worse. Does not help that Marie becomes the hit of the household as she perfectly blends in to the mannerisms of the folks in the family.What appeals this movie to the average viewers is simply the brutal irony of the situation, and the terrible case of awkwardness that follows, its one of the more original dramas in terms of conflict to be released in some time. I am surprised to say he won me over in this film. His portrayal as an awkward, over-protecting widower was a spot on. I liked how calm and soft spoken he was in this film. I also thought his emotional scenes worked out very fine as well, because Carell made Dan a relatable and caring character even when it seemed he's a jerk in this film.Aside from that, this is the definite definition of ""Feel good"" comedy.

Martin ""Jeff Punk Rock Martin""","[18, 37]","Out of respect for Steve Carrel, Juliette Binoche, Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney, I'd like to pretend this all never happened. That's what I'd like to do. I can't do that, of course, because Dane Cook is in this movie too, and it's highly important that we all dislike Dane Cook. We must dislike him quite intensely, in fact. To create a sense of balance in the universe, we must dislike him in direct proportion to the amount of fame, money and success he's somehow managed to so inexplicably acquire. So, due to the fact that this movie represents one more bit of evidence as to why we should all dislike Dane Cook, we can no more ignore it than a good cop can ignore an axe covered in bloody fingerprints lying next to a hacked-up corpse.Speaking of things that have been hacked up, ""Dan in Real Life"" has just about all the humor and charm of the aforementioned corpse. It's not that this movie is just bad. It's REALLY BAD. It's bad in a way that makes the worst thing you've ever seen on the Lifetime Network look like ""Raging Bull.""The problem is that for a movie that tries soooo hard to touch our hearts, ""Dan in Real Life"" seems to forget that we also have brains. The story starts out fine: lovable, widowed Dan (Steve Carrel) takes his three daughters for a family weekend to his parents' mountain cabin. The whole thing takes a dive into the sewer, though, the minute Dan arrives at Mom and Dad's way-too-perfect lakeside retreat. If you really want to see this thing, stop reading now because I can't tell you how truly awful it is without throwing in a few spoilers.Once Dan gets to the cabin, you see, we're assaulted with one scene after another of the most nauseatingly hyper-sweetened visions of family life ever committed to film. It's not just that EVERYONE is so perfect, caring, witty and doggone likeable. It's the things the filmmakers have them do in the name of showing us what a well-adjusted clan they are. Between all the pancake breakfasts, apple-pie desserts, crossword puzzle competitions, sappy conversations about new girlfriends and family aerobics classes staged in front of the all-too-perfect cabin, there's not a believable moment to be found in the whole thing. (This is not cynicism! I like seeing movies about sweet, happy families! But watching these people is like being forced-fed a gallon of frosting through a beer bong.) And just when you thought Dan's family couldn't be any less like YOUR family, the adults and kids alike gather `round to strut their stuff in a good, old-fashioned living room talent show. Dan accompanies brother Dane Cook on guitar as the Danester sings ""Did My Love Open the Door"" to new gf Binoche. This he does in front of the whole family. Eeeeuw.It all begs the question: Are the filmmakers so unfamiliar with how things work in a real happy family that they have to create these pod people?

1130686,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B00118T632,Joe Carugati,"[26, 32]","When Steve Carell and Dane Cook were given top billing in ""Dan In Real Life,"" I expected a great or mediocre comedy filled with laughs and humor.  Congratulations again goes to the marketing that makes a film appear different than what it actually is.  This is the case with ""Dan In Real Life,"" a film that will make you laugh with the characters, but also make you bury your face into your arms at the awkward situations dealing with love.Dan (Steve Carell) is a widower, whose job is writing for an advice column in the paper and raising his three girls.  As much as he's good at helping people, Dan can't seem to connect with his daughters.  He decides to take the family to his parents' lodge for the weekend and while there he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in town and they immediately make a connection, only to separate soon after.  Coming back to the lodge, he finds out that his brother, Mitch (Dane Cook) is dating Marie and Dan has to endure the weekend, tormented with the love he has for Marie and his daughters' dislike of him.First things first, ""Dan In Real Life"" is not a comedy.  It does have touches of humor and slapstick throughout, but it's much more dramatic.  The title character is depressed and trying to make life work for him and his family.  This is the film's downfall, because at times, it doesn't know if it wants to be either a comedy or a straight drama.  It lands in the middle of the spectrum and this hurts it slightly.  Luckily, the acting is very good and keeps the film from being less than mediocre.Steve Carell is one of my favorite actors (huge fan of ""The Office"") and he didn't let me down here.  From what I saw, he was in every single scene and he truly made them better.  At one point, you'll be laughing at the absurdity of his situation, when you'll be sympathizing for his character the next (the ""Let My Love Open the Door"" scene).  Carell makes Dan extremely likeable and a character to root for.  Dane Cook gets a bad rap for his acting and although some of his movies aren't great, he does fine here as Dan's brother.  Cook downplays it and his love for Marie is believable.  He needs more roles like this.  As the love interest, Juliette Binoche is great and has good chemistry with both Carell and Cook.  All the acting was fine and was the best part of the film.What really hurt the film was Dan's daughters and the ending.  Although the actresses playing them did a good job, their characters were so poorly written.  Instead of being loving, they became annoying and grating.  Dan is trying his best to help their situation, but they make it harder for him.  Finally, the ending was too ""sweet"" for my taste.  It seemed like it came too abruptly and the end credits montage had my eyes rolling.  If they took that out, then maybe it would have fared better.Overall, ""Dan In Real Life"" surprised me in that it wasn't a consistently funny comedy, but a heartfelt drama.  Unfortunately, it had a hard time juggling both genres.  Thankfully, good acting helped the film along and made it better than it should have been.",3,Dan In Real Life,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,3077,"['When', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'were', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'expected', 'great', 'mediocre', 'comedy', 'filled', 'laughs', 'humor', 'Congratulations', 'again', 'marketing', 'film', 'different', 'what', 'actually', 'case', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'characters', 'also', 'make', 'bury', 'face', 'arms', 'awkward', 'situations', 'dealing', 'love.Dan', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'widower', 'job', 'writing', 'advice', 'column', 'paper', 'raising', 'three', 'girls', 'As', 'much', 'good', 'helping', 'people', 'Dan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect', 'daughters', 'take', 'family', 'parents', 'lodge', 'weekend', 'there', 'Marie', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'town', 'immediately', 'make', 'connection', 'only', 'separate', 'soon', 'Coming', 'back', 'lodge', 'out', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'dating', 'Marie', 'Dan', 'endure', 'weekend', 'tormented', 'love', 'Marie', 'daughters', 'dislike', 'him.First', 'things', 'first', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'not', 'comedy', 'have', 'touches', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'title', 'character', 'depressed', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'work', 'family', 'film', 'downfall', 'times', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'either', 'comedy', 'straight', 'drama', 'middle', 'spectrum', 'slightly', 'Luckily', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'being', 'less', 'mediocre.Steve', 'Carell', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'huge', 'fan', 'Office', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'here', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'single', 'scene', 'truly', 'made', 'better', 'one', 'point', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'absurdity', 'situation', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sympathizing', 'character', 'next', 'Let', 'My', 'Love', 'Open', 'Door', 'scene', 'Carell', 'Dan', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'character', 'root', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'bad', 'rap', 'acting', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'fine', 'here', 'Dan', 'brother', 'Cook', 'love', 'Marie', 'believable', 'more', 'roles', 'love', 'interest', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'great', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Carell', 'Cook', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'film.What', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'was', 'Dan', 'daughters', 'ending', 'actresses', 'playing', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'Instead', 'being', 'loving', 'became', 'annoying', 'grating', 'Dan', 'trying', 'best', 'help', 'situation', 'make', 'harder', 'Finally', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'sweet', 'taste', 'seemed', 'came', 'too', 'abruptly', 'end', 'montage', 'had', 'eyes', 'rolling', 'took', 'out', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'better.Overall', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'consistently', 'funny', 'comedy', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'juggling', 'genres', 'Thankfully', 'good', 'acting', 'helped', 'film', 'made', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Actor/comedian Steve Carell plays Dan, a newspaper advice columnist who has been a single parent to three daughters (two of them teenaged!!!) since his wife died.Carell plays the part of the grief-stricken, surviving parent, just trying to keep moving, in an extremely believable fashion.  His interactions with his three daughters are extremely realistic; although, I would have grounded the middle child for the next 30 years.  This, however, was part of the excellent portrayal of just how numb, withdrawn, sad, and lonely Dan really is.  Carell's acting in this film is a very nice departure from his other roles, and he does quite a good job.  The other members of the cast are also very realistic and enjoyable to watch.There is a really feeling of family in this movie, and it is lovely to see a basically normal, functional family coping with the joys and hardships of everyday life.  There are emotional moments, humorous events, tense scenes, and an overall celebration of family life throughout, which come across as real, and are a true pleasure to watch.Yes, this movie is a bit predictable.

He and the kids go off to his parents' (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest) house for a big family reunion where everyone loves everyone else, plays games and sports, and talks about feelings a lot.  Dan meets a lovely woman (Juliette Binoche) at a bookstore and they immediately fall for one another; little does he know she's his brother's new squeeze and is joining the family for the weekend.  Awkward!I was torn between being bored by this movie and liking it a lot.  It's relentlessly low-key; the funny bits didn't make me laugh and the touching parts bordered on being corny, but still there was something attractive and sweet to it, and I ended up glad I saw it.  Steve Carell (Evan Almighty) does his gloomy poker-face throughout, but has a certain realistic charm.  (I do wish there had been more about his advice column.) Juliette Binnoche is good as the mature, sensitive lady who's looking for love; her understated performance grew on me and I found her quite appealing.The movie paints an idyllic picture of family life and love-at-first-sight, the seaside scenery is gorgeous, and it's suitable for viewing by all ages, although I think the target audience would probably be teenage girls who are consumed by the passions of young love.

And as they are getting older, it isn't getting any easier. The oldest, Jane (Alison Pill), is begging for time behind the wheel. Middle daughter Cara (Brittany Robertson) is deep in the middle of her first true love. Which leaves the youngest, Lilly (Marlene Lawston), lost in the shuffle. If only Dan could deal with these problems as well as he doles out advice in his daily newspaper column.Every year in the fall, the Burns family meets at the parents' summer place for a few days to help get it ready for the coming winter. It's the only time all five of the kids plus their entire families are together. This particular year, Dan meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) the first morning on an errand in the nearby village. They spend some amazing time together, and Dan thinks he may finally be able to move beyond his wife. Before she leaves, he gets her phone number and learns she is already seeing someone.Arriving back at the family cabin, he discovers just who Marie is already seeing - his youngest brother Mitch (Dane Cook). Now he has to spend the next few days in very close proximity to her without falling for her. Just how awkward will this get?This is one of those movies that is almost impossible to define, mainly because it doesn't know what it wants to be. It was advertised as a comedy, but I found it more of a drama with funny parts.  I mean, I still laughed plenty, but there were also plenty of touching and emotional moments as well.  And along with the heartfelt emotion, there were plenty of shallow and embarrassing scenes.I've never been a fan of comedy that makes a fool out of someone, and quite a few of the scenes resort to that embarrassing brand of humor.  That just left me squirming rather then laughing.  Don't worry, this isn't gross out humor.  Just awkward moments that are supposed to be funny to us.While it created some funny scenes, I never did understand why Dan was relegated to the laundry room.  Why couldn't he join the rest of the single guys upstairs?Because of the large cast, the only two characters who truly get developed are Dan and Marie.  Not that the rest of the cast is bad.  Everyone does a good job with the little screen time they have.  Steve Carell especially is great at letting us know exactly what his character is feeling with just one look.And I really loved the family dynamic.

The man has displayed some range, people, range that you often don't see in a ""comedic"" actor. This tendency reminds me a bit of Jim Carrey, but I think that Carell's style is subtler and funnier.In this movie, Carell plays Dan, a widowed newspaper-advice columnist with three daughters. Dan has carried a torch for his late wife since her death (which was four years prior to the events of the movie). As the film opens, Dan is bundling his little family up for an annual visit to his parents' house. Once there, he makes a short errand into town, where he meets Marie (Binoche) in a book shop. The two feel an instant connection, and they sit and talk for hours. Later that evening, Dan is more formally introduced to Marie. She's his brother's new girlfriend. (Ouch.)During the days that follow, we watch Dan as he breaks down personal and professional barriers, learns more about what it means to put family first, and actually begins listening to some of his own advice.Carell and Binoche, I thought, were both wonderful in this, and the script taps into something that many screenwriters fail to give enough credit to - women love men who make them laugh. Comedians can play romantic leads, if they are allowed to use the aspect of their personalities that makes them (in some cases) most attractive - their senses of humor. People make jokes all the time, and at least SOME of them are really funny. We don't see enough of such light banter in film, probably because it plays best when ad-libbed, and in scripts it seems so often over-rehearsed.Carell perfectly captures the sort of giddy, joking high that one gets when one finds a kindred spirit. Dan and Marie make each other laugh, and they think the same things are funny. (Incidentally, I though Carell and Binoche had great chemistry in their scenes together.) This is a warm, funny story, and it's perfectly suited for family viewing.

It manages to be a somewhat conventional romantic comedy, but also throws a wrench into that convention.  Because--and other than the comedy, this is the best part of this movie--I just didn't know if what Dan decided to do in the end, and pretty much throughout the movie, was at all the right thing.  And that really engaged myself and the people I saw this movie with, when we weren't expecting to be engaged.Moral ambiguity put to the side, this is a thoughtful family movie that will have you cracking up over and over.  Steve Carell manages to be hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time, and stand-up comedian Dane Cook delivers a great performance as Dan's brother.  The two of these hilarious guys acting together was a pleasure to see, and made for the best scenes in this movie.It's a slow-paced and thoughtful comedy that actually gives the characters time to develop, and sets up themes early on that are all paid off in the end.  Dan (Carell) is a truly sympathetic character that makes you question how much leeway you should give your kids, the meaning of being a family man, and if romance could ever truly fit with any of that.

Contrary to what some reviews have said this is a portrait of a New England family that resembles many a family gatherings I had in my family&#8217;s homes in the northeast & New England regions.  It is a nice love story of what would you do if you found the perfect woman for you and hoped for a chance at more and then discover she is dating your brother.  Like many movies if you leave when the movies fades to dark and don&#8217;t wait for the credits you will miss the ending.

But being a Steve Carell fan, I agreed in hopes I could at least find a little humor. I was more than impressed. It turned out this film could be directed at the middle aged man with daughters who reluctantly admits that life revolves completely around them.Dan, of course, is an columnist for the local newspaper who rarely takes his own advice. A widower, his three daughters are his world, and the four of them pack for the annual family reunion and the host of characters they'll find there. Along the way, he meets Marie at a local bookstore, who captures his heart during the curious encounter. Turns out Marie is his brother's girlfriend, liked by all, and a majority of the movie is spent as they alternately try to avoid their attraction, deny it, and make each other jealous. There are many of the normal gags that come with family reunions, from the family competions, the numerous embarrassing moments, to quirky conversations around the piano and dinner table. Most are at worst quirky, but many heartfelt and silly.Perhaps most enlightening was Carell's performance as the unlucky Dan. More than previous movies where he was supported by an ensemble, this he carried on his own. He was able to come across as everyman, desperately wanting to please his children and convince others they were all he needed, while longing for something more. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, even a bit pathetic, but never over the top. His relationship and interactions with his daughters were just adorable, and the chemistry they displayed was greater than that he had with Marie. And the acoustic version of Pete Townsend's ""Let My Love Open the Door"" Carell performs may be the most memorable scene in the movie.I suppose you can be jaded enough to call this flick overly sentimental and gooey, so your experience may vary, but it did manage to touch a chord with me.

Love can be beautiful, love can be a many splendoured thing, but love can also be quite messy as it is shown in ""Dan.""  What I liked about this movie was how it showed the emptiness and loneliness of a love-struck character.  You want to be around this woman who you are in love with 24/7, but you know you can't because you either don't want to scare her away or in Dan's case--you don't want to step over the boundary line of a brother who you are close to.  (Dan is in love with his brother's girlfriend.)  This insightful movie showed Dan's awkwardness not only around his brother's girlfriend but also around his family.  Even though Dan may be middle-aged, he's acting just like his love-struck, teenage daughter.  He tries to act all adult and mature in his newspaper columns about relationships, but in real life he's just as clueless as anyone else.  This is one of the few Hollywood movies to really show man's vulnerability when he is in love.  Steve Carell was not all macho or cool as other actors, such as Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis or Richard Gere.  To me Steve Carell is a throwback to the same type of characters that Woody Allen portrayed in ""Play It Again, Sam"" and ""Annie Hall.""  (It's interesting that Steve Carell was in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda."")  Both Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche turn in excellent performances.  I disagree with Amazon's critic that they lacked chemistry in the movie.  Just as Steve Carell was vulnerable, Juliette Binoche was endearing--and easily someone who you can fall in love with.

There he meets Anna-Marie (gorgeous as ever Juliet Binoche) at a bookstore, who unbeknownst to each other is actually dating Mitch Burns (Dane cook) who is Dan's brother.

Steve carell and Juliet Binoche as a screen couple, now that's a razzie award for worst screen couple waiting to happen (a la Will ferrel and Nicole Kidman from Bewitched). But it works and works well, i thought Steve carell has really come of age as an actor and has very good screen prescence in terms of character integrity, like a late bloomer (Samuel L and George Clooney), he has really done a good job in this film, Juliet Binoche, well.. no need to describe this woman, lovely as ever and complements Steve Carell on screen very efficiently.Where i felt this movie went wrong was it appears to shine in patches with some clever dialogs and fails in others in terms of uber emotive dramatic (which erupt suddenly from calm waters in a irritating way) scenes and terrible cliches'. (even a cliche' is acceptable till its done well)But it would have been 3 stars and the extra star is for the guys singing Ruthie 'Pigface' Draper whilst making fun of their brother's date. i thought it was hilarious.I have total contempt for this indie-poop-folk-whatever of this Lechre' person, i did not like it, but i thought it added a good cover for describing the aura of a typical New England scene.a good light hearted movie to rent out, nothing groundbreaking here.",4,""" Ruthie!

I saw the DVD cover with Steve Carell with his head resting on a giant mound of pancakes and was sucked in by it's cutesiness. I thought, Hey this is going to be a cute romantic comedy about a single dad who finds true love,in spite of his three daughters (who he loves even though they drive him crazy).Hardly. It started it out ok. Dan is a big name columnist. He and his three daughters drive up to Rhode Island for a family reunion.His beloved wife died of cancer and he has had some trouble moving on with his life.He is shooed out of the house and meets an mysterious,sweet woman at a bookstore and they go out for coffee.He comes back to the house happier than he has been in months only to find she is engaged to his brother.(who is played by Dane Cook,more of him later)That is when this movie falls apart..He spends the rest of movie trying to steal this woman he has only known for two hours off of his brother who clearly is in love with her. The tension builds.And it just turns into a big mess from there.Dan ruins the whole reunion for the whole family, by being a pill and trying to steal his brother's girlfriend.Here is a few other reasons I hated this movie.For one reason, he looks far too young for the part he is playing.For another, Steve Carell is totally miscast in this movie. He was put on this earth to play Michael on the hit tv show ""the Office"" and he is wonderful at it.They should of had Robin Williams play this part. He could have brought more to the table and made this movie what it should have been.Another problem with this movie is , it can't decide what kind of movie it is. So it just keeps bouncing from tragedy, to drama, to romance and whatever other genre cliche you can think of.The only the reason I gave it two stars is because of Dane Cook. He plays a loud funny guy, who likes to tell bad jokes and play tag team football and would love to have someone to travel with and laugh through life with.He just breathes life into an otherwise dead movie.

Carell darn near stole the show inBruce Almightyto the point where the funniest segments were cut from the theatrical release because he upstaged Carrey so much, but those scenes where fortunately made available on the DVD release.  Carell was again the saving grace ofEvan AlmightyandThe 40-Year-Old Virginin which both most likely would have died unnoticed had it not been for his sincere performances.  This comedian definitely knows how to act.  Carell reminds me of the legendary Dick Van Dyke when he had serious roles or moments and Bob Newhart's dry comedic delivery.  It all just seems so effortless on Carell's part.In another affecting performance we have Carell as a widower raising three daughters alone and giving his tidbits of wisdom on doing so in a local column titled ""Dan in Real Life.""  Even though his wife has died four years ago, he has yet to really move beyond that in the way of a relationship.  He has focused all his attention of his children and while that is admirable, a parent is still allowed to look out for himself too.  He has not and the annual fall trip to his parents' cabin plays out all too realistically with everyone pushing him to find someone and he does.He bumps into a lovely woman in town that he's immediately drawn to.  She is played by the ever radiant Oscar winning actress Juliette Binoche, the only reason to seeThe English Patientand one who makes turning 43 seem really cool and desirable.  In the hands of any other actress this role would have been blown out of portion, but in the subtle hands of Binoche, it is a delicate and balanced performance.  Unfortunately, this terrific woman who seems perfect for him is, in reality, his brother's latest flame that he's brought down to the family cabin to meet everyone for the first time because ""this one is different.""Sadly, the effects of this are handled much like a TV-movie or a good episode of that old series ""Love Boat"", or any other sitcom for that matter.  What makes this film ultimately rise above that is admirable work done by the leads.  These are seriously understated performances that are quite touching, believable and memorable in spite of a seriously flawed script at times.Some of the humor in this film is both lame and predictable, but the execution is always dead on.  Again, the performances are the key to this tired formula of the awkward romance.  I guess this film is a good example of style over substance.

1130750,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B00118T632,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[1, 1]","Remember when Steve Carell was ""That one guy on The Daily Show"" and not a comedy superstar? And remember when he was by far the more popular of the Carell/Colbert duo on Stewart's show? Me neither. Somehow Carell went from being that goofy guy on Comedy Central to being in every damn thing out there. (Let's just forget about Evan Almighty for a moment.)Perhaps more than his comedic performances, Steve's been typecast for his ability to turn in an absolutely stunning dramedic affair. With Michael Scott on The Office and his character in Little Miss Sunshine, he showed that he could do more than pure comedy, and thankfully for his career, at a much earlier stage than Jim Carrey did.Now, Steve turns his sights on romantic comedies by partnering with everyone's favorite douche, Dane Cook. Carell plays a character named Dan Burns, who happens to be an advice columnist with a sordid life of his own. (What a twist!) Dan's a widower with three daughters, and suffers from severe loneliness and depression while trying to cope with being the dad of three blossoming daughters.Things seem to be black and bleak for Dan until he goes up to his family's cabin for a get together, and meets a wonderful girl at the shop. They hit it off, and for the first time since his wife (we assume), he gets the sought after digits. Unfortunately, this is a movie, so obviously things aren't that peachy keen, and it turns out this woman is the girlfriend of Dan's brother, played by Dane Cook himself.Despite the title and Steve's past works' hinting, Dan in Real Life is by no means a darkly comedic portrayal of real life events. Rather, it's Steve Carell in a romcom. You'll have the typical romcom setups, the situations, and the eventual ending that you'll see coming. For what it is, it succeeds. It's one of the few romcoms that guys will like as well as girls, so at least it has that going for it. Is it this year's Little Miss Sunshine? Sadly, no. But it's still a better-than-average movie you won't regret watching.CONTENT - 3/5Despite the title, it's not realistic by any means. It's a sweet, sentimental romcom starring today's hottest comedy stars, and it succeeds at being entertaining while doing nothing extraordinary. Watch it, enjoy it, and forget about it until you see it on TV years from now.VIDEO - 3/5It's not a fantastic transfer as some colors came out a little too soft and some of the darker scenes aren't as clear as the theatrical release, but it's not terrible. It looks washed out and muddled at time, but you can make out what's on-screen. Just an odd change thematically from the original source.AUDIO - 4/5Obviously it's a dialog-driven film so surround or anything won't really matter at all. What is worth noting, though, is the fantastic work Sondre Lerche does with the music. It often fits so well you don't even notice it's there. This is how all indie-music-driven films should operate. (Hear that, Braff?)EXTRAS - 3/5Some director commentary, some behind the scenes looks, and that's that. The deleted scenes and outtakes are nothing too special, but what does stand out is that the director had a blast making this movie, as did everyone on it. It's refreshing to see a cast so in tune with one another in this day and age. I just wish we had more of Steve's presence in the extras, a la Nathan Fillion in his (one or two) good movies.REPLAY - 2.5/5It has its moments, but for the most part this is the kind of movie you'll watch once and then forget about or never watch again unless someone notices it sitting there. The jokes aren't so great they stay funny, and while the performances are good they aren't THAT good. Purely a rental affair.OVERALL - 3/5Dan in Real Life may not be what people expect with a Carell film, but that could be a good thing. Once again Steve spreads his acting wings and performs a role we haven't really seen too often from him, and once again his audience base is widened. It's a simple, (un)realistic look at family life and the tragedy of growing old alone and raising children, but it's entertaining and the kind of movie perfect for a rainy day.",3,"Not your usual Carell, but just as good",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,4118,"['Remember', 'when', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'was', 'one', 'guy', 'Daily', 'Show', 'not', 'comedy', 'superstar', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'popular', 'Carell/Colbert', 'duo', 'Stewart', 'show', 'Me', 'Somehow', 'Carell', 'went', 'being', 'goofy', 'guy', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'being', 'damn', 'thing', 'there', 'Let', 'just', 'forget', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'moment', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Steve', 'been', 'typecast', 'ability', 'turn', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'dramedic', 'affair', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Office', 'character', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'showed', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'pure', 'comedy', 'thankfully', 'career', 'much', 'earlier', 'stage', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'did.Now', 'Steve', 'sights', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'partnering', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'douche', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Carell', 'character', 'named', 'Dan', 'Burns', 'who', 'be', 'advice', 'columnist', 'sordid', 'life', 'own', 'What', 'twist', 'Dan', 'widower', 'three', 'daughters', 'suffers', 'severe', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'trying', 'cope', 'being', 'dad', 'three', 'blossoming', 'daughters.Things', 'seem', 'be', 'black', 'bleak', 'Dan', 'up', 'family', 'cabin', 'get', 'together', 'wonderful', 'girl', 'shop', 'hit', 'off', 'first', 'time', 'wife', 'assume', 'sought', 'digits', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'so', 'obviously', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'peachy', 'keen', 'out', 'woman', 'girlfriend', 'Dan', 'brother', 'played', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'title', 'Steve', 'past', 'works', 'hinting', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'portrayal', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'Rather', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'romcom', ""'ll"", 'have', 'typical', 'romcom', 'setups', 'situations', 'eventual', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'what', 'one', 'few', 'romcoms', 'guys', 'will', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'so', 'least', 'going', 'year', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Sadly', 'still', 'better-than-average', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching.CONTENT', '3/5Despite', 'title', 'not', 'realistic', 'means', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'romcom', 'starring', 'today', 'hottest', 'comedy', 'stars', 'being', 'entertaining', 'doing', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'forget', 'see', 'TV', 'years', 'now.VIDEO', '3/5It', 'not', 'fantastic', 'transfer', 'colors', 'came', 'out', 'little', 'too', 'soft', 'darker', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'theatrical', 'release', 'not', 'terrible', 'washed', 'out', 'muddled', 'time', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'on-screen', 'Just', 'odd', 'change', 'thematically', 'original', 'source.AUDIO', '4/5Obviously', 'dialog-driven', 'film', 'so', 'surround', 'anything', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'What', 'worth', 'noting', 'fantastic', 'work', 'Sondre', 'Lerche', 'music', 'often', 'so', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'there', 'how', 'indie-music-driven', 'films', 'should', 'operate', 'Braff', 'EXTRAS', '3/5Some', 'director', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'are', 'nothing', 'too', 'special', 'what', 'stand', 'out', 'director', 'had', 'blast', 'making', 'movie', 'did', 'everyone', 'refreshing', 'see', 'cast', 'so', 'tune', 'one', 'day', 'age', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'Steve', 'presence', 'extras', 'la', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'movies.REPLAY', '2.5/5It', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'kind', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'forget', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'someone', 'notices', 'sitting', 'there', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'stay', 'funny', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'are', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'good', 'Purely', 'rental', 'affair.OVERALL', '3/5Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'people', 'expect', 'Carell', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Once', 'again', 'Steve', 'acting', 'wings', 'role', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'too', 'often', 'once', 'again', 'audience', 'base', 'widened', 'simple', 'un', 'realistic', 'look', 'family', 'life', 'tragedy', 'growing', 'old', 'alone', 'raising', 'children', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'movie', 'perfect', 'rainy', 'day']",N/A

1130752,A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O,B00118T632,The Trophy,"[8, 18]","First of all, I'll be honest, I was expecting the ""Forty Year Old Virgin"" except this time the main character is a single dad. EHHHH!!! WRONG! But I still gave this movie an honest chance and parts of the movie were just stupidly put together.Here's what I liked about the movie: 1) Dane Cook is in it. 2)Steve Corell is in it. 3) The part of the movie where Dan mets his brother's girl friend and that dies down in a couple of minutes.Now the negatives. (SPOILERS)  First, Dan's kids really really hate him throughout the whole movie and they don't show enough dorky or over protective behavior to warrant him being a crappy dad. They could have showed him missing plays or practices or more examples of him not paying enough attention to his kids, which he does neglect to pay attention to his one daughter only ONCE through out the whole movie. And at the end of the movie, nothing between them is resolved.Second, the family in this movie was stupid. Dan has a family consisting of like 600+ people at his parents' house and for the most part, except for Dane Cook, they 're all interchangeable. Sure there is a bald guy and the rest have hair... but that won't cut it. Besides none of the family looks like they could be related. GOOD JOB CASTING DIRECTOR!!!Point-in-case~ Dane Cook and Steve Corell. And to top it off, Dan's family is just really annoying and just intrudes on his business through out the move. I think if I had a family like that I'd probably never go to Thanksgiving without a weapon of sorts.Third, the story in this movie SUCKS. After Dan meets his brother's G/f nothing else happens except Dan then meets his brother's g/f at a bowling alley after she brakes up with Dan's brother and MAGICALLY the rest of Dan's family knows where he's at and shows up. Dan gets popped in the head by Dane Cook's character and the two never make up. In fact, Dane Cook steals Dan's date from one part of the movie. And then during the film's credits Dane's at his wedding. YEAH, OKAY!Fourth, the ending happens soooo quick it's pathetic. Maybe you saw it, but remember the end of ""The Forty Year Old Virgin"" where you get the sense of happiness, contenment, and just an overall feeling of everything in life is going to be okay? Every movie unless it's a horror movie or ""Shindler's List"" should have that same type of ending.

1130753,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00118T632,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 3]","I enjoyed ""Dan In Real Life"", the new film starring Steve Carell, Dane Cook and Juliette Binoche. The film reminded me of the type of romantic comedies we used to see in the Forties, the type of film Frank Capra would make. Am I saying ""Dan"" is as good as a Frank Capra film? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! But it is reminiscent of these films.Dan Burns (Carell) is an advice columnist, specializing in helping parents having problems with their kids and, naturally, his life has its difficulties. He is a single dad raising three children and he can't seem to do anything right in their eyes. Each of the children is different; the oldest girl wants to learn how to drive and pleads with her dad to let her. The middle girl wears tiny panties and is `madly' in love with a boy she met three weeks ago. The youngest daughter is the most forgiving and wants to just spend time with her wacky dad.Wow. Wait a minute. This is a film thornhill liked? As I am in the process of recapping the film even I am beginning to doubt myself. But yes, I did enjoy ""Dan"". Yes, there are many, many obvious moments or clich&eacute;s, but they are treated in such a sweet natured way that it is difficult to not enjoy the ride.Yes, of course, Dan will have problems in his life. The minute you learn he is an advice columnist there is nothing else that could happen. Of course, he can't do anything right in the eyes of his children; the main purpose of his column is to give advice to other parents about dealing with their children. Get it? Filmmaker Peter Hedges (""Pieces of April"") is trying to build conflict and drama into the story. He may be taking the most obvious route to do it, but he is doing it.When Dan and his kids set out to join the rest of their extended family at the grandparent's (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest) beach house, there are some amusing moments as each of the children get a moment to establish their character. Particularly amusing are the middle daughter's views of love. These moments allow Dan to react to his daughter, and allow Carell to provide fairly deadpan, amusing ""parent' expressions when his daughter is overreacting. It is a nice moment for Carell and really helps him establish Dan as a real father, despite all of the clich&eacute;s and obvious moments. When you realize early on that everything Dan stands for or is against will be tested over the course of this story, it is up to Hedges to find amusing ways to show us this. For the most part, he succeeds. The oldest daughter, who is 17, seems more levelheaded and wants time to practice driving. Dan is horrified of the thought and prefers she ride a bike. Dan's test in this regard is fairly amusing.When they arrive at the house, Dan is relegated to the `Special Room' on the first floor because Mitch (Cook) has a `Special Friend' coming. The next morning, after getting in a fight with his daughters, Dan's mom (Wiest) asks him to go and get the newspapers, to give them some breathing space. He drives into the small town and wanders into the bookstore. Marie (Binoche) arrives and mistakes him for an employee. She asks for a recommendation and they talk about books for a few moments, a bookstore employee reveals Dan's ruse and they go outside to talk some more. Dan seems to feel very comfortable with Marie, because he talks and talks and talks. And she is an attentive listener. Then, she gets a call on her cell phone and has to rush off. Dan buys the papers and returns to the house to find Marie is her brother Mitch's new girlfriend.I am sure you are as surprised as I was at this point.I think the thing that saves this film is how comfortable Carell and Binoche appear together. They each have a natural charm allowing them to enjoy each other's company, becoming friends and this leads to the attraction. The moment they start talking, you almost see the characters click.Naturally, Dane Cook's character, Mitch, has to be a little of a heal. But to Hedges credit, he only allows Mitch to be a little self-centered. A physical trainer, Mitch met Marie at one of his classes, and then they started dating. Mitch introduces her as Annie, her middle name, because `Marie' is too similar to the names of two other people in his class. We quickly learn she doesn't like this, yet Mitch continues to call her this, seemingly oblivious, leading Dan to become exasperated, and provide Marie with the first evidence of his growing love.When the house becomes filled with family members, things get chaotic and crazy. Again to Hedge's credit, they are chaotic and crazy in a good way. Everyone knows everyone else, so when some piece of drama begins to unfold, Nana (Wiest) can nip the problem in the bud with a quick retort. Or, the adult brothers and sisters hurry to watch, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible.Despite all of the surprisingly good bits, the film does occasionally falter. A family talent show sends the sickening sweet scale through the roof. Worse yet, these talent bits are presented as more of a montage, allowing only brief glimpses of the cloying moments. You might think this is a saving grace, but it is actually more of an assault on the senses. The images are so fast and furious they almost overwhelm; Wiest dressed as Charlie Chaplin spitting water out of her mouth while her husband (John Mahoney) sits at her side and laughs, one of the daughters and her husband singing opera, the adopted child reading something. Dan's older daughter, who apparently doesn't have a talent, per se, is the lucky one because she merely has to organize the event. She is, however, still required to wear a wacky `bohemian' outfit. They even make a stage and signs announcing each of the acts for this annual talent show. Presumably, everyone learns a new talent every year.Emily Blunt (""The Devil Wears Pravda"") has a brief role as the daughter of a neighbor. Nana arranges for her to come over and meet Dan, again, but Dan can only remember the little awkward girl he used to know. When a beautiful woman shows up, everyone is surprised and Dan suddenly feels energized to go on the double date with Mitch and Marie. Naturally, this makes Marie a little jealous.Then Blunt's character disappears for pretty much the remainder of the film only to return briefly in the conclusion.This isn't really a necessary character because Dan and Marie have enough going on they don't need this additional `test'. It is going to be hard enough for them to come to terms with being in love and how to make this happen while causing the least amount of emotional harm.""Dan In Real Life"" is formulaic, predictable and even a bit treacle at times. But it works. And this is largely due to the performances of Carell and Binoche. Carell is able to restrain his comedy, making the character seem more real. But at the same time, he harnesses some aspects of his previous comedy personas to give Dan an edge. He is a single father, trying to raise three daughters, so the fact that he is a bit sarcastic only helps to make his character seem more interesting. But the sarcasm is restrained. And Binoche's Marie is a lively, interesting woman who would naturally win over just about anyone. And she wins us over.",4,"""Dan in Real Life"" - No, not real life, but enjoyable nonetheless",1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,7203,"['enjoyed', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'new', 'film', 'starring', 'Steve',

1130754,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00118T632,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 4]","Apparently the Cannes Film Festival is full of violent and nasty movies full of people doing horrible things to each other. And I have to admit, I love those movies. I sawThe Evil Deadwhen I was a kid.Last Exit to Brooklyn (An Evergreen book)is one of my favorite books and I've seen The Wire: The Complete Series all the way through twice and plan on watching it many more times. However, I am a sucker for a movie that's exactly the opposite.At face value, this is a rom-com with a slightly different demographic as the main character is a widower in his forties. It has all the elements of a rom-com. The characters meet and they hit it off. There is a hinderance in the form of another man. About 10 minutes before the ending, the characters are separated but eventually one goes and runs to the other one and they get together. In that way, there's not much of a surprise.But what distinguishes this movie from the average rom-com is the sweetness that runs throughout the movie. The main character is part of a family that genuinely cares for each other. The titular Dan and the new love actually try to do the right thing. Even Dane Cook comes off as a genuinely sweet character and he's the role that would usually be the heel. Most romantic comedies that have another man who works as an impediment take the copout and make that other man into a total jackass.Definitely, Maybe (Widescreen)worked on that principle but the movie was supposed to be a mystery where you don't know who ends up with Ryan Reynolds. Dan in Real Life is much better for not falling into that copout because it has no extra reason not to.This isn't one of the best movies ever. But it is a genuinely sweet movie full of genuinely nice people who like each other and care about each other. And sometimes that's so much better than cool cynicism and nastiness. In fact, it will make you wonder why you've been watching so much horribleness recently.",5,A genuinely sweet movie,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1932,"['Apparently', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'full', 'violent', 'nasty', 'movies', 'full', 'people', 'doing', 'horrible', 'things', 'other', 'have', 'admit', 'love', 'movies', 'sawThe', 'Evil', 'Deadwhen', 'was', 'kid.Last', 'Exit', 'Brooklyn', 'Evergreen', 'book', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'Series', 'way', 'twice', 'plan', 'watching', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'However', 'am', 'sucker', 'movie', 'exactly', 'opposite.At', 'face', 'value', 'rom-com', 'slightly', 'different', 'demographic', 'main', 'character', 'widower', 'forties', 'elements', 'rom-com', 'characters', 'meet', 'hit', 'off', 'hinderance', 'form', 'man', '10', 'minutes', 'ending', 'characters', 'are', 'separated', 'eventually', 'one', 'other', 'one', 'get', 'together', 'way', 'not', 'much', 'surprise.But', 'what', 'movie', 'average', 'rom-com', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'part', 'family', 'genuinely', 'other', 'titular', 'Dan', 'new', 'love', 'actually', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Even', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'off', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'character', 'role', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'heel', 'Most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'impediment', 'take', 'copout', 'make', 'other', 'man', 'total', 'jackass.Definitely', 'Maybe', 'Widescreen', 'worked', 'principle', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'mystery', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'up', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'falling', 'copout', 'extra', 'reason', 'not', 'to.This', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'movie', 'full', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'people', 'who', 'other', 'care', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'cool', 'cynicism', 'nastiness', 'fact', 'will', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'so', 'much', 'horribleness', 'recently']",N/A
1130755,AUB7WXM7IX81,B00118T632,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[9, 14]","I saw this movie only because of Steve Carell, expecting another throwaway romantic comedy.  What I got was a bland, sub-standard film that ineffectively tackles issues of family and middle-aged romance.  In the extremely contrived plot, Dan Burns falls in love with a woman during a chance encounter (to put it lightly) at a book store while in Rhode Island for a family reunion, only to discover that she is his brother's girlfriend!  This setup provides an excuse for her to remain in the movie, and all the family members love her, as displayed in a sickening and cloying manner, which pretty much describes the rest of ""Dan in Real Life,"" which doesn't resemble real life in the least.Dan, of course, is a widowed sadsack who passively takes out his misery on his two teenage daughters while maintaining a connection of sorts with his much younger third daughter.  We're made to believe he is skilled writer for an advice column in a local newspaper, despite not being able to follow one bit of this advice in his own life.  As his daughters accurately point out later in the film, Dan is nothing but a liar and a hypocrite, yet he is supposed to be warm and likable.  His middle daughter despises him, and for good reason, because he doesn't approve of her new relationship with a boy at school.  He claims he doesn't believe that someone can fall in love in a short period of time, as this girl repeatedly and annoying claims is indeed possible, but he does the exact same thing.  In addition, he doesn't trust his older daughter to drive the family's car, a beat-up station wagon that looks to be about twenty years old, yet he has a series of run-ins with a local cop because of his own terrible driving.  Incidently, these scenes provide the only chuckles this movie offers.The supposed romance between Carrel and Juliette Binoche is downright painful to watch.  We never really understand how the two develop such strong feelings for each other, as their interaction is either provided through montages or conflicts.  Dane Cooks adds another layer of annoyance as Dan's brother.  The love triange also set the stage for a number of comic mishaps and awkward moments, none of which are funny or even the least bit touching.This movie was a moderate hit at the box office, although for the life of me I can't understand why.  There's nothing original about it; it's predictable in every way.  If you can stand watching a tepid relationship between the two leads develop in the forefront of a lame setup, you might enjoy this movie.  The only reasons I am giving this movie two stars is because of a handful of mildly amusing scenes and Carrel's presence.

Dan (Carell)is a newspaper advice columnist that discusses the difficulty of parenting and he should know first hand; he has three daughters two high school students and a six year old that he is raising by himself. He hasn't been able to click with anyone romantically since his wife died four years ago until he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche)that he meets in the Book and Tackle Store near his Dad (John Mahoney)and Mom's (Dianne Weist)family retreat. Dan's there to spent some time with his brothers, sister, nephews, nieces and in-laws. He's the only single guy there and manages to get Marie's phone number. The only problem is that SHE's his brother Mitch's (Dane Cook) new girlfriend. Awkwardness and comedy ensues as Marie and Dan discover that they are right for each other in all the ways that Mitch and Marie are wrong.Carell gives a charming performance perfectly capturing how lost Dan is without his wife and how he struggles to maintain a relationship with his girls. Writer/director Peter Hedges accurately captures the often difficult relationship that parents can have with teenagers and the performances by Allison Pil, Britney Robertson and Marlene Lawston are on target without being artifically witty (in an adult sort of way like a lot of kids are in these comedies). They reminded me of MY kids.The entire ensemble cast is terrific but Carell, Cook and Binoche truly shine due to their chemistry on screen. Mahoney and Weist are perfect as the parents of the Burns brood.The film looks crisp, with accurate colors and terrific image quality (more so for the Blu-ray but the regular DVD looks good as well).Extras include outtakes, deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (some of the scenes are so perfect that it's a pity they couldn't have figured out someway to stuff them back in)a collection of Carell's ""One More Time"" outtakes where he goofs up, a featurette and a very good commentary track from the co-writer/director Hedges. ""Dan in Reel Life"" perfectly captures the angst of Dan and the scenes often ring so true that I felt they could have come from MY family (which is a tribute to co-writers Hedges and Pierce Gardner). Hedges who wrote the screenplays for ""About A Boy"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""A Map of the World"" and many other notable films has a unique voice as a writer and director. I'm not sure who did what but Gardner who wrote the 2000 horror thriller ""Lost Souls"" (who would have thought he'd have a comedy in him?)also deserves kudos for his contribution to the script as well.""Dan in Real Life"" is a terrific, amusing romantic comedy that even guys can like due to the on-target script, direction and perfoformances.

Unfortunately, the ingredients were mixed together wrong and the result was a movie that was painful to watch after about the first twenty minutes. Carell's character, Dan Burns is a newspaper columnist and widower with three daughters.Dan and the girls head off for a weekend with the relatives at his parents cabin in Rhode Island.  When Dan goes into town for an errand, he winds up in the local bookstore and espies the beautiful Marie (Juliette Binoche) enter store.  Dan pretends to work at the store as he helps Marie find a book. One thing leads to another and the two strike up a conversation (for what can't be more than a couple of hours).  Dan falls hard for Marie (in just a couple of hours) but is disappointed when she needs to leave to go meet her boyfriend and things get crazy when it turns out that Marie is dating Mitch, Dan's brother played by Dane Cook.  From this point on the movie starts sinking faster than a stone.  Dan's family begins fawning over Marie with such fake gratuitousness, in shock how different she is from Mitch's other girlfriends.  The dinner scene is so overacted and terribly written, I almost turned the movie off.  I kept watching and was left to wonder why by the time the movie ended.  The plot becomes standard fare -- unbelievable and downright dumb scenes (the shower one in particular) along with the predictable outcome.I felt cheated because Steve Carell is one of the funnier comedic actors -- I love the ""Office"" and thought he was great in the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" -- Juliette Binoche is always wonderful and John Mahoney has always been a favorite since his ""Frasier"" days.
