It's a good dvd if you haven't done a ball workout before.  You focus on stability and balance and building up your core strength.  But because you use weights too, you also get good toning for the whole body.  They use your regular overhead presses and ab work too.  She gives you optional moves if you want to make it harder or easier and tells you what not to do wrong.Don't be fooled by thinking you can't get a good workout from a stability ball.  You will totally feel this the next day and you will be surprised with exactly how many muscles you in fact worked.  I really like this a lot.",5,Very good workout :-),1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,677,"['first', 'dummies', 'have', 'bought', 'really', 'good', 'dvd', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'ball', 'workout', 'focus', 'stability', 'balance', 'building', 'up', 'core', 'strength', 'use', 'weights', 'too', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'toning', 'whole', 'body', 'use', 'regular', 'overhead', 'presses', 'ab', 'work', 'too', 'optional', 'moves', 'want', 'make', 'harder', 'easier', 'tells', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'wrong.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'stability', 'ball', 'will', 'totally', 'feel', 'next', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'muscles', 'fact', 'worked', 'really', 'lot']",Fat to Firm Fitness Ball Workout for Dummies
