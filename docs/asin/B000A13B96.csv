918361,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000A13B96,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","Jerry Weissman well understands how disconcerting and unnerving tough questioning can be and how to handle these situations well.  This DVD is a wonderful companion to his very fine book ""In the Line of Fire"".  He provides a wonderful course on how to be act when being grilled with tough multi-questions and taking control of the situation effectively.The method he teaches is quite helpful because it is simple enough to be memorable, safe enough for beginners, and yet allows for more sophisticated use as one becomes more comfortable with it and masters its principles and techniques.  The ultimate goal  of the book and this DVD is to allow you, the one being questioned, to realize all the means at your disposal to control the questioning and the way you will respond, always truthfully, to the questions being asked.Weissman focuses on maintaining your balance, realizing what is being asked of you and provides techniques for making sure of where you are before you answer.  His device of the Roman Column within the question is quite good.  With these techniques you not only maintain control, you also have authority and credibility that comes with handling yourself well when you are in the line of fire.If you are ever going to be involved in public speaking and answering questions that matter, I recommend that you get BOTH the book and this DVD.  They go well together and will help you a great deal.  That is, if you practice them and internalize the principles that Weissman provides.",5,Great companion to the book.

Buxman ""A Seeker of Truth""","[1, 1]","Although this DVD is a companion to the book of the same name, you don't necessarily need to have read the book to gain significant benefits, although the book provides additional depth and breadth to the topics discussed in the DVD.  Jerry Weissman has had years of experience coaching CEO's and others involved in answering tough questions, and this DVD has the look and feel of a personal coaching session, at about one-fiftieth of the price.  The format of the DVD is interactive, without being distracting and is organized in such a way as to allow the viewer to experience the entire course or pick and choose pertinent sections.The DVD has a tremendous amount of information packed into just over an hour, but it all boils down to beginning with an intent to tell the TRUTH and utilizing strategies and techniques to maintain CONTROL over difficult situations.

918363,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B000A13B96,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[3, 3]","Jerry Weissman shows why he's a master presenter: this short DVD held my interest through every lesson.  Weissman uses clips from media shows and press conferences to make his point: evasive answers won't work.  Take control.  Use techniques like Topspin, Plan B and WIFFY.Weissman himself is a great role model: he knows how to hold an audience with no props or drama, just his very ordinary face wearing a suit, sharing massive amouonts of information.As someone who's done quite a bit of speaking, I feel I can always learn -- and his answers are right on. I will recommend this DVD to my own clients and ezine list.Three quibbles keep me from suggesting a full 5-star rating.  First, in a stand-alone DVD, Weissman keeps promoting his book. Folks who pay full price should never feel they're hearing a commercial, however mild.(Anyway, most viewers will have enough to learn even if they never buy the book.)Second, some points could be made more dramatically. For some chapters, we just hear Weissman; others include film clips. Weissman could have asked some friends or clients to role-play examples.Finally, as Weissman points out, most of us can't follow in the footsteps of the role model he presents, General Schwartzkopf.  So why are  all his examples drawn from politics? And why choose two former generals as great examples? Audiences bring unique expectations when they realize they're hearing fromm a 4-star general.I would have liked to see clips (or at least role-plays) of corporate speakers: managers leading a meeting, interviewees answering tough questions, sales reps handling objections.But Line of Fire is still one of the best training DVD's I've seen and I have no qualms about recommending it to anyone who wants to develop sharper communication skills, whether the flame comes from a blazing bonfire or a cigarette lighter.",4,A spell-binding series of  lessons,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,1851,"['Jerry', 'Weissman', 'why', 'master', 'presenter', 'short', 'DVD', 'held', 'interest', 'lesson', 'Weissman', 'clips', 'media', 'shows', 'press', 'conferences', 'make', 'point', 'evasive', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'Take', 'control', 'Use', 'techniques', 'Topspin', 'Plan', 'B', 'WIFFY.Weissman', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'how', 'hold', 'audience', 'props', 'drama', 'just', 'very', 'ordinary', 'face', 'wearing', 'suit', 'sharing', 'massive', 'amouonts', 'information.As', 'someone', 'who', 'done', 'quite', 'bit', 'speaking', 'feel', 'can', 'always', 'learn', 'answers', 'are', 'right', 'will', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'own', 'clients', 'ezine', 'list.Three', 'quibbles', 'keep', 'suggesting', 'full', '5-star', 'rating', 'First', 'stand-alone', 'DVD', 'Weissman', 'promoting', 'book', 'Folks', 'who', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'should', 'never', 'feel', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'commercial', 'however', 'mild', 'Anyway', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'learn', 'even', 'never', 'buy', 'book', 'Second', 'points', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'dramatically', 'chapters', 'just', 'hear', 'Weissman', 'others', 'include', 'film', 'clips', 'Weissman', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'friends', 'clients', 'role-play', 'examples.Finally', 'Weissman', 'out', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'footsteps', 'role', 'model', 'General', 'Schwartzkopf', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'examples', 'drawn', 'politics', 'why', 'choose', 'two', 'former', 'generals', 'great', 'examples', 'Audiences', 'bring', 'unique', 'expectations', 'when', 'realize', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'fromm', '4-star', 'general.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'clips', 'least', 'role-plays', 'corporate', 'speakers', 'managers', 'leading', 'meeting', 'interviewees', 'answering', 'tough', 'questions', 'sales', 'reps', 'handling', 'objections.But', 'Line', 'Fire', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'training', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'qualms', 'recommending', 'anyone', 'who', 'develop', 'sharper', 'communication', 'skills', 'flame', 'blazing', 'bonfire', 'cigarette', 'lighter']",In the Line of Fire: An Interactive Guide to Handling Tough Questions
918364,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000A13B96,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","When it comes to the art of the response and the nuances of body language, author Jerry Weissman knows what he's talking about. Having just read his briskly informative book of the same name, I can tell you that the DVD version is an even more compelling reason to listen to his invaluable tenets on public speaking. Fortunately, as this is mostly a talking-head presentation with video excerpts, Weissman himself is a fine presenter, though it would have been interesting to include actual role playing to see how he would field difficult questions.Whereas the book is more a transcript of legendary confrontation moments, mostly from televised debates, the DVD includes many of the actual excerpts discussed in the book. This allows the author to analyze the defining moments with greater clarity, even going as far as using slow motion and freeze framing to get his points across. This is well illustrated by the question raised by a woman at one of the 1992 Presidential debates about how the national recession affected each candidate personally. Weissman vividly shows how the senior Bush's fumbling response irreparably damaged his campaign, how Perot's curt reply did nothing for his and how Clinton's masterful empathy seized a defining moment and thereafter boosted his rating dramatically.Even more effective is the way Weissman breaks down Colin Powell's mastery of ""key words"" in fielding questions from foreign journalists on American imperialism at the start of the Iraqi War. Watch as Powell dexterously dodges incriminating questions by using Roman columns introduced by the questioners as buffers and bringing the inquiries back to the comfort zone of his response. In the DVD versus the book, the author wisely focuses less on the parallels with martial arts (which could have introduced some potentially silly imagery) and more on the Q&A; cycle - open the floor, recognize the questioner, yield the floor, retake the floor and provide the answer.A true master of the cycle comes across in Norman Schwarzkopf's handling of difficult questions regarding Desert Storm maneuvers. Upfront he manages the expectation of how many questions he would answer and then does not allow follow-on questions. His answers become shorter and shorter until he abruptly concludes, which Weissman recognizes as a special exception given his exalted military standing.It's great to see many classic moments such as the topspins provided by Lloyd Bentsen to Dan Quayle's self-serving comparison to JFK (""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy."") and Ronald Reagan in his volley to Henry Trewitt's expressed concern about his age (""I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."")Unfortunately, due likely to unsecured rights, Weismann was not able to show the classic Bob Newhart Show excerpt where the unprepared Dr. Hartley was grilled mercilessly by a sadistic talk show host in sheep's clothing. It seems pointless to describe it if the viewer has never seen it. The same can be said for the Kennedy-Nixon debates of which we are only shown a still.The DVD clocks in at just eighty minutes and is a fine summation of the book's most important points, though I can't help but think there is a lost opportunity to make this far more interactive than it is. Weissman does offer a few opportunities to hit the pause button to concoct our own responses to tough questions, but I wish there was a greater sense of participation. Regardless, the author provides a fine resource for those of us who become discombobulated when facing an inquisitive, often aggressive audience.",4,DVD Illustrates Sharp Insights Into How to Handle the Harshest Grilling,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,3769,"['When', 'art', 'response', 'nuances', 'body', 'language', 'author', 'Jerry', 'Weissman', 'what', 'talking', 'Having', 'just', 'read', 'briskly', 'informative', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'can', 'tell', 'DVD', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'reason', 'listen', 'invaluable', 'tenets', 'public', 'speaking', 'Fortunately', 'mostly', 'talking-head', 'presentation', 'video', 'excerpts', 'Weissman', 'fine', 'presenter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'include', 'actual', 'role', 'playing', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'field', 'difficult', 'questions.Whereas', 'book', 'more', 'transcript', 'legendary', 'confrontation', 'moments', 'mostly', 'televised', 'debates', 'DVD', 'many', 'actual', 'excerpts', 'discussed', 'book', 'author', 'analyze', 'defining', 'moments', 'greater', 'clarity', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'using', 'slow', 'motion', 'freeze', 'framing', 'get', 'points', 'well', 'illustrated', 'question', 'raised', 'woman', 'one', '1992', 'Presidential', 'debates', 'how', 'national', 'recession', 'affected', 'candidate', 'personally', 'Weissman', 'vividly', 'how', 'senior', 'Bush', 'fumbling', 'response', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'campaign', 'how', 'Perot', 'curt', 'reply', 'did', 'nothing', 'how', 'Clinton', 'masterful', 'empathy', 'seized', 'defining', 'moment', 'thereafter', 'boosted', 'rating', 'dramatically.Even', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'Weissman', 'down', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'mastery', 'key', 'words', 'fielding', 'questions', 'foreign', 'journalists', 'American', 'imperialism', 'start', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'Watch', 'Powell', 'dexterously', 'incriminating', 'questions', 'using', 'Roman', 'columns', 'introduced', 'questioners', 'buffers', 'bringing', 'inquiries', 'back', 'comfort', 'zone', 'response', 'DVD', 'book', 'author', 'wisely', 'less', 'parallels', 'martial', 'arts', 'could', 'have', 'introduced', 'potentially', 'silly', 'imagery', 'more', 'Q', 'A', 'cycle', 'open', 'floor', 'recognize', 'questioner', 'yield', 'floor', 'retake', 'floor', 'provide', 'answer.A', 'true', 'master', 'cycle', 'Norman', 'Schwarzkopf', 'handling', 'difficult', 'questions', 'regarding', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'maneuvers', 'expectation', 'how', 'many', 'questions', 'would', 'answer', 'then', 'not', 'allow', 'follow-on', 'questions', 'answers', 'become', 'shorter', 'shorter', 'abruptly', 'Weissman', 'special', 'exception', 'given', 'exalted', 'military', 'standing.It', 'great', 'see', 'many', 'classic', 'moments', 'such', 'topspins', 'provided', 'Lloyd', 'Bentsen', 'Dan', 'Quayle', 'self-serving', 'comparison', 'JFK', 'Senator', 'served', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'knew', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'friend', 'mine', 'Senator', 'are', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'volley', 'Henry', 'Trewitt', 'expressed', 'concern', 'age', 'want', 'know', 'also', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'age', 'issue', 'campaign', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'exploit', 'political', 'purposes', 'opponent', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'likely', 'unsecured', 'rights', 'Weismann', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'show', 'classic', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'where', 'unprepared', 'Dr.', 'Hartley', 'was', 'grilled', 'mercilessly', 'sadistic', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'pointless', 'describe', 'viewer', 'never', 'seen', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Kennedy-Nixon', 'debates', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'still.The', 'DVD', 'clocks', 'just', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'fine', 'summation', 'book', 'most', 'important', 'points', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'make', 'far', 'more', 'interactive', 'Weissman', 'offer', 'few', 'opportunities', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'concoct', 'own', 'responses', 'tough', 'questions', 'wish', 'was', 'greater', 'sense', 'participation', 'Regardless', 'author', 'fine', 'resource', 'who', 'become', 'discombobulated', 'when', 'facing', 'inquisitive', 'often', 'aggressive', 'audience']",In the Line of Fire: An Interactive Guide to Handling Tough Questions
918365,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000A13B96,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[5, 5]","I recently finished reading the companion book for this DVD. I must say they truly complement each other. Since the topic they deal with is that of handling tough questions, it is VERY important to be able to see the masters at it, along with those who make mistakes, in action. This is where this DVD does an incredible job: it presents the viewer with the footage for all the examples presented in the book, as they took place and with Mr. Weissman interjecting as the different speakers do their thing, pointing out the details and things you should be on the lookout for.Is the DVD interactive? It's fairly linear, except for the moments you are asked to stop and consider what is about to happen (what response you think the speaker gave). So I guess you could say it is interactive to a certain extent. However, the real value of the DVD lies in the footage, more than anything else. It's not a substitute to the book, which it obviously quotes and refers to. Don't think this is like the audiovisual equivalent to the book, and try to view the DVD to skip the reading: if you do this, you will miss much. The two complement each other wonderfully. My recommendation is: get both and enjoy their combined power.",4,Great footage to learn how to field those tough questions: get it ALONG with the book,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1217,"['recently', 'finished', 'reading', 'companion', 'book', 'DVD', 'must', 'say', 'truly', 'complement', 'other', 'topic', 'deal', 'handling', 'tough', 'questions', 'VERY', 'important', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'masters', 'who', 'make', 'mistakes', 'action', 'where', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'job', 'viewer', 'footage', 'examples', 'presented', 'book', 'took', 'place', 'Mr.', 'Weissman', 'interjecting', 'different', 'speakers', 'do', 'thing', 'pointing', 'out', 'details', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'lookout', 'DVD', 'interactive', 'fairly', 'linear', 'moments', 'are', 'asked', 'stop', 'consider', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'what', 'response', 'think', 'speaker', 'gave', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'interactive', 'certain', 'extent', 'However', 'real', 'value', 'DVD', 'footage', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'substitute', 'book', 'obviously', 'refers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'audiovisual', 'equivalent', 'book', 'try', 'view', 'DVD', 'skip', 'reading', 'do', 'will', 'miss', 'much', 'two', 'complement', 'other', 'wonderfully', 'recommendation', 'get', 'enjoy', 'combined', 'power']",In the Line of Fire: An Interactive Guide to Handling Tough Questions
