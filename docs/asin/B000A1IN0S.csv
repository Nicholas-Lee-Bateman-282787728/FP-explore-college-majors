918448,A2FDKMTT60QZAQ,B000A1IN0S,Jackie,"[0, 0]","I have been looking for potty training videos for my daughter that don't use ""pull ups"" as I don't intend to use them. I think they are a waste of money. We are using training panties & plastic pants. My daughter seems to pick up things quite well from educational cartoons so I wanted to try it for potty training as well. That said, this video was not a good choice. First, they put too much emphasis on how great diapers are. Not exactly the message I want to get across. There is even a song about diapers being great. Second, this would cater more towards boys than girls as the bear learning to go potty is a boy. The girl bear they show on the cover is his neighbor and she only is in the story a couple times when he goes out to play. He does get the idea of wanting to wear underwear when he finds out she is wearing them, but I wouldn't say its enough to make it more girl friendly. Third, they really don't show him using the potty except at the very end when his mom brings home a potty seat for the big toilet. I'm trying to teach my daughter to use her little potty first as she is too scared to sit on her seat that goes on the big toilet. I would think that would be true of most toddlers her age (she's a few days shy of being 2). All in all, I really was not impressed with this video and thought it to be terrible for trying to encourage her to use the potty.",3,Not a very good potty training video,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1378,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'potty', 'training', 'videos', 'daughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'pull', 'ups', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'use', 'think', 'are', 'waste', 'money', 'are', 'using', 'training', 'panties', 'plastic', 'pants', 'daughter', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'quite', 'well', 'educational', 'cartoons', 'so', 'wanted', 'try', 'potty', 'training', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'video', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'choice', 'First', 'put', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'how', 'great', 'diapers', 'are', 'Not', 'exactly', 'message', 'want', 'get', 'even', 'song', 'diapers', 'being', 'great', 'Second', 'would', 'cater', 'more', 'towards', 'boys', 'girls', 'bear', 'learning', 'go', 'potty', 'boy', 'girl', 'bear', 'show', 'cover', 'neighbor', 'only', 'story', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'out', 'play', 'get', 'idea', 'wanting', 'wear', 'underwear', 'when', 'out', 'wearing', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'girl', 'friendly', 'Third', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'using', 'potty', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'mom', 'home', 'potty', 'seat', 'big', 'toilet', ""'m"", 'trying', 'teach', 'daughter', 'use', 'little', 'potty', 'first', 'too', 'scared', 'sit', 'seat', 'big', 'toilet', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'toddlers', 'age', 'few', 'days', 'shy', 'being', '2', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'video', 'thought', 'be', 'terrible', 'trying', 'encourage', 'use', 'potty']",No More Diapers

Someone narrates the story.  They only show the boy bear going to the potty once or twice.  Not much information to teach my child to go to the potty.  I had to sit with her and say ""you see the boy's going to the potty"".  Because we as adults know that bears don't go in the potty.  It's a very short video, and I don't think that the price goes with the product.
