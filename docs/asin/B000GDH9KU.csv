It tries to do too many things and then there is repetition, which isn't good when the material wasn't good to begin with.  I bought this thinking it would be a hit like ""love hina"" (another harem anime), at least the best thing I can say is the series gets better from dvd vol 1, which is saying a lot.",2,Average,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,447,"['Not', 'very', 'funny', 'anime', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', '2.5', 'rating', 'animation', 'good', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'then', 'repetition', ""n't"", 'good', 'when', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'begin', 'bought', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'love', 'hina', 'harem', 'anime', 'least', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'better', 'dvd', 'vol', '1', 'saying', 'lot']",N/A

In order to make amends she gives a portion of her soul to Kazuto and swears to marry him. Unfortunately she is transformed into a child when she does this. There are bunches of other Valhallan princesses and pirates that have other plans for her.This anime is a lighthearted story. It has a sweet and fun-filled mood about it. The OVA is a good continuation of the ongoing love story between Kazuto and Valkyrie. It is a very enjoyable series and I highly recommend it.",4,A fun romantic comedy.,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,589,"['princess', 'outer', 'space', 'named', 'Valkyrie', 'crashed', 'ship', 'bath', 'house', 'owned', 'Kazuto', 'little', 'sister', 'order', 'make', 'amends', 'portion', 'soul', 'Kazuto', 'swears', 'marry', 'Unfortunately', 'transformed', 'child', 'when', 'are', 'bunches', 'other', 'Valhallan', 'princesses', 'pirates', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'her.This', 'anime', 'lighthearted', 'story', 'sweet', 'fun-filled', 'mood', 'OVA', 'good', 'continuation', 'ongoing', 'love', 'story', 'Kazuto', 'Valkyrie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It recaps the whole first Season, than goes into a funny, but short story about Valkrie, and her friend doing a game to see if their ready to be married.  It's not that bad, and if you take it for what it is, it's an important part of the WHOLE story, which is in it's 4th season.It's Cheap, and if your collecting the season's, than you need this to complet the collection.This DVD is not a stand alone story, it's apart of a bigger picture, and this is used only to fill the time, while they were making season two.",4,"Not bad, if you know what your Buying",1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,598,"['First', 'Filler', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Two', 'whole', 'first', 'Season', 'funny', 'short', 'story', 'Valkrie', 'friend', 'doing', 'game', 'see', 'ready', 'be', 'married', 'not', 'bad', 'take', 'what', 'important', 'part', 'WHOLE', 'story', '4th', 'season.It', 'Cheap', 'collecting', 'season', 'need', 'complet', 'collection.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'story', 'apart', 'bigger', 'picture', 'used', 'only', 'fill', 'time', 'were', 'making', 'season', 'two']",N/A
