Wit takes you through the horrible journey of cancer, down to its rawness, to its darkest moments. Incredibly, though you would think so, this movie was not depressing...it was uplifting. The intelligence and inspiring idea's behind Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson) is that you can find irony and humility within the written word. She is a literary professor that takes her studies very seriously, believing her lessons will one day help her student's find understanding in life. All too soon she realizes that she will need it more than she could have ever fathomed. Christopher Lloyd does terrifically as her personal physician, and shows a new side to his tallent. Personally, I more enjoyed the scenes when she sits and talks to us as if we were there with her, experiencing the pain, knowing what she knows and feeling what she feels. As if we are Vivian's only friends. Rarely...and I rarely distribute the word rarely...a movie like Wit comes along, and deals with a subject that is all too common, and yet sheds a brighter light, for us to see and learn something new. Emma Thompsons performance is one of the greatest one-woman shows in the history of film. Though her surrounding characters were greatly supportive, she carried the film, there's no doubting it. As Vivian Bearing, she is unshakable as a heart-set woman determined to succeed. By using her wit, those things we find so horrible, will suddenly make sense.",5,"Death, be not proud...",995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,1534,"['were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Wit', 'HBO', 'then', 'probably', 'agree', 'made', 'better', 'person', 'Wit', 'horrible', 'journey', 'cancer', 'down', 'rawness', 'darkest', 'moments', 'Incredibly', 'would', 'think', 'so', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'depressing', 'was', 'uplifting', 'intelligence', 'inspiring', 'idea', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'can', 'find', 'irony', 'humility', 'written', 'word', 'literary', 'professor', 'studies', 'very', 'seriously', 'believing', 'lessons', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'help', 'student', 'find', 'understanding', 'life', 'too', 'soon', 'will', 'need', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'fathomed', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'terrifically', 'personal', 'physician', 'new', 'side', 'tallent', 'Personally', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'when', 'talks', 'were', 'there', 'experiencing', 'pain', 'knowing', 'what', 'feeling', 'what', 'are', 'Vivian', 'only', 'friends', 'Rarely', 'rarely', 'distribute', 'word', 'rarely', 'movie', 'Wit', 'along', 'deals', 'subject', 'too', 'common', 'yet', 'sheds', 'brighter', 'light', 'see', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'Emma', 'Thompsons', 'performance', 'one', 'greatest', 'one-woman', 'shows', 'history', 'film', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'were', 'greatly', 'supportive', 'carried', 'film', 'doubting', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'unshakable', 'heart-set', 'woman', 'determined', 'succeed', 'using', 'wit', 'things', 'find', 'so', 'horrible', 'will', 'suddenly', 'make', 'sense']",Wit

The spareness, the pace - both of which some other reviewers have commented on - seem to reflect, paradoxically, the experience of what is being faced - and as the character, Professor Bearing, comes to say: simplicity. Yet the story and the experience are anything but 'simplicity'. Profound, deeply thought provoking, comforting, rich, eloquent - and yet there are no words, as she also says at one point, even though words have meant so much to her. The comma in John Donne's poem - I think the lines that reflect on that are some of the most - affecting I've ever heard. One of the most moving scenes ever viewed in a film is the one where Professor Bearing's nurse played so wonderfully by Audra MacDonald rubs lotion on Professor Bearing's hands; so moving I wasn't sure I could bear it. This film is just extraordinary in every way and I wish I knew that Ms.Thompson, Mr. Nichols, Ms. McDonald, Ms. Edson, et al. could know how much it meant to my husband and me to watch it. John Donne, whose poetry was a subject in another of my favorite films - 84 Charing Cross Road - was done proud.

It is a serious movie that may lead you to think more closely on how you live your life and how much consideration you have for others in it.Emma Thompson plays Dr. Vivian Bearing a staunch English professor specializing in a 17th century poet, Donne, most well known for his poems on death and the afterlife, or lack thereof.Ironically, Dr. Bearing though literate to the greatest degree on this most difficult of authors, has never really absorbed in a human sense the material she has spent her life researching. It was all abstract. In this sense she has been very &quot;abstract&quot; in dealing with the people around her as well.Initially in dealing with the disease, Dr. Bearing has attempted to maintain this abstract distance with her own disease, refusing to yield to the potential reality of its outcome. Through discussions with a former student who is now one of the doctors treating her, she comes to judge her own actions by observing those around her.Not wanting to give the movie away, I can only say, it is a hard movie not to cry throughout. Anyone who has seen a family member go through cancer treatment will recognize some of the buzzwords and much of the inadvertant rudeness of the medical staff. This is not meant as a complaint. I can see how this happens. The staff may have to; as a matter of self-preservation, keep a distance to continue to do this work day-to-day. For the patient though, this is as personal as it gets.In one scene, Emma Thompson as Dr. Bearing has a discussion with her former student where he refers to patients as a means to an end for his research, not considering he is also refering to the very patient he is now treating. Her character is content to keep this abstraction, but you as the viewer are well aware of the biting coldness of this discussion. Magnificent writing, heartless reality.

This film hits so hard and will be remembered long after it's over for one simple reason. It's so real. This is real life. If the subject matter is tough for you to get into, then check it out just for Emma Thompson's performance. Amazing. Emma stars as Vivian Bearing, an English teacher who is diagnosed with cancer. The film then follows her through her life and her ordeal with the deadly disease. It's all her. The whole film focuses on her and her point of view, and doesn't go for the medical view of it. It's about human compassion. It's about facing one's mortality. The movie is so shockingly real, with no cotton candy covering at all. Emma Thompson's performance is nothing short of astonishing. You feel for her. You pray for her. You feel as if you know her. I certainly did. This film brought back some very personal memories of my own. My aunt died from cancer a number of years ago. She moved in with us and we took care of her. I watched as she faded away. Rather quickly at that as well. The images and different stages of it that I saw were really tough on an 11 year old. Images I will never forget as long as I live. She was misdiagnosed at the beginning, and when it was corrected, it was too late. She would still be here with us today if it had been diagnosed correctly. This film was a definite hearttugger for me. Have some hankies handy. Director Mike Nichols is a genius.

665728,A7C77J4MH94B6,B00005MKKV,"Cowboy Bill ""cowboybill""","[38, 39]","**SPOILER ALERT ** -- I touch on the ending of this movie in my review.Two wonderful works are highlighted in ""Wit"" -- one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets (""Death be not proud"") and ""The Runaway Bunny"" by Margaret Wise Brown. ""Wit""'s author, Margaret Edson, pulls these two seemingly distant texts into her script and uses them in the most amazing (witty?) way.Donne's metaphysical sonnets are notoriously difficult and are often approached as beautifully wrought puzzles -- puzzles that are so intellectually daunting the emotion that underlies them is sometimes missed. ""The Runaway Bunny,"" on the other hand, is probably seen by many readers as a very simple tale full of feeling but not particularly challenging. Yet Edson shows us how deep and multilayered a children's tale can be while also demonstrating the basic human feeling underneath the most cerebral of poems. The simple becomes complex; the complex, simple.We get the most out of literature when we approach it with our full humanity engaged, ignoring neither our thoughts nor our feelings. ""Wit"" tells us that we get the most out of life when we approach it in the same way.Emma Thompson's cancer-stricken English professor, Vivian Bearing, ultimately triumphs over death by surrendering to it -- and it is this Donne-ish paradox that ""Wit"" illustrates so well. In the end, ""Wit"" wisely questions the notions 1) that intellect and emotion are two separate faculties and 2) that simplicity and complexity are necessarily opposites. (One hallmark of Donne's ""wit"" -- a term Donne's contemporaries would've understood as creative invention -- was its examination of semantic antonyms.) ""Wit"" also reminds us that the infinite can be both large and small.John Donne knew this stuff, and apparently so did Margaret Wise Brown. And, luckily for us, so does ""Wit""'s author, Margaret Edson. By the way, if you've never read the above-mentioned Donne poem, here it is:Holy Sonnet (""Death be not proud"") by John DonneDeath be not proud, though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe, / For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow, / Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee; / From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee, / Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow, / And soonest our best men with thee doe goe, / Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie. / Thou'art slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, / And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell, / And poppie,' or charmes can make us sleepe as well, / And better then they stroake; why swell'st thou then? / One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally, / And death shall be no more, Death thou shalt die.",4,Coming to grips with paradoxes,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,2690,"['**SPOILER', 'ALERT', '**', 'touch', 'ending', 'movie', 'review.Two', 'wonderful', 'works', 'are', 'highlighted', 'Wit', 'one', 'John', 'Donne', 'Holy', 'Sonnets', 'Death', 'be', 'not', 'proud', 'Runaway', 'Bunny', 'Margaret', 'Wise', 'Brown', 'Wit', 'author', 'Margaret', 'Edson', 'two', 'seemingly', 'distant', 'texts', 'script', 'most', 'amazing', 'witty', 'way.Donne', 'metaphysical', 'sonnets', 'are', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'are', 'often', 'approached', 'beautifully', 'wrought', 'puzzles', 'puzzles', 'are', 'so', 'intellectually', 'daunting', 'emotion', 'sometimes', 'missed', 'Runaway', 'Bunny', 'other', 'hand', 'probably', 'seen', 'many', 'readers', 'very', 'simple', 'tale', 'full', 'feeling', 'not', 'particularly', 'challenging', 'Edson', 'how', 'deep', 'multilayered', 'children', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'demonstrating', 'basic', 'human', 'feeling', 'most', 'cerebral', 'poems', 'simple', 'becomes', 'complex', 'complex', 'simple.We', 'get', 'most', 'literature', 'when', 'approach', 'full', 'humanity', 'engaged', 'ignoring', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'Wit', 'get', 'most', 'life', 'when', 'approach', 'same', 'way.Emma', 'Thompson', 'cancer-stricken', 'English', 'professor', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'ultimately', 'death', 'surrendering', 'Donne-ish', 'paradox', 'Wit', 'so', 'well', 'end', 'Wit', 'wisely', 'questions', 'notions', '1', 'intellect', 'emotion', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'faculties', '2', 'simplicity', 'complexity', 'are', 'necessarily', 'opposites', 'One', 'hallmark', 'Donne', 'wit', 'term', 'Donne', 'contemporaries', 'would', ""'ve"", 'understood', 'creative', 'invention', 'was', 'examination', 'semantic', 'antonyms', 'Wit', 'also', 'infinite', 'can', 'be', 'large', 'small.John', 'Donne', 'knew', 'stuff', 'apparently', 'so', 'did', 'Margaret', 'Wise', 'Brown', 'luckily', 'so', 'Wit', 'author', 'Margaret', 'Edson', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'above-mentioned', 'Donne', 'poem', 'here', 'Holy', 'Sonnet', 'Death', 'be', 'not', 'proud', 'John', 'DonneDeath', 'be', 'not', 'proud', 'have', 'called', 'thee', '/', 'Mighty', 'dreadfull', 'art', 'not', 'soe', '/', 'whom', 'thou', ""think'st"", 'thou', 'dost', 'overthrow', '/', 'Die', 'not', 'poore', 'death', 'yet', 'canst', 'thou', 'kill', 'mee', 'rest', 'sleepe', 'thy', 'pictures', 'bee', '/', 'Much', 'pleasure', 'then', 'thee', 'much', 'more', 'must', 'flow', '/', 'soonest', 'best', 'men', 'thee', 'doe', 'goe', '/', 'Rest', 'bones', 'soules', 'deliverie', '/', ""Thou'art"", 'slave', 'Fate', 'chance', 'kings', 'desperate', 'men', '/', 'dost', 'poyson', 'warre', 'sicknesse', 'dwell', '/', 'poppie', 'charmes', 'can', 'make', 'sleepe', 'as', 'well', '/', 'better', 'then', 'stroake', 'why', ""swell'st"", 'thou', 'then', '/', 'One', 'short', 'sleepe', 'past', 'wee', 'wake', 'eternally', '/', 'death', 'shall', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'Death', 'thou', 'shalt', 'die']",Wit

665731,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005MKKV,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 7]","Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,Doctor Vivian Bearing, a tough, intellectual professor specializing in 17th century literature, takes on the challenge to undergo eight months of experimental chemotherapy and a combination of drugs to battle advanced metastatic ovarian cancer, in which she is in Stage 4, a cancer for which there is no Stage 5.  She will also be studied by medical students, her illness being a significant contribution to knowledge.  To be something studied, as opposed to a human being, yes, there's the rub, to quote the Bard.  But she is a tough woman, never one to shirk a challenge.For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.Most of the story has Bearing's soliloquys, spoken to the viewer from her hospital bed, bald-headed and wearing a hospital gown, describing what she's thinking and feeling, and she does so with wit. One learns of her fascination with words, her past history as a student and academic, how she has preferred research to humanity, and her tough style of teaching, which she got from her mentor, Professor E.M. Rumford. There's a fascinating discussion between Bearing and Rumford, where the original punctuation at the end of Donne's ""Death Be Not Proud"" included a comma in the line, ""death, thou shalt die.""  In other words, a comma separates life from life everlasting.  Yet when Rumford tells her to go hang out with her students instead of going to the library Bearing goes to the library.  Later, when a young doctor, Jason, tells her how he's fascinated by cancer due to its smartness, calling it ""immortality in culture,"" it's ironic that she wishes he would be more interested in humanity rather than research.From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,As for flashbacks, there are times when we cut to a scene when she's a five year old reading a Beatrix Potter book, that she alternates between her five-year old self and as she is now, bald and in the hospital gown, symbolizing how fragile she seems despite bearing up.And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.She presents her illness in a paradox in the manner of Donne himself, when she says that with her immune system down, everything is a hazard, especially the health care professionals.  She isn't in the isolation ward because she has a grapefruit-sized tumor, but because her treatment imperils her health.  But she revels in the paradox, seeing it as an intellectual game.  But when the cancer spreads elsewhere, she begins to get frightened, realizing her intellectual abilities isn't going to help her, but that she seeks simplicity and kindness, and that makes her regret she had been sympathetic to some of her own students.  Fortunately, she finds that in Susie, the nurse, with whom she has a rapport with.Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,Juxtaposing this movie with my mother's recent battle with cancer did ring some emotional chords due to similarities.  My mother wasn't as open as Dr. Bearing in her feelings when undergoing CT Scans, ultrasounds, colonoscopies, or the IPT chemotherapy.  But she too looked for kindness and simplicity, and when a certain hospital worker wheeled her chair to a spot of sunshine on a cold day after a CT scan, my mother realized that maybe she was wrong in being too tough, and that she had hurt some people in her past.And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then;This is by far Emma Thompson's best role ever, but Audra McDonald as Susie lends strong support as the very human and compassionate nurse, who sees Bearing as a human being, not a subject for study.  Those who have just lost a dear one to cancer may find this painful going, others will find this a study of reflection one experiences when near the portals of mortality.One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.",5,"DEATH be not proud, though some have called thee",1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,4090,"['Mighty', 'dreadfull', 'art', 'not', 'so', 'Doctor', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'tough', 'intellectual', 'professor', 'specializing', '17th', 'century', 'literature', 'challenge', 'undergo', 'eight', 'months', 'experimental', 'chemotherapy', 'combination', 'drugs', 'battle', 'advanced', 'metastatic', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'Stage', '4', 'cancer', 'Stage', '5', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'studied', 'medical', 'students', 'illness', 'being', 'significant', 'contribution', 'knowledge', 'be', 'something', 'studied', 'opposed', 'human', 'being', 'yes', 'rub', 'quote', 'Bard', 'tough', 'woman', 'never', 'one', 'shirk', 'challenge.For', 'whom', 'thou', ""think'st"", 'thou', 'dost', 'overthrow', 'Die', 'not', 'poore', 'death', 'yet', 'canst', 'thou', 'kill', 'me.Most', 'story', 'Bearing', 'soliloquys', 'spoken', 'viewer', 'hospital', 'bed', 'bald-headed', 'wearing', 'hospital', 'gown', 'describing', 'what', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'so', 'wit', 'One', 'learns', 'fascination', 'words', 'past', 'history', 'student', 'academic', 'how', 'preferred', 'research', 'humanity', 'tough', 'style', 'teaching', 'got', 'mentor', 'Professor', 'E.M.', 'Rumford', 'fascinating', 'discussion', 'Bearing', 'Rumford', 'where', 'original', 'punctuation', 'end', 'Donne', 'Death', 'Be', 'Not', 'Proud', 'included', 'comma', 'line', 'death', 'thou', 'shalt', 'die', 'other', 'words', 'comma', 'life', 'life', 'everlasting', 'when', 'Rumford', 'go', 'hang', 'out', 'students', 'instead', 'going', 'library', 'Bearing', 'library', 'Later', 'when', 'young', 'doctor', 'Jason', 'how', 'fascinated', 'cancer', 'due', 'smartness', 'calling', 'immortality', 'culture', 'ironic', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'humanity', 'rather', 'research.From', 'rest', 'sleepe', 'thy', 'pictures', 'bee', 'Much', 'pleasure', 'then', 'thee', 'much', 'more', 'must', 'flow', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'cut', 'scene', 'when', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'reading', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'book', 'five-year', 'old', 'self', 'now', 'bald', 'hospital', 'gown', 'symbolizing', 'how', 'fragile', 'bearing', 'up.And', 'soonest', 'best', 'men', 'thee', 'doe', 'goe', 'Rest', 'bones', 'deliverie.She', 'presents', 'illness', 'paradox', 'manner', 'Donne', 'when', 'immune', 'system', 'down', 'everything', 'hazard', 'especially', 'health', 'care', 'professionals', ""n't"", 'isolation', 'ward', 'grapefruit-sized', 'tumor', 'treatment', 'health', 'paradox', 'seeing', 'intellectual', 'game', 'when', 'cancer', 'elsewhere', 'get', 'frightened', 'realizing', 'intellectual', 'abilities', ""n't"", 'going', 'help', 'simplicity', 'kindness', 'regret', 'had', 'been', 'sympathetic', 'own', 'students', 'Fortunately', 'Susie', 'nurse', 'whom', 'rapport', 'with.Thou', 'art', 'slave', 'Fate', 'Chance', 'kings', 'desperate', 'men', 'dost', 'poyson', 'warre', 'sicknesse', 'dwell', 'Juxtaposing', 'movie', 'mother', 'recent', 'battle', 'cancer', 'did', 'ring', 'emotional', 'chords', 'due', 'similarities', 'mother', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'open', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'feelings', 'when', 'undergoing', 'CT', 'Scans', 'ultrasounds', 'colonoscopies', 'IPT', 'chemotherapy', 'too', 'looked', 'kindness', 'simplicity', 'when', 'certain', 'hospital', 'worker', 'wheeled', 'chair', 'spot', 'sunshine', 'cold', 'day', 'CT', 'scan', 'mother', 'realized', 'maybe', 'was', 'wrong', 'being', 'too', 'tough', 'had', 'hurt', 'people', 'past.And', 'poppie', 'charmes', 'can', 'make', 'sleepe', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'then', 'thy', 'stroake', 'why', ""swell'st"", 'thou', 'then', 'far', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Susie', 'strong', 'support', 'very', 'human', 'compassionate', 'nurse', 'who', 'Bearing', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'subject', 'study', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'lost', 'dear', 'one', 'cancer', 'may', 'find', 'painful', 'going', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'study', 'reflection', 'one', 'when', 'portals', 'mortality.One', 'short', 'sleepe', 'past', 'wee', 'wake', 'eternally', 'death', 'shall', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'death', 'thou', 'shalt', 'die']",Wit

I've seen every film she's made, even the mediocre ones, and I refuse to miss a single one of her films (CARRINGTON sure wasn't very cheerful);  2) Thompson plays a professor of English who's specialty is the metaphysical poetry of John Donne.

So, I'm not going to go into &quot;the story.&quot; Just watch this brilliant, moving film about the regimented, respected but feared English professor, whose world is taken from her, when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Narrated throughout by her character, the brilliant Emma Thompson takes us through her progressive deterioration and loss of control amidst the sometimes indifference of the medical profession. Audra McDonald is wonderful also as the nurse, Susie, who, though a total professional, is not only the voice of compassion, but the keeper of Thompsons &quot;Professor Barrie's&quot; dignity, when she can no longer defend it for herself. She is a perfect contrast to the often all to real portrayal of the fresh-faced new doctor, played by Jonathan Woodward, who effectively conveys the preoccupation with stats, data, etc...in his eagerness to &quot;analyze&quot;, forgetting there's a human being in that bed to which the stat chart is attached. The scene near the end, where Thompson/Barrie is visited by her grand-motherly former professor, who proceeds to cradle her in her hospital bed and tenderly read a childrens story to her, and bids her good bye, is one of the most moving scenes I've ever experienced. It is not an easy film to watch. Having just lost my life-long friend, who died at 47, in hospice, it was especially poignant.

If your loved one dies of a terrible progressive illness, you know the experience intimately. Yet understanding may take awhile, if it ever comes. If you yourself are desperately ill, you live in a cocoon of pain, embarrassment, fear and anger. You experience this only to the degree your mental capacity remains unimpaired. Understanding your experience may be a low priority.

Her special interest is the metaphysical verse of John Donne, to which she's dedicated her scholastic life at the expense of human relationships. Now, at 48, she's diagnosed with stage-four metastatic ovarian carcinoma. There is no stage five. Her oncologist, Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd), recommends an aggressive, 8-month regimen of treatment with an experimental drug - at full dose. Because of the expected onerous side effects, he challenges Vivian to show fortitude and perseverance, and, never a slacker, she promises a stiff upper lip.Much of the film is comprised of a series of monologs by Bearing as she addresses the camera, and the audience, with reflections generated by her dry WIT about the chemotherapy's appalling toll on her person and the process by which it is being exacted. At one point, after Kelekian and a train of acolytes visit Vivian in her hospital room, a medical teaching ritual known as Grand Rounds, she wryly observes that the exercise was:""... full of subservience, hierarchies, gratuitous displays, sublimated rivalries. I feel completely at home. It is just like a graduate seminar.""WIT is a pointed indictment of the generalized insensitivity of medical caregivers to the terminally-ill patient, who comes to represent little more than a specimen cup, a form covered with scribbled observations, or, at best, a career-enhancing article in a medical journal. Jason (Jonathan Woodward) plays the shallow, research-minded physician completing a clinical fellowship under Kelekian's direction. Bearing asks what his reaction is to patients who express apprehension or fright. His clueless response: ""Of whom?""As the course of Vivian's treatment - or is it torture? - draws to its conclusion, her only source of human warmth and sympathy becomes her primary care nurse, Susie (Audra McDonald), and her only pleasure the eating of a popsicle, the lone ""food"" tolerated by a GI tract ravaged by the anti-cancer drug.One of the most heart-wrenchingly poignant scenes ever put on celluloid has to be one near the conclusion when Vivian is visited by her aged mentor E.M. Ashford (Eileen Atkins). I'm not ashamed to say that my eyes teared.WIT isn't an easy film to watch. I suspect any person undergoing cancer therapy can relate to it, and should therefore be seen by anyone providing oncology care. Viewing WIT should be absolutely mandatory in every medical and nursing school in the country.This performance by Emma Thompson is an Oscar-caliber tour de force. It's a sad commentary on the film industry and the audiences it feeds that WIT's producers had to release it as an HBO movie rather than one for the Big Screen because it would have otherwise been steamrollered at the box office by the mindless thrillers that appeal to the masses.",5,"A death, played by Emma Thompson: A tour de force",1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,2977,"['WIT', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'death', 'cancer', 'therapy', 'designed', 'cure', 'it.Emma', 'Thompson', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'Doctor', 'Philosophy', 'aloof', 'professor', '17th', 'century', 'English', 'poetry', 'special', 'interest', 'metaphysical', 'verse', 'John', 'Donne', 'dedicated', 'scholastic', 'life', 'expense', 'human', 'relationships', 'Now', '48', 'diagnosed', 'stage-four', 'metastatic', 'ovarian', 'carcinoma', 'stage', 'five', 'oncologist', 'Dr.', 'Kelekian', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'aggressive', '8-month', 'regimen', 'treatment', 'experimental', 'drug', 'full', 'dose', 'expected', 'onerous', 'side', 'effects', 'Vivian', 'show', 'fortitude', 'perseverance', 'never', 'slacker', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip.Much', 'film', 'comprised', 'series', 'monologs', 'Bearing', 'camera', 'audience', 'reflections', 'generated', 'dry', 'WIT', 'chemotherapy', 'appalling', 'toll', 'person', 'process', 'being', 'exacted', 'one', 'point', 'Kelekian', 'train', 'acolytes', 'visit', 'Vivian', 'hospital', 'room', 'medical', 'teaching', 'ritual', 'known', 'Grand', 'Rounds', 'wryly', 'observes', 'exercise', 'was', 'full', 'subservience', 'hierarchies', 'gratuitous', 'displays', 'sublimated', 'rivalries', 'feel', 'completely', 'home', 'just', 'graduate', 'seminar', 'WIT', 'pointed', 'indictment', 'generalized', 'insensitivity', 'medical', 'caregivers', 'terminally-ill', 'patient', 'who', 'represent', 'little', 'more', 'specimen', 'cup', 'form', 'covered', 'scribbled', 'observations', 'best', 'career-enhancing', 'article', 'medical', 'journal', 'Jason', 'Jonathan', 'Woodward', 'shallow', 'research-minded', 'physician', 'completing', 'clinical', 'fellowship', 'Kelekian', 'direction', 'Bearing', 'what', 'reaction', 'patients', 'who', 'express', 'apprehension', 'fright', 'clueless', 'response', 'whom', 'course', 'Vivian', 'treatment', 'torture', 'draws', 'conclusion', 'only', 'source', 'human', 'warmth', 'sympathy', 'primary', 'care', 'nurse', 'Susie', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'only', 'pleasure', 'eating', 'popsicle', 'lone', 'food', 'tolerated', 'GI', 'tract', 'ravaged', 'anti-cancer', 'drug.One', 'most', 'heart-wrenchingly', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'celluloid', 'be', 'one', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Vivian', 'visited', 'aged', 'mentor', 'E.M.', 'Ashford', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'eyes', 'teared.WIT', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'suspect', 'person', 'undergoing', 'cancer', 'therapy', 'can', 'relate', 'should', 'therefore', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'providing', 'oncology', 'care', 'Viewing', 'WIT', 'should', 'be', 'absolutely', 'mandatory', 'medical', 'nursing', 'school', 'country.This', 'performance', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Oscar-caliber', 'tour', 'force', 'sad', 'commentary', 'film', 'industry', 'audiences', 'WIT', 'producers', 'had', 'release', 'HBO', 'movie', 'rather', 'one', 'Big', 'Screen', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'steamrollered', 'box', 'office', 'mindless', 'thrillers', 'appeal', 'masses']",Wit

As she is hospitalized, she observes and analyzes her condition and the effect it is having on her life. Vivian's remarks are often funny, but as the cancer spreads through her body, she realizes that she has to reasses her life. In a heartrending scene, Vivian breaks down and says, ""I used to feel safe."" She was always a woman in control, and now that control is being savagely ripped from her by an invisible enemy. Eventually Vivian decides that when her heart stops, she does not wish to be revived: ""Why make things more complicated?""As the illness reaches its last stages, we see Vivian moaning and shaking with excrutiating pain. It is nearly unbearable to watch, but we must. The final scene, where Vivian is held like a child and read a children's story by her elderly teacher, is the most heartbreaking image ever put on film.

Specifically she has stage 4 ovarian cancer and since there is no stage 5, things are pretty ominous from the start.  Because of the death of Peter Jennings this week more Americans than before are now acutely aware that stage 4 cancer is tantamount to a death sentence.  But it has to be clear going into ""Wit"" that the main character is going to die and that chances are that she is going to die horribly.  Perhaps because she is an academic, specifically a well respected professor of 17th century poetry, Bearing agrees to be a guinea pig for Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd), a cancer researcher who is clearly more interested in generating data from persuading his patient to undergo chemotherapy treatment in which she gets the whole dosage each and every time than he is in what it will do to prolong her life.  Or maybe she just goes along with him because he is the doctor, the same way she expected her students to follow her lead.Thompson and director Mike Nichols did the teleplay, adapting Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play and what works and what does not has much to do with the fact that this was originally a stage drama.  That means that Thompson's character get to show her wit by making asides not only before and after but sometimes during the visits from the researchers (it seems wrong to call them doctors) who come by to check the raw data she is providing them.  To be fair, it is a teaching hospital, and Bearing could have gone to a hospice and received more compassionate care, so I do not want to make much of the way the film portrays doctors in general and young intern Jason Posner (Jonathan M. Woodward), who refuses to see his patient as a human being even if he once took a class from her (for the challenge of taking the three toughest classes on campus and not because he has any interest in the subject matter to which she has devoted her academic life).  The idea that doctors are idiots and nurses are compassionate but powerless is a commonplace that has been beaten to death in such films, but close behind is the brilliant and articulate person brought down by disease.Perhaps there is another reason that the lead character is a professor of literature who has neither friends nor family, but just memories and perhaps a nurse or colleague who might care as she lives out the remainder of her life.  ""Wit"" is all about Bearing's battle with cancer because there is nothing else for it to be about.  She can no longer teach and her comfort comes more from her memories of her father (Harold Pinter) and her mentor (Eileen Atkins) than is does from the drugs or soothing care of her nurse (Audra McDonald).  Besides, the witty observations and lovely recitations of poetry that define the first half of this movie are swept away by the physical deterioration and intense pain that Bearing endures, for lack of a better word, in the second half.  None of the laughs from early in the film take away from the harrowing nature of the rest of the film where the intimacy of the camera allows Thompson to be more affective than any stage performance (and which made me glad that the genetic odds say that I will more likely succumb to a heart attack than have to face cancer).  The point that science will not allow Bearing to go gently into that good night is not lost on us, but we do have to decide for ourselves what final lesson Professor Bearing has taught her former student, Jason.",4,The harrowing journey of stage 4 ovarian cancer,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,3711,"['Nobody', 'die', 'cancer', 'unknown', 'reason', 'anybody', 'who', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'fate', 'Wit', 'will', 'take', 'care', '2001', 'HBO', 'film', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'being', 'informed', 'cancer', 'Specifically', 'stage', '4', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'stage', '5', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'ominous', 'start', 'death', 'Peter', 'Jennings', 'week', 'more', 'Americans', 'are', 'now', 'acutely', 'aware', 'stage', '4', 'cancer', 'tantamount', 'death', 'sentence', 'be', 'clear', 'going', 'Wit', 'main', 'character', 'going', 'die', 'chances', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'horribly', 'Perhaps', 'academic', 'specifically', 'well', 'respected', 'professor', '17th', 'century', 'poetry', 'Bearing', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'Dr.', 'Kelekian', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'cancer', 'researcher', 'who', 'clearly', 'more', 'interested', 'generating', 'data', 'persuading', 'patient', 'undergo', 'chemotherapy', 'treatment', 'whole', 'dosage', 'time', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'prolong', 'life', 'maybe', 'just', 'along', 'doctor', 'same', 'way', 'expected', 'students', 'follow', 'lead.Thompson', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'did', 'teleplay', 'adapting', 'Margaret', 'Edson', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'play', 'what', 'what', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'stage', 'drama', 'Thompson', 'character', 'get', 'show', 'wit', 'making', 'asides', 'not', 'only', 'before', 'sometimes', 'visits', 'researchers', 'wrong', 'call', 'doctors', 'who', 'come', 'check', 'raw', 'data', 'providing', 'be', 'fair', 'teaching', 'hospital', 'Bearing', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'hospice', 'received', 'more', 'compassionate', 'care', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'make', 'much', 'way', 'film', 'doctors', 'general', 'young', 'intern', 'Jason', 'Posner', 'Jonathan', 'M.', 'Woodward', 'who', 'see', 'patient', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'once', 'took', 'class', 'challenge', 'taking', 'three', 'toughest', 'classes', 'campus', 'not', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'devoted', 'academic', 'life', 'idea', 'doctors', 'are', 'idiots', 'nurses', 'are', 'compassionate', 'powerless', 'commonplace', 'been', 'beaten', 'death', 'such', 'films', 'close', 'brilliant', 'articulate', 'person', 'brought', 'down', 'disease.Perhaps', 'reason', 'lead', 'character', 'professor', 'literature', 'who', 'friends', 'family', 'just', 'memories', 'perhaps', 'nurse', 'colleague', 'who', 'might', 'care', 'out', 'remainder', 'life', 'Wit', 'Bearing', 'battle', 'cancer', 'nothing', 'else', 'be', 'about', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'teach', 'comfort', 'more', 'memories', 'father', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'mentor', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'drugs', 'soothing', 'care', 'nurse', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'witty', 'observations', 'lovely', 'recitations', 'poetry', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'physical', 'deterioration', 'intense', 'pain', 'Bearing', 'endures', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'second', 'half', 'None', 'laughs', 'early', 'film', 'take', 'away', 'harrowing', 'nature', 'rest', 'film', 'where', 'intimacy', 'camera', 'Thompson', 'be', 'more', 'affective', 'stage', 'performance', 'made', 'glad', 'genetic', 'odds', 'say', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'succumb', 'heart', 'attack', 'have', 'face', 'cancer', 'point', 'science', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'Bearing', 'go', 'gently', 'good', 'night', 'not', 'lost', 'do', 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'final', 'lesson', 'Professor', 'Bearing', 'taught', 'former', 'student', 'Jason']",Wit
665754,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005MKKV,Lawyeraau,"[172, 179]","This brilliant adaptation of Margaret Edison's Pulitzer Prize winning play is simply superb. Beautifully directed by Mike Nichols, it is peppered with superlative performances by its cast. It is almost hard to believe that this profoundly moving and poignant film was released for HBO, rather than as a major box office, big screen release.Tautly written, this remarkable film focuses on an intense and brilliant professor of English, forty-eight year old Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson), whose academic focus has been metaphysical poetry. She has just been diagnosed by a noted oncologist, Dr. Kelikian (Christopher Lloyd), as having stage four ovarian cancer. She agrees to undergo an eight month long clinical trial to fight this illness, which at the juncture of its discovery is, invariably, terminal. This course of experimental treatment is Professor Bearing's only hope, as she realizes that there is no stage five.As she undergoes agonizing medical procedures which, it is hoped, may save her life, Professor Bearing muses on a number of life issues in the form of droll monologues. It is these reflections on her life and her illness that drive home to the viewer her humanity, as she struggles to reconcile the abstract with reality. An aloof, spare woman, with a penchant for being a demanding and exacting teacher, Professor Bearing is now  trying to hang on to her humanity and dignity, as she is reduced to being a mere lump of flesh.Made to suffer the indignities imposed by an experimental medical treatment that is brutally aggressive and by the ravages of an illness that is relentless, Professor Bearing keeps a stiff upper lip throughout, never letting down her guard, until the end draws near. During her medical odyssey, she is buoyed by the ministrations of her compassionate, primary care nurse, Susie (Audra McDonald), who seems to be the only member of the medical staff interested in her as a person, rather than as just another cog in the world of medical research. Susie is a perfect foil to the ambitious medical treatment fostered by a callow, though brilliant, young doctor, Jason Posner (Jonathan M. Woodward).The most singular scene in this film, however, occurs near its end. It is the scene in which Professor Bearing's mentor, Professor E.M. Ashford (Eileen Atkins), visits her one time protege at the hospital. Heartrending, poignant, and infinitely beautiful, it is a scene so richly drawn that it that will haunt the viewer long after the film is over.Ms. Thompson gives a consummate, beautifully nuanced performance, as does Eileen Atkins. Audra McDonald gives a tender performance, and Christopher Lloyd and Jonathan M. Woodward are, likewise, excellent in their respective roles. Harold Pinter does a wonderful, though brief, turn as Professor Bearing's father. All in all, this is a deftly directed, outstanding film with award caliber performances by the entire cast.

665755,A3IORCOGSJW1QA,B00005MKKV,Lee Haskell,"[5, 5]","Before this movie, I never ""got"" poetry.  I like simple, face-value things.  I like movies like Rush Hour 2, The Terminator and Rambo but also enjoy Sense and Sensibility too.  However, I was furious for the first 5 mins of this movie.  I thought I was watching a preachy movie about the degrading trials and humiliations a person trying to treat ovarian cancer has to go through.  But I could not have been more wrong.That was just the first layer and like an onion, this movie has many layers.  It is as deep and as shallow as the viewer wants it to be.  Vivian's (Emma Thompson) voice-over gave me goose bumps.  One of my favorite lines is ""It has always been my custom to treat words with respect"".  And she accomplishes that in this movie.  No wonder this play won a Pulitzer prize.Even when Vivian's old professor reads THE RUNAWAY BUNNY to Vivian, there was something to learn there.  She calls the book, ""A little allegory of the soul.""  My God, what a way she has with words.  And this movie is full of those profound little sayings all through out.But Emma's full recital of one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets at the end really got to me.  I had to rewind towards the beginning of the movie to when Vivian first met her Professor who explained ""the Sonnet begins with the valient struggle with death.  Calling on all the forces of intellect and drama to vanquish the enemy.  But it is ultimately about overcoming the seemingly insuperable barrier separating life, death and eternal life.""  I could say the same about the meaning of this movie.Another layer to this movie is about the lesson taught to an unfeeling but the-best-in-her-field professor who showed no mercy to her students and then finds herself at the mercy of the hospital staff who only sees her as another nameless patient to be prodded and poked and to be asked as an afterthought by the cold but highly intellectual Doctor how the patient is feeling when the patient is sitting there vomiting.  It starts dawning on Vivian that just being a scholar does not a good Doctor (or a good Professor) make.When she finally admits that being extremely smart was not enough and that now she saw the value of kindness, I saw (me, the one who doesn't ""get"" deep stuff) how it all tied in with the sonnet because not even intellect can keep the person out of deaths grasp.  Is that deep or what.To me, this movie was like those ""for Dummies"" books.  Poetry appreciation for Dummies 101.  But it also reminds us all that a little kindness goes a long way and being intellectually vain is vanity all the same.

Emma Thompson gives us a flawless performance, so many of us had a teacher or professor just like her, and never loses her dignity (perhaps that's the tragedy, right there) while she suffers the endless indignities of her experimental cancer treatment. The Professor is witty, gratifyingly so, and bereft, embarrassingly so, of any personal life to prop her up during the last scenes of her life.Enter Eileen Atkins' character. The Professor's former mentor, a woman so terrifyingly brilliant and yet so completely rooted to the ground, who feels the need earlier in their years together to advise the young Professor to go out and have some fun. We suspect that the Professor does not heed this very good advice.For me, Eileen Atkins performance stole the entire show. Emma Thompson was flawless, but shackled by her character's sang-froid, where Eileen Atkins was gifted with the best of both worlds--the academic and the family.Beware, this is a very difficult film to digest.

And Mike Nichols is a fine director.That said, this movie simply lacked something.  There were poignant moments and rich depth of emotion and acting.  And, yes, Emma Thompson was superb at moments throughout the movie.  But I find myself in the unenviable position of criticizing someone's account of devastating disease.  Yet if I'm going to be honest, criticize I must.I think what the movie lacked was pace (OK, let's leave any jokes about slow as death behind us right here!).  It was slow - too slow - to the point where I found myself uncertain whether I identified with Thompson's character's pain or simply the movie's painfully slow march toward debilitation and death.  And there you find yourself caught between wishing things would move faster and realizing that faster meant the demise of the character depicted before you.I know it's difficult to convert a stage play to the big screen (probably why they released this as an HBO flick - to avoid the big screen) and the result often falls into one of three categories - slow, slower, or slowest...

665764,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005MKKV,Mike Stone,"[17, 19]","Visually, &quot;Wit&quot; is a stunner.  Shot in high contrast (by ace cinematographer Seams McGarvey), every detail in the camera's frame is perfectly presented, and nothing is hidden from the viewer.  Every fold and wrinkle and twinkle in Emma Thompson's face is laid bare for all to see.  The halls of the hospital are spic-and-span clean, sleek and sterile to the point of being heavenly.  But they have nothing to do with heaven, really.  In fact, the setting is more like a ghostly purgatory, where one woman is caught between life and death.That one woman is Dr. Vivian Bearing, a professor of literature specializing in the enigmatic poems of John Donne, and recently diagnosed cancer patient.  In her civilian life she was a contentious, stubborn, and demanding teacher.  As a patient she's reflective, intelligent, emotionally repressed, and, of course, witty.  I can't imagine another actress pulling off all of these qualities more readily than Emma Thompson.  Her English properness combined with her easy drollness fit perfectly into the role.  She is able to play the role's 'wit' without batting an eye.  What I didn't expect from her was an intense emotionality.  Thompson can, at times, be too cold and too calculating in her acting.  But in my favourite of her roles (&quot;The Tall Guy&quot;, &quot;In The Name of the Father&quot;, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;) her passion valiantly fights through the cold veneer.  Such is the case here.  Thompson's Dr. Bearing begins the film as a cynical scholar, but she slowly sheds that persona, eventually exposing her emotions like a gaping wound.  And it's not just a persona change that she undergoes; she is ravaged physically as well.  In the beginning, Thompson sports an elegant head of black hair, speckled with distinguished grey.  Her eyes are alive with fire and her face is rubbery and expressive like only Emma can be.  But as her chemotherapy progresses, she loses that head of hair, her eyebrows and eyelashes.  And she becomes gaunt and sickly.  The film has done the impossible: it has sapped Emma Thompson of all her strength and vitality, and boy is that a heartbreaking effect.The rest of the cast is distinguished, but pales in comparison next to Thompson's perfect performance.  They're all insignificant satellites revolving around her Jupiter.  Christopher Lloyd as her doctor, Jonathan M. Woodward as his ambitious student (and, in a malicious twist, a former student of Dr. Bearing's; this fact becomes quite embarrassing for her during a routine pelvic exam, that has both the patient and the young doctor cringing in discomfort), and Audra McDonald as a dim but well-meaning and overly protective nurse, all do fine, understated work.  They are the recipients of Dr. Bearing's pointed barbs, for she feels used and abused as they treat her more as an object to be studied rather than a person to be cured.  The power of 'Wit', however, the thing that elevates it above other patient-vs.-ambitious-doctor films, is that in a way this is turnabout as fair play.  For the most part we sympathize with Vivian; how can these educated doctors have such poor bedside manner?  But in a quick flashback, we see Dr. Bearing, the professor, with little sympathy for a student asking for an extension.  She is cold-hearted in her pursuit of creating perfect scholars, just as her doctors are cold-hearted in using her as a research tool.  She used to be the one ruthlessly deconstructing the text; now, she is the text.  She used to be the one discussing death in very theoretical terms; now death is staring her in the face, and her scholarly instincts are of no help to her.  It's a fascinating dramatic predicament.Director Mike Nichols (who, with Thompson, co-adapted Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play) composes his film of a series of long, static shots.  He gets a lot of mileage out of allowing the camera to focus on Thompson's face, until the audience can't take the sight of this formerly beautiful now hideously ravaged woman staring back at them.  It can get uncomfortable at times, but that's what makes the film terribly moving.  And his use of flashbacks, going back and forth through time several times in the same scene, is used judiciously and effectively.  One of the film's most touching moment has Dr. Bearing recalling the moment when she fell in love with words, reading Beatrix Potter books in her father's study (while being coaxed gently on by her father, played by playwright Harold Pinter).  Bearing at age six is suddenly replaced by Thompson's Bearing, acting like six, but dressed in her hospital garb and bald head.  Nichols never lets these moments become maudlin, and thus they are surprisingly effective.Oh good lord, this is a touching movie.  It spares you nothing, and if you're up for the challenge, you'll be thankful for its trust.",5,Publish *and* Perish,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,4873,"['Visually', 'quot', 'Wit', 'quot', 'stunner', 'Shot', 'high', 'contrast', 'ace', 'cinematographer', 'Seams', 'McGarvey', 'detail', 'camera', 'frame', 'perfectly', 'presented', 'nothing', 'hidden', 'viewer', 'Every', 'fold', 'wrinkle', 'twinkle', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'face', 'laid', 'bare', 'see', 'halls', 'hospital', 'are', 'spic-and-span', 'clean', 'sleek', 'sterile', 'point', 'being', 'heavenly', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'heaven', 'really', 'fact', 'setting', 'more', 'ghostly', 'purgatory', 'where', 'one', 'woman', 'caught', 'life', 'death.That', 'one', 'woman', 'Dr.', 'Vivian', 'Bearing', 'professor', 'literature', 'specializing', 'enigmatic', 'poems', 'John', 'Donne', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'patient', 'civilian', 'life', 'was', 'contentious', 'stubborn', 'demanding', 'teacher', 'patient', 'reflective', 'intelligent', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'course', 'witty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'actress', 'pulling', 'off', 'qualities', 'more', 'readily', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'English', 'properness', 'combined', 'easy', 'drollness', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'role', 'able', 'play', 'role', ""'wit"", 'batting', 'eye', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'intense', 'emotionality', 'Thompson', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'too', 'cold', 'too', 'calculating', 'acting', 'favourite', 'roles', 'quot', 'Tall', 'Guy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Name', 'Father', 'quot', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'passion', 'valiantly', 'cold', 'veneer', 'Such', 'case', 'here', 'Thompson', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'film', 'cynical', 'scholar', 'slowly', 'persona', 'eventually', 'exposing', 'emotions', 'gaping', 'wound', 'not', 'just', 'persona', 'change', 'ravaged', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'beginning', 'Thompson', 'sports', 'elegant', 'head', 'black', 'hair', 'speckled', 'distinguished', 'grey', 'eyes', 'are', 'alive', 'fire', 'face', 'rubbery', 'expressive', 'only', 'Emma', 'can', 'be', 'chemotherapy', 'head', 'hair', 'eyebrows', 'eyelashes', 'gaunt', 'sickly', 'film', 'done', 'impossible', 'sapped', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'strength', 'vitality', 'boy', 'heartbreaking', 'effect.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'distinguished', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Thompson', 'perfect', 'performance', ""'re"", 'insignificant', 'satellites', 'revolving', 'Jupiter', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'doctor', 'Jonathan', 'M.', 'Woodward', 'ambitious', 'student', 'malicious', 'twist', 'former', 'student', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'fact', 'quite', 'embarrassing', 'routine', 'pelvic', 'exam', 'patient', 'young', 'doctor', 'cringing', 'discomfort', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'dim', 'well-meaning', 'overly', 'protective', 'nurse', 'do', 'fine', 'understated', 'work', 'are', 'recipients', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'pointed', 'barbs', 'feels', 'used', 'abused', 'treat', 'more', 'object', 'be', 'studied', 'rather', 'person', 'be', 'cured', 'power', ""'Wit"", 'however', 'thing', 'other', 'patient-vs.-ambitious-doctor', 'films', 'way', 'turnabout', 'fair', 'play', 'most', 'part', 'sympathize', 'Vivian', 'how', 'can', 'educated', 'doctors', 'have', 'such', 'poor', 'bedside', 'manner', 'quick', 'flashback', 'see', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'professor', 'little', 'sympathy', 'student', 'asking', 'extension', 'cold-hearted', 'pursuit', 'creating', 'perfect', 'scholars', 'just', 'doctors', 'are', 'cold-hearted', 'using', 'research', 'tool', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'ruthlessly', 'deconstructing', 'text', 'now', 'text', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'discussing', 'death', 'very', 'theoretical', 'terms', 'now', 'death', 'staring', 'face', 'scholarly', 'instincts', 'are', 'help', 'fascinating', 'dramatic', 'predicament.Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'who', 'Thompson', 'co-adapted', 'Margaret', 'Edson', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'series', 'long', 'static', 'shots', 'lot', 'mileage', 'allowing', 'camera', 'focus', 'Thompson', 'face', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'sight', 'formerly', 'beautiful', 'now', 'hideously', 'ravaged', 'woman', 'staring', 'back', 'can', 'get', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'what', 'film', 'terribly', 'moving', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'several', 'times', 'same', 'scene', 'used', 'judiciously', 'effectively', 'One', 'film', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'Dr', 'Bearing', 'recalling', 'moment', 'when', 'fell', 'love', 'words', 'reading', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'books', 'father', 'study', 'being', 'coaxed', 'gently', 'father', 'played', 'playwright', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'Bearing', 'age', 'six', 'suddenly', 'replaced', 'Thompson', 'Bearing', 'acting', 'six', 'dressed', 'hospital', 'garb', 'bald', 'head', 'Nichols', 'never', 'moments', 'become', 'maudlin', 'thus', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'effective.Oh', 'good', 'lord', 'touching', 'movie', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'up', 'challenge', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thankful', 'trust']",Wit

The supporting cast is excellent. Eileen Atkins, as Thompson's teacher, will bring tears to the hardest heart in what has to be one of the most moving scenes in all of film-dom.

But this time out she lays her soul bare for all to see in this painful portrait of a woman hospitalized with ovarian cancer who agrees to undergo a tormenting 8 month chemotherapy treatment. Her performance is an honest, realistic and brilliant tribute to those suffering from such a tragic disease. A great but rather depressing story. This performance is the sort that certainly must be both challenging and horribly painful to experience. It's not a very gratifying subject to begin with, but this character is played so honestly and beautifully by Emma that one can't help but admire her courage for her willingness to take on such a difficult role. I have admired her as an actress ever since seeing her as a determined attorney in 'In the name of the father', but never before has she laid her soul so bare as she does here. She seems to accept the reality of her illness rather well compared to how some would react. And she constantly tried to find something positive or even humorous in even the most degrading moments. Her outlook is realistic and at the same time she remains optimistic to some degree. But as time passes her feelings of isolation, worry and fear become impossible to contain, as does her pain. This is a painful thing to experience as an audience member, and Emma Thompson delivers an unforgettable performance I will not soon forget.",5,The prospect of death can be a very enlightening thing,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1404,"['Emma', 'Thompson', 'never', 'amaze', 'time', 'out', 'soul', 'bare', 'see', 'painful', 'portrait', 'woman', 'hospitalized', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'who', 'undergo', 'tormenting', '8', 'month', 'chemotherapy', 'treatment', 'performance', 'honest', 'realistic', 'brilliant', 'tribute', 'suffering', 'such', 'tragic', 'disease', 'great', 'rather', 'depressing', 'story', 'performance', 'sort', 'certainly', 'must', 'be', 'challenging', 'horribly', 'painful', 'experience', 'not', 'very', 'gratifying', 'subject', 'begin', 'character', 'played', 'so', 'honestly', 'beautifully', 'Emma', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'courage', 'willingness', 'take', 'difficult', 'role', 'have', 'admired', 'actress', 'ever', 'seeing', 'determined', 'attorney', 'name', 'father', 'never', 'before', 'laid', 'soul', 'so', 'bare', 'here', 'accept', 'reality', 'illness', 'rather', 'well', 'compared', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'constantly', 'tried', 'find', 'something', 'positive', 'even', 'humorous', 'even', 'most', 'degrading', 'moments', 'outlook', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'optimistic', 'degree', 'time', 'feelings', 'isolation', 'worry', 'fear', 'become', 'impossible', 'contain', 'pain', 'painful', 'thing', 'experience', 'audience', 'member', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",Wit

665778,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005MKKV,Reviewer,"[7, 7]","First of all, be advised, this is a tough film to watch; but also know that if you choose to do so, you will be rewarded with an experience that is invaluable and unforgettable, and in ways that transcend mere cinematic satisfaction.  There is no mystery here, no secrets nor allegories.  Indeed, the subject matter is made succinctly evident in the first words you hear, spoken by Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd) to Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson):  ""You have cancer.""  And so begins ""Wit,"" directed by Mike Nichols, a film that will claim you emotionally and take you to a place of eternal night-- a region, in fact, wherein even the most intrepid of body and spirit fear to tread.  It puts you in a dark room with that thing in the closet and keeps you there; and there is no way out.  And once inside, it forces you to face your worst fears, albeit vicariously, in a way that invites some serious reflection upon mortality and the profundity of life.Vivian Bearing is a professor of English Literature, specializing in the work of Seventeenth Century poet John Donne.  Hers is a scholarly life, and she is secure with her place in it; not yet fifty, she has achieved a level of comfort with herself, as well as her work, especially in the class she teaches on Donne.  With her students she is a demanding taskmaster and does not suffer fools, nor students who opt for more immediate pleasures over Donne, refusing to accept youthful zeal as an excuse for academic impropriety.  In her classroom, she insists that those in attendance rise to her level; she does not stoop to conquer.Then, with the words of Dr. Kelekian, her world abruptly changes.  At first, wrapped in intellectual armor, she finds at least some comfort and respite in her beloved Donne, but she soon finds that the pursuits of the mind, even leavened with a healthy ego, attain a diminished capacity within the environs of a ravaging disease.  The eternity of the hospital affords her much time for reflection, and as her illness progresses she undergoes a change in perspectives; taking stock, she considers such things as the aloof manner she affected that served no purpose other than to distance her from her students.  And she thinks about it now, not with regret, but differently; her intellectual acumen no longer separates her from her students, nor affords her a lofty perch from which she may sit in judgment.  She understands, at last, that she is not so different from them after all.  For as she discovers to her considerable dismay-- pain is the great equalizer.Written by Nichols and Thompson, the screenplay is based on the play by Margaret Edson.  The story unfolds like a living diary, as Vivian addresses the viewer directly, with a descriptive narrative that leaves little to the imagination.  Graphically real and unrelenting, it is a riveting chronicle that will hold you in thrall from beginning to end and beyond-- because this experience does not end when the screen goes dark; it's something that is going to be with you for a long time afterwards, so be prepared.  And the reason this will linger in your memory is that it's a contemplation of a reality that is horrendous beyond imagination.  This is that thing that always happens to someone else, but never to ""me,"" and to be put in the room with someone to whom the unthinkable has happened-- to be up close and personal with it-- is emotionally devastating.  This is a true horror story beyond anything Stephen King could write, because this is ""real.""  What happens to Vivian Bearing is something that happens to people all the time, and there has never been a film before or since that will put you more in touch with what it feels like, from the incredulity born at the moment of diagnosis to the acceptance of the reality of it.  And it has nothing to do with courage; it is not about that at all.  It's about knowing that you are going to have to do this thing that you least in the whole world want to do-- and that you have no choice in the matter.This film is a veritable showcase for the incredible talent of Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is so remarkable there are not enough superlatives to do it justice.  Ineligible for Oscar consideration as this film was made for television (HBO), her performance nevertheless is as Oscar worthy as they come (even more impressive than her Oscar winning performance as Margaret in ""Howard's End,"" which was nothing less than a study in perfection).  As Vivian Bearing, Thompson is absolutely mesmerizing-- you simply cannot take your eyes off of her for even a moment.  There are times when you want to look away, to avert your eyes because it's just too painful to watch, but you can't.  Once you begin this journey you are bound to her for better or worse.  You suffer with her through the physical pain, as well as through the base indignities to which she is subjected as a matter of course by the doctors and care givers who simply do not respond to the humanity of the person in their care; a sad commentary, to be sure, but so true.What really marks Thompson's performance as so extraordinary, however, is the fact that as you watch the drama unfold, you forget this is an actor playing a role; rather, this is a very real person you are watching-- a person named Vivian Bearing who is dying of cancer.The supporting cast includes Eileen Atkins (E.M. Ashford), Audra McDonald (Susie), Jonathan M. Woodward (Jason) and Harold Pinter (Vivian's Father).  An emotionally absorbing drama that redefines empathy and compassion, ""Wit"" will make you feel alive like never before, and thankful for each and every day that you wake up healthy.  It's a film that will enrich your life.",5,A Rewarding Experience,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,5699,"['First', 'be', 'advised', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', 'also', 'know', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'will',

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[11, 14]","all we ever really needed to learn was written in the children's books we read when we were young.soporificmaking you sleepy. as in, this movie is not soporific but rather is stimulating and tearful.The movie is bracketed chronologically by two events.The first, is when she decides to love words, to revel in them, to be constantly surprised by them.As a young girl reading a child's book about rabbits, her father teaches her the word-soporific.And the touching moment, shortly before her death, where her literature PhD mentor reads another children's book about rabbits. (i was disappointed when she didn't leave the book on the table as she left) The old prof knew the meaning of the words, for she offers to recite Donne but wisely ends up reading about rabbits, running from God, and transmogrification.The movie has many levels to instruct us. but i'm interested in the one about words, their meanings and how we share those meanings with those around us.For she learns, well, the lessons of literature. she knows all the right words about the metaphysical poetry of John Donne ( i spent more time online reading Donne, then the length of the movie, having stopped it everytime she quotes him and reading the whole work) but she really doesn't know the meaning until she dies by inches as an experimental research patient for a chemotherapy for metastised ovarian cancer.She knew the word-soporific from childhood, but it took the humiliating experience in the hospital to teach her what restful, dreamless, needful sleep was.she knew what it meant to be a difficult and demanding professor, but her course was described as less poetical than biochemistry as the young really bright doctor inserts a cathater. She learns, a teaches us, in part, the difference between knowing the meaning of a word and experiencing the word in your soul.Ever the teacher and prof to the end, her monologues directed to the watcher, share what she is learning as she is dying. Sharing her humiliation, her powerlessness, her vulnerability, by stages, the move slowly pulls you into her dying and involves you as her life never involved anyone. For she lived and died, really alone, only the one visit from her mentor in more than 8 months. But she recited her poetry, she quotes Donne through the pain and the haze of the medication, and she really learns the meaning of his words about death and dying and commas.Commas, pause, just a small breath. Just a short life. It starts with a flashback scene with her mentor and her as a young bright (lots of bright alienated people, actually everyone but the nurse is, bright and not very human, not very caring, not sympathetic to the travails around them, many of which they cause) and a discussion of a comma. The point is that words and punctuation matter, but what matters more is the meaning, the significance, how things really fits together after all the mediocre is burned away.  And that is the great strength of this movie, the details (i left all the lights on) that we use to fill our lives to overflowing, to soporific ourselves from others and from our own souls, is stripped away, like her hair, her dignity in a rough pelvic exam, and in death as her breasts are exposed and people fight over the meaning of DNR(not even a word but merely an acronym, a collection of letters, not even dignified with a vowel so that people pronounce it rather than just list the letters).Emma T. is simply wonderful, she captures the part, and drives the pathos home with just a single tear, or an infectious laugh, or a feeble tug to cover herself. the power and intensity of the movie owes much to her abilities, as much as the movie pulls you into her world and her last days of thought, it also ought to ask questions not only about the matter and indignity of her death, but more about how such a bright, hard working women missed so much of the meaning of Donne.Mechanism, clockwork instruments, literature as analysis of technic or words as sounds. What is missing is the deeper, more human, more soulish, more spirit level. Her mentor got it, maybe it can just come with age. Which reminds me that we really live our lives backwards. We ought to start out old and infirmed and dependent and get younger and more vigorous with time. Youth is wasted on the young, they don't get it, and when some of them do, it is often too late to do anything about the direction of your life. But like WIT said, he was so young, so immature, it was no wonder that he didn't understand. But those few geniuses, those who tower above our common lot, like Donne, ought to have such a place of honor in our society that young people do hear what they had to say. But as a prof, Emma T's character, despite the intensity and accuracy of her classes, did not challenge the spiritual condition of her students, any more than Donne challenged her own spiritual journey. Like the doctors who ""treated"" her, she was a technican, only with words rather than with drugs or a scapel, but the effect is the same, both on the doer and the one done to--impersonalization, technic raised high above goals, lostness and concentration on the little things, inhumanity and neglect of the spiritual dimension. In this way, she was just like them, just in a different field. she treated her student's pretty much like the doctors treated her, one more step to the next paper, another paycheck, another acronymn after your name. This is the real shame of the movie, a culture of instrumentality, of means, subplants and substitutes it's own goals for human goals of development and beings and understanding. Not just in the hospital, but in the university and by extension everywhere.I like to think that this is the big picture of the movie, something we all ought to get, and sooner than our last days.Perhaps reading more John Donne will help, as long as we don't concentrate on the sounds of words, but on the meaning and what he really wanted us to hear and take to heart.""O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?""""No man is an island.  entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were;  any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

There is no 5th stage, as she wryly observes. Dr. Vivian Bearing (brilliantly played by Emma Thompson) has spent her life studying the poetry of John Donne, to great scholarly acclaim. Yet in the final chapter of her life, she finds that she has never really engaged the poetry that has been her life's work. Until now, that is.One would think that such a subject matter would be utterly depressing. Yet, it is oddly full of hope. And that is the genius of the film.Donne's poetry is overtly referred to throughout the film. Yet in the scenes in which Bearing recalls her lectures on the subject, one learns little about the poetry. Donne's attempt to grapple with death is discussed in a superficial way by the characters. But the film's deeper meaning comes directly from Donne's writing.Dr. Bearing has lived her life as woman who uses her intellectual prowess to avoid meaningful connections with people. As a result, she undergoes her long and painful illness with no companionship. Donne's famous line that ""no man is an island"" comes immediately to mind. When one turns to the meditation which is its source, one finds the following:""When one Man dies, one Chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every Chapter must be so translated; God employs several translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice, but God's hand is in every translation; and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again, for that Library where every book shall lie open to one another.""Wit is about Bearing's ""translation."" She has worn the mask of intellectual self-sufficiency for her whole life. In her illness, every shred of her self-dignity is stripped away. She loses her hair; she is treated as an object by the medical system; she suffers pain; and finally she confronts her death. The beauty of the film is that by the end, she has lost everything that she thought mattered to her - only to find that it doesn't matter at all. In losing her self-dignity, she has found the genuine dignity that belongs to us all by virtue of our humanity. Her death is not empty suffering, but rather a fitting conclusion to her life - as she finally absorbs the meaning of the poetry that has been her life's work.We come to care deeply for a woman who is not very likeable. In doing so, we come to see the connection that we all share as human beings.Wit is an extraordinary film.

This movie only comes out when I particularly want to cry a lot.  If you are already familiar with the movie, and want to read my opions of the DVD as a whole, you can skip to the end of the review, otherwise, read on.To start, you should definitely see the stage production, which is profoundly powerful.  However, Emma Thompson gives us a better performance than probably anyone we could hope to see as Vivian.  I went through a brief period several years ago wherein I looked for all of the major-name sad movies, because I wanted some really good catharsis (this resulted in a purchase of Beaches [which I don't enjoy] Steel Magnolias [which I do enjoy, but still no tears] and sundry other movies).  Most of the time, the heartwrenching effects of a movie wear off after the first viewing, but even after multiple viewings, I end up bawling like nobody's business.Edson's play is definitely something to read, and this is a fantastically faithful screenplay.  The makers of this film knew what they were doing.  In addition to Emma, Audra McDonald turns in a fantastic performance.  She doesn't need to sing to keep you watching.  However, despite a top notch supporting cast, Ms. Thompson truly is what helps this film soar.Take note that this movie has a solid 5 stars.  This movie embodies the disturbing scene toward the end when the resident, Jason Posner, discusses cancer as an &quot;awesome&quot; force.  If you don't want to admit it, this movie proves that cancer truly is awesome, even if its only in a technical sense, and not at all in a colloquial sense.  The journey of this independent woman from hard-willed educator to a woman who is dependent  on everyone is awful to watch.  Its captivating at the same time.  No scene is as painful and beautiful to watch as when Vivian's elderly Professor (E.M. Ashford) cradles next to her to read The Runaway Bunny.  In fact, I am completely overcome just thinking about the scene.I can't avoid it, anytime I talk about a DVD, I have to talk about the DVD itself.  I have grown so accustomed to extra features, that I look at every DVD with regards to features.  This one has none whatsoever, except for really good Actor bios.  In fact, this DVD has some of the best actor bios that I have seen on a DVD.  But that's all it has, there are no special features.  Of course, it doesn't require special features.

665796,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005MKKV,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I had put off watching ""Wit"" as I wasn't sure how I could get through a movie devoted entirely to one person suffering through cancer until her ultimate demise. Well, I finally watched it and I must say - it's hard to sit through this emotionally-searing movie, yet it does get many points across.The multi-talented Emma Thompson [who also co-wrote the screenplay] plays English Literature Professor Vivian who is diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian cancer and is persuaded by her doctor [Christopher Lloyd] to undertake an experimental therapy with maximum dosage drugs. The viewer is then taken along on Vivian's journey through the world of cancer treatment - when we next see her [after her diagnosis], Vivian is bald and so we understand she has already undergone chemotherapy - she then takes us via flashbacks to her initial treatment, tests and so on before proceeding to the present.The dialogue, especially when Vivian is talking to us is filled with wit [just as the title implies] as she helps us understand her pain, frustrations and fear - but it is also a searing indictment of the clinical and callous manner in which many members of the medical establishment treat patients - the lab technician who leaves Vivian waiting in an uncomfortable chair as he goes out on his break, the former student turned doctor who leaves Vivian strapped on a gynaecological examination table as he looks around for a female assistant, the indifferent and impersonal doctor etc - these people are so devoid of human warmth and treat their patient as though they were just a specimen and not a person. My own experiences with some members of the medical establishment bears this out, though I have come across some pleasant nurses and the nurse who forms a bond with Vivian here, Susie [Audra McDonald] embodies those that truly do nurse the body and soul of their patients.""Wit"" is an absolute tearjerker and many parts had me cringing, yet it is compelling, insightful and poignant. There are two memorable scenes in this movie that have stayed with me - one in which Nurse Susie brings Vivian popsicles and sits down to share it with her whilst speaking about an important subject, and the most poignant is when Vivian's former professor comes to visit and climbs into bed [Vivian is on her deathbed] with Vivian and just holds her whilst reading ""The Runaway Bunny"" by Margaret Wise Brown.

In Wit, both the character, Vivian Bearing, and the actress, Emma Thompson, have this rare brand of courage. In an age when our female stars in the entertainment industry tend more and more towards cosmetic fluff, Thompson restores my faith in the woman of quality. She has... wit. She has intelligence, she has class, she has style. Her dedication to her art is supreme; in this film she abandons ego so completely in her portrayal of a woman dying, that I had to bow my head in admiration and respect.  Cued by her character's devotion to a life of the mind, I followed the greater part of the movie in a state of intellectual fascination... until at last, as she wore down, so did I. Just as she would have me. As wit alone could not save her, nor could it save me, the viewer, from the sheer, naked terror and pain of the process of dying, of death. By finish, I felt ripped open, exposed, brutalized into feeling, into understanding how secluded we become from ourselves and from others when we isolate any part of our humanness. We are not to be intellect alone, however superior. We are not to be spirit alone, not body alone, but we are to be whole, even as we are in the process, no, most of all when we are in the process... of being broken down.Wit is filmed sparingly and beautifully. There is no excess. The focus is clear and it is never anywhere but where it should be; every detail is in place for a purpose. John Donne's poetry is the perfect encasement to this story of life and death - and the metaphor of life as a comma, a pause, a mere breath away from death, is sharp and true. No less perfect - Margaret Wise Brown's ""The Runaway Bunny."" Run, if you will, but your humanity will finally find you.The best movie I have ever viewed? Can it be? To date - it is. And Thompson's performance, even as I wince to downgrade it by calling it a ""performance,"" even as I wince at such superlatives, is the most impressive I have ever seen.
