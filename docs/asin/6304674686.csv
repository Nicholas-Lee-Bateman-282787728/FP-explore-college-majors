430819,A2SK2FGOTKYGQC,6304674686,"""-50_caliba-""","[2, 3]","In addition to a friend recommending this to me, I also saw the trailor to this movie on the Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust dvd (Which was extremely good, by the way), which made me very excited about picking up this title. But upon viewing, my excitement turned into confusion, and from confusion to disappointment, and from disappointment to sheer anger.If one word could describe this, it would be &quot;rushed.&quot; Weighing at only 50 minutes long, the director (or writer, producer, or whoever else was involved) tried to cram too much into such a short film, and in turn told a sloppy and yawn-inspiring story. While I have no problem at all with gore and nudity, it seems at certain points that they were added in just to say there was gore and nudity (like the scene when the woman was re-united with her fiance and stabs him in the neck, which subsequently had no effect on him). Scenes are extremely short, begin with no set-up, and end very abruptly. It's almost as if 15 different concepts were thrown into a hat, and animated, and strung together in the last scene of the film.The list of positives are very short. The artwork was above average, some of the action was cool. The dialog in the last scene was exceptional. Thats about it.Twilight of the Dark Master had the potential to be an excellent film, only if it had been at LEAST 30 minutes longer. That extra time would've given more time to explain certain things in the film and give the characters more development, which is desparately needed. If you still have the urge to get this, I would advise you to rent it first, or you'll most likely end up looking for your reciept, like I am.",2,Falls way short of its potential.

430820,AK0CENM3LUM28,6304674686,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Twilight of the Dark Master / B00005BCKE*Spoilers*I understand that ""Twilight of the Dark Master"" is a movie based on an existing manga series - one that I haven't really been exposed to up until this point. From my outsider's experience, I think it's safe to say that non-fans probably won't be won over by this movie.I have no doubt that a lot of effort went into the making of ""Twilight of the Dark Master"". The animation is lovely, the English voice dubbing is decently done, and the plot - what little there is - does try to keep the viewer in the loop as much as possible. Unfortunately, the final effort just comes off as deeply shallow, as though this were the basic framework of a movie, rather than an actual, complete movie in its own right.The basic story arc is that here are demons and angels/guardians living amongst humans, striving against each other in a silent warfare. A recent experimental drug, however, has been used to turn a human into a demon and his tattered and emotionally scarred fiance sets out in a determined (and rather shell-shocked) quest for vengeance. About five feet from her apartment, though, she rather procipitously rus into a man who just happens to know a demon-hunter (lucky!) and they tromp off to talk to the guardian and explain their troubles.The local guardian seems to work as a sort of paranormal consultant to the police - a kind of cross between Sherlock Holes and Blade, if I may be forgiven the analogy. And here is where the story is the most interesting. The guardian sleuths about a little bit ham-handedly, but the character has such a soothingly competant voice that it's easy to immerse yourself anyway, and try to enjoy the trail of clues. Unfortunately, the guardian turns out to be a little *too* competent - to the detriment of the movie - as his one and only clue is the only one he needs to solve the case, and the villains who try to murder him along the way are so massively out-classed by his magical guardian powers that there's just no tension. And this failing sort of surprises me - it's not rocket science to understand that a threat must be credible or else the drama is undermined. But it would seem that someone on the writing staff was so committed to the idea that humans are weak and guardians are unstoppable gods that they refused to be budged on ideology for the sake of a good movie.Several other reviews have already noted that ""Twilight of the Dark Master"" is unpleasantly short, and while the sequences described above are far too rushed, the main reason for ""Twilight""'s short length seems to be its almost complete lack of a proper ending. When a major demon turns up for a climactic end battle, it would appear that the developers realized that they had run out of budget and just rushed through a dialogue-laden alternative ending that performs several major artistic offenses, including the shoe-horning in of a previously unmentioned relationship between the guardian and the demon and - worst of all - just completely fails to make any sense.Honestly, ""Twilight"" isn't bad, if you're just looking at anime as a genre to explore, but there are much better out there and it's ridiculously over-priced considering the short length, rushed content, and lack of drama. Check it out as a rental if you must, but if you're not already a fan you probably won't want to see it twice.This movie provides English subtitles for the hearing impaired, however, the English subtitles almost never match the English spoken dialogue, which can be very annoying at times.~ Ana Mardoll",2,If you're not already a fan of the manga...,1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,3563,"['Twilight', 'Dark', 'Master', '/', 'B00005BCKE*Spoilers*I', 'understand', 'Twilight', 'Dark', 'Master', 'movie', 'based', 'existing', 'manga', 'series', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'exposed', 'up', 'point', 'outsider', 'experience', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'non-fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'won', 'over', 'movie.I', 'have', 'doubt', 'lot', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'Twilight', 'Dark', 'Master', 'animation', 'lovely', 'English', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'decently', 'done', 'plot', 'what', 'little', 'try', 'keep', 'viewer', 'loop', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'Unfortunately', 'final', 'effort', 'just', 'off', 'deeply', 'shallow', 'were', 'basic', 'framework', 'movie', 'rather', 'actual', 'complete', 'movie', 'own', 'right.The', 'basic', 'story', 'arc', 'here', 'are', 'demons', 'angels/guardians', 'living', 'amongst', 'humans', 'striving', 'other', 'silent', 'warfare', 'recent', 'experimental', 'drug', 'however', 'been', 'used', 'turn', 'human', 'demon', 'tattered', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'fiance', 'sets', 'out', 'determined', 'rather', 'shell-shocked', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'five', 'feet', 'apartment', 'rather', 'procipitously', 'rus', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'know', 'demon-hunter', 'lucky', 'tromp', 'talk', 'guardian', 'explain', 'troubles.The', 'local', 'guardian', 'work', 'sort', 'paranormal', 'consultant', 'police', 'kind', 'cross', 'Sherlock', 'Holes', 'Blade', 'may', 'be', 'forgiven', 'analogy', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'most', 'interesting', 'guardian', 'sleuths', 'little', 'bit', 'ham-handedly', 'character', 'soothingly', 'competant', 'voice', 'easy', 'immerse', 'anyway', 'try', 'enjoy', 'trail', 'clues', 'Unfortunately', 'guardian', 'out', 'be', 'little', '*too*', 'competent', 'detriment', 'movie', 'one', 'only', 'clue', 'only', 'one', 'solve', 'case', 'villains', 'who', 'try', 'murder', 'way', 'are', 'so', 'massively', 'out-classed', 'magical', 'guardian', 'powers', 'just', 'tension', 'failing', 'sort', 'surprises', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'understand', 'threat', 'must', 'be', 'credible', 'else', 'drama', 'undermined', 'would', 'seem', 'someone', 'writing', 'staff', 'was', 'so', 'committed', 'idea', 'humans', 'are', 'weak', 'guardians', 'are', 'unstoppable', 'gods', 'refused', 'be', 'budged', 'ideology', 'sake', 'good', 'movie.Several', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'Twilight', 'Dark', 'Master', 'unpleasantly', 'short', 'sequences', 'described', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'rushed', 'main', 'reason', 'Twilight', 'short', 'length', 'be', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'proper', 'ending', 'When', 'major', 'demon', 'up', 'climactic', 'end', 'battle', 'would', 'appear', 'developers', 'realized', 'had', 'run', 'budget', 'just', 'rushed', 'dialogue-laden', 'alternative', 'ending', 'several', 'major', 'artistic', 'offenses', 'including', 'shoe-horning', 'previously', 'unmentioned', 'relationship', 'guardian', 'demon', 'worst', 'just', 'completely', 'make', 'sense.Honestly', 'Twilight', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'anime', 'genre', 'explore', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'there', 'ridiculously', 'over-priced', 'considering', 'short', 'length', 'rushed', 'content', 'lack', 'drama', 'Check', 'out', 'rental', 'must', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'twice.This', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'however', 'English', 'almost', 'never', 'match', 'English', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'times.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Twilight of the Dark Master VHS

Though the beginning prelude speaking of the Great Mother has little effect on the movie, I believe that what makes this movie so worthwhile is its skillful animation and the personality of the main characters Tsunami Shijyo and Chen &amp; Huang Long.  Though the movie borrows from Bio Hunter with its idea to have an innocent, pure guy turn into a hideous demon, the movie is unique in the way it unfolds.  The main things that irritated me about the movie were its duration of 45 minutes, its tendency to leave the viewer waiting for something to happen when it simply builds up to an anticlimactic ending, and most importantly, the brevity of the final battle between Tsunami and the brains behind the operation, Mr. Takayami.  Amazon.com's review couldn't have been more accurate when it said the fight was over before it even began.  About two hits were exchanged before Mr. Takayami met his untimely demise.

Unaware of the larger plot involving the recreation of an age old &uuml;ber-monster, the two are distracted from their task by a pair of wind manipulating, incestuous siblings.

The characters remain mysteries throughout, with the Elric-albino-like hero barely registering on the personality meter.  Emotive sadness is at least hinted at by the interaction between the fiance trapped in the demon body and his long suffering woman.  The effects are appropriate for such a dark and dismal futuristic world, rain and terror abounds, especially as the demon is `fed' by the proprietor of a high class sex club.

Being female I have a soft spot for touching emotional stories about love and heartache, however I hate dramas. Kinda wierd huh? What I do like is touching love stories when they are combined with elements of gore, fighting, and did I mention gore? Especially when creepy demons are running about. Cool. This movie didn't have a whole lotta action but it is there and the sheer atmosphere of the setting is creepy enough to give you goosebumps. It does have it's fair share of blood and killing tho' for freaks like me that crave that kinda thing. What I really loved about the movie was the extremly beautiful and tragic love story intertwined in it. I even cried at the end. The story is also very good, there is a lot of talking but if you actually listen to what they're saying you'll find it all ties in together very nicely. The character designs and music are also very gorgeous. I should add that the dub is extremely well done and impressed me greatly. No corny high pitched screeching like some animes. I recommend this for anyone who likes a little blood, a good story and setting, and tragic love.",5,I luv this movie,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1148,"['perfect', 'anime', 'movie', 'Being', 'female', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'touching', 'emotional', 'stories', 'love', 'heartache', 'however', 'hate', 'dramas', 'Kinda', 'wierd', 'huh', 'What', 'do', 'touching', 'love', 'stories', 'when', 'are', 'combined', 'elements', 'gore', 'fighting', 'did', 'mention', 'gore', 'Especially', 'when', 'creepy', 'demons', 'are', 'running', 'about', 'Cool', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lotta', 'action', 'there', 'sheer', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'creepy', 'enough', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'blood', 'killing', 'tho', 'freaks', 'crave', 'kinda', 'thing', 'What', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'extremly', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'intertwined', 'even', 'cried', 'end', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'lot', 'talking', 'actually', 'listen', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', ""'ll"", 'find', 'ties', 'together', 'very', 'nicely', 'character', 'designs', 'music', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'should', 'add', 'dub', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'impressed', 'greatly', 'No', 'corny', 'high', 'pitched', 'screeching', 'animes', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'blood', 'good', 'story', 'setting', 'tragic', 'love']",Twilight of the Dark Master VHS

I saw this anime many years ago on a late night TV station. I believe they used it as filler between there last show and the sunrise service.  That was their mistake! This is the telling of a story that is picked up in other anime's and deals with the fight between demons and good people.  It is a dark, and sometimes violent story, the director uses everything in the film in good use. If this looks familiar to you, it's because this story also hints at other anime's, like Wicked City, Cyber-City and  many other. This was the first used DVD I've ever bough, but it certainly wont be my last. it is an excellent addition to any anime collection.",5,an old title gets new life.,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,755,"['short', '44', 'mintues', 'anime', 'well', 'viewing', 'reviewing', 'case', 'saw', 'anime', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'station', 'believe', 'used', 'filler', 'last', 'show', 'sunrise', 'service', 'was', 'mistake', 'telling', 'story', 'picked', 'up', 'other', 'anime', 'deals', 'fight', 'demons', 'good', 'people', 'dark', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'story', 'director', 'everything', 'film', 'good', 'use', 'familiar', 'story', 'also', 'hints', 'other', 'anime', 'Wicked', 'City', 'Cyber-City', 'many', 'other', 'was', 'first', 'used', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bough', 'certainly', 'wont', 'be', 'last', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anime', 'collection']",Twilight of the Dark Master VHS
430831,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,6304674686,Robin Simmons,"[0, 0]","Saki Okuse's manga (graphic novel) is the basis of this  short (50 minute) feature anime.  It's a strange, unsettling mix of vaguely Biblical and pagan mythology as filtered through Japanese pop and religious culture. The story begins with Eiji, a pharmaceutical researcher, celebrating his engagement who suddenly turns into a monster, runs amok and generates havoc until he's captured by Huang and Chen, a creepy brother and sister team who take him to a sex club and feed him prostitutes.  Still with me?  Okay, it seems that Eiji has unknowingly been part of an experiment by a guy named Takamiya, who happens to be a master demon.  In the yin and yang of things, there's Guardian and fire master Tsunami who takes on evil Takamiya.  It seems that eons ago, grotesque Demons and glorious Guardians battled over earth -- a gift from the Mother of all life.  When humans appeared, they were enslaved by the Demons.  But humans have forgotten their past and now, in 2089 only one Demon and Guardian remain in battle for the fate of humankind.  Akiyuki Shimbo directs mostly striking but static images with elaborate audio action.  Nudity, violence against women, implications of rape, and incest.I was disappointed in the often static images and the minimalist story that has so much potential.  This could be remade as a CGI or even live action film.  Wonder if anyone will rediscover this obscure and weirdly relevant film that finally explains what's going on in the world.  Well, it's one point of view.",2,WAY UNDERSTATED BUT A BIG STORY,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1508,"['Saki', 'Okuse', 'manga', 'graphic', 'novel', 'basis', 'short', '50', 'minute', 'feature', 'anime', 'strange', 'unsettling', 'mix', 'vaguely', 'Biblical', 'pagan', 'mythology', 'filtered', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'religious', 'culture', 'story', 'Eiji', 'pharmaceutical', 'researcher', 'celebrating', 'engagement', 'who', 'suddenly', 'monster', 'amok', 'havoc', 'captured', 'Huang', 'Chen', 'creepy', 'brother', 'sister', 'team', 'who', 'take', 'sex', 'club', 'feed', 'prostitutes', 'Still', 'Okay', 'Eiji', 'unknowingly', 'been', 'part', 'experiment', 'guy', 'named', 'Takamiya', 'who', 'be', 'master', 'demon', 'yin', 'yang', 'things', 'Guardian', 'fire', 'master', 'Tsunami', 'who', 'evil', 'Takamiya', 'eons', 'ago', 'grotesque', 'Demons', 'glorious', 'Guardians', 'battled', 'earth', 'gift', 'Mother', 'life', 'When', 'humans', 'appeared', 'were', 'enslaved', 'Demons', 'humans', 'have', 'forgotten', 'past', 'now', '2089', 'only', 'one', 'Demon', 'Guardian', 'remain', 'battle', 'fate', 'humankind', 'Akiyuki', 'Shimbo', 'mostly', 'striking', 'static', 'images', 'elaborate', 'audio', 'action', 'Nudity', 'violence', 'women', 'implications', 'rape', 'incest.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'often', 'static', 'images', 'minimalist', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'could', 'be', 'remade', 'CGI', 'even', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'Wonder', 'anyone', 'will', 'rediscover', 'obscure', 'weirdly', 'relevant', 'film', 'finally', 'what', 'going', 'world', 'Well', 'one', 'point', 'view']",Twilight of the Dark Master VHS
