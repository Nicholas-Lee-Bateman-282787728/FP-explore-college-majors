489274,A97Q71MM5N4NW,8901732106,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[5, 6]","I was really surprised at this movie. I didn't really suspect it to ammount to much considering it came out a year before Left Behind did. I liked it a lot. It was neat how half of the movie was filmed in the news studio, and that they could go all around the world, and show everything from mostly just one place. A very good idea to which the gorgeous Leigh Lewis is playing the star character.It is the age of the newscaster era. Top Journalists Helen Hannah (Liegh Lewis) and Bronson Pearl (Richard Nester) are caught in the middle of something about to go off. World War III is erupting all over the face of the earth, in country's that were once allies. While Bronson is over in Israel, Live with the explosion footage, suddenly millions of people disappear all at once off the face of the earth. President Franco Macalousso claims he has taken these people away due to religious purposes, and that they will cause even more disaster on the earth even with the war. Helen finds this suspicious, and investigates, finding out that it is not the people that were taken, but it was the people who were left behind that are in danger. Soon, an associate of Macalousso, Len Parker, is taking over Helens newscaster building claiming he is now the CEO. It seems that he is stalking her with spies, and as she desperately tries to escape, she must remember, there is one more person to convince before she can escape the spiraling doom that the antichrist now has her trapped in.Some people may have several confusions about Apocalypse, and be skeptical about it at first, but like it says, ""Take your bible off the shelf, and read the book of revelation for yourself"". I was laughing when everyone disappeared and the clothes were left neatly folded in a pile. This may be possible though, for when Jesus arose from the grave, all that was left in the tomb was a neatly folded pile of grave clothes; signifying God is neat (not neat: terrific, but that too). I was so confused with the Rapture and the Tribulation being only 12 when I saw this. Now that I'm fourteen, I understand all of it, and  I've given my life to God.It really shouldn't take some Apocalyptic event (9/11, thousands of people suddenly going to church) or movie for people to give their life to God. If the Rapture happens, the suicide count is going to be huge considering people will think they can't give their life to God after it happens. Everyone deserves a second chance, and that's exactly what Apocalypse was trying to show. Even if you are left behind, you will have another chance.The Soundtrack to Apocalypse is awesome. If you didn't like the film, no one can resist the fact that the music always captures everyone no matter what, especially with some of the coolest Christian singers around, featuring my personal favorites, ""The Band of survivors"" and, ""Caught in the eye of the storm"". And I'll tell you the truth, the only 100% good acting came from Leigh Lewis who is probably the most underrated actress of our time, but I'm happy she came back in the trilogy of sequels from Apocalypse; Revelation, Tribulation, and Judgment. As for Richard Nester, he was okay, but a little over reactant for the part of Bronson Pearl. I think as the main male actors came in each film, they got better, but no one can replace the indespensible Leigh Lewis as Helen Hannah.I have noticed something about all the Rapture films. Almost all the starring woman of the films, Left Behind, A Thief In the Night, Apocalypse, all of these have blondes starring as the main characters. Maybe they should change to someone different, but these actresses still do the best. I still think Leigh Lewis is the best out of all of them. Keep up the good Raptures.",5,You Think you know...,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,3723,"['was', 'really', 'surprised', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'suspect', 'ammount', 'much', 'considering', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Left', 'Behind', 'did', 'liked', 'lot', 'was', 'neat', 'how', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'news', 'studio', 'could', 'go', 'world', 'show', 'everything', 'mostly', 'just', 'one', 'place', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'gorgeous', 'Leigh', 'Lewis', 'playing', 'star', 'character.It', 'age', 'newscaster', 'era', 'Top', 'Journalists', 'Helen', 'Hannah', 'Liegh', 'Lewis', 'Bronson', 'Pearl', 'Richard', 'Nester', 'are', 'caught', 'middle', 'something', 'go', 'off', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'erupting', 'face', 'earth', 'country', 'were', 'once', 'allies', 'Bronson', 'Israel', 'Live', 'explosion', 'footage', 'suddenly', 'millions', 'people', 'disappear', 'once', 'face', 'earth', 'President', 'Franco', 'Macalousso', 'taken', 'people', 'away', 'due', 'religious', 'purposes', 'will', 'cause', 'even', 'more', 'disaster', 'earth', 'even', 'war', 'Helen', 'suspicious', 'investigates', 'finding', 'out', 'not', 'people', 'were', 'taken', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'are', 'danger', 'Soon', 'associate', 'Macalousso', 'Len', 'Parker', 'taking', 'over', 'Helens', 'newscaster', 'building', 'claiming', 'now', 'CEO', 'stalking', 'spies', 'desperately', 'escape', 'must', 'remember', 'one', 'more', 'person', 'convince', 'can', 'escape', 'spiraling', 'doom', 'antichrist', 'now', 'trapped', 'in.Some', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'several', 'confusions', 'Apocalypse', 'be', 'skeptical', 'first', 'Take', 'bible', 'off', 'shelf', 'read', 'book', 'revelation', 'was', 'laughing', 'when', 'everyone', 'disappeared', 'clothes', 'were', 'left', 'neatly', 'folded', 'pile', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'when', 'Jesus', 'arose', 'grave', 'was', 'left', 'tomb', 'was', 'neatly', 'folded', 'pile', 'grave', 'clothes', 'signifying', 'God', 'neat', 'not', 'neat', 'terrific', 'too', 'was', 'so', 'confused', 'Rapture', 'Tribulation', 'being', 'only', '12', 'when', 'saw', 'Now', ""'m"", 'fourteen', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'given', 'life', 'God.It', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'Apocalyptic', 'event', '9/11', 'thousands', 'people', 'suddenly', 'going', 'church', 'movie', 'people', 'give', 'life', 'God', 'Rapture', 'suicide', 'count', 'going', 'be', 'huge', 'considering', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'life', 'God', 'Everyone', 'second', 'chance', 'exactly', 'what', 'Apocalypse', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'Even', 'are', 'left', 'will', 'have', 'chance.The', 'Soundtrack', 'Apocalypse', 'awesome', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'one', 'can', 'resist', 'fact', 'music', 'always', 'everyone', 'matter', 'what', 'especially', 'coolest', 'Christian', 'singers', 'featuring', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Band', 'survivors', 'Caught', 'eye', 'storm', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'truth', 'only', '100', '%', 'good', 'acting', 'came', 'Leigh', 'Lewis', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'underrated', 'actress', 'time', ""'m"", 'happy', 'came', 'back', 'trilogy', 'sequels', 'Apocalypse', 'Revelation', 'Tribulation', 'Judgment', 'Richard', 'Nester', 'was', 'okay', 'little', 'over', 'reactant', 'part', 'Bronson', 'Pearl', 'think', 'main', 'male', 'actors', 'came', 'film', 'got', 'better', 'one', 'can', 'replace', 'indespensible', 'Leigh', 'Lewis', 'Helen', 'Hannah.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'something', 'Rapture', 'films', 'Almost', 'starring', 'woman', 'films', 'Left', 'Behind', 'A', 'Thief', 'Night', 'Apocalypse', 'have', 'blondes', 'starring', 'main', 'characters', 'Maybe', 'should', 'change', 'someone', 'different', 'actresses', 'still', 'do', 'best', 'still', 'think', 'Leigh', 'Lewis', 'best', 'Keep', 'good', 'Raptures']",N/A
489275,A3TD7B0CT1NHO4,8901732106,Gregory Nyman,"[5, 5]","This film was the first in the series of those to follow, where it tracks the Biblical prophecies of the ""End Times,"" and in particular the Rapture and the immediately-following Tribulation period.  In this first film we are introduced to Helen Hannah, played remarkably well by Leigh Lewis, and her co-anchor Bronson Pearl, played equally well by Richard Nester, and we watch with almost riveting accuracy, as the events foretold thousands of years ago unfold before our eyes.Army after army descends into the valley of Armageddon in Central Israel, and then millions of people vanish, and it's a media event unlike any in history, with the entire world glued to their TV sets.  At that very moment, a charismatic leader arises and performs a miracle of astounding dimensions, that the rest of the world believes he is the long-awaited Messiah.Only Bronson Pearl and Helen Hannah, the co-anchors of World News Network (WNN), are in a position to uncover the truth, and as Helen begins to uncover the true identity of this great leader, she is torn between her love for Bronson and her new-found understanding about Christ and the Anti-christ.  And with global forces in hot pursuit, there's only one chance to warn the world as it rushes headlong into the Apocalypse.This was an interesting film, and the footage which it uses to show the ""around the world"" minute by minute breaking news was astounding and very relative to the world we all live in.  There has yet to be installed, though, an intriguing piece of technology, which is super-screens, which sit on top of tall buildings in every city in the globe in order to broadcast the news.  This was prominent in the movie, and it worked well when used by the Anti-Christ to address the world.  It is highly possible that this technology is yet to be revealed, and the instant news and other events could be transmitted within seconds to every area of the world.This is a great film, and an important introduction to the following three films of the same story.

489279,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,8901732106,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 10]","What happens when a couple of Christian `wannabe' filmmakers attempt to deliver an intense apocalyptic thriller, but with the budget, writing, and acting of an after-school special?  You get the utter crap-fest that is the wannabe religious thriller, ""Apocalypse"".""Apocalypse"" is the story of the end of days, at least as Peter and Paul Lalonde interpret them from the final book in the Bible, Revelation.  The basic premise is that all of the Christians are raptured (removed from Earth by God to be with Him in Heaven), and all of the non-believers are left here to endure the Tribulation.  The Tribulation is a period of anywhere from 7-10 years according to Biblical scholars, during this time some people will come to know God, while others will fall under the power and control of the Antichrist.  People that convert to Christianity during this period of trial, will suffer many terrible persecutions by the forces of the Antichrist, and all who do not bow to the will of the Beast (Antichrist) will pay the ultimate price, death.The problem many Christian filmmakers face, which is the case here, is that they don't have the proper funding to get the technology, actors, and crew needed to make a decent film.  I have seen several Christian movies (I used to work at a Christian store), and almost all of them are terribly written, horribly acted, and feature special effects work that belongs in the 60's.  When watching this movie, I couldn't believe how anyone would ever consider this a good movie, let alone how the filmmakers even thought that someone would want to sit through this horribly written and acted piece of trash.The biggest problem with the movie, aside from the horrible script, acting, and directing, is the fact that it attempts to do too much in a small time period.  The attempt is made to basically give an overview of the end times in this one movie, and hope that audiences will enjoy the film enough to warrant sequels for them to elaborate with.  Another problem is that the script is so amateurish, that it fails to really get into any kind of detail, or analysis with the events depicted in the Book of Revelation, causing the majority of the movie to feel pointless and a waste of time.  Also the lack of backstory and detail causes anyone that is unfamiliar with the Book of Revelation to be confused, even though I have studied the Book of Revelation and read many commentaries on the subject, I was still confused at some points in this film, although to be fair that could be a result of the poorly written script.What it all boils down to is this, if Christians want to make movies that can rival the big boys (Hollywood), then they are going to have to get better funding, better writing, better acting, and better directing.  You can't just buy a camera, write down a few lines that form some form of coherent thoughts, have some actor say the lines, and expect audiences to want more.  Is there a market for Christian films?  The answer is yes, there is, and Mel Gibson's epic ""The Passion of the Christ"" proved this.  Are the Christian films (not counting Mel's epic) that are currently being produced filling that need?  No they aren't, and at this rate they never will.  However, I must say this, even though I thought this movie sucked, some people did enjoy it to at least some extent since it did spawn a few sequels.  In my opinion though, the people that liked this film are not that hard to impress, because this film, ""Apocalypse"" is not only a waste of time, but very little money as well.",1,Horrible Attempt To Make A Good Christian Movie...,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,3548,"['What', 'when', 'couple', 'Christian', 'wannabe', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'deliver', 'intense', 'apocalyptic', 'thriller', 'budget', 'writing', 'acting', 'after-school', 'special', 'get', 'utter', 'crap-fest', 'wannabe', 'religious', 'thriller', 'Apocalypse', 'Apocalypse', 'story', 'end', 'days', 'least', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Lalonde', 'interpret', 'final', 'book', 'Bible', 'Revelation', 'basic', 'premise', 'Christians', 'are', 'raptured', 'removed', 'Earth', 'God', 'be', 'Him', 'Heaven', 'non-believers', 'are', 'left', 'here', 'endure', 'Tribulation', 'Tribulation', 'period', 'anywhere', '7-10', 'years', 'according', 'Biblical', 'scholars', 'time', 'people', 'will', 'come', 'know', 'God', 'others', 'will', 'fall', 'power', 'control', 'Antichrist', 'People', 'convert', 'Christianity', 'period', 'trial', 'will', 'suffer', 'many', 'terrible', 'persecutions', 'forces', 'Antichrist', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'bow', 'will', 'Beast', 'Antichrist', 'will', 'pay', 'ultimate', 'price', 'death.The', 'problem', 'many', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'face', 'case', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'proper', 'funding', 'get', 'technology', 'actors', 'crew', 'needed', 'make', 'decent', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'Christian', 'movies', 'used', 'work', 'Christian', 'store', 'almost', 'are', 'terribly', 'written', 'horribly', 'acted', 'feature', 'special', 'effects', 'work', '60', 'When', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'consider', 'good', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'thought', 'someone', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'horribly', 'written', 'acted', 'piece', 'trash.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'aside', 'horrible', 'script', 'acting', 'directing', 'fact', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'small', 'time', 'period', 'attempt', 'made', 'basically', 'give', 'overview', 'end', 'times', 'one', 'movie', 'hope', 'audiences', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequels', 'elaborate', 'problem', 'script', 'so', 'amateurish', 'really', 'get', 'kind', 'detail', 'analysis', 'events', 'depicted', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'causing', 'majority', 'movie', 'feel', 'pointless', 'waste', 'time', 'Also', 'lack', 'backstory', 'detail', 'causes', 'anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'be', 'confused', 'even', 'have', 'studied', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'read', 'many', 'commentaries', 'subject', 'was', 'still', 'confused', 'points', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'could', 'be', 'result', 'poorly', 'written', 'script.What', 'down', 'Christians', 'want', 'make', 'movies', 'can', 'rival', 'big', 'boys', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'get', 'better', 'funding', 'better', 'writing', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'directing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'buy', 'camera', 'write', 'down', 'few', 'lines', 'form', 'form', 'coherent', 'thoughts', 'have', 'actor', 'say', 'lines', 'expect', 'audiences', 'want', 'more', 'there', 'market', 'Christian', 'films', 'answer', 'yes', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'epic', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'proved', 'Are', 'Christian', 'films', 'not', 'counting', 'Mel', 'epic', 'are', 'currently', 'being', 'produced', 'filling', 'need', 'No', 'are', ""n't"", 'rate', 'never', 'will', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'even', 'thought', 'movie', 'sucked', 'people', 'did', 'enjoy', 'least', 'extent', 'did', 'spawn', 'few', 'sequels', 'opinion', 'people', 'liked', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'impress', 'film', 'Apocalypse', 'not', 'only', 'waste', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'well']",N/A

It did not help the film any by having those who were ""raptured"" across the world leave behind all their clothes washed and folded; and one even is able to leave a written note behind. The movie does do a good job at showing you how a person with no conscience who wants absolute power turns a population's anger on some innocent group.The soundtrack has some good Christian music on it, but that is understandable when you read the credits and see the small recording label donated the songs for the movies use. Yet no credits are given from the old newsreel tragedies that were used. If you want to watch this, do as I am doing with the series, check it out from the library. You will not want to watch it more then once.",1,Not a Promising Start to a Series,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,1316,"['first', 'series', 'four', 'DVDs', 'Apocalypse', 'tradition', 'Left', 'Behind', 'movies', 'much', 'smaller', 'budget', 'bad', 'acting', 'worse', 'script', 'production', 'have', 'male', 'female', 'co-anchor', 'news', 'network', 'caught', 'middle', 'armies', 'descend', 'Valley', 'Armageddon', 'millions', 'people', 'vanish', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'arises.Of', 'course', 'rapture', 'movie', 'suppose', 'help', 'premillennial', 'evangelical', 'crowd', 'convince', 'people', 'beliefs', 'filmed', 'videocassette', 'recorder', 'old', 'news', 'real', 'stock', 'spliced', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'film', 'having', 'who', 'were', 'raptured', 'world', 'leave', 'clothes', 'washed', 'folded', 'one', 'even', 'able', 'leave', 'written', 'note', 'movie', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'person', 'conscience', 'who', 'absolute', 'power', 'population', 'anger', 'innocent', 'group.The', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'Christian', 'music', 'understandable', 'when', 'read', 'credits', 'see', 'small', 'recording', 'label', 'donated', 'songs', 'movies', 'use', 'credits', 'are', 'given', 'old', 'newsreel', 'tragedies', 'were', 'used', 'want', 'watch', 'do', 'am', 'doing', 'series', 'check', 'out', 'library', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'then', 'once']",N/A
489281,A27QLYGAM9AU3M,8901732106,Mike Sobocinski,"[3, 6]","A surprisingly interesting portrayal of an interpretation of Biblical passages that are assumed to apply to (what else?!) our immediate future.  Although low budget, the film effectively communicates the worldview of a certain style of conservative Christianity that sees itself as menaced by a secular world.  Some contrivances set up a scenario where Christianity effectively goes back to its roots as a persecuted minority sect.  The largest weakness in this film is that although miracles are presented as occurring, we do not see God or Jesus appear at the end.  Instead, we have televangelist Jack Van Impe (co-producer and script adviser for the film) LITERALLY presenting himself as guiding the world to salvation through his taped messages.  Van Impe apparently sees himself as a modern day Paul, singlehandedly leading his fellows to salvation in a hostile environment.  The film's portrayal of international conflict avoids any specific political background, thus feeling more like people straining to understand world issues with only the Bible and each other as a guide, and no knowledge of politics, history, sociology, or other &quot;earthly wisdom&quot; to help them.  As such, it is geared toward people who have been raised with Christian sympathies yet lack a good way to make sense of the world.  For persons without a Christian background, the film will seem to be a weak horror thriller.  Hypnotic simulations of live news broadcasts are doubtlessly this film's strongest point.  Once we are suitably impressed with the spectacle of massive events, audiences are assumed to beg for guidance and not be as able to question what they are handed.  And of course, the main issue of the film seems to be that Christians need to rely on the truth of prophecy (as interpreted by Van Impe) in order to survive and maintain their faith!!",2,Projected fears and anxieties...,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,1850,"['surprisingly', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'interpretation', 'Biblical', 'passages', 'are', 'assumed', 'apply', 'what', 'else', 'immediate', 'future', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'effectively', 'worldview', 'certain', 'style', 'conservative', 'Christianity', 'menaced', 'secular', 'world', 'contrivances', 'set', 'up', 'scenario', 'where', 'Christianity', 'effectively', 'back', 'roots', 'persecuted', 'minority', 'sect', 'largest', 'weakness', 'film', 'miracles', 'are', 'presented', 'occurring', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'God', 'Jesus', 'appear', 'end', 'Instead', 'have', 'televangelist', 'Jack', 'Van', 'Impe', 'co-producer', 'script', 'adviser', 'film', 'LITERALLY', 'presenting', 'guiding', 'world', 'salvation', 'taped', 'messages', 'Van', 'Impe', 'apparently', 'modern', 'day', 'Paul', 'singlehandedly', 'leading', 'fellows', 'salvation', 'hostile', 'environment', 'film', 'portrayal', 'international', 'conflict', 'avoids', 'specific', 'political', 'background', 'thus', 'feeling', 'more', 'people', 'straining', 'understand', 'world', 'issues', 'only', 'Bible', 'other', 'guide', 'knowledge', 'politics', 'history', 'sociology', 'other', 'quot', 'wisdom', 'quot', 'help', 'such', 'geared', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'Christian', 'sympathies', 'yet', 'lack', 'good', 'way', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'persons', 'Christian', 'background', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'be', 'weak', 'horror', 'thriller', 'Hypnotic', 'simulations', 'live', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'doubtlessly', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'are', 'suitably', 'impressed', 'spectacle', 'massive', 'events', 'audiences', 'are', 'assumed', 'beg', 'guidance', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'handed', 'course', 'main', 'issue', 'film', 'be', 'Christians', 'need', 'rely', 'truth', 'prophecy', 'interpreted', 'Van', 'Impe', 'order', 'survive', 'maintain', 'faith']",N/A
