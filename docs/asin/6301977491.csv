Made during a time that seemed flush with ""dying boy"" melodramas, ""Whose Life Is it Anyway?"" remains engaging and relevant today.  The economy of the dialogue gets right to the point for all characters, the physicians with their ideals, the girl friend who must deal with the loss of the man she loves, and the artist who lost the essence of who he is. It's refreshing and moving to see a script that spares us the sentimentality that so many similar stories indulge in. This makes the scenes of humor and warmth such as Ken's interaction with a young dialysis patient all the more meaningful.The film digs deep into issues that we're still talking about today such as the physician's role in caring for the terminally ill and the patient's right to autonomy.Dreyfuss and Cassavetes deliver solid performances, and while Cassavetes is our hero's adversary, he is by no means a villain, so regardless of where you stand on the issue, you will find your position fairly represented.Well worth moving to the top of your netflix queue today or even as a title to own.",4,"A wonderful, touching story that has aged flawlessly",1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,1130,"['truly', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'level', 'Made', 'time', 'seemed', 'flush', 'dying', 'boy', 'melodramas', 'Whose', 'Life', 'Anyway', 'engaging', 'relevant', 'today', 'economy', 'dialogue', 'right', 'point', 'characters', 'physicians', 'ideals', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'loss', 'man', 'artist', 'who', 'lost', 'essence', 'who', 'refreshing', 'moving', 'see', 'script', 'sentimentality', 'so', 'many', 'similar', 'stories', 'indulge', 'scenes', 'humor', 'warmth', 'such', 'Ken', 'interaction', 'young', 'dialysis', 'patient', 'more', 'meaningful.The', 'film', 'digs', 'deep', 'issues', ""'re"", 'still', 'talking', 'today', 'such', 'physician', 'role', 'caring', 'terminally', 'ill', 'patient', 'right', 'autonomy.Dreyfuss', 'Cassavetes', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'Cassavetes', 'hero', 'adversary', 'villain', 'regardless', 'where', 'stand', 'issue', 'will', 'find', 'position', 'fairly', 'represented.Well', 'worth', 'moving', 'top', 'netflix', 'queue', 'today', 'even', 'title', 'own']",Whose Life Is It Anyway?

His chief nemesis, of course, is his doctor, played by John Cassavetes. Dreyfuss is such an animated actor that not even being confined to a bed as quadriplegic can take that quality of acting away from him. Just in talking and using his brain he exudes more energy than most actors do in a screen performance.He hires a lawyer to fight his case in court, and he wins. At movie's end he leaves the hospital, and we don't know how to feel: good because he got what he fought for or bad because he's going to die now. Some scenes go straight for the heartstrings, but most of the movie is thought-provoking and intelligently done.

286555,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,6301977491,Kristopher Haines,"[2, 4]","I watched ""Whose Life is it Anyway"" because I read about it in an essay on disability in film. Paul K. Longmore argues that ""Whose Life"" disregards social stigma and discrimination on the part of the able-bodied world and instead casts the able-bodied as reluctant mercy killers.I am not a quadriplegic, my disability is cerebral palsy. If I wanted to kill myself I feel sure I could find a way, and I am disabled from birth. That is a little bit different than someone who LOSES his or her bodily-abilities in terms of the shock of the loss. My life with disability is all I have known, and I would imagine it would be worse to have been suddenly thrust into disabled life.Still, I wouldn't want to force anyone to live my life, or force them to live at all. It's not my choice, or society's at large; it's up to the person living that life. I do believe that the issues raised in ""Whose Life"" are distressing, and I believe that the arguments in favor of sustaining Dreyfuss's life are sound and sincere, as are his against the idea.Should I be more concerned with the issue as a disabled American? I hope not, especially now when there are many more advances in independence for people with all levels of disability. And yet, there is that distant fear that the choice will someday be taken from us and given to someone else who deems our existence miserable. Just look at the writings of Peter Singer for proof. He literally believes that animals are more aware of life than a human infant at 30-days old, and that parents of disabled infants should be given those 30-days to decide whether or not to let that baby continue to live.So, I suppose it IS a slippery slope, but as for the film itself, it is well made and worth a rent.",3,Should I be offended?

There's a powerful message in this film, and the actors, script-writers, and director do it justice.Ken Harrison is an artist, a sculptor, successful in his field and living with his beautiful girlfriend, when his life is changed forever by a horrible car accident.  While his life was saved, Ken becomes a quadriplegic.  Only able to move his shoulders and head, Ken feels helplessly out of control of his own life.  His life, he says, was all in his hands, not in his head.Six months later, as his existence is truly sinking into reality and Ken has recognized his condition is not something that will magically disappear one day, he tells his girlfriend to stop coming to the hospital and that its completely over between them.  He also tells the hospital to stop their treatment, he's decided that his life should end.  In an extremely powerful and poignant scene, Ken has refused the valium his doctor ordered for him, because the doctor felt he was too ""riled up"".  The doctor injects him anyway, as Ken helplessly watches.  ""How dare you inject that into my body without my permission?"" he asks.  And I wondered, how dare he?  It's a significant moment, imagine yourself as Ken impotently watching as someone does something to your very own body against your wishes.Ken hires a lawyer, and sues the hospital for ""Habeas Corpus"" (literally, ""give us the body"").  No matter what his requests for release from the hospital and cessation of treatment, including daily dialysis, Dr. Michael Emerson (John Cassavetes) ignores them.  Ken wants his treatment to stop so that he can die.  Despite his desire to end his life, Ken is amiable with the staff.  His funny, quirky personality has made him a favorite with the nurses and orderlies, and they are all saddened by his decision though they respect him enough to stand by him.The question of human euthanasia is so controversial, especially after Dr. Kevorkian brought the subject out into the direct sunlight.  The movie does a good job of portraying each side; Ken's personal decision to die and those around him who are morally and personally against it.  It's a very touching story, one that will make you shed at least a tiny tear, even if your not prone to them.  There's no sappiness or preaching getting in the way of the story.  The acting, specifically Richard Dreyfuss, is terrific.  It's a movie that stirs you emotionally, morally, and intellectually.  Don't miss out on this great movie.

286561,A1IEGPT1Q5D3R2,6301977491,T.G.,"[3, 9]","This film could have been great, except for some serious scripting and characterization problems.  Many of the characters are stereotypical, wafer-thin portrayals, particularly the head doctor who wants to keep Dreyfuss's character alive.  The &quot;party scene in the hospital basement&quot; is not only cliched, but nobody got fired or got in trouble (the Jamaican nurse in particular) for smoking dope in a hospital, and taking a quadraplegic patient out of their bed without permission in the middle of the night?  Give me a break!Finally, Dreyfuss's decision to &quot;remain in the hospital to die&quot; at the end... the judge's ruling was specifically that he be released (writ of Habeus Corpus), not that he be allowed to die without treatment in the hospital!These serious problems (particularly the latter, where he decides to stay in the hospital) just about ruined the film for me.  Never mind that there's never much of a real sense of suspense or genuine emotion here, and everything plays far too liberally off (melo)drama generated by the Dreyfuss character's decision.  I'll give it 3 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.  Comes dangerously close to trivializing the issues portrayed in the film, and occasionally crosses the line... if it weren't for much more honest films with subject matter just as difficult (like &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;) I might be more forgiving and just chalk it up to the best Hollywood can do with this sort of material, but I know better.",3,Could have been much better,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,1494,"['film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'serious', 'scripting', 'characterization', 'problems', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'wafer-thin', 'portrayals', 'particularly', 'head', 'doctor', 'who', 'keep', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'alive', 'quot', 'party', 'scene', 'hospital', 'basement', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'cliched', 'nobody', 'got', 'fired', 'got', 'trouble', 'Jamaican', 'nurse', 'particular', 'smoking', 'dope', 'hospital', 'taking', 'quadraplegic', 'patient', 'bed', 'permission', 'middle', 'night', 'Give', 'break', 'Finally', 'Dreyfuss', 'decision', 'quot', 'remain', 'hospital', 'die', 'quot', 'end', 'judge', 'ruling', 'was', 'specifically', 'be', 'released', 'writ', 'Habeus', 'Corpus', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'die', 'treatment', 'hospital', 'serious', 'problems', 'particularly', 'latter', 'where', 'stay', 'hospital', 'just', 'about', 'ruined', 'film', 'mind', 'never', 'much', 'real', 'sense', 'suspense', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'here', 'everything', 'plays', 'far', 'too', 'liberally', 'off', 'melo', 'drama', 'generated', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'decision', ""'ll"", 'give', '3', 'stars', 'feel', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'Comes', 'dangerously', 'close', 'trivializing', 'issues', 'portrayed', 'film', 'occasionally', 'line', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'honest', 'films', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'difficult', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'forgiving', 'just', 'chalk', 'up', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'do', 'sort', 'material', 'know', 'better']",Whose Life Is It Anyway?

Amazed at the kind of health care that can be taken for granted, and, on an adolescent-like  indulgent whim, petitioned for destruction. I think back of my uncle two years ago who couldn't die fast enough-to free up his hospital bed-from a DNR [without the family's consent BTW-which is exactly how euthanasia is consisitently proceeding in this country.] induced coma caused by a botched surgery, and I can't imagine a time where a chief of staff wanted a patient to inconveniently and expensively live, rather than be shuffled off to die!  But most of all I am amazed that this burgeoning story of a futilitarianism future generations are perhaps permanently sacrificed to is again and again presented as revolutionary and heroic and ""progressive.""  In films, why can't we see disabled people who fight to live against the resentful staffs who oblige and mentally pulverize them into throwing themselves away?  Why isn't a family or siginficant other who sacrifices to be there for someone and really love them positive, lauded and supported in any sense any more?  What about the natural self-esteem and appreciation of letting others take care of you sometimes necessary rather than a cause for a utilitarian guilt trip?  (We are all dependent and deprived of privacy at times-something the film in it's utilitarian and macho body prejudice won't consider.)
