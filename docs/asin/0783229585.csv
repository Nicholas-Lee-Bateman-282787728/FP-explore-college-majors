It is *very* Gallo-centric though, and I think that a clever feminist could have a field day ripping this film apart. I could understand why, too. To call this film  &quot;philosophical genius&quot; is a stretch, to say the very least; if  you stripped it of a few of its better idiosyncracies, it could be easily  dismissed as the cinematic equivalent of a Nine Inch Nails song, but with a  happy ending. However, I only say these things because I question some of  the ultra-glorification I've seen lavished on it. I think it's fairly  self-centered and self-serving as a piece of art. BUT, these are more  observations than anything else; I thought that the movie had a lot of  things going for it. Original, strange, and even emotive at times (though  in an abstract way, for me personally), not to mention an incredibly  entertaining cameo from Mickey Rourke.

The story itself is relatively implausible (e.g., Christina Ricci's character seems blithely unconcerned about her kidnapping by Gallo's Billy Brown), but these leaps of faith required by the viewer don't deter from the train wreck-like fascination of watching the tale unfold.The standout scenes by far are those with Billy's parents, portrayed indelibly by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston.  Huston is particularly noteworthy - in a dysfunctional family (one can only imagine this is very close to home for writer/director Gallo), she's the most dysfunctional - she's invented a completely unique character that words can't describe.

So far, so good. He searches for the man who caused him much misery in order to avenge himself. SO far so good here too. But the suspension of belief fails me when the movie shows Christina Ricci joining him in his quixotic quest. A poor, pathetic man. A loser with no ambitions but an oversize ego and inferiority complex. The film became a cult favorite - one that you see once (for free) and never watch again. Somehow I think this movie beat others in some indie festival and won a prize, which tells you just how bad indie films may have been that year. And as far as Mr. Gallo: having seen more of his movies, I would bet this week's lunch money that he acts in real life like the jerks he portrays in his movies.

Yes!That's all you need to know as far as what to expect- a very different kind of drama, with a *very* subtle touch of comedy (especially from Vincent Gallo's parents who are impolitely hilarious!)Buffalo '66 is actually an overall solid and wonderful movie.It's about a man who finally gets out of prison, and he apparently doesn't know what to do or where to go, so he kidnaps a woman who just so happens to willingly go along with his every single demand, and the two of them go on an adventure of a lifetime.I can honestly say I've never seen a movie quite like this.  The character played by Vincent Gallo has parents who are extremely weird, haha.  They apparently don't care about their son even a *little* bit when he shows up to their doorsteps one afternoon and... well, I really don't want to spoil the storyline for you.  I promise you it's extremely entertaining though.Vincent Gallo's character starts out by forcing the woman he kidnaps to do whatever he says, but Christinia Ricci's character is so laidback, nonchalant and just bizarrely quiet that she apparently doesn't have a single concern in the world, so she ends up going along with everything with no resistance whatsoever.Honestly, the tone of the film is definitely on the serious side above everything else, and the comedic elements are few and far between.

Why was he in prison, you may ask..  Well, Billy bet $10,000 one year that the Buffalo Bills would win the superbowl, which he loses of course.  The gangster bookie (Mickey Rourke) tells Billy that instead of doing really bad to things to him for not being able to pay off his huge bet, he can take the fall for another guy in relation to some crime concerning one of the bookie's friends.There's something pretty weird about this movie that had me laughing over the most horrible things..

Buffalo 66 is one of the finest independent films that I  have ever seen, and perhaps the most fascinating character study I have yet  to see on film.Christina Ricci provides a quietly poignant performance  as Layla, the odd but tenderhearted tap dancer who provides Gallo's Billy  Brown with the only true love he has ever received. Ricci is brilliantly  understated, and she relays just as much heartfelt meaning in one glance of  her beautiful, dark eyes as Gallo does in his barrage of rapid-fire  monologues.There are also fine supporting performances from Ben Gazzara  and Anjelica Huston, as Billy's utterly dysfunctional parents, Mickey  Rourke, as a sleazy bookie, Jan-Michael Vincent, as Billy's touchingly  loyal crony and owner of a bowling alley, and Kevin Corrigan, as Billy's  slow but well-meaning best friend.Buffalo 66 is an incredibly moving and  beautiful film. It provides some of the starkest movie images of  blue-collar society to come along since the '70s. The on-location Buffalo,  New York sites are haunting in their bleakness, and the filtered  photography emphasizes this all the more.On top of all of this, Gallo  provides a mesmerizing performance as Billy Brown--a man who has spent so  much of his life pining for love and tenderness that he doesn't know how to  deal with it once it is staring him in the face.",5,Original and Poignant,956534400,"04 24, 2000",2000,1510,"['Vincent', 'Gallo', 'directorial', 'debut', 'powerhouse', 'fine', 'acting', 'writing', 'direction', 'not', 'mention', 'showcase', 'hilariously', 'inventive', 'cinematography', 'Buffalo', '66', 'one', 'finest', 'independent', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film.Christina', 'Ricci', 'quietly', 'poignant', 'performance', 'Layla', 'odd', 'tenderhearted', 'tap', 'dancer', 'who', 'Gallo', 'Billy', 'Brown', 'only', 'true', 'love', 'ever', 'received', 'Ricci', 'brilliantly', 'understated', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'heartfelt', 'meaning', 'one', 'glance', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'eyes', 'Gallo', 'barrage', 'rapid-fire', 'monologues.There', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Billy', 'utterly', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'sleazy', 'bookie', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'Billy', 'touchingly', 'loyal', 'crony', 'owner', 'bowling', 'alley', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'Billy', 'slow', 'well-meaning', 'best', 'friend.Buffalo', '66', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'film', 'starkest', 'movie', 'images', 'blue-collar', 'society', 'come', 'along', ""'70s"", 'on-location', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'sites', 'are', 'haunting', 'bleakness', 'filtered', 'photography', 'more.On', 'top', 'Gallo', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Brown', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'pining', 'love', 'tenderness', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'staring', 'face']",N/A

Through flashbacks, director/star Vincent Gallo shows us the tragedy and misfortune which shaped Billy into the lying, emotionally unstable, islated man he was upon his release from prison.Gallo and Christina Ricci both shine as they play off each other as Billy and his kidnapee/confidante Layla.  Their relationship grows increasingly complex as the movie progresses, and the acting is superb.  Of course a movie like this can't end with everyone lying in a bed of roses, but there is an unepected turn that touches the viewers heart without seeming out of place.Angelica Huston is outstanding as Billy's mother.  She creates a character the audience will love to hate, a woman so subtly wretched that she makes the woman Billy kidnapped want to be nice to him.Gallo has gotten recent press for his latest movie, The Brown Bunny.  It is similarly gritty and bleak, focusing on a man adrift, but overall it fails while Bufflo '66 succeeds, mostly due to its overly snail-like pace.

62276,A3Q44JBPTVOSB2,0783229585,Joshua Pfister,"[13, 14]","The movie itself is timeless as far as I'm concerned. The unfolding of the depth behind this initially horrendous Billy Brown character is paced in such a way that you are watching the evolution of his past and present character simultaneously. Layla who seems to have a great insight into Billy's pain turns out to be his savior, and even though she is presented without any back story whatsoever you can't help but admire how important she becomes to the story. There is some controversy about misogynistic and homophobic acts and language in the film. While these aren't completely unwarranted someone going through the events portrayed in the film would most likely have these type of feelings regardless of moral guidelines. Billy is not meant to be portrayed as a saint but as a deeply flawed (damaged) character from a lifetime of humiliation and feeling inadequate. It is through Layla's acceptance and understanding that he evolves and begins to accept love and friendship as a tangible and obtainable goal. This part of the story is actually quite beautiful if you can move past the gritty and nasty behavior and try to see Billy as Layla does, accept him as a deeply flawed and hurt product of his environment with redeemable qualities that can be nurtured to bring out his true nature.All of this is set just underneath or on top of (depending on your view) a very effective dry humor. It is through this humor that you stay engaged and willing to take the journey with an initially deplorable person and find yourself discovering there is more than what is on the surface. Real life opinions of Gallo aside this film is amazing and deserves far more credit and attention than it receives. There was a rather painstaking process to the actual filming and production that was more expensive and &#34;inferior&#34; according to the people who bankroll the film. This process was insisted on by Gallo and it adds a really artistic quality to the cinematography. There are many little touches such as the surreal singing moment or Layla's dance at the bowling alley that remind you that this is art...and they are mesmerizing, almost hypnotic. Do not miss this movie.As for the Blu-ray itself. A 15th anniversary edition with only a trailer as the &#34;special features&#34; is a travesty. And while the movie looks and sounds great the fact that it got a single layer 25GB pressing with an inferior bitrate to the very high quality Japanese pressing is a real annoyance. If I had been aware of this single fact before purchase I would have spent the extra $15 or so for the nearly doubled (37GB vs 21GB) pressing with a total bitrate around 40Mbps which is the top end of what Blu-ray is capable of. These are technicalities of course and as I said this pressing looks great, but I am left wondering how much fine detail I missed out on by not purchasing the obviously less constrained and compressed Japanese version which is still region A and in English. I would have paid the additional funds for this copy to be of equal quality.You aren't likely to be disappointed with the picture quality on this version though especially if you never see the Japanese copy. It looks as good as many of my high bitrate Blu-rays and better than some. Be aware that while the sound is high quality, it is only in stereo. This is a limitation of both pressings with the Japanese version having a TrueHD stereo track and this version having a DTS-HDMA stereo track. It is an impressive track none the less and if you have quality speakers with good imaging you won't be taken out of the experience because of it.",5,One of my favorite movies.

62277,A3FVFJ8D95E9KY,0783229585,"K. Bentley ""amateur critic""","[4, 5]","Buffalo '66, directed and written by Vincent Gallo, is an incredible film about this guy named Billy Brown, played by Gallo himself. Billy was a man who was severely down in his luck, from having neglegent parents, terrible luck, and dysfunctional relationships. The root of his anger and bitterness definitely comes from his parents. His mother (played brilliantly yet uncharacteristically by Angelica Huston) was so obsessed with the Buffalo Bills that she disowns Billy since he was born on the same day the Bills won the Super Bowl in 1966 and she couldn't go to the game (and they haven't won since).The story starts off with Billy being released from a 5 year jail sentence (&quot;I was innocent&quot;) wandering the streets of Buffalo looking for a bathroom. He finds one at a dance studio, in which he runs into Layla (played by my favorite actress, Christina Ricci). He kidnaps her and somehow persuades her into pretending that she's this girl named Wnedy and that they are married, along with a whole barrage of lies, to impress his parents, not that they really care anyway.After that, Billy and Layla still go places together, but yet Billy is still very bitter and won't easily open up to Layla. He had many emotional scars and trauma (all shown in the movie) and contemplated doing a terrible act of revenge. Then he experienced an epiphany in terms of what would happen if he did it, with Yes' classic epic &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; used effectively, and from there he finds himself in a way, and the film has a surprising ending. This film dealt with human emotion in a non-cliched way, and contained great music and even better acting.

The music was pretty decent (Yes, King Crimson)2. Christina looks nice, but only has two looks in this movie - ""pout"" and ""gaze"".3. A few funny moments.4. Somewhat interesting camerawork. Except for the boring parts.Negatives...1. Hopelessly unbelievable story. Christina's character ""Leyla"" (but going by Billy's imaginary only-previous-girlfriend's name ""Wendy"") had many chances early on to escape her loony kidnapper, but chose not to. We have no character development for her, so we don't know if she is emotionally unstable, rebellious against her family, etc. Actually, the fact that she ends up liking the unlikable grimey ex-con loser points to fact that she has no taste, or sense.2. I can not emphasis enough how much of a loser the character of Billy is. He would not have survived 5 years in prison without getting his teeth knocked out and his nose broken because he was such a messed up ass. He needs some serious psychoanalysis (""Hold me a minute"" - she does - ""Don't touch me!"") Give me a break. His fashion sense has to be seen to be unbelieved. Although Billy seems to see the light at the end, I doubt he will make any lasting recovery. Bottom line - ""Does not play well with others.""These 2 large negatives pretty much balance out the 4 positives. It is a professionally-made movie, and the participants seem to be trying, however.Supporting cast of Mickey Rourke as a bookie, Jan-Michael Vincent as a washed-up alcoholic bowling-alley owner, and Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston as his parents are decent.Recommended for fans of Christina Ricci, and maybe residents of Buffalo.DVD has no extras.

Camera work is interesting too -- freeze frames, fade-ins and outs, and other techniques that added to the weirdly melodramatic atmosphere.

However, this movie was brilliant and no one should go without seeing this!  The story follows the character, Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo), an ex-con.

Before he went to jail, he told his parents that he was working for the govenment, so they never knew he was arrested. Anyway, on the first day he is released from jail, he temporarily kidnaps a dancer, Layla (Christina Ricci), and presents her to his parents as his wife.  Soon, Layla and Billy fall inlove.

It is an original story about a typical guy who kind of makes a mess out of his life and must live with that fact.  It was written and directed by Vincent Gallo, he also stars and did the music.It's not an extremely high budget movie, but that doesnt matter. the writing and acting are better than most big budget movies. the look and feel of the actors and sets are perfect. the slightly low quality of the film actually adds to the movie(this may be due to the type of film purposely chosen, not that it is poor cinematography, just grainy film)anyway, if you are someone who needs an over the top story or lots of action, you will probably not like this movie. but if you can appreciate an honestly written story based on normal people living in a real world, you will love this movie.  it is very funny and well... uh, its good. here is a plot summary:THIS M0VIE IS GREAT NOT KNOWING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

He's a strange dude but once you get his style of his filmmaking you'll completely appreciate it. His 1998 piece 'Buffalo 66' is art with a capital A. Starring himself and Christina Ricci, the film revolves around Billy Brown, out of prison after 5 years. Billy's seeking revenge against Scott Wood (nods to a former Buffalo Bills kicker, Scott Norwood, who missed a game-winning field goal in Super Bowl XXV against the Giants). He kidnaps Layla to impress his parents (Gazzara and Huston) and she likes it from the get-go. But he doesn't like her. But maybe he does.The beauty of this film is in a few things. The more obvious is, like the controversial 'The Brown Bunny' - is the art direction/cinematography. From the gloomy Buffalo setting to the surreal stop-animation sequence in the strip club the movie emanates artistic originality. Another is that you like Billy Brown even though he's unlikable. You want to see him move on and succeed at something regardless of how much of a loser he is. And Layla was the mystery. Like the mystery I feel when walking lonely through a dirty, soulless city, expecting to encounter only tedium and more loneliness, but hoping to run into a serious, beautiful tapdancer who will love me instantly for no good reason.

62294,A1D3XQC2DIT,0783229585,Peter Shermeta,"[8, 10]","This was a very strange movie which featured Vincent Gallo as Billy Brown. He is released from jail as the movie opens and then we go on a pretty wild ride as he kidnaps a girl who he needs to pose as his wife when he goes to visit his mother before his later plans to find the Buffalo Bills kicker and shoot him. Billy has no direction and he plans to take no responsibility for what happens after this night, until the woman he kidnapped says that she has fallen in love with him. I know what you are thinking, but no, this was not a Disney movie.In my research on the film, many people seem to focus their reviews on how well Gallo captured the essence of life in Buffalo. I have never been to Buffalo, so I will have to find some other angle.My story is a strange one. I came by this movie through a conversation that went something like this:""...What about Mickey Rourke, do you like him?""""Well, I can't say that I have seen him in much that I remember. I thought he was good in Sin City.""""Wow. Come on, he's great. Ummm...have you ever seen Buffalo '66?""""No.""""Do it.""And so I did. And as The Bookie, Mickey Rourke has about 60 seconds of on-screen time. And while I agree that he was awesome for that one minute, I will have to find yet another angle.I guess my focus will be on Vincent Gallo, which is mildly appropriate since he wrote, directed, starred in and composed (at least some of) the music for this movie. I thought he was brilliant in this role as he was held captive inside such a tormented mind. There were some incredibly deeply rooted problems from Billy's past to which were became privy one-by-one. At each confrontation with his parents a short flash-back clip is inserted to show us what happened and essentially how neglected Billy went as a child (I really enjoyed how this was done). He yells at everyone because that is the only way he saw his parents interact, with each other or with him. At the beginning of the movie Billy is a hollow soul full of anger and slowly over the course of the movie the perfect depth is added to his character. And while it doesn't make for the most heart-warming love story, it was somewhat endearing to see that Billy kidnapped the only person who may be crazier than he is.We are given no indication about who Layla is; she was forcefully removed from her tap dancing class against her will by a man with whom she falls in love over a very short period of time. From what we know all they have is each other, but maybe that is enough for them to be happy.Buffalo '66 is a movie I recommend, but not to everyone.

I have not seen a movie this bad in over 10 years. The plot is so disjointed and contradictory I assume they made up the dialog while filming. The characters are so absolutely ridiculous that stupidity is their only believable trait. They are ALL very unintelligent, but even that is not done in a believable way. The cameraman tripped while filming. There are numerous blank spots which may be intended as artsy but have no discernable meaning; I think it is just bad editing. Lighting and sound, to say nothing of any other technical aspects, are worse than a home video. If they paid Christini Ricci (which I doubt) to be in this movie that, along with gas for the moving vehicles, and the blank video tape had to be the only production costs. Other reviewers have mentioned Rosanna Arquette's performance, but she is not in the first 2/3 of the movie so I missed it. The other actors seemed to be stopping to think before they said their stilted lines, and what they said generally made little if any sense. The overall story and plot events might be funny in a college improv class. Unfortunately the movie is intended to be taken seriously (I think). The totally illogical events are full of holes and missing exposition (more bad editing) and your chin must actually drop as you attempt to reason why any people anywhere would do these things.

It is the story of a man who just gets out of jail and is eager to see and please his parents so much, that he goes as far as kidnapping a young woman on the way, to pose as his storybook wife, and play the part in what he elaborates is a storybook romance and marriage.  This woman, played quite well by Christina Ricci, is completely willing to cooperate, and begins to see things from his point of view once the wheels are totally in motion.  Pretending to be the wife of Billy, played just as well by Vincent Gallo, she sees that his parents are disattached, disinterested, and, to put it nicely, lousy.  She begins to see why he wanted to impress them so much -- so that he would actually have their attention for once.  She does her best at posing as the love of his life, and acting as if he is hers.. but, as the movie goes on, you realize that he just might be.  After lying to his parents and telling them that he's in the CIA and was gone for years on business (remember, he just got out of jail), they hit the road and the story continues.At first, you are bothered, angered, and disgusted by Gallo's character.  One of the biggest signs of a good movie is getting you to change such strong opinions towards a character, whether you love them, then hate them, or vice versa (as is the case here).  This movie really makes you think  and glow with empathy towards those of us who haven't had the greatest of childhoods, and the fact that maybe we really did, compared to the hidden evils of parents and people around us that we've no idea of.

This film is so powerful because it throws that very traditional and common theory right out the door.  Gallo's character of Billy is not the type of person to express what he's feeling in endless monologues about life.  He simply yells and awkwardly apologizes.  Does he explain what he feels about Ricci's character?  He doesn't have to.

There's just an overwhelming joy of filmmaking here that makes any technical faults or plot holes quite irrelevant.After a while, Gallo's eccentric little film truly becomes an allegory and begins to operate on an almost mythic level--a `dysfunctional' ballet of sorts, with surreal musical numbers and everything.Christina Ricci's portrayal of Leila, the dreamy-eyed tap dancer, who is kidnapped by Gallo to impress his parents,  and comes to love his severe dysfunction and eccentricity is a modern classic (the funniest female character I've seen since Jane Hamper's ""Junk"" in Todd Solondz' early effort ""Fear, Anxiety, and Depression"").Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston as Gallo's dysfunctional parents are so annoyingly accurate, it hurts. Everyone has either had parents, or known someone who had parents along these lines.The final showdown between Gallo and the hated Buffalo kicker whose missed field goal ruined his life is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.&quot;Buffalo '66&quot; does not go anywhere you think it'll go in terms of its characterizations and is unlike anything else ever made by anyone; it is one of a kind, and so bizzare and annoying,  you can't help but love it.",4,Dysfunctional Ballet,970963200,"10 8, 2000",2000,1511,"['Gallo', 'made', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'sometimes', 'even', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'film', 'here', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'style', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'distinctly', 'original', 'subject', 'matter', 'where', 'implausible', 'situations', 'become', 'irrelevant', 'transcendently', 'plausible', 'light', 'passion', ""'re"", 'rendered', 'just', 'overwhelming', 'joy', 'filmmaking', 'here', 'technical', 'faults', 'plot', 'holes', 'quite', 'irrelevant.After', 'while', 'Gallo', 'eccentric', 'little', 'film', 'truly', 'allegory', 'operate', 'almost', 'mythic', 'level', 'dysfunctional', 'ballet', 'sorts', 'surreal', 'musical', 'numbers', 'everything.Christina', 'Ricci', 'portrayal', 'Leila', 'dreamy-eyed', 'tap', 'dancer', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Gallo', 'impress', 'parents', 'love', 'severe', 'dysfunction', 'eccentricity', 'modern', 'classic', 'funniest', 'female', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jane', 'Hamper', 'Junk', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'early', 'effort', 'Fear', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', '.Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Gallo', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'annoyingly', 'accurate', 'Everyone', 'had', 'parents', 'known', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'parents', 'lines.The', 'final', 'showdown', 'Gallo', 'hated', 'Buffalo', 'kicker', 'missed', 'field', 'goal', 'ruined', 'life', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.', 'quot', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'quot', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'terms', 'characterizations', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'made', 'anyone', 'one', 'kind', 'so', 'bizzare', 'annoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love']",N/A

Betting $10,000 he never had. This guy is a loser in life with horribly self-absorbed parents. I'm sure he was unwanted and definitely unloved. He wants to mean something to them. Vincent Gallo forces Christina Ricci into his life. She's just as lost as he is and reaches out to Gallo. The more you know about this guy, the more you feel sorry for the poor schmuck.I found myself feeling sorry for the two of them but starting losing interest in them half way through the movie. You know these two pathetic people will either end up together in a bad marriage or will drift apart.

He now finds himself released and returning home to visit the parent. He's told them hes making great money, and he has a wife.  Now, how does he find a wife in the matter of a few minutes...oh yeah, kidnap one (christina ricci).  Soon we find out that Billy has grown up in a unique household, and also that he went to jail under unique circumstances.  Finally, how does he reconcile his mind from what he has obsessed about for 5 years with what actually is occuring today.  A decent story, and some good performances, but now that I really objectivly look at it, so much like a film version of a catcher in the rye, but modified a bit, but essentially the same. Substitute Christina ricci's character for Holden's sister, and Billy being Holden Caufield, and walla, a catcher in the rye.

He plays Billy Brown, a lonely man who was just recently released from jail, who's visiting home for the first time in years.  Before he was locked up, he told his estranged parents a pack of lies so they would never know he was in jail, one of those lies was that he married his ""high school sweetheart, Wendy"".  His parent's acceptance is very important to him, so he kidnaps a dancer, Layla (Christina Ricci), to pretend to be his wife Wendy.  Their reunion is full of awkward, sad, and funny moments.As the film progresses, more and more about Billy  Brown's life is revealed, and you really start to sympathize with him.  He and Christina Ricci, both kind of outcasts, fall in love.  I don't want to give anything away because it's really interesting to find out about Gallo's mysterious character Billy through the course of the film.  Everyone was perfectly cast, Angelica Houston was almost unrecognizeable as Billy's mother and Rosanna Arquette's cameo was great.
