Halle Berry does an excellent job as the title character, perfectly conveying her struggles, her hopes, her dreams, her fears, and her courage as a biracial black woman in the 19th century South.  In a world that demeaned African Americans, Queen fought to be seen, heard, and, above all, respected.  There are several emotional scenes that take place throughout the movie, and they can be hard to watch.

Ms Guy is so tiny she could (with stays) fit into it. It was all hand sewn (no sewing machines 'til the 1840's y'know) and made of a beautiful mull (gauze cotton) printed in yellow swirls....a hundred and sixty years old (at the time of shooting)There... some things to look for when you're viewing this expansive narrative.
