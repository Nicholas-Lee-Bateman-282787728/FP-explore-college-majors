347617,A36A9HWQ9U1IK4,6302967562,"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction""","[1, 1]","I love this movie. It has interesting characters, a racy plot and some dark humor. John Lithgow stars as Dr. John Mathewson, a hot-shot physicist who is secretly making plutonium for weapons in a facility disguised for medical applications in Ithaca. He has a thing for his landlady and tries to impress both her and her son Paul with his charms. Little does he realize that Paul is smarter than he thinks. Paul quickly figures out the real purpose of the facility during a tour, steals some plutonium with the help of his girlfriend (Cynthia Nixon) and decides to announce the existence of the facility to the outside world with literally a bang by constructing a workable fission bomb and entering it into a high-school science contest. Unfortunately Lithgow and the military realize that the plutonium is missing and are led to a tense and potentially lethal showdown with Paul.I liked the movie because the characters are not stock. Lithgow is a very three-dimensional person, a charming, sociable and funny scientist who is looking for love, as opposed to a monomaniacal mad scientist who is obsessed with nukes. While the plan that Paul hatches for stealing the plutonium would almost certainly not work in a real situation, it has enough realistic elements to make it sound plausible; for instance he substitutes a bottle of plutonium with identical-looking shampoo and activates the alarms in all the halls by throwing frisbees down them, so the security guard would not know which specific room he is in. He uses a laser to punch a hole in a wall through which he drives the plutonium bottle out of the facility on a remote-controlled toy jeep.The end of the movie makes some fairly thought-provoking statements on the paranoia of nuclear war and deterrence which would especially have been relevant in the 80s during which the movie was made. All in all, an enjoyable movie that could nicely fill up your weekend evening.

If you are holding 99.99% pure Plutonium 239 that could make 70 kiloton Nuclear bombs at a time, would you have only one  guard protecting it?The movie has a lot of merits.  John Lithgow is  very three dimensional, as a hot-shot scientist that is looking for love.  A derivative movie would have made him an egotistical nihilist with no  redeeming features.  But here he plays a person who you root for, even over  the main protagonist at time.The protagonist is Paul Stephens, played by  David Collett.  While very bright, he is not shown  as a social leper or a  total nerd. Cute girls are even attracted to him (portrayed by Cynthia  Nixon of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; fame).If you have a high notion  of suspension of disbelief, then you can forgive the idea of a person  learning to build a working Atom bomb from reading a few books.  And that  two kids could easily break into a highly classified research lab.  And  that scientists could mistake joy dishwater soap for Plutonium for so  long.However, I liked the prepubscent X-files type of conspiracy theme,  especially at the Science Fair.  Also, the last 20 minutes, where they have  to defuse the bomb has surprising intelligence.Even though this movie  is dated (1980's fashion and looks...I can't see this phase making a  comeback...And I was a teen through that era!) it is more intelligent and  smarter than what Hollywood makes today.  While not as good as my favorite  smart teen movie (Real Genius), the Manhattan Project does a good  job....Rating: B-",3,"Unlikely scenario, but good movie.",965520000,"08 6, 2000",2000,1545,"['Why', 'unlikely', 'are', 'holding', '99.99', '%', 'pure', 'Plutonium', '239', 'could', 'make', '70', 'kiloton', 'Nuclear', 'bombs', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'guard', 'protecting', 'movie', 'lot', 'merits', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'very', 'three', 'dimensional', 'hot-shot', 'scientist', 'looking', 'love', 'derivative', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'egotistical', 'nihilist', 'redeeming', 'features', 'here', 'person', 'who', 'root', 'even', 'main', 'protagonist', 'time.The', 'protagonist', 'Paul', 'Stephens', 'played', 'David', 'Collett', 'very', 'bright', 'not', 'shown', 'social', 'leper', 'total', 'nerd', 'Cute', 'girls', 'are', 'even', 'attracted', 'portrayed', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'quot', 'Sex', 'City', 'quot', 'fame', '.If', 'have', 'high', 'notion', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'then', 'can', 'forgive', 'idea', 'person', 'learning', 'build', 'working', 'Atom', 'bomb', 'reading', 'few', 'books', 'two', 'kids', 'could', 'easily', 'break', 'highly', 'classified', 'research', 'lab', 'scientists', 'could', 'mistake', 'joy', 'dishwater', 'soap', 'Plutonium', 'so', 'long.However', 'liked', 'prepubscent', 'X-files', 'type', 'conspiracy', 'theme', 'especially', 'Science', 'Fair', 'Also', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'where', 'have', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'surprising', 'intelligence.Even', 'movie', 'dated', '1980', 'fashion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'phase', 'making', 'comeback', 'was', 'teen', 'era', 'more', 'intelligent', 'smarter', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'favorite', 'smart', 'teen', 'movie', 'Real', 'Genius', 'Manhattan', 'Project', 'good', 'job', '.Rating', 'B-']",N/A
347621,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302967562,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","While the central character in this movie is a teenager, a very smart teenager, it isn't anything like the other ""science fair"" movies you have seen.  True, what the kid does he wants to show at a science fair and the other smart kids there have a bit of a role in the plot in addition to their purpose of adding some color and comic relief.John Lithgow plays Dr. John Matthewson.  A new business moves to town and he befriends Elizabeth Stevens (Jill Eikenberry).  He takes a shine to her brilliant teenage son Paul (Christopher Collet).  One of the interesting aspects of the movie is the suble way we are shown how bright Paul is and how they use his girlfriend to make him very sympathetic and human.  When Paul is given a tour of the facility, he quickly sees through the cover story and decides to expose them.  Now, the plan he concocts is quite over the top, but he decides to build his own, small, atomic bomb.Paul's girlfriend, Jenny Anderman (Cynthia Nixon), helps him by distracting some folks while Paul gets his hands on the key ingredient.  Again, what Paul then goes through in attempting to build the device is quite interesting, but not really possible for even a genius without very specialized equipment.  It isn't the kind of stuff one can simply build on one's own.  But we suspend disbelief for the movie.Things escalate and the final sequence, of course, involves Matthewson and Paul and a bunch of government types inside the facility.  This is where the plot has to ride on our sympathy for Paul.  In real life, I would suspect, and in fact I would hope that once the realized that Paul hadn't yet armed his device that they would kill him before he could.  But that would be too harsh for a Hollywood movie.  One simply doesn't kill good boys who have done something stupid even if they are going to accidentally on purpose blow up an entire city and poison a couple of small states downwind.Still, it is a pretty good thriller and Lithgow and Eikenberry bring good adult maturity to the story without becoming villains or fools.  I enjoyed that.  And Collet and Nixon do have a very caring and human relationship.  While the movie isn't, in the end, realistic, it isn't a cartoon either.A quite good movie that still holds up after the cold war.

347623,A1UDGFXGUOMM3R,6302967562,"James M. Fitzwilliam ""Pianist/Composer""","[0, 0]","This movie has been a personal favorite since I first saw it on HBO in the 1980s, enough that I bought a copy on Laserdisc, when there still were such things!A generic recipe for any decent movie might run along these lines: Take some interesting and/or sympathetic characters, put them in a situation that challenges them and their attitudes, and see what they do. Here we have the light-hearted high school genius (who stumbles upon a secret nuclear weapons lab in his town, and wonders what to do about it); his socially-conscious political-activist girlfriend; and a government scientist for whom ultra-purification of Plutonium is an abstract, intellectual challenge (until he finds himself in a situation where the end product might kill actual people that he knows).People who dislike this movie generally have a complaint either with its plausibility, or its tone.  OK, plausibility first.  The weapons lab is &quot;hidden in plain sight.&quot;  An obvious high security presence would call unwanted attention to it; instead, it is disguised as a medical facility. (When I was in high school, my band teacher had some tape recorders that he used for students to record and listen to themselves in the practice room, etc. He kept these thrown in a big cardboard box, right out in the open, and each unit had scrawled on it: BROKEN. Not a single one was ever stolen. Same strategy here.) And the techniques that our young student hero uses to break into the lab are all well-established earlier in the film, including the fact that he can throw a mean Frisbee.Yes, it requires some suspension of disbelief, but no more so than most other movies. At least an attempt is made to explain the events and make them seem logical. (My one minor peeve: Every time I see this film, I keep telling our young hero on the screen not to hold that unshielded weapons-grade Plutonium so close to his HEAD, but he never listens to me! Oh well.)As far as tone goes, it has been said that this film is too light and cheerful, given its plot elements. One musician friend of mine commented, as we watched young Paul build his device, that &quot;This [cheery underscoring music] doesn't sound like Music To Build A Nuclear Bomb By.&quot;  My response to my friend was: The music is not for the bomb, it is for young Paul!  He is having fun building a complex gadget, without any evil or underhanded purpose, and the character of the music represents his frame of mind very nicely.  (I should add here that I like the musical score of this film overall, especially the just-mentioned building-the-bomb sequence, and the opening title music, which has just the right undertone of suspense in it.)It seems that even the movie studio is confused by this film's tone.  The Laserdisc release had, very cheezily pasted onto the film, a subtitle, making the name &quot;The Manhattan Project: The Deadly Game&quot;, presumably to make the film sound darker and scarier.  It didn't work.  Nor does this film need to be dark and scary to do what it is trying to do.  I was very happy to see that the DVD no longer has this lame subtitle.What it comes down to: This film is not about the bomb, it is about the characters and how they react to the unfolding situation.  The bomb is merely The Crisis that motivates the film's action. I for one like the characters, and I like the actors portraying them.  (In particular, it is refreshing to see John Lithgow playing a friendly character for once, rather than a psychotic wacko, as he does in Cliffhanger, for example.)I also appreciate that young Paul is not portrayed as a geeky, outcast nerd. He is charming, athletic, and not afraid of girls. This sets up some humorous moments when he meets some actual nerds later in the film. (Favorite quote: &quot;Why are you helping us?&quot; &quot;Because life, my dear, is more than freezing toads.&quot;)I for one recommend The Manhattan Project.  It may not be in the Top Ten Films Of All Time, but I think it deserves a solid four stars.DVD transfer quality seems decent, and is definitely at least as good as the laserdisc version. No extra disc features to speak of, really, just a theatrical trailer.

He's able to lift the heavy core sphere with a tiny magnet? He's being bombarded with radiation during his various activities and isn't being poisoned? He's able to precisely set all the laser mirrors up on his first shot?There's never any real sense that Paul has some sort of mission to save his town. He's just having fun making a science fair project which could easily kill everyone in his neighborhood because of his shoddy efforts. In Real Genius the team would have been precisely aware of what they were working on and taken every precaution to keep things safe. Paul just laughs while playing with radioactivity. In War Games Matthew Broderick faces his death, and you can feel what he is about to lose. In this movie, Paul whines about not getting to be on stage for his fair.Some have said this movie displays the depth of emotions of the cold war. This was set in 1984!! I was a teenager in 1984. For us the cold war was ancient history. This was an era of MTV and computer bulletin board systems. We were having fun posting on forums with our Apple IIs and dancing to Thriller. We weren't worried at all about Russia. Seabrook Nuclear Power was nearly done being built in New Hampshire to help provide energy. Again, War Games and Real Genuis provide far more realistic scenarios about what was going on in this time frame.If you're going to watch this kind of movie, absolutely watch War Games and Real Genius. And then, if you must, watch this movie to see how it compares with those two.Rating: 3/5",3,Watch War Games and Real Genius instead,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,2347,"['had', 'just', 'watched', 'Amadeus', 'again', 'were', 'commenting', 'how', 'young', 'Cynthia', 'Dixon', 'Sex', 'City', 'fame', 'looked', 'when', 'happened', 'Manhattan', 'Project', 'adored', 'War', 'Games', 'Real', 'Genius', 'time', 'frame', 'portrayed', 'here', 'mid-80s', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'view', 'teen', 'kids', 'taking', 'government.Wow', 'what', 'painful', 'experience', 'was', 'fun', 'admit', 'watching', 'Wilson', 'House', 'opening', 'sequences', 'puppy-dog', 'eyes', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'cute', 'teenage', 'boy', 'then', 'things', 'quickly', 'degenerate', 'How', 'world', 'Paul', 'get', 'top-secret', 'installation', 'only', 'single', 'guard', 'using', 'frisbee', 'How', 'world', 'did', 'memorize', 'exact', 'color', 'green', 'order', 'replicate', 'plutonium', 'nobody', 'swap', 'instantly', 'how', 'program', 'robots', 'able', 'lift', 'heavy', 'core', 'sphere', 'tiny', 'magnet', 'being', 'bombarded', 'radiation', 'various', 'activities', ""n't"", 'being', 'poisoned', 'able', 'precisely', 'set', 'laser', 'up', 'first', 'shot', 'never', 'real', 'sense', 'Paul', 'sort', 'mission', 'save', 'town', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'making', 'science', 'fair', 'project', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'everyone', 'neighborhood', 'shoddy', 'efforts', 'Real', 'Genius', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'precisely', 'aware', 'what', 'were', 'working', 'taken', 'precaution', 'keep', 'things', 'safe', 'Paul', 'just', 'playing', 'radioactivity', 'War', 'Games', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'death', 'can', 'feel', 'what', 'lose', 'movie', 'Paul', 'not', 'getting', 'be', 'stage', 'fair.Some', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'depth', 'emotions', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'set', '1984', 'was', 'teenager', '1984', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'ancient', 'history', 'was', 'era', 'MTV', 'computer', 'bulletin', 'board', 'systems', 'were', 'having', 'fun', 'posting', 'forums', 'Apple', 'IIs', 'dancing', 'Thriller', 'were', ""n't"", 'worried', 'Russia', 'Seabrook', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'was', 'nearly', 'done', 'being', 'built', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'help', 'provide', 'energy', 'Again', 'War', 'Games', 'Real', 'Genuis', 'provide', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'scenarios', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'frame.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'kind', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'watch', 'War', 'Games', 'Real', 'Genius', 'then', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'two.Rating', '3/5']",N/A
347627,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,6302967562,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[3, 4]","When ""The Manhattan Project"" was first released back in 1986, I was still just a little kid back then. But now, I checked out the film at the video store and I thought that it was so entertaining that it would keep you on the edge of your seat from pulse-pounding start to breathtaking finish! As far as the direction is concerned, Marshall Brickman (screenwriter for ""Intersection"") directed this film with sheer intensity all the way, and that is what I like about films like this. And as far as the performances go, a lot of the credit goes to John Lithgow (""Cliffhanger""), Christopher Collet (""Prayer of the Rollerboys""), and Cynthia Nixon (""Sex and the City"") for their excellent performances. The film focuses on an overachieving high school student named Paul Stephens (Collet), who decides to infiltrate a research lab facility to steal a bottle of plutonium from John Mathewson (Lithgow), a government scientist who is dating his mother (Jill Eikenberry, ""Arthur""), in order to make a nuclear device for his science fair with the help of his girlfriend Jenny (Nixon). When word gets out about the plutonium being stolen, the military is being called in to investigate, and Paul is really in for the nightmare ride of his life! And, pretty much, the only person who can help Paul is Dr. Mathewson as they put both their lives on the line in order to keep the device from nuclear annihilation of everyone within a 10-mile radius. In closing, this film has it all! A great cast, superb storytelling, and suspense that doesn't let up for a minute make ""The Manhattan Project"" one of the absolute best and thought-provoking thrillers of 1986!

347628,AYYOPF6RG019D,6302967562,The Mechanic,"[6, 6]","I love this movie.  I agree with several of the points made by other reviewers.  One, there is a certain amount of suspending disbelief that one must do to enjoy it.  Two, and absolutely on the mark, this is a character driven movie, not plot driven.  Three, this isn't a movie to be deeply analyzed.  It's an 80s movie with witty/sarcastic humor and a plot that works best if you like the main characters.  'War Games' is a better all around movie, but after repeated viewings, I like watching Christopher Collet more than Matthew Broderick (Plus, I can't stand looking at Ally Sheedy, IN ANYTHING!!!).  To me, this is an afterschool special-type movie (remember those???).  It's weird, but I always watch this movie as if I was 16 years old (which is about how old I was when it came out).  I don't even have to try, it just happens.
