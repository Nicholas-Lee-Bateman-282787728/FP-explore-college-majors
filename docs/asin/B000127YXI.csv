791140,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000127YXI,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","This wonderful 1998 Swedish story is about love and friendship, captures compassion and is laced with humor.  It takes place in the 50's.  One important fact about this movie was that the casting of characters was superb, and that is what makes a good movie, the characters.Swedish film director Colin Nutley's Under the Sun is based on a short story of English author H.E. Bates, The Little Farm.  Bates wrote numerous novels and short stories mostly based in English.Shy and illiterate Olaf, 40ish, lives alone on the farm since his mother died.  Lonely, he puts an ad in the newspaper for a housekeeper.  The requirement in the ad is that the housekeeper be young and he must see a picture.  A beautiful woman, Ellen, answers the ad.Meanwhile, Olaf has a friend Erik, who is sly, cunning, womanizer, and takes advantage of Olaf financially.  Erik is always up to no good and sometimes works on the farm.That Ellen falls for Olaf is no surprise, as we learn Olaf is tender, a virgin, and had a dear heart for his mother.  And it's up to Ellen to make the first moves.Ellen soon learns of the wrongdoings by Erik and warns him.  Erik is threatened that his place in Olaf's life is jeopardized and he  tries to ruin the relationship Ellen has with Olaf by exposing her past.This movie has beautiful cinematography.  The coloring is unique.  This is a feel-good love story, more on the predictable side.....Rizz",5,A compassionate  feel-good love story,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1410,"['wonderful', '1998', 'Swedish', 'story', 'love', 'friendship', 'compassion', 'laced', 'humor', 'place', '50', 'One', 'important', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'casting', 'characters', 'was', 'superb', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'characters.Swedish', 'film', 'director', 'Colin', 'Nutley', 'Sun', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'English', 'author', 'H.E', 'Bates', 'Little', 'Farm', 'Bates', 'wrote', 'numerous', 'novels', 'short', 'stories', 'mostly', 'based', 'English.Shy', 'illiterate', 'Olaf', '40ish', 'alone', 'farm', 'mother', 'died', 'Lonely', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'housekeeper', 'requirement', 'ad', 'housekeeper', 'be', 'young', 'must', 'see', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Ellen', 'ad.Meanwhile', 'Olaf', 'friend', 'Erik', 'who', 'sly', 'cunning', 'womanizer', 'advantage', 'Olaf', 'financially', 'Erik', 'always', 'up', 'good', 'sometimes', 'farm.That', 'Ellen', 'Olaf', 'surprise', 'learn', 'Olaf', 'tender', 'virgin', 'had', 'dear', 'heart', 'mother', 'up', 'Ellen', 'make', 'first', 'moves.Ellen', 'soon', 'learns', 'wrongdoings', 'Erik', 'Erik', 'threatened', 'place', 'Olaf', 'life', 'jeopardized', 'ruin', 'relationship', 'Ellen', 'Olaf', 'exposing', 'past.This', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'coloring', 'unique', 'feel-good', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'predictable', 'side', '..Rizz']",Under the Sun
791141,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B000127YXI,e1x56u$*w#,"[7, 8]","This is another recent foreign film which just blows anything Hollywood has put out in recent years right out of the water.Rolf Lassgrd is lovable as the big lug Olof, a 40-something virgin out to fulfill his mother's dying wish that he get himself a lady. But hopelessly shy and awkward, his only method of reaching out is to put an ad in a local paper seeking a live-in maid.Director Colin Nutley casts his own wife, the wholesomely radiant Helena Bergstr&ouml;m, in the role of Ellen, the mysterious and enchanting woman who comes to the remote farm to take the job.Also on the scene is Olof's friend Erik, a cocky young man who has been to America and fancies himself a man of the world. We are thrown off balance at the beginning of the film by Erik's seemingly unnatural interest in Olof's new living arrangements, but by the end of the film we come to understand him and see him for just what he is.Nutley takes things slow, and what I really enjoyed about this movie was the very low-key and understated way that an erotic tension was allowed to gradually build up between the three. Very refreshing to those of us overdosed on Hollywood's in-your-face, over-the-top directness these days.Plot complications naturally ensue, but the honesty of the ending will have you cheering.All I can say is, thank goodness there are still places on this planet where people are not infected with the cynical sarcasm so prevalent in our North American culture today, and are not afraid of genuine emotions.

I heard Andy Griffith explain on a late night talk show that ""Mayberry RFD"" would NEVER be aired on TV today. Andy reminded us that those were tales of a simple people in a tiny town, with Nothing like ballistic males, or femme fatales, cruelly advancing their tokens to Boardwalk and opulent Park Place...like ""Dirty Sexy Money"".  Apparently, our descent into amoral subterfuge and cruel scheming is what we have all come to think of as 'delightful entertainment'.  Andy spoke of a scene with He and Barney Fife sitting on the porch- Barney fuming, as usual, and in silence-which went on for  40 seconds or so. This would NEVER happen on TV today. Well here is such a movie about a very simple farmer who places an ad in the paper for a 'housekeeper'-in fact a secret hope to meet a woman and bring an end to his endless lonliness. Enter a mysterious and stunning woman, just as simple and laconic as our farmer. Add one Swedish rock music fan of the fifites, complete with red 57 Ford convertible, who is actually the only 'bad guy' in the movie..and he ain't so very bad...bad enough, though. A whole lot of us have tried just such a ploy to end our own lonliness. For some of us, who took such a nutty chance, we succeeded. I'll let you watch the movie and see for yourself if there is any hope for true love to take place here. There may not be. But there is nothing wrong with hoping and trying. It's worse NOT to try .

Awkwardly Olof approaches the whole matter with difficulty as he is illiterate for which he suffers in silent shame.  Despite his anxiety he goes through the process with the whole village being aware of his add in the personals.  Olof receives two responses, but he responds to the letter from the beautiful Ellen (Helena Bergstr&ouml;m) as it contains a photo.  When Ellen arrives Olof is extremely nervous as he doubts that she will take the job as a maid.  However, she is willing to take the job without delay to Olof's astonishment.  Olof's friend, Erik (Johan Widerberg), is on the other hand very suspicious about Ellen and what her scheme is as she seems to be out of her environment.  Under the Sun is a warm and sensitive film about insecurities and love as the audience ventures with Olof through his social dilemmas.  This social journey is enhanced by Rolf Lassgrd's amazing performance as the big farmer that has a very limited life experience from outside the farm.

Olaf can't even read the IOU notes Eric gives him now and then.Olaf, shy and socially awkward, has been alone since his mother's death a decade earlier. There's nothing weird about his love for his mother; you don't get the sense he's a momma's boy. It's just that, way out at the end of the road, there's not much opportunity to meet women. So he puts an ad in a big newspaper for `a housekeeper.'Enter: Ellen. Obviously a city girl, in her fitted suit, upswept French twist, and high heels. And obviously, she has a past, a secret, a hidden flaw, because otherwise, why would this urbane woman be answering an ad to go live on a remote farm?Eric, jealous and fearful that his abuse of Olaf's trust will be discovered, determines to discover Ellen's secret.That's enough of a set-up to get you started on your way to the video store to rent this absolutely beautiful, redemptive movie.

As I watched it unfold, I realized that it was it's own, unique and beautifully presented film.  Its' title means to tell us that there is nothing new under the sun and that this is just another love story.  That may well be true but we come away in appreciation of the quality in this film that leaves us thinking that this is indeed something special (and it is!).  What really makes this movie work is the main character Olof who comes across so well as the 42-year old vigin.  Olof is rather oafish but sincere and he is in need of something he's never had.  However, the 4-letter ""L"" word he is looking for is love, not lust.  He tries the only method that this bachelor farmer can come up with; he advertizes for a housekeeper.  We've already guessed what the story is after the first few minutes but the characters, the situations, and the contrast of sincerity and insincerity keep us focussed for the entire movie.  The ending is a bit of an emotional roller coaster but it does not disappoint us.  There is a periodic and brief interlude of something in flight that puzzled me until its' last appearance when I realized it was to serve as a barometer of Olof's temperment.This movie is a bit crude at times which eliminates it from any consideration as a ""Family Film"".

791150,A3CH1KT8XQE8SA,B000127YXI,"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[4, 7]","Set in the Swedish countryside during the 1950's, UNDER THE SUN is a story about friendship, betrayal, and love. Olof is a simple farmer who has been living alone since his mother passed away nine years old. His only friend, Erik, is a slick twenty-something who takes advantage of Olof's friendship and his inability to read. In an effort for female company Olof puts an ad in the paper for a young cleaning woman (photograph requested). Ellen, an exquisite and beautiful bombshell, answers Olof's ad with a desire to live in the country. She has a challenge ahead of her, as Olof's house is completely dirty. But while she begins her cleaning tasks she is frequently interrupted by the longing stares and conversation of Olof and Erik. Both seem to be unable to resist her charm and beauty. As a result of Ellen, Olof and Erik's friendship is strained. Ellen doesn't believe Erik's actions are altruistic while Erik questions the intentions of Ellen. As the film progresses both men fall in love with Ellen which only complicates their lives.The cinematography is beautiful. Situated in the Swedish countryside with rolling green hills and winding roads that appear to go nowhere, the viewer is easily entranced with the landscape. Hallmarks of life in Scandinavia are plenty. Set during the summertime the character go to bed at 9pm while the sun still shines. Despite the cinematography the significance of the intermediate shots of fighter jets and planes in the sky lost me. I could not make a connection between those scenes and the film itself.

791151,A2EC7QX2XCSNZW,B000127YXI,"Sharad Yadav ""shayad""","[2, 2]","Olof is a ~40 year old pastoral farmer who leads a life full of solitude in a sun drenched Swedish village. One fine day, he publishes an advertisement in the local daily seeking a housekeeper (young woman specifically) to help him with the upkeep of his farmhouse. Interestingly, he requests for a picture also.Olof has a smart alec friend in the form of Erik who doubles up as a gravedigger & horse better. He feeds on Olof's ignorance, under the guider of a good friend; he borrows money that he uses for betting and making a quick buck.Ellen, a city woman who is presumably running away from some personal problems responds to Olof's classified advertisement and decides to stay at his farm. This marks the beginning of a happy chapter for Olof and a jealous chapter for Erik. Predictably, Olof falls for Ellen, who reciprocates his love back (much to the chagrin of Erik). The story meanders along and in the very end Olof & Ellen are united and Erik is sent packing.The story by itself does not make the cut. This movie must be watched for the stunning cinematography and Olof `s(Rolf Lassgrd) acting. The long panoramic shots of the lush green Swedish countryside, the close-ups, the real-life dialogs and the wonderful acting make this movie a wonderful movie experience.",4,Cinematographic coup ...,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1279,"['Olof', '~40', 'year', 'old', 'pastoral', 'farmer', 'who', 'life', 'full', 'solitude', 'sun', 'drenched', 'Swedish', 'village', 'One', 'fine', 'day', 'advertisement', 'local', 'daily', 'seeking', 'housekeeper', 'young', 'woman', 'specifically', 'help', 'upkeep', 'farmhouse', 'Interestingly', 'picture', 'also.Olof', 'smart', 'alec', 'friend', 'form', 'Erik', 'who', 'up', 'gravedigger', 'horse', 'better', 'Olof', 'ignorance', 'guider', 'good', 'friend', 'money', 'betting', 'making', 'quick', 'buck.Ellen', 'city', 'woman', 'who', 'presumably', 'running', 'away', 'personal', 'problems', 'Olof', 'classified', 'advertisement', 'stay', 'farm', 'beginning', 'happy', 'chapter', 'Olof', 'jealous', 'chapter', 'Erik', 'Predictably', 'Olof', 'Ellen', 'who', 'love', 'back', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Erik', 'story', 'meanders', 'very', 'end', 'Olof', 'Ellen', 'are', 'united', 'Erik', 'sent', 'packing.The', 'story', 'not', 'make', 'cut', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Olof', 's', 'Rolf', 'Lassgrd', 'acting', 'long', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'lush', 'green', 'Swedish', 'countryside', 'close-ups', 'real-life', 'dialogs', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'make', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'experience']",Under the Sun
