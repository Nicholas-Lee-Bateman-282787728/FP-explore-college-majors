1093522,AEY5446FF1ZNO,B000U1ZV8U,bob e.,"[1, 3]","well, 4 reviewers for this 4-pack of comedy actor giants. its tough to put out consistently great comedies. for every planes, trains and automobiles or what about bob?, there are half-accomplished tries that either lose their studio's money or drag their audiences through malaise. its not a perfect science, but comedy is our most merciful and forgiving of the competitive acting arts in terms of audience satisfaction. traces of insightful humor must be threaded into a producible congruence of talent, story, character-interest, actors' shtick, compatibility, presence, conditions, prospects. comedies often provide attitudinal bulwarks against unwelcome intrusion by society ('others') into the individual's conciousness and comfort with differentiated identity traits. we just keep bumping into each other at intense rates and exposure to others' inadequate degrees of consideration and behavioral missteps. we are regularly upset and yearning for relaxed ('mature') perspective.  >>>if a list of the top 500 comedies were created and someone watched each one and consolidated their feelings and contentment into ratings, memories of excluded movies would remind us that the effort to be funny, done energetically is a vague but recognizable asset to our intellect and emotions. in fact, what would be the spiritual 'purpose' of idiocy outside of real medical issues if not for audiences to mine its humor for consolation to relieve the oppressive, mundane, dull aspects of life.  >>>these 3 great movies (their premises and casting especially shine), and 1 weak follow-up to a major comedy movie - national lampoon's vacation represent especially-important moments in the creative development of steve martin, bill murray, and dan ackroyd. chevy chase was already a hit with caddyshack and vacation, and uses a 'don't hog the screen' modest acting style that encouraged supporting-character development to create an intimate ambience that preceded the great ben stiller,etc. comedic styles now storming the theaters/televisions.  >>>i compare these four movies to the eddie murphy vehicle, adventures of pluto nash in terms of advancement of comedy premises. faith, as a quality, is often negative in activity and needs channelling into making others happy and feeling important in this big, clumsy world. my faith comes to the discernable 'surface' experiencing the efforts everyone involved in these movies made, and i lay back and carefully watch every piece of 4 movies i consider essential to understanding life in our complex existence. enjoy them to the hilt, and teach others what really counts. toodles.",5,"murray, martin, chase & ackroyd: top film comedians",1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,2618,"['well', '4', 'reviewers', '4-pack', 'comedy', 'actor', 'giants', 'tough', 'put', 'out', 'consistently', 'great', 'comedies', 'planes', 'trains', 'automobiles', 'what', 'bob', 'are', 'half-accomplished', 'tries', 'lose', 'studio', 'money', 'drag', 'audiences', 'malaise', 'not', 'perfect', 'science', 'comedy', 'most', 'merciful', 'forgiving', 'competitive', 'acting', 'arts', 'terms', 'audience', 'satisfaction', 'traces', 'insightful', 'humor', 'must', 'be', 'threaded', 'producible', 'congruence', 'talent', 'story', 'character-interest', 'actors', 'shtick', 'compatibility', 'presence', 'conditions', 'prospects', 'comedies', 'often', 'provide', 'attitudinal', 'bulwarks', 'unwelcome', 'intrusion', 'society', ""'others"", 'individual', 'conciousness', 'comfort', 'differentiated', 'identity', 'traits', 'just', 'keep', 'bumping', 'other', 'intense', 'rates', 'exposure', 'others', 'inadequate', 'degrees', 'consideration', 'behavioral', 'missteps', 'are', 'regularly', 'upset', 'yearning', 'relaxed', ""'mature"", 'perspective', '>', '>', 'list', 'top', '500', 'comedies', 'were', 'created', 'someone', 'watched', 'one', 'consolidated', 'feelings', 'contentment', 'ratings', 'memories', 'excluded', 'movies', 'would', 'remind', 'effort', 'be', 'funny', 'done', 'energetically', 'vague', 'recognizable', 'asset', 'intellect', 'emotions', 'fact', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'spiritual', ""'purpose"", 'idiocy', 'real', 'medical', 'issues', 'not', 'audiences', 'mine', 'humor', 'consolation', 'relieve', 'oppressive', 'mundane', 'dull', 'aspects', 'life', '>', '>', '3', 'great', 'movies', 'premises', 'casting', 'especially', 'shine', '1', 'weak', 'follow-up', 'major', 'comedy', 'movie', 'national', 'lampoon', 'vacation', 'represent', 'especially-important', 'moments', 'creative', 'development', 'steve', 'martin', 'bill', 'murray', 'dan', 'ackroyd', 'chevy', 'chase', 'was', 'already', 'hit', 'caddyshack', 'vacation', ""'do"", ""n't"", 'hog', 'screen', 'modest', 'acting', 'style', 'encouraged', 'supporting-character', 'development', 'create', 'intimate', 'ambience', 'preceded', 'great', 'ben', 'stiller', 'etc', 'comedic', 'styles', 'now', 'storming', 'theaters/televisions', '>', '>', '>', 'i', 'compare', 'four', 'movies', 'eddie', 'murphy', 'vehicle', 'adventures', 'pluto', 'nash', 'terms', 'advancement', 'comedy', 'premises', 'faith', 'quality', 'often', 'negative', 'activity', 'channelling', 'making', 'others', 'happy', 'feeling', 'important', 'big', 'clumsy', 'world', 'faith', 'discernable', ""'surface"", 'experiencing', 'efforts', 'everyone', 'involved', 'movies', 'made', 'i', 'lay', 'back', 'carefully', 'watch', 'piece', '4', 'movies', 'i', 'consider', 'essential', 'understanding', 'life', 'complex', 'existence', 'enjoy', 'hilt', 'teach', 'others', 'what', 'really', 'toodles']","4 Film Favorites: Classic Comedies (The Man Who Knew Too Little, The Man with Two Brains, Spies Like Us, Vegas Vacation)"

Instead, what you are getting are four C grade comedies that are just not that great. So far they are not listed in the product description, so here they are:1. The Man with Two Brains (1983) - 3/5 - Stars Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner. This is one of those comedies that Steve Martin was making pre-Roxanne that somewhat missed the mark by trading funny for silly. Martin plays a brain surgeon who marries a beautiful woman and finds out too late her favorite hobby is tormenting men.2. Spies Like Us (1985) - 3/5 - Stars Chevy Chase and Dan Akroyd. Chase and Akroyd star as two government employees caught cheating on a civil service exam that end up being recruited as decoy spies to draw out the Soviet defenses in Afghanistan. It's just not very well done considering the talent of the leads.3. Vegas Vacation (1997) - 2/5 - I really liked the original Vacation and the Christmas Vacation movies, but by now the concept was really tired, and Chevy Chase just seems to be going through the motions.4. The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) - 3/5 - Stars Bill Murray. Murray plays an American in London who mistakes real international intrigue with an audience participation game that he thinks he is playing. This is the only truly funny film of the four.",3,4 comedies that aren't that classic,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,1361,"['not', 'A', 'List', 'comedy', 'films', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'released', 'recently', 'distant', 'past', 'Instead', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'are', 'four', 'C', 'grade', 'comedies', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'So', 'far', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'product', 'description', 'so', 'here', 'are:1', 'Man', 'Two', 'Brains', '1983', '3/5', 'Stars', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'one', 'comedies', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'making', 'pre-Roxanne', 'somewhat', 'missed', 'mark', 'trading', 'funny', 'silly', 'Martin', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'who', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'out', 'too', 'late', 'favorite', 'hobby', 'tormenting', 'men.2', 'Spies', 'Us', '1985', '3/5', 'Stars', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'Chase', 'Akroyd', 'star', 'two', 'government', 'employees', 'caught', 'cheating', 'civil', 'service', 'exam', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'recruited', 'decoy', 'spies', 'draw', 'out', 'Soviet', 'defenses', 'Afghanistan', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'talent', 'leads.3', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', '1997', '2/5', 'really', 'liked', 'original', 'Vacation', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'movies', 'now', 'concept', 'was', 'really', 'tired', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'motions.4', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Little', '1997', '3/5', 'Stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Murray', 'American', 'London', 'who', 'real', 'international', 'intrigue', 'audience', 'participation', 'game', 'playing', 'only', 'truly', 'funny', 'film', 'four']","4 Film Favorites: Classic Comedies (The Man Who Knew Too Little, The Man with Two Brains, Spies Like Us, Vegas Vacation)"
