851736,AH93HX89KVQG2,B0002YLCH4,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[31, 40]","The original Mulan is one of my favorite Disney movies. I wasn't sure what to expect with Mulan II, but I didn't expect it to make me angry! But it did. I am not Chinese, but I know and admire much about their culture, particularly the high value they place on honor and duty to others outside of yourself. This movie openly puts down and mocks those values, as well as the ancient tradition of arranged marriages which still exists today in many cultures. To me, this movie was a fine example of typical Western arrogance, thinking 'our' way is the only right way to live.In the original movie, Mulan takes great personal risk to save her father's life, and then to save her country. In the second movie, her philosophy seems to be just the opposite: fulfill yourself even if it endangers the country and others. The script writers didn't see the contradiction, because both actions require the ability to think independently and 'outside the box' which they hold up as being the 'ultimate virtue.' But it is not a virtue when done for selfish reasons.Mushu was completely annoying with the miscommunications he caused between Mulan and Shang in his selfish attempt to break up their engagement so he could remain her guardian. These scenes were frustrating, not funny.The only redeeming features were the cute, catchy songs and some great humor. And the animation was actually quite good; a lot better than most of Disney's straight-to-video 'sequels.' But to me, it's not worth giving the wrong message to your kids. American society already places too much importance on self-fulfillment over all else, and we don't need a kid's movie teaching our kids the message of 'self first' too!",1,Insults Chinese culture and values,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,1689,"['original', 'Mulan', 'one', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Mulan', 'II', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'angry', 'did', 'am', 'not', 'Chinese', 'know', 'admire', 'much', 'culture', 'particularly', 'high', 'value', 'place', 'honor', 'duty', 'others', 'yourself', 'movie', 'openly', 'down', 'mocks', 'values', 'as', 'well', 'ancient', 'tradition', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'still', 'today', 'many', 'cultures', 'movie', 'was', 'fine', 'example', 'typical', 'Western', 'arrogance', 'thinking', ""'our"", 'way', 'only', 'right', 'way', 'live.In', 'original', 'movie', 'Mulan', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'save', 'father', 'life', 'then', 'save', 'country', 'second', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'be', 'just', 'opposite', 'fulfill', 'even', 'country', 'others', 'script', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'contradiction', 'actions', 'require', 'ability', 'think', 'independently', ""'outside"", 'box', 'hold', 'up', 'being', ""'ultimate"", 'virtue', 'not', 'virtue', 'when', 'done', 'selfish', 'reasons.Mushu', 'was', 'completely', 'annoying', 'miscommunications', 'caused', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'selfish', 'attempt', 'break', 'up', 'engagement', 'could', 'remain', 'guardian', 'scenes', 'were', 'frustrating', 'not', 'only', 'redeeming', 'features', 'were', 'cute', 'catchy', 'songs', 'great', 'humor', 'animation', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'Disney', 'straight-to-video', ""'sequels"", 'not', 'worth', 'giving', 'wrong', 'message', 'kids', 'American', 'society', 'already', 'too', 'much', 'importance', 'self-fulfillment', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'kid', 'movie', 'teaching', 'kids', 'message', 'first', 'too']",N/A

The story was funny though, it couldn't be compare with the original!Well, as a Chinese, I don't like this movie, even I can say I hate this! I've heard the tale of Mulan when I was a little girl, and I thought she was brave and I adored her. It was a traditional tale of a famous heroine of China, and it's still unforgettable to every Chinese. But this movie not only insulted the tale but also insulted Chinese culture!!! It made Mulan's tale so strange and exagerrated everything! At first, I thought this movie was not so bad, but after I thought about it over and over again, I began to feel uncomfortable and angry! Many of my friends don't like this movie either. The tableuas of the movie weren't as good as the original ""Mulan"". Every old character in ""Mulan-2"" was very different from how they used to be in the original! In other words, they looked rather ugly! Especially Shang, I could hardly believe that my favourite character in the original became such a strange and ugly person! To my surprise, but only a little, the new characters, the 3 princesses were cute, however, not very I think. What's more, they and the 3 soldiers were together! It was impossible in that dynasty! It felt so strange, I don't like this!!!But to my excitement, Lea Salonga returned to this continuation. Her voice was one of my favourites. The song ""Lesson Number One"" she performed was the greatest song in this movie, and the children chorus was wonderful too. Judy Kuhn, whose voice was as Pocahontas performed a song ""Like Other Girls"" in this movie, and it was good.However, this movie was not good, sometimes I think it's rather bad! Please don't watch this if the original gave you a good impression, and if you think Chinese culture was grand!",1,Not much of a good movie!

(my foot!! they couldn't even finish the job of delivering three princesses, talk about a mission bigger than saving china!)I watched the movie three times and wrote this review according to the scenes in and orderly fashion. PLEASE READ and don't waste your money on this rip off.Beginning..Cheap beginning, too fast and not flowing gracefully like the first.Animation is horrible, totally different than the first.Mulan doing chores in the field like a boy? she's even dressed too masculine and the fighting scene.She looks totally awful and her features and facial movements are totally off, it's like she's not even the same person!Teaching little girls how to fight, ha?Songs are totally awful and uncreative.It looks like the kids are at least 14 when she's teaching them and then when Shang shows up they're only just a handful.Shang has self esteem issues from the moment he appears in the movie, in the first one however he is brave and knows what he's doing.  Ok.. even love can't make you that ""stupid""He looks doubtful when she calls him ""brave"".Proposal scene is so dumb, she drags into the garden, sits down as if expecting him to propose yet she sounds surprised when he instantly kneels down in front of her, it's all too fast and lacks emotion.The characters facial expressions are so wacky!Mulan's manners changed a lot, the way she dared speak up at the emperor..Since when did Ling become such a joker??? The joke thing is just a bit out of control.Mulan and her first little chat with the princesses..  she sounds like she was just born yesterday and knows nothing about Chinese culture of anything the way she's questioning them.""DUTY to my heart"" I don't get what she means by that when Shang and her ride side by side on horseback, what does she think she can do, and why all of a sudden it all sounds so strange to her when someone else is putting duty ahead of their personal feelings  (just like what SHE DID in the first movie) ..  sounds like she's trying to prevent everyone else from doing what she did.The princesses, I don't know what to say about them, falling in love with those guards so quickly, it's just so dumb and after they agreed to go through with their mission.Operation shang is a disaster, I get the tricks mushu played on him, but skunks, squirrels and bees, bears chasing him, exploding flames and burned chicken???? What was disney thinking!! this looks like lunie tunes or something.Next scene, why are mulan and shang both on horseback just standing there on a cliff watching the buggy roll down?? and the guards were pretty far away, anyone could have kidnapped those princesses, what kind of protection is that??mulan and shang just stand there until shang yells ""they're heading for the cliff"" right after YAW screams that out, as if shang and mulan couldn't make out what was happening.They all fly off the cliff and fall into the water, as soon as shang gets out of the water he questions mulan asking her what happened, how is she suppose to know, she was with HIM!!!!!!!  Shang doesn't even go as far as asking the men what happened, he justs asks then to save the supplies...""who's the big boy?"" says May, what kind of princessy thing is that to say to a guard?The whole argument about maps, guys and directions and women and maps, that's just too ""today"" and doesn't seem appropriate,.Once they make up, mulan walks off and they show mushu, then the scene shifts back to both of them and she hasn't totally walked off yet and his hand is still extended like the scene has been paused/frozen.Mushu is evil, selfish and mean and not fun at all like in the first Mulan.The princess's falling in love with the guards is just so tacky, first of all they're princesses and from what it looks like they've been locked away or something and then they just fall for the first ""man"" they meet, and may falling for yaw kind of forced the other girls to couple up with the other two which just doesn't make sense, to me it just looks like they had no personality really.""like other girls"" .. it doesn't make sense, I don't know as much about Chinese culture as other reviewers, however did girls in those days really climb trees and be that ""free""??  it sounds a lot like what girls do today, and it's only until the 20th century that even western girls became more free.Wait, sham po and his dream and the guards going to the village? ok the princesses agree but then they show them walking off coupled up holding hands, I would understand the two younger princesses but tingting looks pretty jolly holding ling's hand.. this all looks too cheesy.Shang and Mulan split up shortly after the princesses and guards partied in the near by town, shang understood that they were just too different and he went off on his horse.After mushu confesses of his hand in the plan to splitting them up, mulan asks him about the river incident and he denies it, it doesn't make since that had nothing to do with breaking them up and shang wasn't angry.Then mulan realizes that they aren't so different and all the problems were mushu's fault, so she sets off to make it all ok with shang, she says they aren't so different after all but she was the one who went to the village after the princesses and shang caught them in the act and he pointed out that she places her feelings above duty and other, so that was the problem and it had nothing to do with mushu except that mushu just woke shang up.  The real problem lay with mulan's ""duty to her heart"" and not mushu's little tick behind the tent.Now she goes to a total extreme and says she will finish the mission by throwing herself at the emperor's feet offering herself to his son.She speaks up to him very rudely when she argues ""and a marriage there will be""Meanwhile the princesses and the guards are disusing amongst themselves what mulan is doing at the kingdom and then shang  for some odd reason seems to overhear them from such a far distance and he answers "" by taking your place"" .. what was he hiding behind a tree?All of a sudden shang seems to think mulan's philosophy is so ""right"" and no one should marry someone whom they don't love,  like duty and honor should just go down the drain.Shang then speaks so rudely to the emperor as well once he ""appears"" on his horse to break up the marriage between Mulan and the emperor's eldest geeky son.And the rest is just ugly..",1,"Horrible, nothing like the first.

851740,A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A,B0002YLCH4,"Bruce Gray ""gurpsgm""","[10, 12]","Mulan II, the sequel to Mulan, is not quite what I expected.Shang and Mulan, only one month after Mulan's first adventure, are given the job of escorting three princesses to the northern kingdom for arrainged marriages to three princes.  It was even clear from the front cover of the video these three princesses were meant for Mulan's three male friends from the first movie.  Mulan and Shang clash over their approach to the mission.  Mulan has learned ""your first mission is to your heart.""  Chang has not.  Because Mushu will lose his job as Guardian if Mulan marries, Mushu tries to drive a wedge between Shang's and Mulan's feelings for each other.  Mushu eventually realizes his mission, too, is to his heart, and redeems himself.The end is anti-climatic, and Bandits are nowhere near the same threat as Huns.  Mushu is given too large a role, and a role that seems out of character, overshadowing the importance of the growing affection of Mulan and Shang.  Although there's a scene in which it seems that Shang has perished, Disney fans know the hero never dies.  It's doubly anti-climatic, because this whole movie can never live up to Mulan saving all of China.  I've heard rumors about a Mulan III.  Perhaps Disney's story editors can find a way for Mulan to save the whole planet.  That would be the only way I see to top the first movie.The musical numbers are good, and do not intrude too much into the story line.  In fact, one of the musical numbers actually does a good job of showing the princesses also learn ""your first mission is to your heart.""  The backup features are good, with a look at ""The Voices of Mulan II"", which highlights the people that were selected to do the characters; and ""The World of Mulan"", a basic look at the history and culture of China - although I would have preferred Mulan be the host of this segment rather than Mushu.  There's also deleted scenes, an interactive game, and a music video of my favorite musical number in this movie - ""(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls.""In one of the deleted scenes, there's a meeting between Mulan's party and the bandit leader. It's apparent that the storyline has changed, because there is an important scroll that's entirely missing from the movie.  There's more fighting and action in this deleted scene, and the bandit leader could have been a good follow up to the leader of the Huns.

851741,A2V026TK7H80V3,B0002YLCH4,Carl Cheng,"[2, 3]","Mulan is my second favorite Disney film only to be bested by The Little Mermaid in terms of classic-ness.  Its themes of independence, gender roles, and just the Chinese culture of suppression and filial piety touched home very much, enough to even make my own mother cry.  So with that being said, maybe I had much too high expectations for a movie that I had and still do love.Despite those doubts, this movie (plain and simple) isn't that good.  The jokes aren't funny and over-the-top in cheesiness which lack a sense of flow.  The premise of the story seems ridiculous with nothing really to add to the greatness of the first movie.  Mulan and Shang, just after preparing for their own marriage, are sent to escort three princesses to enter an arranged marriage with another country in hopes to cement an alliance through marriage and eventual blood bonds.  This itself invokes much 'feminism' within Mulan as she believes that one's duty is to one's heart.The moral of the story itself is good but as we all know, it doesn't mean it directly correlates with how well it is executed.  What made the first Mulan so memorable - themes, music/songs, characters, story - all seemed to have been lost and/or flawed in the sequel.Final Note: While nothing I say can stop any Mulan fan from watching the sequel (as just the mere fact that one was released is reason enough to watch it), I just hope that others' expectations will not be too high as mine where.  I think while the filmmakers probably do not agree that this is a reason to watch the movie, I think that this movie does indirectly make one appreciate the original so much more - as has been done with The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, etc.",2,"Follows in the ""Straight-to-Video"" Disney Sequel Trend",1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,1699,"['Mulan', 'second', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'film', 'only', 'be', 'bested', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'terms', 'classic-ness', 'themes', 'independence', 'gender', 'roles', 'just', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'suppression', 'filial', 'piety', 'touched', 'home', 'very', 'much', 'enough', 'even', 'make', 'own', 'mother', 'cry', 'So', 'being', 'said', 'maybe', 'had', 'much', 'too', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'had', 'still', 'do', 'love.Despite', 'doubts', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'over-the-top', 'cheesiness', 'lack', 'sense', 'flow', 'premise', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'nothing', 'really', 'add', 'greatness', 'first', 'movie', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'just', 'preparing', 'own', 'marriage', 'are', 'sent', 'escort', 'three', 'princesses', 'enter', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'country', 'hopes', 'cement', 'alliance', 'marriage', 'eventual', 'blood', 'bonds', 'much', ""'feminism"", 'Mulan', 'one', 'duty', 'one', 'heart.The', 'moral', 'story', 'good', 'know', ""n't"", 'mean', 'directly', 'how', 'well', 'executed', 'What', 'made', 'first', 'Mulan', 'so', 'memorable', 'themes', 'music/songs', 'characters', 'story', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'and/or', 'flawed', 'sequel.Final', 'Note', 'nothing', 'say', 'can', 'stop', 'Mulan', 'fan', 'watching', 'sequel', 'just', 'mere', 'fact', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'just', 'hope', 'others', 'expectations', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'mine', 'where', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'indirectly', 'make', 'one', 'appreciate', 'original', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'been', 'done', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Cinderella', 'etc']",N/A

For one thing, the plot is absurd, Mulan is shown in one of the first scenes teaching the village girls martial arts moves, which rings as modern feministgarbage, the reality of it would be that Mulan would be seen asa troublemaker, someone who threatened the ""natural"" order of village life.The idea that ordinary soldiers would be allowed to marry princesses again rings false, only via Imperial reward for ser-vices rendered to the State would this conceivable have happenedand the idea of princesses marrying commoners for the same reason rings false.  The cold reality would be that these char-acters would have incurred Imperial wrath for failing on theirmission, and most likely would have been executed in a very pub-lic way as a n example.The one scene that even remotely had any action to it, the capture of one of the princesses by a bandit group was drasti-cally shortened in the film, which is too bad, if carried out, it would have provided some realistic action.Overall, I would say that this is a very pale shadow of Mulan I,and simply not at all very realistic, encrusted as it is withmodern feminist sentiments.

The people who produced this fiasco either didn't watched the first movie or never caught its underlying message.  Certainly most of the voice cast is back except Mushu (Eddie Murphy) who is poorly imitated by Mosely.  What Murphy brought to the character just doesn't come through here.  Mushu is more foul-mouthed (no cursing, but quite a few ""behind"" references and he's just despicable here not loveable).  Although Firestein is back as Yao, the voice he uses here is different from the first movie.  I thought it was a different actor.  Several things here just feel odd.  Example: They made Ling this big comedian here which was never apart of the first film. Voices are different or characters are different thus no continuity.  In fact, that's what's wrong with this movie, there's no continuity with the first film.The songs are poor, although ""Lesson No. 1"" isn't bad, but its the best one.  A new rendition of ""A girl worth fighting for"" is sung by Yao, Ling and Chen-Po, but at a much faster tempo, thus robbing it of its Asian quality.  In fact, everything in this film goes much faster.If you check out the DVD extras (deleted scenes) you'll find the producers wanted to ""cut to the chase"" so they invariably eliminated some great scenes which would have given the storyline a little more weight and more issues.  The deleted scenes involved Mulan & Shang as warriors on a secret mission where after a great fight and they attempt to escape, he tells her if they get out of this he'll marry her (immediately she gets them out of the trouble).  The princessess who really don't want to marry are plotting to ""like"" Yao, Ling & Chen-Po just to plan their escapes and then Yao, Ling & Chen-Po's revelation of the princesses plot.  This was plenty of fertile ground to cull out a better story, but the producers ""needed to move the story along.""  Thus, you get this mess.

But before they marry, however, they must escort three princesses to another city/villiage in China....where they (the princesses) will be married to three princes chosen for them (aka...an arranged marriage). The only problem with this whole ""Mulan and Shang getting hitched"" thing is that, if they do get married, Mushu will lose his new job.

Although I have to admit, Mark Moseley does a fantastic Mushu, in place of Eddie Murphy.In a nutshell, this movie will probably entertain younger kids, but will leave adults sitting in the back of the theater.

851755,A367Z52XHDBHZ5,B0002YLCH4,"E Johnson ""E""","[0, 0]","This is a nice family-fun movie.  However, the reason I couldn't give it more stars is because only very few sequels live up to the original.POSITIVES:The movie was cute and my family enjoyed it.  It told the tale that differences can make you stronger and build you up (or tear you apart).  It was a cute lesson on having trust and faith in your loved one.  It dealt with breaking away from what is expected of us to ""follow our hearts"" (which is really what makes this world go around).  It taught on reconciliations (which is something that I love).  Sometimes, unfortunately, in real life we don't appreciate what we have until it's almost gone.  Mulan and Shang realized this when he went down into the canyon in order to save her life.  I really liked those positives.  I liked that it was surrounded with a lot of fun.  I especially like when people tell you that you can NEVER make it and you pull through with something better.  In the first movie Mulan was told that she would NEVER bring honor to her family (well, we all know what happened).  In this movie, the three other ""heros"" were told that they wouldn't find anyone good (in so many words).  They ended up with princesses.  People can be ever so wrong, thus, I liked the point that it brought out.THE NEGATIVES:The movie starts one month after the battle and Shang is apparently very in-love with Mulan and vice versa.  Now I KNOW that I am supposed to look at this from the standpoint of ancient China but it was very difficult for me to see how General Shang was head over heels for Mulan one month after the battle when he barely showed any interest in the first movie.  He didn't know she was a woman until three quarters through the first movie.  His interest in Mulan seemed suggested by the emperor (see first movie).  Because of this his love for Mulan was barely believable.  B.D. Wong (Shang)is a good actor as is Ming-Na (Mulan).  However, their voice characters weren't really brought out convincingly and with conviction as they were in the first movie.  When Shang (B.D. Wong) was yelling at his soldiers when they ran off to have fun with the princesses, it was mighty weak scene and acting.Overall, I gave it three stars.  As I mentioned, it was nice family fun.",3,"Nice Family Movie, But Doesn't Live Up to Mulan",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,2247,"['nice', 'family-fun', 'movie', 'However', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'stars', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'sequels', 'live', 'up', 'original.POSITIVES', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'told', 'tale', 'differences', 'can', 'make', 'stronger', 'build', 'up', 'tear', 'apart', 'was', 'cute', 'lesson', 'having', 'trust', 'faith', 'loved', 'one', 'breaking', 'away', 'what', 'expected', 'follow', 'hearts', 'really', 'what', 'world', 'go', 'around', 'taught', 'reconciliations', 'something', 'love', 'Sometimes', 'unfortunately', 'real', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'what', 'have', 'almost', 'gone', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'realized', 'when', 'went', 'down', 'canyon', 'order', 'save', 'life', 'really', 'liked', 'positives', 'liked', 'was', 'surrounded', 'lot', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'tell', 'can', 'NEVER', 'make', 'pull', 'something', 'better', 'first', 'movie', 'Mulan', 'was', 'told', 'would', 'NEVER', 'bring', 'honor', 'family', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'three', 'other', 'heros', 'were', 'told', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'ended', 'up', 'princesses', 'People', 'can', 'be', 'ever', 'so', 'wrong', 'thus', 'liked', 'point', 'brought', 'out.THE', 'NEGATIVES', 'movie', 'one', 'month', 'battle', 'Shang', 'apparently', 'very', 'in-love', 'Mulan', 'vice', 'versa', 'Now', 'KNOW', 'am', 'supposed', 'look', 'standpoint', 'ancient', 'China', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'General', 'Shang', 'was', 'head', 'heels', 'Mulan', 'one', 'month', 'battle', 'when', 'barely', 'showed', 'interest', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'woman', 'three', 'quarters', 'first', 'movie', 'interest', 'Mulan', 'seemed', 'suggested', 'emperor', 'see', 'first', 'movie', 'love', 'Mulan', 'was', 'barely', 'believable', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'Shang', 'good', 'actor', 'Ming-Na', 'Mulan', 'However', 'voice', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'convincingly', 'conviction', 'were', 'first', 'movie', 'When', 'Shang', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'was', 'yelling', 'soldiers', 'when', 'ran', 'off', 'have', 'fun', 'princesses', 'was', 'mighty', 'weak', 'scene', 'acting.Overall', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'mentioned', 'was', 'nice', 'family', 'fun']",N/A

851757,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0002YLCH4,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[5, 8]","While ""Mulan II"" definitely isn't quite up to the standard of the original, I still found it a fairly enjoyable film experience. The original ""Mulan"" set up a lot of things that are paid off nicely in this sequel and I think this is good for those that liked the original movie. I'm not going to go off here about what I think about Disney, or any of that kind of stuff, I'm just going to give the rundown on the movie and my general opinions:I'll quickly rundown the basic plots, of which there are two, both about equally interesting and important:- General Li Shang has proposed to Fa Mulan and they are getting married. Mushu and the other family ancestors find out about this and all except Mushu are nothing less than delighted. Mushu has been a well, royal, pain to the other ancestors and the marriage of Mulan and Shang means that Mushu is no longer her guardian. That means it's back to gong duty for him if they tie the knot! So he decides that he's going to break them up and even manages to convince himself that it'll be better for the both of them to not get married.- Mulan and Shang are sent on a mission to stop the invading Mongols by setting an arranged marriage between Mongol men and the emperors' three daughters. But as the mission progresses, they find themselves becoming attraced to the guards Fao, Ling and Chien-Po. They become inspired by Mulan to follow their hearts.Overall, I'd say this was a pretty fun story, with some neat parodies on the original movie and a couple of very moving scenes as well. I think if the movie has one major failing, it's the excessive use of Mushu, who really didn't need to appear as much as he did. I thought the music, while not quite up to the caliber of the original, was overall well-planned and fun to listen to. I  quite enjoyed ""Lesson Number One"" and I thought ""(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls"" was a great song as well, although I didn't enjoy the pop version played during the closing credits quite as much.Since very few, if any people have talked about it, I'll give you a rundown of the DVD special features:Voices of ""Mulan II"" --- This featurette gives you a look at the voice talent behind the characters of Mulan II. This isn't quite as good as it good be. It's rather short, only gives you quick look at a few of the voice actors and actresses and doesn't even talk about Mark Moseley, who stepped in to do Mushu in place of Eddie Murphy after the original ""Mulan.""Deleted Scenes --- Since this is a direct-to-video / DVD release, you know they weren't cutting these just for time. Check out these scenes and learn about why they didn't make it into the movie. The deleted scenes are ""Battle Sequence,"" ""Mei Flirts"" and ""The Escape, Parts 1 & 2."" All are in storyboard format.The World of Mulan --- A tour of China hosted by Mushu. I thought this was actually a pretty informative piece, although if you already have the Special Edition DVD for the original Mulan, you won't be seeing anything new here.Games & Activities --- A shadow-puppet game with Mushu that should be good fun for your kids.""(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls"" Music Video --- I didn't enjoy this pop-version song as much as ""True to Your Heart"" from the original Mulan, but it's not bad. Here you get a music video version featuring Atomic Kitten and scenes from the movie.- Previews for other Disney DVDs- Disney's FastPlay --- This feature allows you to play the movie and then the bonus features start immediately afterward. Very kid-friendly.P.S.: I thought the animation quality was almost as good, if not just as good as the original.",4,"Not a Superior Sequel, But Decent, I Thought",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,3588,"['Mulan', 'II', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'standard', 'original', 'still', 'found', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'experience', 'original', 'Mulan', 'set', 'up', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'paid', 'off', 'nicely', 'sequel', 'think', 'good', 'liked', 'original', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'off', 'here', 'what', 'think', 'Disney', 'kind', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'give', 'rundown', 'movie', 'general', 'opinions', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'rundown', 'basic', 'plots', 'are', 'two', 'equally', 'interesting', 'important', 'General', 'Li', 'Shang', 'proposed', 'Fa', 'Mulan', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'Mushu', 'other', 'family', 'ancestors', 'find', 'out', 'Mushu', 'are', 'nothing', 'less', 'delighted', 'Mushu', 'been', 'well', 'royal', 'pain', 'other', 'ancestors', 'marriage', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'Mushu', 'no', 'longer', 'guardian', 'back', 'gong', 'duty', 'tie', 'knot', 'going', 'break', 'up', 'even', 'manages', 'convince', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'not', 'get', 'married.-', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'are', 'sent', 'mission', 'stop', 'invading', 'Mongols', 'setting', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Mongol', 'men', 'emperors', 'three', 'daughters', 'mission', 'find', 'becoming', 'attraced', 'guards', 'Fao', 'Ling', 'Chien-Po', 'become', 'inspired', 'Mulan', 'follow', 'hearts.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'fun', 'story', 'neat', 'parodies', 'original', 'movie', 'couple', 'very', 'moving', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'major', 'failing', 'excessive', 'use', 'Mushu', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'appear', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'thought', 'music', 'not', 'quite', 'caliber', 'original', 'was', 'overall', 'well-planned', 'fun', 'listen', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'Lesson', 'Number', 'One', 'thought', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Other', 'Girls', 'was', 'great', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'pop', 'version', 'played', 'closing', 'quite', 'much.Since', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'talked', ""'ll"", 'give', 'rundown', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Voices', 'Mulan', 'II', 'featurette', 'look', 'voice', 'talent', 'characters', 'Mulan', 'II', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'good', 'be', 'rather', 'short', 'only', 'quick', 'look', 'few', 'voice', 'actors', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'Mark', 'Moseley', 'who', 'stepped', 'do', 'Mushu', 'place', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'original', 'Mulan', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'direct-to-video', '/', 'DVD', 'release', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", 'cutting', 'just', 'time', 'Check', 'scenes', 'learn', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'Battle', 'Sequence', 'Mei', 'Flirts', 'Escape', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'are', 'storyboard', 'format.The', 'World', 'Mulan', 'tour', 'China', 'hosted', 'Mushu', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'informative', 'piece', 'already', 'have', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'original', 'Mulan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'anything', 'new', 'here.Games', 'Activities', 'shadow-puppet', 'game', 'Mushu', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'fun', 'kids', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Other', 'Girls', 'Music', 'Video', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'pop-version', 'song', 'as', 'much', 'True', 'Your', 'Heart', 'original', 'Mulan', 'not', 'bad', 'Here', 'get', 'music', 'video', 'version', 'featuring', 'Atomic', 'Kitten', 'scenes', 'movie.-', 'Previews', 'other', 'Disney', 'DVDs-', 'Disney', 'FastPlay', 'feature', 'play', 'movie', 'then', 'bonus', 'start', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'Very', 'kid-friendly.P.S', 'thought', 'animation', 'quality', 'was', 'almost', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original']",N/A

In this episode, Mulan is tasked, along with General Shang, to deliver three princesses to be married to the son of a king of a rival kingdom. Of course, they need help, so the three warriors from the first film come along for the ride. The dragon Mushu is also along for the ride and up to some tricks to avoid losing his pedestal amongst Mulan's ancestors (will not go into more detail, lest I ruin part of the film).]Story line: Fairly standard story, with a lot of politically correct undertones. Mulan also, as expected, offers herself up as sacrifice at the proper moment (ala other Disney Princesses). This is Disney, so a happy ending is mandatory, with all major good characters redeeming themselves by the end of the film.Animation: The animation in this film is much better than some of the other Disney 2s, which are often so rushed that the animation suffers.Music: The music is fairly standard; it is not up to the level of songs created by composers like Elton John (Lion King), Phil Collins (Tarzan and Jane) or Menken (Beauty and the Beast). And, the song ""Girl Worth Fighting For"" is rehashed from Mulan.My kids love the film, so I am perfectly happy with it. I feel it is fairly average fare, but it is a harmless, fun picture.

I suppose its because the first had more action, humor and better songs. Mulan 2 had shown some heart and less humor. I think the directing and the wonderful script go a long way to make up for some of the animation quality and actually it's really only one scene in particular where the animation is only so-so. There are scenes that are breathtakingly beautiful like the images of rice paddies which look like beautiful pastel paintings. Mulan had grown from the first movie to this one. She seems to have learned life lessons and made choices in this film that show this growth. Yet she still remains the Mulan that we love who follows her heart. Sure, historically this movie is good but not the best.On the other side(or downer side), mixing all the present-day attitudes with Ancient China just can't work out well and besides, that entire ruckus about finding your Prince Charming is getting a little bit old. After Snow White, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc etc etc, the first Mulan was a nice change; it was different and something new. And now they just had to make a sequel that tells the same old story over again. Nice going. Like I mention earlier the music wasn't as good as the first Mulan, even though I liked the princesses' song: 3.... it was catchy.However, Mulan 2 did shows us the personality of the characters and it was such a sweet movie.  I especially loved the part where Mulan was holding on to Shang and he falls down the mountain. Ming-Na did such an excellent job. If you're looking for something new and special like the first Mulan, don't watch Mulan II, it will disappoint you. But if you just want to see another one of those Disney movies we all love, give it a go.",3,Mulan 2 ended up being a Fair Sequel,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,1829,"['think', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'son', 'really', 'first', 'one', 'more', 'suppose', 'first', 'had', 'more', 'action', 'humor', 'better', 'songs', 'Mulan', '2', 'had', 'shown', 'heart', 'less', 'humor', 'think', 'directing', 'wonderful', 'script', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'animation', 'quality', 'actually', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'animation', 'only', 'so-so', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'images', 'rice', 'paddies', 'look', 'beautiful', 'pastel', 'paintings', 'Mulan', 'had', 'grown', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'have', 'learned', 'life', 'lessons', 'made', 'choices', 'film', 'show', 'growth', 'still', 'Mulan', 'love', 'who', 'heart', 'Sure', 'historically', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'best.On', 'other', 'side', 'downer', 'side', 'mixing', 'present-day', 'attitudes', 'Ancient', 'China', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'well', 'besides', 'entire', 'ruckus', 'finding', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'getting', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'Snow', 'White', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'first', 'Mulan', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'was', 'different', 'something', 'new', 'now', 'just', 'had', 'make', 'sequel', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'again', 'Nice', 'going', 'mention', 'earlier', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Mulan', 'even', 'liked', 'princesses', 'song', '3', 'was', 'catchy.However', 'Mulan', '2', 'did', 'shows', 'personality', 'characters', 'was', 'such', 'sweet', 'movie', 'especially', 'loved', 'part', 'where', 'Mulan', 'was', 'holding', 'Shang', 'down', 'mountain', 'Ming-Na', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'special', 'first', 'Mulan', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Mulan', 'II', 'will', 'disappoint', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'Disney', 'movies', 'love', 'give', 'go']",N/A
851768,A2HI7DLWKY4QFK,B0002YLCH4,"Jill Myles ""Jill Myles""","[3, 5]","I found Mulan II to be a very cute, very engaging movie, and a very pleasing DVD. For fans of Disney, the animation process, and fans of the Mulan story, this DVD is an instant add to your collection.The story springs directly from the first movie. Mulan and Shang are about to get married when the emperor gives them a special mission -- take 3 princesses into enemy territory for an arranged marriage.  There's a hitch, of course, and what ensues is charmingly romantic, funny at times, and a real heart warming story.  I found the opening sequence a bit hokey, but once the story got rolling, I was really into it. I loved the 3 princesses and thought they were absolutely adorable. A definite feel-good movie with a lot of romance in the storyline.The extras are short, but I liked them a lot. There are two deleted scenes, both in storyboard form and sound only, as they never made it to the animators. One is of Princess Mei flirting with one of the guardsmen, and the production team explains why they removed it from the story. The other scene was a rather long action sequence between Mulan and Shang, on a covert mission to retrieve a scroll. I thought it was fascinating to see the process and the decisions they made, and liked this part very much.Also included were a few clips of the actors behind the voices -- and I was disappointed to see that Eddie Murphy was not back as Mushu. The actor that did his voice this time, though, was spot on, and I couldn't tell the difference. He truly did a great job.The rest of the extras (World of Mulan, the music video) were also interesting to watch. Oh, and the Mushu game was very cute!One of the best things I liked about this DVD was the child-friendly FastPlay feature. This is the first DVD I've bought which includes this, and I like it a lot! As soon as the movie is popped into the DVD player, it starts. No skipping around the menu or trying to figure out which button on the control does what (very handy for little fingers that know how to put the dvd in, but not how to work the remote). After the movie is finished, the extras begin to automatically play. I thought this was genius!Overall, I found this DVD to be a wonderful purchase. Disney has done a great job again, making an interesting, entertaining movie, and making the DVD itself well worth the money.",5,"Charming, Romantic Sequel with a neat 'FastPlay' feature",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2332,"['found', 'Mulan', 'II', 'be', 'very', 'cute', 'very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'very', 'pleasing', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Disney', 'animation', 'process', 'fans', 'Mulan', 'story', 'DVD', 'instant', 'add', 'collection.The', 'story', 'springs', 'directly', 'first', 'movie', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'are', 'get', 'married', 'when', 'emperor', 'special', 'mission', 'take', '3', 'princesses', 'enemy', 'territory', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'hitch', 'course', 'what', 'charmingly', 'romantic', 'funny', 'times', 'real', 'heart', 'warming', 'story', 'found', 'opening', 'sequence', 'bit', 'hokey', 'once', 'story', 'got', 'rolling', 'was', 'really', 'loved', '3', 'princesses', 'thought', 'were', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'definite', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'lot', 'romance', 'storyline.The', 'extras', 'are', 'short', 'liked', 'lot', 'are', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'storyboard', 'form', 'sound', 'only', 'never', 'made', 'animators', 'One', 'Princess', 'Mei', 'flirting', 'one', 'guardsmen', 'production', 'team', 'why', 'removed', 'story', 'other', 'scene', 'was', 'rather', 'long', 'action', 'sequence', 'Mulan', 'Shang', 'covert', 'mission', 'retrieve', 'scroll', 'thought', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'process', 'decisions', 'made', 'liked', 'part', 'very', 'much.Also', 'included', 'were', 'few', 'clips', 'actors', 'voices', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'not', 'back', 'Mushu', 'actor', 'did', 'voice', 'time', 'though', 'was', 'spot', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'truly', 'did', 'great', 'job.The', 'rest', 'extras', 'World', 'Mulan', 'music', 'video', 'were', 'also', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Oh', 'Mushu', 'game', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'liked', 'DVD', 'was', 'child-friendly', 'FastPlay', 'feature', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'like', 'lot', 'As', 'soon', 'movie', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'skipping', 'menu', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'button', 'control', 'what', 'very', 'handy', 'little', 'fingers', 'know', 'how', 'put', 'dvd', 'not', 'how', 'work', 'remote', 'movie', 'finished', 'extras', 'begin', 'automatically', 'play', 'thought', 'was', 'genius', 'Overall', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'wonderful', 'purchase', 'Disney', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'again', 'making', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'making', 'DVD', 'well', 'money']",N/A

851772,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,B0002YLCH4,Katie,"[5, 7]","I got Mulan 2 yesterday because A) I wanted to see the developing relationship between Mulan and Shang B) I LOVED the first one and most importantly C) Lea Salonga was in it.  I know full well the stigma of Disney sequels and was hoping that Mulan 2 would rise above them.Well, I wasn't exactly wrong, but I wasn't exactly right either.  I'd rate this at about the level of The Lion King 1 1/2.  The animation is cheap, the characters don't feel like themselves, the music is AWFUL, and the story is just...Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself.  First off, when you hear about the story it has real potential.  There were SO many directions people could go with that.  Unfortunately, Mulan 2 just goes the wrong way everytime.My biggest problem was it lacked the Chinese element of Mulan 1.  It was set in China, yes.  The costumes were beautiful and they used enough Confucius-esque metaphors to fill a Taoism book, but Mulan's whole attitude is ""do what you think is right, not what society thinks is right.""  That whole moral thing depends on society being, y'know, repressive.  In Mulan, you really got that sense, like when her father constantly yells at her about duty and the Matchmaker screams at her, Chi Fu says that she's a worthless women, people are constantly making derogatory remarks about women (particularly during training, ect).  The list goes on.  In Mulan 2 these things are missing.  Mulan is being hailed as a hero, the role models of little girls everywhere.  Um, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this still ancient China?  Plus everyone is horrified by the idea of an arranged marriage (except for Shang) when that was the NORM at the time.  I don't even like the fact that Shang and Mulan were able to get engaged so easily.  Maybe because they were heroes?  But still, betrothals were the norm.Speaking of Shang and Mulan, the movie really disappointed me in that department.  I think what was so endearing in the first movie was Shang going from this macho military man to this stammering teenage boy in front of Mulan.  In the second movie, only a month later, they're incredibly comfortable with each other.  It's annoying, because I wanted to see that development.  Fictional couples are always cutest BEFORE they get together.The princesses/three boys romances were even worse, though.  It was like dominoes.  One fell right after the other, and for very little reason.  The original plot, they said, was to have the girls use the boys to escape the marriages.  Okay, not as happy, but certainly a better plot idea!  I hate convoluted relationships and those were just... ugh.  You're supposed to not like Ting Ting, I think, but I liked her best because she was the only one who didn't fall head over heels right away!  You have to wonder if the relationships will last.  I mean, these princesses obviously haven't had much romance in their lives.  And then they want to screw over their father and country for some guys they just met.  If the romances were really likable I wouldn't care, but they were just so... shallow.Oh, they also randomly made Shang a total rule jockey.  He's all straight-laced and ""by the book"" whereas Mulan is like ""rules were made to be broken!""  These were two very major extremes, meant to cause tension between the two.  To me, it was almost caricature-like.  Shang never was that uptight in the movie, and Mulan was never that free-spirited.  They were realistic.  In this movie, it gets blown way out of proportion just for the sake of giving the two excuses to fight.  There are plenty of other character foibles that could have caused them to fight.  No need to make them walking and talking ideals.Speaking of which, Mulan was just one giant ideal.  She got so preachy I stopped thinking of her as a person and just a person there for the sake of getting a message across.  She's constantly preaching something.  It really annoyed me, because in the first movie Mulan was just this confused girl who didn't fit in and wanted to find her real place, and in the second she's all over that so they need to give her a new personality... oooh, here's a good idea, let's make her a free-spirit who does what she wants and doesn't adhere to old, tired ideals!  Ugh.  I never thought I'd get sick of Ming-Na's voice, but when it keeps saying crap like ""My duty is to my heart""I think Mulan, Shang, and the princesses needed more interaction together.  It felt like they were totally separate groups of people, not a party travelling together.Now, Mushu.  People said he had too big of a role in the movie.  DEFINITELY.  He was a total jerk and I hated him.  I just kept saying ""Shut up already!""  What was really dumb to me was how they kept having him make Freudian slips, like ""This is what's best for me... oops I mean Mulan.""  Okay, yeah, we get it, he's doing it for himself, not for her.  No need to spell it out like that.There were THREE songs.  Did you hear that?  They have freaking Judy Kuhn and Lea Salonga and there are only three songs.  The first one is horrible and totally unnecessary, the second is just a redux of A Girl Worth Fighting For, and the third is the only one that I really like.  The third, I Want to Be Like Other Girls, is a cute side of the princesses and I wish we would have seen more of it.  And by that I don't mean ""swooning over some guy they just met.""Anyway, as I rewatch it I find it growing on me.  But just as a ""cute, I guess"" movie, not ""WOW THIS IS AWESOME"" movie that I can watch every night like Mulan.  What's sad is it really had potential, too...",3,Wasted potential...,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,5561,"['got', 'Mulan', '2', 'yesterday', 'A', 'wanted', 'see', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Mulan',

851773,AF7JCEOIGIS4N,B0002YLCH4,Kelli,"[4, 6]","I typically don't like sequels, but occasionally there is a good one, so I decided to give this one a chance.  I found it to be ok.Animation: B - It's fine.  Not as good as the original, but not bad either.  One of the princesses looked like, when they started drawing her head, they started with a perfect circle.Music: D - The songs are not memorable like the songs in the first movie were.  They sound like songs that were written quickly.Story: C - It's ok.  It's not really very interesting.  It is definitely made just for kids.  I watched it with a kid, however, and she called it boring.Moral: D-  - The moral of following your heart is dangerous.  There is more to take into account than just following your heart.  The princesses were willing to jeopardize the entire country of China just because they felt infatuated with some soldiers.  They couldn't feel true love yet, since they only knew each other for 3 days.  When people solely follow their heart, massive mistakes are made.  I've known people who get in abusive relationships, who get divorced routinely, etc. because that is what their heart told them to do.  Your heart is easily deceived.  Many people are manipulated into terrible relationships because they think they feel love for someone (aka their heart tells them it's true love).  There are dangers in this message.

I waited for this movie with high hopes but I was disappointed because I was hoping for something as awesome as the original.  This movie hints at greatness but never gets there.In this movie, Shang and Mulan become engaged and the emperor asks them to escort his daughters to their arranged marriages.  The girls fall in love with the three warriros from the first movie and do not want to complete their mission.  Mulan encourages them to follow their heart and this causes her problems with Shang.I loves the animation of this movie and the story premise was good but I was disappointed in this movie overall.  Clearly, Disney never even attempted to make this movie of the quality needed to be in the theatres.  The songs were weak and Mushi was not as funny here as he was in the original.  Even the battle sces are no where near as detailed or awesome as those in the original movie.Mulan and Shang spent too much of the movie in conflict and I can't really put my finger on exactly why, but the movie did not draw me in as much as the first one did and I have not had an urge to sit down and watch this one again.Usually the second Disney movie is not as good as the original- with the major exception of Toy Story 2-and this movie lives up to this ""curse"".I would put this movie in the same category as  Little Mermaid 2 or even Lion King 2.

I am Chinese and from Malaysia and I find the film to be offensive and historically inaccurate. The American producers did not bother to check the practices in China during the Wei dynasty and practices of the Chinese in general. The flim seems to mock arranged marriages and fillal piety.The errors which I have stopped include1. Men do not propose to women for their hand in marriage. The groom (or more likely his parents) will seek the hand of marriage from the bride's father. General Shang cannot propose to Mulan directly but he has to seek the permission to marry from Fa Zhou.2. Men and women do not coinhibit. Shang and Mulan live together in the Fa household before marriage.3. Arranged marriages are a norm in ancient China.4. The Chinese do not pratice Yoga as shown during the ""Like Other Girls"".5. Chinese princesses who are getting married to a foreign prince will travel with a large entourage. In this movie the entourage was only 5 and 4 of them are men. In the past the maid will follow and to protect the purity of the princesses only the eunuchs will be of close contact with the princesses.The producers should check on the story of Ming Princess Hang Li Po marrying the Sultan of Melaka. An entourage came from China enough to populate Melaka. The decendents remain in Malaysia up to today in the form of Cina Peranakan.6. When any of the aristocracy marry (in the case of Shang and Mulan), the whole village is invited. The remark by Shang that Grandma invited the whole of China is insulting.7. Princeses or the aristocracy do not climb trees and suggested by the song ""(I Wanna Be) Like Other Girls"". Chinese up to today do not eat our traditional cakes with toppings, again suggested by the song.8. Breaking the Ying Yang sign into two is taboo.9. The punishment for disobeying the Emperor's orders to marry the foreign prince is DEATH. Since Mulan, the Princesses and Yang, Ling and Chien-Po wanted to follow their heart, the punishment is death.10. Lions guard the door. The statute at Qui Gong's palace is NOT a dragon!The biggest error of all is that Mulan never married.

MULAN II is the continuing adventures of Fa Mulan. Set only a few months after the original film, Mulan is a ""Hero"" and an example for all the Chinese young girls in the community. They look up to her and often imitate her.But the Emperor, again reprised by Pat Morita (The Karate Kid I, II and III) has to keep peace among kingdoms and assigns Shin and Mulan to escort three brides to their ""arranged marriages"" to keep the peace. Mushu has a mission to destroy the attraction between Mulan and Shin - but he realizes he is doing everything for the wrong reasons.""I Wanna Be Like Other Girls"" is a fun song that becomes a turning point for the three princesses that do not want to marry strangers. This creates a great amount of humor and fun for the three warriors who are back. Voiced by.Almost everyone is back including B.D. Wong (Father of The Bride I and II),  George Takei (Mr. Sulu on the original Star Trek) and Ming-Na (ER, The Single Guy). Directed by Darrell Rooney and Lynne Southerland.The extra features in clued a behind the scenes look at some of the cast and a small discussion of the directors and their making of this film. There is a section on the specialties that China and the Chinese culture have to offer too. Mushu is your guide there.There is also a fun little memory game using shadows and light for the younger ones. Overall, there are not a lot of extra features and the featurette that was there didn't include B.D.. Wong as Shin or any explanation of Eddie Murphy not coming back.The only thing that was a little disappointing was that Shin doesn't sing a song, which means Donny Osmond, didn't get to perform. In the original, ""Make a Man Out Of You"" was one of the best songs. And although ""Number 1"" rule is a cute song it doesn't hold the charm of the originals ""Reflection"" or the fun ""True To Your Heart"" did.Also, Eddie Murphy did not reprise his role as Mushu. That was an obvious tone changer. The vocalist sounds similar to Eddie but it doesn't have the energy and the spontaneity that I am sure only Eddie Murphy can do.Otherwise it's a great lesson in life, love and making sure you do as your heart tells you...not your head.",3,MULAN is Back - But A Little Weak.,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2235,"['fun', 'lesson', 'kids', 'especially', 'little', 'girls', 'MULAN', 'II', 'continuing', 'adventures', 'Fa', 'Mulan', 'Set', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'original', 'film', 'Mulan', 'Hero', 'example', 'Chinese', 'young', 'girls', 'community', 'look', 'up', 'often', 'imitate', 'her.But', 'Emperor', 'again', 'reprised', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'II', 'III', 'keep', 'peace', 'kingdoms', 'assigns', 'Shin', 'Mulan', 'escort', 'three', 'brides', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'keep', 'peace', 'Mushu', 'mission', 'destroy', 'attraction', 'Mulan', 'Shin', 'doing', 'everything', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Other', 'Girls', 'fun', 'song', 'turning', 'point', 'three', 'princesses', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'strangers', 'great', 'amount', 'humor', 'fun', 'three', 'warriors', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'Voiced', 'everyone', 'back', 'including', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'Father', 'Bride', 'II', 'George', 'Takei', 'Mr.', 'Sulu', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Ming-Na', 'ER', 'Single', 'Guy', 'Directed', 'Darrell', 'Rooney', 'Lynne', 'Southerland.The', 'extra', 'features', 'clued', 'scenes', 'look', 'cast', 'small', 'discussion', 'directors', 'making', 'film', 'section', 'specialties', 'China', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'have', 'offer', 'too', 'Mushu', 'guide', 'also', 'fun', 'little', 'memory', 'game', 'using', 'shadows', 'light', 'younger', 'ones', 'Overall', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'extra', 'features', 'featurette', 'was', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'B.D..', 'Wong', 'Shin', 'explanation', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'not', 'coming', 'back.The', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'was', 'Shin', ""n't"", 'sing', 'song', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'perform', 'original', 'Make', 'Man', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'Number', '1', 'rule', 'cute', 'song', ""n't"", 'hold', 'charm', 'originals', 'Reflection', 'fun', 'True', 'Your', 'Heart', 'did.Also', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'did', 'not', 'reprise', 'role', 'Mushu', 'was', 'obvious', 'tone', 'changer', 'vocalist', 'similar', 'Eddie', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'spontaneity', 'am', 'sure', 'only', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'can', 'do.Otherwise', 'great', 'lesson', 'life', 'love', 'making', 'sure', 'do', 'heart', 'not', 'head']",N/A

This makes Mushu happy at first, but when he finds out from the Guardians that he will lose his pedestal and his place of honor among the Guardians and be reduced once again to a bell ringer, Mushu is unhappy and tries to break up the wedding. Before Mulan and General Li Shang can get married the two are summon to the Emperor of China. The Emperor informs the two that they must escort his three daughters, Princesses Mei, Ting-Ting, and Su, so they can marry the princes of Qui Gong so an alliance can be formed. This task must be done in three days. Mulan and General Li Shang get the assistant of Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. This is where the movie gets predictable. The princesses and the three guards fall in love, Mushu at first get Mulan and Li Shang to break-up. Mushu seeing the error of his ways finds a way to unite Mulan and Li Shang and all four couples wind up getting married; not at the same time though. General Li Shang combines the family temples; which means Mushu gets to keep his pedestal and his place of honor among the Guardians.

This time, Mulan's excitement over her new engagement to General Shang is interrupted when the pair is summoned by the emperor to escort his three daughters across the country for an arranged triple marriage that will secure an alliance to discourage future Hun attacks. This weighs a bit on Mulan, as she believes people should marry for love rather than duty. It also weighs on the princesses, especially after they fall in love with the three soldiers brought along to guard them, China's other unlikely heroes, Yao, Ling, and Chien Po.However, the driving force of this second narrative is everyone's favorite dragon guardian, Mushu, who stows away on the mission with sidekick Cri-Kee the cricket, this time with a not so noble mission of his own. Rather than trying to help Mulan accomplish her goal, Mushu is concerned that he is soon to lose his position as the family hero of the spirit world and his pedestal among the ancestors once Mulan is married off. Therefore, he convinces himself that the yin and yang of Mulan and Shang's relationship really makes them incompatible and sets forth to prove it to them in a series of devious acts to make Mulan and Shang stop getting along so well with each other. Cri-Kee declares that he his coming along to protect Mulan from Mushu's misguided trickery.Now, being that this is a direct-to-video Disney feature, there is no shortage of harsh reviews out there for it. Reading over them on a variety of websites, I find many of them to be overly harsh. To bring up one example, some folks will call the animation here sub-par. This is outrageously incorrect. The animation is nearly as good as the original film, which is saying quite a lot! So, where such derogatory statements about this film's animation come from is anyone's guess. On top of that, you may find if you read some other reviews yourself that some folks sound as though they haven't even really watched the movie and are just posting an unspecific, negative review that could be (fallibly) stamped on any Disney direct-to-video sequel without watching it first.The fact is, ""Mulan 2"" is a very good film. Not perfect, not as excellent as the original, but very good, and I find that a lot of the negative reviews for it out there not only exaggerate, but sometimes even contradict themselves, and often also come from folks who didn't even like the first film (and never have anything nice to say about direct to video sequels).One of the best things about Mulan 2 is that the story is not a retread of the first by any means. This, along with the very good quality of the animation and overall visuals, is generally praised even by most folks who are hard on it. Though, some of those people will still complain that it doesn't have the cross-dressing warrior aspect and that we see too much of Mulan's feminine side in what is more of a romance story than a war-epic like the first film. So, there's one of those glaring contradictions. Folks are praising Mulan 2 for being original but complaining that it is not similar enough. Oy. Well, I LOVED the first film, but I also loved Mulan 2 (hence the full amount of stars, even though I credit the first as superior in many ways) and its boldness of showing how Mulan's strong character maintains even in a story that is the almost a polar opposite of the first. Some folks seem to want a caricature of Mulan now rather than Mulan as she really was (Mulan went to war because she felt she had no choice, not because she was a Xena wanna be). Maybe they need to rewatch the first film. Anyway, this new Mulan story is not as epic as the first, which is probably wise considering the budget was probably far less. But, with almost the entire original voice cast back for this one and with such high quality visuals and a still very enjoyable yet smaller scale story, it's not a big issue that we don't get war epic scenes here with grand mountain scopes. They're not needed for this story, and just because it's a Mulan story doesn't mean it has to be a war epic (very mild spoilers ahead). Mulan 2 is our chance to see Mulan being her post-war self, the woman warrior (yes, she does have a battle scene when the caravan is attacked by bandits) rather than the woman pretending to be a warrior (or warrior woman, as some folks seem to want her to be). And some have said that he character is too easily pushed to the side by focus on Mushu. Well, when I watched the film a second time, I found this to be untrue. Another great thing about the film is how no one really takes center stage. This film focuses equally on all the characters. It seems like it focuses on Mushu probably because his story kicks things off and rounds things out, he sort of saves the day in the end, and he's got that loudmouth personality. But I loved how this film was about not only Mushu's story and Mulan and Shang's story, but also Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po and their princesses. Su, the little one who ends up with Chien-Po, was too cute. And, incidentally, Mulan was looking more gorgeous than ever in this film too, I guess because you didn't have the whole cross-dressing thing to work with, allowing the artists to stick with and accentuate her more feminine design.Now, I'm not here to give nothing but praise to Mulan 2. Yes, as some may mention now and then, it is rather predictable once it gets going. You know who is going to end up with whom. Well, a lot of films are that way, even great ones. And who doesn't know how Cinderella or Snow White are going to turn out when they sit down to watch them? So, that's never the best complaint in the world. My biggest complaint (practically my only one) was with what felt like a loose end, and that's the whole thing about forming an alliance to discourage an impending Hun attack. I sort of felt the resolution of that issue was left too much to the viewer's imagination. Perhaps this is because, back when Mulan 2 was being made, word was that Mulan 3 was to go into production soon also. Since then, Disney direct-to-video sequels have been scrapped by the company and a lot of planned films were canceled, Mulan 3 as well I guess. Whether that third film would have tied up that loose end of this film is unknown, but it seems very plausible. If that's the case, and if the animation quality, writing strength, and cast could have been maintained one more time, it's a shame Mulan 3 was never made. Now, to play devil's advocate against my one complaint, I haven't read too many other reviews complaining about that alliance/Hun issue as a ""loose end"". Maybe I missed something, didn't take something the right way, or other folks just didn't see it as all that important. Regardless, this is not enough to ruin an otherwise wonderful direct-to-video feature that, in my opinion, does an excellent job of maintaining the characters of the first film and introducing fun and likable new ones. Which brings me to the songs. There are two new ones here, and ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" is brought back. Frankly, I loved ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" in the first film, though it is often the most dissed song from Mulan. It was brought back well here though, and some folks seem to like it more this time. ""Lesson Number One"" is a delightful musical sequence early in the film as Mulan teaches some warrior skills to a group of village children who want to be just like her. I only was disappointed in ""Like Other Girls"", because here was a fine opportunity that was cutely animated, but like many direct-to-video songs, the lack of almost any rhyming at all just made it displeasing to me as a song. Seems that most songs written for direct-to-video have that trouble of not rhyming or not having catchy tunes or something like that, making them overall unmemorable. So, okay, if I have two complaints about this film, that is the second, the first being what I felt was a loose end. Some may have an issue with Eddie Murphy not returning as Mushu (the only main character who doesn't return), but Mark Moseley does such a great job at voicing him that it is inconsequential. Incidentally, for Michelle Kwan fans, she has about two lines in the film as a marketplace shopkeeper who practically skates into the scene.So, I think and hope that's everything I wanted to say about ""Mulan 2"", a wonderful little direct-to-video sequel to an excellent feature film. I'm sorry for the folks who didn't like it, but I can't help but think they went into viewing it with the intention of not liking it to begin with or hoping to see the same kind of film as the original (or with the same kind of budget; though this film, as I've said, looks nearly as good aside from the epic scope). It's not perfect or as amazing as the original, but I enjoyed Mulan 2 more than Atlantis, which was a theatrical release and an original, and possibly even more than a few others. The currently dead phenomenon of Disney direct-to-video sequels was not always a bad thing, as this film exemplifies in my opinion, and while a lot of the films they made were poorly done and all-out mistakes, I would have been quite happy if they continued to make them at this quality level and hadn't made some of those really bad ones. For more GOOD Disney direct-to-video sequels, check out Bambi 2, Lilo and Stitch 2: Stitch has a Glitch, the Lion King 1 1/2, An Extremely Goofy Movie, and even Tarzan 2 and Cinderella 3. Though, with Cinderella 3 you have to be willing to ignore it as continuity and just take it as a fun film, or else the ending will mess with your head. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy: Three Musketeers and Mickey's Once and Twice Upon a Christmas are also highly recommended, as is The Tinker Bell Movie, which thankfully will have some sequels of its own in the near future.As for the DVD of Mulan 2, I thought it had an adequate selection of bonus features compared to what I would have expected from a Disney release at the time. Included are 4 deleted scenes in animatic form, a music video for ""Like Other Girls"" as performed by Atomic Kitten (though the video is just clips from the film), a briefly diverting silhouette game, an educational experience called ""The World of Mulan"" that ends with a chart of Chinese year animals as a prize, and finally, a behind the scenes featurette on the voices of the film (not mentioning Mushu, of course) is also included. And, yes, this DVD is equipped with Disney's Fast Play. If you loved the first film but can handle Mulan in a very different kind of story, then I highly recommend picking up your own copy of ""Mulan 2"".",5,Among the very best of Disney's DTV

This is no cheap knock-off intended to ride on the popularity of the first movie. The high quality of animation is maintained (and fully up to Disney feature film standards), but more importantly, the quality of the story is up Disney standards.This is tale that will hold the interest of both children and adults. Here is the appropriately Chinese theme of the seeming contradiction between adherence to duty, tradition, and family (Confucianism) and the path of intuition, heart, and nature (Taoism.) We are shown that there should be no fundamental conflict between the path of duty and the path of the heart. Indeed, our duty is to our heart. If we listen to our heart it will tell us what out true duty is- if it is really our true duty, then there should be no conflict.All the old characters are back from the first film- including Eddie Murphy as the mischievous family guardian spirit, Mushu. In the ""Voices of Mulan"" feature you see that almost all of the main voice actors (except Murphy, of course) are Chinese or at least Asian. This is kind of ironic since they all have impeccable American accents...It is nice to see films set in the legendary period of the Middle Kingdom before the coming of the Manchu.

851788,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B0002YLCH4,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[7, 8]","The much anticipated Mulan II could have been so much better.  As a result, it dosn't stand anywhere near as close to the original.As many people are describing this movie in their reviews, I will not give a synopsis.  Instead I will point out the strengths and the weaknesses with the film.Weaknesses:Unforunatley this list is longer.  In Mulan II there are no catchy songs like the first film had.  Mushu does not come across funny and I don't think it was the voice actor's fault.  The film in general is just weak.  The focus on Mulan and Shang getting together is acceptable, because most people wanted to see how things turn out.  However, the plot of Ling, Yao and Chin Po getting together with the princesses, basically cuts the pace of the movie down. It makes the whole film seem more like an animated soap opera.  Not joking, this film is mostly about the pre marriage escapades with Mulan and Shang, or the nonesense of the 3 with the daughters.  Mushu adds a little spice by trying to mess up Mulan's and Shang's engagement(because Mulan must take on Shang's ancestors when she marries him and Mushu looses his improved status) but it dosn't help much.  The film is less serious than the first, and is definatly lacking in action.  The film makers really didn't seem to care about the male audience with this film. The plot could have been much better had it only focused on the relationship of Mulan and Shang. I don't think anyone really needed to see, or cared about the 3 getting hooked up too.  In all truth I think I could have come up with a better script than was approved by Disney for this film.Strngths:This list will be shorter.  The begining is ok.  Mulan does a song with the female children in her village which comes across well.  We have most of the same voice actors doing the voices which is good.  Crickee appears again and is actually funner to watch than Mushu.  There is a happy ending. My 17 month old daughter watched most of the film. (had to think hard for the good points)As far as special features, the film is in widescreen.  There are English, French, and Spanish language tracks on the disc.  There are also some dvd games for the kids, a video of one of the songs, and some deleted scenes.  We also get a slight look at some of the voice actors of the film.Overall Mulan II is a much weaker, and more child oriented film.

But with my interest in Far Eastern culture, I figured this would be something I could sit through.  As the illustrious Savior of China who still goes out to work in the fields, Mulan begins with the lesson of ""yin and yang"", done up into a musical number of course, but I think Buddhism and Confucianism have to be more than that.  She's off on the road doing guard duty this time with now-General Shang, whom she's decided to wed.  Now if I'm not mistaken, in Mulan I, she starts as an ""enlisted man"", so if she hasn't been commissioned by the sequel, it sounds like improper fraternization.  The dragon Mushu, who loses the critical bit Eddie Murphy gave him previously, is out to his old tricks, convinced that the marriage will put him out of a job as ancestral guardian.  No, this is NOT the real Mushu, but he'll do.  The military escort has as its charges a set of 3 Imperial princesses (of course, for Disney, you have to have princesses), given in those hateful arranged marriages to foreign princes (I hear Tevye crying ""Tradition!""). Mulan convinces them to give up ""duty"" in favor of their ""hearts"".  In the instant case, their respective hearts are given to the affable Army buddies from the first film.  Now I'm not so sure about this one.  There sure is a lot to be said for doing one's duty, and I'm unconvinced there--one's heart typically doesn't pay the same kind of wages.  Well, I guess Fa Mulan does all right as a role model for the female youth out there in the audience, and the whole oriental tableau of the movie was an entertaining one for me.  I doubt the People's Republic of China will object as much to Mulan II as they did to the spate of films back there about Tibet (one was a Miramax, as I recall).  I'll say 3.9 stars on this one.

851798,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0002YLCH4,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 6]","Okay, you don't have to watch much before realizing that this is the latest in Disney's quickie straight-to-video sequels, but it's still a worthwhile family flick.  It's a kindler, gentler version than the first Mulan - with less of the epic scope that Disney uses for its theatrical versions, but it has its fun moments, some snappy songs and better-than-expected (by the ""Rotten Review"" anyway) animation.  In this sequel, Mulan and General Li-Shang are interrupted on the verge of their wedding.  It's scarcely a month since young Mulan saved China from the Huns, and she hasn't a thing in common with her valiant, if duty bound betrothed - but true love is the only constant, and it takes an imperial order to bring them to the Celestial Court of the Middle Kingdom.  There, the Emperor warns of them that China faces invasion.  Though Li-Shang suggests a preemptive strike, the Emperor has other plams that match the slimmer story: he's proposed an alliance with the neighboring kingdom of Qigon - with the pact to be sealed by the marriage of the Chinese Emperor's three daughters to the crown prince of Qigon.  Together, the two kingdoms will be more than able to hold their own against the Mongols.  Rather than invite an attack by sending his daughters with a large armed contingent, the Emperor opts to have them covertly escorted to their new home by Mulan and Li-Shang, and three soldiers of their choosing.Three daughters, three escorts - even kids who missed ""Matrix: Revolutions"" will spot obvious providence.  Also along for the ride is Mu-Shu, the pesky mini-dragon originally voiced by Eddie Murphy.  (Murphy doesn't grace us here, though any dissatisfaction can be traced to the flick's script.)  Mu-Shu has his reasons for wanting to prevent Mulan's wedding - since it will put him out of a job as her guardian dragon.  Some comic misadventures, songs and musings about true love against a sense of duty fluff out the plot enough to keep your kids happy.  At the same time, you wonder silently just how Mulan will save the alliance that means the survival of China without destroying the Princess' chance for true love.  The flick, like most Disney efforts, rises on the strength of the sidekicks - notably the bumbling/heroic trio of Poe, Ling & Yao (they get the best song, and the Princesses).  There's some minor violence, one apparent (though deceptive) death scene, and some of the animation may prove ethnic enough to be wince-worthy for PC purposes - but I thin are redeemed by the overall earnestness of the project.

851799,A3JNTC2Y5J1QKU,B0002YLCH4,Scott,"[5, 11]","For those of you who liked the first Mulan and are considering buying this, just do it. Even though it's straight to video, it's still just as good as the original. It follows the traditional Disney formula with fun characters and themes of love and caring. Even though this is obviously a girlie disney movie, there was plenty of fun stuff to keep myself, a 23 year old male interested. I saw it at work. Don't ask.With the water color intro and Tan Dun like music, I couldn't help but think I was watching Disney's House of Crouching Tigers, Hidden Hero. Mulan and Shang on an escort mission? Fighting Bandits? Falling love? If it weren't for the animation and talking animals, it'd be like one of those Taiwanese serials. Speaking of which, maybe it's just me, but I was totally convinced that Mulan and her boyfriend Shang were really Chinese American. They talk and argue as if they were straight out of an Amy Tan book.As a parent, you might be concerned with the educational value of the film. I read one review about how the moral of the story was to follow your heart and not follow duty. Yeah, that could send mixed messages to children, but there was actually a lot more to it than just that. First of all, the reviewer is right. Mulan obviously follows her heart instead of simply following the rules like her boyfriend. This gets them into conflicts because they realize they are almost complete opposites. He always follows duty. However, by the end of the story, they both do the exact opposite to reach the happy ending. This relates back to the balancing of opposites theme presented by the cute song in the beginning.

851806,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002YLCH4,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","You may not like what I say, but please listen. Please, anyone at Disney, tell me. I'd welcome any new films from you, everything I say, even `Home on the Range.' But why are you keeping this business of producing films with `2' or something like that at the end of their titles? Now I'm begging of you, please no more these cheap sequels, which only help accelerate the downfall of the company.Yes, `Mulan II' is better than most of the numerous animations on DVD from other companies, but that does not mean that Disney can degrade the fantastic world of the original `Mulan,' which with the colorful Oriental world and a well-told story, gave us a unique heroine and a precious message. If you see the opening of the `Mulan II,' in which this annoyingly gabby dragon is bathing in a bath and put on a pedestal (literally), you immediately sense something is wrong with it.  What is missing is simple and essential -- imagination and story. For all its short running time of 79 minutes, the sequel falls apart at the earlier stage because the film itself severely suffers from the serious defects in these two basic elements.For all decent character/background designs, what you see the carbon-copied world of the original. This time, Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na again) is sent on a mission to escort three princesses who are to be married to the princes of another country for the peace of China. The story is weak, but would be acceptable if the accompanied music was better than the present songs, all of which are nothing but forgettable. The first musical scene clearly tries to emulate the funny training scene in the original, but results are barely OK imitations.[BUT THE WORST IS] easily the dragon Mushu (voiced by Mark Moseley, who replaced Eddie Murphy), who tries to frustrate not only the mission of Mulan and her love, General Shang (B.D.Wong), but also, most unbelievably, their wedding plan. And you know why? Because if they marry, the dragon loses his job! And what does he do for that purpose? Slapstick jokes that are not funny. But if your best idea is `chopsticks in your nose,' what can we expect?Still, the actors are doing good jobs. Thanks to Ming-Na, likable heroine Mulan is the same Mulan as in the first though she is given less memorable personalities. The names of actors are certainly impressive such as Lucy Liu, Sandra Oh, Harvey Fierstein, George Takei, and Pat Morita. The absence of Eddie Murphy does not affect the film at all, for Mark Moseley successfully catches the intonation of fast-talking Murphy without making his performance mere mimicry. In a sense it is amazing, but he is very good.But the story is unimaginative, and characters are less than satisfactory. Perhaps the film could be better if three princesses are more interesting with distinct traits, but the short film ends before that happens. But ultimately, I think, the real question should be this; which do you expect from Disney? Just another OK sequels, or ground-breaking, trend-setting originals? You have your own idea, and I respect that, but if you remember the glorious days that started with 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast,' I think the answer is clear.",2,"I Love Mulan, But Not This One: Another Sequel We Don't Need, Again from Disney",1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,3189,"['may', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'say', 'please', 'listen', 'Please', 'anyone', 'Disney', 'tell', ""'d"", 'welcome', 'new', 'films', 'everything', 'say', 'even', 'Home', 'Range', 'why', 'are', 'keeping', 'business', 'producing', 'films', '2', 'something', 'end', 'titles', 'Now', ""'m"", 'begging', 'please', 'more', 'cheap', 'sequels', 'only', 'help', 'accelerate', 'downfall', 'company.Yes', 'Mulan', 'II', 'better', 'most', 'numerous', 'animations', 'DVD', 'other', 'companies', 'not', 'mean', 'Disney', 'can', 'degrade', 'fantastic', 'world', 'original', 'Mulan', 'colorful', 'Oriental', 'world', 'well-told', 'story', 'gave', 'unique', 'heroine', 'precious', 'message', 'see', 'opening', 'Mulan', 'II', 'annoyingly', 'gabby', 'dragon', 'bathing', 'bath', 'put', 'pedestal', 'literally', 'immediately', 'sense', 'something', 'wrong', 'What', 'missing', 'simple', 'essential', 'imagination', 'story', 'short', 'running', 'time', '79', 'minutes', 'sequel', 'apart', 'earlier', 'stage', 'film', 'severely', 'serious', 'defects', 'two', 'basic', 'elements.For', 'decent', 'character/background', 'designs', 'what', 'see', 'carbon-copied', 'world', 'original', 'time', 'Mulan', 'voiced', 'Ming-Na', 'again', 'sent', 'mission', 'escort', 'three', 'princesses', 'who', 'are', 'be', 'married', 'princes', 'country', 'peace', 'China', 'story', 'weak', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'accompanied', 'music', 'was', 'better', 'present', 'songs', 'are', 'nothing', 'forgettable', 'first', 'musical', 'scene', 'clearly', 'emulate', 'funny', 'training', 'scene', 'original', 'results', 'are', 'barely', 'OK', 'imitations', '[', 'THE', 'WORST', 'IS', ']', 'easily', 'dragon', 'Mushu', 'voiced', 'Mark', 'Moseley', 'who', 'replaced', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'frustrate', 'not', 'only', 'mission', 'Mulan', 'love', 'General', 'Shang', 'B.D.Wong', 'also', 'most', 'unbelievably', 'wedding', 'plan', 'know', 'why', 'marry', 'dragon', 'job', 'what', 'do', 'purpose', 'Slapstick', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'best', 'idea', 'chopsticks', 'nose', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'Still', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'jobs', 'Thanks', 'Ming-Na', 'likable', 'heroine', 'Mulan', 'same', 'Mulan', 'first', 'given', 'less', 'memorable', 'personalities', 'names', 'actors', 'are', 'certainly', 'impressive', 'such', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'George', 'Takei', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'absence', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'not', 'affect', 'film', 'Mark', 'Moseley', 'successfully', 'intonation', 'fast-talking', 'Murphy', 'making', 'performance', 'mere', 'mimicry', 'sense', 'amazing', 'very', 'good.But', 'story', 'unimaginative', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'three', 'princesses', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'distinct', 'traits', 'short', 'film', 'ends', 'ultimately', 'think', 'real', 'question', 'should', 'be', 'do', 'expect', 'Disney', 'Just', 'OK', 'sequels', 'ground-breaking', 'trend-setting', 'originals', 'have', 'own', 'idea', 'respect', 'remember', 'glorious', 'days', 'started', ""'The"", 'Little', 'Mermaid', ""'Beauty"", 'Beast', 'think', 'answer', 'clear']",N/A

851808,A1IRDHA4IZFFKX,B0002YLCH4,Wesley,"[40, 43]","Being the father of a daughter, it's very important for me to find examples of strong women in real life and in art or anything else that she can see.  The original Mulan is not perfect in this respect but is surprisingly amazing in comparison to so many other films without going overboard with it (sometimes, the attempt to create strong female characters ends up causing them to be caricatures who talk about how strong they are rather than just showing it...or making them so one-dimensional that it would be impossible to relate to them).  I'm very weary of sequels, especially if they are straight to video years after the original release.  It always seems like Disney has run out of ideas and so they make sequels far removed from the original films or rush to retell in a strange fashion a historical figure.  It's often the case that it's uninspired and far from entertaining.  Mulan II avoided that.  It's been mentioned before, but I think it's important to say there are some tonal changes here.  It's far more slapsticky than the original and plays to laughs more than drama.  I don't think that's necessarily a negative.  I was surprised, for example, not to be totally disappointed by the replacement of Eddie Murphy and to find the character of Mushu still very entertaining.  On the other hand, I think the film's displacement of certain dramatic aspects makes it a little more one-dimensional than its predecessor.  I know this is a kids' film and needs not overcomplicate its concepts of relationships or of duty, but I also think that Disney has in the past (and with the first film) really excelled at making films that are classics and not just genre pieces for children.  This sequel certainly does not fail.  It's entertaining.  The songs were a delight to my daughter.  The humor was well-done and well-suited to her.  I think, though, that it will suffer over time in comparison to the first film.  She's more likely to go back to it  than the sequel.  Does this make it a bad film?  No, not at all.  I would actually give it a 3.5 star rating.
