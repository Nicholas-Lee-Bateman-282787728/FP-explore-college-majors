1320556,AE8LL9S715YTE,B00344EAI2,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[7, 11]","Once upon a time I was a fan of Clive Barker.  His short stories and his novels were some of the best horror/fantastique fiction there could ever be placed in the market.  As were the Barker movies.  Somehow though, maybe just as it has now been shown to be impossible for Mr. Barker to produce the badly needed new novels, so too is it impossible for a movie to be made that lives up to Clive Barker's original imagination.  Just as I wish Mr. Barker would be able to finally bring to conclusion stories like The Art and Galilee, so too have I wanted a good, mind twisting, with its share of blood and guts, Barker horror movie.  Make note, of course I hated ""Book of Blood"" the movie.  Long.  Tedious.  Tiresome.  There was no fear involved in that movie.  It was, all in all, a very, very bad movie that had Mr. Barker's name bound to it.  I was wary that anything good could come next after such a bad movie.  Such a pathetic attempt at a Barker story.  I found something horrifying.  Just as ""Book of Blood"" was terrible, so too is ""Dread,"" and this truly horrifies me.Of course, at first, I had high hopes that such a wonderful psychological exploration would be brought to the screen.  ""Dread"" has always called out as one of the better twisting of the mind stories that only Clive Barker could give his fans.  Ergo, the tantalizing tastes given by the various horror magazines propelled me to want to watch this movie with horrific fascination.  My hopes were dashed.  Crushed.  Obliterated.  The original short story was an excellent piece of horror that dealt with three main characters: the protagonist, the antagonist, and Dread itself.  Here we find meaningless characters thrown into the fray.  Not to help develop the storyline, but just for the sake of pushing the minutes in order to get as close to a movie length story as possible.  By the time you reach the conclusion of the story, I wanted to hit my head against the wall.  I could only find myself horrified that such a masterful short story was destroyed.  It was as if the creative vision of the original piece was slit open and all its harsh innards disgarded.  The only thing that made this a Clive Barker movie was that his name was stitched to the movie.  Nothing here was classic Barker.Thank God I didn't buy this, I just rented it from the local video store.Maybe fans of Clive Barker should finally realize that his ""time"" is now gone.  I hate saying that.  I want so much to find new avenues of hell that only the mind of Mr. Barker could help to reveal.  I want so much to finally see his works given the justice that they should be given, the glory that they should reveal.  I wont ever see this in the movies.  Though I keep such wonderful works as ""Hellraiser I and II"" and ""Candyman"" on my shelf, given the respect that they should be given.  Alas, those are works of the past.  We must admit that we will not see conclusions to his novel worlds on the printed page and that we will never see really good future interpretations of his works in the movies.  All we will get are scattered pieces of flesh, tattered, withered, and worthlessly cascading across the floor...blown by the wind of what could have been, trampled by people in the movie industry that only want to make a few dollars.With tears in the eye, we should only look away...",1,Time to Give up on Mr. Barker's Visions,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,3329,"['Once', 'time', 'was', 'fan', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'short', 'stories', 'novels', 'were', 'best', 'horror/fantastique', 'fiction', 'there', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'placed', 'market', 'were', 'Barker', 'movies', 'Somehow', 'maybe', 'just', 'now', 'been', 'shown', 'be', 'impossible', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'produce', 'badly', 'needed', 'new', 'novels', 'so', 'too', 'impossible', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'original', 'imagination', 'Just', 'wish', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'finally', 'bring', 'conclusion', 'stories', 'Art', 'Galilee', 'so', 'too', 'have', 'wanted', 'good', 'mind', 'twisting', 'share', 'blood', 'guts', 'Barker', 'horror', 'movie', 'Make', 'note', 'course', 'hated', 'Book', 'Blood', 'movie', 'Long', 'Tedious', 'Tiresome', 'was', 'fear', 'involved', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'name', 'bound', 'was', 'wary', 'anything', 'good', 'could', 'come', 'next', 'such', 'bad', 'movie', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'Barker', 'story', 'found', 'something', 'horrifying', 'Just', 'Book', 'Blood', 'was', 'terrible', 'so', 'too', 'Dread', 'truly', 'me.Of', 'course', 'first', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'wonderful', 'psychological', 'exploration', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'screen', 'Dread', 'always', 'called', 'out', 'one', 'better', 'twisting', 'mind', 'stories', 'only', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'could', 'give', 'fans', 'Ergo', 'tantalizing', 'tastes', 'given', 'various', 'horror', 'magazines', 'propelled', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'horrific', 'fascination', 'hopes', 'were', 'dashed', 'Crushed', 'Obliterated', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'excellent', 'piece', 'horror', 'dealt', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'Dread', 'Here', 'find', 'meaningless', 'characters', 'thrown', 'fray', 'Not', 'help', 'develop', 'storyline', 'just', 'sake', 'pushing', 'minutes', 'order', 'get', 'close', 'movie', 'length', 'story', 'possible', 'time', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'story', 'wanted', 'hit', 'head', 'wall', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'horrified', 'masterful', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'destroyed', 'was', 'creative', 'vision', 'original', 'piece', 'was', 'slit', 'open', 'harsh', 'innards', 'disgarded', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'movie', 'was', 'name', 'was', 'stitched', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'here', 'was', 'classic', 'Barker.Thank', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'just', 'rented', 'local', 'video', 'store.Maybe', 'fans', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'should', 'finally', 'realize', 'time', 'now', 'gone', 'hate', 'saying', 'want', 'so', 'much', 'find', 'new', 'avenues', 'hell', 'only', 'mind', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'could', 'help', 'reveal', 'want', 'so', 'much', 'finally', 'see', 'works', 'given', 'justice', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'glory', 'should', 'reveal', 'wont', 'ever', 'see', 'movies', 'keep', 'such', 'wonderful', 'works', 'Hellraiser', 'II', 'Candyman', 'shelf', 'given', 'respect', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Alas', 'are', 'works', 'past', 'must', 'admit', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'conclusions', 'novel', 'worlds', 'printed', 'page', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'future', 'interpretations', 'works', 'movies', 'will', 'get', 'are', 'scattered', 'pieces', 'flesh', 'tattered', 'withered', 'worthlessly', 'cascading', 'floor', 'blown', 'wind', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trampled', 'people', 'movie', 'industry', 'only', 'want', 'make', 'few', 'dollars.With', 'tears', 'eye', 'should', 'only', 'look', 'away']",Dread: After Dark Horrorfest 4

1320560,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00344EAI2,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","While the nature of God, and the possibility of eternal life go undiscussed, we happily chew over the minutiae of misery.- An excerpt from ""Dread,"" a short story by Clive BarkerI think I know what Barker was onto here: We're surrounded and even entertained by the suffering of others, and as such, we use it as a way to understand our own fears. It's not a very pleasant point, but at the very least, a point is being made. I suspect the film adaptation will be regarded in much the same way, hailed as a horror movie that, under the guise of violence and gore, aims to send a socially relevant message. You'll forgive me if I don't see it the same way you do. Has anyone ever stopped to consider the idea that some horror movies aren't a commentary on anything? And that those pretending to be are genuinely awful? Because writer/director Anthony DiBlasi has deluded himself into believing he was actually making a point, ""Dread"" is not merely bad, it's deplorable.The story centers on a mysterious college student known only as Quaid (Shaun Evans), who, because of a trauma he experienced as a six-year-old, has an unhealthy fixation on what people dread. He crosses paths with film major Stephan Grace (Jackson Rathbone), and the two join forces for a student project documenting people and what it is they fear most. For Quaid, interviews in front of a camera aren't enough; he wants to expose the fear itself, to force people into compromising and even dangerous situations and study the results. Maybe ""study"" is the wrong word - for him, fear is not an indulgence so much as an addiction, like heroin. By the end of the film, he has grown so dependent on it that his actions become downright sadistic.Not that he had all that far to go. From the moment he's introduced, it's obvious that he's stark raving mad. What I don't understand is why Stephan didn't catch onto this much sooner. Wouldn't you be worried if the line, ""If you don't go out and find the beast, sooner or later the beast will come and find you,"" came up in your very first conversation? No? Then how about, ""What's the worst thing that's ever happened to you?"" You'd think the appropriate response would be, ""I don't know you,"" but then again, horror movies operate under a very different set of rules. Stephan, to be sure, is able to answer Quaid's question. So is Stephan's classmate, Cheryl Fromm (Hanne Steen), who also finds herself in the film project. Let's just say that, before long, she's forced to face her fears, and believe me, it isn't pretty.One of the oddest subplots involves Stephan's friend, Abby (Laura Donnelly), who has a birthmark covering the entire right side of her body. She volunteers to be interviewed for the film, apparently unmindful of the fact that, when your appearance is involved, it's not a matter of dread but of self esteem. So what possible interest would Quaid have in her? Given his painful past, given the painful pasts of Stephan and Cheryl, given what Quaid hopes to do by exposing that pain, I fail to see how he can make a connection to self conscious behavior.Inevitable comparisons will be made between ""Dread"" and the ""Saw"" films, since both are about madmen placing their victims in terrible situations. I'm no fan of ""Saw"" or its sequels, but at least I can watch them and understand what motivates John Kramer/Jigsaw. I can't say the same thing about Quaid - I have no idea why he does what he does. With no rational driving force, with no clear sense of purpose, he comes off as nothing more than a deranged lunatic who seems to enjoy ranting philosophic psychobabble. His actions can't be justified. His methods can't be condoned. There's nothing about this character that can be explained logically. The fact that he's portrayed as being somehow insightful boggles the mind.I suspect my animosity will not be shared by others. Many will think ""Dread"" is an intelligent, realistic thriller that skillfully examines society's obsession with fear and suffering. Maybe so, if we're talking about the original Clive Barker story, which is itself problematic. But there's no reasonable way to defend the movie. It's cruel and pretentious, made to seem like it's saying something when in fact it's saying nothing at all. There's no better proof of this than the film's final scene, intended as a display of Quaid's madness but delivering as a cheap horror movie gimmick. Nothing had been building to this moment. It doesn't reveal anything about fear or human nature. When an ending is allowed to go in a direction completely different from the beginning and middle, you don't have a movie so much as an exercise in pointlessness.",2,Fear Does Strange Things to the Mind,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,4656,"['nature', 'God', 'possibility', 'eternal', 'life', 'go', 'undiscussed', 'happily', 'chew', 'minutiae', 'misery.-', 'excerpt', 'Dread', 'short', 'story', 'Clive', 'BarkerI', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'Barker', 'was', 'here', ""'re"", 'surrounded', 'even', 'entertained', 'suffering', 'others', 'such', 'use', 'way', 'understand', 'own', 'fears', 'not', 'very', 'pleasant', 'point', 'very', 'least', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'suspect', 'film', 'adaptation', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'hailed', 'horror', 'movie', 'guise', 'violence', 'gore', 'send', 'socially', 'relevant', 'message', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'stopped', 'consider', 'idea', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'commentary', 'anything', 'pretending', 'be', 'are', 'genuinely', 'awful', 'writer/director', 'Anthony', 'DiBlasi', 'deluded', 'believing', 'was', 'actually', 'making', 'point', 'Dread', 'not', 'merely', 'bad', 'deplorable.The', 'story', 'centers', 'mysterious', 'college', 'student', 'known', 'only', 'Quaid', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'who', 'trauma', 'experienced', 'six-year-old', 'unhealthy', 'fixation', 'what', 'people', 'dread', 'paths', 'film', 'major', 'Stephan', 'Grace', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'two', 'join', 'forces', 'student', 'project', 'documenting', 'people', 'what', 'fear', 'most', 'Quaid', 'interviews', 'front', 'camera', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'expose', 'fear', 'force', 'people', 'compromising', 'even', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'study', 'results', 'Maybe', 'study', 'wrong', 'word', 'fear', 'not', 'indulgence', 'so', 'much', 'addiction', 'heroin', 'end', 'film', 'grown', 'so', 'dependent', 'actions', 'become', 'downright', 'sadistic.Not', 'had', 'far', 'go', 'moment', 'introduced', 'obvious', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Stephan', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'much', 'sooner', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'worried', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'find', 'beast', 'sooner', 'later', 'beast', 'will', 'come', 'find', 'came', 'up', 'very', 'first', 'conversation', 'No', 'Then', 'how', 'about', 'What', 'worst', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', ""'d"", 'think', 'appropriate', 'response', 'would', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'then', 'again', 'horror', 'movies', 'operate', 'very', 'different', 'set', 'rules', 'Stephan', 'be', 'sure', 'able', 'answer', 'Quaid', 'question', 'Stephan', 'classmate', 'Cheryl', 'Fromm', 'Hanne', 'Steen', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'project', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'long', 'forced', 'face', 'fears', 'believe', ""n't"", 'pretty.One', 'oddest', 'subplots', 'Stephan', 'friend', 'Abby', 'Laura', 'Donnelly', 'who', 'birthmark', 'covering', 'entire', 'right', 'side', 'body', 'be', 'interviewed', 'film', 'apparently', 'unmindful', 'fact', 'when', 'appearance', 'involved', 'not', 'matter', 'dread', 'self', 'esteem', 'what', 'possible', 'interest', 'would', 'Quaid', 'have', 'Given', 'painful', 'past', 'given', 'painful', 'pasts', 'Stephan', 'Cheryl', 'given', 'what', 'Quaid', 'do', 'exposing', 'pain', 'fail', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'connection', 'self', 'conscious', 'behavior.Inevitable', 'comparisons', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'Dread', 'Saw', 'films', 'are', 'madmen', 'placing', 'victims', 'terrible', 'situations', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Saw', 'sequels', 'least', 'can', 'watch', 'understand', 'what', 'John', 'Kramer/Jigsaw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Quaid', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'what', 'rational', 'driving', 'force', 'clear', 'sense', 'purpose', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'deranged', 'lunatic', 'who', 'enjoy', 'ranting', 'philosophic', 'psychobabble', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'justified', 'methods', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'condoned', 'nothing', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'logically', 'fact', 'portrayed', 'being', 'somehow', 'insightful', 'boggles', 'mind.I', 'suspect', 'animosity', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'shared', 'others', 'Many', 'will', 'think', 'Dread', 'intelligent', 'realistic', 'thriller', 'skillfully', 'society', 'obsession', 'fear', 'suffering', 'Maybe', 'so', ""'re"", 'talking', 'original', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'story', 'problematic', 'reasonable', 'way', 'defend', 'movie', 'cruel', 'pretentious', 'made', 'seem', 'saying', 'something', 'when', 'fact', 'saying', 'nothing', 'better', 'proof', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'intended', 'display', 'Quaid', 'madness', 'delivering', 'cheap', 'horror', 'movie', 'gimmick', 'Nothing', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'moment', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'fear', 'human', 'nature', 'When', 'ending', 'allowed', 'go', 'direction', 'completely', 'different', 'beginning', 'middle', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'exercise', 'pointlessness']",Dread: After Dark Horrorfest 4

Amazon mentions that Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Candyman) produced this film, but fails to mention that it's based on a story that he wrote in 1984.What I appreciated most about the movie was the production.  The visuals are great, the colors are terrific, and the lighting is excellent.  Director Anthony Diblasi had worked with Clive Barker before as a producer for his movies, but this was actually his first time behind the lens.  As his directorial debut, I just have to say that Diblasi did a brilliant job, I can't wait to see what he cooks up next.The film's cast does a good job, though the dialogue isn't particularly special.  The concept isn't very original, which is what cost the review a star.  The film doesn't really pick up steam until the last 30 minutes, and that's really when the blood starts flowing.  One hardcore scene even tempted me to look away in disgust, which I appreciate so much more than other new horror flicks that only assume lots of blood will do the same trick (it doesn't).This isn't Saw or Hellraiser, and though Clive's story was original back in 1984, the concept could have been better as far as movies go.

Entering the world of ""Dread"" with an open mind will yield a film that is at once interesting and horrifying in the end result.  It contains a more than fair portion of gore effects, heart felt acting from mostly unknown actors, a slightly changed storyline from the short story by Clive Barker, and high end psychological horror.Those who panned the film probably were expecting ""Hellraiser"" or something of that caliber.  Perhaps ""A"" list horror was the expectation and low budget was the disappointing result. Dread does not have the startling moments that is standard fair for horror films.  It does not have a loud booming sound while a creature jumps into the face of the audience.  What sets this film apart from others is the scripting.  The story's suggestion that everyone has certain fears and may benefit from trying to face them is somewhat unique, and the actors certainly do a good job of fleshing out that which, in the end, is very unpleasant and disturbing.Being that the goal of horror is to create discomfort in the viewer, or reader, ""Dread"" succeeds on all counts.  It is not ""Friday the Thirteenth"" or ""Halloween.""  It is a think firm, thus the pacing will have a slow build up to allow the viewers to buy in to each carnivorous concept.

Didn't even know there was one until I noticed a special feature about it.Nonetheless, it seemed more interesting a horror movie (let alone torture) than most of the other Afterdark Horrorfest films. And I was NOT dissappointed at all. Most horror movies, in my experience, simply rely on a formulaic tale of people being held against their will (usually in some sort of bounding chair) and devices being used to cut, disembody, decapitate, etc. them apart with next to no real story.This was different... very different.A college proffesor has groups of students study whatever they wish to. A small group decides to study what makes people fear the things they do. Yet the one that decides on the project has the worst fear of them all, with deep roots in his past. And yet, with all the people they interview to find some good fears and experiences... pretty much all of them are either typical or stupid, whether it's the fear or the story. Until one in the group reveals her dread of meat and explains why she's a vegetarian, and another girl explains why she's been a lifelong pariah because of her birthmark.Even after everyone finds out each other's worst fears and stories, that's not enough for the project's head. He goes farther than anyone would have expected- willing to play out each person's worst dread: the fear of meat, the fear of being seen, the fear of being deaf, even the fear of... self.The one scene to really shake me hard (among a couple others) was a video being shown that revealed someone knew someone else's secret and taunted her, to the point where she wanted her secret scrubbed off. Then only to walk naked and bleeding profusely, you can't help just to feel sorry for her, you can also feel her pain. The only other torture to really give me the creeps was for the one who's afraid of being deaf- strapping empty bottles to his ears, teasing a bit about not hearing anything, taking them off, then shooting a gun right next to each other and making the deafness permanent. No other horror movie has done something to effectively give me the jumps without trying to kill anyone.This was definitely among the best torture films I'd seen since it deals with the roots and root meaning of torture and individual horrors.",5,Dreadfully entertaining,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,2314,"['Right', 'bat', 'should', 'mention', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'one', 'noticed', 'special', 'feature', 'it.Nonetheless', 'seemed', 'more', 'interesting', 'horror', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'torture', 'most', 'other', 'Afterdark', 'Horrorfest', 'films', 'was', 'NOT', 'dissappointed', 'Most', 'horror', 'movies', 'experience', 'simply', 'rely', 'formulaic', 'tale', 'people', 'being', 'held', 'will', 'usually', 'sort', 'bounding', 'chair', 'devices', 'being', 'used', 'cut', 'disembody', 'decapitate', 'etc', 'apart', 'next', 'real', 'story.This', 'was', 'different', 'very', 'different.A', 'college', 'proffesor', 'groups', 'students', 'study', 'wish', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'study', 'what', 'people', 'fear', 'things', 'do', 'one', 'project', 'worst', 'fear', 'deep', 'roots', 'past', 'yet', 'people', 'interview', 'find', 'good', 'fears', 'experiences', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'typical', 'stupid', 'fear', 'story', 'one', 'group', 'dread', 'meat', 'why', 'vegetarian', 'girl', 'why', 'been', 'lifelong', 'pariah', 'birthmark.Even', 'everyone', 'out', 'other', 'worst', 'fears', 'stories', 'not', 'enough', 'project', 'head', 'farther', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'expected-', 'willing', 'play', 'out', 'person', 'worst', 'dread', 'fear', 'meat', 'fear', 'being', 'seen', 'fear', 'being', 'deaf', 'even', 'fear', 'self.The', 'one', 'scene', 'really', 'shake', 'hard', 'couple', 'others', 'was', 'video', 'being', 'shown', 'revealed', 'someone', 'knew', 'someone', 'else', 'secret', 'taunted', 'point', 'where', 'wanted', 'secret', 'scrubbed', 'off', 'Then', 'only', 'walk', 'naked', 'bleeding', 'profusely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'just', 'feel', 'sorry', 'can', 'also', 'feel', 'pain', 'only', 'other', 'torture', 'really', 'give', 'creeps', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'afraid', 'being', 'deaf-', 'strapping', 'empty', 'bottles', 'ears', 'teasing', 'bit', 'not', 'hearing', 'anything', 'taking', 'off', 'then', 'shooting', 'gun', 'right', 'next', 'other', 'making', 'deafness', 'permanent', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'done', 'something', 'effectively', 'give', 'jumps', 'trying', 'kill', 'anyone.This', 'was', 'definitely', 'best', 'torture', 'films', ""'d"", 'seen', 'roots', 'root', 'meaning', 'torture', 'individual', 'horrors']",Dread: After Dark Horrorfest 4

1320569,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00344EAI2,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","The After Dark Horrorfest breathes cinematic life into a 30 year old Clive Barker story in this difficult-to-watch film about obsession, fear and psychological torture.  Written and directed by (at the time) fledgling director Anthony DiBlasi (The Profane Exhibit segment &#34;Mother May I&#34;, Cassadaga) and from the story originally penned by Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions), Dread was the bell of the ball for 2010's After Dark Horrorfest 4.The story focuses on three troubled souls: Stephen (Jackson Rathbone) lost his older brother to a car accident, Quaid (Shaun Evans) witnessed the brutal murder of his parents, and Cheryl (Hanne Steen) was abused by her father.  These three film students with three haunted pasts come together to pursue an academic film study of fear for a class project designed to interview subjects and plumb their way to the root of how their fears affect them.At some point this &#34;study&#34; becomes unsatisfying for one of the filmmakers, who finds the need to push the project beyond any reasonable (or sane) level.  Past fear subjects are revisited and forced to relive and/or confront their debilitating fear.Vivid camerawork accompanied by visceral, creatively approahced gore serve us well, adding much needed dimension to the oft-stale genre.  A broad range of effective lighting techniques, color correction and innovative gore effects sporadically litter this film with pleasant surprises.  Pleasant in hindsight, that is, since these scenes are often shocking when first encountered.  Almost reminiscent of Flatliners (1990), some psychological-hallucinogenic self-torment complements harmful situations imposed by more tangible antagonists.The scenes that best illustrate such carefully shot images are what I'll call &#34;the stripper scene&#34; and &#34;the steak.&#34;  They utilize effects (including solid sound-editing/mixing) and create tones that are not necessarily ground-breaking in uniqueness, but they're done so well overall that these scenes really stuck with me.The writing is nothing special, but the actors are all quite convincing.  I only wish that more time was dedicated to developing the plot from &#34;conducting a film study&#34; to &#34;becoming obsessed with human dread&#34; before the story flew off the hinges in the third act.  I enjoyed the ending.  I just would have enjoyed a more gradual descent into madness on the parts of both the film students and their subjects.Overall I was quite impressed and would recommend this to fans of the &#34;difficult to watch&#34; flavors of horror.  Anyone in need of more convincing should search for &#34;Dread&#34; on r/Horror (Reddit).

I have seen many past installments of the After Dark Horrorfest and some have been quite gory while others have not.  There were a couple of pretty graphic scenes involving evisceration and ax-murdering, and one now notorious anti-vegetarian scene involving a steak that had me wincing and turning away from the screen...the steak scene even summoned my gag reflex, admittedly. But overall, this movie was more psychological thriller than horror.  And there is nothing wrong with that...The movie starts you out on the edge of your seat and soon simmers down to a low boil.  There is quite a lengthy stretch of mostly talking, some semi-graphic sex, and a few fists thrown...this all goes on for awhile and then the last 20 minutes or so bring you to the edge once again, for a pretty disturbing, if not abrupt ending.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and thought it was worth my investment of a few bucks.  The acting is pretty outstanding, especially compared to the quality of acting in previous installments of this series.  Most people will watch this film, I'm sure, because sometimes-sparkly vampire Jackson Rathbone heads the cast, and hopefully they will leave this movie with a new appreciation for his craft and less attention on his sex appeal...not that he is or isn't appealing...but he is certainly a capable thespian who is much underappreciated (probably due mostly to the poorly written roles he's become known for thus far, and his unfortunate preteen/teen fanbase).  He did a fantastic and convincing job as sensitive and empathetic, yet traumatized Stephen Grace, and he really has one of the most expressive faces I've seen in films.  It's like when he feels it, he really feels it.  So kudos to Mr. Rathbone.  He should be very proud of the work he's done with this one...Next in the lineup is Shaun Evans as the deeply disturbed Quaid.  He also does an outstanding job with his character (aside from a wee bit of trouble masking his accent) but unfortunately the movie left me wanting more from him.  It seems as though just when we are gaining some insight into why Quaid is what he is and we are beginning to understand what motivates him, the movie is pushed into warp drive and flown quickly to the end.  That is my one big complaint with the movie.  Just as the characters are fleshing out nicely the movie seems to get sucked into a wormhole and rushed to the end, nearly skipping the climax in the process.  The same goes for the two main female characters.  We are only given a quick glimpse of what makes them tick, or in this case afraid, and then it's onto other things...though Abby's issues are blatantly superficial and kinda hard to miss.  So demerit for the director on that one.All in all, I think this movie should've been longer; at least a full 2 hours.  With more character development it would've gained 5 stars from me.

He is completely unaffected by watching someone he knows die or causing someone to suffer.

Not in the way Autopsy or Wrong Turn 2 is nasty - it's awful in that you witness things you wished you hadn't and then have difficulty forgetting them.Dread also has the pedigree of being yet another short story from Clive Barker's Book of Blood series. The guy has talent, I'll give him that.Dread is deceptive in its presentation.  It has a pretty-boy lead that you want to punch in the face (Jackson Rathbone), a blonde smirking psychopath that you love to hate (Shaun Evans), and a messy goth girl who is conflicted (Hanne Steen).  It's easy to dismiss everyone as being a self-absorbed jerk that deserves whatever happens to them.  And what happens to them is a social experiment in divulging students' worst fears - fears that ultimately reveal the trio's dark secrets.By the second half of the film we have a host of willing dupes who have shared their secret terrors a little too openly.  Writer and director Anthony DiBlasi knows all about the Facebook generation and shows how they exchange privacy for vulnerability. In the hands of a psychopath like Quaid (Evans) this is a very, very bad idea.After the moping and the blue lens and the Generation Now rock music, Dread finally gets down to business. Quaid, who witnessed his parents murdered by a serial killer, has some issues to work out and he prefers to use people as his therapy. He mentally tortures everyone: the vegetarian abused by her father, the pretty boy who lost his brother to a car accident, the hot chick with birth marks all over her body, and the kid terrified of going deaf.  No one is safe.Mental torture on screen is a tricky thing, but DiBlasi handles it with aplomb, tearing away layer after layer until he gets to the raw core of Quaid's victims. You're bound to identify with one of them, and that's when Dread hits a nerve.SPOILERS: By far the best scene is the fear of deafness. This is a fear that can be viscerally experienced through cinematography.  The victim, reduced to begging for his mother, is heart-wrenching.  It is topped only by the slow erosion of the vegetarian's will as she is left with nothing but a rotting piece of meat as a meal.  Time lapse photography tells the story.Dread builds its namesake slowly, deliberately, and meticulously.  Its only at the gut punch ending do we comprehend that the pace was intentional, the irritating navel-gazing a necessity, the self-absorption a critical part of how the victims are torn screaming out of their little bubbles of sanity.  Dread isn't perfect, but it's dreadful enough to earn a proud place next to any of Barker's supernaturally-themed works.",4,"Dreadful, and that's a good thing",1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,2688,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'sorry', 'saw', 'Dread.Mind', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'Dread', 'nasty', 'Not', 'way', 'Autopsy', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'nasty', 'awful', 'witness', 'things', 'wished', 'had', ""n't"", 'then', 'have', 'difficulty', 'forgetting', 'them.Dread', 'also', 'pedigree', 'being', 'yet', 'short', 'story', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Book', 'Blood', 'series', 'guy', 'talent', ""'ll"", 'give', 'that.Dread', 'deceptive', 'presentation', 'pretty-boy', 'lead', 'want', 'punch', 'face', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'blonde', 'smirking', 'psychopath', 'love', 'hate', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'messy', 'goth', 'girl', 'who', 'conflicted', 'Hanne', 'Steen', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'everyone', 'being', 'self-absorbed', 'jerk', 'what', 'social', 'experiment', 'divulging', 'students', 'worst', 'fears', 'fears', 'ultimately', 'reveal', 'trio', 'dark', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'have', 'host', 'willing', 'dupes', 'who', 'have', 'shared', 'secret', 'terrors', 'little', 'too', 'openly', 'Writer', 'director', 'Anthony', 'DiBlasi', 'Facebook', 'generation', 'how', 'exchange', 'privacy', 'vulnerability', 'hands', 'psychopath', 'Quaid', 'Evans', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'idea.After', 'moping', 'blue', 'Generation', 'Now', 'music', 'Dread', 'finally', 'down', 'business', 'Quaid', 'who', 'witnessed', 'parents', 'murdered', 'serial', 'killer', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'use', 'people', 'therapy', 'mentally', 'everyone', 'vegetarian', 'abused', 'father', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'brother', 'car', 'accident', 'hot', 'chick', 'birth', 'marks', 'body', 'kid', 'terrified', 'going', 'deaf', 'one', 'safe.Mental', 'torture', 'screen', 'tricky', 'thing', 'DiBlasi', 'aplomb', 'tearing', 'away', 'layer', 'layer', 'raw', 'core', 'Quaid', 'victims', ""'re"", 'bound', 'identify', 'one', 'when', 'Dread', 'nerve.SPOILERS', 'far', 'best', 'scene', 'fear', 'deafness', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'viscerally', 'experienced', 'cinematography', 'victim', 'reduced', 'begging', 'mother', 'heart-wrenching', 'topped', 'only', 'slow', 'erosion', 'vegetarian', 'will', 'left', 'nothing', 'rotting', 'piece', 'meat', 'meal', 'Time', 'lapse', 'photography', 'story.Dread', 'namesake', 'slowly', 'deliberately', 'meticulously', 'only', 'gut', 'punch', 'ending', 'do', 'comprehend', 'pace', 'was', 'intentional', 'irritating', 'navel-gazing', 'necessity', 'self-absorption', 'critical', 'part', 'how', 'victims', 'are', 'torn', 'screaming', 'little', 'bubbles', 'sanity', 'Dread', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'dreadful', 'enough', 'earn', 'proud', 'place', 'next', 'Barker', 'supernaturally-themed', 'works']",Dread: After Dark Horrorfest 4

1320584,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00344EAI2,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[19, 24]","The last of 2010's Afterdark Horrorfest films was also the one I was most anticipating - the trailer made it seem awfully dark - and to be sure, of the eight, this is easily the most disturbing in terms of where it goes.The concept is that three college students embark on a study of fear, or ""dread,"" which means interviewing people about their fears and how they came by them.  Each person conveniently has a dark story in their past (perhaps I lived a sheltered life - my scariest moment was falling off my bike and getting stiches).The leader of the group, Quaid, seems to have a personal interest in the study, and begins to take things further and further until he first alienates his partners, and then turns quite nasty toward them and some of the interviewees.  The final third of the film shows some very disturbing moments indeed as he attempts to plumb the depths of people's personal fears.I will say up front that, of the eight films, DREAD features the best performances, across the board - and it helps that the writing is also top notch.  Unlike THE FINAL's laughable attempt at pathos, or KILL THEORY's outlandish plot, DREAD manages to explore similar tones and territory, yet remain grounded in plausibility and intelligence.The problem I have with the film, however, is while it features many great scenes and ideas, the final combined piece doesn't quite hit the mark as well as it could have.  Frankly, I think this is one of the few Afterdark films that really should have been longer - possibly a full 120 minutes.  I think it would have been nicer to pace Quaid's descent into madness throughout the film, as well as the extreme reactions his victims took - rather than having all these things happen at once in the final twenty minutes.  After a slow 55 minutes, the final third of the film flies by and, as a result, threatens to fly off the hinges - motivations get weaker and weaker as characters stop really thinking and talking, and simply start reacting.Also, the final denoument between the male leads seemed a bit contrived for the sake of shock.  It's almost as if the writers just ran out of places to go, so they went for the now-typical dark ending.Overall, this is definitely one of the more notable entries in the year's festival - with a little more control over the final third, I might have placed it at the top.

1320585,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B00344EAI2,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Anthony DiBlasi adapted Dread from Clive Barker's short story to the big screen by writing the screenplay and directing it. While this is the first movie that DiBlasi has written or directed (and managed to tackle both) he is clearly no stranger to Clive Barker's work and is obviously a fan as he produced The Plague, Book of Blood, The Midnight Meat Train as well as is working on the new Hellraiser, and another untitled Barker project. With so much experience with Clive you know he's got a taste for what makes Barker's writing work and this film is no exception. If anything now that he has had a more direct hand in the creation of a Barker film it's only ended up even better.Having not read the short story I cannot give you any commentary on how it holds up against the subject material. What I can tell you though from having read a lot of Clive Barker novels and short stories is that it feels like something Clive Barker would have written if it were properly caught on screen. There are two leads in this story Stephen Grace (Jackson Rathbone) and Quaid (Shaun Evans.) Grace is a film student who is attempting figure out what he wants to do for his final project and ends up becoming friends with Quaid who pushes him towards making a documentary about what people dread and how this is build upon fear. They recruit an editor who Grace slowly ends up falling in love with and who is the one who finally gives them an idea of dread they can run with instead of the normal run of the mill fears people suffer from.We slowly learn as the film progresses that Quaid has his own dread. He is trying to use this documentary as a way to understand what is wrong with him and find a way to cure it. What we don't know until it is almost too late that Quaid's dread is actually that he insane and is feeding off of the fears and dreads of others to further the mind games that is has begun to play with Grace, their editor, and another one of Grace's friends. The mind games turn real though as in the later half of the film Quaid starts to force people to suffer through what they truly dread. The film really does start slow and there isn't quite a bit on the payoff for horror fans until later in the film but when it starts to kick in the buildup just keeps going through the end and pays off.The film itself has a very disturbing end as the 'fears' of having to be stuck with this insanity really does prove to give way to dread in the way the finale is portrayed. DiBlasi may not have a lot of previous writing or directing credits to his name but this is another director to keep your eye on and I for one can't wait to see what he's going to be working on next.",4,Dread brings us a very interesting 'case study',1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2676,"['Anthony', 'DiBlasi', 'adapted', 'Dread', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'short', 'story', 'big', 'screen', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'first', 'movie', 'DiBlasi', 'written', 'directed', 'managed', 'tackle', 'clearly', 'no', 'stranger', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'work', 'obviously', 'fan', 'produced', 'Plague', 'Book', 'Blood', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'as', 'well', 'working', 'new', 'Hellraiser', 'untitled', 'Barker', 'project', 'so', 'much', 'experience', 'Clive', 'know', 'got', 'taste', 'what', 'Barker', 'writing', 'work', 'film', 'exception', 'anything', 'now', 'had', 'more', 'direct', 'hand', 'creation', 'Barker', 'film', 'only', 'ended', 'up', 'even', 'better.Having', 'not', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'commentary', 'how', 'up', 'subject', 'material', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'having', 'read', 'lot', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'novels', 'short', 'stories', 'something', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'were', 'properly', 'caught', 'screen', 'are', 'two', 'leads', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Grace', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'Quaid', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'Grace', 'film', 'student', 'who', 'attempting', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'final', 'project', 'up', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Quaid', 'who', 'towards', 'making', 'documentary', 'what', 'people', 'dread', 'how', 'build', 'fear', 'recruit', 'editor', 'who', 'Grace', 'slowly', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'finally', 'idea', 'dread', 'can', 'run', 'instead', 'normal', 'run', 'mill', 'people', 'suffer', 'from.We', 'slowly', 'learn', 'film', 'Quaid', 'own', 'dread', 'trying', 'use', 'documentary', 'way', 'understand', 'what', 'wrong', 'find', 'way', 'cure', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'Quaid', 'dread', 'actually', 'insane', 'feeding', 'fears', 'dreads', 'others', 'further', 'mind', 'games', 'begun', 'play', 'Grace', 'editor', 'one', 'Grace', 'friends', 'mind', 'games', 'turn', 'real', 'later', 'half', 'film', 'Quaid', 'force', 'people', 'suffer', 'what', 'truly', 'dread', 'film', 'really', 'start', 'slow', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bit', 'payoff', 'horror', 'fans', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'kick', 'buildup', 'just', 'going', 'end', 'off.The', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'end', ""'fears"", 'having', 'be', 'stuck', 'insanity', 'really', 'prove', 'give', 'way', 'dread', 'way', 'finale', 'portrayed', 'DiBlasi', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'previous', 'writing', 'directing', 'credits', 'name', 'director', 'keep', 'eye', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'working', 'next']",Dread: After Dark Horrorfest 4
