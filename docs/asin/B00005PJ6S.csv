673319,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005PJ6S,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","After the success of the first film in 1972, 1974 saw the release of The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. Unlike the first film, written and directed by Ralph Bakshi, this was written by Fred Halliday, Eric Monte, and Robert Taylor, as well as being directed by the latter.The film is told in a series of short vignettes, each detailing a misadventure in the life of Fritz the Cat.Skip Hinnant returns to voice the feline, now unhappily married and living on welfare in the 1970s. The movie opens with Fritz being berated by his wife. So, being a responsible husband, Fritz lights a joint and drifts away into a series of irreverent misadventures, beginning with him seducing a young ""girl."" Later, he meets God in the form of a homeless wino. Then, he becomes a member of the Nazi party, where he meets Adolph Hitler (represented by a dog). Finally, Fritz finds himself in the middle of a political assassination plot, before meeting an Indian guru in the city sewer, and lastly, meeting Satan (allowing the filmmakers the opportunity to add homosexual stereotypes to their repertoire).Also in the film is one very long, drawn out, dull 1940s sequence that runs about six minutes and could've been cut out of the film without affecting anything.Still, the sequel goes more for entertainment than the first film did and some moments in this film are much funnier than anything in the first movie.The sequel avoids much of the social commentary provided by the first movie. Many of the racial/cultural issues are similarly avoided. It still has its fair share of racial stereotypes, but takes a completely different direction overall. Once again, it wouldn't be hard to brand this movie ""racist"" to an extent, but the stereotypical behavior is so outlandish that it doesn't elicit much reaction.At the risk of over generalizing, this film will appeal more to stoners than anyone else. The sequel is on par with the original, but not particularly entertaining or anything special really. It's amusing, but if you never see it, you won't be missing a whole lot.C+",3,On Par With the Original; Decent,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2056,"['success', 'first', 'film', '1972', '1974', 'saw', 'release', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'first', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'written', 'Fred', 'Halliday', 'Eric', 'Monte', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'directed', 'latter.The', 'film', 'told', 'series', 'short', 'vignettes', 'detailing', 'misadventure', 'life', 'Fritz', 'Cat.Skip', 'Hinnant', 'voice', 'feline', 'now', 'unhappily', 'married', 'living', 'welfare', '1970s', 'movie', 'Fritz', 'being', 'berated', 'wife', 'So', 'being', 'responsible', 'husband', 'Fritz', 'joint', 'drifts', 'away', 'series', 'irreverent', 'misadventures', 'beginning', 'seducing', 'young', 'girl', 'Later', 'God', 'form', 'homeless', 'wino', 'Then', 'member', 'Nazi', 'party', 'where', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'represented', 'dog', 'Finally', 'Fritz', 'middle', 'political', 'assassination', 'plot', 'meeting', 'Indian', 'guru', 'city', 'sewer', 'lastly', 'meeting', 'Satan', 'allowing', 'filmmakers', 'opportunity', 'add', 'homosexual', 'stereotypes', 'repertoire', '.Also', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'dull', '1940s', 'sequence', 'six', 'minutes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'affecting', 'anything.Still', 'sequel', 'more', 'entertainment', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'funnier', 'anything', 'first', 'movie.The', 'sequel', 'avoids', 'much', 'social', 'commentary', 'provided', 'first', 'movie', 'Many', 'racial/cultural', 'issues', 'are', 'similarly', 'avoided', 'still', 'fair', 'share', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'overall', 'Once', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'brand', 'movie', 'racist', 'extent', 'stereotypical', 'behavior', 'so', 'outlandish', ""n't"", 'elicit', 'much', 'reaction.At', 'risk', 'generalizing', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'more', 'stoners', 'anyone', 'else', 'sequel', 'par', 'original', 'not', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'anything', 'special', 'really', 'amusing', 'never', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'whole', 'lot.C+']",The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat
