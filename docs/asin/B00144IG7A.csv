Lush ""erinl22""","[0, 0]","I never really watched this show on TV when it was on, but for some reason I saw it at the store and decided to buy the 1st season. I was hooked! Every episode you're laughing to you're crying or almost peeing your pants. It's usually Van that gets me going or Cheyenne's ditziness. Or it could be Reba's laugh or the way she says moron. It's a great show and I now own every season and watch it all the time even the reruns on TV. So if you like comedy pick this up! You won't regret it!",5,I laugh everytime I watch it!,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,488,"['never', 'really', 'watched', 'show', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'reason', 'saw', 'store', 'decided', 'buy', '1st', 'season', 'was', 'hooked', 'episode', ""'re"", 'laughing', ""'re"", 'crying', 'almost', 'peeing', 'pants', 'usually', 'Van', 'going', 'Cheyenne', 'ditziness', 'could', 'be', 'Reba', 'laugh', 'way', 'moron', 'great', 'show', 'now', 'own', 'season', 'watch', 'time', 'even', 'reruns', 'TV', 'So', 'like', 'comedy', 'pick', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Reba - Seasons 1-4

1145122,ACT1EPHFS9E7V,B00144IG7A,true crime reader,"[1, 1]",I never watched Reba when it first came on but now is comes on a cable station at 8:00 & I found it one evening when I was channel surfing. I thought it was a really cute show & really got to like it so I bought all 4 seasons & I am so glad I did. If you are watching the reruns & like it do buy all 4 seasons. The first season tells you just how everything started about how Reba's husband got his tect. preg. And it goes from there but it is a comedy,5,cute show,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,452,"['never', 'watched', 'Reba', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'now', 'cable', 'station', '8:00', 'found', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'was', 'channel', 'surfing', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'show', 'really', 'got', 'like', 'so', 'bought', '4', 'seasons', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'are', 'watching', 'reruns', 'do', 'buy', '4', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'tells', 'just', 'how', 'everything', 'started', 'how', 'Reba', 'husband', 'got', 'tect', 'preg', 'there', 'comedy']",Reba - Seasons 1-4

I think it is a great tv series with family values and some good clean fun. This is hard to find in the the world we live in. Hey Reba give us some more.
