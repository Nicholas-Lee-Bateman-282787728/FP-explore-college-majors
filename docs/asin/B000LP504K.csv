1039582,A1V359XAMSXP7Y,B000LP504K,bryan12603,"[1, 1]","This is a review ofSpring in a Small Town(1948), a film that has been hailed as the greatest Chinese film of all time. The first thing I noticed was the language.  Even with my rudimentary command of Chinese, I could follow most of the dialogue even without the subtitles.  This reflects the fact that the film focuses on quotidian details of everyday life:  going for a walk, commenting on the weather, making a bed.  But in these details is a moving story with deep significance for a Chinese audience.  The film is slow-moving and subtle.  One reviewer here on amazon.com compared the style to that of Bergmann, but a friend of mine compared it to Yasujiro OZU (Tokyo Story (The Criterion Collection)[1953]), which I think is more appropriate.There are only five characters in the story.  Liyan is the ""Young Master"" of the household.  He is sick with tuberculosis, and perpetually irritable.  Yuwen is his wife, the narrator of the story.  She is strong, beautiful, and passionate.  However, she feels trapped in her existence. As she says at one point, ""I do not have the courage to die, and Liyan does not have the courage to live.""  The other members of the household are the one remaining servant, Lao Huang, and Liyan's sister, who is usually referred to as Meimei. (This is really a title, ""Younger Sister,"" and not a name.) A fifth character soon arrives, throwing the house out of its entropy:  Zhichen.  He is the best friend of Liyan from childhood, but he does not realize until he arrives that Liyan's wife is Yuwen, with whom he was in love before the war.Anyone can enjoy the plot and performances.  However, much of what makes this a truly great film will not be obvious to Western audiences, unless they are familiar with the historical context for the story. At the start of the 20th century, China made the painful transition from its last imperial dynasty to a modern Western-style government.  However, soon after the government defeated the last of the warlords and established effective central control, Japan invaded, killing millions and occupying much of China.  Spring in a Small Town is set right after the end of World War II.  The family of Liyan was once wealthy and successful under the Qing dynasty, but the mansion he has inherited is now run down and partially destroyed from the years of warfare.  Liyan always dresses in a traditional scholar's gown, and is often seen reading books dating from the Qing dynasty.  Stagnant and ill, he symbolizes China's once-glorious past.  His younger sister is young enough that she has a fresh perspective on life, and an air of vitality and innocence not shared by the other members of her household.  She represents China's potential for the future.  Zhichen, the old friend, has become a doctor.  He always wears Western-style clothing, and represents those Chinese of the May 4th Movement who saw China's best hope in learning from the West.  Yuwen embodies the dilemma that China faced in the early 20th century:  be loyal to tradition (which, for all of its weaknesses, had its own kindness and dignity) or leave the past behind and go with the modern trends brought from the West.  Finally, Lao Huang represents, I think, the masses of Chinese peasants and workers, passively waiting for someone to guide them.The film is undoubtedly deeply symbolic, and Western viewers need some kind of entry point for understanding what it means.  However, my account above is oversimplified, and makes the film seem one-dimensional when in fact it is complex and multi-layered.  The characters are not cardboard cutouts (especially not Liyan, Yuwen, and Zhichen).  Their emotions and the tensions they must live through are complex and feel very vivid.  In the end, the film gives us not so much a pat political message as a testament to the complexity and nobility of human motivations.The film did not stand out when it was originally released.  Not surprising, given that the civil war between the Communists and Nationalists reignited after the Japanese were defeated.  Once the Communists took control of the Mainland, a film like this could only seem decadent and bourgeois.  The director, Fei Mu, died tragically young in 1951, and he was largely forgotten.  It was only after the end of the Cultural Revolution and the beginning of China's new openness to the West that the Chinese film community rediscovered Spring in a Small Town and deemed it a masterpiece.  There is also a remake of it,Springtime in a Small Town(2002), which I have not had the opportunity to watch.One warning about the film:  the quality of the print is poor. The soundtrack is also bad, sometimes cutting out at key points. (To the best of my knowledge, there is only one print of the film.) This is a film that cries out for restoration, and it is surprising that no one has raised the funds to do so yet.  Nonetheless, it is well worth watching, even in this version.",5,A moving plot with deep symbolism,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,4925,"['review', 'ofSpring', 'Small', 'Town', '1948', 'film', 'been', 'hailed', 'greatest', 'Chinese', 'film', 'time', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'language', 'Even', 'rudimentary', 'command', 'Chinese', 'could', 'follow', 'most', 'dialogue', 'even', 'subtitles', 'fact', 'film', 'quotidian', 'details', 'everyday', 'life', 'going', 'walk', 'commenting', 'weather', 'making', 'bed', 'details', 'moving', 'story', 'deep', 'significance', 'Chinese', 'audience', 'film', 'slow-moving', 'subtle', 'One', 'reviewer', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'compared', 'style', 'Bergmann', 'friend', 'mine', 'compared', 'Yasujiro', 'OZU', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', '1953', ']', 'think', 'more', 'are', 'only', 'five', 'characters', 'story', 'Liyan', 'Young', 'Master', 'household', 'sick', 'tuberculosis', 'perpetually', 'irritable', 'Yuwen', 'wife', 'narrator', 'story', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'However', 'trapped', 'existence', 'one', 'point', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'die', 'Liyan', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'live', 'other', 'members', 'household', 'are', 'one', 'remaining', 'servant', 'Lao', 'Huang', 'Liyan', 'sister', 'who', 'usually', 'referred', 'Meimei', 'really', 'title', 'Younger', 'Sister', 'not', 'name', 'fifth', 'character', 'soon', 'throwing', 'house', 'entropy', 'Zhichen', 'best', 'friend', 'Liyan', 'childhood', 'not', 'realize', 'Liyan', 'wife', 'Yuwen', 'whom', 'was', 'love', 'war.Anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'plot', 'performances', 'However', 'much', 'what', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'obvious', 'Western', 'audiences', 'are', 'familiar', 'historical', 'context', 'story', 'start', '20th', 'century', 'China', 'made', 'painful', 'transition', 'last', 'imperial', 'dynasty', 'modern', 'Western-style', 'government', 'However', 'soon', 'government', 'defeated', 'last', 'warlords', 'established', 'effective', 'central', 'control', 'Japan', 'invaded', 'killing', 'millions', 'occupying', 'much', 'China', 'Spring', 'Small', 'Town', 'set', 'right', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'family', 'Liyan', 'was', 'once', 'wealthy', 'successful', 'Qing', 'dynasty', 'mansion', 'inherited', 'now', 'run', 'down', 'partially', 'destroyed', 'years', 'warfare', 'Liyan', 'always', 'traditional', 'scholar', 'gown', 'often', 'seen', 'reading', 'books', 'dating', 'Qing', 'dynasty', 'Stagnant', 'ill', 'China', 'once-glorious', 'past', 'younger', 'sister', 'young', 'enough', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'life', 'air', 'vitality', 'innocence', 'not', 'shared', 'other', 'members', 'household', 'China', 'potential', 'future', 'Zhichen', 'old', 'friend', 'become', 'doctor', 'always', 'Western-style', 'clothing', 'Chinese', 'May', '4th', 'Movement', 'who', 'saw', 'China', 'best', 'hope', 'learning', 'West', 'Yuwen', 'dilemma', 'China', 'faced', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'be', 'loyal', 'tradition', 'weaknesses', 'had', 'own', 'kindness', 'dignity', 'leave', 'past', 'behind', 'go', 'modern', 'trends', 'brought', 'West', 'Finally', 'Lao', 'Huang', 'think', 'masses', 'Chinese', 'peasants', 'workers', 'passively', 'waiting', 'someone', 'guide', 'them.The', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'deeply', 'symbolic', 'Western', 'viewers', 'need', 'kind', 'entry', 'point', 'understanding', 'what', 'However', 'account', 'oversimplified', 'film', 'seem', 'one-dimensional', 'when', 'fact', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'especially', 'not', 'Liyan', 'Yuwen', 'Zhichen', 'emotions', 'tensions', 'must', 'live', 'are', 'complex', 'feel', 'very', 'vivid', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pat', 'political', 'message', 'testament', 'complexity', 'nobility', 'human', 'motivations.The', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Not', 'surprising', 'given', 'civil', 'war', 'Communists', 'Nationalists', 'reignited', 'Japanese', 'were', 'defeated', 'Communists', 'took', 'control', 'Mainland', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'seem', 'decadent', 'bourgeois', 'director', 'Fei', 'Mu', 'died', 'tragically', 'young', '1951', 'was', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'was', 'only', 'end', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'beginning', 'China', 'new', 'openness', 'West', 'Chinese', 'film', 'community', 'rediscovered', 'Spring', 'Small', 'Town', 'deemed', 'masterpiece', 'also', 'remake', 'Springtime', 'Small', 'Town', '2002', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch.One', 'warning', 'film', 'quality', 'print', 'poor', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'cutting', 'out', 'key', 'points', 'best', 'knowledge', 'only', 'one', 'print', 'film', 'film', 'out', 'restoration', 'surprising', 'one', 'raised', 'funds', 'do', 'so', 'yet', 'Nonetheless', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'version']",Spring in A Small Town
1039583,A10LNOEX8XSFYQ,B000LP504K,"Concerned About Movies ""KPR""","[2, 2]","I am writing this from the perspective of a Westerner who has no knowledge of the Chinese language and has been to China only once (although rather recently).""Spring in a Small Town"" is, for the most part, subtly acted, written, and directed and is not afraid to use symbolism when appropriate.  Because it uses a limited number of interior sets for most of the story, it gave me the feeling I was watching a stage play that had been expanded for the screen.  Although I found the story to be engaging, I sometimes felt as though I was watching an Ingmar Bergman film (which is not bad).  Indeed, the production owes much more to the influences of European filmmakers than to Hollywood, and there is a sort of Scandivavian languor in the way the story is told and developed.On the negative side, the print is mediocre and the soundtrack, which seems to disappear in a few places, often contains a hum.  The English subtitles, which frequently race by so quickly that they can be only partially read, are often, obviously, incorrectly translated.  (One of many examples of this is when Zhou Yuwen tells her husband to, ""Go back to bed"", when he is already in bed.  I suspect the correct translation should have been, ""Go back to sleep."")  There is no music on the soundtrack until the last minute or two when it suddenly comes out of the blue with a somewhat disconcerting effect.With this said, this is probably the best print that is available for this movie, and if you have any interest in the history of Asian/Chinese film or culture, this is certainly a film to see.  Too bad such films do not have access to the financial resources to be properly restored.  (Where is the George Eastman House when you need them?)As for it being ""The Greatest Chinese Film Ever Made""?  I couldn't tell you since I haven't seen that many Chinese films.

The husband, Dai Liyan is sick all the time and his wife, Zhou Yuwen, spends most of her time taking care of him.  When an old friend of the husband, Zhang Zhichen, shows up it turns he happens to be an old friend of the wife also.  A good friend.  In fact they use to be lovers.  So now the stage is set.  But there is more.  The little sister of the husband kind of has a crush on Zhang Zhichen and Liyan thinks they would make a good marriage.  As things go from bad to worse the simple story becomes more complex as everybody seems to slowly figure out what is happening.  In the end even Liyan feels that his wife and friend would be better off together.  Being made in 1948 it does make you wonder what the message of the movie is.  After all, this is a product of a China recovering from World War Two yet still in the chaos of infighting, right before it became Red China.  Maybe there is no message?The film is only 90 minutes long and is not in the best condition.
