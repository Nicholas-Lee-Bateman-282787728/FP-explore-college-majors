941904,A3FUAGZZ6AF8XM,B000BGQUGQ,Geoffrey Kidd,"[59, 62]","This movie, when I first saw it, was an engaging and enjoyable romp, with good acting, music, and script. Everybody in it was clearly having fun, and Lisa Raines (Foster) was charming and delightful, perfect for the role.  I've been a fan of this film ever since.However, THIS transfer, despite the good picture quality and sound,  wasn't worth getting. There are a number of pieces of the film missing, including a critical-to-the-story bit of narrative by Fanny near the end, which is on my VHS copy.  Even if you haven't seen it before, you can tell the pieces are missing. There are abrupt ""chops"" in some sequences, or the music ends abruptly and the scene jumps.This picture deserved MUCH better treatment.",1,"Good Movie, Bad Transfer to DVD",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,712,"['movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'good', 'acting', 'music', 'script', 'Everybody', 'was', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'Lisa', 'Raines', 'Foster', 'was', 'charming', 'delightful', 'perfect', 'role', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'film', 'ever', 'since.However', 'THIS', 'transfer', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'getting', 'are', 'number', 'pieces', 'film', 'missing', 'including', 'critical-to-the-story', 'bit', 'narrative', 'Fanny', 'end', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'can', 'tell', 'pieces', 'are', 'missing', 'are', 'abrupt', 'chops', 'sequences', 'music', 'abruptly', 'scene', 'jumps.This', 'picture', 'deserved', 'MUCH', 'better', 'treatment']",Fanny Hill

941906,A11SLQAPJILM6O,B000BGQUGQ,"Todd M. Barty ""Fab Fan""","[0, 1]","This rendering of ""Fanny Hill"" opts to avoid some of the more dramatic turns of events and rather pursues a tongue-in-cheek, bawdy, romping approach.Adaptations of books almost always have to change the material in some way, and for a pleasantly ribald novel, this approach seems valid and befitting - you can look elsewhere for more faithful adaptations of the book. Lisa-Foster makes a charming Fanny and the smatterings of full-frontal nudity from her and other young beauties add the right texture and titillation to this story.Shelly Winters and other older actors who play supporting characters play their parts in a suitably flamboyant style. This is delightful, although the picture quality suffers.",4,Pleasant Adaptation,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,707,"['rendering', 'Fanny', 'Hill', 'avoid', 'more', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'events', 'rather', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'bawdy', 'romping', 'approach.Adaptations', 'books', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'change', 'material', 'way', 'pleasantly', 'ribald', 'novel', 'approach', 'valid', 'befitting', 'can', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptations', 'book', 'Lisa-Foster', 'charming', 'Fanny', 'smatterings', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'other', 'young', 'beauties', 'add', 'right', 'texture', 'titillation', 'story.Shelly', 'Winters', 'other', 'older', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'supporting', 'characters', 'play', 'parts', 'suitably', 'flamboyant', 'style', 'delightful', 'picture', 'quality', 'suffers']",Fanny Hill
941907,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000BGQUGQ,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I watched the 2007 adaptation ofFanny Hilla couple of days ago, and though it had some issues in terms of plot, the movie itself was beautifully filmed. In this older version starring Lisa Raines in the title role, I actually enjoyed the dialogue (which is witty and funny), and the over-the-top bedroom antics, but felt the entire production was let down by the poor picture quality. The DVD I watched had extremely poor picture quality - the picture lacked sharpness and clarity, and appeared like it was lifted straight off a VHS with no attempt being made to digitally remaster it. Very disappointing, considering the story itself was entertaining and well-written, not to mention credibly acted to superior comic effect.Having never watched the original release on VHS, I have no idea how much has been edited from this version, though I did sense some choppiness in the plot - perhaps due to bits being cut out of this release. I can't imagine why - certainly, it can't be due to censorship concerns, considering the abundant nudity throughout this movie - bare breasts compete with bare bottoms and much more! Oh well, at least it afforded me an opportunity to watch this older version and compare it to the 2007 adaptation. On the whole, I'd suggest this as a rental until a far superior version is released.",2,"Excellent dialogue - a bawdy and fun romp, but the transfer quality is atrocious!",1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1316,"['watched', '2007', 'adaptation', 'Hilla', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'had', 'issues', 'terms', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'older', 'version', 'starring', 'Lisa', 'Raines', 'title', 'role', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'funny', 'over-the-top', 'bedroom', 'antics', 'felt', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'watched', 'had', 'extremely', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'picture', 'lacked', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'appeared', 'was', 'lifted', 'straight', 'VHS', 'attempt', 'being', 'made', 'digitally', 'remaster', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'story', 'was', 'entertaining', 'well-written', 'not', 'mention', 'credibly', 'acted', 'superior', 'comic', 'effect.Having', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'release', 'VHS', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'edited', 'version', 'did', 'sense', 'choppiness', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'due', 'bits', 'being', 'cut', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'due', 'censorship', 'concerns', 'considering', 'abundant', 'nudity', 'movie', 'bare', 'compete', 'bare', 'bottoms', 'much', 'more', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'afforded', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'older', 'version', 'compare', '2007', 'adaptation', 'whole', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'rental', 'far', 'superior', 'version', 'released']",Fanny Hill
