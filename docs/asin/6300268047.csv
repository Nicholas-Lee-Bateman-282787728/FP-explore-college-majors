231815,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300268047,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Executive Action, 1973 filmThe movie begins with a quote from President Lyndon B. Johnson. He suspected a conspiracy caused the assassination of JFK. They show various industrial scenes as the credits roll. It is June 1963. A voice talks about the Kennedy Brothers and warns about their powers. JFK's actions are criticized. A Test Ban Treaty! Withdrawal from Vietnam! The men talk about an ""executive action"". We see a speech by JFK about progress for the people. They talk about presidential assassinations by fanatics. One man explains how this will work. Practice makes perfect. We hear the analysis of JFK' protection. This conspiracy will use a victim as a ""lone gunman"" to take the blame. We see men shooting at a target in a moving open car.Newsreels from June 1963 tell about a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Jim Farrington meets one leader and explains the deal. ""You just told me who we are going to hit."" JFK speaks about Civil Rights. The conspirators have a ""sponsor"" for their plot. They review his history. They will use him. One plotter speaks about the need for population control of people in other countries. ""Somebody must be behind him."" A speech in Washington is seen by the top man. Oswald is arrested for handing out leaflets, this is photographed [advance planning]. JFK signs the Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. Men with telescopic camera lens take pictures of a parade. We see the plot taking place for Dealey Plaza. The report of a future withdrawal from Vietnam makes Ferguson give the ""go ahead"". They send a coded message to a team leader. They got the job. They use a double to impersonate the ""sponsor"" and leave a false trail. Men break into a garage to steal a rifle. They create an incriminating photograph. [Easier today with digital photography.]Was there a plot to demonstrate against Adlai Stevenson? The assassins reconnoiter the locations. Exact planning assures success. The President and Vice-President will be in Dallas together. ""Oswald has his telephone number?"" Oswald's mail and telephone are monitored by government agencies. [Like most other people?] JFK is greeted in Fort Worth, then flies to Dallas. The people cheer him. The assassins move into their positions. We see actual news photographs mixed in with this movie. [Just like ""Twelve O'Clock High"".] People watch this live on television. The assassins fire. The police search the Texas School Book Depository building. The telephone lines go dead in Washington. [Too many calls at once.] The assassins flee Dallas separately. Oswald asks for legal assistance. On Sunday Jack Ruby goes to the police station. Oswald is shot! ""He was the killer."" There are photographs of the 18 material witnesses who died in the next three years. The odd against this randomly happening are exceedingly high.While an assassination could be the work of a ""lone gunman"" (as `TIME' said about Lincoln's assassination), the killing of Oswald two days later suggests a conspiracy to many people. ""The Assassination Tapes"" book used a voice-stress analyzer to measure the recorded conversations and found that Oswald spoke the truth (or was insane). The removal of JFK resulted in only one change in policy. Executive Order 11,110 was reversed. This ordered the US Treasury to print $100 bills instead of using the more expensive Federal Reserve Notes. The US government has to pay the Fed for its own money!",5,An Explanation of an Assassination,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,3389,"['Executive', 'Action', '1973', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'quote', 'President', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'suspected', 'conspiracy', 'caused', 'assassination', 'JFK', 'show', 'various', 'industrial', 'scenes', 'credits', 'roll', 'June', '1963', 'voice', 'talks', 'Kennedy', 'Brothers', 'warns', 'powers', 'JFK', 'actions', 'are', 'criticized', 'Test', 'Ban', 'Treaty', 'Withdrawal', 'Vietnam', 'men', 'talk', 'executive', 'action', 'see', 'speech', 'JFK', 'progress', 'people', 'talk', 'presidential', 'assassinations', 'fanatics', 'One', 'man', 'how', 'will', 'work', 'Practice', 'perfect', 'hear', 'analysis', 'JFK', 'protection', 'conspiracy', 'will', 'use', 'victim', 'lone', 'gunman', 'take', 'blame', 'see', 'men', 'shooting', 'target', 'moving', 'open', 'car.Newsreels', 'June', '1963', 'tell', 'Nuclear', 'Test', 'Ban', 'Treaty', 'Jim', 'Farrington', 'one', 'leader', 'deal', 'just', 'told', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'hit', 'JFK', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'conspirators', 'have', 'sponsor', 'plot', 'review', 'history', 'will', 'use', 'One', 'plotter', 'need', 'population', 'control', 'people', 'other', 'countries', 'Somebody', 'must', 'be', 'speech', 'Washington', 'seen', 'top', 'man', 'Oswald', 'arrested', 'handing', 'out', 'leaflets', 'photographed', '[', 'advance', 'planning', ']', 'JFK', 'signs', 'Test', 'Ban', 'Treaty', 'August', '1963', 'Men', 'telescopic', 'camera', 'lens', 'take', 'pictures', 'parade', 'see', 'plot', 'taking', 'place', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'report', 'future', 'withdrawal', 'Vietnam', 'Ferguson', 'give', 'go', 'ahead', 'send', 'coded', 'message', 'team', 'leader', 'got', 'job', 'use', 'double', 'impersonate', 'sponsor', 'leave', 'false', 'trail', 'Men', 'break', 'garage', 'steal', 'rifle', 'create', 'incriminating', 'photograph', 'Easier', 'today', 'digital', 'photography', ']', 'Was', 'there', 'plot', 'demonstrate', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'assassins', 'reconnoiter', 'locations', 'Exact', 'planning', 'assures', 'success', 'President', 'Vice-President', 'will', 'be', 'Dallas', 'together', 'Oswald', 'telephone', 'number', 'Oswald', 'mail', 'telephone', 'are', 'monitored', 'government', 'agencies', '[', 'most', 'other', 'people', ']', 'JFK', 'greeted', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'then', 'Dallas', 'people', 'cheer', 'assassins', 'move', 'positions', 'see', 'actual', 'news', 'photographs', 'mixed', 'movie', '[', 'Just', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', ']', 'People', 'watch', 'live', 'television', 'assassins', 'fire', 'police', 'search', 'Texas', 'School', 'Book', 'Depository', 'building', 'telephone', 'lines', 'go', 'dead', 'Washington', '[', 'Too', 'many', 'calls', 'once', ']', 'assassins', 'flee', 'Dallas', 'separately', 'Oswald', 'legal', 'assistance', 'Sunday', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'police', 'station', 'Oswald', 'shot', 'was', 'killer', 'are', 'photographs', '18', 'material', 'witnesses', 'who', 'died', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'odd', 'randomly', 'happening', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'assassination', 'could', 'be', 'work', 'lone', 'gunman', 'TIME', 'said', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'killing', 'Oswald', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'conspiracy', 'many', 'people', 'Assassination', 'Tapes', 'book', 'used', 'voice-stress', 'analyzer', 'measure', 'recorded', 'conversations', 'found', 'Oswald', 'spoke', 'truth', 'was', 'insane', 'removal', 'JFK', 'resulted', 'only', 'one', 'change', 'policy', 'Executive', 'Order', '11,110', 'was', 'reversed', 'ordered', 'US', 'Treasury', 'print', '100', 'bills', 'instead', 'using', 'more', 'expensive', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Notes', 'US', 'government', 'pay', 'Fed', 'own', 'money']",N/A
231816,AHNYRCBNPYS9P,6300268047,AeroEngineer,"[3, 3]","It's certainly plausible, it was no accident that this took place in Texas, LBJ, a Texan, was one of the worst criminals in American history who happened to grow up and be good friends with another great criminal, J. Edgar Hoover and the mayor of Dallas was the brother of one of the top CIA officers fired after the Bay of Pigs. So Kennedy had very powerful enemies.I would direct anyone to ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" which was forced to pull the last 3 episodes after very powerful forces objected, the one you see for sale here does not include the last 3 episodes. The last 3 episodes detail the workings of LBJ and J. Edgar Hoover before the event and after it. It also details, with eyewitnesses the meeting between LBJ and Hoover the night before the assassination as well as LBJ's mistresses recollections of LBJ's comments that the Kennedy's would not bother him anymore before the assassination. It has footage of a secret service agent who started to run alongside the limousine, being called back by a superior officer in a car behind the limousine. As well as Crossfire by Jim Marrs to get a good overall view of what's out there and of course the latest books with the benefit of the 90's committee and the FOIA.I certainly agree that Oswald was completely set up and was an American CIA agent. And I agree that it was a known thing in the underworld that the President was going to be hit, there is just too much independent corroboration to deny it. Not to mention the mess the conspirators made of the autopsy, the Oswald hit and doctored photos and many other things. There's even evidence that the Presidents body was sneaked away and altered before the military supervised autopsy in Washington.So Texas oilmen were probably in on it too, but it would have taken CIA/FBI/Executive level involvement to get so many bases covered and clean it up afterwords with the many many suspicious deaths and the clumsy Warren Commission as well as cutting the telephones in Washington while the event was happening. No Texas oilmen could do all that. Theres just too much independent physical, eyewitness and other evidence to seriously think that there was not a conspiracy and that it did not include the Federal Government.It was LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover, compromised and disgruntled CIA Bay of Pigs veterans that did the work, it precipitated an unholy war, Vietnam and marks a time when the American government was run by criminals starting with LBJ, Nixon and Ford. Watergate was linked to the assassination, I've heard they were looking for a particular document relating to the assassination there.But also the military was in on it as well as someone who could order the Secret Service to stand down and have no runners near the Presidents car as was operating procedure. Evidence of the military being involved was the presence of unknown military personnel at the autopsy that countermanded the doctors authority. This was all in an atmosphere that was paranoid of Communism and many in high places were willing to do anything to combat the Communists both in the USSR, Cuba and Asia.It would have been no problem to retask the CIA teams, that did so much in South America, Europe and other places, to hit a President. Especially one that was so dangerous and hated by the establishment. It's no surprise that the previous President, Eisenhower, warned against the power of the Military-Industrial Complex in his farewell speech. And it's no coincidence that Vietnam was ramped up within 2 years of the event. Vietnam is the first war where helicopters were heavily used, Bell Helicopters.Time-Warner locked the Zapruder film away for years and it was in the possession of federal authorities before it was forcefully released in the 70's due to a FOIA request, you won't see the limousine stop in the Zapruder film as described by several eye-witnesses of the event. The sign that was in Dealy Plaza that had a bullet hole in it was taken down as well as the limousine was stripped and cleaned almost immediately afterwards. Anyone who researches the event, including the scores of eyewitness accounts and physically verifiable evidence, in an honest manner could not think that one man shooting with a 20 year old Italian made rifle could do it alone.It would just be fascinating for someone who knows to come forward just to know how it was done, but I suppose many of us would be robbed of a hobby if that happened. There's probably no one alive or dead who knew all the facets of it anyways and there's not been a President successfully assassinated since so it's academic at this point anyways.There would be no toppling of the government at this point if it came out, just a toppling of the many politicians careers who were either part of the conspiracy or who went along with the coverup afterwards for their own good health, including Arlen Spector, Chris Dodd, Bill Moyers and others. But there was a conspiracy and it did involve the federal government period.",4,Plausible but watch The Men who killed Kennedy Too,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,4989,"['certainly', 'plausible', 'was',

231818,A2G3LQSHOQUITP,6300268047,Athanasius,"[4, 30]","Granted, this movie isn't as bad as Oliver Stone's (which is both imbecilic and psychotic, not to mention unbearably pompous).  Still, ""Executive Action"" is talky, preachy, and pretentious, as well as preposterous and ludicrous.How and why are these aged industrialists expert in all matters pertaining to intelligence, and national and presidential security?  They all deliver the same riddled-with-jargon drivel with a smugness and ersatz world-weariness that has the effect of fingernails on a blackboard.  And yet when the character portrayed by Will Geer expresses a preference for discrediting JFK, rather than assassinating him, he's gently rebuked by the Burt Lancaster villain.  Lancaster makes it clear that they've thoroughly investigated the president's private life and have found it to be as blameless and commendable as that of any non-Renaissance-reigning pope.  Inept and clueless don't even begin to describe the powers-that-be behind this movie.  In 1963, every hep cat and his third cousin twice removed knew that Kennedy had been a sex fiend since crawling out of his crib.  But these businessmen, who apparently know what tie J. Edgar Hoover wore on, say, November 16, 1958, don't know that JFK made Casanova look like a Carmelite monk?In addition, the motivation for murdering the president is weak and implausible.  And none of the conspirators appear even remotely convinced, despite their incessant twaddle.  For example, these men were concerned that Kennedy looked favorably upon the civil rights movement.  And?  That's a reason to kill him?  Then why didn't they also arrange for the murder of LBJ, who was even more in favor of MLK's aspirations?  Heck, if you can kill one president, you can kill another.I have a slew of other objections, including that neither the producers nor the director thought it necessary that the male actors have their hair styled according to the fashion of the year in which the action takes place, rather than the year in which the film was made.  A man wearing 1973 sideburns in 1963 would have been carrying a purse, not a high-powered rifle.I'm not surprised that Commie hack, Dalton Trumbo, wrote the script.  He made a fool of himself in the introductory film.  In fairness, they all did.  It reminded me of when the cast and crew of ""MASH"" used to get together for their love-ins.If I remember correctly, this movie wasn't particularly successful when it came out.  And it's been largely forgotten.  No wonder.  There's never been good reason to believe that John Kennedy was murdered by conspiracy, that anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald was responsible.  All other theories are, in a word, bad.  It's inevitable that so are all the books and movies based on those theories.",1,"Bad Movie, Thy Name is ""Executive Action""",1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2746,"['Granted', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'imbecilic', 'psychotic', 'not', 'mention', 'unbearably', 'pompous', 'Still', 'Executive', 'Action', 'talky', 'preachy', 'pretentious', 'as', 'well', 'preposterous', 'ludicrous.How', 'why', 'are', 'aged', 'industrialists', 'expert', 'matters', 'pertaining', 'intelligence', 'national', 'presidential', 'security', 'deliver', 'same', 'riddled-with-jargon', 'drivel', 'smugness', 'ersatz', 'world-weariness', 'effect', 'fingernails', 'blackboard', 'yet', 'when', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Will', 'Geer', 'preference', 'discrediting', 'JFK', 'rather', 'assassinating', 'gently', 'rebuked', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'villain', 'Lancaster', 'clear', ""'ve"", 'thoroughly', 'investigated', 'president', 'private', 'life', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'blameless', 'commendable', 'non-Renaissance-reigning', 'pope', 'Inept', 'clueless', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'powers-that-be', 'movie', '1963', 'hep', 'cat', 'third', 'cousin', 'twice', 'removed', 'knew', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'been', 'sex', 'fiend', 'crawling', 'crib', 'businessmen', 'who', 'apparently', 'know', 'what', 'tie', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'wore', 'say', 'November', '16', '1958', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'JFK', 'made', 'Casanova', 'look', 'Carmelite', 'monk', 'addition', 'motivation', 'murdering', 'president', 'weak', 'implausible', 'none', 'conspirators', 'appear', 'even', 'remotely', 'convinced', 'incessant', 'twaddle', 'example', 'men', 'were', 'concerned', 'Kennedy', 'looked', 'favorably', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'reason', 'kill', 'Then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'also', 'arrange', 'murder', 'LBJ', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'favor', 'MLK', 'aspirations', 'Heck', 'can', 'kill', 'one', 'president', 'can', 'kill', 'another.I', 'have', 'slew', 'other', 'objections', 'including', 'producers', 'director', 'thought', 'necessary', 'male', 'actors', 'have', 'hair', 'styled', 'according', 'fashion', 'year', 'action', 'place', 'rather', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'man', 'wearing', '1973', 'sideburns', '1963', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'carrying', 'purse', 'not', 'high-powered', 'rifle.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'Commie', 'hack', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'wrote', 'script', 'made', 'fool', 'introductory', 'film', 'fairness', 'did', 'reminded', 'when', 'cast', 'crew', 'MASH', 'used', 'get', 'together', 'love-ins.If', 'remember', 'correctly', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'successful', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'been', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'wonder', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'reason', 'believe', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'murdered', 'conspiracy', 'anyone', 'other', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'was', 'responsible', 'other', 'theories', 'are', 'word', 'bad', 'inevitable', 'so', 'are', 'books', 'movies', 'based', 'theories']",N/A

This is a good solid piece of cinema that does generate a sense of what could be a plausible theory with regard to the assassination, but offers no facts so the gullibility of mankind(especially among the teen set) should be forewarned that, like Stone's masterpiece of cinema, this IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY.  I used to be a believer in a conspiracy in the JFK assassination, but over time with great study and thought(especially after reading False Witness), I have discounted the theories of the crackpots like the late Jim Garrison. There are so many people that act as if it was just impossible for Oswald to have carried out this murder.I don't see what is so hard to believe about the fact that a human zero could have orchestrated this terrible act. Believe me, Oswald without help from Clay Shaw or David Ferrie killed Kennedy. The assassination involved no powerful elite organization(such as the FICTIONAL one presented in EXECUTIVE ACTION) in some type of oligarchy or hierarchy of power structure that carried out the crime of the century.  In conclusion, from a cinematic standpoint this is a good film which will keep the viewer's attention, and it will make you &quot;think&quot;. The American public must be warned, however, that from a factual standpoint, EXECUTIVE ACTION and JFK are fairy tales that reflect a cold war paranoia of the times within the United States....You can go into any public library and check out the 26 volumes of the Warren Report!",3,"Solid film, but JFK is BETTER",982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,1684,"['student', 'lone', 'assassin', 'theory', 'have', 'read', 'Garrison', 'memoirs', 'Marr', 'book', 'Posner', 'Lambert', 'Epstein', 'Lane', 'Rush', 'Judgement', 'watch', 'movies', 'JFK', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'good', 'solid', 'piece', 'cinema', 'generate', 'sense', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'plausible', 'theory', 'regard', 'assassination', 'facts', 'so', 'gullibility', 'mankind', 'especially', 'teen', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'Stone', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'NOT', 'A', 'DOCUMENTARY', 'used', 'be', 'believer', 'conspiracy', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'time', 'great', 'study', 'thought', 'especially', 'reading', 'False', 'Witness', 'have', 'discounted', 'theories', 'crackpots', 'late', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'act', 'was', 'just', 'impossible', 'Oswald', 'have', 'carried', 'out', 'murder.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'fact', 'human', 'zero', 'could', 'have', 'orchestrated', 'terrible', 'act', 'Believe', 'Oswald', 'help', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'killed', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'involved', 'powerful', 'elite', 'organization', 'such', 'FICTIONAL', 'one', 'presented', 'EXECUTIVE', 'ACTION', 'type', 'oligarchy', 'hierarchy', 'power', 'structure', 'carried', 'crime', 'century', 'conclusion', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'will', 'make', 'quot', 'think', 'quot', 'American', 'public', 'must', 'be', 'warned', 'however', 'factual', 'standpoint', 'EXECUTIVE', 'ACTION', 'JFK', 'are', 'fairy', 'tales', 'reflect', 'cold', 'war', 'paranoia', 'times', 'United', 'States', '.You', 'can', 'go', 'public', 'library', 'check', '26', 'volumes', 'Warren', 'Report']",N/A

231822,A19UFCMSFGOZ2K,6300268047,"Charles H. Levenson ""chubbybuns""","[2, 13]","about fifteen or so minutes into this film there is a scene where a group of what are obviously wealthy,conservative conspiritors,led by a cranky Will Geer,question Burt Lancaster about his plan to take out JFK..Geer asks Lancaster if murder is really necessary,and demands to know if""we"",meaning of course,his cabal of right wing plotters,didn't have some dirt on the then-president which would sully his name and bring him down without bloodshed..The lancaster charecter replies with a stright face,that,no,they had tried very hard but they just couldn't come up with anything that would do the trick...From this point on the entire premise of the film becomes suspect,if not downright unbelievable..For ,afterall,JFK,and,in fact,most of his family,had a lot of dirt on thier hands...dirt that was pretty much of an open secret,dirt that if made public then,in 1963,would surely have denied Kennedy re-election..Bedding marylin Monroe for starters..Or bedding Judith Campbell,who also happened to be Sam Giancanna's's squeeze(Sam being a chicago Mafia type)..Beding any number of starlets,showgirls,and suchlike,sometimes two at a time,seems dirt enough to bring down any president(or at least get him into the soup,as evidenced by what happened only recently to Bill Clinton)..So how come,if this plotline is so plausible,none of this was known to the plotters?Surely the sort of men being portrayed,rich,powerful,arrogant extremists(of the sort that even now are running our government)with thier hooks everywhere,who are so able to manage what,if this story is to be believed,was the conspiracy of the century,would know about all of JFK's adulterous affairs?The same sort of extremists portrayed as plotters in this film would have also known about J.Edgar Hoover's massive files containing dirt on everyone,JFK included,and the fact that JFK & Hoover were enemies,and that Hoover was keen to leak his dirt on JFK so as to quash his re-election bid...So this film,like the later,more elaborate,less believable Oliver Stone film,falls into the category of ""Nice try but....""It seems fair to assume that the JFK murder was not the result of any lone nut assassin but,instead,a conspiracy of some sort..JFK had the mafia,Castro,and the right wing elements in this country on his bad side,any one of which alone,or any combination working together,might have wanted JFK dead..He had botched the bay of pigs invasion,thus upsetting the anti-castro cubans and the CIA as well...He was talking about withdrawing from south-east Asia,which perturbed the military industrial complex...the list of those who might have wanted to see JFK laid low is almost endless,so a conspiracy by some,or even all of the above is not out of the question..What IS out of the question is portraying from a JFK-AS-ICON-HERO standpoint,as if all of the brilliant,if nefarious minds arrayed against him could not find anything that would bring him down besides bullets..The film was made on the cheap,has very little action,is long-winded and talky..Sure,it has Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan in it but so what?Ryan was one step away from death ,suffering at the time from terminal cancer,and was starring in just about anything that gave him a paycheck(his last film not being this one but,instead,an Italien western film which also featured Alex Cord),and Lancaster was in-between going from a big star to a secondary player...His ""Elmer Gantry"",""Rainmaker"",""Apache"",""judgement At Nuremburg""days being behind him,and his final real star turn,in""Atlantic City""being still a few years away,so the fact that these two headlined this film is not as big a thing as it might seem...Will Geer,the grandpa on the teevee program""The Waltons"" had been blacklisted in the 1950s,said to have""communist leanings"",so it was not a real stretch to see him supporting a film that suggested that the same right wing elements that had tried to sink his career had also conspired to murder JFK...This film does get one thinking,but it has too many holes and,as subsequent revealations have shown,does not really hold up well under

231828,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6300268047,David Von Pein,"[2, 8]","1973's ""Executive Action"" stars Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan, and Will Geer as three top-level (but never fully-defined or fleshed out) behind-the-scenes plotters who are secretly arranging President John F. Kennedy's demise via a ""One-Patsy, Three-Gunmen"" assassination ambush, which is to take place at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, during President Kennedy's visit to that city on the tragic date of November 22, 1963.Now, where have I seen that type of ""plot"" being proposed before? Oh, yes, Oliver Stone's the man. He's got exactly the same type of crazy three-shooter, ONE-""patsy"" scheme cooked up for his blockbuster motion picture, ""JFK"", which premiered almost two decades after ""Executive Action"".I guess the three assassins who were popping away at JFK's head (as depicted in both ""EA"" and ""JFK"") just prayed that the rotten and corrupt U.S. Government would be wanting to frame the VERY SAME PATSY named Oswald after the bullets stopped flying in Dealey Plaza.Otherwise, I cannot see how on the face of this globe that Mr. Lancaster, et al, could have thought they had a snowball's chance in Hades of their loony THREE-gun plan being successful.Oh, well....I guess we'll just let the Government worry about those trivial little details, like covering up or getting rid of all the bullets and bullet holes in JFK's body that didn't have any chance of being traced back to the one lone ""patsy"" in the Texas School Book Depository Building on Elm Street.About the only redeeming feature in this fairy-tale of a movie is some very nice aerial footage taken of Dealey Plaza and the Book Depository (filmed by Warner Brothers from a helicopter, circa early 1973).The remainder of this conspiracy-oriented film is total fiction, but unlike Oliver Stone's tripe that would surface 18 years later, the producers of ""Executive Action"" were at least honest and forthright enough to tell their audience right from the very beginning of the movie that ""much of this film is fiction"". During the opening credits, we find these words printed on the screen.....""Although much of this film is fiction, much of it is also based on documented historical fact. Did the conspiracy we describe actually exist? We do not know. We merely suggest that it could have existed.""A fatal flaw within the type of script that a film like ""Executive Action"" heavily relies on is that Lee Harvey Oswald (the so-called ""patsy"" in this film as well as in Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" eighteen years later) has been almost completely lost within the sea of unsupportable and invented conspiracy-tinged speculation. At the very least, Oswald has been severely misrepresented in films like ""Executive Action"" and ""JFK"".These type of pro-conspiracy movies about the assassination of America's 35th President rely almost exclusively on fanciful guesswork, conjecture, and a perceived motive that 'so-and-so' supposedly had for wanting President Kennedy killed in 1963.In ""Executive Action"" (which made its debut in U.S. movie theaters on November 7, 1973, fifteen days prior to the 10th anniversary of JFK's death), we're told that the bottom-line motives that these fictional bigshots in the movie had for desperately wanting JFK dead were: Vietnam, Kennedy's civil-rights policies, and JFK's negotiations with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (specifically, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was being frowned upon in a big way by the assassination plotters). God forbid that peace should prevail in the world, huh? &lt;chuckle>But, amid the conspiracy plot being hatched by Lancaster and Company, the PERSONALITY of John F. Kennedy's real killer, Lee Harvey Oswald (and LHO was, indeed, Kennedy's lone assassin based on every scrap of hard evidence to be found when investigating the JFK case), has been pretty much totally lost and/or ignored by the filmmakers.And that's truly a shame. Because if there was ever a person who had the perfect profile and personal make-up of a potential Presidential assassin (a REAL assassin/triggerman, that is, and not just a person to use as a ""patsy""), it was probably 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald.For a balanced counterpoint to movies like ""Executive Action"" and ""JFK"", I'd highly recommend watching the 1964 documentary film""FOUR DAYS IN NOVEMBER"".And I'd also recommend reading two books, Vincent Bugliosi's""RECLAIMING HISTORY""and Jean Davison's""OSWALD'S GAME"", both of which are a mile deep in something called the ""true facts"" surrounding the events of 11/22/63, and both of those books are also richly steeped in the largely-overlooked truth about a man named Lee Harvey Oswald, who was the man that owned the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle that was proven to have killed President Kennedy.==================DVD BONUS FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS:This first-ever DVD release of ""Executive Action"" includes an interesting bonus supplement in the form of a 10-minute ""Vintage Featurette"" entitled ""November 22, 1963: In Search Of An Answer"".That featurette is a pretty good behind-the-scenes type of program, with 1973 interviews with the film's main stars (Lancaster, Ryan, and Geer), plus interview segments with producer Edward Lewis and screenplay writer Dalton Trumbo as well.The Warner Home Video DVD (which came out on October 23, 2007) also includes one additional bonus item, a ""Burt Lancaster Trailer Gallery"", which consists of four theatrical trailers for films starring Mr. Lancaster, including the original trailer for ""Executive Action"" and one for the similarly-themed 1964 movie""Seven Days In May"".This DVD presents ""Executive Action"" in good-looking Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio), with a Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono soundtrack (English only).The film is in color and has a running time of 91 minutes.Subtitles: English; French.Chapters:

We see the famed image of Oswald with his rile being created in a sequence that definitely foreshadows one of the best parts of Stone's film.  There are also similar scenes of Oswald being set up around Dallas as a patsy.  (Stone may have learned what to avoid when studying this picture as well.  His theories about Oswald work better when our frame of reference is an actor in the role. Here we see so much footage of the real Oswald it's easy to buy him as a lone nut.) Unfortunately, much of the rest of this picture is taken up with target practice and about a full third is the main characters watching images of the President on T.V.What's most remarkable though is the completely un-ironic manner in which the right-wing conspirators are played. They could be the local Chamber of Commerce or the leads on a network lawyer show from the 70s. There's nothing menacing about them and they're allowed no pat commentary or agonizing about what they're doing. In fact, when Robert Ryan discusses his racist theories he sounds like he could be amiably plugging a book on Fox News.  (Stone would never withhold judgement like that. Similar characters are portayed as so evil they give even Nixon the creeps in Nixon.)The lone extra is a documentary around the time of the film's making where the filmmakers discuss what they're doing in kind of lofty terms.

231834,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300268047,Erik North,"[25, 28]","The first film to challenge the Warren Commission's ""lone gunman"" theory about the Kennedy assassination, EXECUTIVE ACTION, although overlooked and overshadowed by Oliver Stone's later 1991 epic JFK, is an equally substantive film about how people in high places can destroy a man of peace and help to wreck a nation with their obsessions with war and murder.Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan, and Will Geer portray a cabal of right-wing businessmen clearly concerned about what Kennedy might do with respect to the Cold War and our involvement in Vietnam if he is re-elected in 1964.  The film concerns itself with the assassination teams that these men manage to assemble that will end up being at that appointed place of destiny, Dealey Plaza in Dallas at 12:30 PM Central Time on November 22, 1963.Though much less flashy than Stone's film, EXECUTIVE ACTION, directed by David Miller (LONELY ARE THE BRAVE), and scripted by former blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo from Mark Lane's book ""Rush To Judgement"", has its own style of credibility.  Lancaster and Ryan (the latter in one of his final films), known for their liberal politics, give extremely convincing and low-key portrayals of the right-wing businessmen at the center of this film's conspiracy theory.  Talk about the chilling banality of evil.EXECUTIVE ACTION is not a very easy film to find; and like JFK, it blows holes big enough into the Warren Commission report to drive a truck through and make apologists like Gerald Posner absolutely apoplectic.

And since Vietnam, Watergate, 9-11 and the whole Iraq War issue, conspiracy in itself is not as far-fetched and dismissible as say an Elvis or UFO sighting would be.  Almost a half-century after the event, the JFK assassination and the fact that over 70% of Americans still believe there was a conspiracy in the death of their 35th president, only goes to show you still can't ""fool all of the people, all of the time.""  Whether you believe the official Warren Commission report or not, that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and that the single ""magic"" bullet did all the damage and was found pristine on the hospital stretcher; that the bullet could have only come from the Texas Schoolbook Depository to the rear, when so many witnesses and the infamous Zapruder film shows Kennedy being fatally hit from the front;  that an ex-marine who just so happens to speak fluent Russian, who also monitored the U-2's over Russia and who knew all classified codes and call signs for NORAD, could not only have had the money to purchase such an expensive ticket let alone get an extremely rare and precious visa to fly to the Soviet Union, then renounce his US citizenship and then be allowed to come back to the USA with his new bride -a KGB colonel's daughter and all with the US governments blessing and full co-operation; whether or not you believe a full description of Oswald and his name being issued in an APB by the Dallas Police, less than fifteen minutes after the assassination; then when he is captured, the police kept no transcript or record of  his time in custody; then with so many material witnesses to the assassination suffering fatal accidents, including the death of the two police outriders who were directly behind Kennedy; with Oswald being killed; with Robert Kennedy being killed and so on...  Whether you believe conspiracy one way or another, the 1973 movie Executive Action makes a case for one, or at the very least the possibility for one -and it makes it beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.Unlike Oliver Stone's overfed and over-budgeted JFK movie, director David Miller's and producer Edward Lewis' lean and thrifty Executive Action has over time been proven right in its assumptions and organized conspiracy suggestions.  Now the movie's release came within days of the tenth anniversary of that sad day in Dallas, Texas of November 22nd, 1963 at approximately 12.30 pm central time.  And you could say it was another organized conspiracy to get the movie made at all.  One orchestrated by Lewis and co-producers Dan Bessie and Gary Horowitz, using an effective and a groundbreaking use of combining the Abraham Zapruder film, actual newsreel footage, added sound effects and combining it seamlessly with the suggested re-enactment written by legendary screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.  Now Trumbo was no stranger to government conspiracies, having been blacklisted in the 1950's for refusing to testify and name names before the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).  Surprising, when Trumbo was first approached by his Spartacus friend and producer Edward Lewis, he was skeptical of any hint of a conspiracy or that Oswald could be innocent of the crime.  But after seeing the research and reading the book written by Donald Freed and Mark Lane -Executive Action: Assassination of a Head of State, Trumbo came away believing that certain high officials in the government, intelligence community, organized crime and big business, could come together for a single purpose and change US and world history with the biggest homicide of the twentieth century.Mark Lane, who is also an attorney, public speaker and a human rights advocate, was one of the first to challenge the Warren Commission report and became a pioneer in what has now become an industry in JFK assassination theories. In 1967 he wrote Rush to Judgment and hosted a TV documentary based on his book. The term ""executive action"" -or covertly assassinating a head of state, originated with the CIA in the 1950's.  Remember -years ago, people believed whole heartedly in their government.  It was still an optimistic if not totally naive Frank ""Capraesque"" view that the American people would never consider for a single second that the United States could order the killing of foreign politicians or heads of state, let alone domestic ones.It was actors Donald Sutherland, Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan, all well known Hollywood liberals, that first approached producer Edward Lewis with Freed's and Lane's Executive Action book.  The equally liberal Lewis, was a personal friend of Lancaster having produced The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), Seven Days in May (1964) and The Gypsy Moths (1969) in which the iconic sixty year-old actor had starred in.  But by 1973, Burt Lancaster's career was in decline and he was really starting to show his age.  Still he believed in this project and felt it was an alarming story that needed to be told, especially since the revelations of the on-going Vietnam War and Watergate scandal were so fresh on everyone's minds.  Sutherland didn't get to be in this movie, but he later would be featured in an impressive cameo role in Oliver Stone's JFK (1991).  Lancaster was the sole reason the film was getting made at all and between May and June of 1973, filming took place and at a fast pace in Los Angeles, including out at the home in Pasadena which was well known to fans of TV's Batman where it was Wayne Manor; the even more popular western location Vasquez Rocks just north of Hollywood; downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma doubling for 1963 Dallas and the real assassination site -Dealey Plaza itself.  With a TV budget of just under $1 million, Executive Action under the capable direction of David Miller (Lonely Are the Brave (1962), Captain Newman M.D. (1963)) presented a scenario, a theory that has a Texas arch anti-communist oil millionaire played by real-life liberal and ex-blacklisted actor Will Geer, financing and giving the go-ahead to kill JFK.  Years later, documentary producer Nigel Turner in his highly praised and controversial series The Men Who Killed Kennedy, offers evidence that it could have been Texas oil mogul and wheeler-dealer Clint Murchison, who was the banker.  As is still common today, ex-CIA and FBI agents end up working for industrialists and major corporations as security operatives.  It is widely believed, that it would be so, easy for someone as rich, resourceful and powerful as Murchison, to get the presidential motorcade to make a pointless turn into Dealey Plaza for the sole purpose of trapping the President in a killing field of triangulated fire. Robert Ryan in the last film role of his great career, plays an ex-military/corporate security head who along with his operations chief Burt Lancaster, convinces Geer that if Kennedy is not stopped by ""executive action"", the communists will advance, minorities will rise up and taxes will go up, as is what Kennedy was really going to do to big oil by taking away their beloved Oil Depletion Allowance, thereby costing them millions.Despite the movie's low budget, which saw major stars like Lancaster and Ryan working for scale, Hollywood's casting dean the legendary Lynn Stalmaster and his wife Lea, rounded up a great supporting cast of veteran character actors.  Now if you buy the DVD, you'll be treated to a featurette on the making of the picture shot during its actual production.  Producer Edward Lewis comes right out and said he received death threats over the course of the project.  There was resistance from both Washington and Hollywood. No major studio was interested in either financing or releasing it.Finally, a small distributor called National General Pictures which came about in 1967 and had released such films as Monte Walsh (1970), The Getaway (1972), The Life & Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) and Prime Cut (1972), braved the political and economic climate and took a chance in presenting the first motion picture depiction of an event that many influential and powerful people would sooner see forgotten.Lee Harvey Oswald was to be the ""patsy"" from the very beginning.  The movie heavily suggests Oswald was totally innocent, an ex-marine believed to be working for the CIA, but also known to Naval Intelligence and the FBI as an informant.  Thinking that he was on assignment infiltrating a plot to kill Kennedy, the problem was that the very people he was reporting to were the very ones running it.  He was set-up in the Texas Schoolbook Depository and he was set-up with the use of a double, to be the killer of Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit.  Lancaster contracts for multiple assassin teams to train and do the mission.  Men he has worked with and trusted before in mercenary and ""black-ops"" that furthered the interests of in this case, Geer in foreign lands.  We see them training in the desert, timing their shots and perfecting their accuracy and even using the very inadequate Italian military Mannlicher-Carcano bolt-action rifle that would implicate Oswald.  The planned scenario called for Oswald to be killed as the ""lone nut"" assassin, failing that he was not to live to be tried in court.  Through the co-operation of the Mafia, strip club owner Jack Ruby, was obliged to kill him. The framing of Oswald is well shown, having his head pasted on and airbrushed to the incriminating rifle photo, being filmed on the streets of New Orleans as a Cuban-communist sympathizer and so on.  As you would imagine, the most vivid and attention grabbing aspects of Executive Action is the assassination itself and the inter-cutting between the sniper teams and the Zapruder film footage.  The Warren Commission declared there were only three shots fired, the first injuring Kennedy in his upper back, the second or possibly third shot -the ""magic bullet"" fatally hitting Kennedy exiting his neck and proceeding on into Governor John Connally seated in front.  And there was one shot that missed altogether, hitting the curb and all fired by Oswald in literally just a few seconds. Both documentaries Reasonable Doubt: The Single- Bullet Theory (1988) and the nine-part The Men Who Killed Kennedy series prove the absurdity of the commission's claims.  But of course there are other documentaries that support the single-bullet theory -you'll have to make up your own mind either way.  Needless to say, if you believe the ""single-bullet theory"" you'll totally dismiss Executive Action -just like the public and critics did in November 1973, when it was first released.  However, it was better received in Europe and the rest of the world, who were naturally more responsive to conspiracies in light of just how many there have been proven in world history.  Speaking of which, distributor Nation General Pictures either merely coincidentally or maybe more mysteriously, never released any more movies after Executive Action and years later would be bought by Warner Brothers, around the time that they were coincidentally about to release their version of the assassination -a movie called JFK!The subject of the JFK assassination and conspiracy, even now in 2009, still raises fierce debate and feelings that less than 30% of the American people still refuse to accept or even want to entertain.  Probably the same group that believe Robert Kennedy's assassination was un-related and just the work of another ""lone nut"" and that there really were weapons of mass destruction all along in

231841,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6300268047,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[99, 114]","Executive Action is a stark, low budget docudrama about the assasination of John F. Kennedy.  We watch as a cabal of old, rich white man plot the death of JFK and, in a starkly matter-of-fact way, the film details how they pulled it off.  As opposed to Oliver Stone's later JFK, Executive Action goes to great pains to remain a rather cold recreation.  Though this makes the film far more somber than Stone's, it also makes for a far more persuasive case.  By not sensationalizing or resorting to emotional trickey, Executive Action forces you to consider the evidence for a conspiracy and, even if you're a skeptic like me, by the end of this film, you have to admit that there is a great deal of credible, if circumstancial, evidence to support the idea of a conspiracy.  The conspirators, themselves, are deliberately kept obscure.  We learn little about their backgrounds or individual personalities and, while some might complain that Executive Action doesn't contain any performances as crazed as say Joe Pesci in Stone's film, it actually works to help Executive Action avoid the hysterically paranoid feeling that Stone wallowed in.  Whereas I think JFK ultimately caused more people to dismiss the idea of a conspiracy than accept it, Executive Action is powerfully persuasive.  Every effort has been made to maintain a sense of realism.  As well, Executive Action features the final performance of the great Robert Ryan.  Though, unlike co-star Burt Lancaster, Ryan's become somewhat forgotten today, he was one of the braver movie actors working in the Hollywood of the '40s and '50s.  He was a committed activist who was willing to take chances with his films if he believed in the message.  Its obvious that this was a project that both he and Lancaster felt very deeply about and there's something gratifying in the fact that both of these very missed actors managed to create a message movie that actually manages to persuasively argue for its message.  Lancaster and Ryan were represenatives of a courage that doesn't seem to have survived in today's Hollywood and, whether you agree with them or not, its hard not to respect the body of work they fought so hard to create.I have to admit that I've never been a big believer in conspiracy theories.

First off, I give it an 8.5 out of 10 for simply being the first motion picture to deal with the subject matter (aside from documentaries) long before Oliver Stone wrote his magnum opus. Is it a perfect film...no. The long hair and bushier sideburns on most of the actors betrays the early 70&#8217;s filming dates and I spotted many post 1963 vehicles in at least half the shots where a street scene was filmed, but I can forgive it because of it&#8217;s bold subject matter. The main cast give nice, restrained performances, unlike some of the supporting cast. Some scenes, example when Ruby is talking to one of his strippers in his night club borders on high school drama level acting.What surpassed my expectations was the amount of detail/facts when it came to the post-Warren Commission evidence that has since been put forth and in some cases been proven by ordinary citizens who were not as gullible to believe the Commission&#8217;s 1964 findings. What is amazing are the scenes filmed in Dealy Plaza only 10 years after the real event. Unlike the rapid fire editing in JFK, these scenes give a real sense of the location and how all the areas relate to each other within the plaza.If you love JFK then this film is a must. Yes, it is not on as an epic scale as the 1991 watershed film, but it contains a majority of the now well known contradictions that make the Warren Report, as Cyril H.

231848,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,6300268047,Matthew Kresal,"[10, 10]","Nearly twenty years before Oliver Stone shocked audiences with JFK, Executive Action brought a conspiracy to kill JFK to life. But instead of presenting a stylish and flashy presentation that shows an ever evolving conspiracy as JFK did, Executive Action is a low-budget documentary style presentation that shows not an evolving conspiracy theory, but how such a conspiracy might have happened. The end result might not be a cinematic masterpiece but it is an all-too plausible conspiracy theory.Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan play the men behind the plot. Admittedly this is not the best film of their respective careers, they both give strong performances. Their characters don't have much depth but as the men responsible for plotting the murder of the President, it seems rightly that they aren't overly emotional but rather amoral men with a singular purpose in mind. The only one of the conspirators who shows any real emotion about killing the President is William Greer whose character is the man financing the attempt.  For much of the film he debates whether to kill JFK or not and part of the film's tension is whether he'll do it or not.The star of the film isn't the actors of course. The real star of Executive Action is its script and documentary style of the filming. From the very beginning when we see shooters in the desert practicing the assassination to the framing of Lee Harvey Oswald with a double and altered pictures, to the meetings of the plotters and right down to the assassination and its aftermath the film never loses its documentary style. The filmmakers choose not to be sensational with the material (as Oliver Stone did with JFK) and by showing it ""as it might have happened"" (to quote the film itself) the filmmakers make a good case for a conspiracy in the assassination. The fault of the documentary style is in the large amount of use of documentary footage. This serves to throw the viewer out of the film but constantly shifting from 35mm film to handheld footage of the assassination and motorcade during the assassination sequence and a chilling practice run. But outside of the fault of overusing the documentary footage the style works well.The main fault of the DVD release is a lack of special features. Outside of a making of feature from the time the film was made and trailers from several other films Lancaster was in, there are no special features to speak of. A retrospective documentary or audio commentary would have been nice. But this is a case where the film is the star of the DVD.Executive Action is not a cinematic masterpiece by any means. But it is an intriguing, thought provoking, documentary approach to the conspiracy angle of the JFK assassination. More persuasive then Oliver Stone's JFK, Executive Action is the most realistic fictional depiction of the assassination of JFK made to date.

The title refers to covert organizations euphemism for selected killings. Distinctions are important because EA does not try to prove that a deadly plot existed. EA is ABOUT the conspiracy itself! The pace is slow and chillingly deliberate. The film is totally free of excess and editorial. The conspirators are so calm, the dialog so matter of fact that the viewer could almost be eavesdropping on casual conversation between friends. Their motivation lay in Kennedy s failure to fully support the Bay of Pigs invasion, a nuclear treaty with Russia and his support of Civil Rights. Then there is Topic # 1-J.F.K.s apparent (!) intention to begin withdrawing troops from Vietnam in 1965. Profits decline in peacetime! Two veteran actors, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster are the right wing fanatics who decide to take 'Executive action"" against the President. Both are excellent, especially the cynical Ryan. It is their calm ""everyone is expendable"" iciness that bites to the bone. They have ""Done this Before"". To them there is no difference between eliminating JFK or dispatching a troublesome Third World dictator. These string-pullers calmly put together a hit team as casually as forming a new finance department. There are two significant details: 1) there were not 1 but 3 shooters in Dallas that day and 2) the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald is treated as an unplanned afterthought. A strong point is the intermingling of historical documentary form the early 60s, which gives EA body and context. A weak point is the supporting cast. The supposedly professional assassins look liked they were drafted from the company softball team. The role of strip club owner Jack Ruby would be laughable if he had not been so important in real life. EA is a first rate low key film that failed to win recognition when it was first released.

All the favorites are there - the second and third gunman, the grassy knoll, the Cuban connection, the second Lee Harvey Oswald - although the film's much vaunted research does suffer a rather bad knock when Will Geer's suggestion that they try to discredit Kennedy based on his `personal history' is knocked back by Burt Lancaster's company man telling him that there's no dirt to discredit him with!In many ways David Miller's film is a prototype drama-doc with name actors like Lancaster and Robert Ryan and familiar faces like Ed Lauter and Dick Miller and without the ludicrously epileptic shakeycam that's made the genre look increasingly unrealistic in recent years (real documentary footage rarely shakes THAT much). Instead, it's a solidly crafted and surprisingly involving movie that manages to build up a surprising amount of tension in its last half hour, fitting in rather neatly with Lancaster's other political thrillers like Seven Days in May and Twilight's Last Gleaming. It's not without its flaws - the new footage isn't always seamlessly integrated into newsreel footage of the actual events and the limitations of casting look-alikes are very apparent in Oscar Orcini's terrible performance as Jack Ruby - but it's unexpectedly satisfying.Warners' DVD has a good widescreen transfer with a promo featurette and trailer for the film as well as trailers for Seven Days in May, The Gypsy Moths and Local Hero.",4,How it could have happened... but probably didn't,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,1942,"['Released', 'wake', 'Watergate', 'break-ins', '1973', 'Executive', 'Action', 'one', 'better', 'Kennedy', 'conspiracy', 'movies', 'not', 'especially', 'convincing', 'case', 'tale', 'Kennedy', 'being', 'killed', 'group', 'shadowy', 'neo-cons', 'system', 'rather', 'uncover', 'plot', 'fearless', 'investigator', 'patsy', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'fall', 'surprisingly', 'novel', 'approach', 'seeing', 'entirely', 'eyes', 'conspirators', 'put', 'plan', 'together', 'favorites', 'are', 'there', 'second', 'third', 'gunman', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'Cuban', 'connection', 'second', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'film', 'much', 'vaunted', 'research', 'suffer', 'rather', 'bad', 'knock', 'when', 'Will', 'Geer', 'suggestion', 'try', 'discredit', 'Kennedy', 'based', 'personal', 'history', 'knocked', 'back', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'company', 'man', 'telling', 'dirt', 'discredit', 'many', 'ways', 'David', 'Miller', 'film', 'prototype', 'drama-doc', 'name', 'actors', 'Lancaster', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'familiar', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'ludicrously', 'epileptic', 'shakeycam', 'made', 'genre', 'look', 'increasingly', 'unrealistic', 'recent', 'years', 'real', 'documentary', 'footage', 'rarely', 'much', 'Instead', 'solidly', 'crafted', 'surprisingly', 'involving', 'movie', 'build', 'up', 'surprising', 'amount', 'tension', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'fitting', 'rather', 'neatly', 'Lancaster', 'other', 'political', 'thrillers', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'Twilight', 'Last', 'Gleaming', 'not', 'flaws', 'new', 'footage', ""n't"", 'always', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'actual', 'events', 'limitations', 'casting', 'look-alikes', 'are', 'very', 'apparent', 'Oscar', 'Orcini', 'terrible', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'unexpectedly', 'satisfying.Warners', 'DVD', 'good', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'promo', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'Gypsy', 'Moths', 'Local', 'Hero']",N/A
