I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I had seen Claudia oh so many years ago and wanted to see it again.  I never saw Claudia & David.  I couldn't bring myself to watch it.  I bought Claudia and Claudia & David together and neither one of them have captions for the hearing impaired and even with the sound turned way up I can't make out what they are saying half the time.  Despite the fact that I'm hard of hearing, I find that persons with normal hearing have a hard time with some spots as well.  The sound quality certainly isn't crisp and clear but I give them a pass for this since it is quite old. I have to tell you, that these movies lose their appeal when I'm struggling to figure out what they are saying.  It becomes maddening and I'm disgusted.  Don't release old movies to DVD if you don't intend to put captions on it - I refuse to buy any more without them.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who would appreciate putting some effort into re-releasing these movies to DVD with an appropriate menu and chaptering.",2,Please provide captions for old movies!!!!!!!!,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1091,"['Do', ""n't"", 'release', 'old', 'movies', 'captions', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'Claudia', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'never', 'saw', 'Claudia', 'David', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'watch', 'bought', 'Claudia', 'Claudia', 'David', 'together', 'one', 'have', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'even', 'sound', 'turned', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'time', 'fact', ""'m"", 'hard', 'hearing', 'find', 'persons', 'normal', 'hearing', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'spots', 'well', 'sound', 'quality', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'crisp', 'clear', 'give', 'pass', 'quite', 'old', 'have', 'tell', 'movies', 'lose', 'appeal', 'when', ""'m"", 'struggling', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'maddening', ""'m"", 'disgusted', 'Do', ""n't"", 'release', 'old', 'movies', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'put', 'captions', 'refuse', 'buy', 'more', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'appreciate', 'putting', 'effort', 're-releasing', 'movies', 'DVD', 'appropriate', 'menu', 'chaptering']",N/A
1575433,A1UQBBXIZW9TQP,B008SAPCHA,"R. Hertel ""RKBookman""","[0, 0]","I have been looking for this move for several years. I remembered watching it on TV back in the 60s. I sort of knew the story line and thought it might be Robert Young, but could not find it. It was much as I remember it and it would get 5 stars if it were still 1960. However, the world has moved on and a very young nave wife who must be guided by her husband is very dated. (Not to mention that today there is probably not an American girl over twelve as unsophisticated as Claudia.) The picture won awards when it was new and the acting is great. Watch it if you want to see a picture of what societal mores were like about 75 year ago. (For a woman, it makes you appreciate how far we have come!)",4,I found it at last!,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,701,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'move', 'several', 'years', 'remembered', 'watching', 'TV', 'back', '60s', 'sort', 'knew', 'story', 'line', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'Robert', 'Young', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'was', 'much', 'remember', 'would', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'still', '1960', 'However', 'world', 'moved', 'very', 'young', 'nave', 'wife', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'guided', 'husband', 'very', 'dated', 'Not', 'mention', 'today', 'probably', 'not', 'American', 'girl', 'over', 'twelve', 'as', 'unsophisticated', 'Claudia', 'picture', 'won', 'awards', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'acting', 'great', 'Watch', 'want', 'see', 'picture', 'what', 'societal', 'mores', 'were', '75', 'year', 'ago', 'woman', 'appreciate', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come']",N/A

This story continues as the young married couple deal with life's unexpected, but necessary, facts-of-life.  Since ""Claudia"" had made a full-fledged star of Dorothy McGuire (who created the role on Broadway) Fox provided a follow-up to the story.  The acting and print are good whereas the print of ""Claudia"" is ragged and aged.  Where is the quality control and respect for the Fox library?  Neither has been available before and will be welcomed by movie fans.  Dorothy McGuire is lovely and went on to star in such classics as ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", ""The Enchanted Cottage, ""The Spiral Staircase"",""Three Coins in the Fountain"" and many others.",3,"Claudia and David Continues Where ""Claudia"" Left Off",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,758,"['Claudia', 'David', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Robert', 'Young', 'co-stars', 'previous', 'hit', 'Claudia', 'story', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'deal', 'life', 'unexpected', 'necessary', 'facts-of-life', 'Claudia', 'had', 'made', 'full-fledged', 'star', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'who', 'created', 'role', 'Broadway', 'Fox', 'provided', 'follow-up', 'story', 'acting', 'print', 'are', 'good', 'print', 'Claudia', 'ragged', 'aged', 'Where', 'quality', 'control', 'respect', 'Fox', 'library', 'been', 'available', 'before', 'will', 'be', 'welcomed', 'movie', 'fans', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'lovely', 'went', 'star', 'such', 'classics', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'Enchanted', 'Cottage', 'Spiral', 'Staircase', 'Three', 'Coins', 'Fountain', 'many', 'others']",N/A
1575435,ACM90BRKX73OG,B008SAPCHA,Tom,"[1, 1]","Claudia and David (1946) was directed by Walter Lang for Twentieth Century Fox and features 29-year-old Dorothy McGuire.In this sequel to the popular Claudia (1943), we find architect David Naughton (Robert Young) and his lovely but somewhat scatterbrained wife, Claudia (McGuire), living on the same Connecticut farm with their live-in servants, Bertha and Fritz, but now they also have a three-year-old son, Bobby. When David contemplates a trip to Los Angeles for a professional convention Claudia fears for his safety. At a dinner party, a parlour room seance confirms her misgivings. Jealousy soon enters into the marriage as both David and Claudia strike up friendships with acquaintances from the party but when David is later injured in an automobile accident the two reconfirm their love for each other. The lesson for the audience, in David's words, is a couple must work at their marriage if it is to survive. As the film ends Claudia and David look forward to their trip together to Los Angeles.Claudia is still the same illogical, impetuous woman we saw in the first film who could not let go of her dying mother. But now she clings tightly to her child to the annoyance of David. It's interesting to watch how this 1940's upper middle-class, genteel couple relates to parenting. David can hardly be bothered with the boy and faults Claudia for being a doting mother as the child lies in his sickbed with measles. My, views on parenthood certainly have changed.Claudia and David is a weak follow-up to the original film with no compelling storyline this time around. However, Robert Young gives another smart performance as the eye-rolling, head-shaking, patient husband while Dorothy McGuire is fabulous once again as the spontaneous woman-child. Ms. McGuire was an excellent, underappreciated actress with a lovely soft voice and a natural beauty that defied Hollywood glamour stereotypes. As just one example, the whimsical scene where Claudia prepares for the dinner party (7:38-9:40) is a joy to watch. John Sutton gives a good performance as the long-suffering married acquaintance who takes a shine to Claudia. Who could blame him?Like the first Claudia installment this DVD-R is also too dark but I'm very glad to have this rare film on DVD.",3,Sequel not quite as strong as original,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,2262,"['Claudia', 'David', '1946', 'was', 'directed', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', '29-year-old', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire.In', 'sequel', 'popular', 'Claudia', '1943', 'find', 'architect', 'David', 'Naughton', 'Robert', 'Young', 'lovely', 'somewhat', 'scatterbrained', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'McGuire', 'living', 'same', 'Connecticut', 'farm', 'live-in', 'servants', 'Bertha', 'Fritz', 'now', 'also', 'have', 'three-year-old', 'son', 'Bobby', 'When', 'David', 'trip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'professional', 'convention', 'Claudia', 'safety', 'dinner', 'party', 'parlour', 'room', 'seance', 'misgivings', 'Jealousy', 'soon', 'marriage', 'David', 'Claudia', 'strike', 'up', 'friendships', 'acquaintances', 'party', 'when', 'David', 'later', 'injured', 'automobile', 'accident', 'two', 'reconfirm', 'love', 'other', 'lesson', 'audience', 'David', 'words', 'couple', 'must', 'work', 'marriage', 'survive', 'film', 'Claudia', 'David', 'look', 'forward', 'trip', 'together', 'Los', 'Angeles.Claudia', 'still', 'same', 'illogical', 'impetuous', 'woman', 'saw', 'first', 'film', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'dying', 'mother', 'now', 'tightly', 'child', 'annoyance', 'David', 'interesting', 'watch', 'how', '1940', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'genteel', 'couple', 'parenting', 'David', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'bothered', 'boy', 'faults', 'Claudia', 'being', 'doting', 'mother', 'child', 'sickbed', 'measles', 'My', 'views', 'parenthood', 'certainly', 'have', 'changed.Claudia', 'David', 'weak', 'follow-up', 'original', 'film', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'time', 'around', 'However', 'Robert', 'Young', 'smart', 'performance', 'eye-rolling', 'head-shaking', 'patient', 'husband', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'fabulous', 'once', 'again', 'spontaneous', 'woman-child', 'Ms.', 'McGuire', 'was', 'excellent', 'underappreciated', 'actress', 'lovely', 'soft', 'voice', 'natural', 'beauty', 'defied', 'Hollywood', 'glamour', 'stereotypes', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'whimsical', 'scene', 'where', 'Claudia', 'dinner', 'party', '7:38-9:40', 'joy', 'watch', 'John', 'Sutton', 'good', 'performance', 'long-suffering', 'married', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'shine', 'Claudia', 'Who', 'could', 'blame', 'first', 'Claudia', 'installment', 'DVD-R', 'also', 'too', 'dark', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'rare', 'film', 'DVD']",N/A
