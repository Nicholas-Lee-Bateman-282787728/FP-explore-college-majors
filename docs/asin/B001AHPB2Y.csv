You get to see the few parts of our world that are still fairly untouched and pristine, and perhaps ask yourself how you would survive.I particularly enjoyed the behind the scenes portion of the DVD, because it showed how Les did his homework on every location, meeting with locals, studying with experts in the field, and getting everything in order for the big week on his own.Highly recommended!",5,Great show,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,548,"['Survivorman', 'interesting', 'show', 'viewer', 'step', 'out', 'his/her', 'normal', 'civilized', 'life', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Les', 'Stroud', 'get', 'see', 'few', 'parts', 'world', 'are', 'still', 'fairly', 'untouched', 'pristine', 'perhaps', 'ask', 'how', 'would', 'survive.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'portion', 'DVD', 'showed', 'how', 'Les', 'did', 'homework', 'location', 'meeting', 'locals', 'studying', 'experts', 'field', 'getting', 'everything', 'order', 'big', 'week', 'own.Highly', 'recommended']",Survivorman: Season 2

He goes into the wilderness, alone and with no camera crew, for seven days to film himself in a real survival situation. The information and survival skills that he shows is accurate, and entertaining. This is not a boring show where he just talks about what to do, he demonstrates it in a very entertaining fashion. Unlike ""Man VS Wild"", Les is real. He does not fake his show or give wrong information. I highly recomend this show to anyone who is trying to learn survival information.

He doesn't take stupid risks and treats everything as if it is real, because it is.Survivorman is a very entertaining show with Les providing the voice over filling in the blank areas he may leave out when his is in the ""woods"" because he is too busy surviving.  It is funny watching him get mad at his camera equipment or breaking out his harmonica and jam.When killing an animal Les explains that this should only be done when survival is at stake. He shows a respect for dangers of the wilderness that everyone should have.  In this season we actually see Les on the run from some of these dangers.Season 2 shows exotic locations and a sense of maturity that comes from having done this a few time before.

He has his ever present multitool, maybe a knife or axe, possibly a firestarter, and aside from the appropriate clothing, very little other survival gear.He shows himself sometimes failing to secure food or water.
