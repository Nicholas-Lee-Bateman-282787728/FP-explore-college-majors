I especially like how they show the value of each item and how they show how much each person will make when they sell the items at current market prices. I also like when they find those rare items worth a lot of money in the bins. Very interesting and unique show that will keep you guessing all the way to the end.,5,Storage Wars Volume 3,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,393,"['love', 'watching', 'people', 'find', 'great', 'stuff', 'get', 'good', 'deals', 'common', 'items', 'especially', 'how', 'show', 'value', 'item', 'how', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'person', 'will', 'make', 'when', 'sell', 'items', 'current', 'market', 'prices', 'also', 'like', 'when', 'find', 'rare', 'items', 'lot', 'money', 'bins', 'Very', 'interesting', 'unique', 'show', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'way', 'end']","Storage Wars, Vol. 3"

1531163,A1NDOQNA06X8N8,B007I1Q53U,"Kevin Graham ""Kevin""","[1, 2]",great show.  It has very likeable characters and they are just average people.  It has a bidding part and then an appraisal part.  A reality show for people who don't like reality shows.Sort of like treasure hunting for people that own their own small business or just know a lot of different people they can unload speciality items too.  And also know a lot of people to get specialty items appraisedIt has the last 16 episodes of season 2.Kevin,5,great show,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,446,"['great', 'show', 'very', 'likeable', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'average', 'people', 'bidding', 'part', 'then', 'appraisal', 'part', 'reality', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reality', 'shows.Sort', 'like', 'treasure', 'hunting', 'people', 'own', 'own', 'small', 'business', 'just', 'know', 'lot', 'different', 'people', 'can', 'unload', 'speciality', 'items', 'too', 'also', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'get', 'specialty', 'items', 'last', '16', 'episodes', 'season', '2.Kevin']","Storage Wars, Vol. 3"
1531164,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007I1Q53U,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 20]","Admittedly, I was extremely critical when A&E; switched marketing tactics midstream in its releasing of Storage Wars.  The first season was released in a full DVD set.  But the next release was branded Volume Two and only consisted of the first fourteen episodes of the second season.  In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then confuse unsuspecting buyers by changing things up.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!While Volume Two of Storage Wars disappointed with rule number two, its most egregious error was also disregarding rule number three.  Nowhere, in any of the marketing or on the DVD case, did it tell you how many episodes (and which ones) you were receiving.  It looks like they've learned from their mistakes, however, and the DVD release Volume Three does list exactly what is included.This presents the next sixteen chronological episodes from Season Two over 2 discs for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  At a lower suggested price point, it is essentially half a season for half the price.  In a strange decision, though, it does NOT include the final three episodes from Season Two which, I presume, will begin the next Volume.Here's what you get:(1) I'm The New Mogul, (2) Driving Miss Barry, (3) Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, (4) Auction Sesame, (5) Stairway To Hemet, (6) Scoot-A-Toot, Toot, (7) The Empire Strikes Out, (8) Make It Rain, Girl, (9) Smoke 'Em If You Find 'Em, (10) The Drone Wars, (11) Brandi's First Time, (12) Hooray For Holly-Weird, (13) Don't Bid So Close To Me, (14) Not Your Average Bear, (15) Hook, Line, And Sucker, and (16) Operation Hobo.In short, if you're shopping Volume Three of Storage Wars--you are well aware of the show's premise.  Just wanted to include its content listings for potential costumers.
