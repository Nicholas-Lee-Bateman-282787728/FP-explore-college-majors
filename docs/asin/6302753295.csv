331549,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302753295,Acute Observer,"[1, 12]","McLintock!, 1963 filmThe story begins on a cattle ranch in the west. Hereford cattle will be herded and shipped to Kansas City (then shipped to Chicago for processing). George Washington McClintock is the big landowner in this area. He doesn't want homesteaders settling in the Mesa Verde (""green table""). He owns the water rights (and has other powers). McClintock advises the homesteaders that land above 6,000 feet in altitude is not good for farming because of varying rainfall. (Was that true?) Later he goes into town and reads a letter. This hotel has women in the lobby, as if they are waiting for customers. He visits his wife Kate in a hotel room (she wants a divorce). ""I hate you."" Outside a man asks for a job, then takes a punch at McClintock. Friendly Indians visit the encampment. McClintock hires a new cook. [Would a cattle baron own a big brick mansion in a remote region?] Kate returns to the house. There is interaction and conversation among the people there.McClintock goes in to town, visits the saloon, then plays chess. Kate visits him for a talk. ""Ha, ha ha."" Two men complain about the presence of Indians. There is trouble in town. McClintock gets involved. ""The hell I won't."" The men provide entertainment for the watching people. Some slide in the mud. This strange ritual amuses the Indians and the viewers. How to wash off that mud? The next day daughter Rebecca arrives on the train. Also on the train are the released Indians. The chief has been educated in jail (like other surviving freedom fighters). Rebecca brought a friend and his parents too. There is drama in Rebecca's talk with Devlin Warren. There is a barbecue in celebration, and dancing. Matt Douglas Jr. shows a new dance from New York. Devlin shows the skill he learned at college. So does his uncle.Rebecca seeks advice from her Dad about the status of her parents' marriage; he gives some. McClintock plans to leave most of his land for a national park. He wants his daughter to experience early pioneer days. [Believable in 1895, the worst depression of the 19th century?] There is a song for entertainment. Does everybody work for everybody else? The drive results in trouble. A good spanking? More trouble? There is a court case the next day. Territorial Governor Cuthbert Humphrey presides. McClintock speaks for the Comanches against their removal to Fort Sill. [Were the Comanches a danger in 1895?] The times are changing. Does McClintock have a plan?McClintock arrives home with a load on. What was he doing? He complains about the Governor, as if all a politician thinks of is money. [Don't forget the votes!] ""What's going on here?"" Is there a problem with those stairs? The people are free to celebrate July Fourth with a rodeo. Children set off fireworks. [A lost freedom?] There is a horse race. The Governor gets splattered. The door to a boxcar opens, a long wooden box falls out. There is an explosion, the Comanches ride again. A bugle announces the arrival of the Cavalry. Plenty of excitement. ""Where did they get the guns?"" But the celebration goes on. Kate is chased by McClintock for comic effect. [Are these scenes still funny today?]This movie seems to contain scenes from many previous John Wayne films, such as ""The Quiet Man"". It probably was not very successful then. It is too comic for a drama, and the story isn't that great.

331555,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,6302753295,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[9, 11]","I was absolutely ecstatic to finally get a copy of McLINTOCK in a collector's edition and in fully restored, widescreen format.  This is a movie that just cannot be appropriately viewed in full screen. Be sure to get this authorized version as previous DVD versions suffered in presentation format and quality.And McLINTOCK is a John Wayne classic, one that absolutely belongs in any comprehensive Western collection.  Some of Wayne's greatest lines and scenes are here.  But, hey, why limit it to Wayne?  McLINTOCK has arguably some of the best Western moments to be found anywhere in the genre.The movie is hailed as a comedy but don't get the wrong impression.  No, this isn't BLAZING SADDLES or RUSTLER'S RHAPSODY.  There are lighter moments, yes, like the clay slide fight and Maureen O'Hara's romp down main street in nothing but her bloomers.  But then there is also John Wayne's touching scene with Stephanie Powers, who plays his daughter Becky, when he explains to her his take on life.  There's also the scene where Wayne speaks for a group of captured and imprisoned Comanche chiefs.  His words are as applicable today as they were when the movie was made or, more to the point, in the context of period in which this movie is set.And a classic Western deserves nothing short of a classic cast. In that regard McLINTOCK comes through in spades.  In addition to Wayne as the irrepressible George Washington McLintock, Maureen O'Hara is perfect as Kathryn McLintock, McLintock's estranged wife.  Stephanie Powers is wonderful as McLintock's daughter Becky while Wayne's real-life son, Patrick, stars as Powers' love interest, Devlin Warren. Add to that group Hank Worden, Chill Wills, and Yvonne DeCarlo and your in for Western entertainment at its finest.The only drawback with this DVD (and certainly not sufficient to tarnish the film itself or my rating of 5 stars) was a Special Features interview with Maureen O'Hara.  I was totally shocked at the arrogance displayed by Ms. O'Hara in discussing her abilities as an actress.  While she remains Wayne's very finest leading lady, I was stunned at her lack of class in the interviews.THE HORSEMAN",5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST IN ANY SERIOUS WESTERN COLLECTION,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2159,"['was', 'absolutely', 'ecstatic', 'finally', 'get', 'copy', 'McLINTOCK', 'collector', 'edition', 'fully', 'restored', 'widescreen', 'format', 'movie', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'appropriately', 'viewed', 'full', 'screen', 'Be', 'sure', 'get', 'authorized', 'version', 'previous', 'DVD', 'versions', 'suffered', 'presentation', 'format', 'quality.And', 'McLINTOCK', 'John', 'Wayne', 'classic', 'one', 'absolutely', 'comprehensive', 'Western', 'collection', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'lines', 'scenes', 'are', 'here', 'hey', 'why', 'limit', 'Wayne', 'McLINTOCK', 'arguably', 'best', 'Western', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'genre.The', 'movie', 'hailed', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'impression', 'No', ""n't"", 'BLAZING', 'SADDLES', 'RUSTLER', 'RHAPSODY', 'are', 'lighter', 'moments', 'yes', 'clay', 'slide', 'fight', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'romp', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'nothing', 'bloomers', 'then', 'also', 'John', 'Wayne', 'touching', 'scene', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'who', 'daughter', 'Becky', 'when', 'take', 'life', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'Wayne', 'group', 'captured', 'imprisoned', 'Comanche', 'chiefs', 'words', 'are', 'applicable', 'today', 'were', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'point', 'context', 'period', 'movie', 'classic', 'Western', 'deserves', 'nothing', 'short', 'classic', 'cast', 'regard', 'McLINTOCK', 'spades', 'addition', 'Wayne', 'irrepressible', 'George', 'Washington', 'McLintock', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'perfect', 'Kathryn', 'McLintock', 'McLintock', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'wonderful', 'McLintock', 'daughter', 'Becky', 'Wayne', 'real-life', 'son', 'Patrick', 'Powers', 'love', 'interest', 'Devlin', 'Warren', 'Add', 'group', 'Hank', 'Worden', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'Western', 'entertainment', 'finest.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'not', 'sufficient', 'tarnish', 'film', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'Special', 'Features', 'interview', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'was', 'totally', 'shocked', 'arrogance', 'displayed', 'Ms.', ""O'Hara"", 'discussing', 'abilities', 'actress', 'Wayne', 'very', 'finest', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'stunned', 'lack', 'class', 'interviews.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",N/A

331560,A13H2JJ3GEMJN1,6302753295,"AntiochAndy ""antiochandy""","[1, 2]","McLintock is a romantic comedy first, a western second. As a romantic comedy in an old west setting, it works quite well. This is John Wayne at his best, in my opinion. I haven't seen many of the &quot;serious&quot; westerns he made in his younger days, but I did see &quot;True Grit&quot; (the movie they gave him an oscar for). I thought it was awful. Of course, that wasn't necessarily Wayne's fault, but he looked as though it was all he could do to keep from bursting with laughter throughout most of it.  Like a number of other macho actors (Burt Reynolds, for example), Wayne has a certain dry wit that comes across well. Here he is paired with Maureen O'Hara, and they make a good team. There are also lots of other familiar faces in this (Chill Wills, Stephanie Powers, Yvonne deCarlo, Jerry VanDyke, and more) who contribute solid performances.McLintock isn't a great movie.

Stephanie's character's affection for her father is also genuine. There is a lot of passion in this movie.  I liked how John Wayne supported the Native Americans.

331565,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302753295,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara worked together on several movies. This was probably the funniest one. It's loosely (very loosely) based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" by Shakespeare. But it's primarily Wayne's response to the ""women's movement"" that was just getting started in 1963.George Washington (G.W.) McLintock (John Wayne) is a cattle baron who owns a good portion of the town named after him, as well as a huge cattle ranch and a beautiful Victorian mansion. He and his wife Katherine (Maureen O'Hara), whom G.W. calls Katie, have been separated for two years. But she returns to town because their daughter Becky (Stefanie Powers) is coming home from school back east and her mother is determined to take her with her to New York, and to Europe, and prevent her from becoming a crude westerner.Katie, you see, is a terrible snob. G.W. is just as determinedly not snobbish. He is friends with the local Comanches, and is in fact asked to speak for them when there is a hearing -- kangaroo court, really -- held by the territorial governor in response to a fussy little bureaucrat of an Indian agent who reported to Washington that they were defying him about being moved to a fort somewhere else, location unspecified. In fact, nobody ever said what territory we were in throughout the movie.One of the best scenes is when G.W. has been up all night playing chess with Birnbaum, the storekeeper when word comes that the settlers (a band that has been offered 160 acres of unfarmable land per family) are going to hang an Indian. It seems one of the settler's daughters is missing, and it is assumed the Comanches have kidnapped her. In fact, while the chief (G.W.'s friend) is standing on the scaffold, the daughter and her boyfriend ride up on a horse and explain that he had taken her for a morning ride and ""the horse ran away."" But her father had already made an ass of himself poking a sawed-off shotgun in G.W.'s belly and bullying him about his protesting the chief being hanged. Then G.W. wrenches the shotgun out of the jerk's hands and starts poking him in the belly.Did I mention that all this was taking place on a hill which was part of a mining operation, and there was a muddy slope and a pool of slurry at the bottom? Well, once G.W. takes a good hard swing at the indignant father and he slides down the muddy slope into the slop, the fight is on. The chief walks through the melee saying, ""Good party, Maclin. Where's the whiskey? Eventually, G.W. and Kate and Birnbaum and just about everyone else ends up in the slurry pit, and comes home covered in caked silt.There's really too much to tell in this story. The handsome young farmer (Patrick Wayne) McLintock hires who falls in love with his daughter. The farmer's mother (Yvonne de Carlo), who takes a job cooking for them and falls in love with the sheriff. The silly college boy (Jerry Van Dyke) who makes a total fool of himself trying to win McLintock's daughter, and on and on. It's a romp, but if you don't find men spanking the women they love amusing, don't watch it.",3,John Wayne's Westernized Taming of the Shrew,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3053,"['John', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'worked', 'together', 'several', 'movies', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'one', 'loosely', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Shakespeare', 'primarily', 'Wayne', 'response', 'women', 'movement', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'started', '1963.George', 'Washington', 'G.W', 'McLintock', 'John', 'Wayne', 'cattle', 'baron', 'who', 'good', 'portion', 'town', 'named', 'as', 'well', 'huge', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'beautiful', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'whom', 'G.W', 'Katie', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'two', 'years', 'town', 'daughter', 'Becky', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'coming', 'home', 'school', 'back', 'east', 'mother', 'determined', 'take', 'New', 'York', 'Europe', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'crude', 'westerner.Katie', 'see', 'terrible', 'snob', 'G.W', 'just', 'as', 'determinedly', 'not', 'snobbish', 'friends', 'local', 'Comanches', 'fact', 'asked', 'speak', 'when', 'hearing', 'kangaroo', 'court', 'really', 'held', 'territorial', 'governor', 'response', 'fussy', 'little', 'bureaucrat', 'Indian', 'agent', 'who', 'reported', 'Washington', 'were', 'defying', 'being', 'moved', 'fort', 'somewhere', 'else', 'location', 'unspecified', 'fact', 'nobody', 'ever', 'said', 'what', 'territory', 'were', 'movie.One', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'G.W', 'been', 'up', 'night', 'playing', 'chess', 'Birnbaum', 'storekeeper', 'when', 'word', 'settlers', 'band', 'been', 'offered', '160', 'acres', 'unfarmable', 'land', 'family', 'are', 'going', 'hang', 'Indian', 'one', 'settler', 'daughters', 'missing', 'assumed', 'Comanches', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'fact', 'chief', 'G.W', 'friend', 'standing', 'scaffold', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'ride', 'up', 'horse', 'explain', 'had', 'taken', 'morning', 'ride', 'horse', 'ran', 'away', 'father', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'ass', 'poking', 'sawed-off', 'shotgun', 'G.W', 'belly', 'bullying', 'protesting', 'chief', 'being', 'hanged', 'Then', 'G.W', 'shotgun', 'jerk', 'hands', 'starts', 'poking', 'belly.Did', 'mention', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'hill', 'was', 'part', 'mining', 'operation', 'there', 'was', 'muddy', 'slope', 'pool', 'slurry', 'bottom', 'Well', 'once', 'G.W', 'good', 'hard', 'swing', 'indignant', 'father', 'down', 'muddy', 'slope', 'slop', 'fight', 'chief', 'walks', 'melee', 'saying', 'Good', 'party', 'Maclin', 'Where', 'whiskey', 'Eventually', 'G.W', 'Kate', 'Birnbaum', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'up', 'slurry', 'pit', 'home', 'covered', 'caked', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'handsome', 'young', 'farmer', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'McLintock', 'hires', 'who', 'falls', 'love', 'daughter', 'farmer', 'mother', 'Yvonne', 'de', 'Carlo', 'who', 'job', 'cooking', 'love', 'sheriff', 'silly', 'college', 'boy', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'who', 'total', 'fool', 'trying', 'win', 'McLintock', 'daughter', 'romp', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'men', 'spanking', 'women', 'love', 'amusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch']",N/A

G. W. (for George Washington) McLintock is a wealthy New Mexico cattle baron who has watched the West won (and played a big part in that winning), and now, sinking into comfortable middle age, he suddenly finds his life disrupted by the return of his estranged wife Kate (whose reasons for leaving him he has never really known), their daughter Rebecca's completion of her schooling (Kate's chief purpose in coming back to the Territory at all is to convince him to allow the girl to return East with her and spend her time in a round of New York, Europe, and &quot;Newport in the season&quot;), the machinations of pompous Territorial Governor Cuthbert Humphreys, and the attraction of his new hand, Dev Warren (Wayne's son Patrick), for Becky.  He must also find a way to help his old enemies, the Comanche chiefs recently released from prison, bring their people's plight to the attention of Washington (Humphreys would rather keep it at home), and cope with an influx of homesteaders hoping to farm a nearby mesa which, he maintains, &quot;God made...for buffalo!&quot;  These complex story threads play out with wondrous clarity, helped along by a sterling cast, among the best of whom are Jack Kruschen as McLintock's longtime friend and chess partner, storekeeper Jake Birnbaum; the delightful Chill Wills as his majordomo and equally longtime right-hand man Drago; Edgar Buchanan as local derelict Bunny Dull; Michael Pate as Chief Puma; Chuck Roberson as the somewhat put-upon Sheriff Jeff Lord (who has eyes for Dev's widowed mother); Bruce Cabot (a long-time member of Wayne's &quot;stock company&quot;) as neighboring rancher Ben Sage, and Edward Faulkner (another) as his son; and Leo Gordon as homesteader Jones.  There's a wild slapstick brawl in a clay pit that follows upon McLintock's attempt to prevent the lynching of an Indian, and a comic chase through the holiday crowds as G. W. and Kate finally play out their quarrel.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 2]","No, you could never get away with making a film like MCCLINTOCK! during these politically correct times--a Western version of Shakespeare's timeless 'The Taming of the Shrew' complete with its female lead character being publicly humiliated (meaning she gets spanked).  NOW would never let something like that happen these days, even when presented in good clean fun and with tongue firmly in cheek, which is what lends such rustic charm to this John Wayne classic.Wayne plays G.W. McClintock, a rancher/entrepreneur who, after years of hardship building his cattle empire, is now living the high life.  The beautiful Maureen O'Hara plays Mrs. McClintock who, now that she's been exposed to eastern culture and living, finds her husband crude, obnoxious, and boorish--yet still loves him.  The chemistry between the two (as it is in all their films together) comes as easy as breathing air; in fact, Wayne wears this role like an old glove:  in every scene he is exceedingly comfortable.  The two of them are pure fun to watch.But what is more enjoyable about MCCLINTOCK! is its plethora of other speaking roles, all of them done well.  Some of my favorites include Chill Wills, Jack Kruschen, Patrick Wayne, Stefanie Powers, Strother Martin, Jerry Van Dyke, Yvonne De Carlo, and Big John Hamilton (as you can tell, this film contains lots of characters).  MCCLINTOCK! is a sprawling, feel-good Western that is definitely one of The Duke's best--even though its misogynist bent might offend those who are a little sensitive.--D.

Edwards,"[22, 23]","Please do not confuse consumer complaints, and their one star reviews, about the quality of the DVD (which definitely does not apply to this DVD version), with the quality of the movie.  ""McLintock"" is one of John Wayne's best movies, combining comedy--for which Wayne was not well recognized--and western genres.  ""McLintock"" was the second John Wayne movie (""Stagecoach,"" his finest, being the first) I showed my three sons as I introduced each of them to the wonder of the greatest film star of all time.  While I feel that ""Quite Man,"" also with Maureen O'Hara, is the film Wayne should have won the Oscar for Best Actor, and rivals and parallels ""McLintock,"" the ""Quite Man"" is more for adults than the entire family.  I loved ""McLintock"" when I saw it on the big screen in 1963, I was thrilled when it came out in VHS (although the quality was bad), and I am honored to own McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition).  I just wish that AMAZON.COM would differentiate reviews for each version of a movie, as most of the bad reviews of movies are about the disk quality or some other aspect of the product, and not about the movie itself. Hence, the overall reviewer rating for ""McLintock"" is three stars, mostly, if not entirely, because previously released versions had major quality issues.  But those bad reviews serve to inhibit people from buying the ""McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)"" version.  Granted, quality is an issue; but one that needs to be addressed to the studios, not the movie.  Thus, if I need a lift, I turn to ""McLintock,"" because it has humor, sarcasm, and hope--not because the quality of the disk or features are less than desired.This delightfully wonderful film essentially spawned a new genre, western comedies, which ultimately lead to Lee Marvin's Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  ""McLintock"" also reunited John Wayne with Maureen O'Hara, one of the few actors who could push Wayne to do his best work--in deed, I would include all of their (I believe eight) movies in the top 20 movies John Wayne made.  I would like to note that this was NOT their last movie--as stated in other reviews--together, ""Big Jake"" (1971) being one that comes to mind immediately.While Amazon's review pans the bonus features--again, something that has nothing to do with how great the film is--I found them quite entertaining and interesting.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.

(Note: this review was written on 9/21/06)I am writing about the ""Authentic Collector's Edition"", the one with the red stripe on top of the DVD case. Not the Special Edition, not the Super Duper Edition, not the John Wayne Foundation Edition, but the AUTHENTIC COLLECTOR'S EDITION, OK?You will agree, this is John Wayne's best comedic role by far. You can tell he's very comfortable on the set with long time pal Andrew McGlaglen behind the camera. This movie is very funny, and set the tone for other western comedies of the 60's/70's like The Rounders, Cheyenne Social Club and others in this vein. Maureen O'Hara is wonderful with her bitchy Scarlett O'Hara persona that just begs for a spanking by the Duke. This is the No.1 classic of the genre IMO. You can basically see the G.W. McLintock character again in North to Alaska...not as good but still great. oooohhhhh Macklin! Just hilarious.Now, this DVD is incredible. I've read all the reviews over the much maligned former DVD but you can take my word that this remastering is one of the best I've ever seen watching on a digital source. The colors literally jump off the screen, particularly if its a green or purple dress worn by Ms. O'Hara, the details are there too, just a very fine re-issue of a great movie. The audio has also been remastered in a surprising 5.1 which is superior to most DVD issues from this period. More extras here than you will find anywhere else but I havent had the time to check them out yet.

331627,A3NV0G16V04FYM,6302753295,"Jack Baker ""Beauty Will Save the World""","[3, 3]","One of my favorite John Wayne movies, this is a western version of Taming of the Shrew.  The Duke and Maureen O'Hara show off their famous chemistry, starring as George Washington McLintock and his estranged wife Katherine.  These two fine actors are backed by a strong supporting cast, including Stefanie Powers as daughter Rebbecca, Patrick Wayne as Dev Warren, Yvonne DeCarlo as Louise Warren, Chill Wills as Drago, Strother Martin as Agard, and Jerry Van Dyke as Matt Douglas, Jr, among others.The story is simple.  The Duke is the biggest thing in the town that bears his name.  He's a generous kind of a guy, a drinking and good times kind of fellow.  His wife has separated from him, seeking more social standing then the little town can offer.  She returns to town to welcome her daughter back from college and to try and secure a divorce from GW, leading to some humorous results.  Throw in settlers, some restless Indians, Patrick Wayne and Jerry Van Dyke vying for the attention of GW's daughter, and plenty of booze and you have a madcap romp through the old west.  I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but there's a fantastic fight in a mudpit and a great scene involving whiskey and a staircase that should not be missed!The movie is laugh out loud funny and John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara truly have a fantastic rapport.  It's fun to watch these two feed off of each other.  The movie's not too deep and there is some dated racial humor, mostly involving the Chinese cook and some of the Indians, who are also treated conversely as friends and respected former enemies by McLintock.  Those few gaffes aside, the movie is great family fare, not to be missed.Make sure the version you purchase is the Authentic Collector's Edition.  The movie has never looked or sounded better, the transfer superb.  Based on this edition, I plan to purchase other John Wayne films in this series as well.

When about to punch a fellow, McLintock says: ""I won't...I won't...The h___ I will!"" When conversing with his estranged wife Catherine, who suspects him of adultery, he describes her attitude towards him as ""having a burr under the saddle"". She shows him the divorce papers to which he coolly replies: ""No deal"". There are various attitudes shown towards the Indians. Most of the men call them savages. But McLintock displays at least an element of fairness in dealing with them, protecting them in this instance against a false accusation.McLintock's adult daughter also comes from the east, wanting to find out why her father and mother are at odds with each other.  She really does not consider it her business. Later on, several of the women have a conversation, and they mention the fact that men are accused of things most of which are not true.Finally, what western would not be complete with endless processions of cattle and horses, repeated fistfights, garish drunken sprees, etc?

Some of the film looks all right; it's nice and sharp at times. You can tell the film is very dated and at times the image becomes blurry and distorted.

331654,ABLOQZIL42W7I,6302753295,"kone ""kone""","[3, 3]","I saw this movie on TV in the mid-sixties, when it was a two-night movie spectacular.  I loved it then, and I still get a kick out of it today.  Sure, it's a farce, it's sexist, and it's not politically correct, but it's also a lot of fun.  Wayne pretty much plays himself in this comedy, co-starring the fiesty and lovely Maureen O'Hara.  This was the fourth pairing of the two stars, (previously they appeared together in Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, The Wings of Eagles), and their on-screen chemistry is real and intense.  The two carry this movie on their collective shoulders without slouching.  Their on-going relationship battle is the framework from which this movie moves forward, and is akin to the chess game that Wayne plays early on in the film: one makes a move, and the other reacts (usually in a very funny way). It is not meant to be a serious film whatsoever; it was made for fun, a chance to pair Wayne with Maureen again, and with Wayne being film money magnet, a chance for the production company to turn a nifty profit.It has been written that at some point in John Wayne's career, he started to become the characters he played on the big screen - life imitating art.  Perhaps this film begins the transformation process.  Through the character of McClintok, Wayne dispenses his views on what it means to be a man, what a man-woman relationship should be, the role of government in life, his view of politicians, freedom, self-expression, and even race relations.  O'Hara, every bit Wayne's equal in this film, shows her natural fiestiness, and what every woman wants in her man - someone who will pursue her with passion, manliness, and romance.The supporting cast is a pretty good one, with Yvonne D'Carlo, Patrick Wayne, Steffanie Powers, Chill Wills, Jerry Van Dyke (Dick's brother), and Edgar Buchanan (Uncle Joe of Petticoat Junction fame).The film is noted for its unforgetable and oh so fun mud fight, and the grande finale, when Wayne chases down O'Hara on main street at high noon, in order to give her a public spanking, and winning her back to his side in the process.  During the film, O'Hara's character, Katie, says she wants a cultured, sensitive man, yet, what she really wants is Wayne to show her in a demonstrative way that he loves her, is devoted to her, and will still romance her.  Fittingly, the showdown on main street, has Wayne doing just that, although in his unique manly way.There's nothing profound here, no dramatic acting or academy awards, just a fun film with two stars that shine like bright headlights.kone",5,Western Comedy John Wayne Style,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,2565,"['saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'mid-sixties', 'when', 'was', 'two-night', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'loved', 'then', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'today', 'Sure', 'farce', 'sexist', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'Wayne', 'pretty', 'much', 'plays', 'comedy', 'co-starring', 'fiesty', 'lovely', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'was', 'fourth', 'pairing', 'two', 'stars', 'previously', 'appeared', 'together', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Wings', 'Eagles', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'real', 'intense', 'two', 'carry', 'movie', 'collective', 'shoulders', 'slouching', 'on-going', 'relationship', 'battle', 'framework', 'movie', 'forward', 'akin', 'chess', 'game', 'Wayne', 'early', 'film', 'one', 'move', 'other', 'reacts', 'usually', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'made', 'fun', 'chance', 'pair', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', 'again', 'Wayne', 'being', 'film', 'money', 'magnet', 'chance', 'production', 'company', 'turn', 'nifty', 'profit.It', 'been', 'written', 'point', 'John', 'Wayne', 'career', 'started', 'become', 'characters', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'transformation', 'process', 'character', 'McClintok', 'Wayne', 'views', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'what', 'man-woman', 'relationship', 'should', 'be', 'role', 'government', 'life', 'view', 'politicians', 'freedom', 'self-expression', 'even', 'race', 'relations', ""O'Hara"", 'bit', 'Wayne', 'equal', 'film', 'natural', 'fiestiness', 'what', 'woman', 'man', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'pursue', 'passion', 'manliness', 'romance.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'Yvonne', ""D'Carlo"", 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Steffanie', 'Powers', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Dick', 'brother', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', 'fame', '.The', 'film', 'noted', 'unforgetable', 'so', 'fun', 'mud', 'fight', 'grande', 'finale', 'when', 'Wayne', 'down', ""O'Hara"", 'main', 'street', 'high', 'noon', 'order', 'give', 'public', 'spanking', 'winning', 'back', 'side', 'process', 'film', ""O'Hara"", 'character', 'Katie', 'cultured', 'sensitive', 'man', 'yet', 'what', 'really', 'Wayne', 'show', 'demonstrative', 'way', 'devoted', 'will', 'still', 'romance', 'Fittingly', 'showdown', 'main', 'street', 'Wayne', 'doing', 'just', 'unique', 'manly', 'nothing', 'profound', 'here', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'academy', 'awards', 'just', 'fun', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'shine', 'bright', 'headlights.kone']",N/A

WARNING: This review includes some minor SPOILERS!""Mclintock"" is one of the very few pure comedies John Wayne appeared in. Although officially a western, this film is in fact an absolutely not serious retelling of the ""Taming of the shrew"", with some slapstick elements.George Washington ""G.W."" McLintock (John Wayne) is an extremely healthy and somehow aged cattle baron, who owns most of the land, water rights and businesses in and around the good city of Mclintock, named after him of course. McLintock began his life without a penny to his name and he is very much a self made man, something he is very proud about. Last years however, ever since his wife Katherine (Maureen O'Hara) left him, were kind of hard on him and he started to drink even heavier than usual. He is also in conflict with some local civil servants, beginning with the governor of the territory. And then, all of a sudden, his estranged wife arrives to the town, willing to obtain divorce and sole custody of their daughter Becky (Stephanie Powers) - which would be bad enough already, even without Ms McLintock finding out her husband just recently hired an attractive lady (Yvonne De Carlo), officially as a cook. Even worse, ""G.W."" favors one of his hired hands, Devlin (played by Patrick Wayne, ""Duke""s son) as his future son-in-law and Becky seems also to be sweet on him - something that is anathema for Katherine, who dreams of her daughter marrying one of distinguished gentlemen from the East Coast...What follows is a pure comedy, with jokes not always flying very high, but it is still a very entertaining, very relaxing and quite heart warming show. Made in 1963 this is a rather old film, but I do not think it aged so much (as ""Taming of the shrew"", which is much older, didn't age either...).Some scenes including Indians are a little bit naive, but on another hand in this western the ""Injuns"" are also shown as quite noble and tragic characters. At one moment a Commanche chief about to be arrested says to the governor: ""We will not just die away, we will go, but not without a fight. It will not be a big fight because there is not many of us left and we have only few guns, but there will be a fight before the Comanches are gone"". This is a surprisingly good speech to be found in a slapstick comedy...A great delight of this film is in its total lack of political correctness. There is a Chinese guy working on McLintock's ranch and every word he says is a pure delight, but of course today nobody would dare make any Chinese speak like that... Many John Wayne's lines seem to come straight from an Ayn Rand book, so if your political opinions are a little bit left from center, watching this film can cause you some hypertension. There also seem to be only three things required from a man to be ""real"" man - work hard, never ask for any handouts and never, NEVER refuse a challenge to a fistfight...For the feminists, well, watching this film can be life threatening, as each of the main female characters is ultimately ""tamed"" with a hearty spanking...)))As far as the technical aspects of this 2007 DVD (the one with red stripes on top and bottom of cover) are concerned, be advised that not only this is the COMPLETE and UNCUT version, but also the film and the soundtrack were restored and cleaned, so the quality of image and sound is EXCELLENT!Bottom line, I liked this film very, VERY much, I spend a lovely evening watching it. This is a guaranteed remedy against bad mood after a hard day at the office.

John Wayne is G.W. McLintock, owner of half of Oklahoma (or Arizona, there is no official explaination but the new settlers are referred to as ""Sooners"", so I guess it's Oklahoma) must deal with incoming settlers, upset Indians, a befuddled Mayor 'n Governor, a prissy Indian agent, and most importantly his stuck-up wife played by Maureen O' Hara.  Sub-plots abound in this production, but it ultimately comes down to Wayne getting so sick and tired of his wife's attitude that he finally chases her down and spanks her good with a fireplace shovel.  In it's defense, this film is sort of a western remake of Shakespears' ""The Taming of the Shrew"", but the lead actors seem about 20 years too old for this to really work.Another annoying aspect is the stereotypical ""Chinese Cook"" (H.W. Gim) who speaks in pidgin English and rants on about how miserable his ""crummy family"" is. Not to mention the Indian sub-plot which is really too serious for a film like this. Yet, it does effectively lead to the climax of the picture.The film does have some big laughs and what really works is the relaxed pace, allowing us to get to enjoy many of these characters. The entire cast and John Wayne in particular seems to be enjoying themselves a lot.  Wayne has some memorable lines and seems quite comfortible working in a comedy.  Of particular note is his scene with the lovely Yvonne De Carlo where he declares that his tossing his hat onto the weather vane ""309 times in a row...gotta be a record!"" is particularly good.There is the famous big fight sequence, complete with a muddy slope which Wayne, O'Hara, & and the rest of the cast take at least one trip down.  As well as some numerous famous lines such as Wayne's ""Pilgrim"" speech he gives just before the fight.  But my favorite has to be the one given by bit player ""Big"" Jim Hamilton, who declares just after the Indians shoot up the town, ""Aw folks, we're not gonna let a little old Indian raid ruin a good bar-b-que 'n rodeo, are we?!""I found the DVD transfer of the film to be sharp and quite good.  And I cannot say enough about seeing this film in widescreen which makes the experience even more enjoyable.The DVD extras are plentiful and informative.  Particularly the recent interviews with Stephanie Powers and the still-regal Maureen O'Hara (who is closing in on 90 years old).  The ""2 minute fight school"" is a rather nice piece from two stuntmen who demonstrate the classic technique used in ""McLintock"".  The commentary from Leonard Maltin & Frank Thompson is particularly good, especially when combined with other comments by O'Hara, Powers, & Michael Pate (who played ""Puma""). I do wonder why Jerry Van Dyke was not included as I can't believe he was busy that day...I highly recommend this DVD for John Wayne fans and those who want to see the ""Duke"" in a more comedic role. So despite some flaws, it gets the highest rating from me and I hope that ""Batjac"" will keep producing widescreen DVD versions of the rest of John Wayne's films.",5,"Love In The Country, Indeed!",1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,3312,"['Just', 'when', 'think', 'Batjac', 'would', 'never', 'release', 'widescreen', 'version', 'film', 'here', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'as', 'well', 'price', 'McLintock', 'one', 'most', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'rather', 'sexist', 'twist', 'crude', 'stereotype', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'G.W', 'McLintock', 'owner', 'half', 'Oklahoma', 'Arizona', 'official', 'explaination', 'new', 'settlers', 'are', 'referred', 'Sooners', 'guess', 'Oklahoma', 'must', 'deal', 'incoming', 'settlers', 'upset', 'Indians', 'befuddled', 'Mayor', 'n', 'Governor', 'prissy', 'Indian', 'agent', 'most', 'importantly', 'stuck-up', 'wife', 'played', 'Maureen', 'O', 'Hara', 'Sub-plots', 'abound', 'production', 'ultimately', 'down', 'Wayne', 'getting', 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'wife', 'attitude', 'finally', 'down', 'spanks', 'good', 'fireplace', 'shovel', 'defense', 'film', 'sort', 'western', 'remake', 'Shakespears', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'lead', 'actors', 'seem', '20', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'really', 'work.Another', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'stereotypical', 'Chinese', 'Cook', 'H.W', 'Gim', 'who', 'pidgin', 'English', 'rants', 'how', 'miserable', 'crummy', 'family', 'Not', 'mention', 'Indian', 'sub-plot', 'really', 'too', 'serious', 'film', 'effectively', 'lead', 'climax', 'picture.The', 'film', 'have', 'big', 'laughs', 'what', 'really', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'allowing', 'get', 'enjoy', 'many', 'characters', 'entire', 'cast', 'John', 'Wayne', 'particular', 'be', 'enjoying', 'lot', 'Wayne', 'memorable', 'lines', 'quite', 'comfortible', 'working', 'comedy', 'particular', 'note', 'scene', 'lovely', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'where', 'tossing', 'hat', 'weather', 'vane', '309', 'times', 'row', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'record', 'particularly', 'good.There', 'famous', 'big', 'fight', 'sequence', 'complete', 'muddy', 'slope', 'Wayne', ""O'Hara"", 'rest', 'cast', 'take', 'least', 'one', 'trip', 'down', 'As', 'well', 'numerous', 'famous', 'lines', 'such', 'Wayne', 'Pilgrim', 'speech', 'just', 'fight', 'favorite', 'be', 'one', 'given', 'bit', 'player', 'Big', 'Jim', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'just', 'Indians', 'shoot', 'up', 'town', 'Aw', 'folks', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'let', 'little', 'old', 'Indian', 'raid', 'ruin', 'good', 'bar-b-que', 'n', 'rodeo', 'are', 'found', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'film', 'be', 'sharp', 'quite', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'seeing', 'film', 'widescreen', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'informative', 'Particularly', 'recent', 'interviews', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'still-regal', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'closing', '90', 'years', 'old', '2', 'minute', 'fight', 'school', 'rather', 'nice', 'piece', 'two', 'stuntmen', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'classic', 'technique', 'used', 'McLintock', 'commentary', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'Frank', 'Thompson', 'particularly', 'good', 'especially', 'when', 'combined', 'other', 'comments', ""O'Hara"", 'Powers', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'who', 'played', 'Puma', 'do', 'wonder', 'why', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'busy', 'day', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'Duke', 'more', 'comedic', 'role', 'So', 'flaws', 'highest', 'rating', 'hope', 'Batjac', 'will', 'keep', 'producing', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'versions', 'rest', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films']",N/A

Why are some of the scenes good looking and others just awful. The telencine was very poorly done and not consistent. How did this happen? Was this a first try that was abandoned? Was the pan-and-scan an early version that had not quite worked out the details.

And they have fun with this film.In the introduction by Leonard Maltin, he states this is based on Taming of the Shrew but if anything this is a sequel twenty years later.GW McClintock (Wayne) is the cattle baron whose family founded the town of McClintock.  But his family life is a mess.  His wife, Katherine (O'Hara) has left him for a socialite life.  And his daughter, Becky (Stephanie Powers) is returning from College.  Kate has returned to take Becky away from her father's bad influence but GW will not allow it.What ensues is a great battle of wills and ways.  This film is deeper than just the main story line.  The subplots includes one of John Ford's favorite subjects, the mistreatment of the Native Americans.There is not much real plot to this film but a ton of heart.  There were only two actresses that seemed to understand how to act with the Duke, Lauren Bacall and Maureen O'Hara.  O'Hara is on of the great actresses that never received the attention that was she deserved.  This film shows that you can give her something flimsy and she can make it look great.  And like many of Duke's films, this has a great fight scene in which everyone winds up sliding down a mud hill - sometimes twice!!  And the stars did their own stunts.  And the film ends with a great chase scene between O'Hara and Wayne.This is one good hoot of a film.  The only thing missing from this film is John Ford behind the camera but they have Ford's constant AD Andrew McLaglen (Son of Oscar winner and constant Ford film star Victor McLaglen.)  It was also early films from Stephanie Powers and Patrick Wayne.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by Leonard Malting, Frank Thompson, Maureen O'Hara, Stephanie Powers, Michael Pale, Michael Wayne and Andrew McLaglenThe Batjac Story: The Legacy of Michael Wayne - A 23 minute featurette about the eldest son of Duke and how he created his own way in the industry and outside the industry.

331696,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302753295,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","This is the Duke at his two-fisted, brawling best, along with Maureen O'Hara, who lights up the screen, in ""McLintock!"" a rousing western/comedy directed by Andrew W. McLaglen.  John Wayne is George Washington McLintock, cattle baron and owner of just about everything around for as far as the eye can see.  He owns cattle, mines and lumber, and even the town is named after him.  And he's a fair man and a good employer to boot, who pays a fair wage for a good day's work.  He even hires a young man, Devlin Warren (Patrick Wayne), who has come in with a group of homesteaders who have been given land by the government and plan to farm the Mesa Verde, even though, as McLintock warns them, it's impossible to farm at 6000 feet above sea level.  In the meantime, young Devlin has to support his mother, Louise (Yvonne De Carlo) and his sister, Alice (Aissa Wayne).  So G.W. even hires Louise to be the cook for his outfit.  McLintock is The Man in these parts, and he earns the respect he is accorded by most of the good citizens of the territory.  But he has one problem, and it's a big one; and it comes in quite a package:  His estranged wife, Katherine (O'Hara), who has just come back to town to settle a certain issue with her husband.  And the fireworks begin the minute she steps off the train.The main bone of contention has to do with their daughter, Becky (Stefanie Powers), who will be returning home from college soon.  Katherine wants to take her east to live; G.W. in having none of it.  And shades of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,"" that's his final answer.  The real rub is that G.W. still loves Katherine, and he still doesn't know what put the burr in her saddle and caused her to leave him two years earlier.  It's also obvious that Katherine still loves G.W., but she apparently can't get past whatever it was that caused the split in the first place.  But her eyes sparkle whenever Drago (Chill Wills), G.W.'s right hand man, brings up the ""good ol' days,"" and she's reminded of when they started out with nothing but each other and a lot of love and courage.There's a touch of ""Taming of the Shrew,"" in this story, and near the end Wayne and O'Hara virtually reenact one of their own scenes from ""The Quiet Man,"" all of which adds up to a couple of hours worth of good, old fashioned fun.  This movie never pretends or aspires to be anything other than what it is, which is good, wholesome entertainment that features some memorable characters, lots of humor and some classic lines.  The Duke is trim and healthy and never swaggered better, and O'Hara, in a green dress against which her gorgeous red hair absolutely glows, makes you wonder if there's ever been a more beautiful actress ever to grace the silver screen.  And the two of them have a chemistry together that ranks right up there with the best pairings the movies ever had to offer.  The Duke may be in command, but he certainly has his hands full with that fighting Irish wildcat, O'Hara.  Together, they've created some moments on screen that will live forever.Adding to the merriment is an all-star supporting cast that includes Jerry Van Dyke (Matt, Jr.), Hank Worden (Curly), Bruce Cabot (Ben), Jack Kruschen (Jake), Edgar Buchanan (Bunny), Perry Lopez (Davey Elk), Michael Pate (Puma), Strother Martin (Agard), Gordon Jones (Douglas), Robert Lowery (Governor Humphrey), H.W. Gim (Ching), Edward Faulkner (Young Ben), Chuck Roberson (Sheriff), Mari Blanchard (Camille), Leo Gordon (Jones), Bob Steele (Train Engineer) and Big John Hamilton (Fauntleroy).  McLaglen sets the pace and keeps this vintage Wayne/O'Hara vehicle right on task, which makes ""McLintock!"" a classic in it's own right.  It's a timeless film that captures the attitude and freedom of a time gone by that simply does not exist anymore in this, our ""advanced"" era of political correctness, which often stifles the very freedom it espouses.  And watching this movie, it makes you wonder about the ""progress"" we've made in the past thirty years or so.  As far as movies go, this one is magic, and it proves that they just don't make `em like they used to.",5,Wayne and O'Hara Win the West,989798400,"05 14, 2001",2001,4115,"['Duke', 'two-fisted', 'brawling', 'best', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'up', 'screen', 'McLintock', 'rousing', 'western/comedy', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'W.', 'McLaglen', 'John', 'Wayne', 'George', 'Washington', 'McLintock', 'cattle', 'baron', 'owner', 'just', 'everything', 'around', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'cattle', 'mines', 'lumber', 'even', 'town', 'named', 'fair', 'man', 'good', 'employer', 'boot', 'who', 'fair', 'wage', 'good', 'day', 'work', 'even', 'young', 'man', 'Devlin', 'Warren', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'who', 'come', 'group', 'homesteaders', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'land', 'government', 'plan', 'farm', 'Mesa', 'Verde', 'even', 'though', 'McLintock', 'impossible', 'farm', '6000', 'feet', 'sea', 'level', 'meantime', 'young', 'Devlin', 'support', 'mother', 'Louise', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'sister', 'Alice', 'Aissa', 'Wayne', 'So', 'G.W', 'even', 'Louise', 'be', 'cook', 'outfit', 'McLintock', 'Man', 'parts', 'respect', 'accorded', 'most', 'good', 'citizens', 'territory', 'one', 'problem', 'big', 'one', 'quite', 'package', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Katherine', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'just', 'come', 'back', 'town', 'settle', 'certain', 'issue', 'husband', 'fireworks', 'begin', 'minute', 'train.The', 'main', 'bone', 'contention', 'do', 'daughter', 'Becky', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'home', 'college', 'soon', 'Katherine', 'take', 'east', 'live', 'G.W', 'having', 'none', 'shades', 'Who', 'Be', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'final', 'answer', 'real', 'rub', 'G.W', 'still', 'Katherine', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'put', 'burr', 'saddle', 'caused', 'leave', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'also', 'obvious', 'Katherine', 'still', 'G.W.', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'whatever', 'was', 'caused', 'split', 'first', 'place', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'whenever', 'Drago', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'G.W', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'up', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'reminded', 'when', 'started', 'out', 'nothing', 'other', 'lot', 'love', 'courage.There', 'touch', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'story', 'end', 'Wayne', ""O'Hara"", 'virtually', 'reenact', 'one', 'own', 'scenes', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'up', 'couple', 'hours', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fun', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'good', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'memorable', 'characters', 'lots', 'humor', 'classic', 'lines', 'Duke', 'trim', 'healthy', 'never', 'swaggered', 'better', ""O'Hara"", 'green', 'dress', 'gorgeous', 'red', 'hair', 'absolutely', 'wonder', 'ever', 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'two', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'ranks', 'right', 'there', 'best', 'pairings', 'movies', 'ever', 'had', 'offer', 'Duke', 'may', 'be', 'command', 'certainly', 'hands', 'full', 'fighting', 'Irish', 'wildcat', ""O'Hara"", 'Together', ""'ve"", 'created', 'moments', 'screen', 'will', 'live', 'forever.Adding', 'merriment', 'all-star', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Matt', 'Jr.', 'Hank', 'Worden', 'Curly', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'Ben', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'Jake', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Bunny', 'Perry', 'Lopez', 'Davey', 'Elk', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'Puma', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Agard', 'Gordon', 'Jones', 'Douglas', 'Robert', 'Lowery', 'Governor', 'Humphrey', 'H.W', 'Gim', 'Ching', 'Edward', 'Faulkner', 'Young', 'Ben', 'Chuck', 'Roberson', 'Sheriff', 'Mari', 'Blanchard', 'Camille', 'Leo', 'Gordon', 'Jones', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'Train', 'Engineer', 'Big', 'John', 'Hamilton', 'Fauntleroy', 'McLaglen', 'pace', 'vintage', ""Wayne/O'Hara"", 'vehicle', 'right', 'task', 'McLintock', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'timeless', 'film', 'attitude', 'freedom', 'time', 'gone', 'simply', 'not', 'exist', 'anymore', 'advanced', 'era', 'political', 'correctness', 'often', 'very', 'freedom', 'watching', 'movie', 'wonder', 'progress', ""'ve"", 'made', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'magic', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'em', 'used']",N/A

331707,A3AD071UEP20WS,6302753295,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[3, 5]","This movie goes off in several directions and never gets back together.  For a while it is about a group of settlers who have come to the unnamed territory to farm, but that is soon dropped.  For a while it is about the plight of Indians, but that is never resolved.  Sometimes it is about various romances, and they dribble away.  There is a great deal of chasing and fighting and humiliation of women.  The only thread through it all is the relationship between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, and that is resolved by the Duke giving her a hard spanking with a coal scuttle in the middle of town on the 4th of July with all the townspeople looking on and applauding.The moral seems to be that problems can be solved only by violence and humiliation.  The characters are strictly one dimensional.  And that's too bad, because this movie has a competent cast of actors.  There are two long scenes, one of a fight at a mine in which all the characters go down a mud slide into a pool of slop.  The other long scene is John Wayne chasing Maureen O'Hara through the streets and byways of town, while she loses articles of clothing, falls in a horse trough, and generally demeans herself.I love westerns.

John Wayne is talking to a group of college kids about something that happened to their Dean.  His point is that back in his day, this sort of thing would have not been tolerated.  Not only by the administration but also by the rest of the student body.  He is telling the men in the audience that they are basically jerks and he is doing it in a VERY SLURRED VOICE!!!  Make your assumption here...VERY FUNNY!!!Starring as wealthy cattle baron G.W. McLintock, Wayne shows a real sense of comic timing in several scenes filled with slapstick humor.  John Wayne shows off his funny side in this 1963 western, a comedy inspired by THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. After his wife (Maureen O'Hara) and daughter leave him for the East, McLintock attempts to win them back. The dynamics between O'Hara and Wayne are the strong suit of this film, the actors having worked together previously on THE QUIET MAN. As this is by no means a revisionist western, McLintock's chauvinistic attempts to ""tame"" his wife fit within the problematic ideology of the larger western genre. The ultimate example of this comes at the end of the film when McLintock settles his marital dispute by publicly ""spanking"" his wife in what is now a notorious cinematic moment.",5,Great Movie with a HILARIOUS John Wayne Interview...You can't miss this!!!,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,1309,"['First', 'have', 'comment', 'interview', 'along', 'Bonus', 'John', 'Wayne', 'talking', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'something', 'happened', 'Dean', 'point', 'back', 'day', 'sort', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'tolerated', 'Not', 'only', 'administration', 'also', 'rest', 'student', 'body', 'telling', 'men', 'audience', 'are', 'basically', 'jerks', 'doing', 'VERY', 'SLURRED', 'VOICE', 'Make', 'assumption', 'here', 'VERY', 'FUNNY', 'Starring', 'wealthy', 'cattle', 'baron', 'G.W', 'McLintock', 'Wayne', 'real', 'sense', 'comic', 'timing', 'several', 'scenes', 'filled', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'John', 'Wayne', 'funny', 'side', '1963', 'western', 'comedy', 'inspired', 'THE', 'TAMING', 'THE', 'SHREW', 'wife', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'leave', 'East', 'McLintock', 'win', 'back', 'dynamics', ""O'Hara"", 'Wayne', 'are', 'strong', 'suit', 'film', 'actors', 'having', 'worked', 'together', 'previously', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'revisionist', 'western', 'McLintock', 'chauvinistic', 'attempts', 'tame', 'wife', 'fit', 'problematic', 'ideology', 'larger', 'western', 'genre', 'ultimate', 'example', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'McLintock', 'marital', 'dispute', 'publicly', 'spanking', 'wife', 'what', 'now', 'notorious', 'cinematic', 'moment']",N/A
