1567708,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B008JFUSI2,Amanda Pike,"[1, 2]","I won't deny that Maleficent has it's flaws.  But I found the film to be charming.Maleficent is a beautiful movie. It has plot holes that are very easy to poke at but it's still decent and sweet. The &#34;true love&#34; aspect felt like a slight rip off of Frozen and I wish they could have given the prince a bigger role and or let there be romantic true love in there somewhere even if it was between Diaval and Maleficent. I freakin' love Diaval by the way.There are a few things I prefer from the earlier script such as king Stefan secretly being half-faery and the bastard of a faery king so Aurura could end up developing her own faery magick (that was in the earlier script but not the finished movie). The three pixies are done better in the movie than in the earlier script though. In the earlier script they were kind of bitchy. Now they are just bungling.Angelina Jolie plays the role so well that I actually felt bad when she woke up with her wings missing. Visually it's gorgeous. The creatures all resemble Brian Froud illustrations. My biggest complaint is Stefan. He was a bit over-the-top. Diaval is my favorite character though. He has this adorable, dysfunctional relationship with Maleficent.For purists to the original fairy tale, the best way to look at it is it's an alternate reality because this is certainly NOT the Maleficent of the animated Sleeping Beauty. The fact that the three pixies don't even have the names from the animated film make that apparent.You do have to shut your mind off a little but it is good enough a movie that you can ignore it's flaws.",4,Charming,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,1589,"['wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Maleficent', 'flaws', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'charming.Maleficent', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'poke', 'still', 'decent', 'sweet', '34', 'true', 'love', '34', 'aspect', 'felt', 'slight', 'rip', 'Frozen', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'prince', 'bigger', 'role', 'let', 'be', 'romantic', 'true', 'love', 'somewhere', 'even', 'was', 'Diaval', 'Maleficent', 'freakin', 'love', 'Diaval', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'script', 'such', 'king', 'Stefan', 'secretly', 'being', 'half-faery', 'bastard', 'faery', 'king', 'so', 'Aurura', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'developing', 'own', 'faery', 'magick', 'was', 'earlier', 'script', 'not', 'finished', 'movie', 'three', 'pixies', 'are', 'done', 'better', 'movie', 'earlier', 'script', 'earlier', 'script', 'were', 'kind', 'bitchy', 'Now', 'are', 'just', 'bungling.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'actually', 'felt', 'bad', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'wings', 'missing', 'Visually', 'gorgeous', 'creatures', 'resemble', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'illustrations', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Stefan', 'was', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Diaval', 'favorite', 'character', 'adorable', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'Maleficent.For', 'purists', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'best', 'way', 'look', 'alternate', 'reality', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'Maleficent', 'animated', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'fact', 'three', 'pixies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'names', 'animated', 'film', 'make', 'apparent.You', 'do', 'have', 'shut', 'mind', 'little', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'can', 'ignore', 'flaws']",N/A
1567709,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B008JFUSI2,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 4]","Every now and then a movie that I have nearly no interest in comes along and surprises me. Maleficent is obviously one of those movies, since you can see my rating above this review. I'm not a big Angelina Jolie fan, mainly because I've seen maybe 4 of her films, and Disney's track record with live action (and I use that term loosely) movies over the last couple of years hasn't been the best. Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, Oz the Great and Powerful may as well have been a sequel, Tron Legacy had boring fight sequences and too much exposition for its own good while still being pretty, and well...let's not bring up any of their others. I hadn't seen very many previews for Maleficent, although the production images I saw looked very good as far as the costumes, makeup and art direction went. On my birthday 2 weeks ago, the screening for another movie some friends and I were going to see was packed, so we decided to see something else. It came down to X-Men: Days of Future Past or Maleficent. I was fine with either, so we went with Maleficent. Not only does the film give me hope for future live Disney movies, it shows that they haven't lost touch with the magic that made them what they are. This is a fairytale movie through and through while doing things differently enough to keep you interested. And the best part? It moves fast enough to never have any boring parts, and yet not too fast as to lose you along the way. This isn't simply ""her side of the story"" as a companion piece to Sleeping Beauty, but an entirely new take on the classic, taking it in another direction.Maleficent was a happy little girl, a long time ago. She lived in an enchanted forest with all kinds of creatures that were nice to her and helped her out. Tree people, little troll-like dudes, the different animals, you name it and they were buddies with her. Maleficent had magical powers, including the power to fly thanks to her beautiful wings. One day, a human boy entered the forest and they hit it off, becoming friends almost immediately. Time went on and well, he didn't exactly turn out to be who she thought he was. As a result, Maleficent became the dark, hardened sorceress we know her as in the animated Sleeping Beauty movie. Cut to a few years later and she finds out that the man is to be a father. Guess who wasn't invited to the celebration party? That's right. Not only does Maleficent put a curse on the new baby princess Aurora, the king becomes obsessed with making sure she stays safe as well as doing whatever he can to infiltrate Maleficent's forest and kill her. He gives his baby to three fairies to live in a cottage far away from everyone, where they'll be spending many years raising the girl and ensuring the curse doesn't happen. They're not alone though...I'm so, SO glad that this wasn't a reboot or live action adaptation of Sleeping Beauty. Disney really went the extra mile with the character of Maleficent, giving her depth unseen in the original. Having her be more involved with Aurora than just ""oh, I didn't get invited to your birthday, so I don't like you. You're gonna touch a needle and sleep forever LOL see ya"". Seeing her betrayed and left out after having an emotional connection with someone she loved was something a lot of people can relate to, and I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who wished they had incredible powers to wreak destruction when such things happened to them. When Maleficent is mad, she shows it- marching to the castle from her forest while everything in front of her is broken apart. How's that for symbolism? She's not just a villain, it's not that simple. She was good, betrayed, and goes after the person who in one way, ruined her life. She's getting revenge, and if anyone gets in her way, so be it. This isn't a simple black and white issue with her character- she's very much in the grey.Disney also kept the cast of characters to a small handful. Aside from Maleficent and Aurora, it's basically just the fairies, the obsessed king, Maleficent's bird that she transforms into a human (and transforms into other animals) and a certain young prince. All of the acting is great, even the child actors! Young Maleficent, toddler Aurora, teen Aurora, the bickering fairies, everyone. Angelina Jolie has also officially won me over with her delivery and especially her facial expressions. So much could be said without using words just by the look on her face in many scenes. 90% of the special effects looked wonderful, especially the dragon and scenes in the beginning where Maleficent is flying around. I was happy to see that Disney didn't go gung ho with her powers, making them something special when she did use them. All of my fears about the movie looking like something a computer threw up and then laminated, like the Star Wars prequels, were put to rest early on, and stayed that way throughout. Even my fear about there being boring battles that no one cared about (again, see Alice and Oz) was for naught. This movie is all about the characters.My only complaint is a pretty silly one, and it's that the fairies, when not in their human forms, didn't look that great. The CG models for them looked out of place in this movie, which is really saying something when you have tree creatures and other strange forest folk in the first part of the movie. Something about them looked cheap, like they belonged in the Alice in Wonderland CG...I mean, live action movie. True, they're in their human forms for 80% of their screen time, but when they transformed, it threw me off every time.All in all, Maleficent is a blast. There aren't any parts I can think of that would disturb young children. I'd have no objections letting my 7 year old daughter watch it. This is not a ""bad guy movie"". It may look dark and stars someone who is a classic Disney villain, yet it's so much more. At the very least, anyone interested in Maleficent should at least rent it. I'll definitely be buying it when it comes out on blu-ray, and I don't really buy movies any more. See it in theaters while it's still out and really take in the experience.",4,I can't wait to see what they do with Cinderella's mice.,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,6180,"['now', 'then', 'movie',

A culmination of the movie's events doesn't have to be a battle, rush of plot points or something that Michael Bay has perfected; over-the-topness. ""The Wizard of Oz"", a movie that has stood the test of time and has been attempted to be remade and retold over and over to 'blah' results, ended with a bucket of water. Despite that though, ""Maleficent"" is, for the most part, a beautifully filmed and portrayed fairy-tale in the tradition of classics like ""Legend"", ""Labyrinth"", ""Stardust"" or the movie that it is based upon, ""Sleeping Beauty"". In fact, Angelina Jolie's portrayal of the fairy Maleficent may be the most memorable anti/hero of all-time. It was that good.The title character ""Maleficent"" was made famous in 1959 in the Disney animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"". Previously, she dubbed herself `the mistress of all evil' and currently things aren't so cut and dry. Jolie's Maleficent is a lot more complex and it made what could have been an ordinary film into something memorable and long lasting.There are some scenes in ""Maleficent"" that are so beautifully done that I was completely lost in imagination. Jolie goes through such subtle and haunting changes throughout the film that you understand why she was and has been such a heralded actress throughout her career. As Elle Fanning's Aurora grows into a teenager, your emotions are rightfully so, pulled from left to right. Aurora is such a genuine, decent and caring soul, yet Maleficent is toying with her and manipulating every facet of her life. It is completely captivating and without any over-the-topness, it is the best part of the film.In the midst of all the story-telling, much of the vital story elements were given cliff's notes coverage and the importance of those moments were lost. Possibly the creators assumed that the audience had seen 1959's ""Sleeping Beauty"", but even so, some of the critical plot points deserved more than a cough or quick narration.The grand finale rushed through plot point after plot point in an effort to be intense and give people their money's worth.

1567717,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B008JFUSI2,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 3]","Fairy tales rarely lend themselves well to character development.  They're primarily event-focused.  Sleeping Beauty is one of the few which is about events which take place over a long period of time but don't involve a single main protagonist.  That makes it less jarring to focus on Maleficent.  There are some interesting developments in the Maleficent story which make it kind of like a Greek tragedy, in that Maleficent becomes hate-filled because of what humans have done, repents, but it's too late to stop the curse.  However, the story DOES end happily, unlike a tragedy.  I prefer fairy tales to have clear good and bad characters and courageous actions.  The Maleficent story intentionally changes this.  I wasn't unhappy with the changes so much as just didn't find 'em appealing.  A little less stereotyping of the fairy kingdom and human kingdom would've been nice.  I think the success of the movie Avatar probably had something to do with the humans being the greedy ones and the fairies being happier because they're close to nature.  The atmosphere, computer effects, Ent-like fairy creatures, and style of fantasy (a mix of military and supernatural components in a medieval environment) were definitely influenced by the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I picked up on that quite early.  I had no idea how influential Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy would be when it came out, but pretty much every fantasy movie made since then has copied its flavor somewhat.  Angelina Jolie is an excellent person to play a witch/evil fairy because of her beauty and authoritative, stern comportment.  I do wish the fairy tale had been told in the normal way, though, because I love the visual beauty and casting in this movie and can really envision loving the movie if the fairy tale story hadn't been changed.  It may suit you; I just prefer that fairy tales be told in a straightforward way.",3,"No strong opinion - interesting, but not what I prefer in a fairy tale",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1921,"['Fairy', 'tales', 'rarely', 'lend', 'well', 'character', 'development', ""'re"", 'primarily', 'event-focused', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'one', 'few', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'single', 'main', 'protagonist', 'less', 'jarring', 'focus', 'Maleficent', 'are', 'interesting', 'developments', 'Maleficent', 'story', 'make', 'kind', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Maleficent', 'hate-filled', 'what', 'humans', 'have', 'done', 'repents', 'too', 'late', 'stop', 'curse', 'However', 'story', 'DOES', 'end', 'happily', 'tragedy', 'prefer', 'fairy', 'tales', 'have', 'clear', 'good', 'bad', 'characters', 'courageous', 'actions', 'Maleficent', 'story', 'intentionally', 'was', ""n't"", 'unhappy', 'changes', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', ""'em"", 'appealing', 'little', 'less', 'stereotyping', 'fairy', 'kingdom', 'human', 'kingdom', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'think', 'success', 'movie', 'Avatar', 'probably', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'humans', 'being', 'greedy', 'ones', 'fairies', 'being', 'happier', ""'re"", 'close', 'nature', 'atmosphere', 'computer', 'effects', 'Ent-like', 'fairy', 'creatures', 'style', 'fantasy', 'mix', 'military', 'supernatural', 'components', 'medieval', 'environment', 'were', 'definitely', 'influenced', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'picked', 'up', 'quite', 'early', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'influential', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'made', 'then', 'copied', 'flavor', 'somewhat', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'excellent', 'person', 'play', 'witch/evil', 'fairy', 'beauty', 'authoritative', 'stern', 'comportment', 'do', 'wish', 'fairy', 'tale', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'normal', 'way', 'though', 'love', 'visual', 'beauty', 'casting', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'envision', 'loving', 'movie', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'changed', 'may', 'suit', 'just', 'prefer', 'fairy', 'tales', 'be', 'told', 'straightforward', 'way']",N/A

Sawin,"[3, 12]","Based on Disney's animated 1959 classic &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; &#34;Maleficent&#34; is a live-action film told from the perspective of the villainous fairy turned demoness. The film stars Angelina Jolie in the title role and puts a new spin on a beloved tale.&#34;Maleficent&#34; is clunky and off-balanced right from the start. Its visuals feeling familiar since they look like this ridiculous blend between Tim Burton's &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; and &#34;Oz: The Great and Powerful.&#34; The film begins with Maleficent as a child and as a fairy; not only with horns but also horned, feathered wings. She believes to fall in love with a boy named Stefan, but the two drift further and further apart as they grow up.Magical creatures live in The Moors; a forest filled with eccentric magic of its own. Once Maleficent reaches adulthood, a war breaks out where the King attempts to destroy anything living in The Moors. Maleficent defeats the King, but is betrayed by an adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley). Stefan eventually becomes king and has a daughter named Aurora, which is where the &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; tale comes into play. After Maleficent's wicked curse goes into effect and she has an opportunity to spend time with the ill-fated child 16 years later (played by Elle Fanning), she begins to realize that she may have made a mistake. Meanwhile, Stefan goes crazy plotting his revenge.Isobelle Molloy, who portrays a young Maleficent, is nerve grating in the role. She spends her time tripping over her English accent and does little to make the audience actually care about the character. Angelina Jolie doesn't have much room to boast either. When Maleficent is evil, Jolie is absolutely fantastic. But those moments don't last very long as the character becomes more and more watered down and diluted until you can't recognize her anymore. Jolie tends to overact at times, especially when she wakes up to realize something she holds very dear has been taken from her.Angelina Jolie is delightfully wicked and relishes in cruel behavior, but she is almost unbearable as a fairy. The dark fantasy adventure begins as an origin story that eventually parallels &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; but then ventures way off course. Maleficent is a character that is thrown into pure darkness, but this film allows her to let the light back in. The film deserves credit for altering a legend, but it gets too carried away too fast and its bulky visuals are more of a burden than anything else.With the depths of The Moors being awfully similar to Pandora in &#34;Avatar,&#34; Aurora's aunts being female versions of The Three Stooges, and a welcomed twist that becomes bittersweet in less than five minutes, &#34;Maleficent&#34; is a failed attempt at reconstructing one of the most evil animated characters of all time.",2,Saturated evil distorted by a plethora of sentimentality,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2826,"['Based', 'Disney', 'animated', '1959', 'classic', '34', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '34', '34', 'Maleficent', '34', 'live-action', 'film', 'told', 'perspective', 'villainous', 'fairy', 'turned', 'demoness', 'film', 'stars', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'title', 'role', 'new', 'spin', 'beloved', 'tale.', '34', 'Maleficent', '34', 'clunky', 'off-balanced', 'right', 'start', 'visuals', 'feeling', 'familiar', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'blend', 'Tim', 'Burton', '34', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '34', '34', 'Great', 'Powerful.', '34', 'film', 'Maleficent', 'child', 'fairy', 'not', 'only', 'horns', 'also', 'horned', 'feathered', 'wings', 'fall', 'love', 'boy', 'named', 'Stefan', 'two', 'drift', 'further', 'further', 'apart', 'grow', 'up.Magical', 'creatures', 'live', 'Moors', 'forest', 'filled', 'eccentric', 'magic', 'own', 'Once', 'Maleficent', 'reaches', 'adulthood', 'war', 'out', 'where', 'King', 'attempts', 'destroy', 'anything', 'living', 'Moors', 'Maleficent', 'King', 'betrayed', 'adult', 'Stefan', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Stefan', 'eventually', 'king', 'daughter', 'named', 'Aurora', 'where', '34', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '34', 'tale', 'play', 'Maleficent', 'wicked', 'curse', 'effect', 'opportunity', 'spend', 'time', 'ill-fated', 'child', '16', 'years', 'later', 'played', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'realize', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'Meanwhile', 'Stefan', 'crazy', 'plotting', 'revenge.Isobelle', 'Molloy', 'who', 'young', 'Maleficent', 'nerve', 'grating', 'role', 'time', 'tripping', 'English', 'accent', 'little', 'make', 'audience', 'actually', 'care', 'character', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'room', 'boast', 'either', 'When', 'Maleficent', 'evil', 'Jolie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'watered', 'down', 'diluted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'anymore', 'Jolie', 'overact', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'up', 'realize', 'something', 'very', 'dear', 'been', 'taken', 'her.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'delightfully', 'wicked', 'relishes', 'cruel', 'behavior', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'fairy', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'origin', 'story', 'eventually', '34', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '34', 'then', 'ventures', 'way', 'course', 'Maleficent', 'character', 'thrown', 'pure', 'darkness', 'film', 'let', 'light', 'back', 'film', 'credit', 'altering', 'legend', 'too', 'carried', 'away', 'too', 'fast', 'bulky', 'visuals', 'are', 'more', 'burden', 'anything', 'else.With', 'depths', 'Moors', 'being', 'awfully', 'similar', 'Pandora', '34', 'Avatar', '34', 'Aurora', 'aunts', 'being', 'female', 'versions', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'welcomed', 'twist', 'bittersweet', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', '34', 'Maleficent', '34', 'failed', 'attempt', 'reconstructing', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'animated', 'characters', 'time']",N/A

Holmes,"[2, 5]","This live-action, mega-budget variation on Sleeping Beauty, told from the perspective of the curse-casting and emerald-flame-conjuring antagonist Maleficent, is far more enchanting and satisfying than I expected.  It transported me.  It excited me.  In a gladly received surprise for a commercial spectacle released in the summer, it even moved me a bit.  Of course, Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is an example of inspired casting.  As she charts the character's transformation from naive romantic to hardened avenger (and subsequent softening), Jolie is transfixing.  She conveys notes of despair, menace, and seduction, often at the same time, and infuses even the simplest lines with a certain macabre grandeur, as if savoring every single malevolent syllable.  Elle Fanning, too, is invaluable as Aurora, the sleeping beauty herself.  With her generous smile and brightly buoyant screen presence, she brings enormous charm, grace, and sensitivity to the role, perfectly complementing Jolie's icily voracious performance in the title role.  As directed by veteran production designer and first-time feature director Robert Stromberg, the film has, I admit, a few bumps and shortcomings.  Despite their considerable combined talent as idiosyncratic character performers, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, and Lesley Manville are overbearing and poorly integrated as a trio of comic-relief fairies, and an extra 15 to 20 minutes (for development of peripheral characters, for general world building) would not be unwelcome in a revisionist fairy tale this swiftly paced at 97 minutes.  Such complaints are small prices to pay, however, for visual euphoria and sublime lead performances, as well as a few intelligent twists and turns which complicate the conventional Mouse House conception of female bonding and the definition of &#34;true love.&#34;",5,Jolie and Fanning are magical; I honestly just wish it were longer,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1846,"['live-action', 'mega-budget', 'variation', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'told', 'perspective', 'curse-casting', 'emerald-flame-conjuring', 'antagonist', 'Maleficent', 'far', 'more', 'enchanting', 'satisfying', 'expected', 'transported', 'excited', 'gladly', 'received', 'surprise', 'commercial', 'spectacle', 'released', 'summer', 'even', 'moved', 'bit', 'course', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Maleficent', 'example', 'inspired', 'casting', 'character', 'transformation', 'naive', 'romantic', 'hardened', 'avenger', 'subsequent', 'softening', 'Jolie', 'transfixing', 'conveys', 'notes', 'despair', 'menace', 'seduction', 'often', 'same', 'time', 'infuses', 'even', 'simplest', 'lines', 'certain', 'macabre', 'grandeur', 'savoring', 'single', 'malevolent', 'syllable', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'too', 'invaluable', 'Aurora', 'sleeping', 'beauty', 'generous', 'smile', 'brightly', 'buoyant', 'screen', 'presence', 'enormous', 'charm', 'grace', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'perfectly', 'complementing', 'Jolie', 'icily', 'voracious', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'directed', 'veteran', 'production', 'designer', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Robert', 'Stromberg', 'film', 'admit', 'few', 'bumps', 'shortcomings', 'considerable', 'combined', 'talent', 'idiosyncratic', 'character', 'performers', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'are', 'overbearing', 'poorly', 'integrated', 'trio', 'comic-relief', 'fairies', 'extra', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'development', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'general', 'world', 'building', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unwelcome', 'revisionist', 'fairy', 'tale', 'swiftly', 'paced', '97', 'minutes', 'Such', 'complaints', 'are', 'small', 'prices', 'pay', 'however', 'visual', 'euphoria', 'sublime', 'lead', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'intelligent', 'twists', 'turns', 'complicate', 'conventional', 'Mouse', 'House', 'conception', 'female', 'bonding', 'definition', '34', 'true', 'love.', '34']",N/A
1567724,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B008JFUSI2,Doug Park,"[3, 4]","{4.5 stars}Angelina Jolie gives an outstanding performance here as adult Maleficent; ditto for Isobelle Molloy as young Maleficent and Ella Purnell as teen Maleficent, a fairy with the body of a cute young girl that matures into a beautiful woman with large, plain, but VERY powerful brown-feathered hawk wings and twisted ram's horns. At an early age, Maleficent makes the mistake of befriending a human boy from the neighboring quasi-English realm who ultimately hurts and betrays her. From there, the story, with many clever deviations and without seven dwarves, follows some of the rough pattern of the fairy tale popularized by the Grimm Bros/Charles Perrault and the earlier Disney movies. Elle Fanning also gives an impressive performance as Aurora (""Snow White"").MALEFICENT strikes just the right balance of fantasy and reality, humor and horror, meaningful storyline and simple entertainment. There are all sorts of reasons to enjoy this film: The unique version of the story itself, the visuals, the character study of the protagonist, you name it. For me, the single best thing about MALEFICENT is its vivid portrayal of the Fairyland Moors, complete with pixies, elves, dryads, naiads, dragons, talking toads, Bokwus-like tree giants, and a host of others, including a were-crow.This is a film without absolutes: No one is completely evil or noble, and no one, no matter how powerful, is invincible. MALEFICENT goes much deeper than the original tale of the handsome prince randomly falling in love at first sight with Sleeping Beauty and awakening her with a kiss from the evil swoon imposed by her horrible wicked fairy godmother. There are all sorts of big themes here: Good versus evil (and there are intermixtures of both in all the major characters), love versus lust, deception, greed, and so on. Many historical parallels can also be seen, the British Empire and American expansion to name just a couple. Yet, all the film's allusions will not get in the way of anyone who just wants to watch it for the rich and surprising ride it gives.Some violent (and entertaining) battle scenes and disturbing images, but no serious gore. There's probably nothing here the average 8-year-old can't handle. Still, MALEFICENT is primarily a fairy tale for adults. Younger children may be confused by who they're supposed to root for, who's supposed to be ""good"" and who's supposed to be ""bad."" ""Good"" characters, after all, generally do not have horns.

1567725,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B008JFUSI2,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","Disney's ""Maleficent"" is an imaginative retelling of the traditional Sleeping Beauty fairy tale, in which the villain takes center stage. Angela Jolie is incredible as Maleficent, a powerful fairy who is betrayed by a human and who takes her revenge, a revenge she will come to regret. Her transformation from innocent to evil to something else again is the thematic core of the movie.Once upon a time, there were adjacent human and fairy kingdoms. A young man named Stefan wanders into the fairy kingdom, where he becomes a close friend of the young Maleficent, the defender of that realm. Their relationship is destroyed when Stefan is tempted by the offer of a kingship to perform an act of unspeakable cruelty on Maleficent. In return, Maleficent will curse the future of now-King Stefan's young daughter Aurora. Oddly, Maleficent chooses to watch over the young Aurora (Elle Fanning), and will be tempted to interfere in her life. The results set up a surprising ending in King Stefan's castle.The movie's special effects are superb. The scene in which Maleficent loses her innocence is heartbreaking. The long and subtle interaction between the young Aurora (played by several actors including one of Jolie's daughters) and the cynical Maleficent is perfectly compelling. The ending sequences are dark, dramatic and violent. This reviewer's one complaint is that the reworking of the story leaves very little in the way of role models for young male viewers. Even the brave prince of the original is reduced to a lightweight passerby.

1567726,A2MEPR41IMURZA,B008JFUSI2,Eric Hutchins,"[8, 20]","Maleficent is a stunningly visual movie with a good and seamless marriage of computer effects and through-the-camera realism. Angelina Jolie is visually stunning, and would be even more so without the cheek bone prosthetics. Although emotionally resonant, the utter sweetness and innocence of both the princess and the handsome, young prince harken to a time in childhood development that ended about 30 years ago.What made the film hollow and spooky for me is two-fold. First, only Maleficent herself is allowed any humanity at all (and she's an imaginary being). Stay with me on this.. and the only pure evil is &#34;greed&#34; and the only people who are greedy are men... white men. Even at the level of fantasy, this is bothersome to me, mostly because of the subliminal nature of the message being sent to young males and, most particularly, to young females. Nobody changes with time, nobody repents, nobody finds grace but the fairy who ventured across the (racial) barrier between the fairies and the humans (and the near-racial divide between males and females).Second, like her name, Maleficent (malevolent + benevolent), this character is not evil, she is confused and irresolute. She has been wronged and, in response, she goes &#34;off the reservation&#34; for a time. She's good, then she's bad, then she's misunderstood, then she's good again, redeemed by the only real form of true love a sixteen-year-old can know, the unconditional love of another woman. This is a superficial and morally muddled tale that leads nowhere good.My only question is, &#34;How conscious is Hollywood of the values and messages it packs into what it feeds us?&#34; Is this an intentional plot to confuse children and youth (already well down that path), or is it Hollywood simply being the unwitting mirror (and agent) of our society's already slow-motion, system-wide collapse? I honestly can't tell. Perhaps its both.

1567727,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUSI2,FNDNreview,"[1, 4]","The tale of Sleeping Beauty is a timeless classic.  For the last 55 years, children have grown up admiring the romance and elegance of the Walt Disney animated feature, which tells the story of a newborn girl that is cursed by a wicked fairy godmother.  That particular fairy godmother is the infamous villain, Maleficent &#8211; who is as important a character to Disney lore as other popular individuals, such Snow White, Ariel, or Cinderella.  And, while Maleficent is presented as a villain in Sleeping Beauty, try to imagine how the same series of events would unfold if they were told from her point of view.Robert Stromberg makes his directorial debut with Maleficent, starring Angelina Jolie as the powerful fairy, Maleficent.  As a young girl, Maleficent befriend a peasant boy, Stefan, with whom she would remain close and eventually fall in love.  However, Stefan uses her feeling against her and deviously strips her of her precious wings &#8211; an action that earned him the right to be the future king.  Naturally, Maleficent feels betrayed and becomes reclusive, bitter, and vengeful.Later, Maleficent learns from her shape-shifting servant, Diaval (Sam Riley), King Stefan (Sharlto Coply) and his queen are having a christening for their newborn daughter, Princess Aurora.  Fueled by resentment for the king, Maleficent decides to attend the gathering, and imposes a curse on Aurora that will put her into eternal sleep on her sixteenth birthday (after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel).  The only way Aurora will ever awaken is by receiving true love&#8217;s kiss (which Maleficent believes doesn&#8217;t exist).To protect his daughter, King Stefan enlists three fairy godmothers to raise Aurora and protect her until the day after her sixteenth birthday.  Maleficent, though hateful at first, closely watches Aurora (Elle Fanning) as she grows older, and becomes regretful for cursing the young princess.  Surprisingly, Maleficent and Aurora become friends &#8211; and as Aurora&#8217;s sixteenth birthday approaches, Maleficent discovers the curse cannot be reversed or removed.  So, with hopes of breaking the curse, Maleficent attempts to use a young, love-struck boy &#8211; named Phillip (Brenton Thwaites), to remove it.The idea to give Maleficent her own film, re-imagining the classic Sleeping Beauty story from her point of view, is an act of pure genius.  Unfortunately, the execution of the idea is done in such a poorly constructed manner that you can&#8217;t help but wish upon a star that this film were created using a pre-determined PG-13 rating.  Instead, this production is left in entertainment limbo, full of enough violence and scary imagery that it&#8217;s not ideally suitable for children.  At the same time, it&#8217;s so tastelessly bland that it has the potential to easily bore adults, using cheesy dialogue, under-whelming visual effects, and mostly dainty acting.On the plus side, Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role of Maleficent.  Her creepy black outfit is striking, as is her bright lipstick and commanding demeanor.  Jolie is a domineering female presence in the majority of her roles, and she carries this floundering film gracefully, without a single dramatic misstep on her end.  She fully embraces Maleficent&#8217;s harsh reputation, which was obviously cemented in stone long ago.  Still, after years and years of watching an emotionally-driven Sleeping Beauty fairy tale, it&#8217;s understandable if you (like me) have a certain degree of difficulty receiving Maleficent as a protagonist instead of an antagonist.Keeping with Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s theme of true love, Maleficent is given an origin story that strives to morph her into a sympathetic character instead of the ruthless villain we&#8217;ve all come to know and love (or hate).  Sure, the actions behind her fifty plus years of villainy is somewhat more understandable and justified &#8211; as it paints her as a Grinch-like individual rather than a merciless sorceress.  Regardless, it&#8217;s hard to fathom young children buying into a movie where the villain is thrust into an anti-hero state-of-mind.  Get ready, folks, Disney could shamelessly make a film like this for every single Disney villain in the future &#8211; and make boatloads of cash doing so.Even though the premise of the movie is honorable and Jolie plays her role well, the pluses are overshadowed by the clunky plot progression and unemotional state of affairs.  As usual, a story is only as believable as its villain &#8211; and in this case, King Stefan is weak in every aspect.  He spends far too much of his time brooding, and basically shows zero interest in spending time with his daughter.  Instead of winning villain of the year, he easily takes home the award for worst parent in a Disney movie.  Speaking of bad parenting, Aurora&#8217;s fairy godmothers (who look visually horrendous after their CGI treatment) might as well be The Three Stooges.Overall, Maleficent was an ambitious idea that had an endless amount of potential &#8211; but, in the end, tries too hard to cater to young children (who really don&#8217;t necessarily need to be subjected to this re-branding effort, anyway).  Despite its good intentions, Disney did little more than take a well-known fairytale and shift it around to appear fresh and updated.  The film is briefly entertaining at times, though only when Angelina Jolie is acting as a villain and conjuring up her green, mystical powers.  But, the more she acts like a lovable hero, the more this film lags in the storyline department.  Maleficent would have been more enjoyable had it simply received the live-action treatment and stayed true to the original plot &#8211; thus maintaining its primary focus instead of looking like a compressed version of Lord of the Rings meets Jack the Giant Slayer.GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",3,Disney attempts to rewrite histroy in 'Maleficent',1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,5877,"['tale',

1567728,A28C7103WO6CPD,B008JFUSI2,Fuinnimh,"[1, 2]","I must admit I was looking forward to this movie with more anticipation than I have felt in a long time. What sold me was how visually stunning Angelina Jolie looked in the trailer, the essential ambiguity of the character, and that it would be an entirely different take on a classic story. With a name like Maleficent you know she's got to be bad, and when Angelina Jolie is good she's very good. When she's bad she's better.And the movie based peripherally on the Perrault fairy-tale, fulfilled it's promise for me and develops the story of a character from the previous Disney movie. Yes I could gape at Angelina for two hours and be quite happy but I wanted more. I did not want the tale of sleeping beauty retold but I did want a great story, a great visual experience, and Disney delivered all three, and a rather complex character who is both good and bad, at times the hero, at times the victim, the destroyer and savior.As a young girl she leads an idyllic life in a visually beautiful and not quite real world, not quite an animated world. She meets a young boy and falls in love. The boy is a thief, and ambitious, she a fairy from the wrong side of the moors, he an overreaching boy who lives close to the castle. They come from different worlds. He from a world that threatens her world. She knows all this and loves him anyway. He is her first human experience and her first love experience. Yes she has hair-horns, but she is a good girl, and she has wonderful powerful wings and can soar to the heavens, like an angel. She also has unusually large cheekbones which only add to her mystique.An ambitious King threatens to invade her land, and she uses her magical powers to thwart them. Then something terrible happens which would destroy most people let alone a fairy, and she seeks what you know of as her revenge on an innocent baby. There is no moral equivalence between what happened and what she does which is simply awful. But then fairy tales are all about the dark side, and this is where we understand but do not agree that she uses her power for a dark purpose.Still we have hope for her that although the girl she once was is lost, that there may be redemption for her, and that redemption may inhabit the form of an innocent onto whom she wrongly displaced the emotion of hate, but she has cast an unbreakable and fatal spell which can only be slightly changed by a good fairy. Will her character come full circle and she become good again, or will she be forever damaged. Can the tragic spell be broken? Can the broken girl be fixed?We have an interesting character, a raven which she saves, who she transforms into a human form, which is quite interesting. The one thing I thought did not work very well was the comic relief provided by the fairies. Perhaps Maleficent should have cast a spell and actually made them funny, but visually the movie was a treat. I particularly liked a bit where she flew out through a window, I though it was an iconic image.It's very clear that much care and thought has gone into the movie as visual art. The look of Maleficent is perfect, the story is great, the look of fairyland is great and I have a sneaking suspicion that with the success of this movie which did a mind boggling $70 million on its opening weekend, we will have more of a mixture of hero villain characters reflecting the full human duality flying to a theater near you.I really enjoyed this movie and am so tempted to go back and see it in 3D. After watching reboots of Spider Man, Superman, Robocop and Xmen recently it's refreshing to see something this fresh and invigorating, and with some star power.Whether this is suitable for children I cannot say, someone aged 8 and above would probably be fine, but some younger children could find it scary. It certainly appealed to me as an adult.If you decide to see it I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,Maleficent is magnificent,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,3908,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'more', 'anticipation', 'have', 'felt', 'long', 'time', 'What', 'sold', 'was', 'how', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'looked', 'trailer', 'essential', 'ambiguity', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'different', 'take', 'classic', 'story', 'name', 'Maleficent', 'know', 'got', 'be', 'bad', 'when', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'When', 'bad', 'movie', 'based', 'peripherally', 'Perrault', 'fairy-tale', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'story', 'character', 'previous', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Yes', 'could', 'gape', 'Angelina', 'two', 'hours', 'be', 'quite', 'happy', 'wanted', 'more', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'tale', 'sleeping', 'beauty', 'retold', 'did', 'want', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'visual', 'experience', 'Disney', 'delivered', 'three', 'rather', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'hero', 'times', 'victim', 'destroyer', 'savior.As', 'young', 'girl', 'idyllic', 'life', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'not', 'quite', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'quite', 'animated', 'world', 'young', 'boy', 'love', 'boy', 'thief', 'ambitious', 'fairy', 'wrong', 'side', 'moors', 'overreaching', 'boy', 'who', 'close', 'castle', 'come', 'different', 'worlds', 'world', 'world', 'anyway', 'first', 'human', 'experience', 'first', 'love', 'experience', 'Yes', 'hair-horns', 'good', 'girl', 'wonderful', 'powerful', 'wings', 'can', 'soar', 'heavens', 'angel', 'also', 'unusually', 'large', 'cheekbones', 'only', 'mystique.An', 'ambitious', 'King', 'invade', 'land', 'magical', 'powers', 'thwart', 'Then', 'something', 'terrible', 'happens', 'would', 'destroy', 'most', 'people', 'let', 'alone', 'fairy', 'what', 'know', 'revenge', 'innocent', 'baby', 'moral', 'equivalence', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'simply', 'awful', 'then', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'dark', 'side', 'where', 'understand', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'power', 'dark', 'purpose.Still', 'have', 'hope', 'girl', 'once', 'was', 'lost', 'may', 'be', 'redemption', 'redemption', 'may', 'inhabit', 'form', 'innocent', 'onto', 'whom', 'wrongly', 'displaced', 'emotion', 'hate', 'cast', 'unbreakable', 'fatal', 'spell', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'slightly', 'changed', 'good', 'fairy', 'Will', 'character', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'become', 'good', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'damaged', 'Can', 'tragic', 'spell', 'be', 'broken', 'Can', 'broken', 'girl', 'be', 'fixed', 'have', 'interesting', 'character', 'raven', 'who', 'human', 'form', 'quite', 'interesting', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'fairies', 'Perhaps', 'Maleficent', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'spell', 'actually', 'made', 'funny', 'visually', 'movie', 'was', 'treat', 'particularly', 'liked', 'bit', 'where', 'flew', 'out', 'window', 'was', 'iconic', 'image.It', 'very', 'clear', 'much', 'care', 'thought', 'gone', 'movie', 'visual', 'art', 'look', 'Maleficent', 'perfect', 'story', 'great', 'look', 'fairyland', 'great', 'have', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'success', 'movie', 'did', 'mind', 'boggling', '70', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'mixture', 'hero', 'villain', 'characters', 'reflecting', 'full', 'human', 'duality', 'flying', 'theater', 'you.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'tempted', 'go', 'back', 'see', '3D', 'watching', 'reboots', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Superman', 'Robocop', 'Xmen', 'recently', 'refreshing', 'see', 'something', 'fresh', 'invigorating', 'star', 'power.Whether', 'suitable', 'children', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'someone', 'aged', '8', 'above', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'fine', 'younger', 'children', 'could', 'find', 'scary', 'certainly', 'appealed', 'adult.If', 'decide', 'see', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

I loved that we learned why maleficent became an evil fairy, and I loved the christening sequence where the curse was casted. The script was almost word for word from the animated version.And then the story takes a turn. I can accept that Maleficent had a change of heart towards Aurora. However, I really missed the excitement of the rescue of prince Philip from Maleficent's dungeons by the three good fairies, and the escape of the prince across the moores and the forest of thorns, followed by the intense battle with the dragon. These scenes could have been so exciting with live action and CGI, that it was anti-climactic to see the bland ending in the forest without the grand finale in the ballroom, and the tender reunion of Aurora with both her parents.This original ending would have made this live action version a true masterpiece.The production was excellent, including the musical score, and 3D cinematography.

I'm sorry, but they just ruined the character. She is the mistress of all evil, not some misunderstood hero. I don't care if they want to make some lame statement about how she is &#34;both the hero and the villain.&#34; That was just a cop-out.Yes, I am perfectly aware that Disney's 1959's &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; is not the original &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; story. However, that is where we all know and love Maleficent from, is it not? So when they -Disney- promise us a backstory of what made her evil, I expect a backstory of what made her evil... based on THEIR original story. Not a completely fabricated plot making her completely and totally good, at the expense of King Stephen. Yeah, she was &#34;evil&#34; for a while, but not really. Just bitter. They did the exact same thing they did in &#34;Wicked,&#34; which incidentally I hated. Elphaba wasn't bad. She had no motive for going after Dorothy; in fact she forgave her for ACCIDENTALLY killing her sister. They were only able to make her so ridiculously good by making the good Wizard the bad guy... with no motive. Now, we have Maleficent being the good one and King Stephan bad. At least he has somewhat of a motive: he wants to live in the castle. Great motive! Being female, I'm a bit of a feminist. But this is dumb.Anyone who has studied acting (or psychology) knows that there is always a reason behind what people do. You cannot play a bad guy successfully unless you figure out the motive, otherwise the audience will hate you. Sometimes it doesn't matter, but sometimes the bad guy is the protagonist. A bad guy can be loveable. Dexter, for example (at least the first couple seasons). When you have the motivation, you can sympathize. Make them the good guy, and you defeat the whole purpose of understanding them.This movie was also a CGI-fest. The three fairies looked fake. (And was there a reason they changed their names and made them imbeciles?) They looked like heads on top of animated bodies. Were their heads even real? Was there a reason Angelina Jolie was the only human-looking creature in the entire Moors? That tells me either they invented 12 new computer things just for this movie and wanted to show off, or they didn't want to pay more actors. The fight scenes were ridiculously elaborate. The scenery, however, was very pretty.I am giving this a full 3 stars only because Angelina Jolie did such a fabulous job bringing Maleficent to life.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[0, 1]","Maleficent marks the directorial debut for Robert Stromberg that re-tells the origins of Maleficent, the infamous Disney villainess of Sleeping Beauty. Maleficent was once a faerie, powerful and strong, living in the magical Moors outside the human kingdom. But, when she is betrayed by Stefan, a boy she met as a child who grew up to be corrupt and power-hungry, Maleficent vows revenge by placing a curse upon his child Aurora.Maleficent retells the story of Maleficent's history and reasons for being evil by not just making the story about her, but by changing specific details that ultimately make this a reboot for a completely new Disney franchise. The directing is superb, especially for an up-and-coming director; the dark tone definitely helped shape the film's atmosphere and story. The script was good, but the film should have been significantly longer (preferably the original 132 minute runtime that was talked about before post-production was completed). The acting from the supporting cast ranged from bearable to good, mainly Sharlto Copley's Stefan being the best support, the crazed and merciless king, but it is Angelina Jolie's Maleficent that's not just wonderful and brilliant, but haunting and emotionally charged, which should get her Oscar and Globe nominations. James Newton Howard's musical score was a huge factor in helping bring this fantastical world to life, as much so as the visual effects.Maleficent isn't necessarily as kid-friendly as it's PG rating advertises (the battle sequences are something out of Lord of the Rings), but it does the character of Maleficent justice, and even though the classic Disney universe will never be the same (it's even noted in the film), Maleficent is a well-deserved addition that breaths new air into the fantasy genre.

1567737,A3BK4862BVLQ1S,B008JFUSI2,J. Daniel Spratlin,"[2, 6]",What&#8217;s it about?Disney steals the concept of Wicked by telling the story of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of the villain Maleficent.What did I think?Definitely not for kids and with a story not strong enough for most adults it&#8217;s unclear who the target audience for Maleficent really is. Die-hard Disney and Angelina Jolie fans will certainly flock to it but the many faults balance out the majesty of the effects and performances. The failure to commit to making Maleficent actually evil really robs the movie of any gravitas as does the bizarre decision to make the three &#8216;good fairies&#8217; bumbling idiots. An adversarial relationship there alone would have strengthened a film sadly lacking real backbone.Jolie &#8211; a performer I don&#8217;t really like or usually enjoy &#8211; is incredible but you're so sympathetic to her throughout the movie that the original premise is almost pointless. When you shrug at someone putting a curse on an innocent baby then perhaps it&#8217;s evidence debutant director Robert Stromberg has missed the mark.

Unfortunately, the movie itself was not very interesting to me. It starts off with a narration of the events that lead up to the situation where Sleeping Beauty (Aurora) was cursed to sleep until kissed by her true love. Maleficent was born a fairy in the magical woods outside of the human kingdom. As a child, she was of a pure nature with no malice toward anyone or anything. One day, a human boy was found hiding in the magical woods and Maleficent rescued him before the magical trees killed him. They eventually bonded but it was not a relationship that would last.

Hollywood has(especially as of late) found a creative way to get moviegoers money by taking our favorite fairy tales and turning them into above average movies.  And now, Disney has decided to create a film based on the lady of evil herself, Maleficent.In the beginning, Maleficent is merely a child. And much to everyone's surprise, she is not evil; at least not yet anyway. Soon she meets a boy Stefan, and they become friends. Many years pass and after an sudden betrayal and the birth of a child known to us as Aurora, Maleficent shows us exactly why hell indeed hath no fury like a woman scorned.I love Angelina Jolie. I absolutely mean it. And in an effort to not sound like some overly obsessed fanboy, she was beyond excellent in her portrayal as the character. I had no idea she would do as good as she did in her role. Her Maleficent can be funny, witty, tragic, and yes she CAN definitely be wicked. This is her movie and she definitely leads the way. Ellie Fanning(from the movie Super 8) plays Princess Aurora. I was not as impressed with her performance as Jolie's but I was able to overlook it due to the fact that the movie is called Maleficent. Sharlto Copley portrays Stefan and does extremely well with his performance. Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, and Leslie Manville bring laughter and delight playing fairies: Knottgrass, Thistlewit and Flittle. And Sam Riley was great as Diaval, Maleficent's right hand er- winged friend.The special effects and designs are a reason why I will be buying the blu ray 3d version of this movie.  Every scene, and every set is beautifully choreographed. And I was equally impressed with how the story itself progressed.So what did I not like about Maleficent? Well despite Elle Fanning's somewhat lackluster performance, there is nothing I would consider bad.  It is rated PG, so while it may not appeal to everyone, I rate it9/10Rated PGCinderella March 13, 2016",5,"An Outstanding performance by Jolie, makes for another good time at the movies",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,1994,"['Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'Etc', 'Hollywood', 'especially', 'late', 'found', 'creative', 'way', 'get', 'moviegoers', 'money', 'taking', 'favorite', 'fairy', 'tales', 'turning', 'above', 'average', 'movies', 'now', 'Disney', 'decided', 'create', 'film', 'based', 'lady', 'evil', 'herself', 'Maleficent.In', 'beginning', 'Maleficent', 'merely', 'child', 'much', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'not', 'evil', 'least', 'not', 'yet', 'anyway', 'Soon', 'boy', 'Stefan', 'become', 'friends', 'Many', 'years', 'pass', 'sudden', 'betrayal', 'birth', 'child', 'known', 'Aurora', 'Maleficent', 'exactly', 'why', 'hell', 'indeed', 'hath', 'fury', 'woman', 'scorned.I', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'absolutely', 'mean', 'effort', 'not', 'sound', 'overly', 'obsessed', 'fanboy', 'was', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'character', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'do', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'role', 'Maleficent', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'witty', 'tragic', 'yes', 'CAN', 'definitely', 'be', 'wicked', 'movie', 'definitely', 'way', 'Ellie', 'Fanning', 'movie', 'Super', '8', 'plays', 'Princess', 'Aurora', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'performance', 'Jolie', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'called', 'Maleficent', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Stefan', 'extremely', 'well', 'performance', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Leslie', 'Manville', 'bring', 'laughter', 'delight', 'playing', 'fairies', 'Knottgrass', 'Thistlewit', 'Flittle', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'was', 'great', 'Diaval', 'Maleficent', 'right', 'hand', 'er-', 'winged', 'friend.The', 'special', 'effects', 'designs', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', '3d', 'version', 'movie', 'scene', 'set', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'was', 'equally', 'impressed', 'how', 'story', 'progressed.So', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'Maleficent', 'Well', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'nothing', 'would', 'consider', 'bad', 'rated', 'PG', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'rate', 'it9/10Rated', 'PGCinderella', 'March', '13', '2016']",N/A
1567740,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B008JFUSI2,Kathy W,"[24, 28]","This movie was absolutely fantastic and a &#34;must see&#34; in my opinion.  Realize, it is not a child's movie.  I give it a 5 star plus, plus, plus.  The movie was magnificent in story line, acting, and computer graphic imaging (CGI).  Although it follows the basic Disney storyline that we saw as children, it has a few slightly different twists as it takes a full 360 degree approach.  It is a storyline that is about both Malificent (M) and Aurora (A) (aka Sleeping Beauty).The movie begins with M. as a young girl, a fairy, to be precise.  She is pretty, precious, sweet and loved by all.  So...what happened to turn her into a meanie?  That's what this storyline explains.  You get to see what hardened her heart to cause her to curse baby A.  Whether you agree or not, you will understand why M. was so terribly hurt and angry.  You will also learn that M. has human feelings beyond her awesome magical powers, feelings just like you and I.  Angelina Jolie was super A + + + in her role as M.; I don't think anyone could have done a better job.  The CGI was fantastic, and the 3D added even more to an already awesome movie.  The story had strong embedded messages about the evils of hatred and the power of love.  The ending was also wonderful!  This movie was a winner all around and I am anxious to watch it again.  I will buy the video when it becomes available but I might actually even go back to the theater soon to see it there again.  It was that good.Parents with Children:I certainly do not intend to tell anyone what to do, but my suggestion is to avoid taking children under about age 8 to see this movie until you see it first.  Although you did not see anything really gross, the movie did contain some violence (battles and fighting), comments such as &#34;bring me her head&#34;, and the concept of putting a curse on a young child so she would go to sleep and not wake up.  Additionally, M. is thought of as a witch-type figue.  Although we tend to think our children are so smart they understand everything, young children look at things differently than their seasoned parents.  Your child may have nightmares for years and you not even know it.",5,Magnificent Malificent !!!,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2173,"['movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', '34', 'must', 'see', '34', 'opinion', 'Realize', 'not', 'child', 'movie', 'give', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'magnificent', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'computer', 'graphic', 'imaging', 'CGI', 'basic', 'Disney', 'storyline', 'saw', 'children', 'few', 'slightly', 'different', 'twists', 'full', '360', 'degree', 'approach', 'storyline', 'Malificent', 'M', 'Aurora', 'A', 'aka', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '.The', 'movie', 'M.', 'young', 'girl', 'fairy', 'be', 'precise', 'pretty', 'precious', 'sweet', 'loved', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'turn', 'meanie', 'what', 'storyline', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'hardened', 'heart', 'cause', 'curse', 'baby', 'A', 'Whether', 'agree', 'not', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'M.', 'was', 'so', 'terribly', 'hurt', 'angry', 'will', 'also', 'learn', 'M.', 'human', 'feelings', 'awesome', 'magical', 'powers', 'feelings', 'just', 'I.', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'super', 'A', '+', '+', '+', 'role', 'M.', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'CGI', 'was', 'fantastic', '3D', 'added', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'awesome', 'movie', 'story', 'had', 'strong', 'embedded', 'messages', 'evils', 'hatred', 'power', 'love', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'was', 'winner', 'am', 'anxious', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'buy', 'video', 'when', 'available', 'might', 'actually', 'even', 'go', 'back', 'theater', 'soon', 'see', 'there', 'again', 'was', 'good.Parents', 'Children', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'tell', 'anyone', 'what', 'do', 'suggestion', 'avoid', 'taking', 'children', 'age', '8', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'really', 'gross', 'movie', 'did', 'contain', 'violence', 'battles', 'fighting', 'comments', 'such', '34', 'bring', 'head', '34', 'concept', 'putting', 'curse', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'go', 'sleep', 'not', 'wake', 'up', 'Additionally', 'M.', 'thought', 'witch-type', 'figue', 'tend', 'think', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'smart', 'understand', 'everything', 'young', 'children', 'look', 'things', 'differently', 'seasoned', 'parents', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'nightmares', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'know']",N/A

Whether or not you accept the black queen's eventual acceptance of &#34;true love&#34; (and her gradual change as the film nears its climax) will depend upon your own politics at this point concerning what people define as &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; in the world today--there is no question that Disney has softened things here but, as Roger Ebert was good enough to remind the TV heads watching him long ago, great fiction is about change, and the way that Linda Woolverton (and her un-credited co-authors) have instigated this change is quite interesting to watch. The negative reviews that you are reading elsewhere are probably from the short attention span crew and you shouldn't expect them to like this story; also, as for the film being only aimed at young girls, this is a fallacy of high inaccuracy because Jolie is stunning for both male and female viewers to look at. Although there has obviously been post-production changes (apparently designed at the eleventh hour), these changes have probably aided an already impatient audience's tolerance-capacity of handling this classic-looking film (and I think that the CGI world contained here is nothing short of perfect--that's right, I said it). Hopefully, the upcoming DVD and Blu-Ray releases will contain the deleted scenes that today'smovie-goers were not patient enough to receive.What really counts in &#34;Maleficent&#34;, however, is not the reinvention of a classic fairy tale or its wicked antagonist, but the visual look of the film itself. Jolie's face is a perfectly carved presence of angelic quality, and her makeup and costume elevate the level of a character who is both faced with a will for vengeance and a pull towards grace. The look of this world--with all of its fairy characters who turn up in unusual places and in unusual ways--make the film part of a cinematic journey that we have not experienced before (so what if the three fairy godmothers were annoying?). While more should have been done to examine the moral conflicts of Maleficent's interior self, there is only so much that can be crammed into a feature film of this sort, and what we are left with is fantastic.As for the 3-D theatrical presentation, there appeared to more depth than there was in &#34;Godzilla&#34;, and I actually enjoyed the way that the images seemed to leap out of the screen in the first twenty minutes.

1567743,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B008JFUSI2,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[1, 4]","Yes, I am a classic and modern day fan of the Disney Animated films. The concept of a live action version of one the most evil and menacingly drawn characters in history, such as Maleficent, was really something I was looking forward to. Walt Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; fell short in many ways for me &#8211; but really shines for Angelina.Robert Stromberg held the reigns of directorship on this project and coming from a visual effects supervisor background, makes his directorial debut with this film. &#8220;Maleficent&#8221;, with the screenplay written by Linda Wolverton (Alice In Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast) from the original Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm brothers tales and loosely from the adaption of the original animated film by Erdman Penner (and six others)&#8211; is a film takes a very long start to get to the meat of the story and then rides fairly smoothly.Let me explain what I enjoyed most. Angelina Jolie (Changeling, Salt). Watching her as the innocent and caring fairy in the beginning and then her subtle but powerful glares, smirks and smiles she conveys evil and a heartwarming concern to such perfection that you cannot help but be engaged every moment she is on screen. She is beautiful and dark and inviting and terrifying all at the same time. Her range for the characters is sedate and strong yet so charge with life and energy you will find it very easy to relate to why she became the way she did.Elle Fanning (Super 8, We Bought A Zoo) plays Aurora with a soft but non-threatening demeanor. Almost as if she is not afraid of anything and unrealistically accepting of everything around her. If fact, the first third of the movie is her as a baby and growing up to be sixteen which overall, was very slow and dull &#8211; minus the wonderful visual effects of course.Sharlto Copley (Elysium, District 9) is playing Stefan. He is the reason Maleficent becomes who she is known as and why she seems to be bitter and angry toward everything. His performance is rather scattered as he fools Maleficent into thinking one thing with the goal of proving himself worthy of his dying fathers throne. Then he snaps and goes crazy apparently for no reason &#8211; it was just a strange switch in attitude for me to understand why he eventually does what he does.I did enjoy the three helpful fairies who were hysterical and played by Lesley Manville (Another Year, Secrets & Lies) as Flittle; Imelda Staunton (Harry Potter, Chicken Run) as Knotgrass and Juno Temple (The Dark Knight Rises, Atonement)  as Thistlewit. They have some Three-Stooges style of humor among them and it is funny and charming.Another nice performance came from Sam Riley (Control, On The Road) as Diaval who was once a black raven but is used as Maleficent&#8217;s eyes and ears when something happens to her. (No spoilers here!) Sam was smart with his reactions and honest with his expressions after having been rescued by her. He surprisingly teaches her a level of tolerance and patience. Sam and Angelina had great chemistry together on screen as well.Also, sweet, short and full of innocence, Brenton Thwaites (Oculus, The Signal) who plays Prince Phillip and is very heart-warming to watch. He and Elle look great together on screen, but unfortunately the screenplay didn&#8217;t give them much time together and when they were, it was rather non interactive and long drawn.I also enjoyed the amazing visuals. The creatures, both animal and plant were visually stunning and beautiful. Not many of them had a purpose it seemed or a function but they seemed to all live together well. This is a nice large scale movie and has some notable, if not very good, performances, but it just seemed to drag on in several places. &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; is really Angelina&#8217;s movie and I wish she was given more to do, but the finale with a dragon and a few other surprises does make it an interesting film &#8211; if you can wait that long to actually get there.

1567744,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008JFUSI2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[13, 15]","Both me and my 13 years old daughter we liked this film A LOT, even if there are some weaker spots (and I still like the original Disney film more). Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.As the title indicates, this film focuses on Maleficent rather than on Sleeping Beauty and tells her story from the very beginning, when she was still a kid and later a teen-ager (in those scenes she is played successively by 13 years old Isobelle Molloy and 17 years old Ella Purnell). Therefore, in the first minute of the film we learn that once upon a time there were two kingdoms, one human and one fairy, neither of them very big and also that they were neighbours, but hardly ever friends.From the very beginning it is clear that there is some history and quite a lot of bad blood between those two realms, as humans are extremely unwelcome in the fairy kingdom - and also that there is an old territorial dispute, because there are ruins of a powerful human fortress, without question brought down with great violence, on what is presently fairy territory...The human kingdom is ruled by old King Henry. On another hand the fairy country doesn't have a real ruler, but even as a child Maleficent seems to be considered as a dominant figure of authority, mostly (I believe) because she is an exceptionally powerful spell-caster. This is not said in the film, but the fact that she was born with those splendid horns (she is the only one with such a proud display) may have predestined her to a role of fairies leader - if ever there is need for such a person... She is also without question the fastest flyer amongst the fairies, thanks to her powerful magic wings.But one day, when she is still a child, Maleficent meets for the first time in her life a human - a young boy named Stefan, who sneaked into fairy territory to try to steal anything precious he can find. Caught by fairy warriors and warned strongly by Maleficent to never try to do it again, he is then led to the border and released. But this is not the end of the whole thing, because as all females (no matter what age) Maleficent is impossibly curious - and therefore she will want to meet this peculiar human creature again. And again. And again. And this is when this film really begins, and I will not say more about it...As I already said, I liked this film a lot. Angelina Jolie is not only drop dead gorgeous in this film but she also plays very well. Her character is quite complicated and all the time evolving: she is successively a nave young girl, a maiden surprised by first love, a fierce war leader, a woman HORRIBLY betrayed and wronged, a terrifying vengeance demon - and then, to ours and her own enormous surprise, something yet completely different and unexpected...The scenario is surprisingly solid and strong, mostly coherent and rather logical. The twisted game played with the original Disney version of Sleeping Beauty is a very successful thing and some developments are quite moving and even more beautiful than in the cartoon. There is also some good humour, quite a lot of which will be especially appealing to those viewers who have little children themselves...)))Even if it doesn't affect my five stars rating, there are however some weaker points. Elle Fanning was a HORRIBLE casting choice for Aurora - not only she is very average looking (at best) but she also CANNOT ACT! AT ALL! She is even more horrible as Aurora than Kristen Stewart was as Sleeping Beauty - and that is saying a lot! The three fairy godmothers, who in this film are COMPLETELY  clueless and TERMINALLY incompetent, were supposed to be here a comic element, but as they are totally annoying rather than funny, that element of film mostly doesn't work.  Finally, I believe that the very final solution of long and terrible feud between Stefan and Maleficent went much too far and was a mistake - but I cannot be specific, because it would reveal too much. You will have to see this film and judge by yourself.As there is always a lesson in every fairy tale, here are the main lessons I learned from this film:- any guy who had a shot at spending a lifetime having wild sex with a permanently horny Angelina Jolie and exchanged it against being a mere king, deserves everything and anything bad that happens to him next...)))- clearly there is a rule in the universe that an attractive, intelligent and proud woman will ALWAYS fall for the one guy who is THE WORST @hole around...)))- if you are the leader of a medieval kingdom, with an army of knights and archers, having for neighbour a country which can deploy advanced biological war robots and genetically engineered walking trees with air support, DO NOT go to war- instead of waging war against such a foe, become a pacifist, sign a friendship treaty, develop trade and cultural relations, encourage intermarriage and especially send your young people to study in the neighbouring country; invade and destroy your neighbour only once you have successfully acquired and mastered his superior technology...- even if you are a powerful sorceress, be VERY careful when somebody offers you a drink, especially if this is a sweet speaking guy whom you didn't see like in years and he just came to visit you out of blue, arriving from a hostile country...- if you really had to steal something once to achieve your lifelong dream, returning it to the rightful owner once you don't need it anymore can be a good idea - restitution may not always be enough, but it usually is a good beginning to solve any kind of conflict- when designing a really bad@ss malware, complete with Dolby 5.0 Stereo, cadaver-green lights and other SFX, remember to ALWAYS build-in a backdoor override - if you don't, believe me, you will totally live to regret it...)))- you can be a Prince and a Heir to the royal throne and yet, if you cannot perform in a young lady's bedroom to her satisfaction, you will be violently thrown out without any regards to your rank, with extreme prejudice to your dignity...)))- you can be a very average looking chick completely unable to act and yet, if your big sister is an A-list Hollywood actress you can still secure good parts in major super productions...)))Bottom line, I liked this film A LOT and I am totally going to buy the DVD once it is available, to be able to watch it again with my daughter. Because it is visually splendid, I may even go for the Blu-ray. Try to see it in the theatres, as long as it still plays.

I never watched the original film but I could always remeber seeing a glimpse of Maleficent from somewhere and it always stuck with me. The PG rating for this movie worried me, Disney always had this perfect skill of messing up the original story their movies are based on. However, I tried to be optismitic.If you are expecting this movie to follow the ""vibe"" Maleficent gave in the original film DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.I don't love this film nor do I hate it. The trailers made me think this was going to be action-pack, but it wasn't.What kills me is that they did a complete 180 on Maleficent. She doesn't even turn into a dragon!!!! I wanted her to be evil because she wanted to be, not because she was betrayed by her lover. They ruined the spell, Aurora pricks her finger then dies. Not fall into a ""sleeplike death"". They even made her try to reverse the curse because all of sudden now she cares about Aurora?!The movie was riding Frozen's coattails, the male characters are either completely useless or evil and the whole ""true love"" breaks the curse. Instead of being romantic, it was platonic.The relationship between Aurora and Maleficent is nice, Jolie was good (there were times where she does overact but still she was good), and I love the sense of humor the movie had.",3,This is not your mother's Sleeping Beauty (spoilers).,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,1449,"['So', 'tjhe', 'film', 'Maleficent', 'obviously', 'Maleficent', 'point', 'view', 'when', 'story', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty.Now', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'excited', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'film', 'could', 'always', 'remeber', 'seeing', 'glimpse', 'Maleficent', 'somewhere', 'always', 'stuck', 'PG', 'rating', 'movie', 'worried', 'Disney', 'always', 'had', 'perfect', 'skill', 'messing', 'up', 'original', 'story', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'However', 'tried', 'be', 'optismitic.If', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'follow', 'vibe', 'Maleficent', 'gave', 'original', 'film', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'FILM.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'film', 'do', 'hate', 'trailers', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'action-pack', 'did', 'complete', '180', 'Maleficent', ""n't"", 'even', 'turn', 'dragon', 'wanted', 'be', 'evil', 'wanted', 'be', 'not', 'was', 'betrayed', 'lover', 'ruined', 'spell', 'Aurora', 'finger', 'then', 'Not', 'fall', 'sleeplike', 'death', 'even', 'made', 'try', 'reverse', 'curse', 'sudden', 'now', 'Aurora', 'movie', 'was', 'riding', 'Frozen', 'coattails', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'useless', 'evil', 'whole', 'true', 'love', 'curse', 'Instead', 'being', 'romantic', 'was', 'platonic.The', 'relationship', 'Aurora', 'Maleficent', 'nice', 'Jolie', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'overact', 'still', 'was', 'good', 'love', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'had']",N/A

1567747,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B008JFUSI2,M. Bullions,"[7, 11]","The re-imaginings of classic fairy tales needs to stop. It began with Tim Burton&#8217;s 2010 &#8220;Alice in Wonderland,&#8221; and that went okay. So, &#8220;Snow White & The Huntsman&#8221; had us rooting for the villain as the hero was poorly played by Kristen Stewart, who got the part because she slept with the director. Tim Burton had turned down the chance to direct &#8220;Maleficent,&#8221; a different angle on the story of &#8220;Sleeping Beauty.&#8221; This made me think that the script probably wasn&#8217;t any good, or that a &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; movie would fail. I&#8217;m glad I actually saw the thing.&#34;Maleficent&#34; works for the simple reason of having cast Angelina Jolie. She is a force to be reckoned with as the classic big baddie, who, as it turns out, wasn&#8217;t that bad after all. The film shows Maleficent&#8217;s back-story from childhood, and adds an interesting layer in the Disney canon.This classic villain was basically a woman scorned, who acted as any of us would. She was young and full of love and hope once too, but she was betrayed at a crucial time in her life, and that changed everything for her. It brings me to why no one agrees with me during discussions about books or films. I still believe in the heroes, but I prefer the villains. What I like best is when a character is neither the hero nor the villain, but something in between, like we all are. And I think that&#8217;s what we have in the character study of Maleficent.It&#8217;s obvious Jolie was born to play this role. Her performance hits not a single sour note, and everything about her as Maleficent just feels right. She&#8217;s in almost every scene, so the viewer really has to grow to like this character, and Jolie allows for that to happen. However, her Lady Gaga Born This Way-cheekbones are never quite explained. But, even that looks right.There are a lot of great twists in the story too. A narrator tells us at the beginning, &#8220;this story is not what you thought it was,&#8221; and she was right. There are quite a few clever surprises that really will change the way you look at this classic story. The script had to be quite good, which makes me wonder why Burton didn&#8217;t take on the project.Robert Stormberg, a visual effects guy, has his feature directorial debut in &#8220;Maleficent,&#8221; and he does a splendid job.

Maleficint has been defeating the evil king forever.Her wings make her a force to be reckoned with. The king offers to let someone to be his sucessor if they can find a method to defeat Maleficint. A young man from the kingdom manages to decieve Malificent and steal her wings while she is asleep. He presents the wings to the king. This young man is made the successor. He becomes king. The young king marries and has a daughter named Aurora. Malificent shows up at a celebration honoring Aurora. Maleficent places a curse on Aurora. Aurora willbe permanently asleep on her 16th birthday. She can only be awakened by a kiss from a truelove. Aurora is removed from the castle and placed in the care of three fairies. Secretly Maleficent strikes up a relationship with Aurora. They spend more and more time together. A strong fondness between the two develops. Maleficent uses her magic to protect Aurora. On her 16th birthday the curse comes true. All attempts to awaken her fail.Maleficent sneaks into the castle andkisses Aurora. Aurora awakens. When they are trying to leave the castle a battle. Aurora frees Maleficent's wings. The battle and Maleficent prevails. Thisstory has a definite happy ending.

1567750,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B008JFUSI2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 2]","My family has a special relationship with the character of &#8220;Maleficent.&#8221; My wife has long used the eponymous villain from &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; as an avatar for games and web sites alike.  This was back when Disney villains received little attention and merchandise featuring their likenesses was rare.  As a result, we have virtually everything with Maleficent on it (at least, Maleficent only without Aurora). As Disney has begun to reimagine its vast archive of characters on shows like Once Upon a Time and even the Wicked Witch of the West gets a fair shake in &#8220;Wicked,&#8221; it was perhaps inevitable that Maleficent would get the same treatment. We approached the film with some trepidation.It&#8217;s helpful to understand that &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; is about Maleficent first and foremost.  That means that if something happens in the plot of &#8220;Sleeping Beauty&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t focus on Maleficent (Angelina Jolie), the scriptwriters simply discarded it. The motivation for Maleficent&#8217;s curse was originally about not being invited to the christening of Aurora (played in this film by Elle Fanning), but by the time &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; gets to the same point as the animated film she has quite a bit of baggage to unload in that single curse.In short, Maleficent was violated by a man, King Stefan (Sharlto Copley). Other bloggers have pointed out how this reduces Maleficent to a &#8220;woman scorned&#8221; and that&#8217;s definitely a problem for the film.  Maleficent&#8217;s hatred for Aurora changes over time as she comes to realize she has no beef with the girl; the three fairies charged with protecting her are frighteningly incompetent (at least twice it&#8217;s clear Aurora would have died without Maleficent&#8217;s intervention). In other words, everyone but Maleficent is a moron.There&#8217;s also an addition of her crow Diaval (Sam Riley), who Maleficent turns into other shapes at a whim: wolf, horse, man, or even a dragon.  No special effects budget is spared in this portrayal, which makes all of these forms crow-like.  Along with the faerie realm that Maleficent decides to take over in her vengeance, the CGI is breathtaking.The other problem is that Maleficent never really gets the emotional resolution we hope for.  Her conflict with Stefan isn&#8217;t really about him at all &#8211; it&#8217;s about saving Aurora.  There&#8217;s no dialogue between Maleficent and Stefan that gives us the satisfaction that she's able to moved one.  Jolie seems to play Maleficent so aloof as to make her mostly mute, so we have to settle for smiles and glares to fill in the blanks.In the end, &#8220;Maleficent&#8221;&#8217;s biggest challenge is in being different from other Disney films. The conclusion would be revolutionary if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that &#8220;Frozen&#8221; did it first and better.",3,Pales in comparison to Frozen,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,2889,"['family', 'special', 'relationship', 'character', '8220', 'Maleficent.', '8221', 'My', 'wife', 'long', 'used', 'eponymous', 'villain', '34', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '34', 'avatar', 'games', 'web', 'sites', 'alike', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'Disney', 'received', 'little', 'attention', 'merchandise', 'featuring', 'likenesses', 'was', 'rare', 'result', 'have', 'virtually', 'everything', 'Maleficent', 'least', 'Maleficent', 'only', 'Aurora', 'Disney', 'begun', 'reimagine', 'vast', 'archive', 'characters', 'shows', 'Once', 'Time', 'even', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'fair', 'shake', '8220', 'Wicked', '8221', 'was', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'Maleficent', 'would', 'get', 'same', 'treatment', 'approached', 'film', 'trepidation.It', '8217', 'helpful', 'understand', '8220', 'Maleficent', '8221', 'Maleficent', 'first', 'foremost', 'something', 'plot', '8220', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '8221', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'focus', 'Maleficent', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'scriptwriters', 'simply', 'discarded', 'motivation', 'Maleficent', '8217', 's', 'curse', 'was', 'originally', 'not', 'being', 'invited', 'christening', 'Aurora', 'played', 'film', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'time', '8220', 'Maleficent', '8221', 'same', 'point', 'animated', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'baggage', 'unload', 'single', 'curse.In', 'short', 'Maleficent', 'was', 'violated', 'man', 'King', 'Stefan', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Other', 'bloggers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'Maleficent', '8220', 'woman', 'scorned', '8221', '8217', 's', 'definitely', 'problem', 'film', 'Maleficent', '8217', 'hatred', 'Aurora', 'changes', 'over', 'time', 'realize', 'beef', 'girl', 'three', 'fairies', 'charged', 'protecting', 'are', 'frighteningly', 'incompetent', 'least', 'twice', '8217', 'clear', 'Aurora', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'Maleficent', '8217', 'intervention', 'other', 'words', 'everyone', 'Maleficent', 'moron.There', '8217', 's', 'also', 'addition', 'crow', 'Diaval', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'who', 'Maleficent', 'other', 'shapes', 'whim', 'wolf', 'horse', 'man', 'even', 'dragon', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'spared', 'portrayal', 'forms', 'crow-like', 'faerie', 'realm', 'Maleficent', 'take', 'over', 'vengeance', 'CGI', 'breathtaking.The', 'other', 'problem', 'Maleficent', 'never', 'really', 'emotional', 'resolution', 'hope', 'conflict', 'Stefan', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'really', '8211', '8217', 's', 'saving', 'Aurora', '8217', 'dialogue', 'Maleficent', 'Stefan', 'satisfaction', 'able', 'moved', 'one', 'Jolie', 'play', 'Maleficent', 'so', 'aloof', 'make', 'mostly', 'mute', 'have', 'settle', 'smiles', 'glares', 'fill', 'blanks.In', 'end', '8220', 'Maleficent', '8221', '8217', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'being', 'different', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'conclusion', 'would', 'be', 'revolutionary', '8217', 't', 'fact', '8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'did', 'first', 'better']",N/A

The rest of the cast were not strong and came off as amateurish in comparison to Angelina.  The three &#34;good&#34; fairies were supposed to be amusing but neither the acting or the writing allowed this.  Children will always be amused at adults throwing flour at each other or pulling each other's hair.  But this humor should not carry over to adults.  Most of us have come to expect a little more sophisticated humor from even animated movies (e.g. Shrek).  The special effects were also not particularly special.  Most of it seemed like it could have been in &#34;The Never Ending Story,&#34; a movie 30 years old.  This movie rested upon the emotional transitions of Maleficient.  Fortunately, Angelina has the chops to convey layers of emotion with every part of her face.  So all the attention on her made the movie tolerable for an adult.  Whatever they paid her, she was worth it.  It would have been an embarrassment if her acting resembled the rest of the cast.

Why not just keep her at the castle and then lock her up on her 16th birthday?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be a better idea?  Does this make any sense at all?Well&#8230; and then there is the matter of the king sending the child off with the three fairies to care for her.

1567754,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B008JFUSI2,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[2, 4]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; (USA, 2014)1. As a kid, my all-time favorite classic Disney villain was Maleficent, from &#8220;Sleeping Beauty&#8221;. When I heard about this movie, I was pretty intrigued.2. This movie is a complete reinvention of the fairy tale. Other than a few original elements, this is pretty much a new story.3. It also gets rid of almost everything I liked about the original Maleficent character. Originally, Maleficent was truly malevolent. In this movie, she has a broken heart, which makes her bitter and childish, but not evil.4. As a stand-alone movie, it&#8217;s pretty good - it&#8217;s a simple, imaginative fairy tale. Just don&#8217;t compare it to anything else.5. This is Angelina Jolie&#8217;s movie. All the other actors in the film might as well be cardboard when they are on screen with her. She commands your attention and almost pops off the screen.6. Visually, the movie is beautiful. The special effects are great, and the fairy land called The Moors is mesmerising to watch..7. There is a nice little commentary on the cliche concept of &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; and &#8220;your true love&#8217;s kiss.&#8221; That does make it a little predictable, though; halfway through the movie, I knew who would wake Sleeping Beauty up.8.

Maleficent is about a betrayed fairy (Angelina Jolie) that curses the king's infant daughter Aurora as revenge. She soon discovers that when Aurora grows up, she is the only one who can restore the peace and happiness that everyone needs to get them out of the depression caused by revenge and war. This movie takes &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; and turns it into a completely different movie.By far, this is the best Disney movie I've seen and one of the best movies I&#8217;ve seen in a while. Everything is just right. For example, the music sets the right mood in every scene. It is strong and loud when it needs to be and quite and shy at other times and, at certain points, it is playful and happy. It really pulls the whole movie together. Along with the jaw-dropping music, this movie has amazing actors starting with Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning (Auora). They fit each role perfectly almost as if they were born for these roles.This movie is very interesting to watch because it isn&#8217;t entirely based on &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; so you get to see a completely different side of Maleficent before she becomes the villain that she is known as. Throughout the movie I found myself wanting the movie to go quicker to see what would happen next but not wanting it to end anytime soon. I think that the director Robert Stromberg and the writers Linda Woolverton and Charles Perrault really outdo themselves with this movie because I cannot stop obsessing about how great it is.I give this movie 5 out of 5 perfect stars and recommend it for ages 9 to 18.

One of the best ideas here is how the concept of pure evil or good don't exist.

1567758,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B008JFUSI2,S. Der,"[1, 4]","I have some spoilers in this review.The movie is great, but there are faults in it. I liked the CGI and the characters. I liked the new spin on an old Disney classic. I liked how they made Maleficent the villain as well as the hero! I have never heard or seen such a thing, and I enjoyed it a lot.Now, what I don't like was that you have to be a little kid to go along with some of the things in this movie that wouldn't make sense to a thinking person. You would think that the 3 fairies would look after Aurora better. But instead, they don't and let her wonder around the forest whenever she wants. That means she can go see Maleficent all the time. What the heck? Isn't Aurora supposed to be looked after and be constantly watched over because Maleficent? I thought they believed that Maleficent might hurt her, so they don't want Maleficent to find her, right? That is unbelievable, they let her do that. But, hey, it's Disney, so whatever floods your boat right.Another unbelievable part is towards the end of the movie. Maleficent can just hide in Aurora bedroom behind the dressing fold. Yes, no one can see her because she just that good or those fairies and the prince are really dumb. Then, they all leave the room and now only Maleficent and Aurora are inside. Really? There's no guards inside the room or at the front door. It's Disney, so it's all good right.Then, if you look at the last fight scene with Maleficent using her powers to make a dragon appear. Wow, when you see the dragon gets caught, but not killed? That's unbelievable. If you see a dragon killing all the soldiers there, and you finally capture it, they're not going to kill it? That's just not ridiculous. In any other movie, you would expect them to kill the dragon once caught and not just hold it down for it to do whatever.So, I'm really ify about this movie. One I liked the new telling of this story, but the way it turned out isn't what I expected it to be. I only recommend this movie, if you can really let yourself go and not think about what you're seeing.",3,"I liked it, but you have let yourself be in disbelief to enjoy it because it's Disney.",1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,2051,"['have', 'spoilers', 'review.The', 'movie', 'great', 'are', 'faults', 'liked', 'CGI', 'characters', 'liked', 'new', 'spin', 'old', 'Disney', 'classic', 'liked', 'how', 'made', 'Maleficent', 'villain', 'as', 'well', 'hero', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'seen', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'lot.Now', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'have', 'be', 'little', 'kid', 'go', 'along', 'things', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'thinking', 'person', 'would', 'think', '3', 'fairies', 'would', 'look', 'Aurora', 'better', 'instead', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'wonder', 'forest', 'whenever', 'can', 'go', 'see', 'Maleficent', 'time', 'What', 'heck', ""n't"", 'Aurora', 'supposed', 'be', 'looked', 'be', 'constantly', 'watched', 'Maleficent', 'thought', 'believed', 'Maleficent', 'might', 'hurt', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Maleficent', 'find', 'right', 'unbelievable', 'let', 'do', 'hey', 'Disney', 'so', 'whatever', 'floods', 'boat', 'right.Another', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'end', 'movie', 'Maleficent', 'can', 'just', 'hide', 'Aurora', 'bedroom', 'dressing', 'fold', 'Yes', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'good', 'fairies', 'prince', 'are', 'really', 'dumb', 'Then', 'leave', 'room', 'now', 'only', 'Maleficent', 'Aurora', 'are', 'inside', 'Really', 'guards', 'room', 'front', 'door', 'Disney', 'good', 'right.Then', 'look', 'last', 'fight', 'scene', 'Maleficent', 'using', 'powers', 'make', 'dragon', 'appear', 'Wow', 'when', 'see', 'dragon', 'caught', 'not', 'killed', 'unbelievable', 'see', 'dragon', 'killing', 'soldiers', 'there', 'finally', 'capture', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'kill', 'just', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'kill', 'dragon', 'once', 'caught', 'not', 'just', 'hold', 'down', 'do', 'whatever.So', ""'m"", 'really', 'ify', 'movie', 'One', 'liked', 'new', 'telling', 'story', 'way', 'turned', 'out', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'not', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing']",N/A

This is not the live action prequel to Disney's Sleeping Beauty. It doesn't pretend to be. This is not like Oz the Great and Powerful (which is a prequel but which I still haven't seen).No, Maleficent is the story of Sleeping Beauty told from the perspective of the villain. Sort of. At any rate, it's told from a different perspective than the one that has been presented in popular culture for the last half century and more. I think they did an amazing job.The movie is magnificent to look at. The tree men that serve as the border guards are astounding and the land serpent was... well, that was incredible. Not to mention the work they did on Flittle, Knotgrass, and Thistletwit. And the dragon! Well, I think it's enough to say that the movie looked amazing, but, then, there is also Angeline Jolie who was impeccable in her role. Not that there wasn't makeup to go with that, but I think she almost didn't need any help pulling off the fairy look. Except for the wings. I think it's safe to bet that she doesn't have her own wings.The performances were excellent, especially Jolie. Elle Fanning pulled off exactly the persona of someone who is happy and beautiful all the time. Sharlto Copley was crazy scary... or, maybe, he was scary crazy. One of the two. The three fairies pulled off the same sort of bickering as the fairies in the animated Sleeping Beauty; they were wonderful and hilarious. And Sam Riley was great, too.The only possible issue with the movie is the whole &#34;true love&#34; thing. Disney continues to try to undo its whole cliche around that theme, which is fine and good, but it hasn't even been a year since Frozen, so I hope this is not a new trend, taking the &#34;true love&#34; theme in some other direction every movie for the next... well, who could even guess how long that could go on. Anyway, it was fine for this movie and handled well, but 3/4 of my family reacted in the same way to it: &#34;I hope this isn't going to be their new thing.&#34; I guess we'll just have to wait and see on that one.Overall, this is a great movie. It has everything you could want, none of which I'll name, because that would mean spoilers, even if I did already mention the dragon. But, then, we all knew about the dragon, right? Wait, it doesn't have lightsabers, but I think that's okay. I'll just put it like this: My wife cried. It's almost a certain thing that a movie is good if my wife cries, so there you there.

Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) slips Sleeping Beauty (Elle Fanning) a roofie and allows a Prince (Brenton Thwaites) to kiss on her while she is asleep and still keep it a family film. Add a spinning wheel, a castle, and a fire breathing dragon and you got the basic story.What Disney did was to retell the classic in such a magnificent way as to make you never want to watch the old one again. Maleficent is our horned fairy who is basically good. Both her and the plot develop levels of complexity that is not the norm for a children's film. There is a role reversal as good and evil blur lines until the point we root for those we had desired to fail in the original tale.Jolie was great in a role seemingly made for her. Elle Fanning would not have been my first choice, but she was sufficient, perhaps over shadowed by Jolie. My favorite line was when Jolie said, &#34;I don't want children.&#34; Sure you don't, Angelina.There is an underlying theme that perhaps our enemies aren't so evil once we see the world through their eyes.

For I was the one they called Sleeping Beauty.&#34; Maleficent (Jolie) is a fairy that is loved be everyone in the Moor. When she stops a human from stealing from her land she thinks she has found a friend and her true-love. Little by little he begins to show up less and less. After an unsuccessful attack by the king on Maleficent's forest the King offers to name whoever can take her down as his successor. When he tricks her in order to take the throne Maleficent is bent on revenge, she aims her hatred at the one thing the new King cherishes most, his new daughter, Aurora (Fanning). I'll start with the one question everyone will have, this is not a straight kids movie like Sleeping Beauty was but it is also not as dark and adult as Snow White and the Huntsman. That said I thought it was better then I was expecting but my 11 year old daughter loved it. The only real problem with this movie is the same problem that caused the Star Wars movies to lose some of the magic. Maleficent is arguably the Darth Vader of the Disney Villains, I think of her as the darkest and most powerful of all of them. When the prequels came out and you saw his origin it took some of the mystique away and he no longer had the aura he had before. This one had the same effect, I don't want to give anything away but you will see what I mean when you watch it. Overall, a movie that is geared toward young teens but isn't terrible for adults. I give this a B.",3,This was better then I was expecting but did take something away from the history of her.

1567767,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B008JFUSI2,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[7, 16]","There's a very good reason why Maleficent is Disney's most notorious villain, appearing in video games and other films in all her dastardly glory. The Sleeping Beauty antagonist was straight-up evil and reveled in that wickedness, and along with her obsidian visage, willingness to kill an innocent girl, and ability to transform into a dragon (!!!) she has earned a spot as one incredible animated heel. But Maleficent, billed as a total reimagining of the Sleeping Beauty story, attempts to soften her into just another villain with a secret heart of gold, and in the process they take away what made her interesting in the first place.Disney, who seem to be on a kick of revamping their animated classics into forgettable live-action films, have put their trust in debut director Robert Stromberg, the guy largely responsible for the elaborate, soulless look of Oz the Great and Powerful and Alice in Wonderland. Maleficent suffers from the same sterility brought on by an overabundance of digital effects, bleeding into a story that fails to offer much of a human quality and not nearly enough of Angelina Jolie (and her awesome cheekbones!) vamping it up. That's not to say she isn't terrific because Jolie embodies Maleficent so utterly that it makes the film's deficiencies elsewhere all the more obvious, and those problems begin with the severe deviations from the source material.The Maleficent we are treated to was a happy young fairy, living amongst the magical creatures of the Moors, a lush, natural fantasy land separated from the humans. With her powerful wings, Maleficent soars through the air and is innocent of heart until she encounters Stefan, a young human boy who wandered into the Moors to steal something. She should have taken the hint, but instead Maleficent and Stefan fall in love, enjoying one another's company until he grows older and obsessed with becoming king. In a shocking, too-disturbing-for-kids act of betrayal, Stefan (now played by Sharlto Copley) takes the one thing in the world she loves most so that he can attain the throne.It's at this point when the film briefly settles into normalcy and shines as Maleficent, all angry and literally green with rage, crashes a party at the castle celebrating the birth of Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning). Swatting aside the three nice-but-annoying fairies (Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, Juno Temple), she casts the familiar convoluted curse that would have Aurora pricking her finger on a spindle and falling into an eternal sleep, all by the age of 16. This is Jolie's truest moment to really show her wicked side, and she eats up the opportunity and goes in for a second helping. For a short while Stromberg and screenwriter Linda Woolverton (also of Alice in Wonderland) give the film a jolt of life that sadly goes missing the instant this scene draws to a close in a puff of green smoke.From that point on it becomes abundantly clear that Disney never thought beyond the &#34;let's make a Maleficent movie&#34; stage because they fail to give the character a clear motivation. Aurora, now a teenager living with her three bumbling fairy guardians (Why are they morons, anyway?) is never given a personality to speak of. All we see of her is through the incompetence of her caretakers, and when they prove unable to watch over her it is Maleficent who, for reasons unknown, becomes her watchful fairy godmother. As Stefan sinks into a paranoid haze, Aurora and Maleficent are off bonding and playing with weird creatures, but really there is nothing of value going on for the entire second act.  Little effort is made to show us what is going on inside the heads of either Maleficent or Aurora, confusing for a film that seems to exist largely to be a source of empowerment to young women. To that end the male characters, specifically the handsome Prince Philip (Brenton Thwaites), are refashioned entirely or shifted into the background. Sam Riley is decent comic relief as Maleficent's shape-changing raven, Dieval, and more than any other has a real connection with Jolie.Maleficent marks a wasted opportunity by Disney and Stromberg to present a truly devilish take on an old favorite. Jolie brings the fire and her formidable aura to the role but Maleficent's wings are clipped by a script that never offers a clear path for the character to take. Even if that path is one of pure wicked evil it would have been preferable to being dull and misunderstood.",2,"Jolie is Fantastic, but Maleficent Dull and Misguided",1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,4454,"['very', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Maleficent', 'Disney', 'most', 'notorious', 'villain', 'appearing', 'video', 'games', 'other', 'films', 'dastardly', 'glory', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'antagonist', 'was', 'straight-up', 'evil', 'reveled', 'wickedness', 'obsidian', 'visage', 'willingness', 'kill', 'innocent', 'girl', 'ability', 'transform', 'dragon', 'earned', 'spot', 'one', 'incredible', 'animated', 'heel', 'Maleficent', 'billed', 'total', 'reimagining', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'story', 'attempts', 'soften', 'just', 'villain', 'secret', 'heart', 'gold', 'process', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'made', 'interesting', 'first', 'place.Disney', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'kick', 'revamping', 'animated', 'classics', 'forgettable', 'live-action', 'films', 'have', 'put', 'trust', 'debut', 'director', 'Robert', 'Stromberg', 'guy', 'largely', 'responsible', 'elaborate', 'soulless', 'look', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Maleficent', 'suffers', 'same', 'sterility', 'brought', 'overabundance', 'digital', 'effects', 'bleeding', 'story', 'offer', 'much', 'human', 'quality', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'awesome', 'cheekbones', 'vamping', 'up', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'terrific', 'Jolie', 'embodies', 'Maleficent', 'so', 'utterly', 'film', 'deficiencies', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'obvious', 'problems', 'begin', 'severe', 'deviations', 'source', 'material.The', 'Maleficent', 'are', 'treated', 'was', 'happy', 'young', 'fairy', 'living', 'amongst', 'magical', 'creatures', 'Moors', 'lush', 'natural', 'fantasy', 'land', 'separated', 'humans', 'powerful', 'wings', 'Maleficent', 'air', 'innocent', 'heart', 'Stefan', 'young', 'human', 'boy', 'who', 'wandered', 'Moors', 'steal', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'hint', 'instead', 'Maleficent', 'Stefan', 'fall', 'love', 'enjoying', 'one', 'company', 'older', 'obsessed', 'becoming', 'king', 'shocking', 'too-disturbing-for-kids', 'act', 'betrayal', 'Stefan', 'now', 'played', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'one', 'thing', 'world', 'most', 'so', 'can', 'attain', 'throne.It', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'briefly', 'normalcy', 'shines', 'Maleficent', 'angry', 'literally', 'green', 'rage', 'party', 'castle', 'celebrating', 'birth', 'Princess', 'Aurora', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Swatting', 'three', 'nice-but-annoying', 'fairies', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'familiar', 'convoluted', 'curse', 'would', 'have', 'Aurora', 'pricking', 'finger', 'spindle', 'falling', 'eternal', 'sleep', 'age', '16', 'Jolie', 'truest', 'moment', 'really', 'show', 'wicked', 'side', 'up', 'opportunity', 'second', 'helping', 'short', 'while', 'Stromberg', 'screenwriter', 'Linda', 'Woolverton', 'also', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'give', 'film', 'jolt', 'life', 'sadly', 'missing', 'instant', 'scene', 'close', 'puff', 'green', 'smoke.From', 'point', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Disney', 'never', 'thought', '34', 'let', 'make', 'Maleficent', 'movie', '34', 'stage', 'fail', 'give', 'character', 'clear', 'motivation', 'Aurora', 'now', 'teenager', 'living', 'three', 'bumbling', 'fairy', 'guardians', 'Why', 'are', 'morons', 'anyway', 'never', 'given', 'personality', 'speak', 'see', 'incompetence', 'caretakers', 'when', 'prove', 'unable', 'watch', 'Maleficent', 'who', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'watchful', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Stefan', 'sinks', 'paranoid', 'haze', 'Aurora', 'Maleficent', 'are', 'bonding', 'playing', 'weird', 'creatures', 'really', 'nothing', 'value', 'going', 'entire', 'second', 'act', 'Little', 'effort', 'made', 'show', 'going', 'heads', 'Maleficent', 'Aurora', 'confusing', 'film', 'exist', 'largely', 'be', 'source', 'empowerment', 'young', 'women', 'end', 'male', 'characters', 'specifically', 'handsome', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Brenton', 'Thwaites', 'are', 'refashioned', 'entirely', 'shifted', 'background', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'decent', 'comic', 'relief', 'Maleficent', 'shape-changing', 'raven', 'Dieval', 'more', 'other', 'real', 'connection', 'Jolie.Maleficent', 'marks', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'Disney', 'Stromberg', 'present', 'truly', 'devilish', 'take', 'old', 'favorite', 'Jolie', 'fire', 'formidable', 'aura', 'role', 'Maleficent', 'wings', 'are', 'clipped', 'script', 'never', 'clear', 'path', 'character', 'take', 'Even', 'path', 'one', 'pure', 'wicked', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'being', 'dull', 'misunderstood']",N/A
