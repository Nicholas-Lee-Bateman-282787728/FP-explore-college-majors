These are, of course, centered on the trip that the Barone family makes to Italy.  So funny and delightful!  The rest of the episodes tow the line between being brilliant and poignant.  For example, Robert (Brad Garrett) has a hard break-up with his on-again, off-again girlfriend and takes up with Stefania (Alex Meneses), a girl he meets in Italy, as well as meeting other Ms. Wrong's along the way.  Poor Robert.  You want to hug him for being pitiful, and you want to strangle him for being so mopey.  Of course, we also get a sense of the strain in the relationship between Raymond (Ray Romano) and Debra (Patricia Heaton), and their forgiveness and reconciliation that takes place, after their explosive exchanges.

The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.Season 5 includes a two-part episode taking the entire Barone clan to Italy; a flashback of Ally's birth; and more squabbles about the childhood and adolescent wackiness that both Ray and Robert claim messed them up for life!If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out!

I was hooked and watched it until the end of its run, catching the earlier episodes when it entered syndication the next year. (Yes there was a time when this show wasn't in syndication.) The season starts off with the two part ""Italy"" message episode (Ray slowly learns to appreciate life in Italy). It's a nice change of pace for the series, but feels forced. The only thing that happens in Italy relevant to the rest of the series is Robert's meeting of a beautiful woman named Stefania who makes him question whether he should stick with his girlfriend Amy.This situation is further exploited to serve as the premise of the episodes ""Meant to be"" and ""Stephania Arrives""Writer Tucker Cawley began to hit his stride this season and began to write some good but overrated episodes (The walk to the door, Silent partners, Ally's birth) I say overrated because if you analyze the episodes he wrote from this season forward, he uses the same plot device over and over again: Ray or Robert does or says something dumb that Debra, Amy, or both way overreact to and a huge argument ensues, which is usually smoothed over at the end. The arguing only got worse in season six, and I believe Cawley is partially to blame.Classic episodes from this season include ""Humm Vac"", ""Christmas Present"", ""Fighting In-Laws"", and ""The Canister""Forgettable episodes include ""The Sneeze"" ""What Good Are You?"", ""Fairies"", and ""Net Worth"", where Ray invests money in the go-cart craze.",5,Season five,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1583,"['fifth', 'season', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'first', 'year', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'watched', 'end', 'run', 'catching', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'when', 'entered', 'syndication', 'next', 'year', 'Yes', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'syndication', 'season', 'two', 'part', 'Italy', 'message', 'episode', 'Ray', 'slowly', 'appreciate', 'life', 'Italy', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'series', 'feels', 'forced', 'only', 'thing', 'Italy', 'relevant', 'rest', 'series', 'Robert', 'meeting', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Stefania', 'who', 'question', 'should', 'stick', 'girlfriend', 'Amy.This', 'situation', 'further', 'exploited', 'serve', 'premise', 'episodes', 'Meant', 'be', 'Stephania', 'Arrives', 'Writer', 'Tucker', 'Cawley', 'began', 'hit', 'stride', 'season', 'began', 'write', 'good', 'overrated', 'episodes', 'walk', 'door', 'Silent', 'partners', 'Ally', 'birth', 'say', 'overrated', 'because', 'analyze', 'episodes', 'wrote', 'season', 'forward', 'same', 'plot', 'device', 'over', 'again', 'Ray', 'Robert', 'something', 'dumb', 'Debra', 'Amy', 'way', 'overreact', 'huge', 'argument', 'ensues', 'usually', 'smoothed', 'end', 'arguing', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'season', 'six', 'believe', 'Cawley', 'partially', 'blame.Classic', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'Humm', 'Vac', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'Fighting', 'In-Laws', 'Canister', 'Forgettable', 'episodes', 'include', 'Sneeze', 'What', 'Good', 'Are', 'Fairies', 'Net', 'Worth', 'where', 'Ray', 'money', 'go-cart', 'craze']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 5

They have indeed been released in a very timely manner, and we are already over the halfway mark with the number of season sets that have come out in the series.Season 5 delivers the same funny and genuine episodes you are used to seeing from this series. The two-part season opener ""Italy"" delivers a notably different atmosphere and plot than fans are used to, and I have found that people either loved it or hated it, but after that the show returns to its usual self. The classic ""Wallpaper"" episode is just hilarious, and I was also personally partial to the season finale ""Ally's Birth,"" where Ray reminisced about the crazy ""Barone style"" events surrounding Debra's pregnancy with their first child. Also notable are the the two-part season opener ""Italy,"" which has a significantly more sensitive plot that may not suit some fans but is still worth watching; ""Super Bowl,"" where Ray takes drastic measures to prove he loves Debra more than his Super Bowl tickets; and of course, ""The Canister,"" which chronicles one of the most hilarious Debra/Marie conflicts in the show's 9-year run. (This episode was also among the most popular ""fan favorites"" and is a real keeper!)There isn't really a large number of special features on these sets, although the audio commentaries are very consistent and nice to have. I am glad that Patricia Heaton has also joined in on a couple of them on Seasons 4 and 5. The only thing I would like to see more of is the cast members talking about the Barone kids. Madylin, Sawyer, and Sullivan Sweeten were obviously not a huge part of the show at all, but Phil Rosenthal, Ray Romano, and Patricia Heaton don't talk about them at all in the commentaries, and it would be nice to see how these actors related to them and gain more insight on the relationship that they shared while working on the show.

In reviewing the other episodes, this season may be my favorite of ELR.  There are so many highlights including the famous ""Wallpaper"" episode where Ray's parents drive through their house.  My other favorites include ""The Author,"" ""The Walk to the Door,"" ""The Sneeze,"" ""What Good Are You?"" (my favorite of this season--it is just hilarious), ""Fairies,"" ""Humm Vac,"" and ""The Canister.""  Extras include deleted scenes (on the DVD with the corresponding episodes which is nicer than all of them on the 5th DVD) and a few commentaries on selected episodes.  The subtitles sometimes come up when I start a new episode but, going to the title menu and selecting ""Language,"" I can turn off the subtitles and can resume the episode where it left off.Disc 1:""Italy Parts 1 & 2""--Marie treats her family to a trip to Italy.  Raymond is in the dumps until the end of the trip and Robert meets Stefania who will make future appearances.""Wallpaper""--One of the more famous episodes.  Marie and Frank back their car through Raymond and Debra's house.  When the contractors repair the wall and the wallpaper does not quite match, Raymond goes ballistic.  Raymond's reaction seems out-of-character but Debra recognizes it's an explosion over many issues.  Nothing really is resolved here but I don't think Raymond is ever pushed this far again.""Meant to Be""--Robert decides to settle down with Amy and thinks it's a good idea to tell her about his flings with Stefania and ex-wife Joanna.  Joanna makes an appearance (yuck).""Pet Cemetery""--Raymond leaves Ally's hamster's cage open and it goes in the freezer and freezes to death.  Raymond learns something about Ally at the funeral.Disc 2:""The Author""--Raymond isn't too excited about Robert being promoted to lieutenant because his publisher just rejected his book.  This is the episode where they fight in their mom's living room with ""bugles.""""The Walk to the Door""--Raymond and his family go to a wedding.  In attendance is a woman Raymond dated one time in high school and he obsesses over not walking her to her door.  Debra is angry that Raymond doesn't regret inconsiderate things he does to her so he comes up with an example of his regret in typical Raymond fashion--he steals it.""Young Girl""--Robert is dating a 22 year old and Marie and Debra get pushed out of shape.""Fighting In-Laws""--Debra's parents visit for Thanksgiving and, after Debra gives Ray the usual speech about how normal her family is compared to his, Ray overhears them talking about seeing a marriage counselor.""The Sneeze""--Raymond is sneezed on at the airport and is paranoid he's caught something.  Debra suspects Ray's mother is enabling his illness.  Very funny one.Disc 3:""Christmas Present""--Raymond and Robert try to figure out the best Christmas present to give Debra so she'll let them go on a golfing excursion.""What Good Are You?""--Raymond does nothing (as usual) while Debra is choking and he starts to think he can't be counted on in an emergency.  Hilarious!  Especially the splinter scene.""Super Bowl""--Raymond gets two tickets to the Super Bowl and decides to take Gianni which angers Robert, Frank and, believe it or not, even Debra.  It's painful to watch what Debra guilt-trips Raymond into doing to the tickets near the end of this episode.""Ray's Journal""--Ray's mad when he finds out his mother would read his journal when he was a kid but his mother is mad at him for a hurtful entry.""Silent Partners""--Debra is worried when she and Ray go out to eat and have nothing to say to each other.Disc 4:""Fairies""--Frank does not like his grandsons playing fairies in the school play and Raymond starts to see things his way.  Very funny.""Stefania""--Robert's girlfriend from Italy arrives and he's bothered by her poking him all the time.  Meanwhile, Stefania's father decides to buy Nemo's.""Humm Vac""--Raymond buys Debra a Rainbow knockoff super vacuum and Debra thinks she can prove to Marie that she's not the perfect housecleaner. ""This is what we call the `wow factor.'""""The Canister""--Debra is mad because Marie keeps insisting she never returned her canister.  Frank actually does a good deed here.""Net Worth""--Debra gets mad (is there a pattern here?) at Raymond because he gave his buddies $1,000 for a Go-Kart investment and told her it was HIS money.  I like when she takes all the sheets off the bed including the mattress cover (very thorough).Disc 5:""Let's Fix Robert""--Stefania and Amy meet and discuss all the faults in their ex-boyfriend Robert.""Say Uncle""--Raymond is worried that his kids are becoming closer to Robert than to him.""Separation""--Debra finds out her parents are ""on the path to divorce"" and Raymond isn't very sympathetic.""Frank Paints the House""--Frank is furious when Raymond fires him from painting his house.  I don't care for this episode that much because Frank gets so emotional plus he is totally wrong.  Yellow fades more quickly than almost any exterior color and it does not cover well.""Ally' Birth""--Raymond takes Ally to a father-daughter dance and thinks back to when Debra was pregnant with her.

Good family fun for the most part (except the constant begging for sex which gets old more than it is offensive). The father figure should be a little more stand up but we live in a women dominated world where men are usually emasculated like this. The main characters is sometimes such a lazy stupid loser that I don't see how anyone would marry him. But I think this is done for comedy. But overall it is funny and reruns are just as fun. I think whoever wrote the mother-in-law role was very spot on. She is the perfect hater lover like such people can most of the time be.The one mix up that keeps happening is that the writers forget where the characters live.

I will review just some of the best episodes of this still improving show. Frank Paints was classic grouchy Frank being his dictatorial self. The dynamic triad relationship between father and sons is one many will relate to.Disliking the ridicule while wanting approval is something we all have done. But, the Barones have that extra argue gene that keeps us all laughing. Young girl was another winner. A true Mars vs. Venus onslaught of laughs. Male viewers relate to the men. As in Frank saying ""hot damn."" Females relate to the angst of a man they know dating someone half his age. Patricia Heaton was so good in her temper tantrum you thought she was going to have an anyeurism. Net Worth, another war between the sexes. Parents and brother chime in and Ray's goose is cooked. As if he ever had a chance? Seperation, Ray laughs after Debra tells him her parents have seperated. No surprise giving he is a goof. Funny histrionics throughout this one. Wallpaper may have been the best episode of the season.F&M; back their car into Ray and Debra's house. You can imagine it happening, but until it did you would not have believed it. Marie shows that she is just as clueless as Ray. Is it in the genes? The first half of this one brought out the nuances of all 5 characters at their dysfunctional BEST. Chicken Ray, jealous Robert, innocent Marie-""this is all your fathers fault."" Mind numbingly selfish-cheap Frank, and apoplectic Debra. Did Patricia Heaton get hypertension doing this role?
