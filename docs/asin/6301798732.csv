If they only needed 90 minutes to tell a story, then by gum that's all they filmed.Is clever dialogue a lost art? The story is the story, but why not make some folks witty? You try to be witty in real life, and movie viewers appreciate it on the big screen.You know the formula, of course, but so what? Steinbeck, Hitchcock, and every actor loaded with talent.

They are a diverse group that will provide dramatic tension. The last survivor is from the U-boat, which creates a discussion on his acceptance. One political question is: who is to steer the boat? Should the technically qualified U-boat skipper do it, or should the politically qualified crewman do it? The survivors make the right decision. Another question is whether a leg should be sacrificed to save a life (the lesser evil). The operation takes place and succeeds through the skill of the U-boat skipper. The recurring question is whether they are on the right course (a symbol of politics?). But a storm blows them off course (nature and events upsets their plans).They lack food and water, but appear mot to suffer. Their talk about restaurants symbolizes their hunger. Their small talk reflects their backgrounds, and their differences. But Smith goes overboard, and the angry crew sends the skipper after him. Now they seem hopeless. But Connie chooses to use her diamond bracelet as a fishing lure, and they catch a fish (wealth to serve the people?)! The sighting of a ship causes the loss of the lure. At first it appears the enemy supply shop will rescue them. But a distant warship shells and sinks the supply ship. The film ends with the rescue of another enemy seaman.

268439,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6301798732,A. Gammill,"[3, 3]","Lifeboat is something of an anomaly among the films of Alfred Hitchcock.  It was the only film he made for 20th Century Fox (more on that in a minute).  It's not usually counted among the director's best works, possibly because many of the themes common to his more popular efforts (such as the ""wrong man"" thrillers likeNorth By NorthwestorThe 39 Steps (Criterion Collection Spine #56)) are absent from film.The basic premise, a group of disparate strangers is stranded on a lifeboast after their ship is torpedoed by a Nazi sub, is deceptively simple.  Through some clever plotting and typical Hitchcock ingenuity behind the camera, a tense tale unfolds which confounds expectations by offering up some real suspense and more than a few surprises.  I won't spoil the specifics for those who haven't seen it yet, but suffice it to say that not all is as it seems aboard the seemingly doomed vessel.  And if 96 minutes of nine people on a boat seems boring, there are a handful of visually shocking scenes that stave off any complacency the viewer might feel.In addition to the film, there are a couple of bonus features of special interest to fans of Hithcock.  A brief featurette offers insight into the film's production.  As with previous Hitch DVD releases, his daughter Pat offers first-hand accounts of the film's production.  Hitchcock scholar and professor Drew Casper offers an expert commentary track as well.  Best bit: Tempramental star Tallulah Bankhead apparently rarely wore underwear on the set, and was not the least bit shy around the other actors and crew (oddly enough, Casper fails to address this in the scene where Bankhead is clearly not wearing a bra, her right nipple visible through her wet blouse).  We also learn that Hitchcock refused to make any more films at Fox after the studio got cold feet when promoting the film, due to early (and preposterous) allegations that the film might generate sympathy for the Nazis due to its treatment of the lone German character aboard the boat.Lifeboat certainly belongs in any Hitchcock fan's collection.  I would also recommended it for anyone who enjoys WWII films; while not a typical war picture, it is clearly a product of that time.",5,Very engaging and too often overlooked classic,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2209,"['Lifeboat', 'something', 'anomaly', 'films', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'made', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'more', 'minute', 'not', 'usually', 'counted', 'director', 'best', 'works', 'possibly', 'many', 'themes', 'common', 'more', 'popular', 'efforts', 'such', 'wrong', 'man', 'thrillers', 'likeNorth', 'NorthwestorThe', '39', 'Steps', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Spine', '56', 'are', 'absent', 'film.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'group', 'disparate', 'strangers', 'stranded', 'lifeboast', 'ship', 'torpedoed', 'Nazi', 'sub', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'clever', 'plotting', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'ingenuity', 'camera', 'tense', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'confounds', 'expectations', 'offering', 'up', 'real', 'suspense', 'more', 'few', 'surprises', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'specifics', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'say', 'not', 'seemingly', 'doomed', 'vessel', '96', 'minutes', 'nine', 'people', 'boat', 'boring', 'are', 'handful', 'visually', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'stave', 'off', 'complacency', 'viewer', 'might', 'feel.In', 'addition', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'bonus', 'features', 'special', 'interest', 'fans', 'Hithcock', 'brief', 'featurette', 'offers', 'insight', 'film', 'production', 'previous', 'Hitch', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'film', 'production', 'Hitchcock', 'scholar', 'professor', 'Drew', 'Casper', 'expert', 'commentary', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'bit', 'Tempramental', 'star', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'apparently', 'rarely', 'wore', 'underwear', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'shy', 'other', 'actors', 'crew', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Casper', 'address', 'scene', 'where', 'Bankhead', 'clearly', 'not', 'wearing', 'bra', 'right', 'nipple', 'visible', 'wet', 'blouse', 'also', 'learn', 'Hitchcock', 'refused', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'Fox', 'studio', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'when', 'promoting', 'film', 'due', 'early', 'preposterous', 'allegations', 'film', 'might', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'Nazis', 'due', 'treatment', 'lone', 'German', 'character', 'boat.Lifeboat', 'certainly', 'Hitchcock', 'fan', 'collection', 'would', 'also', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'WWII', 'films', 'not', 'typical', 'war', 'picture', 'clearly', 'product', 'time']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

268442,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301798732,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","When you think of Alfred Hitchcock, you think of murder, mystery, mayhem and cross-dressing serial killers.  Let&#8217;s just be honest here.  When you think of Hitchcock and his movies you think of the obvious horror classics that he is famous for, but there are a string of really successful dramas Hitchcock directed in the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s that deserve more consideration and attention.  In fact, I find some of his less renowned fare to be his best work, period.&#8216;Notorious&#8217;, &#8216;Rope&#8217;, &#8216;The Man Who Knew too Much&#8217; and this brilliant film, &#8216;Lifeboat&#8217;.&#8216;Lifeboat&#8217; centers on a group of relative strangers who are stranded on a lifeboat after the ship they were traveling on was attacked by the Germans and sunk.  There are eight of them, but soon they are joined by a ninth, a German soldier who isn&#8217;t trusted by all but gains the trust of a few.  He throws a wrench in their unit and they soon start to disagree and bicker, and when one of their members begins to get terminally ill, their reliance on their enemy becomes a questionable affair.The greatest thing about &#8216;Lifeboat&#8217; is that it manages to truly knick away at all of these human beings, finding their faults and illuminating their decisions in a light that allows us, the audience, to fully grasp the seriousness of their destitution.  The fear, the will to survive, the need to love, the wanton desire to trust; all of it comes together on the screen in a marvelous array of scenes designed to keep us glued.  Despite taking place entirely on a small boat, there is such movement here, such breath.  You can feel the expanse in every scene thanks to Hitchcock&#8217;s focused direction.  The performances are also uniformly spectacular, with Tallulah Bankhead delivering an Oscar caliber performance as Connie, a journalist detached from humanity and consumed in herself only to have the ordeal at sea set her eyes straight on reality.  William Bendix, as the wounded Gus, and Walter Slezak, as the German soldier, are also VERY good here.This is not what you may think of when you hear the name Hitchcock, but this is yet further proof that Hitchcock was one of the greatest film directors of his or any generation.  He understood humans so well that he was able to extract tension and fear out of the most humane of surroundings.  He didn&#8217;t need a murder (although a few take place) and he didn&#8217;t need a mystery to find his niche.  He continued to expand his own horizons and create memorable experiences time and again.",5,One of the finest films you&#8217;ve never heard of&#8230;,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2584,"['When', 'think', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'think', 'murder', 'mystery', 'mayhem', 'cross-dressing', 'serial', 'killers', 'Let', '8217', 's', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'When', 'think', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'think', 'obvious', 'horror', 'classics', 'famous', 'are', 'string', 'really', 'successful', 'dramas', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', '40', '8217', 's', '50', '8217', 'more', 'consideration', 'attention', 'fact', 'find', 'less', 'renowned', 'fare', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'period.', '8216', 'Notorious', '8217', '8216', 'Rope', '8217', '8216', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'too', 'Much', '8217', 'brilliant', 'film', '8216', 'Lifeboat', '8217', '8216', 'Lifeboat', '8217', 'centers', 'group', 'relative', 'strangers', 'who', 'are', 'stranded', 'lifeboat', 'ship', 'were', 'traveling', 'was', 'attacked', 'Germans', 'sunk', 'are', 'eight', 'soon', 'are', 'joined', 'ninth', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'isn', '8217', 'trusted', 'gains', 'trust', 'few', 'wrench', 'unit', 'soon', 'start', 'disagree', 'bicker', 'when', 'one', 'members', 'get', 'terminally', 'ill', 'reliance', 'enemy', 'questionable', 'affair.The', 'greatest', 'thing', '8216', 'Lifeboat', '8217', 'truly', 'knick', 'away', 'human', 'beings', 'finding', 'faults', 'illuminating', 'decisions', 'light', 'audience', 'fully', 'grasp', 'seriousness', 'destitution', 'fear', 'will', 'survive', 'need', 'love', 'wanton', 'desire', 'trust', 'together', 'screen', 'marvelous', 'array', 'scenes', 'designed', 'keep', 'glued', 'taking', 'place', 'entirely', 'small', 'boat', 'such', 'movement', 'here', 'such', 'breath', 'can', 'feel', 'expanse', 'scene', 'thanks', 'Hitchcock', '8217', 's', 'focused', 'direction', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'uniformly', 'spectacular', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'delivering', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'Connie', 'journalist', 'detached', 'humanity', 'consumed', 'only', 'have', 'ordeal', 'sea', 'set', 'eyes', 'straight', 'reality', 'William', 'Bendix', 'wounded', 'Gus', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'German', 'soldier', 'are', 'also', 'VERY', 'good', 'here.This', 'not', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'when', 'hear', 'name', 'Hitchcock', 'yet', 'further', 'proof', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'directors', 'generation', 'understood', 'humans', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'able', 'extract', 'tension', 'fear', 'most', 'humane', 'surroundings', '8217', 'need', 'murder', 'few', 'take', 'place', '8217', 'need', 'mystery', 'find', 'niche', 'continued', 'expand', 'own', 'horizons', 'create', 'memorable', 'experiences', 'time', 'again']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

Of course, to make things interesting, a German has to be on the lifeboat with other American and English survivors. Then, to push the envelope further, the German has to be the bad guy, just to reinforce the point. Things are made worse with the sight of Tallulah Bankhead, who comes off looking like a cheap floozy with a mink coat on. As the days pass by for the characters stuck on the lifeboat, everybody still looks good. Nobody is sunburned. Nobody, except for one, is dehydrated. Nobody is starving.

But is sunk  by a German U-boat and in the opening scenes there is Tallulah Bankhead in  a lifeboat all by herself with all of her belongings.

Shot in monochrome adds to the hopeless feel.It is WWII and a ship is torpedoed and its lifeboats are shot at. Before they went down they dispatched the dastardly U-Boat.Now an only remaining Lifeboat is being loaded one at a time with a self-centered female journalist (Tallulah Bankhead), a boisterous businessman (Henry Hull), the radio ship's operator, a timid nurse, a ship's steward, a wounded sailor (William Bendix), and an overbearing engineer. We do not stop here the next to be pulled aboard does not speak English (Walter Slezak.)As with all mixed people movies we slowly earn about everyone's background and a few secrets. As they start picking on each other we see that the only stable person seems to be the U-Boat passenger they picked up. If it were not for him people would have dies and or got lost.

268451,ACC1SLND21RI6,6301798732,Breyel,"[5, 5]","It's an old adage, but with a different twist in the case of ""Lifeboat"". World War II enemies destroy each other's ships. A Nazi U-boat Captain (Walter Slezak) is rescued by eight survivors on an Allied lifeboat who form a microcosm of American/British society. They befriend the Captain, albeit with some suspicion, only to eventually discover they had every reason to mistrust him. Such is the premise of John Steinbeck's novella ""Lifeboat"", which Alfred Hitchcock then ingeniously adapted for film.Imagine a U-boat Captain who has a friendly and helpful demeanour, yet ruthlessly plots his own survival. Is this not the stuff of a genuine adversary? He never reveals the compass he keeps in his possession, thus guiding the lifeboat towards a Nazi supply ship. He goads and pushes injured merchant seaman Gus (William Bendix) overboard while fellow passengers are sleeping, particularly crewman Sparks (Hume Cronyn). He pretends at first to understand only German, when in fact he speaks at least three languages; only an attractive journalist (Talullah Bankhead) is conversant in either language. And he hides food tablets and water from the others. Is this not the worst kind of enemy?Odd as it may seem, influential critics in 1944 failed to equate the treachery of the U-boat Captain as symbolic of Nazi ideology. Although it received three Academy award nominations, ""Lifeboat"" was subsequently panned as too soft on Nazism. So reviled was the film, it was banished into virtual obscurity. When it was eventually released on VHS, only a damaged master tape was available. In time an unblemished master was found and used for this DVD issue.Equally fantastic is the fact that it was filmed in a huge pool set up on a stage. Yet, surprisingly it has the look and feel as though it took place out at sea. Even more amazing is how Hitchcock sustained the suspense for 96 minutes.In addition to this great film, the DVD contains interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter who share their recollections. Steinbeck and Hitchcock scholars add their input into the origin of the story and making of the film. And advertisements, theatrical posters and newspaper articles of the film are likewise included on the DVD.If you've not seen this Hitchcock film, get it.

268452,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,6301798732,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[8, 17]","Yes, this is a well-made film which is filmed superbly well, but the message driving the film is overbearing.  The scene: Chance brings these shipwrecked folks together on this Lifeboat. The players in this character study courtesy of John Steinbeck, by way of Hitchcock, include: a former crook trying to go straight, a girl who soon goes overboard once her baby dies, a seemingly useless rich industrialist, a simple regular quiet guy, an apprehensive nurse-gal, a superbly dressed lady (even on the lifeboat) who is a reporter, a German sailor, and 2 working class guys. Of the latter one concerns himself thinking of his girl back home while the other comes across as a pseudo-intellectual pretender. Ignoring the supporting cast, we are left with 3 points of interest herein: Kovac, the pretender; Connie, the society reporter (very ably portrayed by Tallulah Bankhead); and Willy, the wily Nazi whiz who seems skilled in everything. Sounds dull, doesn't it? Oh, pardon me. I'm forgetting the spice to liven up this water-borne play. Connie provides this by verbally pegging Kovac as a ""fellow traveler"", later calling him (albeit sarcastically) ""tovarich."" Definitions: ""fellow travelers"" were folks who supported & sympathized with Communism, without being card-carrying party members; and ""tovarich"" is Russian for comrade. Thus it becomes political; a triangular treatment of the Nazis, Stalin's USSR, and the monkey in the middle ""West""---ie., a materialistic well-off lady; one who, moreover, actually interprets between the two. Story details: thanks to Kovac's stubborn anti-German antagonism he is able to bully the others into trusting him over the German, who argues that Kovac's ""course"" will lead them further away from land. Kovac doesn't know anything about sailing, but thanks to his ""gut"" inclination assumes he is in the right. After the German earns their trust by saving the other working-class guy's life, Kovac relents on pursuing his course; and begins passing the time playing high-stakes cards with the rich industrialist. How he is able to possibly cover the sums he is wagering, however, is ignored. I'm going to own one of your factories when we're done, he even tells the rich man. (And we are supposed to believe that this millionaire would gamble large sums with a working-class guy with no apparent assets?) Then later we find out that, actually, Kovac was right about what course to take (after it was too late) and that the German had duped them. Moral: never trust a Nazi & give the benefit of the doubt to ""the Left."" Even Connie, in the end, falls for Kovac; his brawn (he goes topless the entire film) and his evincing leadership being apparently enough for her. No, I'm not calling Hitchcock a leftist. Moreover, I think he is generally brilliant---""The 39 Steps"" is one of my all-time favorite films; ""To Catch a Thief"" & ""Vertigo"" are also superb. I'm just saying that the script (by Steinbeck, a rumored ""fellow traveler"" himself) betrays a simplistic dichotomy---the idea the Left wishes all to believe exists between ""progressiveness"", as evinced by the Left and Fascism. Remember this film was made in 1944; when Stalin's Soviet Union was an ally; when the Soviet Union's economic system was still thought worthy of emulating by some. Even if you think me nuts, do reserve judgment & at least consider the points made herein next time you chance to see this film. Then decide.

It stars the fabulous Tallulah Bankhead with a superb ensemble cast; the story of a group of survivors from a bombed freighter, fighting for their very survival in a flimsy lifeboat.As the film opens, we see the freighter's smoking chimney stack sinking beneath the waves, miscellaneous floating debris, a pack of cards and a chessboard.  The lone occupant of the lifeboat is revealed as Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), an acerbic globe-trotting reporter, casually smoking a cigarette with her hair perfectly coiffed and draped in a mink coat.  Connie soon helps gather the few survivors of the sinking, which include young nurse Alice (Mary Anderson), a reformed pickpocket (Canada Lee), a millionaire industrialist (Henry Hull), a grieving young mother (Heather Angel), wounded boiler-room worker, Gus (William Bendix), and wisecracking Kovak (John Hodiak).The lives of the lifeboat passengers are put in untold jeopardy when one of the German crewmembers who helped to sink their freigher is rescued and brought aboard.  What are his true motives?  And why does he seem so willing to help them?...  Walter Slezak delivers a fabulous performance as the never-named German sailor.Acclaimed John Steinbeck (""Of Mice and Men"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"") wrote the screenplay, the very first piece he wrote exclusively for the screen.  While this is very much an ensemble piece, Tallulah Bankhead can't help but dominate with her gorgeous beauty and casual wit (and after all, the audience is first introduced to her).  John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, and especially William Bendix, are all memorable here too.  Playing the two other females onboard, Heather Angel and Mary Anderson must fight for screentime (Bankhead was a notorious scene-stealer), but manage to make a solid impression.LIFEBOAT is a very important film in the World War II era of Hitchcock's career.  There is no doubt that he wanted to get people talking about the palpable threat which Germany posed to the free world, and within the confines of a lifeboat, that threat and premise is explored and played out brilliantly.  As a paradox of the times in which it was made, LIFEBOAT delivers handsomely, and still offers gripping entertainment today.The DVD includes audio commentary with Hitchcock expert Prof. Drew Casper; an all-new ""Making of..."" featurette, galleries, and the trailer.",5,Tallulah Bankhead and a lifeboat of intrigue...,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2439,"['LIFEBOAT', 'one', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'most', 'accomplished', 'yet', 'cruelly', 'underrated', 'films', 'fabulous', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'story', 'group', 'survivors', 'bombed', 'freighter', 'fighting', 'very', 'survival', 'flimsy', 'lifeboat.As', 'film', 'see', 'freighter', 'smoking', 'chimney', 'stack', 'sinking', 'waves', 'miscellaneous', 'floating', 'debris', 'pack', 'cards', 'chessboard', 'lone', 'occupant', 'lifeboat', 'revealed', 'Connie', 'Porter', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'acerbic', 'globe-trotting', 'reporter', 'casually', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'hair', 'perfectly', 'coiffed', 'draped', 'mink', 'coat', 'Connie', 'soon', 'gather', 'few', 'survivors', 'sinking', 'include', 'young', 'nurse', 'Alice', 'Mary', 'Anderson', 'reformed', 'pickpocket', 'Canada', 'Lee', 'millionaire', 'industrialist', 'Henry', 'Hull', 'grieving', 'young', 'mother', 'Heather', 'Angel', 'wounded', 'boiler-room', 'worker', 'Gus', 'William', 'Bendix', 'wisecracking', 'Kovak', 'John', 'Hodiak', '.The', 'lives', 'lifeboat', 'passengers', 'are', 'put', 'untold', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'one', 'German', 'crewmembers', 'who', 'helped', 'sink', 'freigher', 'rescued', 'brought', 'aboard', 'What', 'are', 'true', 'motives', 'why', 'seem', 'so', 'willing', 'help', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'never-named', 'German', 'sailor.Acclaimed', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'Mice', 'Men', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'very', 'first', 'piece', 'wrote', 'exclusively', 'screen', 'very', 'much', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'dominate', 'gorgeous', 'beauty', 'casual', 'wit', 'audience', 'first', 'introduced', 'John', 'Hodiak', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'especially', 'William', 'Bendix', 'are', 'memorable', 'here', 'too', 'Playing', 'two', 'other', 'females', 'onboard', 'Heather', 'Angel', 'Mary', 'Anderson', 'must', 'fight', 'screentime', 'Bankhead', 'was', 'notorious', 'scene-stealer', 'manage', 'make', 'solid', 'impression.LIFEBOAT', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'doubt', 'wanted', 'get', 'people', 'talking', 'palpable', 'threat', 'Germany', 'posed', 'free', 'world', 'confines', 'lifeboat', 'threat', 'premise', 'explored', 'played', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'paradox', 'times', 'was', 'made', 'LIFEBOAT', 'handsomely', 'still', 'gripping', 'entertainment', 'today.The', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Hitchcock', 'expert', 'Prof.', 'Drew', 'Casper', 'all-new', 'Making', 'featurette', 'galleries', 'trailer']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

Some of his best movies took place in a small area such as an apartment, ""Rope"" and ""Rear Window"" are good examples. This movie takes place in a smaller area, a lifeboat. The character development is incredible. You get a rounded group like you might expect to find on a wartime freighter. A socialite reporter, working man's man, girl next door, elderly tycoon, young mother, sailor, et cetera. We feel as though we are on that boat with them. They must try to survive with limited supplies and determine who to trust. When someone supposedly commits suicide they must figure out if they did or if they were murdered. The fact that one among them is a survivor from the U-boat that sunk their ship makes the tension even higher. Psychologicially this is one of Hitchcock's best. If you like any of Hitchcocks movies you will probably love this one. If only suspicion was the only problem, but they must deal with not only their personal differences but their almost hopeless situation. After all they have to find the way to a friendly ship and hope they have enough water and food to make it. Add to that an injured man needs a limb amputated and you begin to appreciate all the complexities of the movie. I have all the other classic Hitchcock movies. This was the only other great movie he made that was not available on DVD. Now that I have it I am happy. Other than what appears to be waterspots on the first few seconds of the movie, the rest is quite sharp and beautifully restored. The sound is excellent.

268456,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6301798732,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","While reading the newly published screenplay Zapata by John Steinbeck, I became interested in reading about his struggle with Alfred Hitchcock over the screenplay for Lifeboat.  It seems that Hitchcock had ideas of his own that he wished to pull from the script and therefore after the screenplay was completed by Steinbeck, Hitchcock re-wrote certain passages to allow his own vision of the work to emerge. Watching this excellent film, I kept wondering which elements could be attributed to Steinbeck and which elements to Hitchcock. However, the final product is excellent and highly entertaining.The story revolves around a lifeboat that has a group of survivors from a sea battle in the Atlantic during World War II. The German U-boat that sinks the passenger liner is also sunk. Steinbeck no doubt wished to make the survivors in the lifeboat into a microcosm of social types, but he also wished to make a commentary of the attitudes and beliefs present during the second World War. The initial survivor is a war correspondent, played by Tallulah Bankhead, but other survivors are soon fished out of the cold ocean. Also included is a millionaire industrialist, a highly literate sailor, a young female nurse running from the affair she had with a married man, a deranged mother and dead baby, a steward with a past as a pick-pocket, and several other interesting characters. The mystery, suspense, and plot revolve however not so much on when they will be rescued but around the captain of the German U-boat who is also one of the survivors. This highly skilled and intelligent sea captain is full of surprises and the reactions of the other folks in the lifeboat reflect the various responses to the rise of Nazism.

During a wartime encounter between a British  merchant-freighter and a German U-boat, both vessels are sunk and only nine  survivors make it into the lifeboat.  One is a German submariner.  Human  compassion prevails as he is permitted aboard -- besides, he is the only  one with any ability to navigate.  Tallulah Bankhead gives an impressive  performance as the domineering, spoiled, Society reporter who takes command  of her companions' fate.  Skilled in German, only she can communicate with  the taciturn &quot;prisoner&quot;.  Suspense mounts with the suspicion that  the German is actually a Nazi officer who is directing the lifeboat into a  trap.  As the survivors are stricken with one disaster after another,  accusations erupt into violence that even the indomitable Tallulah may not  be able to control.  But through it all, her lipstick and coiffure will  remain perfect!

This came to me upon watching one of my dad's all time favorite films, and one which I have watched several dozen times in my life- Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 black and white Lifeboat, which is also one of the three or four best films Hitchcock ever made, and did receive Academy Award nominations for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. While I am not a rabid devotee of Hitchcock, because most of his thrillers are filled with rather cardboard cutout characters, despite the films' technical excellence, this is still probably my favorite Hitchcock film; not only because of the memories of watching it with my dad, but because it is one of the least Hitchcockian films in his canon- in terms of its relative lack of formulaic suspense, and because of the great and inimitable Tallulah Bankhead (one of my dad's favorite actresses), who utterly dominates every scene of the film she's in.The film's greatness comes in the way it realistically sketches human reactions and nature in extremis, even as it relies on some of the grossest human caricatures, stereotypes, and is a blatant bit of agitprop. That said, and given the limitations of having the film set totally in a boat, that Hitchcock comes even within spitting distance of the film being a great work of art (it's not; it misses by a hair, for the flaws mentioned) is, itself, evidence of greatness at work. It is also one of the most brilliant and odd character studies on film.The very schizophrenic screenplay, which alternately depicts real human emotions in characters blatantly constructed to teach a didactic lesson, and be props to push the tale forward (i.e.- how convenient it is to have both a doctor and a nurse in the same boat when another character's leg needs to be amputated; among many), and then reduces them to utter stereotypes, was adapted from an original novella, of the same title, that Hitchcock commissioned John Steinbeck to write. When Steinbeck was done, and went off to the Second World War, Hitchcock hired playwright Jo Swerling to punch up the dialogue.... For Hitchcock fans, wondering how the director snuck in his cameo, it's when Gus is reading a newspaper, and we see an ad for a diet pill- Reduco, which features before and after pictures of Hitchcock. That same gag was reused in Rope. If Lifeboat is not a great film, it's damned close, and given all the technical and script problems it had to overcome, that's a hell of an achievement, for, unlike many Hitchcock films, this one can be seen over and again and force deeper conversation each time, because it is not dependent upon a simple-minded twist ending. Thus, despite all its failings, Lifeboat is a true work of art, something its heroine has also been called.

But my difficulty and problems lie mostly with my confusion about what I was supposed to feel.  The message is not clear.  I find this troubling since Hitchcock, being the master, was always able to control his audience without them ever knowing (remember during Psycho, when suddenly the car NOT going into the lake scared you, and you may have noticed later that your allegiance shifted, without a conscious decision, from Marion to Norman?).Regardless of that, Tallulah Bankhead was marvelous, as was Canada Lee (even in his confined role of George ""Joe"" Spencer).Great for WWII propaganda, but a little lacking in the Hitchcock--still a great movie.

Markel,"[11, 11]","This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.The movie doesn't waste any time assembling ten adults in a lifeboat that was launched from a sinking freighter torpedoed by a German U-Boat in the Atlantic during World War II. Nine of the crew came from the freighter, while the tenth is a survivor of the U-Boat, which was also sunk during this confrontation.  The more notable characters include: a world famous news reporter, Connie Smith (Tallulah Bankhead); a U-Boat Captain (Walter Slezak); a freighter engine man, John Kovac (John Hodiak); a freighter captain Gus Smith (William Bendix); and a wealthy industrialist, 'Ritt' Rittenhouse (Henry Hull).  The survivors are confronted with plenty of moral challenges among themselves as well as battling nature with very limited food, water and other life-sustaining essentials.There's rarely a dull moment in this film as the freighter survivors are faced with many moral dilemmas including saving a person who is responsible for sinking their ship and killing hundreds of their fellow crewmen.  Murphy's Law (if something can go wrong, it probably will) seems to also run amuck in this story.  Since it was made and released during WWII, there's clearly a sense of Allied moral superiority.  The best performance and screen presence far and away is by Tallulah Bankhead, but all of the other actors give stellar performances.  Canada Lee's recitation of the 23rd Psalm is simply great!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it clearly has Hitchcock's artistry and personal touches throughout the film including his clever cameo appearance.As for the DVD, Hitchcock fans like myself who have seen this on VHS have been aware that the image quality has been always been suspect and there was great hope and anticipation that the DVD would offer an immaculate presentation of the film.  This wasn't the case as parts of the first 15 minutes show some of the same water-damaged image problems revealed on the VHS videos.  Fortunately, this happens during scenes where its foggy, so it's not a devastating issue, but one would have hoped that Fox could have either found some secondary sources or meticulously restored these damaged segments.  But in spite of these technical shortcomings, I would still strongly recommend viewing this movie.  There are several worthwhile bonus features including how the film was shot in Fox's studio and commentary by film professor Drew Casper.Movie: A-DVD Quality: B-",5,An eclectic cast of characters fight for survival on the high seas during wartime!,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,2458,"['review', '2005', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'DVD.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'assembling', 'ten', 'adults', 'lifeboat', 'was', 'launched', 'sinking', 'freighter', 'torpedoed', 'German', 'U-Boat', 'Atlantic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Nine', 'crew', 'came', 'freighter', 'tenth', 'survivor', 'U-Boat', 'was', 'also', 'sunk', 'confrontation', 'more', 'notable', 'characters', 'include', 'world', 'famous', 'news', 'reporter', 'Connie', 'Smith', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'U-Boat', 'Captain', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'freighter', 'engine', 'man', 'John', 'Kovac', 'John', 'Hodiak', 'freighter', 'captain', 'Gus', 'Smith', 'William', 'Bendix', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'Rittenhouse', 'Henry', 'Hull', 'survivors', 'are', 'confronted', 'plenty', 'moral', 'challenges', 'as', 'well', 'battling', 'nature', 'very', 'limited', 'food', 'water', 'other', 'life-sustaining', 'rarely', 'dull', 'moment', 'film', 'freighter', 'survivors', 'are', 'faced', 'many', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'including', 'saving', 'person', 'who', 'responsible', 'sinking', 'ship', 'killing', 'hundreds', 'fellow', 'crewmen', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'something', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'probably', 'will', 'also', 'run', 'amuck', 'story', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'WWII', 'clearly', 'sense', 'Allied', 'moral', 'superiority', 'best', 'performance', 'screen', 'presence', 'far', 'away', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'other', 'actors', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Canada', 'Lee', 'recitation', '23rd', 'Psalm', 'simply', 'great', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'clearly', 'Hitchcock', 'artistry', 'personal', 'touches', 'film', 'including', 'clever', 'cameo', 'appearance.As', 'DVD', 'Hitchcock', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'VHS', 'have', 'been', 'aware', 'image', 'quality', 'been', 'always', 'been', 'suspect', 'was', 'great', 'hope', 'anticipation', 'DVD', 'would', 'offer', 'immaculate', 'presentation', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'parts', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'show', 'same', 'water-damaged', 'image', 'problems', 'revealed', 'VHS', 'videos', 'Fortunately', 'scenes', 'where', 'foggy', 'not', 'devastating', 'issue', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Fox', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'secondary', 'sources', 'meticulously', 'restored', 'damaged', 'segments', 'spite', 'technical', 'shortcomings', 'would', 'still', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Fox', 'studio', 'commentary', 'film', 'professor', 'Drew', 'Casper.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality', 'B-']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

After a merchant ship is sunk by a U-boat during WWII in the Atlantic, a varied group of survivors must interact on the only surviving lifeboat. There's a rich guy and a rich gal, a poor al and a poor guy, a black guy, a tough guy and a German guy. The social prejudices of the 1940s are all on display. Social correspondent Connie Porter has managed to gain a seat with her fur coat, movie camera and typewriter in tow. Others, like John Kovak (John Hoviak) arrive on board dirty and with little more than the clothes on their backs. The film revolves around relationship of the Americans and English with the German U-boat captain Willy (Walter Slezak). Hitchcock seems intent on lampooning those who in the 1940s harbor humane attitudes toward Germans. To his credit, Slezak is no caricature of the sneering Nazi; his menace is quiet, thus more insidious and all the more dangerous. Hitchcock seems intent on warning his audience against trusting Germans. By the end of the film, his characters' actions have turned from insouciant, ineffective and fawning to (appropriately to the film's moral code) murderous. It's hard to know whether Hitchcock was studying human nature's tendency to group violence or trying to incite it. The film was released in 1944, after all, and the outcome of the war was still not completely certain.Technically, the film is masterful for its era. Trying to make something of the limitations of a rather small ""set,"" must have been a challenge. Luckily, John Steinbeck's script crafts plenty of earnest, distracting drama from the guilt, ennui, snobbishness, sickness, madness and class conflict between the lifeboat's occupants. In one poignant moment, when a vote is being taken to determine the boat's new skipper, Gus (George 'Joe' Spencer), the lone black man on board hangs back. ""Aren't you going to vote?"" someone asks. And in an all-too-real reflection of mid-century American racial realities, Gus exclaims in shock, ""I get to vote?""Lifeboat had too few of these kind of moments, and too may of the manufactured kind. The rich slowly lose everything. The poor find comfort in venting at the rich and at falling in love. But it's not very convincing to see forty-something Tallulah Bankhead vamping as a siren to the young sailors. And I am still trying to work out the message of the movie. The film ends with the survivors on the verge of rescue. But what have they learned? How have they changed? And is it for the better?Masterful for its day, a tad hokey and morally ambiguous. But it's Hitchcock and worth a viewing.The DVD extras aren't bad - the movie promo material gives a view into 1940s movie marketing.

Each character represents a particular cross-secton of society -- one member from the wealthy class, one from the working class, crewmembers, an officer, a nurse, and so forth -- again, typical Hitchcock.  A young Hume Cronyn is among the cast.The film, like some many of Hitch's is a masterpiece of direction.  This movie works because it comes down to the actors, the script, and very simple set -- nothing else.  The views on Nazi Germany civilization are really what make this film worth watching.  Especially since this film was made during WWII.My only problem with this version is that video quality is about what I would expect from a VHS tape after several viewings.  This package is billed as a ""Special Edition"", and yes, there are a few nice extras, and yes this is an old film, but had a little time and effort gone into some video restoration, which is not that big of a deal for a B&W; movie, this really could have been a sensational DVD on par with the special editions of Casablanca or Citizen Kane.",4,"Great Hitchcock, Good Movie, disappointing video....",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,1519,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'released', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'contributions', 'DVD', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'video', 'entertainment', 'restoration', 'classic', 'films', 'not', 'get', 'share', 'credit', 'Having', 'said', 'great', 'early', 'Hitchcock', 'Pre', '1950', 'watch', 'later', 'Rope', 'immortal', 'Rear', 'Window', 'film', 'Hitchcock', 'clostraphobic', 'set', 'where', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'single', 'setting', 'case', 'lifeboat', 'middle', 'Atlanic', 'ocean', 'character', 'particular', 'cross-secton', 'society', 'one', 'member', 'wealthy', 'class', 'one', 'working', 'class', 'crewmembers', 'officer', 'nurse', 'so', 'forth', 'again', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'A', 'young', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'cast.The', 'film', 'many', 'Hitch', 'masterpiece', 'direction', 'movie', 'down', 'actors', 'script', 'very', 'simple', 'set', 'nothing', 'else', 'views', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'civilization', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'Especially', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'WWII.My', 'only', 'problem', 'version', 'video', 'quality', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'VHS', 'tape', 'several', 'viewings', 'package', 'billed', 'Special', 'Edition', 'yes', 'are', 'few', 'nice', 'extras', 'yes', 'old', 'film', 'had', 'little', 'time', 'effort', 'gone', 'video', 'restoration', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sensational', 'DVD', 'par', 'special', 'editions', 'Casablanca', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

268486,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,6301798732,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[5, 5]","Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the all time master of suspense, made a bold and controversial statement for his time with the movie Lifeboat.  It can be called a study of social classes, a comparison of what happens when people are forced together in a life and death situation.After an Allied Freighter is hit by a torpedo launched from a German U boat, one lifeboat becomes the salvation for eight very different people.  A sophisticated and world traveling journalist, a rich industrialist, a tough as nails merchant marine, a military nurse, an engineer, an injured sailor, a mentally unstable woman, the radio operator and a steward.  As these people come aboard one by one, they begin piecing together what happened.  They are soon truly stunned when they pull the last survivor on board, one of the German sailors from the U boat, which was also sunk by the freighter's deck gun.When the dialogue starts, things really begin to unravel.  They aren't sure if they can trust the German sailor.  Is he the Captain?  Or is he just a deck hand?  Does he know the correct course to Bermuda or is he leading them into the hands of a German supply ship?  The suspense doesn't end as the questions find answers.  As circumstances become more bleek and the tensions begin to rise, the fate of the group becomes more indeterminate.  A few of the performances stand out, particularly Tallulah Bankhead as the journalist and William Yetter as the German sailor.  The screen play, which is based on a play, contains dialogue between the characters that remains sharp and focused throughout.I usually find the pace of older movies a little too slow and plodding.  It's a generational thing, I'm sure, having grown up on the faster-than-light age of modern movies and TV starting with Star Wars in 1977.  But Lifeboat (and most other films by Hitchcock) moves with great ambition, the story told only through dialogue and a sharp mix of character contrasts.  The affects are dated, but what needs to be focused on is the plot more than anything.  What Hitchcock does most brilliantly is make us feel confined to the boat with these people, as if we are trapped with them and involved on the decision making.  Many of the actions of the survivors can be considered controversial or against social norms but one thing is for certain; despite the age of this movie, relations to the characters can surely be relevant today.",4,Dated...but still Poignant and sharp,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2407,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'arguably', 'time', 'master', 'suspense', 'made', 'bold', 'controversial', 'statement', 'time', 'movie', 'Lifeboat', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'study', 'social', 'classes', 'comparison', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'together', 'life', 'death', 'situation.After', 'Allied', 'Freighter', 'hit', 'torpedo', 'launched', 'German', 'U', 'boat', 'one', 'lifeboat', 'salvation', 'eight', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'sophisticated', 'world', 'traveling', 'journalist', 'rich', 'industrialist', 'tough', 'nails', 'merchant', 'marine', 'military', 'nurse', 'engineer', 'injured', 'sailor', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'radio', 'operator', 'steward', 'people', 'come', 'one', 'one', 'begin', 'piecing', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'soon', 'truly', 'stunned', 'when', 'pull', 'last', 'survivor', 'board', 'one', 'German', 'sailors', 'U', 'boat', 'was', 'also', 'sunk', 'freighter', 'deck', 'gun.When', 'dialogue', 'things', 'really', 'begin', 'unravel', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'can', 'trust', 'German', 'sailor', 'Captain', 'just', 'deck', 'hand', 'know', 'correct', 'course', 'Bermuda', 'leading', 'hands', 'German', 'supply', 'ship', 'suspense', ""n't"", 'end', 'questions', 'find', 'answers', 'circumstances', 'become', 'more', 'bleek', 'tensions', 'begin', 'rise', 'fate', 'group', 'more', 'indeterminate', 'few', 'performances', 'stand', 'out', 'particularly', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'journalist', 'William', 'Yetter', 'German', 'sailor', 'screen', 'play', 'based', 'play', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'sharp', 'focused', 'throughout.I', 'usually', 'find', 'pace', 'older', 'movies', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'plodding', 'generational', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'faster-than-light', 'age', 'modern', 'movies', 'TV', 'starting', 'Star', 'Wars', '1977', 'Lifeboat', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'great', 'ambition', 'story', 'told', 'only', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'mix', 'character', 'contrasts', 'affects', 'are', 'dated', 'what', 'be', 'focused', 'plot', 'more', 'anything', 'What', 'Hitchcock', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'make', 'feel', 'confined', 'boat', 'people', 'are', 'trapped', 'involved', 'decision', 'making', 'Many', 'actions', 'survivors', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'controversial', 'social', 'norms', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'age', 'movie', 'relations', 'characters', 'can', 'surely', 'be', 'relevant', 'today']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

Hitchcock, as usual, shows his ability to underscore a story with pointed visual cues that complement Steinbeck's pared-down style and Jo Swerling's screen adaptation.  This is a tightly constructed film with a host of excellent character actors.  Tallulah Bankhead is marvelous on so many levels, but the ensemble is what eventually tells this story best.Hitchcock uses his deft touch to bring the audience into the story, setting the scene early with the light repartee of Bankhead's character, that slowly evolves as the back stories of each character create a series of events that force each character to confront what they hold most dear in their lives.This is not a lighthearted film.  You will see yourself in the strengths and weaknesses of each character, drawn from the spectrum of humanity during wartime.  By the end, one could easily consider this something of a war propaganda film, but it also leaves you with a few thoughts to ponder about human frailties that make it more a commentary than an exhortation to take up arms against a dastardly enemy.If you are a Hitchcock fan, this is a must-have.

This movie tends to lean towards the wartime propoganda movie, and why not?  It was made in 1944 when the sentiments toward Naziism was not very positive.  After all, the basic philosophy of the Nazis was that one person was better than another and it was their job to rid the world of the weaker ones.  This movie does a good job of weaving suspense through a topic that no doubt created many different feelings for the people who watched this film.The characters are interesting as there is a good cross-section of life portrayed.  Some start out hating Nazis, and some are more inclined to doing the ""fair and proper"" thing, but in the end, the bad guys are portrayed in a bad light, and the good guys in the war triumph--kind of.  It's really very difficult to triumph in a movie like this: there is suffering and sadness and ""scoundrelry"" to spare.  I guess I consider the triumph more in terms of when the film was made and what the obvious point of the movie was.

Just some thoughts on this classic Hitchcock movie...Lifeboat (1944) is an example of what Alfred Hitchcock could do in a very small, confined space.  Think of movies like Rear Window (1954), Rope (1948), and Dial M For Murder (1954).  All of these movies pretty much take place in one small setting.  Hitchcock knew how to get the most out of the minimum.  I think this movie is very well casted.  Tallulah Bankhead carries this movie on her shoulders.  She's great in this.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Tallulah stands out.  Her good looks, sinister laugh, and unique voice keep viewers mesmerized in anything she's in.  Bankhead was a lifelong baseball fan, and at one point there is a conversation in the lifeboat about baseball, but ironically Bankhead isn't involved in the conversation.  This movie features two alum from the 1960s Batman TV series on ABC - Tallulah Bankhead (The Black Widow) and Walter Slezak (The Clock King).The movie was filmed in black and white.  The first ten minutes or so of the movie have lesser picture quality than the rest of the movie due to water damage to the film.  The special effects are decent for the time period. Even with the movie taking place in a lifeboat, the movie has classic Hitchcock suspense.  The DVD contains some extras, such as a 19-minute documentary on the making of the movie, audio commentary, etc.Overall, this is a classic Hitchcock movie that is very different from anything he ever did before and after.

268495,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,6301798732,Josef Bush,"[5, 5]","Tallulah Bankhead was one of the 20th century's best actresses, taking over from Ethel Barrymore as the Toast of Broadway and the London stage.  She made few films, and this is her best role.  (For a very long time the joke was that Bankhead's stage roles were taken over by and became film hits for Bette Davis.  Certainly that's true with Hellman's THE LITTLE FOXES.)  Here, one has the opportunity to observe how an actress of supreme talent, handles a role in which everything is shown; in which practically nothing can be hidden.  Every would-be actress ought to study not only what she does, but more importantly, what she doesn't do, for as a stage acress par excellence all through her younger years, some movie people thought her too big for the screen.  Probably she wasn't, but simply needed a good director.  Here, she got the best in the business, and the results show.Hitchcock was fascinated with women, with actresses, and  particularly beautiful ones.  And, if Connie's beauty here, is not young, and fresh, it is nevertheless, compelling.  She is like a thoroughbred mare among mules and cab nags in an auction pen of chance.  She stands out because of her breeding.  She has lines.  Her costume?  A white silk blouse, good nylons, a full-length mink coat, and a diamond bracelet.  And, of course, that wonderful mane of natural, blonde hair.If you study Hitchcock, it would make a wonderful double bill to see LIFEBOAT and STAGE FRIGHT close together.  Here, he studies Bankhead; in STAGEFRIGHT he studies Dietrich; two fair-haired actresses of wildly differing personal style, but of exceptional power and interest.  And, what they have in common and what both display in these two films, is their unusual, and unusually expressive voices.  Bankhead was a famous radio actress for many years, as well as a stage star.  Dietrich too was a radio actress, and all her life was a singer and recording artist.  The trick in working with an artist with an exceptional voice, is to carefully trim and arrange the dialogue in such a way as best to show off the voice's characteristics.Admirers of Lesbian Chic might want to imagine what Ann Sheridan, or Barbara Stanwick, Rosalind Russell, Ruth Hussey or Lizabeth Scott or any one of a number of others might have done with this ""Contralto"" role:  You know, the wise-cracking, hard boiled newspaper dame.  The role is a Type, very popular during the 30's, and with a lesser actress and a lesser director, we might have gotten a good movie out of the material, but not a black-and-white masterpiece, like this one.  After all, what if CASABLANCA had been cast with Ronald Raegan and Heddy Lamarr?You can watch this movie over and over.

268498,AZC562U18BK2S,6301798732,J. R. Trtek,"[1, 1]","I tend to view Lifeboat as a brilliant tactical success but a strategic stalemate. From the standpoint of craft, it's near perfect, especially given its time. The opening title shot then continues as the first of the film itself, and as the camera pulls back the sight of that smokestack in its real context is pure wonder. However, making a film where all the action takes place in a lifeboat would pose problems in the 40s, and at times the use of rear projection techniques make for scenes that are too obviously fake -- still, one adjusts for the time and accepts that limitation. The script, based on a novella by John Steinbeck, does an excellent job in introducing the characters and starting them down the road to textured and engaging if sometimes cliched interactions. The actors are all well cast: John Hodiak actually appears to be made of more than wood in this picture, no mean feat for him. Canada Lee is underused, sadly, but his presence does allow the film to make a couple quiet comments on racism, observations which are rather ahead of their time for 1944. Hume Cronyn is an inconsistent English sailor, his accent fading in and out and never really sounding quite right, but he's nonetheless excellent as Sparks. Walter Slezak as the German Willi comes close to stealing the picture. I said at the beginning that I find this film does not succeed in a strategic sense, and by that I mean that at the end I'm not quite sure what if any lessons are learned, by us or the lifeboat survivors, and it's that uncertainty that leaves me without a full sense of satisfaction. And after all that dialogue aboard the lifeboat, which for me doesn't drag at all, the ending is full of action, to say the least. Some may find the movie tedious and overlaid with a bit too much of a political subtext, but those are not my reactions as well. I'm not sure where this voyage is supposed to end, but I found the ride itself engaging and then some.

268502,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301798732,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[10, 11]","Alfred Hitchcock always put together cinematic experiences that astound, bewilder, and amaze.  In the years before World War II, Hitchcock efficiently capitalized on the politically tense atmosphere in Europe through suspenseful spy dramas such as The 39 Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), and The Lady Vanishes (1938).  During the Second World War, he continued to display a thorough understanding of political climate and fear that it generated in the American people and the rest of the Allied world through Saboteur (1942) and Lifeboat (1944).Besides Hitchcock's extensive wisdom of the political and social world, he also illustrates a brilliant mind for the human psyche.  Both the social and psychological world in which people coexists subtly materialize in his films through an intricate web of truths and lies, as emotions efficiently cloud the thoughts of the characters.  It is a notion that emerges exceptionally well in Lifeboat, where Hitchcock allows the audience to submerge themselves in a tale thick of psychological undercurrents that feeds on the fear spawned in the social and political world of the 1940s.It begins with a promise of horror and fear that enters the audience, as the music screams chillingly out of the speakers.  The opening music serves the great purpose of keying the audience into the severity of the catastrophe in the beginning, and to what dreadfulness waits.  Through the opening credits the black smoke races out of a ship's chimney, as the steam whistle uninterruptedly shrieks its alarm.  Symbolically, it might warn the audience of dangerous times ahead while it more directly implies that the near future in the film will provide danger and suspense.Hitchcock was also a genius at applying symbolical items within the mise-en-scene that the audience understood.  Lifeboat is no exception even though the whole film takes place in the small lifeboat.  On the contrary, the opening montage offers a clear indication of how clever Hitchcock was in using items to bring out feelings and moods within the audience.  The opening displays the aftermath of a Nazi torpedo that has sunk a delivery vessel, but in the process faced its own doom.  Through a few, but strategically placed items floating in the water Hitchcock says exactly what he wants, and more.  The symbolical value of the mise-en-scene continues to enhance the cinematic experience throughout the film.Ironically, Hitchcock allows the audience first to meet greedy reporter Constance ""Connie"" Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) floating along in the lifeboat.  The fog wraps around her like a hidden secret while she notices that her pantyhose have a run in them instead of trying to find survivors.  In a distance, she hears the voice of John Kovak (John Hodiak) calling for help while swimming to the safety of the lifeboat.  Callously, the audience learns about Connie's persona, as she in feverish joy explains how she documented the passengers' fierce struggle for survival while the ship was sinking.  It is not until Kovak begins to search for other survivors that the lifeboat begins to fill up with people.  However, Kovak is not without flaws, which slowly begin to emerge through his inferiority complex.Amidst the other passengers that join the lifeboat the audience will learn about a class struggle, love story, the tragic loss of a child, deceit, and war between nations, as one of the survivors turns out to be a Nazi sailor.  These side plots enhance the complexity of story, as the struggle for survival continues.  Within the complexity of the story, fear brews stronger, as it also allows the monster of each individual to emerge regardless of nationality.  However, a notion that Hitchcock cleverly presents is the notion of reasonable fear depending on situation, as the fear of death shadows the thoughts of the survivors in the lifeboat.  Yet, the human side of each character also presents some interesting notions in regards to understanding and indifference.  Through the many different characters the audience will find at least one person they can identify with, which allows the viewer to take long and hard look into their own character and discover our own shortcomings and strengths.Hitchcock concocted a masterful thriller while World War II still ran hot in Europe and Asia.  In fear to how the audience might have reacted to the film, the studio only gave the film a limited release, which gave it poor box office earnings.  Regardless of its earnings, it is a great film providing the audience with a meaningful cinematic experience with suspense in which the audience can ponder the notion of reasonable fear.",5,Hitchcock Concocted a Masterful Thriller while World War II Still Ran Hot in Europe and Asia...,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,4646,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'always', 'put', 'together', 'cinematic', 'experiences', 'astound', 'bewilder', 'amaze', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Hitchcock', 'efficiently', 'capitalized', 'politically', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'Europe', 'suspenseful', 'spy', 'dramas', 'such', '39', 'Steps', '1935', 'Sabotage', '1936', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', '1938', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'continued', 'display', 'thorough', 'understanding', 'political', 'climate', 'fear', 'generated', 'American', 'people', 'rest', 'Allied', 'world', 'Saboteur', '1942', 'Lifeboat', '1944', 'Hitchcock', 'extensive', 'wisdom', 'political', 'social', 'world', 'also', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'human', 'psyche', 'social', 'psychological', 'world', 'people', 'coexists', 'subtly', 'materialize', 'films', 'intricate', 'web', 'truths', 'lies', 'emotions', 'efficiently', 'cloud', 'thoughts', 'characters', 'notion', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Lifeboat', 'where', 'Hitchcock', 'audience', 'submerge', 'tale', 'thick', 'psychological', 'undercurrents', 'feeds', 'fear', 'spawned', 'social', 'political', 'world', '1940s.It', 'begins', 'promise', 'horror', 'fear', 'audience', 'music', 'chillingly', 'speakers', 'opening', 'music', 'great', 'purpose', 'keying', 'audience', 'severity', 'catastrophe', 'beginning', 'what', 'dreadfulness', 'waits', 'opening', 'black', 'smoke', 'ship', 'chimney', 'steam', 'whistle', 'uninterruptedly', 'alarm', 'Symbolically', 'might', 'warn', 'audience', 'dangerous', 'times', 'ahead', 'more', 'directly', 'near', 'future', 'film', 'will', 'provide', 'danger', 'suspense.Hitchcock', 'was', 'also', 'genius', 'applying', 'symbolical', 'items', 'mise-en-scene', 'audience', 'understood', 'Lifeboat', 'exception', 'even', 'whole', 'film', 'place', 'small', 'lifeboat', 'contrary', 'opening', 'montage', 'clear', 'indication', 'how', 'clever', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'using', 'items', 'bring', 'out', 'feelings', 'moods', 'audience', 'opening', 'aftermath', 'Nazi', 'torpedo', 'sunk', 'delivery', 'vessel', 'process', 'faced', 'own', 'doom', 'few', 'strategically', 'placed', 'items', 'floating', 'water', 'Hitchcock', 'exactly', 'what', 'more', 'symbolical', 'value', 'mise-en-scene', 'enhance', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'film.Ironically', 'Hitchcock', 'audience', 'first', 'meet', 'greedy', 'reporter', 'Constance', 'Connie', 'Porter', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'floating', 'along', 'lifeboat', 'fog', 'hidden', 'secret', 'pantyhose', 'have', 'run', 'instead', 'trying', 'find', 'survivors', 'distance', 'voice', 'John', 'Kovak', 'John', 'Hodiak', 'calling', 'help', 'swimming', 'safety', 'lifeboat', 'Callously', 'audience', 'Connie', 'persona', 'feverish', 'joy', 'how', 'documented', 'passengers', 'fierce', 'struggle', 'survival', 'ship', 'was', 'sinking', 'not', 'Kovak', 'search', 'other', 'survivors', 'lifeboat', 'fill', 'up', 'people', 'However', 'Kovak', 'not', 'flaws', 'slowly', 'begin', 'emerge', 'inferiority', 'complex.Amidst', 'other', 'passengers', 'join', 'lifeboat', 'audience', 'will', 'learn', 'class', 'struggle', 'love', 'story', 'tragic', 'loss', 'child', 'deceit', 'war', 'nations', 'one', 'survivors', 'out', 'be', 'Nazi', 'sailor', 'side', 'plots', 'enhance', 'complexity', 'story', 'struggle', 'survival', 'complexity', 'story', 'fear', 'brews', 'stronger', 'also', 'monster', 'individual', 'emerge', 'regardless', 'nationality', 'However', 'notion', 'Hitchcock', 'cleverly', 'presents', 'notion', 'reasonable', 'fear', 'depending', 'situation', 'fear', 'death', 'thoughts', 'survivors', 'lifeboat', 'human', 'side', 'character', 'also', 'interesting', 'notions', 'regards', 'understanding', 'indifference', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'identify', 'viewer', 'take', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'own', 'character', 'discover', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'strengths.Hitchcock', 'concocted', 'masterful', 'thriller', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'still', 'ran', 'hot', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'fear', 'how', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'reacted', 'film', 'studio', 'only', 'gave', 'film', 'limited', 'release', 'gave', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'earnings', 'Regardless', 'earnings', 'great', 'film', 'providing', 'audience', 'meaningful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'suspense', 'audience', 'can', 'ponder', 'notion', 'reasonable', 'fear']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

268508,A3F0FQL345CUK6,6301798732,"""Loopydloop""","[1, 1]","A really unusual and interesting wartime drama with a stellar cast and unique situation. Filmed mostly on the one set, the boat, and using water tanks and rear screen projection, Hitchcock created a real challenge to himself, his cast and his crew by setting the entire film in, what else, a lifeboat drifting out at sea after a wartime maritime disaster. This is a brave film on a number of levels. One: The difficultly of shooting believable footage in a controlled environment. Two: Getting a script good enough to hold audiences interest for the length of a feature film that is set only in one place. Three: Casting actors capable of achieving an ensemble of interesting personalities that mesh so well together while being drastically different. Four: Convincing that cast to allow themselves to endure the kind of abuse that this picture needed to get the realism required. Five: Including some pretty grim and seedy elements in the script including death, betrayal and the ugly as well as the noble side of human nature. Six: Portraying the enemy.

Hitchcock directed this classic by John Steinbeck on a soundstage but you don't notice that much because the emphasis is on the actors and dialogue and their increasingly volatile situation. Legendary stage star Tallulah Bankhead stars as wealthy photo-journalist Connie Porter who sheds her glamor and ""earthly possessions"" to survive among her fellow survivors William Bendix, John Hodiak, Canada Lee, Hume Cronyn and a couple of others. Walter Slezak is a Nazi captain they rescue who sets the drama in motion arousing conflict and issues of hatred and mistrust leading to an amputation, murder and finally revolt. The acting is first rate, the story is involving, the dialogue is tense and literate and the film as a whole is one of the best films of the 40's. The DVD print is fine but there are still visible scratches throughout that apparently couldn't be erased. However, it still looks good and is a film lover's treasure.

This film, and Tallulah Bankhead's performance in it, packs a whallop.""Lifeboat"" offers no simple treatment of Hitchcock's beloved theme ""the evil that lives among us"" (explored most brilliantly in ""Shadow of a Doubt""). Instead, it offers his most unflinching, direct look at evil's social agenda.

Clever of Hitchcock indeed, but it is Tallullah that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, waiting for her next sharply insightful comment.Unlike Katherine Hepburn, Tallulah never overplays her cards, and she carries this film effortlessly.  She may gradually be stripped of all the fine things she treasures (Hitchcock always strives to make his protagonists vulnerable), but Tallulah never loses her core values.At the end, it is Tallulah's embodiment of the spirit of survival that the audience identifies with, and makes ""Lifeboat"" a complex and satisfying mature movie experience.",4,Jump in!,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,1585,"['Hitchcock', 'did', 'favours', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'giving', 'Lifeboat', 'one', 'least', 'appealing', 'titles', 'films', 'alternatively', 'think', 'built-in', 'audience', 'appeal', 'such', 'words', 'Notorious', 'Spellbound', 'Psycho', '.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'film', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'performance', 'whallop', 'Lifeboat', 'simple', 'treatment', 'Hitchcock', 'beloved', 'theme', 'evil', 'explored', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'Instead', 'most', 'unflinching', 'direct', 'look', 'evil', 'social', 'agenda', 'film', 'variety', 'ordinary', 'Joes', 'Janes', 'think', 'Capra', 'meets', 'Hitchcock', 'regard', 'own', 'inexperienced', 'take', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'predictable', 'solutions', 'such', 'end', 'evil', 'death', 'antagonist', 'evil', 'even', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'Lifeboat', 'ominously', 'simple', 'scenario', 'survival', 'individual', 'multi-faceted', 'revelation', 'threatened', 'survival', 'society', 'Clever', 'Hitchcock', 'indeed', 'Tallullah', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'waiting', 'next', 'sharply', 'insightful', 'comment.Unlike', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Tallulah', 'never', 'cards', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'may', 'gradually', 'be', 'stripped', 'fine', 'things', 'Hitchcock', 'always', 'make', 'protagonists', 'vulnerable', 'Tallulah', 'never', 'core', 'values.At', 'end', 'Tallulah', 'embodiment', 'spirit', 'survival', 'audience', 'identifies', 'Lifeboat', 'complex', 'satisfying', 'mature', 'movie', 'experience']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

And it shows....Lifeboat was a play by John Steinback, in which, after a dramatic sea battle, a group of passengers get together on a lifeboat after the ocean liner they were travelling at gets sunk by a german U-boat (that also sunk).This premisse is the perfect environment for Hitchcock to show his best characteristic: a director who loves to work under self imposed constrictions so he can turn these same constrictions to his own advantage. The constriction I'm talking about is his best mark: closed spaces, single settings, the challenge of making the audience unaware that they are in just one big room.Stranded in the middle of the Atlantic we see a micro society: the rich spoiled girl in a mink coat (Talullah Bankhead in a great role), an industrialist, a sailor, a mother with her dead baby, a nurse, a engeneer, a steward... and the german captain from the U-boat that was responsible for the whole tragedy.As the survivors try to cope with their new condition, they cannot agree on the direction their lifeboat should take in a desperate attempt to reach an allied ship. Should they trust one of theirs and risk to die adrift... or should they trust the wise experienced german captain who may or may not be leading them towards a german ship that may be somewhere close.And then comes the question: is the german captain a prisoner of the group... or is the whole group prisoner of just one german?Can you believe the dramatic possibilities of such an idea?Well... being a Hitchcock movie, you'll never see a dull moment... nor the camera stuck by the fact we are in just one set. Everything in this movie is right... actors, cinematography, direction, special effects... everything in this movie is a great example of classical Hollywood... and the story has great pace... and never lets the audience for a moment feel bored. There's plenty action, suspense, tension, drama... even murder.Talullah Bankhead's character is unforgettable as a rich, spoiled reporter whose practical spirit is always ahead of problems... she is always chicly and stylishly helping everybody. My favorite quotes: ""Dying together's even more personal than living together""; ""In a word: Wow!"" and the best one...

And the actors are so good that we don't want to turn away.I can't say much about the players themselves without giving too much away, but believe me, LIFEBOAT is alive with with people who, stranded or not, can't help playing out their strengths, weaknesses, and ambivalences on each other while inveigling us into that LIFEBOAT to enjoy the cruise.  Being Hitchcock, of course, LIFEBOAT is a tale of suspense, and the plot is as loaded to the gunwales with it as is the LIFEBOAT itself.I found LIFEBOAT on DVD at AMAZON.COM, and I truly hope you will as well.  Being Amazon, it's reasonably priced, and soon delivered.  Enjoy, enjoy!

268532,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,6301798732,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[4, 4]","John Steinbeck's LIFEBOAT gets the Alfred Hitchcock effect.  In Hitchcock's film adaption, the story revolves around eight stranded passengers who's ship goes down in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.  Indeed, this is a character study of the human intricacies, stereotypes and clash of cultures and inferior complexities, that occur during times of war; the film is a reflection of World War II, and the social atmosphere that was quite similar to the animosity and uneasiness that occurred during World War I, which involved xenophobia.Hitchcock glares a light on the the eight passengers.  Out of the eight, four stand out, and effectively keeps viewers at the edge of their seat as well as feel the tension, uncertainty, and fate of the rest of the characters in the film.  Willy (Walter Slezak) is the stranger and distrustful German captain who presumably blew up the passenger ship and one of the characters Hitchcock casts a sharp focus on him, and journalist, Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), a woman who clings to her materialistic possessions, and there is one scene where she weeps about her Cartier bracelet because she used it as fish bait. The only African American character in the film, George `Joe' Spencer, the ship's steward, played by Canada Lee, is one of the symbolic characters in the film, who was a convict in another life, but now has reformed.  Also, worth mentioning is Gus Smith (William Bendix), an American who is in conflict with his German ancestry, loses his leg from gangrene and later becomes delusional and light-headed and imagines he's back home keeping track of baseball stats and awaits the day when he will see his girl; unfortunately, Gus does not get the chance.  In addition, the passengers are at odds with Willy.  Hitchcock subtly shows the passengers' resilience of taking any drastic actions against Willy, and throughout each scene where conflict occurred, the rule of law constantly loomed over their heads.  However, the concluding scenes are the most pivotal and may raise questions.Overall, LIFEBOAT is unpredictable and intense.  But it is a significant film that takes place during World War II (note the concluding credits to the film, and you can see in the corner an advertisement to buy war bonds), and how individuals react during uncompromising situations Therefore, this is an unforgettable and highly recommended film.",5,A Boat Full of Issues,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,2394,"['John', 'Steinbeck', 'LIFEBOAT', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'effect', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'adaption', 'story', 'around', 'eight', 'stranded', 'passengers', 'who', 'ship', 'down', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Indeed', 'character', 'study', 'human', 'intricacies', 'stereotypes', 'clash', 'cultures', 'inferior', 'complexities', 'occur', 'times', 'war', 'film', 'reflection', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'social', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'quite', 'similar', 'animosity', 'uneasiness', 'occurred', 'World', 'War', 'involved', 'xenophobia.Hitchcock', 'light', 'eight', 'passengers', 'eight', 'four', 'stand', 'effectively', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seat', 'as', 'well', 'feel', 'tension', 'uncertainty', 'fate', 'rest', 'characters', 'film', 'Willy', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'stranger', 'distrustful', 'German', 'captain', 'who', 'presumably', 'blew', 'up', 'passenger', 'ship', 'one', 'characters', 'Hitchcock', 'sharp', 'focus', 'journalist', 'Constance', 'Porter', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'woman', 'who', 'materialistic', 'possessions', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Cartier', 'bracelet', 'used', 'fish', 'bait', 'only', 'African', 'American', 'character', 'film', 'George', 'Joe', 'Spencer', 'ship', 'steward', 'played', 'Canada', 'Lee', 'one', 'symbolic', 'characters', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'convict', 'life', 'now', 'reformed', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Gus', 'Smith', 'William', 'Bendix', 'American', 'who', 'conflict', 'German', 'ancestry', 'leg', 'gangrene', 'later', 'delusional', 'light-headed', 'back', 'home', 'keeping', 'track', 'baseball', 'stats', 'day', 'when', 'will', 'see', 'girl', 'unfortunately', 'Gus', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'addition', 'passengers', 'are', 'odds', 'Willy', 'Hitchcock', 'subtly', 'passengers', 'resilience', 'taking', 'drastic', 'actions', 'Willy', 'scene', 'where', 'conflict', 'occurred', 'rule', 'law', 'constantly', 'loomed', 'heads', 'However', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'pivotal', 'may', 'raise', 'questions.Overall', 'LIFEBOAT', 'unpredictable', 'intense', 'significant', 'film', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'note', 'concluding', 'credits', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'corner', 'advertisement', 'buy', 'war', 'bonds', 'how', 'individuals', 'react', 'uncompromising', 'situations', 'Therefore', 'unforgettable', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS

How can you not have a hit?Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way.And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another.

The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboat...At first they were prepared to throw him overboard - but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took command...

We have the glamourous, sophisticated woman about town, Tallulah Bankhead, who is simply fantastic and completely unique as befitting a movie star of the time. Aloof, she eventually succumbs to emotion and becomes human, one of the survivors for real instead of acting in a play, at first.William Bendix plays a sympathetic man who has suffered a serious leg injury, necessitating the amputation of the limb on board and during rough seas with no anesthesia....to add further insult to injury, he loved to dance with his girlfriend, Rosie. Bendix is great, as always, but his finest performance ever, IMO, was in The Hairy Ape.Walter Slezak is the most insidious and evil force in this tiny segment of society, and he is wonderful in this role.Mary Anderson perfect in her role as the ethereal, vague lost soul who finally finds true love aboard the little boat.John Hodiak is excellent and entirely believable in his role as the tough guy who falls hard for the seemingly distant, unattainable Bankhead, more attainable than he first thought, happily for both.Henry Hull is the best here; he is just superb and grinds away at the forlorn stub of cigar ever present in his mouth. The hard millionaire, he eventually adopts a more human persona and is very funny at times. Just the right touch.Heather Angel is heartbreaking and her part is brief but very moving.Hume Cronyn is great; calm, soothing and sturdy, he is the stalwart of the group and supports everyone in need.Canada Lee is the lone black man here, and lends stability and sanity to the terrible position everyone is in...the deeply religious and conscientious one, a great person to have under any circumstances, but especially vital here.Of course, for those who try to find Alfred Hitchcock's signature appearance in all of his movies, you must pay close attention here...he had to be very creative in this instance!John Steinbeck wrote the story and his touch, as well as Hitchcock's, is evident throughou",5,"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL HITCHCOCK FARE, ONE OF HIS BEST",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2120,"['most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'particular', 'movie', 'place', 'one', 'small', 'lifeboat', 'disparate', 'assortment', 'characters', 'have', 'glamourous', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'town', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'who', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'completely', 'unique', 'befitting', 'movie', 'star', 'time', 'Aloof', 'eventually', 'succumbs', 'emotion', 'human', 'one', 'survivors', 'real', 'instead', 'acting', 'play', 'first.William', 'Bendix', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'serious', 'leg', 'injury', 'necessitating', 'amputation', 'limb', 'board', 'rough', 'seas', 'anesthesia', 'add', 'further', 'insult', 'injury', 'loved', 'dance', 'girlfriend', 'Rosie', 'Bendix', 'great', 'always', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'IMO', 'was', 'Hairy', 'Ape.Walter', 'Slezak', 'most', 'insidious', 'evil', 'force', 'tiny', 'segment', 'society', 'wonderful', 'role.Mary', 'Anderson', 'perfect', 'role', 'ethereal', 'vague', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'finally', 'true', 'love', 'little', 'boat.John', 'Hodiak', 'excellent', 'entirely', 'believable', 'role', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'hard', 'seemingly', 'distant', 'unattainable', 'Bankhead', 'more', 'attainable', 'first', 'thought', 'happily', 'both.Henry', 'Hull', 'best', 'here', 'just', 'superb', 'away', 'forlorn', 'stub', 'cigar', 'ever', 'present', 'mouth', 'hard', 'millionaire', 'eventually', 'more', 'human', 'persona', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'Just', 'right', 'touch.Heather', 'Angel', 'heartbreaking', 'part', 'brief', 'very', 'moving.Hume', 'Cronyn', 'great', 'calm', 'soothing', 'sturdy', 'stalwart', 'group', 'everyone', 'need.Canada', 'Lee', 'lone', 'black', 'man', 'here', 'stability', 'sanity', 'terrible', 'position', 'everyone', 'deeply', 'religious', 'conscientious', 'one', 'great', 'person', 'have', 'circumstances', 'especially', 'vital', 'here.Of', 'course', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'signature', 'appearance', 'movies', 'must', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'here', 'had', 'be', 'very', 'creative', 'instance', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'wrote', 'story', 'touch', 'as', 'well', 'Hitchcock', 'evident', 'throughou']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS
268539,A1C58YXM2A30CY,6301798732,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 2]","Despite Hollywood studio politics of the time, his own personal tragedies as the Nazis bombed England, his home, and a famous author whose short story Lifeboat is based (Steinbeck would later spurn the film as not true to his own tale), Hitchcock created a film that pioneered the film-making concepts of close-ups, quick-cuts and the entire film done on one set -- a lifeboat! -- with what we take for granted in today's small screen TV's.  And this was 1944!Hitchcock wanted to make a statement about the war -- World War II, which was affecting his own family and interests in England -- and communicate the want, the horror and what's important and what is not -- through allegory and implication.This special edition DVD supplies all the details of the above through the ""making of"" section -- Tallulah Bankhead's temper tantrums and prima donna activities on and off the set, Steinbeck's anger at the script that Jo Swerling wrote, and dealing with the producers who seemed to care more for profit and public relations.The story itself is a simple one, but must be watched again and again to get all of what's going on.  War correspondent woman (Bankhead) is smarmy, stuck-up, pompous and yet has an epiphany of what is important and what is not.  Another, a rich industrialist, wants to be democratic when the Nazi comes aboard the lifeboat (a crewman of the very U-Boat that torpedoed the Americans) and who later changes his mind in a most awful manner regarding the Nazi's life and death.Life and death.  Great themes to the Master of Suspense (initial caps!) -- even though this film lacks suspense (!) it does evoke more character development and interpersonal conflict to almost forget a war is going on -- almost!Walter Slezak is almost cherubic and sympathetic a character yet does things behind the crew's back and eventually goes so far as to betray the lot -- but is extremely surprised at the animal reaction of the crew.Hitchcock even figured out a way of making himself appear in this film without being part of the crew!

""Lifeboat"" is a wartime propaganda picture, certainly, but also one of the director's early American classics. It would be notable if only because it showcases the Broadway star Tallulah Bankhead in her only film role worth watching or even remembering.Hitchcock, working from a story by John Steinbeck, presents a microcosm of Americans and Brits clarifying the strengths and weaknesses of a world at war. Only the German U-boat captain, in an indelible performance by Walter Slezak, is able to cope. The star turn by Bankhead, as a dilettante reporter, is bruising to behold today.

""Special Edition"" doesn't mean that a title has been lovingly restored but that's usually the case.  The bad news is that ""Lifeboat"" has been transferred from DVD from the same water damaged negative (interpositive or print or whatever was used as the source) that was used for a laserdisc edition and earlier video edition from the 90's.  A classic early bit of Hitchcock that makes a lifeboat a microcosm of our prejudice infested world, ""Lifeboat"" is set during World War II.  Hitchcock approached John Steinbeck to write a treatment and screenplay with the basic plot already sketched out for Steinbeck. Although Steinbeck did do a single draft, most of the script was written in collaboration with producer Kenneth MacGowan, Alam Reville Hitchcock and Tony Award winning writer Jo Swerling (""Guys and Dolls"", ""Pride of the Yankees"") in collaboration with Hitchcock, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay in 1944.After a German U-Boat sinks a ship in the Atlantic, ten people  survive the sinking in a single lifeboat lost and largely forgotten by the rest of the world. Shipmates Gus Smith (William Bendix), John Kovac (John Hodiak), the radio operator""Sparks"" Garrett (Hume Cronyn), an African-American steward named Joe (Canada Lee) and a small group of surviving passengers Alice a nurse (Heather Angel), the wealthy Charles Rittenhouse (Henry Hull), Photographer Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) finally a shell shocked mother (Mary Anderson) whose baby dies in the attack.  When the passengers find another survivor things become nasty; the last survivor is a German officer (Walter Slezak) whose U-Boat is taken out after destroying the ship. When food disappears suspicions run rampant.A nice transfer despite the water damage, ""Lifeboat"" doesn't look bad it could just look so much better with a careful restoration. Unfortunately, ""Lifeboat"" is one of a handful of Hitch's undervalued classics that probably wouldn't appeal to many people beyond Hitchcock fans and older movie buffs. The blacks are solid and although the water damage is clearly visible in the print the picture looks pretty good. The analog mono sound occasionally sounds a bit thin particularly when the music swells up but the dialogue is clear and crisp.""The Making of `Life Boat': Theater of War"" features Hitch's daughter Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, film historian Drew Casper and others discussing the production. Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell  points out that star Tallulah Bankhead had the role of Constance Porter crafted for her by Hitchcock with his collaborators. Bankhead never wore underwear so the crew would get a thrill every time she walked up the ladder and got in the lifeboat. At one point there was a complaint from the cameraman that every time Tallulah spread her legs the shot was ruined because you could see her pubic hair. Hitchcock loudly mentioned that he wasn't sure if he should call make up, hair dressing or wardrobe to deal with the issue. It became less of an issue after that. Bankhead continued to cause various problems by referring to actor Walter Slezak as a Nazi off camera and belittling screen vet Henry Hull because he kept forgetting his lines or muffling them during takes. Bankhead developed pneumonia during the shoot putting it further behind schedule. Hitch's granddaughter. The featurette at about 20 minutes has quite a bit of behind-the-scenes information included in it. We also get a stills gallery.Professor Drew Casper who holds the Alma and Alfred Hitchcock chair at USC gives a very good commentary track. Although it's clearly written out almost as a lecture, Casper delivers his presentation with insight and trivia that will keep Hitchcock fans enraptured.A terrific underrated Hitchcock classic that has been improving with time, ""Lifeboat"" got roasted by critics and Steinbeck scholars during and after its release. Why the critics didn't go overboard with praise has something to do with the time and expectations for Hitchcock's films.  The performances work so well precisely because most of the actors did not get along with star Tallulah Bankhead during the shooting of the film.Although it lacks the careful and loving restoration done for Universal's theatrical and home video re-release for ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"", Fox's new DVD edition does come with a terrific featurette detailing the production of the film as well as a great stills gallery that features images of advertising, publicity articles and contest materials. Drew Casper's commentary also puts into perspective the important placed ""Lifeboat"" occupies in Hitch's body of work.",5,Classic Hitchcock film gets deluxe treatment except in area of

And so does the rest of the cast confined to Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT (1944).  Edge of the seat (or inflatable) suspense and high drama  Hitchcock style.  Not only did the Director manage to pull off a non-ending sequences of unique shots on a small, open boat, but he able to do so while dealing with Bankhead's  distain for under garments plus insert a cameo of himself (as gradually became his ""trademark"" starting  in the mid 1920's).In-camera effects are awesome for the time.  Front and rear projection is so seamless  and free of artifacts that it's difficult to believe the entire film was shot on sound stages.  Even though soundstage bound, it's was still no picnic for the performers (Bankhead came down with phenomena during the production--twice).Highly recommended.

268552,AP3B615GM191G,6301798732,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","Though many of Alfred Hitchcock's films are extraordinary at developing characters, that development often plays second-fiddle to suspense, drama, & even subtle comedy.  In ""Lifeboat"", however, the characters are on center stage throughout the entire experience, with Hitchcock masterful crafting them one by one...until the ending, of course.For a basic plot summary, ""Lifeboat"" tells the story of a group of Americans trapped on a lifeboat after the Nazi bombing of a freighter.  When a German U-boat captain is pulled aboard and portends to know the direction they should be sailing, the characters must decide whether or not to trust the enemy captain.  Along the way, all the personality types and individual prejudices are the survivors are explored.In terms of a character treatise, this is an excellent film...one of Hitch's very best.  I am a big fan of ""bunch of people trapped in a situation"" movies, so I was instantly drawn to this type of movie and was not let down.  Though Hitch usually deals with personal/political topics in a very off-hand, tongue-in-cheek sort of way, he really seems to delve into them with much more gusto in ""Lifeboat"".  Upon reaching the end, you'll feel as if you truly care about the characters and their motives/personalities.The acting is also top-notch, with a case of seasoned veterans like Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak, and Henry Hull, among others.  In films of this nature (think: 12 Angry Men, for instance) the acting must be spot-in in order to generate emotion, as very few outside factors can be utilized.Minor Spoiler: Sadly, the glaring weakness of this movie (and what keeps it from being a true classic) is its horrible ending.  Hitchcock has a long history of sub-par endings, but this one might be the ""cream of the crop"" in terms of ridiculousness.  For a film screaming for character resolution, this one gives you NOTHING.  It literally just ends.  Perhaps that was acceptable back in the 1940s, but today it is unforgivable.Overall, though, ""Lifeboat"" is a very interesting character study that is easily worthy of four-stars.  Had it offered a bit of resolution, this could have rocketed to the top of Hitchcock's filmography.  As it is, it's just a solid effort that fails in one key area.",4,Hitchcock's Character Study,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2289,"['many', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'developing', 'characters', 'development', 'often', 'second-fiddle', 'suspense', 'drama', 'even', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'Lifeboat', 'however', 'characters', 'are', 'center', 'stage', 'entire', 'experience', 'Hitchcock', 'masterful', 'crafting', 'one', 'one', 'ending', 'course.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Lifeboat', 'story', 'group', 'Americans', 'trapped', 'lifeboat', 'Nazi', 'bombing', 'freighter', 'When', 'German', 'U-boat', 'captain', 'pulled', 'aboard', 'know', 'direction', 'should', 'be', 'sailing', 'characters', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'trust', 'enemy', 'captain', 'way', 'personality', 'types', 'individual', 'prejudices', 'are', 'survivors', 'are', 'explored.In', 'terms', 'character', 'treatise', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', 'Hitch', 'very', 'best', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'bunch', 'people', 'trapped', 'situation', 'movies', 'was', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'Hitch', 'usually', 'personal/political', 'topics', 'very', 'off-hand', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'sort', 'way', 'really', 'delve', 'much', 'more', 'gusto', 'Lifeboat', 'reaching', 'end', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'truly', 'care', 'characters', 'motives/personalities.The', 'acting', 'also', 'top-notch', 'case', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'William', 'Bendix', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'John', 'Hodiak', 'Henry', 'Hull', 'others', 'films', 'nature', 'think', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'instance', 'acting', 'must', 'be', 'spot-in', 'order', 'generate', 'emotion', 'very', 'few', 'factors', 'can', 'be', 'utilized.Minor', 'Spoiler', 'Sadly', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'movie', 'what', 'being', 'true', 'classic', 'horrible', 'ending', 'Hitchcock', 'long', 'history', 'sub-par', 'endings', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'cream', 'crop', 'terms', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'screaming', 'character', 'resolution', 'one', 'NOTHING', 'literally', 'just', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'acceptable', 'back', '1940s', 'today', 'unforgivable.Overall', 'though', 'Lifeboat', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'easily', 'worthy', 'four-stars', 'Had', 'offered', 'bit', 'resolution', 'could', 'have', 'rocketed', 'top', 'Hitchcock', 'filmography', 'just', 'solid', 'effort', 'one', 'key', 'area']",Lifeboat The Hitchcock Collection  VHS
