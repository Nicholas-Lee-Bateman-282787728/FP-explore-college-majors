Neither my wife or I liked much about it.  There is a lot of teen smoking, sex, violence and incessant use of the 'F-word.'  The story of guilt by a sibling for the loss of a younger sibling could have been a great story.  However the bad language and the 'cutsiness' of multiple, constantly changing pictures makes it not worth the effort.

1157898,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0017VG5XM,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I completely understand why someone would despise the Tracey Fragments- remember the introduction to the Brady Bunch when you'd see the nine faces of each family member on screen at once?  Each family member appeared on screen at the same time, all smiling and pretending to look at each other while stuck inside their screen-box, so to speak.Imagine a movie attempting to put together a storyline around nothing but constantly revolving screens?  Imagine if the Brady Bunch intro kept showing different pictures for over 70 minutes straight and tried telling a story THAT way?  Wouldn't it be hard to follow?The answer is yes, BUT with patience, you will eventually learn to adjust to this type of film-making.Yes, for the first 30 minutes, I had a *really* hard time understanding what was going on as Ellen Page's character was running all over the place, getting picked on at school, coming across as somewhat psychotic.  It definitely took me some time to piece together what was actually taking place before my confused eyes.To be totally honest, for most of the movie I had a tough time knowing what was supposed to be ""right here and now"" and what was supposed to be the main character's flashbacks involving her younger brother.  Sometimes it got really confusing to the point I was totally lost.But once I adjusted to the rather odd way the film was put together (as I said, the entire film is comprised of nothing but numerous miniature screen-blocks all appearing at the same time and trying to piece together a storyline) I eventually got used to it.Seriously, the comparison to the Brady Bunch introduction is the best way to describe how the entire movie flows for someone who might not be sure.  You've been warned because this is definitely NOT for everyone.Let me give another example- while looking at the screen, one small block on the top left corner of the screen might show a horse standing around, another small block on the top right of the screen might show Ellen's father sitting around at the dinner table, and another medium-sized block might appear on the bottom of the screen showing Ellen's character doing something.ALL these things appear on screen at the same exact time, and two seconds later each scene might change into something completely different.It begs the question ""Which screen block should I be following?""  Well, I've been following the biggest one that appears on screen and ignoring the rest of them.  Well not ""ignore""- but not give them as much attention as the bigger ones.However, watching this movie a second time might offer a much more rewarding experience.  Who knows?Why was the film produced this way?  To show how ""frgmented"" Ellen's troubled teenage character really was throughout the movie.  You see, she was involved in a very tragic circumstance with her brother disappearing suddenly and tragically.  The film shows the events that lead up to how it happened, and how she tries to cope with it.Mentally Ellen's character is really messed up, so she goes on her own adventure (not a happy one) and meets several people, some of which aren't as nice as they say they are.  If anything, this movie shows how messed up and unreliable people can be.The storyline is honestly not THAT confusing to follow- it's just the tricky way it was presented that makes it seem harder to follow than it really is.  You'll understand plenty of things that are taking place, but some things might leave you sitting there scratching your head.Like I said before, the story won me over by the end once I made the necessary adjustment to the tricky presentation.  I can see myself watching future movies in a similar style.  I think it's a kind of unique film making strategy that just needs time and patience in order to get used to it.Overall, Ellen's character is always a delight to watch, and she definitely didn't disappoint here.  Enjoyable, moving storyline, and worth watching.",4,well I liked it,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,3931,"['completely', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'despise', 'Tracey', 'Fragments-', 'remember', 'introduction', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'when', ""'d"", 'see', 'nine', 'family', 'member', 'screen', 'once', 'family', 'member', 'appeared', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'smiling', 'pretending', 'look', 'other', 'stuck', 'screen-box', 'so', 'speak.Imagine', 'movie', 'attempting', 'put', 'together', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'constantly', 'revolving', 'screens', 'Imagine', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'intro', 'kept', 'showing', 'different', 'pictures', '70', 'minutes', 'straight', 'tried', 'telling', 'story', 'way', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'answer', 'yes', 'BUT', 'patience', 'will', 'eventually', 'learn', 'adjust', 'type', 'film-making.Yes', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'had', '*really*', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'character', 'was', 'running', 'place', 'getting', 'picked', 'school', 'coming', 'somewhat', 'psychotic', 'definitely', 'took', 'time', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'confused', 'eyes.To', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'most', 'movie', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'right', 'here', 'now', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'flashbacks', 'involving', 'younger', 'brother', 'got', 'really', 'confusing', 'point', 'was', 'totally', 'lost.But', 'once', 'adjusted', 'rather', 'odd', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'said', 'entire', 'film', 'comprised', 'nothing', 'numerous', 'miniature', 'screen-blocks', 'appearing', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'storyline', 'eventually', 'got', 'used', 'it.Seriously', 'comparison', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'introduction', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'how', 'entire', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'everyone.Let', 'give', 'example-', 'looking', 'screen', 'one', 'small', 'block', 'top', 'left', 'corner', 'screen', 'might', 'show', 'horse', 'standing', 'around', 'small', 'block', 'top', 'right', 'screen', 'might', 'show', 'Ellen', 'father', 'sitting', 'around', 'dinner', 'table', 'medium-sized', 'block', 'might', 'appear', 'bottom', 'screen', 'showing', 'Ellen', 'character', 'doing', 'something.ALL', 'things', 'appear', 'screen', 'same', 'exact', 'time', 'two', 'seconds', 'later', 'scene', 'might', 'change', 'something', 'completely', 'different.It', 'question', 'Which', 'screen', 'block', 'should', 'be', 'following', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'biggest', 'one', 'screen', 'ignoring', 'rest', 'Well', 'not', 'ignore', 'not', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'bigger', 'ones.However', 'watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'might', 'offer', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'Who', 'Why', 'was', 'film', 'produced', 'way', 'show', 'how', 'frgmented', 'Ellen', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'character', 'really', 'was', 'movie', 'see', 'was', 'involved', 'very', 'tragic', 'circumstance', 'brother', 'disappearing', 'suddenly', 'tragically', 'film', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'how', 'happened', 'how', 'cope', 'it.Mentally', 'Ellen', 'character', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'own', 'adventure', 'not', 'happy', 'one', 'several', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'nice', 'say', 'are', 'anything', 'movie', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'unreliable', 'people', 'can', 'be.The', 'storyline', 'honestly', 'not', 'confusing', 'follow-', 'just', 'tricky', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'seem', 'harder', 'follow', 'really', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'plenty', 'things', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'things', 'might', 'leave', 'sitting', 'there', 'scratching', 'head.Like', 'said', 'story', 'won', 'over', 'end', 'once', 'made', 'necessary', 'adjustment', 'tricky', 'presentation', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'future', 'movies', 'similar', 'style', 'think', 'kind', 'unique', 'film', 'making', 'strategy', 'just', 'time', 'patience', 'order', 'get', 'used', 'it.Overall', 'Ellen', 'character', 'always', 'delight', 'watch', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'Enjoyable', 'moving', 'storyline', 'worth', 'watching']",The Tracey Fragments
1157899,ABUZT5MJQZZP3,B0017VG5XM,blu-rays,"[0, 0]","""Something's Missing.""Ellen Page stars in this bizarre 2008 drama. Tracey goes on a ""journey"" to find her lost brother who thinks he's a dog. Her parents think she needs therapy, when she believes she's not the one who needs it. She is just lonely, she has no friends and made fun of at school - mostly because of her breast size. Tracey is sitting in the back of a bus, wearing a shower curtain and nothing underneath, just to find her brother and tell us her story.This movie is very interesting, it's not nearly as good as Ellen's other work like Juno and Whip It, but it's still worth watching. Ellen Page's performance is great as always, the movie was just a little much. The movie was filmed in fourteen days, while it took nine months to edit, which is obvious why it took so long.

1157907,ABF9TML1GLCJ6,B0017VG5XM,Luca,"[48, 57]","A fierce, stark, implosive crawl through the adolescent pscyhe of a tortured 16 year old, inimical to her sorroundings and wrung to desolation by her temerity. Maureen Medved's eerie expose' of a rape victim's fragile self-desecrating self is redrawn by the Canadian author herself, with the complicitous and postmodern applications of director Bruce McDonald. The plot does not cover much ground, but that which it does range over it digs deep within. The warped sense of intimacy that we see Ellen Page's leading character tarry within is portrayed with such a vivid, terrific and terrifying virulence that we see before our very eyes the perils that it promises. The loneliness and alienation is confided to us by the mere strains of personality that Tracey Berkowitz betrays in her gall, a reactive toughnes within which tracey fenced herself while coiling about her the trimmings of a barbed wire.The movie disorients and bounces, tatters and titters, fidgets in a continuous flourish of images that synchronically and diachronically impose themselves on the screen in adjecent, fading and overlapping fragments. The pattern of the narrative is sporadic and laden with the logic of a psyche that cannot make sense of what it is suffering, as much as it caves within this same pain for fear that anger and madness have the best of her. How stirring to watch the most talented young artist working today engaged in a production of such an entrancing livid urgency. Ellen Page shows us here why she may very well be the best ever. Yes I said it, she is that good. Incredibly so; and if she was showered with awards and applause for Juno, here she deserve nothing short of awe.The movie differs in elemental ways from the novel it adopts its script from. The blizzard, the rape scene and the ridicule Tracey is subject to at school is dealt with in a very different reality. It actually adds a dimension to the narrative. Musings and dreamy aspirations are thwarted and tentaizingly strewn about the screen to echo the thoughts of a girl who is gearing to meet her fate as if by choice. Her parents are more sympathetic but insensitive and disruptive, if not altogether psychologically and emotionally violent all the same. The performences of Ari Cohen and Julian Richings are compelling, animated and free of the predicament of being cast in roles of such a perforating indiffference. Thinkfilms takes a risk in this production, for the topic of adolescent rape is somewhat of a taboo, especially if depicted in such realist and matter-of fact terms. The psychology is drawn about with bursts of anger and surreal sessions with a stone-faced therapist that in a void of whiteness delivers an insatiable array of innuendos, particles of a methodology that arrests its purpose as it seems incapable of offering a dialogue to a tormented mind. The soliloquies and voice-overs of the leading character are effective and demonstrative, often slurring through the scenes and designating a tentative memory double guessing itself. The frustration of being tit-less, an ""it"" according to her classmates, is a wound inflicted on Tracey too debilitating for even her feigned callousness. She carries herself as if burping lava sliming along announcing the eruption that never happens full force. A throttle that will release tension in a rape scene where she fantasizes she is making love with her boyfriend. She will at a later time while addressing us, on a bus running from reality, even claim that her rapist was actually her lover, several frames before we come to fully realize the truth of things. She insists that he ""put his c*** in me and then said I love you, exactly in that order."" How painful to recall that phrase. She is fearless indeed, but the tenderness is so pervasive we want to reach out to her and embrace her with a tight hold that may provoke her to at least surmise as possible that someone cares about her. The fragments of the story are shuffled with the overriding narrative of Tracey's brother Sonny's absence. She tells us she has not so much as run away as gone to retrieve her brother. This may function as an allegorical device if we run that route. Sonny disappears in conjunction with the rape scene, which I must add is innocent in its graphic covertness, but more powerful because of it. Do not have a minor watch this movie! It is too much even for mature audiences. But if art is a means to insights this movie succeeds admirably. It is a viewing that will haunt you more than any horror flick could ever wish to.The emotional starkness inscribes a feel of verisimilitude that is quite unique. The language is rouch and vulgar, but necessarily so.

1157909,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0017VG5XM,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Before her ""Juno"" fame Ellen Page was willing to take all kinds of chances as she followed the career path of Thora Birch from mainstream family entertainment to more cutting edge stuff. ""The Tracey Fragments"" (2007) was her last film before ""Juno"" and was like appearing in somebody's limited budget student film. Imagine your basic ahead of the curve student writing a somewhat ""bent"" screenplay, an inexperienced director turning Page loose to interpret her character without the help of acting for the camera direction, and the entire film class piling into the computer lab to slice and dice the thing in post-production hoping that thousands of hours of digital editing can add some value to the minimalist production.If the idea sounds like fun it probably was; and the end product should please its narrow target audience of film buffs, Page fans, and assorted off-kilter types. ""The Tracey Fragments"" is a blend of ""Ghost World"" (2001) and ""Gummo"" (1997), imagine a dumbed-down Enid (Birch) transplanted to Xenia, Ohio.This coming-of-age story is self-indulgent; with a screenplay chock full of symbolism, a chopped up time-line, and frame-in-frame effects (can you say ""fragments"") that call attention to themselves. But in this case it is not a bad thing; if you don't find the whole package entertaining you can just focus on the inventive style and on what it tells you about film theory and how viewers expect to read a film.Tracey Berkowitz (the slack-jawed title character) has a secret. She seems to have misplaced her little brother Sonny and the film elliptically reveals the story of Sonny's disappearance and Tracey's miserable existance; with the disparate story fragments connected by her odyssey around town in a bus. But film conventions are not followed and it is impossible to tell which segments are real and which ones are figments of Tracey's imagination. Ultimately the viewer is left to wonder if there ever was a Sonny; that he may simply represent Tracey's loss-of-innocence in what may otherwise be a very traditional coming-of-age tale. By the end we see that her coping mechanism seems to have worked and they go out on a character who probably has come to terms with her reluctant nudge into an adult world; a world that she already finds disappointing but one which will be tolerable because of her low expectations.Then again, what do I know?

Perhaps most interesting is how the mood of the film, helped tremendously by the lighting and color choices for the scenes, perfectly captures the feeling of being a teenager caught up in the intertwined mess of school bullying and family dysfunction, thrust into their own head to fantasize about a way out.  Maybe it's too stark and bleak for some viewers.  To express the trauma that Tracey is dealing with and reacting to, and how her mind is processing all of it and struggling to assert a self in the midst of it... to present this on screen with such raw feeling is a beautiful, albeit brutal, achievement.  I feel very strongly that the artistic choices in how the film is presented, it's broken sense of chronology, the collage and fragmented visuals, the narrative slipping through different forms of memory and blurring between 'fact' and 'fiction', all of it brings the spectator into the psyche of our protagonist, to break down the third person perspective close to experience the story as it unfolds in the mind of Tracey.

All of Tracy's angst comes from the fact that her parents are too busy arguing with each other to look after her or her brother, so she has to take care of them both. Her parents send her to a psychiatrist who she hates. After they lock her in the house for three months she escapes and starts riding the buses where she meets all kinds of creepy men who want to have sex with her.

1157916,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0017VG5XM,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","If it's true, as Marshall McLuhan has suggested, that the medium is indeed the message, then ""The Tracey Fragments"" proves that theory in spades.  This highly idiosyncratic work has as its focal point ""Tracey Berkowitz - 15 - just another girl who hates herself"" - a description that comes straight from the mouth of Ms. Berkowitz herself.  Tracey is a deeply unhappy youngster who hates her (admittedly horrible) parents, is terrorized by all the ""cool"" kids in school for insufficient mammary-gland development, spends most of her nights riding the subway, hooks up with a psychotic lowlife who turns out to be a drug dealer, and searches for her little brother whom she's hypnotized into thinking he's a dog and who goes missing by a frozen river when she`s supposed to be watching out for him.  To help mitigate her misery, Tracey also dreams of having a relationship with a brooding ""emo"" bad boy at school and fantasizes that she is a famous, universally worshipped rock star.But it is not Tracey's story that is of primary interest here; rather it's the cut-and-paste filmmaking style director Bruce McDonald has employed to create a sense of fragmentation and dislocation in the viewer - intended, obviously, to mirror the highly chaotic and disordered nature of Tracey`s world and life.  With rare exceptions, the screen is occupied by as few as two and as many as a dozen shots at a time, often portraying the same sequence from slightly different angles or at slightly different moments in time, or portraying thematically related scenes simultaneously.  The question inevitably arises, is the approach effective in what it's trying to accomplish or does it serve as a distancing device for those of us who are trying to enter into Tracey's mind and world.  I imagine that different viewers will come to varying verdicts on that point.Personally, I appreciate what McDonald is trying to do here more than I admire it.  ""The Tracey Fragments,"" which Maureen Medved has adapted from her own novel, offers many probing insights into the subject of teenage angst, particularly as regards the tremendous pressure modern young people are put under to ""measure up"" and conform to some arbitrarily agreed-upon social standard.  And ""Juno""'s Ellen Page gives a stunning performance as the young woman caught in an ever-tightening web of self-hatred (this is, in many ways, the darker side of ""Juno,"" and Page is much less mannered in this role).But, frankly, the movie probably would have been more moving and involving without all the migraine-inducing imagery which succeeds mainly in throwing us out of the story.  In fact, there is only one scene in which the split screen technique actually serves a narrative purpose - and that is when Tracey is hiding behind a curtain while her drug-dealer friend is being savagely beaten by the irate boss to whom he owes money.  Most of the rest of the time, the approach feels more like a gimmick designed to separate this film from the rest of the ""distressed-teen indie"" pack than an artistically viable choice in its own right.Still, if you can get past all the artiness and visual distraction, you might just find in ""The Tracey Fragments"" a thoughtful, sensitive and ineffably sad glimpse into a young woman's heart.",3,gimmicky but sometimes compelling indie teen drama,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,3267,"['true', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'suggested', 'medium', 'indeed', 'message', 'then', 'Tracey', 'Fragments', 'theory', 'spades', 'highly', 'idiosyncratic', 'work', 'focal', 'point', 'Tracey', 'Berkowitz', '15', 'just', 'girl', 'who', 'description', 'straight', 'mouth', 'Ms.', 'Berkowitz', 'Tracey', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'youngster', 'who', 'admittedly', 'horrible', 'parents', 'terrorized', 'cool', 'kids', 'school', 'insufficient', 'mammary-gland', 'development', 'most', 'nights', 'riding', 'subway', 'up', 'psychotic', 'lowlife', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'drug', 'dealer', 'searches', 'little', 'brother', 'whom', 'hypnotized', 'thinking', 'dog', 'who', 'missing', 'frozen', 'river', 'when', 's', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'out', 'help', 'mitigate', 'misery', 'Tracey', 'also', 'having', 'relationship', 'brooding', 'emo', 'bad', 'boy', 'school', 'famous', 'universally', 'worshipped', 'rock', 'star.But', 'not', 'Tracey', 'story', 'primary', 'interest', 'here', 'rather', 'cut-and-paste', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'director', 'Bruce', 'McDonald', 'employed', 'create', 'sense', 'fragmentation', 'dislocation', 'viewer', 'intended', 'obviously', 'mirror', 'highly', 'chaotic', 'disordered', 'nature', 'Tracey', 's', 'world', 'life', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'screen', 'occupied', 'as', 'few', 'two', 'as', 'many', 'dozen', 'shots', 'time', 'often', 'portraying', 'same', 'sequence', 'slightly', 'different', 'angles', 'slightly', 'different', 'moments', 'time', 'portraying', 'thematically', 'related', 'scenes', 'simultaneously', 'question', 'inevitably', 'arises', 'approach', 'effective', 'what', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'serve', 'distancing', 'device', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'enter', 'Tracey', 'mind', 'world', 'imagine', 'different', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'varying', 'verdicts', 'point.Personally', 'appreciate', 'what', 'McDonald', 'trying', 'do', 'here', 'more', 'admire', 'Tracey', 'Fragments', 'Maureen', 'Medved', 'adapted', 'own', 'novel', 'many', 'probing', 'insights', 'subject', 'teenage', 'angst', 'particularly', 'regards', 'tremendous', 'pressure', 'modern', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'measure', 'up', 'conform', 'arbitrarily', 'agreed-upon', 'social', 'standard', 'Juno', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'stunning', 'performance', 'young', 'woman', 'caught', 'ever-tightening', 'web', 'self-hatred', 'many', 'ways', 'darker', 'side', 'Juno', 'Page', 'much', 'less', 'mannered', 'role', '.But', 'frankly', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'moving', 'involving', 'migraine-inducing', 'imagery', 'mainly', 'throwing', 'story', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'split', 'screen', 'technique', 'actually', 'narrative', 'purpose', 'when', 'Tracey', 'hiding', 'curtain', 'drug-dealer', 'friend', 'being', 'savagely', 'beaten', 'irate', 'boss', 'whom', 'money', 'Most', 'rest', 'time', 'approach', 'more', 'gimmick', 'designed', 'separate', 'film', 'rest', 'distressed-teen', 'indie', 'pack', 'artistically', 'viable', 'choice', 'own', 'right.Still', 'can', 'get', 'artiness', 'visual', 'distraction', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'Tracey', 'Fragments', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'ineffably', 'sad', 'glimpse', 'young', 'woman', 'heart']",The Tracey Fragments

The multi-screen editing is done so well and on so many different levels that the ""tieing of everything up"" at the end signals not only an emergence of real creative genius in what is delivered to the viewer, but i think it indicates a real respect for the viewer that is often so lacking in our  movie business.No movie ever made makes a clearer case regarding adolescent ""puppy-love"" than the car scene between she and ""Billy Zero."" The cost for this mistake? Well, that's the movie, isn't it? I think that the car scene should be shown in every high school.The less-than-adequate psychiatrist was also useful, as we need more movies to show the 'feet of clay' that our psychiatric profession has. Tracy is told ""It's OK to be angry,"" so she starts shrieking hatefully at the shrink, who almost breaks into tears; necesitating Tracy's fervent apologies. In this movie, we are not spoon-fed, but as we ""get it"" - and as we get more of it (OK, I watched it a few times), a greater respect develops regarding its power. I think in the years to come we will look back and say ""that's where split-screen really started.""

1157918,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B0017VG5XM,The Wickerman,"[3, 9]","A few years ago, I saw a movie called ""Hulk"". You probably remember this movie, even if you don't particularly want to.  It was Ang Lee's unbelievably awful attempt at a superhero movie, and chief among its many faults was the excruciating overuse of split screens.  Having been subjected to that abomination of a film, I have now reached the point where the very sight of a split screen is enough to make me feel as though I'm about to turn into the hulk myself.  I mean, it really just makes my blood boil, honestly.So, this is where Bruce McDonald's latest film, ""The Tracey Fragments"", comes in.  This is a movie that rivals and maybe even surpasses ""Hulk"" in the blatant overuse of this oh-so-dreaded effect.  However, I can at least see here that it was done with the intent of symbolizing the sort of stream of consciousness nature of the story and its main character, Tracey.  Still, regardless of whatever it's supposed to represent, or whatever artistic merit it may or may not have, it largely serves no purpose other than to be really distracting and really annoying.  Little tip for would-be filmmakers regarding split screens: Less is more, and none is even better.Fortunately, this movie does have a few redeeming qualities.  Obviously it doesn't need to be said again that Ellen Page is amazing, but well, I guess I did anyway.  She is fantastic as Tracey, a somewhat disturbed young girl from an extremely dysfunctional family who ends up on a surreal journey through the streets to find her younger brother, who has run away from home.  Her performance is perfectly gritty and intense, tempered with just the right amount of dark humor.  On its own, the story is compelling (albeit bizarre, and not without its flaws), but I think it's her stellar acting that (almost) saves this mess of a movie.  She always manages to bring so many different dimensions to every character, and here is no exception.Still, the story is not without its flaws.  It skips around chronologically, which isn't too much of a problem most of the time, although it does get rather disorienting more often than not.  The whole thing plays out like a mix between a weird dream and a bad acid trip, and it never really reaches any sort of satisfactory resolution.  In the end, the viewer is left with more questions than answers, and at a mere 77 minutes of runtime, it just feels like it was thrown together in a hurry.  Still, it does definitely have its moments, and it benefits from an excellent score by Broken Social Scene.But yeah, those damn split screens!  I don't know, it's a personal thing, I guess.  Ang Lee beat this effect into my brain until I really just wanted to ""Crouching Tiger"" kick him right in the face.  I for one hope this isn't going to be in a continuing trend in films.  They call it the ""comic book effect"", or whatever, but if you ask me, I think if you want the experience of reading a comic book, you should READ A COMIC BOOK!!!  Anyway, sorry for the rant, but if you can get around the overkill of this, you might find some enjoyment here.  It's a decent effort, despite its many flaws.",3,I blame Ang Lee...,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,3112,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'movie', 'called', 'Hulk', 'probably', 'remember', 'movie', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'was', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'unbelievably', 'awful', 'attempt', 'superhero', 'movie', 'chief', 'many', 'faults', 'was', 'excruciating', 'overuse', 'split', 'screens', 'Having', 'been', 'subjected', 'abomination', 'film', 'have', 'now', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'very', 'sight', 'split', 'screen', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', ""'m"", 'turn', 'hulk', 'mean', 'really', 'just', 'blood', 'boil', 'honestly.So', 'where', 'Bruce', 'McDonald', 'latest', 'film', 'Tracey', 'Fragments', 'movie', 'rivals', 'maybe', 'even', 'Hulk', 'blatant', 'overuse', 'oh-so-dreaded', 'effect', 'However', 'can', 'least', 'see', 'here', 'was', 'done', 'intent', 'symbolizing', 'sort', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'nature', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Tracey', 'Still', 'regardless', 'whatever', 'supposed', 'represent', 'artistic', 'merit', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'largely', 'purpose', 'other', 'be', 'really', 'distracting', 'really', 'annoying', 'Little', 'tip', 'would-be', 'filmmakers', 'regarding', 'split', 'screens', 'Less', 'more', 'none', 'even', 'better.Fortunately', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'said', 'again', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'amazing', 'well', 'guess', 'did', 'anyway', 'fantastic', 'Tracey', 'somewhat', 'disturbed', 'young', 'girl', 'extremely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'up', 'surreal', 'journey', 'streets', 'find', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'gritty', 'intense', 'tempered', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'dark', 'humor', 'own', 'story', 'compelling', 'bizarre', 'not', 'flaws', 'think', 'stellar', 'acting', 'almost', 'mess', 'movie', 'always', 'bring', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'dimensions', 'character', 'here', 'exception.Still', 'story', 'not', 'flaws', 'chronologically', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'problem', 'most', 'time', 'get', 'rather', 'disorienting', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'mix', 'weird', 'dream', 'bad', 'acid', 'trip', 'never', 'really', 'sort', 'satisfactory', 'resolution', 'end', 'viewer', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'mere', '77', 'minutes', 'runtime', 'just', 'feels', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'hurry', 'Still', 'definitely', 'have', 'moments', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'score', 'Broken', 'Social', 'Scene.But', 'yeah', 'damn', 'split', 'screens', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'personal', 'thing', 'guess', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'beat', 'effect', 'brain', 'really', 'just', 'wanted', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'kick', 'right', 'face', 'one', 'hope', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'continuing', 'trend', 'films', 'call', 'comic', 'book', 'effect', 'whatever', 'ask', 'think', 'want', 'experience', 'reading', 'comic', 'book', 'should', 'READ', 'A', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'Anyway', 'sorry', 'rant', 'can', 'get', 'overkill', 'might', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'decent', 'effort', 'many', 'flaws']",The Tracey Fragments

Indeed, her performance is nothing short of amazing which is pretty much what I have come to expect. She delivers consistently to a strong storyline about a teenager who struggles with life and her place in it. Everything that would make a great film is present in this one with one very important exception. When the film reaches us, the buying and interested public, it comes with split screens that never stop. I stayed with the movie from beginning to end and found myself hoping that the split screen stuff would end after the opening credits but it did not. The presentation of the story gets diluted by this rather disjointed method of delivery. Rather than enhancing our understanding of what is going on and supporting the acting in a non-obtrusive way, the camera/split screen ""technique"" draws attention unto itself as if the film maker wanted to play a bigger role than that of the actors or for that matter, a bigger role than the story itself. What I am sure passes for art to the film maker is nothing more than a loud obtrusive person at a party where everyone is forced to accommodate the show off rather than to just enjoy the party. The storyline is forced upon us in an unpleasant array of screens which with a little work on the part of the audience, pieces the story together but does not afford an enjoyable experience all told. I felt like I had endured the movie at ending credits. The one positive element of The Tracey Fragments with which I walked away is the confidence that his method of presenting talented acting and a great story is not revolutionary. We won't be subjected to this kind of ego driven film making as a rule because it just doesn't work.
