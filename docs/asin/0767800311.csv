4544,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0767800311,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[11, 11]","You will not be able to determine that Gary Oldman's first film Nil by Mouth is an acted scripted film rather than a documentary.  A great film depicting a working class South London family shot in candid documentary  fashion.  We focus in on off the cuff conversations, a junkie's (Charlie  Creed-Miles) endless search for a fix, a raging alcoholic (Ray Winstone who  also starred in Tim Roth's debut The War Zone), and their 4 generation  family.  As I said I had trouble grasping that the dialogue was actually  scripted it's so naturalistic.  Such a refreshing contrast to the Hollywood  stuff so far removed from naturalistic dialogue it has little to do with  reality.I always considered the soap opera Eastenders to be  worthless...kind of weird that the same kind of working class Londoners can  be depicted with such depth and power as Nil By Mouth has.Finally,  the psychology behind Ray (Winstone) is delved into to the extent that this  brutal guy retains humanity (unlike the Hollywood counterpart which would  be a mindlessly cruel non-human monster).  It's important to get to the  root causes of such things and this great film does (by intentional  implication).",5,1000000 times more intelligent and powerful than Eastenders,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,1179,"['will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'first', 'film', 'Nil', 'Mouth', 'acted', 'scripted', 'film', 'rather', 'documentary', 'great', 'film', 'depicting', 'working', 'class', 'South', 'London', 'family', 'shot', 'candid', 'documentary', 'fashion', 'focus', 'cuff', 'conversations', 'junkie', 'Charlie', 'Creed-Miles', 'endless', 'search', 'fix', 'raging', 'alcoholic', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'debut', 'War', 'Zone', '4', 'generation', 'family', 'said', 'had', 'trouble', 'grasping', 'dialogue', 'was', 'actually', 'scripted', 'so', 'naturalistic', 'refreshing', 'contrast', 'Hollywood', 'stuff', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'naturalistic', 'dialogue', 'little', 'do', 'reality.I', 'always', 'considered', 'soap', 'opera', 'Eastenders', 'be', 'worthless', 'kind', 'weird', 'same', 'kind', 'working', 'class', 'Londoners', 'can', 'be', 'depicted', 'such', 'depth', 'power', 'Nil', 'Mouth', 'has.Finally', 'psychology', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'delved', 'extent', 'brutal', 'guy', 'humanity', 'Hollywood', 'counterpart', 'would', 'be', 'mindlessly', 'cruel', 'non-human', 'monster', 'important', 'get', 'root', 'causes', 'such', 'things', 'great', 'film', 'intentional', 'implication']",Nil By Mouth VHS
4545,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,0767800311,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[2, 3]","by Dane Youssef""Nil By Mouth"" is the very first film written and directed by the great Gary Oldman, a seasoned veteran actor who has still yet to give a bad performance. Oldman grew up in the poorest ghetto of South London, where this film takes place.And while this movie has been rumored and believed to be a semi-autobiography of Oldman's childhood and family (who wouldn't watch this movie and believe so?), Oldman himself has said that this is not him or his family.Hey, I believe him. Although he grew up in this environment, he was not directly in the line of fire, if you follow me.The film sets it's sights on a South London family that defines the term ""domestic unrest."" A woman, her husband, daughter, brother, their mother and grandmother. As well as the people outside their family who they are connected to.""Nil By Mouth"" represents many of the other families in South London, not Oldman's. The colorful cockney ways of the Great Britain. But more than anything, it's problem of casual brutal urban violence.We've seen many abusive types in movies--usually one-dimensional and sanitized. But ""Nil By Mouth"" refuses to white-wash. The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood star-vehicle allows this to be a real film-going experience.This movie wishes to illuminate. Not entertain or delude. This is ""slice-of-life,"" not escapist fantasy. I've told members of my family about it and they've given very mixed reactions. My father and sister disliked the dime-store production values and no-name actors. They asked me why I would rent such a bitter and hateful film. My mother says she has spent her life shunning this type of humanity and lives as if it does not really exist.""The Way Of The Ostrich.""This is one of those frightening on-screen performances in recent memory. Ray Winstone deserves high praise and immortalization for his acting here in the role of Ray. He seems to be one of those unsavory, brutal characters in movies that stay with us. Like Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence Of The Lambs,"" Like Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet,"" Like Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" this performance haunts us like a ghost. The scorned ghost of a murderer...There is a cringing moment in which Ray answers his wife's question as to why: ""I do it because I love you."" We cringe because his answer feels more familiar and common than it should.Ray is not merely an abusive drunk; he is a horrible bastard, always prone to violent outbursts. When his wife hangs out with a casual male acquaintance, he suspects that she may be having an affair and damn near kills her.Ray Winstone delivers a powerhouse performance in the role of Ray, a working-class man who loves his family, especially his daughter. But this man has demons. Demons that are so numerous and deep, they cannot be repressed. He can be a likeable, laid-back guy, like everyone else.But we see that without serious provocation, he instantly becomes raving and homicidal. A side that most movies (and people) tend to shy away from. He will make your blood run cold and near the end, make you cry.Kathy Burke, best known for her role on ""Absolutely Fabulous"" takes an enthralling dramatic turns as Valerie, Ray's wife who's sole purpose seems to be to keep the family strung together while putting up with her husband's monstrous outbursts, almost sadomasochistic ally. This is an unforgettable performance.Whenever there's someone like Ray, there's almost always someone like Mark. Mark is sort of a sidekick or cheerleader for Ray and his violently domestic antics. He seems to be something of a drama queen, hitching his trailer up to the pain in Ray's life. It perhaps gives him an excuse to explode and go ape-s**t the way he does. It's mentioned at one point that Mark himself was worked over by Ray's father---maybe this explains the tie that bond these two.Jamie Forman is effective as Ray's little right-hand man. Apparently, Forman himself is the son of a real-life legendary gangster in London.There are scenes where he shows the true symptoms of a violent criminal. I wonder... is the caustic streak of the father burning through the son? Jamie, unlike his old man has apparently chosen a more legal profession. Kudos for him.Is he just a great actor? Jamie may actually have some demons himself.And while Ray may be the black sheep of this family, all that really means is he's the blackest of the black. No one here is walking on water. Valerie smokes and drinks despite knowing full-well she's pregnant. No one around her really speaks up in protest about her indirect poisoning of her child.Valerie's little brother, Billy is a severe heroin addict. Despite the fact that he's occasionally allowed to sleep over at Ray and Valerie's, Ray even feeds him and gives him a banknote here and there, Billy steals a score of dope from their flat.You can only imagine how Ray takes to this. Billy is scorned, but although he is cast out, he still stays with his side of the family and even retaliates against Ray, stealing an irreplaceable family heirloom.After this, Billy is not really in trouble.He is all but dead.Billy is a severe junkie and spends a lot of time with his friends. And since Billy is a junkie, there's only one kind of clique of friends he can afford: more junkies.One of his pals, Danny is one of the movie's strangest characters. Danny is literally covered from head-to-toe with tattoos and body-piercing. He defines the term ""body art."" His whole body is like a big collage explosion.But he's not the one-dimensional freak/weirdo/thug we'd expect just by getting a quick glance at him. He shows compassion and even sweetness at time like all the other characters, even Ray.Nearly everyone drinks and smokes. Nearly everyone says ""f**k"" and ""c**t"" on a far more-than-regular basis. And their endless stream of profanity and brutal violent mistreatment of one another is like a sad testimony to how tragically pathetic they are.You can almost hear the violins playing on the soundtrack to each of their lives. They are the victims of their life, their family, their environment, each other and themselves.Oldman films using the now-traditional and all-too-common (but at the time, novel) hand-held camera technique and 16mm film, thus giving ""Nil By Mouth"" not the look of a polished, slick and lavish film, but raw, unkempt footage of very real life.The movie looks like a true documentary, the herky-jerky camerawork makes it look as if we're seeing everything from our own P.O.V. As if we're ""there, in the heat of the moment.""And we can't help but think about the little five-year old daughter and the unborn second child of Ray and Val, how their parents impact will undoubtedly shape them. It is an endless, vicious cycle of evil that shows no signs of breaking. And it is running rampantly throughout the world.This is just one of those movies that... after it's over, you want to do something... something to make things better.LITTLE TRIVIAL NOTES ON ""NIL BY MOUTH"": Unless you're somewhere in the European climate or at least Australian, you'd best hit ""closed captioning"" or ""subtitles"" if you want to understand so much as a damn line of dialouge. The thick cockney accents are almost indecipherable. They're so thick, you could choke on them. For me, it was almost like hearing morse code. The characters might as well have been speaking Chinese.SPECIAL NOTE: The title comes stems from a medical instruction in the hospital not to give a patient food or drink as they're about to go into surgery. The connection in that this movie makes with that title is poetically heart-breaking, like the rest of the film.danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]",5,Nil by mouth... something to say...,1204243200,"02 29,

4549,A3MW5OB6IMNQI7,0767800311,Hansol Lee,"[9, 10]","&quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; is a movie that takes its sweet time to get going. In the beginning, it's filled with too many characters and dialogues that don't seem very relevant. But once it gets going... Boy, does it ever get going. It's a brutally honest and disturbing look at domestic violence, drug abuse and poverty, and while it's very difficult to watch at times, it's also extremely gripping. The two leads, Kathy Burke and Ray Winstone, are absolutely phenomenal in portraying characters that are much more complex than just a victim and an abuser (the exchange between the apologetic Ray and angry Val after Ray had beaten up Val for the umpteenth time, and Ray's monologue about his own abusive father, are two of the most memorable and powerful movie moments in recent memory), and the supporting cast (including Gary Oldman's sister Laila Morse in her debut) is superb as well. I think the movie's subplot about Billy the junkie (&quot;Trainspotting&quot; without the humor, if you will) gets perhaps a little over developed though. It is integral to the main story line, but it becomes too distracting at times.Gary Oldman does a tremendous job in his directorial debut. The script seems very authentic, probably because most of the characters and the events in the movie are taken from his own experiences, and his cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; style (minus the shaky camera, thank God) suits the grittiness and honesty of the film extremely well.

4550,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,0767800311,Ian Phillips,"[2, 2]","Nil By Mouth (1997) immediately impresses just upon reading the cast list: the ever-excellent Ray Winstone in one of his finest, most intensifying roles, the wonderful Kathy Burke who yet again proves what a dynamic and versatile actor she is, Edna Dore, Laila Morse (now better known for her role as ""old"" Mo Slater in the BBC soap EastEnders), Charlie Creed-miles, Jamie Foreman, Chrissie Cotterill, Jon Morrison and Steve Sweeney. Fantastic, flawless cast - and in Ray Winstone and Kathy Burke's case, some of the finest British actors around. And, not forgetting of course, the stunning though brutally stark, compelling and startlingly powerful written screenplay by the critically-acclaimed Gary Oldman.The story depicts the grim tale of a dysfunctional family living in the South East of London, exploring how some of the characters survive and their decline into drug addiction, alcoholism, domestic violence and petty crime. Never once does Nil By Mouth strike a false chord. Infact you will constantly be on the edge of your seat just by Ray Winstones intensely frightening performance as a hopelessly drug-addicted, alchoholic, wife beater. Due to the stark realism, you feel in each and every scene, as though you are standing right next to these characters, just literally looking on in horror - like watching documentary realism. This is not least due to the extremely high standard of acting, the racing rhythm of the razor-sharp dialogue and Gary Oldman's impeccable direction. On top of that is an effective and somewhat haunting score by Eric Clapton! Perfect in every sense in its intended mood and ethos.Your heart will just go out, and jaw will hit the floor, to poor Kathy Burkes downtrodden character and the disturbingly real scene where Ray beats Kathy to the floor and kicks and punches her continually while she is heavily pregnant is just gut-wrenching and heart-rending. Due to Ray Winstone's powerful performance (as always the case with Mr.Winstone), you even manage to feel some empathy for the character, even in spite of the horrific beating he subjected his partner too. Clearly the years of endless drug and alcohol abuse had taken its toll. In one particularly endearing scene towards the end of the film, another dimension to the character is revealed, showing a more vulnreable side to Ray as he ponders on his life as a child where he was also subject to regular violent beatings by his parents. Not that that excuses anything but certainly the character is shrewdly structured to show exactly how Ray had gotten into this mental state, making it blatantly obvious that the continual drug and alcohol abuse, as often is the case, was to shield the pain he'd been suffering all these years. Occasionally you even get quick hints of his character wanting to somehow be a better, kinder person, but not really quite knowing how and sadly was difficult not to conclude that he'd reached a point beyond no return.Also of note in the cast is Charlie Creed-miles as Kathy Burkes, heroin-addicted brother and Jamie Foreman, who comes into his own as Ray's loyal sidekick and its too Jamie Foremans character that Ray reveals his deprived and abusive childhood.To watch how the characters interact, the fast, rolling dialogue that crackles along at a speedy pace with dry, dark humour, and some of the more powerful, horrifying incidents that take place, leave you endlessly fascinated. A credit to all concerned, especially to the explosive performances by Ray Winstone (my all-time acting hero) and Kathy Burke, and, of course, not least to Gary Oldmans riviting direction and screenplay.Ian PhillipsAugust 2009",5,"Ray Winstone in another stark, powerful drama",1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,3644,"['Nil', 'Mouth', '1997', 'immediately', 'just', 'reading', 'cast', 'list', 'ever-excellent', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'one', 'finest', 'most', 'intensifying', 'roles', 'wonderful', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'who', 'yet', 'again', 'what', 'dynamic', 'versatile', 'actor', 'Edna', 'Dore', 'Laila', 'Morse', 'now', 'better', 'known', 'role', 'old', 'Mo', 'Slater', 'BBC', 'soap', 'EastEnders', 'Charlie', 'Creed-miles', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'Chrissie', 'Cotterill', 'Jon', 'Morrison', 'Steve', 'Sweeney', 'Fantastic', 'flawless', 'cast', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'case', 'finest', 'British', 'actors', 'not', 'forgetting', 'course', 'stunning', 'brutally', 'stark', 'compelling', 'startlingly', 'powerful', 'written', 'screenplay', 'critically-acclaimed', 'Gary', 'Oldman.The', 'story', 'grim', 'tale', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'living', 'South', 'East', 'London', 'exploring', 'how', 'characters', 'survive', 'decline', 'drug', 'addiction', 'alcoholism', 'domestic', 'violence', 'petty', 'crime', 'Never', 'once', 'Nil', 'Mouth', 'strike', 'false', 'chord', 'Infact', 'will', 'constantly', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'just', 'Ray', 'Winstones', 'intensely', 'frightening', 'performance', 'hopelessly', 'drug-addicted', 'alchoholic', 'wife', 'beater', 'Due', 'stark', 'realism', 'feel', 'scene', 'are', 'standing', 'right', 'next', 'characters', 'just', 'literally', 'looking', 'horror', 'watching', 'documentary', 'realism', 'not', 'least', 'due', 'extremely', 'high', 'standard', 'acting', 'racing', 'rhythm', 'razor-sharp', 'dialogue', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'impeccable', 'direction', 'top', 'effective', 'somewhat', 'haunting', 'score', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Perfect', 'sense', 'intended', 'mood', 'ethos.Your', 'heart', 'will', 'just', 'go', 'out', 'jaw', 'will', 'hit', 'floor', 'poor', 'Kathy', 'Burkes', 'downtrodden', 'character', 'disturbingly', 'real', 'scene', 'where', 'Ray', 'Kathy', 'floor', 'kicks', 'continually', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'just', 'gut-wrenching', 'heart-rending', 'Due', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'powerful', 'performance', 'always', 'case', 'Mr.Winstone', 'even', 'manage', 'feel', 'empathy', 'character', 'even', 'spite', 'horrific', 'beating', 'subjected', 'partner', 'too', 'Clearly', 'years', 'endless', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'had', 'taken', 'toll', 'one', 'particularly', 'endearing', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'dimension', 'character', 'revealed', 'showing', 'more', 'vulnreable', 'side', 'Ray', 'life', 'child', 'where', 'was', 'also', 'subject', 'regular', 'violent', 'beatings', 'parents', 'Not', 'anything', 'certainly', 'character', 'shrewdly', 'structured', 'show', 'exactly', 'how', 'Ray', 'had', 'gotten', 'mental', 'state', 'making', 'blatantly', 'continual', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'often', 'case', 'was', 'shield', 'pain', ""'d"", 'been', 'suffering', 'years', 'Occasionally', 'even', 'get', 'quick', 'hints', 'character', 'wanting', 'somehow', 'be', 'better', 'kinder', 'person', 'not', 'really', 'quite', 'knowing', 'how', 'sadly', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'conclude', ""'d"", 'reached', 'point', 'return.Also', 'note', 'cast', 'Charlie', 'Creed-miles', 'Kathy', 'Burkes', 'heroin-addicted', 'brother', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'who', 'own', 'Ray', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'too', 'Jamie', 'Foremans', 'character', 'Ray', 'deprived', 'abusive', 'childhood.To', 'watch', 'how', 'characters', 'interact', 'fast', 'rolling', 'dialogue', 'along', 'speedy', 'pace', 'dry', 'dark', 'humour', 'more', 'powerful', 'horrifying', 'incidents', 'take', 'place', 'leave', 'endlessly', 'fascinated', 'credit', 'concerned', 'especially', 'explosive', 'performances', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'all-time', 'acting', 'hero', 'Kathy', 'Burke', 'course', 'not', 'least', 'Gary', 'Oldmans', 'riviting', 'direction', 'screenplay.Ian', 'PhillipsAugust', '2009']",Nil By Mouth VHS

Despite having very unsettling material, it is a movie that can be enjoyed for it's raw and unappoligetic approach.Basically the film is about a family in South London. Their everyday life is not exactly the sunniest (to say the very least). The focal characters are Billy, a teenager with a horrible heroine addiction, Ray, a middle age man, who drinks and fights and beats his pregnant wife, Valerie, Billy's sister. And that is what the film is about.This an interesting film. It is very anti-Hollywood. There is no real narrative structure to it. The film begins and ends with the characters being presented at no particularly significant places in their lives. Their is no rising action, or climax, but this is not to say that this film does not deliver several defining moments for the characters. None harder to watch then Ray beating Valerie and then destroying their flat in a drunken rage.The performances in this film are amazing. Oldman has presented them in their environment, without judgement, and the results are so effective. Especially Ray Winstone and Kathy Burke (Ray and Valerie). These two actors deliver some of the most devastatingly realistic characters strugling internally, against their family, and against each other. The supporting cast does not miss a beat either.Gary Oldman wrote and directed this film. He is from South London and curiously dedicated the film to his own father.  This raisied an eyebrow from me.

4553,A1DVAODGX47GJL,0767800311,mojo_navigator,"[5, 7]","British cinema is thoroughly disappointing at the best of times.  Its product seems to consist of either unbearably lightweight pap or wooden and earnest social commentary that bores with its incessant sermonising.  Occasionally (i.e. once a generation) you may get a film like The Long Good Friday but these are far and few between.  Seeing the average British film would make anyone think that here is a nation that hasn't a clue how to make a picture.To those who might be of that opinion, I cannot recommend watching Nil By Mouth highly enough.  It is a work of astonishing intensity and visceral power.  It is quite unlike any British film that I've ever seen and so real and true is its portrayal of London working class life that it felt more like a '70s Pacino/De Niro movie like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Panic In Needle Park"" than what we have to come to expect from the British Film industry.Although Nil By Mouth is a multi-layered work that has many sub-themes, to my mind there are two central ones.  The first is that of a portrait of a working class community in London, done with force, power, crude humor and gritty realism.  Why do I often encounter people in London who behave exactly like this but seldom see this reflected in British cinema?  It's probably because of the highly conservative nature of the film industry in that country and hats off to Gary Oldman for getting this truly excellent screenplay out amidst such an environment.The second main theme is that of a man with a pathological inability to express himself in any way other than violence and brutality and who despite his worst urges still manages to come to some sort of understanding as to the source of his unremmitting ability to cause pain to those closest to him.  I could single out Ray Winstone's performance but that would be unfair to the rest of the cast who all excel equally at providing thoroughly real and believable characters and situations. And Nil By Mouth's intensity is such that you find yourself captivated from start to finish.  By the end, you really feel that you've lived their lives and suffered and celebrated along with these grungy roughnecks.As for the quality of the DVD itself, I think it's pretty unimpressive and obviously not much care was taken with the transfer.

This may very well be one of the most dark, depressing,and brilliant films I have ever seen.It's directed by Gary Oldman (known for his acting, or overacting, in Dracula, The Professional etc,) and he proves to be a great director. The movie is about a family with Ray Winstone as Ray, the father/husband of the household and Kathy Burke as Valerie. Ray is a working class lout who abuses both drugs and his wife. His son Billy (played by Charlie Creed-Miles) is a herion addict on the streets after his father nearly bites his nose off for stealing his smack. Ray is at times both scary and pittiful, mean and sad, nasty and pathetic. He intertwines these roles so well that at time's you can't tell where he is coming from, or what he'll do next. Valerie is just a simple wife who is just trying to keep her head down so she doesn't get it taken off. However even she is not imune to Ray's violent temper over nothing. In one very vicious scene she is attacked by Ray and although the beating take's place off-camera it still sends chills.I must warn anyone who wants to watch this movie the it contains more bad language that any I have ever seen (like Pulp Fiction, Scarface, or even South Park) but the profanity only hightens the dread at times. It also looks at life in a very dark way. This is not a happy movie by any means and Oldman has produced a real masterpiece. This has great acting and real good timing between the actors.
