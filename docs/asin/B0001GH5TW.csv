They both are great actresses who create very interesting characters, but they get bogged down in a convoluted muck. Why Altman, whose 70s movies I usually enjoy, felt the need to include identity switches, overbearingly ominous music, dozens of slow pans to Greek-like paintings of rape and violence, and an unfathomable (and disappointingly tacked-on) ending is thoroughly beyond me. No, on second thought it's not BEYOND me, it's BENEATH me. I get what he was trying to do, but it's heavy handed and poorly executed.

Identity is as fluid as water and as changeable and ephemeral as the changing tides of fate.After the accident the Duvall character seems to swap identities with her counterpart who becomes brazen and provocative while Duvall becomes weepy and insecure.

""3 Women"" starts like a quirky character piece, then it eventually turns sinister, and ends flat and confusing. There is absolutely no payoff here, even though some seeds of genuine possibility and menace are planted and begin to spread.People say that this is ambivalent and dreamlike. Well, there's entirely too much ambivalence here: Who really is Pinky (Spacek)? What's her story? Why is she so interested in Millie, a stranger? Who are we supposed to care about? Why is it called 3 Women if it only really deals with two? And why are the scenes of Willie the pregnant mural painter laced with loud, sinister background music? It's beyond me. And annoying. This movie just offers endless questions.I hoped for (and truly expected) something better to develop, based on the slow and palpable tension that Altman builds over two hours. There's a lot of potential here but it's never explored. We are left with some bizarre, questionable stuff instead, like Altman slowly and methodically zooming in on a can of dessert topping spray while the characters chat. What was that about? Probably nothing. It's all apparently open to interpretation... every single bit of it. I'll pass.The interesting thing for me is that this might've made an amazing psychological horror film, had they added some suspense and chills.

Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination.

804267,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0001GH5TW,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[7, 15]","Robert Altman's 1977 film 3 Women, which he wrote and directed from a dream he had, is not a bad film, but not a great film either. It is one of those films, ala Robert Browning, whose reach exceeds its grasp, but not in the good way. It is intended to work on a dream level, yet it is too realistic in its detail for much of the film to be seen as all dream, and not quite bizarre enough to be real dream, especially in its far too forced, and ultimately failed, ending.Some critics have likened the film to Ingmar Bergman's Persona, but this is a stretch. Even though that film is a bit overrated in the Bergman canon, 3 Women is nowhere in that league as a work of art: not as film, social commentary, nor work of symbolism. It has some elements in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, about another female misfit on the verge of insanity, as well as to the later, and far inferior, David Lynch mystery film Mulholland Drive, which was also about two women in a dreamy scenario.The film follows the life of two lonely women who can only be called 'losers'. Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall) is an ugly worker at a California old folks' health spa. She is unpopular, shunned by her co-workers- who ignore her blather despite her not realizing it, yet lives in a world of her own making, where all people like her, she is among the popular set, and life is made better by magazine ads and cooking recipes that involve all pre-processed foods and no real cooking ability. She is so clueless that every time she drives her mustard colored heap of a car her yellow skirt always gets caught in the door, and hangs outside. She also wears hideous yellow bathrobes with hoods to her apartment complex's pool, yet thinks all the men desire her.She becomes co-workers and roommates ($55 a month- those were the days!) with an even odder girl who comes to work at the spa, one day, and seems to lack a past, even though she claims to be from Texas, like Millie. Her name is also Mildred, although she goes by the nickname Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek). Pinky is a redhead who seems almost autistic (as she would be labeled these days), and is even less capable of existing in the world....The third woman of the film is an older woman, Willie Hart (Janice Rule), who is pregnant, cold, silent, and paints bizarre man-hating pictures of pregnant gargoyle-like creatures on tiles and in pools, that seem to betray her bitterness, especially toward her no account husband, Edgar (Robert Fortier), a buffoonish would be macho man, and ex-stunt double in Western films, who is as big a joke to his sex as the two girls are to theirs, due to his penchant for guns, motorcycles, and beer. The two of them own the apartment complex, The Purple Sage- a sort of pre-Melrose Place Melrose Place for losers, the two girls share an apartment in, and also own a crappy bar, Dodge City, out in the desert, where macho loses race dirt bikes...Then, Altman tanks the film with wan surrealism that fails...It is best described as that misfit beast- 'the noble failure.' Robert Altman has always been a hit and miss director....and, unlike Michelangelo Antonioni's best films, which often seem to end not at their chronological ends, this film's ending is not the work of a carefully placed artist's inventiveness, just stylized randomness rationalized after the fact.",2,Schizophrenic Altman finds middle ground,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,3341,"['Robert', 'Altman', '1977', 'film', '3', 'Women', 'wrote', 'directed', 'dream', 'had', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'ala', 'Robert', 'Browning', 'reach', 'grasp', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'intended', 'work', 'dream', 'level', 'too', 'realistic', 'detail', 'much', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'dream', 'not', 'quite', 'bizarre', 'enough', 'be', 'real', 'dream', 'especially', 'far', 'too', 'forced', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'ending.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'likened', 'film', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'stretch', 'Even', 'film', 'bit', 'overrated', 'Bergman', 'canon', '3', 'Women', 'nowhere', 'league', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'work', 'symbolism', 'elements', 'common', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Repulsion', 'female', 'misfit', 'verge', 'insanity', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'far', 'inferior', 'David', 'Lynch', 'mystery', 'film', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'was', 'also', 'about', 'two', 'women', 'dreamy', 'scenario.The', 'film', 'life', 'two', 'lonely', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', ""'losers"", 'Millie', 'Lammoreaux', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', 'ugly', 'worker', 'California', 'old', 'folks', 'health', 'spa', 'unpopular', 'shunned', 'co-workers-', 'who', 'ignore', 'blather', 'not', 'realizing', 'yet', 'world', 'own', 'making', 'where', 'people', 'popular', 'set', 'life', 'made', 'better', 'magazine', 'ads', 'cooking', 'recipes', 'involve', 'pre-processed', 'foods', 'real', 'cooking', 'ability', 'so', 'clueless', 'time', 'mustard', 'colored', 'heap', 'car', 'yellow', 'skirt', 'always', 'caught', 'door', 'hangs', 'also', 'hideous', 'yellow', 'bathrobes', 'hoods', 'apartment', 'complex', 'pool', 'men', 'desire', 'her.She', 'co-workers', 'roommates', '55', 'month-', 'were', 'days', 'even', 'odder', 'girl', 'who', 'work', 'spa', 'one', 'day', 'lack', 'past', 'even', 'be', 'Texas', 'Millie', 'name', 'also', 'Mildred', 'nickname', 'Pinky', 'Rose', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Pinky', 'redhead', 'who', 'almost', 'autistic', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'days', 'even', 'less', 'capable', 'existing', 'world', '.The', 'third', 'woman', 'film', 'older', 'woman', 'Willie', 'Hart', 'Janice', 'Rule', 'who', 'pregnant', 'cold', 'silent', 'paints', 'bizarre', 'man-hating', 'pictures', 'pregnant', 'gargoyle-like', 'creatures', 'tiles', 'pools', 'seem', 'betray', 'bitterness', 'especially', 'account', 'husband', 'Edgar', 'Robert', 'Fortier', 'buffoonish', 'would', 'be', 'macho', 'man', 'ex-stunt', 'double', 'Western', 'films', 'who', 'as', 'big', 'joke', 'sex', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'theirs', 'due', 'penchant', 'guns', 'motorcycles', 'beer', 'two', 'own', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Purple', 'Sage-', 'sort', 'pre-Melrose', 'Place', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'losers', 'two', 'girls', 'share', 'apartment', 'also', 'own', 'crappy', 'bar', 'Dodge', 'City', 'desert', 'where', 'macho', 'race', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'Then', 'Altman', 'film', 'wan', 'surrealism', 'best', 'described', 'beast-', ""'the"", 'noble', 'failure', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'always', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'director', '.and', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'best', 'films', 'often', 'seem', 'end', 'not', 'chronological', 'ends', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'work', 'carefully', 'placed', 'artist', 'inventiveness', 'just', 'stylized', 'randomness', 'rationalized', 'fact']",3 Women
804268,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0001GH5TW,Doug Anderson,"[25, 26]","3 Women is one of the most compelling films I've seen in a long while. In some ways it features all of the familiar Altman traits (the quirky characters, the bizarre locations, the off-beat music, and the staggering this way and that storyline that, at times, threatens to dissolve into incoherence) but it also offers something that only a few of Altman's other classics have: moral depth.I've tried to view all of Altman's seventies films but a few of them remain hard to track down. After many years I finally located California Split (recently released on DVD) and Thieves Like Us (still only available on VHS) but my favorite two Altman films are McCabe and Mrs. Miller (DVD) and The Long Goodbye (DVD). At least these two were my favorites before I viewed the most difficult to track down of all Altman films, 3 Women. Now its availbale on DVD but for years the only way you could see it was on late-night cable or in a New York art house revival of old Altman films.  Nothing against 80's and 90's Altman but 70's Altman is where cinema begins and ends for anyone who grew up in that decade because Altman puts his finger right on something that no one even seems to see: that characters are always mysteriously disconnected from their surroundings, and that pop culture leaves its inhabitants curiously marooned in an artificial world and starved for connection to something real.Altman has an uncanny knack for picking remote locations that simply re-inforce the feeling that each character is alone and buttressed by nothing but their own ingenuity. Whether its the beach house in Long Goodbye (which was Altmans own home at the time) or the rural suburbia of 3 Women these locations seem like utopian California dreamscapes that can with the bat of an eye turn into frightfully arid zones of psychic disintegration.Altman was a painter for a time and though I am not aware of which painters he preferred I imagine he was influenced by the Bay Area figuritive artists like Diebenkorn whose Ocean Park series captures at once the lustre and menace of living in an enternally sunny oasis.3 Women is frightening. Sissy Spacek is perhaps the most effective actress in recent cinema to make vacuity and emptiness seem so frightening. Shelly Duvall is equally good at conveying vacuity and emptiness but she fills her character ""Millie's"" void with an endless flow of words that at least provide her with the illusion that she is a coherent and functioning whole, thus rendering herself less vulnerable to the dissolution that Spacek's ""Pinky"" is powerless to ward off.3 Women is best viewed with little foreknowledge of the story so I will not elaborate beyond that as to the psychic unraveling of these two.  Suffice it to say that these two work in a kind of spa for the elderly. Its a location as bleak as the desert that surrounds it and equally void of emotion and character; the spa is run by the book and there is no room for anyone to show any individuality or to connect with others in any way but through professional roles and channels. Therefore Shelly Duvall's chattering is a constant earsore to her superiors, though to Sissy Spacek her chattering is like the one bit of proof that the spa does in fact have a pulse and that life does in fact exist.The other two locations that figure prominently are the apartment complex (replete with seventies singles parties)and the desert bar where Millie and Pinky meet Willie, a highly eccentric artist-barkeep who expresses herself only visually. Her mosaics that decorate strangely unseen places like the unvisited and unseen oasis of a private pool bottom in the middle of nowhere are of haunting vengeful figures; the figures look Etruscan or Greek and they seem to forewarn of terrible things like the things in Greek tragedies.The psyches in this film are each like unseen and unvisted oasis. We know next to nothing about the talkative Millie, the reticent wallflower Pinky, and the decidedly silent but intense and resentful Willie.  All three do share one thing: they are women.I urge Altman fans to view this, but also fans of Bergman's Persona, and DePalma's Sisters, and Polanski's Repulsion and fans of French directors like Claude Chabrol. This is an artsy (though in no way pretensious) film and not one you will ever fully cognitively master because it works at a level that defies rational, linear description.Nashville is undoubtedly Altman's big budget masterpiece, but I think this one (now that people are able to finally view it) is becoming known as Altman's low-budget seventies masterpiece.A film you will watch more than once, but I envy those of you who haven't seen it because the first viewing is the strangest.

804270,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0001GH5TW,Galina,"[4, 4]","I've wanted to see Robert Altman's ""3 Women""(1977) for long time and finally saw it last night. The references to one of my all time favorites, Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" are obvious: two young women, the main characters (seemingly meek, childlike Pinky and outgoing and seemingly popular but in reality a sad loser Millie seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one in a desperate search for connection and sense of belonging but ""3 Women"" is memorable and haunting on its own terms. It makes you think long time after it's over. As a matter of fact, I am still thinking about it. I think that it is an incredible work of an extraordinary master. As always in his best films, Robert Altman is terrific - innovative, iconoclastic, free-spirited, unconventional, and truly original. He is a great humanist who sees through his characters but never makes fun of them and he understands them. Under his directing, Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacec gave two astonishing performances. They were both great but Duvall was a revelation. She adapted the loquacious Millie's personality and become the character. Altman had discovered Duvall at one of the malls in Texas where she was selling cosmetics and given her roles in his six films. I want also to mention the eerie music, the dreamy and uneasy atmosphere of something sinister ready to happen, the scary and mesmerizing murals on the bottom of the pool that the third woman, silent and mysterious, tired and wise Willie (Janice Rule) was painting. Altman did not try to trick or confuse me, and the story seems to be simple one but I am not sure that I understood everything, especially the enigmatic ending. Altman was aware of the effect of his movie to the viewers and in his commentary he says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. In this regard it also reminds of ""Un chien andalou"" (1929) which was supposed to be experienced directly and not analyzed by the viewers.""3 Women"" is another great film by one of the best American film directors.

I tuned into the movie right at the scene where Sissy Spacek was screaming at Shelley Duvall from a hospital bed, &quot;DON'T CALL ME PINKY -- GET OUT OF HERE!&quot;  It was from this moment on that I became fascinated with Robert Altman's dreamlike masterpiece, '3 Women.'  I made sure to tape it during a repeat screening, and for years hoped that it would make it to DVD, for it was never even released on VHS!  So when I heard about Criterion giving it the deluxe treatment, I was very excited.'3 Women' is not a conventional film by any means.  Every person I invite over to watch it, either loathes it or is so utterly puzzled that they need to have a stiff drink afterwards.  It is not a film that all audiences will appreciate.  However, those with an interest in unusual characters or artsy cinema should find it a rewarding experience, especially with repeated viewings.  It's not so much a matter the film being ahead of it's time -- '3 Women' is in a timespace all of it's own!The strongest attraction of '3 Women' for me, is the remarkable performances by Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek.  Duvall brings a sense of pathos and false reassurance to Millie.  Can't we all think of some Millie-types who we know that try so hard to fit in with society but just fail miserably?  Spacek, on the other hand, gives Pinky an other-worldliness that at times borders on a personality disorder right out of the DSM-IV manual.Like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' '3 Women' leaves several mysteries unanswered and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks.  For instance, why was Pinky was warned about the twins early on in the film?  Why did Pinky give Ms. Bunwell Millie's social security number instead of her own?  And of course, what was the inexplicable final scene all about?Criterion's DVD presention is acceptable.  Robert Altman provides a commentary track which is more than welcome.

Lionized by most critics as a neglected masterpiece, I certainly liked it, and respected it's lofty aims, but didn't flat out love it.  The two lead performances by Sissy Spacek and Shelly Duvall are wonderful, and the film has more than its share of powerful and creepy moments.But the film - based on a dream of Altman's, and not trying to make any literal sense - feels overly self-conscious and arty at times.  I found the music  intrusive, almost shouting `see how weird this is?' And a lot of the symbolism, like the paintings that run through the film, feels  bit heavy handed and obvious.  Alternately some plot twists feel arbitrary, not thought through.This is often compared to David Lynch's dream films Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. But I found both of those a little more fun, and they felt more cohesive in their dream worlds, even if I didn't always know what was going on.Now, having said all that, I do look forward to seeing it again.  I've often found some of my very favorite films are complex and challenging works that don't jell on 1st viewings, only to have those petty annoyances fall away on a second look.  In any case, if you're up for something challenging, this is a terrifically acted, unique and brave film, and certainly worth a look.

She is guided into her new job by the talkative Millie (Shelley Duvall).  Millie's chattiness is often disregarded by her coworkers, neighbors, and all others as she desperately attempts to make connections with men.  However, Pinky perceives Millie as the perfect woman as she is the only person that pays any attention to her, which leads to the two of them becoming roommates.  This is the beginning for what could be called a surrealistic experience as the connection between two women with their similarities and differences develops.  Their connection leads into a whirlpool of emotional turmoil where the third enigmatic woman, Willie (Janice Rule), enters.  Wille is an artist that creates murals of amphibian women in struggles.3 Women is dreamlike vision of what Altman once dreamed and later envisioned on the silver screen for the public to see.  When Altman's vision has been seen it is difficult to make into a clear picture as painfully uneasiness is instilled into the cerebral cortex while ambiguous notions are drifting in multiple directions.  This leaves interpretation completely to the audience as some hints of what Altman might want to say could offer some direction, yet lead astray the most cunning of cerebral minds.  Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall perform with brilliance as they bring this delusional imagination to life.

Yet, when he hits---he's a genius. &quot;3 Women&quot; contains the genius with the uncanny casting of Shelley Duvall as Millie, a would be sophisticate with no sophistication and Sissy Spacek as Pinky, a strange blank slate of a girl from Texas. The third woman is Willie (Janice Rule), an equally strange (and strangely silent) pregnant middle-aged artist who paints obscenely macabre murals of half-reptile half-human creatures in empty swimming pools. The setting is a small desert town in Arizona where Millie works as a physical therapy aide and meets Pinky, a new aide, who winds up her roommate. Pinky is fascinated by a pair of twins who work at the rest home and begins to study Millie's life and mannerisms. After nearly drowning in a suicide attempt, she winds up in a coma. When she recovers from the coma, Millie is told she has temporary amnesia. But Pinky is no longer Pinky, she's evolving into Millie. Willie will also assume a different role in the film's eerie, pastorial conclusion. Whether you like this or not depends on your tolerance for the unusual and challenging. Certainly the film has it's humor, like Millie's desperate attempts at being a social butterfly and everyone's blatant ignoring of her. It's funny, but there's also a sadness in Millie's refusal to accept her own failings. It's also chilling to watch Spacek as the childlike Pinky Rose, seemingly dumb as dirt yet studying everything around her---especially others as she apes their movements and mannerisms.

At least this film takes you to the Coachella Valley (one of the sunniest places on the continent), so at least the bleakness around you is assuaged. I don't get the dream stuff people are talking about.  What dream?  I like to watch and interpret this film as realism - but then again, you'd have to have lived in proximity to dysfunctional people like I have; and secondly, have a craving for fleeing to the SW deserts when the climate up here turns gloomy. In that case, this is a character study and a travelogue.  That's my interpretation.  Dream schmeam.Shelly Duval and Sissy Spacek do a stellar job of acting in this one, and that makes this film a ""must see"" - if for that reason alone.  Goofy characters are difficult to act out in a realistic, believable manner, but they sure do a good job of it!  This film may be a ""B"" movie and a cult movie - but good acting is good acting, no matter what. They both should have gotten Emmys for their acting in this film.I appreciate the scenes up and down Dillon Rd (or Varner Rd - not sure which) in the area of Desert Hot Springs with the occasional glimpse of San Jacinto, and many views of the Santa Rosas to the south. They go out of their way to not reveal this as Palm Springs and vicinity - even I notice a lack of that in the scenery.  Good job there.  A resort town wouldn't fit the theme. Go to the Dillon Saloon sometime and tell me that wasn't the place they shot the saloon scenes.The Lillie character could have been deleted entirely.  Putting a ""Bay area"" character in a desert setting kinda ruins the mood.  But...it was the 1970's so I can see the necessity. Gotta sell tickets.The end of this film was the part I totally forgot about, and in fact, far as I'm concerned, you can shut the film off five minutes early and go wash dishes (or whatever).

Two women, played perfectly by Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek, struggle desperately for identity while a third, played by Janice Rule, entangles their imaginations with her primal and haunting art.  As the women's personalities grow closer and simultaneously conflict with each other's developing personalities, the loud and noisy world of men begins to lose its necessity for their existence, and they begin to violently reject it, only in the most subconcious way.This is a film for symbolism.

When I reached a point where I was sure it was 90 minutes into the film, I put it on pause, and saw that I had only seen 45 minutes.  It is monumentally slow-moving.  It is also intensely creepy, and after that initial 45 minutes or so, it began to work on me.  Not in an altogether pleasant way, but it was very effective nonetheless.3 WOMEN introduces us to mostly to 2 women.  We meet Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek, only a year after CARRIE), a new nurse coming to work at a strange, dusty, underpopulated Southern California town in an old-folks convalescence home of some sort.  There she meets Millie (Shelly Duvall), an experienced nurse assigned to show her the ropes.  Pinky is delighted to be attached to Millie, because she has clearly taken a deep and intense interest in Millie.  Millie talks almost non-stop and we see early on that she has alienated almost everyone around her with her incessant chatter and her self-delusion.  She fancies herself a bit of party animal, a gal-about-town.  In fact, everyone avoids her and all of the ""dates"" she thinks she might have never materialize.  She's one of these people (we've all met them) who we feel sorry for, yet are so irritating to be around, we just hope someone else will befriend them.  Pinky, however, sees none of that.  She's from a small Texas town and is so deeply nave that she clings to the ""worldly"" Millie and idolizes her.  And slowly, she begins to obsess over her.  And she pries into Millie's private life.This doesn't sound all that interesting, and in many ways, it isn't.  But writer/director Robert Altman is taking these two ladies on a strange psychological journey.  What I've described is just the beginning.  I don't want to tell you more, because it's all a bit open to interpretation, and if you decide to take the sometimes grueling journey that is 3 WOMEN, you should interpret for yourself.  But one easy, even glib, description that comes to mind is to call the film an ""artsy SINGLE WHITE FEMALE.""The film is full of Altman touches, particularly the improvised style of dialogue and the overlapping conversations.  It is in these overlapping voices that we hear the mockery which most people shower directly on Millie.  Millie is so eager for acceptance, to have even a hint that the life she imagines for herself is true, that she willingly endures derision in the hope of breaking through.  I have to admit that I've never been a huge Shelley Duvall fan, but this is the best performance I've seen by her.  She manages, at various times, to be touching, sad, laughable, irritating, competent, crazy.  Altman often gives his female stars some really meaty roles to chew on, and he really did here.  Spacek is also quite captivating.  It's amazing she was ever able to break out of the crazy, nave girl role after this film and CARRIE.  She fits it to a tee...but as the film progresses, Pinky's character undergoes some unexpected transformations, and Spacek handles it all with ease.I watched the Criterion Blu-Ray, and the picture quality was excellent.  Filmed in the late `70s, the film has that unmistakable look of that era...a color palette that wants to be gritty and realistic and still retain some of the richness of Technicolor.  The Blu-ray gets all that perfectly.  The sound mix was excellent, but I have to say that the score for this film was literally the most annoying ever.  I know that's not much of a useful comment, but I think my ears are still ringing from being stabbed by those awful sounds.  The extras on the Blu-ray are a little skimpy, in my opinion, especially for a relatively modern film.  There's a sparse commentary from Altman (which I only listened to pieces of), a brief essay that sheds little light on the film, and some trailers & stills.  I would have LOVED to have heard a commentary from Duvall & Spacek.It's hard to recommend this film.  It moves slowly and it's very internalized.  But a viewer with some patience may find some creepy rewards in watching the relationship between these two women (in two really fine performances) grow in unexpected and disquieting ways.",3,"Moody, slow-moving, perplexing & creepy.

Both of them from Texas, with the same first names, they exist in an unfriendly social environment as harsh, distant, and unforgiving as the surrounding desert. The third woman of the title is the wife of a philandering, self-described movie stunt-double. She is a haunting presence, painting strange figures on the underwater surfaces of swimming pools, completely silent until the final scenes of the film.The two-hour film moves at an almost lethargic pace, appropriate for lives lived in the heat of the desert sun. Isolated and lonely, the two main characters are undeveloped and incomplete in ways that materialize as the film progresses. As in Bergman's ""Persona,"" identities become mysteriously insubstantial as internal pressures, like the fierce, angry underwater images at the bottom of the pool, make their presence felt. Eventually, as one crisis follows another, the women merge and refigure themselves as personalities, the camera finally pulling away and away and away at the end from a resolution that is also a puzzlement about the nature of human identity.The film is visually striking, as it captures the pervasiveness of desert light and makes poetic use of double images, reflections in mirrors, and the appearance of a pair of mysterious twins. The soundtrack is haunting. The performances by Duvall and Spacek are nicely poignant and disturbing. This is without question a 1970s Hollywood film, made at a time when the thought-provoking, adult fare of European directors still held some influence on the creative license of American film producers. The 2003 Criterion edition of this film on DVD includes a commentary by Altman, in which he talks more generally about filmmaking, with occasional reference to ""Three Women"" itself.",5,Dream along with me . . .,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,2167,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'literally', 'dreamed', 'up', 'idea', 'film', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'when', ""'d"", 'just', 'lost', 'project', 'studio', 'wife', 'had', 'fallen', 'seriously', 'ill.', 'Set', 'desert', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'film', 'concerns', '1970s', 'version', 'identity', 'theft', 'young', 'woman', 'new', 'employee', 'hot', 'springs', 'spa', 'where', 'work', 'attendants', 'elderly', 'clientele', 'Texas', 'same', 'first', 'names', 'exist', 'unfriendly', 'social', 'environment', 'harsh', 'distant', 'unforgiving', 'surrounding', 'desert', 'third', 'woman', 'title', 'wife', 'philandering', 'self-described', 'movie', 'stunt-double', 'haunting', 'presence', 'painting', 'strange', 'figures', 'underwater', 'surfaces', 'swimming', 'pools', 'completely', 'silent', 'final', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'two-hour', 'film', 'moves', 'almost', 'lethargic', 'pace', 'appropriate', 'lives', 'lived', 'heat', 'desert', 'sun', 'Isolated', 'lonely', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'undeveloped', 'incomplete', 'ways', 'materialize', 'film', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'become', 'mysteriously', 'insubstantial', 'internal', 'pressures', 'fierce', 'angry', 'underwater', 'images', 'bottom', 'pool', 'make', 'presence', 'felt', 'Eventually', 'one', 'crisis', 'women', 'merge', 'refigure', 'personalities', 'camera', 'finally', 'pulling', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'end', 'resolution', 'also', 'puzzlement', 'nature', 'human', 'identity.The', 'film', 'visually', 'striking', 'pervasiveness', 'desert', 'light', 'poetic', 'use', 'double', 'images', 'reflections', 'mirrors', 'appearance', 'pair', 'mysterious', 'twins', 'soundtrack', 'haunting', 'performances', 'Duvall', 'Spacek', 'are', 'nicely', 'poignant', 'disturbing', 'question', '1970s', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'thought-provoking', 'adult', 'fare', 'European', 'directors', 'still', 'held', 'influence', 'creative', 'license', 'American', 'film', 'producers', '2003', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'film', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Altman', 'more', 'generally', 'filmmaking', 'occasional', 'reference', 'Three', 'Women']",3 Women

804300,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B0001GH5TW,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[2, 2]","Three Women was another Robert Altman masterpiece. His films have always deeply explored the frailties, of the human personality. And Three Women is typical of Altman's deftness, regarding intense characterizations.This film takes place in the late 70s, in a remote California town. It revolves around three very different female characters, and the effects that each of them has on each other's lives.Shelley Duvall is cast as Millie. Millie is an intensely garrulous woman. She's obsessed with talking about recipes, that she garners from women's magazines. She annoys those around her, with her constant chatter about her 'latest recipe'.Millie also desperately wants to impress her male acquaintances. Men seem to mostly shun Millie though, which doesn't stop her from trying to gain their attention.Millie has a dead-end job, working as a nurse's aid in a nursing home. Her supervisors are brusque, and unsympathetic. She tries to be friendly and helpful, but this often causes her more problems with her bosses.Pinky (played by the very talented Sissy Spacek) moves to Millie's town. She needs a job and is hired as a nurse's aid, at the same nursing home that Millie works at. Millie is assigned to train Pinky in her new job duties. Pinky soon becomes quite attached to Millie.Finally, Millie has someone around (Pinky), who actually admires her. When Millie posts a notice on the bulletin board at work , indicating that she seeks a roommate, Pinky is only to happy to get the chance to room with Millie. Pinky then moves into Millie's apartment. Though Millie's apartment has a tacky, garish quality, Pinky expresses how sublime she thinks it is.One afternoon after work, Millie asks Pinky to go with her to a run-down bar. Pinky meets Millie's friend Edgar, who has set-up a shooting rink out back. He constantly practices shooting there, and invites Millie and Pinky to participate. Edgar is a sophomoric, macho-type, who drinks heavily. He also likes to show-off his marksmanship skills.Millie also introduces Pinky to Willie, who happens to be Edgar's artist girlfriend. Willie is always painting monstrous, sexually explicit creatures around the bar. Pinky is, inexplicably, mesmerized by Willie's offbeat paintings.Willie has a haunting, remote presence. She mostly watches everyone else from afar, while being intensely involved with her artwork. Willie also happens to live in the same apartment building, as Millie and Pinky. Her disturbing paintings, adorn the bottom of the swimming pool located there.Basically, the film doesn't have much of a plot. At least not in the traditional, linear manner that audiences are accustomed to. Instead, Altman chose to focus on the psychological aspects of the relationship between the three woman, and how this changes over time.The friendship between Pinky and Millie becomes tumultuous, for no obvious reason. Willie is the ethereal, mysterious woman of the three. She doesn't interact much with Millie and Pinky throughout the film. Willie's artwork is so hypnotic to Pinky though, that it has a horrible effect on Pinky's psyche, resulting in tragic consequences. The viewer is left to try and fathom why.All three women in the film, are social misfits. And they each struggle pathetically to function in the alienating, urban environment that they inhabit. Altman did a marvelous job, highlighting the emotional turmoil that the women inflict on each other, during the course of the film.This is a film that will leave a deep impression, regarding the dynamics of women's friendships in modern life. But don't expect a neat and tidy conclusion, to the conflicts between the three women.

804301,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B0001GH5TW,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[5, 5]","The seventies and the eighties were incredibly fruitful for director Robert Altman. After the success of `MASH', he was given carte blanche by Twentieth Century Fox. As a result of this wealth of freedom, he wrote, produced, and directed `3 Woman', which, according to the director, was born entirely out of a dream that he had while his wife was in the hospital.`3 Women' is Altman's masterpiece - ethereal, surreal, and carried by two magnificent performances from Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek. Bearing similarities to Bergman's `Persona' and Lynch's `Mulholland Drive', `3 Women' is the tale of two twenty-something's, Millie Lammoreaux (Duvall) and Pinky Rose (Spacek) who meet one another at the geriatric spa in California where they both work. Pinky is young, nave, and oddly smitten with the high-strung, wannabe socialite that is Millie, who awkwardly takes Pinky under her wing during her job training sessions at the spa. Pinky seems to idolize Millie, who never seems to stop talking. She constantly chatters in the locker room to the other nurses, who never seem to acknowledge her in any way. Despite the indifference of her co-workers, Millie displays an eerie self-confidence, wearing her delusions on her sleeve for the world to see.When Pinky responds to a roommate request posted by Millie in the hospital cafeteria, the two women find themselves living together, despite their incredibly diverse personalities. The apartment building in which they live is haunted by the presence of a third woman, Willie (Janice Rule) an abstract artist who paints increasingly disturbing murals on the pool floor, featuring dominant, reptilian creatures. Willie is pregnant and never speaks. Her alcoholic husband runs the hotel, as well as the local bar. He constantly flirts with Pinky, and carries on an affair with Millie.Before long, Pinky's childlike behavior, as well as her inability to mind her own business begins to wear on Millie. The two have a heated argument, after which Pinky jumps from the top of the apartment building into the pool, falling into a coma as a result of the impact. She is admitted to the hospital, much to the shock of Millie, who instantly regrets her dismissive attitudes towards the young lady.When Pinky finally rises from her coma and moves back in with Millie, it is clear that a personality shift has occurred. Pinky is aggressive, intolerant of Millie's eccentricities, and becomes increasingly promiscuous with Willie's husband. The roles have been inexplicably reversed. Pinky has become everything that Millie aspires to be; only Pinky is better at it. Millie's true colors began to shine through the faade, revealing her vulnerability.The film ends on an ambiguous note, which completely blurs the line between dream and reality. The entire film is a dreamlike experience - a summer nightmare, rich with symbolism and disturbing imagery. The possibilities are endless with a film such as this, which focuses primarily on mood. You ""feel"" your way through this film, and perhaps this is the proper way to approach such material.A masterpiece on every conceivable level, this film is Altman's best, and is highly recommended.",5,Robert Altman's '3 Women' is one of the best films of the seventies.,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3178,"['seventies', 'eighties', 'were', 'incredibly', 'fruitful', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'success', 'MASH', 'was', 'given', 'carte', 'blanche', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'result', 'wealth', 'freedom', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', '3', 'Woman', 'according', 'director', 'was', 'born', 'entirely', 'dream', 'had', 'wife', 'was', 'hospital.', '3', 'Women', 'Altman', 'masterpiece', 'ethereal', 'surreal', 'carried', 'two', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Bearing', 'similarities', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', '3', 'Women', 'tale', 'two', 'twenty-something', 'Millie', 'Lammoreaux', 'Duvall', 'Pinky', 'Rose', 'Spacek', 'who', 'meet', 'one', 'geriatric', 'spa', 'California', 'where', 'work', 'Pinky', 'young', 'nave', 'oddly', 'smitten', 'high-strung', 'wannabe', 'socialite', 'Millie', 'who', 'awkwardly', 'Pinky', 'wing', 'job', 'training', 'sessions', 'spa', 'Pinky', 'idolize', 'Millie', 'who', 'never', 'stop', 'talking', 'constantly', 'chatters', 'locker', 'room', 'other', 'nurses', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'acknowledge', 'way', 'indifference', 'co-workers', 'Millie', 'eerie', 'self-confidence', 'wearing', 'delusions', 'sleeve', 'world', 'see.When', 'Pinky', 'roommate', 'request', 'posted', 'Millie', 'hospital', 'cafeteria', 'two', 'women', 'find', 'living', 'together', 'incredibly', 'diverse', 'personalities', 'apartment', 'building', 'live', 'haunted', 'presence', 'third', 'woman', 'Willie', 'Janice', 'Rule', 'abstract', 'artist', 'who', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'murals', 'pool', 'floor', 'featuring', 'dominant', 'reptilian', 'creatures', 'Willie', 'pregnant', 'never', 'speaks', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'hotel', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'bar', 'constantly', 'Pinky', 'affair', 'Millie.Before', 'long', 'Pinky', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'as', 'well', 'inability', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'wear', 'Millie', 'two', 'have', 'heated', 'argument', 'Pinky', 'jumps', 'top', 'apartment', 'building', 'pool', 'falling', 'coma', 'result', 'impact', 'admitted', 'hospital', 'much', 'shock', 'Millie', 'who', 'instantly', 'dismissive', 'attitudes', 'young', 'lady.When', 'Pinky', 'finally', 'coma', 'moves', 'back', 'Millie', 'clear', 'personality', 'shift', 'occurred', 'Pinky', 'aggressive', 'intolerant', 'Millie', 'eccentricities', 'increasingly', 'promiscuous', 'Willie', 'husband', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'inexplicably', 'reversed', 'Pinky', 'become', 'everything', 'Millie', 'be', 'only', 'Pinky', 'better', 'Millie', 'true', 'colors', 'began', 'shine', 'faade', 'revealing', 'vulnerability.The', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'completely', 'line', 'dream', 'reality', 'entire', 'film', 'dreamlike', 'experience', 'summer', 'nightmare', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'film', 'such', 'primarily', 'mood', 'feel', 'way', 'film', 'perhaps', 'proper', 'way', 'approach', 'such', 'material.A', 'masterpiece', 'conceivable', 'level', 'film', 'Altman', 'best', 'highly', 'recommended']",3 Women
804302,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B0001GH5TW,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[4, 4]","3 WOMEN is one strange movie.  From the first shots of elderly people with flesh that is both flabby and withered slowly moving in a therapy pool with their attendants the viewer knows that this is not a typical Hollywood offering.  Set somewhere in the Palm Springs vicinity the action moves mostly between three specific places - the therapy center where two of the women work, a Western bar called ""Dodge City""  and an apartment complex, ""The Purple Sage"".  The film does have a definite plot but that plot is wide open to interpretation.The three women are Millie, Pinky (who claims her real name is  Mildred but is she reliable?) and the pregnant and nearly silent Willie.  Millie is played brilliantly by Shelley Duvall.  A clueless loser who tries too hard and never stops talking, Millie, works at the therapy center, lives at ""The Purple Sage"" and hangs out at the ""Dodge City"" bar where for all her talk of boyfriends and dates her only lover seems to be Edgar, Willie's  middle aged, ex Hollywood cowboy husband who owns both the bar and Millie's apartment complex.  Willie is played by Janice Rule as a strange beautiful woman who seems almost too old to be pregnant and floats through the movie mostly silent, painting weird scenes. Sissy Spacek's Pinky seems childlike and naive when we meet her and also when we last see her in the haunting closing scenes.  She comes to work at the therapy center pool and is invited to become fellow Texan Millie's roommate.  Pinky is perhaps the most enigmatic of all the characters in this very quirky film as we don't know whether to see her as an innocent or a master manipulator.  A visit from an elderly couple who claim to be her parents raises more questions than it answers.The entire movie is dreamlike and a long actual dream sequence right before the tragic climax of the film does little to enhance the plot.

804305,A2RCJ1HUX9B84E,B0001GH5TW,Yoselovich Boris,"[3, 3]","One of the best movies I've ever seen.It's closeness to Bergman's ""Persona"" is strongly felt,though both films are very individual pieces of art of two very different artists.It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you finished watching it.One of it's strongest sides is a wonderful music that comes back to my mind every time I think about the film's disturbing images.The acting is excellent,especially by Spacek and Duvall and the operator's work is gorgeous.The film is about two common,mediocre,untalented(one is Millie,pretentious and pathetic and another one,Pinky,a grown-up infant who needs constant support and care)young women doing simple jobs in the Old Men's House(this is what they know and can do)and much older,quiet,reclusive but gifted artist Willie who paints beautiful murals describing strange male and female creatures in violent and sexual acts.I think these paintings are the key to understanding what kind of psychological relations Willie has with the outer world.This explains her reclusiveness and almost total silence during the film,giving preference to her wordless expression in an artful manner of her inner state and attitude towards the world.Actually this silent woman fells as a victim to the three other main characters - first losing her unfaithful,hard drinking friend-husband(?) Edgar as both Millie and then ""new"" Pinky in turn sleep with him(though both know very well that Willie is expecting a child)and then her baby when Pinky having been sent to call a doctor,just watches indifferently(this indifference is especially strongly felt after the Millie's ""bloody"" slap) as Millie is hoplessly trying to help Willie and finally fails. The ultimate expression of this unbearable cruelty of being is the dead-born baby,who ""refuses to be born alive"" into such a world.The end is open to interpretations:it may be easy to understand why Edgar could have been killed by Willie(though it is never revealed who did it),but it would be strange to discover that it is Pinky and Millie who actually did it(NOBODY FORCED them to sleep with Edgar and cause pain to Willie!). Love,depression,envy(What does Pinky think when she watches Willie painting?),psychological violence and hidden hatred are all interrelated in this superb human drama of an exceptionally talented film director.If you like cinema as an art,you won't regret watching it.Highly recommended.",5,Altman at his best.,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,2414,"['One', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.It', 'closeness', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'strongly', 'felt', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'individual', 'pieces', 'art', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'artists.It', 'movie', 'thinking', 'long', 'finished', 'watching', 'it.One', 'strongest', 'sides', 'wonderful', 'music', 'back', 'mind', 'time', 'think', 'film', 'disturbing', 'images.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Spacek', 'Duvall', 'operator', 'work', 'gorgeous.The', 'film', 'two', 'common', 'mediocre', 'untalented', 'one', 'Millie', 'pretentious', 'pathetic', 'one', 'Pinky', 'grown-up', 'infant', 'who', 'constant', 'support', 'care', 'young', 'women', 'doing', 'simple', 'jobs', 'Old', 'Men', 'House', 'what', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'older', 'quiet', 'reclusive', 'gifted', 'artist', 'Willie', 'who', 'beautiful', 'murals', 'describing', 'strange', 'male', 'female', 'creatures', 'violent', 'sexual', 'acts.I', 'think', 'paintings', 'are', 'key', 'understanding', 'what', 'kind', 'psychological', 'relations', 'Willie', 'outer', 'world.This', 'reclusiveness', 'almost', 'total', 'silence', 'film', 'giving', 'preference', 'wordless', 'expression', 'artful', 'manner', 'inner', 'state', 'attitude', 'towards', 'world.Actually', 'silent', 'woman', 'victim', 'three', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'losing', 'unfaithful', 'hard', 'drinking', 'friend-husband', 'Edgar', 'Millie', 'then', 'new', 'Pinky', 'turn', 'sleep', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'Willie', 'expecting', 'child', 'then', 'baby', 'when', 'Pinky', 'having', 'been', 'sent', 'call', 'doctor', 'just', 'watches', 'indifferently', 'indifference', 'especially', 'strongly', 'felt', 'Millie', 'bloody', 'slap', 'Millie', 'hoplessly', 'trying', 'help', 'Willie', 'finally', 'fails', 'ultimate', 'expression', 'unbearable', 'cruelty', 'being', 'dead-born', 'baby', 'who', 'be', 'born', 'alive', 'world.The', 'end', 'open', 'interpretations', 'may', 'be', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Edgar', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Willie', 'never', 'revealed', 'who', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'strange', 'discover', 'Pinky', 'Millie', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'NOBODY', 'FORCED', 'sleep', 'Edgar', 'cause', 'pain', 'Willie', 'Love', 'depression', 'envy', 'What', 'Pinky', 'think', 'when', 'Willie', 'painting', 'psychological', 'violence', 'hidden', 'hatred', 'are', 'interrelated', 'superb', 'human', 'drama', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'film', 'director.If', 'like', 'cinema', 'art', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'it.Highly', 'recommended']",3 Women
