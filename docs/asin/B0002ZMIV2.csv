He did not fit the part, nor did he play it well.  I could not suspend my &#34;dis-belief&#34; to become involved with the characters.  It seemed that each scene was filmed without regard for that thread of character development necessary to draw the viewer into the story.  The predicament in which these women found themselves was real, but the script was written without regard for how their situations would have been played out in reality.  The dialogue was far to contemporary; the actions and reactions of the characters seemed like listening into conversations of modern day people, and not at all like conversations that happened at this period in history.  Many years were covered in the film, yet no one seemed to age.  I liked the costumes, the sets (some seemed authentic) and stuck it out to see all of them.

853752,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B0002ZMIV2,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","For Lifetime Channel, this is an unusually honest and heartfelt historical drama about a rarely filmed historical setting, namely pre-Civil War New Orleans. It is also unique for depicting the racial tensions of this period through the eyes of a Creole (mixture of African and French parentage) Catholic saint named Henriette Delille. Young Henriette begins this film wrestling with the injustice of placage, a social arrangement whereby Louisiana Frenchmen took Creole women as their concubines, agreeing to support them financially as a sort of ""shadow family"" without challenging existing social taboos by attempting to marry them. Dissatisfied with the ""quadroon balls"" where she is expected to promise herself without marriage to one of these Frenchmen, Henriette finds solace in teaching literacy to the children of slaves in her parish's catechism classes, but her peace is interrupted by the ongoing influx of white Southerners in the wake of U.S. acquisition (Louisiana purchase) of French territory. Attracted to a young French doctor, Henriette is drawn to a choice between being with him (possibly through marriage in France) and dedicating her life to the poor, and the cover of this DVD might cause you to be surprised when you learn what ""the courage to love"" really means in this film.As this 90-minute production depicts very well, Henriette's ultimate decision is influenced by the pressures of existing social realities, but it's also motivated by her great compassion for the suffering of fellow Creoles in New Orleans. Her spiritual growth in the latter parts of the film is depicted as a gradual and sensitive acceptance of God's will for her life. As a look at early American religious tensions and race relations, this film might be equally ideal for Black History Month and for a religion class. The production quality and acting is generally top drawer. Stacy Keach plays Henriette's father in a way that is simultaneously cowardly and sympathetic, Dianne Carahan plays her mother with affecting psychological distress, and Gil Bellows plays her love interest -- an atheistic doctor -- as someone who generally has the right instincts but lacks the courage to really stand up for his principles. All minor players in the film -- with the possible exception of the main racist antagonist, who comes across as caricatured by a weak actor -- are likewise excellent. Ecclesiastical figures like Henriette's pastor, a mother superior, and Bishop Antoine Blanc of New Orleans (1850-1860) are depicted with sympathy as shrewd supportive figures who are not necessarily willing to put themselves on the line for Henriette, but who do their best to arrange things in her favor because they want her to succeed almost as badly as they want to rebuke American Southern influence on the French culture of New Orleans.One final note: Vanessa Williams, despite her contemporary sensibilities, brings a warm empathy and likability to the lead role of Henriette that really make the film worthwhile. Although it might have been more historically accurate to hire a classically trained actress who could portray Henriette with greater attention to period values, Williams succeeds in allowing contemporary viewers to connect with this long-dead Catholic saint without sacrificing the historical essence of who she is portraying. She also does a great job of portraying Henriette's inner strength and firm principles, quietly offering a ""girl power"" performance that draws attention to itself only by comparison to the weak and indecisive male characters who surround her in most scenes. Williams gives a nuanced, difficult, and reverential performance that is arguably her best acting work. To be frank, I was initially surprised this film was made for Lifetime, as it is generally free of the hokiest forms of melodrama that one finds in other original productions on that channel. This may well be the only (it is certainly the best) film on Creole Catholicism and placage you will find.",5,Oddly moving and insightful historical drama on a Creole woman,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,3998,"['Lifetime', 'Channel', 'unusually', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'historical', 'drama', 'rarely', 'filmed', 'historical', 'setting', 'namely', 'pre-Civil', 'War', 'New', 'Orleans', 'also', 'unique', 'depicting', 'racial', 'tensions', 'period', 'eyes', 'Creole', 'mixture', 'African', 'French', 'parentage', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'named', 'Henriette', 'Delille', 'Young', 'Henriette', 'film', 'wrestling', 'injustice', 'placage', 'social', 'arrangement', 'whereby', 'Louisiana', 'Frenchmen', 'took', 'Creole', 'women', 'concubines', 'agreeing', 'support', 'financially', 'sort', 'shadow', 'family', 'challenging', 'existing', 'social', 'taboos', 'attempting', 'marry', 'Dissatisfied', 'quadroon', 'balls', 'where', 'expected', 'promise', 'marriage', 'one', 'Frenchmen', 'Henriette', 'solace', 'teaching', 'literacy', 'children', 'slaves', 'parish', 'catechism', 'classes', 'peace', 'interrupted', 'ongoing', 'influx', 'white', 'Southerners', 'wake', 'U.S.', 'acquisition', 'Louisiana', 'purchase', 'French', 'territory', 'Attracted', 'young', 'French', 'doctor', 'Henriette', 'drawn', 'choice', 'being', 'possibly', 'marriage', 'France', 'dedicating', 'life', 'poor', 'cover', 'DVD', 'might', 'cause', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'learn', 'what', 'courage', 'love', 'really', 'film.As', '90-minute', 'production', 'depicts', 'very', 'well', 'Henriette', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'influenced', 'pressures', 'existing', 'social', 'realities', 'also', 'motivated', 'great', 'compassion', 'suffering', 'fellow', 'Creoles', 'New', 'Orleans', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'latter', 'parts', 'film', 'depicted', 'gradual', 'sensitive', 'acceptance', 'God', 'will', 'life', 'look', 'early', 'American', 'religious', 'tensions', 'race', 'relations', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'equally', 'ideal', 'Black', 'History', 'Month', 'religion', 'class', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'generally', 'top', 'drawer', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Henriette', 'father', 'way', 'simultaneously', 'cowardly', 'sympathetic', 'Dianne', 'Carahan', 'mother', 'affecting', 'psychological', 'distress', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'love', 'interest', 'atheistic', 'doctor', 'someone', 'who', 'generally', 'right', 'instincts', 'courage', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'principles', 'minor', 'players', 'film', 'possible', 'exception', 'main', 'racist', 'antagonist', 'who', 'caricatured', 'weak', 'actor', 'are', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'Ecclesiastical', 'figures', 'Henriette', 'pastor', 'mother', 'superior', 'Bishop', 'Antoine', 'Blanc', 'New', 'Orleans', '1850-1860', 'are', 'depicted', 'sympathy', 'shrewd', 'supportive', 'figures', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'willing', 'put', 'line', 'Henriette', 'who', 'do', 'best', 'arrange', 'things', 'favor', 'want', 'succeed', 'almost', 'as', 'badly', 'want', 'rebuke', 'American', 'Southern', 'influence', 'French', 'culture', 'New', 'Orleans.One', 'final', 'note', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'contemporary', 'sensibilities', 'warm', 'empathy', 'likability', 'lead', 'role', 'Henriette', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'hire', 'classically', 'trained', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'portray', 'Henriette', 'greater', 'attention', 'period', 'values', 'Williams', 'allowing', 'contemporary', 'viewers', 'connect', 'long-dead', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'sacrificing', 'historical', 'essence', 'who', 'portraying', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Henriette', 'inner', 'strength', 'firm', 'principles', 'quietly', 'offering', 'girl', 'power', 'performance', 'attention', 'only', 'comparison', 'weak', 'indecisive', 'male', 'characters', 'who', 'surround', 'most', 'scenes', 'Williams', 'nuanced', 'difficult', 'reverential', 'performance', 'arguably', 'best', 'acting', 'work', 'be', 'frank', 'was', 'initially', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'generally', 'free', 'hokiest', 'forms', 'melodrama', 'one', 'finds', 'other', 'original', 'productions', 'channel', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'only', 'certainly', 'best', 'film', 'Creole', 'Catholicism', 'placage', 'will', 'find']",The Courage to Love
