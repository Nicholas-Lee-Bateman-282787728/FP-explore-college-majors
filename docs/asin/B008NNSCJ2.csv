Full Moon has done it's fans a great service by finally releasing these on Blu Ray.  The first 3 films are really classics in the genre and this is the first time we're getting to see them in their intended form.  These films were first released on VHS in the late 80's/early 90's before widescreen presentations were common place in the home video market.  We were forced to see full frame versions.  Those transfers carried over to DVDs.  If you were unlucky enough to pick up any dvd releases from Echo Bridge Entertainment of the first 6 films on DVD, you saw some pretty awful transfers.  Now we are treated to beautiful 1.85:1 transfers with brand new color timing that makes the films look brand new.  The only issues would be that there is some banding in the blacks every once in awhile and the menu volume is louder than the feature volume.  To be clear, the feature volume is perfectly fine, it's the menus that are cartoonishly loud.  Each disc includes the original Videozone from back in the day, as well.  If you're a fan of the series, or just a fan of indie horror, this is a must own.",5,A Must Own for Any Fan of the Series,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,1194,"['wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'reviewing', 'film', 'rather', 'quality', 'blu', 'Full', 'Moon', 'done', 'fans', 'great', 'service', 'finally', 'releasing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'first', '3', 'films', 'are', 'really', 'classics', 'genre', 'first', 'time', ""'re"", 'getting', 'see', 'intended', 'form', 'films', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'VHS', 'late', ""80's/early"", '90', 'widescreen', 'presentations', 'were', 'common', 'place', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'were', 'forced', 'see', 'full', 'frame', 'versions', 'transfers', 'carried', 'DVDs', 'were', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'dvd', 'releases', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Entertainment', 'first', '6', 'films', 'DVD', 'saw', 'pretty', 'awful', 'transfers', 'Now', 'are', 'treated', 'beautiful', '1.85:1', 'transfers', 'brand', 'new', 'color', 'timing', 'films', 'look', 'brand', 'new', 'only', 'issues', 'would', 'be', 'banding', 'blacks', 'once', 'awhile', 'menu', 'volume', 'louder', 'feature', 'volume', 'be', 'clear', 'feature', 'volume', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'menus', 'are', 'cartoonishly', 'loud', 'disc', 'original', 'Videozone', 'back', 'day', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'just', 'fan', 'indie', 'horror', 'must', 'own']",Puppet Master 3
1571617,A2MKADID3RAEH1,B008NNSCJ2,Philly B,"[0, 1]",This loses a star because the first film is the poorest one when it comes to the conversion!  I mean basically most of us really want that to be the best one because it is the original but it had tons of fragments and noise on it.  The other two movies are glorious looking and very well done.  You will find some fun things like an old ad for the toys which was hilarious and some other extras which make this a great purchase for us fans wanting to upgrade to blu ray for our puppet masters.  Of course it takes a special kind of person to enjoy these films as much as I do along with the dolls.  The tall man will still be my all time favorite but the puppets are a close second.,4,It's great but why is the first film the worst of the bunch in quality?,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,682,"['star', 'first', 'film', 'poorest', 'one', 'when', 'conversion', 'mean', 'basically', 'most', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'original', 'had', 'tons', 'fragments', 'noise', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'glorious', 'looking', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'find', 'fun', 'things', 'old', 'ad', 'toys', 'was', 'hilarious', 'other', 'extras', 'make', 'great', 'purchase', 'fans', 'wanting', 'upgrade', 'blu', 'ray', 'puppet', 'masters', 'course', 'special', 'kind', 'person', 'enjoy', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'along', 'dolls', 'tall', 'man', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'time', 'favorite', 'puppets', 'are', 'close', 'second']",Puppet Master 3
