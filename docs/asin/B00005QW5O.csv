675798,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B00005QW5O,Chris 'raging bill' Burton,"[5, 7]","I don't know what we were thinking (my friends and I, that is). We were bored, we were tired and we all had work the next day, so we figured we'd have a quiet night in of beer and videos. So we go down to the shop and one of us (not me, by the way) notices this film. We agreed it looked at least half-decent, so we rented it. What we saw was the most boring, ridiculous excuse for a thriller I'd ever seen in my life.OK, so the story goes like this: a group of alleged (and not very believable) misfit teenage weed-smoking girls are sick and tired of their unfulfilling sex lives. So rather than just stop going for the biggest bunch of selfish @sshole blokes and look elsewhere for love like any sensible person, they decide to scare the existing men in their lives with guns. Well, a gun that they share between them. The act of these girls pulling down, tieing up and pointing a gun in the face of a bloke twice their size is somehow a 'revolution'.The film is rediculously amatuerish. Firstly, there are some very unrealistic scenes. A cigarette lighter brushing against a shower curtain for a second (if that) is somehow supposed to start a fire in a bathroom (which like most bathrooms, has tiles on the wall). The rape scene seemed to show little struggling from the girl involved. Surely this part was supposed to be disturbing? If anything, it made me laugh at how atrociously done it was. And how exactly is a woman supposed to rape a bloke? Being hit over the head and then blinded, gagged and tied up would not turn me on in the slightest. Maybe these girls were just too stoned during their sex education lessons.Secondly, the directing itself is awful. The actors clearly haven't been told exactly what to do in some of the more complex scenes. Without meaning to beat the same old drum, the two rape scenes (one of the girl, one of the guy) showed little co-ordination between the actors. When the guy is being ambushed, he had plenty of chances to fight off or run away. It shouldn't have looked like that.My biggest gripe was sexist nature of the film. Surely if a film was made enforcing every stereotype of women in existence women would throw their arms in the air in disbelief? Are women in general in a rush to get married and have kids? Good in the kitchen? Care only about money and fast cars? If so, then the idea that men are all chauvinistic, sex-obsessed selfish morons is entirely beleivable. Also notice that the only nice guy in the film was the boring, pseudo-sensitive nerd. I suppose you could say that realism is far from this film's strongest point. Also, this isn't feministic either. Last time I checked, feminism was about equality, not infantile revenge.This is without doubt one of the dullest most poorly made films I have ever seen. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poor cinematography, poor plot. I can't think of anything about this film that would make me recommend it anyone. If you really want to see a violent, sex-filled story of women killing men, then Baise-Moi is (marginally) better than this.",1,Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen in my life,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,3046,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'friends', 'were', 'bored', 'were', 'tired', 'had', 'work', 'next', 'day', 'figured', ""'d"", 'have', 'quiet', 'night', 'beer', 'videos', 'go', 'down', 'shop', 'one', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'agreed', 'looked', 'least', 'half-decent', 'rented', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'most', 'boring', 'ridiculous', 'excuse', 'thriller', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life.OK', 'story', 'group', 'alleged', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'misfit', 'teenage', 'weed-smoking', 'girls', 'are', 'sick', 'tired', 'unfulfilling', 'sex', 'lives', 'rather', 'just', 'stop', 'going', 'biggest', 'bunch', 'selfish', '@', 'sshole', 'blokes', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'love', 'sensible', 'person', 'decide', 'scare', 'existing', 'men', 'lives', 'guns', 'Well', 'gun', 'share', 'act', 'girls', 'pulling', 'down', 'tieing', 'up', 'pointing', 'gun', 'face', 'bloke', 'twice', 'size', 'somehow', ""'revolution'.The"", 'film', 'rediculously', 'amatuerish', 'Firstly', 'are', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'brushing', 'shower', 'curtain', 'second', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'start', 'fire', 'bathroom', 'most', 'bathrooms', 'tiles', 'wall', 'rape', 'scene', 'seemed', 'show', 'little', 'struggling', 'girl', 'involved', 'Surely', 'part', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'disturbing', 'anything', 'made', 'laugh', 'how', 'atrociously', 'done', 'was', 'how', 'exactly', 'woman', 'supposed', 'rape', 'bloke', 'Being', 'hit', 'head', 'then', 'blinded', 'gagged', 'tied', 'up', 'would', 'not', 'turn', 'slightest', 'Maybe', 'girls', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'stoned', 'sex', 'education', 'lessons.Secondly', 'directing', 'awful', 'actors', 'clearly', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'told', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'more', 'complex', 'scenes', 'meaning', 'beat', 'same', 'old', 'drum', 'two', 'rape', 'scenes', 'one', 'girl', 'one', 'guy', 'showed', 'little', 'co-ordination', 'actors', 'When', 'guy', 'being', 'ambushed', 'had', 'plenty', 'chances', 'fight', 'off', 'run', 'away', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'that.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'was', 'sexist', 'nature', 'film', 'Surely', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'enforcing', 'stereotype', 'women', 'existence', 'women', 'would', 'throw', 'arms', 'air', 'disbelief', 'Are', 'women', 'general', 'rush', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'kids', 'Good', 'kitchen', 'Care', 'only', 'money', 'fast', 'cars', 'so', 'then', 'idea', 'men', 'are', 'chauvinistic', 'sex-obsessed', 'selfish', 'morons', 'entirely', 'beleivable', 'Also', 'only', 'nice', 'guy', 'film', 'was', 'boring', 'pseudo-sensitive', 'nerd', 'suppose', 'could', 'say', 'realism', 'far', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'Also', ""n't"", 'feministic', 'either', 'Last', 'time', 'checked', 'feminism', 'was', 'equality', 'not', 'infantile', 'revenge.This', 'doubt', 'one', 'dullest', 'most', 'poorly', 'made', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Poorly', 'directed', 'poorly', 'acted', 'poor', 'cinematography', 'poor', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'violent', 'sex-filled', 'story', 'women', 'killing', 'men', 'then', 'Baise-Moi', 'marginally', 'better']",The Smokers

You see how when these girls feel invisible and hurt and repressed, what they do to feel empowered and stand up for themselves, but lose their friendships in the process, which was more important than guys in the first place. I don't know why everyone thinks this movie is so terrible? Not ALL movies are glossy overproduced and manufactured big names with the intention of just making money.

I never thought I'd see another movie of that caliber ever to hit any screen ever again, but I was proved wrong. Along came...The Smokers. *pauses in awe*The other day, when I was at my local video store, I noticed a copy of this wonderous flick in the 99-cent bin. (Actually, several copies.) I looked at the cover. Three girls standing, trying to look threatening! I cried ""MARVELOUS!"" and applauded right then and there. I got funny looks from everyone in the store, but I didn't care. I bought it, took it home, and popped it in my DVD player.5 minutes later...I had to shut it off, just to regain my senses.

What a feast for the mind! This is to sight what Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" is to sound!

The whole building burning down in the end was a stroke of brilliance.

My sister rented this movie because she wanted to see girls kicking guy's butts. Instead, it was so bad we all had a good laugh over it.The plot isn't in the least bit inspiring or powerful. Supposedly it's about girls taking back power from guys, when in fact they don't seem to have anything to gripe about. Two of them are virgins with no apparent reason to need to get back at guys. The one who isn't a virgin went out and did some older, rich, married jerk in his limo, then wonders why he wouldn't give her his number? Is this a good reason to feel ""used"" by the male sex? The rest of the movie is supposed to center around this, but this quickly gets pushed aside so that other minor and unimportant underlying plots can be developed. The typical nerd boy=nice boyfriend plot is overplayed. The butt kicking consists of one hilariously unbelievable rape scene before being pushed aside.Most of this movie was just not believable. From the rape of a guy (did they give him viagra or something?) to the twisted Russian Roulette scene. Like these girls would really do that? Come on.It gets worse.Even after feeling ""used"" by the married rich guy, the girl meets with him again. He rushes things and she (finally) decides she wants to get out of the situation. She screams for help, but the limo guy does nothing. She falls out of the limo, only to be raped on the hood of the limo, in front of the driver, in the middle of the street. Despite the fact that a rape scene should be powerful and have some kind of effect on the story, nothing comes of it.The wussy girl in the group sneaks off to have sex with some guy, then decides she doesn't like it and tells him to stop and hits him with her gun. That only turns him on (because what do you know... these guys like bondage!) and she shoots him in the neck, killing him instantly. She runs and hides the gun in their dorm, only to confess anyway. But no one believes her except one woman, and no one believes this woman either. So instead of the girl being caught, she is put on drugs. What?Then there is the fire scene. For some reason one of the girls decides to set off the smoke alarm. It's not mentioned why. One minute the girls are being interviewed one by one about the murder, the next they are setting off smoke alarms? But then she magically falls or something, sets a shower curtain on fire, and gets her dress stuck in something you never see. Instead of ripping it or taking the dress off to escape from the unnaturally quickly growing fire, her friend comes and saves her (also not shown how) only to be trapped when a flaming piece of the roof falls on her. She can't get out and burns to death. What? Not only that, but the firemen let the escaped girl's nerd boyfriend come in to the burning building with them? The firemen don't even rush to save this girl. Although honestly, I wouldn't save her either. Now we're supposed to be sad the girl died. Instead, you are left wondering what this has to do with anything. Normally, tragic deaths in movies have something to do with the plot or meaning of the story. Her death was played up as if it put a some kind of closure or moral on the movie.

Dialogues are impossible (one character talks about California as a place where they have &quot;giant mosquitos&quot;... so what?) and irrelevant, but the most depressing thing is its too ridiculous development of story.  For example, see those girls, as a revenge to a boy, try to rape him, sticking a gun to his head (on a heap of corn).  Reasons?  As far as I know, it's because he ditched one of the girls rather unceremonious way.  Or watch another girl shoot a gun in a boy's head because he gets too excited during sex at a prom night.  What happens next?  Nothing.  No police.  As if nothing happened.  Because nobody believed her story!!I know words such as sub-text or irony, but I don't think I can find them here.  It is because all things are done most bland way, and you just see the girls swear, cry, complain, and even kill (and in one scene, one of them utters a line that is very offensive after her knowing her prospective love turned out to be a gay), but nothing can be accounted for in a reasonable way.  Because of setting of three girls in school, you might be reminded of &quot;Heathers&quot; but at least that film had a certain kind of power and wry humor, thanks to Christian Slater and Wynona Rider.  But here ... don't ask me.  And editing is bad so sometimes I had a trouble to follow the story.  (Believe me or not, I watched it twice.)Finally, about the appearance of my favorite actress Thora Birch.  She appears twice as a sister of one of the girls, but too briefly, so fans don't say I didn't warn you.  And both times she wears a strange paint make-up on the face, so I first could not recognize her.  I like her, I like &quot;Ghost World&quot; (great!), but I couldn't find anything good for her career here.  Sorry.",1,"A Cult Film?
