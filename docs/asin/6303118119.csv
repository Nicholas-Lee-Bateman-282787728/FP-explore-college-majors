357886,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6303118119,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","Can anyone think of any Hollywood comedy that has been condemned by so many people who didn't bother to watch it first?  Even today, THE MOON IS BLUE is best known for its ""C"" for ""Condemned"" back in 1953 by the Catholic Legion of Decency, one of that body's main objections being that one character used the phrase ""professional virgin"" a couple of times.  To clear this up sooner rather than later, that phrase was used by a young woman similar in age toward lead female Patty O'Neill (Maggie McNamara), who does indeed exploit her youth and femininity to achieve a trivial end. Specifically, in the opening sequence(small spoiler)**  what to do if she has only enough money to ride to the top of the Empire State Building or buy a lipstick, but not both?  In context, the ""professional virgin"" crack may seem catty or a bit cynical but is nowhere near obscene or objectionable.  Ironically, the movie as a whole serves moral ends, shall we say, in that all is resolved helped in part by nobody exploiting anybody else.  THE MOON IS BLUE was originally a play that was a huge hit on Broadway and also toured the country, and even out in the ""sticks"" no alleged hicks made a stink about excessive raciness.There is so much to like in this romantic comedy, even an opening title song by Sylvia Fine (Danny Kaye's wife) that is both witty and daffy. The opening scene which I've sketched above is a marvel of dialog-less exposition. (Recall that director / empresario Otto Preminger was expert in both theater and cinema going back to the silents.) The possibility of a triangle looms between Patty and an ingratiating hunkster (played by William Holden) and a suave Britisher (David Niven, looking more than ever as though evening clothes had been invented just for him).  The dialog is clever, the scenes brightly played if a bit contrived, and the level of acting is expert-plus from Holden and Niven.  Maggie McNamara held her own with her special combination of Audrey Hepburn looks and Debbie Reynolds spunk and is great fun to watch.THE MOON IS BLUE didn't really get off the ground, in large part because that ""C"" rating scared off lots of exhibitors. Nonetheless, McNamara received a Best Actress Oscar(TM) nomination, and followed up MOON with her best-remembered role in THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN (1954). Head toward the other end of the $$$ spectrum for rom-coms in 1953 and you'll find a hugely popular hit in HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, which boasted Lauren Bacall's looks and sharp wit, Betty Grable's legs and laughter, and that newly arrived ultimate bombshell, Marilyn Monroe.  Despite that, and despite a host of technical advantages (color, CinemaScope, a musical short as introduction), I urge the reader of this to see both films and tell me that MILLIONAIRE is THAT much better.MOON's handicap today is not really its rep but its price tag. Better to have an ""Archive"" DVD than none at all, but it's likely the price will put off  some potential buyers.  (At the time of this writing, the DVD of HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE costs less than half as much.)Unfortunately,  after THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN Maggie McNamara's career didn't really catch on. She died of an overdose before she turned fifty after having appeared in only a few sporadic roles.  That's about all I could find about the actress from Wikipedia, imDb and several info sites.On the lighter side, I searched for ""blue moon"" on the browser and found three definitions (none of them mine) on one site!Happy viewing!",4,This one is too good to forget!,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,3506,"['Can', 'anyone', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'been', 'condemned', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'first', 'Even', 'today', 'MOON', 'IS', 'BLUE', 'best', 'known', 'C', 'Condemned', 'back', '1953', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'one', 'body', 'main', 'objections', 'being', 'one', 'character', 'used', 'phrase', 'professional', 'virgin', 'couple', 'times', 'clear', 'up', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'phrase', 'was', 'used', 'young', 'woman', 'similar', 'age', 'lead', 'female', 'Patty', ""O'Neill"", 'Maggie', 'McNamara', 'who', 'indeed', 'exploit', 'youth', 'femininity', 'achieve', 'trivial', 'end', 'Specifically', 'opening', 'sequence', 'small', 'spoiler', 'what', 'do', 'only', 'enough', 'money', 'ride', 'top', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'buy', 'lipstick', 'not', 'context', 'professional', 'virgin', 'crack', 'may', 'seem', 'catty', 'bit', 'cynical', 'nowhere', 'near', 'obscene', 'objectionable', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'whole', 'moral', 'ends', 'shall', 'say', 'resolved', 'helped', 'part', 'nobody', 'exploiting', 'anybody', 'else', 'MOON', 'IS', 'BLUE', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'also', 'toured', 'country', 'even', 'out', 'sticks', 'alleged', 'hicks', 'made', 'stink', 'excessive', 'raciness.There', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'even', 'opening', 'title', 'song', 'Sylvia', 'Fine', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'wife', 'witty', 'daffy', 'opening', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'sketched', 'marvel', 'dialog-less', 'exposition', 'Recall', 'director', '/', 'empresario', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'was', 'expert', 'theater', 'cinema', 'going', 'back', 'silents', 'possibility', 'triangle', 'Patty', 'ingratiating', 'hunkster', 'played', 'William', 'Holden', 'suave', 'Britisher', 'David', 'Niven', 'looking', 'more', 'ever', 'evening', 'clothes', 'had', 'been', 'invented', 'just', 'dialog', 'clever', 'scenes', 'brightly', 'played', 'bit', 'contrived', 'level', 'acting', 'expert-plus', 'Holden', 'Niven', 'Maggie', 'McNamara', 'held', 'own', 'special', 'combination', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'spunk', 'great', 'fun', 'watch.THE', 'MOON', 'IS', 'BLUE', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'large', 'part', 'C', 'rating', 'scared', 'off', 'lots', 'exhibitors', 'Nonetheless', 'McNamara', 'received', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'TM', 'nomination', 'followed', 'up', 'MOON', 'best-remembered', 'role', 'THREE', 'COINS', 'IN', 'THE', 'FOUNTAIN', '1954', 'Head', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'rom-coms', '1953', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hugely', 'popular', 'hit', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MARRY', 'A', 'MILLIONAIRE', 'boasted', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'looks', 'sharp', 'wit', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'legs', 'laughter', 'newly', 'arrived', 'ultimate', 'bombshell', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'host', 'technical', 'advantages', 'color', 'CinemaScope', 'musical', 'short', 'introduction', 'urge', 'reader', 'see', 'films', 'tell', 'MILLIONAIRE', 'THAT', 'much', 'better.MOON', 'handicap', 'today', 'not', 'really', 'rep', 'price', 'tag', 'Better', 'have', 'Archive', 'DVD', 'none', 'likely', 'price', 'will', 'put', 'off', 'potential', 'buyers', 'time', 'writing', 'DVD', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MARRY', 'A', 'MILLIONAIRE', 'less', 'half', 'much', 'Unfortunately', 'THREE', 'COINS', 'IN', 'THE', 'FOUNTAIN', 'Maggie', 'McNamara', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'catch', 'died', 'overdose', 'turned', 'fifty', 'having', 'appeared', 'only', 'few', 'sporadic', 'roles', 'could', 'find', 'actress', 'Wikipedia', 'imDb', 'several', 'info', 'sites.On', 'lighter', 'side', 'searched', 'blue', 'moon', 'browser', 'found', 'three', 'definitions', 'none', 'mine', 'one', 'site', 'Happy', 'viewing']",The Moon Is Blue VHS

The frankness in which matters of sexuality and male-female relationships are breached are presented both maturely and humorously.  It must have been cathartic for the makers of the film as well as the actors to be part of a production that bravely tears down walls that others feared to approach.  Nary a swear word is uttered but the script is replete with some delicious double entendre that will make you wonder how did they think they would get away with this.  The love triangle that encompasses the main story are downright superb.  Both William Holden and David Niven as the seducers of the ""unsuspecting"" virgin are at once charming and just a smidge slimy.  They reminded me of Steve Martin and Michael Caine in the more recent ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"".  Newcomer Maggie McNamara is a breath of fresh air as the targetted innocent whose not as naive as her suitors are led to believe.  The only real debit here is a certain staginess to the proceedings which derives from it's theatre origins.  Many films that were taboo in their day seem dated but ""The Moon Is Blue"" still retains a certain freshness.",4,"""Shame On You,Maggie!

David Niven's career at the time this film was made was in serious jeopardy; he had a contract break-up with the legendary Samuel Goldwyn which was anything but cordial and his pictures prior to this weren't much of any consequence (a good example is a silly, inane ""comedy"" entitled THE LADY SAYS NO, 1951). The notoriously tyrannical Otto Preminger suddenly came to Niven's rescue ( it was rather like being snatched from drowning by King Kong!). The director was noted for enjoying the experience of striking terror into the hearts of his cast members and technicians alike. Niven emerged unscathed, however, and was ultimately deeply grateful to Preminger for casting him as the middle aged playboy. Niven does a commendable job and there is a certain chemistry between the three leads. THE MOON IS BLUE outraged many in its day by using such words as ""virgin"" and ""seduce"". In light of what's allowed in films today, this is hilarious. In 1953, however, it was condemned by the Catholic Church and banned by the censor.
