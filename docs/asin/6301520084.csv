Probably the worst part of the movie is when Eddie reveals his true identity to his new girlfriend. After stringing her along, he finally breaks it to her...""I'm Eddie Wilson."" After her understandable sarcastic response of, ""Yeah, and a dozen other guys,"" or something like that, Eddie finally convinces her that he really is Eddie Wilson. Her reaction? Nothing!

It's one of my--if not all time--favorite movies, and I never tire of watching it. When I heard they were going to make a sequel I was a little ambivalent. The first movie ended on a perfect note, and I didn't like the idea of tarnishing the mystery of that ending by making a follow-up. On the other hand, because the first one is my all-time favorite, I was also interested in a sequel at the same time. I saw the sequel in the movie theatre upon its release. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't blown over, either. The story stuck to one of the themes throughout the first one very well--how music is the most important thing in Eddie Wilson's life, and the gradual build up throughout the movie of how Eddie starts to face his past is done rather well, too. The thing that I remember getting the biggest impression from was the music itself. JC and the Beaver Brown Band did another excellent job. I think the letdown of this movie is the ending. With the ""Eddie Wilson craze"" going on all over the place, the audience at the concert doesn't recognize that it's Eddie Wilson up on the stage singing??  I don't know...I just found the ending anticlimactic.I watched the movie again recently, and thought it has aged well. Fortunately, I have a copy of it (you never see it on TV). Actually, I have two copies. The first one started to get white lines through the picture which, obviously, annoyed me, so I bought another copy. If anyone wants the first copy, let me know.Like everyone else, I would like this released on DVD---in TRUE widescreen, not the fake widescreen that is so prevalent these days on DVD (as on the Eddie and the Cruisers DVD that was released last year).

254557,AU2K7WFIIBWER,6301520084,"Damon A. Ekstrom ""dgekstrom""","[12, 13]","I absolutely loved Eddie and the Cruisers.  For me, the sequel was hit and miss.  It was great seeing Eddie, Sal, and references to certain key band members from the first film again (not to mention the great music by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band), but the first movie revolved around Tom Berenger's character Frank, ala ""Wordman"".  The absence of his character in the second movie was disappointing, but I understand that there was a need to center around Eddie this time.  After realizing that Eddie was still alive after the events of the first film, obviously audiences were intrigued as to why Eddie did what he did.  And while it's great to finally get those answers directly from the horse's mouth, the sequel changes certain key elements from the first film. For instance, the beach scene that took place between Eddie and Wordman, was spliced and re-edited to show Sal in Wordman's place.  Also, the unreleased tapes ""Season in Hell"" were given to the character Doc to distribute, and not Sal as the sequel would lead you to believe.  It's almost as if they wiped the slate clean for the sequel.While the plot is simple (and at times a little predictable), it nevertheless is entertaining to watch.  After Eddie Wilson's ""death"", Eddie and the Cruisers's music skyrocketed to the top of the charts.  And no matter where Eddie goes, he is constantly reminded not only what was, but what could have been.  Despite being ""deceased"", we find that Eddie is still making music.  And it's through a new band that Eddie (or Joe as he is called in sequel) realizes that he will never be truly happy unless he's not out there doing what he does best.On a side note, it was kind of disappointing in not seeing the rest of the band members from the first movie in the sequel.  It would have been interesting in seeing their reaction to the assumed deceased front runner live on stage at the concert that took place at the end of the film.  But that's just my fanboyism reaching out.Either way, Eddie and the Cruisers is one of my all time favortie movies.  The sequel was decent, but it could have been far better.  I love old time rock and roll, and the music by John Cafferty in these films was truly exceptional. For me,  Eddie and the Cruiser's II gets three stars, but the excellent music deserves a star all on it's own.",4,Classic Eddie,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,2334,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'sequel', 'was', 'hit', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Eddie', 'Sal', 'references', 'certain', 'key', 'band', 'members', 'first', 'film', 'again', 'not', 'mention', 'great', 'music', 'John', 'Cafferty', 'Beaver', 'Brown', 'Band', 'first', 'movie', 'revolved', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'character', 'Frank', 'Wordman', 'absence', 'character', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'understand', 'was', 'need', 'center', 'around', 'Eddie', 'time', 'realizing', 'Eddie', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'obviously', 'audiences', 'were', 'intrigued', 'why', 'Eddie', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'great', 'finally', 'get', 'answers', 'directly', 'horse', 'mouth', 'sequel', 'changes', 'certain', 'key', 'elements', 'first', 'film', 'instance', 'beach', 'scene', 'took', 'place', 'Eddie', 'Wordman', 'was', 'spliced', 're-edited', 'show', 'Sal', 'Wordman', 'place', 'Also', 'unreleased', 'tapes', 'Season', 'Hell', 'were', 'given', 'character', 'Doc', 'distribute', 'not', 'Sal', 'sequel', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'almost', 'wiped', 'slate', 'clean', 'sequel.While', 'plot', 'simple', 'times', 'little', 'predictable', 'nevertheless', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Eddie', 'Wilson', 'death', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'music', 'skyrocketed', 'top', 'charts', 'matter', 'where', 'Eddie', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'being', 'deceased', 'find', 'Eddie', 'still', 'making', 'music', 'new', 'band', 'Eddie', 'Joe', 'called', 'sequel', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'truly', 'happy', 'not', 'there', 'doing', 'what', 'best.On', 'side', 'note', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'not', 'seeing', 'rest', 'band', 'members', 'first', 'movie', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'reaction', 'assumed', 'deceased', 'front', 'runner', 'live', 'stage', 'concert', 'took', 'place', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'fanboyism', 'reaching', 'out.Either', 'way', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'one', 'time', 'favortie', 'movies', 'sequel', 'was', 'decent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'love', 'old', 'time', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'John', 'Cafferty', 'films', 'was', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'Eddie', 'Cruiser', 'II', 'three', 'stars', 'excellent', 'music', 'star', 'own']",N/A

254565,A3N0AXNEZVE686,6301520084,Hound Dog,"[2, 2]","In the summer of 1989, the sequel ""Eddie & the Cruisers II - Eddie Lives!"" flickered out at movie theaters six years after the original cult classic film starring Tom Berenger and Michael Pare received a similarly disappointing box office reaction.  Torpedoed by bad reviews, minimal word-of-mouth, and a clunky title, this film at least had definite potential based upon John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band's energetic soundtrack and some lingering questions left behind by the original film's memorable ending.  This film explores whatever happened to hot James Dean-esque rock `n' roller, Eddie Wilson, after he mysteriously vanished in 1964.  ""Cruisers II"" depicts Eddie coming full circle twenty years later to decide what his beloved music's legacy will ultimately be.Unfortunately, a disjointed script, i.e. the absence of pivotal characters Frank Ridgeway (Tom Berenger) and Joann Carlino (Helen Schneider), leaves far too many gaping holes in this saga about how heartfelt rock `n' roll is a surefire cure for self-doubt and a means for personal redemption.  First off, how Eddie ended up in 1984 Montreal as a reclusive construction worker, alias ""Joe West,"" is never addressed; he is just simply there.  Also, Michael Pare inexplicably appears here as a thirty-something (much closer to the actor's age) instead of a mid-40's, graying Eddie.  By saving a few bucks on age make-up, the film has another huge continuity gaffe: why wouldn't anyone recognize Eddie (especially, upon shaving off his Robert Goulet-esque moustache) before his climactic confrontations with Sal Amato and then Lou Eisen?  Yes, it is inferred that those who actually knew Eddie would instantly recognize him, but viewers are expected to believe nobody else would.  That is simply a gross lapse in basic logic.  Suffice to say, the bearded, middle-aged Eddie's appearance in the original film's finale was far more believable.Besides Pare's Eddie Wilson, only Sal Amato (Matthew Laurence) returns in limited screen time to help generate credibility explaining away the screenplay's discrepancies.  Pare and Laurence briefly rekindle some of the original film's magic, but what is sorely missing here is an emotional pay-off reuniting Eddie, Frank, and Joann.  Instead, the sequel deliberately omits Tom Berenger from the flashbacks (presumably, to avoid paying him) and completely ignores Frank Ridgeway's impact on Eddie's former life.  Joann and ""Doc"" Robbins only briefly appear in the flashback background, which again denies recognition of these original Cruisers as ever being relevant to Eddie's world.  These exclusions further spell out the French-Canadian production team's willingness to go cheap on many aspects of this film.In fairness to the sequel's new ensemble cast, Marina Orsini (as Diane), Bernie Coulson (as Rick) and Anthony Sherwood (as Wilton) are solid performers doing their best with one-dimensional roles.  Throw in a decent, villainous appearance by Harvey Atkin (recast as sleazy record producer Lou Eisen), a quick cameo by Cafferty's sax player Michael Antunes (returning as Wendell Newton), and some other notable cameos (Larry King, Martha Quinn, etc.), and the film at least offers some very watchable performances (especially, in song).  Still, it all comes down to Michael Pare to anchor this ship, and he just isn't able to overcome the script's flaws. The reason why Eddie Wilson's enigmatic presence (bolstered by Pare's inspired, dynamic performance) in the original film worked so well is that it left viewers wanting to know more.  As this sequel's centerpiece, Eddie's grouchy, often selfish persona simply isn't likable enough to make most viewers sympathize with his unattained dreams.If this film (which plays like a direct-to-video release) had been made as a high-caliber HBO flick, it probably could have satisfied most fan expectations.  As an underwhelming big screen vehicle showcasing Pare, the film simply falls far short of justifying its existence.  In other words, one should enjoy ""Eddie & the Cruisers II"" wholeheartedly in its rightful place - on television, as its vivid Canadian scenery, decent acting, and John Cafferty's exhilarating, Jersey-style music make it at least a stellar feature-length rock video.Rating: 7/10 (10/10 for the soundtrack; 4/10 for the screenplay).P.S. The movie's source material about an ""Eddie"" mystery tape actually comes from author P.F. Kluge's novel.  No surprise, the book explores the mystery tape concept more coherently than ""Cruisers II"" does.",3,"Eddie Lives!

Cafferty both wrote and performed all of the music to the original film and this one. The latter stands on its own even if you know nothing about Eddie and the Cruisers. But the film is a Masterpiece. No tech gadgets, real talk between people, great screenplay, incredibly good story, realistic drama about how a Rock band actually comes into being! The acting by Micahel Pare is also his best work. Bon Jovi assisted in making the film as realistic as possible to the point where you never for one second think that it is not Michael Pare playing & singing along with every member of the band. Ms. Orsini is terrific as ""Eddie's"" girlfriend but she won't take any you-know-what from a guy that still has a lot of 'lovable' male superiority stuff to work through. All I can say is this. I don't understand why this film is not available - why it has been so hard to get even on VHS for years.
