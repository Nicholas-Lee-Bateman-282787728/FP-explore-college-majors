If you, however, like this kind of thing it would probably rate four stars. At times I found it difficult to determine just what the heck was going on and why. Perhaps that was do in part to the fact the series just didn't draw me in.

However, i already own the DVD collection which doesn't translate well on a flat screen TV. DVDs weren't meant 4 such large screen viewing, not meant for HD TVs, so i thought i would cave in and get the blu-ray set since it was such a bargain and decided to just get it. To my surprise, the blu-ray is exactly like the DVD in terms of aspect ratio. Thats right, the episodes to do not take up the entire screen. I pop in my DVD and blu-ray after one another and it is the same size. It is the show in square view and not rectangular view. Yes, the blu-ray is a bit clearer, but thats it. I wanted it to take up the entire screen. There are movies from the 1980's that have been released on blu-ray and take up the whole screen. The footage gets remastered, cleaned up, converted to 16:9 or whatever all that tech lingo means. Yes, my Samsung TV gives me the option to have the show appear across the whole screen, but i lose footage at the corners since it is being stretched beyond its capacity of what it was built 4 in terms of viewing. Anyways, i am done with my rant.Once again, this is a 5 star show. Special teens who can power special machines to save the earth. Just a rift off another anime show that is a rift off of another anime show, but you get the deal. Definitely pick this up since the price is such a bargain.

I was flipping threw the tv channels and I found this show on, so I started watching and heres what I found.Plot: The show starts off with a robot machine attacking an island thats hidding from the rest of the world. Honestly to me this show feels like it started off in the middle of the series and never explanes it.Characters: didnt finnish the show.Pros: ummm the art work is niceCons: after 4 episodes I gave up on this show, I 99% of the time NEVER give up on any anime I come across but this is just horrible, in my case I say if you dont get what happening after the very first episode then stop watching it, so I gave it till episode 4 before I quit. I honestly wish I never saw the series on tv because its so dreadfully bad, I feel as if theres no story, you can have all the action and people beating on eachother you want but without a story or even anything being memeroiable about the characters then the whole show is crap",1,More boring than watching paint dry,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,972,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'was', 'flipping', 'threw', 'tv', 'channels', 'found', 'show', 'started', 'watching', 'what', 'found.Plot', 'show', 'off', 'robot', 'machine', 'attacking', 'island', 'thats', 'hidding', 'rest', 'world', 'Honestly', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'middle', 'series', 'never', 'it.Characters', 'didnt', 'finnish', 'show.Pros', 'ummm', 'art', 'work', 'niceCons', '4', 'episodes', 'gave', 'up', 'show', '99', '%', 'time', 'NEVER', 'give', 'up', 'anime', 'come', 'just', 'horrible', 'case', 'say', 'dont', 'get', 'what', 'happening', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'stop', 'watching', 'gave', 'till', '4', 'quit', 'honestly', 'wish', 'never', 'saw', 'series', 'tv', 'so', 'dreadfully', 'bad', 'feel', 'story', 'can', 'have', 'action', 'people', 'beating', 'want', 'story', 'even', 'anything', 'being', 'memeroiable', 'characters', 'then', 'whole', 'show', 'crap']",N/A
1550646,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B008D1RCMW,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 2]","I will admit that the entire series on Blu-ray DVD combo for $60 MSRP and a current $43 price is more than fair. You get all 26 episodes here. Good bang for the buck.  Also note that this is a re-release of an existing series in the US by Geneon, who went under a few years ago.  Funimation picked up the license for this series.So why 3 stars?  The problem is that the series just isn't that great. It starts off promisingly enough, but the characters start becoming less interesting as the series progresses. You really do get a lot of the 'whiny' style characters, obviously many are based off Evangelion characters. The series goes in a more space age futuristic style though. I would compare the world to that in Eureka Seven (which is a better series by far).  The character designs were all by Hisashi Hirai, who is famous for Gundam Seed and a few other series.  The mecha designer is Naohiro Washio, famous for StarCraft and Gundam 00.  If you notice, the characters are remarkable similar to Gundam Seed characters and the mecha are similar to the Thrones and the Enacts in Gundam 00.  This only serves to render comparison to superior series with superior writing.The writers seem to relish in killing off characters right after they seem to become more interesting. One example, a character says it's his last battle and he is stepping down to take care of his kid. Then he gets twisted into a bloody corkscrew in that last battle. Nice. But that kind of sums up what happens throughout. The problem is that the series starts well, so you are hooked into it. By the time you near the end you just keep pushing forward just so you can finish it.  I discovered that they switched chief script writers halfway through.  Tow Ubukata, took over halfway through, he is famous for Le Chevalier D'Eon and Mardock Scramble.  Both of those series were uneven in my opinion as well.The voice acting is pretty good, though not to the level of matching characters up like in Gundam and Code Geass (another two series much better than this). The intro music is pretty awful. Some people may enjoy it, but it was like nails on a chalkboard to me. The character designer did work on Gundam SEED, and you can really see the similarity to those characters, so much that Kazuki looks like he could be Kira Yamato's brother. The designs of the Fafners are pretty neat, but not as slick as the mechs from Eureka Seven or as well designed as those from Gundam 00.The animation is superb though, but it's pretty without substance. Kind of like the hottie at the bar who is amazing until she opens her mouth to speak. This is a series better seen and not heard! First half of the series is a solid A, second half is a C-.  It's just your standard mecha anime filled with cliches and characters who just aren't that endearing.  Gundam 00 is a much better purchase for a series in this style.

It is a self sustained island that is a source of hope in a world overrun with alien invaders called The Festum. The teenagers that live on this island pilot mechas called Fafner. Fafner is the only means for destroying The Festum. Kazuki is the greatest warrior among the Fafner pilots. He has a strong sense of justice and loyalty to his loved ones. He risks everything, along with his friends, to protect humanity.There are a lot of mecha series out there. This one is above average. It doesn't reach the level of Evangelion, but it's a heck of a lot better than Gasraki. I think that it is most like RahXephon.

There is plenty of action and drama is Fafner as well.After hearing all of that you're probably wondering, ""why not 5 stars then""? The reason I can't give it 5 stars is b/c some of the characters seemed very distant. Even though the characters feelings and love for each other was a major theme, the relationships between them weren't developed very well. I think that the psychology of the Fafner pilots was focused on too much. The thing that would have made this series great was stronger relationships between them. This is the reason It wasn't great.
