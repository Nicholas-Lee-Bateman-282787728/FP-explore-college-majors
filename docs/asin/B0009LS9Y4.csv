907947,A28JK8TWOMD3TX,B0009LS9Y4,Cindy M,"[0, 0]","At first I thought this DVD was kind of hokey, and had too much emphasis on the &#34;Silly&#34; and &#34;Fun&#34; and not enough on the subject matter.  I wasn't even sure my daughter could discern the subject matter among the silly stuff.  But there wasn't anything else out there so I bought it and watched it with my daughter and tried to emphasize the important details as we watched.  Then she watched it herself, several times, because she liked it.  Well, this DVD might have saved her life.  At a birthday party in a busy, public place, I dropped her off for 20 minutes (with 12 other moms there) before I returned and a stranger tried to coax her away from the group!!  She didn't even mention it until days later (!) and when she did, she did it so casually that I had to stop and say, &#34;WHAT?!&#34; and have her repeat it.  She told me &#34;I did what Safe Side Super Chick said...&#34; and she followed the advice.  I was stunned, to say the least.

We found ourselves constantly raising and lowering the volume since things are happening so fast in the movie.  It may just be a defect in our particular DVD.... we will check into it.Now the good news! This is an EXCELLENT movie to teach kids about protecting themselves from strangers.  Super Safe Chick (SSC)is VERY VERY funny!  My dd actually wants to dress up as her for Halloween. So many clever things in this dvd..like when SSC is in certain situations she wears clothing that is either Green (in safe situations), Amber (in cautious ones) and Red (in danger type situations).  She teaches the kids about the 3 types of people in their lives (""Safe Side Adults"" - mom, dad, and others whom mom and dad have given their trust,  ""Kinda Knows"" - family friends, neighbors, coaches, teachers,  and ""Don't Knows"" - anyone not in the other 2 categories)The movie shows certain situations - ie standing in line at the ice cream truck - SSC is in her red outfit,  hanging at home she is in her green outfit until the doorbell rings... her outfit turns red and she is upset because she knows she shouldn't answer the door without her Safe Side Adult present.  The doorbell keeps ringing and getting louder and she gets louder herself saying ""Some people hate hearing the doorbell ring and they want to answer it - but I won't!  My Safe Side Adult is not here""...then her mom appears and they open the door together and she is back in her green outfit. VERY CLEVER!!!She practices with the kids yelling ""This is not my Mom, This is not my Dad"" - so of course my kids were shouting it for about 30 minutes at the top of their lungs.  But it opened up a wonderful discussion.  We made our list of Safe Side Adults and people who fell into the other category.  The movie is VERY quick - things happen quickly so while my 3 yr old LOVED watching it....she got minimal out of it except what to yell and not to open the door or follow people looking for animals.  But my 9 year old asked us questions for about an hour afterwards.  I would think children ages 5-12 would get the most out of it.  But adults will find it perfect for opening conversations - and very funny even though a very serious topic.",5,Content EXCELLENT...

907957,A3MYF59QZOAN67,B0009LS9Y4,KMT,"[1, 1]","When I'd first seen this video, I thought it would be a great way to help my very friendly 5 year old learn a bit about 'stranger danger' without scaring her.  Having been big fans of the 'Baby Einstein' series, it gave me confidence that the video would be informative and entertaining; it is.  Safe Side Superchick is silly, but with a serious topic like this, a little levity seems to help keep the focus on the educational aspect, without scaring small ones.One really great thing that has come out of putting this video in our home repertoire is that my 5 year old asks me questions from time to time about things that she's seen in the program.  It lets me know that she's thinking about what she's watching, and that her 5 year old brain is learning that there is a need to be safe, but without being frightened.The only downside that we've experienced is that the DVD itself has always been 'difficult' for our DVD player to read.

And for that, the Walshes have become multi-millionaires and authorities on abducted children. No one should discount the pain of a murdered child, but neither should those who have contributed to the death be rewarded and revered. Neither the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children nor John Walsh have ever found a stranger-abducted child, living or dead.The fact of the matter is that there are extremely few stranger abductions of children, and when there are, we hear about them on the news. Most of the photographing and fingerprinting events are simply scare tactics to be able for those involved in the missing children racket to raise money. Ernie Allen, the CEO of NCMEC took home $1,344,567 in salary in 2008 and in 2006 and 2007, Walsh, took more than $76,572 from contributions to pay for his medical bills. [The St. Petersburg Times article detailing these facts may be found by Googling ""Ernie Allen"" salary]. It seems like at least some of that money could have gone to pay for a full-time case worker. But it didn't and it won't. NCMEC totally botched the Elizabeth Smart case, where both she and her abductor were a quarter of a mile away across open terrain, watching the search.But Walsh and the National Center have become iconic, immune to criticism or public scrutiny.",1,Stranger Danger or Fear Tactics,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,1959,"['founder', 'national', 'organization', 'deals', 'missing', 'exploited', 'children', 'two', 'years', 'senior', 'National', 'Center', 'find', 'remarkable', 'John', 'Walsh', 'video', 'stranger', 'danger', '2005', 'when', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'Nancy', 'McBride', 'article', 'stating', 'concept', 'stranger', 'danger', 'not', 'effective', 'National', 'Center', 'article', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'Googling', 'Stranger', 'Danger', ']', 'fact', 'John', 'Walsh', 'continually', 'cloak', 'Robert', 'Stack/Elliot', 'Ness', 'grandeur', 'only', 'reason', 'son', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'was', 'wife', 'left', 'alone', 'crowded', 'department', 'store', 'went', 'off', 'do', 'shopping', 'Walshes', 'have', 'become', 'multi-millionaires', 'authorities', 'abducted', 'children', 'one', 'should', 'discount', 'pain', 'murdered', 'child', 'should', 'who', 'have', 'contributed', 'death', 'be', 'rewarded', 'revered', 'National', 'Center', 'Missing', 'Exploited', 'Children', 'John', 'Walsh', 'have', 'ever', 'found', 'stranger-abducted', 'child', 'living', 'dead.The', 'fact', 'matter', 'are', 'extremely', 'few', 'stranger', 'abductions', 'children', 'when', 'are', 'hear', 'news', 'Most', 'photographing', 'fingerprinting', 'events', 'are', 'simply', 'scare', 'tactics', 'be', 'able', 'involved', 'missing', 'children', 'racket', 'raise', 'money', 'Ernie', 'Allen', 'CEO', 'NCMEC', 'took', 'home', '1,344,567', 'salary', '2008', '2006', '2007', 'Walsh', 'took', 'more', '76,572', 'contributions', 'pay', 'medical', 'bills', '[', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Times', 'article', 'detailing', 'facts', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'Googling', 'Ernie', 'Allen', 'salary', ']', 'least', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'pay', 'full-time', 'case', 'worker', 'did', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'NCMEC', 'totally', 'botched', 'Elizabeth', 'Smart', 'case', 'where', 'abductor', 'were', 'quarter', 'mile', 'away', 'open', 'terrain', 'watching', 'search.But', 'Walsh', 'National', 'Center', 'have', 'become', 'iconic', 'immune', 'criticism', 'public', 'scrutiny']",The Safe Side - Stranger Safety: Hot Tips To Keep Cool Kids Safe With People They Don't Know And Kinda Know

907966,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0009LS9Y4,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""Stranger Safety"" is a well-designed program that teaches children (I would say ages 5-12) how to avoid dangerous situations with people they are not very familiar with and/or are completely unfamiliar with. I liked that the program uses certain identifying words to describe these people, that is instead of referring to these people as ""strangers"", the terms ""don't knows"" and ""kinda knows"" are used instead. This makes a lot of sense as many young children really don't comprehend who/what strangers are.The narrator is an adorable (read= kid friendly) lady who depending on the message she's sending, dresses either in green (safe situations), yellow (cautionary situations), and red (dangerous situations). Through re-enactments, children are taught how to always remain with Safe Side Adults (people they trust such as mom, dad, grandparents, teachers) and how to handle situations that may put them at risk. These scenarios make it clear what is to be expected and how to cope. For example, let's say a child has accidentally become separated from his/her Safe Side Adult, what is the child to do? According to the program, the child is to approach an adult (e.g. a mom) with children and ask for help, or when feeling unsafe (e.g. being approached by a Don't Know), to yell loudly and run away.The tricky situation is when a child is approached by a Kinda Knows type - e.g. a coach, an acquaintance of mom or dad, basically people the child recognizes and is somewhat familiar with, but is not on the Safe Side Adult list. The program makes it clear what the child should not do - that is NOT to follow this Kinda Know types when he/she approaches the child and asks the child to follow.I truly felt the program addressed some major safety concerns regarding strangers and after pre-viewing it, I felt confident enough to watch it again with my child and discuss the concerns with her. The total running time is about 42 minutes. The show may address a serious issue, but it does so in a fun and lighthearted way so as not to scare children off.
