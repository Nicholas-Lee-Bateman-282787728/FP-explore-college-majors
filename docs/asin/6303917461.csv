388455,A86QD3XO8ZXI8,6303917461,"Aficianado, ""Music, Film and Book Lover""","[1, 2]","Academy award material this is not but it is a very solid ""B"" level crime thriller, one worth repeated viewings. After viewing it the first time, I was astonished to find that it had been made in 1976. The post World War II America it depicted was so authentic looking that I had assumed it had actually been made in the mid 40's (the time in which it was set) or at the latest, during the 1950's. As I saw the story unfolding, I kept thinking ""did we really look and act that way as a culture at one time"" and ""how did those boxy old cars with comic book styling and high centers of gravity ever stay on the road""?As for the story itself (done in semi-documentary style), it is absolutely riveting and I've watched it many times now. I couldn't help but notice the similarities between the Texarkana ""Phantom"" saga and the story of the Zodiac killer which terrorized Northern California during the 1970's (and who was never caught or identified) as well as the Maryland/DC Beltway Sniper of 2002 (who of course was later identified as two persons and eventually apprehended). In all 3 cases, the killer (or killers) held an entire community in such terror that citizens were afraid to go about their normal daily lives.A great deal of the terror of all 3 aforementioned situations is that during the times that the crimes were being committed, the identity of the killer (s) was a complete mystery. The fear that gripped the Texarkana community during the crimes was more pungent because the killer, although he was actually seen at times was always cloaked in a scary looking hood and never identified. He could have been the guy working next to you on the assembly line, the guy repairing your car at the corner garage or even a teacher at the local school.The lasting terror of the Texarkana ""Phantom"" also comes from the fact that not only was he unknown during the time of his crimes but he has apparently remained unidentified ever since, much like London's famous ""Jack the Ripper"", whose identity continues to remain a mystery as well.If Scotland Yard were ever to announce that ""Jack the Ripper"" had been positively and finally identified as say, ""Joe Smith of such and such an address"", the mystery would be gone, people would stop speculating on who he actually was, the legend would diminish and ""Jack"" would become just another of the countless criminals who inhabit our prisons or fill our prison cemeteries. The same would almost certainly be true of the Texarkana ""Phantom"".The scenes involving the hooded killer are absolutely terrifying. The quality of the film overall is quite good, better than you might expect for a movie of this type and most fans of the genre will want to view it more than once.  A few of the scenes in the movie represent attempts at humor but which in my opinion are much less successful than the terror scenes. They probably would have been better left out.  Ironically, those less successful scenes which attempt to portray humor involve a police officer character named ""Spark Plug"", who is actually portrayed by the film's director, Charles R. Pierce.The VHS tape I have and am writing this review about is from ""Orion"" Pictures and Warner Home Video. The original release tape of the movie, it is in mono sound and SP mode and the picture quality is extremely good for a VHS tape. I notice that it was re-released by ""Goodtimes Video"" in 2001. I can't comment on the quality of the version by the now defunct ""Goodtimes"" video (which I haven't viewed) other than to say while ""Goodtimes"" video provided a valuable service by making movies available to home viewers which couldn't otherwise be found, their videos are often in EP mode, which is generally of slightly lower video quality than tapes produced in SP mode.Both tape versions are now out of print but as of this writing both are still available on Amazon Marketplace at reasonable prices. The SP version, at least right now isn't much higher in price than the ""Goodtimes"" version on Amazon Marketplace so it's worth seeking a copy out.This movie is one of a number of films which I consider ""overlooked gems"" which cry out for release on DVD but which for some unknown reason have not yet made to that medium.  I certainly hope that there is an effort underway somewhere to make this worthwhile movie available on DVD. And.....one final note to potential viewers....I can absolutely guarantee that after seeing this movie, you will never *EVER* go parking on a lovers lane late at night again (if anyone still does, that is)!",4,"A True Crime ""Find"" That Badly Needs a DVD Release!",1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,4535,"['Academy', 'award', 'material', 'not', 'very', 'solid', 'B', 'level', 'crime', 'thriller',

Before there was Jason Voorhees, there was the Phantom Killer of Texarkana. While the horror aspects were pretty good by the standards, the direction of the film was quite weak in most ways. If Sparkplug was never shown in it, The Town That Dreaded Sundown would have turned out better and a more enjoyable film to watch. If in the end of the closing statements in terms of what happened to the characters did not include Sparkplug, then why bother having him in the film in the first place?

It is not bad, however. It is nowhere as bad as Charles Pierce's (the director) other schlock movie, known as &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot;). This pseudo-documentary depicts the story of a burlap bag hooded killer who scopes out lovers' lane people then attacks, mames, and sometimes murders them (unless they miraculously escape or survive the attack). I've read that Jason in Friday the 13th, Part 2 is dressed up to resemble the killer in this movie. Yes, this movie is based on a true life event.

388461,AT57B36BHDQ00,6303917461,Big Mike,"[0, 0]","This has been so long neglected and so long overdue for a DVD/Blu-Ray release. It is finally going to become reality on May 21, 2013. Thank you so much Shout Factory. Also, included will be a bonus film of the director Charles B. Pierce's ""The Evictors"" from 1979, a lesser known film that is also ""based on a true story"". Being originally from rural, small-town, Georgia, U.S.A., I can easily relate to the similar, real-life setting of Texarkana, Arkansas. Anyone looking for a high-quality, gripping, intense and suspenseful story, need look no further. It's made all the more horrific because it is based on real-life, unsolved serial killings in 1946 Texarkana. It is maybe somewhat deceptive and misleading to those viewers who are looking for horror films to rent or to buy. It's packaging may give the appearance of being just another cheap slasher or stalker film. The real surprise awaiting many unwary viewers may come when they discover that it is not just another cheap Friday the 13th or Halloween imitation, but in fact, actually pre-dates both films and their countless sequels. Ben Johnson, as he always did, made acting look easy, was such a wonderful and fine, natural, vastly underrated actor and gives an impressive performance here as Texas Ranger, Captain ""Lone Wolf"" J.D. Morales. Andrew Prine, as Miller County, Arkansas Deputy Sheriff Norman Ramsey, is great in a key supporting role. Dawn Wells (Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island) is very lovely and is also excellent in all too brief role, as a would-be victim of The Phantom Killer, Mrs. Helen Reed. The violence, although while it is quite jarring and effective, is generally low-key and takes place, thankfully, mostly off-camera. The main exception is the infamous ""trombone"" scene, while it is maybe not as graphically bloody and explicit by today's gorehound's highly questionable standards, it is always very hard to watch and is much more disturbing than the goriest scenes in the Friday the 13th films. Perhaps this particular scene is made all the more unpleasant and is much more difficult to watch because it is shown from The Phantom Killer's sadistic point-of-view, as well as from the victim's. This film always makes me feel just a little bit uneasy about walking or sitting in front of the windows in my house at night, even to this very day. Perhaps the most unsettling thing of all is the knowledge that the film's basis is all too factual and quite chillingly, that The Phantom Killer was never caught and the most frightening thing of all is the undeniable knowledge that something similar could still happen today, anywhere, at anytime. The extremely unlikely and sometimes even surprisingly slapstick humor and comedy relief are both somewhat out-of-place for a film of this kind, are also inappropriate and overdone and are quite often too much, almost to the point of giving you the feeling that you are watching two different films at the same time, but maybe they do give the film a much-needed break and some pleasant and comforting relief from the otherwise, unrelenting and almost documentary-like, grim storyline. Not a huge budget or great production values (not unlike the original Night Of The Living Dead), except for a quite surprisingly authentic 1940's feel and excellent use of on-location filming. The acting (except for director Charles B. Pierce's own portrayal of a Barney Fife-like police officer, Patrolman A.C. ""Sparkplug"" Benson), is more than adequate and is generally, well-cast. Director Pierce did a mostly acceptable job behind the camera, but it would have been an even better film if he had been content with staying there, as he quite obviously should have done. Well worth a look just as it is, though, far from perfect it may be. Hopefully, it will also be made available on DVD someday, complete with some extras, such as the original film trailer and maybe some behind-the-scenes features. All-in-all, one of the very best adaptations of a fact-based story that has ever been done on film. As the film's narrator says early-on, ""The story you are about to see is true, only the names have been changed........"" (Maybe someone was a big fan of Dragnet!)

First, it's an amazing docudrama / thriller that actually manages to use  narration (sparingly) to heighten tension, and not simply to state facts. Second, the killer is masked, silent, and terrifying; predating those similar psychos of the fictional variety (i.e.: Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers). Third, TTTDS is an excellent police procedural. If you enjoy REAL CRIME-type shows, then you'll love this! Andrew Prine (GRIZZLY) and Ben Johnson (THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, TERROR TRAIN) are well-cast in their roles as sheriff and Texas Ranger respectively. Also, seeing Dawn Wells (yep.

It should stand alongside Halloween, Black Christmas and Friday the 13th as one of the best slasher movies. It's based on a true story which adds to the fear factor. Academy Award Winner Ben Johnson gives the movie a touch of class acting and great hero to oppose The Phantom Killer. The movie can seem dated and the documentary style might not suite all viewers who like Friday the 13th, Halloween and others but the killer is scary. Before Jason ever wore his mask doing the heavy breathing the killer in this movie does it to a frightening effect. One of the scariest scenes in the film help's capture the viewer's imagination and realize there are killers out there who could be lurking right outside your home. It was a very terrifying scene. Dawn Wells does a great job in the movie too as most remember her from Gilligan's Island.  The suspense is great as the victims are up against when they face The Phantom Killer. There is the classic Lovers Lane scene which is scary that satisfies any true horror fan as it is reminiscent of the classic Urban Legend about the man with the hook. One of the great dimensions to this film is the mystery of the identity of the killer. What are his motivations and what drives him. I really enjoyed the ending and was not disappointed. Like stated before the fact that this killer is real makes him all the more terrifying. This movie will scare you. It's a must see for any true horror movie fan.

388468,AGCM5TT91IRAH,6303917461,"Creepy Skulldini ""a time for slime""","[1, 3]","Set during the 1940's in a rural town called Texarkana ( in Arkansas ), this is the purportedly true story of a crime case involving a terrible and alarming series of murders and assaults of a gruesome, bizzarre and perplexing nature committed by a mysterious assailant known as ""The Phantom"" which drew so much notoriety that famed Texas Ranger J.P Morales was assigned to conduct the investigation of the case, which still, none the less, went unsolved.This movie is, as you may have already supposed, one of those masked psycho stalker / killer flicks. However, interestingly, it came out in the middle 1970's, .. years before Halloween and Friday the 13th ( which are the movies often credited as starting, or at least popularizing, that particular breed of horror movie ), though it wasn't the commercial blockbuster THOSE flicks were for whatever reason, and ( once again ) takes place in the 40's ( instead of present times like Halloween, Friday and other slasher films ). Perhaps it came too early for it's own good, being released at a time when Devil movies ( post-Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and Omen ) and killer animal flicks ( post-Jaws, Grizzly, Willard ) were still the rage where horror movies were concerned and masked slasher killers weren't yet a bonafide full-fledged cinematic craze. Or maybe it was the un-contemporary setting, .. or the fact that it focused mainly on the police investigators as the main characters( as opposed to the young victims or killer ), .. or all three of those. Anyway, THAT is a matter of speculation I suppose. But, despite it's relative obscurity, I've always considered THIS one to be truly one of the BEST films of that particular subgenre.The ""Phantom"" killer is very frightening and sinister yet still totally realistic and believable. Masked in a plain dirty soiled sack cloth with only his intense ominous blazing eyes visible though simple holes cut in the fabric and fastened to his neck with a piece of rope and panting very heavily ( the only sound he seems to make ), so much so that he draws the cloth against his face each time he inhales, as he bears down on his victims. He attacks couples ( usually in secluded parked cars at ""lovers lanes"" or, in one case, someones home ), targeting the female for pleasure ( subjecting her to some form of sadistic abuse like ""literally chewing"" parts of her body or, in one instance, using a trombone (( musical instrument)) with a knife attached to it as an instrument of torture and murder, and even leaving one of them alive ) and simply killing the male just to eliminate him ( using a gun or bludgeoning him with an iron bar ).Another notable and intriguing thing about this psycho is how he goes from being apparently very calculating and practical when dealing with his male victims ( in one scene, for example, quickly opening a cars hood and ripping out it's battery thus disabling the vehicle ) to being seemingly playful and almost infantile in a very demented way with his female victims.Unlike Jason or Micheal Meyers, this assailant has, as already touched on in this review, a sick sado sexual bent ( perhaps THAT's one reason he didn't become as popular? . .. who knows!). He also, unlike THOSE two screen killers, does not do anything very far fetched like rise up again and attack after being shot, hung or burned in a fire.The 1940's setting and atmosphere is also very realistically detailed and very accomplished considering that this was an independent regionally-made film ( not a major Hollywood studio film ).The only thing I didn't care for much was this comedic Barney Fife-style schtick involving this bungling police officer named Patrolman Benson ( nicknamed ""Sparkplug"" ), though the parts where the two undercover cops, one of whom is in drag, posing as lovers in a parked car are admittedly pretty funny ( ""I wana know why this ones bigger than THIS one?"" .. ""What damn difference does it make?! You think I'm gona let the son of a bitch fondle em before I blow his damn head off ?!!"" ). There's also a pretty long car chase sequence ( in a subplot where the cops have been sidetracked by this petty criminal who'd falsely confessed to the killings ). Ultimately however, this is a good well-made and frightening little flick which was, again, notably ahead of it's time by a few years.Oh, and screen veteran Ben Johnson also gives a great and memorable performance as Captain Morales. Just hearing him utter the best line in the whole flick ""What really bothers me about this whole godd@3n case is that this go%%@mn murderin pervert could be passing us on the street ten times a day and we don't know it!!"" is a treasure in it's self!",4,"""He's abnormal.""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,4673,"['Set', '1940', 'rural', 'town', 'called', 'Texarkana', 'Arkansas', 'purportedly',

If you're familiar with that movie, it will give you an idea of what ""Town that Dreaded..."" is like: cheap production, wooden acting, and, like ""Boggy Creek"", some narration to fill in the gaps. But still, it ain't bad. I bought it when it came out on VHS all those years ago and enjoyed watching it again after about twenty-plus years.

388470,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,6303917461,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","The year is 1946 and while some last minute soldiers are still making their way home, most of them are already back from the war and are starting up families, going to work or school, or just enjoying their time at home. Little did they know that on this day, Sunday, March 3rd, that a hooded killer would begin his onslaught right here in Texarkana, Arkansas. They call him The Phantom Killer and his legacy begins here and now.This film is in some desperate need of restoration and an official DVD release, for that matter. The dated film reel is too dark during most of the scenes I wanted to see most, which is just about every scene with The Phantom Killer since most of his kills take place at night. I feel it hurts the film more than anything. If it was just grainy throughout the film, then it'd kind of add to the general feel of the movie. The film is not only grainy, but the colors also bleed into each other, lighting is off in some scenes, some scenes have terrible audio quality, and some scenes wind up being too dark to see what's going on. I understand that the film was a bit low budget and it's basically a B-grade horror film, but restoration would help in some aspect.Getting back to the B-grade horror film point, the film definitely lives up to that moniker. The acting is pretty bad, for the most part. Ben Johnson and Andrew Prine are pretty much as good as you're going to get in the cast as Captain J.D. Morales and Deputy Norman Ramsey. Everyone else is pretty much what you'd expect in a film like this. The silly attempts at humor really hurt the film more than anything. I mean, do you really want to see Patrolman A.C. ""Spark Plug"" Benson dress up in drag and basically get felt up by a fellow officer? Or cop cars running around in circles when they're in the middle of a high speed chase? Seriously, all that was missing was the Benny Hill music. Spark Plug is pretty much the comedy relief of the film and, in my opinion, just doesn't really need to be there to begin with.While the film does have its drawbacks, what is done right is done fairly well. Some of the killings are pretty creative. The trombone kill is probably the scene that'll be the one anyone brings up first when this film comes up in conversation. The opening kill scene is the one I was referencing about being too dark at times, but what you can make out is pretty intense. The darkness puts the viewer a bit more on edge as you don't really know where the killer is going to pop up next or what he's going to do to his victims. Speaking of the victims, most of them do a really good job of acting terrified. It seems so genuine at times. I also liked The Phantom Killer. When someone with a mask over his face is generally able to express emotion somehow through body movements or body language, I find that pretty impressive. The breathing heavily through the sack over his face was a bit over the top on one hand, but really added to the character on the other.I guess my biggest gripe with the film is that I wanted more of The Phantom Killer and less of the cops rounding up the troops and acting silly. It just left me wanting more. With a film that's based on true events around a killer that was never caught and the murders never fully solved, the open ended finale doesn't help a whole lot either.The Town That Dreaded Sundown could be considered a hidden gem to many people. Despite the fact it was silly, over the top at times, and was basically a part of the films that sparked the slasher horror film genre(which could be good or bad depending on what your opinion on slashers is), I still enjoyed it and recommend hunting it down.

Many of those have crossed my path recently thanks to Scream Factory. They've made it a habit to dig up the cult classic gems of the past and give them a much-deserved upgrade to high-definition. Two such movies I failed to see over the years are ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" and ""The Evictors.""""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" is based on a true story that occurred in 1946. Famed Texas Ranger J.D. Morales is called into Texarkana by Deputy Norman Ramsey after one young couple are beaten and tortured and another murdered on back county roads. Ramsey and Morales both suspect the incidents are tied together. They combine the forces of the local police and the Texas Rangers to catch the ""Phantom Killer"" before he can strike again.""The Evictors"" takes place in a rural Louisiana town in 1942 and is also based on a true story. A young couple from New Orleans move into their dream house in the woods of Louisiana. The home seems ideal for a wife to fix up while the husband is out working his new job. The previous owners are still attached to the house and will do anything they have to in order to get it back for themselves. The new owners begin to fear for their lives as a mysterious stranger stalks and violently threatens them.I've found a new favorite director in Charles B. Pierce. He is the perfect example of a filmmaker who doesn't need to lean on graphic imagery and gore to get a viewer's blood pumping. He is a believer in the ""less is more"" school of thought and it works perfectly for him. Pierce slowly builds tension and then lets it explode on you at the last minute. You know something dreadful is coming but are still creeped out about it when it finally arrives.Both ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" and ""The Evictors"" had a similar impact on me. Although they're not completely true stories, all you have to do is a little investigating to know there's still quite a bit of validity in what happens onscreen. I think that's what makes the films even more frightening. The thought that real people went through these ordeals in some form or another.I also found it interesting that besides some bad language, ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" and ""The Evictors"" was rather clean for these types of movies. There wasn't any nudity to be seen. I was wondering why this was until I read that director Pierce was a Baptist. A scene in ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" featuring a preacher praying at a school dance suddenly made perfect sense to me as well.""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" is presented in 1080p high-definition widescreen (2.35:1) with 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound. The picture has great clarity while still holding on to its independent graininess and flavor. Would it have been nice to get an upgraded 5.1 surround sound mix for this? Of course, but it doesn't affect the viewing experience too much.""The Evictors"" is only available as a bonus feature on the DVD. Nothing fancy has been done to it, but it still looks good and will please genre fans that haven't seen this in any other format besides VHS.The special features are all on the Blu-ray and focus on ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown."" Audio commentary is provided by Justin Beahm and Historian Jim Presley. Three separate interviews with actors Andrew Prine and Dawn Wells and Director of Photography James Roberson are featured. An essay about the film and the real life murderer entitled ""The Phantom of Texarkana"" is included as well. We also get a theatrical trailer and a poster and still gallery.""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack is a worthy addition to any horror enthusiast's home entertainment collection. It features two thrilling films many consider to be classic genre pictures. Both are perfect examples of suspenseful movies that deliver scares without all the blood and guts, proving once again that what we don't see is much more frightening than what we do.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown""",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,4003,"['are', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '40', 'years', 'life', 'inexcusable', 'have', 'missed', 'Many', 'have', 'crossed', 'path', 'recently', 'thanks', 'Scream', 'Factory', ""'ve"", 'made', 'habit', 'dig', 'up', 'cult', 'classic', 'gems', 'past', 'give', 'much-deserved', 'upgrade', 'high-definition', 'Two', 'such', 'movies', 'failed', 'see', 'years', 'are', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Evictors', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'occurred', '1946', 'Famed', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'J.D', 'Morales', 'called', 'Texarkana', 'Deputy', 'Norman', 'Ramsey', 'one', 'young', 'couple', 'are', 'beaten', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'back', 'county', 'roads', 'Ramsey', 'Morales', 'suspect', 'incidents', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'combine', 'forces', 'local', 'police', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'catch', 'Phantom', 'Killer', 'can', 'strike', 'again', 'Evictors', 'place', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'town', '1942', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'New', 'Orleans', 'move', 'dream', 'house', 'woods', 'Louisiana', 'home', 'ideal', 'wife', 'fix', 'up', 'husband', 'out', 'working', 'new', 'job', 'previous', 'owners', 'are', 'still', 'attached', 'house', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'have', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'new', 'owners', 'begin', 'fear', 'lives', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'stalks', 'violently', 'them.I', ""'ve"", 'found', 'new', 'favorite', 'director', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', 'perfect', 'example', 'filmmaker', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'lean', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'gore', 'get', 'viewer', 'blood', 'pumping', 'believer', 'less', 'more', 'school', 'thought', 'perfectly', 'Pierce', 'slowly', 'tension', 'then', 'explode', 'last', 'minute', 'know', 'something', 'dreadful', 'coming', 'are', 'still', 'creeped', 'out', 'when', 'finally', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Evictors', 'had', 'similar', 'impact', ""'re"", 'not', 'completely', 'true', 'stories', 'have', 'do', 'little', 'investigating', 'know', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'validity', 'what', 'onscreen', 'think', 'what', 'films', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', 'thought', 'real', 'people', 'went', 'ordeals', 'form', 'another.I', 'also', 'found', 'interesting', 'bad', 'language', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Evictors', 'was', 'rather', 'clean', 'types', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'nudity', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'read', 'director', 'Pierce', 'was', 'Baptist', 'scene', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'featuring', 'preacher', 'praying', 'school', 'dance', 'suddenly', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'well', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'presented', '1080p', 'high-definition', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', '2.0', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Mono', 'sound', 'picture', 'great', 'clarity', 'still', 'holding', 'independent', 'graininess', 'flavor', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'upgraded', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'course', ""n't"", 'affect', 'viewing', 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'Evictors', 'only', 'available', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Nothing', 'fancy', 'been', 'done', 'still', 'good', 'will', 'please', 'genre', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'format', 'VHS.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'Blu-ray', 'focus', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Justin', 'Beahm', 'Historian', 'Jim', 'Presley', 'Three', 'separate', 'interviews', 'actors', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'Director', 'Photography', 'James', 'Roberson', 'are', 'featured', 'essay', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'murderer', 'entitled', 'Phantom', 'Texarkana', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'get', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'poster', 'still', 'gallery', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'worthy', 'addition', 'horror', 'enthusiast', 'home', 'entertainment', 'collection', 'two', 'thrilling', 'films', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'classic', 'genre', 'pictures', 'are', 'perfect', 'examples', 'suspenseful', 'movies', 'deliver', 'scares', 'blood', 'guts', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'what', 'do']",Town That Dreaded Sundown VHS

Each film is on its own disc too, rather than crammed together onto one, which is nice. TTTDS has some decent shocks and moments of genuine tension that make it quite watchable. Too bad that director Pierce didn't fire actor Pierce. He's just not that good and honestly isn't at all funny. His shtick might have been easier to take IF this film were a light-hearted southern comedy like Smokey & The Bandit or something. But it's not. It's a true life-based story of a string of unsolved post-WWII murders. Perhaps director Pierce wanted to keep the movie from being too grim or was trying to pad out the running time. Whatever his reasons, it doesn't work. He pretty much brings the movie to a screeching halt whenever he's on screen doing his decidedly UNfunny 'Sparkplug' character shenanigans. Stick to directing, Charley. Apparently he couldn't resist doing double duty in his later films, because he also takes center stage in his third &#34;Boggy Creek&#34; film which, for reasons unknown, is entitled &#34;The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek II&#34;?? He's actually not too bad in that one, but then that whole film is pretty much a mess. I don't know if Pierce decided to try his hand at acting because he's a self-absorbed ham (possible), or if he was just too cheap to hire a real actor (more likely).The Blu-ray presentation of these two films looks very nice considering their history which, unfortunately, is the same for most of Pierce's work. Try finding a quality copy of the original Boggy Creek! That film is, in its own small way, a very important piece of celluloid history that truly deserves a frame-by-frame, 1080p/hi-def, digital restoration Blu-ray release. Sadly, every copy I've ever watched is murky, grainy junk that reeks to high heaven of Public Domain-level &#34;mastering&#34; probably sourced from an old VHS tape or duped straight off a TV broadcast, with the commercials edited out. Luckily for us, the video & audio quality of both The Town That Dreaded Sundown & The Evictors are strong here. Audio is loud & clean and the picture is, for the most part, crisp and free of dirt & scratches. Please keep in mind however that this is NOT a re-mastered film along the lines of BenHur or Gone With The Wind. It is what it is. I'm more interested in having them for completist's sake, and I'd still like to find a good-looking copies of both &#34;Boggy Creek II&#34; (the one with a young, pre-&#34;Diff'rent Strokes&#34; Dawn Wells) and his &#34;Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek&#34; film as well, but so far I've come up empty-handed.  :-(The Evictors is an uneven film, like most of Pierce's stuff, but does manage to be entertaining most of the time. It's not your typical Hollywood film, but then again that's one of the reasons why I enjoy the Pierce's work; he isn't a Hollywood player and he does his own thing, convention be damned. My only real gripe with The Evictors is the unsatisfactory ending. It works, but it could have been better. It plays sort of like a cross between a ghost story and a murder mystery. It requires patience when watching, like all of Pierce's movies. They are slow and take their time, like an old-man speaking with a southern drawl. It's sad that Charles B. Pierce didn't have a more prolific career, but I'm glad that a lot of his work it is at least available in some form or other.  Buy this Blu-ray set if you can get it cheap. I think both features here are decent enough to warrant an occasional repeat viewing.",4,Good combo of southern gothic horror films from the director of The Legend of Boggy Creek,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,3672,"['cool', 'finally', 'have', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'arrive', 'video', 'such', 'nice', 'shape', 'Blu-ray', 'boot', 'getting', 'Evictors', 'included', 'bonus', 'was', 'icing', 'cake', 'film', 'own', 'disc', 'too', 'rather', 'crammed', 'together', 'one', 'nice', 'TTTDS', 'decent', 'shocks', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tension', 'make', 'quite', 'watchable', 'Too', 'bad', 'director', 'Pierce', 'did', ""n't"", 'fire', 'actor', 'Pierce', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'funny', 'shtick', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'take', 'IF', 'film', 'were', 'light-hearted', 'southern', 'comedy', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'something', 'not', 'true', 'life-based', 'story', 'string', 'unsolved', 'post-WWII', 'murders', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'Pierce', 'wanted', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'grim', 'was', 'trying', 'pad', 'out', 'running', 'time', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'work', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'screeching', 'halt', 'whenever', 'screen', 'doing', 'decidedly', 'UNfunny', ""'Sparkplug"", 'character', 'shenanigans', 'Stick', 'directing', 'Charley', 'Apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'doing', 'double', 'duty', 'later', 'films', 'also', 'center', 'stage', 'third', '34', 'Boggy', 'Creek', '34', 'film', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'entitled', '34', 'Barbaric', 'Beast', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'II', '34', 'actually', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'then', 'whole', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'mess', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Pierce', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'acting', 'self-absorbed', 'ham', 'possible', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'cheap', 'hire', 'real', 'actor', 'more', 'likely', '.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'two', 'films', 'very', 'nice', 'considering', 'history', 'unfortunately', 'same', 'most', 'Pierce', 'work', 'Try', 'finding', 'quality', 'copy', 'original', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'film', 'own', 'small', 'way', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'celluloid', 'history', 'frame-by-frame', '1080p/hi-def', 'digital', 'restoration', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'Sadly', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'murky', 'grainy', 'junk', 'high', 'heaven', 'Public', 'Domain-level', '34', 'mastering', '34', 'probably', 'sourced', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'duped', 'straight', 'off', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'commercials', 'edited', 'out', 'Luckily', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Evictors', 'are', 'strong', 'here', 'Audio', 'loud', 'clean', 'picture', 'most', 'part', 'crisp', 'free', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'however', 'NOT', 're-mastered', 'film', 'lines', 'BenHur', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'what', ""'m"", 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'completist', 'sake', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'find', 'good-looking', 'copies', '34', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'II', '34', 'one', 'young', 'pre-', '34', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', '34', 'Dawn', 'Wells', '34', 'Barbaric', 'Beast', 'Boggy', 'Creek', '34', 'film', 'well', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'empty-handed', 'Evictors', 'uneven', 'film', 'most', 'Pierce', 'stuff', 'manage', 'be', 'entertaining', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'enjoy', 'Pierce', 'work', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'player', 'own', 'thing', 'convention', 'be', 'damned', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'Evictors', 'unsatisfactory', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'sort', 'cross', 'ghost', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', 'patience', 'when', 'watching', 'Pierce', 'movies', 'are', 'slow', 'take', 'time', 'old-man', 'speaking', 'southern', 'drawl', 'sad', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'prolific', 'career', ""'m"", 'glad', 'lot', 'work', 'least', 'available', 'form', 'other', 'Buy', 'Blu-ray', 'set', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'think', 'features', 'here', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'warrant', 'occasional', 'repeat', 'viewing']",Town That Dreaded Sundown VHS

The film, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN, completely changed my opinion of how people in the 1940's were. My image of this time was eternally tarnished. I didn't realize until that moment of watching this movie, that people could be so ruthless in such an ""innocent"" time.It was post-WWII and our nation was at one of it's all-time highs. The war was over, the economy was well, times were changing. In Texarkana however, things would never be the same. The Phantom Killer as he was nicknamed, was never caught and was as true a story that could ever be about serial murder. The movie doesn't hold back at all. It shows in detail of how the victims that died were killed and how some survived, but were put through agonizing situations of survival.I also really liked this movie too because of the slight comic relief. It wasn't to the point of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT(1973) where it just gets outright silly. But it gives you a little bit of a relief from the bad parts. It has some of that ""good ol' boy"" from Texas humor. It's not as tight a script/screenplay as TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, but much better than LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Some familiar faces include Ben Johnson, Dawn Wells, and Andrew Prine. The movie is well acted and put together pretty well. It has great suspense and comes off very genuine. To not be released on DVD is a shame. The remake is coming out in 2011 I think which may be worth seeing. As soon as this is available on DVD, it should be considered for purchase.

Police chief Captain J.D. Morales (Ben Johnson) has been searching for months for this cretin as he will not rest until he captures him dead or alive.""The Evictors"" tells the story of a newlywed couple named Ben and Ruth Watkins (Michael Parks and Jessica Harper) in 1942  who moved into a new house in a town in Lousiana somewhere. However, they don't know is that the house they stayed in has a story of violence and yet there is a killer on the loose.For ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"", this is one of the most underrated and unique horror cult classics ever made as it's written and  directed by Charles B Pierce who came fresh off the success of ""Legend of Boggy Creek"". He decided to do another low budget horror movie based on an actual murder case that happened 67 years ago in Texarkana. The film co-stars Andrew Pine and Dawn Wells, this chilling and shocking film may have typical b-movie acting but Ben Johnson did a great performance as JD Morales and this movie is very memorable even with the Trombone death sequence which you won't ever forget, i saw this movie on video when i was 5 back in 86 and thought it was scary and i had this on video for years since i was a teen on a blank tape and over the years i yearned for a DVD release. Luckily Scream Factory has saved the day when they announced it with Evictors last November, i threw away the tape in the trash.""The Evictors"" is quite an enjoyable low budget shocker from Charles B.

FACTORY for these sensational new releases--finally the movie god seems to be smiling down upon the BluRay and DVD markets. The picture quality on this BluRay is fantastic--this title was made in 1976, and it seems to have a great quality of remastering. I enjoyed the audio commentary track (which is admittedly a bit dry), the trailers included, and the interviews with two of the film's stars were nice to watch. Plus, you get Brian Albright's excellent, if short, essay on the films of Charles B. Pierce--this is not a visual essay, you simply navigate through the prose with your remote control, but it is worth a read for genre/regional enthusiasts. The bonus DVD includes this title as well as THE EVICTORS, which, for my taste, is not quite a true horror film but is nonetheless fascinating in retrospect--this is technically how a horror film should be made (a sense of mystery, eerie music, little blood/gore but a lot of scares) and yet the end result is not technically &#34;horror&#34;.As for &#34;The Town that Dreaded Sundown,&#34; the widescreen transfer of this title appears to be the correct shooting aspect ratio, and the image is quite clear on a widescreen TV. Shout! must have done their homework on this one. Overall, it's another high quality presentation that I find little to complain about. As for the movie itself, I think that it will improve through repeated viewings, so don't be put off if you find that it isn't to your liking at first. I think the film is something of a neglected classic, despite the fact that (for me personally at least) it ended a bit abruptly and didn't seem to have a very long running time. Maybe it didn't need to be very long, however. In any case, it is a suspenseful movie, and worth adding to your collection if you like these old titles--the atmosphere is quite intense, and the characters are likable (well, most of the characters!).

Every Friday the 13th I rent every ""Friday the 13th"" movie and stay up all night watching them...always with the lights out.  Despite my wide-ranging horror film experience, I can honestly say that ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" scared me more than any other film to date.Shot in 1976, this film presents the true story of a Texarkana, Arkansas crime spree in 1946.  World War II had ended bringing the military boys back home and Texarkana was enjoying peace and prosperity.  From the murky depths of night, a killer mysteriously emerged to taunt and terrorize the inhabitants of the quiet town.  Young couples were attacked in their cars on lovers lane in intervals of 21 days...and even a famous Texas Ranger couldn't solve the case.The story is presented in documentary style, with a narrator weaving direction through the onslaught of terror.  There is no shock value to this movie.  It is presented with raw facts and the chilling realization that this crime could happen anywhere at any time.  The Phantom Killer of Texarkana, always wearing a hood to cover his face, left a crude and bloody path of destruction in his wake and throughout this film you can feel the terror gripping the tiny town.

Pierce, 1976)&lt;em>The Town that Dreaded Sundown&lt;/em> is not classic cinema by any means, but it succeeds in doing most of the things &lt;em>Raw Meat&lt;/em> (q.v., elsewhere this ish) tried and failed to do.Plot: loosely based on the Moonlight Murders case, &lt;em>The Town that Dreaded Sundown&lt;/em> details the three-month dance between a hooded serial killer (played by stuntman Bud Davis) and J. D. Morales (&lt;em>Angels in the Outfield&lt;/em>'s Ben Johnson), a Texas ranger obsessed with hunting him down. But this is not your normal crime film, not by any means. The local sheriff (Jim Citty in his only screen role) understands that he needs outside help on this case, but isn't all too happy about it, so he assigns overeager, bumbling deputy Norman Ramsey (&lt;em>Gettysburg&lt;/em>'s Andrew Prine) as Morales' escort, providing comic relief throughout.This movie works a whole lot better if you think of it as a comedy of murders, a subgenre that actually experienced a minor surge in popularity a few years after this came out (&lt;em>Student Bodies&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Pandemonium&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Saturday the 14th&lt;/em>, etc.). Those who go into it expecting a horror movie, or worse yet a slasher film, are bound to be disappointed. Those who expect the modern ""well, we don't know who the killer is, so we'll invent a plausible ending"" will also be disappointed. The case is still officially listed as unsolved over sixty years later, and the film (made to coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of the case) wasn't going to make any bones about that. (Note: law enforcement at the time believe they actually had the killer in custody, and most of the evidence pointed to him, a 29-year-old itinerant criminal named Youell Swinney; he was released on a technicality and never actually tried for the Moonlight Murders.) It's a cheaply-made Z-grade piece of silliness that should probably have been a TV movie, but ended up getting a pretty big theatrical release before fading into obscurity. Obscure it still is--to this day the film has never had a DVD release--but low-budget thriller/comedy fans will definitely want to look this one up. ***",3,"Underrated, funny, and definitely worth your time.",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2232,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Town', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'lt', '>', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', '1976', 'lt', '>', 'Town', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'lt', '>', 'not', 'classic', 'cinema', 'means', 'doing', 'most', 'things', 'lt', '>', 'Raw', 'Meat', 'lt', '>', 'q.v.', 'elsewhere', 'ish', 'tried', 'failed', 'do.Plot', 'loosely', 'based', 'Moonlight', 'Murders', 'case', 'lt', '>', 'Town', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'lt', '>', 'details', 'three-month', 'dance', 'hooded', 'serial', 'killer', 'played', 'stuntman', 'Bud', 'Davis', 'J.', 'D.', 'Morales', 'lt', '>', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Texas', 'ranger', 'obsessed', 'hunting', 'down', 'not', 'normal', 'crime', 'film', 'not', 'means', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Jim', 'Citty', 'only', 'screen', 'role', 'outside', 'help', 'case', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'happy', 'overeager', 'bumbling', 'deputy', 'Norman', 'Ramsey', 'lt', '>', 'Gettysburg', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'Morales', 'escort', 'providing', 'comic', 'relief', 'throughout.This', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'think', 'comedy', 'murders', 'subgenre', 'actually', 'experienced', 'minor', 'surge', 'popularity', 'few', 'years', 'came', 'out', 'lt', '>', 'Student', 'Bodies', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Pandemonium', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Saturday', '14th', 'lt', '>', 'etc.', 'who', 'go', 'expecting', 'horror', 'movie', 'worse', 'yet', 'slasher', 'film', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'who', 'expect', 'modern', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'killer', ""'ll"", 'invent', 'plausible', 'ending', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'case', 'still', 'officially', 'listed', 'unsolved', 'sixty', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'made', 'coincide', 'thirtieth', 'anniversary', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'bones', 'Note', 'law', 'enforcement', 'time', 'believe', 'actually', 'had', 'killer', 'custody', 'most', 'evidence', 'pointed', '29-year-old', 'itinerant', 'criminal', 'named', 'Youell', 'Swinney', 'was', 'released', 'technicality', 'never', 'actually', 'tried', 'Moonlight', 'Murders', 'cheaply-made', 'Z-grade', 'piece', 'silliness', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'pretty', 'big', 'theatrical', 'release', 'fading', 'obscurity', 'Obscure', 'still', 'day', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'DVD', 'release', 'low-budget', 'thriller/comedy', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'look', 'one', 'up', '***']",Town That Dreaded Sundown VHS

Quesenberry, Jr. ""70s & 80's horror fan""","[3, 3]","I suppose this film is more important in a historical sense than an artistic one: it's a proto-slasher film (from 1976, before the great age of the slasher flick), about a proto-slasher (a real whacko carving up Texarkana in 1946).Just to establish this as being a docu-drama, and therefore obviously non-exploitative, let's have a long narration fill in the settings for us, instead of any interesting technique: It's eight months after the war, and Texarkana is returning to normal and full of that heady optimism which will turn to conformist paranoia by the mid-'50's.  We get to see a long montage of jes' plain life with jes' plain folks.  (In case you were wondering, '40's and '70's makeup and hairstyles don't blend very well -- imagine an episode of The Waltons with a masked killer.)The first attack: SUNDAY, MARCH 3 (superimposed, so we won't forget the date).  We can't get mad at the cliches because it's all true: The couple parking on lover's lane, the frigid girl who hears something outside...  Then a psycho with a flourbag over his head shows up.Next morning.  Oddly enough, they're still alive; both have been badly beaten, and the girl was bitten savagely all over her back, belly and breasts.  We're introduced to a station full of cops, including Deputy Ramsey.Fast forward to the next superimposed date: SATURDAY, MARCH 24.  The narrator is still around to give this all an air of legitimacy; unfortunately, he insists on telling us things that are either irrelevant or ultimately redundant, since the characters promptly tell us the same thing.  Deputy Ramsey patrols the lover's lanes, hears shots in the woods, and comes upon the corpses of two young lovers -- and almost catches the Phantom as he get away in the lovers' car.The narration tells us all about the effects of ""the second attack by the killer"" (technically, this is only the first attack by the killer -- the first time, he didn't kill anyone, so he wasn't a killer yet):  Everyone buys a gun, everyone puts heavy-duty locks on their doors.  This despite the fact that both attacks have been young couples on secluded roads; this pattern seems to elude the good people of Texarkana.Between now and the next killing, two things happen.  One, we call in Captain J.D. Morales, legendary investigator of the Texas Rangers.  Two, we spend far too much time in comic relief with a patrolman named Sparkplug.  It's an unforgivable blooper in budgeting screen time: We get to see Sparkplug's terrible driving as he chauffers Morales, but the actual investigation is summarized by the narrator.Deputy Ramsey hits on the pattern: He strikes every three weeks!  So, by all means, let's make sure that SUNDAY, APRIL 14TH is scheduled for the junior/senior prom.  After all, just because their parents are locking their doors and loaded for bear doesn't mean that the kids are smart enough not to park.  Sure enough, a trombonist and her date go and park (and apparently take a nap -- is that what parking's all about) and get attacked by the Phantom.  There's a long chase scene, and finally he dispatches them (using her trombone as a bayonet, no less).By this time, everything is complicated by crazies confessing and claiming to be the Phantom.  (Insert a car chase with one of the pretenders here, where both cars manage to squeal their tires while driving over a lawn.) The police have called in a psychologist, who does nothing for morale (or Morales): He guesses that the killer will never be caught.For the next attack (FRIDAY, MAY 3RD, in case you were curious), the killer breaks pattern: He attacks a young beautiful wife (yes, that is Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island -- she thought she'd be safe once she got off that damned island...).  Her husband bites the dust, but she manages to drag her hideously wounded self through the corn patch to the nearest neighbor's house.Another three weeks go buy, and this time -- he doesn't strike!  Ramsey and Morales are climbing the walls with anticipation.  But there's nothing for several weeks.  In fact, it isn't until fall that someone finds the car stolen by the Phantom on the second attack.  Morales and Ramsey explore the nearby sandpit -- and there's the Phantom, enjoying his solitude!  (He even wears his flour sack when he's not on the hunt; I guess it's just comfortable.)  They chase him and shoot him in the leg, but he manages to get away into the swamp.  The bloodhounds lose his scent.  And he's never heard from again.Is he dead?  Is he in jail on another charge?  Or is he -- gasp -- still living in Texarkana, waiting for that day when something tickles his brain and he starts killing again?Like I said, the fact that this is a true story is used by the filmmakers to cover a bunch of flaws that would be unforgivable in a normal movie.  The narration is by and large inept, telling us things that we'd love to see on screen while boring visuals are being shown to us.  The inexplicable focus on Sparkplug only serves to distance us further from Ramsey and Morales, the closest thing we have to protagonists.  Some of the attacks are done well (the last two, especially), but tension is immediately drained when the narrator comes back in to summarize the next few weeks of police activity.It's good material, though, and I think it's about due for a remake.",3,Twenty-somethings get engorged and tingling then a psycho with a flourbag over his head ruins the would-be climax,1199404800,"01 4,

You probably know by now that it is based on an actual occurences in an Arkansas town which makes it all the more interesting a story.From the first few opening shots, it is apparent by the great use of the 2:35 widescreen frame that whoever made this film had experience and know how.  Too bad the picture changes to full frame after the opening credits on the available releases.I will agree that the comic releif elements (Dukes of Hazzard Roscoe P Coltrane style humor)scattered lightly throughout the film are a bit out of place but this did not hamper the experience for me. I never found the acting to be bad and Ben Johnson is a very well accomplished actor who has been in probably hundreds of movies with some of the biggest names in the industry.A cool looking masked killer and documentary style make for worthwhile viewing.
