1327243,A1SAGYN46CJ1N9,B00366BBTO,"A. Hudson ""A. Hudson""","[2, 2]","Enjoyed this dvd even though it was only a TV movie and lacked the &#34;meat&#34; of a good A quality movie.  The story held your interest even though it was somewhat predictable and previous knowledge of the true story facts are readily available.  The actors did a good job, esp Robin Tunney.  It was good to see her in a role that showcased her talent.  It is always astounding to see how wealth doesn't provide happiness and how people who seem to &#34;have it all&#34; can be so self-destructive.  I would have liked to have seen more of the Anson Mount character - he had little to do and did not appear often.  I suppose the greatest intrigue of this movie is  the fact that this is a true story and depicts how wealth is not the answer to all.",4,The Two Mr. Kissels,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,751,"['Enjoyed', 'dvd', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'TV', 'movie', 'lacked', '34', 'meat', '34', 'good', 'A', 'quality', 'movie', 'story', 'held', 'interest', 'even', 'was', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'true', 'story', 'facts', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'esp', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'role', 'showcased', 'talent', 'always', 'astounding', 'see', 'how', 'wealth', ""n't"", 'provide', 'happiness', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'seem', '34', 'have', '34', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'self-destructive', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'character', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'often', 'suppose', 'greatest', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'wealth', 'not', 'answer']",N/A

This film is one that can be enjoyed time and time again. Well-casted, the actors do an excellent job of portraying the people who lived through this nightmare.  Based on a true story, most of which was depicted on the ID channel-(Investigation and Discovery)- the two Kissel brothers, pushed hard by their father to be pinnacles of Wall Street success, persue the goal and pay an enormous price for it.  Clearly, Robin Tunney is at her best, and steals the show, as the dark, calculating and arrogant wife of Rob Kissel.  No one who adds this movie to their collection will regret doing so.

1327247,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00366BBTO,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[18, 18]","This was a Lifetime TV movie produced in 2008, which is now available on DVD.Such movies, which bypass the theatre, generally have no rating.  If it had a film rating it would probably be PG-13.This has everything: sex, drugs, wealth, deception, murder--and best of all, it is a true story.  More accurately it's a dramatization of a true story-somewhat like ""Reversal of Fortune"", or other films which attempt to re-enact actual murder stories in film.  There's nothing to make a story more interesting than knowing the basics are all real.This is certainly better than the usual made-for-TV movie and better than a lot of films that appear in the cinema.  The acting is good, the filming good, the dialog good, the pace and editing are good.  It kept me interested the entire time.  There are sexually suggestive scenes but no significant nudity, no graphic violence and no foul language of any significance.  There is no subtitling available and no ""special features.""  It runs just under 1.5 hours long.It's the story of two brothers, raised in a rich family-both of whom end up murdered.  In the case of one brother, the wife is convicted of murder.  In the case of the other brother, the actual murderer was unknown at the time of the production: one person had been charged with conspiracy to murder but had not yet gone to trial.  The film presents its own plausible theory as to this other brother's death (I don't want to give away the plot details).  At the end of the film clarification and updates on the significant characters are given-right up to 2008.  A fascinating but sad glimpse into the lives of two quite wealthy brothers and their families.  If you haven't seen this on TV and you don't want to wait around until it happens to show again--get this DVD.  You'll find this an interesting and well-produced story, with very good characterizations.",4,It Has Everything,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,1868,"['was', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'produced', '2008', 'now', 'available', 'DVD.Such', 'movies', 'bypass', 'theatre', 'generally', 'have', 'rating', 'had', 'film', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'PG-13.This', 'everything', 'sex', 'drugs', 'wealth', 'deception', 'murder', 'best', 'true', 'story', 'More', 'accurately', 'dramatization', 'true', 'story-somewhat', 'Reversal', 'Fortune', 'other', 'films', 'attempt', 're-enact', 'actual', 'murder', 'stories', 'film', 'nothing', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'knowing', 'basics', 'are', 'real.This', 'certainly', 'better', 'usual', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'better', 'lot', 'films', 'appear', 'cinema', 'acting', 'good', 'filming', 'good', 'dialog', 'good', 'pace', 'editing', 'are', 'good', 'kept', 'interested', 'entire', 'time', 'are', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'significant', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'significance', 'subtitling', 'available', 'special', 'features', 'just', '1.5', 'hours', 'long.It', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'raised', 'rich', 'family-both', 'whom', 'end', 'up', 'murdered', 'case', 'one', 'brother', 'wife', 'convicted', 'murder', 'case', 'other', 'brother', 'actual', 'murderer', 'was', 'unknown', 'time', 'production', 'one', 'person', 'had', 'been', 'charged', 'conspiracy', 'murder', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'gone', 'trial', 'film', 'own', 'plausible', 'theory', 'other', 'brother', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'details', 'end', 'film', 'clarification', 'updates', 'significant', 'characters', 'are', 'given-right', '2008', 'fascinating', 'sad', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'two', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'brothers', 'families', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'show', 'again', 'get', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting', 'well-produced', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'characterizations']",N/A

She begins a torrid affair in retaliation, eventually igniting worldwide media fenzy when she drugs then bludgeons Rob to death.Years later, Andrew is caught embezzling millions of dollars to support his increasingly lavish lifestyle and drug addiction. With the courts breathing down his neck, former business partners turning on him, and his frustrated and embarrassed wife Hayley (Gretchen Egolf) filing for divorce, Andrew is found dead in the basement of his Greenwich, Connecticut mansion.The question remains: was Andrew murdered by one of his many enemies, or did he arrange it himself in order to escape his living nightmare?",4,Double Jeopardy,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1176,"['Based', 'shocking', 'true', 'story', 'multi-millionaire', 'brothers', 'who', 'marry', 'women', 'dreams', 'then', 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'THE', 'TWO', 'MR.', 'KISSELS', 'trail', 'money', 'mansions', 'mayhem', 'left', 'behind', 'real', 'estate', 'mogul', 'Andrew', 'Kissel', 'John', 'Stamos', 'investment', 'banker', 'brother', 'Rob', 'Anson', 'Mount', '.On', 'surface', 'Kissel', 'brothers', 'are', 'enjoying', 'idyllic', 'lives', 'Rob', 'family', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'promotion', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'resentful', 'long', 'work', 'hours', 'torrid', 'affair', 'retaliation', 'eventually', 'igniting', 'worldwide', 'media', 'fenzy', 'when', 'drugs', 'then', 'bludgeons', 'Rob', 'death.Years', 'later', 'Andrew', 'caught', 'embezzling', 'millions', 'dollars', 'support', 'increasingly', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'drug', 'addiction', 'courts', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'former', 'business', 'partners', 'turning', 'frustrated', 'embarrassed', 'wife', 'Hayley', 'Gretchen', 'Egolf', 'filing', 'divorce', 'Andrew', 'found', 'dead', 'basement', 'Greenwich', 'Connecticut', 'question', 'was', 'Andrew', 'murdered', 'one', 'many', 'enemies', 'did', 'arrange', 'order', 'escape', 'living', 'nightmare']",N/A
