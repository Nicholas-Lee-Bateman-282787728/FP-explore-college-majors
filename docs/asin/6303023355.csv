After reading the actual novel, that this movie was supposed to be about, I bought this movie very recently thinking it would be as good as the novel.I found the movie, Bat-21, full of vile profanity, at the most mundane, non-emotional scenes, an insult to the real airmen involved in this saga and all military members past and present. Once again, Hollywood, having a sorry adaptation of the real book, even worse script writers, falls back on cursing as scene fillers.The acting....wasn't.  The so-called story line is truly fantasy from Hollywood at its worst. It is obvious that the entire group involved in the making of this fiasco have no concept of the military, the Vietnam War, flying, military communications discipline, and for certain never read the book about this real-life heroic drama.Gene Hackman tramps over hill and dale in broad daylight, on a treeless hill-top fully visible to the enemy, crashes through the boonies like a male rhino in heat, leaving a broken vegetation trail that a Tenderfoot Boy Scout could follow, and in general, appears clueless about escape and evasion.The extremely long-winded radio transmissions between Hackman and Glover (in an OV-2 flying overhead), was more suitable for a conversation on a back porch swing than would ever transpire in a search/rescue/escape and evasion situation.  Pure bull crap!!Read the book!  Don't buy, don't rent, don't even consider watching this most sorry excuse for a war movie.  I just wasted nearly $14 (with S/H) buying the DVD.

Not that I'm an anti-war hippie, but I think it accurately portrays the feelings of a man whose immersed in a situation such as that, never having experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.

Hambleton was flying as a navigator on an EB-66 electronic countermeasures plane, call sign Bat-21.  When a surface-to-air missile hits the plane, Col. Hambleton is the only man able to eject from the aircraft, landing in the northern portion of South Viet Nam.  For the next eleven and a half days Col. Hambleton evaded capture by the North Vietnamese Army until he was rescued in one of the largest and most complex rescue missions of the Viet Nam War.  These true events, for which 234 medals were awarded, inspired this movie.In the movie Col. Hambleton is nearing possible rescue by a Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopter when Viet Cong destroy the helicopter.  The Viet Cong, who are using the people of a nearby village to protect themselves from American attack since the Viet Cong know that Americans typically attempt to protect non-combatants, kill all the crew.  However, this time the rage of Col. George Walker (Jerry Reed, in one of his best roles) causes the village to be destroyed by napalm bombs.Col. Hambleton is on the run for his life, both from the North Vietnamese Army and from an impending air strike by B-52 bombers.  Using the call sign Bat-21 and his URC-64 survival radio, Hambleton follows directions from forward air controller Captain Bartholomew Clark along a path based on golf courses that Col. Hambleton has played.What I find amazing about this movie is that while there are events that illustrate the tragedy and inhumanity of the combat in Viet Nam, much of the movie focuses on the people in the movie.  There is a touching moment where Col. Hambleton passes a boy on a bridge, and the two exchange gifts, forgetting for a moment the ideologically generated conflict going on around them.  It is also apparent to me that Col. Hambleton had nothing against the Vietnamese people; he was just a soldier with a job to do.Movies typically do a poor job portraying any war or combat, with few exceptions.  Similarly, this movie misses much with respect to the true story.  This movie also invents things that never happened, or misrepresents other events, likely all for the sake of pace and action.  However, this movie does catch the spirit of one man surviving incredible odds in war to not only do his job, which was to fight an enemy, but to get himself rescued in the process.

351307,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6303023355,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","High octane action and the perseverance of some of the leads elevate ""Bat-21"" to that higher level of Vietnam movie.  Basically the story of how a high-level intelligence officer eludes capture after being shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam, ""Bat-21"" is relentless and never exploitative.  Hackman is Iceal Hambleton, a USAF colonel who fights the war in Vietnam from the offices and golf courses of Saigon.  Tasked to identify communist missile sites, he boldly (and unwisely) tags along on an EB-66, an unarmed electronic warfare bird loaded with intelligence equipment.  The sole survivor after being shot down, Hambleton finds himself pursued by the enemy who apparently appreciate his value as a prisoner.  While the enemy (was it the NVA or the Cong? I could never tell) is unable to find Hambleton, they prove more than capable of making life hell for the rescue choppers sent to rescue him - including the crew of a ""Jolly Green"" cut to pieces over an enemy-held village.  While on the ground, Hambleton stays in contact with Bart Clark (Danny Glover), a USAF captain who flies spotter missions for more heavily armed bombers.  (Clark flies FAC - from his slow-moving Cessna, he finds targets for the strike fighters, marking them with white-phosphorous rockets).  Knowing that the enemy is monitoring them, Hambleton and Clark work out a code that posits the map of Vietnam as a big golf course.  As rescue attempts become more dangerous, Clark finds himself drawn ever deeper into the rescue, climaxing in his going rogue when his superiors throw in the towel.""Bat-21"" isn't really a classic.  There's plenty of thrilling action, and the script even manages to find room for irony (as when Clark pauses during a radio conversation with Hambleton while he zaps a few communist troops).  Still, nothing really convincingly explains how Hackman manages to elude capture...by anybody (the script makes clear that he is definitely no Rambo).  The film also breezes over the biggest irony - that Hackman's code is based on his smarts on the golf course rather than the battlefield.  If the film excels over cheap action flicks, it's in the determination and exhaustion of its leads and persistent refusal to avoid Hollywood glory.  Also, unless anybody knows of another film, this is the only one I've seen that captures the critical role played by Forward Air Controllers in both prosecuting the air war in Vietnam, and rescuing those airmen nearly lost.",4,"Not an excellent VN war flick, but still one you should see",1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2464,"['High', 'octane', 'action', 'perseverance', 'leads', 'elevate', 'Bat-21', 'higher', 'level', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'Basically', 'story', 'how', 'high-level', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'capture', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Vietnam', 'Bat-21', 'relentless', 'never', 'exploitative', 'Hackman', 'Iceal', 'Hambleton', 'USAF', 'colonel', 'who', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'offices', 'golf', 'courses', 'Saigon', 'Tasked', 'identify', 'communist', 'missile', 'sites', 'boldly', 'unwisely', 'tags', 'EB-66', 'unarmed', 'electronic', 'warfare', 'bird', 'loaded', 'intelligence', 'equipment', 'sole', 'survivor', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'Hambleton', 'pursued', 'enemy', 'who', 'apparently', 'appreciate', 'value', 'prisoner', 'enemy', 'was', 'NVA', 'Cong', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'unable', 'find', 'Hambleton', 'prove', 'more', 'capable', 'making', 'life', 'hell', 'rescue', 'choppers', 'sent', 'rescue', 'including', 'crew', 'Jolly', 'Green', 'cut', 'pieces', 'enemy-held', 'village', 'ground', 'Hambleton', 'contact', 'Bart', 'Clark', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'USAF', 'captain', 'who', 'spotter', 'missions', 'more', 'heavily', 'armed', 'bombers', 'Clark', 'FAC', 'slow-moving', 'Cessna', 'targets', 'strike', 'fighters', 'marking', 'white-phosphorous', 'rockets', 'Knowing', 'enemy', 'monitoring', 'Hambleton', 'Clark', 'work', 'out', 'code', 'map', 'Vietnam', 'big', 'golf', 'course', 'rescue', 'become', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Clark', 'drawn', 'ever', 'deeper', 'rescue', 'climaxing', 'going', 'rogue', 'when', 'superiors', 'throw', 'towel', 'Bat-21', ""n't"", 'really', 'classic', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'action', 'script', 'even', 'find', 'room', 'irony', 'when', 'Clark', 'radio', 'conversation', 'Hambleton', 'few', 'communist', 'troops', 'Still', 'nothing', 'really', 'convincingly', 'how', 'Hackman', 'elude', 'capture', 'anybody', 'script', 'clear', 'definitely', 'Rambo', 'film', 'also', 'biggest', 'irony', 'Hackman', 'code', 'based', 'smarts', 'golf', 'course', 'rather', 'battlefield', 'film', 'excels', 'cheap', 'action', 'flicks', 'determination', 'exhaustion', 'leads', 'persistent', 'refusal', 'avoid', 'Hollywood', 'glory', 'Also', 'anybody', 'knows', 'film', 'only', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'critical', 'role', 'played', 'Forward', 'Air', 'Controllers', 'prosecuting', 'air', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'rescuing', 'airmen', 'nearly', 'lost']",Bat 21 VHS

The Americans launch a rescue effort to save him from their clutches.  Though in reality, the officer was rescued by a Navy Seal and a South Vietnamese soldier, Hollywood does not like them so he is rescued by fictional Black pilot played by Danny Glover.A slightly better than average Vietnam War film that can certainly be criticized for several of its creative choices and script.  The idea that Hackman has spent over thirty years in the military and had no idea that people get killed in war is a bit far fetched and the Brotherhood of man relationship that develops between he and Glover is tired.  The two leads never did much for me over much but they are not horrible either.That said, the film is well photographed, makes excellent use of the military equipement of the period especially the aircraft and is morally miles above such filth as FULL METAL JACKET or COMING HOME. The film actually uses the word Communist which is excedingly rare in films about that war.Not the best. Not the worst.  I had a pleasant time.

He had been involved in several missile development programs and other vital aspects of technology. Needless to say, he had a Top Secret security clearance.Serving on an electonic-warfare plane as navigator, he was the only survivor when he parachuted over Quang Tri province, deep in North Veitnamese territory. In fact, he landed in the midst of a massive NVA ofgfensive, and the attempts to rescue Hambelton were truly epic. Five U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and nine severely damaged. Eleven airmen were killed in action, and two were captured.Bat21 is a highly FICTIONALIZED account of the historical event. Gene hackman plays Lt.Col. hambelton in this portrayal of the incident. Danny Glover plays Captain Clark, ...an entirely FICTIONAL character, who ultimately rescues the stranded colonel. In REALITY, ...Lt.Col. Hambelton was rescued by a Navy SEAL, Lt.J.G. Norris and ARVN Commando Nguyen Van Kiet.Despite the enormous Hollywood deviations from reality and the HISTORICAL FACTS, this is not a bad movie. The character of Captain Clark, although fictional, is truly notable as relentless forward air control pilot in a Cessna Skymaster, ...who never gives up in his attempts to guide the downed airman out of harms's way. Like a REAL AMERICAN, Clark never gives up in this attempt. Unfortunately, it is someone like Danny Glover in this role, but he did a good job. I was greatly disappointed to find that this part of the story never happened!For what its worth, I think this film does a good job of portraying the truest character of American servicemen who bravely risked their lives in Veitnam. It also accurately portrays the REAL brutality of the communist NVA troops.Some other flagrant deviations from reality:-Hambelton and Clark engaging in long conversations, ...on the RADIO, INA COMBAT ZONE!!! (as if they were on the telephone)! There are scenes of an NVA communications team listening in on the transmissions. SURELY an electronic-warfare officer would be AWARE of that, ...and the inevitable triangulation from RDF!...and a factual observation:It is noted in the film, that the NVA already has a large file on Lt.Col. Hamblen. Its true. How did this come to be?...While REAL Americans were fighting and serving in Veitnam, ....their were leftists on various American university campuses, who were ASSEMBLING RESEARCH ON DEPLOYED AMERICAN SERVICE-MEMBERS.

Okay, the plot is almost the same as that action filck made with the technology of the year 2001, but, let me tell you, ""BAT*21"" gives its stress on a different matter than ""Behind,"" and that is the characters played by the two leads.As the film claims in the opening, the story about Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton whose airplane is shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam is based on truth.  Now becoming ""BAT*21,"" his code name, he has to rely on a radio by which he maintains a contact with a pilot Captain Bartholomew Clerk (Danny Glover), who instructs and encourages him to overcome all the barriers waiting for him on the ground.  But Lieutenant Colonel has no previous combat experience in his career, and the time for massive air raid that is certain to kill him is coming closer.Frankly, some of the scenes are too incredible (especially when Captain tries to fly the helicopter, which he has not done for a long time).  And you cannot expect the high-octaine action sequences, because the film's real focus is set in other places; that is, the bond between the two leading characters, which develops gradually through the unreliable radio contact.  Precisely this human part is the greatest asset of ""BAT*21"" of which quality is raised by the extremely superb acting by Gene  Hackman.
