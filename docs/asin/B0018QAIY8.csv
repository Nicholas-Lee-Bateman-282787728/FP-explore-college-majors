1160781,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0018QAIY8,calvinnme,"[58, 65]","This is a pretty good collection of miscellaneous westerns by Warner Home Video. There is no word on extra features yet, but here are the details on the films themselves and my viewpoint on each one.Escape From Ft. Bravo (1953) Directed by John Sturges. (4/5)At the end of the Civil War, Ft. Bravo is being used to house Confederate POWs. William Holden stars as Captain Roper, a man responsible for retrieving escapees from the Fort. He is often brutal in the execution of his duties, but he feels he must be or risk even more escapes. Eleanor Parker comes as a visitor to the fort and butters up Roper. All the while she is helping enable the escape of her true love, a Confederate prisoner. Roper falls in love with Parker's character. When he finds out the truth - after the prisoners escape - he could just leave them to the Apaches. Instead he goes out to rescue and retrieve the prisoners and the girl who betrayed his trust.Many Rivers To Cross (1955) Directed by Row Rowland. (4/5)This is a rather unusual cross between a comedy and a western. I really didn't like it the first time I saw it, but it does grow on you. Eleanor Parker stars as a woman who is afraid she will be a spinster and sets her sights on Robert Taylor's character, Bushrod Gentry. Bushrod is an unlikely husband and an untameable frontiersman, or so it seems.Cimarron (1960) Directed by Anthony Mann (3/5)Maybe I was spoiled by the 1931 version - in particular the very hammy portrayal of Yancey by Richard Dix. That film won an unbelievable Best Picture Oscar and a Best Actor nomination for Dix. This movie is far superior to the original, with Glenn Ford as Yancey. It confronts head-on the issues that the original just skirts around, yet in doing this it just seems to take on too much. The film is about an ill-matched couple that settles in Oklahoma during the land rush years and how things progress between the two of them as the years progress. Yancey is a wanderer at heart. His wife, Sabra, wants Yancey to settle down and raise a family. You'll probably like this one more if you haven't seen the original.The Law and Jake Wade (1958) Directed by John Sturges (4/5)This one has great performances in a rather unremarkable story. Robert Taylor plays Jake Wade. Richard Widmark plays Clint Hollister. It turns out that in years past Clint saved Jake's life when they were in the same gang. Jake goes straight and becomes a sheriff. Jake hears that Clint is about to hang - for something that he actually did - yet feels a debt and breaks him out of jail. Clint does the natural thing - he kidnaps Jake and his fiancee and forces him to return some money Jake stole when he was with the gang.  You can pretty much see where this one is going at every turn, but it is worth it to see Taylor and Widmark in the lead. They really are excellent.Saddle The Wind (1958) Directed by Robert Parrish (3/5)The only western written by Rod Serling, this one was rather disappointing considering its author. Robert Taylor once again plays a bad guy gone straight, this time as a farmer. He has a younger brother (John Cassavetes) who is following in his wild footsteps but surprises everyone when he brings home a wife. This doesn't prevent him from getting into deep trouble from which his brother must rescue him.The Stalking Moon (1968) Directed by Robert Mulligan (4/5)Considering it was made at a time when westerns were largely out of fashion, this one is very good. It does a great job of building suspense. An army scout (Gregory Peck) takes in a woman and her half-Apache son who are pretty much ostracized by society because of their origins. Unfortunately, the boy's Apache father is a violent fellow who wants his ""property"" back.",4,A pretty good collection of western films from the 50's and 60's,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3720,"['pretty', 'good', 'collection', 'miscellaneous', 'westerns', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'word', 'extra', 'features', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'details', 'films', 'viewpoint', 'one.Escape', 'Ft.', 'Bravo', '1953', 'Directed', 'John', 'Sturges', '4/5', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'Ft.', 'Bravo', 'being', 'used', 'house', 'Confederate', 'POWs', 'William', 'Holden', 'stars', 'Captain', 'Roper', 'man', 'responsible', 'retrieving', 'escapees', 'Fort', 'often', 'brutal', 'execution', 'duties', 'must', 'be', 'risk', 'even', 'more', 'escapes', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'visitor', 'fort', 'butters', 'up', 'Roper', 'while', 'helping', 'enable', 'escape', 'true', 'love', 'Confederate', 'prisoner', 'Roper', 'love', 'Parker', 'character', 'When', 'out', 'truth', 'prisoners', 'escape', 'could', 'just', 'leave', 'Apaches', 'Instead', 'out', 'rescue', 'retrieve', 'prisoners', 'girl', 'who', 'betrayed', 'trust.Many', 'Rivers', 'Cross', '1955', 'Directed', 'Row', 'Rowland', '4/5', 'rather', 'unusual', 'cross', 'comedy', 'western', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'grow', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'stars', 'woman', 'who', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'spinster', 'sights', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'character', 'Bushrod', 'Gentry', 'Bushrod', 'unlikely', 'husband', 'untameable', 'frontiersman', 'so', '1960', 'Directed', 'Anthony', 'Mann', '3/5', 'Maybe', 'was', 'spoiled', '1931', 'version', 'particular', 'very', 'hammy', 'portrayal', 'Yancey', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'film', 'won', 'unbelievable', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'Dix', 'movie', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Yancey', 'head-on', 'issues', 'original', 'just', 'skirts', 'yet', 'doing', 'just', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'ill-matched', 'couple', 'Oklahoma', 'land', 'rush', 'years', 'how', 'things', 'progress', 'two', 'years', 'progress', 'Yancey', 'wanderer', 'heart', 'wife', 'Sabra', 'Yancey', 'settle', 'down', 'raise', 'family', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original.The', 'Law', 'Jake', 'Wade', '1958', 'Directed', 'John', 'Sturges', '4/5', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'rather', 'unremarkable', 'story', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Wade', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Clint', 'Hollister', 'out', 'years', 'past', 'Clint', 'saved', 'Jake', 'life', 'when', 'were', 'same', 'gang', 'Jake', 'straight', 'sheriff', 'Jake', 'Clint', 'hang', 'something', 'actually', 'did', 'yet', 'debt', 'breaks', 'jail', 'Clint', 'natural', 'thing', 'Jake', 'fiancee', 'forces', 'return', 'money', 'Jake', 'stole', 'when', 'was', 'gang', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'where', 'one', 'going', 'turn', 'worth', 'see', 'Taylor', 'Widmark', 'lead', 'really', 'are', 'excellent.Saddle', 'Wind', '1958', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Parrish', '3/5', 'only', 'western', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'one', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'author', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'once', 'again', 'bad', 'guy', 'gone', 'straight', 'time', 'farmer', 'younger', 'brother', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'who', 'following', 'wild', 'footsteps', 'surprises', 'everyone', 'when', 'home', 'wife', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'getting', 'deep', 'trouble', 'brother', 'must', 'rescue', 'him.The', 'Stalking', 'Moon', '1968', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', '4/5', 'Considering', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'westerns', 'were', 'largely', 'fashion', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'army', 'scout', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'woman', 'half-Apache', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'ostracized', 'society', 'origins', 'Unfortunately', 'boy', 'Apache', 'father', 'violent', 'fellow', 'who', 'property', 'back']",Warner Home Video: Western Classics Collection

The Robert Taylor films are dreadful, and the stand out is Escape from Fort Bravo, and Cimarron. Fort Bravo has William Holden and E. Parker, and they are stand outs always. In this western she has some of the most  expensive looking 19th century long gowns ever seen in the West. Also Eleannor Parker's hair...never has there been such style, in scene after scene, changes in shape color and ribbons. And catch the ending of this film..what is William Holden doing?Cimarron has Maria Schell and she is excellent. Glenn Ford is never really good in any film, with the exception of some earlier films and 3:10 to Yuma. Otherwise, it's Anne Baxter and the rest of the cast that make this worthwhile, and, Anthony Mann's direction..note how he has changed since Naked Spur days. Mann is warming up for the big spectacles, such as EL Cid.Then Stalking Moon could have had a lot going for it, but it's essentially anti Native American, and falls back on John Ford's absurd ideas of people of color.(Ford is a great director, but not in his treatment of Native Americans.)Many Rivers to Cross..here is a dud of the first rank.

In the end, these reviews are all about personal taste, so here's mine:  The Law and Jake Wade is the best of the bunch - Robert Taylor, Richard Widmark, love it.  Next for me is Cimarron merely because I'm a big Glenn Ford fan.  Perhaps the best movie in the bunch is Saddle the Wind - Taylor again, but I've got it 3rd because I've never been a big John Cassavettes fan. Fourth, Many Rivers to Cross, Taylor, Eleanor Parker in something that's as much a comedy as a western.  Stalking Moon with Gregory Peck was a decent movie, but after watching it once, I figured probably never again so it ended up in a garage sale.  Escape from Fort Bravo with William Holden - to be honest, I also sold it and can't remember much about it, so it's #6.  About the only extras are subtitles and theatrical trailers.

Yet today at WalMart I found the entire collection of 6 DVDs for $15.00.I watch western movies and also read many fiction and non-fiction books on the west so several of these films meet my interest.  Nothing better than seeing a book you have read brought to the silver screen.  Among the better ones here are THE STALKING MOON (From noted western writer T.V. Olsen's book of same name), ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO, and THE LAW AND JAKE WADE (Fawcett Gold Medal Book 756, Marvin H. Albert).  While the other 3 DVDs are interesting the above 3 are the ones of main interest to me, and was surprised how good a movie such as SADDLE THE WIND turned out to be. I am less interested in CIMARRON (remake from 1931) and MANY RIVERS TO CROSS.Warner Brothers seems notorious for not opening their vaults to issue many DVDs, even the acclaimed CHEYENNE series of the 1950s and 60s has seen only 1 box issued.  If more are desired one must turn to the Encore Western channel for both Cheyenne and Maverick series.  Quite frankly as a reader having both hardcover and softcover westerns by noted author T.V. Olsen on the shelf, wondered if THE STALKING MOON would ever appear on DVD.The collection of western movies in this box covers the years 1953 through 1968, a fifteen year period seeing the western go from top box office draw to almost its disappearance.  As more than one reviewer has mentioned the movies do not fit together much at all, but then maybe they were never meant to do so.  Any collection having work by both Theodore V. Olsen and Marvin H. Albert can never be viewed by anyone having any knowledge of western fiction as being irrelevant or out of place.  Those two authors wrote many worthy books with a western setting.Would I spend $42.49 on this set: No.  Would I spend $15.00: Yes; as mentioned, I did so earlier today at WalMart and a great deal that was too.  No more going to the local library to check out these 3 movies. If any reader has the Encore Western channel they will also know that all of these westerns started showing there last fall, 2008.  Best in western reading and watching, pards.(As another reviewer mentioned: the FOX 3 movie box of Rawhide, Garden of Evil, and The Gunfighter available from AMAZON is not only available at a bargain price, but is a terrific, dynamic trio of western movies from the 40s and 50s.)Semper Fi.",5,NOT BAD MOVIES......NOT BAD PRICE,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2498,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'eye', 'collection', 'came', 'out', 'real', 'interest', 'only', '3', 'movies', 'due', 'high', 'cost', 'held', 'off', 'buying', 'today', 'WalMart', 'found', 'entire', 'collection', '6', 'DVDs', '15.00.I', 'watch', 'western', 'movies', 'also', 'read', 'many', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', 'books', 'west', 'so', 'several', 'films', 'meet', 'interest', 'Nothing', 'better', 'seeing', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'brought', 'silver', 'screen', 'better', 'ones', 'here', 'are', 'THE', 'STALKING', 'MOON', 'From', 'noted', 'western', 'writer', 'T.V', 'Olsen', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'ESCAPE', 'FROM', 'FORT', 'BRAVO', 'THE', 'LAW', 'AND', 'JAKE', 'WADE', 'Fawcett', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'Book', '756', 'Marvin', 'H.', 'Albert', 'other', '3', 'DVDs', 'are', 'interesting', '3', 'are', 'ones', 'main', 'interest', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'such', 'SADDLE', 'THE', 'WIND', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'am', 'less', 'interested', 'CIMARRON', 'remake', '1931', 'MANY', 'RIVERS', 'TO', 'CROSS.Warner', 'Brothers', 'notorious', 'not', 'opening', 'vaults', 'issue', 'many', 'DVDs', 'even', 'acclaimed', 'CHEYENNE', 'series', '1950s', '60s', 'seen', 'only', '1', 'box', 'issued', 'more', 'are', 'desired', 'one', 'must', 'turn', 'Encore', 'Western', 'channel', 'Cheyenne', 'Maverick', 'series', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'reader', 'having', 'hardcover', 'softcover', 'westerns', 'noted', 'author', 'T.V', 'Olsen', 'shelf', 'wondered', 'THE', 'STALKING', 'MOON', 'would', 'ever', 'appear', 'DVD.The', 'collection', 'western', 'movies', 'box', 'years', '1953', '1968', 'fifteen', 'year', 'period', 'seeing', 'western', 'go', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'almost', 'disappearance', 'more', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'together', 'much', 'then', 'maybe', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'do', 'so', 'collection', 'having', 'work', 'Theodore', 'V.', 'Olsen', 'Marvin', 'H.', 'Albert', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'having', 'knowledge', 'western', 'fiction', 'being', 'irrelevant', 'place', 'two', 'authors', 'wrote', 'many', 'worthy', 'books', 'western', 'setting.Would', 'spend', '42.49', 'set', 'Would', 'spend', '15.00', 'Yes', 'mentioned', 'did', 'so', 'earlier', 'today', 'WalMart', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'too', 'No', 'more', 'going', 'local', 'library', 'check', '3', 'movies', 'reader', 'Encore', 'Western', 'channel', 'will', 'also', 'know', 'westerns', 'started', 'showing', 'there', 'last', 'fall', '2008', 'Best', 'western', 'reading', 'watching', 'pards', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'FOX', '3', 'movie', 'box', 'Rawhide', 'Garden', 'Evil', 'Gunfighter', 'available', 'AMAZON', 'not', 'only', 'available', 'bargain', 'price', 'terrific', 'dynamic', 'trio', 'western', 'movies', '40s', '50s', 'Semper', 'Fi']",Warner Home Video: Western Classics Collection
