1424144,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B004QI14UC,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","2010&#8217;s BLACK RAT is a classic high school revenge tale, with the only mystery being revenge by whom.49 days earlier, Asuka, a high school girl, committed suicide by jumping off her school&#8217;s roof.  She was depressed because her group of friends had promised to help her with an upcoming dance for a traditional festival, then backed out, followed by one of the girls in their gang stealing Asuka&#8217;s boyfriend.After her death, her friends tried to move on, until one day all six of them got a text from Asuka&#8217;s phone, telling them to meet her at the school at midnight.When they arrive, they&#8217;re greeted by a girl wearing a rat mask identical to the one Asuka had designed for the festival.  The rat wheels in a chair holding Kengo, one of the invited guests, already bloody and beaten to death.  Then she proceeds to attack the rest of the group (minus one who hasn&#8217;t shown up yet), and this is where, for me, the movie began to fall apart.I understand the setup and the intro of the black rat character is meant to disorient and frighten the others, and it works, but there are two guys and two other girls in the room, surely enough to overpower the rat and solve the mystery before anyone else is killed.  But what do they do?  They scatter.The rat drags one of the men outside, tells him if he stops a shot into the soccer net, he&#8217;ll live.  He misses and the rat bashes his head in with a bat.Meanwhile inside--Meanwhile inside?  There shouldn&#8217;t have been any &#8220;meanwhile inside&#8221;.  As soon as the rat drags the nerdy guy outside, the rest of them should have been out the door--it wasn&#8217;t locked, was in fact wide open so when the last member of the party showed up, late, she was able to stroll right inside--and off looking for the police.  It wasn&#8217;t as if these guys killed Asuka themselves, she obviously committed suicide, so it wasn&#8217;t like they had a secret to protect.  They simply didn&#8217;t leave the school.The Rat knocks out one of the girls, ties her to a chair, and makes her play a karaoke game.  If she scores 100 points, she&#8217;ll live.  She scores 52 and is electrocuted.Meanwhile, elsewhere in the school, the other remaining guy--Asuka&#8217;s ex boyfriend--and his new girlfriend are looking for weapons.  Instead of, again, escaping and going for the police.See, the logic behind the characters&#8217; actions in this movie escaped me at every turn.  As soon as they didn&#8217;t take their first chance to get out and get help, they lost my sympathy and I decided whatever they got afterward, they had it coming for being so stupid.I was also a little disappointed with the amount of gore, which I suppose is a strange thing to be disappointed in, but we&#8217;re talking about a movie where half a dozen high schoolers are being slaughtered by someone seeking vengeance for the death of one of their friends; there should have been more gore.  Instead, every time the Rat goes in for the kill, the camera freeze-frames, goes white, cuts to the next scene.  Lame.I did like the end of the movie, even if the secret of who was under the mask was so clich&eacute;d cheat it made me sick.  I thought the third act played out very well and made sense of everything that came before.The acting edged a little too close to &#8220;silly&#8221; for me at some points, but I think that&#8217;s more cultural than talent.  I see those overdone cartoonish expressions and gestures in a lot of Asian movies.At only 75 minutes, I think BLACK RAT was the perfect length to tell a story this simple.  Anything more would have been unnecessary and only complicated a plot that didn&#8217;t require more complications.In the end, while I enjoyed BLACK RAT, I didn&#8217;t feel sorry for the incredibly stupid characters who should have gotten away when they could, and it&#8217;s that one simple flaw in the logic that, in the end, makes the story not work at all on any sensible level.  If they could have figured out a way to explain why the kids split up but no one tried to go for help, in a way that made sense, I think this would have been a much better movie overall.",3,Black Rat,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,4161,"['2010', '8217', 's', 'BLACK', 'RAT', 'classic', 'high', 'school', 'revenge', 'tale', 'only', 'mystery', 'being', 'revenge', 'whom.49', 'days', 'earlier', 'Asuka', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'committed', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'off', 'school', '8217', 'roof', 'was', 'depressed', 'group', 'friends', 'had', 'promised', 'help', 'upcoming', 'dance', 'traditional', 'festival', 'then', 'backed', 'out', 'followed', 'one', 'girls', 'gang', 'stealing', 'Asuka', '8217', 's', 'boyfriend.After', 'death', 'friends', 'tried', 'move', 'one', 'day', 'six', 'got', 'text', 'Asuka', '8217', 'phone', 'telling', 'meet', 'school', 'midnight.When', 'arrive', '8217', 're', 'greeted', 'girl', 'wearing', 'rat', 'mask', 'identical', 'one', 'Asuka', 'had', 'designed', 'festival', 'rat', 'wheels', 'chair', 'holding', 'Kengo', 'one', 'invited', 'guests', 'already', 'bloody', 'beaten', 'death', 'Then', 'attack', 'rest', 'group', 'one', 'who', 'hasn', '8217', 'shown', 'up', 'yet', 'where', 'movie', 'began', 'fall', 'apart.I', 'setup', 'intro', 'black', 'rat', 'character', 'meant', 'disorient', 'frighten', 'others', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'two', 'other', 'girls', 'room', 'surely', 'enough', 'overpower', 'rat', 'solve', 'mystery', 'anyone', 'else', 'killed', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'scatter.The', 'rat', 'one', 'men', 'shot', 'soccer', 'net', '8217', 'live', 'rat', 'head', 'bat.Meanwhile', 'inside', 'Meanwhile', '8217', 't', 'have', 'been', '8220', 'meanwhile', '8221', 'As', 'soon', 'rat', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'rest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'door', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'locked', 'was', 'fact', 'wide', 'open', 'so', 'when', 'last', 'member', 'party', 'showed', 'up', 'late', 'was', 'able', 'stroll', 'right', 'inside', 'looking', 'police', 'wasn', '8217', 'guys', 'killed', 'Asuka', 'obviously', 'committed', 'suicide', '8217', 't', 'had', 'secret', 'protect', 'simply', 'didn', '8217', 'leave', 'school.The', 'Rat', 'out', 'one', 'girls', 'chair', 'play', 'karaoke', 'game', '100', 'points', '8217', 'live', '52', 'electrocuted.Meanwhile', 'elsewhere', 'school', 'other', 'remaining', 'guy', 'Asuka', '8217', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'looking', 'weapons', 'Instead', 'again', 'escaping', 'going', 'police.See', 'logic', 'characters', '8217', 'actions', 'movie', 'escaped', 'turn', 'As', 'soon', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'take', 'first', 'chance', 'get', 'out', 'get', 'help', 'lost', 'sympathy', 'decided', 'whatever', 'got', 'afterward', 'had', 'coming', 'being', 'so', 'stupid.I', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'disappointed', 'amount', 'gore', 'suppose', 'strange', 'thing', 'be', 'disappointed', '8217', 're', 'talking', 'movie', 'where', 'dozen', 'high', 'schoolers', 'are', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'someone', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'death', 'one', 'friends', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gore', 'Instead', 'time', 'Rat', 'kill', 'camera', 'freeze-frames', 'white', 'cuts', 'next', 'scene', 'Lame.I', 'did', 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'secret', 'who', 'was', 'mask', 'was', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cheat', 'made', 'sick', 'thought', 'third', 'act', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'sense', 'everything', 'came', 'before.The', 'acting', 'edged', 'little', 'too', 'close', '8220', 'silly', '8221', 'points', 'think', '8217', 'more', 'cultural', 'talent', 'see', 'overdone', 'cartoonish', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'lot', 'Asian', 'movies.At', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'think', 'BLACK', 'RAT', 'was', 'perfect', 'length', 'tell', 'story', 'simple', 'Anything', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unnecessary', 'only', 'complicated', 'plot', 'didn', '8217', 'require', 'more', 'complications.In', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'BLACK', 'RAT', 'didn', '8217', 'feel', 'sorry', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'characters', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'when', 'could', '8217', 'one', 'simple', 'flaw', 'logic', 'end', 'story', 'not', 'work', 'sensible', 'level', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'explain', 'why', 'kids', 'split', 'up', 'one', 'tried', 'go', 'help', 'way', 'made', 'sense', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'overall']",Black Rat

I knew that ultimately it's a cheesy horror movie, so I wasn't expecting anything along the lines of The Grudge, Eko Eko Azarak, or Death Bell. I just wanted to be entertained, but unfortunately there's really not all that much to recommend this movie. It's solidly bland J-Horror fare and I'll be honest and say that you should watch this for free via CrunchyRoll since you'll probably only want to watch it once.The acting for this film is fine enough for what it was. The actors give just enough effort to keep it from being completely horrible and there's some decent performances for the most part. They just don't really give performances that would keep this from being just a mediocre flick. They're neither particularly bad nor particularly good and if I haven't seen similarly cheesy horror films saved by excellent acting, this wouldn't have been such a sore spot for me.The story here is good, but I felt like its delivery was lacking. Every time we had a nice chase scene or a good moment of tension, we'd get hit with a flashback. Sometimes these flashbacks were helpful and well placed. Other times they just sort of repeat the same themes from earlier flashbacks, which made me wonder why they bothered to include them at all. I can see that they were used to explain some of the reasoning behind the killings, but they just made the film lose its edge and caused me to lose interest. There had to have been a better way to reveal them, perhaps with more interaction between the characters rather than showing them scurrying around the campus to get picked off one by one. As it is, when the big reveal comes around I wasn't all that surprised or shocked by any of it. All of the buildup was pretty much demolished by the poor choice to insert so many flashbacks at key points.This is all so much more frustrating because this could've been such a great film. The chase scenes aren't bad. The actors aren't completely awful. The plot actually is fairly interesting. This just could have been more and I felt like the creative team didn't really shoot for the gold or even brass ring. This is the disappointment that comes from realizing that rather than make a film that could've the next Death Bell or Reincarnation, we've been given the equivalent of the US film Valentine in that it's fine enough as a ""beer and pizza"" movie but isn't something that viewers will really feel all that compelled to revisit. I know that not every film can or should be the best of the best of the best, but this is like the school braniac dropping out of school to go work at Denny's for a living.",2,"Meh, seen far better from the J-horror genre",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2746,"[""'d"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'while', 'when', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'free', 'CrunchyRoll', 'had', 'modestly', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'knew', 'ultimately', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'lines', 'Grudge', 'Eko', 'Eko', 'Azarak', 'Death', 'Bell', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'entertained', 'unfortunately', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'recommend', 'movie', 'solidly', 'bland', 'J-Horror', 'fare', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'should', 'watch', 'free', 'CrunchyRoll', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'once.The', 'acting', 'film', 'fine', 'enough', 'what', 'was', 'actors', 'give', 'just', 'enough', 'effort', 'keep', 'being', 'completely', 'horrible', 'decent', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'performances', 'would', 'keep', 'being', 'just', 'mediocre', 'flick', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'bad', 'particularly', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'similarly', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'films', 'saved', 'excellent', 'acting', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'sore', 'spot', 'me.The', 'story', 'here', 'good', 'felt', 'delivery', 'was', 'lacking', 'Every', 'time', 'had', 'nice', 'chase', 'scene', 'good', 'moment', 'tension', ""'d"", 'get', 'hit', 'flashback', 'Sometimes', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'helpful', 'well', 'placed', 'Other', 'times', 'just', 'sort', 'repeat', 'same', 'themes', 'earlier', 'flashbacks', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'include', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'used', 'explain', 'reasoning', 'killings', 'just', 'made', 'film', 'lose', 'edge', 'caused', 'lose', 'interest', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'reveal', 'perhaps', 'more', 'interaction', 'characters', 'rather', 'showing', 'scurrying', 'campus', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'when', 'big', 'reveal', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'shocked', 'buildup', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'demolished', 'poor', 'choice', 'insert', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'key', 'points.This', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'frustrating', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'film', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'awful', 'plot', 'actually', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'felt', 'creative', 'team', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'shoot', 'gold', 'even', 'brass', 'ring', 'disappointment', 'realizing', 'rather', 'make', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'next', 'Death', 'Bell', 'Reincarnation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'equivalent', 'US', 'film', 'Valentine', 'fine', 'enough', 'beer', 'pizza', 'movie', ""n't"", 'something', 'viewers', 'will', 'really', 'feel', 'compelled', 'revisit', 'know', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'best', 'best', 'school', 'braniac', 'dropping', 'school', 'go', 'work', 'Denny', 'living']",Black Rat
1424147,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004QI14UC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I don't have a lot of experience criticizing Japanese horror movies, but Black Rat is one of the rare J-Horror films that just didn't deliver the goods.  For one thing, it's surprisingly unoriginal - six classmates get invited to a location, only to find themselves fighting for their lives against a mysterious killer.  The location is the school where their mutual friend Asuka jumped off the roof to her death seven weeks earlier, and the time is midnight - and they all actually show up.  I don't know about you, but if I get a text message from a girl who killed herself seven weeks ago asking me to meet her at the school building at midnight, I wouldn't even consider going - not even if the dead girl was smoking hot.  Curiosity can have the cat - but it ain't getting me.All Asuka wanted was for her friends to join her in performing some traditional dance of Seven Rats at the school's arts festival.  Then, after they all initially agreed to do it, they refused to practice and pretty much just bailed on her, even after she had spent all this time constructing a really cool rat mask to wear.  I'm not really sure why all of these people - who sort of represent the characters in the story of the Seven Rats - were actually friends, as all of them except Asuka and one of the other girls are pretty much jerks in their own special ways - and even the nice girl doesn't turn out to be the kind of person you really want for a best friend.  The thing with Asuka, though, is that she is always smiling - even when her friends are totally dumping on her.  From the audience's perspective, she's a very sympathetic character, which makes the fact of her suicide particularly tragic.  She actually jumped off the roof of the school wearing the rat mask she had created.  So that's the backstory, which is presented in a series of flashbacks as the movie progresses.Back to the schoolroom that dark night, though, these other six kids who stupidly accepted the invitation to show up are greeted by a girl wearing Asuka's bloodstained rat's head, who uses flash cards to let the others know that she is going to kill all of them.  Is it really Asuka's ghost underneath that creepy rat head?  The film does a good job of really keeping the mystery of the killer's identity just that - a mystery, throwing several wicked curveballs at the audience as the movie progresses.  There's not a great deal of blood and gore involved with the actual killings, but they are unique and some of them are creepy in their own special way, but it's really the question of the killer's identity that drives the story.  Black Rat does deliver a deeper storyline that your traditional slasher, and the whole thing with the rat mask is pretty creepy, but it sort of feels like director Kenta Fukasaku was trying to invoke the atmosphere of an American slasher film, and I think that was a mistake.",3,"You can dance if you wanna, you can leave your friends behind",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,2881,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'experience', 'criticizing', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'Black', 'Rat', 'one', 'rare', 'J-Horror', 'films', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'goods', 'one', 'thing', 'surprisingly', 'unoriginal', 'six', 'classmates', 'get', 'invited', 'location', 'only', 'find', 'fighting', 'lives', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'location', 'school', 'where', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Asuka', 'jumped', 'off', 'roof', 'death', 'seven', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'time', 'midnight', 'actually', 'show', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'get', 'text', 'message', 'girl', 'who', 'killed', 'seven', 'weeks', 'ago', 'asking', 'meet', 'school', 'building', 'midnight', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'going', 'not', 'even', 'dead', 'girl', 'was', 'smoking', 'hot', 'Curiosity', 'can', 'have', 'cat', 'ai', ""n't"", 'getting', 'me.All', 'Asuka', 'wanted', 'was', 'friends', 'join', 'performing', 'traditional', 'dance', 'Seven', 'Rats', 'school', 'arts', 'festival', 'Then', 'initially', 'agreed', 'do', 'refused', 'practice', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'bailed', 'even', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'constructing', 'really', 'cool', 'rat', 'mask', 'wear', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'sort', 'represent', 'characters', 'story', 'Seven', 'Rats', 'were', 'actually', 'friends', 'Asuka', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'jerks', 'own', 'special', 'ways', 'even', 'nice', 'girl', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'person', 'really', 'want', 'best', 'friend', 'thing', 'Asuka', 'though', 'always', 'smiling', 'even', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'totally', 'dumping', 'audience', 'perspective', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'fact', 'suicide', 'particularly', 'tragic', 'actually', 'jumped', 'roof', 'school', 'wearing', 'rat', 'mask', 'had', 'created', 'backstory', 'presented', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'progresses.Back', 'schoolroom', 'dark', 'night', 'though', 'other', 'six', 'kids', 'who', 'stupidly', 'accepted', 'invitation', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'greeted', 'girl', 'wearing', 'Asuka', 'bloodstained', 'rat', 'head', 'who', 'flash', 'cards', 'let', 'others', 'know', 'going', 'kill', 'really', 'Asuka', 'ghost', 'underneath', 'rat', 'head', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'really', 'keeping', 'mystery', 'killer', 'identity', 'just', 'mystery', 'throwing', 'several', 'wicked', 'curveballs', 'audience', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'blood', 'gore', 'involved', 'actual', 'killings', 'are', 'unique', 'are', 'creepy', 'own', 'special', 'way', 'really', 'question', 'killer', 'identity', 'story', 'Black', 'Rat', 'deliver', 'deeper', 'storyline', 'traditional', 'slasher', 'whole', 'thing', 'rat', 'mask', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'sort', 'feels', 'director', 'Kenta', 'Fukasaku', 'was', 'trying', 'invoke', 'atmosphere', 'American', 'slasher', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'mistake']",Black Rat

1424149,A1WJZABTJOW65B,B004QI14UC,"Michael A. Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[5, 5]","The film opens with the recital of a traditional Japanese children's story about seven dancing rats, all of whom vary in appearance and personality. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this is a bit of foreshadowing and the characters are being described before they're introduced. We then get right to it as the inevitable campus slasher element is set up, albeit in a very unusual approach on director Fukasaku's part. A teenage girl named Asuka is shown dancing on the rooftop of her school as a rat mask sits nearby - the beautifully-photographed scene accompanied by a sad piano score. The girl suddenly commits suicide, her best friend mourns, and a small group of fellow students suddenly receive a message from the dead girl two months later inviting them to meet her in the empty halls of the school late one night. The students gather in a room, and a girl in a rat mask jubilantly marches in and proceeds to attack them all with a baseball bat. The students scatter, and the game of rat and mouse begins.BLACK RAT is an interesting slasher in that it doesn't really fall into a lot of the traps (no pun intended) that American slashers do. It's structured in a unique way, skipping the first act altogether and getting right down to business with the stalk-and-slash shenanigans that would normally come in the second act. To make up for the missing first act, however, the film constantly cuts away from the campus-slashing and throws in a bunch of flashback scenes that reveal the events leading up to Asuka's suicide and explaining how this seemingly random group of students are tied together. Once the film reaches a certain point, it becomes apparent that these flashback scenes are necessary in giving the story some depth, but it doesn't change the fact that they kill the tension of the stalk-and-slash scenes.Something else that works in the favor of BLACK RAT is that it's not an excuse to showcase a series of creative death scenes (although we certainly get that). At face value it's a teen slasher, but there's a huge element of mystery to the story. The question is raised as to whether Asuka has really come back from the dead, or if someone else is acting on her behalf and why. Also noteworthy is the photography. The bright flashback scenes are contrasted by the dark campus slasher scenes, in which Fukasaku utilizes SUSPIRIA-esque gelled lighting to create a nightmarish mood.In the end, BLACK RAT stands out as a slasher, but not necessarily for all the right reasons. Its unique touches, insane climax, and memorable killer separates it from the rest of the pack, but a lot of people may find its off-beat plot structure to be frustrating. Worth checking out if becomes readily available, but not something I'd recommend anyone other than slasher or J-Horror enthusiasts go out of their way to acquire.",3,Slasher with a twist,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2844,"['film', 'recital', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'children', 'story', 'seven', 'dancing', 'rats', 'whom', 'vary', 'appearance', 'personality', ""n't"", 'take', 'genius', 'figure', 'out', 'bit', 'foreshadowing', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'described', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'then', 'get', 'right', 'inevitable', 'campus', 'slasher', 'element', 'set', 'up', 'albeit', 'very', 'unusual', 'approach', 'director', 'Fukasaku', 'part', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Asuka', 'shown', 'dancing', 'rooftop', 'school', 'rat', 'mask', 'nearby', 'beautifully-photographed', 'scene', 'accompanied', 'sad', 'piano', 'score', 'girl', 'suddenly', 'suicide', 'best', 'friend', 'mourns', 'small', 'group', 'fellow', 'students', 'suddenly', 'receive', 'message', 'dead', 'girl', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'inviting', 'meet', 'empty', 'halls', 'school', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'students', 'gather', 'room', 'girl', 'rat', 'mask', 'jubilantly', 'proceeds', 'attack', 'baseball', 'bat', 'students', 'scatter', 'game', 'rat', 'mouse', 'begins.BLACK', 'RAT', 'interesting', 'slasher', ""n't"", 'really', 'fall', 'lot', 'traps', 'pun', 'intended', 'American', 'slashers', 'do', 'structured', 'unique', 'way', 'skipping', 'first', 'act', 'altogether', 'getting', 'right', 'down', 'business', 'stalk-and-slash', 'shenanigans', 'would', 'normally', 'come', 'second', 'act', 'make', 'up', 'missing', 'first', 'act', 'however', 'film', 'constantly', 'away', 'campus-slashing', 'bunch', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Asuka', 'suicide', 'explaining', 'how', 'seemingly', 'random', 'group', 'students', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'film', 'certain', 'point', 'apparent', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'necessary', 'giving', 'story', 'depth', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'kill', 'tension', 'stalk-and-slash', 'scenes.Something', 'else', 'favor', 'BLACK', 'RAT', 'not', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'series', 'creative', 'death', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'get', 'face', 'value', 'teen', 'slasher', 'huge', 'element', 'mystery', 'story', 'question', 'raised', 'Asuka', 'really', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'someone', 'else', 'acting', 'behalf', 'why', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'photography', 'bright', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'contrasted', 'dark', 'campus', 'slasher', 'scenes', 'Fukasaku', 'SUSPIRIA-esque', 'gelled', 'lighting', 'create', 'nightmarish', 'mood.In', 'end', 'BLACK', 'RAT', 'out', 'slasher', 'not', 'necessarily', 'right', 'reasons', 'unique', 'touches', 'insane', 'climax', 'memorable', 'killer', 'rest', 'pack', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'off-beat', 'plot', 'structure', 'be', 'frustrating', 'checking', 'out', 'becomes', 'readily', 'available', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'other', 'slasher', 'J-Horror', 'enthusiasts', 'go', 'way', 'acquire']",Black Rat

I saw it on Netflix so I didn't pay anything, I wouldn't recommend spending too much considering how short it is.

1424151,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004QI14UC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Kuronezumi (Black Rat) (Kenta Fukasaku, 2010)There was a time when you could pick up a horror film from any random country in southeast Asia and be guaranteed, if not a great time, a time better than you would get from 99% of the horror films made in America (for that matter, anywhere in the west) in the same year. Those days disappeared sometime during the first third of the last decade, more or less, but the average level of horror coming out of Japan, Korea, Thailand, et al. is still a good deal higher than one can find in America, England, Spain, and most other western countries (France, of all places, has been turning out some stellar horror pictures, and of course there's Guillermo del Toro's Mexican base of operations). That said, every once in a while, you run across a southeast Asian horror film that seems as if it could have come out of a big-budget Hollywood studio, for all the derivativeness, senselessness, and downright stupidity to be found there. Japan, who led the charge into the golden age of Asian horror, has also been responsible for the worst Asian horror films of the past few years (one word: Grotesque). While Black Rat doesn't quite scrape the bottom of the barrel, it's so generic that you will likely have forgotten the majority of it within a half-hour after you've turned it off and gone on to something more exciting, like hitting yourself in the head with a cudgel.Plot: group of kids. Masked person killing them in inventive ways.Yes, that's it. You've seen it at least a half-dozen times before, even if you're not a horror film fan--and if you are, you've probably seen this hundreds of times. Hundreds. The only thing that distinguishes movies like this from one another is the inventiveness, or lack of same, in the kills. Every Saw movie after the second qualifies. The vast majority of Hollywood horror remakes, both of foreign and of domestic films. For that matter, the Japanese have been doing it more and more (I could copy and paste this review into the header a couple of pages above this for X Game, also released in 2010, and not have to change a single word). It's not that it's a terrible movie, it's just something you've seen so often before that why would you want to watch it again? Grab any random horror flick from France or Ireland or, hell, Turkey or Albania or Estonia (yes, Estonians are making horror films now! [link to The Phobos]) and you'll probably get something at least slightly more original than this. * ",2,"Move along, nothing new to see here.",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,2487,"['Kuronezumi', 'Black', 'Rat', 'Kenta', 'Fukasaku', '2010', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'horror', 'film', 'random', 'country', 'southeast', 'Asia', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'not', 'great', 'time', 'time', 'better', 'would', 'get', '99', '%', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'America', 'matter', 'anywhere', 'west', 'same', 'year', 'days', 'disappeared', 'sometime', 'first', 'third', 'last', 'decade', 'more', 'less', 'average', 'level', 'horror', 'coming', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Thailand', 'et', 'al', 'still', 'good', 'deal', 'higher', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'America', 'England', 'Spain', 'most', 'other', 'western', 'countries', 'France', 'places', 'been', 'turning', 'out', 'stellar', 'horror', 'pictures', 'course', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'Mexican', 'base', 'operations', 'said', 'once', 'while', 'run', 'southeast', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'derivativeness', 'senselessness', 'downright', 'stupidity', 'be', 'found', 'there', 'Japan', 'who', 'led', 'charge', 'golden', 'age', 'Asian', 'horror', 'also', 'been', 'responsible', 'worst', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'word', 'Grotesque', 'Black', 'Rat', ""n't"", 'quite', 'scrape', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'so', 'generic', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'forgotten', 'majority', 'half-hour', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'off', 'gone', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'hitting', 'head', 'cudgel.Plot', 'group', 'kids', 'Masked', 'person', 'killing', 'inventive', 'ways.Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'fan', 'are', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'times', 'Hundreds', 'only', 'thing', 'movies', 'one', 'inventiveness', 'lack', 'same', 'kills', 'Every', 'Saw', 'movie', 'second', 'qualifies', 'vast', 'majority', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'remakes', 'foreign', 'domestic', 'films', 'matter', 'Japanese', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'more', 'more', 'could', 'copy', 'paste', 'review', 'header', 'couple', 'pages', 'X', 'Game', 'also', 'released', '2010', 'not', 'have', 'change', 'single', 'word', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'often', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Grab', 'random', 'horror', 'flick', 'France', 'Ireland', 'hell', 'Turkey', 'Albania', 'Estonia', 'yes', 'Estonians', 'are', 'making', 'horror', 'films', 'now', '[', 'link', 'Phobos', ']', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'something', 'least', 'slightly', 'more', 'original', '*']",Black Rat

Asuka  commits suicide. Later her 6 friends get a text message from her to meet her in school at midnight. Here the vengeance killings  begin. We get flashbacks as to the reason behind the suicide and killings. It seems Asuka was suffering some teen angst with boyfriend problems and her friends not wanting to participate in her idea for a rat festival dance. Oh yes, the horrible bullies got on her because she smiled too much. Yup. That's worth jumping off a building.The slasher plot was slightly different. Always like those school girl uniforms.
