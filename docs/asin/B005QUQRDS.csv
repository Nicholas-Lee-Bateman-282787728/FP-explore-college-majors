1497822,AFH39CEQQZ9JB,B005QUQRDS,Bradley Stephenson,"[41, 49]","I've been practising Yoga for six or so years now so didn't really buy this DVD because I was after a beginners practice, I actually bought it because I was after a Yoga DVD featuring a male instructor which is almost impossible to find (as much as I love Shiva Rea's DVDs).Having said that I really enjoyed this DVD. The instructor sets a great pace and explains the physical and mental aspects or the practice very clearly which brings a new depth to each pose. Being an Intermediate practitioner I can see myself coming back to this DVD every now and then when I want a slower practice.This DVD is definitely aimed for Beginners though and unlike most of the other ""Beginnner"" DVDs on Amazon, this one would actually be perfect for real first timers or those who have only taken a few classes. Actually think I'll buy this for my mother as all of the other Beginner DVDs I've got are way too advanced for most first timers.If you're like me however, and you find ""mirroring"" confusing (i.e. instructor says raise your right hand and he's shown raising his left) be warned as this entire DVD is in this style. Personally I don't know why instructors feel the need to do mirroring as I don't think I've ever seen it work in class and almost always confuses people who are trying to mimic the instructor only to realise they're doing it backwards. I actually found myself choosing to avoid watching the screen as to not through myself off during the arm and leg raises in the FLOW practice.This DVD is also rather short compared to some of the other Yoga DVDs (like Shiva Reas which fit 2-3 hours of footage).If you're after a male instructor and/or a complete beginner though I do recommend picking this up. Here's hoping Tamal releases a future DVD that is longer and un-mirrored.",4,Great for First Timers Though Short and Mirrored,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1782,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'practising', 'Yoga', 'six', 'so', 'years', 'now', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'beginners', 'practice', 'actually', 'bought', 'was', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'male', 'instructor', 'almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'DVDs', '.Having', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'great', 'pace', 'physical', 'mental', 'aspects', 'practice', 'very', 'clearly', 'new', 'depth', 'pose', 'Being', 'Intermediate', 'practitioner', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'back', 'DVD', 'now', 'then', 'when', 'want', 'slower', 'practice.This', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'Beginners', 'most', 'other', 'Beginnner', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', 'one', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'perfect', 'real', 'first', 'timers', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'taken', 'few', 'classes', 'Actually', 'think', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'mother', 'other', 'Beginner', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'got', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'advanced', 'most', 'first', 'timers.If', ""'re"", 'however', 'find', 'mirroring', 'confusing', 'i.e', 'instructor', 'raise', 'right', 'hand', 'shown', 'raising', 'left', 'be', 'warned', 'entire', 'DVD', 'style', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'instructors', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'mirroring', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'work', 'class', 'almost', 'always', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'mimic', 'instructor', 'only', 'realise', ""'re"", 'doing', 'actually', 'found', 'choosing', 'avoid', 'watching', 'screen', 'not', 'off', 'arm', 'leg', 'raises', 'FLOW', 'practice.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'rather', 'short', 'compared', 'other', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'Shiva', 'Reas', 'fit', '2-3', 'hours', 'footage', '.If', ""'re"", 'male', 'instructor', 'and/or', 'complete', 'beginner', 'do', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Tamal', 'future', 'DVD', 'longer', 'un-mirrored']",N/A

1497826,A3RRIP2E45NGRQ,B005QUQRDS,LCW,"[11, 12]","My main issue with this DVD is that the difficulty level of the two workouts is really quite extreme and some people might not be prepared for that.The Hatha session is wonderful, soothing, and relaxing.  It will definitely relax you at the end of a long day and help work on flexibility.  I encourage everyone, beginners and advanced yogis alike, to use the strap as the instructor demonstrates.  I didn't because I never use straps or blocks in my yoga practice but one day for the hell of it I did and it really adds a lot to this session.  You feel and stretch your muscles in new ways.The flow session is quite a power packed little workout that those new to yoga, overweight, or new to fitness in general will find very challenging.  It is miles away from the ease of the Hatha session. There are some great strength building sequences, very good core and balance focus, and you will get a decent full body workout in 30 minutes.  I would hesitate to call this a beginner workout though.  You will need a beginning understanding of basic yoga poses and knowledge of proper form.If you approach the flow session by going easy on yourself, taking breaks when you need to, and focusing on doing the best you can at that moment I think you may like this video and will be encouraged by your progress the more you do it.  Use the Hatha session as your reward for putting in a good effort.The instructor is encouraging and manages to strike a good balance between being motivating and babbling on and on to the point of distraction.  His focus and guidance on breath, the essence of Yoga, is excellent.For those brand spankin new to Yoga I recommend the beginner Yoga Zone dvds.  They are, IMO, the best at explaining proper form, giving a good background on Yoga, and guiding you as you learn about this great form of exercise that nourishes your soul at the same time.  For beginners with a basic knowledge of poses and alignment but wanting a little bit more challenge (not quite as difficult as the flow practice on this DVD) I recommend Baron Baptiste Power Yoga Level 1.  Don't be scared by the title.  You will work up a sweat and get a good workout that is very accessible and easy to follow.",4,A good dvd with reservations,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2200,"['main', 'issue', 'DVD', 'difficulty', 'level', 'two', 'workouts', 'really', 'quite', 'extreme', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'prepared', 'that.The', 'Hatha', 'session', 'wonderful', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'will', 'definitely', 'relax', 'end', 'long', 'day', 'help', 'work', 'flexibility', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'beginners', 'advanced', 'yogis', 'alike', 'use', 'strap', 'instructor', 'did', ""n't"", 'never', 'use', 'straps', 'blocks', 'yoga', 'practice', 'one', 'day', 'hell', 'did', 'really', 'lot', 'session', 'feel', 'stretch', 'muscles', 'new', 'ways.The', 'flow', 'session', 'quite', 'power', 'packed', 'little', 'workout', 'new', 'yoga', 'overweight', 'new', 'fitness', 'general', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'challenging', 'miles', 'away', 'ease', 'Hatha', 'session', 'are', 'great', 'strength', 'building', 'sequences', 'very', 'good', 'core', 'balance', 'focus', 'will', 'get', 'decent', 'full', 'body', 'workout', '30', 'minutes', 'would', 'hesitate', 'call', 'beginner', 'will', 'need', 'beginning', 'understanding', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'knowledge', 'proper', 'form.If', 'approach', 'flow', 'session', 'going', 'easy', 'taking', 'breaks', 'when', 'need', 'focusing', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'moment', 'think', 'may', 'like', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'encouraged', 'progress', 'more', 'do', 'Use', 'Hatha', 'session', 'reward', 'putting', 'good', 'effort.The', 'instructor', 'encouraging', 'manages', 'strike', 'good', 'balance', 'being', 'motivating', 'babbling', 'point', 'distraction', 'focus', 'guidance', 'breath', 'essence', 'Yoga', 'excellent.For', 'brand', 'spankin', 'new', 'Yoga', 'recommend', 'beginner', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'dvds', 'are', 'IMO', 'best', 'explaining', 'proper', 'form', 'giving', 'good', 'background', 'Yoga', 'guiding', 'learn', 'great', 'form', 'exercise', 'soul', 'same', 'time', 'beginners', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'poses', 'alignment', 'wanting', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'challenge', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'difficult', 'flow', 'practice', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Level', '1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'title', 'will', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'very', 'accessible', 'easy', 'follow']",N/A

Farver ""crabbup""","[1, 1]","After 30 years away from yoga, and having sustained a herniated disc along with degenerative disease and sciatica, I was in rough shape.  Trying to avoid surgery, I did yoga classes for 2 months, 3x a week with varied teachers.  Not sure I could have jumped into a tape of any kind without this background.  I bought another tape along with this one, the Zyrta (?) one.  I like her, but she spends a lot of arm waving time getting you from one pose to another.  And I find her too fast.  For my problems, the longer one holds and concentrates on the breath in the pose the better, and this is what Dodge does.  Acquiring something to use for a strap is not a big deal.  I have a stretchy rope that I acquired from my physical therapist, and it does the job well.  You can use your imagination on it, but SOMETHING of that nature will help you a lot to listen to your body.  I am most pleased with this particular tape.  He does the best visulaization and cool down I have heard, and I have heard a lot.  Not so chatty, not having to listen to &#34;relax this and relax that&#34; ad infinitum.
