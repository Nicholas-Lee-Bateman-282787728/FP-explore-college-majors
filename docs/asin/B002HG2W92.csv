During their flight, dubbed  the ""Bride Flight,"" they form a friendship with each other and with a handsome man-also striking out on his own adventure.  The scenes on the plane provide the viewer with lots of groundwork about each character and shows us glimpses of their reasons for leaving behind the life they had. When they arrive in New Zealand the story continues and takes on qualities that all endearing love stories deliver.Character and story development are done using flashbacks and strong acting.  Sometimes with so many prime characters flashbacks can be confusing, however in this film they fit seamlessly and build a rich story.

1268542,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B002HG2W92,MadMacs,"[28, 32]","Explores the deepest core of love and the heart of friendship; of the passage of fifty years and the lives we lead in those decades. And interestingly, delves into one country's cultural heritage and addresses another's guilt.'Bride' tells the story of three young Dutch women who share one moment in history, a journey from post-war Holland to the cold beauty of 1950's New Zealand as war brides. Until this film, I associated this term with soldiers who fell in love with women from other countries and brought them home. But I see now it can also be defined as women who want to leave their own war shattering experiences behind - starting life anew someplace else.In the film we follow the lives of Ada, Marjorie and Esther. How vastly dissimilar their journeys were despite beginning from a common starting point: Each one signing a marriage contract after meeting prospective grooms from the faraway island nation. But choices made in the spirit and heat of the moment come back to haunt them. One as her body unexpectedly fails her - the other two as they learn their chosen mates unintentionally obscured an important personality trait that they discover only after leaving everything behind.Thankfully, the filmmakers and cast avoid pathetically obvious plot devices. None of the men are physically abusive or demented sexual freaks; neither are they criminals on the run or obnoxious gas bags. No, these are essentially good men, in their own way. But men who have complex character issues. And it's these issues that makes this so much more than a run-of-the-mill Oxygen or Lifetime flick.Fairly or unfairly, the story of Ada is the primary tale. Especially given that her choice was not really her choice at all. In the 1950's a woman could not be pregnant and unmarried. To say the two concepts were incompatible in this period of history would be an understatement. So a moment of pity and kindness turns into a lifetime of dreariness with a man who I would describe as a 'monster' of sorts. No, he doesn't beat her. But he's incredibly detached, emotionally and sexually. A fundamental religious person, who is also fanatically frugal, only adds to the general disregard that I feel toward this fellow dude. He's the worst kind of automaton - a zealot. Can you imagine fifty years stuck with someone like that? Note: I'm not opposed to a life of austerity and religious piety. But Ada was not allowed to make a fully disclosed choice; her contract was, in many ways, a lie. And I detest lying on principal, but especially as a form of indentured servitude. So I truly feel and sympathize with Ada's plight.Esther's story is probably the most intriguing of the three. An aspect of The Netherlands that many would prefer forgotten was the acquiescence of the Dutch people to social fascism. The willingness to identify, categorize, hunt down and deliver their Jewish population to the German 'Die Endl&ouml;sung' - The Final Solution. Esther's entire family is murdered in the Holocaust. Sadly, why and how she survived is not explained by the filmmakers, although she alludes to an eerily similar fate shared by Anne Frank.Determined and focused, Esther moves herself 10,000 miles and three continents away in order to forget. She will not play the role of victim, nor savior to her genetic past. For her, life is a fresh start, and one she will take on her terms alone. So when she gets pregnant, her choice is both pragmatic and so terribly soul-crushing. I truly wish there were more of her, a backstory and fuller presentation of her life. But three leads was the choice of writer Marieke van der Pol, so three it is.And finally the story of Marjorie. Hers is the best match, the most promising. Her husband is a decent guy, talented and on his way up. Their pairing is very good and the love they feel for one another genuine. Their combined dream: Raise a big family. It's obvious that this film is about twisted fate and lost dreams, so you know what happens next.These friends, their intersecting lives, and their often heart-breaking choices make for an intimate look into the very heart of one's true love, life friendships, and ultimately, forgiveness and acceptance.'Bride' is a quiet retrospective film that, like the wonderful US production 'Avalon', completely develops and delivers in two all-too-brief hours one nation's sense of self, while also spotlighting another nation's sense of dishonor and regret.Personal Notes:- I'm a huge fan of Rutger Hauer, and was completely stunned to see him in this production. Happily so.- I'm straight, but if I played for the other team, I can see where Waldemar Torenstra would make me swoon. In college he's the kind of guy we used to call a ""Magnet"". The dude is flat out gorgeous; a more approachable Brad Pitt in his prime. Dang, I wish I looked like him. Can only imagine the copious amounts of tail he gets. &lt;g>",5,Profoundly Rich And Layered Film,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,4890,"['deepest', 'core', 'love', 'heart', 'friendship', 'passage',

They are all escaping Holland in the post war years of 1953.  Three of the women are meeting up with soon to be husbands who have come ahead and are looking for opportunities in the new world of New Zealand.  Frank, the lone man in the group becomes acquainted with the women in ways that become apparent as the story unfolds.  Ada, the young farm girl's husband is a very strict Mennonite guy who is not only cold to her but makes her ride in the back of a pickup for five hours while the minister sits in the front seat.  The home he provides for her is well, that's one of the surprises! Marjorie has a happy reunion with her mate and having great hopes for happiness and a large family is soon faced with tragedy.  Esther, a beautiful fashion designer has escaped the holocaust which claimed the rest of her family.  Her espoused is a strict Orthodox Jew who wants her to be the same way, and given Esther's recent loss she does not embrace this idea at all.  Frank, the lone male in this group becomes involved with both Ada and Esther because he sees that they are unhappy with their decisions.  As the movie progresses we see just how intense Frank is and how this all plays out in everybody's lives. I really liked the cinemetography in this movie as it really showed the starkness as well as the beauty of the different parts of New Zealand.  The film is in Dutch with English subtitles, but further along in the movie there will be English speaking as well, and mostly on the part of Esther as she becomes more involved in the fashion world.

The story shines a light on a little known event, or series of events, following World War II, as New Zealand opened its gates to european immigrants in order to re-vitalize their post-war economy.  One of the means of accomplishing this was through marriage-by-proxie arrangements, often with prospective husbands in New Zealand never having met the women they had contracted to marry.  The women came, though, seeking the opportunity to build a new life, in a thriving, new land.
