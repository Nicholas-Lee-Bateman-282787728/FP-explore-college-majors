Great episodes in general.  Enjoyable commentary by Peter Horton and Patricia Wettig.  One more thing, after going back and visiting these episodes it's obvious that much of television today pales in comparison to the quality of thirtysomething's writing, the characters, and the show in general.  I absolutely LOVE going back and watching these episodes and hearing the commentary about how the scenes were filmed, the actors/directors' memories of the episode and the writing, etc.  (I would like to hear commentary by Polly Draper though, maybe on season 4?)",5,Season Three - Thirtysomething,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,776,"['excellent', 'season', 'full', 'great', 'episodes', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Timothy', 'Busfield', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'cameos', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'others', 'Great', 'general', 'Enjoyable', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'going', 'back', 'visiting', 'obvious', 'much', 'television', 'today', 'comparison', 'quality', 'thirtysomething', 'writing', 'characters', 'show', 'general', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'going', 'back', 'watching', 'episodes', 'hearing', 'commentary', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'actors/directors', 'memories', 'episode', 'writing', 'etc', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'commentary', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'maybe', 'season', '4']",N/A

This is a show that really gets into the hearts and minds of a variety of individuals whose lives are intertwined through friendship, family and marriage. The series explores the real problems experienced by these individuals and does so very honestly and openly. Struggles with children, careers, infidelity, health, relationship - all very real and still dealt with and faced the same way today as they were when the series first aired. Young and older viewers, I feel, can relate to the characters. It's something that never changes or grows old.Each episode is packed with stories of issues that are meaningful - some will make you laugh, others will make you cry, while still some others will show you just how confusing life is and how, with the help of good friends such as are within the group which comprises the cast of ThirtySomething, we can get through it all, one way or another.I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed it the first time around. Good stories, good acting by a cast who presents themselves as very realistic characters - the kind of life portrayal that will make you feel like you're joining your own close friends in conversation about the very real facts of everyday life. Guaranteed - you'll bond with some, or all, of these characters, for every aspect of life is explored in this series - you can't help but find yourself within there!I highly recommend this series - any and each season!",5,Looking Back at a Great TV Series,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,1530,"['enjoyed', 'ThirtySomething', 'when', 'originally', 'ran', 'TV', 'now', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'sets', 'again', 'show', 'really', 'hearts', 'minds', 'variety', 'individuals', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'friendship', 'family', 'marriage', 'series', 'real', 'problems', 'experienced', 'individuals', 'so', 'very', 'honestly', 'openly', 'children', 'careers', 'infidelity', 'health', 'relationship', 'very', 'real', 'still', 'dealt', 'faced', 'same', 'way', 'today', 'were', 'when', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'Young', 'older', 'viewers', 'feel', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'something', 'never', 'old.Each', 'episode', 'packed', 'stories', 'issues', 'are', 'meaningful', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'others', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'still', 'others', 'will', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'confusing', 'life', 'how', 'help', 'good', 'friends', 'such', 'are', 'group', 'cast', 'ThirtySomething', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'way', 'another.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Good', 'stories', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'who', 'very', 'realistic', 'characters', 'kind', 'life', 'portrayal', 'will', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'joining', 'own', 'close', 'friends', 'conversation', 'very', 'real', 'facts', 'everyday', 'life', 'Guaranteed', ""'ll"", 'bond', 'characters', 'aspect', 'life', 'explored', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'season']",N/A

The writers and producers were confident in this world and in the actors' abilities and took the stories to some new (both dark and light) places.At the time, some people complained that it was just a bunch of whining from overly privileged people.  But, one, that was in a way part of the point: people who have all these advantages are still people with problems, ambitions and feelings.  And two, none of the characters really ""had it all"" and this season, with the work stories of Michael and Elliot, the reconcoliation/cancer stories of Nancy and Elliot, gave the characters real problems.

How many  recent broadcast tv dramas will do the same?I was twentysomething when it was broadcast, and while my life could not have been less like those of the characters, I enjoyed it. As a fortysomething(due to the long delay in this series coming out on DVD) I still enjoy it. Strong writing, characters, and acting ensure that this does not feel dated( though it is amusing to relive the fashions of the time and see how big the cell phones were).I can't comment on the extras- I rarely ever watch/listen to them- I prefer to let the work speak for itself. The quality of the video  and audio were just fine on my non- HD tv. The booklet is worth looking at only for the hilariously banal one line descriptions of the  episodes.I was surprised by how much of this show seemed familiar after all this time- more stuck in my memory than I would have guessed, but I related to it somewhat differently than when I was younger.
