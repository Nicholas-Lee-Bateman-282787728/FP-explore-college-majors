The stunts were the nastiest. I own all three volumes so far. I hope there is more to come. The nudity in this DVD when i bought it from Borders was uncensored you can see all the nudity no censoring. There probably is a censored version too. I'm pretty sure Steve-O is going to make a vol. 4. A lot of the stunts has to do with s**t. It was real funny though.

Don't buy it  if you are a huge Jackass fan, or if you are a huge crazy-wild-ha-ha stunt fan. Get the other Steve-O DVDs instead. They're shot better, the stunts are better, and the gross out stuff is more funny and less simply repulsive. This whole DVD is just one big stupid, poorly shot, badly lit, annoying non-event.It's watching remakes of the two hours of the same old tired sunts you've seen on the other Steve-O DVDs, and nothing near as close as the ""quality"" antics you found on Jackass The Movie or Jackass DVDs. There's alot of blood, alot of very un-funny scat and pee, some boobs and male nudity, and precious few funny stunts or amusing craziness. Watching Steve-O use a staple gun on his body or jump into a crowd was funny the first ten times - now on this 3rd DVD it's just one big yawn.This DVD is pretty much lacking in any amazing stunts. It's mostly gross out content - which is getting really old by now. I can only stand so much watching Steve-O bleed while he uses a staple gun or watch his buddies destroy stages / hotel rooms / whatever. Most of this DVD involves Steve O drinking amazing amounts of booze, going on stage interacting with rowdy, drunk crowds and... doing nothing special!The ""ohmyGOD!"" gross-out sickness you might expect isn't funny, it's just poorly shot and disgusting - fortunately the cast laughs in the right places to let you know when it should be funny and not just disturbing.It's just the same old junk you've already seen ten times from the Jackass crew, just twice as lame and performed by only the ""B"" list stars of the Jackass features.Special featurette is just more of the same, except even more crudely edited and REALLY vauge.

Still, Steve-O is a masochist, and you are interested in popular 21st century culture.The second DVD was less interesting - less of the man, Steve-O, and more of trivia.Steve-O Out on Bail is a complete waste of time and money. It's like going to a friend's house and watching two hours of home video.The DVD dedicates little time to Steve-O as a performer and much more time to ""between the acts"" footage. If you were Steve-O and one of his crew, this would be a perfect DVD, since you're following all their ""adventures.""If you're not a member of the crew, you'll wonder why this DVD was made, except to rake in money.This DVD takes all the fun and mystery out of Steve-O and turns it into what he is: a drugged-out person with an out-of-control crew. It is a home movie made for the enjoyment of the participants. It is not a DVD made for the fans. It is narcissistic, self-centered, and an insult to anyone that likes Steve-O.The first DVD in this series showed that Steve-O at least enjoyed sex... or masturbation. This DVD concentrates on scat and pissing. Perhaps Steve-O forgot what is fun and interesting to an adult.That's fine if you're 6 and giggle at words like ""wee-wee"". It's not fine if you're a relatively adult person and are looking for a connection with the performer.Steve-O and his crew have spun out of control with this abomination of a video.

It's amazing how adults, including the guys in this DVD, can still be stuck in a pre-adolescent mind frame. Jackass and other skater/prank-stuntmen and shows all seem to have appeal in the lowest level of entertainment. Acting like an absolute moron for cheap thrills and attention is funny when you're a kid or early teenager but it can't be right for twenty or thirty something to make a career out of it. It is especially wrong when it threatens your life, health and dignity for money.This show influences kids much more to do stupid harmful things then what parents thought heavy metal or rap music used to do.These guys also give a bad name for skateboarding, as if it hasn't been affected enough by hip hop influence and brand clothing styles.The shows might have been slightly amusing when they first came because of the shock and awe but it's gets old fast.It's good that these shows are fading and aren't as popular as they were some years ago.",1,Just plain bad...,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,996,"['video', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'amazing', 'how', 'adults', 'including', 'guys', 'DVD', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'stuck', 'pre-adolescent', 'mind', 'frame', 'Jackass', 'other', 'skater/prank-stuntmen', 'seem', 'have', 'appeal', 'lowest', 'level', 'entertainment', 'Acting', 'absolute', 'moron', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'attention', 'funny', 'when', ""'re"", 'kid', 'early', 'teenager', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'something', 'make', 'career', 'especially', 'wrong', 'when', 'life', 'health', 'dignity', 'money.This', 'show', 'kids', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'stupid', 'harmful', 'things', 'then', 'what', 'parents', 'thought', 'heavy', 'metal', 'rap', 'music', 'used', 'do.These', 'guys', 'also', 'give', 'bad', 'name', 'skateboarding', ""n't"", 'been', 'affected', 'enough', 'hip', 'hop', 'influence', 'brand', 'clothing', 'styles.The', 'shows', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'shock', 'awe', 'old', 'fast.It', 'good', 'shows', 'are', 'fading', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'popular', 'were', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
