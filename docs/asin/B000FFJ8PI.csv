988895,A3LZCZJV7WUFPS,B000FFJ8PI,Colonel Saito,"[11, 12]","""ARGH! WHAT KIND OF SERIES IS THIS?"" was my first thought after watching the first few episodes. It's a natural reaction, when putting it into context with the natural progression of the rest of the series. Shakugan no Shana as a series taken in entirity is a decent one, filled with a fair share of romance, character development, action, and comedy, among others. Yet undoubtedly the beginning is misleading. There is a definite horror element and a darker feel to the series at it's entrance. People's souls are being eaten by horrific monsters and their evil-intentioned masters. These monsters, or 'Rinne' in the early episodes are portrayed as demonic, horror-influenced (specifically, the ball of talking heads, along with the psychotic enormous baby). The second episode has a depressing, thoughtful tone (which I personally found intriguing, although many would argue that this is perhaps the most boring episode in the series). If you've stopped on either episode, please understand that neither is representative of the series as a whole.While the series begins with a seemingly dark, gothic and emo environment(the darkness of animation, the use of many night scenes, the costuming, the entirity of the depressing second episode, perhaps Yuuji's, and other characters' emotional struggles over the full series), the series moves further and further away from this sense, and the character development builds all of the characters to being more hopeful, more brave, and more likable. The worst part of the first few episodes is simply that the 'feel' of them seem so out of context. Shakugan at it's core is not a dark series that might be seen in the 'hopeless' vibes of the beginning episodes. While a percentage of the series is spent on battles and contemplation, at others there is classic high school drama, quirky humor (melon bread, anyone?), and connections that bridge the experiences of the main characters to the audience. The WORST part about the first episodes is simply that they do what must be done, familiarize you with the surroundings of Shana's fantasy world (the names, the characters, the city) to set up the entertainment to come (just wait for the final story arc, it's an amazing reward for the wait).**SUMMARY OF MY REVIEW**If you haven't yet watched any further in, Don't look at the seres from a perspective of a few episodes. I nearly quit watching at the beginning, too. give it a chance, at least watch the first half. I'll bet you'll begin to enjoy it just as I did.

There are a lot of things about this anime to like. The animation is really good, the voice acting is good and the characters are interesting. Each episode keeps you wanting to keep watching more. As the relationships between the characters grows stronger the show becomes more captivating. The picture is clear and the colors are vivid.

988898,A17KMHCEI7AI56,B000FFJ8PI,"L. J Lewis ""Miss Amii""","[14, 21]","Shakugan no Shana, which I've been told translates to Shana of the Burning Eyes, is an anime series who's got a decent concept behind it but is almost totally ruined by lousy execution. It's based on a novel series, which should its first English edition later this summer, and it shows. As like the Scrapped Princess, the script writers couldn't figure out a way to convert the information dumping/ world building narration from a novel into the visual language of film. Instead of showing, these first four episode features the characters standing around and talking a lot about the show's fantasy concepts.Shana takes place almost entirely in the real world. Monsters from the crimson world periodically wander in from an alternate dimension to eat people's souls. Flame Hazes, warriors from the crimson world, track down these monsters, kill them, and replace the dead humans with torches, emotion-less copies that eventually fade out as if they never existed at all. Yuji, the main character, witnesses such an event, and learns that he is Torch himself. A very special Torch though. He's like a cracker-jack box, in that he has some sort of treasure inside him, but since its given him an extraordinary lifespan for a Torch, its more valuable than a decoder ring. The Flame Haze he meets, he takes to calling Shana, since she has no name of her own. Shana is a rather unpleasant character as she's rude, dismissive, and cold. Yuji, with his compassion and optimism, serves as a character foil for Shana. I'm betting I could probably guess correctly what turns her characterization will take before this is over.Shana is here to track down a certain Crimson Denizen, the master-mind behind all the monster attacks. Another flaw beside the bad script writing, and predictable characterization, is that Shana has such a sad nemesis. I don't mean sad as in a tragic villain, but one that is just pathetic. It's a rather foppish fellow with a doll fetish and his henchwoman, Marianna, a squeaky-voiced, 5 inch tall rag doll.The single point in Shana's favor is that it looks good. It's an attractive show with a bright and striking color palette, but I question if such a perky design is appropriate for such dark subject matter. However, I'd rather watch something with a good story with less technical merits than something pretty and vacuous.Here's to hoping that the good concepts found here are executed with more grace in its source material.

988901,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B000FFJ8PI,Porcupine,"[14, 21]","A funny phenomena I've noticed lately is that anime fans seem to be forming into groups of a sort. People who like certain types of animes. Shana seems to be most favored by the group of people who like pseudo H-game animes, such as Fate/Stay Night. Not all of this ""type"" of anime comes from those PC games (Shana being one example, I believe it originally comes from Japanese novels) but when they turn into anime they share certain traits that to me define a genre. The trend is to have a show with relaxed pacing and a fairly serious mood, a developing plot that doesn't stagnate, exactly one significant male character, and exactly 4 or 5 girls to keep him company. But I'm not talking about the typical harem anime, that's a different genre entirely (shows like Tenchi Muyo, generally with a silly and idiotic atmosphere).Shana has much more action and fight scenes than the typical H-game anime but I still think it falls under that category. The story appears like it might have a few shortcomings, but the overall production quality of this series is impressively high. This is the kind of show that I like, so I'm giving it a 4 star rating overall, but this anime does feel like the kind of show that is more likely to be enjoyed by certain audiences, rather than being something for everyone.Directing: 3 out of 5 stars. Acceptably average for modern anime.Story: 2 out of 5 stars. I found it kind of far-fetched and uninteresting. Could get better as the series progresses, though.Drawing style: 5 out of 5 stars. Superb. Both the art style of character designer Noizi Ito and the slightly different style used in the anime.Drawing quality: 5 out of 5 stars. About as un-degenerated and consistent episode to episode as one can get with a 24 episode TV series.Animation quality: 5 out of 5 stars. Superb fighting scenes with high quality framerates and an excellent sense of movement and motion.Background drawings: 3 out of 5 stars. Average.Music: 4 out of 5 stars. This is mostly in regards to the BGM, which is composed by the same guy who did the BGM for Zatch Bell, although I think his songs in Shana are not as good as his songs in Zatch Bell (which I would give 5 stars). The ending song for Shana is composed by someone else and is fairly decent. The opening song sucks but I can live with it. It's by I've Sound, a studio that mainly does H-game intro songs, but created by their secondary composer not the main guy so the song is weak.",4,Shana is good if you like this genre of anime,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,2458,"['funny', 'phenomena', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lately', 'anime', 'fans', 'seem', 'be', 'forming', 'groups', 'sort', 'People', 'who', 'like', 'certain', 'types', 'animes', 'Shana', 'be', 'most', 'favored', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'pseudo', 'H-game', 'animes', 'such', 'Fate/Stay', 'Night', 'Not', 'type', 'anime', 'PC', 'games', 'Shana', 'being', 'one', 'example', 'believe', 'originally', 'Japanese', 'novels', 'when', 'turn', 'anime', 'share', 'certain', 'traits', 'define', 'genre', 'trend', 'have', 'show', 'relaxed', 'pacing', 'fairly', 'serious', 'mood', 'developing', 'plot', ""n't"", 'stagnate', 'exactly', 'one', 'significant', 'male', 'character', 'exactly', '4', '5', 'girls', 'keep', 'company', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'typical', 'harem', 'anime', 'different', 'genre', 'entirely', 'shows', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'generally', 'silly', 'idiotic', 'atmosphere', '.Shana', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'typical', 'H-game', 'anime', 'still', 'think', 'category', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'few', 'shortcomings', 'overall', 'production', 'quality', 'series', 'impressively', 'high', 'kind', 'show', 'like', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'overall', 'anime', 'feel', 'kind', 'show', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'certain', 'audiences', 'rather', 'being', 'something', 'everyone.Directing', '3', '5', 'stars', 'Acceptably', 'average', 'modern', 'anime.Story', '2', '5', 'stars', 'found', 'kind', 'far-fetched', 'uninteresting', 'Could', 'get', 'better', 'series', 'though.Drawing', 'style', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Superb', 'art', 'style', 'character', 'designer', 'Noizi', 'Ito', 'slightly', 'different', 'style', 'used', 'anime.Drawing', 'quality', '5', '5', 'stars', 'un-degenerated', 'consistent', 'episode', 'episode', 'one', 'can', 'get', '24', 'episode', 'TV', 'series.Animation', 'quality', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Superb', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'high', 'quality', 'framerates', 'excellent', 'sense', 'movement', 'motion.Background', 'drawings', '3', '5', 'stars', 'Average.Music', '4', '5', 'stars', 'mostly', 'regards', 'BGM', 'composed', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'BGM', 'Zatch', 'Bell', 'think', 'songs', 'Shana', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'songs', 'Zatch', 'Bell', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'ending', 'song', 'Shana', 'composed', 'someone', 'else', 'fairly', 'decent', 'opening', 'song', 'sucks', 'can', 'live', ""'ve"", 'Sound', 'studio', 'mainly', 'H-game', 'intro', 'songs', 'created', 'secondary', 'composer', 'not', 'main', 'guy', 'song', 'weak']",Shana 1 - The Torch Bearer
988902,A37GX213HM88DR,B000FFJ8PI,"R ""sir_rob79""","[10, 11]","First, I was intrigued by the manga, which I picked up and read first. Yes, it had a lot of backstory to explain. But I was still drawn to it, and found it very interesting. I have heard of this series of being called a ripoff of Bleach. There are about two similarities in premise, and there the resemblance ends. However, if I were to compare it to Bleach, for those of you familiar (if not, you have homework)... If it were an alternate take, it would be as if the story only focused on Rukia and Ichigo, without a stupid teddy bear named Kon. &lt;Gasp!> Unlike Bleach, most villains in this series really do not last long, so if one of them happens to be slightly annoying for a while, hey... you don't have long to wait 'till he's toast :)Initially, I was turned off from watching this series right away, because of the uninspiring other reviews I read posted on Amazon. I am horribly, horribly sad that I had ever paid them any attention. Since then, I have already watched all 24 episodes of the first season. I can't wait until the movie is released on dvd, as well as the second season starting next year.First of all, the storyline has a good amount of background that takes a bit to explain. All moderately epic stories have the same problem to deal with: How do you explain a ton of back story to an audience while still maintaining interest? Animes typically make one of two choices: A.) Jump into the storyline right away, while the viewer is constantly wondering ""what the hell is going on, and why do I care..."" or, B.) Explain everything all at once, and hope the audience isn't asleep by the time the story actually begins.I think that this series did a good job with this. Yes, the first two episodes are basically there to set the scene. However, when the series gets rolling, it really gets rolling. I watched episodes 7 through 21 in one gulp, only stopping to go to sleep. The next day I finished episodes 22-24. It's a brilliant show, and I really just can't get enough. It's about a girl with a big sword... (what's not to love?)... but also, it's about a boy and a girl who learn more about themselves through the actions of the other. It's about people finding out if they are special or worthless, and despite otherwise circumstances, that they are not ""just"" anything, but more.More people should give this show a chance, it certainly deserves it. And to all you reviewers out there, how about you watch more than four episodes before you start saying anything bad? I can't remember ever watching the first four episodes of anything and coming to a good decision. To tell the truth, when I first read Naruto and Bleach, I thought that they were merely mediocre. 365 chapters later of Naruto, 286 later of Bleach, hundreds of combined episodes.... Well, needless to say, they are two of my favorites.",5,Don't let the other reviews fool you...,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2828,"['First', 'was', 'intrigued', 'manga', 'picked', 'up', 'read', 'first', 'Yes', 'had', 'lot', 'backstory', 'explain', 'was', 'still', 'drawn', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'have', 'heard', 'series', 'being', 'called', 'ripoff', 'Bleach', 'are', 'two', 'similarities', 'premise', 'there', 'resemblance', 'However', 'were', 'compare', 'Bleach', 'familiar', 'not', 'have', 'homework', 'were', 'alternate', 'take', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'only', 'focused', 'Rukia', 'Ichigo', 'stupid', 'teddy', 'bear', 'named', 'Kon', 'lt', 'Gasp', '>', 'Bleach', 'most', 'villains', 'series', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'so', 'one', 'be', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'while', 'hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'wait', ""'till"", 'toast', 'Initially', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'watching', 'series', 'right', 'away', 'uninspiring', 'other', 'reviews', 'read', 'posted', 'Amazon', 'am', 'horribly', 'horribly', 'sad', 'had', 'ever', 'paid', 'attention', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'watched', '24', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'released', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'starting', 'next', 'year.First', 'storyline', 'good', 'amount', 'background', 'bit', 'explain', 'moderately', 'epic', 'stories', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'deal', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'ton', 'back', 'story', 'audience', 'still', 'maintaining', 'interest', 'Animes', 'typically', 'make', 'one', 'two', 'choices', 'Jump', 'storyline', 'right', 'away', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'why', 'do', 'care', 'B', 'Explain', 'everything', 'once', 'hope', 'audience', ""n't"", 'asleep', 'time', 'story', 'actually', 'begins.I', 'think', 'series', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Yes', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'basically', 'there', 'set', 'scene', 'However', 'when', 'series', 'rolling', 'really', 'rolling', 'watched', 'episodes', '7', '21', 'one', 'gulp', 'only', 'stopping', 'go', 'sleep', 'next', 'day', 'finished', 'episodes', '22-24', 'brilliant', 'show', 'really', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'girl', 'big', 'sword', 'what', 'not', 'love', 'also', 'boy', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'actions', 'other', 'people', 'finding', 'out', 'are', 'special', 'worthless', 'otherwise', 'circumstances', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'anything', 'more.More', 'people', 'should', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'certainly', 'reviewers', 'there', 'how', 'watch', 'more', 'four', 'episodes', 'start', 'saying', 'anything', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'anything', 'coming', 'good', 'decision', 'tell', 'truth', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'Naruto', 'Bleach', 'thought', 'were', 'merely', 'mediocre', '365', 'chapters', 'later', 'Naruto', '286', 'later', 'Bleach', 'hundreds', 'combined', 'episodes', 'Well', 'needless', 'say', 'are', 'two', 'favorites']",Shana 1 - The Torch Bearer

Much to Yuji's horror, the girl (who he later names Shana), reveals that HE is a torch and only has a short time to live until he disappears and is forgotten by everyone he ever knew!It's hard to take a show seriously when it starts out with a 5-story man and woman eating baby walking the city streets. I mean, really how goofy can you get? And then when you see the true form of  the monster, a talking child's doll, it takes down the intensity factor a bit. Add to that, the main bad guy has a doll fetish and talks to them and caresses them in a pretty disturbing fashion. Can there be any human drama, can you take this anime seriously after this setup? It's almost as bad as Serial Experiments Lain when God turns out to be a fruity looking guy with a toga hovering around him. Otaku whose taste can be satisfied with any girl holding a sword will probably like this show, but it just didn't work for me. Even in the most emotional bits when Yuji has to face the knowledge of his true existence, or even more touching, when he has to see the Torch of a girl he knew be extinguished, we always cut to a scene of the weirdo holding a  doll and whispering sweet-nothings in its ear as the doll declares its love in a baby girl voice.  It probably would have been a good show if the villain design would have been handled better.",2,DOLL FONDLING VILLAIN,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,2281,"['high', 'school', 'student', 'Yuji', 'Sakai', 'making', 'way', 'home', 'school', 'street', 'suddenly', 'sealed', 'off', 'strange', 'barrier', 'busy', 'crowds', 'freezing', 'place', 'gigantic', 'baby', 'walks', 'eating', 'essences', 'much', 'delight', 'quivering', 'ball', 'distorted', 'human', 'heads', 'Yuji', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'move', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'two', 'monsters', 'notice', 'call', 'Mystes', 'are', 'eat', 'when', 'red-haired', 'girl', 'wielding', 'sword', 'rescue', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'two', 'horrors', 'Yuji', 'girl', 'only', 'reply', 'call', 'Scum', 'unknown', 'Yuji', 'no', 'longer', 'human', 'Beings', 'Crimson', 'World', 'calling', 'Denizens', 'regularly', 'send', 'servants', 'Earth', 'harvest', 'human', 'beings', 'girl', 'Flame', 'Haze', 'defeat', 'Denizens', 'also', 'create', 'Torches', 'temporary', 'copies', 'have', 'been', 'eaten', 'Much', 'Yuji', 'horror', 'girl', 'who', 'later', 'names', 'Shana', 'HE', 'torch', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'forgotten', 'everyone', 'ever', 'knew', 'hard', 'take', 'show', 'seriously', 'when', 'out', '5-story', 'man', 'woman', 'eating', 'baby', 'walking', 'city', 'streets', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'goofy', 'can', 'get', 'then', 'when', 'see', 'true', 'form', 'monster', 'talking', 'child', 'doll', 'down', 'intensity', 'factor', 'bit', 'Add', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'doll', 'fetish', 'talks', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'fashion', 'Can', 'there', 'be', 'human', 'drama', 'can', 'take', 'anime', 'seriously', 'setup', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'when', 'God', 'out', 'be', 'fruity', 'looking', 'guy', 'toga', 'hovering', 'Otaku', 'taste', 'can', 'be', 'satisfied', 'girl', 'holding', 'sword', 'will', 'probably', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Even', 'most', 'emotional', 'bits', 'when', 'Yuji', 'face', 'knowledge', 'true', 'existence', 'even', 'more', 'touching', 'when', 'see', 'Torch', 'girl', 'knew', 'be', 'extinguished', 'always', 'cut', 'scene', 'weirdo', 'holding', 'doll', 'whispering', 'sweet-nothings', 'ear', 'doll', 'love', 'baby', 'girl', 'voice', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'show', 'villain', 'design', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better']",Shana 1 - The Torch Bearer
