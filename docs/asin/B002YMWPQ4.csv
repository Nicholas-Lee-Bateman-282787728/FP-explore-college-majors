The whole cast performance is something to look out for and specially, Robin Penn as Pippa Lee, throughout the film, her presence was strong that you are forced to see everything through Pippa's eyes and how it is to be in her sandals. Pippa is a housewife, a mother and just another ordinary woman, but if you think this is just another chick flick of a 'couple in love' tale, then you couldn't be more wrong as this film has a lot more to offer.  What made Penn's presence more attractive was a wonderful performance by Keanu Reeves. The rest of the cast deliver very neat performances and it doesn't take an effort to relate to the characters, and for you to feel as if Pippa is just your neighbour or a friend who is making you, the viewer, a part of her journey.

1299285,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002YMWPQ4,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[20, 22]","In a male-dominated industry like Hollywood, it is refreshing once in a while to watch a movie in which the main character is a woman (Robin Wright). It is additionally rewarding - a bonus, if you will -- if the director is also a woman (Rebecca Miller, who wrote the story). The result, ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" is satisfying and remarkable. This film touches you and stays with you.The story is about Pippa Sarkissian (Wright) - who would later become Pippa Lee --, an attractive woman with a troubled past, reaching middle age, who is trying to get her life together. Her mother Suky (the always dependable Maria Bello) was moody and addicted to antidepressants, and was repulsed by Pippa when she was born, because she was hairy. However, this situation improved throughout the years, and Suky got very attached to Pippa. Unfortunately, her mother's problems persisted, and Pippa eventually had to leave home. After some time living carelessly by herself, she finds Herb Lee (Alan Arkin), a man thirty years her senior, who happens to be a successful publisher. They get married and life appears to be good for everyone. That is, until Pippa's past begins haunting her -- a situation that is worsened by her current problems.This is a real life drama, spiked with humor, especially provided by Wynona Ryder, in a surprising supporting role. It examines a woman's life that ""keeps swinging back and forth from generation to generation, getting it wrong."" Robin Wright shines as Pippa Lee, and Arkin as her husband. The magnificent cast also includes Blake Lively (as Pippa in her younger years) Monica Bellucci, Julianne Moore, Shirley Knight, and Keanu Reeves. The Blu-ray edition includes commentaries by Wright and Miller, and interviews with Wright, Arkin, and Lively.

1299286,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B002YMWPQ4,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is the kind of film that attracts big name actors anxious to do some REAL acting. Working for less than scale, shooting on a quicker schedule, a lower budget, the film gets made--and even if it doesn't kill at the box office, due to lack of promotion, and also because on a lower budget, the film makers were freed from the constraints of commercial consideration, it is a success if it breaks even, and everyone involved knows that they have participated in a top shelf, quality production. TPLOPL is a text book example of just such a project. On its own terms, it was hugely successful--and I think it was a much better film than 99% of the dreck that Hollywood usually foists on an easily duped public. I (not so easily duped, I assure you) really enjoyed it.Pippa Lee (Robin Wright) is a suburban wife married to a much older man. Herb (Alan Arkin) is successful as an editor and a book publisher, so perhaps she is a bit of the trophy wife. When he moves them to a retirement community she falls apart--starts sleep walking. Her life starts to flash before her, and we find that she was not always the boring house wife she seems to be. Her mother was addicted to prescription dexadrine, and her mother's violent mood swings forced the young Pippa (Blake Lively) to leave home at a tender age. First she tries to stay with her aunt, but Kat (Julianne Moore), her aunt's room mate/lover makes this living arrangement untenable. A series of misadventures brings her to the attention of Herb. She marries Herb, but not without acquiring a ton of guilt about the previous wife she has replaced. As our story opens, she has settled into her life without complaint, but something inside won't let her sleep soundly. Then there's Chris (Keanu Reeves)--a maladjusted young man who has had to move back in with his mother at the retirement community and take a job as a clerk at the local market.You get the idea, the gist of it. With all the baggage the characters carry, there is an opportunity for some real ACTING. Rebecca Miller wrote the book and screenplay, and is also directing. She looks great wearing all three hats.-----------------Pippa Lee: What made you lose your faith?Chris Nadeau: I just stopped believing God was a mystery you could nail down with one book.=============It is a great vehicle for Robin Wright, who was the Princess Bride, Buttercup, in that classic 1987 fairy tale deconstruction/spoof. Since then she has been another kind of princess--the wife to bad boy/serious thespian and a director in his own right, Sean Penn. That kept her hands full, but she did manage to keep her foot in the door with the occasional job. She played his girlfriend in 1998's Hurlyburly, and did a fabulous job in the independent film Sorry, Haters, which (Sorry, Sorry Haters) was not very good, but through no fault of Robin, who acted her tail off.Alan Arkin, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Little Miss Sunshine (2006) as the foul mouthed, but with a tender heart, smack shooting Grandpa Edwin Hoover, was swell as Herb. At first Arkin didn't want to play the part, as he was a much less sympathetic character than Grandpa Hoover, but in the context of the film, Herb is not such a bad guy--once you get to know him.Perhaps you've seen Blake Lively on ""Gossip Girl""  where she is Serena van der Woodsen (87 episodes, 2007-2011). If her performance in TPLOPL is any indication, we are going to be seeing a lot more of her.Winona Ryder is kind of a mess here, but that is what the part called for. Did you see her as The Psychologist in 2004's The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (uncredited)? Hmmmm. Maybe that is the vibe she gives off nowadays, and she is just making lemonade--or else you could say that she is easing herself into a new career as a character actor?Julianne Moore is not the ing&eacute;nue we saw in Boogie Nights (1997) as Amber Waves, either, but she was quite effective in her small but pivotal role as Pippa's aunt's lover. I can imagine Rebecca Miller or Robin Wright asking her to play the role, and she responds with the same clicking-her-tongue-on-her-teeth gesture as Kat does oh, so well in TPLOPL. If she keeps on with roles like this or the one she does in The Kids Are All Right she is going to be banned from Meow Mix. Bad girl friend. Bad. If you want to see her in a great film check out the oh, tho thavage Savage Grace. You've been warned.The Bottom Line is that if you like independent films with great acting and complex characters with many layers you will enjoy The Private Lives of Pippa Lee. It is a rare chance to see at least four beautiful women--Ryder, Moore, Lively, and Wright--three who have only improved with age, and one lively up-and-commer. Ryder, Moore, Lively, and Wright.--------------Sam Shapiro: [beginning of film: toasting Herb at dinner party] I have known Pippa Lee for 25 years and I think that I will really never know her. She is a mystery... an enigma... giving, caring, beautiful, intelligent... the very icon of an artist's wife.===========New York, I Love You(2009) (as Robin Wright Penn) Robin Wright was Anna; Blake

(Yes, my hand is raised proudly.)  Might as well make (another) movie about it, with the latest offering being THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE, a quirky, bittersweet film that reminds us it's never too late to be happy--and that Robin Wright (or was she Robert Wright Penn when she made this?) is still fine eye candy.Fortysomething Pippa Lee is ambivalent--about her much-older husband (Alan Arkin), her kids, her life.  And she can't seem to control bouts of sleepwalking that always make her delightfully vulnerable; it's her self-conscious crying out for Pippa to re-examine her life and get back in the game.  Thus Pippa goes on a new journey of self-discovery, augmented by flashbacks of a most tumultuous and uninhibited life (her younger self is played by an ebullient Blake Lively).  The flashbacks are extraordinarily entertaining, dominated by Arkin's character's hopeless infidelity, along with a most interesting aunt (Julianne Moore).  The present storyline is less so, in spite of Wright's solid performance, as best friend Sandra (Wynona Ryder) is utterly annoying, and love interest Chris (Keanu Reeves) is as wooden as the desk my PC rests on.Any weaknesses aside, THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE is still a fine tale of midlife crisis and one more soul saved.

1299291,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B002YMWPQ4,Douglas King,"[1, 1]","If ever an actress was born to play a role, Robin Wright was born to play the titular character in ""The Privates Lives of Pippa Lee"". Wright is a beautiful woman and marvelous actress whose career has perhaps been overshadowed by her marriage to volatile, high-profile actor Sean Penn. So Wright is perfect to play Pippa Lee, a devoted wife and mother whose role as caretaker has overshadowed her own needs and desires.One of the central premises of the film is that people often lead multiple ""lives"" in one lifetime. As the film begins, the audience sees Pippa as a dutiful, middle aged woman who has just moved into a retirement community for the sake of her much older husband. This transition begins causing rifts in both Pippa's marriage and mental state, and so as Pippa begins to look back on her life, the audience sees that she was not always the conservative, supportive woman she is now. The film shows Pippa's childhood with her minister father and erratic, pill-addicted mother, her time spent as a teenager living with her compassionate aunt and her wild, magnetic female lover, her rootless, bohemian young adulthood, and finally, her romance with the much older man who she eventually marries and has children with. The film cuts back and forth between Pippa's current life, which seems to be eroding, and her previous ""lives,"" to show that, perhaps, Pippa is ready for her next metamorphosis.Although a far from perfect film, any bumps or clumsiness in the script are easily made up for by the film's inspired casting and great performances. Regarding the characters in Pippa's current life, Robin Wright gives a pitch-perfect, subtle, and at turns dramatic and comic performance as Pippa Lee; Alan Arkin is charming as her warm but selfish husband; Winona Ryder gives a comic supporting performance as Pippa's histrionic, back-stabbing friend; and Keanu Reeves inhabits his sullen but good-hearted character well. Regarding the characters who make up Pippa's bumpy past, Blake Livey does just fine playing the youthful, lost Pippa; Maria Bello brings gravitas to her portrayal as Pippa's unstable mother; Julianne Moore's considerable acting chops allow her to morph perfectly into the role of Pippa's aunt's charismatic lover; and Monica Belluci brings just the right combination of strength and torment to the role of Pippa's husband's first wife.",4,Inspired Casting,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2368,"['ever', 'actress', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'titular', 'character', 'Privates', 'Lives', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'Wright', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'career', 'perhaps', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'marriage', 'volatile', 'high-profile', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'So', 'Wright', 'perfect', 'play', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'devoted', 'wife', 'mother', 'role', 'caretaker', 'overshadowed', 'own', 'needs', 'desires.One', 'central', 'premises', 'film', 'people', 'often', 'lead', 'multiple', 'lives', 'one', 'lifetime', 'film', 'audience', 'Pippa', 'dutiful', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'retirement', 'community', 'sake', 'much', 'older', 'husband', 'transition', 'causing', 'rifts', 'Pippa', 'marriage', 'mental', 'state', 'so', 'Pippa', 'look', 'back', 'life', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'conservative', 'supportive', 'woman', 'now', 'film', 'Pippa', 'childhood', 'minister', 'father', 'erratic', 'pill-addicted', 'mother', 'time', 'spent', 'teenager', 'living', 'compassionate', 'aunt', 'wild', 'magnetic', 'female', 'lover', 'rootless', 'bohemian', 'young', 'adulthood', 'finally', 'romance', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'eventually', 'marries', 'children', 'film', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'Pippa', 'current', 'life', 'be', 'eroding', 'previous', 'lives', 'show', 'perhaps', 'Pippa', 'ready', 'next', 'metamorphosis.Although', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'bumps', 'clumsiness', 'script', 'are', 'easily', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'inspired', 'casting', 'great', 'performances', 'Regarding', 'characters', 'Pippa', 'current', 'life', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'pitch-perfect', 'subtle', 'turns', 'dramatic', 'comic', 'performance', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'charming', 'warm', 'selfish', 'husband', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'comic', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Pippa', 'histrionic', 'back-stabbing', 'friend', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'sullen', 'good-hearted', 'character', 'well', 'Regarding', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Pippa', 'bumpy', 'past', 'Blake', 'Livey', 'just', 'fine', 'playing', 'youthful', 'lost', 'Pippa', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'gravitas', 'portrayal', 'Pippa', 'unstable', 'mother', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'considerable', 'acting', 'chops', 'allow', 'morph', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Pippa', 'aunt', 'charismatic', 'lover', 'Monica', 'Belluci', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'strength', 'torment', 'role', 'Pippa', 'husband', 'first', 'wife']",The Private Lives of Pippa Lee

1299293,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002YMWPQ4,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE are nothing more than a retrospective of how a bored mother and wife of an aging man longs for the unfulfilled passion of youth.  Writer/Director Rebecca Miller ('Proof', 'Personal Velocity', 'The Ballad of Jack and Rose') has unraveled a life grown stale and offers her main character a way out. The film is solid though not all that original but it is saved by some fine work by lead actress Robin Wright Penn.Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn) is a frustrated wife of aging Herb Lee (Alan Arkin) and feels her life slipping away from her when  Herb moves them out of Manhattan to a retirement community. Herb is much older than Pippa and their children are now grown and have poor communication with their parents. What happens in the film is a series of flashbacks to her childhood, her drug-tossed teenage years and how she coped with her wholly dysfunctional mother (Maria Bello), keeping her under her thumb until she launches into a life of discovery through her aunt (Robin  Weigart) and partner (Julianne Moore), confusing her to the point that she ultimately marries the established publisher, Herb, a man who lacked passion, and now is stuck in a tedious life that makes her have nightmares and sleepwalk. Her only act of escape is an affair with the loner son of a next-door neighbor Chris (Keanu Reeves).  As Herb dies Pippa learns the meaning of motherhood at last and begins to sense life re-blooming - if a bit late.The story is bit lopsided and with time the audience begins to feel the frustration of those around Pippa instead of feeling the frustration of Pippa.  But the cast , especially Robin Wright Penn, is exemplary and in the end the film is fairly entertaining.

So we witness the seventies till she meets the man of her life, a brilliant publisher who is progressively falling into an accelerated decrepitude. On the other hand, her two sons ignore her.So we have a mature woman who has been incapable to shine by her own. Orphan of love and affection, she will find at last an exit door: her last vacations, or the light at the end of the tunnel.Let's say it at once: the plot suffers of certain lethargic moments; the memories and the rhythmic pulse drives us into a sort of placebo that paralyzes the narrative dynamic.

It left me a little puzzled, but with an essentially positive feeling. My reservations were mainly based on a technicality (really?), as follows: we follow the unspectacular life of a woman from her childhood to her middle ages (40s maybe?). The whole thing is set somewhere in the NE of the US, maybe all of it in Connecticut, I am not sure. The woman is played by 3 actresses: a girl for childhood (with a drug addict hysteric played by a great Maria Bello as her mother), a young woman as her incarnation as a wild young woman (the actress seems to be well known, but I did not know her), and then Robin Hood (Wright Penn?) or whatever her name is as the middle life version of Pippa. We get bits and pieces of Pippa's life from various stages of her life. From childhood in a 'dysfunctional family' to young adulthood as a dysfunctional young adult to a dysfunctional marriage with a much older man in her mid-life period. And what troubled me is this: the woman's 3 incarnations look nothing like similar to each other. This might work if there is a straightforward narrative, but if the story jumps back and forth, wouldn't one think that some probability in casting might be useful? The director apparently did not think so.The movie has a prominent cast, with a superhysterical Wynona Ryder as marriage breaking adulteress snatching Wright's hubby Alan Arkin (you were just waiting for me to go to my grave! I never heard a better excuse for late life infidelity) and a super-convincing convenience store manager Keanu Reeves as midlife crisis-ridden wife's revengeful love interest.

The movie navigates the liberation of Pippa (confused and frustrated Robin Wright Penn) and has it's moments, though it was depressing and predictable to me.So, as most adults can relate in some manner to being trapped in a relationship....then find ourselves wondering how we got to this place? The movie draws on this commonality with a dual presentation of young Pippa and present day Pippa....(what a strange name?) Blake Lively does a fair job of playing the youthful Pippa, but there were moments when i was confused with what contribution, and meaning some of the characters had to the overall story...my sister confessed she was also finding it difficult to attach significance and relationship status to some of the actors.So...Pippa's self reflection through herky jerky glimpses of her past---are a cinematic thrill of finding the puzzle pieces to Penn's character's present day existence. I do believe (IMHO) it is simply a modern day visualization of the imprisoned life of an unactualized woman. In the big picture, women, whose roles have been dynamically changing for decades...we have this passenger of life, Pippa who is stumbling along seeing the light in still frames of her memories.

Alan Arkin is a cad and after seeing all the eddies and currents that Pippa's lifeboat sailed through, i got the distinct impression of cardboard cutouts dreaming of becoming animated, infused with life. Something akin to ""The Stepford Wife"" seeking to be a ""Desperate Housewife"" with their joyous abandon and central life characters.My sister loved this movie, going on about Keanua Reeves as the fantasy, fairy tale ending for a stale, invalid marriage. Pippa finds redemption through a much younger, hunkier, sensitive guy...ahem, is that all there is to life? Cinematography was good, acting was spot on, but the story has been told too many times.

Most often, we might think it is luck that has brought us this far. And, when we found our life, were we happy, was this the life we really wanted or did we settle for this safer life of ours?Pippa Lee, played by Robin Wright is fifty. Her husband, Alan Arkin, is thirty years older. They have moved from New York City to a retirement community in Connecticut. This is presumably to make life easier for both of them. However, Pippa is not happy, she does not have much to do now and we wonder, who made this decision to move?  She had met her husband years ago when she was at the end of her wild drug, hippie stage and he had saved her. They had two children and were happy. Or were they? Pippa starts to sleep walk, she is filled with tension and stress her therapist tells her- she needs a hobby. She takes up pottery and is kicked out of class for calling the instructor names. She is unsettled and her past life catches up with her. Her mother who was obsessed with her as well as obsessed with the Dexedrine she was taking, her life with her aunt after she ran away from home, and the life she has now.  She uncovers an interesting relationship of her husbands and finds one for herself.  Pippa is on her way to finding her life.This film written and directed by Rebecca Miller is filled with remarkable characters and actors ""Zoe Kazan as Pippa's daughter, Grace, a headstrong photojournalist; Robin Wright as Pippa's kindhearted lesbian aunt Trish; and Julianne Moore as Trish's ferocious lover Kat, who enlists Pippa to pose with another woman for sadomasochist photos.

Along this journey we jump back and forth in her time line as we see the different lives she has led. Mario Bello competently played her drug addled mother, Alan Arkin her much older husband, with some interesting short roles from Monica Belucci and Winona Ryder. The criticism I have read regarding confusion and casting choices to play the same person I can see having some validity, but I enjoyed the challenge of figuring things out while watching this. Keanu is once again picked to play a non-emotional role and he does it fine. The Blu quality is standard at times, above average in others. The vehicle motion scenes are difficult to figure out though, as they chose to film with the windows rolled up in each scene so the resulting reflections are always blurring the scenes - really the only shortcoming of the Blu quality. The DTS gets used infrequently and the special feature of interviews from a screening lasts only a few minutes and is forgettable. The commentary was adequate but as admitted by Wright - a little awkward to do at times.You would be getting this for the performances alone, but I do not think there would be any significant disappointment in the BD either.

1299308,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002YMWPQ4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is about the life of Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn), devoted wife married to a successful publisher Herb Lee (Alan Arkin). When her husband (30 years older than Pippa) decides to move from New York to a suburban retirement community, she slowly heads toward a nervous breakdown, unbeknown to other family members. The 98-minute film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller (""The Ballad of Jack and Rose""), adapted from her own book of the same title which I have not read.Meet 50-year-old Pippa Lee, adored by everyone, a ""mystery"" and ""enigma."" As the main story unfolds describing Pippa's erratic behaviors in her new home, she recounts her days as a young woman Pippa Sarkissian, told in flashbacks, up to the moment she meets and marries Herb. The flashbacks consist of episodes about her emotionally unstable mother, her running away from home, her taking ""photos"" at her aunt's home, and so on. Through the repeated flashbacks we are to know more about the life of Pippa, and in the present time she meets inscrutable 35-year-old Chris (Keanu Reeves), with whom she develops a romantic attachment.The greatest asset of the film is Robin Wright Penn's strong performance as Pippa, without which the film might have been a mess. The impressive cast also includes Alan Arkin, Keanu Reeves, Julianne Moore, Maria Bello, Monica Bellucci, Wynona Ryder and Blake Lively as young Pippa, and they all did a fine job.Most episodes (of flashbacks and the main plot alike) are well-written and believable, but presented as a whole, they don't add up to much. So who is Pippa Lee? What does she want to do? I tried to like the film and Pippa (and I like Robin Wright Penn), but sorry, I couldn't bring myself to get interested in her story. Too frequent flashbacks of her life disrupt the narrative, affecting character development. Voiceovers are added when Robin Wright Penn's superb acting tells you everything. Given the subject matter of ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" the anecdotal nature of the narrative is understandable, but characters are too many, and some events here are too melodramatic, sometimes too good to be true.Rebecca Miller's film has a unique charm of its own, with leisured pace and accurate eye for details, as well as its quirky sense of humor. Though it includes serious issues, the film itself is never too serious. ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is not everyone's taste, but it is worth a look for the impressive acting from the cast.",3,"Strong Performaces All Around, ""Pippa Lee"" Needs a Better Narrative",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2497,"['Private', 'Lives', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'life', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'devoted', 'wife', 'married', 'successful', 'publisher', 'Herb', 'Lee', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'When', 'husband', '30', 'years', 'older', 'Pippa', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'suburban', 'retirement', 'community', 'slowly', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'unbeknown', 'other', 'family', 'members', '98-minute', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Rebecca', 'Miller', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'adapted', 'own', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'have', 'not', 'read.Meet', '50-year-old', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'adored', 'everyone', 'mystery', 'enigma', 'main', 'story', 'unfolds', 'describing', 'Pippa', 'erratic', 'behaviors', 'new', 'home', 'days', 'young', 'woman', 'Pippa', 'Sarkissian', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'up', 'moment', 'marries', 'Herb', 'flashbacks', 'consist', 'episodes', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'mother', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'taking', 'photos', 'aunt', 'home', 'so', 'repeated', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'know', 'more', 'life', 'Pippa', 'present', 'time', 'inscrutable', '35-year-old', 'Chris', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'whom', 'romantic', 'attachment.The', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'strong', 'performance', 'Pippa', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mess', 'impressive', 'cast', 'also', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'young', 'Pippa', 'did', 'fine', 'job.Most', 'episodes', 'flashbacks', 'main', 'plot', 'are', 'well-written', 'believable', 'presented', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'who', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'What', 'want', 'do', 'tried', 'like', 'film', 'Pippa', 'like', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'get', 'interested', 'story', 'Too', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'life', 'disrupt', 'narrative', 'affecting', 'character', 'development', 'Voiceovers', 'are', 'added', 'when', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'superb', 'acting', 'tells', 'everything', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'anecdotal', 'nature', 'narrative', 'understandable', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'events', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'sometimes', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.Rebecca', 'Miller', 'film', 'unique', 'charm', 'own', 'leisured', 'pace', 'accurate', 'eye', 'details', 'as', 'well', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'serious', 'issues', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'serious', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'look', 'impressive', 'acting', 'cast']",The Private Lives of Pippa Lee
1299309,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002YMWPQ4,Z Hayes,"[18, 22]","My husband picked up this DVD on a whim, thinking I might like it, and he was right! ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is a thoughtful, leisurely-paced drama about a woman who though anchored in a stable relationship in the present, is haunted by her turbulent past. Robin Wright Penn plays Pippa Lee, a sort of prim and proper wife to an aging yet indomitable older man, Herb (Alan Arkin). The couple have recently moved to a retirement community, though Herb, who has already suffered previous heart attacks, refuses to buckle down and lead a quiet life. Pippa who is 30 years younger than Herb, tries her utmost to take care of her husband, despite his protestations and suffers from exhaustion, finding herself spacing out, binge eating in the middle of the night (but having no recollections of it later), and finds herself experiencing flashback moments of her younger days.The movie flows well between the past and the present. We see baby Pippa being initially shunned by her mother Suky (Maria Bello) for being overly hairy as an infant, and how this relationship changes over time. As Pippa grows (the teenage Pippa is played by Gossip Girl's Blake Lively), a close relationship forms between Suky and her daughter, but Suky's own deteriorating mental health and over-dependence on anti-depressants causes a friction in their relationship. Pippa runs away, meeting interesting characters along the way - photographer (Julianne Moore), successful publisher Herb (Arkin),co-dependent friend (Winona Ryder in a great supporting role), and a store clerk (Keanu Reeves). Having settled down to a sedate married life, Pippa ponders her life's purpose, and some startling revelations throw her scheduled life off-balance.Robin Wright delivers a finely nuanced performance, and the excellent supporting cast make this movie an above average viewing experience. There is a great deal of character development, insights, and self-introspection here - a woman who has been so driven to care for others (husband, son, daughter), that she has lost her own identity along the way, choosing to 'settle' instead. Will Pippa Lee set herself free? The movie credibly addresses this question and the compelling performances by the lead actress and supporting cast make it a worthwhile watch.",5,Will Pippa Lee set herself free?,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2281,"['husband', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'whim', 'thinking', 'might', 'like', 'was', 'right', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'thoughtful', 'leisurely-paced', 'drama', 'woman', 'who', 'anchored', 'stable', 'relationship', 'present', 'haunted', 'turbulent', 'past', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'sort', 'prim', 'proper', 'wife', 'aging', 'yet', 'indomitable', 'older', 'man', 'Herb', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'couple', 'have', 'recently', 'moved', 'retirement', 'community', 'Herb', 'who', 'already', 'suffered', 'previous', 'heart', 'attacks', 'buckle', 'down', 'lead', 'quiet', 'life', 'Pippa', 'who', '30', 'years', 'younger', 'Herb', 'utmost', 'take', 'care', 'husband', 'protestations', 'suffers', 'exhaustion', 'finding', 'spacing', 'out', 'binge', 'eating', 'middle', 'night', 'having', 'recollections', 'later', 'experiencing', 'flashback', 'moments', 'younger', 'days.The', 'movie', 'well', 'past', 'present', 'see', 'baby', 'Pippa', 'being', 'initially', 'shunned', 'mother', 'Suky', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'being', 'overly', 'hairy', 'infant', 'how', 'relationship', 'time', 'Pippa', 'teenage', 'Pippa', 'played', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'Blake', 'Lively', 'close', 'relationship', 'forms', 'Suky', 'daughter', 'Suky', 'own', 'deteriorating', 'mental', 'health', 'over-dependence', 'anti-depressants', 'causes', 'friction', 'relationship', 'Pippa', 'away', 'meeting', 'interesting', 'characters', 'way', 'photographer', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'successful', 'publisher', 'Herb', 'Arkin', 'co-dependent', 'friend', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'store', 'clerk', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Having', 'settled', 'down', 'sedate', 'married', 'life', 'Pippa', 'life', 'purpose', 'startling', 'revelations', 'throw', 'scheduled', 'life', 'off-balance.Robin', 'Wright', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'viewing', 'experience', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'insights', 'self-introspection', 'here', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'driven', 'care', 'others', 'husband', 'son', 'daughter', 'lost', 'own', 'identity', 'way', 'choosing', ""'settle"", 'instead', 'Will', 'Pippa', 'Lee', 'set', 'free', 'movie', 'credibly', 'question', 'compelling', 'performances', 'lead', 'actress', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",The Private Lives of Pippa Lee
