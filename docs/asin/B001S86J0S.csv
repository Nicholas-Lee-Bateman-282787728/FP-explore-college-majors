I thought it was pretty awesome. The only thing that wasn't that great was the episode on doplphins. Even that it was interesting to see how many people are just so crazy in love with them that they forget they are wild animals. The war on porn was a good one. Some women really think that porn objectifies women. Well, I'm a woman and I disagree. I think it's two (or more at times) consenting adults having fun together. I don't see the harm in it. New age medicine...now there's some truly crazy stuff. Like P&T I'll give them that accupuncture might actually do some good in some cases. But the rest of it is just crazy nonsense. The only effect being the placebo effect. NASA? Well, I'm not as bold as them...I don't think I'll touch that one. Sleep, that one was good. I'm with that one expert. You go out, try out a few beds, ignore any and all supposed ""experts"" who tell you that their bed is the best. Lay on a few, see what is comfortable for you and (this is important) within your price range, and choose that one. Overall, it was a great buy and a great series. I love them. Keep on what your doing, guys, and I'll keep buying your series. :)",5,Almost Perfect,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,1345,"['Ok', 'episode', 'list', 'War', 'Porn', 'New', 'Age', 'Medicine', 'NASA', 'Dolphins', 'Sleep', 'Inc', 'Being', 'Green', 'Sensitivity', 'Training', 'Stranger', 'Danger', 'World', 'Peace', 'Good', 'Ol', 'Days', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'only', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'episode', 'doplphins', 'Even', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'crazy', 'love', 'forget', 'are', 'wild', 'animals', 'war', 'porn', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'women', 'really', 'think', 'porn', 'objectifies', 'women', 'Well', ""'m"", 'woman', 'disagree', 'think', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'consenting', 'adults', 'having', 'fun', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'harm', 'New', 'age', 'medicine', 'now', 'truly', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'P', 'T', ""'ll"", 'give', 'accupuncture', 'might', 'actually', 'do', 'good', 'cases', 'rest', 'just', 'crazy', 'nonsense', 'only', 'effect', 'being', 'placebo', 'effect', 'NASA', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'bold', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'touch', 'one', 'Sleep', 'one', 'was', 'good', ""'m"", 'one', 'expert', 'go', 'out', 'try', 'out', 'few', 'beds', 'ignore', 'supposed', 'experts', 'who', 'tell', 'bed', 'best', 'Lay', 'few', 'see', 'what', 'comfortable', 'important', 'price', 'range', 'choose', 'one', 'Overall', 'was', 'great', 'buy', 'great', 'series', 'love', 'Keep', 'what', 'doing', 'guys', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'buying', 'series']",Penn & Teller Bullsh*t: Complete Sixth Season

They are absurd to the point of being impaired.  Season six seems fatigued:  sensitivity, dolphins and the like echo earlier episodes.  Balance becomes an issue for this season, with acrimony working into some material--the Being Green episode was off kilter and strident.It would be good to see more shows about things we accept as mainstream but do in fact have faulty joints.  Stranger Danger made a bold point that child protection has become Manichean.  The series really hits target with episodes like these.The writers might consider lightening up on ideology and focusing on deconstructing things commonly accepted, such as the prison system, litigation culture (the root of political correctness), dumbed down reality TV and the like.Certainly there are enough contradictions out there to re-energize the series.",3,variable,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,931,"['Entertaining', 'always', 'mixed', 'season', 'hits', 'misfires.First', 'forgo', 'new', 'agers', 'while', 'are', 'absurd', 'point', 'being', 'impaired', 'Season', 'six', 'fatigued', 'sensitivity', 'dolphins', 'like', 'echo', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Balance', 'issue', 'season', 'acrimony', 'working', 'material', 'Being', 'Green', 'episode', 'was', 'off', 'kilter', 'strident.It', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'see', 'more', 'shows', 'things', 'accept', 'mainstream', 'do', 'fact', 'have', 'faulty', 'joints', 'Stranger', 'Danger', 'made', 'bold', 'point', 'child', 'protection', 'become', 'Manichean', 'series', 'really', 'target', 'episodes', 'these.The', 'writers', 'might', 'consider', 'lightening', 'up', 'ideology', 'focusing', 'deconstructing', 'things', 'commonly', 'accepted', 'such', 'prison', 'system', 'litigation', 'culture', 'root', 'political', 'correctness', 'dumbed', 'reality', 'TV', 'like.Certainly', 'are', 'enough', 'contradictions', 'there', 're-energize', 'series']",Penn & Teller Bullsh*t: Complete Sixth Season
