Very humorous, very comedic, very funny, very excellent and very absolutely timeless! Kid 'n Play were the originators with the movie franchise. Let's start from scratch.1. House Party (1990) - This movie was that moment you will ever have in your life. Robin Harris was the stand out as &#34;Pop&#34; before he died(in case the movie Bebe's Kids gives me the answer of how Harris died). 5 stars!2. House Party 2 (1991) - The underrated sequel was way too funnier, but never reach the original House Party. 3.5 stars.3. House Party 3 (1994) - Kid 'n Play's last stand and the main problem was the music was too gangster-ish when it came out. 4 Stars.4. House Party 4 (2001) - The worst movie ever without Kid 'n Play. It looks bad and different. 1 stars.If you loved House Party, then stick to the first 3 movies not the 4th House Party.",5,All the parties will be at your house!

Pop these suckers in the DVD player sit back relax and let the rollercoaster of fun take you on a ride to hilarity. One of my favorite parts is when they're having a secret party and the dude is trying to find it, they drive the dean batty, thwart enemies in the most comical ways, when the dean is on your case, what's a guy to do? Use evasive meneuvers. and a lot more These guys are like the FBI always on top of things, when they are close to getting caught they outfox the enemy at every turn, and when necessary can move a party in a second.
