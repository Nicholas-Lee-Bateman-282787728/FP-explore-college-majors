1505066,A1X4CADBJ3LCBM,B005X7H9U4,Luister,"[6, 7]","This Blu-ray is boring and misguided. How such incredible country can be depicted in such a lackluster way, takes talent. Or maybe anti-talent.The ""stunning high-definition"" was neither. The subjects, the shots, the angles, the cinematography in general, was amateurish and unspectacular.Speaking of subjects, they chose to waste a significant amount of time on the human history of the region. Recreating Custer's Last Stand and Wounded Knee has nothing to do with the grandeur of these parks. Then they threw in the life and murder of Wild Bill Hickok. I am not joking.These parks are vast enough to fill over an hour of a ""stunning high-definition"" Blu-ray, with a tour of the best features. This is what I expected. That is not what I got.",2,What a disappointment!,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,743,"['Blu-ray', 'boring', 'misguided', 'How', 'such', 'incredible', 'country', 'can', 'be', 'depicted', 'such', 'lackluster', 'way', 'talent', 'maybe', 'anti-talent.The', 'stunning', 'high-definition', 'was', 'subjects', 'shots', 'angles', 'cinematography', 'general', 'was', 'amateurish', 'unspectacular.Speaking', 'subjects', 'chose', 'waste', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'human', 'history', 'region', 'Recreating', 'Custer', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'nothing', 'do', 'grandeur', 'parks', 'Then', 'threw', 'life', 'murder', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'am', 'not', 'joking.These', 'parks', 'are', 'vast', 'enough', 'fill', 'over', 'hour', 'stunning', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'tour', 'best', 'features', 'what', 'expected', 'not', 'what', 'got']",National Parks Exploration Series: The Black Hills and the Badlands - Gateway to the West

1505068,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B005X7H9U4,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 5]","I have many volumes of the BBC Earth and BBC Video collections about wildlife and nature and all that beauty of our natural earth.  But this collection bored me beyond tears.  This is one of those videos that your teacher made you watch so that she could go have a cigarette in the lobby while you watched this lame film.  As a student, this film could make you groggy and drowsy for the rest of your school day, so student beware! If I had to watch this in a nature class, I'd've asked to dropped the class and apply my interests towards something else for a school credit.The narrator, has this annoying forced expectation of himself to enunciate every syllable very clearly, so he just sounded grating as hell as he narrated, which felt as comfortable as hearing someone drag their fingernails across a chalkboard.And what's next, I don't usually like to criticize someone's effort at putting out poor video quality, but this Blu-Ray disc which is said to be of ""stunning high definition"" couldn't have stated a greater farce in what happens to be true.  I have DVD's that look sharper and clearer (and more ""stunning"", so to speak) than this lousy Blu-Ray disc.  But again, it could also be that my eyes were watering as I was yawning throughout the film, so perhaps my vision was compromised by the tears in my eyes.  No, that may not be true.  It had poor definition right from the start, many moments before I started being bored to death.But anyway, I only paid five bucks for this Blu-Ray disc.  I really doubt that I'll ever watch this again.  In fact, I'm gonna trade it in somewhere towards another decent used Blu-Ray disc.  If they give me a dollar in credit for the trade in, I'll believe that it's worth it.  I'll accept the 4 dollar loss.  If anyone pays more than 2 dollars for this BD as used, he or she may feel that they just got ripped off. Insomniacs may actually enjoy getting something beneficial and helpful using this BD as a potent sleep inducing tool. So, there ya go!",1,Don't watch while sitting near sharp objects.
