1538737,A76YYKY2IKTH4,B007VJ5CYM,A. Hutto,"[1, 1]","After having stumbled onto the first &#34;Encounter&#34; movie and being blown away by it I stumbled on the second movie after looking for the first one on dvd and found the second one for 6 bucks on blu ray so I tried.for starters I'll say the blu ray has subtitle problems either that or the xbox one has issues. the subtitles sometimes sync up and others time don't and often freeze on the screen. the movie never crashed mind you but it was still irritated.the people who played JEsus and Satan return for the second one(at least I think that is the same Deville as the first one).while the first movie takes the everyday mundane life gone wrong approach to solving things, the second ups the ante a bit and tackles the truly hard questions of the Christian Gospel. How does one apply the Gospel to drug lords? sex trades? guns and violence? This movie plays out in some way like Jesus and Satan playing a chess match moving their pieces around the board. Satan of course doing so in vain but nonetheless that is what is going on. Jesus is a bit more supernatural and Godlike in His powers and abilities in this movie versus the first one. Satan is conversly a bit more cunning and underhanded in this one unlike the first one. In this movie you get a subtle sense of the behind the scenes cosmic war of Jesus and Satan playing out.in this one Jesus stops time to reach out to someone's heart, appears everywhere and anywhere, is out standing on the water and even heals someone. I think this adds a bit of the God character to Jesus that the first one lacked.....the first one was a long talkfest which was a powerful movie but the second one the situations are more extreme.I think all too often christians(and I admit I am guilty of this too) tend to take an impratical approach to faith. christians can't seem to get the idea that bad stuff just happens and to apply faith in Christ you often must figure out how you can in your own life. both movies address the fact that Christ seems distant and not real in our everyday lives except here in the second movie Jesus seems to answer them back whereas in the first movie the question is largely ignored or Jesus even givens some sidestepping in his answers.this movie addresses heavily the consequences of the gift of free will and human hatred and our love for darkness. the concept of just how far God is willing to let free will go is tested in the last 30 minutes of this movie and it is a great display of tension as one is never quite sure when or if Jesus will interfere.this movie attempts to tackle some hard questions and situations, whereas in the first movie the hardest situations are greed, divorce, rape, and running away from home. the second movie here addresses how does one who has murdered countless people find hope and redemption? God has said to preach the gospel to every living thing so how does one preach the gospel to the drug lord? to the heroin addict who is about to die from withdrawal? Could you truly trust Jesus if He told you to Trust Him and give Him the heroin while your wife is dying if she doesn't get a fix right then and there? I think such thought provoking questions and moments bring this movie to a whole new level the first &#34;Encounter&#34; simply could not touch. You see your wife dying from withdrawal as Jesus still not willing to break free will, calmly asks if she wants the temporary fix or the eternal fix? I bet most would just say give her the drugs she is dying man GIVE HER THE DRUGS!!!! meanwhile The Lord is merely saying &#34;Trust me okay????&#34; I think this also explains the lack of miracle healings these days, people aren't quite willing to trust Jesus enough and so He gives us exactly what we ask for whether it is a miracle healing or a &#34;miracle healing via science&#34;.This movie takes the idea of Follow Me and Trust Me no matter what concept of the first Encounter movie and ups it to new extreme levels. Would you be willing to take a bullet for The Lord? Would you be willing to die if it meant your father would get saved in the kingdom of God? this is a far cry deeper than the first movie where one of the toughest decisions is to break up with someone. I think people not liking the second one as much speaks to peoples general lack of willingness to truly test their own faith.while I know this movie has gotten mixed reviews because some folks didn't like it because it was too much action or somehow not as deep as the first one....I think this movie took the idea of the first one and upped it several notches and truly tested the idea of just how much we should be willing to follow God and just how low God is willing to come down if it means even saving one soul in the kingdom of God.I also know some folks complained about the violence having no place in a christian movie....the reality is violence is all around us and God can save anyone in any situation they are in.....also the crucifixation was quite brutal and the bible in general is a brutal book and the prophesied book of revelation is one of the most brutal books on the planet..... if christians cannot look at prostitutes and drug dealers because they are rated X then christians are a truly doomed race of people. the commandments of Christ are too call everyone to Him and Christ did that very thing, He visited the truly low and desolate and pathetic of society and was mocked for much like I think modern christianity does today. the modern Christian would do well to heed that reminder and heed the message of this movie....that no matter your situation, whether you were a prostitute, a drug dealer, a murder, or about to committ suicide....Christ can and will save you if you will just give Him a chance....usually meaning to just ask Him in faith.and I think these kind of lost causes are what christianity is missing today. too much fluff and not enough substance.I know one other complaint I've seen of this movie is it takes too long to get going unlike the first one. I think that is easily answered because this one shows more of the cosmic war between Jesus and Satan. Of those two setting up the pieces or the several people who will all be together in the house. This one also shows that Jesus can put together the 5 most unlikely of people together in a room and save them whereas the first one was 5 random strangers who can't proceed past a road block, this one gets together a couple about to divorce with the husband about to committ suicide, a suspended DEA agent, a drug dealer, his bodyguard who is about to betray him(the great plan of Satan), and the drug dealers wife whom he freed from prostitution....and they are all gathered together into the house of the couple admist a storm that is coming which is a great reference to Jesus walking on water in a storm calling Peter to Come To Him. Also the way in which Jesus comes into the house is great because He is seen walking around outside and the bodyguard goes outside and forces Him in at gunpoint.I think the complainers can't grasp the bigger picture and the subtle nature of this film.5 stars and a solid follow up to the first one. I really hope there is a third one.",5,amazing sequel to the first one,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,7172,"['having', 'stumbled', 'first', '34', 'Encounter', '34', 'movie', 'being', 'blown', 'away',

This movie had good action/tension/emotion allowing viewers to suspend their disbelief - at least until time to write a review. Two of my favorite Christian actors, Bruce Marciano and David A.R. White deploy their talents in this story, helping me to overlook some doctrinal issues - until I started reading the reviews composed by others. I am an outspoken critic of the once-saved, always saved theory. However, concerns that the sister, who overdosed on heroine, was going to hell despite confessing Jesus as her savior when she was 14, are debatable. Can someone who overdoses on heroine go to Heaven? I think that evidence is insufficient to indict this movie for preaching heresy for making that suggestion. When a Christian movie is made, not only do the typical elements of a movie need to pass muster, but the doctrinal tangent opens up an entirely new target for critiquing. With the lack of consensus in Christian thought, I'm afraid it is almost impossible to make a movie that will please everyone in this area.

These people have a chance to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior, or Deville (Devil) as the other alternative. There were similar stories of the characters that was captured in the first film, but this one was more heart-wrenching, more in depth for their sorrow or pain they were experience, and loved the back stories for a couple of the characters. Moreover, I loved the screen writing and some of the lines in the movie. There were actors in the movie who shared their pain, where it tugs at one's heart.

I liked the fact that this movie seemed to delve a little deeper into the person's past--so i got more involved with them and understood them better. ------------------------------&#8203;------------------------------&#8203;------------------------------&#8203;Plus -since the characters are so &#34;bad&#34; you get how much The Lord really loves us....even when we are unlovable.The first movie was seemed to deal with more pressing problems hitting the people right then. As the story unfolded -i got to know why the people were the way they were and i liked that. My husband on the other hand did not care for this one like he did the first one. The first encounter he went around telling everyone about this movie and this one did not seem to have much effect on him. I think mostly because with this movie you had to stay with it otherwise you would loose your place. I think it was a good movie and enjoyed it alot. Yeah there was some violence but --come on--it made it more realistic and I enjoyed the action.,5,More action than the 1st one.

Bruce Marchiano does another execellent job in showing the love and mercy of Christ in a such a biblical manner. This movie took a different twist in that instead of dealing with the more simple everyday issues of life facing ordinary individuals such as the desire for prestige and power, the ugliness of child abuse, and marital conflict, it took a turn to show us an encounter from inside the world of drugs and violence, while still remaining tasteful and not too graphic. You were able to see how Christ can save anyone, no matter how far into sin they fall. Christ Jesus is the answer for a lost and confused world!I thoroughly enjoyed it, and look forward to more encounters.
