546059,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00003OSTT,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Some ordinary men warned against the power of Nazi Germany and the threat to Europe and the whole world. A small family enters the USA as refugees. A steam locomotive takes them from the southwest to their destination in Washington DC: a large mansion owned by a rich and powerful widow. Her daughter Sarah married a German who moved to Rumania. Son-in-law Kurt used to work for Dornier Aircraft, but is now in the business of fighting fascism. Sarah's sister is married to a Rumanian who plays cards at the German embassy and wins money. There is an event at the German Embassy in Washington. Is there conflict between the Nazis and the German aristocracy because of class differences? The charming speech and manners contrast to the intrigue that lies below the surface.Kurt Muller works as an anti-fascist but it doesn't pay well. [What he does is unmentionable.] People suffered in Germany after the end of the Great War. Then street fighting foretold of the coming storm of Nazi rule. [An over-simplified history?] The Muller family then moved to various European countries. The conversation reveals the history of the characters. Teck snoops into Kurt's briefcase and finds a pistol, a medal, and $20,000 in currency. He calls the German Embassy to squeal about Max Freitag. Later Sarah discovers that briefcase and tells Kurt that someone opened it. The news of the capture of Max Freitag in Germany shocks Kurt and Sarah. Will Kurt return to Germany to rescue Max from prison? It will be very difficult, even if the Gestapo doesn't know that Kurt plans to return.Teck offers to sell information to the Gestapo agent at the Embassy. The price depends on the information. Kurt worries about what Teck can find out about him. Marthe makes a final break with Teck. Teck demands $10,000 to keep his mouth shut. Can he be trusted? Will the deal be reached by a gentleman's agreement? What will be done? What has to be done? Kurt makes a speech to justify his actions and says goodbye.The speeches show its origin as a stage play. This drama provides a snapshot of popular feeling in the early 1940s. This two-hour film drags in spots, the attitudes are dated.

546061,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00003OSTT,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[3, 3]","The Rhine is a great European river that serves as the German border on both France and Switzerland.  Its place in the title of this overlooked classic is symbolic, as all of the action in this film takes place in North America.  The story's focus is on Germany, Europe, American isolationism, and all that they represented in the years leading up to World War II, with the Nazis tightening their hold on their power over the majority of the German people while many Germans were escaping their grasp.  Some actively fought the Nazi overthrow of their homeland, crossing the Rhine to move more freely outside Hitler's Germany.This film is about one such man and his family.  Paul Lukas earned an Oscar as Best Actor for this film, with Bette Davis supplying her usual histrionics in support, although it is interesting to see her portray a gallant loving wife where her melodrama is understandable.  Davis, as a major box office draw of the time, insisted on Lukas reprising this role that he had originated on stage, agreeing to play against type herself to ensure the film got made, thus performing in her second consecutive Lillian Hellman tale in a row (the only two of her career, the other being 1941's even more excellent ""The Little Foxes"").  There are flaws in this film; there are none in Lukas's performance.  The child actors who portray their offspring are often painful to watch, but their scenes are usually brief once the film gets rolling.  And I agree with other reviewers here that the film is too heavy on exposition and speeches.Nonetheless, the final act of this film is well worth waiting for.  It doesn't play as safely with its characters as one may expect from films of this era, and what seems at first a rather mediocre film does redeem itself with a tremendous payoff in spite of the anticlimactic epilogue.Ultimately what's most interesting about the film to me is that it is a snapshot of an unsure time, an era when Hitler was still in power and thriving as the greatest threat to freedom the world perhaps had ever known, filmed in 1943 but set in 1940 when Americans strongly wanted to stay out of it...until Pearl Harbor.  Viewing this story and these characters through their perspective is an enlightening experience.

546062,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00003OSTT,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","1943's timely wartime drama WATCH ON THE RHINE (adapted from Lillian Hellman's acclaimed 1941 Broadway play) was a most important film for the era; and it also marked the second time that Bette Davis acted with Lillian Hellman material (the first being 1941's screen version of her celebrated ""Little Foxes"").Sara Muller (Bette Davis), her husband K&uacute;rt (Paul Lukas) and their three children have been constantly traveling around Europe for many years, operating as part of the underground anti-Nazi movement.  The family is finally able to obtain temporary citizenship in the United States, where Sara is reunited with her mother and brother, yet their newfound safety is threatened when fellow houseguest Teck de Brancovis (George Coulouris) is revealed to be a Nazi sympathiser and blackmailer...Although Davis wasn't overly fond of the movie, she did recognize it's importance as a propaganda tool during the war years; and fought long and hard for her co-star Paul Lukas to receive star billing, though that battle was sadly unsuccessful.  The film itself came shortly on the heels of Davis's brilliant star performance as Charlotte Vale in ""Now, Voyager"", and producer Hal Wallis wanted to exploit that fact in the marketing of WATCH ON THE RHINE.  Lukas (reprising the role he'd played to raves on Broadway) received ample compensation when he walked away with the Academy Award for his performance; it's still considered his greatest acting role on film.Davis was surrounded by a few people she'd enjoyed working with in the past, including Geraldine Fitzgerald (from ""Dark Victory""); and Janis Wilson (troubled Tina in ""Now, Voyager"").  The film also boasts one of the most amazing turns from Lucile Watson who plays Sara's mother, as well as Beulah Bondi, Henry Daniell, Eric Roberts and Donald Buka.During her now-legendary November 1971 appearance on 'The Dick Cavett Show', Davis was asked whether WATCH ON THE RHINE was one of her favourite films.  Her reply: ""It was not ever my favourite part except for one speech, about [Sara afraid of] being alone at night.  Wallis asked me if I'd play the wife for name value, because [the film] wasn't a good risk, but he wanted to make it.  And because it was such an incredible document of that time, of everything we were going through; and of course Ms Hellman's writing is always super brilliant.  I more than willingly played it"".The DVD comes equipped with another fantastic Warner Night at the Movies programme, so you can extend the film into a complete evening of entertainment.  Available as part of the third Bette Davis Collection from Warners, which also includes ""The Old Maid"", ""In This Our Life"", ""Deception"", ""All This and Heaven Too"", and ""The Great Lie"".",4,"""I do what must be done.

546066,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00003OSTT,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 9]","This film adaptation of Lillian Hellman's groundbreaking anti-fascist play has aged poorly since the 1940s. The plot is similar to ""Casablanca"": Paul Lukas (in what is generally considered his best role) plays an aging, weary member of the German underground, who has come to America with his wife and family, as they continue to raise funds to help the resistence at home. America is still a slumbering giant, childishly unaware of the evil depths of the Nazi threat. Lukas faces off against an unscrupulous Nazi collaborator, who threatens to turn him and his family over to the Germans, and while the bad guy is an absolute sleaze, he and Lukas share a common bond as Europeans, realists who recognize the nature of the fascism, even though their American hosts remain clueless. The stage version of this story was ahead of its time (Hellman was one of those left-leaning ""premature antifascists"" who ached for the American government to get into the war), but the film adaptation, which came out in '43, was a bit anachronistic: by then, the thought of any Americans, anywhere, being naive and accomodating towards the Germans was a bit unbelievable. Mostly, though, the movie is just way too exposition heavy, and even with a fine set of actors and a script that was touched up by Dashiel Hammett, it's frankly a bit awkward, sluggish and melodramatic. Bette Davis is fine; Beulah Beondi is a hoot. A classic, sure, and certainly worth checking out, although you have to be in the right mood.",3,+1/2.

546067,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B00003OSTT,Douglas M,"[6, 7]","A powerful and impressive film, ""Watch on the Rhine"", based on a Lillian Hellman Broadway hit, still resonates today.  Amazon themselves have described the film admirably with Paul Lukas's towering performance supported ably by a subdued Bette Davis and surrounded by a number of the Broadway cast. The film is static, reflecting its stagebound roots, but it does not matter because it is the screenplay by Dashiell Hammett, Hellman's lover at the time, which really counts.  There are some great monologues.The print of the film is perfect and Warner's Night at the Movies covers some interesting ground. The Newsreel, called ""Bombs for Hamburg"", while missing its soundtrack, is vivid propaganda for the war machine. Ozzie Nelson and his band are featured in a short film with 5 musical numbers one being a group singing ""Chinatown, my Chinatown"" in close harmony - delightful. The cartoon has Daffy Duck causing havoc to Porky Pig.  Daffy does a mock strip in preparation for the oven and this is hilarious.The dud of this set is the commentary delivered by one Bernard F. Dick, a biographer of Lillian Hellman, Claudette Colbert and Hal Walllis, the film's producer.

Davis is subdued, but very effective, as the wife of an anti-fascist German freedom fighter  during World War Two, who has come home to her family in Washington so that  she, her husband, and her children may have a rest from the difficult and  dangerous life they have been leading.  Paul Lukas gives a sincere and  quietly emotional performance as her heroic husband who must make some  difficult decisions to protect his friends and family.  Lucille Watson is  terrific as Davis' strong and opinionated mother, while the young actors  who portray the children are a bit stiff.

We.Americans still don't pay attention, do we? The plot and dialog are expert, from Hammett & Company; the filming and editing quite good, and the score one of Steiner's best, lyrical or suspenseful as the needs of the plot demanded. As for the acting, Bette Davis, imported for her box-office reach, gives a performance which I like as much as any she's done because she's toned it down. The kids are droll but average to unsatisfactoy, Couloris as Count Teck is dastardly in a satisfactory manner, and Bette's mother and brother are convincingly  self-absorbed and naive. Their mind-set is average for the times (notice how they treat the black help), However, they serve to draw us into the conflicts unfolding in their living room. Meanwhile Paul Lukas repeats, with wonderful effect., the role he had been starring in for a year or more on Broadway. If you're still annoyed because he won the Academy Award instead of Bogie, just take another look at Bogie. In my opinion, he's a bunch of mannerisms with a short acting range. For the most prt Casablanca makes good use of Bogie's limitations, breaking out at the very end to convey a bit more depth. By contrast, Lukas can convey, in a basically thankless role--compare Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo in Casablanca-- another good but torn human being. These are difficult parts to make interesting or likable, but like Henreid, Paul Lukas succeeds in giving us a detailed portrait of a decent, dedicated man with a messy and troubled life of overwhelming commitments entangled with love of wife and family  Like Henreid's Victor, Lucas's Muller comes alive, convincing us about who he is, what's motivating him and why we need him in the world of the 40's and also of today. In my humble opinion Paul Lukas gives one of the transcendent performances in all of movie history. Why people prefer Bogart is beyond me. I gave the film 4 stars out of 5 because of the children and the silly digression with the best friend and the shopping trip to Washington, which seems to serve no useful purpose, just wasting our time.",4,a fine old message move,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,2212,"['Surprisingly', 'play/movie', 'firmly', 'dated', 'early', ""'40"", 'also', 'relevant', 'today', 'sleepy', 'mind-set', 'world', 'We.Americans', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'do', 'plot', 'dialog', 'are', 'expert', 'Hammett', 'Company', 'filming', 'editing', 'quite', 'good', 'score', 'one', 'Steiner', 'best', 'lyrical', 'suspenseful', 'needs', 'plot', 'demanded', 'acting', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'imported', 'box-office', 'reach', 'performance', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'done', 'toned', 'down', 'kids', 'are', 'droll', 'average', 'unsatisfactoy', 'Couloris', 'Count', 'Teck', 'dastardly', 'satisfactory', 'manner', 'Bette', 'mother', 'brother', 'are', 'convincingly', 'self-absorbed', 'naive', 'mind-set', 'average', 'times', 'notice', 'how', 'treat', 'black', 'help', 'However', 'serve', 'draw', 'conflicts', 'unfolding', 'living', 'room', 'Meanwhile', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'repeats', 'wonderful', 'effect.', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'starring', 'year', 'more', 'Broadway', ""'re"", 'still', 'annoyed', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'instead', 'Bogie', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'Bogie', 'opinion', 'bunch', 'mannerisms', 'short', 'acting', 'range', 'most', 'prt', 'Casablanca', 'good', 'use', 'Bogie', 'limitations', 'breaking', 'out', 'very', 'end', 'convey', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'contrast', 'Lukas', 'can', 'convey', 'basically', 'thankless', 'role', 'compare', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'Victor', 'Laszlo', 'Casablanca', 'good', 'torn', 'human', 'being', 'are', 'difficult', 'parts', 'make', 'interesting', 'likable', 'Henreid', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'giving', 'detailed', 'portrait', 'decent', 'dedicated', 'man', 'messy', 'troubled', 'life', 'overwhelming', 'commitments', 'entangled', 'love', 'wife', 'family', 'Henreid', 'Victor', 'Lucas', 'Muller', 'alive', 'convincing', 'who', 'what', 'motivating', 'why', 'need', 'world', '40', 'also', 'today', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'one', 'transcendent', 'performances', 'movie', 'history', 'Why', 'people', 'prefer', 'Bogart', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'stars', '5', 'children', 'silly', 'digression', 'best', 'friend', 'shopping', 'trip', 'Washington', 'serve', 'useful', 'purpose', 'just', 'wasting', 'time']",Watch on the Rhine VHS

By 1940, Europe had been plunged into darkness. Bette Davis is Sara Muller & she has been in Europe for the last 17 years. She is married to a German anti-facist freedom fighter Karl Muller, played by Paul Lukas. They have three kids. They have fled to the United States which is still a year & a half away from war. They are welcomed into Sara's childhood home by her mother, the wealthy & influential Mrs. Farrell & Sara's brother David. They are representative of the ignorance most Americans had as to what had happened in Europe. Mrs. Farrell rules but she warms quickly to her daughter's family. In addition, Mrs. Farrell has two house guests, Marthe & Teck de Brancovis, upper class exiles from Romania. He is a Nazis collaborator & visits the German Embassy often. He wishes to return to Europe. Marthe who appears to be an American, does not want to go back. Besides, she is in love with David. The Muller's plans to settle into a comfortable, affluent lifestlye are foiled when events in Europe convince Kurt that he must return to Europe & continue the fight. DeBranovis becomes aware of this & plans to inform the Germans, thus currying favor with the Nazis. This major conflict must be decided the night that Kurt plans to leave. There is some sermonizing on both sides & when done by the children it is a bit irritating. This is Paul Lukas movie. Bette Davis stepped back just a bit to allow Lukas to shine.

The screenplay adaptation, which was co-authored by Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, is terrific. It tells the story of a German resistance leader, Kurt Muller, who comes to America, traveling incognito with his American born wife, Sarah, and three children, and visits his wife's wealthy mother and brother in their beautiful antebellum style mansion.During their visit, they make the acquaintance of a Roumanian expatriate who is there as a house guest together with a his wife, a hometown girl and friend of the family. The Roumanian, a Nazi sympathizer, who frequently visits the German embassy, ultimately clashes with Muller, as irreconciable philosophical differences come to a head in a rousing climax.Paul Lukas, who plays the noble freedom fighter with consummate dignity and passion, steals the show. A finer piece of acting is hard to find. He deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his heartfelt and heroic portrayal of Kurt Muller. It is, without a doubt, a performance to remember. Bette Davis plays it smart and gives a fine, though somewhat restrained, performance as a loyal and altruistic wife. She is luminous in the role.Lucille Watson is marvelous as Sarah's dominant, generous, and larger than life mother. A very young and beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald effectively plays the role of wife to the disreputable Roumanian expatriate, a wife disgusted with her husband's politics and lack of character, making her susceptible to the infinitely more alluring charms of Sarah's kind brother. The three childrem are stiff in their roles and, though affording some comic relief, are the only weakness in this otherwise compelling drama.This is a marvelous movie that will appeal to those who love classic films. Fans of Bette Davis will also enjoy this film, provided that they do not expect a histrionic, over the top performance by Bette.

Hollywood responded with a series of big and bold war films that emphasized action and the personal heroism of its stars.  WATCH ON THE RHINE was different in that the action was personal and verbal.  Director Herman Shumlin took the successful play by Lillian Hellman and placed the battlegound in a living room where Paul Lukas and George Coulouris traded ideological body blows that became physical only in the final scene.  Lukas and his wife Bette Davis are forced to leave Europe for the sanctuary of the United States, where they can live in the luxury of Bette Davis's wealthy mother.  After arriving in America, Lukas enjoys his new surroundings but is also aware that his work of fighting Nazism is far from complete.  George Coulouris is a Rumanian expatriate count with strong Nazi leanings who threatens to turn Lukas in should he return to Germany.  The best parts of the film lie in the extended debates between Lukas, who extols the virtues of western democracy, and Coulouris, who maintains that Nazism is the inevitable end of European politics.  The movie belongs squarely to Lukas, who was a deserved Oscar winner for Best Actor.  For one of the few times in Bette Davis's career, she was content with a supporting role, yet she managed enough screen time as Lukas's devoted wife to indelibly etch herself in the audience's mind as a woman caught in the middle of the old world of European politics and the new one of America's.

I guess that is the point.  There is a climatic moment in this movie where there are so many available solutions to the problem that our hero faces.  Unfortunately, he chooses the one solution that exemplified everything he professed to be fighting against.  All the great dialogue and the truly great preformance of Paul Lukas washed away quickly when I saw how our ""hero"" handled his crisis.  I'm doing my best not to give anything away for those who haven't seen the movie.  Just consider that Lukas and his family were in neutral America, that no one was apt to get away with anything funny around them, that he had been brilliant in avoiding detection throughout Europe for years and presumably would be able to do so easily again, and on and on and on.

546086,A3NP8P2PHBZABD,B00003OSTT,"Tidewater ""Whaler""","[2, 10]","Sorry, folks, but I dissent. I find ""Watch on the Rhine"" a perfect example of communist influence in Hollywood in the 1940s.A few examples from the movie: (1) making heroes out of the Soviet-supported forces who fought in Spain in the late 1930s against the Nazi-supported Nationalists (a pox on both their houses); (2) transforming, (in several impassioned speeches by the Lukas character) American democratic ideals into ideological extremism. The lines, seeking ""a better world for our children,"" in this movie translates to a world dominated by Soviet-style communism. In short, the Lukas character is driven by extremist ideology just as much as his German enemies, one from the left, one from the right. It's interesting that this movie, based on a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman, was produced in 1943, four years after the international communist movement (represented by Lukas) had been stunned by the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, promising eternal amity between Germany and the Soviet Union. This suggests to me that Hellman, a notorious communist sympathizer, wrote her play (adapted for the screen by Dashiell Hammett, also a communist fellow traveler) in the immediate wake of the Ribbentrop affair as a means of restoring the faith of her fellow Soviet sympathizers in the righteousness of their cause and their eventual victory over ""bourgeois materialism."" It certainly plays that way. By the time the movie was released, Americans needed little or no bucking up about the evils of National Socialism, the ostensible aim of the film, and instead were given a sample of not-so-subtle propaganda promoting the eventual victory of the Comintern. (I find it amusing that Hellman/Hammett wrote some lines critical of Ribbentrop and got them included in the script. Only the cognoscenti would get those references.)While one reviewer here praises the Lukas character as extolling ""the virtues of western democracy,"" the Lukas character is doing no such thing. The Lukas character in fact is extolling the virtues of international communism, and underlines his fanatical devotion to the cause by: (a) abandoning his family to continue his efforts and (b) shooting a blackmailer in cold blood.

546087,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00003OSTT,Westley,"[6, 7]","Bette Davis stars in ""Watch on the Rhine"" as Sara Muller, the daughter of a well-connected Washington political family.  Sara is married to a German (Paul Lukas), and they return to America after living for many years in Europe.  Her family is puzzled by the somewhat mysterious Lukas, especially when they hear that he has been fighting fascism in Europe.  Slowly the pieces start to fall in place, which attracts the attention of others as well.""Watch on the Rhine"" is a solid WWII film that tackles fascism in a straight-forward manner.  Obviously, the stakes were high in 1943, so one can imagine the impact of the film at the time.  Today, the film is a bit antiseptic and stagy -- exposing it's origins as a Lillian Hellman play.  In addition, the tone is somewhat jingoistic, but it's carried off with sincerity as well as fine performances and direction.  Paul Lukas won an Oscar for his characterization.  He originated the role on Broadway but was not selected initially for the film; Bette Davis agreed to take a supporting role here to give the film a star and allow Lukas to be cast.  Lukas is quite good, although he probably did not deserve to beat Humphrey Bogart in the far superior ""Casablanca.""Although based on the Hellman play, surprisingly the script was written by Dashiell Hammett -- the only one he wrote not based on his own books.  He brings little of his film noir flare to ""Watch on the Rhine,"" although a fair amount of tension builds toward the end.
