His teacher Dennis Hopper, tells him that the only way he can pass, is to turn in a science project, that isn't in anyway connected to cars. Since Mike can do that in his sleep, now to really set this up. The movie opens in 1950, where a UFO makes a mockery of the airforce, before it crashes. They bring Eisenhower in to asses the situation, and he decides that the UFO's remains be destroyed. Now cut to the future, Harlan decides to find his science project in a Military Junkyard, and amazingly the junkyard is also on the same base that the UFO was at.

504577,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00000IQB7,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[11, 14]","If I recall correctly, the last science project I did in school involved using a potato, nails, and a couple of pennies to make a kind of battery... okay, so I never threatened to disrupt the space/time continuum with my potato battery, but it was still pretty cool...My Science Project (1985), written and directed by Jonathan Betuel, who had a seemingly very short career in Hollywood writing 1984's The Last Starfighter and then sort of falling off the face of the Earth after his 1995 flop Theodore Rex, starring Whoopi Goldberg (she really has the Midas touch, but instead of turning things into gold, they turn into cr@p).  Starring in the film is John Stockwell (Losin' It, Christine), Danielle von Zerneck (La Bamba), and Fisher Stevens (Short Circuit, Super Mario Bros.).  Also appearing is Raphael Sbarge (Vision Quest, Carnosaur), Richard Masur (Risky Business), Barry Corbin (Stir Crazy), Ann Wedgeworth (Love and a .45) and Dennis Hopper (Blue Velvet).The film begins with scenes at a U.S. air force base, circa 1957, and the decision, of the highest authority, to cover up a mysterious UFO that was found crashed nearby.  The story then moves to the present (1985 being the present), where we meet Mike Harlan, a high school student and motor head (that's someone who's really good with cars), eagerly awaiting to graduate, but finds himself in the predicament of having to come up with a science project, or else his science teacher, Bob Roberts (Hopper) won't pass him.  He scavenges the local junkyard (which used to be the air force base in the 50's), and comes across a strange, glowing thingy (all that was left of the UFO) and decides to try and pass it off as his project.  Only problem is the strange thingy begins feeding on various power sources (Hey, let's hotwire it into an electrical outlet!), and soon begins creating trans-dimensional rifts in time and space, causing different time periods (the past, present, and future) to co-exist, along with drawing his science teacher into the subsequent vortex (I wonder how that will effect his chances of graduating).  Will Mike and his friends be able to stop the alien thing-a-ma-gig from tearing the very fabric of the space/time continuum a new one?My Science Project is one of those films from the 80's of which I had fond remembrances (much like Night of the Comet, which, as I write this, has still to make an appearance on DVD).  While some of those films haven't held up as well watching them some 20 years later, for me, this one has...it's funny, engaging, and visually entertaining.  Keep in mind this isn't a movie where the characters travel through time, but one where elements from different time periods appear in their reality.  The casting is very well done, especially with Stockwell (who appeared earlier as Arnie's jock friend Dennis in John Carpenter's killer car film Christine) as the lead character of Mike, a seemingly single-minded fellow (he cares more for his red GTO muscle car than he does for relationships with people) finding there's more to life than carburetors and spark plugs (is it me, or does Stockwell seem to have just a really huge forehead, certainly more than the average person).  Danielle von Zerneck (her most famous role probably as Ritchie Valens girlfriend Donna in 1987's La Bamba) also does well as Mike's would be girlfriend, a nerdy, bookish character who learns there's something to be said for living life outside her books.  And Hopper as the hippy-ish science teacher seems a no brainer, obviously utilizing his past experiences to our benefit.  The only character I didn't care much for was that of Vince Latello (Stevens), the stereotypical greasy Italian friend of Mike's.  He was obviously the comic relief, and you will either love him or hate him, but I thought Stevens' performance a little too over the top for my tastes, and ultimately distracting.  In case you're not familiar with Stevens, his sort of ambiguous ethnicity allows him to play many different kinds of characters, including his role as the Indian inventor in the 1986 Steve Guttenberg/Ally Sheedy film Short Circuit.  The direction was strong, as Betuel manages to juggle a decent story with a few subplots well, keeping my interest throughout, and also throws in a couple of references, one to Stockwell's earlier film Christine, and one with Hopper's character showing up wearing the same outfit he wore in Easy Rider.  He also develops the characters enough to get some of them (the important ones, at least) past the realm of being two-dimensional.  I thought it kind of strange that he should have so little in the way of other credits to his name, as he shows here he can not only direct a film well, write a decent story.  The special effects looked really good for the time it was released, and even hold up well to today's standards.  I especially liked the Tyrannosaurus Rex in the school gymnasium, although it's no match for Spielberg's creation in Jurassic Park, it was still done well.  They did tend to use the swirling vortex above the school a bit much for my tastes, but that's a relatively minor point.The widescreen (2.35:1) picture, released by Touchstone, on this DVD looks pretty good, but there are a few, minor flaws, and I thought the audio a bit soft.  There was an earlier release by Anchor Bay that featured both widescreen and full screen formats, but no full screen here.  There are no special features available, not even a trailer, so given the lack of effort in the release, I have to go with three stars.Cookieman108",3,"""Is this like when you told us we could smoke

This movie was no exception, though perhaps it ranks a bit low on the list.The worst part was the sound, which seemed worse to me than my old VHS copy of the movie. It seemed like it needs to be remixed to make sure the dialogue is audible over the foley and music in several places, as the speech is hard to hear. The video is grainy and poor, with multiple instances of dust or hairs flicking on the screen, which are easily remedied with today's technology (not much more than a guy with a video editing program on his computer). Further, it seems like some of the profanity was poorly dubbed out that I don't recall on the old tape, using ""funk"" or ""suck"" instead of the F-word in a few places, while other words are left untouched. I noticed the same thing on my Last Starfighter DVD and suspect it was some partial edit to conform to rating standards and/or market the movie to younger audiences. Perhaps it was like that on the tape and is only noticeable on the DVD due to the sound issues, but it's clear that the actors' voices shift as in any dubbing situation, such as those on network TV.Still, the movie is great to have once again, if as a poor quality version for the medium.

But they don't do a very good job because twenty years later, Motor Head Mike finds part of it in the junkyard of the same army base when he is trying to find something to pass off as his high school science project. Together with his friends Ellie and Vince, Mike cleans up the machine he has found and feeds it some power.

Mike, Vince, and Sherman, steal the guns from some Vietcong soldiers that have popped out of the warp and shoot everything that moves. They rescue Ellie and save mankind.My Opinion:  I think it's mostly nostalgia that makes people rate this movie high. There are a lot of other movies that do it better. It takes this movie so long to get to the good parts. A movie like this should be all good parts. Fisher Stevens and Dennis Hopper both give good performances, but it isn't enough to make this movie good. This is one of those movies that is a lot better when you are a kid.DVD Quality:  Wide Screen 2.35:1 NON-Anamorphic on one side, 1.33:1 full screen on the other. DD2.0.

When I ordered this from RAREWARES-IMPORTS I sent them an E-Mail asking if this was a Region 1 DVD because their details were vague and didn't include where they were located or anything about the DVD. I found out the hard way that they are located in Europe, the DVD was already sent and it was a Region 2. When I finally got the DVD, my daughter opened the package, I had to spend an extra $9.50 to send it back to them first class. When I was refunded, they only gave me back the money I spent on the DVD, $5.63 which didn't include the $3.99 S&H I paid in the first place.

504612,A148SWLMXH9UTC,B00000IQB7,"The Sultan of Sexy ""RLTW""","[1, 1]","This movie came out in 1985 during the blitz of teen-age comedies that happened in the early and mid 80's. With the exception of Dennis Hopper, the cast is not your typical A list group. But imho, that's what it makes it fun.We start out with a UFO that crash lands in the 1950's out in the Arizona desert. The government covers it up and 30 years later a high school student finds the engine to the craft and tries to pawn it off as his science project, only to find out that this engine can cause time and space to get mixed up and the high school gets turned into a place full of cave men, gladiators, Vietnam war continuing and even some mutants from the post apocalypse.John Stockwell is the star who finds the engine. Danielle Von Zerneck plays the love interest and Fisher Stevens steals the show as the wise cracking best friend who can't stay out of trouble. Dennis Hopper is their science teacher who unlocks the mystery of the alien engine and in the end we see Mr. Hopper back from a tour of the 60's and he's wearing the same clothes he wore in Easy Rider!No skin but plenty of non-politcally correct language which helps make the movie even funnier. If you are easily offended, then this movie is not for you. If you can laugh at yourself and just enjoy the movie for what it is, you'll be pleased. I know I was when I first saw it in 1985 and feel the same way 25 years later.",4,Just Fun to Watch,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,1391,"['movie', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'blitz', 'teen-age', 'comedies', 'happened', 'early', 'mid', '80', 'exception', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'cast', 'not', 'typical', 'A', 'list', 'group', 'imho', 'what', 'fun.We', 'out', 'UFO', 'crash', '1950', 'out', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'government', '30', 'years', 'later', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'engine', 'craft', 'tries', 'pawn', 'off', 'science', 'project', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'engine', 'can', 'cause', 'time', 'space', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'turned', 'place', 'full', 'cave', 'men', 'gladiators', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'continuing', 'even', 'mutants', 'post', 'apocalypse.John', 'Stockwell', 'star', 'who', 'engine', 'Danielle', 'Von', 'Zerneck', 'love', 'interest', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'show', 'wise', 'cracking', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'trouble', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'mystery', 'alien', 'engine', 'end', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Hopper', 'back', 'tour', '60', 'wearing', 'same', 'clothes', 'wore', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'No', 'skin', 'plenty', 'non-politcally', 'correct', 'language', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'funnier', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'then', 'movie', 'not', 'can', 'laugh', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1985', 'feel', 'same', 'way', '25', 'years', 'later']",N/A
