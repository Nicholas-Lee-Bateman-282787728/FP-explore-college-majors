207661,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213080,Brian Overland,"[1, 1]","Past reviewers have labeled this episode as too slow or touchy-feely. In truth, ""Mudd's Women,"" along with other first-season episodes, reveals the extraordinary flexibility of the Star Trek format. It uses a sci-fi element -- that of the Venus drug -- but is at heart a very human story.It is also wickedly funny. The Enterprise chases a thief and con man into an asteroid field, in the process damaging Enterprise shields and depleting its fuel (called ""lithium"" crystals rather than ""di-lithium"" crystals as in later episodes). The con man is Harry Mudd (the late, great Roger Carmel), the most colorful liar and cheater this side of Andromeda.Mudd has valuable cargo: three sirens, who make McCoy's scanners go ""bleep"" and who make every male Enterprise crew member salivate (except for Spock, who views the proceedings with decidely un-Vulcanlike amusement). Mudd uses the women as bargaining chips with three lonely lithium miners, who hold the Enterprise hostage until Kirk drops charges against Harry Mudd.Admittedly, the episode is less action-packed than some, having no fist-fights or monsters in a rubber suit. This is Star Trek for adults. Though there is an attraction between Kirk and one of the women, named Eve, he acts like a responsible leader rather than going into seduction mode as he would in later seasons.In the end, he turns psychologist, revealing the episode's message: the women never needed the Venus drug if they had belief in themselves. There is also a subplot involving Eve and one of the miners, showing her to be not a sex object but a three-dimensional person. This episode begins with an adolescent approach to sexuality and ends with an adult one.

207662,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213080,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","No matter where humans go and how sophisticated our technology becomes, affairs of the heart will remain. As humans become scattered on several planets and the time to pass from one settlement to another gets greater, an old problem will arise once more. Women and men, isolated on separate planets, will want to meet each other with the purpose being matrimony. Throughout the history of the human species, a great deal of the early development of new areas has been engineered by entrepreneurial rogues. There is no reason to believe that the human movement into space will be any different on both counts.A small ship tries to evade the Enterprise and they give chase. The ship goes into an asteroid field and is destroyed, although the people on board are saved. However, the Enterprise burns out all of its dilithium crystals in the rescue and the crew is forced to rely on their limited battery reserves. The captain of the ship turns out to be a scoundrel called Harry Mudd, who seems incapable of telling the truth about anything and the other three people are wildly attractive women. Their very presence has a hypnotic quality on the men. They are in fact Mudd's cargo, as he is transporting them to other colonies so that they can find husbands. Bored and isolated on their home planets, they willingly left with Mudd so they could look for mates. Their sex appeal is artificial, generated by Venus drugs.Damaged and with limited power, the Enterprise makes for a mining colony where they can replenish their crystals. However, Mudd contacts the miners first and they refuse to part with the crystals unless they can meet with Mudd's women. Of course, they fall for the women and a stand-off ensues, as Kirk refuses to trade the women for the crystals. One of the women (Eve) breaks down under the strain and after a further test of wills, the truth about the drugs comes out. In a ruse, Kirk demonstrates that the women always possessed their sex appeal, as Eve downs a placebo rather than the drug. Eve, thinking she had ingested the drug, turns the charm back on until told that she had that talent all along. The leader of the miners then gives Kirk the crystals and the Enterprise leaves with Mudd in custody.On one level this is a fun episode, Harry Mudd is a character that appeared one other time in a guest- starring role and should have appeared more often. Had the producers done it right, they could have developed a character with recurrent fan appeal similar to that of `Q' on TNG. The one serious flaw in the episode is when the miners refuse to turn dilithium crystals over to the Enterprise. The ship is crippled and will spiral into the atmosphere without the crystals. This would have made their refusal to turn them over an act of mass murder and even the most testosterone-addled male brain would have known that. Nevertheless, the scene of the hearing where Mudd is being tried is a classic one. When the computer begins describing the physiological reactions in the male members of the review board it is one of the funniest, understated scenes in the entire series.",4,Some things will not change in space,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,3100,"['matter', 'where', 'humans', 'go', 'how', 'sophisticated', 'technology', 'affairs', 'heart', 'will', 'remain', 'humans', 'become', 'scattered', 'several', 'planets', 'time', 'pass', 'one', 'settlement', 'greater', 'old', 'problem', 'will', 'arise', 'once', 'more', 'Women', 'men', 'isolated', 'separate', 'planets', 'will', 'want', 'meet', 'other', 'purpose', 'being', 'matrimony', 'history', 'human', 'species', 'great', 'deal', 'early', 'development', 'new', 'areas', 'been', 'engineered', 'entrepreneurial', 'rogues', 'reason', 'believe', 'human', 'movement', 'space', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'counts.A', 'small', 'ship', 'tries', 'evade', 'Enterprise', 'give', 'chase', 'ship', 'asteroid', 'field', 'destroyed', 'people', 'board', 'are', 'saved', 'However', 'Enterprise', 'out', 'dilithium', 'crystals', 'rescue', 'crew', 'forced', 'rely', 'limited', 'battery', 'reserves', 'captain', 'ship', 'out', 'be', 'scoundrel', 'called', 'Harry', 'Mudd', 'who', 'incapable', 'telling', 'truth', 'anything', 'other', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'wildly', 'attractive', 'women', 'very', 'presence', 'hypnotic', 'quality', 'men', 'are', 'fact', 'Mudd', 'cargo', 'transporting', 'other', 'colonies', 'can', 'find', 'husbands', 'Bored', 'isolated', 'home', 'planets', 'willingly', 'left', 'Mudd', 'could', 'look', 'mates', 'sex', 'appeal', 'artificial', 'generated', 'Venus', 'drugs.Damaged', 'limited', 'power', 'Enterprise', 'mining', 'colony', 'where', 'can', 'replenish', 'crystals', 'However', 'Mudd', 'miners', 'first', 'refuse', 'part', 'crystals', 'can', 'meet', 'Mudd', 'women', 'course', 'fall', 'women', 'stand-off', 'ensues', 'Kirk', 'trade', 'women', 'crystals', 'One', 'women', 'Eve', 'down', 'strain', 'further', 'test', 'wills', 'truth', 'drugs', 'out', 'ruse', 'Kirk', 'women', 'always', 'possessed', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Eve', 'placebo', 'rather', 'drug', 'Eve', 'thinking', 'had', 'ingested', 'drug', 'charm', 'back', 'told', 'had', 'talent', 'along', 'leader', 'miners', 'then', 'Kirk', 'crystals', 'Enterprise', 'Mudd', 'custody.On', 'one', 'level', 'fun', 'episode', 'Harry', 'Mudd', 'character', 'appeared', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'guest-', 'starring', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'appeared', 'more', 'often', 'Had', 'producers', 'done', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'character', 'recurrent', 'fan', 'appeal', 'similar', 'Q', 'TNG', 'one', 'serious', 'flaw', 'episode', 'when', 'miners', 'refuse', 'turn', 'dilithium', 'crystals', 'Enterprise', 'ship', 'crippled', 'will', 'spiral', 'atmosphere', 'crystals', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'refusal', 'turn', 'over', 'act', 'mass', 'murder', 'even', 'most', 'testosterone-addled', 'male', 'brain', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'Nevertheless', 'scene', 'hearing', 'where', 'Mudd', 'being', 'tried', 'classic', 'one', 'When', 'computer', 'describing', 'physiological', 'reactions', 'male', 'members', 'review', 'board', 'one', 'funniest', 'understated', 'scenes', 'entire', 'series']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 4: Mudd's Women VHS"

And since the Ferengi would not make their presence known for another century in the Star Trek universe, Harry Mudd (Roger C. Carmel) gladly took advantage of any profitable venture that presented itself.  If there still were snake oil men in the 23rd century, Mudd was their poster boy.The U.S.S. Enterprise saves the crew of an unknown ship from destruction.  The doomed ship's survivors beam aboard and are revealed to be Harry Mudd and three beautiful women:  Ruth Bonaventure (Maggie Thrett), Eve McHuron (Karen Steele) and Magda Kovacs (Susan Denberg).  Mudd tells Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) that he was taking the women to Ophiuchus VI to be brides for the settlers there.  However, the Enterprise heads to Rigel XII instead to replace their burned-out lithium crystals.  Once there, Mudd's women are exposed as frauds - their outward beauty was the result of an illegal drug.Well, Star Trek hit a bump in the road with ""Mudd's Women.""  The only redeeming aspect of this episode is its biting commentary on manufactured beauty.  Aside from that, it is boring, slow, and tedious.
