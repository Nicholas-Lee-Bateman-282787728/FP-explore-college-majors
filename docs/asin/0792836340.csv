136887,A6KEOAX09Z89L,0792836340,Amidonian,"[4, 4]","Christmas is merely a backdrop for what is a deeper and well done movie about family dynamics. Sam Elliott gives a masterful performance playing a tough Dad in a tough situation. He's unable to explain or express his emotions - his wife has died recently and he cannot make enough money from his apple farm to support his daughter and her older brother. He has tough decisions ahead and is grittily bound by the realities of his Earthly life.His daughter, meanwhile, is full of wonder, unbounded joy and optimism. The contrast between her world and his is striking, as Elliott reaches the point where he decides he has to send his daughter away to live with the aunt, because he simply can't provide for her.Being a father, this hits home real deep.There are many other layers to the film and many twists and turns along the way. But beyond the magic of Christmas is the father's ultimate realization that he can't live without his daughter - she's the one spark of life left out there for him. She, by the power of her incredible spirit, redeems him, heals him, and let's him break down and grieve openly.With three kids ages 16, 14 and 10, I watch and have watched many many ""kid/teenage movies."" A big complaint that I have is that in 9 out of 10 of them the Dad is stupid, evil, clueless, or some other form of the bad guy. In this movie, the Dad starts out as uncaring and unfeeling but there is more of a gritty realism to it. (The  film itself reinforces this - it's cold and somewhat grim and often nighttime - you do NOT get the feeling that this is a ""Hollywoood"" movie) These are apple farmers out in the sticks and they are fighting to make ends meet. They are poor. The Dad is mean in alot of the film but because he is down on his luck and broken through circumstance, not cluelessness. His salvation and rebirth is a big part  of what this movie (and  Christmas) is about.Five stars.",5,Deeper Than You Might Expect,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,1898,"['Christmas', 'merely', 'backdrop', 'what', 'deeper', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'family', 'dynamics', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'masterful', 'performance', 'playing', 'tough', 'Dad', 'tough', 'situation', 'unable', 'explain', 'express', 'emotions', 'wife', 'died', 'recently', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'apple', 'farm', 'support', 'daughter', 'older', 'brother', 'tough', 'decisions', 'ahead', 'grittily', 'bound', 'realities', 'Earthly', 'life.His', 'daughter', 'meanwhile', 'full', 'wonder', 'unbounded', 'joy', 'optimism', 'contrast', 'world', 'striking', 'Elliott', 'point', 'where', 'send', 'daughter', 'away', 'live', 'aunt', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'provide', 'her.Being', 'father', 'home', 'real', 'deep.There', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'layers', 'film', 'many', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'magic', 'Christmas', 'father', 'ultimate', 'realization', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'daughter', 'one', 'spark', 'life', 'left', 'out', 'there', 'power', 'incredible', 'spirit', 'heals', 'let', 'break', 'down', 'grieve', 'openly.With', 'three', 'kids', '16', '14', '10', 'watch', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'kid/teenage', 'movies', 'big', 'complaint', 'have', '9', '10', 'Dad', 'stupid', 'evil', 'clueless', 'other', 'form', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'Dad', 'out', 'uncaring', 'unfeeling', 'more', 'gritty', 'realism', 'film', 'cold', 'somewhat', 'grim', 'often', 'nighttime', 'do', 'NOT', 'get', 'feeling', 'Hollywoood', 'movie', 'are', 'apple', 'farmers', 'out', 'sticks', 'are', 'fighting', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'are', 'poor', 'Dad', 'mean', 'alot', 'film', 'down', 'luck', 'broken', 'circumstance', 'not', 'cluelessness', 'salvation', 'rebirth', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'about.Five', 'stars']",N/A

It is a lovely story of faith and love.  Jessie has recently lost her mother, and now she and her brother and father are alone.  Because crops are failing, her father decides she is to go live with her Aunt Sarah, but Jessie doesn't want that.  She proves to her father and everyone around her that she is needed at home with her brother and dad, not with her Aunt Sarah.  She further proves the bond between people in a small town and how they stand up for each other in a time of crisis.Her favorite story is the story of a little girl named Virginia, a true life child who wrote a letter to Santa Claus, and the letter wound up in the hands of a newspaper editor.  She wanted to prove there really was a Santa Claus and the newspaper editor said, &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus...&quot;  This true life story happened around 1900.  So when Jessie goes to visit the &quot;helping&quot; Santa Claus at the mall, she tells him to deliver a letter to the &quot;real&quot; Santa, that she has Prancer and that she wants to meet Santa up on a cliff so that Prancer can be reunited with Santa.  This letter finds ITS way to a newspaper editor, and before long the entire town knows about this loveable reindeer.This is a video for children ages 2 to 102, and I give this movie 5 stars for being so entertaining and wonderful, and for bringing tears to my eyes every one of the 100 or more times I've seen it.",5,"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus",978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1553,"['Prancer', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Jessie', 'love', 'injured', 'reindeer', 'whom', 'Santa', 'reindeer', 'Prancer', 'lovely', 'story', 'faith', 'love', 'Jessie', 'recently', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'brother', 'father', 'are', 'alone', 'crops', 'are', 'failing', 'father', 'go', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Sarah', 'Jessie', ""n't"", 'want', 'father', 'everyone', 'needed', 'home', 'brother', 'dad', 'not', 'Aunt', 'Sarah', 'further', 'bond', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'other', 'time', 'crisis.Her', 'favorite', 'story', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Virginia', 'true', 'life', 'child', 'who', 'wrote', 'letter', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'letter', 'wound', 'up', 'hands', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'wanted', 'prove', 'really', 'was', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'said', 'quot', 'Yes', 'Virginia', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'quot', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'happened', '1900', 'So', 'when', 'Jessie', 'visit', 'quot', 'helping', 'quot', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'mall', 'deliver', 'letter', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Santa', 'Prancer', 'meet', 'Santa', 'up', 'cliff', 'Prancer', 'can', 'be', 'reunited', 'Santa', 'letter', 'ITS', 'way', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'long', 'entire', 'town', 'loveable', 'reindeer.This', 'video', 'children', '2', '102', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'so', 'entertaining', 'wonderful', 'bringing', 'tears', 'eyes', 'one', '100', 'more', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

136897,APXZRLC8LO165,0792836340,Carly,"[3, 3]","""Prancer is one of the sweetest holiday movies I have ever seen, and also one of my favorites. It is very sensitive and captures those precious and heartwarming aspects of Christmas that make a good holiday film. I remember watching this with my mom when I was younger, and we still like to pull it out during the Christmas season; it will always be special to us.The story is simple yet enchanting: a gruff, headstrong, and somewhat distant single father is trying to keep up his declining farm as he struggles to raise his two young children. His 8-year-old daughter Jessica, the evident strength of the family, is a lonely yet faithful little girl trying to cope with her mother's death while doing her best to keep the spirit alive for the approaching holiday season. When she finds an injured reindeer in the forest, she clings to the idea that it is Santa's ""Prancer,"" and she takes it upon herself to bring him home and nurse him back to health so that Santa can come for him on Christmas Eve. Prancer becomes a friend and a source of comfort as Jessica struggles to make believers out of her family and friends; however, when Jessica is injured herself and loses much of her faith in Prancer, it is the people around her who must convince her to once again believe in the magic of Christmas.The storyline is beautiful, and the acting is strong. Little Rebecca Harrell is perhaps one of the most endearing child actresses I have seen in any film. Her personality and strength of character with the role of Jessica in this movie is different than what you typically see; she will melt your heart and warm your soul. Sam Elliott is also very consistent and good in his very complex and difficult role as Jessica's father, a seemingly hard man with a special softness deep inside that only his spirited little daughter can bring out. The other actors and actresses help hold the movie together and make it the endearing family film that it is. This is truly a very special holiday film that the WHOLE family can watch together and enjoy, and I recommend it for the upcoming holiday season!!!!",5,wonderful family choice for the holidays,1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,2096,"['Prancer', 'one', 'sweetest', 'holiday', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'one', 'favorites', 'very', 'sensitive', 'captures', 'precious', 'heartwarming', 'aspects', 'Christmas', 'make', 'good', 'holiday', 'film', 'remember', 'watching', 'mom', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'still', 'pull', 'out', 'Christmas', 'season', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'special', 'us.The', 'story', 'simple', 'yet', 'enchanting', 'gruff', 'headstrong', 'somewhat', 'distant', 'single', 'father', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'declining', 'farm', 'raise', 'two', 'young', 'children', '8-year-old', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'evident', 'strength', 'family', 'lonely', 'yet', 'faithful', 'little', 'girl', 'trying', 'cope', 'mother', 'death', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'spirit', 'alive', 'approaching', 'holiday', 'season', 'When', 'injured', 'reindeer', 'forest', 'idea', 'Santa', 'Prancer', 'bring', 'home', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'so', 'Santa', 'can', 'come', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Prancer', 'friend', 'source', 'comfort', 'Jessica', 'make', 'believers', 'family', 'friends', 'however', 'when', 'Jessica', 'injured', 'much', 'faith', 'Prancer', 'people', 'who', 'must', 'convince', 'once', 'again', 'believe', 'magic', 'Christmas.The', 'storyline', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'strong', 'Little', 'Rebecca', 'Harrell', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'child', 'actresses', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'personality', 'strength', 'character', 'role', 'Jessica', 'movie', 'different', 'what', 'typically', 'see', 'will', 'melt', 'heart', 'warm', 'soul', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'also', 'very', 'consistent', 'good', 'very', 'complex', 'difficult', 'role', 'Jessica', 'father', 'seemingly', 'hard', 'man', 'special', 'softness', 'deep', 'inside', 'only', 'spirited', 'little', 'daughter', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'help', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'make', 'endearing', 'family', 'film', 'truly', 'very', 'special', 'holiday', 'film', 'WHOLE', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'enjoy', 'recommend', 'upcoming', 'holiday', 'season']",N/A

Not only do I admire it for the acting and the plot, but I also love the atmosphere and the scenery. This isn't a loud, bombastic Christmas tale that's filled with cheer. This is a very tranquil film that's filled with beautiful scenery. The shots of the silent, solemn winter woods is something that you don't usually see in today's family features. The mysterious reindeer is also a sight to see when it slowly wanders in one of the coldest realms of nature.Rebecca Harrell, who plays Jessica, is still spectacular when seen onscreen. Her chemistry with her father (Sam Elliot) and a veterinarian (Abe Vigoda) really makes the film even better. I'm still wondering whatever happened to the actress after this film was released.So I would say that ""Prancer"" is a beautiful family film.

In keeping with other classic films like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' the production's realism in 'Prancer' stirs our emotions into repeated viewing and holds our interest, as we escape into someone's else's difficulties other than our own for awhile. We figure, if they can make it through a cold harsh winter, then perhaps there's hope for us, too.On a subliminal emotional level, hard times effect us all, no matter what our economic, social or familial status might be. Identifying with life's difficulties has become routine, even for those who purportedly have it all. If life were always easy street, then one would just not really be experiencing life. Just like daily consumption becomes boring, it's nice when positive incentives come around now and then to take off the edge and the struggle we all face. Reaping the fruits of our labor lifts us and is well worth the wait. Still, family is more important than money, pleasure, self-indulgence and things.There are many little glimpses of metaphors during the film and, because they are not in your face, it makes for a compelling piece. The nighttime setting throughout most of the film adds to the sobering, yet opposite homey and warm feeling mood of the film. It symbolizes that, no matter how cold it is outside and how rough it may get, there is always someone, somewhere who will be there to protect you, care for you, and invite you in; even when hope seems like it will indefinitely remain aloof and elusive. Looking outside ourselves by reaching out to others' human need gives us sense and purpose, often healing our own personal grief and hopelessness.",5,Prancer Is a Great Christmas Film for the Entire Family,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,1752,"['classic', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'have', 'family', 'collection', 'including', 'Blu-ray', 'versions', 'one', 'always', 'return', 'keeping', 'other', 'classic', 'films', ""'It"", 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'production', 'realism', ""'Prancer"", 'stirs', 'emotions', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'interest', 'escape', 'someone', 'else', 'difficulties', 'other', 'own', 'awhile', 'figure', 'can', 'make', 'cold', 'harsh', 'winter', 'then', 'perhaps', 'hope', 'subliminal', 'emotional', 'level', 'hard', 'times', 'effect', 'matter', 'what', 'economic', 'social', 'familial', 'status', 'might', 'be', 'Identifying', 'life', 'difficulties', 'become', 'routine', 'even', 'who', 'purportedly', 'have', 'life', 'were', 'always', 'easy', 'street', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'experiencing', 'life', 'Just', 'daily', 'consumption', 'boring', 'nice', 'when', 'positive', 'incentives', 'come', 'around', 'now', 'then', 'take', 'off', 'edge', 'struggle', 'face', 'Reaping', 'fruits', 'labor', 'lifts', 'well', 'wait', 'Still', 'family', 'more', 'important', 'money', 'pleasure', 'self-indulgence', 'are', 'many', 'little', 'glimpses', 'metaphors', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'face', 'compelling', 'piece', 'nighttime', 'setting', 'most', 'film', 'sobering', 'yet', 'opposite', 'homey', 'warm', 'feeling', 'mood', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'cold', 'outside', 'how', 'rough', 'may', 'get', 'always', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'protect', 'care', 'invite', 'even', 'when', 'hope', 'will', 'indefinitely', 'remain', 'aloof', 'elusive', 'Looking', 'outside', 'ourselves', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'human', 'need', 'sense', 'purpose', 'often', 'healing', 'own', 'personal', 'grief', 'hopelessness']",N/A

I was wrong.  ""Prancer"" is a wonderful picture, and it brings out everything that is right and good about Christmas.It's the story about a real live reindeer that, for some reason, has strayed far south from its natural habitat.  An 8 year old girl (Jessica) happens across him in the woods, and she is convinced that he is Prancer ... one of Santa's reindeer.  Later the animal somehow gets wounded and mysteriously turns up at Jessica's home, where her father ... should he ever discover the reindeer there ... would shoot him.  Jessica decides to nurse Prancer back to health (in secret) and then return him to Santa in time for his important Christmas Eve trip.The reindeer has the title role here, but the girl who plays Jessica (Rebecca Harrell) is the star of the movie.  She gives a very believable and very touching performance, and, if you have a heart ... no matter how small ... she will find it, take it with her, and put it in the pocket of her winter coat ... the very same pocket where she keeps her ... spare halo.She is surrounded by some pretty good performers here.  Sam Elliott plays her dad, and he is excellent, though a bit scary for the first ... 95% of the movie.  Cloris Leachman plays an eccentric old shut-in whose life is touched by the little girl.  Abe Vigoda is excellent (in a small part) as the veterinarian, and Michael Constantine (in an even smaller part) plays a department store Santa.""Prancer"" never falls into the ""mushy"" trap ... which would have been easy to do.  Everything is kept realistic and believable, which is likely due to the efforts of the director, John Hancock.  The setting is small town America in winter (Vermont maybe?) and everything that is shown to us rings true.But ""Prancer"" can legitimately be called a Christmas classic ... a movie that families (and those wishing to have a family) can watch for years to come.",5,A Most Wonderful Movie,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,2003,"['was', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'Prancer', 'expected', 'be', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'unrealistic', 'Christiams', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'Prancer', 'wonderful', 'picture', 'out', 'everything', 'right', 'good', 'Christmas.It', 'story', 'real', 'live', 'reindeer', 'reason', 'strayed', 'far', 'south', 'natural', 'habitat', '8', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Jessica', 'woods', 'convinced', 'Prancer', 'one', 'Santa', 'reindeer', 'Later', 'animal', 'somehow', 'wounded', 'mysteriously', 'up', 'Jessica', 'home', 'where', 'father', 'should', 'ever', 'discover', 'reindeer', 'would', 'shoot', 'Jessica', 'nurse', 'Prancer', 'back', 'health', 'secret', 'then', 'return', 'Santa', 'time', 'important', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'trip.The', 'reindeer', 'title', 'role', 'here', 'girl', 'who', 'Jessica', 'Rebecca', 'Harrell', 'star', 'movie', 'very', 'believable', 'very', 'touching', 'performance', 'have', 'heart', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'will', 'find', 'take', 'put', 'pocket', 'winter', 'coat', 'very', 'same', 'pocket', 'where', 'spare', 'halo.She', 'surrounded', 'pretty', 'good', 'performers', 'here', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'dad', 'excellent', 'bit', 'scary', 'first', '95', '%', 'movie', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'eccentric', 'old', 'shut-in', 'life', 'touched', 'little', 'girl', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'excellent', 'small', 'part', 'veterinarian', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'even', 'smaller', 'part', 'department', 'store', 'Santa', 'Prancer', 'never', 'mushy', 'trap', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'do', 'Everything', 'kept', 'realistic', 'believable', 'likely', 'due', 'efforts', 'director', 'John', 'Hancock', 'setting', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'winter', 'Vermont', 'maybe', 'everything', 'shown', 'rings', 'Prancer', 'can', 'legitimately', 'be', 'called', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'movie', 'families', 'wishing', 'have', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'years', 'come']",N/A

The eight-year-old knows things are hard at home.  After all, her mother had died and her father John (Sam Elliott) is having a hard time making ends meet on the family apple farm.One day, Jessica sees a reindeer roaming through the woods.  She immediately decides it is Prancer since it looks like a picture she has of Santa's reindeer and since she saw the plastic Prancer fall from the town's Christmas display a few days ago.When she finds the reindeer again a few days later in the family barn, she quickly moves him to the shed and tries to nurse him back to health in time to join Santa on Christmas Eve.  Can she do it without her father finding out?  Is it really Prancer?I've been meaning to watch this film since it came out 20 years ago and finally sat down and did just that.  I will admit it was much more serious then I expected it to be.  Jessica's home life is pretty serious with John even thinking it might be better if she went to live with her aunt.  Additionally, there is a strong theme about faith and reality, played out most obviously when Jessica's best friend announces she no longer believes in Santa or God.And yet this movie isn't all sadness.  Jessica's enthusiasm and faith is actually heart warming.  And her spirit rubs off on several characters of the course of the movie.  I especially enjoyed the scenes with Cloris Leachman's hermit of a neighbor.  The ending is completely satisfying.  In fact, I bet it would be hard to watch it and not be moved to tears (in a good way).If you want something different with a bit of a serious bent to it, check this movie out.

There are plenty of those.This is a dark fable about redemption.A lonely eight year old girl named Jessica discovers a mysterious and injured raindeer in the forest and is convinced that it's Prancer, Santa's own. She's determiined  to nurse it back to health by hook or by crook and to return it to Santa before Christmas day.Her mother has died recently and her father is having troubles with their failing farm, along with now having to raise a young daughter and son all alone in rural Michigan. He has become embittered with his lot in life.However,  innocent Jessica has a special kind of faith and hope and belief that's all her own during this trying holiday season. And, unexpectedly,  their small town cannot help but sit up and take notice.This film seems more or less geared toward kids as well as  adults due to the honest grief that's depicted in some scenes.The winter scenery is lovely to behold.Jessica never loses faith in her belief, and her father soon rediscovers something about his daughter and himself that he had been too stubborn to admit to her or to even to himself.It's been said that the magic of Christmas resides in the heart of a child.

This movie follows the same pattern and improves on it. (An innocent child is having a difficult life; a child hood fantasy intervenes; the child's dedication to their childhood fantasy influences the people around them for the better.) The scenery is gorgeous, and the music (without a lot of effects) is perfect. Sam Elliott performs his role to perfection. While he seems harsh and stern, his behavior is understandable. We can see that he deeply misses his wife, and that he is struggling to support his children. The scene where Jessica spends time with her mother's picture is short but well done. It is interesting how Jessica is able to link her faith in heaven with her belief in Santa. Also notable is the fact that even though the people in town probably do not believe (at first anyway) that the reindeer is Santa's, they are deeply moved by Jessica's dedication to it. One deeply moving scene is when Jessica is desperate to make money to feed Prancer. Her fear of Cloris Leachman has already been established, and she dares another meeting to Cloris when she becomes desperate for the reindeer's well being. It is also moving that we get to know Cloris, and she too is moved by Jessica to the point that she reenters society. The ending where the reindeer's role reconciles Jessica and her father is infinitely touching. (In &quot;E.T.&quot; too much of the plot revolves around E.T.'s role as an alien. In this movie the situation between Jessica and the people around her is more emphasized. The reindeer accomplishes his purpose without stealing the movie. Even when we find out that the reindeer really is Prancer, the scene is done short and exquisitely. We see Santa's sleigh fly by, and the plot returns to Jessica and her father.) My only complaint about this movie is that Cloris Leachman could have been explained more. The author would have done good to tell us (even if only briefly) why she lives the way she does. If the author had done this, I would have considered this an exquisite masterpiece. This is probably one of the best Christmas movies ever made.",4,E.T. Who?
