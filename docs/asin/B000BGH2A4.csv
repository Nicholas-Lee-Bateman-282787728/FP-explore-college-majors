941786,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000BGH2A4,Adam Craig,"[3, 9]","While Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is ultimately a fairly good movie, it definitely isn't a fun or good experience to sit through.  The plot to the film is so complicated that it really is tough to keep up with, even though there really isn't that much going on throughout most of the film.Basically, Ryu and his girlfriend live with Ryu's sister who is sick with a kidney problem and needs a transplant.  Ryu, who is deaf, is not the same blood type as his sister, so in desperation to save her he signs up to buy a kidney on the black market.  The organ sellers take Ryu's kidney and all his money, and then when a ""miracle"" happens and a donor is found for Ryu's sister, he doesn't have the money to pay for the operation.  To try and get the money, Ryu and his sister plan a kidnapping of his boss's daughter, and when just about everything goes wrong, Ryu and his boss go their own journeys of vengeance that are bound to meet...If you thought just that synopsis was hard to follow, try watching the actual movie.  Some stuff doesn't even really make sense.  For example, when Ryu's sister makes a devastating choice, we don't even really know or understand how she came to the conclusion that led her make the choice.  She finds a discharge notice in Ryu's pants, and the next thing we know she has figured out the entire plot, including the kidnapping.It just didn't seem right that a movie specifically about vengeance, even with that word in its name, took about a full half of the movie to get to any supposed vengeance by any characters.  I get Park's message that vengeance wreaks havoc on all those involved, but ultimately this movie was too much of a downer.  Oldboy at least had an extremely interesting story, whereas a film like this, I believe, relies on the revenge emotion to garner any response from its audience.The violence is very gruesome and, some would say, very excessive.  But I still believe that Park has a method to his madness, and the gruesome violence is there for a purpose.  Park could be a great filmmaker, but there are definitely some kinks that need to be worked out.",2,(2.5) Just too slow to create any momentum,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2107,"['Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'ultimately', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'fun', 'good', 'experience', 'sit', 'plot', 'film', 'so', 'complicated', 'really', 'tough', 'keep', 'up', 'even', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'going', 'most', 'film.Basically', 'Ryu', 'girlfriend', 'live', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'who', 'sick', 'kidney', 'problem', 'transplant', 'Ryu', 'who', 'deaf', 'not', 'same', 'blood', 'type', 'sister', 'so', 'desperation', 'save', 'signs', 'buy', 'kidney', 'black', 'market', 'organ', 'sellers', 'take', 'Ryu', 'kidney', 'money', 'then', 'when', 'miracle', 'happens', 'donor', 'found', 'Ryu', 'sister', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'pay', 'operation', 'try', 'get', 'money', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'plan', 'kidnapping', 'boss', 'daughter', 'when', 'just', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Ryu', 'boss', 'go', 'own', 'journeys', 'vengeance', 'are', 'bound', 'meet', 'thought', 'just', 'synopsis', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'try', 'watching', 'actual', 'movie', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'when', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'devastating', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'know', 'understand', 'how', 'came', 'conclusion', 'led', 'make', 'choice', 'discharge', 'notice', 'Ryu', 'pants', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'figured', 'out', 'entire', 'plot', 'including', 'kidnapping.It', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'movie', 'specifically', 'vengeance', 'even', 'word', 'name', 'took', 'about', 'full', 'half', 'movie', 'get', 'supposed', 'vengeance', 'characters', 'get', 'Park', 'message', 'vengeance', 'havoc', 'involved', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'downer', 'least', 'had', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'story', 'film', 'believe', 'relies', 'revenge', 'emotion', 'garner', 'response', 'audience.The', 'violence', 'very', 'gruesome', 'would', 'say', 'very', 'excessive', 'still', 'believe', 'Park', 'method', 'madness', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'there', 'purpose', 'Park', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'are', 'definitely', 'kinks', 'need', 'be', 'worked', 'out']",N/A

941790,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B000BGH2A4,Captain Insanity,"[13, 15]","NO SPOILERS:My suggestion is to go into this movie as blind as possible. Don't read the synopsis. Don't read the product desription, or any reviews that reveal too much of the plot. Don't even read the back of the box.  Knock 1 Star off my review if you already did.  The reason I say this is, the movies pacing slowly reveals it's plot, and if you know too much of it already it's going to drag like a zombie transvestite.  There's very little dialogue; which is good 'cause i can't speak a syllable of Korean (and would rather watch the movie instead of reading it); and its bad 'cause it adds to the already slow pace.  It's a revenge story, yes, but not an action movie. It's not as visceral as you would think going in, It's more human, but it does have its small pay-offs.  Ultimately it asks ""How far are you willing to go for the ones you love?"" and, ""If you seek revenge are you willing to drown in it?""The main protagonist/antagonist is deaf & mute. (Don't worry that has nothing to do with the story),as a result any time someone communicates via sign-language, the screen goes black and displays what that person just mimed. (A nifty tool, reminiscent of the old silent films.)(Just figured I'd add that)At its best this movie shows us the tumbling snowball that is vengeance.  There is no definitive villian here.  Everyone has been wronged, and seeks revenge, but its a vicious cycle, and everyone has someone who loves them and will carry it out on their behalf.  At its worst, it's a slow movie that takes way too long to get where its going, and when it finally does, you feel cheated.  Don't go into it expecting alot of blood, and violence,(I unfortunately did),there's some but its so spread out it's ineffective & unfulfilling.  The acting is probably the best I've seen in an asian flick so far.  But then again if there's too much dialogue in one, I seldom see the actors perform.It's a heck of a great story, but it's not a wild ride.

941791,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000BGH2A4,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","Visionary director Park Chan-Wook burst on to the scene with this, the first in a set of three action-packed suspense thrillers dubbed ""The Vengeance Trilogy."" SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE begins with a poor deaf man who will do anything to save the life of his dying sister. When all else fails, Ryu resorts to a desperate kidnapping attempt that ends in the accidental death of a young girl. After her body is discovered, the girl's father sets off to destroy the man responsible for the crime. SYMPATHY's brilliant scripting is only exceeded by Park's stunning cinematography. Every single shot has been intricately laid out to form a beautiful moving canvas on-screen. Despite the fact that the lead character is deaf, Park instills the film with a rich auditory arrangement to compliment his incredible visual style. It is impossible to dislike Ryu, whose noble and selfless actions only get him into worse trouble along the way. This is due largely in part to Ha-kyun Shin's sympathetic performance, as well as the black humor and bitter irony that are written in to his character. As Ryu's pathetic journey draws to an end, the audience's attention shifts to Park Dong-jin's perspective as he tracks his daughter's killer. Here, Park creates a unique division in the storytelling, where the viewers find themselves split between siding with the vengeful anti-hero or the poorly misguided villain. Kang-ho Song enters a devastating and powerful portrayal as the grieving father, a man who is unquestionably justified in his murderous rage.

941792,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BGH2A4,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Despite the fact Oldboy got attention first, Mr. Vengeance actually was the first film in Chan-Wook Park's Vengeance trilogy with Oldboy and recently released Lady Vengeance released afterwards. Watching this film, it's apparent that the talent that we'd see full bloom later here is in effect but it's not quite as developed. It is a film though that does have its moments but ultimately I probably wouldn't put it in my DVD player that often.Deaf and mute Ryu has a sister who needs a kidney transplant and he can't help because he's the wrong bloodtype. So he goes on the black market: 10 million and his own kidney to donate while they find him a compatible kidney for her. But of course that's too easy. Not only is Ryu's money taken but his kidney as well so to pay for the operation he decides to kidnap his former boss' daughter. But again things don't go as planned and both men become tangled up in trying to exact revenge on the other which can potentially destroy them both in the process.While both Oldboy and Lady Vengeance started out slow, there was an interest in the story developing that I couldn't shake off. This film on the other hand seemed to take awhile to really get going. In fact it's not until a good hour at least before the ""vengeance"" kicks in. Some of the scenes develop character, while others exist just simply for the sake of it at times. It's either a film that could've dealt with a more brutal editor or just re-written scenes. It also doesn't have surreal or funny moments that helped lighten the next 2 films mood. There's no ant riding a subway or the inexplicable guy head on a dog's body. Although the revelation of 4 guys...""actions"" in reaction to something entirely different was kind of funny.One of the film's benefits though is a couple of images or scenes that completely stay with you. One, involving an autopsy table is a bit too much but the sight of someone drowned in a river or the cringe-inducing torture of a defenseless woman stays with you. The film doesn't really have any kind of momentum in the scenes though as we kind of zip from one moment to another and not feel a big anticipation. Will you be watching it again? Probably to see if it warrants repeated viewings but initial impressions are you've watched a good movie, it just didn't wow the hell out of you.I'm one of those people that will admit when an excellent film is made but future films or past ones never get that review where you connect the 2 (i.e, it was good but it was no Oldboy).

941794,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000BGH2A4,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","Of Park Chan Wook's revenge trilogy, I had to backtrack after being blown away by Oldboy.  The first of the triptych is Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance (Boksuneun naui geot)With his dyed green hair, the deaf-mute Ryu seems to be a goofy-looking simpleton.  He has an unrewarding job working day-in, day-out at a foundry, but given his condition, he can't be deafened by the factor clamour.  However, he has a kind heart, saving up his money to save his sister, who desperately needs a kidney.Ryu is desperate and takes matter into his hands by soliciting the help of organ traffickers, who offer him 2,000,000 won for one of his kidneys.  However, he is cheated, left naked on the floor with an X-shaped scar on his side.  Now broke and desperate, Yeong-mi, Ryu's strong-willed and smarter girlfriend, plot to kidnap Yusun, the eight-year old daughter of President Park Dong-jin, the head of the factory that fired Ryu.  Yeong-mi's justification for it is simple.  They will demand a ransom and return the kid when the money is handed over.  Both sides win, as the bond between the family and the child will strengthen, and Ryu's sister will be saved.  Unfortunately, things don't go as planned, leading to a series of deaths.The team of Ryu and Yeong-Mi is one of the best things in the film.  In one scene, Yeong-Mi tells a story of a man who thought he had two heads, leading Ryu to ask a question that's funny.  And in a bedroom scene, she's on top, demonstrating she's the more powerful one.  But she's also a romantic as well, telling Ryu that she knew they were destined for each other since the first time their eyes met.What's sad about the vengeance in the film is that there is one death that was unintentional, albeit due to negligence.  From there, the revenge that takes place makes one wonder, ""Why did this have to happen?""  One death is a senseless and cruel electrocuation, another recalls Julius Caesar and the Ides of March, and in another, the killer sadly tells the victim, ""I know you're a good guy... but you know why I have to kill you...""Song Kang-Ho (Park) also appears in Lady Vengeance as one of the two thugs who tries to kidnap Jennie, Lee Gum-ja's daughter and gets blasted.  Ironically, he and Choi Min-Sik, also in LV, appeared together previously in the terrorist thriller Shiri as antagonists.And I can't help liking Shin Ha-Kyun's performance as Ryu.  Simple, a bit slow in the brain department, misguided perhaps, but likable, having to be guided by his girlfriend Cha.And though I didn't know it, Vengeance was the third movie I'd seen Bae Du Na in, having previously seen her in the Korean version of the Ring and as the shy exchange student Son and girl band lead singer in Linda Linda Linda.  As the leftist radical Cha Yeong-Mi, she is clearly the stronger personality between her and Ryu and she alone is worth watching this movie.Oh Kwang-rok appears in all three of Park's revenge trilogy.

941798,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000BGH2A4,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 6]","Director Chan-wook Park made a masterpiece of gut-wrenching sadness when he did this cinematic masterpiece. After I saw this film I could not help feeling empathy for all the characters caught up in this tragic kidnapping gone awry. No film has had such a profound impact of sadness that this film left me with. The character of Ryu, (Ha-kyun-Shin) is deaf, and he has a sister who needs a kidney transplant or she will die. His sister has cared for him all of his life, and now he feels it is his turn to help her. I realize that most people like Park's film ""Oldboy,"" more than this one, but I felt this film worked much better. However, I do like ""Oldboy,"" too! Both are great films.Ryu's love for his sister, who has taken care of him all his life, and is desperately in need of a kidney, prompts Ryu to do whatever is necessary to help her live. However, a problem occurs when he discovers that his kidney will not work as they both have different blood types. On top of this, he has just been laid off from the company he works for. Therefore, he decides to kidnap the daughter of his boss, Dong-jin Park (Kang-ho Song). Kang-ho-Song is one of Korea's greatest actors today in my opinion. He has been a favorite of mine for some time. Moreover, Kang-ho Song played the role of the grief-stricken father better than anyone could have ever done. He was excellent in his role.This film is not only superbly acted by ALL of the actors, but the writing and directing are completely unsurpassed. [SPOILER] I found myself totally riveted to Kang-ho-Song's face and emotions when he is in the morgue and the morticians are preparing the body of his daughter. WHAT SADNESS! And yet this was all an accident. It was an unintentional death. Nonetheless, Dong-jin Park prepares to go on a crusade of vengeance, and at the same time, Ryu is also on his own crusade when his sister dies. The films narrative then veers into a gripping vengeance film, which is disturbing, as both of these protagonists will begin to exact revenge on those they believe were responsible for destroying that which they have loved the most.The excellent storytelling, which Director Chan-wook Park gives the viewer, makes it clear that even unintended actions can and do have serious consequences. Ryu is not a bad person, but events have spiraled uncontrollably out of his own hands. In his own grief, Ryu sees his sisters death as the uncaring actions of those who must now pay. And this is also true with the bereaved father, Dong-jin Park. He too is propelled into a spiral of exacting vengeance on all parties concerned. The ending is truly sad for everyone! I felt complete and utter sadness when the film showed the interaction between Ryu and Dong-jin Park. And especially when Dong-jin Park is telling Ryu that he knows that he is not a bad person, but that he must do what he has to do. Plus, the ending for Dong-jin Park left me completely saddened and drained toward the end of the film. A truly great film, and a must see!

941799,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000BGH2A4,General Zombie,"[4, 6]","Like many others, I'm sure, I decided to check this out after seeing Chan-Wook Park's brilliant 'Oldboy'.  It's not as good as that film, not that I expected it would be, but it's very distinctive and wortwhile in its on way.  While 'Oldboy' is surreal, 'Sympathy...' is a lot more plain and rooted in the everyday world.  Park displays a good eye here, but he's fairly restrained visually, with tons of slow moving, long takes.  The film, like the current 'Munich', is primarily concerned with the idea of revenge.  Unsurprisingly, revenge is not seen as a terribly wonderful idea.  The plot involves Ryu, a deaf and dumb man with a terminally ill sister.  In order to pay for her black-market organ transplant he concocts a kidnapping scheme, which, naturally, does not turn go well, and causes a cycle of retribution which grows larger and wider with each act.  Park resists the temptation to make any direct comment, ever.  No character ever announces the deadly futility of vengeance, at least not that I recall, but the stark, graphic violence and torture of the second half of the film speaks clearly, culminating in the absolutely chilling final execution by 4 nervous, cigarette smoking men.  Again, this isn't a fun film, and it is probably a little too slow moving in the first half, but Park displays real artistry, and there is genuine emotional impact.  You can sympathize with the desires of pretty much every character here, even when they run in direct contrast to one another.  And there is a certain distinct pleasure in watching a film so willing to let everything unfold so slowing and deliberately, frequently with very little dialogue.  Also, the relatively lengthy setup probably adds some more power to the bloodbath that follows. (This ain't an action movie, however.  Not even close.)Again, don't be expecting something much like 'Oldboy'.  This is a darker, more serious work.

There is no clear line between good and evil -- it's merely a conflict between two groups of people who just happen to be on the opposite sides of the fence (metaphorically, this time).There is very little dialogue (Park says he tried to limit it to bare minimum), but the superb acting (especially Du-Na Bae playing the villain against type and Ha-Kyun Shin as the deaf/mute protagonist) and stylish widescreen shots are more than enough to carry the story.This is the first installment of Chan-wook Park's Revenge Trilogy (followed by ""Oldboy"" and ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance"").",5,First of Chan-Wook Park's Revenge Trilogy,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,1081,"['Korean', 'cinema', 'impress', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'JSA', 'Joint', 'Security', 'Area', 'was', 'fluke', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'stomach', 'most', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'violence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'many', 'subject', 'matters', 'are', 'unsettling', 'downright', 'depressing', 'absolutely', 'gripping', 'film', 'however', 'JSA', 'major', 'strength', 'solid', 'premise', 'plot', 'chain', 'reaction', 'tragedies', 'Shakespearian', 'proportions', 'clear', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'merely', 'conflict', 'two', 'groups', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'opposite', 'sides', 'fence', 'metaphorically', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Park', 'tried', 'limit', 'bare', 'minimum', 'superb', 'acting', 'especially', 'Du-Na', 'Bae', 'playing', 'villain', 'type', 'Ha-Kyun', 'Shin', 'deaf/mute', 'protagonist', 'stylish', 'widescreen', 'shots', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'carry', 'story.This', 'first', 'installment', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'Revenge', 'Trilogy', 'followed', 'Oldboy', 'Sympathy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance']",N/A

The direction is so elegant yet so hard-hitting. The simplistic nature of the story makes the descent into hell so shocking and captivating. You don't realize there is no going back until it's far, FAR too late.Ryu is a deaf/mute who works in the loudest factory in the world, doing a really depressing job. His sister needs a kidney transplant, but they don't have the money to pay for it. He cannot give her one of his own because their blood types do not match. Ryu decides to go to black market organ traders to trade one of his own for one that matches his sister.

Everyone thinks their own deeds are justified. Deeds, even the most evil ones, rarely lack justification.The director intentionally takes us into the dark side of humanity. He only films Korea's worst slums. There are organ dealers, kidnappers, greedy industrialists, and corrupt investigators. Slowly, this dark world becomes not of fantasy, but a reflection of our own with no clear boundary between good and evil. It is disturbing to some because we like to see ourselves as good and our enemies as evil. This films begs to differ.The characters in this film share the same flaw as all of humanity. No one can forgive, everyone thinks of themselves as victims who must take vengence for the wrongdoing acted against them. Simultaneously, everyone is impervious to their own wrongdoings.The acting is fantastic. There are several scenes in the film which the main female character talks very quickly while doing a highly adept sign language. To perform a natural looking sign language while acting a complex role must have taken hours of preparation.This movie will disturb many becaue it shows the world in ways many cannot, or refuse, to see.",5,Destined to be a cult classic,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1367,"['Why', 'do', 'people', 'kill', 'other', 'audience', 'asking', 'question', 'many', 'times', 'extraordinary', 'film.Vengence', 'idea', 'person', 'gains', 'moral', 'perogative', 'harm', 'others', 'retaliation', 'evil', 'deeds', 'Everyone', 'own', 'deeds', 'are', 'justified', 'Deeds', 'even', 'most', 'evil', 'ones', 'rarely', 'lack', 'justification.The', 'director', 'intentionally', 'dark', 'side', 'humanity', 'only', 'films', 'Korea', 'worst', 'slums', 'are', 'organ', 'dealers', 'kidnappers', 'greedy', 'industrialists', 'corrupt', 'investigators', 'Slowly', 'dark', 'world', 'not', 'fantasy', 'reflection', 'own', 'clear', 'boundary', 'good', 'evil', 'disturbing', 'like', 'see', 'as', 'good', 'enemies', 'evil', 'films', 'begs', 'differ.The', 'characters', 'film', 'share', 'same', 'flaw', 'humanity', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'victims', 'who', 'must', 'take', 'vengence', 'wrongdoing', 'acted', 'Simultaneously', 'everyone', 'impervious', 'own', 'wrongdoings.The', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'talks', 'very', 'quickly', 'doing', 'highly', 'adept', 'sign', 'language', 'perform', 'natural', 'looking', 'sign', 'language', 'acting', 'complex', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'hours', 'preparation.This', 'movie', 'will', 'disturb', 'many', 'becaue', 'world', 'ways', 'many', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'see']",N/A
941804,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B000BGH2A4,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[11, 11]","Park Chan-wook is known as the bad boy of Korean cinema. Chan-wook is a former film critic who gained world wide acclaim for producing, writing, and directing what has now become known as The Vengeance Trilogy. This trilogy is tied together by common overall themes rather than through its characters. The most well known of the three films, Oldboy, garnered the director a devoted cult following in the United States. While Oldboy stands as the most recognized of the trilogy, the opening installment Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, has been grossly overlooked.The story of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance follows Ryu (Shin Ha-kyun), a deaf and mute man who has a sister that needs a kidney transplant. At first Ryu tries to donate his own kidney to her. However, when he finds out that he has the wrong blood type, he attempts to go through the black market where they promise him a kidney transplant for his sister and 10,000,000 won in return for one of his own kidneys. The deal goes awry, so Ryu and his revolutionary girlfriend, Cha Yeong-mi (Bae Doona), plot to kidnap the daughter of his boss Park Dong-jin (Song Kang-ho).There have been many movies about vengeance, and with only a few notable exceptions (such as Tarantino's Kill Bill) most vengeance films that come out these days feel repetitive as it's all been done before. The brilliance of each part of Chan-wook's trilogy is that they're highly unconventional for movies dealing with this subject matter. Borrowing from whodunit flicks and Hitchcock, in the end you question the identity of the protagonist and antagonist of the story. The vengeance genre always thrives on the idea of gray areas, but you always have a strong sense of who's at fault. That's not the case with a Park Chan-wook film because the bad guy could very well be the one in need of revenge.The acting in this film is equally as brilliant as Park's direction and script. Many people may assume that playing deaf and mute might be easier than working with a speaking part, that couldn't be further from the truth. Having to convey a character's emotions, thoughts, and convictions without uttering a single word or sound is extremely difficult, but you never once question Ryu's beliefs or his devotion and inner struggle for his sister. Song Kang-ho, an acclaimed South Korean actor who worked with Chan-wook on his first film, Joint Security Area and in the acclaimed monster comedy-horror flick, The Host, also performs brilliantly as the tortured father whose daughter is kidnapped by our protagonist.If you still have yet to check out Oldboy, I highly suggest you see this one first. Although if you have seen Oldboy, then make sure you check this out to see where it all started. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is a wild ride. If these movies had been made in America, they would have revolutionized the idea of the vengeance flick forever.",4,Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,2874,"['Park', 'Chan-wook', 'known', 'bad', 'boy', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'Chan-wook', 'former', 'film', 'critic', 'who', 'gained', 'world', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'producing', 'writing', 'directing', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'known', 'Vengeance', 'Trilogy', 'trilogy', 'tied', 'together', 'common', 'overall', 'themes', 'rather', 'characters', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'three', 'films', 'Oldboy', 'garnered', 'director', 'devoted', 'cult', 'following', 'United', 'States', 'Oldboy', 'most', 'recognized', 'trilogy', 'opening', 'installment', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'been', 'grossly', 'overlooked.The', 'story', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'Ryu', 'Shin', 'Ha-kyun', 'deaf', 'mute', 'man', 'who', 'sister', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'first', 'Ryu', 'tries', 'donate', 'own', 'kidney', 'However', 'when', 'out', 'wrong', 'blood', 'type', 'go', 'black', 'market', 'where', 'promise', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'sister', '10,000,000', 'won', 'return', 'one', 'own', 'kidneys', 'deal', 'awry', 'Ryu', 'revolutionary', 'girlfriend', 'Cha', 'Yeong-mi', 'Bae', 'Doona', 'plot', 'kidnap', 'daughter', 'boss', 'Park', 'Dong-jin', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'vengeance', 'only', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'such', 'Tarantino', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'most', 'vengeance', 'films', 'come', 'days', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'brilliance', 'part', 'Chan-wook', 'trilogy', ""'re"", 'highly', 'unconventional', 'movies', 'dealing', 'subject', 'matter', 'Borrowing', 'whodunit', 'flicks', 'Hitchcock', 'end', 'question', 'identity', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'story', 'vengeance', 'genre', 'always', 'idea', 'gray', 'areas', 'always', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'who', 'fault', 'not', 'case', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'film', 'bad', 'guy', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'need', 'revenge.The', 'acting', 'film', 'equally', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Park', 'direction', 'script', 'Many', 'people', 'may', 'assume', 'playing', 'deaf', 'mute', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'working', 'speaking', 'part', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Having', 'convey', 'character', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'convictions', 'uttering', 'single', 'word', 'sound', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'never', 'once', 'question', 'Ryu', 'beliefs', 'devotion', 'inner', 'struggle', 'sister', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'acclaimed', 'South', 'Korean', 'actor', 'who', 'worked', 'Chan-wook', 'first', 'film', 'Joint', 'Security', 'Area', 'acclaimed', 'monster', 'comedy-horror', 'flick', 'Host', 'also', 'brilliantly', 'tortured', 'father', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'protagonist.If', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'check', 'out', 'Oldboy', 'highly', 'suggest', 'see', 'one', 'first', 'have', 'seen', 'Oldboy', 'then', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'where', 'started', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'wild', 'ride', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'America', 'would', 'have', 'revolutionized', 'idea', 'vengeance', 'flick', 'forever']",N/A

For all this filmed was billed as a gory horror, violence was minimal, and certainly not gratuitous, but man......it was good when it happened!The film revolves around the lives of a deaf-mute and his sister who requires a kidney transplant. A kidnap attempt to raise money goes tragically wrong, and much blood-letting ensues. The ending makes me wince to this day. My only quandary with Park is that he holds certain scenes too long. He needs more discipline in the editing room. Green hair playing with the little girl for ten minutes or burying a body for another ten minutes while a very annoying device character and a mentally challenge kid of some sort wanders about causing mayhem, I started to look at my watch. It all comes together in a blood bath of revenge.The performances all around were decent. I liked Du-Na-Bae and felt she was lively and interesting; Ha-kyun Shin also did well considering he had no lines to speak of. However Song was a mystery to me, he only had one moment (the one that I have already mentioned) where I felt he did something worthy of note, the rest of the time his was a non-performance. Aside from him, I think everyone was OK but that the material and the delivery just wasn't there to support them.""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" is a very interesting take on Korean revenge mythology and modern society. But what that take is I'm not sure. This one is necessary for film aficionados, just for the camera set-ups and stunning color. I also think that this film delivers an important message.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[6, 7]","Park Chan-wook's Vengeance trilogy sure does give you a break from the normal film and it makes you appreciate Korean cinema. I saw Oldboy first and I was impressed and it is now one of my favorite films so initially I had to see the rest of the trilogy. First, if you are wondering what the violence is around I think it exceeds Oldboy a little and though most of the film can be comical or even sad at times the violent scenes has its moments. The film is about a deaf-mute man named Ryu who comes off as a gentle guy caring for his sweet sister who is in need of a kidney. Ryu has quits school and gets a job to care for her and though she is grateful she constantly reminds him not to let her become a burden to him but she is everything to him and he would never call her such a thing.Ryu keeps trying to get the doctors to give his sister his kidney but he is not the correct blood type and he is out of ideas. He finds a number for black market organ dealers and they tell him that he must give them his kidney and $10 million won ($10,000) and he gladly gives them both. He wakes up in the middle of a building with a new scar and nobody in sight. When Ryu goes to the doctor the man tells him that they found a kidney but he has to pay $10 million won but he doesn't have it. This sets in a major amount of events from Ryu having to kidnap his boss's daughter to both the girl's father and Ryu going on killing sprees to get revenge on everyone that has done them wrong and basically they don't stop until they find each other.This film is just like Oldboy in the sense that you can read all these reviews or the synopsis all day long and the entire time your thinking darn I wish I didn't read this because this just told me the entire story. You go on thinking the film is ruined because you know everything that is going to happen like you just read the beginning, middle, and end but trust me you haven't. All three of these films has a creative way of turning a person that thinks they know into a person that knows nothing and at the end you find yourself staring at the screen with a hanging jaw. Though I give Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance 5 stars I did have a couple of problems with. The biggest problem being that it moves to future events without making clear how or when something important happened in the film.One example is when Ryu and his girlfriend are planning to kidnap his bosses daughter Ryu realizes that he can't do it because he was fired and he would be the first person the police call in but you never saw or heard Ryu get fired. Another example is after the scene where the two realize he can't kidnap the girl the film jumps to a scene where him, his sister, his girlfriend, and a little girl are playing in a park and your thinking who is that girl with them? The girl is later named the daughter if his ex boss but I for one would have like to have known some details like how they got the girl. Besides those few flaws the film is very impressive, I love the pace of the film though some people might find it to be slow at times. One heads up is to ignore the preview; I think there is one on the Oldboy DVD. The preview shows a crappy picture and is just overall a sucky preview that would turn more people off of it than attract them.",5,The Crazy Ones Are Always Wearing Jackets,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3276,"['Park', 'Chan-wook', 'Vengeance', 'trilogy', 'sure', 'give', 'break', 'normal', 'film', 'appreciate', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'saw', 'Oldboy', 'first', 'was', 'impressed', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'initially', 'had', 'see', 'rest', 'trilogy', 'First', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'violence', 'think', 'Oldboy', 'little', 'most', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'comical', 'even', 'sad', 'times', 'violent', 'moments', 'film', 'deaf-mute', 'man', 'named', 'Ryu', 'who', 'off', 'gentle', 'guy', 'caring', 'sweet', 'sister', 'who', 'need', 'kidney', 'Ryu', 'quits', 'school', 'job', 'care', 'grateful', 'constantly', 'not', 'let', 'become', 'burden', 'everything', 'would', 'never', 'call', 'such', 'thing.Ryu', 'trying', 'get', 'doctors', 'give', 'sister', 'kidney', 'not', 'correct', 'blood', 'type', 'ideas', 'number', 'black', 'market', 'organ', 'dealers', 'tell', 'must', 'give', 'kidney', '10', 'million', 'won', '10,000', 'gladly', 'up', 'middle', 'building', 'new', 'scar', 'nobody', 'sight', 'When', 'Ryu', 'doctor', 'man', 'found', 'kidney', 'pay', '10', 'million', 'won', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'amount', 'events', 'Ryu', 'having', 'kidnap', 'boss', 'daughter', 'girl', 'father', 'Ryu', 'going', 'killing', 'sprees', 'get', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'done', 'wrong', 'basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'find', 'other.This', 'film', 'just', 'like', 'Oldboy', 'sense', 'can', 'read', 'reviews', 'synopsis', 'day', 'long', 'entire', 'time', 'thinking', 'darn', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'just', 'told', 'entire', 'story', 'go', 'thinking', 'film', 'ruined', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'happen', 'just', 'read', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'trust', 'have', ""n't"", 'three', 'films', 'creative', 'way', 'turning', 'person', 'know', 'person', 'nothing', 'end', 'find', 'staring', 'screen', 'hanging', 'jaw', 'give', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', '5', 'stars', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'problems', 'biggest', 'problem', 'being', 'future', 'events', 'making', 'clear', 'how', 'when', 'something', 'important', 'happened', 'film.One', 'example', 'when', 'Ryu', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'planning', 'kidnap', 'bosses', 'daughter', 'Ryu', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'fired', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'person', 'police', 'call', 'never', 'saw', 'heard', 'Ryu', 'get', 'fired', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kidnap', 'girl', 'film', 'jumps', 'scene', 'where', 'sister', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'girl', 'are', 'playing', 'park', 'thinking', 'who', 'girl', 'girl', 'later', 'named', 'daughter', 'ex', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'known', 'details', 'how', 'got', 'girl', 'few', 'flaws', 'film', 'very', 'impressive', 'love', 'pace', 'film', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'be', 'slow', 'times', 'One', 'up', 'ignore', 'preview', 'think', 'one', 'Oldboy', 'DVD', 'preview', 'crappy', 'picture', 'just', 'overall', 'sucky', 'preview', 'would', 'turn', 'more', 'people', 'attract']",N/A
941807,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BGH2A4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[8, 10]","Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) is terrific opening on Chan-wook Park's Revenge trilogy followed by the brilliant Oldboy (2003) and later ended with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005).  Park simply transcends his visual violent story to a deeply meaningful tragedy where the protagonist's painful agony turns into a vengeful cinematic experience.  However, it is within the agony where the film hides its true value, as it offers an opportunity to ponder the excruciating meaning of the suffering.The story takes place in the background of South Korean poverty and struggle for survival where hospital care is beyond the reach for the poor life Ryu, a deaf-mute man.  Ryu's sister also struggles with failing kidneys and must receive care soon or she will perish.  Ryu has dropped out of school and taken a factory job through which he attempts to raise the money for a kidney transplant for his sister.  He also attempts to donate his kidney, but he cannot as he has a different blood type.  It all seems bleak, as the doctors cannot find a matching kidney.  In desperation Ryu contacts black-market organ dealers that will find a matching kidney for his sister in trade for Ryu's own kidney.  As Ryu recovers he finds out that he has been laid off as a result of low company profits and as a consequence Ryu does not have money for his sister's kidney transplant.  Ryu's girlfriend, a Marxist terrorist, suggests that they should kidnap his former boss's daughter for a ransom of 10 million won, which should pay for the transplantation.  However, Ryu's sister finds out that there is no money for the transplant, and commits suicide.The complexity of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance brings forth an intelligent and well-written story that is based on a tragedy within a tragedy.  This doubling or even tripling of sadness compounds and brings an extremely depressing story to the audience.  The depressing theme is augmented through a careful balance between Ryu's soundless world and the deafening sound of factory machines and torturous screams.  These moments of silence and noise are continuously set to aesthetically brilliant cinematography that enhances the visual symbolism projected on the screen, which furthers the artistic perspective on how each scene can be perceived.  Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is an upsetting story that grabs the audience by the throat with a tightening grip that does not let go until the final scene.",5,Brilliant Opening of Chan-wook Park Revenge Trilogy...,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2437,"['Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', '2002', 'terrific', 'opening', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'Revenge', 'trilogy', 'followed', 'brilliant', 'Oldboy', '2003', 'later', 'ended', 'Sympathy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', '2005', 'Park', 'simply', 'visual', 'violent', 'story', 'deeply', 'meaningful', 'tragedy', 'where', 'protagonist', 'painful', 'agony', 'vengeful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'However', 'agony', 'where', 'film', 'true', 'value', 'opportunity', 'ponder', 'excruciating', 'meaning', 'suffering.The', 'story', 'place', 'background', 'South', 'Korean', 'poverty', 'struggle', 'survival', 'where', 'hospital', 'care', 'reach', 'poor', 'life', 'Ryu', 'deaf-mute', 'man', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'also', 'failing', 'kidneys', 'must', 'receive', 'care', 'soon', 'will', 'perish', 'Ryu', 'dropped', 'school', 'taken', 'factory', 'job', 'raise', 'money', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'sister', 'also', 'donate', 'kidney', 'can', 'not', 'different', 'blood', 'type', 'bleak', 'doctors', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'matching', 'kidney', 'desperation', 'Ryu', 'black-market', 'organ', 'dealers', 'will', 'find', 'matching', 'kidney', 'sister', 'trade', 'Ryu', 'own', 'kidney', 'Ryu', 'recovers', 'out', 'been', 'laid', 'off', 'result', 'low', 'company', 'profits', 'consequence', 'Ryu', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'sister', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'Ryu', 'girlfriend', 'Marxist', 'terrorist', 'should', 'kidnap', 'former', 'boss', 'daughter', 'ransom', '10', 'million', 'won', 'should', 'pay', 'transplantation', 'However', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'out', 'money', 'transplant', 'suicide.The', 'complexity', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'forth', 'intelligent', 'well-written', 'story', 'based', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'doubling', 'even', 'tripling', 'sadness', 'compounds', 'extremely', 'depressing', 'story', 'audience', 'depressing', 'theme', 'augmented', 'careful', 'balance', 'Ryu', 'soundless', 'world', 'deafening', 'sound', 'factory', 'machines', 'torturous', 'screams', 'moments', 'silence', 'noise', 'are', 'continuously', 'set', 'aesthetically', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'symbolism', 'projected', 'screen', 'artistic', 'perspective', 'how', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'perceived', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'upsetting', 'story', 'audience', 'throat', 'tightening', 'grip', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'final', 'scene']",N/A

The acts his characters commit are horrifying (the scenes of torture and murder may be more excruciating for the audience to watch than for the characters to suffer through), but understandable, given what's been taken from them. But vengeance doesn't do anything to restore what they've lost. In the end they are consumed by the need to destroy those who have caused their suffering (one anguished protagonist says, ""I know you're a good guy, but you know why I have to kill you, right?"") Of Park's three stories of vengeance, this is the one which most directly portrays its dehumanizing nature, and ultimately this makes the movie itself somewhat inhuman. Although it's not as satisfying as Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is nonetheless a memorable and thoroughly disturbing film.",5,Vengeance begets vengeance,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1577,"['first', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'series', 'revenge', 'tales', 'Ryu', 'who', 'deaf-mute', 'quit', 'art', 'school', 'get', 'job', 'support', 'sister', 'who', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'desperation', 'Ryu', 'kidney', 'savings', 'illegal', 'organ', 'dealers', 'exchange', 'one', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'end', 'deal', 'when', 'legitimate', 'donor', 'found', 'Ryu', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'operation', 'anarchist', 'girlfriend', 'talks', 'kidnapping', 'daughter', 'rich', 'former', 'boss', 'holding', 'ransom', 'get', 'money', 'point', 'movie', 'descent', 'bleak', 'cycle', 'revenge', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'anyone.Unlike', 'most', 'movies', 'use', 'violence', 'merely', 'prop', 'violence', 'here', 'naturally', 'story', 'acts', 'characters', 'commit', 'are', 'horrifying', 'scenes', 'torture', 'murder', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'excruciating', 'audience', 'watch', 'characters', 'suffer', 'understandable', 'given', 'what', 'been', 'taken', 'vengeance', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'restore', 'what', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'end', 'are', 'consumed', 'need', 'destroy', 'who', 'have', 'caused', 'suffering', 'one', 'anguished', 'protagonist', 'know', ""'re"", 'good', 'guy', 'know', 'why', 'have', 'kill', 'right', 'Park', 'three', 'stories', 'vengeance', 'one', 'most', 'directly', 'dehumanizing', 'nature', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'inhuman', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', 'Oldboy', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'nonetheless', 'memorable', 'thoroughly', 'disturbing', 'film']",N/A

It's an initially slow-moving, ultimately very violent meditation on the many ways different levels of society can prey upon each other -- and justify the extraction of sweat, labor, money and, when necessary, a pound of flesh or two.  As the story begins, Ryu, a deaf and dumb factory worker, needs to find a kidney for his dying sister.  Laid off from his job, and  told he's not a suitable donor match, he takes his severance money and trades his kidney to a black-market gang that steals his money and his body part and then disappears. (One well-observed early scene shows our hero in a men's room as a female cleaner scrapes the gang's ""sell your organs"" stickers off the wall. As she leaves, the gang members enter the bathroom, deferentially bow to her, and immediately slap new stickers onto the wall.)  With no job, no kidney to trade and no money to fund his sister's surgery (when, in a cruel twist, a legitimate donor does become available), our hero gets talked into a kidnapping plot by his left-wing radical girlfriend.  Who's to blame for all this? The capitalist factory boss?  The worker who allows himself to be used as disposable ""human capital"" in a society that doesn't offer life-saving healthcare to his dying family member?  The radical socialist outsider trying to take the system down?  The criminals who prey on the underclass in their times of ultimate desperation?  Park Chan-wook doesn't offer clear answers.  (Even the police detective who is trying to restore order to the system is shown to be facing the exact time challenge as Ryu -- he needs to fund an operation, but can't afford it.)  As everyone involved justifies their own solutions -- and takes their own forms of vengeance on those who have wronged them, the movie becomes, as others have noted, a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.It's also proof that, as Gandhi once said, an eye for eye ends up making the whole world blind.",5,Revenge Is (Sickly) Sweet,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,2006,"['SYMPATHY', 'FOR', 'MR', 'VENGEANCE', 'first', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'Vengeance', 'trilogy', 'initially', 'slow-moving', 'ultimately', 'very', 'violent', 'meditation', 'many', 'ways', 'different', 'levels', 'society', 'can', 'prey', 'other', 'justify', 'extraction', 'sweat', 'labor', 'money', 'when', 'necessary', 'pound', 'flesh', 'two', 'story', 'Ryu', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'factory', 'worker', 'find', 'kidney', 'dying', 'sister', 'Laid', 'off', 'job', 'told', 'not', 'suitable', 'donor', 'match', 'severance', 'money', 'kidney', 'black-market', 'gang', 'money', 'body', 'part', 'then', 'disappears', 'One', 'well-observed', 'early', 'scene', 'hero', 'men', 'room', 'female', 'cleaner', 'gang', 'sell', 'organs', 'stickers', 'wall', 'gang', 'members', 'enter', 'bathroom', 'deferentially', 'immediately', 'slap', 'new', 'stickers', 'wall', 'job', 'kidney', 'trade', 'money', 'fund', 'sister', 'surgery', 'when', 'cruel', 'twist', 'legitimate', 'donor', 'become', 'available', 'hero', 'talked', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'left-wing', 'radical', 'girlfriend', 'Who', 'blame', 'capitalist', 'factory', 'boss', 'worker', 'who', 'be', 'used', 'disposable', 'human', 'capital', 'society', ""n't"", 'offer', 'life-saving', 'healthcare', 'dying', 'family', 'member', 'radical', 'socialist', 'outsider', 'trying', 'take', 'system', 'down', 'criminals', 'who', 'prey', 'underclass', 'times', 'ultimate', 'desperation', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', ""n't"", 'offer', 'clear', 'answers', 'Even', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'trying', 'restore', 'order', 'system', 'shown', 'be', 'facing', 'exact', 'time', 'challenge', 'Ryu', 'fund', 'operation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'everyone', 'involved', 'justifies', 'own', 'solutions', 'own', 'forms', 'vengeance', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'tragedy', 'Shakespearean', 'proportions.It', 'also', 'proof', 'that', 'Gandhi', 'once', 'said', 'eye', 'eye', 'up', 'making', 'whole', 'world', 'blind']",N/A

But I had never gotten round to seeing Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, the first film in Chan-wook Park's celebrated trilogy, until recently. It's the one you never really hear people going on endlessly about, and now I know why. Which is not to say it's an entirely bad film, but held up to the others, it pales badly in comparison.Plot: Ryu (Thirst's Ha-kyun Shin), a deaf factory worker, is trying to save money for his sister (Vanishing Twin's Ji-eun Lim), who needs a kidney transplant. Realizing that he'll never be able to save enough with his job, he attempts to donate one of his kidneys via a fly-by-night operation who takes all his money, takes his kidney, and then leaves him naked and shivering in an abandoned building. Worse, he's been fired from his factory job. But there's at least some hope: the hospital calls and lets Ryu's girlfriend (The Host's Doona Bae) know that a donor kidney has been found for Ryu's sister. The problem is, Ryu no longer has the money to pay for the operation... so the three of them conspire to kidnap Yu-sun (The World of Silence's Bo-bae Han), the daughter of Ryu's former boss, Park (Memories of Murder's Kang-ho Song). Given Ryu's history of good decisions throughout the movie so far, you know this is not going to end well...For some odd reason, a lot of people seemed to have a problem following the final fifteen minutes or so of this movie, at least if the IMDB boards are any indicator. I thought they were the clearest part of this, where Park is tying up all the disparate pieces of this otherwise aimless script. And to his great credit, he does a very good job of it, though you have to be paying attention to really get the gist of certain bits. (Here's a hint: you'll want to give your undivided attention to the scene where the cops are questioning Doona Bae's character; as long as you get everything there, the entire ending should work for you without any problems.) But in hindsight, given the scripts for the other two movies in the trilogy, it's obvious that Park, with one more rewrite of this script (which, famously, was completed in a single twenty-hour writing marathon), could have produced something on the same level as Oldboy and Lady Vengeance here.

While watching I was reminded of the best Western directors and consider Park better than any other Korean director, regardless of genre, and the equal of any living Japanese director. I can't even think of a Hitchcock film that I'd put above the craft and storytelling of this film. A telling endorsement is from Film Comment which I used as the title for this review.A mistake others seem to make is to tag this film as ""horror."" Sure there is violence but it falls under the same type category as Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill. Even the title tells you that it is about vengeance, and there are no demons, evil spirits, or even serial killers in the normal sense. If categorizing the film it would be much closer to MacBeth than to any recognized horror film.Others call the violence ""extreme"" but if you're a fan of modern horror or gangster films you can find much worse gore in mainstream releases. Much of it is like Hitchcock in that it occurs either off-camera or in the far background, so that the viewer is left to imagine much of the terror going through the victim's mind. By doing this the viewer becomes more actively engaged so that the scene has even more impact. (Note: if you want pure gross-out violence then try Ichi the Killer, which is also excellent.)Although Oldboy and Lady Vengeance are excellent in their own right,  when put against this film they come across as severely flawed.

That seems to be the motto of the movie, until something terrible happens. a kidnapping turns into a babysitting job that involves a man that cannot hear, and that evolves into a tragedy that makes everything so much more than green. With the accident found out and a fahter's wrath on the loose, a few things begin to happen. People who have some necrotic desires find themselves falling on sharpened blades, batteries seem unchecked until they hook to ears that don't really seem to like this new designer wardrobe, and a knife does things to a person's leg that are horrific to check out. all the while other plots play out, like one involving terroists, a few involving electroshock, and some that involve near-misses. Its certainly not a beautiful day in that neighborhood.Of the three revenge movies, this was the first I had the joy of watching and the one that makes me cringe the most. It has a graphicness to it that makes the torment all-the-more realistic, and the people that are being tortured seem to go that extra mile. That's one thing I can say about the direction here - the body reacts in ways you would expect it to react when put under certain stressors, and this is enough to make you cringe. Place that with the understanding of why the money is needed, what was supposed to happen versus what turns out to be the case, and how terrible the person feels in this and you have a perfectly tortured soul added to the fray. Honestly, i felt sorrow for quite a few of the people in this movie, something I'm not accustomed to feeling, and that told me that the movie was doing a great job. It also pointed out how accidents happen and how little things can become big things when the world spins out-of-control.If you liked Old boy or simply like a good revenge movie with a nice plot, then this will suit you. It has all the staples that a person would want from a nice movie of this kind, including the speed of the movie and the terrible things that befall each and every person in the film. It has no winners - that's another good thing I think people might appreciate, knowing that forgiveness is not a solution and that revenge has its price as well.

Oldboy was released first in U.S. shores, this film was released after on dvd. (When it fact this is the first chapter). After Park's breakout hit ""J.S.A."", the director was finally able to make the films she always wanted to, I've read that Park originally wrote the script for ""Mr. Vengeance"" almost 10 years before he managed to shoot the film. This film was highly anticipated in Korea but received mixed reactions because of the violent content. It didn't become as much a commercial success as ""Oldboy"" in Park's native land.Synopsis derived from the back cover:Unable to afford proper medical care for his sister dying from kidney failure, Ryu (Ha-Kyun Shin) turns to the black market to sell his own organs only to end up cheated of his kidney and life savings. His girlfriend urges Ryu to kidnap the daughter of a rich industrialist Dong-Jin Park, (Kang Ho-Song) who had recently laid him off. Ryu agrees, but unforeseen tragedies turn an innocent con into a merciless and brutal quest for revenge. Bound by their personal losses and deep-seated anger, the two men are thrust into a downward spiral of destruction.Park's direction in this film is very different from the other 2 chapters. His (sort of) minimalist approach to this film is quite unique. He avoids camera panning/movements and it kind of gives the audience an observational perspective, that ends up looking very simple and natural. Close-ups were still used so he didn't shoot it as a strict minimalism, but the close-ups were only shot to convey emotion. There is barely any music in the proceedings until the last act. These are not negative comments but rather I was impressed that Park still managed to convey raw emotion without the usual accompanying soundtrack and camera work. The film is a little slow-paced but the plot did truly evolve because it was structured properly.The style reminded me a bit of Hong Sang-Soo, one of the very strict minimalist directors of Korean cinema. (I've never seen Hong film a violent movie though.) Yes, the film is extremely violent and brutal; there is even a hint of necromania, sexuality and quite a few disturbing images. However, there are occasional funny (if somewhat dark) moments in the film. I don't think it hurts but actually helps the pacing of the film in the first act.The key to this film's success lies in its characters; Gong-jin and Ryu are very natural and the actors who played them were very impressive. The two leads are well rounded and believable, but not necessarily too attaching to its viewers. I really began sympathizing with the two characters; despite their best efforts, nothing works out their way. Ha-Kyun Shin's performance is note-worthy for his superb performance as a deaf-mute; which is a difficult role since his character can't speak, but he did an excellent job since I ended up rooting for Ryu in the first act of the film. Kang-ho Song also delivers an excellent performance; looking into his eyes, you can really feel his pain and anger. Other leads are Ryu's sister (Ji Eun Lim) and his activist girlfriend ( Bae Du-Na) who is always ""thinking"" ahead. The two ladies do their characters justice and also gave excellent performances.The film has the ability to depress its viewers with the very sad premise. Some viewers may be turned off with the violence, it's definitely certain that this film is not a movie for everyone. However, if one pays more attention to the superb performances and the VERY natural direction, I guarantee you will be rewarded. While not as visually stylish as the other 2 chapters, ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" still packs a lot of visceral punch.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! [4  - Stars]I've mentioned in my ""LADY VENGEANCE"" comment that I intentionally reviewed the three ""revenge"" films in reverse. I believe that vengeance darkens the soul and often causes one to lose his way. When one loses his way, one should try to go back to the beginning to avoid making the same mistakes in order to move forward.Also, if you look at all 3 revenge films you will find the following themes; Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is the reaction (losses to fate), Oldboy is the focused channel (pure searing anger) and Lady Vengeance is the closure (leading to redemption). I think there was a reason Park shot all three films in 3 acts because they all have 3 very common linked theme that expresses another tale. This is just my added take, I could be mistaken.",4,VICTIMS OF FATE...An Effective tale of tragedy and more tragedy.,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,4517,"['SYMPATHY', 'MR.', 'VENGEANCE', 'first', 'chapter', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'vengeance', 'trilogy', 'Oldboy', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'U.S.', 'shores', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'dvd', 'When', 'fact', 'first', 'chapter', 'Park', 'breakout', 'hit', 'J.S.A', 'director', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'make', 'films', 'always', 'wanted', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Park', 'originally', 'wrote', 'script', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'managed', 'shoot', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'Korea', 'received', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'violent', 'content', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'as', 'much', 'commercial', 'success', 'Oldboy', 'Park', 'native', 'land.Synopsis', 'derived', 'back', 'cover', 'Unable', 'afford', 'proper', 'medical', 'care', 'sister', 'dying', 'kidney', 'failure', 'Ryu', 'Ha-Kyun', 'Shin', 'black', 'market', 'sell', 'own', 'organs', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'cheated', 'kidney', 'life', 'savings', 'girlfriend', 'Ryu', 'kidnap', 'daughter', 'rich', 'industrialist', 'Dong-Jin', 'Park', 'Kang', 'Ho-Song', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'laid', 'off', 'Ryu', 'unforeseen', 'tragedies', 'turn', 'innocent', 'con', 'merciless', 'brutal', 'quest', 'revenge', 'Bound', 'personal', 'losses', 'deep-seated', 'anger', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'thrust', 'downward', 'spiral', 'destruction.Park', 'direction', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'other', '2', 'chapters', 'sort', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'film', 'quite', 'unique', 'camera', 'panning/movements', 'kind', 'audience', 'observational', 'perspective', 'up', 'looking', 'very', 'simple', 'natural', 'Close-ups', 'were', 'still', 'used', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'strict', 'minimalism', 'close-ups', 'were', 'only', 'shot', 'convey', 'emotion', 'barely', 'music', 'proceedings', 'last', 'act', 'are', 'not', 'negative', 'comments', 'rather', 'was', 'impressed', 'Park', 'still', 'managed', 'convey', 'raw', 'emotion', 'usual', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'little', 'slow-paced', 'plot', 'did', 'truly', 'evolve', 'was', 'structured', 'properly.The', 'style', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Hong', 'Sang-Soo', 'one', 'very', 'strict', 'minimalist', 'directors', 'Korean', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Hong', 'film', 'violent', 'movie', 'Yes', 'film', 'extremely', 'violent', 'brutal', 'even', 'hint', 'necromania', 'sexuality', 'quite', 'few', 'disturbing', 'images', 'However', 'are', 'occasional', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'moments', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actually', 'pacing', 'film', 'first', 'act.The', 'key', 'film', 'success', 'characters', 'Gong-jin', 'Ryu', 'are', 'very', 'natural', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'well', 'rounded', 'believable', 'not', 'necessarily', 'too', 'attaching', 'viewers', 'really', 'began', 'sympathizing', 'two', 'characters', 'best', 'efforts', 'nothing', 'works', 'out', 'way', 'Ha-Kyun', 'Shin', 'performance', 'note-worthy', 'superb', 'performance', 'deaf-mute', 'difficult', 'role', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'ended', 'up', 'rooting', 'Ryu', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'looking', 'eyes', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'pain', 'anger', 'Other', 'leads', 'are', 'Ryu', 'sister', 'Ji', 'Eun', 'Lim', 'activist', 'girlfriend', 'Bae', 'Du-Na', 'who', 'always', 'thinking', 'ahead', 'two', 'ladies', 'do', 'characters', 'justice', 'also', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performances.The', 'film', 'ability', 'depress', 'viewers', 'very', 'sad', 'premise', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'violence', 'definitely', 'certain', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'However', 'one', 'more', 'attention', 'superb', 'performances', 'VERY', 'natural', 'direction', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'not', 'visually', 'stylish', 'other', '2', 'chapters', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'still', 'lot', 'visceral', 'punch.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', '4', 'Stars', ']', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'LADY', 'VENGEANCE', 'comment', 'intentionally', 'reviewed', 'three', 'revenge', 'films', 'reverse', 'believe', 'vengeance', 'soul', 'often', 'one', 'lose', 'way', 'When', 'one', 'way', 'one', 'should', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'avoid', 'making', 'same', 'mistakes', 'order', 'move', 'forward.Also', 'look', '3', 'revenge', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'following', 'themes', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'reaction', 'losses', 'fate', 'Oldboy', 'focused', 'channel', 'pure', 'searing', 'anger', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'closure', 'leading', 'redemption', 'think', 'was', 'reason', 'Park', 'shot', 'three', 'films', '3', 'acts', 'have', '3', 'very', 'common', 'linked', 'theme', 'tale', 'just', 'added', 'take', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken']",N/A

You may have missed this one especially if you haven't seen OLDBOY or LADY VEANGEANCE! This movie isn't as visually spectacular as the two but it makes up for that with raw in your face violence. A story about a stolen kidney and a kidnapping gone wrong. The blood is intense and the action is a little brutal. All in all a fresh raw take on the revenge plot. Great acting, cinematography, and direction.
