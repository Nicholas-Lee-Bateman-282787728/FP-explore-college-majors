1022313,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000IU37MK,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","I don't want to spoil the ending. Apparently it's a shocking surprise you didn't see coming that explains all the events leading up to it.It's about a mother/wife who has a serious problem- she thinks all the worse things that can possibly happen to her family actually ARE happening, even though they're not. Well then again, maybe they *are*. Who knows?The storyline jumps around from one horrible event to the other. In one scene, she goes to put her groceries in the refrigerator, only to pull someones HEAD out of the grocery bag, haha. This prompts her to grab her kids, run outside, and scream there's been a murder. When the police arrive, they look through the house and come to the conclusion there's no murder and the woman is crazy. But this is where things get totally confusing- maybe this murder really did happen and the carefully created storyline made it seem like it didn't.The movie is basically a constant flow of unusual and confusing twists and turns that make you wonder more about what's going on than actually trying to figure out this complex mess. You just never know what's real and what's not.There were other shocking moments near the end that involve her husband and her oldest sons girlfriend. Apparently the girlfriend was the housekeeper all along. Or maybe she made up the housekeeper part.  I mean, maybe the mother/wife made up that part.  Maybe the whole scene with her oldest sons girlfriend jumping in bed with the mother/wife was made up too.No wait, I get it- the entire time the mother/wife was actually killed during that bank robbery in the beginning of the movie!  She never really had a family the whole time- she just made up having three kids and a husband because it was during the bank robbery she questioned whether she made the right decision going through life not even bothering starting a family.  Yes, and the oldest sons girlfriend, the school teacher, the police, these were just people that flashed through her mind in a moment of total confusion.  Yes, this is it!  Sarcasm of course.Hey, that's just one of possibly 1,000 ways to interpret this movie.  Anyway, back to the movie review...Throughout the movie, the mother/wife/psychopath kept imagining what it would be like to see her children much older, and what they would be like as teenagers. Of course it meant as teenagers -since the mother/wife had severe mental problems- each of her children would all go through their own distinct severe problems which would end up driving the mother/wife crazy.Honestly, there wasn't much of anything that made a bit of sense to me. The only thing I gathered is that the mother/wife was so screwed up in the head that absolutely *nothing* could save her. If this movie was designed to confuse the viewers, or make people question what's real in the world and what's just an illusion, congratulations- it succeeded.",4,strange,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2873,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'shocking', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'it.It', 'mother/wife', 'who', 'serious', 'problem-', 'worse', 'things', 'can', 'possibly', 'happen', 'family', 'actually', 'ARE', 'happening', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Well', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', '*are*', 'Who', 'storyline', 'one', 'horrible', 'event', 'other', 'one', 'scene', 'put', 'groceries', 'refrigerator', 'only', 'pull', 'someones', 'HEAD', 'grocery', 'bag', 'haha', 'grab', 'kids', 'run', 'outside', 'scream', 'been', 'murder', 'When', 'police', 'arrive', 'look', 'house', 'come', 'conclusion', 'murder', 'woman', 'crazy', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'totally', 'confusing-', 'maybe', 'murder', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'carefully', 'created', 'storyline', 'made', 'seem', ""didn't.The"", 'movie', 'basically', 'constant', 'flow', 'unusual', 'confusing', 'twists', 'make', 'wonder', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'actually', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'complex', 'mess', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not.There', 'were', 'other', 'shocking', 'moments', 'end', 'involve', 'husband', 'oldest', 'sons', 'girlfriend', 'Apparently', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'housekeeper', 'along', 'maybe', 'made', 'up', 'housekeeper', 'part', 'mean', 'maybe', 'mother/wife', 'made', 'up', 'part', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'scene', 'oldest', 'sons', 'girlfriend', 'jumping', 'bed', 'mother/wife', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'too.No', 'wait', 'get', 'it-', 'entire', 'time', 'mother/wife', 'was', 'actually', 'killed', 'bank', 'robbery', 'beginning', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'family', 'whole', 'time-', 'just', 'made', 'up', 'having', 'three', 'kids', 'husband', 'was', 'bank', 'robbery', 'questioned', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'going', 'life', 'not', 'even', 'bothering', 'starting', 'family', 'Yes', 'oldest', 'sons', 'girlfriend', 'school', 'teacher', 'police', 'were', 'just', 'people', 'flashed', 'mind', 'moment', 'total', 'confusion', 'Yes', 'Sarcasm', 'course.Hey', 'just', 'one', 'possibly', '1,000', 'ways', 'interpret', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'back', 'movie', 'review', 'movie', 'mother/wife/psychopath', 'kept', 'imagining', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'children', 'much', 'older', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'teenagers', 'course', 'meant', 'teenagers', '-since', 'mother/wife', 'had', 'severe', 'mental', 'problems-', 'children', 'would', 'go', 'own', 'distinct', 'problems', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'mother/wife', 'crazy.Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'made', 'bit', 'sense', 'only', 'thing', 'gathered', 'mother/wife', 'was', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'head', 'absolutely', '*nothing*', 'could', 'save', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'confuse', 'viewers', 'make', 'people', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'what', 'just', 'illusion', 'congratulations-', 'succeeded']",Danika

It deals with the topic of the paranormal and with the psychology of paranoia, and had an element of suspense (it's been a while since I watched anything close to a ""scary movie"").Danika is the name of the main character, and she is a wife of three kids (between 8 and 14), a good wife, and also a banker.  The movie starts out with her normal family and work life, but soon the viewer is introduced to the weird premonitions, the visions, and paranoid/fear-filled feelings Danika experiences.  The movie turns out to show how these feelings, these gut-feelings can be truly a gift or a plague in Danika's life and the lives of those in her life.The fine line between a dream/daydream and reality is inter-sliced by the director in a very cunning way (kudos).  It's a scary thing to have visions, but this movie shows that it's more scary to have those visions come true.  Danika's 7th sense (6th being intuition) of paranoia/fear is something she cannot escape, and has to learn to deal with before she becomes enmeshed by it.The moral of this story, for me, is:always trust your gut instinct, but remember that there is a fine line between paranoia and the fear of an event happening .... Also everyone of us has to define that line for him/herself.  For Monika, it looks as if her fears have sabotaged her life, because she ""cannot protect everyone in her life.""",3,Always trust your gut feeling - the 7th sense,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1608,"['Always', 'trust', 'gut', 'feeling', '7th', 'sense', '90', 'minutes', 'RATING', '3.25', 'stars', 'plot', 'was', 'kind', 'confusing', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'abrupt', 'rented', 'movie', 'local', 'family-run', 'DVD', 'rental', 'plot', 'described', 'jacket', 'intrigued', 'topic', 'paranormal', 'psychology', 'paranoia', 'had', 'element', 'suspense', 'been', 'while', 'watched', 'anything', 'close', 'scary', 'movie', '.Danika', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'three', 'kids', '8', '14', 'good', 'wife', 'also', 'banker', 'movie', 'out', 'normal', 'family', 'work', 'life', 'soon', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'weird', 'premonitions', 'visions', 'paranoid/fear-filled', 'feelings', 'Danika', 'experiences', 'movie', 'out', 'show', 'how', 'feelings', 'gut-feelings', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'gift', 'plague', 'Danika', 'life', 'lives', 'life.The', 'fine', 'line', 'dream/daydream', 'reality', 'inter-sliced', 'director', 'very', 'cunning', 'way', 'kudos', 'scary', 'thing', 'have', 'visions', 'movie', 'more', 'scary', 'have', 'visions', 'come', 'true', 'Danika', '7th', 'sense', '6th', 'being', 'intuition', 'paranoia/fear', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'learn', 'deal', 'enmeshed', 'it.The', 'moral', 'story', 'always', 'trust', 'gut', 'instinct', 'remember', 'fine', 'line', 'paranoia', 'fear', 'event', 'happening', 'Also', 'everyone', 'define', 'line', 'him/herself', 'Monika', 'fears', 'have', 'sabotaged', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'protect', 'everyone', 'life']",Danika

1022321,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000IU37MK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[18, 20]","Marisa Tomei has always been one of my favorite actresses.  With that pretty face, gorgeous red hair, and animated spirit, she should be one of America's biggest stars.  She's won an Oscar, for goodness' sake, so no one can doubt her acting abilities.  Why, then, does it seem like such a rare treat to actually see her play the central role in a film?  The woman is fabulous in Danika.  Say what you like about the story (it's one of those psychological thrillers, so audience reaction will inevitably be somewhat divided), but Marisa Tomei turns in a gripping, very believable performance.Every parent (well, every good parent, anyway) wants desperately to protect his/her family, especially the children, so in this respect Danika (Tomei) is basically no different than the vast majority of wives and mothers in the world.  All of a sudden, though, her life has taken a turn toward the surreal.  She begins having awful visions which lead her to seek psychiatric help after what can only be described as a psychotic episode at work.  Not only does she see awful things happening to her husband and kids, she also has psychic-like visions of other kids dying in horrible ways, and these things come about in such a way that she feels as if she could have saved them.  This leads her to become ever more obsessive in terms of protecting her own family, and we all know how teens and pre-teens react to overprotective mothers.  A lesser actress couldn't have played this role effectively, as the story is surreal and sometimes confusing as the tension builds toward a pretty powerful conclusion.As with all psychological thrillers, the proof of the pudding is ultimately in the ending.  It is possible to figure out, to some degree, what is really going on here - I picked up on it from the preview alone, although I didn't predict the final machination of the emotional climax - but I don't think it matters much whether you figure things out on your own or not.  The emotional power of the final minutes is not to be denied, and the whole movie leaves you with plenty of food for thought.  It's the kind of ending that viewers will want to discuss with one another after the fact, and I think that is a sign of the story's ultimate effectiveness.  Any movie in this genre is going to draw one-star reviews from those who claim not to get it, but I think the majority of viewers will find this movie spellbinding and emotionally jarring.",5,An overlooked gem in the crowded field of psychological thrillers,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2438,"['Marisa', 'Tomei', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'pretty', 'face', 'gorgeous', 'red', 'hair', 'animated', 'spirit', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'America', 'biggest', 'stars', 'won', 'Oscar', 'goodness', 'sake', 'one', 'can', 'doubt', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Why', 'then', 'seem', 'rare', 'treat', 'actually', 'see', 'play', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'woman', 'fabulous', 'Danika', 'Say', 'what', 'like', 'story', 'one', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'so', 'audience', 'reaction', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'somewhat', 'divided', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'gripping', 'very', 'believable', 'performance.Every', 'parent', 'well', 'good', 'parent', 'anyway', 'desperately', 'protect', 'his/her', 'family', 'especially', 'children', 'so', 'respect', 'Danika', 'Tomei', 'basically', 'different', 'vast', 'majority', 'wives', 'mothers', 'world', 'sudden', 'though', 'life', 'taken', 'turn', 'surreal', 'having', 'awful', 'visions', 'lead', 'seek', 'psychiatric', 'help', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'psychotic', 'episode', 'work', 'Not', 'only', 'see', 'awful', 'things', 'happening', 'husband', 'kids', 'also', 'psychic-like', 'visions', 'other', 'kids', 'dying', 'horrible', 'ways', 'things', 'come', 'such', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'become', 'ever', 'more', 'obsessive', 'terms', 'protecting', 'own', 'family', 'know', 'how', 'teens', 'pre-teens', 'react', 'overprotective', 'mothers', 'lesser', 'actress', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'role', 'effectively', 'story', 'surreal', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'tension', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'conclusion.As', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'proof', 'pudding', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'possible', 'figure', 'out', 'degree', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'here', 'picked', 'up', 'preview', 'alone', 'did', ""n't"", 'predict', 'final', 'machination', 'emotional', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'own', 'not', 'emotional', 'power', 'final', 'minutes', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'whole', 'movie', 'plenty', 'food', 'thought', 'kind', 'ending', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'discuss', 'one', 'fact', 'think', 'sign', 'story', 'ultimate', 'effectiveness', 'movie', 'genre', 'going', 'draw', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'who', 'claim', 'not', 'get', 'think', 'majority', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'spellbinding', 'emotionally', 'jarring']",Danika

1022324,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000IU37MK,Grady Harp,"[10, 13]","Relatively new cinematic team of director Ariel Vromen and writer Joshua Leibner pounce onto the scene with a surprisingly fine little film that has basically gone unnoticed.  DANIKA is a story that demands the viewer's careful attention and rewards that attention with a finely wrought surprise ending.  This is a tough movie to review: almost anything that is said about it diminishes the impact of a fresh look.Danika (the superb and grossly underused actress Marisa Tomei) is a beautiful, well-dressed successful professional woman, loved by her husband Randy (Craig Bierko) and her children Kurt (Kyle Gallner), Lauren (Nicki Prian) and Brian (Ridge Canipe).  Yet even from the opening scenes we can tell something is amiss: Danika 'sees' disturbing things, terrifying events and people that alter her attention to her job and her family. She visits  a young psychiatrist Evelyn (Regina Hall) who becomes her confidant - the only person who accepts that Danika is witnessing disturbing sights.  A mixture of critical pieces of disastrous events flash before Danika's eyes as well as flashbacks to some years back when her children were young.  Danika overcompensates for her fears by being an overprotective mother, an unfortunate trait that begins to fracture her family.The pace of the film changes to rapid fire events as the reasons for Danika's  visions become clear: we finally see just what made this brilliant and strong woman the victim of a terrified and disturbed psyche and the manner in which each of the characters in the story impacts this discovery is well-illuminated.  The surprise ending scene is a stunner and one that will haunt the viewer.Marisa Tomei makes this very difficult, well-written role completely believable.  She is an actress of enormous gifts.  Likewise the remainder of the cast offers such fine ensemble work that credit must be given director  Ariel Vromen for being a young talent on the rise.  Yes, there are some portions of the film that beg credibility but then that is what delusional thinking is about. This is a tight little film that deserves attention.

I knew that something was wrong with the character but I never expected that ending. Marisa Tomei is excellent as the worried mother. I wish she would be in more movies. The only disappointing part of the movie is tnat it has too much color and light for a thriller. Its colors should be cooler (blues and grays) and not warm as they are.

Marisa Tomei was simply outstanding in this roll and obviously very believable since I still can't shake the film from my head. I was easily drawn into the plot right from the beginning and it mesmerized me until the very end. I never left my chair! It's been many, many years since a film held my full attention and it amazes me that I never heard of it before. But then it's obviously not a mega-dollar production and it seems like that's the only films we ever hear about these days. I HIGHLY recommend this film and since I watched it on Encore, I'll now have to purchase it to add to my movie library. As a side note, I hear so many people complain that some of their favorite movies are not on DVD. Unfortunately, each time movie formats change, (beta, VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray) we lose a few more outstanding films.

I have to say that I am happy I did.  This was a nice diverting hour and a half, although I did figure out the twist ending just before it came.  Marisa Tomei was just wonderful in this film as the mom.  The movie reminded me a bit of Sixth Sense and later of Jacob's ladder, with elements of both.  I was watching this with a sweetie and the film got a real scream out of her while Marisa was putting groceries away.  I was told I should have warned her what was coming.  Heck, I didn't know.  The bottom line here is that this is a pretty good film, has suspense, some gore, and some mystery.  Pretty sad though.  It might take a while to get over this one.

She is still doing movies huh.  I've been a fan of hers since I was little, ever since I first saw her in ""A Different World"", without knowing why.  Now I know, it's because I've had good taste, duh!  She is the most underused and underrated actress I can think of (while writing this review, that is) and wish she would star in more movies.  I said STAR, not ""appear"".  I also like phycological and mental thrillers (fight club, momento).  Although Danika is NOT in the same league as those two, due to the ending, Tomei makes watching it all the worthwhile.  I had to watch it over, because at first I didn't 'get it' .. the ending.  It turns out, yep, i 'got it' alright, I was set too high on my expectations.  Then I read other reviews and saw it is not just in my head, that this movie ""commits cinematical treason"" someone said -- by tensing you up, preparing you for an awesome ending, and then .... blah, unsatisfactory conclusion (but makes sense).

This was the reason for my purchase of this DVD, goaded by the 4 stars, and positive reviews of my fellow Amazonians. That is why I say, shame on you!I watched the film for about 35 minutes, patiently - bloody painfully - waiting for something to happen. Anything to happen. Nothing but disjointed and disconnected scenes washed over the screen, one after the other, yet there was never a story developing.Studies on film of the defragmenting of a character's mind abound, but you have to draw the audience in at some point and give the story direction, even in the randomness of seeming insanity. Its failure to pull the pieces together, as well as the unappealing promise to continue to fail until the conclusion, is why I turned it off, and why, I think, I've never heard of this film.Avoid it like the plague. Marisa Tomei usually takes over any scene she is in by force of will, but here, she is oddly out of place.
