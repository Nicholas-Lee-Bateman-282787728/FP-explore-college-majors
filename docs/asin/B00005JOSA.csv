642744,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,B00005JOSA,Carol Toscano,"[214, 216]","Aside from the fact that this is a Christmas movie, there's universal appeal in the power to effect change in our lives as Melody Parris did in this film.  Luckily, I recorded this movie a few years ago (and re-record it every year so that I always have a fresh copy) because I watch it all year round whenever I need some inspiration on the ""power of positive thinking"" (or positive listing in this case).  In a nutshell, Melody Parris is a perfume counter salesperson at a big department store.  She sells perfume as an extension of a person's soul and she can name any perfume blindfolded.  They call her the nose, in fact.  The passion by which she conducts herself at the perfume counter extends into the other areas of her life. At the urging of a co-worker, Melody writes a heartfelt yet way out Christmas list that mysteriously begins to manifest itself item by item after finding its way into Santa's mailbox. That, combined with one kind gesture to a young boy, unleashes uncontrollable change in her life.  She ends up on a rollercoaster of life changing events (sometimes bad-seeming at first) but ultimately, she triumphs over every obstacle in the way of true happiness in her life.  Her co-worker tells her that by writing the list, she gave herself permission to go for it and make change happen for herself.  There's a lot to be said for that.It's a real shame that this little gem is not out on DVD.  I'm not quite sure what the criteria is for releasing made-for-tv movies on DVD but this one certainly deserves to be released as such.P.S.

Most everyone appreciates seeing the deserving, but overlooked, finally coming out on top and the ones who take others for granted and the self-serving being displaced.  In this case, it's Melody as the former and George, ""Faithie"" and the blonde co-worker as the latter.  The movie makes the point that one often makes oneself the underdog by low expectations, accepting an unsatisfactory status quo for what could be.  Someone said, ""If it's not quite; it's not right.""  We see Melody settling for less than she could on all fronts in her life.  It's interesting that her simple reach, though very fanciful in the movie. began to change things for her. She also had a very encouraging friend. But, there is a principle here.Years ago, I was stuck with some very inadequate furniture, relative castoffs, nicks and damage from a lot of moves, finally settling in one place.  Taking a look at it one day, I realized that everything I had needed to either be propped up or covered up to be useful or presentable.  I wasn't even comfortable having friends over anymore.  I thought in terms of the thousands of dollars it would take, and was overwhelmed at the prospect. I sat down and made a list of the things I needed and then some I wanted.  Soon, I decided to just start, and bought one good piece.  It does something for you. I found a dealer who took $100 off everything I looked at along with other deals along the way.  The prints, accessories, drapes and all that fills in also came along as I moved around out there. Over a course of about a year and a half, I ended up with a full house of more and better than I had envisioned.  It started with a steady stream of additions of one size or another,  paycheck by paycheck, but I also came into some unexpected money toward the end of the period that rounded it off very nicely.  Some years later, I inherited some furniture, until I overflowed, and it was all good.  I actually had to clear out.  My place finally became a satisfaction to me and receives compliments.  It's not the things themselves, but everyone should have a sense of fullness in the areas of their life that have been lacking for a long time, and starting to move toward it has a lot to do with it coming about.

642749,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,B00005JOSA,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[6, 10]","From a literary, cinematic, or theatrical perspective, this film has more deficiencies than one could quickly enumerate. The acting is poor quality, situations totally unrealistic, and the plot close to that of a cartoon. Yet other qualities make it appealing and entertaining - a winner of the classic genre of ""magical things happen at Christmas."" (We all know they do not - and romantics can be sad in this knowledge - but it is rather fun to imagine this on a wintry night when one's toddy is getting cold.)Melody Parris, at the outset, is a good-hearted young woman whose only fault seems to be being somewhat resigned to (what she sees as) mediocrity. There is nothing tragic in the depiction - for example, the beautiful, spacious flat, complete with formal dining area and cosy window seats, is hardly the 'dingy little apartment' the restless Melody describes, and it is obvious Melody is not among the poor. Melody, who works at a perfume counter, is a phenomenon who can do 'personalised scents' by asking such piercing questions as ""Who is her favourite Beatle?,"" though she loses out on a promotion to a 'dumb blonde' of the Jayne Mansfield stereotype. Warm and caring Melody is initially a bit annoying only because she tolerates condescension from a boyfriend who thinks he is a prize and because she can't seem to keep her hair from hanging into her eyes.The entire plot of Christmas List is farcical but great fun. Her young customer's winning a car (and Melody's winning his psychiatrist father) - Melody's mother, a pleasant original, compromising as a sort of Whistler painting to satisfy Melody's wish for an old fashioned Christmas - the model grown fat who suddenly leaves Melody a stash of designer clothing - all are classic examples of what never happens in this life. Yet it is amusing and warm for the viewer because, deep down, though most of us would not admit it 'up front,' we so wish that it could.It is a relaxing film to make one smile, where a little self confidence and wishing solves problems of all sorts (and not only for Melody herself.) I found is especially endearing because, though such themes were common in classic films, few produced in recent years (which are more likely to be bizarre, or centred on dysfunctional children of Santa) have this ability to capture Christmas magic.",4,The impulse to criticise somehow evaporates,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2328,"['literary', 'cinematic', 'theatrical', 'perspective', 'film', 'more', 'deficiencies', 'one', 'could', 'quickly', 'enumerate', 'acting', 'poor', 'quality', 'situations', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'plot', 'close', 'cartoon', 'other', 'qualities', 'make', 'appealing', 'entertaining', 'winner', 'classic', 'genre', 'magical', 'things', 'happen', 'Christmas', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'romantics', 'can', 'be', 'sad', 'knowledge', 'rather', 'fun', 'imagine', 'wintry', 'night', 'when', 'one', 'toddy', 'getting', 'cold', 'Melody', 'Parris', 'outset', 'good-hearted', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'fault', 'be', 'being', 'somewhat', 'resigned', 'what', 'as', 'mediocrity', 'nothing', 'tragic', 'depiction', 'example', 'beautiful', 'spacious', 'flat', 'complete', 'formal', 'dining', 'area', 'cosy', 'window', 'seats', 'hardly', ""'dingy"", 'little', 'apartment', 'restless', 'Melody', 'obvious', 'Melody', 'not', 'poor', 'Melody', 'who', 'perfume', 'counter', 'phenomenon', 'who', 'can', 'do', ""'personalised"", 'scents', 'asking', 'such', 'piercing', 'questions', 'Who', 'favourite', 'Beatle', 'out', 'promotion', ""'dumb"", 'blonde', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'stereotype', 'Warm', 'caring', 'Melody', 'initially', 'bit', 'annoying', 'only', 'condescension', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'prize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'hair', 'hanging', 'eyes.The', 'entire', 'plot', 'Christmas', 'List', 'farcical', 'great', 'fun', 'young', 'customer', 'winning', 'car', 'Melody', 'winning', 'psychiatrist', 'father', 'Melody', 'mother', 'pleasant', 'original', 'compromising', 'sort', 'Whistler', 'painting', 'satisfy', 'Melody', 'wish', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Christmas', 'model', 'grown', 'fat', 'who', 'suddenly', 'Melody', 'stash', 'designer', 'clothing', 'are', 'classic', 'examples', 'what', 'never', 'life', 'amusing', 'warm', 'viewer', 'deep', 'down', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'admit', 'front', 'so', 'wish', 'relaxing', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'smile', 'where', 'little', 'self', 'confidence', 'wishing', 'solves', 'problems', 'sorts', 'not', 'only', 'Melody', 'found', 'especially', 'endearing', 'such', 'themes', 'were', 'common', 'classic', 'films', 'few', 'produced', 'recent', 'years', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'bizarre', 'centred', 'dysfunctional', 'children', 'Santa', 'have', 'ability', 'capture', 'Christmas', 'magic']",N/A
