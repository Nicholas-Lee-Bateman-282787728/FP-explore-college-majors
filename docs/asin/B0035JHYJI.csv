Conagher was for me the strongest of the offerings with Catlow a surprising second. I remember years ago catching a glimpse of Catlow on TV. I was not excited by the 50's looking hat worn by our russian friend, Mr. Brynner. So I was not inclined to watch further. That was my mistake. Perhaps it is my aging but Catlow was a very entertaining film, carried well by Richard Crenna and by Yul's great laugh. Leonard Nimoy's bad guy roll was credible. Conagher was most successful in giving a true L'amour experience. L'amour's moral sense makes itself well evident in this well acted and strong tale of life, strength and loneliness. Sam Elliot was a more mature rough guy with a heart. The Sacketts showed its TV age. It would have been better if it had been longer and the relationships and the diverse transecting events were allowed to breathe. It still was enjoyable, tho' dated. As a DVD compilation of L'amour films it is worth the surprisingly low price.

I especially like Conagher as this movie presents a more realistic side of what the old West was like. Elliott's character portrays high morals and ethics and provides a contrast to his antagonists. I understand that this movie was the project of Elliott and his wife, Katherine Ross, who co-stars in the movie. The Sacketts is purely L'Amour, a bit too much &#34;we are the best&#34; but done with adventure. Catlow is a lighthearted Western pitting two friend/rival men in a game of cat and mouse.

I bought and read 24 of his novels, 3 short story collections, 4 non western books and his first book of poems. Almost all 5 stars.... see my reviews. Louis L'Amour was one of America's great authors and INMO was much more than a Western writer.Louis L'Amour's 3 movie DVD collection on 4 DVDs was spectacular. The best DVD Western collection I ever bought. The color and sound were great. The scene selection worked great on the DVDs.The back of the DVD box says it better than I could. Here goes.The Sacketts""Tom Selleck, Sam Elliot and Jeff Osterhage play brothers who migrate west to make their fortunes in cattle herding and gold prospecting. Each aims to make it on his own, but each also stands up for the other when the going gets tough. And their guns blaze a name for themselves in untamed New Mexico territory.""A great movie on 2 DVDs, lots of action,great acting and a great plot...5 starsConagher""He conquered the range. She conquered his heart. Sam Elliot and Katherine Ross star as a cowhand and a widowed ranch owner who draw to each other when ruthless rustlers threaten his livelihood and her homestead.""Lots of emotion in this movie. Great fight scene, great acting and plot. I really cheered for Conagher and had deep empathy for the widow...5 starsCatlow""A renegade outlaw wants to pull off a gold heist but finds it hard because he's such a wanted man, by the Mexican Army, his hellcat girlfriend, an Indian war party, a vengeful killer and several hotheaded cowpokes from his former gang. Yul Brynner, Richard Crenna and Leonard Nimoy star.""Yul Brynner as the outlaw Catlow and Leonard Nimoy as the killer were great. Richard Creena as the Marshal and Catlow's friend acted great.... but his part INMO had him doing too many bumbling scenes and made to look foolish too many times. A few times would of been OK but too many bumbling parts. I'm not knocking his acting just the way his part was wrote for the movie. Still a great movie...4 1/2 starsTotal 5 stars and the best western DVD collection I have ever watched and proudly added to our family DVD library.",5,Best western DVD collection I ever bought.
