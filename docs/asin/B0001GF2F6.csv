The creators and writers had a rare epiphany and translated it into a perfectly charming TV product. Sadly, the American six-pack and chicken wings viewing public prefers their TV fare packaged and served in the form of easy-to-digest, low nutrition items. As a result, Dead Like Me lived for only two seasons and was cancelled -- a deserving fate for Jerry Springer and Fear Factor, but these pieces of garbage are served with chips and dip.",5,Dead Like Me - First Season),1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,540,"['Dead', 'Me', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'TV', 'productions', 'ever', 'offered', 'most', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'creators', 'writers', 'had', 'rare', 'epiphany', 'translated', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'TV', 'product', 'Sadly', 'American', 'six-pack', 'chicken', 'wings', 'viewing', 'public', 'prefers', 'TV', 'fare', 'packaged', 'served', 'form', 'easy-to-digest', 'low', 'nutrition', 'items', 'result', 'Dead', 'Me', 'lived', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'cancelled', 'deserving', 'fate', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'pieces', 'garbage', 'are', 'served', 'chips', 'dip']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

I wonder if I even saw the same show as everyone else, because the show I saw was a disappointing collection of cliched dialog, stock characters and a plot that felt so contrived I just couldn't get into it.Just so you know where I am coming from, my favorite TV shows of the moment are 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force', 'Da Ali G Show', 'Six Feet Under', 'Strangers With Candy', 'My So Called Life' and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. Compared to those shows, 'Dead Like Me' is quite simply mediocre.The characters are cliched beyond belief...you have the gruff, man of few words(played by Mandy Patinkin), you have your sassy black woman (Jasmine Guy), wacky idiosynchratic english accented 20-something man, and your sullen 18 year old. Really nothing new here at all as far as character types.The dialog is even worse. Frequent voiceovers are provided to describe things we can see with our own eyes.  Conversations between characters are awkward in a badly directed way, rather than in a 'this is how people really speak' way. And, in my opinion the actors are all overacting their parts. Worst of all, conversations were frequently accompanied by a soundtrack as if the producers lacked confidence in the power of the dialog to stand on its own.Perhaps worst of all, I just found the entire concept of the show to be annoying. I can enjoy fantasy scenarios (like Firefly), but this one is just too far fetched and idiotic. If someone has already died, I'm not sure I understand why it is so crucial that they earn money to eat? Are they going to starve and die -- again? I accept plot holes, but this show had so many illogical plot contrivances that I just could not accept the entire concept of the show.The show seems to have its devoted followers, but let my opinion be a warning that this show is NOT universally loved by all who see it.",2,Major Disappointment,1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,1888,"['how', 'universal', 'praise', 'show', 'wonder', 'even', 'saw', 'same', 'show', 'everyone', 'else', 'show', 'saw', 'was', 'disappointing', 'collection', 'cliched', 'dialog', 'stock', 'characters', 'plot', 'felt', 'so', 'contrived', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Just', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'am', 'coming', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'moment', 'are', ""'Aqua"", 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'Ali', 'G', 'Show', ""'Six"", 'Feet', ""'Strangers"", 'Candy', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', ""'Curb"", 'Enthusiasm', 'Compared', 'shows', ""'Dead"", 'Me', 'quite', 'simply', 'mediocre.The', 'characters', 'are', 'cliched', 'belief', 'have', 'gruff', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'have', 'sassy', 'black', 'woman', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'wacky', 'idiosynchratic', 'english', 'accented', '20-something', 'man', 'sullen', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Really', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'as', 'far', 'character', 'types.The', 'dialog', 'even', 'worse', 'Frequent', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'provided', 'describe', 'things', 'can', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'Conversations', 'characters', 'are', 'awkward', 'badly', 'directed', 'way', 'rather', ""'this"", 'how', 'people', 'really', 'speak', 'way', 'opinion', 'actors', 'are', 'overacting', 'parts', 'Worst', 'conversations', 'were', 'frequently', 'accompanied', 'soundtrack', 'producers', 'lacked', 'confidence', 'power', 'dialog', 'stand', 'own.Perhaps', 'worst', 'just', 'found', 'entire', 'concept', 'show', 'be', 'annoying', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'scenarios', 'Firefly', 'one', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'idiotic', 'someone', 'already', 'died', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'crucial', 'earn', 'money', 'eat', 'Are', 'going', 'starve', 'die', 'again', 'accept', 'plot', 'holes', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'illogical', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'entire', 'concept', 'show.The', 'show', 'have', 'devoted', 'followers', 'let', 'opinion', 'be', 'warning', 'show', 'NOT', 'universally', 'loved', 'who', 'see']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

804026,A30638B9S2GOM8,B0001GF2F6,apples2apples,"[1, 1]","Not like me - dead, that is! This is a really cute series - one of those shows you just never forget it's so different.The series, Dead Like Me, is kind of a dark comedy. The series is about a young woman, 18 year old Georgia, who's met with an untimely death when a toilet seat comes crashing to earth from the space station MIR. It's a funny scene - not just because she's hit by a toilet seat which has burst into flames because it's falling from space, but because in an ironic twist Georgia (George) is at lunch on her first day of work, looks up, and sees the toilet seat heading straight for her! At first she doesn't seem to understand she's dead and is in great denial. George finds herself stuck between life and death, appointed to be a reaper - a job she wants no part of.As a reaper George is still ""in the flesh"", but no longer appears as George to anyone who knew her before. She ""lives"" a somewhat normal ""life"" in that she has a job working in an office, but also meets with the other reapers every day and is given her assignment - who she has to reap that day and at what time. When the reapers touch the intended person, they die, and go on to ... where ever it is they go when they die! On occasion one of the reapers is late, or misses their appointment - which has various unfortunate consequences.George never seems to get over the fact that she's died, and keeps going back to check up on/spy on/reminisce about her family - something reapers are forbidden to do. There are some pretty funny results of her doing this, especially with her mother - who percieves her as some kind of stalker after she runs into George more than once lurking around their house. There are also some pretty sad moments when it comes to her younger sister, Reggie - who also can't seem to get over Geogia's death. After George's death Reggie rebels by stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school, and hanging them from a tree in a ""secret place"". It's funny in a ironic way.George's mother, played by Cynthia Stevenson, is an uptight, cold character even before George's death, but afterward takes out her grief on her husband and Reggie. Reggie grows up to be a pretty girl, but she's always kind of alienated from her peers.Minor characters: In her new ""life"", other than being a reaper, George is employed in an office where her boss, Deloris Herbig, is an odd, motherly character. At home Deloris has her own reality show of sorts - which George finds out about when she has to move in with Deloris and finds herself broadcast on the internet! Deloris has an elderly cat, Murray - who's love of Deloris' life.Main Characters: The ""head reaper"" is played by Manny Pantankin (Rube) - who is ideal in the part. I don't think there's anyone else who could play the part so well - as we later find out in the movie - which was a huge disappointment to my husband and myself. The other reapers are played by Jasmine Guy (Roxy) who is wonderful as a hard-nosed meter maid. Laura Harris (Daisy Adair) who is beautiful and stuck up. She was an actress in her day who just can't give up on the fact that she'll never act again. To Daisy all the afterlife is a stage. Callum Blue (Mason) a British con man, who's always looking for a con, and is too good looking even for himself - in his opinion! And Rebecca Gayheart (Betty) a former dancer who's character is happy and optimistic.I originally got the 1st season of ""Dead Like Me"" as a present for our oldest daughter, but she never watched them, so my husband and I ""borrowed"" them. Once we started watching we had to see them all! After watching the first 2 seasons my husband and I searched and were thrilled to find the 3rd season, but then were so disappointed when we found the series ended after 3 seasons.A movie of ""Dead Like Me"" came out after the series ended. I'm not sure if they were trying to revive the series with a few new characters or what, but there were no other shows after the movie. Manny Pantankin and Laura Harris were not in the movie - which was a huge loss. If the series had gone on it just wouldn't have been the same w/o those key characters. We didn't enjoy the movie because it seemed darker, not funny, and just didn't measure up to the series.",5,Not like me ... hopefully!,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,4233,"['Not', 'dead', 'really', 'cute', 'series', 'one', 'shows', 'just', 'never', 'forget', 'so', 'different.The', 'series', 'Dead', 'Me', 'kind', 'dark', 'comedy', 'series', 'young', 'woman', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Georgia', 'who', 'met', 'untimely', 'death', 'when', 'toilet', 'seat', 'crashing', 'earth', 'space', 'station', 'MIR', 'funny', 'scene', 'not', 'just', 'hit', 'toilet', 'seat', 'burst', 'flames', 'falling', 'space', 'because', 'ironic', 'twist', 'Georgia', 'George', 'lunch', 'first', 'day', 'work', 'up', 'toilet', 'seat', 'heading', 'straight', 'first', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'dead', 'great', 'denial', 'George', 'stuck', 'life', 'death', 'appointed', 'be', 'reaper', 'job', 'part', 'reaper', 'George', 'still', 'flesh', 'no', 'longer', 'George', 'anyone', 'who', 'knew', 'before', 'lives', 'somewhat', 'normal', 'life', 'job', 'working', 'office', 'also', 'other', 'reapers', 'day', 'given', 'assignment', 'who', 'reap', 'day', 'what', 'time', 'When', 'reapers', 'touch', 'intended', 'person', 'die', 'go', 'where', 'ever', 'go', 'when', 'die', 'occasion', 'one', 'reapers', 'late', 'appointment', 'various', 'unfortunate', 'consequences.George', 'never', 'get', 'fact', 'died', 'going', 'back', 'check', 'up', 'on/spy', 'on/reminisce', 'family', 'something', 'reapers', 'are', 'forbidden', 'do', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'results', 'doing', 'especially', 'mother', 'who', 'kind', 'stalker', 'George', 'more', 'once', 'lurking', 'house', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'sad', 'moments', 'when', 'younger', 'sister', 'Reggie', 'who', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'Geogia', 'death', 'George', 'death', 'Reggie', 'rebels', 'stealing', 'toilet', 'seats', 'neighbors', 'school', 'hanging', 'tree', 'secret', 'place', 'funny', 'ironic', 'way.George', 'mother', 'played', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'uptight', 'cold', 'character', 'even', 'George', 'death', 'afterward', 'out', 'grief', 'husband', 'Reggie', 'Reggie', 'up', 'be', 'pretty', 'girl', 'always', 'kind', 'alienated', 'peers.Minor', 'characters', 'new', 'life', 'other', 'being', 'reaper', 'George', 'employed', 'office', 'where', 'boss', 'Deloris', 'Herbig', 'odd', 'motherly', 'character', 'home', 'Deloris', 'own', 'reality', 'show', 'sorts', 'George', 'out', 'when', 'move', 'Deloris', 'broadcast', 'internet', 'Deloris', 'elderly', 'cat', 'Murray', 'who', 'love', 'Deloris', 'life.Main', 'Characters', 'head', 'reaper', 'played', 'Manny', 'Pantankin', 'Rube', 'who', 'ideal', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'husband', 'other', 'reapers', 'are', 'played', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'Roxy', 'who', 'wonderful', 'hard-nosed', 'meter', 'maid', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'Daisy', 'Adair', 'who', 'beautiful', 'stuck', 'up', 'was', 'actress', 'day', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'never', 'act', 'again', 'Daisy', 'afterlife', 'stage', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'Mason', 'British', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'looking', 'con', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'even', 'opinion', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'Betty', 'former', 'dancer', 'who', 'character', 'happy', 'optimistic.I', 'originally', 'got', '1st', 'season', 'Dead', 'Me', 'present', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'never', 'watched', 'husband', 'borrowed', 'started', 'watching', 'had', 'see', 'watching', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'husband', 'searched', 'were', 'thrilled', 'find', '3rd', 'season', 'then', 'were', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'series', 'ended', '3', 'seasons.A', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Me', 'came', 'out', 'series', 'ended', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'trying', 'revive', 'series', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'what', 'were', 'other', 'shows', 'movie', 'Manny', 'Pantankin', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'were', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'loss', 'series', 'had', 'gone', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'w/o', 'key', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'seemed', 'darker', 'not', 'funny', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'series']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season
804027,A1ZB49F18WK861,B0001GF2F6,"Arg! ""Night_Hawk07""","[1, 1]","I never had Showtime but I remember seeing reviews of this show back in 2003. The show looked interesting enough but it would be about two years later when I would rent the first disc and watch the first episode of the show. To say the least, I was utterly enthralled. A couple of months later, I bought the first season of the show.The show begins with the character of George Lass' death by toilet seat. She soon meets a whole group of Grim Reapers and finds out she will be a reaper herself. Throughout the 14 episodes of the first season, she faces many obstacles and mysteries associated with being one of the undead. One of the most intriguing is her continued ventures to see her family, with whom she never had a good relationship with when she was alive.The cast (Ellen Muth, Callum Blue, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy...) are AMAZING and it's hard to imagine any other people portraying them.

He also has a unique and interesting cadence to his dialog that is apparent here, although truly showcased in his later series, &#34;Pushing Daisies&#34;.In this wonderful series, the protagonist is a disaffected young woman who dies and becomes a grim reaper. But, she doesn't just die, she's killed by a toilet seat falling from a space station. Some of the souls taken by this new reaper die is spectacularly silly ways, and the reapers need to take the souls before the grim deed occurs. Of course, all of this, from the bizarre deaths to her nickname among reapers (Toilet-seat Girl), to having to earn a living and pay her own way even after she dies, adds to her sense that the world isn't fair. While she starts out focused on life's unfairness to her, she begins to become refocused on how life isn't fair to anyone. Her growth, as she learns true empathy for others and finally discovers the value of family, the macabre sense of humor, and Fuller's fascinating dialog provide a richly rewarding television experience.",5,"Unique, Strange, Endearing, and Oh, So Bryan Fuller!",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1084,"['Bryan', 'Fuller', 'odd', 'often', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'unique', 'interesting', 'cadence', 'dialog', 'apparent', 'here', 'truly', 'showcased', 'later', 'series', '34', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', '34', '.In', 'wonderful', 'series', 'protagonist', 'disaffected', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'grim', 'reaper', ""n't"", 'just', 'die', 'killed', 'toilet', 'seat', 'falling', 'space', 'station', 'souls', 'taken', 'new', 'reaper', 'die', 'spectacularly', 'silly', 'ways', 'reapers', 'need', 'take', 'souls', 'grim', 'deed', 'course', 'bizarre', 'deaths', 'nickname', 'reapers', 'Toilet-seat', 'Girl', 'having', 'earn', 'living', 'pay', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'sense', 'world', ""n't"", 'fair', 'out', 'focused', 'life', 'unfairness', 'become', 'refocused', 'how', 'life', ""n't"", 'fair', 'anyone', 'growth', 'true', 'empathy', 'others', 'finally', 'value', 'family', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'Fuller', 'fascinating', 'dialog', 'provide', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'television', 'experience']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

Still, you figure when over two hundred people rate a TV show like this and give it a near-perfect rating, it's gotta be worth checking out. It worked for ""Wonderfalls,"" ""Slings & Arrows"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"", so I had pretty high hopes for ""Dead Like Me.""Well, I guess there's an exception to every rule, because I was sorely disappointed by this Showtime series, which has near-universal fuzzy love from the Amazon review pool. It's actually not that good.  The characters are, for the most part, mere stick-figures. The scripts aren't that great; the directing is slack, the uber-ironic, world-weary viewpoint of the slacker narrator is pounded to death in scene after scene. It's a tendentious, unsubtle show, and I struggled to get through it. My wife gave up after the first two episodes, and I have to say, she was totally right. This is okay, I suppose, and I see why it's fans think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread... But there are a lot of things to watch that are much, much better.  Or (gasp!) books to read.

Especially series that have just been released after their first season. I don't own any Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs (although the show has some great acting and dialogue), nor do I own Six Feet Under or The Sopranos or any other form of long term television viewing. So what makes this one so different?Simply put: everything!In a time where most of what we see and understand comes through that little lighted box with a remote control near-at-hand, it is refreshing to see something different. Something unlike what Hollywood would normally put out there. I can almost hear the arguments against this show before it was released (probably similar arguments that got Wonder Falls cancelled...another excellent show with the same production crew, so I understand). ""Death! Who wants to hear about the afterlife of an 18 year old girl?!"" and ""This family is too dysfunctional!"" and ""Comedy. We need more comedy!"" Let's hope some do-gooder never get's his/her hands on this excellent story concept and tries to change it to a light-hearted, feel-good series or some other ridiculously overdone theme.So what is this series about? The focus is on Georgia ""George"" Lass, played perfectly by Ellen Muth. She's like millions of other post-highschool graduates out there; she has no idea what she wants to do with her life, or whether she wants to do anything at all. Her mother, Joy (Cynthia Stevenson), is fed up with her daughter's attitude and forces her out of bed one fateful morning with harsh words and orders for her to ""find a job and become a productive member of society."" Little does George's mother know, but these harsh words will be the last she ever speaks to her eldest daughter. On George's first day in the workforce, she takes a lunch break and, as she stand on a street corner, gets snuffed out by a zero-G toilet seat that comes crashing into our atmosphere from the disintegrating Mir space station. But before she's killed, a nice black man asks her name and touches her on the back ever so slightly. George has just been Reaped. The toilet seat kills her, but her soul lives on. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) greets her as her new boss. George is to become a Grim Reaper, taking souls from the lives of those that are about to be violently ended.The irony is smackingly wonderful: a young girl who couldn't have cared less about her own life only moments before is now in charge of the end of lives of god knows how many people. Leaving behind her family is tough, though. And it is poignantly portrayed without getting heavy-handed in the dialogue department. Her mother retreats into herself and becomes an angry woman who likes very little. George's kid sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), tries to contact George in the afterlife by acting out (she steals toilet seats from her school, uses a Ouji board on top of her own toilet seat in an effort to hear anything coming from the `beyond', and collects dead things like birds). George's father, Clancy Lass (Greg Kean), has an affair with one of his graduate students.What George hadn't anticipated either was the fact that her life has/had actual meaning. She witnesses her family falling apart but is unable to do anything about it. She also has to work a regular job now (Reapers don't get paid by some surreal agency), as well as do the reaping assignments handed out to her by Rube.Within this little grouping of Reapers are some outstanding personalities, too. Callum Blue plays Mason, a Reaper who died while drilling a hole into his head in the 1960's in an attempt to reach ""the ultimate high."" He'll do anything not to work, including stealing from those who he reaps and carrying ""illegals in his bottom."" Jasmine Guy plays Roxy, a tough and roughshod Reaper who doesn't take anything from anyone. She'd been murdered over money. No wonder she wants to be cop. Laura Harris plays Daisy Adair, a pretty, young actress who knew and had sex with almost all the early movie stars. She's been around the block, trying to find love and acceptance. It's a funny and sad character that comes barreling off the screen.The thing that'll pull you into this series is the dialogue and the characters. The death of an 18 year old girl and her subsequent enlistment into Reaper-ville can sound rather heavy. And it is. But the writers let that seep into the story and don't force it upon us (not an easy thing to do). The comedy is spot on and never slapstick or inappropriate. I let my teenagers watch a couple of the series and they were laughing out loud many times, and reaching for tissues at the more poignant moments; a testament to a great show if ever there was one (being able to hold the attention of the instant gratification age).I cannot recommend this series highly enough. I pray that Showtime keeps getting the go-ahead to continue the show. So far, season 2 has been outstanding too.

With Dead Like Me, you don't get any of these things. But hear me out - First of all, this series is definitely geared towards girls between the ages of 17-20 (trust me on this). But regardless of this, there were so many clich&eacute;s, unoriginal jokes, and just boring writing that this series was very hard to watch.On top of the awful writing, the characters were incredibly annoying, shallow and just hard to relate or even care for in this show. As one reviewer stated, all your typical characters are in this show - Jaded, don't smile, fish-out-of-water teen girl, your foreigner (not the band) lad, the cheesy sex-pot, cheating husband, etc...The jokes and storylines were either so boring, ripped off from something else (especially American Beauty for the mother, father and little sister storyline), or so filled with plot holes that you spent more time getting annoyed by this than actually enjoying the show.

After watching the first season, I now feel that this now-cancelled show is better than 99% of the shows on non-cable channels.Ellen Muth, who really was an unknown coming into this series, does a terrific job as George, a slacker who remains unmotivated even after becoming undead.  While her character initially comes across as abrasive and somewhat annoying, she eventually shows a softer underbelly, especially with regards to the mother and sister she mostly disliked while alive.Mandy Patinkin is his usual self, someone who many will like while others will hate.  His Rube is the leader of this group of the undead, and Patinkin gives his character an everyman quality that I found endearing.  Of the other supporting cast, Cynthia Stevenson stands out as George's still-grieving mom who also has a difficult younger daughter with whom to deal.  I felt that Rebecca Gayheart was the weak link among the cast, but she thankfully left during the season.The stories are pretty simple, dealing with the taking of souls.  However, these tales are used to take a look at the life of George and the members of her group.  Happy and sad, funny and depressing, but always entertaining.

George, played by Ellen Muth, becomes a grim reaper after a toilet seat from a crashing space station kills her.  George struggles to grow up and begins to realize that her mother isn't the hateful woman she thinks she is, her sister isn't the monster that she wanted to believe she was and her father really is a cheat.  No one is perfect least of all this pouting spoiled young woman that is forced to deal with death- hers and others- every day.  I began to root for her every time she had a new delimma to face without the back up of her family.  Getting a job, an apartment, food and friends (the other grims in her little area).  No one really likes George at first and she's really not very likable, but that begins to change. George's little sister is kind of a morbid little thing and that doesn't change.  She starts out by collecting toilet seats from neighbors, school and wherever she can find them and hanging them in a tree. Sort of a living memorial to her big sister.  The other Characters in this series are funny and strange in the way that everyday life is. We all know people like her new boss and the receptionist at Happy Time Temp Agengy. George finds a job at a Temp agengy (being a temp at the temp agency), and begins a study of life and death.  This is a wonderfully complex series with a dry wit.

804048,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B0001GF2F6,DarthJustice,"[1, 1]","Dead Like Me originally aired on Showtime from 2003-2004 however it was not until 2007 I first discovered this gem of a show. I still wonder how it took so long for me to ever hear about it. Coincidentally, it's much like Quantum Leap in that it is one of my favorite series ever (#1 actually) and it was all because of the Sci-Fi Channel and their marathons I became a fan.Dead Like Me is a show that follows five main characters (one leaves after the fifth episode to be replaced by another) who just happen to be death--literally. The show's main focus is an 18 year old woman named George (short for Georgia) Lass who is killed in the first episode.The way it works in-universe is that there are multiple grim reapers--though we never see THE Grim Reaper--around the world, many (or all...it's never explicitly said as we meet a few non-main character individual reapers) work in groups. These groups all work under a specific category. For example, one reaper in the second season takes the souls of people who die of natural causes. George and the other main characters work with the ""External Influence Division"" (murder, suicide, accident). In order to become a reaper, it's more or less the luck of the draw. To become one, the reap has to be the reaper's last one. In George's case, she was. Last reap's must take their reaper's place when said reaper moves on, or gets promoted as the show puts it.One might wonder how someone like George can go about doing their thing if they are dead. Perhaps wondering, wouldn't someone, especially family, notice? Well, reapers often two appearances--their true appearance, and what the living world sees.Dead Like Me is a character-driven plot. Very much so, dare I say. But that's no problem as the characters play off one another so well.The main characters include George, an 18 year old college dropout with a twinge of misanthropy and social alienation (it's noted on the commentary that no one her own age is present at her funeral), Mason, a constant screw-up alcoholic drug user who died in the 1966 and this reviewer's favorite character, Roxy, a tough-as-nails meter-maid and later police officer, Betty who is replaced after five episodes by the seemingly self-absorbed and shallow actress Daisy Adair who died in the 1920s, and the leader of the pack, Rube, a complex father-figure to the group, and especially George. Wildly different people in terms of personality, but they all play off each other and interact to the point of it being almost amazing.In the wake of George's death is her parents and younger sister who struggle to deal with it in their own ways. This is just to name a few though. There are other recurring characters as well you easily will love seeing on screen.One of my favorite things about season one is watching George grow gradually going from an 18 year old who doesn't want the responsibility of being a reaper, trying her best to shirk her duty, and taking people's souls to accepting it and having no problems with doing what must be done.And I believe overall that's what season one is about--George's journey and growth.

The Reapers themselves are all deeply flawed, and yet likeable, characters who have passed away at different points in time, and who have to pay their karmic debt by doing the job until the Almighty judges that they've &quot;met their quota&quot;. The main character, George, played with loads of charm and poise by the young Ellen Muth, is a rebellious, lazy teenager who, despite the rules against it, still watches over her mourning, dysfunctional family. The great Mandy Patinkin plays the Grim Reaper &quot;manager&quot; Rube, and also serves as father figure and mentor to George, goofy British hoodlum Mason, angry meter maid Roxy (the sexy and talented Jasmine Guy) and vain, self-absorbed Daisy.

804057,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B0001GF2F6,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[4, 6]","The clerk in our local video store told me about this series, and I have to admit it's addictive.  Dead Like Me has all the ingredients of a successful non-traditional series: great acting, fascinating individual characters, fast-moving scenes, likeable but complex lead characters, and an offbeat premise.  Selecting a new episode is like looking forward to a reunion with old friends.  So I'd enthusiastically recommend this series to anyone who wants to escape from restrictive, me-too network programming.Reapers are people who have died but are not ready to move to the ultimate heavenly bliss. Apparently others are, because some of the newly dead get to ascend filmy staircases that presumably lead to better ends.  While waiting to move on, reapers are assigned a quota of souls to pull from bodies of people who have just died.Rube, played perfectly by Mandy Patinkin, gets names delivered in an envelope, slid under his door. He distributes assignments on yellow post-it notes.  He's a combination of coach, father-figure and boss: kind but tough. His crew (as others noted already) includes an irreverent English druggie, a former actress, a cynical meter maid and of course George, the 18-year-old with an attitude.Two aspects of the show stopped me from awarding Dead Like Me five stars. First, as others have noted, the show's premise contains inherent contradictions. Reapers have physical bodies that digest food, but presumably they don't age. Reapers travel, drive cars, get apartments and take jobs, but where do they get documents and licenses?  And if they hang around for years, presumably they'd grow in knowledge and wisdom.  And as a career consultant, I resist the notion of afterlife as a series of dreary day jobs.  If the Reapers maintain their pre-death attitudes, they'll outgrow those jobs, become overqualified and even get promoted in spite of themselves.Second, Dead Like Me inevitably reminds viewers of other shows.  There's an obvious comparison to Six Feet Under, where the dead occasionally leap to life to send a message to the Fisher family.  The coffee shop scenes evoke memories of Seinfeld and of course Sex and the City. And hovering over the series is the ghost of Charlie's Angels, where a kindly man dishes out assignments to an unlikely crew.To some extent, you can enjoy the comparisons as satire. Sex and the City had an over-the-top publication party; Dead Like Me, an over-the-top employee farewell party.  Charlie's Angels were beautiful obedient young women; this crew is...well, different.Most of the characters in Dead Like Me seem deliberately overdrawn, especially Dolores, George's employer, and Reggie, George's younger sister. But the show takes away its own satiric edge by allowing us to see a sympathetic side of each character. Dolores crumples when her cat gets sick. Roxy mourns her dance career. And we learn that Daisy was sadly lonely in her former life.Unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed the scenes with George's own family. They're more complex than we first realize and it's hard to categorize them as ""good"" or ""bad.""  And it's more fascinating to watch the worlds of the dead and the living come together, rather than stay within the stifling world of the dead.Despite these reservations, I'll be first in line to watch Season 2 on DVD...hopefully soon.",4,A series that's far from dead,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3328,"['clerk', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'told', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'addictive', 'Dead', 'Me', 'ingredients', 'successful', 'non-traditional', 'series', 'great', 'acting', 'fascinating', 'individual', 'characters', 'fast-moving', 'scenes', 'likeable', 'complex', 'lead', 'characters', 'offbeat', 'premise', 'Selecting', 'new', 'episode', 'looking', 'forward', 'reunion', 'old', 'friends', 'So', ""'d"", 'enthusiastically', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'escape', 'restrictive', 'me-too', 'network', 'programming.Reapers', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'are', 'not', 'ready', 'move', 'ultimate', 'heavenly', 'bliss', 'Apparently', 'others', 'are', 'newly', 'dead', 'get', 'ascend', 'filmy', 'staircases', 'presumably', 'lead', 'better', 'ends', 'waiting', 'move', 'reapers', 'are', 'assigned', 'quota', 'souls', 'pull', 'bodies', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'died.Rube', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'names', 'delivered', 'envelope', 'slid', 'door', 'assignments', 'yellow', 'post-it', 'notes', 'combination', 'coach', 'father-figure', 'boss', 'kind', 'tough', 'crew', 'others', 'noted', 'already', 'irreverent', 'English', 'druggie', 'former', 'actress', 'cynical', 'meter', 'maid', 'course', 'George', '18-year-old', 'attitude.Two', 'aspects', 'show', 'stopped', 'awarding', 'Dead', 'Me', 'five', 'stars', 'First', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'show', 'premise', 'inherent', 'contradictions', 'Reapers', 'have', 'physical', 'bodies', 'digest', 'food', 'presumably', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'Reapers', 'travel', 'drive', 'cars', 'get', 'apartments', 'take', 'jobs', 'where', 'do', 'get', 'documents', 'licenses', 'hang', 'years', 'presumably', ""'d"", 'grow', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'career', 'consultant', 'resist', 'notion', 'afterlife', 'series', 'dreary', 'day', 'jobs', 'Reapers', 'maintain', 'pre-death', 'attitudes', ""'ll"", 'outgrow', 'jobs', 'become', 'overqualified', 'even', 'get', 'promoted', 'spite', 'themselves.Second', 'Dead', 'Me', 'inevitably', 'viewers', 'other', 'shows', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Six', 'Feet', 'where', 'dead', 'occasionally', 'leap', 'life', 'send', 'message', 'Fisher', 'family', 'coffee', 'shop', 'scenes', 'evoke', 'memories', 'Seinfeld', 'course', 'Sex', 'City', 'hovering', 'series', 'ghost', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'where', 'kindly', 'man', 'out', 'assignments', 'unlikely', 'crew.To', 'extent', 'can', 'enjoy', 'comparisons', 'satire', 'Sex', 'City', 'had', 'over-the-top', 'publication', 'party', 'Dead', 'Me', 'over-the-top', 'employee', 'farewell', 'party', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'were', 'beautiful', 'obedient', 'young', 'women', 'crew', 'well', 'different.Most', 'characters', 'Dead', 'Me', 'seem', 'deliberately', 'overdrawn', 'especially', 'George', 'employer', 'Reggie', 'George', 'younger', 'sister', 'show', 'away', 'own', 'satiric', 'edge', 'allowing', 'see', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'character', 'Dolores', 'when', 'cat', 'sick', 'Roxy', 'dance', 'career', 'learn', 'Daisy', 'was', 'sadly', 'lonely', 'former', 'life.Unlike', 'reviewers', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'George', 'own', 'family', ""'re"", 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'realize', 'hard', 'categorize', 'good', 'bad', 'more', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'worlds', 'dead', 'living', 'come', 'together', 'rather', 'stay', 'stifling', 'world', 'dead.Despite', 'reservations', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'line', 'watch', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'hopefully', 'soon']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

Here you had perfectly good television with a loyal (i.e. ratings-challenged) following. You also had great material and terrific writing to work with but look what happens. It gets the boot after two seasons. Now, I'm not big into whining but I need to say something here. Axing this show was a big mistake, something right along the lines of cancelling Angel, Firefly and Wonderfalls. Because with a little support and time, the show could've been spectacular. Now contrary to what some believe, this series is very different from Six Feet Under (also seeing its end very soon) despite sharing a similar basic premise (seeing dead people).

804061,ABLDH2OCKVYPX,B0001GF2F6,"Emerson Shiff ""oldpunkswebzine""","[4, 8]","Spoilers Galore!! I loved Wonderfalls so I bought both seasons of Dead Like Me. I finished season one and just started two. I like the show but I think they made it up as they went along and there's little internal logic. Other things simply drive me nuts.The acting is great, especially Ellen Muth, Christine Willies and Cynthia Stevenson, whose scenes I fast-forward through because it's like watching Todd Solondz's Happiness, the most unrelentingly depressing movie I've ever seen. The family drama plot-line is another show in itself and I don't know where it belongs in a dramedy about personal growth and self-realization. Along those lines, a number of episodes end with well-scripted voice-overs describing lessons learned and happiness achieved, yet the following episode sees George just as depressed and listless. So, like in sitcoms, nobody ever learns and nothing really changes.The reaper's powers and responsibilities are vague, inconsistent and unbelievable even within the confines of science fiction. At the end of the pilot episode George sits in her sister's closet but is not seen by her mother, so she can become invisible, right? Wrong! Reapers are supposed to guide the dead into the light, but they often leave immediately and do nothing. They're only given a name, time and location for reaping, and they have to figure out who that person is. How can this work in large crowds or wide areas where there's a chance the soul won't be removed in time? Why would the reaping system open itself to so much potential failure? It would take nothing away to have the reapers know instinctively who's about to die since the dialogue between reaper and doomed is all that matters anyway.For some reason the housing issue annoys me. Fine, they live in the homes of the recently deceased. How long can THAT be? Rube seems settled in. Does his building not have a landlord? How do reapers stay out of jail, seeing they're always interacting at crimes scenes, breaking into homes and stealing? Where does Rube get his money? Why doesn't Daisy work? I try to accept the show as is but I think they could have thought through their world a lot more to make it less a minefield of distractions and disbelief.Season two is starting off aggressively depressing and mean.Dead Like Me is a good show with a lot of problems.",3,"Dead Like You.

One outraged citizen demands that she take the ticket back and assaults the meter maid.  In anger, she lifts out the citizen's soul, strangles it, and then puts it back into his body.  When she meets him again, he has turned into a pacifist who has made a shrine to the meter maid.  Later when she has his truck towed, he responds that he understands her...""you are a vengeful God.""

I recieved this DVD set as a gift and I love it.Dead Like Me is a show about Georgia (aka George, Millie, Toilet Seat Girl, Peanut etc) and the experience of her death. George is (was) an 18 year old who, after dropping out of college her first semester moves back in with her parents and kid sister. Upon being nagged by her mother to get a job, George begins clerical work at a place called Happy Time. On her first day working at Happy Time she goes out of the office to grab a quick lunch when she encounters a man on the street who asks her name and touches her when she walks away, then she gets hit in the head with a toilet seat which fell from space and dies... sounds weird but it's well done.Right after her death George realizes that she has not left the earth, and is confused by this. She ends up meeting some Grim Reapers, Rube being the boss (played by Mandy Patakin), and they explain to her that she is dead and that she is to be a Grim Reaper. Rube explains that when you die and you weren't a good person, nor a bad person you have to become a Reaper for sometime until you fill your Quota of souls. So what George's job as a Reaper is that she must take the souls out of people who are about to die accidential\painful deaths so that that person will feel no pain. Rube gives this particular group of Reapers their assignments daily, which consist of enitials, and address, and an E.T.D. (estimated time of death) and the Reapers are to find this person and take their soul out of their bodies.You might be wondering how she can walk around the same city she was living in without some people knowing her, this is covered, in this show the dead take on different names to the public (George is Millie) and they look very different to the living.The show follows George as she gets used to the fact that she is dead, and her coping with the fact that being dead doesn't change the fact that she now needs a place to ""live"" (which the Reapers show her that she can inhabit the apartments of dead people who no one knew were dead yet), and the fact that she needs to get a real world job (which she happens to go back to Happy Time). The Reapers are all friendly with each other and hang together in a diner.The show also deals with George's family and how they deal with her loss. Her mom, who never really got along with George is extreamly guilty, her little sister who George always ignored misses her more than anyone, and her dad privatly grieves. George, looking different is able to have somewhat regular encounters with members of her family, and she finds out some family secrets which explain alot of the relationship problems her parents have.This show is great. It is funny and sad all at once. I guess some would call it dark comedy. The cast is incredibly talented and make the show that much more fun to watch.

Thanks everyone!A couple of reviewers said things like ""buy this if you liked Buffy"" which is a comment sure to get my attention.  But the only similarity is that they are both wonderfully written and acted shows.  This is poignant drama, with a touch of humour, and whilst the premise is a fantasy, it is a fantasy dealing with some very real issues (okay, maybe a few surreal ones too).  In part the series is about the ways in which people and families deal with death, but at its core it is a hopeful and positive story with characters you come to care a lot about, especially the main character brilliantly played by Ellen Muth.My wife occasionly gets exasperated by my habit of buying DVDs almost sight unseen.

It looked interesting so I picked up season one which is nothing short of brilliant.  I am baffled as to why this was not promoted better when it actually was on TV (I'm assuming it must have been on at some stage).  What hope does a show have not to be canned when no one even knows it exists let alone that it is on?  Whoever was responsible for marketing this show needs to be shown the door, even the DVD seasons aren't being promoted anywhere, I've never seen one advertisement.  So if you've somehow been recommended to this product's page through reading reviews of other products or something all I can say is buy Dead Like Me!  You won't be disappointed.The series basically revolves around 18 year old George who is a teenage girl who basically doesn't give a crap about and bludges along through life. Too bad for her a toilet seat from the Muir space station is going to cut that life short.  Immediately after her death she is taken under the wing of a couple of grim reapers who initially let her reflect on her life, visit her wake and so forth then drop the bombshell that her new job will be becoming one of them. Yes Grim Reapers don't get paid in conventional ways so George has to return to the very employer she hated where she died during her first the lunch hour.  The death scenes are hilarious, especially the bank death scene in the pilot.  Granted in subsequent seasons they aren't quite as well done as this one but this is explained in the pilot's commentary (which is done by most of the actors), that they did not get the budget or long timeframe to shoot the rest of the episodes.  Even though the death scenes are not as good as that scene all deaths are still very funny as are the office scenes and employment/money getting schemes of the other reapers.  My only criticism of the special features is that none explain why the producers decided to update one of the reaper characters so early on, the storyline for this happening worked very well but I would have liked to have known if this was always intended or did the actress want more money, have other commitments or what?Get this show though, it's great!

But on her first day of work her life is cut short by a toilet seat falling from a space station.  It is then that her life really begins.  Being dead George meets people whose job it is to collect the souls of those dying from accidents.  They are called grim reapers.  But after her funeral George discovers that she will not be moving on, she is joining the ranks of the reapers.Throughout her short life George did very little and seemed to care for even less.

While balancing reaping with existing, George finds herself constantly being drawn back to her family (considered a no-no for reapers).  George must try to walk the thin line between what she wants to do and what she is supposed to do.This is a surprisingly good series that manages to celebrate life in a way most cannot.

804096,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B0001GF2F6,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[4, 4]","In its' original run on the premium cable channel, 'Showtime' I had only seen the comedy-drama, ""Dead Like Me"" once, while away on vacation. It piqued my interest, but I never got a chance to see any more of it (I've only got HBO at home). But last 'Father's Day', my wife surprised me with the gift of both DVD box sets of the show's only two seasons. I have no ideal if I'm suppose to read deeper morbid meaning into, that particular selction, but it turned out to be a brilliantly entertaining show, that left us entranced!For those who don't know, the cable series, ""Dead Like Me"" is humorous examination (with dramatic overtones) of both life and death. We meet 18 year-old, Georgia Lass (Ellen Muth), who has dropped out of college and is stuck (for a morning) in a dead-end job. She dosn't seem to care about anything or anyone in her dead-end life. But that life is pretty short, when destiny preordains her on a fatal collision course with a toilet seat falling out of the sky. But instead of becoming merely dead, she becomes one of the un-dead. She joins a mysteriously chosen class of deceased folks, known as 'Reapers', who when not 'living' and working amongst us, must remove and guide the souls from the coporal bodies of those, who die in horrible (and many times humorous)accidents, murders and suicides.The group of 'Reapers', who take George under their wing include the paternal leader, Rube (Mandy Patinkin), the hard nosed metermaid, Roxy (Jasmin Guy), the unprincipled, British delinquent, Mason (Callum Blue), the flighty, short lived (pun intended) character Betty (Rebecca Gayheart) and her replacement, self-involved, former silver screen actress, Daisy Adair (Laura Harris). This disperate group of the undead fight, bicker, joke and help each other out as they await their daily post-it assignments of death at 'The Waffle Haus' restaurant.This show may sound morbid, but in actuality it is 'black humor' and drama at its' best. The ironic theme of the show is that George really dosn't start living until she is dead. She slowly must come to terms with her own death and in the process learns to apreciate the life she had and the love ones/family, that were a part of it.Everything about this show is just great. Almost everyone of the scripts are like home runs hit out of the park. The stories are moving and emotional without being treacly. They make you want to both laugh and cry. The dialogue is smart and well written. The Rube Goldberg set-ups for the many deaths featured are a ying-yang of being both macabre and hilarious.The series also has a wonderful ensemble cast. Ellen Muth shines as the moody anchor of the story, acting as a guide to her life among the living and the dead. All her fellow actors are great. I particularly like Mandy Patinkin as the cantankerous, Rube and Laura Harris as Daisy. Also kudos should be given to actors Cynthia Stevenson and Britt McKillip for there amazing chemistry together as George's mom and little sister.This a is wonderful show and I love both seasons. To me, it is inexplicable, why this brilliant cable program was cut off after only two seasons. It just leaves you wanting more!

It is for acquired tastes only.  Indeed we were put off by the across-the-board profanity on the part of all the characters at first (after awhile we got used to it, denatured I suppose, or else maybe as the series goes on the characters swear less and less), it doesn't seem so much naturalistic as it does the producers just deciding to show you how much foul language they could get away with on cable on TV.  Thus the leading lady, in particular, young Ellen Muth, is saddled with some of the most gamy dialogue I've heard outside of the work of Pierre Guyotat.But outside of that, the show really grows on you.  Muth is so odd you can't take your eyes off of her, sometimes she looks bruised as though she'd been beaten up, it's hard to figure out her age, but when they dress her up and make her up right, she looks like a cross between Sandra Dee and Brigitte Bardot.  Her mother, the admirable Cynthia Stevenson, is stuck with a two-note role that sometimes seems arbitrarily laced into the action of the various episodes, because as the show progresses, out attention drifts away from the grief of the Lass family and into the other areas of George's life.Did anyone think the show is paying a kind of muted homage to the Glass family of J D Salinger?  Remember when George got fingered by the Reapers, and the name on her post it note was: ""G.LASS""?  It's funny how her father, Clancy the professor, on his office door the plaque says, ""C.LASS""!But all in all we love the show.",5,From Death to Life,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1724,"['very', 'good', 'Chicago', 'friend', 'Hi', 'David', 'recommended', 'boxed', 'set', 'saying', 'would', 'enjoy', 'program', 'kept', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'because', 'well', 'not', 'automatically', 'kind', 'show', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'just', 'everyone', 'acquired', 'tastes', 'only', 'Indeed', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'across-the-board', 'profanity', 'part', 'characters', 'first', 'got', 'used', 'denatured', 'suppose', 'else', 'maybe', 'series', 'characters', 'swear', 'less', 'less', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'naturalistic', 'producers', 'just', 'deciding', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'foul', 'language', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'cable', 'TV', 'Thus', 'leading', 'lady', 'particular', 'young', 'Ellen', 'Muth', 'saddled', 'most', 'gamy', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'work', 'Pierre', 'Guyotat.But', 'show', 'really', 'Muth', 'so', 'odd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'her', 'sometimes', 'bruised', ""'d"", 'been', 'beaten', 'up', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'age', 'when', 'dress', 'up', 'make', 'up', 'right', 'cross', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'mother', 'admirable', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'stuck', 'two-note', 'role', 'sometimes', 'arbitrarily', 'laced', 'action', 'various', 'episodes', 'show', 'out', 'attention', 'drifts', 'away', 'grief', 'Lass', 'family', 'other', 'areas', 'George', 'life.Did', 'anyone', 'think', 'show', 'paying', 'kind', 'muted', 'homage', 'Glass', 'family', 'J', 'D', 'Salinger', 'Remember', 'when', 'George', 'got', 'fingered', 'Reapers', 'name', 'post', 'note', 'was', 'G.LASS', 'funny', 'how', 'father', 'Clancy', 'professor', 'office', 'door', 'plaque', 'C.LASS', 'love', 'show']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

It's a comforting concept.So who removes these souls?  People who themselves have suffered mortal injuries, but who--for whatever reason--remain &#34;alive&#34; to reap the souls of those who will die.  We never know why these &#34;undead&#34; reapers weren't immediately ushered to their own &#34;lights.&#34;The show focuses on a small family of reapers, five in all, with a team leader (Mandy Patimkin) responsible for issuing each day's assignments--name, time, and place only.  It's up to the individual reaper to be there, on time.  So we see lots of folk leaving their lives in some interesting ways.  Their bodies are dead, but their spirit selves materialize immediately, so it's not at all gory.  Even the death scenes aren't gory--they remind one of the scene in &#34;Wizard of Oz,&#34; when we know that the wicked witch has met her fate by seeing her feet poking out from beneath the house.The reapers, in between their daily reaping assignments, are expected to be self-supporting.  They work at jobs just like the rest of us.  They no longer look like their former selves, but they have retained all their lifetime memories.  The key character, an 18-year-old malcontented girl, has remained in her hometown and, despite her boss' repeated warnings, continues to check up on her real-life family (who, of course, cannot recognize her).  So we get to see how the death of one daughter is affecting the surviving family.If you're wondering how this could be humorous, you'll simply have to look at an episode.

804103,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001GF2F6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[115, 127]","I am sure the people at Showtime knew what they were doing when they scheduled ""Dead Like Me"" to start when HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" was over, because the two shows are certainly complementary.  However, while the deaths that begin each episode of ""Six Feet Under"" have their moments in terms of being rather weird (my favorite was the woman convinced it was the Rapture when she saw the a bunch of helium filled inflatable dolls floating away), they do not have the Rube Goldberg quality of what the gravelings can set in motion in ""Dead Like Me.""The idea of the afterlife created by Bryan Fuller, who also created the similarly quirky Wonderfalls,"" is that right before you die you soul is taken from your body by a Grim Reaper.  Although they are replete in the opening title sequence these are not Grim Reapers as in figures in black hood carrying scythes.  In fact, they look like regular folk, although not the regular folk they were when they were alive now that they are a peculiar variety of undead.  We learn the rules of the game along with young Georgia Lass (Ellen Muth), an 18-year-old sourpuss called George.  Having decided to forego the college experience George has been sent out into the world to find a job and during lunch she is passed on the street by a strange man who touches her.  We see a light passing from her to him and within seconds a toilet seat from a disintegrating Russian space station strikes her dead.George is surprised to see herself looking at the big hole in the ground where she had been standing a moment ago and even more surprised to be informed that she is now a Grim Reaper.  This task is done by Rube (Mandy Patinkin), who is in charge of a cadre of Reapers in this particular town.  This includes Mason (Callum Blue), an English bloke who has figured out that you cannot overdose when you are already dead so indulge in drugs to your heart's contextt; Roxy (Jasmine Guy), a meter maid for the police department with ample attitude to spare; and, at first,  Betty Rhomer (Rebecca Gayheart), a former beauty queen who is ready to move on to the next level.  We are not quite sure what that is, because while Grim Reapers get to release souls and head them in the right direction (bright lights that assume various pleasing shapes), they really do not know what the final destination is really like for the dead.Of course, in the early episodes of the series George is not happy with being dead and not exactly thrilled with a job when she is given a post-it note with a name, address and E.T.D. (estimated time of death) so she can go reap a soul.  The latter is taken care of when she gets a couple of hard lessons about what happens when she does not (your form in the afterlife is not how you look at the moment of death, but at the moment that your soul is reaped, so it is something you would want to have done before the autopsy).  The former is more difficult, because trying to reconnect with her life from beyond the grave is hampered by the fact that she looks different (to everyone else) and she cannot say anything that would convince anyone who knew her before that she was still around.One of the strengths of this quirky series is that we do not ignore the family that Georgia has left behind as her mother (Cynthia Stevenson), little sister (Britt McKillip), and father (Greg Kean) try to deal with moving on after her death.  Watching the Lass family disintegrate is almost a show within the show, capable of standing on its own, because their interaction with Georgia the Grim Reaper is infrequent and usually something indirect.  We are as interested in what is going to happen to Joy and Reggie (and J.D. rather than Clancy) as we are to Georgia and her friends.Another thing that makes ""Dead Like Me"" work is the actual friendship that springs up between George and Dolores Herbig (Christine Willes).  Now known as Millie, George ends up going back to work at Happy Time, the employment agency that she was taking a lunch break from when the sky fell on her head (even when you are undead a girl has to eat).  Dolores is extremely annoying, but ""Millie"" pretends to play along so long that she actually starts playing along with Dolores' weltanschauung.The cherry on top with this show is Mandy Patinkin as Rube, who finally has a role in which he can say pretty much anything he wants, especially when it comes to what he is having for breakfast and how it is cooked.  I like the way he calls George ""Peanut"" all the time as he imparts to her the facts of being undead.  I also like the way Roxy gets mad at people who tear up their tickets, the moments of conscious that Mason has when doing his job, and the way Reggie honors the memory of her sister.  But then it is a well- established fact that I like quirky.Joining the cast during this first season is another Grim Reaper, Daisy Adair (Laura Harris), an actress who had a role in ""Gone With the Wind"" and makes no bones about how she got the gig before she died.  She and George become roommates just to cause further trouble for our heroine (and her frog) and is most definitely the character who rubs me the wrong way.  But in the end I have to say that the only thing about ""Dead Like Me"" that really bothers me is that the post-it notes only have the first initial of the person who is destined to die.  You cannot tell a person's gender from just an initial.",5,The early adventures of the Grim Reaper known as Toilet Girl,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,5390,"['am', 'sure', 'people', 'Showtime', 'knew',

Me - The Complete First Season
804104,A2GAINX7PJLP2W,B0001GF2F6,Magin,"[6, 7]","My current theory on the mysteries of television programming is that all the good shows have left the networks, and they're heading for the premium cable channels. Think about it. NYPD Blue and Angel are gone; West Wing is but a pale shadow of its former self. The Sopranos and Six Feet Under are getting all the critical praise these days.So it shouldn't have surprised me that premium cable's other show about coping with death is so good. The formula is simple and obvious: who better to approach the issue of one's own mortality than a dead person? In the case of Dead Like Me, death is approached by not one, but several dead people.Apparently, if you fit certain criteria -- and you fill someone's quota -- upon your death, you're pressed into service as a Grim Reaper. You get a list of deaths for the day, and you take custody of the departed souls until they reach their final destination. As an undead person, explains Rube (Mandy Patinkin in a perfect role), you have ""certain rights and privileges."" A physical body, for example, and the ability to interact with the living (though the living see you as a different person than you were in life). The Reapers of Dead Like Me are not mystical skeletons; they're -- pardon the pun -- working stiffs. Of course they don't get paid, so they have to either work a day job or find other nefarious ways of paying for such amenities as clothing, food and a home.Some of this show's best moments deal with such mundane elements as finding a home, keeping a job, or blundering through a get-rich-quick scam. But it really shines when the mix of the mundane and the macabre takes a sudden turn for the serious. In the series pilot, George, our heroine, is suddenly killed by the meteoric landing of Mir's zero-gravity toilet. It's a bizarre situation treated in such a way that it's ridiculously funny. Somehow, Dead Like Me doesn't lose its humorous edge, even as George accompanies Rube to her own autopsy (""The first man to touch my naked body was a coroner."") and her own funeral. If you can laugh at an autopsy, you've begun to insulate yourself from the pain of death; can you laugh at your own autopsy?This first season is short, with only 14 episodes. In them, George and her family begin coping with her death, but we see that it's a long road. George's Reaper colleagues have been dead a lot longer than she has, and still don't seem to have wrapped up their lives. Daisy is still the same Southen belle actress who had an affair with Clarke Gable on the set of Gone With the Wind. Roxy is still troubled by her death at the hands of the woman who stole her invention: leg-warmers. Mason hasn't learned from a drug-induced attempt to free his mind. And Rube... well, we still don't have Rube's story, apart from the fact that his first car was made in 1898.It's a huge subject, death. And it's an interesting way to look at death, through the eyes of those who have lost their own lives and see others' deaths every day. So, it's got heavy stuff, but Dead Like Me is the most wickedly funny show currently on TV. True comedy comes from dramatic situations; we laugh when our brains can't cope with the ridiculousness or magnitude of a situation. Drama and comedy are two sides of the same chihuahua, and it's a pity that more TV producers haven't realized that. Dead Like Me blends gravitas with black comedy in ways that are unsubtle, unavoidable, and utterly captivating.",5,Life after broadcast TV,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,3434,"['current', 'theory', 'mysteries', 'television', 'programming', 'good', 'shows', 'have', 'left', 'networks', ""'re"", 'heading', 'premium', 'cable', 'channels', 'Think', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Angel', 'are', 'gone', 'West', 'Wing', 'pale', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'Sopranos', 'Six', 'Feet', 'are', 'getting', 'critical', 'praise', 'days.So', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprised', 'premium', 'cable', 'other', 'show', 'coping', 'death', 'so', 'good', 'formula', 'simple', 'obvious', 'who', 'better', 'approach', 'issue', 'one', 'own', 'mortality', 'dead', 'person', 'case', 'Dead', 'Me', 'death', 'approached', 'not', 'one', 'several', 'dead', 'people.Apparently', 'fit', 'certain', 'criteria', 'fill', 'someone', 'quota', 'death', ""'re"", 'pressed', 'service', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'get', 'list', 'deaths', 'day', 'take', 'custody', 'departed', 'souls', 'reach', 'final', 'destination', 'undead', 'person', 'Rube', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'perfect', 'role', 'have', 'certain', 'rights', 'privileges', 'physical', 'body', 'example', 'ability', 'interact', 'living', 'living', 'see', 'different', 'person', 'were', 'life', 'Reapers', 'Dead', 'Me', 'are', 'not', 'mystical', 'skeletons', ""'re"", 'pardon', 'pun', 'working', 'stiffs', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'paid', 'have', 'work', 'day', 'job', 'find', 'other', 'nefarious', 'ways', 'paying', 'such', 'amenities', 'clothing', 'food', 'home.Some', 'show', 'best', 'moments', 'deal', 'such', 'mundane', 'elements', 'finding', 'home', 'keeping', 'job', 'blundering', 'get-rich-quick', 'scam', 'really', 'when', 'mix', 'mundane', 'macabre', 'sudden', 'turn', 'serious', 'series', 'pilot', 'George', 'heroine', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'meteoric', 'landing', 'Mir', 'zero-gravity', 'toilet', 'bizarre', 'situation', 'treated', 'such', 'way', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'Somehow', 'Dead', 'Me', ""n't"", 'lose', 'humorous', 'edge', 'even', 'George', 'Rube', 'own', 'autopsy', 'first', 'man', 'touch', 'naked', 'body', 'was', 'coroner', 'own', 'funeral', 'can', 'laugh', 'autopsy', ""'ve"", 'begun', 'insulate', 'pain', 'death', 'can', 'laugh', 'own', 'autopsy', 'first', 'season', 'short', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'George', 'family', 'begin', 'coping', 'death', 'see', 'long', 'road', 'George', 'Reaper', 'colleagues', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'lot', 'longer', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'wrapped', 'up', 'lives', 'Daisy', 'still', 'same', 'Southen', 'belle', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'Clarke', 'Gable', 'set', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Roxy', 'still', 'troubled', 'death', 'hands', 'woman', 'who', 'stole', 'invention', 'leg-warmers', 'Mason', ""n't"", 'learned', 'drug-induced', 'attempt', 'free', 'mind', 'Rube', 'well', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Rube', 'story', 'apart', 'fact', 'first', 'car', 'was', 'made', '1898.It', 'huge', 'subject', 'death', 'interesting', 'way', 'look', 'death', 'eyes', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'own', 'lives', 'see', 'others', 'deaths', 'day', 'So', 'got', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'Dead', 'Me', 'most', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'show', 'currently', 'TV', 'True', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'laugh', 'when', 'brains', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'ridiculousness', 'magnitude', 'situation', 'Drama', 'comedy', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'chihuahua', 'pity', 'more', 'TV', 'producers', 'have', ""n't"", 'realized', 'Dead', 'Me', 'gravitas', 'black', 'comedy', 'ways', 'are', 'unsubtle', 'unavoidable', 'utterly', 'captivating']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

804114,A1YY9CAIF9RM2C,B0001GF2F6,M. Hester,"[3, 4]","In the summer of 2003, I read about a new show coming to Showtime called ""Dead Like Me"" which seemed interesting, but unfortunately I don't have the premium cable channels. So, there I was just waiting for the inevitable release of the DVD set. All I have to say is that it was worth the wait. The writing is mostly well done, though the ""George flouts the rules in some way"" storyline could've been used for like two episodes before going to more fertile creative ground. The characters are perhaps where the show excels. All of the characters at some point will annoy you, but then something'll happen that'll make you love them. Still, the writers needed to work more on the Daisy Adair character. There was no part of her character that was appealing and there were very little ""saving grace"" aspects to her. My favorite character would have to be Dolores Herbig, for probably the same reasons as other reviewers here. The DVDs are very nice with good picture. I haven't had a chance to look at the extras, though they do seem a little slim for 14 episodes. My biggest problem with the set is the descriptions for the episodes. Either they allude to something that is barely mentioned like ""Reaper Madness"" and the ""biblical proportions"" thing or make the episode sound like an afterschool special like ""Business Unfinished"" and the ""lessons of the afterlife for all.""If you like having all the answers, all the time than DLM is not the show for you.

804116,A35Z7J011XM0JE,B0001GF2F6,Mia Mia,"[5, 6]","This is a wonderful show. It's funny, it's great to watch, and it's just such a cool concept. Gives a new perspective on life and death. George is a really believable character. She's easy to relate to. She can't really grasp the reaper thing at first, she has a hard time leaving her family, and doesn't always do the right thing. She's a really great character and makes the show seem very real. The others aren't nearly as complex as her, but in each episode we see the characters develop. When Daisy is first introduced, she seems really bubbley, (...)happy and a stereotypical blonde. But then we see more in depth and that she is sad and real in later episodes. Same with Roxy, who at first seems sort of cold and uncaring about anything. But as the show develops, how she saved the one guy who she liked, and how she felt bad about her death, she gets a little more life. All of them do. Just like real people. At first people seem really one dimensional, but everybody has problems and emotions that take some time to notice. I love the character development in this show.Overall, Dead Like Me is really well-acted, funny and real. It's unlike a lot of television these days and it's refreshing. There's not a lot of romance, there's just people. The undead seem more like real people than most of the people on television. It's a good show, one of the best I've seen.One star was taken off because this isn't a flawless show. The special effects are really bad, and some of the things that happen are too out there and just not believable. I don't like the home stuff with the Lass family all that well. The mom is very annoying, Clancy is okay and Reggie is a bit too weird that she's not really that believable anymore. Also Delores is too far out there to believe. Things like George's going away party at work and the way a lot of the people die seem too far-fetched for me. Also when George died, she acted like a real person would.

Those episodes never impressed me, but recently I got chills watching an old episode about a toy telephone.You can never tell what's going to strike a chord and resonate with a particular person. ""Dead Like Me"" is not for everyone. Some people will hate it. Others just won't ""get"" it. It's too bad, really, because they're missing out on something truly wonderful.18-year-old Georgia (George) Lass, deceased, has a new job: collector of souls of the newly departed--a grim reaper, if you prefer. She doesn't want to be a reaper. She doesn't know how to be a reaper. She gets on-the-job training. What she learns about, mostly, is life.In life, George was too cool to care about anything. In death, she learns to care, in ways that are funny and sad together. The result is the most consistently moving television show I've ever seen. At the end of each episode, when the credits appear, I find myself shaking my head and muttering, ""What a GREAT show!""The language and some visuals are too harsh for young children. The show contains a lot of adult subject matter--no, not like cable porn--rather, like parents struggling over how to cope with an emotionally troubled 11-year-old daughter.

804120,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001GF2F6,Mitch Weaver,"[10, 10]","George Lass ( Ellen Muth) is an 18 year old girl with no ambition in life. She still lives at home with her parents, and dropped out of college after half a semester. Her mother wants her to make more of her life, and forces George to find a job. Soon George manages to find a job as a file clerk, only to be killed on her lunch break by a falling toilet seat from a space station that exploded. George is not allowed to move on to the afterlife and is forced to become a grim reaper that takes the souls of the living just before they pass over. She is slowly broken into the business by the lead reaper Rube (Mandy Patkin)and is given advice from fellow reapers at a local waffle house that the group meets at everyday to receive their assignments. But, just when George thought that things could not get any worse, she soon discovers that being a reaper does not entitle her to a free ride. She is forced to find a day job in between reaps, a place to stay, and learn all the things about life that she never knew when she was alive.Right off the bat I would like to say that Dead Like Me is probably one of the most addictive, well written, and funniest shows on television today. There have been films and television shows that concentrate on the afterlife before. However, Dead Like Me takes an original apporach to the subject. The show not only focuses on George and her fellow reapers taking people's souls before they pass over, but on their daily lives in between reaps as well. The reapers are forced to get day jobs and find places to stay. The most ironic thing about the show is that George is forced to take care of herself and learns more about life when she is dead, then she did when she was alive. Another aspect of the show that I like, is the fact that the appearances of the reapers are changed to the world around them, to keep the reapers from being recognized by people that they knew when they were alive. This plays into the other focus of the show which is on George's disfunctional family and how they handle life after George passed on.Overall Dead Like Me is an amazing show, and I guarantee that once you start watching you will not want to stop. It usually takes me at least a week to go through a full season on DVD, but I went through all 14 episodes of Dead Like Me in just two days.

Not only was the writing so innovative, but it was cast beautifully (if you didn't have an interesting, remarkable face, you didn't get into this series), but the idea was so incredibly unique and original. Compare this series to any vapid ""s*it-coms"" on Network TV and you'll see.I didn't know who Ellen Muth (George) was or where she came from, but she's an utterly charming actress with a lot of spunk and grit. I hope she gets cast in movies and TV shows. I want to see more of her. She perfectly grasped a difficult role in which a directionless 18 yr old is killed and suddenly has to deal with Life's (and mostly Death's) huge issues in a hurry.She was just floating through life wasting it when it was taken away in half a heartbeat, now she and the other Reapers are stuck in a terrible Limbo where they must start the mechanics of a terrible freak accident or murder every day.The entire casting was perfect and I worked with a PR robot boss like Delores Herbig (as in herbig brown eyes. George changed that to as in herbig fat a$$-my favorite line.) The show was as funny as Cheers,(funniest episode was when George lost her virginity and the guy never called her back) but deep enough in its philosophy of life to make you tear up. I loved the New Age type music score and the stunning photography of Canada. I loved EVERYTHING about this series. Now it's all gone forever. The truly weird thing was that Rebecca Gayheart, who was killed off in Season one, actually was a reaper in real life, having failed to stop at a crosswalk and killing a child.IF NETWORK TV HAD A BRAIN THEY WOULD BUY UP THESE CANCELLED CABLE SHOWS, CLEAN UP THE LANGUAGE, AND START SHOOTING NEW EPISODES BECAUSE NETWORK TV STINKS AND IS DEVOID OF VERY MUCH CREATIVITY !I, too, will be cancelling Showtime.

He complains that they show is not scary enough.  He complains about the fact that there are separate agents for killing and reaping when it would be more efficient to have one agent do both deeds.  He talks about how the show holds his interest, and then admits he didn't watch it all the way through.  As he calls himself a movie critic, I respectfully submit that he might want to actually criticize the show for what it is, rather than for not being some other show he wishes it were.  It's not scary.  It's not meant to be.  It's a comedy.  Scary may be good, but the chills he's talking about don't belong in this particular show.  Further, anyone who bothers to think about the whole Reaper system as devised for this show will be able to come up with dozens of ways that it doesn't work, doesn't quite make sense.  But that's okay.  This show does not put forth a theological, philosophical, metaphysical or any other workable system of the afterlife, because that's not what it's about.  This show is not about how we die, or why.  This show is about how we live.  And the observations it makes and questions it asks, while occasionally trite, heavyhanded and clich&eacute;d, are far more often quite poignant, profound (as far as television goes), and painfully funny.  This show works far more often than not, and has had me laughing and closer to crying than any other show I can think of.

804132,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0001GF2F6,Only-A-Child,"[3, 3]","IMHO 'Dead Like Me"" is the all-time best television series. Of course I like off-kilter stuff that still makes sense and tries to build themes into the story. For those who have not discovered this gem, imagine a cross between ""Tru Calling"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" that pushes the envelope of irreverence about as much as ""The Family Guy"". Then imagine that behind all the surface irreverence is a transcendent reverence for the human condition. If that level of complexity appeals to you, ""Dead Like Me"" is something you should immediately track down.I was permanently hooked by the conclusion of the ""Pilot"" episode when the resolution did not take the traditional happy path. Instead of being able to intervene and change the destiny of the little girl, George (Ellen Muth) is forced to do her job as a reaper. They go out to the strains of ""Que Sera Sera"", normally very corny but here very ironic. The song was originally written for Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", a film about parents trying to rescue their child which has parallels to what George is attempting. Of course the lyrics and the little girl are symbolic of George and a perfect fit for the ""randomness of life"" theme of ""Dead Like Men"".Each episode has subtle details like this, which may require repeated viewings just to uncover elements that you missed initially. I recommend purchasing a DVD of each season just to have the flexibility to watch several times at your convenience.""Dead Like Me,"" has the mark of writers who aren't thinking about audience reaction or how the Showtime executives will relate to it. The story just pours out with a lot of verve, wit, and audacity.The story is told from the point of view of 18-year-old jaded slacker Georgia ""George"" Lass (Muth), whose voice-over commentary sometimes contradicts what is happening on the screen. Her intelligence and advanced maturity give a world-weary ""whatever"" to the endless bizarre situations she must deal with; ""it looks like death was just my wake-up call"".Any series that focuses on a teenager killed by a falling toilet seat from the space station Mir has something going for it. George is sometimes called Miss Toilet Seat. She is assigned to Rube (Mandy Patinkin from ""Chicago Hope""), who is kind of a platoon sergeant for a small group of ""not always grim"" reapers (soul collectors) who meet in a German Waffle House (listen for the occasional yodeling in the background).There is a running side story about the family George left behind. Her grieving unhappy mother Joy (Cynthia Stevenson),  her professor father, Clancy (Greg Kean), and her sister Reggie (Britt McKillip) who collects toilet seats and may remind you of Dawn Weiner.The reapers might technically be the undead but they interact with the living 24-7; although in a different body than they had when they were alive. There is no pay but they need a place to stay and food to eat so they get day jobs or relieve the dead of their spare cash. They even have pets; George keeps Mr. Blinky, the little girl's frog from the pilot episode.Rube gives each reaper a yellow sticky note with a name, address, and an ETD; it's up to the reaper to collect the soul-ideally just before the actual death, and guide them to the next life. Reapers don't know why they got the job or how long they will be performing it; they accept it because it affords them the opportunity to continue to experience the things they liked and disliked about living; and they are not ready to give these up.As a series ""Dead Like Me"" establishes a complex and consistent set of rules that viewers embrace. The writers are good about playing within this set of constraints and not cheating when they feel lazy or it is otherwise convenient.Humor of various kinds is the predominant emotion but things often get serious and philosophical in a believable and intelligent fashion.""When I was just a little girl I asked my mother what will I be? Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me.Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. Que sera, sera...

I'm oddly envious of those who have yet to experience great shows likeBuffy The Vampire Slayer,Veronica Mars, andSix Feet Underbecause such greatness awaits them.  In buying the first season of ""Dead Like Me,"" I could have guessed it would be one of those wonderful shows, because I'd seen creator Bryan Fuller's work on one of my favorite shows,Wonderfalls.  However, I couldn't have predicted how great the first episode would be.  I swear on all television holy, the pilot of ""Dead Like Me"" is the single best pilot of any show I've ever seen.  It's hilarious, perfectly scripted, wonderfully acted, and is one of the most heartbreaking and gut busting hours of television there is.While the pilot really stand out from the rest of the series as the best episode, the rest of this collection ranges from good to great.  I was a bit worried, because creator Bryan Fuller (the reason I bought this in the first place) left after the fifth episode, due to creative differences with MGM.  Executive Producer John Masius takes on show-runner duties and does a very competent job in keeping the show consistent.  He effortlessly maintained the quirky style that Fuller set up for them, probably due mostly to how nicely Fuller set it up in the first place.  But I've gone on and on about the creative team for long enough.  Let's get down to some Muth.Ellen Muth, who plays the lead character Georgia Lass, is simply brilliant.  She has such a--ironically enough--life to her, giving such a fantastic and layered performance.  I'd go as far as to say she's the best thing this side of Kristen Bell.  The rest of the cast, particularly Mandy Patinkin as Rube and Laura Harris as Daisy Adair, give great performances as well.Each episode will make you laugh, and almost as many will make you cry.  The ride isn't always perfectly smooth--""Nighthawks"" would have been great if the meat of it had been fleshed out instead of loading it with flashback clips--but it's such an enjoyable show that you're more likely to forget its flaws than dwell on them.

804149,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001GF2F6,Robert Moore,"[264, 281]","July 2007 Update!!!!!!  There is going to be a movie!  Shooting has either wrapped up or is close to wrapping up.  Star Ellen Muth goes so far as to hint that that a renewal of the series might be possible.  Details are still forthcoming and apart from the movie (and I'm sorry, I don't know if this is a TV, a direct-to-DVD, or theatrical release) nothing definite is known about the chances of the series being revived, but this is definitely good news.  There is some recasting.  Mandy Patinkin, unfortunately, will not be back as Rube nor will Laura Harris as Daisy.  It appears Rube's character is being replaced by a new head reaper, while a new actress will be playing Daisy.  Otherwise all the other actors will be back.  The rest of my review now appears as it was first written back in February 2004.I would place DEAD LIKE ME on the shortest of short lists of the truly great television shows of the past decade and a half (that date referring to the debut of TWIN PEAKS and a more artistically serious form of television).  Most television shows are unambitious affairs, either because of constraints from the networks or lack of creative talent at the top, but DEAD LIKE ME stands head and shoulders above the competition.  It is not nearly as well as it deserves, primarily because it was a series that appeared on Showtime, which limited its exposure.The television show begins--we learn later--with a toilet seat from the MIR space station rushing to fulfill its destiny on planet earth, namely to ignite into a ball of fire and strike eighteen-year-old Georgia ""George"" Lass, who is taking her lunch break on the first day of her temp assignment with the Happy Times Employment Agency.  George looks up at the descending ball, inaudibly utters the word ""sh#t"" and immediately enters the next stage of her existence, if not her life.  Much to her astonishment, she finds herself standing a few feet away from her body, able to see the living, but herself unseen by all except for a few Grim Reapers, whose job it is to see her into her afterlife.  Usually this involves aiding them to the place where they will spend eternity, but in George's case, she is recruited very much against her will to become a Grim Reaper.  The rest of the first season deals with George's deep resistance to accepting her new vocation, as well as coming to terms with her death, the loss of her family and the discovery of what they unexpectedly meant to her, her need to find a living (it turns out being a Reaper is an unpaid position), her yearning for friends and companionship, and her growing awareness of what it means to be a human being.The show succeeds on virtually every level.  The scripts are consistently superb, many of them by series creator and STAR TREK: VOYAGER alum Bryan Fuller.  The production values are far beyond the normal television series.  The special effects (and there are more than one would expect on a show of this kind) are always striking.  The photography is simply unmatched in television.  I might be inclined to defend the statement that this is the show has the best photography in the history of television.  The camerawork is difficult to praise too highly, with innovative camera angles, zooms, wide angle lenses, and especially filters to make this an incredibly beautiful show to look at.  It was filmed in Vancouver, but it was supposed to be Seattle, but instead of the rain that one anticipates from the climate, there is constant and brilliant sunshine.  Green dominates the screen (the color of growing things?) in every exterior shot.  It is exhilarating to view a series that is made this well.The cast is exquisite.  Ellen Muth plays George, and I'm not sure they could have gotten anyone more perfect to play the role.  She is a perfect blend of sullen, grumpy, vulnerable, and lost, and she manages perfectly to communicate her awakening to life by having died.  She is also one of the more interesting actresses to have appeared in sometime, giving the appearance of being average in appearance while in fact being a striking beauty.  Her undead supervisor Rube is played by the great Mandy Patinkin, and he turns in his usual exquisite performance.  Rebecca Gayheart (who was the original Inara on FIREFLY, but left before the pilot was shot) was superb in the first few episodes as Betty, who was replaced in the team by Laura Harris (of ""24"") as deceased Hollywood bit player and promiscuous party girl Daisy Adair (who continually regales the group with tales of her sexual conquests of movie stars).  Perhaps my favorite moment of the season occurs when the Reapers are forced to catalog and record all the last thoughts of those whose souls they have reaped, and we inadvertently learn Daisy's last thought.  She immediately moves from being an unsympathetic character to one that we love more than a little.  The hard-as-nails Roxy, who works as a meter maid, is played convincingly by Jasmine Guy (of A DIFFERENT WORLD, and the team is rounded out by Callum Blue as the hapless British thief and druggie Mason.  Cynthia Stevenson is great as George's mom.  Special mention has to be made of the supporting character who provides perhaps more hysterical moments during the season than any other, Christine Willes, who plays the unforgettable Dolores Herbig ""Brown Eyes,"" George's supervisor at Happy Times, sometimes friend, and host of her own website called ""Getting Things Done,"" on which she is seen whenever she is home ""getting things done.""After loving the first season of the show, I was tremendously excited about two things:  1) the DVD set coming out and 2) the second season.  I was ecstatic when the show was renewed for a second season.  Despite its quality, Showtime has not worked at developing original series as has its rival HBO.  But last fall they announced the show had been renewed for 2004.  The new episodes should begin appearing in May 2004.  I heartily urge anyone who loves great TV like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, SIX FEET UNDER, and FIREFLY to give this remarkable series a shot.

In the affirmative, like any good dram-edy, or co-ma, (1) the characers are witty, (2) the story-line is interesting, and (3) the situations dance on the pin head of a needle.  But, what really makes this show worth watching is (4) George (Ellen Muth) dealing with her afterlife and family and (5) how her family copes with her death as individuals and as a family.  A good supporting cast and sub-plots help round out why I like this show.  In the negative, (1) this is an ""R""-rated show dealing with sensitive issues and questioning various belief systems: death, the afterlife, ghosts/spirits, good/evil, etc.  I have no problem with sensitive issues or belief questioning, what I don't like is (2) the abundant use of profanity; and (3) some loose ends encountered in the main and sub plots.  Hopefully, in regards to the loose ends, the second season will take care of them.  As for the rest, I hope the language gets cleaned up.

804157,A1VRZQZBK4YVH9,B0001GF2F6,"Running Deer ""Here.  Now.""","[0, 1]","My wife and I bought the first season based on the amazing number of five-star reviews here.  We definitely regret doing so.  We haven't found much of anything to enjoy so far in this first season--the scripts are derivative and repetitive, the dialogue is trivial and uninspired, and many of the situations are just simply silly--they require far too much suspension of disbelief in order to buy what's going on.  We both love the premise and hoped for more, but we didn't get it.  The feeling I get is that the makers are trying too hard with everything, including casting.  Nothing seems natural, and everything seems forced, with a ""this will work here"" feeling behind it all.And while the main character seems to be created to be confused and overwhelmed, she comes across mostly as whiny--and her voice for the narrative voiceovers is simply ineffective.  And while I don't have any problem with vulgarity if it fits in the context of the show, here the curse words seem nothing more than gratuitous.  And much of what goes on seems contrived in order to create confusion that allows for plot twists, such as giving only the initials of the people who are going to die.  It's a contrivance that makes no sense at all, and that is also fairly insulting to a viewer's intelligence.  And the dead having bodies and having to eat and have jobs?  This is another contrivance that allows them to put the main character in a dead-end office job that is one of the most lifeless and boring settings that I've ever seen.It's interesting for a couple of episodes, but our interest died out quickly, and we don't feel any desire at all to see the rest of the season.

Cable TV has given birth to many terrific dramatic series - ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Wire,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Rome,"" etc.  But there haven't been nearly as many hallowed comedies - proof that comedy is darn hard.  ""Dead Like Me"" attempts to balance the scales.George (Ellen Muth) is a typical slacker - she lives at home with her dysfunctional family, interested in nothing and nobody.  She gets stuck in a dead-end job doing filing/data entry when she is killed on her first lunch break by a toilet seat falling from a Russian space station.It only gets better from there.George's soul is met by Rube (the incomparable Mandy Patinkin), who lays out the new rules:  George is a Grim Reaper.  Her job is to take souls from the newly-departed and escort them to their final destination, whatever that may be.  In a lesser series, George would shrug and the stories would focus on the conflict between her slacker-ness and her new job.  While there is some of that humor, the story quickly becomes much deeper as George comes to terms with the life she has led and the life she still has to lead.Still has to lead?  That's right. Grim Reapers are part of the everyday world - they need to work or steal to pay the bills.  And so it is that George finds herself back in the corporate trenches, where she learns more about life after dying than she did before.There are too many perfect moments and perfect casting choices here to mention, so I'll only allude to the highlights.  The pilot episode hits stratospheric heights with George's first ""job,"" to take the soul of an innocent little girl who is scheduled to die - George resists it, naturally, but the show takes this plot point in a delightfully sad, touching way.  Let's just say the Portland's own Pink Martini's rendition of ""Que Sera Sera"" will never be put to better use.And any actress who claims that there are no good roles for overweight women over 35 have completely ignored Christine Willes' brilliant performance as the zany, uptight Delores Herbig - one part Nurse Ratchet and three parts crazy Aunt Flo.  All the actors do great work here, including Cynthia Stevenson as George's uptight, grieving mom Joy (perfect name!), Callum Blue as a British stoner-Grim Reaper, and Jasmine Guy, who leaves ""A Diff'rent World"" far, far behind.Solid writing, impeccable comic timing, and more than its fair share of insight and wisdom make Season One of ""Dead Like Me"" one of the best TV seasons ever.

804175,A3UI51KFK0TKWQ,B0001GF2F6,TA152H,"[16, 20]","The ""other"" dead show?  What a perverse perspective.  In my opinion, this is easily the best series I have watched.  It works on every level -  it is smart, poignant, funny, sad, profound, unpredictable, and amazingly entertaining.  The actors and actresses are very well cast, and the plots are never boring.  The characters are very believable, and the dry, smart humor never goes into the predictable cliches that have become the staple of most sitcoms.This show is so funny and moving, often at the same time, it becomes difficult to even watch other shows.  It also dances along the delicate line of having a message without being preachy.  The dialogue is superb, spoken with perfect timing by excellent actors.  Callum Blue and Ellen Muth could make an ill-humored mailbox laugh, although that could probably said to a lesser degree about all the actors in the show.If you are sick of bland, derivative, childish sitcoms, then get this DVD.  I can not imagine anyone being disappointed in it.This is an addendum to my initial review.  Recently, I had someone visit from Florida who I wanted to show this series to.  She showed absolutely no interest in it, despite my telling her how incredible this series was. She was very reluctant to watch even one show, but I knew she would like it so I persisted in trying.  Eventually I managed to get her to watch an episode.  After that, whenever she would come over she would ask to see more and each night would watch a couple of episodes until it was time to leave.  When she finally went back to Florida she said she was going to buy the DVD set for herself.  She said she loved the show and found the characters all very likeable and believable, and enjoyed the interactions between them very much.  This show is so good one has no doubt that people will like it.

This is the first time we see the parents' marriage trajectory, and realize they were once a happy nuclear family living a very traditional life with apparent satisfaction.

And we see a new side of some of the other characters as well. ""Maybe we are all just temps,"" is the episode's key line. And in that realization of the ephemeral nature of our existence, within a context of recording the last thoughts of the dying ""for posterity,"" we find the essence of human life. We are here but a short while, and when we die it is hardly original, nor in the DLM universe is it generally very happy in the end. Every joy is fleeting. And even death is just another assignment. Yet we can be there for each other, surround ourselves with people we love, and that is the redeeming possibility.Somehow they manage to make all that moroseness humorous and heartfelt.

On a whim (and because of the great reviews) I picked it up. And if I didn't like it I figured I only wasted $20, so it wouldn't be a big deal.I'm just blown away by how cruel and mean the fans of this show are to people who post negative reviews. They give solid reasoning for why they didn't like the show, and fans come along and crucify them for it! Not fair.In all faireness I was blown away by this show; it wasn't horrible at all. It was great. A dark comedy, for sure, as the reapers make light of a situation in everyone's life that NO ONE wants to deal with. Everyone wants to avoid death somehow; reverse the aging process any way they can, either mentally or physically. Sure no one wants to die. But what I learned from this show is that not everyone really lives either. Like the main character, George, has said many times throughout the show that she regretted not living enough.I was expecting something along the lines ofSix Feet Under, like another reviewer said. Putting those 2 show is a no contest--SFU wins big! But Dead Like Me isn't that far behind. It made me laugh at times, and really think seriously about life, and I almost cried.The characters were great, and eventually grew on me. Interesting to see Rube (Mandy Patinkin) who I knew from those stupid drug commercials do something with his career (though I guess he did those commercials AFTER the show was cancelled). And Laura Harris from some Nickelodeon show I saw as a kid who replaced Rebecca Gayheart, was an added blessing. Wasn't too crazy about the corny music throughout the show, though, despite it being composed by Stewart Copeland. But I didn't let that hold me back.

804181,A3FK5GMFW9KSWH,B0001GF2F6,Tiberius,"[1, 2]","What do I like in this series? The new perspective: life starts (or could start in our world) after death for some people; good characters (see the details below), though the Mason character loses his flavour by the second season and Betty is lost in the fifth episode (the fourth on the second disk); and of course humour, which is sarcastic and sometimes morbid, but perfectly fits a sitcom.So, the characters:--George, most of the time rebelling against any authority but gradually recognises that human relationships are important.--Rube, the boss whom George often drives mad but takes a (fatherly) liking of the wild but at the same time extremely vulnerable girl. He tries to be a good and strong foreman with a sometimes abrasive manner.--Mason, the crazy and amoral English guy, a hapless fellow, who has drinking and drug problems, he has no luck with human relationships, lacks the ability to form any.--Roxy, the traffic warden, no-nonsense hard-working lady, who mostly manages to hide her emotions but it does not mean they don't exist.--Betty, the one who really enjoys being a grim reaper, it seems to be a vocation for her. She is genuinely nice to the would be dead and never lets them die without making them smile first.--Daisy (who stands in for Betty after she leaves), the blond one, egotistic, gets what she wants and first does not seem to care about other people's feelings, though she begins to learn something on this front.It's four stars because the last three episodes reek of financial constraints: loads of flashbacks and reminiscences.

But among parables about living, DLM ranks, to my mind at least, as one of the best I've seen. As a story writer myself, I find forced to admit that this is probably better than anything I could have cooked up myself. Which is a big admission.Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, Angel and Firefly; a man I admire), if he's honest about it, will probably eating his Absurdist heart out (and if he isn't, he ought to be). DLM, despite its lack of the 'spectacular', or maybe because of it, makes its point(s) with clarity and, often, very touching poignancy. And with soul.It addresses that aspect of 'teen angst' that's not all about 'social acceptance' and the pitfalls of high-school life, but about the profound loneliness that accompanies the clarity of vision that comes upon one in a period of one's life where one is old enough to understand a great many things, but not yet too old to have had the wool pulled over one's eyes by the world and its necessities. And why doesn't everybody else understand it as well? It's so obvious, is it not? How can anybody miss it?DLM also deals with DEATH. Yes, I know that's pretty obvious, but this obviousness hides the truth that in our dealings with death, imagined or real, we define our position in and attitude to life. DLM's dealing with death is relentless and never lets off. Every episode leaves you with another perspective on the subject; and quite possibly with one that you might not actually have thought of.Take all that together and you have what might be the most powerful show of recent years.

804187,A3QJT3VQ5ZA8FB,B0001GF2F6,"WayneXtreme ""Reading Fiend""","[4, 4]","Dead Like Me is a show about Grim Reapers and their job, taking souls.  George (the main character) is the newest formerly alive person to become a reaper after she's struck down by a toilet seat from the Mir Space Station.  While alive, George was an 18 year old, fresh dropout from college and is now stuck in deadend clerical job, until she comes face to face with a very hot and very fast falling toilet seat.As a Reaper, she joins the division that involves, Murder, Suicides, and other incidents.  Her co-workers in this particular division are Roxy, a tough as nails meter maid; Betty a funny/quirky woman that loves to live in the lap of luxury; Mason a Brit that has a penchant for all sorts of drugs as well as partaking in shady deals in order to suppliment his income; and then there's Rube, the boss for the division who hands out the days assignments, Rube is in charge of trying to keep the group out of trouble (especially the newbie George).Together, the reapers get their assignments, go out and collect souls from those who are supposed to die in order for them to keep from suffering the pain of their tragic death (and in some cases to prevent the damage done to them being reflected in the person's soul).  Along with the job of being a Reaper, they have to find a way to earn money, whether it be legal or illegal.  Since the group is made up of the undead, they still have to eat, drink, have clothes, and a place to sleep, since Reaping is a job that offers nothing in the line of compensation.This first season chronicles the wacky adventures and in most cases misadventures.  One of the coolest things about this show is by watching out for the deaths that come about.  Sort of like watching C.S.I. or Six Feet Under, the deaths are always strange/cool and some are even a little comical.I first saw the show after it was cancelled on the Sci-Fi channel.  After I purchased this DVD from Amazon, well, I was surprised at all the...shall we say colorful language that appears in the show.  Still, this show is hilarious and I would recommend it to everyone out there who wants a good laugh.",5,One of the Greatest Shows Ever,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2116,"['Dead', 'Me', 'show', 'Grim', 'Reapers', 'job', 'taking', 'souls', 'George', 'main', 'character', 'newest', 'formerly', 'alive', 'person', 'become', 'reaper', 'struck', 'down', 'toilet', 'seat', 'Mir', 'Space', 'Station', 'alive', 'George', 'was', '18', 'year', 'old', 'fresh', 'dropout', 'college', 'now', 'stuck', 'deadend', 'clerical', 'job', 'face', 'face', 'very', 'hot', 'very', 'fast', 'falling', 'toilet', 'seat.As', 'Reaper', 'division', 'Murder', 'Suicides', 'other', 'incidents', 'co-workers', 'particular', 'division', 'are', 'Roxy', 'tough', 'nails', 'meter', 'maid', 'Betty', 'funny/quirky', 'woman', 'live', 'lap', 'luxury', 'Mason', 'Brit', 'penchant', 'sorts', 'drugs', 'as', 'well', 'partaking', 'shady', 'deals', 'order', 'suppliment', 'income', 'then', 'Rube', 'boss', 'division', 'who', 'out', 'days', 'assignments', 'Rube', 'charge', 'trying', 'keep', 'group', 'trouble', 'especially', 'newbie', 'George', '.Together', 'reapers', 'get', 'assignments', 'go', 'out', 'collect', 'souls', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'die', 'order', 'keep', 'suffering', 'pain', 'tragic', 'death', 'cases', 'prevent', 'damage', 'done', 'being', 'reflected', 'person', 'soul', 'job', 'being', 'Reaper', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'earn', 'money', 'be', 'legal', 'illegal', 'group', 'made', 'undead', 'still', 'have', 'eat', 'drink', 'have', 'clothes', 'place', 'sleep', 'Reaping', 'job', 'nothing', 'line', 'compensation.This', 'first', 'season', 'wacky', 'adventures', 'most', 'cases', 'misadventures', 'One', 'coolest', 'things', 'show', 'watching', 'out', 'deaths', 'come', 'Sort', 'watching', 'C.S.I', 'Six', 'Feet', 'deaths', 'are', 'always', 'strange/cool', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'comical.I', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'well', 'was', 'surprised', 'shall', 'say', 'colorful', 'language', 'show', 'Still', 'show', 'hilarious', 'would', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'who', 'good', 'laugh']",Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season

Apart from the fact that this was a Showtime series (and thus the ""TV Ratings"" gloves were off for the producers), this show is a one-two punch of being very entertaining...and sucking you in the more episodes you watch.  Halfway through series one the writing goes from ""good"" to ""excellent"" and the characters start to come into their own.If you're not familiar with the concept, this is as spoiler-free as I can make it:  when some people die, they don't get to ""move on"" to the hereafter.  Instead, they are called ""Reapers"", and they've been put in charge of being present when people die.  Living half in and half out of the real world, Reapers have to both tag the unfortunate for death (to release their souls) and guide the newly-departed souls into the beyond.  The show doesn't try to put any religious messages into the concept--instead, there's something amusing about the way they make reaping seem like yet another bureaucratic process that keeps the wheels of civilization turning.  The point isn't the reaping--the point is the characters, and that's why it's really interesting.It's a real pity this show only lasted two seasons (and a separate movie)--I have a feeling it could have gone a lot farther.  The comedy is grim and macabre, but not mean-spirited.  It's also not very gory.
