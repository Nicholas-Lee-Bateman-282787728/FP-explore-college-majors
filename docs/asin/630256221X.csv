Must have been the director, or maybe it does not show its age well. The movie arrived quickly and was in very good shape, it's a shame it was not a better film.",5,Great true story,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,291,"['true', 'story', 'be', 'honest', 'TV', 'fare', 'Something', 'acting', 'lighting', 'not', 'seem', 'right', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'director', 'maybe', 'not', 'show', 'age', 'well', 'movie', 'arrived', 'quickly', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'shame', 'was', 'not', 'better', 'film']",N/A

It was based on a true story about a women who decided to get an abortion because there was something wrong with her baby. This was before abortion was legal and when word got out it caused quite a scandal, and the hospital couldn't do the abortion anymore (her doctor had recommended it, and the hospital had already done other abortions- I found it interesting that doctors and hospitals found ways to get around the abortion laws to do abortions before they were legal)This movie was very emotional, as well a interesting and important historically.I only wish it was out in dvd- and maybe with a documentary about what really happened, and about the history of abortions, and so on as the extras.I highly recomend this movie.",3,3 and a half stars,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,753,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'women', 'who', 'decided', 'get', 'abortion', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'baby', 'was', 'abortion', 'was', 'legal', 'when', 'word', 'got', 'caused', 'quite', 'scandal', 'hospital', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'abortion', 'anymore', 'doctor', 'had', 'recommended', 'hospital', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'other', 'abortions-', 'found', 'interesting', 'doctors', 'hospitals', 'found', 'ways', 'get', 'abortion', 'laws', 'do', 'abortions', 'were', 'legal', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'important', 'historically.I', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'out', 'dvd-', 'maybe', 'documentary', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'history', 'abortions', 'so', 'extras.I', 'highly', 'recomend', 'movie']",N/A
