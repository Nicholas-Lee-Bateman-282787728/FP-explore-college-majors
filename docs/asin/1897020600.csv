There is no  foul language in this DVD since it was done with a christian audience in mind. He starts out making fun of Subway(Singing a song) then some of the many thing he goes into are the songs that are sung at church and what would happen if the words where changed to the songs to fit some of the donors to the churches.

I want quality, not evangelical Christian PC.This show is laugh out loud funny the whole way. You don't have to be a Christian to appreciate most of his schtick, although you might get lost toward the end when he ""reimagines"" familiar (and tired, old) praise songs. He riffs on parenting, kids, shopping, traveling... universal human experiences that resonate with a broad audience.The best part of Christian comedy is that it's funny without veering into crass or offensive territory. I think comedians have to work harder for their laughs if they aren't using that crutch. For a sample of his humor, check it out on youtube, especially the clip titled ""I'm Not a Rock Star.""I probably would have given this DVD five stars if I had watched it maybe a half hour at a time, instead of all the way through. The comedy becomes a little repetitive at this length. And, I'm not one to appreciate humor about bodily functions, so some of the jokes didn't appeal to me.
