The costumes, scenery, and choreography are marvelous.HOWEVER -- Sutherland was almost 62 when she did this, and was no longer physically or musically worthy of this role.  Her voice is weak, wavering, off-key.  She is too heavy and lacking in energy to be a sprightly merry widow.  This might be tolerable in a cameo appearance for old time's sake, but not in the starring role that overshadows all other parts.  I want my money back.Why did Sutherland ever go along with releasing this blemish on her heavenly legacy of masterpieces?  Did she long to experience once more the intoxication of the fawning crowds and adulation her name alone might bring?  Was it money?  Even if Sutherland and hubby Bonynge (the conductor) were contentedly rich from their many deserving efforts of previous decades, others might have pressed for one more big profit.  Too bad.Clearly, it must have been Sutherland's star power and birthplace, not the actual performance, which had the crowd in her hometown (Sydney) cheering and applauding so wildly.  I cannot believe that they (or any knowledgeable reviewer with normal hearing) could honestly enjoy Sutherland's embarrassing performance, which someone along the way should have withheld from release.UPDATE: We no longer have much reason to buy this DVD.  Not only is the San Francisco Opera's four-star English performance now on the market, but five-star versions in German (the original language almost always fits the music and rhythm better) are available.  The Z&uuml;rich production (Lehar: Die lustige Witwe) starring Dagmar Schellenberger, Rodney Gilfry, Piotr Beczala, Gabriel Bermudez, and Franz Welser-M&ouml;st is marvelous, and I bought it, but my fave is the 2005 centennial performance (Lehar - Die Lustige Witwe) from the M&ouml;rbisch Lake Festival with Margarita de Arellano, Mathias Hausmann, Elisabeth Starzinger, Harald Serafin, and Marwan Shamiyeh, produced by ORF, the Austrian Radio & TV network.  Both German-language versions come with subtitles and a good printed synopsis, although the wonderful music and singing matched with the visual treats are quite sufficient without precise understanding of all the words.  Translations of this work must be highly approximate anyway, struggling with rhyme, meter, and Austrian German multilingual wordplay (with at least three other languages).  The M&ouml;rbisch and Z&uuml;rich casts perform with the chemistry and sexy energy that the mess from Sydney lacks.  Without some special reason, purchase of Bonynge & Sutherland's DVD from Opera Australia (not to be confused with Austria) would misuse funds better spent elsewhere, especially for the M&ouml;rbisch and Z&uuml;rich versions.",2,Sutherland tarnishes her star; should have quit long ago,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,2817,"['video', 'sound', 'are', 'scrumptious', 'Lehar', 'music', 'appealing', 'lively', 'ever', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'choreography', 'are', 'marvelous.HOWEVER', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'almost', '62', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'physically', 'musically', 'worthy', 'role', 'voice', 'weak', 'wavering', 'off-key', 'too', 'heavy', 'lacking', 'energy', 'be', 'sprightly', 'merry', 'widow', 'might', 'be', 'tolerable', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'old', 'time', 'sake', 'not', 'starring', 'role', 'other', 'parts', 'want', 'money', 'back.Why', 'did', 'Sutherland', 'ever', 'go', 'along', 'releasing', 'blemish', 'heavenly', 'legacy', 'masterpieces', 'Did', 'long', 'experience', 'once', 'more', 'intoxication', 'fawning', 'crowds', 'adulation', 'name', 'alone', 'might', 'bring', 'Was', 'money', 'Even', 'Sutherland', 'hubby', 'Bonynge', 'conductor', 'were', 'contentedly', 'rich', 'many', 'deserving', 'efforts', 'previous', 'decades', 'others', 'might', 'have', 'pressed', 'one', 'more', 'big', 'profit', 'Too', 'bad.Clearly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Sutherland', 'star', 'power', 'birthplace', 'not', 'actual', 'performance', 'had', 'crowd', 'hometown', 'Sydney', 'cheering', 'applauding', 'so', 'wildly', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'knowledgeable', 'reviewer', 'normal', 'hearing', 'could', 'honestly', 'enjoy', 'Sutherland', 'embarrassing', 'performance', 'someone', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'withheld', 'release.UPDATE', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'much', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Not', 'only', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Opera', 'four-star', 'English', 'performance', 'now', 'market', 'five-star', 'versions', 'German', 'original', 'language', 'almost', 'always', 'music', 'rhythm', 'better', 'are', 'available', 'Z', 'uuml', 'rich', 'production', 'Lehar', 'Die', 'Witwe', 'starring', 'Dagmar', 'Schellenberger', 'Rodney', 'Gilfry', 'Piotr', 'Beczala', 'Gabriel', 'Bermudez', 'Franz', 'Welser-M', 'ouml', 'marvelous', 'bought', 'fave', '2005', 'centennial', 'performance', 'Lehar', 'Die', 'Lustige', 'Witwe', 'M', 'ouml', 'Lake', 'Festival', 'Margarita', 'de', 'Arellano', 'Mathias', 'Hausmann', 'Elisabeth', 'Starzinger', 'Harald', 'Serafin', 'Marwan', 'Shamiyeh', 'produced', 'ORF', 'Austrian', 'Radio', 'TV', 'network', 'German-language', 'versions', 'come', 'subtitles', 'good', 'printed', 'synopsis', 'wonderful', 'music', 'singing', 'matched', 'visual', 'treats', 'are', 'quite', 'sufficient', 'precise', 'understanding', 'words', 'Translations', 'work', 'must', 'be', 'highly', 'approximate', 'anyway', 'struggling', 'rhyme', 'meter', 'Austrian', 'German', 'multilingual', 'wordplay', 'least', 'three', 'other', 'languages', 'M', 'ouml', 'rbisch', 'Z', 'uuml', 'rich', 'casts', 'perform', 'chemistry', 'sexy', 'energy', 'mess', 'Sydney', 'lacks', 'special', 'reason', 'purchase', 'Bonynge', 'Sutherland', 'DVD', 'Opera', 'Australia', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Austria', 'would', 'misuse', 'funds', 'better', 'spent', 'elsewhere', 'especially', 'M', 'ouml', 'rbisch', 'Z', 'uuml', 'rich', 'versions']",N/A

Sutherland sang only one thing (in my opinion) poorly, and that was I think the last number in the show, what is commonly called The Merry Widow Waltz.  She sang it in her ""low voice"" (to take an expression from Kiri Te Kanawa) and I didn't like it.  The rest of it (what there WAS of it!) was wonderful.  Too much dialogue.  Too much farce (it was stupid).  I've heard several different versions of this score, and except a few tunes, they all seem to have different songs in them.  Which reminds me, my preference (even over Sutherland) is Studer's CD of this show.  Glorious!  I may be mistaken, but I think, in fact am almost positive, that some of the songs were cut (to make room for that boring, idiotic dialogue?  And what was the point of all the dancing, the choreography of which was NOT particularly enthralling?).  Finally, it was a pleasure, a treasure to hear Sutherland talk in English at great length, she is one of my favorite people, and now at last I know what her speaking voice sounded like.  The English lyrics were pedestrian, and they might as well have left it all in German it was so hard to understand what anyone was saying.  I liked the 3rd act the best.  And I knew I was in trouble (like a dish of cold water in the face) when Danilo spoke instead of singing his first number.

424419,A1JEFESGLIS076,6304469586,rsoonsa,"[2, 3]","Filmed during a live performance 3 February, 1988, within Sydney's justly esteemed opera house, Franz Lehar's Merry Widow is sung here by soon to be retired Joan Sutherland, in addition to a splendid supporting cast, with Richard Bonynge leading his established pick-up orchestra, here dubbed The Elizabethan Philharmonic, in an outstanding rendition of Lehar's scoring for an evergreen operetta that depicts in spirit and particulars Belle &Eacute;poque Paris.  From the original, a stage play of intrigue within high society that debuted in 1861, WIDOW (Lustige Witwe) is adapted wonderfully well under the direction of Lotfi Mansouri for this production made for Australian television that includes enormously agreeable ""business"" and choreography in support of the vocal soloists who act their parts in pleasing fashion for the familiar Christopher Hassall English language translation, from which one finds that only Act III differs substantially from the standard libretto, although the entire work's origins do frequently seem to be grounded at D'Oyly Carte rather than in Vienna.  Several critical observers have stated that, at 61 years, Sutherland is too old to play this part of Anna Glawari, ""The Merry Widow"", additionally commenting upon her prognathousness and girth, and it is manifest that the diva does not readily rise to her feet from a sitting position.  Nonetheless, she is palpably comfortable in the role, and it is clear that her musicality is as estimable as ever.  Indeed, the only obvious clinker here comes from below the boards, within the orchestra's string section.  Although never sylphlike, Sutherland's musical career has been aptly advanced by husband/coach/manager Bonynge (who certainly knew a good thing when he heard one) and opera lovers the world over have gladly sanctioned Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to place the soprano firmly into her most successful characterizations, each of which her followers have greeted with idolization.  A house filled to capacity and ripe with esteem for Sutherland as a national treasure, evinces its satisfaction during balloon popping curtain calls, after previously halting the action often with its applause, notably following Sutherland's ardent show-stopping rendering of ""Vilja"", sung amid opulently created period ornamentation.  Despite Sutherland's accomplished turn as Anna, the evening belongs to tenor Ronald Stevens who, as male lead Danilo Danilovitch, captures each of his scenes through his gusto.  The striking soprano Anne-Maree McDonald sings well and acts gracefully as Valencienne, while other supporting cast members are, for the most part, at least proficient.  The WIDOW's narrative has been in a continuing condition of flux since its inception and this film's alternate English translation has been particularly favoured in Australia for many years.  Directed with exhilaration and designed with a refined eye for detail, this whimsical musical play is certain to be welcomed into an operetta lover's cinema library.
