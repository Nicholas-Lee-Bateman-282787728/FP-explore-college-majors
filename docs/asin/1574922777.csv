She must struggle through this dilemma in order to reach her true happiness.The movie itself is, of course, slow-paced, dialogue-heavy, and on the dramatic side; nothing wrong with these qualities per se except that I did not find the story, as it is presented in the movie, to be very interesting.The combination of an uninteresting story along with the slow-pace made it a rather dull experience to view this movie.

Originally produced as a Hallmark Hall of Fame  presentation, this absorbing and all too human drama deserves much more widespread  attention.Though it may not follow the book in every respect, it nonetheless stands on it's own.  (And --please!--readersof the book should ALLOW it to stand on it's own, as any film is meant to do,  judging it on IT'S OWN merits and not against their memory of the book!)Well written and beautifully filmed, it features outstanding  performances by a well rounded cast of uniformly excellent actors, not the least of whom is star Angela Lansbury.In a day in which grown children find it all too easy to  blame their parents for every childhood shortcoming, the warmth, compassion, and uplifting  message of this filmic gem can help bring healing and insight to many of today'ssearching ""thirtysomethings"".  This isn't just a movie, it's a healing and enlightening experience.  It can alsobring encouragement and support to today's ""sixty-somethings"" who have felt the brunt of false guilt andundeserved criticism from ungrateful offspring.Unavailable on television or video for many years, truly this is a film not to be missed.

191116,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1574922777,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","This 1989 adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's The Shell Seekers runs at around 102 minutes. The 2006 production on the other hand, Shell Seekers (Widescreen), runs at 3 hours, and is not only well-cast in general, but also more faithful to the novel. The saving grace of this 1989 production is Angela Lansbury's performance as Penelope Keeling, a woman who despite having missed some opportunities in life, having suffered the loss of her greatest love, and having the ignominy of being surrounded by a pathetic lot of individuals, two of whom are her own children, continues to maintain a positive outlook on life, and tries to make the best out of problematic situations. In the end, she finds the peace she is looking for, and is content.The short length of time for this production doesn't allow it to do justice to the novel. Too many scenes in the book have been cut out and some are meshed together, and the result is a rather choppy production. There are some positives though, which is why I gave it three stars. Angela Lansbury, one of my favorite actresses, delivers a compelling and heartfelt performance, though the constraints of the script doesn't allow her to express the full range of Penelope Keeling's character. The cinematography is beautiful: Penelope's beautiful home, the scenes at Cornwall, etc. The secondary characters, especially those who play her children, could have been better cast, but they do an OK job overall. I did take issue with some of the blatant errors in translating the novel onto the screen. In this adaptation, Penelope's mother-in-law, an odious woman, is still alive, and is portrayed as being an overbearing woman, constantly criticizing Penelope. In the novel, the MIL is dead when Penelope is shown in her older years. The 2006 adaptation achieves this nicely by using the flashback technique effectively to indicate the state of relations between Penelope and her MIL.The 2006 production, due to its longer running time, is able to develop the characters with greater depth, and the scenes of Penelope's past, back during the war, provide enough filler information as to Penelope's life then so as to help the viewer understand her better in the present. This is sadly missing from the 1989 production, and the flashback scenes are altogether too brief.On the whole, I think this is worth a watch for Lansbury's performance and the cinematography, but I would certainly recommend the 2006 adaptation, and of course, the source work.",3,"Terrible adaptation of the source work, but worth watching for Ms. Lansbury's performance",1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2484,"['1989', 'adaptation', 'Rosamunde', 'Pilcher', 'Shell', 'Seekers', '102', 'minutes', '2006', 'production', 'other', 'hand', 'Shell', 'Seekers', 'Widescreen', '3', 'hours', 'not', 'only', 'well-cast', 'general', 'also', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'saving', 'grace', '1989', 'production', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'performance', 'Penelope', 'Keeling', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'life', 'having', 'suffered', 'loss', 'greatest', 'love', 'having', 'ignominy', 'being', 'surrounded', 'pathetic', 'lot', 'individuals', 'two', 'whom', 'are', 'own', 'children', 'maintain', 'positive', 'outlook', 'life', 'tries', 'make', 'best', 'problematic', 'situations', 'end', 'peace', 'looking', 'content.The', 'short', 'length', 'time', 'production', ""n't"", 'allow', 'do', 'justice', 'novel', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'are', 'meshed', 'together', 'result', 'rather', 'choppy', 'production', 'are', 'positives', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'compelling', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'constraints', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'express', 'full', 'range', 'Penelope', 'Keeling', 'character', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'Penelope', 'beautiful', 'home', 'scenes', 'Cornwall', 'etc', 'secondary', 'characters', 'especially', 'who', 'play', 'children', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'do', 'OK', 'job', 'overall', 'did', 'take', 'issue', 'blatant', 'errors', 'translating', 'novel', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Penelope', 'mother-in-law', 'odious', 'woman', 'still', 'alive', 'portrayed', 'being', 'overbearing', 'woman', 'constantly', 'criticizing', 'Penelope', 'novel', 'MIL', 'dead', 'when', 'Penelope', 'shown', 'older', 'years', '2006', 'adaptation', 'nicely', 'using', 'flashback', 'technique', 'effectively', 'indicate', 'state', 'relations', 'Penelope', 'MIL.The', '2006', 'production', 'due', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'able', 'develop', 'characters', 'greater', 'depth', 'scenes', 'Penelope', 'past', 'back', 'war', 'provide', 'enough', 'filler', 'information', 'Penelope', 'life', 'then', 'so', 'help', 'viewer', 'understand', 'better', 'present', 'sadly', 'missing', '1989', 'production', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'altogether', 'too', 'whole', 'think', 'watch', 'Lansbury', 'performance', 'cinematography', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', '2006', 'adaptation', 'course', 'source', 'work']",Shell Seekers VHS
