747606,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00008V621,A. Burchfield,"[22, 25]","About the best that I can say about this movie is that the nudity on the beach is treated as no big deal, in fact if that's the reason you're thinking about buying it- better go buy something from Playboy.I ""get"" the plotline- sort of- but the story is presented in a disjointed manner with several segments split apart by bits of other stories put in between. I found the people to generally be a bunch of losers that I had a hard time caring about and so boring that a viewer might want to fast forward (don't do that- you might miss some of whatever you consider to be the ""good"" bits).It appears to have been filmed with one camera held in a stationary position, not a lot of movement, with just one small microphone- the sound could've been better, many times you'll know a person is undoubtedly nude but the camera is held above the level you'd need to see any of it. I'm not sure how clear the original film was, the DVD seems soft focused to me with the color maybe a little bit off.The subject matter is treated respectfully (the nudity part is fairly well so anyway, you never really get a good look at most of the beach itself or most of the nudity for that matter) but the romance/life part is just so BORING!Unlike some I found the cast to be generally attractive enough but I pretty much wish I hadn't bought the DVD, try looking for it in used/good condition at a cheaper price.",2,"If you're on a tight budget, don't bother with this one",1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1393,"['best', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'nudity', 'beach', 'treated', 'big', 'deal', 'fact', 'reason', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'it-', 'better', 'go', 'buy', 'something', 'Playboy.I', 'get', 'plotline-', 'sort', 'of-', 'story', 'presented', 'disjointed', 'manner', 'several', 'segments', 'split', 'apart', 'bits', 'other', 'stories', 'put', 'found', 'people', 'generally', 'be', 'bunch', 'losers', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'caring', 'about', 'so', 'boring', 'viewer', 'might', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'that-', 'might', 'miss', 'consider', 'be', 'good', 'bits', '.It', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'one', 'camera', 'held', 'stationary', 'position', 'not', 'lot', 'movement', 'just', 'one', 'small', 'microphone-', 'sound', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'many', 'times', ""'ll"", 'know', 'person', 'undoubtedly', 'nude', 'camera', 'held', 'level', ""'d"", 'need', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'clear', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'DVD', 'soft', 'focused', 'color', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'off.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'treated', 'respectfully', 'nudity', 'part', 'fairly', 'well', 'so', 'anyway', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'most', 'beach', 'most', 'nudity', 'matter', 'romance/life', 'part', 'just', 'so', 'BORING', 'found', 'cast', 'be', 'generally', 'attractive', 'enough', 'pretty', 'much', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'bought', 'DVD', 'try', 'looking', 'used/good', 'condition', 'cheaper', 'price']",N/A

747608,A367WQ4TQQAU3M,B00008V621,C. Waid,"[6, 10]","This appears to be little more than a student film or low budget indie film by some well meaning nudist, but there is little to be gained other than the gratuitous use of nudity.  Several disparate stories are linked loosely by the location-the boring guy who gets dumped by his girlfriend for a wordless magician who proceeds to pull a rabbit out of a hat(literally!).  The guy on a dating service fix-up(on a nude beach-yeah!) who gets fixed up with his current girlfriend that he has been having problems with.  The fat chick who has break-up sex with her boyfried only to discover he's superglued them together(really!) and have to be carted off to hospital to be separated.  But the most disturbing vignette, is the ignored wife who is conducting illicit affairs with not one but two men, both at the beach vying for her. She then meets her therapist and he informs her in his best Ludwig von Drake accent that she should come behind the ""wocks"" for some"" ""wevolutionawy serapy""  After which she meets her father who tells her that no love is greater than that between a father and daughter and that they should explore that-and off she goes again!Combined with the flatulent ice-cream vendor who hurtles up and down the beach in his van seemingly oblivious to any body and almost running bathers over, the naked opera singer on the cliff top (haven't we all seen that?), and the pubic grooming, this film is to be avoided by serious nudists and titillation seekers alike.
