No big hoopla, blood and guts, apocalyptic, superhero, overly dramatic, dirty politics sexcapades. It's just a pleasurable small Norwegian film with a wonderful premise, fantastic characters, and beautiful visuals. There is action and suspense in the fact that a young girl is trying to escape from her captors, and survive. Her escape is aided by a younger child (the leader Dagmar's so-called daughter) whom she has befriended: they eventually get away together. As the two of them venture into the wilderness trying desperately to outrun their huntsmen abductors, they form a tight sister bond that will definitely assist in their survival.This movie has all the elements of really good entertainment.

You know, pretty much, how they're going to end, so you hope the ride is worth the fare. his isn't the best of them but the plus points far outweigh the minuses.Here's the scoop. It's the second half of the 14th century in Sweden. Lawlessness abounds as the plague has finally subsided. A family of four hits the road and is set upon by a small band of brigands headed up by a fierce female. They kill mom, dad and the boy but grab the girl to act as sister to her &#34;daughter.&#34; The girl escapes with the help of said daughter and the chase is on.This is a way cool flick.It's shot and directed extremely well. Great attention is paid to the landscape. The viewer travels between lush forests, serious waterways with equally serious waterfalls and unforgiving stretches of craggy rocks. Many of he chase sequences are scripted well. Others have been seen way too many times. There are also some aspects of the script that telegraph, way too blatantly, what will happen later on. These things were a bit annoying but other aspects of the script unfolded nicely. Such as how did a woman come to control this group of men? Where did her &#34;daughter&#34; come from? Why is her daughter so eager to help a stranger. These all unfold evenly and satisfyingly throughout the movie.

The marketing artwork, packaging and description make it seem like this might be a cheesy kid's adventure film.  So I strapped in and hoped for the best.  And as is often the case with relatively low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  There isn't a whole lot of plot in this spare 80 minute film, but the action sequences were well executed and the movie held my interest throughout.  The title really explains the entire film premise.  It's about an escape with not much back story or explanation either before or after the event.  By keeping things simple and straightforward, however, the movie succeeds in telling a concise little story.  It may not be a great movie, but it is entertaining.  The DVD/Blu-ray has the option of an English dubbed soundtrack, but I watched the film with subtitles.  I can't, therefore, comment on the quality of the dub which is oftentimes distracting and annoying to my personal taste.The movie is set ten years after the Black Death has decimated the population.  A lone family traveling the desolate countryside is attacked by a gang of outlaws.  After the bloody encounter, the teenaged daughter is taken back to the savage's camp and kept as a prisoner.  She forms a tentative bond with another young girl, but her fate seems all but sealed unless she can take matters into her own hands.  What must she do?  She must escape, you guessed it.  Never mind where she's going, she has to assert independence, courage, and ingenuity if she plans to survive this ordeal.  Most of the movie has our hero on the run, and her pursuers following closely.  That's about it!The look of ""Escape"" is quite impressive.  The scenery is spectacular and the action sequences are well done.  For a low-budget endeavor, the filmmaking is quite accomplished.  Young actress Isabel Christine Andreasen is believable and appealing, but it is  Ingrid Bols Berdal who gets the film's showiest role as villainous Dagmar.  I would love to have seen a movie about her character, she seems like a fascinating subject!  In the end, you're not particularly connected to the fate of any of the characters but that didn't bother me.  Because the movie had such a limited scope and modest ambitions, it worked just fine.  I'm not particularly raving, but I enjoyed myself.  Overall, about 3 1/2 stars.  I'll round up for Berdal's work as Dagmar.

1634813,A1YVSRX09MZABR,B00BI6SKYI,S. Donovan,"[0, 2]","****Contains major spoilers****Normally, I LOVE foreign movies, particularly movies from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This one, however, rubbed me the wrong way. The leader of the gang (Dagmar) a woman, is the stereotypically ruthless shrew, unable to handle real power, so she's evolved into a battle-ax. (Yawn).Come on! This isn't 1950!I get it that she was wronged by locals who believed she was a witch. She and her little girl were subjected to trial by water or indicium aquae. In theory, water was supposed to reject the ""unholy""  including witches and vampires. Therefore, if the accused floats, it was proof of guilt, since the water was thought to have spit him/her out.  If the accused sank, this was proof of innocence, since the water was said to swallow him or her up.  (Either way, the poor soul drowned).By some strange miracle, Dagmar survives to become the ultimate warrior woman/bada**/shrew. (Evil Xena, MOVE OVER!) Dagmar, pregnant at the time, not only watches helplessly as her little girl is drowned, but also miscarries. As a result of these injustices, she becomes every villager's nightmare.  (For some reason, she focuses her rage on Signe, whom she doesn't even know.)Pop psychology notwithstanding, it's disappointing to see the same old stereotypes taken out of mothballs for use in the movie Escape.  Dagmar, who survives the water test to acquire ultimate battle skills, focuses her angst on her FEMALE adversary Signe. Signe, Dagmar's polar opposite, is a virginal woman-child who becomes the hero to save Frigg, the little girl that Dagmar kidnapped (?) to replace her own child (children) lost at the hands of villagers. The sensitive, compassionate characters in this movie are, of course, MEN.Dagmar, mentally unhinged, uses her crossbow to kill her male companion who is only trying to protect little Frigg.The Dagmar character was awful. We are supposed to believe that Dagmar goes from loving mother to dangerous psychopath as a result of injustice inflicted by the villagers? (Human beings are just not that simple). Next, Signe developes from a child uncertain of how she will survive herself to having battle skills sufficient to wipe out Dagmar's whole gang and defeat Dagmar, thanks to a 5 minute lesson on bear hunting.  (Watch the struggle with Dagmar - she makes mistakes no skilled warrior ever would).Probably the most unbelievable is Signe's fall down the side of a cliff, which easily must have been at least an 80 foot drop! The chance of surviving such a fall WITH life threatening injury - is very slim. (Survival unscathed is nearly unheard of).  At the very least, Signe's internal injuries would be severe. No way she would have come away from such a fall without a closed head injury. Yet she wakes up, stands up and shakes herself off. Sorry to be so picky, but...Bad, bad, bad!!see:http://www.sciforums.com/showthread.php?53810-Lethal-jump-heightOn the other side of the coin, the cinematography is wonderful. The actor who plays Dagmar is quite stunning. if eye candy is enough to sustain your attention, Escape has enough of that.  If you don't care about writing, plot, and aren't offended by sexist cliches, you'll probably love this movie. If you require deep character development and protagonists that make sense, skip this one.",2,Every silly stereotype rolled into one movie....,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,3296,"['****Contains', 'major', 'spoilers****Normally', 'LOVE', 'foreign', 'movies', 'particularly', 'movies', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'one', 'however', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'leader', 'gang', 'Dagmar', 'woman', 'stereotypically', 'ruthless', 'shrew', 'unable', 'handle', 'real', 'power', 'evolved', 'battle-ax', 'Yawn', '.Come', ""n't"", '1950', 'get', 'was', 'wronged', 'locals', 'who', 'believed', 'was', 'witch', 'little', 'girl', 'were', 'subjected', 'trial', 'water', 'indicium', 'aquae', 'theory', 'water', 'was', 'supposed', 'reject', 'unholy', 'including', 'witches', 'vampires', 'Therefore', 'accused', 'floats', 'was', 'proof', 'guilt', 'water', 'was', 'thought', 'have', 'spit', 'out', 'accused', 'sank', 'was', 'proof', 'innocence', 'water', 'was', 'said', 'swallow', 'up', 'way', 'poor', 'soul', 'drowned', '.By', 'strange', 'miracle', 'Dagmar', 'become', 'ultimate', 'warrior', 'woman/bada**/shrew', 'Evil', 'Xena', 'MOVE', 'OVER', 'Dagmar', 'pregnant', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'helplessly', 'little', 'girl', 'drowned', 'also', 'miscarries', 'result', 'injustices', 'villager', 'nightmare', 'reason', 'rage', 'Signe', 'whom', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Pop', 'psychology', 'notwithstanding', 'disappointing', 'see', 'same', 'old', 'stereotypes', 'taken', 'mothballs', 'use', 'movie', 'Escape', 'Dagmar', 'who', 'water', 'test', 'acquire', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'skills', 'angst', 'FEMALE', 'adversary', 'Signe', 'Signe', 'Dagmar', 'polar', 'opposite', 'virginal', 'woman-child', 'who', 'hero', 'save', 'Frigg', 'little', 'girl', 'Dagmar', 'kidnapped', 'replace', 'own', 'child', 'children', 'lost', 'hands', 'villagers', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'course', 'MEN.Dagmar', 'mentally', 'unhinged', 'crossbow', 'kill', 'male', 'companion', 'who', 'only', 'trying', 'protect', 'little', 'Frigg.The', 'Dagmar', 'character', 'was', 'awful', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Dagmar', 'loving', 'mother', 'dangerous', 'psychopath', 'result', 'injustice', 'inflicted', 'villagers', 'Human', 'beings', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'simple', 'Next', 'Signe', 'child', 'uncertain', 'how', 'will', 'survive', 'having', 'battle', 'skills', 'sufficient', 'wipe', 'out', 'Dagmar', 'whole', 'gang', 'defeat', 'Dagmar', 'thanks', '5', 'minute', 'lesson', 'bear', 'hunting', 'struggle', 'Dagmar', 'mistakes', 'skilled', 'warrior', 'ever', 'would', '.Probably', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'Signe', 'fall', 'down', 'side', 'cliff', 'easily', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'least', '80', 'foot', 'drop', 'chance', 'surviving', 'fall', 'WITH', 'life', 'threatening', 'injury', 'very', 'slim', 'Survival', 'unscathed', 'nearly', 'unheard', 'very', 'least', 'Signe', 'internal', 'injuries', 'would', 'be', 'severe', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'away', 'such', 'fall', 'closed', 'head', 'injury', 'up', 'up', 'shakes', 'off', 'Sorry', 'be', 'so', 'picky', 'Bad', 'bad', 'bad', 'see', 'http', '//www.sciforums.com/showthread.php', '53810-Lethal-jump-heightOn', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'who', 'Dagmar', 'quite', 'stunning', 'eye', 'candy', 'enough', 'sustain', 'attention', 'Escape', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'writing', 'plot', 'are', ""n't"", 'offended', 'sexist', 'cliches', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'require', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'protagonists', 'make', 'sense', 'skip', 'one']",Escape
