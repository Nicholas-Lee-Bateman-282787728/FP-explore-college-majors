It may not be a feel good film but it does have unique qualities.I enjoyed it, but it was rather bleak. The film did a great job of communicating that hopeless feeling in life rather well, as well as the disconnect that can come between friends. The scene where he finds the pocket-watch but does not tell Yusuf was perhaps my favorite part. The part where he wanted to, but could not bring himself to, approach a woman was also very good. Especially the part on the train where the woman's leg is close to his. This basically sums up what it is like to be a man. We can be, without a woman, very lonely creatures. God bless women. Amen.Thanks for showing me this poignant film. I will re-visit it again for sure.

878356,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0007939R0,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 1]","Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town- Kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. That Clouds Of May succeeded on any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks Bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). The bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite Bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue. The natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from Manhattan, save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs.... Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. As he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this film. He pulls back behind a column, and Nazan merely turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film, and that Ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. Distant does, albeit it at just the right length.",4,Excellent,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2983,"['Nuri', 'Bilge', 'Ceylan', '2002', 'film', 'Distant', 'Uzak', 'third', 'feature', 'film', 'first', 'was', '1997', 'black', 'white', 'Small', 'Town-', 'Kasaba', 'significant', 'step', 'up', 'good', 'flawed', '1999', 'film', 'Clouds', 'May', 'Mayis', 'Sikintisi', 'earlier', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'reeked', 'small', 'budget', 'improvised', 'quality', 'worst', 'ways-', 'plot', 'holes', 'wooden', 'acting', 'amateurs', 'Clouds', 'May', 'succeeded', 'level', 'was', 'testament', 'Ceylan', 'talent', 'budding', 'filmmaker', 'However', 'Distant', 'Ceylan', 'arrival', 'international', 'scene', 'great', 'artist', 'one', 'who', 'many', 'same', 'qualities', 'other', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'screenplay', 'not', 'dialogue-heavy', 'just', 'brooding', 'Bergman', 'penchant', 'close-ups-', 'shots', 'are', 'usually', 'long', 'shots', 'exteriors', 'medium', 'shots', 'interiors', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'penetrating', 'scenes', 'contemplation', 'Ceylan', 'bulk', 'film', 'place', 'snowy', 'hibernal', 'Istanbul', 'fact', 'Turkey', 'will', 'likely', 'surprise', 'film', 'definite', 'Bergmanian', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'reminding', 'one', 'bleak', 'snowy', 'urban', 'images', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Decalogue', 'natural', 'images', 'invoke', 'best', 'Werner', 'Herzog-', 'tend', 'go', 'beat', 'two', 'longer', 'standard', 'film', 'theory', 'would', 'dictate-', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'urban', 'landscapes', 'range', 'nearly', 'Precisionist', 'compositions', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'cultural', 'hagiography', 'Woody', 'Allen-', 'one', 'shot', 'bench', 'overlooking', 'water', 'direct', 'quotation', 'read', 'steal', 'Manhattan', 'save', 'lack', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'background', 'scene', 'Ceylan', 'similarly', 'famous', 'shot', 'ship', 'harbor', 'Ozu', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'great', 'artists', 'Ceylan', 'appropriations', 'own', 'art', 'slightly', 'altering', 'keeping', 'apropos', 'own', 'film', 'needs', 'Distant', 'film', 'title', 'characterization', 'film', 'feeling', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'not', 'describe', 'film', 'scenes', 'stay', 'one', 'long', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'image', 'film', 'when', 'Mahmut', 'stalks', 'ex-wife', 'Istanbul', 'airport', 'new', 'husband', 'head', 'board', 'plane', 'will', 'remove', 'life', 'forever', 'distance', 'see', 'catch', 'just', 'glance', 'watching', 'Will', 'leave', 'husband', 'return', 'Mahmut', 'Not', 'film', 'back', 'column', 'Nazan', 'merely', 'head', 'back', 'future', 'Mahmut', 'past', 'how', 'best', 'move', 'on-', 'just', 'keep', 'moving', 'Mahmut', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'Most', 'rarely', 'get', 'such', 'moments', 'insight', 'life', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'film', 'Ceylan', 'own', 'powers', 'creation', 'ignorance', 'can', 'teach', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'Distant', 'albeit', 'just', 'right', 'length']",N/A

And speaking for myself, late at night I just want to wind down, rather than be overstimulated. No need to worry about rude awakenings from loud gunfire and the like here. Instead what we have is a middle-aged divorced photographer (Mahmut) in Istanbul who reluctantly takes in a distant relative (Yusef) who is seeking employment. Yusef appears to be basically good-natured, but his isolation in a strange city, sharing an apartment with a sullen man, prevents him from taking much initiative in human interaction.`And since Mahmut is not exactly Mr. Personality, the  ""plot"" goes nowhere.

878359,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0007939R0,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 13]","The director of DISTANT reportedly used his own apartment as the primary set, his own belongings, e.g. his personal car, as props, and a friend and a cousin as the two principal characters. Such dedication to the creative impulse deserves more than I can bestow.Here, a divorced professional photographer, Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir) lives a reclusive life in an Istanbul suburb, his only contact with the rest of the species being an occasional tryst with a prostitute. One day, his cousin from the country, Yusuf (Emin Toprak), arrives in the Big City. Yusuf's father has recently been laid off from his job, and Yusuf is hoping to land a berth on one of the merchant ships that docks in Istanbul to help pay for his ailing mother's health care. Thinking that his relative will soon be set up on his own, Mahmut invites the young man to stay with him. But, as the latter's hopes for employment shrivel in a dried-up job market and his habitation with Mahmut is extended, the tension between the two increases due to Mahmut's smoldering resentment at the intrusion on his space.Had DISTANT been written as a comedy, such as the American film THE ODD COUPLE, or had it been made edgier with a violent end, it would've been worth the viewing time. Rather, it's a slow-moving, unengaging exercise that peters out to an unremarkable conclusion.The only surprise in this film for me was the revelation that Istanbul, at sea level in a temperate clime, experiences snow in the winter.

878360,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0007939R0,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[25, 26]","In an interview included on this DVD, Distant's director, Nuri Ceylan, talks about making the film and about his perspective on filmmaking, including his influences (largely Chekovian).  He speaks in excellent English which is a measure of his keen intelligence and versatility. Also included on the disk is Ceylan's brilliant short wordless black and white film Koza (Cocoon) which is almost in itself worth the price of the DVD.Distant's leads are two men--a recently divorced photographer, Mahmut, who's a city dweller (Istanbul) and his distant relative Yusuf who's from the country. Each man has a reason to feel dissociated from society. Mahmut's recent divorce has left him emotionally isolated, hollow--he meets with his ex-wife and the viewer can see the regret of his splitting up with her all over his face without him having to say anything explicitly. He spends an inordinate amount of time watching TV or movies on TV, including porn, but often does this late at night, using the glare of the screen as a mesmerizing soporific.Yusuf has lost his factory job and has come to Istanbul hoping for a better life. Instead what he finds is an economy as bad as where he came from. Unable to find work, he spends his daylight hours semi-stalking women, but never initiating any contact. He's withdrawn, afraid, isolated.The subtle intercutting of the lives of the two men is skillfully handled and when they are together--Mahmut has agreed to put up Yusuf in his home--it's not hard to tell that what Mahmut really resents more than anything else is another person who does nothing at all to assuage his own isolation but instead, by his mere presence alone, reinforces it.Ceylan is so skilled at this subtle portrayal that it might be easy to feel bored with some of the film, particularly the stretches when Mahmut watches TV. But because there is a palpable undercurrent of unease directly related to the aloneness both men experience, the film silently and slowly grows in momentum, building up this feeling until at the end we understand these characters more than we thought we would at the beginning--or even the middle of the film.Winner of several prizes at international film festivals, including Cannes, Distant cannot be said to be ""gripping"", but is without question the work of a truly talented filmmaker who is more than aware of the emotional nuances of human behavior.Highly recommended.",4,Subtle and resonant,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,2411,"['interview', 'included', 'DVD', 'Distant', 'director', 'Nuri', 'Ceylan', 'making', 'film', 'perspective', 'filmmaking', 'including', 'influences', 'largely', 'Chekovian', 'excellent', 'English', 'measure', 'keen', 'intelligence', 'versatility', 'Also', 'included', 'disk', 'Ceylan', 'brilliant', 'short', 'wordless', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Koza', 'Cocoon', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD.Distant', 'leads', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'recently', 'divorced', 'photographer', 'Mahmut', 'who', 'city', 'dweller', 'Istanbul', 'distant', 'relative', 'Yusuf', 'who', 'country', 'man', 'reason', 'feel', 'dissociated', 'society', 'Mahmut', 'recent', 'divorce', 'left', 'emotionally', 'isolated', 'hollow', 'ex-wife', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'regret', 'splitting', 'up', 'face', 'having', 'say', 'anything', 'explicitly', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'watching', 'TV', 'movies', 'TV', 'including', 'porn', 'often', 'late', 'night', 'using', 'glare', 'screen', 'mesmerizing', 'soporific.Yusuf', 'lost', 'factory', 'job', 'come', 'Istanbul', 'hoping', 'better', 'life', 'Instead', 'what', 'economy', 'as', 'bad', 'where', 'came', 'Unable', 'find', 'work', 'daylight', 'hours', 'semi-stalking', 'women', 'never', 'initiating', 'contact', 'withdrawn', 'afraid', 'isolated.The', 'subtle', 'intercutting', 'lives', 'two', 'men', 'skillfully', 'handled', 'when', 'are', 'together', 'Mahmut', 'agreed', 'put', 'up', 'Yusuf', 'home', 'not', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'Mahmut', 'really', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'person', 'who', 'nothing', 'assuage', 'own', 'isolation', 'instead', 'mere', 'presence', 'alone', 'reinforces', 'it.Ceylan', 'so', 'skilled', 'subtle', 'portrayal', 'might', 'be', 'easy', 'feel', 'bored', 'film', 'particularly', 'stretches', 'when', 'Mahmut', 'TV', 'palpable', 'undercurrent', 'unease', 'directly', 'related', 'aloneness', 'men', 'experience', 'film', 'silently', 'slowly', 'grows', 'momentum', 'building', 'up', 'feeling', 'end', 'understand', 'characters', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'beginning', 'even', 'middle', 'film.Winner', 'several', 'prizes', 'international', 'film', 'festivals', 'including', 'Cannes', 'Distant', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'gripping', 'question', 'work', 'truly', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'more', 'aware', 'emotional', 'nuances', 'human', 'behavior.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
878361,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0007939R0,Lleu Christopher,"[4, 8]","This is a very slow-paced look at lives of quiet desperation in modern Istanbul. I have to admit being a little disappointed after reading how many awards this Turkish film, written and directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, won. It is, to be sure, well-acted and photographed, but I'm afraid there was not enough going on to keep me interested for most of it. Photographer Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir) leads a rather dull, routine existence, and has not recovered from his divorce. When his younger cousin Yusef (Mehmet Emin Toprak) arrives in town without a job or place to stay, Mahmut's predictable existence is threatened. Mahmut feels obligated to let Yusef stay in his apartment, but he is clearly not overjoyed at the prospect. At first the two are cordial, if not friendly to one another, but Yusef soon gets on Mahmut's nerves. All of this is portrayed in a series of low-key, often dialogue-free scenes. Most of what we know about Mahmut's state of mind comes not from anything he says or does, but by his melancholy expression and the overall aura of anomie he exudes. Yusef, in turn, soon feels isolated in the big city, where he is unable to find a job. He takes to following around women, who seem oblivious to his existence.The above pretty much summarizes the movie. There are a couple of arguments between the two roommates, but in general everything is understated and implied. Distant is moody and atmospheric, and captures something authentic about the loneliness of some single people in large cities. Unfortunately, the melancholy mood and slow pace of the film makes it not very accessible or entertaining. Neither of the characters are particularly likable or unlikable; we only know them from their mostly silent and resentful interaction with one another. The city itself is made to appear dull, gray and unappealing (the film takes place during a snowy winter). We can deduce from a few scenes that Istanbul is a populated and lively city, but we are forced to look at it through the eyes of these discontented men.

878363,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007939R0,Roland E. Zwick,"[20, 25]","More mood piece than actual drama, the appropriately titled ""Distant"" is an emotionally detached Turkish film that brings new meaning to the term ""minimalist storytelling.""  What little story it does tell involves an unemployed man from the provinces who comes to Istanbul in search of a job.  While there, he stays with his cousin, a divorced professional photographer, who prefers to lead a life of drab solitude rather than interrelate with his fellow man.  Naturally, having this rube from the country suddenly show up on his doorstep does not sit well with the life and style of this virtual hermit.Since this is, essentially, a film about a lack of communication, it is understandable that very little of the screen time is devoted to characters interacting with one another.  Instead, long stretches of the movie are taken up in showing us characters wandering through the stark snow-covered landscapes of wintry Istanbul or sitting in dreary rooms either alone or with other people who are equally cut off from those around them.  ""Distant"" has much of the feel of an Antonioni film, in that the beautifully composed and photographed background comes to predominate over the people in the foreground, a visual correlative to mankind's ennui, alienation and angst.  As a director, Nuri Bilge Ceylon (who also wrote the film) uses the camera almost as an artist does his canvas, painting icily beautiful pictures of the world around him.  Ceylan's unhurried, deliberate pacing becomes strangely hypnotic as he dwells on one extraordinary image after another.  Most of the film is spent concentrating on the mundane, day-to-day activities of these two passive, largely nonverbal individuals.  The film may drive some people mad with its lack of drama and action, but those able to appreciate its almost Zen-like rhythm and mood will find the movie intriguing.  There's an extraordinarily surreal shot of a docked tanker listing precariously towards port that is alone worth the price of admission (or rental fee).For some, ""Distant"" may be little more than an art film with a capital ""A,""  but those with the patience to go beyond the obvious will relish its uniqueness.",3,patience-demanding art film,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2175,"['More', 'mood', 'piece', 'actual', 'drama', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Distant', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'Turkish', 'film', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'minimalist', 'storytelling', 'What', 'little', 'story', 'tell', 'unemployed', 'man', 'provinces', 'who', 'Istanbul', 'search', 'job', 'there', 'cousin', 'divorced', 'professional', 'photographer', 'who', 'lead', 'life', 'drab', 'solitude', 'rather', 'interrelate', 'fellow', 'man', 'Naturally', 'having', 'rube', 'country', 'suddenly', 'show', 'up', 'doorstep', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'life', 'style', 'virtual', 'hermit.Since', 'essentially', 'film', 'lack', 'communication', 'understandable', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'characters', 'interacting', 'one', 'Instead', 'long', 'stretches', 'movie', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'showing', 'characters', 'wandering', 'stark', 'snow-covered', 'landscapes', 'wintry', 'Istanbul', 'sitting', 'dreary', 'rooms', 'alone', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'equally', 'cut', 'off', 'Distant', 'much', 'feel', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'photographed', 'background', 'predominate', 'people', 'foreground', 'visual', 'correlative', 'mankind', 'ennui', 'alienation', 'angst', 'director', 'Nuri', 'Bilge', 'Ceylon', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'film', 'camera', 'almost', 'artist', 'canvas', 'painting', 'icily', 'beautiful', 'pictures', 'world', 'Ceylan', 'unhurried', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'strangely', 'hypnotic', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'image', 'Most', 'film', 'spent', 'concentrating', 'mundane', 'day-to-day', 'activities', 'two', 'passive', 'largely', 'nonverbal', 'individuals', 'film', 'may', 'drive', 'people', 'mad', 'lack', 'drama', 'action', 'able', 'appreciate', 'almost', 'Zen-like', 'rhythm', 'mood', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'extraordinarily', 'surreal', 'shot', 'docked', 'tanker', 'listing', 'precariously', 'towards', 'port', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'rental', 'fee', 'Distant', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'art', 'film', 'capital', 'patience', 'go', 'obvious', 'will', 'relish', 'uniqueness']",N/A
878364,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0007939R0,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[1, 1]","This languid, elliptical film set in Istanbul is a fascinating study of urban isolation, as a divorced, middle-age photographer reluctantly takes in a younger man from the country, who is looking for work. Not so much an odd couple, because they are two of a kind, they manage to grate on each other, a fact that comes across mostly in long silences until there is a final outburst between them. Sympathetic first with the older man, when his temporary house guest does little to take responsibility for himself, we unexpectedly shift our allegiance to the other man when a silver pocket watch disappears.Working with a small crew and more than a little under the influence of Chekhov, the writer-director walks the fine line between comedy and melodrama, letting the simple premise of the film unfold slowly, relishing its many moments without hurrying toward a resolution of the building conflict. Time passes, and no one changes. Meanwhile the cinematography (both interiors and exteriors) is striking, particularly as one sequence plays out in a day of heavy snowfall. The DVD includes a cinema-verite-style making-of featurette and a lengthy and illuminating interview the director.",4,"City mouse, country mouse . . .",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,1187,"['languid', 'elliptical', 'film', 'set', 'Istanbul', 'fascinating', 'study', 'urban', 'isolation', 'divorced', 'middle-age', 'photographer', 'reluctantly', 'younger', 'man', 'country', 'who', 'looking', 'work', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'odd', 'couple', 'are', 'two', 'kind', 'manage', 'grate', 'other', 'fact', 'across', 'mostly', 'long', 'silences', 'final', 'outburst', 'Sympathetic', 'first', 'older', 'man', 'when', 'temporary', 'house', 'guest', 'little', 'take', 'responsibility', 'unexpectedly', 'shift', 'allegiance', 'other', 'man', 'when', 'silver', 'pocket', 'watch', 'disappears.Working', 'small', 'crew', 'more', 'little', 'influence', 'Chekhov', 'writer-director', 'fine', 'line', 'comedy', 'melodrama', 'letting', 'simple', 'premise', 'film', 'unfold', 'slowly', 'relishing', 'many', 'moments', 'hurrying', 'resolution', 'building', 'conflict', 'Time', 'one', 'Meanwhile', 'cinematography', 'interiors', 'exteriors', 'striking', 'particularly', 'one', 'sequence', 'out', 'day', 'heavy', 'snowfall', 'DVD', 'cinema-verite-style', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'lengthy', 'illuminating', 'interview', 'director']",N/A
878365,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B0007939R0,Suzanne,"[10, 10]","You will find fewer more appropriately titled films than ""Distant"". Opening with a snow-covered landscape with a city in the background, we witness through a stationary camera a small figure walking towards us. The figure is dwarfed by the rest of the mis-en-scene, and this distance seems to directly reflect the title itself. For those who find the opening shot (which takes minutes to unfold) too laborious to sit through, I recommend not even trying with the rest of the film. Containing very little dialogue and no cause-and-effect plot, Distant is a simple portrait of the titular distance between individuals and society, individuals and others, brothers, and, ultimately oneself. As Amazon and others have done a good job at offering a plot synopsis, I'll skip that.Distant unfolds less like a fictional narrative and more like life captured through a camera. I would call Ceylan's style ""neo-realist voyeurism"". Ceylan seems to subscribe to the theory of making films as true to life as possible, and even at its most beautiful, the director's influence of the affairs is rarely felt. True to this style, the film moves at life's pace. By ""life's pace"" I mean there are no quick edits allowing viewers to jump to the most relevant bits. Ceylan often stays focused on seemingly inconsequential scenes for a while. These long stretches of quiet are underscored with a ""palpable current of unease"" as one reviewer sharply noted. In the case of Mahmut watching TV, the length allows the viewer to pause and realize some inherent irony and absurdity in watching someone watching - or in living vicariously through someone doing the same. Others, such as Yusuf standing silently in a hall with an attractive young woman (one much like those whom he follows around the streets of Istanbul) highlights the theme of the difficulty in making first contact.""Stark beauty"" is a phrase you would hear used to describe this film, and I'm hard pressed to find a better one. Scenes of these characters wandering around Istanbul in winter are surprisingly gorgeous. But this isn't empty prettiness, as the actions of the characters in these scenes, and even the cold itself seems to reflect the central themes superbly. Beyond these chilling winter wonderland visions are others that are more of the surrealistic vein. The overturned tanker in the harbor has been mentioned. This shot is so shocking that one will be initially confused as to exactly what you're looking at. In a film about the normal and every day, this capturing of the completely abnormal and fantastic is a visceral punch. Another favorite scene is Mahmut's dream. This highlights a quality of this minimalistic style; despite that almost nothing happens (save for one small exception) Ceylan is able to extract from this a reaction due to how abstract it is from the normalcy around it.Distant also contains some rather funny moments that closely resembles elements of our own lives. Not the least of which is the running motif of trying to catch a mouse with sticky paper - which includes a wonderful piece of dialogue regarding one particular failure. Distant is slightly deceptive as it almost makes you believe this will be a comedy. These hopes are dashed as it ends on a note of devastatingly quiet, solitary contemplation. The final scene was thoroughly moving in its subtle, emotive power, and is perhaps the only scene where Ceylon's influence as an artist can be felt. When juxtaposed next to the opening scene, I think the two make a very poignant artistic statement. Distant isn't just a film of mere moments, however. The whole it creates is a nuanced and fully realized slice-of-life portrait of two troubled souls in Istanbul: One man trying to find meaning and direction in his life after a crippling divorce, one man trying to start a life with little talent and less ambition, and the relationship of these two brothers during all this. These relationships and themes are universal enough to allow everyone to connect in some way. As one reviewer said, Ceylan has an uncanny grasp on the nuances of people and relationships, and there are countless examples of terrific, wordless character and relationship development within Distant that might not register initially with the viewer.Distant is a film that likely won't hit you immediately - as it is as nuanced and subtle a film as you'll ever see. But I do agree with Roger Ebert who asked ""How is it that the same movie can seem tedious on first viewing and absorbing on the second?"" One answer is that during your first viewing you will patiently wait for something (an event) to happen. Once you realize that nothing will, you are free to go back and let yourself be absorbed in the lives of these characters and the beautiful mosaic Ceylan paints. Long after my initial viewing I find that scenes and moments from Distant replay in my mind less like those from a film, and more vividly like those from memory. And I think that speaks volumes of the enduring power of many ""boring art films"" such as this.",4,Poignancy in Retrospect,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,5041,"['will', 'find', 'fewer', 'more',

On the side of who is better, it would be Mahmut since he is a bit more experienced in his life and disciplined than the very quiet and careless Yusuf who would rather spy on women or smoke cheap cigarettes. It is the individual scenes (like the scenes with Mahmut drinking and acting like he is depressed) set on stone that are more compelling than the whole and a film that reminded me a lot of Uzak was Le Havre, a Finnish-French film by Aki Kaurismaki about a man holding an immigrant child but Le Havre was slightly (not a lot though) more driven and humorous than this one here.While this is far too ambiguous to give a recommendation, it is commendable enough to be almost a Godard-esque British Film Institute film study where mood, character, and set design is everything and probably more important than the rather basic narrative.""",3,Understated and oddly funny drama is fascinating and visually rich but a bit boring and too vague.,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1696,"['thought', 'art', 'films', 'Europe/Asia', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'bore', 'might', 'think', 'small-scale', 'drama', 'loneliness', 'lack', 'forgiveness', 'fear', 'family', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'could', 'endure', 'However', 'even', 'vague', 'boring', 'several', 'places', 'not', 'seem', 'disappoint', 'famed', 'Turkish', 'director', 'Nuri', 'Bilge', 'Ceylan', 'convincing', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'named', 'Yusuf', 'Mahmut', 'trying', 'bring', 'about', 'lives', 'something', 'more', 'convincing', 'many', 'places', 'cold', 'uncertain', 'lovely', 'watch', 'busier', 'rural', 'parts', 'Turkey', 'certainly', 'better', 'snow', 'absurdly', 'hilarious', 'most', 'off-the-wall', 'way', 'Mahmut', 'smut', 'then', 'skips', 'once', 'Yusuf', 'dialogue', 'reaction', 'mild-mannered.Nothing', 'exaggerated', 'here', 'sound', 'wind', 'blowing', 'air', 'toy', 'soldier', 'floor', 'side', 'who', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'Mahmut', 'bit', 'more', 'experienced', 'life', 'disciplined', 'very', 'quiet', 'careless', 'Yusuf', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'spy', 'women', 'smoke', 'cheap', 'cigarettes', 'individual', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'Mahmut', 'drinking', 'acting', 'depressed', 'set', 'stone', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'whole', 'film', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Uzak', 'was', 'Le', 'Havre', 'Finnish-French', 'film', 'Aki', 'Kaurismaki', 'man', 'holding', 'immigrant', 'child', 'Le', 'Havre', 'was', 'slightly', 'not', 'lot', 'more', 'driven', 'humorous', 'one', 'here.While', 'far', 'too', 'ambiguous', 'give', 'recommendation', 'commendable', 'enough', 'be', 'almost', 'Godard-esque', 'British', 'Film', 'Institute', 'film', 'study', 'where', 'mood', 'character', 'set', 'design', 'everything', 'probably', 'more', 'important', 'rather', 'basic', 'narrative']",N/A
