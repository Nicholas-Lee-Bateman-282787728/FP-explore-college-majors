Only thru reading someone's top 10 movie's for forgotten Movies did I see this title and then ordered this movie. I loved this movie so much that I gave the vhs to a former gang member from Los Angeles (He loved it, and he is passing that around) and I ordered the dvd. I love the director and the real Sonny Carson doing commentary. They tell a grim tell of what the whole filming experience was like. They give you stories of Joe Dancer and the rest that only the directors commentary would provide. Anybody from Chicago over 40,Los Angeles over 40, New York will understand this experience. This is one of my new favorite movies to watch. I love the whole movie from beggining to end. I am 43 years old and see how hip hop, rap, gangsta behavior orginated from this classic. Movies have away of influencing the times. The Education of Sonny Carson has a way of influencing culture.

The setting and main character was very good as well. This is what you called back in the day a Sign of the  Times. The message is in the main character Sonny Carson and what a message it turned out to be. I understand it made a big impression on some of our Rap Stars today.

705390,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B000068TP8,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[12, 14]","This movie was probably the first of its type.  Many ""life as a gang member"" films came to follow it (especially in the 1980s and 1990s), but none really did so like this one... Most the ones that followed had a tendency to be too ""Hollywood Melodramatic""-ish (at times cartoonish, and at other times somewhat preachy.)  Without spoiling the ending, though Sonny Carson makes an important decision at the end of the film, the ending is anything but happy... in fact it is often critisized for its apparent ""inconclusion"", but I disagree... It is what makes the film so great.  Almost like a documentary (""120 Blocks from Tiffany's"") the film simply tells the story and leaves the big question to be asked and answered by the viewer. Sonny has ""graduated"" from his training by society and the system... the ""happy"" days of his violent education are over... but what next ?  What is in his future ?  Isn't everyone promised the American dream???  Sonny walks the straight path, but the odds still seem stacked against him.  It would seem to me that if the film has been understood the viewer should leave it not demanding to know what happened to SONNY himself, but rather wondering about the plight of all the other SONNYs in the world... what society did to create the situation and what society or the communities are failing to do to resolve it ?  Then we must debate whether Sonny's future is really in his own hands and if he does have a fair chance to make a life for himself.  This, I assume was might have been the director's intention.Though fans of 70s urban action type films will love the music and on-scene locations (and notice a few actors... for example the cop from the MAC and the gang leader from THE WARRIORS) beware, this is not just another 70's urban action thriller... it is an urban coming of Age Story, starting from Sonny's graduation from Jr. HS to his ""education"" (via the streets, the system) and ultimately jail, and his sad graduation into a lonely and questionable adulthood.

What I found was this movie and what I learned about the Education of Sonny Carson it was a school of hard knocks. I really enjoed this movie my friends did to. Its was interesting to see how the gangs were almost revered as like heros. During the parade they were just walking and chanting banners and all with a huge following. It's a real movie. It shows the brief celebrity status they received when living that lifestyle and when reality catches up the harsh realization that the glory days are over.
