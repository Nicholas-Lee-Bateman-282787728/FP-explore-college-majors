Its only connection to the original are the parents and the golden retriever they own.  My wife and I both fell asleep during our first two attempts to watch the film.  The story is a best choppy and doesn't flow very well.  The puppies are cute and the little girl who plays Lisa's niece does an admirable job in a dull movie.  I am being generous by giving this film two stars.  I cannot recommend the purchase of this DVD.  I really wanted to like this film as much as I did the original, but now I'm sorry I bought it.

1460421,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B005GP7EYE,Elyse Wheeler,"[0, 0]","I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Golden Christmas 2: The Second Tail was really quite clean.  I think there were a few swear words (mostly by a 11 or 12 year old girl, which was completely unnecessary to have a child do), several low cut shirts/dresses and a few scenes of people drinking.  I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again and like it a lot better than the first one. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.Rod and Katherine, the parents in the first movie, move to Florida with their dog Jake.  But Rod is bored with nothing to do, and Katherine misses her kids back home, especially with Christmas right around the corner. However, Rod has made friends with a boy named David who plays basketball with him and Katherine has made friends with her new neighbor, Lisa, who has three puppies herself: Mario, Luigi and Pasquale. When Jake and the puppies take off during a walk with Lisa, they interrupt a wedding proposal.  Lisa is mortified to find out that the man that Jake just jumped on is David (her childhood friend / ex-boyfriend.  Everyone can see that David and Lisa are meant to be together, except David and Lisa. Jake does his best to throw them together as often as he can, but with David's wedding approaching, now that he has met Lisa again, they both are wondering if they are better off apart or together, and to give their love a second chance.Overall, I loved the movie and will watch it again.",5,Golden Christmas 2: The Second Tail,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1655,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Golden', 'Christmas', '2', 'Second', 'Tail', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'think', 'were', 'few', 'swear', 'words', 'mostly', '11', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'have', 'child', 'do', 'several', 'low', 'cut', 'shirts/dresses', 'few', 'scenes', 'people', 'drinking', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'lot', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', '.Rod', 'Katherine', 'parents', 'first', 'movie', 'move', 'Florida', 'dog', 'Jake', 'Rod', 'bored', 'nothing', 'do', 'Katherine', 'kids', 'back', 'home', 'especially', 'Christmas', 'right', 'corner', 'However', 'Rod', 'made', 'friends', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'who', 'basketball', 'Katherine', 'made', 'friends', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Lisa', 'who', 'three', 'puppies', 'Mario', 'Luigi', 'Pasquale', 'When', 'Jake', 'puppies', 'take', 'off', 'walk', 'Lisa', 'interrupt', 'wedding', 'proposal', 'Lisa', 'mortified', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'Jake', 'just', 'jumped', 'David', 'childhood', 'friend', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Everyone', 'can', 'see', 'David', 'Lisa', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'David', 'Lisa', 'Jake', 'best', 'throw', 'together', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'David', 'wedding', 'approaching', 'now', 'met', 'Lisa', 'again', 'are', 'wondering', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'apart', 'together', 'give', 'love', 'second', 'chance.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",A Golden Christmas 2: The Second Tail
1460422,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B005GP7EYE,J. Olsen,"[18, 19]","This sequel to ""A Golden Christmas"" follows the parents, Rod and Katherine, who were preparing to move to Florida in that movie. Well played by the actors from the original (thank goodness--they were the best actors in that one) this story introduces us to their new neighbor Lisa, her ex-boyfriend David, and his new girlfriend, along with the neighbor's niece and her friend. You know from the first few minutes where this story is going to go, so don't expect any dramatic twists in the plot. But to me the chemistry between Lisa and David is so much more believable than it was in the original movie's love interests. The dogs are a little more involved in the action, too, but it still isn't the kid's movie the cover photo may lead you to believe it is. Ron and Katharine befriend their neighbor who would otherwise be spending Christmas alone, and they quickly see she isn't over her ex. They do all they can to facilitate a reconciliation, but their dog seems to have more influential, if not subtle, methods. However there is a complication--David just got engaged to someone else.There is humor, romance, some drama and even a subtle nod to Santa in the form of David's rotund landlord with a jolly laugh. But don't expect any snowy sleigh rides or winter wonderlands. This is set in a beach town somewhere in Florida.I did notice that there is repeated casual use of the Lord's name and several common swear words popping up in conversations. That was disappointing.You don't have to have seen the first movie to make sense of this one. I personally felt the acting in this one overall was a notch up from the first movie. The fiancee is played with a bit of caricature, but just enough to be funny without being over the top. I think it would be a pleasant escape, if you aren't bothered by the swearing. I would like to have been able to give each movie 3 1/2 stars instead of 4. This one would be because of the language and the other movie would get the half star lower due to what I felt was the lack of chemistry between the leads.ETA: Another reviewer mentions the portrayal of a ""sexual encounter in bed"" that is interrupted and causes the man involved to swear. This puzzled me and I had to scan through the movie and see if I had really missed such a scene. I think I found it. Rod is sitting on their bed because he has just injured his knee in a game of basketball with David. He is fully dressed and his knee is in a brace. Katherine brings a bag of ice to put on it. She sits beside him on the edge of the bed and they talk about many things, including the fact that the doctor told Rod he is never to play basketball again. Katherine says he will have to get his exercise in other ways. She reaches over and turns out the bedside lamp as she begins kissing him. They start to lay across the bed and Rod does swear because his knee hurts and they sit back up.",4,Better Chemistry than the first,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2884,"['sequel', 'A', 'Golden', 'Christmas', 'parents', 'Rod', 'Katherine', 'who', 'were', 'preparing', 'move', 'Florida', 'movie', 'Well', 'played', 'actors', 'original', 'thank', 'goodness', 'were', 'best', 'actors', 'one', 'story', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Lisa', 'ex-boyfriend', 'David', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'neighbor', 'niece', 'friend', 'know', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'go', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'plot', 'chemistry', 'Lisa', 'David', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'was', 'original', 'movie', 'love', 'interests', 'dogs', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'involved', 'action', 'too', 'still', ""n't"", 'kid', 'movie', 'cover', 'photo', 'may', 'lead', 'believe', 'Ron', 'Katharine', 'befriend', 'neighbor', 'who', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'spending', 'Christmas', 'alone', 'quickly', 'see', ""n't"", 'ex', 'do', 'can', 'facilitate', 'reconciliation', 'dog', 'have', 'more', 'influential', 'not', 'subtle', 'methods', 'However', 'complication', 'David', 'just', 'got', 'engaged', 'someone', 'else.There', 'humor', 'romance', 'drama', 'even', 'subtle', 'nod', 'Santa', 'form', 'David', 'rotund', 'landlord', 'jolly', 'laugh', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'snowy', 'sleigh', 'rides', 'winter', 'wonderlands', 'set', 'beach', 'town', 'somewhere', 'Florida.I', 'did', 'notice', 'repeated', 'casual', 'use', 'Lord', 'name', 'several', 'common', 'swear', 'words', 'popping', 'up', 'conversations', 'was', 'disappointing.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'personally', 'felt', 'acting', 'one', 'overall', 'was', 'notch', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'fiancee', 'played', 'bit', 'caricature', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'funny', 'being', 'top', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'pleasant', 'escape', 'are', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'swearing', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'give', 'movie', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'instead', '4', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'language', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'half', 'star', 'lower', 'due', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'leads.ETA', 'reviewer', 'portrayal', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'bed', 'interrupted', 'man', 'involved', 'swear', 'puzzled', 'had', 'scan', 'movie', 'see', 'had', 'really', 'missed', 'scene', 'think', 'found', 'Rod', 'sitting', 'bed', 'just', 'injured', 'knee', 'game', 'basketball', 'David', 'fully', 'dressed', 'knee', 'brace', 'Katherine', 'bag', 'ice', 'put', 'beside', 'edge', 'bed', 'talk', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'fact', 'doctor', 'told', 'Rod', 'never', 'play', 'basketball', 'again', 'Katherine', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'exercise', 'other', 'ways', 'out', 'bedside', 'lamp', 'kissing', 'start', 'lay', 'bed', 'Rod', 'swear', 'knee', 'hurts', 'sit', 'back', 'up']",A Golden Christmas 2: The Second Tail
