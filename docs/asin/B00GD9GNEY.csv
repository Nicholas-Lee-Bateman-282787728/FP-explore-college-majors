1677850,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00GD9GNEY,Ace-of-Stars,"[1, 1]","One of the common complaints I'm coming across regarding this new &#34;Justice League&#34; DCAU production (other than the replacement of &#34;Aquaman&#34; with &#34;Captain Marvel&#34; who is now &#34;officially&#34; called &#34;SHAZAM&#34; -- but if you watch through the end credits you'll get your answer to why this animated feature chose not to carryover DC's resident &#34;pet fish&#34; this time around) has to do with the &#34;unherolike&#34; behavior of our beloved &#34;SuperFriends&#34; -- they're rude, they're obnoxious, they're backbiting, they're pouty, they're haughty & headstrong... they're just not very likable people. Well, I for one do not see any of this as a problem! In fact, I think this take on the &#34;Justice League&#34; makes for better story telling.Keeping in mind that this feature is the first one based on DC's &#34;New 52&#34; storyline (unless one wishes to include &#34;Flashpoint Paradox,&#34; which I personally do not), I do not see the characters' behaviors as being any sort of a major problem. Nerve grating? You bet! -- that is, *IF* you're any of the &#34;over 20&#34; crowd who has grown up on a steady diet of archetypal &#34;honorable hero&#34; vs. &#34;unambiguous rogues & villiains&#34; who play their respective (expected) roles: whether these are characters as portrayed in comic books, professional wrestling arenas, first-person shooter video games, etc.So even though it was somewhat &#34;unsettling&#34; to observe these great heroic figures acting all cocky and/or behaving so immaturely with little or no refinement, this set-up actually works and plays out more realistically (though admittedly it's a bit &#34;overdone&#34; at times) once we take into consideration that (in this &#34;new&#34; reality) these are in fact &#34;NEW&#34; characters with &#34;never before seen&#34; abilities who have been thrown into a society &#34;unprepared&#34; for them and often &#34;unreceptive&#34; and &#34;distrusting&#34; of them -- in other words, the people (of the &#34;New 52&#34; universe) have yet to view and embrace these &#34;aberrations&#34; as &#34;heroes,&#34; even when they do things that clearly are &#34;heroic&#34; in nature!So it &#34;feels right&#34; that these &#34;unique&#34; individuals who are just &#34;starting out&#34; do not feel a need to behave &#34;stoically&#34; or with a mind of &#34;responsibility&#34; and &#34;respect&#34; toward the public at large or even toward one another, thus they have this air of &#34;self-importance&#34; about themselves -- or to quote it another way, &#34;With great Power comes great Arrogance.&#34; These characters with their &#34;special abilities&#34; which nobody (not even the &#34;supers&#34; themselves) yet fully understands or respects are more-or-less acting on &#34;impulse,&#34; much in the same way that any one of us who found ourselves endowed with a similar &#34;special ability&#34; or &#34;fortuitous advantage&#34; which had just been suddenly thrust upon us would/might fall susceptible (think your typical newly discovered &#34;hot&#34; film/television/radio &#34;overnight sensations&#34; who rapidly expect to receive &#34;preferential treatment&#34; in all aspects of their public lives, for example). These are characters who are still trying to make sense of their world and to find a way to fit/work in and around it -- in fact, the whole time I was watching things play out with them, one though kept haunting my mind: &#34;These guys are just within a breath and a half of becoming the 'Crime Syndicate'!&#34; (see &#34;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&#34; to get the reference)So watching these individuals not only coming to terms with their &#34;special abilities&#34; but also trying to &#34;manage&#34; them in ways just enough to keep themselves from crossing over that fine line into the &#34;dark side,&#34; as it were, it was refreshing to watch &#34;heroes&#34; *GROW* into their own, rather than just being &#34;born honorable&#34; or having an &#34;epiphany&#34; which makes them instantaneously &#34;angelic&#34;: these are &#34;good&#34; people who recognize that what abilities they possess could easily &#34;corrupt&#34; them, but who are still working their way through these abilities trying to find their &#34;true calling.&#34;I was initially afraid that they were going to try to go the &#34;X-Men&#34; route by making the &#34;New 52&#34; characters the objects of blanket hatred by the masses (perhaps they can still go back to their archives and reintroduce &#34;G. Gordon Godfrey / Glorious Godfrey&#34; from the &#34;Legends&#34; mini-series and work that back in into the &#34;N52&#34; line, especially since they decided to introduce Darkseid so early on in the new history), but the fact that after having been objects of so much distrust, theses &#34;costumed vigilantes&#34; have actually shown themselves to be on &#34;our side&#34; and have thus not only won the respect & admiration of the masses, but the &#34;costumed&#34; warriors themselves have also come to appreciate and have more respect for what possessing those powers and abilities truly means to themselves and to others, and that these chains of events with regard to the repelled intergalactic invasion becomes the catalyst which finally begins to transform what are essentially a group of reckless kids in adult bodies (though still quite literally in Cap.Marvel's/SHAZAM's case) into the &#34;heroes&#34; we know we can expect them to become in time.",4,"HEROES in the

1677852,A328LDN888DWN5,B00GD9GNEY,"Allan Lclark ""badboy""","[0, 0]",Got a chance to look at new DC comics animation movie war. For starters it may be best you have your snacks and drink right there before you begin. This story begin on a very quick pace and continue thourgh out the movie.There is plenty of action in this movie. The fight scenes are intense and gritty and so is some of the words. But it was nice to see wonderwomen in her new outfit. Along with seeing superman in a new uniform as well.To me it seem to be the same old foe either brianace or darkside. I guess DC feels that is a way to get the best out of superman with either one of them battling him in this movie.It was nice that they show us how cyborg was created. Plus adding captain marvel didnt hurt. But the green lantern hal jordon from animated series was mia here. This bozo was a know it all hot headed fool. His attemp at humor with cool hand shake with the flash was a reach. But flash was on point here along with cyborg and captain marvel.Darkside play his role rather well. Some neagatives superman act like a jerk though out this movie. Especialy after he saw wonder women constantly trying to show how strong he was i guess he was trying to impress amazon beauty.Plus orther than closing the deal the b team with flash cyborg wonder woman captain marvel green lantern did most of the work in this movie.Wonder Women in this movie seem more gun ho on killing and fighting. If it wasnt for new outfit and way she was drawn with curves she really wouldnt made no difference. Batman on the orther side of it sound feable and old. Give me a batman with a raspy voice but edge and angry. This is a good movie if you like good fighting scenes. It worth a look if you are justice league fan.

1677862,A38I3HXMQ712A1,B00GD9GNEY,Autumn M.,"[0, 2]","I've always been a fan of the DC Animated Universe since ""Batman: The Animated Series"" in the 90s. When it comes to superhero comics adaptations, I think animation is a better medium than live action. ""Justice League: War"" is the latest release from DC and Warner Bros. animation and I liked it so much that I will list 5 things I loved about ""Justice League: War"" and 2 things I disliked. First, the dislikes.2. Actually this is more of a warning than a dislike. It's PG-13 so there's a lot of slicing, hacking and a gory discretion shot of an alien being ""transformed"" into a parademon. Not for the faint of heart or for very little children. Also, some swear words. And it's not just ""damn"" and ""hell"". Also when Superman releases the prisoners that were to undergo this transformation,only humans were seen. We never find out what happened to the aliens that were abducted as well. What happened to them? We're they already transformed? Did any escape? I may be human but I care about the welfare of aliens too.1. There are six male superheroes and only one superheroine. Why does Wonder Woman always have to be the only woman among men. I wish another heroine was added to the group, like Black Canary or Vixen or Big Barda or maybe even Katana. If the Smurfette Principle in this film bothers you, I recommend ""Superman/ Batman: Apocalypse"" (It has 3 female superheroes and it passes the Bechtel Test).Now for the likes:5. It has Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel is my third favorite superhero and he often gets overlooked by the more ""hip"" serious superheroes. I love it when there are stories in the DCAU that involve ""Shazaam"".4. In ""Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" The Flash was the doofus and Green Lantern had more sense. Now it's the other way around.3. Believe it or not Batman and Green Lantern have something in common. I won't tell you what.2. ""Ice Cream is Wonderful!"" Wonder Woman gets some of the best lines in the movie and some of the funniest moments.

Too bad that it's SO true.The first &#34;hero&#34; is Green Lantern. It's revealed that he is Hal Jordan but I was sure it HAD to be someone different. He's an arrogant jerk who constantly curses and insults others while making pop-culture jokes. GL tells Batman &#34;I'm Green Lantern damn it&#34; and later calls Batman a &#34;phenomenal DOUCHE BAG&#34; and a &#34;moron&#34; (NOT kid friendly entertainment). He makes a &#34;True Blood&#34; joke calling Batman a vampire. He then brags about his impatience to meet, and fight, Superman. He introduces Flash to Batman and tells Flash that Batman is &#34;a total tool.&#34; He meets Cyborg and says, &#34;who the hell are you, Mr. Roboto?&#34; He tells Wonder Woman to &#34;stab that son-of-a-bitch in the eyes&#34; and calls Flash a &#34;smart ass&#34; (she does stab Darkseid in the eye in graphically bloody detail, too). And of course yells, &#34;kick his ass&#34; in the heat of a battle - like a positive and composed role-model should.Luckily, as expected, Batman is the only character that rings true as he suffers through the incompetence of the other heroes.Next up is Flash, the Barry Allen CSI tech version. It is a shame that he's the only likable and positive character (until his final act which is despicable).Billy Batson is introduced as a lying thief who cons his way into a football game and steals a jersey. Then he smuggly brags to his fellow orphans about it (they rightfully call him &#34;a jerk&#34;). He tells Cyborg not to tell the others his identity cuz, &#34;it's none of their freaking business.&#34; What a &#34;lovable&#34; kid.Wonder Woman is told by a bystander that she &#34;dresses like a whore&#34;!!!! She ropes him and he admits he &#34;cross-dresses in a  Wonder Woman outfit&#34; too which she laughs at him. A guy in a car yells at her, &#34;Freaking Bimbo&#34;. So please don't show this to little girls.Superman is introduced by GL just attacking him saying, &#34;Green Lantern kicks Superman's ass - on TMZ at eleven&#34;. Of course Superman then fights Batman who never thinks to just introduce himself until he realizes Superman is &#34;pissed off.&#34;. Of course, as seems to be DC mandate lately, Superman is captured and horrifically tortured (his eyes even wired open and filled with fluids).The best story arch is Cyborgs, but it is gruesome and far too graphic for kids who will see his arms and legs blown off and him lying covered in burns. His transformation involves tons of graphic injections and screams of pain. His first Cyborg form is disturbing, too.And how do our heroes save the day, they literally, and graphically stab Darkseids eyes out with a sword (WW) and a crowbar (by the Flash!).As a fan of these characters for decades, it is a shame that the Timm, Burnett, Dini years have been so tarnished by this New 52 work.

What surprised me was the use of foul language throughout the movie which came across as an attempt to add a sense of maturity to the show.  Instead of adding maturity, it created an unclear message/direction of what the movie attempted to do.  I understand the DC Universe has a wide and diverse audience, however; as a long time fan I am very disappointed.  After a few minutes into the movie, I disconnected from the story.Another disappointment was the preview section of movies that are in the works.  I'll say it once again - Another Batman Movie????  I like Batman very much but how many Batman movies do we have to see when the DC Universe is so darn Big?  I'm tired of seeing Batman in the Big and Small Screen.

Once I understood that there were all new voice actors (right around the five minute mark or so), I sat back and enjoyed the ride! As much as it pains all of us to watch something we love change over time, I think that kind of evolution is necessary to pull in the next generation of fans. Lots of action, great dialogue, and a surprise nod during the credits to one of the JL members I thought was overlooked. In addition, I think Shemar Moore did an outstanding job as Cyborg- I hope he returns in DC's future offerings.

1677876,A1N00127IDBHD6,B00GD9GNEY,CConn,"[12, 16]","Right off the bad, this movie will (and already has) received a lot of negative chatter purely due to the comic it's based off of. For those that don't know, the inspiration for this adaptation - Geoff Johns' Justice League: Origins - reset the continuity of the entirety of DC Comics. In one issue, the entire history as we know of it of Batman, Superman and every single one of DC's characters was wiped aware, replaced with an interpretation all unto it's own; partially a continuation of what we already knew of the DC Universe, and partially something all unto itself.Obviously, this is something that is going to upset a great multitude of people. And it did. And for the sake of artistic integrity, we must ignore all of it. A story should be based upon it's own merits, all of it's various repercussions and real world implications should never really come into play. The question, and consideration, should be just how good Justice League: Origins is as a stand alone story.Sadly, even when looking at it through that, entirely non-judgemental vein, it's all together a pretty terribly written story. Lacking in plot and stagnant in progression, the story ultimately devolves into the meeting of the various Justice League members and a brief and anti-climatic finale with one of DC's best villains - Darkseid - that ultimately wastes the potential of both Darkseid, and the Justice League themselves. To compound that, the dialogue in the story ends up being incredibly stilted, corny, and unrealistic, taking on the childish and unintentionally comedic tone of old comics from the 50s and 60s. Worst of all, the dialogue renders most of the characters in the story quite wholly unlikeable. Green Lantern is written as if he's a 13 year old boy, Wonder Woman is reduced to an angry and foolish adolescent girl, and Superman is unnecessarily violent and lacks all of the goodness and tact of his normal persona. This all boils down to a very forgettable and common place comic book, that really can be enjoyed for little more than its spectacular art by Jim Lee.Despite that, however, I had quite a bit of hope going into Justice League: War. This isn't the first time the DC Animated team tackled a rather mediocre story and refined it into a very well written and enjoyable film. With the general outline of the story strong - the formation of the Justice League, and Darkseid attempting to take over the planet - and cast of characters that, in every other DC Animated Feature have been great, I held out hope that the filmmakers could refine and age Geoff Johns' original story into something more sophisticated, complex, and mature.In a word, it fails to do that. While the addition of Shazam and a few stylistic choices cleans up some of the rush edges of original story, the plot remains as simplistic and downright boring as its source material. It would be apt to call this the Michael Bay version of a Justice League movie; with characterization and plotting taking a firm backseat to almost endless amounts of action and fight scenes with little purpose or sense behind them. The majority of the movie is dedicated to these kinds of bland and uninspired action.Between those torrents of violence and mayhem is characterization and dialogue that does little to improve upon Johns' unfathomably immature and unintelligent work, turning its main characters into a group of whiny, unlikeable and arguing children, squabbling with each other for much too long when obvious resolutions and much more dire plot concerns lay just barely out of reach.As I previously mentioned, the film does clean up some of the flaws of the original; making the movie more of a cinematic experience, showing some added emotion and character progression for Cyborg and Shazam and providing a concluding battle that is - barely - a more satisfying experience. I did enjoy the character designs and animation more than several of DC's other animated films, Jim Lee's art style is clearly evident, and the character designs in this film are head and shoulders above some of the more atypical designs showcased in movies like Superman vs. The Elite and Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, but animation alone - at least animation of this caliber - can hardly save the film from its odious origins, just as the minor tweaks are never able to lift the film out of the sizable creative hole that Geoff Johns dug with his story.On the bright side, if DC does decide to continue to follow the comic series, Johns' storytelling did markedly improve in subsequent arcs, and with insiders' hints at Aquaman being featured in upcoming releases, there may yet be some hope to a return to the quality and ingenuity the DC Animated filmmakers are usually able to provide.",2,A failed first act to the Justice League's early years.,1390694400,"01 26,

This movie was an utter betrayal of the characters and all theyve stood for, some as long as 75 yrs. Batman is cold, calculating and manipulative but was probably the least changed from his recent interpretations. Superman is as American as apple pie, raised in the bread basket to encompase everything good about America and dream of emmigration in a new land, Batman says and i quote&#34;Superman wont hurt us he doesnt kill.&#34; Superman then proceeds to tear an alien in HALF with his bare hands and then slaughter hundreds more, is this the interpretation we want for our kids for my son, killing is ok without finding an alternative first.

Silva ""Superman_242""","[4, 8]","It's a well known fact that for the most part Marvel makes better live action movies and DC makes better Animated movies.  Where the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern film failed, the animated Green Lantern: First Flight was very near animation perfection.  I own almost every DC Animated film and I think that almost all of them are spectacular.  In fact, I think they are getting better with time: their latest, The Flashpoint Paradox, is the best comic-to-movie adaptation I think I've ever seen outside of the Christopher Nolan Batman films.  So, when they announced that they were adapting the popular and critically-acclaimed Geoff Johns/Jim Lee story Justice League: Origin, I was quite intrigued.  I hoped that they would be able to keep the character banter in tact, which was the defining attribute of the original story arc.  I'm happy to report that they did.SynopsisBased on the critically acclaimed original run written by Geoff Johns (my favorite comic writer by far) and drawn by Jim Lee, War focuses on the original meeting of Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Shazam as retold in the DC Comics 'New 52' reboot of the Justice League title.ReviewThe story is almost exactly the same as the comics with only one big change: they swapped out Aquaman for Shazam.  I was actually really looking forward to seeing Geoff Johns' reinvented Aquaman on screen, but I have to admit that Shazam was a great addition and added a lot of humor and all around awesomeness.  Stay after the credits and you will see why they left out everyone's favorite fish friend.The characters are very similar to their comic counterparts, which is a really good thing.  It very much feels like a Justice League film that Joss Whedon could have written.  It has the strong and quirky characters that Whedon prides himself on, and the banter between these heroes is laugh-out-loud funny.  To tell you the truth, if I hadn't read the comics I would have suspected that this was a Whedon endeavor.  Out of all the DC animated films, this one has the strongest character work.The voices were good, but I do feel that the old crew was missed (Tim Daly, Kevin Conroy, Nathan Fillion, etc).  This is where Shazam shines, though, with Samwise himself (Sean Astin) providing the voice for him!  Also, Cyborg/Victor Stone was great (voiced by Criminal Minds' Shemar Moore), yet a little out of place considering that his voice sounded older than the man playing his father.  Also, they tried to make Darkseid menacing by not making him talk much and making his voice extremely gravelly.  This didn't work for me.  Darkseid is really hard to get right, so I suppose some slack should be given to them.I'm still not a fan of the animation style.  It's very similar to Flashpoint, and I think that was the film's one weakness.  It feels like the lens is dirty or something and I just don't dig it.Another part where this film shines is in its action.  It has the best animated action set pieces I have seen in a long time.  My jaw dropped more than once.ConclusionJustice League War has weaknesses, however they are so strongly overshadowed by the films' strengths that it was almost impossible for me not to love this movie.  Strong characters and amazing action sequences make this a fine addition to DC's Animated Universe.4.25/5 Stars, but I will round up this time.It will be released on Blu-ray/DVD on February 4, 2014.

Definitely not recommended for kids (gross moment with blood and animals).I could go on, but I'd definitely check out the other reviews in the negative column.  The positive ones seem to watch with their minds turned off while the negative ones understand storytelling and acting.Sadly this Justice League is not a group I'd want living near me, let alone that I'd want to meet.  They are jerks.Some of it was trying to be funny, but in their weak attempts at humor they criminalized their characters.Seriously, the ice cream moment was just awful.  And she's part of the Justice League?  Nothing ""justice"" about it.It really is just one big battle with no plot.  The ending of Man of Steel had more plot than this entire show.And yes, I buy ALL movies, I'm a movie addict, but I won't be buying this one after I saw it.  After Justice League Paradox (there's no way to disarm these bombs because they're from the future ... oh wait, let each hero show you a different way) I rent before I buy, and after this one I'll be waiting for good word of mouth before I even rent from DC.This is what happens when ""good"" and ""hero"" is taken out of the Justice League and it's just a super battle instead of anything with value.

1677892,AYRFLAT8VF732,B00GD9GNEY,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[0, 1]","Justice League Unlimited ended in 2006, DC has been putting out these direct to video movies since 2007, and DC made a reboot of their universe in 2012. Here we are at the first adaptation of one of the ""New 52"" comics - Justice League: War, based off of the first Justice League storylineJustice League, Vol. 1: Origin (The New 52).Full disclosure, I didn't read the original comic, but I generally like the team behind it. Geoff Johns is a good writer most of the time, and Jim Lee is a superstar artists. I wasn't reading DC comics, because every jumping on point is a jumping off point, and I had left DC behind when they started their reboot. But, let's evaluate what kind of gains they make then they're not bogged down by decades of character development.Green Lantern is chasing a mysterious figure through Gotham, before crashing into Batman and they team up to discover the purpose of the creature they were chasing. This lead them to team up with Superman, and later the Flash, Wonder Woman, Shazam, and Cyborg, to fight off an invasion by Darkseid.Like a lot of people I wonder why they chose Darkseid as their first antagonists, because it leaves little places to go for escalation. The answer is that Darkseid is a very boring enemy. Other interpretations of Darkseid have painted him as a smug despot that took pleasure in stealing freedom and joy from the universe. This new Darkseid feels nothing. He's a stone faced totem, going from planet to planet to consume it a la Galactus.The heroes are a mixed bag. Without judging each individual voice actor, all I can say is you'll want to be forgiving. Character wise... I was not impressed. Batman is always right, because people expect Batman to always be right. Superman although portrayed as very powerful, can be very blunt and unlikable (though they tell me he was worse in the comic). Green Lantern - Hal Jordan is a total ""Bro,"" - a cocky jock that frequently embarrasses himself (hard to believe Geoff Johns would write him like that. The Flash has little screen time, but he come out fine. This is also Cyborg's Origin story, and he's okay.I hate Wonder Woman in this. She's supposed to be an ambassador, but she has no people skills. It's an annoying trend I've noticed that DC likes to put a leash on their female characters. She might be super strong, but she need handlers to keep her from embarrassing herself. Wonder Woman, Miss Martian, and Starfire all sit in the ""funny foreign exchange student"" table, and she immediately starts to fall for Superman like she's a high school freshman and he's the senior star quarterback. It's very shallow.Then there's Shazam. Aquaman was in the original comics, which was a nice touch, because with Cyborg in place of the Martian Manhunter, the same team that took on Darkseid also took on Starro the Conqueror in the JLA's first adventure in 1960. But Shazam comes out of nowhere, without any explanation. I know who Shazam is, my online handle is DC_Fan_52, but I'm guessing John Q. Public doesn't know! You'll be left scratching your head why this kid has powers! There's not even a hint of what's going on!In the end, no matter how good the action is, the weak characters really hamper the movie. I would not want to follow these characters in the future. Do I really want to see Clark and Diana making kiss-y faces at each other? Or see if Batman gives Green Lantern that fistbump that he's practically begging for? Or the Adventures of Captain Where-do-my-Powers-come-from? (Actually I would, I generally like Shazam.)Special Features on the Blu-Ray includeDeconstructing War with Jay Olivia and Jim Lee - Jim Lee and Jay Olivia talking about the movie for 20 minutesCreating Heroes: The Life and Art of Jim Lee - a 40 minute look at Jim Lee's career.Justice League Act D - From Animatic to Pencil TestFrom the DC Comics Vault: The last episode of JLU - Destroyer with Darkseid, Batman the Brave and the Bold - The Malicious Mr. Mind featuring Captain Marvel also known as Shazam, and two episodes of Young Justice Invasion.A Sneak Peek at Batman and SonI'm always open to new interpretations of character, but this opening adventure was noticeably weak. As I've said, an ongoing television series staring these characters is one that would have to move on without me.

Here they took a recent &#34;52&#34; reboot graphic novel and animated it.  All the rebooted stories, redesign of costumes mostly by artist Jim Lee are presented here without any consideration of viewers with no knowledge of the source material.  And even for those of us familiar with the changes, the animation version of this particular graphic novel sucks.1. Illustration.  Did these guys do any modeling, turnarounds? ...as the faces are drawn poorly, with Superman's face seeming to change with every scene.2. Characters. The characters don't seem to maintain a consistent personality throughout the movie. For example, Shazam is a cocky little kid (like his 52 version) yet is a shy person when he is the superhero. Superman is a jerk throughout, Diana's personality is obnoxious. There seems to be no difference between the Flash and Green Lantern, and the only reason we know the Flash is Barry is solely by the blond hair and CSI on his shirt, otherwise he is a poor amalgam of the two characters.3. Voices. I've always admired Romano's choice of voice actors, but she has really disappointed me in this movie. She always says that she goes out of her way to find voices that are unique, that resonated, which is needed when depicting superheroes. In this movie everyone sounds &#34;normal.4. Battle Scenes. They were interminable.  Reminded me of Transformer movies...where half the movie is just one long battle...boring!!!

1677899,A3EMZGIMSKRMA5,B00GD9GNEY,Earl T. Allison II,"[1, 2]","First off, let me be honest.  I don't like the vast majority of the nu52.  I don't like how Flashpoint created this new DC Universe (hasn't the constant rebooting since 1985's Crisis been done ENOUGH?), and I don't like a lot of the designs.Superman's iconic costume is the most changed of the lot, done to avoid lawsuit and owing money to the original creators.  Darkseid is also vastly changed (and IMHO not for the better).  Here he doesn't come across like a force of nature, but more like a roaring monster.The animated DCU features have never shied away from violence, but this seemed a bit gratuitous in stabbing out Darkseid's eyes.  Now, I've only skimmed the original Justice League arc this comes from, so maybe that is accurate, but it was shocking -- even more shocking that the Flash, Barry Allen, puts out his second eye.  This is not the pre-Crisis Flash, certainly!There isn't a lot of characterization here, either.  Basically, Batman is the ever-prepared Bat-God, Wonder Woman is almost a parody of the warrior, Green Lantern is a buffoon to be laughed at, and Superman is a pompous jerk.  Shazam/Captain Marvel is still the kid in a grown-up body, and Cyborg hasn't been anything like the Wolfman/Perez Vic Stone in years, so his persona here isn't really defined much beyond an origin story and being conveniently able to provide exposition.I know the DCU movies tend to be short, but this one seemed even shorter insofar as it just jumped from point to point willy-nilly.I didn't HATE this, not at all, it just wasn't really my style, and the lack of development (and what little we DID get seems to indicate most of these people are not fun to be around) seemed to stick out more than most of their releases.If you loved the original nu52 Justice League this is based off, you will almost certainly like this release.  However, I actually HATED the Flashpoint comics, and the animated version of that was more entertaining (again, IMHO).If you're expecting the old Cartoon Network Justice League, the Batman:TAS or Superman:TAS, or even the characters as seen in things like Crisis on Two Earths (it and The New Frontier are probably my absolute favorites of the releases), you are going to be surprised if not disappointed.I again won't say this is a bad release, just a bit abrupt.  The animation and voice-acting is well done, but the characters aren't well developed, or so radically different from what they used to be, that they really should have been new character entirely.Enjoy!",3,"It is very much the nu52 DCU, for what that is worth (spoilers, naturally).",1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2511,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'vast', 'majority', 'nu52', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Flashpoint', 'created', 'new', 'DC', 'Universe', ""n't"", 'constant', 'rebooting', '1985', 'Crisis', 'been', 'done', 'ENOUGH', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'designs.Superman', 'iconic', 'costume', 'most', 'changed', 'lot', 'done', 'avoid', 'lawsuit', 'owing', 'money', 'original', 'creators', 'Darkseid', 'also', 'vastly', 'changed', 'IMHO', 'not', 'better', 'Here', ""n't"", 'come', 'force', 'nature', 'more', 'roaring', 'monster.The', 'animated', 'DCU', 'features', 'have', 'never', 'shied', 'away', 'violence', 'seemed', 'bit', 'gratuitous', 'stabbing', 'out', 'Darkseid', 'eyes', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'only', 'skimmed', 'original', 'Justice', 'League', 'arc', 'maybe', 'accurate', 'was', 'shocking', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'Flash', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'out', 'second', 'eye', 'not', 'pre-Crisis', 'Flash', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'lot', 'characterization', 'here', 'either', 'Basically', 'Batman', 'ever-prepared', 'Bat-God', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'almost', 'parody', 'warrior', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'buffoon', 'be', 'laughed', 'Superman', 'pompous', 'jerk', 'Shazam/Captain', 'Marvel', 'still', 'kid', 'grown-up', 'body', 'Cyborg', ""n't"", 'been', 'anything', 'Wolfman/Perez', 'Vic', 'Stone', 'years', 'persona', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'defined', 'much', 'origin', 'story', 'being', 'conveniently', 'able', 'provide', 'exposition.I', 'know', 'DCU', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'short', 'one', 'seemed', 'even', 'shorter', 'insofar', 'just', 'jumped', 'point', 'point', 'willy-nilly.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'HATE', 'not', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'style', 'lack', 'development', 'what', 'little', 'DID', 'get', 'indicate', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'fun', 'be', 'around', 'seemed', 'stick', 'out', 'more', 'most', 'releases.If', 'loved', 'original', 'nu52', 'Justice', 'League', 'based', 'off', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'release', 'However', 'actually', 'HATED', 'Flashpoint', 'comics', 'animated', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'again', 'IMHO', '.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'old', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Justice', 'League', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'even', 'characters', 'seen', 'things', 'Crisis', 'Two', 'Earths', 'New', 'Frontier', 'are', 'probably', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'releases', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'surprised', 'not', 'disappointed.I', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'release', 'just', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'animation', 'voice-acting', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'developed', 'so', 'radically', 'different', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'character', 'entirely.Enjoy']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

1677901,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00GD9GNEY,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","I grew up reading DC Comics.  Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Green Lantern were always on my bookshelves, and, as I grew more and more familiar with them, I was even happier when I saw how the titles began blending one into another.  Pretty soon, crossover events were all the rage, and these tentpole projects gave writers and illustrators the chance to weave even grander yarns on an even bigger scale.  I&#8217;ll admit that I haven&#8217;t liked all of these blockbuster storylines &#8211; after a time, even they started to melt together and lose distinctiveness &#8211; but I do appreciate any tale that pushes the boundaries of ambition for the readers.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Somewhere around 2011, DC Comics realized that they&#8217;d created a monster.  Several monsters, really.  And all of them were a bit too Frankenstein for their own good.  It would seem that with decades of continuity issues as well as dozens of massive crossover events, they had created a world that couldn&#8217;t be fixed with yet one more &#8216;Crisis&#8217; premise &#8211; instead, they&#8217;d have to reboot the entire system.  I was one of the few vocal fans who argued vehemently against it; so far as I was concerned, there was no logical reason to ignore everything that had come before and wipe the slate clean, but it is what it is, and the powers that be went and did it.One of the more popular stories to emerge from &#8216;The New 52&#8217; was a relaunch of the Justice League in a series titled WAR, and now the DC Comics movie titles have followed suit with a fairly faithful adaptation for home viewing audiences.  In it, our seminal heroes &#8211; Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Shazam, and the Flash &#8211; have some superficial awareness of one another, but they&#8217;ve yet to encounter circumstances requiring their teaming up.  Well when some pesky warmonger from another universe named Darkseid sets his sights on invading Earth, there&#8217;s more than ample reason for these individual superstars to shelve their vanity and become a team, once and for all.That said, WAR is good, but if you&#8217;re even remotely familiar with any of these heroes in their individual incarnations it all feels a bit predictable.  Sure, I get that this is supposed to represent their first union, but as one who has seen them come together countless times before this one just didn&#8217;t cohere as strongly as I would&#8217;ve liked.  For example, the Justice League only operates in the United States during the main thrust of this invasion, but the audience is treated to animated sequences of these airborne demons operating around the world: who was fighting for mankind&#8217;s survival over there?It all feels mashed together, almost as if the writers wanted to stage something vastly epic in scope but didn&#8217;t have the time, effort, nor interest in truly fleshing it out that way.  After all, since this is their inaugural adventure, shouldn&#8217;t the bulk of the time be paid to the heroes, how they interact, and how they complement one another?  That&#8217;s what I mean when I say I was against rebooting the entire catalogue; when there are so many other stories that have been told before, what&#8217;s to make this one any different or &#8211; more importantly &#8211; any better?  It didn&#8217;t feel as if this was a strong outing, so it was hard to get drawn into this particular tale.This is the risk of reboots.  Because these direct-to-DVD releases rely on no established chronology, it gets hard for established readers and viewers to wonder why events already depicted in other releases don&#8217;t warrant any mention in this world.  It&#8217;s as if the Multiverse is back with a vengeance: each successive releases establishes yet one more Earth with which these heroes can now help shape.  How long will it be until DC starts redoing their previous animated films?  Or are we eventually do for our own &#8216;Crisis&#8217; meant to wipe out all of these alternate Earths to leave us with just one?I hope not.RECOMMENDED.  What started out as a minor quibble grows into something larger with JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR: while the DC Universe Original Movies are unquestionably some very high caliber entertainment, the fact that each successive one has no innate internal chronology to them but rather appear to be set within the fabric of a vastly unfolding Multiverse makes me go &#8220;huh?&#8221; as I go from watching one feature to the next.  WAR&#8217;s storyline follows in the footsteps of DC Comics&#8217; desire to softly reboot its entire catalogue, and, as such, there&#8217;s very little characterization to this outing but an awful, awful, awful lot of wreckage and carnage.  Good stuff, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed some of their latest meatier fare much more than this one.",3,Disappointing Slugfest That Lacks The Depth of Other DC Comics Original Movies,1395705600,"03 25,

1677905,A295L7HFVKQPTO,B00GD9GNEY,EO,"[9, 11]","I have said for years now, since the DC Comics animated movies started with Superman: Doomsday, that these movies could be made into full theatre release features.  Overall, I like them better than the live action movies that DC does.  I enjoyed the Nolan Batman series and I liked Man of Steel as well but the DC animated movie line just got it right every time.Then, I watched Justice League: War...What the Hell Happened?!?!?!?!The voice acting was terrible (with the exception of Shemar Moore/Cyborg and Chris Gorham/Flash).  I will say though, I thought that Jason O'Mara as Batman wasn't awful.  It's just somehow not the same when it's not Kevin Conroy.  That being said though...actors like Jeremy Sisto, Peter Weller and Bruce Greenwood have done a good job at bringing a voice to the Dark Knight.  O'Mara just wasn't quite good enough yet to convince me he was Batman.The story was supposed to be adapted from the Geoff Johns/Jim Lee story that introduced the Justice League to the New 52 Universe of DC.  It was a great story and great art!  As blah as I have felt about the new direction DC Comics has taken I have loved the Justice League books so far.  Plus, this story gave a great insight into the new take on these characters with their new looks, attitudes and the way they were introduced to each other.  It all worked so well.  That feeling was completely lost in this animated adaptation.There were many specific things that made me feel that this movie was inferior to the previous DC animated releases:1. Darkseid: He was lame and became the ridiculous generic bad guy they made him out to be in the Super Friends cartoons back in the 80&#8217;s.  He even had that annoying, graveled voice similar to how he sounded back then.  Good fit for what Super Friends was, bad for this movie.2. I may be the only person to say this but&#8230;Where the hell was Aquaman?  I enjoyed his character in the DC Comics version of this story.  In fact, he has become quite the bad ass in the New 52 universe and they toss him out for&#8230;3. Shazam!  Ok, while I respect the direction they&#8217;ve taken with the new origin of this character in the comics I did not like his addition to this story nor his characterization.  Besides, if you&#8217;re going to replace a central character from the original story why use Shazam?  (Who will always be named Captain Marvel to me, not sharing his name with the Wizard that gave him his powers.)  We already have Superman in the mix, why bring in Shazam?  Now I&#8217;ve always liked Sha&#8230;I can&#8217;t do it&#8230;Capt. Marvel and while I realize he&#8217;s similar to Superman they are different characters.  Bottom line though, if they wanted to have a story with the new Capt. Marvel they should&#8217;ve made a movie about his new origin.4. Could Wonder Woman have been any cornier?!  I see the direction they were trying to take but it took a wrong turn.  She sounded like she could&#8217;ve been a perfect fit for the campy old Batman TV show.  (Love that show though by the way.)  Her characterization was not a fit for this story.  And did we really need the ice cream scene?5. Superman and Green Lantern&#8217;s voices did not match them at all in my opinion.  Once again, I think I know what they were attempting to do but it just didn&#8217;t work.  These characters are based off their new looks and attitudes from the New 52 storyline but the voices just didn&#8217;t fit that for my taste.  GL just came off as a stupid blowhard as opposed to a headstrong newbie with his ring.  And Superman&#8230;Alan Tudyk is a good actor and all but I didn&#8217;t feel he was a good fit for the Man of Steel.  Superman should have a commanding yet understated voice being a Kansas boy.  Granted this was an interpretation of the new Superman who has not been in action for long and hasn&#8217;t fully developed into his role as a hero but he came off way too cocky and kind of a douche.6. Ok, I&#8217;m an adult and I&#8217;m not saying that my language is completely clean.  Plus, some of the DC animated movies lately have had mildly harsh language lately (as well as Lois Lane giving Brainiac the finger in Superman: Unbound) but this movie took it a bit too far I think.  Sure they may have been trying to match the gritty nature that the New 52 is taking in the comics but this just seemed forced.  &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s the New 52 style so we should probably have people cursing a lot.&#8221;7. This may be nit-picky but&#8230;When the President asks what their team&#8217;s name is at the end of the movie, Sha&#8230;Captain Marvel says &#8220;The Super Seven!&#8221;  I&#8217;m sorry, not only did you have him replace Aquaman, now we&#8217;re giving him lines from characters that are ACTUALLY STILL IN THE STORY?!  Flash said that when asked in the comic story.Overall, this movie was sub-par from the movies released previously from DC.  I hope that they don&#8217;t feel that the continuation of their animated films has to stay along this line because there are many great stories from before the New 52 that could still be adapted to the small screen.  Get your act together DC&#8230;",2,Very disappointed...,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,5160,"['have', 'said', 'years', 'now', 'DC', 'Comics', 'animated', 'movies', 'started', 'Superman', 'Doomsday',

1677909,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00GD9GNEY,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 1]","DC Comics shook up the comic book world in 2011 by completely rebooting their entire line of comic book titles. It was a shake-up that left many fanboys and girls angry, while others just embraced the change and moved on. I was one of the folks who jumped on the train and went along for the ride.With the monthly titles continuing to develop, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. trudged on putting out animated movies the same way they always had. None of the modifications made to the new Universe were addressed&#8230; until now. It's 2014 and the time has come for the New 52 world to bleed over into the DC animated cosmos with &#34;Justice League: War.&#34;When agents of a devastating intergalactic power named Darkseid start planting doorways to another world, a team of super heroes must reluctantly join forces. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Shazam come together to keep the armies of the evil Lord of Apokolips from entering our cosmos. Can the costumed champions stay united long enough to save our planet from certain doom?Let's address a few issues quickly before moving on with the review. Aquaman is replaced by Shazam in the animated adaptation of the graphic novel &#34;Justice League: Origin.&#34; By the end of &#34;War,&#34; it's evident they wanted to give the King of Atlantis a much bigger introduction. Also, if you're expecting a familiar voice cast you better forget it. Moving into the New 52 obviously means moving into new vocal territory.&#34;Justice League: War&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1). Besides a strange haze over the picture, the image is clean and vibrant. The haze is normal for these animated movies and I've addressed it before. It must be intentional as it's always there. Being that it's based on a comic book, the colors are all vivid and tantalizing when it comes to the picture.A 5.1 Dolby Digital DTS-HD surround sound mix is provided for &#34;Justice League: War.&#34; It envelopes the home audience in all the explosions, laser shots, and dramatic dialogue and music you've come to expect from these entertaining films. You'll truly feel like you're in the middle of the battle and devastation.&#34;Justice League: War&#34; is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action, and some language. There's nothing out of the ordinary for super hero movies to mention here. Parents need to remember that just because it's a cartoon doesn't mean it's appropriate for everyone.Bonus material for &#34;Justice League: War&#34; includes three featurettes entitled &#34;Creating Heroes: The Life and Art of Jim Lee,&#34; &#34;Deconstructing War with Jay Oliva and Jim Lee,&#34; and &#34;'Justice League: War' Act D - From Animatic to Pencil Test.&#34; Four vintage cartoons from the DC Comics Vault are also found. A sneak preview of the next DC Universe animated movie, &#34;Son of Batman,&#34; is featured as well.Although it's voice cast will likely take a bit of getting used to for people accustomed to the past DC television shows and movies, &#34;Justice League: War&#34; will entertain with non-stop action and quick pacing. It almost seems like it moves along too quickly at times if that's possible. The teaser during the credits definitely got me excited for the next installment, so be sure and watch until the end.",4,&#8220;Justice League: War&#8221; Brings the Animated DC Movies into the New 52,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,3336,"['DC', 'Comics', 'shook', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'world', '2011', 'completely', 'rebooting', 'entire', 'line', 'comic', 'book', 'titles', 'was', 'shake-up', 'left', 'many', 'fanboys', 'girls', 'angry', 'others', 'just', 'embraced', 'change', 'moved', 'was', 'one', 'folks', 'who', 'jumped', 'train', 'went', 'along', 'ride.With', 'monthly', 'titles', 'continuing', 'develop', 'DC', 'Entertainment', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'trudged', 'putting', 'out', 'animated', 'movies', 'same', 'way', 'always', 'had', 'None', 'modifications', 'made', 'new', 'Universe', 'were', 'addressed', '8230', 'now', '2014', 'time', 'come', 'New', '52', 'world', 'bleed', 'over', 'DC', 'animated', 'cosmos', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War.', '34', 'When', 'agents', 'devastating', 'intergalactic', 'power', 'named', 'Darkseid', 'start', 'planting', 'doorways', 'world', 'team', 'super', 'heroes', 'must', 'reluctantly', 'join', 'forces', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Flash', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Cyborg', 'Shazam', 'come', 'together', 'keep', 'armies', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Apokolips', 'entering', 'cosmos', 'Can', 'costumed', 'champions', 'stay', 'united', 'long', 'enough', 'save', 'planet', 'certain', 'doom', 'Let', 'address', 'few', 'issues', 'quickly', 'moving', 'review', 'Aquaman', 'replaced', 'Shazam', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'Origin.', '34', 'end', '34', 'War', '34', 'evident', 'wanted', 'give', 'King', 'Atlantis', 'much', 'bigger', 'introduction', 'Also', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'familiar', 'voice', 'cast', 'better', 'forget', 'Moving', 'New', '52', 'obviously', 'moving', 'new', 'vocal', 'territory.', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', '16x9', '1.78:1', 'strange', 'haze', 'picture', 'image', 'clean', 'vibrant', 'haze', 'normal', 'animated', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'addressed', 'must', 'be', 'intentional', 'always', 'there', 'Being', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'tantalizing', 'when', 'picture.A', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS-HD', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'provided', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War.', '34', 'home', 'audience', 'explosions', 'laser', 'shots', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'music', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'entertaining', 'films', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'feel', ""'re"", 'middle', 'battle', 'devastation.', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', '34', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'sequences', 'violence', 'action', 'language', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'mention', 'here', 'Parents', 'need', 'remember', 'just', 'cartoon', ""n't"", 'mean', 'appropriate', 'everyone.Bonus', 'material', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', '34', 'three', 'featurettes', 'entitled', '34', 'Creating', 'Heroes', 'Life', 'Art', 'Jim', 'Lee', '34', '34', 'Deconstructing', 'War', 'Jay', 'Oliva', 'Jim', 'Lee', '34', '34', 'League', 'War', 'Act', 'D', 'From', 'Animatic', 'Pencil', 'Test.', '34', 'Four', 'vintage', 'cartoons', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Vault', 'are', 'also', 'found', 'sneak', 'preview', 'next', 'DC', 'Universe', 'animated', 'movie', '34', 'Son', 'Batman', '34', 'featured', 'voice', 'cast', 'will', 'likely', 'take', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'people', 'accustomed', 'past', 'DC', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', '34', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', '34', 'will', 'entertain', 'non-stop', 'action', 'quick', 'pacing', 'almost', 'along', 'too', 'quickly', 'times', 'possible', 'teaser', 'credits', 'definitely', 'got', 'excited', 'next', 'installment', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'end']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

Initially trading Aquaman for Captain Marvel didn't phase me, but as soon as he said &#34;Shazam&#34; and didn't change back into Billy Batson it lost all credibility whatsoever.Also, they tried to have kid friendly moments but overall this is not a kid friendly film. Superman kills, and even the killings of Parademons can't be justified because each one was a kidnapped victim of Darkseid's that there may have been a way to cure.Of all the direct to video films DC has done this was the worst.

1677913,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GD9GNEY,FNDNreview,"[0, 1]","Honestly, it&#8217;s becoming more and more complicated trying to explain the premise of DC Comic&#8217;s New 52 universe.  In the event you follow comics, you&#8217;re probably well aware of what&#8217;s going on here, but for causal observes or people that don&#8217;t necessarily follow comic books at all, here&#8217;s the skinny:  in 2011, DC Comics decided to reboot/revamp their entire universe.  In essence, the characters that we all know and love, like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc., each received a visual update and modern origin stories &#8211; establishing edgier heroes for the 21st century, not to mention creating a &#8220;jumping on&#8221; point for potential new readers.  To that end, DC Animation is now using those revamped stories as the basis for new direct-to-video ideas.  And, so here we have the modernized formation of the Justice League in the new animated feature, Justice League: War.Based on the DC storyline Justice League: Origin written by Geoff Johns, War begins by introducing Green Lantern (Justin Kirk) as he chases a hooded figure through Gotham City.  Batman (Jason O&#8217;Mara) also quickly takes notice of the hooded creature, along with Green Lantern and so we witness the first meeting between these two unique personalities.  The two naturally clash upon meeting, but decide it&#8217;s in their best interest to defeat the mysterious bad guy before he is able to strategically place a bomb in the sewers.With the ugly cloaked monster subdued, both Batman and Green Lantern are unable to identify the bomb&#8217;s origin and believe the super powered alien, known as Superman (Alan Tudyk), might have some answers in Metropolis.  However, Superman has an attack first, ask questions later mentality and the three duke it out &#8211; eventually coming to the conclusion they all have the same mystery to solve.Coinciding with these events, several other characters are introduced, including The Flash (Christopher Gorham), Wonder Woman (Michelle Monaghan), a mischievous kid (Sean Astin), and a football star named Victor Stone (Sherman Moore).  While having an argument with his father, Victor feels the brunt of an explosion from one of the mysterious bombs that his father has been studying.  The bomb infects Victor to the extent that his father must save him by injecting him with untested cybernetic technology.  While all of this is happening, soldiers from a mysterious world pour in through portals and begin attacking the Earth.  Their leader is a powerful lord, calling himself Darkseid (Steven Blum).With some many new heroes attempting to stop the terror, and each believing they can handle the threat on their own &#8211; this group must find a way to work together or suffer the dire consequences of having Darkseid plunder the planet, like he has countless times in the past.If you purchased or viewed DC&#8217;s previous animated release, The Flashpoint Paradox, then you could easily call Justice League: War a continuation/sequel to those events.  Once again, if you follow the comic book storylines, then you know that the events of Flashpoint are the prelude to the events of everything that happens in the New 52 universe.  Personally, I choose to look at War as a sequel, otherwise this new release just loses its flavor to me and could be construed as a random home video release.  So, from here on out &#8211; let&#8217;s just consider The Flashpoint Paradox and War to be like a brother/sister relationship.The plot of War is pretty self-explanatory:  the heroes go to war.  However, the original title of the story arc from the comic books is &#8220;Origin,&#8221; which begs the question, why did they change the title?  Well, for one &#8211; the only hero that really receives an origin story in this film is Cyborg.  Batman is already established, Green Lantern is established, and both Wonder Woman and Superman appear to be relatively new to the limelight, but they are also established.  The Flash, on the other hand, received such prominent billing in The Flashpoint Paradox that he seems like the only character that&#8217;s just along for the ride.  Shazam also appears in the story, but he&#8217;s far too similar to Superman to care about.Along with the revamped universe comes a list of new voice actors.  Anytime Batman stars in an animated feature, he&#8217;s always the one fans look at first &#8211; mostly because of the monumental voice work of Kevin Conroy in the role over the years.  However, Conroy is out and he gives way to newcomer Jason O&#8217;Mara (it probably should have been Roger Craig Smith from Batman: Arkham Origins), who does an adequate job &#8211; even though Batman is far too nice in this movie than he should be.  Apparently, we should get use to O&#8217;Mara since he will also voice Batman in DC&#8217;s next animated film, Son of Batman.Unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t any carry over actors from The Flashpoint Paradox &#8211; not even Justin Chambers who did a superb job as Flash (this time it&#8217;s Christopher Gorham).  In any event, with so many characters in the film and only so much time to properly introduce them, no one voice actor is really able to shine more than the others.  Chemistry is usually a big part of these characters, and although many of them interact &#8211; this film really misses the opportunity to provide prominent scenes between the notable relationships that will inevitably evolve for Superman/Batman and Green Lantern/Flash.  However, there is a nice big tease about the current romantic (in the comic series) relationship between Superman and Wonder Woman.Overall, Justice League: War is an extremely cluttered comic book feature.  Sure, there are plenty of enjoyable moments and the film is recommended for all comic book lovers.  At the same time, there&#8217;s a surprisingly high amount of bad language, so this film is not recommended for younger kids.  Another bothersome issue is the amount of time this film devotes to the violent battle sequences &#8211; while not spending nearly enough time establishing an unwavering bond between the Justice League members.  Perhaps it would have been better to introduce only a few of the superheroes, beginning with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and The Flash.  Cyborg and Shazam both tied into the story nicely, but the cast seemed to balloon too quickly for allotted runtime of this film.  A few of them could have easily popped up post-battle in the sequel, which is teased during the end credits &#8211; so be sure not to miss that scene.  All in all, War is an average animated flick, but pales in comparison to the old Justice League television show.GRADE:  CFNDNreview.com",3,"'War' cluttered with characters, still action-packed &

1677916,AUH9KPCAIL54Y,B00GD9GNEY,Frugal Shopper,"[0, 0]","The story follows the New 52 Justice League.  I read the comic when it first came out and found it to be entertaining.  It is more or less a reboot with the heroes meeting each other for the first time.  They band together to fight an invasion by Darkseid.  The development of the story itself was done well.  Each hero fought crime alone and did not appreciate the added value of teamwork until they were forced to when facing overwhelming odds.  However, the negatives out way the positives in this movie.  The prime example is the representation of some of the characters as immature brats, most notably Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.  Wonder Woman was especially annoying with her constant talk about being a warrior.  I've pretty much seen all the animation films of her character in the past 10 years and this is the worst by far, including the voice acting.  I also disliked the intentional incongruities of the story line to make for more dramatic effect.  Case in point, Cyborg has difficulty opening and closing boom tubes to make for a more thrilling battle with Darkseid.  Then at the end of the story, he has absolutely no problem opening them to take back human hostages.  My recommendation is to skip this movie and read the print version.  It is much better.

Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that I'm severely disappointed with this movie.  The story is good and there is no doubt about that.  It is the way the story is delivered is what gets to me.  The dialogue in the movie isn't that good.  It seems like some of the voice actors aren't into as much as they should be.  Superman and Green Lantern seemed off.  I don't know if they are going for the new 52 change to make the characters edgier or what but it isn't good.  The language.  Look I don't complain too much about foul language and I'm not trying to be a pain but this wasn't what you would expect from the Justice League.  I don't mind one or two light words here or there.  But this was a little over the top in my opinion and I completely feel like it could have been done with out it without taking away from the movie.  You certainly don't want young children watching this.  It isn't filled with it every other word but it is still more than what I would prefer.  I will not let my child watch it so he doesn't pick up words.  Even if the language wasn't bad I would only have given three stars.  The dialogue was just off between characters.  If you're a fan you still may want to watch it but don't get your hopes up.

Superman was a blank slate of personality and the story was rushed and full of character relation scenes a child could have written better. The way Batman unmasked himself in the middle of a battle to &#34;relate&#34; to Hal was just sad and played like a scene from an 80's cartoon at best. The stylized designs of the characters were based on the New 52 for sure but, unacceptable. I can force myself to accept the New 52 but, if this is the animated offering of it they should have not bothered.So many chances to set up the New 52 as something interesting.

Before I get into more insights, the bottom line is, regardless of your level of fanhood for the Justice League/DC Comics, you should minimally rent this just to be able to chime in with your take on this adaptation of many beloved characters in DC Comics-verse.  Maximally, you should rent (not buy) this because it is entertaining.  OK, now let's get into this some more, shall we?(1) The swearing.  Don't watch this with your kids because there are occasional swears -- i.e. ""whore,"" ""oh s***"" etc.  They're not plenty, but in an animated movie, they're peppered in enough to make you say, ""Whoa...""  Now, if you're an adult, I don't think the swearing is a bad thing.  Let's face it; if this was the ""real"" world, we'd be hearing much worse than this.  And I guess it's always fun to imagine, ""What if this was reality..."" because who doesn't like to think they're Superman (or Batman, or Wonder Woman, or...)?  So if you're an adult, let it go.  If you're watching with kids, shame on you!  :)  No, but, seriously, shame on you!(2) Character depiction/assassination.  A lot of reviews here comment on WW and Superman being one-dimensional.  And I would say that all those reviews are 110% correct.  It was so disingenuous to the characters that it literally made me cringe.  I understand the temptation -- perhaps the comedy -- of making Superman act like a football jock and WW behave like an airhead cheerleader, but c'mon.  How are you going to go with that in a movie that, while offers some comedic relief via Green Lantern, is still overall very serious?  This was the biggest fail of them all and made me think of rating it much lower.  Having said that...(3) The other characters.  The other characters were more connectable and interesting; they helped made the movie very enjoyable, therefore raising the stars on this rating.(4) Story.  Overall story worked with me.  I'm not a deep enough fan to know all the details behind the plot lines and whether it was flawed, decent, or spot on (I imagine somewhere in the middle); however, as someone who knows ""just enough,"" I still enjoyed the take on it.  I'm especially interested in the sequel to this movie, so they did a good job on that.Anyway, that's all I have time for right now.  Enjoy the movie and, to help shoulder the impact of Superman and WW's character, don't expect too much from those two characters.  The others were much better; I'm sure people could still find flaws in the other characters, but this is about the Justice League, so there's perhaps not much time to really delve into all the characters' stories.",3,War of the Fans' Reviews,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2757,"['interesting', 'read', 'perspectives', 'fans', 'reviews', 'section', 'namely', 'various', 'levels', 'people', 'love', 'universe', 'get', 'more', 'insights', 'bottom', 'line', 'regardless', 'level', 'fanhood', 'Justice', 'League/DC', 'Comics', 'should', 'minimally', 'rent', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'chime', 'take', 'adaptation', 'many', 'beloved', 'characters', 'DC', 'Comics-verse', 'Maximally', 'should', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'entertaining', 'OK', 'now', 'let', 'get', 'more', 'shall', '1', 'swearing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kids', 'are', 'occasional', 'swears', 'i.e', 'whore', 'oh', 's***', 'etc', ""'re"", 'not', 'plenty', 'animated', 'movie', ""'re"", 'peppered', 'enough', 'make', 'say', 'Whoa', 'Now', ""'re"", 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'swearing', 'bad', 'thing', 'Let', 'face', 'was', 'real', 'world', ""'d"", 'be', 'hearing', 'much', 'worse', 'guess', 'always', 'fun', 'imagine', 'What', 'was', 'reality', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', ""'re"", 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'So', ""'re"", 'adult', 'let', 'go', ""'re"", 'watching', 'kids', 'shame', 'No', 'seriously', 'shame', '2', 'Character', 'depiction/assassination', 'lot', 'reviews', 'here', 'comment', 'WW', 'Superman', 'being', 'one-dimensional', 'would', 'say', 'reviews', 'are', '110', '%', 'correct', 'was', 'so', 'disingenuous', 'characters', 'literally', 'made', 'cringe', 'understand', 'temptation', 'perhaps', 'comedy', 'making', 'Superman', 'act', 'football', 'jock', 'WW', 'behave', 'airhead', 'cheerleader', ""c'mon"", 'How', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'movie', 'offers', 'comedic', 'relief', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'still', 'overall', 'very', 'serious', 'was', 'biggest', 'fail', 'made', 'think', 'rating', 'much', 'lower', 'Having', 'said', '3', 'other', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'connectable', 'interesting', 'helped', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'therefore', 'raising', 'stars', 'rating', '4', 'Story', 'Overall', 'story', 'worked', ""'m"", 'not', 'deep', 'enough', 'fan', 'know', 'details', 'plot', 'lines', 'was', 'flawed', 'decent', 'spot', 'imagine', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'however', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'enough', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'take', ""'m"", 'especially', 'interested', 'sequel', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'that.Anyway', 'have', 'time', 'right', 'now', 'Enjoy', 'movie', 'help', 'shoulder', 'impact', 'Superman', 'WW', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'characters', 'others', 'were', 'much', 'better', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'could', 'still', 'find', 'flaws', 'other', 'characters', 'Justice', 'League', 'perhaps', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'really', 'delve', 'characters', 'stories']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)
1677926,A1J6IAENEKBLWV,B00GD9GNEY,Jacob G,"[3, 5]","I am a fan of the DCAU, and most of the newer stand alone DC animated films. I went into JLW knowing that they are pushing the New 52 and a reboot of sorts of the new Justice League. With that in mind, here are the good and bad points of what I consider to be the weakest DC animated film in a while.The Good:The Flash- He is, perhaps, the only likeable character out of the bunch. He's smart and funny and instantly someone you want to root for.Non-stop action - This film rarely lets off the gas pedal, from the opening scene to the end, it's go go go go. That's great and all, but it also leaves one glaring problem ....The Mediocre:Characterization- There is so very little done to build these guys and gal into real characters.The Batman- Talks like an automaton. I don't need Kevin Conroy, though I would prefer him, but give us something other than growling, deep voices. Batman has no personality, no dry humor, and just gets by. He's neither likeable nor annoying. He just ... is.Darkseid- No backstory, no motives, no personality. NOTHING. Just a deep robotic voice who stands there and fights. He's strong and seemingly impenetrable at first, then just gets his butt kicked.The Bad:Wonder Woman- Obnoxious, annoying, grating, however you want to say it. Sometimes she comes across as a petulant teenager, other times as a vicious %^&*). But she is never someone you care about. There is nothing noble or gracious about her. She's just pure warrior woman and boring as hell.Green Lantern- As Batman says, Green Lantern is just a douche bag. He's arrogant, cocky, and a total pussy. I could not stand him.Superman- If you're hoping for the All-American hero, Boy Scout, etc Superman you know and love, forget about it. This is killer, hit-first-ask-questions-later, smarmy, and stupid Superman. He does nothing that makes you care about him, has no personality other than total meathead.Shazam- Total jerk. Calls his friends &#34;morons.&#34; Not even really a &#34;good guy.&#34; He steals, lies, and is just a little punk.All in all, these New 52 Justice League heroes that WB Animation has assembled are a bunch of tools.

Paradox was MUCH better in my opinion.The characters were just too undeveloped and I didn't really like Wonder Woman in it at all. She used a sword the entire time minus 5 minutes that she remembered she's as strong as Superman, it was really disappointing. She was more of the ditz of the group that likes the &#34;jock&#34; (Supes). And it was so &#34;punch you in the face&#34; obvious. Yeah, I hated the pairing and I just wanted to unsee it all.Flash didn't get a lot of screen time which I also didn't like. And more of a fanboy when it came to Batman.Green Lantern was alright.

You'd have to be a complete idiot to mess him up. So, good job DC for keeping the character the same cause that's a no-brainer.Cyborg I actually enjoyed. He was the gem in this if you can believe that. I like his origin story in it. Although, he might come across as a whiney child with daddy issues.I like Captain Marvel, don't get me wrong. He's a great character. But I would have preferred Aquaman in this movie. CM was just too much of a puppy following Cy around and I just ended up wanting him to be knocked out and not show up til the end.Superman was much darker in this one, which to me wasn't bad.

1677938,A2NUNL9HBKEKDB,B00GD9GNEY,Johann K. Schmidt,"[0, 1]","I'll start off with the basics if you like DC comics then you'll like this movie.  That being said if you liked the Justice League comic issues that this movie is based off of be prepared to scratch your head at some of the changes they've made.  Definitely not their best work, probably treading closer to the bottom than the top on that scale.Animation wise it's fine.  I only saw two noticeable problems.  One was a couple of uses of really crappy CGI that look out of place and very cheap.  The second and more problematic is the scale of Darkseid.  What I mean is he seems to jump between being either 4 or 40 times bigger than the heroes.  It's really weird when it happens.  I'm not complain about him being a giant that's fine, it fits his character.  The other character designs are okay.  I liked the change to Wonder Woman, her outfit now looks like an actual uniform instead of a sexy Halloween costume.  They do a fun thing with Cyborg where his body slowly changes from a rough metal blob to a sleek design by the end.  Everyone else looks like you would expect.Story wise you can already tell one change from the cover, Aquaman is out Shazam is in.  To sum it up quickly the movie would have worked better if they had dropped Aquaman and replaced him with nothing.  Shazam is useless, his big scene is charging up Cyborgs batteries that's it.  Flash doesn't get to fight Superman which was disappointing because the scene in the comic when Superman actual hits him is priceless.  Flash just can't comprehend that anyone could move as fast as him.  Wonder Woman gets a new prolonged scene where she saves the President.  It also involves a huge continuity error.  The President somehow jumps from the White House where Wonder Woman just confirmed he was and seconds later is swarming with demons, with Wonder Woman literately standing on the street outside, to being on Air Force One.  Yet somehow Wonder Woman still hasn't met him until she saves him on the plane?  How the heck did he get out of the White House without her help?  We know the Secret Service guys are useless from the plane fight.  There also seems to be a scene missing from Batman saving superman on Apocalypse.  When Superman comes back he's wearing, and throws away, some weird armor breast plate and Batman has avoided getting killed by Hulking out Superman.  Oh and also Superman kills someone.  He's under mind control or whatever.  It seemed like a scene demanded by DC HQ to sync up the animated Superman with his live action counterpart.  The scene has no weight or meaning and is completely forgotten by the next scene.  The rest of the story is the same as the comic so I just confused as to why they changed anything when none of these changes made it any better or significantly different.Voice acting is okay not great.  We've heard better voices for all of the characters even Darkseid who says I think a total of four lines.  The actual dialogue is more or less what is in the comic.  Basically lots of short quips and let's go get 'em guys.  Nothing memorable or deep.To sum it up the movie suffers greatly from there being way to many characters and far too little time.  The comic suffered from this problem as well but it could get away with it because you could always buy one of the hero specific stand alone comics to go along with it.  The movie however has to stand on its own, the only crutch it has is the action sequences.  Everything else is C grade at best.I'm sounding pretty hard in this review so to be clear.  I don't hate this movie nor am I mad that I spent money on it.  i had a straight up okay time watching it.

1677939,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00GD9GNEY,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[11, 16]","In this latest offering from DCU, here's an origin story on the birth of the Justice League.  Alien creatures are showing up all across the USA, kidnapping scores of people and leaving mysterious devices in their wake.  Green Lantern tackles one of the creatures in Gotham and meets up with an urban legend called The Batman.  Their journey takes them to Metropolis to tangle with you-know-who.  Flash already brought one of the devices to S.T.A.R. Labs and is collaborating with Dr. Silas Stone (Victor's father) to unlock it.  These devices are broadcasting a signal... somewhere, to someone... and it's only a matter of time before this someone arrives.What's Good:Based upon the latest Justice League Origin story by Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and Scott Williams, it's a far better tale than the classic comic featuring Starro and a good way to introduce one of the all-time comic book villains- Darkseid.  Victor's metamorphosis into Cyborg is a good change of pace, as well as being the key to the storyline.  Good voice acting cast with the likes of Sean Astin (Shazam), Shemar Moore (Cyborg), Rocky Carroll (Dr. Stone), Michelle Monaghan (Wonder Woman), Steve Blum (Darkseid),  Alan Tudyk (Superman) and Jason O'Mara (Batman).  Rounding out the cast are Ioan Gruffudd and long time fan fave George Newbern.  And ya gotta love the little references at the end during the President's speech... one you know was coming (hint, hint) and one you won't. lol  Plus in good ol' Marvel movie style, make sure you check out the teaser during the credits.What's Bad:Even though it's pretty much standard now, I'm still not a fan of this Korean style of animation.  Just has never worked for me; at the risk of showing my age, it's just too chintzy.  No heart to it at all- all style and no substance.  And I haven't kept up on comics lately so maybe I've missed a few things but the characterizations were pretty odd.  GL came off like Flash used to: cocky, headstrong and full of himself.  Batman was way too eager to offer up a few personal details to GL after going head to toe with each other.  Billy Batson's life as an adopted child is barely touched upon and only exists to set up a sub-plot between him and Cyborg.  And as a stock character pointed out, they're all far too eager to engage in wholescale property damage without a second thought.What's Left:Wonder Woman's appearances are largely relegated to some form of comic relief, but eventually get straightened out.  Everyone's initial encounters come off as juvenile regardless of being dictated by the necessity of the situation.  And the final solution on how to send Darkseid back to Apokolips was right in front of their faces all along; no reason to take an hour to get to it.  Writer Heath Corson dropped the ball on this one; again- style over substance.Overall, Justice League: War is an ok flick.  Just one more in the line of DC anime features to whet your appetite until the next one comes along.",3,Apokolips Not So Much,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2964,"['latest', 'offering', 'DCU', 'here', 'origin', 'story', 'birth', 'Justice', 'League', 'Alien', 'creatures', 'are', 'showing', 'up', 'USA', 'kidnapping', 'scores', 'people', 'leaving', 'mysterious', 'devices', 'wake', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'one', 'creatures', 'Gotham', 'up', 'urban', 'legend', 'called', 'Batman', 'journey', 'Metropolis', 'tangle', 'you-know-who', 'Flash', 'already', 'brought', 'one', 'devices', 'S.T.A.R', 'Labs', 'collaborating', 'Dr.', 'Silas', 'Stone', 'Victor', 'father', 'unlock', 'devices', 'are', 'broadcasting', 'signal', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'someone', 'arrives.What', 'Good', 'Based', 'latest', 'Justice', 'League', 'Origin', 'story', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'Williams', 'far', 'better', 'tale', 'classic', 'comic', 'featuring', 'Starro', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'one', 'all-time', 'comic', 'book', 'villains-', 'Darkseid', 'Victor', 'metamorphosis', 'Cyborg', 'good', 'change', 'pace', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'key', 'storyline', 'Good', 'voice', 'acting', 'cast', 'likes', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Shazam', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'Cyborg', 'Rocky', 'Carroll', 'Dr.', 'Stone', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Steve', 'Blum', 'Darkseid', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Superman', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'Batman', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'fave', 'George', 'Newbern', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'little', 'references', 'end', 'President', 'speech', 'one', 'know', 'was', 'coming', 'hint', 'hint', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lol', 'good', 'ol', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'style', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'teaser', 'credits.What', 'Bad', 'Even', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'now', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'fan', 'Korean', 'style', 'animation', 'Just', 'never', 'worked', 'risk', 'showing', 'age', 'just', 'too', 'chintzy', 'heart', 'all-', 'style', 'substance', 'have', ""n't"", 'kept', 'up', 'comics', 'lately', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'few', 'things', 'characterizations', 'were', 'pretty', 'odd', 'GL', 'came', 'off', 'Flash', 'used', 'cocky', 'headstrong', 'full', 'Batman', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'eager', 'offer', 'up', 'few', 'personal', 'details', 'GL', 'going', 'head', 'toe', 'other', 'Billy', 'Batson', 'life', 'adopted', 'child', 'barely', 'touched', 'upon', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'sub-plot', 'Cyborg', 'stock', 'character', 'pointed', 'out', ""'re"", 'far', 'too', 'eager', 'engage', 'wholescale', 'property', 'damage', 'second', 'thought.What', 'Left', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'appearances', 'are', 'largely', 'relegated', 'form', 'comic', 'relief', 'eventually', 'get', 'straightened', 'out', 'Everyone', 'initial', 'encounters', 'come', 'off', 'juvenile', 'regardless', 'being', 'dictated', 'necessity', 'situation', 'final', 'solution', 'how', 'send', 'Darkseid', 'back', 'Apokolips', 'was', 'right', 'front', 'all', 'along', 'reason', 'take', 'hour', 'get', 'Writer', 'Heath', 'Corson', 'dropped', 'ball', 'one', 'again-', 'style', 'substance.Overall', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', 'ok', 'flick', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'line', 'DC', 'anime', 'features', 'whet', 'appetite', 'next', 'one', 'along']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

Darkseid is a bonafide super villain that alone none of the heroes could beat but only as a league do they stand a chance.I'm a big Superman and Wonder Woman fan. Superman's personality seems more &#34; realistic&#34; for a godlike creature in that he is goodnatured but confident and detached. It is clear that he is the most powerful hero--period. What I'm most impressed with is how Wonder Woman is clearly Superman's equal in this universe -- and they both magnetically know that they are equals. She is the unexpected &#34;big gun&#34; that even Darkseid found surprisingly amusing in at least a couple of scenes. We have only seen Darkseid vs Superman in the past. This movie satisfies the curiosity about how Wonder Woman would fare against Darkseid as a DC character that is not a dismally underpowered version of herself as seen the Justice League Season 2 and beyond. Or the disastrous treatment she got in JL Doom, for  which I abhorrently refused to pay. With the unapologetic badass makeover that she got in the Flashpoint Paradox, I expected her to continue as a true powerhouse and this movie delivered! Well done DC!

She is a one dimensional warrior out of her element who seems like she is only looking for a fight. Superman also seems quite stiff, but not as much as Wonder Woman. Originally Diana was one of the wisest of the Amazons in addition to being a great warrior.  The new 52 characterization has really dumbed her down and made her all brawn with mediocre intellect.  I'm surprised women aren't deeply offended by the new direction DC has taken her.  And I still immensely dislike the new lackluster & no longer patriotic costume.I thought all the other super hero portrayals were acceptable and the voice overs were very well done.

Well, fast forward to 2014, and even at the age of 39, I still love the fact the little boy inside of me still knows how to enjoy his cartoons. My wife sometimes gets a little annoyed when I call her my girl, but she still has that girlish quality that seemingly lasts a lifetime & ensures that I will not get tired of her, because I do not need her to be adult, all the time. Not immature, just able to enjoy the love letters I still write to her so she still melts inside & melts me with her smile. &#34;Will you go with me?&#34; Check yes or no. Y'all understand, right? Anywho, DC's Justice League: War is time and money well spent. I am not sure if this follows the original mythos of how these characters met, but if not (and I am surprised I do not know this) it is still worthy of your viewing. There has been much talk about Cyborg being included instead of Aquaman, and that conversation is quieted, just be sure to stay tuned as the credits roll. The animation is some of the best I've seen in a while, and the storyline is on point. Superman seems to be much more arrogant that I have ever heard or seen from him, but it does not last long. And was Wonder Woman ever enamored with Kal-El in the past? She is now, which seems to point to their current connection in the comic book featuring them both. DC did a tremendous job bringing forth the conflict that would form them together, but how this will play out with the addition of Aquaman (you know this HAS to happen) is not 'totally' clear.

I have to admit, I was skeptical and ready to cancel my pre-order if it did not live up to my expectations, after all with misses like Gotham Knight and Superman/Shazam The Return of Black Adam to name a few, DC has had misses here and there with their animated movies. But Justice League War is THEE BEST ANIMATED SUPER HERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME! It has lots of actions, well placed comedy, TONS of action (pretty brutal and graphic - Wonder Wowan was a beast) and character interaction and development for its constricted time frame.Yes, they switched out Aquaman for Shazam but without giving anything away, at the end of the movie you will see why they did that and how it plays an intrical role in the ...let's say franchise ;)There was a Q&A; after and they said the blu ray is loaded with behind the scene stuff including a sneak peak at Son of Batman. All in all, if you are a fan of any of these characters, like the New 52, or even just want a great animated action flick, this is a must own.Just a side note, if you are going to watch this with any young kids, there is some strong language in it.

1677963,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B00GD9GNEY,Luminus,"[2, 6]","(I really liked the movie.  That's my edit to make it clear to those who can't realize that from the title.  Also, there are some spoilers ahead.)DC is pretty much the grand master when it comes to animated comicbook movies.  As of late, they've started to take a curve toward a more mature tone (upping the violence, mild sexual inuendo, foul language -- that sort of thing) and this one is no different.  There's even a small scene demonstrating a potentially dysfunctional family, when Batman is smashed against a couple windows as a toddler watches.  The way he gets blamed for it is very familiar and ugly and is the kind of sutble adult themes DC adds to their animated movies that's just the icing on the cake.In a nutshell, following on from the alternate universe (New 52) created by the previous movie, Flashpoint: Paradox, Darkseid's Parademons have infiltrated the earth and begun planting mother boxes so that they can open more boom tubes for the rest of the army in addition to preparing the earth for terraforming.Batman and Green Lantern:The banter between these two has been done very well, from the first meeting and Lantern's subsequent surprise that Batman is real to the way Batman just assumes control even though he's incredibly underpowered compared to both the villains and the heroes.  I also love how Batman's detective skills are put on display as he name drops several alter egos of the Justice League members to their obvious surprise.The Flash and Cyborg:Unfortunately, the Flash doesn't get much to do here.  We're shown a glimpse into his life in the police department and then he's in action as the Flash in an altercation involving Cyborg.  Speaking of which, Victor Stone's story arc here is very impressive.  I've never cared too much for Cyborg.  Quite frankly, he just seemed to be a tacked on member of the Justice League.  However, here we get some meaty character development with his issues with his father, the horrific accident (which they actually show) that leads to the operation which makes him Cyborg, and the eventual father/son friction resolution.  I'm still not sold on the outfit, though.Captain Marvel a.k.a Shazam:Okay, this was a weird inclusion/substitution (Aquaman is missing for some reason), in my opinion.  With Shazam on the team, I felt like the JL basically had 2 Supermen and thus would better be named the Unstoppable League.  Really, the team is so incredibly overpowered in this movie it's a wonder there was even a challenge to begin with.  I'm not very familiar with Shazam other than the few times I've seen him on film, but the portrayal of the character didn't seem at all out of place or annoying.Darkseid:I absolutely love what they've done with Darkseid.  He's much bigger than he used to be and (YES!) he's got that scary, growling voice again as he should have.Superman:I'm not entirely comfortable with this version of Superman.  He doesn't feel like the authority figure that I know Superman to be.  This one seems more rough, for lack of a better word.  What I do like about him is the no-nonsense fight he has with Green Lantern and Batman.  This Batman vs. Superman fight is EXACTLY how it would go down.  Period.  It was a pleasure to finally see that.  Some will mention the lack of Kryptonite, but Lex Luthor has access to Kryptonite and I think he's actually smarter than Batman and yet he STILL can't beat Superman.Now to the cons, because there always are (some mild spoilers):Wonder Woman:Sigh.  What happened?  This version of the character is easily the worst I have ever seen, which is disappointing coming off of the spectacular Wonder Woman animated movie DC released.  The entire scene with the ice cream and the little girl was so incredibly cringe worthy and ridiculous, I wanted to smack someone just for the heck of it.  Just stop, whoever you are who thought this was cute.  Just... stop.  Wonder Woman gets called a word (rhymes with bore and happens at least twice) and doesn't open up a can of whoop-you-know-what on the moron who said it is just more flame to the fire.  The incident is a sort of tongue in cheek moment (it involves cross dressing) that the producers probably thought was funny, but it's just one more nail in the coffin for the character in my opinion.  I know it's just a guy and she can't just smash his head in, but come on.  Up until this point, we've seen the men on the team do their thing with all seriousness and when we get to the only woman on the team, it's ice cream is yummy and my ""outfit makes me feel strong, too!""  Ugh.  Also, her amazonian warrior talk is way over the top.  I just couldn't take her seriously.Darkseid:Although Darkseid is incredibly powerful here, he gets horrifically maimed in a way that I just don't get.  I mean, if it's that easy to maim him, why is it so hard to just have Green Lantern shoot him dead?  At first, I thought it might have something to do with Wonder Woman's sword, but then the Flash does something non-powered and has no problem.  It's inconsistent.Captain Marvel a.k.a Shazam:Correct me if I'm wrong, but the word ""Shazam"" is the magical word used to change between Captain Marvel and Billy Bastion.  When Captain Marvel introduces himself to the team, he calls himself ""Shazam,"" but doesn't change back to Billy.  Also, is Shazam stronger than Superman?  There's an incident where Darkseid shoots Superman with his Omega Beams and knocks him out, but when Shazam is hit with it, he's up in no time.Batman and the Flash:There's a quick scene of Batman getting punched by Darkseid and he survives it.  This happens with the Flash as well.  Yeah, that's not happening.Before I go, I just want to clear something up from the movie that I've seen someone complain about.  This is a big spoiler, so turn away now if you don't want to know...When Batman rescues Superman on War World, Superman grabs his captor and strangles the life out of him.  Now, this might seem to be a new theme going on with Superman - what, with the events of Man of Steel and all - but it's actually not normal Superman.  He's been altered into a Parademon, but the process hasn't had a chance to be completed as he proceeds to try to kill Batman immediately after.Oh, and stick around for the mid-credit scene.",5,DC

1677969,AFJ27ZV9183B8,B00GD9GNEY,Michael A. Martin,"[0, 0]","I just saw this yesterday when it arrived from Netflix.  Since I completely panned Flashpoint Paradox, I thought it was only fair to give a review on this one, which I found to be a much more enjoyable movie than the last one.  There was a time in my life when I read a lot of comic books, but that has not happened in the last twenty five years. So most of the new developments in either Marvel or DC is something I look up in Wikipedia when I feel like doing so, as I feel that these movies should be judged on their standalone merit.First of all, the animation was different and also about a dozen times better than their last effort at a Justice League movie.  It was almost as good as the Young Justice TV series, which I consider to have the best, most realistic animation of any animated superheroes program I've ever seen.  Before I proceed, there will be some spoilers in this review, so you are warned.  According to other reviews, this is taken from the first few issues of their rebooted JLA series.  I also realize that you can't tell everything in an 80 minute movie, so that's not a problem.  The movie moved along acceptably and there were no blaring gaps in the movie as it was presented.  My main gripes with the movie are the way some of these characters are presented.  I felt that Batman, Flash, and Cyborg were portrayed acceptably (I reiterate that it is nice to see the Flash portrayed like a responsible adult). I also thought that the character development with Cyborg was particularly well done.  I also feel that Green Lantern was portrayed like far more of an arrogant punk then he should have been.  Can someone please explain how an angry little stealing brat like Billy Batson (as portrayed) could become Captain Marvel?  That makes no sense to me at all, and it makes his character somewhat unbelievable in this presentation.Now we come to the nitty gritty; Superman and Wonder Woman.  The blue boy scout is obviously the most iconic superhero in the world but as presented his character flaws were quite startling.  The so called fight between Superman and Batman & Green Lantern was probably more accurate than anything else presented before, providing you are dealing with a Superman with no compunction about hurting people weaker than himself.  The most unbelievable part to me is why Batman, who always knows everyone else inside out, did not have some kryptonite insurance to stop Superman if need be.  I agree with other reviewers that a partial loss of innocence in the big guy is probably not such a bad idea, but it seemed too much here.  As for Wonder Woman, frankly, I am starting to wonder if some person(s) on the production staff don't have domestic issues, considering how she has been presented in the last two JL movies.  She behaved like a spoiled arrogant over the top feminist brat from start to finish, and for someone who is supposedly millennia old, this is not a compliment to her character, although I found the ice cream scene hysterical. She behaved a bit too macho most of the time (although I freely admit Captain Marvel really had it coming).  Another thing is that her constant use of the sword and more importantly the emphasis on blinding Darkseid, while admittedly tactically wise, was a bit much for a movie which, again, will be seen by mostly kids, so frankly I think parents should use some caution in letting kids of a certain age watch this movie.All in all, it was a serious step up in the quality of DC's animated movies.  It is to be hoped that if any other JLA movies are made, less friction, profanity, and gore, and more character interaction, improvements in animation and voice selection will make these movies more enjoyable that some of the latest ones.  I felt that this was a movie that I would enjoy watching again, and I do recommend it, although caution should be used with respect to young viewers and certain scenes in the movie.",4,Much better effort than the last one.,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3921,"['just', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'when', 'arrived', 'Netflix', 'completely', 'panned', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'fair', 'give', 'review', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'read', 'lot', 'comic', 'books', 'not', 'happened', 'last', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'So', 'most', 'new', 'developments', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'something', 'look', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'when', 'feel', 'doing', 'so', 'feel', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'standalone', 'merit.First', 'animation', 'was', 'different', 'also', 'dozen', 'times', 'better', 'last', 'effort', 'Justice', 'League', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Young', 'Justice', 'TV', 'series', 'consider', 'have', 'best', 'most', 'realistic', 'animation', 'animated', 'superheroes', 'program', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'proceed', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers', 'review', 'are', 'warned', 'According', 'other', 'reviews', 'taken', 'first', 'few', 'issues', 'rebooted', 'JLA', 'series', 'also', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everything', '80', 'minute', 'movie', 'not', 'problem', 'movie', 'moved', 'along', 'acceptably', 'were', 'blaring', 'gaps', 'movie', 'was', 'presented', 'main', 'gripes', 'movie', 'are', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'felt', 'Batman', 'Flash', 'Cyborg', 'were', 'portrayed', 'acceptably', 'reiterate', 'nice', 'see', 'Flash', 'portrayed', 'responsible', 'adult', 'also', 'thought', 'character', 'development', 'Cyborg', 'was', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'feel', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'was', 'portrayed', 'far', 'more', 'arrogant', 'punk', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Can', 'someone', 'please', 'explain', 'how', 'angry', 'little', 'stealing', 'brat', 'Billy', 'Batson', 'portrayed', 'could', 'become', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'sense', 'character', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'presentation.Now', 'come', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'blue', 'boy', 'scout', 'obviously', 'most', 'iconic', 'superhero', 'world', 'presented', 'character', 'flaws', 'were', 'quite', 'startling', 'so', 'called', 'fight', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'accurate', 'anything', 'else', 'presented', 'providing', 'are', 'dealing', 'Superman', 'compunction', 'hurting', 'people', 'weaker', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'why', 'Batman', 'who', 'always', 'everyone', 'else', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'kryptonite', 'insurance', 'stop', 'Superman', 'need', 'be', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'partial', 'loss', 'innocence', 'big', 'guy', 'probably', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'idea', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'frankly', 'am', 'starting', 'wonder', 'person', 'production', 'staff', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'domestic', 'issues', 'considering', 'how', 'been', 'presented', 'last', 'two', 'JL', 'movies', 'behaved', 'spoiled', 'arrogant', 'top', 'feminist', 'brat', 'start', 'finish', 'someone', 'who', 'supposedly', 'millennia', 'old', 'not', 'compliment', 'character', 'found', 'ice', 'cream', 'scene', 'hysterical', 'behaved', 'bit', 'too', 'macho', 'most', 'time', 'freely', 'admit', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'really', 'had', 'coming', 'thing', 'constant', 'use', 'sword', 'more', 'importantly', 'emphasis', 'blinding', 'Darkseid', 'admittedly', 'tactically', 'wise', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'movie', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'mostly', 'kids', 'frankly', 'think', 'parents', 'should', 'use', 'caution', 'letting', 'kids', 'certain', 'age', 'watch', 'movie.All', 'was', 'serious', 'step', 'up', 'quality', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'be', 'hoped', 'other', 'JLA', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'less', 'friction', 'profanity', 'gore', 'more', 'character', 'interaction', 'improvements', 'animation', 'voice', 'selection', 'will', 'make', 'movies', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'latest', 'ones', 'felt', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again', 'do', 'recommend', 'caution', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'respect', 'young', 'viewers', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

The creators went back in time, a retelling of their origin I suppose, where the heroes don&#8217;t really know each other, producing natural conflict between them all. The art is great, their new costume designs are fresh and pristine. Even Wonder Woman&#8217;s new / old costume manages to cover her up a little while maintaining that Amazonian heat that has kept her around for 70 years as a character. Overall, this feels like a subtle, yet powerful reboot of the whole Justice League franchise. Looking forward to future stories with this art and even these new voices. Plug the Joker into this and it could be epic.The Justice League characters are far superior to any other group of superheroes: X-Men, Avengers, whoever. I absolutely love Wonder Woman&#8217;s Amazonian toughness and old time goddess mentality here, mixed with her naivite for modern American culture.

1677975,A1Z1ZP2QPD9D3L,B00GD9GNEY,Movie Gal With a Brain,"[20, 27]","For the casual moviegoer, the DC Universe Original Movie ""Justice League: War"" is simply an uneven and ultimately wasted 79 minute running time. For longtime fans of the previously titled DC Universe Animated Original Movies, it's a heartbreaker.Skilled action and dramatic director Jay Oliva does his best with a screenplay by Heath Corson that is solid, although dialogue and characterizations could have used a second pass. Both are undermined by this being the most miss-cast film in the DCUOM history. Even legendary Voice Director Andrea Romano can't squeeze the right emotional performances out of this cast at virtually any moment, crucially the critical ones.Returning composer Kevin Klieisch (""Superman Unbound"") delivers another 'low-budget, overtly synth sounding' score that has fans longing for the DCUOM days of the master Christopher Drake, along with past composers Kevin Manthei, Robert J. Kral, and James L. Venable. Why Frederick Wiedmann, who nailed DCUOM's previous release ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"" with a sound that was both organic and fresh was NOT brought back to score this new film is a travesty.The plot is a relatively straightforward, and at times improved, adaptation of Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and Scott William's first 6 issues of DC Comic's The New 52 title 'Justice League,' giving audiences a Joss Whedon 'Avengers' origin take on the classic 'Justice League' story. It's the first team-up for Superman, Batman, Wonder-Woman, the Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.For the film, writer Corson swaps out Aquaman for Shazam. Believe it or not, it's a wise move.  Shazam is played by Oscar nominee, SAG winner, and LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy star Sean Astin.He seems to be the only one having fun and perfectly cast in his role. Christopher Gorham (TV's 'Covert Affairs') is a passable Barry Allen/The Flash, while Michele Monaghan's part as Wonder Woman is so poorly developed, you can't really fault her for playing the role as written and directed. Justin Kirk of TV's 'Modern Family' appears to be playing Hal Jordan/Green Lantern as an over-the-top arrogant 'Plastic Man Green Lantern,' but he fails to find humanity nor any humility in his performance. Ditto Alan Tudyk of TV's 'Suburgatory' and 'Arrested Development' as Superman. Rarely has the Man of Steel been annoyingly, and disturbingly, arrogant, aggressive, violent and unintelligent.Shemar Moore does shine as Cyborg, and the subplot involving his relationship with his father is one of the best aspects of the film. Finally, there's DCUOM's new Dark Knight - Jason O'More, of TV's 'Terra Nova' and last season's 'The Good Wife.' He has his moments, but he mostly reaffirms Kevin Conroy and Bruce Greenwood's performance dominance of the role in animation from 1992 - 2014.And this very reasonably budgeted voice cast is the key to what makes this film fail. If we don't buy the vocal part of an animated performance, not even a master like Jay Oliva delivering his trademark phenomenal visuals can sell the emotional core of the story. And the cutting of pennies in dropping seasoned composers like Christopher Drake means scores in which synth effects were intentional, but absent when orchestral strings, brass and woodwinds were meant to be heard, are now at times replaced with Kliesch's obvious Saturday morning/ 90s afterschool synth strings and obviously electronic orchestral arrangements.Up until Bruce Timm's departure, the DCUOMs were - more often then not - sophisticated, adult fare, with HIGH caliber acting talent to match the incredible animation, music and sound effects. Since his departure, I think it's safe to say the days of hearing an Emmy and SAG winner like Bryan Cranston play a Jim Gordon; a Kevin Conroy, Bruce Greenwood or Peter Weller play Batman, or an Oscar nominee such as James Woods play a key villain like Owl Man are over.If this is what passes for 'epic' now in the world of DC Universe Original Movies, the end of the entire line may be near.",2,"""Justice League: War"": The End is Near - For DCUOMs?",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,4000,"['casual', 'moviegoer', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Justice', 'League', 'War', 'simply', 'uneven', 'ultimately', 'wasted', '79', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'longtime', 'fans', 'previously', 'titled', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Animated', 'Original', 'Movies', 'heartbreaker.Skilled', 'action', 'dramatic', 'director', 'Jay', 'Oliva', 'best', 'screenplay', 'Heath', 'Corson', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'characterizations', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'second', 'pass', 'are', 'undermined', 'being', 'most', 'miss-cast', 'film', 'DCUOM', 'history', 'Even', 'legendary', 'Voice', 'Director', 'Andrea', 'Romano', 'ca', ""n't"", 'squeeze', 'right', 'emotional', 'performances', 'cast', 'virtually', 'moment', 'crucially', 'critical', 'ones.Returning', 'composer', 'Kevin', 'Klieisch', 'Superman', 'Unbound', ""'low-budget"", 'overtly', 'synth', 'sounding', 'score', 'fans', 'longing', 'DCUOM', 'days', 'master', 'Christopher', 'Drake', 'past', 'composers', 'Kevin', 'Manthei', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Kral', 'James', 'L.', 'Venable', 'Why', 'Frederick', 'Wiedmann', 'who', 'nailed', 'DCUOM', 'previous', 'release', 'Justice', 'League', 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'sound', 'was', 'organic', 'fresh', 'was', 'NOT', 'brought', 'back', 'score', 'new', 'film', 'travesty.The', 'plot', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'times', 'improved', 'adaptation', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'William', 'first', '6', 'issues', 'DC', 'Comic', 'New', '52', 'title', ""'Justice"", 'League', 'giving', 'audiences', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""'Avengers"", 'origin', 'take', 'classic', ""'Justice"", 'League', 'story', 'first', 'team-up', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Wonder-Woman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Flash', 'Aquaman', 'Cyborg.For', 'film', 'writer', 'Corson', 'out', 'Aquaman', 'Shazam', 'Believe', 'not', 'wise', 'move', 'Shazam', 'played', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'SAG', 'winner', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'Trilogy', 'star', 'Sean', 'Astin.He', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'having', 'fun', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'Christopher', 'Gorham', 'TV', ""'Covert"", 'Affairs', 'passable', 'Barry', 'Allen/The', 'Flash', 'Michele', 'Monaghan', 'part', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'playing', 'role', 'written', 'directed', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'TV', ""'Modern"", 'Family', 'be', 'playing', 'Hal', 'Jordan/Green', 'Lantern', 'over-the-top', 'arrogant', ""'Plastic"", 'Man', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'find', 'humanity', 'humility', 'performance', 'Ditto', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'TV', ""'Suburgatory"", ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'Superman', 'Rarely', 'Man', 'Steel', 'been', 'annoyingly', 'disturbingly', 'arrogant', 'aggressive', 'violent', 'unintelligent.Shemar', 'Moore', 'shine', 'Cyborg', 'subplot', 'involving', 'relationship', 'father', 'one', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'Finally', 'DCUOM', 'new', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Jason', ""O'More"", 'TV', ""'Terra"", 'Nova', 'last', 'season', 'Good', 'Wife', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'performance', 'dominance', 'role', 'animation', '1992', '2014.And', 'very', 'reasonably', 'budgeted', 'voice', 'cast', 'key', 'what', 'film', 'fail', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'vocal', 'part', 'animated', 'performance', 'not', 'even', 'master', 'Jay', 'Oliva', 'delivering', 'trademark', 'phenomenal', 'visuals', 'can', 'sell', 'emotional', 'core', 'story', 'cutting', 'pennies', 'dropping', 'seasoned', 'composers', 'Christopher', 'Drake', 'scores', 'synth', 'effects', 'were', 'intentional', 'absent', 'when', 'orchestral', 'strings', 'brass', 'woodwinds', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'heard', 'are', 'now', 'times', 'replaced', 'Kliesch', 'obvious', 'Saturday', 'morning/', '90s', 'afterschool', 'synth', 'strings', 'obviously', 'electronic', 'orchestral', 'arrangements.Up', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'departure', 'DCUOMs', 'were', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'adult', 'fare', 'HIGH', 'caliber', 'acting', 'talent', 'match', 'incredible', 'animation', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'departure', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'days', 'hearing', 'Emmy', 'SAG', 'winner', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'play', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'play', 'Batman', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'such', 'James', 'Woods', 'play', 'key', 'villain', 'Owl', 'Man', 'are', 'over.If', 'passes', ""'epic"", 'now', 'world', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Original', 'Movies', 'end', 'entire', 'line', 'may', 'be']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

1677978,A3RN5W5IWPMKHD,B00GD9GNEY,Nathaniel Wayne,"[2, 2]","As a massive fan of DC animated films this one leaves me deeply divided. What it does well, it does extremely well. However what it does poorly results in some moments that are both painful and boring. It'd be easier to let the faults go if this wasn't the start of a new DCAU (DC Animated Universe) continuity.Starting with the positives: the action scenes are well planned an executed. They're exciting to watch and well paced. Given that most of the combat is against the somewhat generic and identical parademons, it's high praise that it doesn't leave you burned out by the end. Most of the voice cast works very well, and the characterizations of most of the characters is familiar while being just slightly different from what most fans have seen on screen so far. Shazam is a surprise highlight in this regard.However, while most of the characters work very well there are two glaring exceptions. The first is the villain Darkseid. While the film does a good job of showing his raw power, he comes off as extremely generic. There's none of the mastermind scheming that makes him more than just a big brute, and for this reason he could just as easily have been swapped out for any number of other hulking baddies. His dialog is also generic supervillain drivel, not that it matters because mostly he only grunts and shouts.The film also shares the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; film's disregard for collateral damage. While it's fair that plenty of buildings were going to be obliterated in this conflict, none of the heroes seem to have any concern about this happening. This means that fans of Superman who were irritated by his apparent apathy at the lives put in danger by his fighting in a city will have the same criticism here.The biggest offense however is Wonder Woman. She is very poorly written, given nave and grating dialog throughout. It's probably meant to be funny but it just never plays as anything other than irritating. The overly enthusiastic performance of Michelle Monaghan makes it even worse. She exudes none of the stoic strength that made so many of the previous animated takes on the character so powerful. And hinting at an almost immediate attraction to Superman only serves to cheapen her further.There's plenty that works here, with stellar action and most of the characters having good chemistry (I could watch Green Lantern and Batman bicker all day long.) However the things that aren't working aren't just minor nitpicks, they're fundamental flaws. And some of them are ones we're going to be stuck with for future DCAU releases, which for the first time ever removes my excitement at future adventures of Wonder Woman.",3,Super Only in Parts,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2656,"['massive', 'fan', 'DC', 'animated', 'films', 'one', 'deeply', 'divided', 'What', 'well', 'extremely', 'well', 'However', 'what', 'poorly', 'results', 'moments', 'are', 'painful', 'boring', ""'d"", 'be', 'easier', 'let', 'faults', 'go', 'was', ""n't"", 'start', 'new', 'DCAU', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'continuity.Starting', 'positives', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'planned', 'executed', ""'re"", 'exciting', 'watch', 'well', 'paced', 'Given', 'most', 'combat', 'somewhat', 'generic', 'identical', 'parademons', 'high', 'praise', ""n't"", 'leave', 'burned', 'out', 'end', 'Most', 'voice', 'cast', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'characterizations', 'most', 'characters', 'familiar', 'being', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'what', 'most', 'fans', 'have', 'seen', 'screen', 'so', 'far', 'Shazam', 'surprise', 'highlight', 'regard.However', 'most', 'characters', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'two', 'glaring', 'exceptions', 'first', 'villain', 'Darkseid', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'raw', 'power', 'off', 'extremely', 'generic', 'none', 'mastermind', 'scheming', 'more', 'just', 'big', 'brute', 'reason', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'swapped', 'out', 'number', 'other', 'hulking', 'baddies', 'dialog', 'also', 'generic', 'supervillain', 'drivel', 'not', 'because', 'mostly', 'only', 'grunts', 'shouts.The', 'film', 'also', 'shares', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'film', 'disregard', 'collateral', 'damage', 'fair', 'plenty', 'buildings', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'obliterated', 'conflict', 'none', 'heroes', 'seem', 'have', 'concern', 'happening', 'fans', 'Superman', 'who', 'were', 'irritated', 'apparent', 'apathy', 'lives', 'put', 'danger', 'fighting', 'city', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'criticism', 'here.The', 'biggest', 'offense', 'however', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'given', 'nave', 'grating', 'dialog', 'probably', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'never', 'anything', 'other', 'irritating', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'even', 'worse', 'none', 'stoic', 'strength', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'animated', 'character', 'so', 'powerful', 'hinting', 'almost', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'Superman', 'only', 'cheapen', 'further.There', 'plenty', 'here', 'stellar', 'action', 'most', 'characters', 'having', 'good', 'chemistry', 'could', 'watch', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Batman', 'bicker', 'day', 'long', 'However', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'working', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'minor', 'nitpicks', ""'re"", 'fundamental', 'flaws', 'are', 'ones', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'stuck', 'future', 'DCAU', 'releases', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'excitement', 'future', 'adventures', 'Wonder', 'Woman']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

1677981,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00GD9GNEY,NF,"[1, 2]","This is based on the New 52 relaunch of the Justice League. Counting the various comic books, relaunches, videos, graphic novels, and the like, I suspect we're up to over a dozen different versions of the Justice League origin, with more likely to come in the years ahead. There is one significant difference between this movie and the New 52 version, and that is that Aquaman has been replaced by Shazam (Captain Marvel).The movie takes place fairly early in the career of all of these heroes, before they are truly recognized as heroes. A suspicious U.S. government wants to imprison and study them rather than let them have free reign. The movie opens with news about a wave of abductions by mysterious winged creatures, with speculation that it might be the new vigilante, Batman, who's at fault. Green Lantern runs into one of these abductions and foils it, but is then attacked by the creature until he's rescued by Batman. After a long chase, the creature escapes into the sewer.The interplay between Green Lantern and Batman is amusing, as this is before either of them has met the other. Particularly amusing is the sequence where Green Lantern tries to figure out what powers Batman has: &#34;Wait, you're not just some guy in a bat costume, are you?! Are you freaking kidding me?!&#34;Batman and GL track the creature and find him planting a device, whereupon GL rushes to attack. The creature utters a cry, &#34;For Darkseid,&#34; and blows itself up. GL manages to save both of them, after which they examine the device and reach the conclusion that it's alien: &#34;Alien? You mean like the guy in Metropolis?&#34;We segue to S.T.A.R. labs, where Dr. Silas Stone is scanning an identical device, brought to him by the Flash, that had been planted in Central City. All they've been able to find is that it's emitting a signal, a signal that is also emanating from similar devices in other cities. We see Dr. Stone get a reminder about &#34;Victor's football game - Now,&#34; a reminder he ignores. At the game, a depressed Victor keeps looking in vain for his father. A young Billy Batson sneaks into the stadium and sits in the seat reserved for Vic's father, and then meets Vic after the game in the locker room.The next stop is a trip to the White House, where a group of people have gathered to protest against Wonder Woman, who has arrived at the White House with Steve Trevor in a limousine. A confused Wonder Woman, new to man's world, is flabbergasted to learn that they are protesting her.We return to Green Lantern and Batman, who have tracked down Superman in Metropolis. A cocky GL goes after Superman, confident that he's got the power to imprison him so that they can investigate. Alas, he is sadly mistaken. Batman gives it everything he's got but can't even cause Superman to blink. After a fight, Batman manages to stop Superman with a single word, &#34;Clark,&#34; as they finally start talking instead of fighting. &#34;Someone is strategically placing these boxes; we have to find out who and why before it's too late.&#34;Victor Stone confronts his father in the lab, as we find out that the gulf between father and son is as wide as the Grand Canyon. The device in the lab activates, nearly destroying Victor in the process. Silas and his associates take Victor into &#34;The Red Room,&#34; containing new and untried technology from multiple sources. Using this technology, they fight desperately to keep Victor alive, replacing what he's lost with cybernetic components, giving birth to Cyborg (a cruder version that we're used to in other versions we've seen).All over the world, we finally see what the devices were: portals into another world, used for a wholesale invasion from Apokolips of armored demonic fighters, under the orders of Darkseid. The heroes, Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Shazam, and a newly-minted Cyborg, do their best but they're in danger of being overwhelmed. They have one edge, though: Cyborg's new technologies allow him to tap into the signal from Apokolips, giving him vital information.To give any more information would spoil the movie. Suffice to say that a lot happens, the threat grows, and the heroes (and the world) are overwhelmed. There is only one chance....The personalizations don't always work for me, as Green Lantern is pretty much a brash, arrogant jerk. We know that is likely overcompensation, but it just doesn't jibe with what we know of Hal Jordan in his prior incarnations. There has always been a bit of cockiness in his personality but this was too much. Similarly, Shazam is too much the annoying kid.The animation is very good but there are no real standout sequences, just good solid work. The voice acting is the same: very solid but no real standout performances. The action sequences are good, particularly when the heroes are clicking on all cylinders in the final fight with Darkseid. I've given this movie 3 stars but it's really a 3.5 star movie, as it's a fun mindless, popcorn romp. It's not the best that this studio has done but it's an okay adaptation of the original source material.",3,Another Justice League relaunch,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,5115,"['based', 'New', '52',

This is the story told by this film.I like the New 52 Justice League more than I should.  It's like candy, it's nice once in awhile, but you can't live off of it..  Some people will say ""refined sugar? Are you nuts?""  while others will gobble it down without a second thought.Sometimes, the weaknesses of the film are the weaknesses of the source materialJustice League, Vol. 1: Origin (The New 52).  For example, people who aren't familiar with the DC universe won't know who Darkseid is, and after watching the film you'll hardly know anything about him.  On the other hand, since the DC universe has been rebooted, old-timers have no idea what aspects of the old universe(s) still apply.  The film does improve over the comic in one respect: in the comic the plot ""Darkseid invades, but we don't know why"" gets changed to ""Darkseid invades to take over the world.""  Ta-da?  Also, with the exception of Cyborg, we aren't given origins for anybody.Sometimes, the weaknesses of the film go beyond weaknesses of the source material. For example, when Superman first meets Green Lantern and Batman, he jumps to the conclusion that they're working with Darkseid's parademon*** and tries to kill them.  I'm not exaggerating, in the film, he tries to kill them.  In the comic, the fight isn't so extreme.  (Yes, superheroes fight each other when they first meetMarvel's The Avengers [HD], that's been standard for agesSuperman Vs. The Amazing Spider-Man.)  First impressions mean a lot, so this fight scene unfortunately leaves the viewer with the impression that Superman's a jerk.Some of the changes from the comic can be a bit silly.  Victor Stone (Cyborg) is called ""Victory"" (a nickname, I hope?) and Darkseid has gone from being about 12 feet tall to being about 30 feet tall.  And yeah, for whatever reason, they replaced Aquaman with Shazam (the hero previously known as Captain Marvel, who is now a woman (Captain Marvel, Vol. 1: In Pursuit of Flight.)  And since we aren't given any origins, we don't have any idea why, out of all the people in the world, this ""little thief"" was chosen to be Shazam.The animation quality is pretty good, but I'd rather be looking at Jim Lee's artwork.  There are moments when it's a little jerky, so they probably needed more cell drawings.  The voice acting isn't that bad, I'd say the weakest is Wonder Woman.If you already know you hate the New 52, you won't like this.  If you think the Justice League ought to behave the way they do hereJustice League: Season One (DC Comics Classic Collection)or hereSuper Friends!: Season One, Vol. Oneyou won't like this.  (It's PG-13, folks.) If you hated ""Man of Steel"" or Nolan's Batman trilogy, you won't like this.  Otherwise, you might like it.  When all is said and done, though, the comic was better.*Don't ask.  It's complicated.**Except for the Barry Allen Flash and the Hal Jordan Green Lantern, who met previously.***A parademon is a monster, and consequently the heroes can kill them, guilt-free.  Wonder Woman can slice and dice them with her sword (yeah, she has a sword now, you didn't know that?) with no moral ambiguity whatsoever.",3,About as good as the comics it's based on,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,3580,"['2011', 'DC', 'rebooted', 'universe', 'starting', 'almost', 'all*', 'characters', 'scratch', 'Comic', 'saw', '52', 'new', 'number', '1', 'issues', 'old', 'standards', 'Superman', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'awhile', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'brought', 'universe', 'Stormwatch', 'first', 'story', 'line', 'showed', 'New', '52', 'Justice', 'League', 'meeting', 'other', 'first', 'time**', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'teaming', 'up', 'fight', 'off', 'invasion', 'Darkseid', 'story', 'told', 'film.I', 'New', '52', 'Justice', 'League', 'more', 'should', 'candy', 'nice', 'once', 'awhile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'it..', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'refined', 'sugar', 'Are', 'nuts', 'others', 'will', 'gobble', 'down', 'second', 'thought.Sometimes', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'source', 'materialJustice', 'League', 'Vol', '1', 'Origin', 'New', '52', 'example', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'DC', 'universe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Darkseid', 'watching', 'film', ""'ll"", 'hardly', 'know', 'anything', 'other', 'hand', 'DC', 'universe', 'been', 'rebooted', 'old-timers', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'old', 'universe', 's', 'still', 'apply', 'film', 'improve', 'comic', 'one', 'respect', 'comic', 'plot', 'Darkseid', 'invades', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'changed', 'Darkseid', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Ta-da', 'Also', 'exception', 'Cyborg', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'origins', 'anybody.Sometimes', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'go', 'weaknesses', 'source', 'material', 'example', 'when', 'Superman', 'first', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Batman', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'working', 'Darkseid', 'parademon***', 'tries', 'kill', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'film', 'kill', 'comic', 'fight', ""n't"", 'so', 'extreme', 'Yes', 'superheroes', 'fight', 'other', 'when', 'first', 'meetMarvel', 'Avengers', '[', 'HD', ']', 'been', 'standard', 'agesSuperman', 'Vs', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'First', 'impressions', 'mean', 'lot', 'fight', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'viewer', 'impression', 'Superman', 'jerk.Some', 'changes', 'comic', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'silly', 'Victor', 'Stone', 'Cyborg', 'called', 'Victory', 'nickname', 'hope', 'Darkseid', 'gone', 'being', '12', 'feet', 'tall', 'being', '30', 'feet', 'tall', 'yeah', 'reason', 'replaced', 'Aquaman', 'Shazam', 'hero', 'previously', 'known', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'who', 'now', 'woman', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'Vol', '1', 'Pursuit', 'Flight', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'origins', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'people', 'world', 'little', 'thief', 'was', 'chosen', 'be', 'Shazam.The', 'animation', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'looking', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'artwork', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'little', 'jerky', 'probably', 'needed', 'more', 'cell', 'drawings', 'voice', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'d"", 'say', 'weakest', 'Wonder', 'Woman.If', 'already', 'know', 'hate', 'New', '52', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'Justice', 'League', 'ought', 'behave', 'way', 'do', 'hereJustice', 'League', 'Season', 'One', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Classic', 'Collection', 'hereSuper', 'Friends', 'Season', 'One', 'Vol', 'Oneyou', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'PG-13', 'folks', 'hated', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'like', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'comic', 'was', 'better', '*Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'complicated', '**Except', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'Flash', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'who', 'met', 'previously', '***A', 'parademon', 'monster', 'consequently', 'heroes', 'can', 'kill', 'guilt-free', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'can', 'slice', 'dice', 'sword', 'yeah', 'sword', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'whatsoever']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

Even in recent Justice League TV series or Superman/ Batman Apockylpse  I don't recall Darkseid being bigger or badder than he is in this movie. he reminded me of some versions of the hulk that been done.  I barely recognized Cyborg being redsigned a bit different than his NEW 52 self or his past appearances  in both comics and animation forms.  While the trade was better in some ways like when Superman, Batman, Flash and Green Lantern studied mother both  love how the movie extended a lot of the scenes like Green Lantern and Batman first encounter and better police station bit with Barry Allen than comics.  Even the twist difference on Batman going to rescue Superman from Darkseid is different in the movie than the comic book. I see what other reviewers mean about Hal attitude. Even though he had it in New 52 comic it does feel out of character to the Hal Jordon we're use to in stuff like Green Lantern The Animated Series or Emerald Knights movie.Many complain about Wonder Woman's voice. To me Linda Carter from 1970s live action Wonder Woman series will always be the true wonder woman but you don't see her being ask to animate Wonder Woman voice ever.I will take off a star in the review for the profanity (though not at the level of cartoons like Family Guy and American Dad) they makes me wish for the return of the return of DC silver-age where all their super heroes were boy scouts compared to how they behave today. The characters may have grown up with the readers but perhaps they've grown up a little too much.if you check out disk 2 documentary on the movie you will find Aquaman does make an appearance in the movie you just have to know where to look. but I don't want to spoil the Easter Egg.over all though I think Marvel is good for TV shows like Ultimate Spider-man, Avengers Assemble and Hulk Agents of Smash while I prefer DC for movies such as this.",4,we're not super friends,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1959,"['movie', 'had', 'more', 'surprises', 'replacing', 'Aquaman', 'Shazam', 'Even', 'recent', 'Justice', 'League', 'TV', 'series', 'Superman/', 'Batman', 'Apockylpse', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Darkseid', 'being', 'bigger', 'badder', 'movie', 'reminded', 'versions', 'hulk', 'been', 'done', 'barely', 'recognized', 'Cyborg', 'being', 'redsigned', 'bit', 'different', 'NEW', '52', 'self', 'past', 'appearances', 'comics', 'animation', 'forms', 'trade', 'was', 'better', 'ways', 'when', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Flash', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'studied', 'love', 'how', 'movie', 'extended', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Batman', 'first', 'encounter', 'better', 'police', 'station', 'bit', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'comics', 'Even', 'twist', 'difference', 'Batman', 'going', 'rescue', 'Superman', 'Darkseid', 'different', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mean', 'Hal', 'attitude', 'Even', 'had', 'New', '52', 'comic', 'feel', 'character', 'Hal', 'Jordon', ""'re"", 'use', 'stuff', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Emerald', 'Knights', 'movie.Many', 'complain', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'voice', 'Linda', 'Carter', '1970s', 'live', 'action', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'true', 'wonder', 'woman', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'ask', 'animate', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'voice', 'ever.I', 'will', 'take', 'off', 'star', 'review', 'profanity', 'not', 'level', 'cartoons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'American', 'Dad', 'wish', 'return', 'return', 'DC', 'silver-age', 'where', 'super', 'heroes', 'were', 'boy', 'scouts', 'compared', 'how', 'behave', 'today', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'readers', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much.if', 'check', 'out', 'disk', '2', 'documentary', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'Aquaman', 'make', 'appearance', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'Easter', 'Egg.over', 'think', 'Marvel', 'good', 'TV', 'shows', 'Ultimate', 'Spider-man', 'Avengers', 'Assemble', 'Hulk', 'Agents', 'Smash', 'prefer', 'DC', 'movies', 'such']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

I'm in my late 50's and have seen endless iterations of Marvel and DC characters over the years. Regardless of the writers' attempts to 'modernize', 're-imagine' or 'make them relevant' the characters' core attributes were retained.Unfortunately, when DC decided on its 'New 52' initiative, they decided to change everything but the characters' names, and this animated feature is the ultimate case-in-point.1) Superman has been turned into an arrogant, bullying jock. This is the antithesis of the 'human' person that he is, as a result of being raised as 'Clark Kent'. In a word, they turned him into Guy Gardner. Why not just make Guy the Green Lantern for this film to begin with? Speaking of which....2) Hal Jordan has been turned into a puerile, preening and ignorant jock. Again...what's the point? 'The Man Without Fear' is clear-headed and has an intuitive sense of tactical battle that meshes with his innate daring to make him a hero. This boob is less an intergalactic policeman, and more like 'Officer Krupke' from West Side Story.3) Wonder Woman has been turned into a mass of bloodlust and hormones...without the tempering intellect and devotion-to-duty that leavened her warrior spirit. In all fairness, her immediate, physical attraction to Superman has its amusing aspects.4) 'New God' Darkseid has been re-cast as a generic, grunting bad-guy. His motivation for invading the earth was so non-specific that he may as well have been Mongul or Doomsday for the total lack of personality/leadership/godliness he evidenced. In addition, he shows power/strength that is about 1/2 of the traditional characterization...just so the JLA can graphically put both of his eyes out.5) Flash is a 1-dimensional straight-arrow, and 'Shazam' (Captain Marvel) is cast with his alter-ego of Billy Batson more of an angry, hormonal teen than an innocent child.The only one who is recognizable is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Apparently DC's only mainstream cash-cow is sacrosanct.Finally, the majority of plot and screen time goes to Cyborg...and, this re-imagining of his origin. I have no problem with the character...he's cool/techno/and has interesting baggage. However, he is a secondary character from the DC mythos and not nearly interesting enough to be made a founding JLA member...let alone the focus of this film.The movie throws in dialog that is too graphic for youngsters, and too moronic for adults. For example, when Wonder Woman used her lasso to compel an antagonist to explain his yelling that she ""...dress(es) like a whore..."", he explains ""...at home, I dress up in a Wonder Woman costume...it makes me feel powerful.' WTF!?Another serious issue I have is the extreme and gratuitous maiming, gore and cold-blooded killing...by the JLA! Unlike the 'DCU Flashpoint Paradox', the violence/bloodshed in this film serves no purpose...doesn't advance the plot...has no lessons to teach. It's there, simply because the pimple-faced target audience thinks such crap is 'cool'.Finally, this film continues the DCU march towards a very Japanese style of animation...and, of poor quality. For example, Superman looks as if he's suffering from allergies: his face is lumpy, and his neck is as thick as a water main.All-in-all, this is a mean-spirited, poorly scripted film with a massive disconnect between the costumes and the personalities who are wearing them. I expect this kind of disdain for the DC characters from the live-action movies (yes, 'Green Lantern', I'm talking to you); but, to see it from the animated division is truly sad.I really can't find anything to recommend about this film.",2,"Don't bother, this is strictly for 14 year-old 'cellar-dwellars'",1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,3665,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", ""'old-time"", 'when', 'mythologies', ""'m"", 'late', '50', 'have', 'seen', 'endless', 'iterations', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'characters', 'years', 'Regardless', 'writers', 'attempts', ""'modernize"", ""'re-imagine"", ""'make"", 'relevant', 'characters', 'core', 'attributes', 'were', 'retained.Unfortunately', 'when', 'DC', 'decided', '52', 'initiative', 'decided', 'change', 'everything', 'characters', 'names', 'animated', 'feature', 'ultimate', 'case-in-point.1', 'Superman', 'been', 'turned', 'arrogant', 'bullying', 'jock', 'antithesis', ""'human"", 'person', 'result', 'being', 'raised', ""'Clark"", 'Kent', 'word', 'turned', 'Guy', 'Gardner', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'Guy', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'film', 'begin', 'Speaking', '.2', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'been', 'turned', 'puerile', 'preening', 'ignorant', 'jock', 'Again', 'what', 'point', 'Man', 'Fear', 'clear-headed', 'intuitive', 'sense', 'tactical', 'battle', 'innate', 'daring', 'make', 'hero', 'boob', 'less', 'intergalactic', 'policeman', 'more', 'like', ""'Officer"", 'Krupke', 'West', 'Side', 'Story.3', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'been', 'turned', 'mass', 'bloodlust', 'hormones', 'tempering', 'intellect', 'devotion-to-duty', 'leavened', 'warrior', 'spirit', 'fairness', 'immediate', 'physical', 'attraction', 'Superman', 'amusing', 'aspects.4', 'God', 'Darkseid', 'been', 're-cast', 'generic', 'grunting', 'bad-guy', 'motivation', 'invading', 'earth', 'was', 'so', 'non-specific', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Mongul', 'Doomsday', 'total', 'lack', 'personality/leadership/godliness', 'evidenced', 'addition', 'power/strength', '1/2', 'traditional', 'characterization', 'just', 'JLA', 'can', 'graphically', 'put', 'eyes', 'out.5', 'Flash', '1-dimensional', 'straight-arrow', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'cast', 'alter-ego', 'Billy', 'Batson', 'more', 'angry', 'hormonal', 'teen', 'innocent', 'child.The', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'recognizable', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Apparently', 'DC', 'only', 'mainstream', 'cash-cow', 'sacrosanct.Finally', 'majority', 'plot', 'screen', 'time', 'Cyborg', 're-imagining', 'origin', 'have', 'problem', 'character', 'cool/techno/and', 'interesting', 'baggage', 'However', 'secondary', 'character', 'DC', 'mythos', 'not', 'nearly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'be', 'made', 'founding', 'JLA', 'member', 'let', 'alone', 'focus', 'film.The', 'movie', 'throws', 'dialog', 'too', 'graphic', 'youngsters', 'too', 'moronic', 'adults', 'example', 'when', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'used', 'lasso', 'compel', 'antagonist', 'explain', 'yelling', 'dress', 'es', 'whore', 'home', 'dress', 'up', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'costume', 'feel', 'powerful', 'WTF', 'serious', 'issue', 'have', 'extreme', 'gratuitous', 'maiming', 'gore', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'JLA', ""'DCU"", 'Flashpoint', 'Paradox', 'violence/bloodshed', 'film', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'lessons', 'teach', 'there', 'simply', 'pimple-faced', 'target', 'audience', 'thinks', 'such', 'crap', ""'cool'.Finally"", 'film', 'DCU', 'march', 'very', 'Japanese', 'style', 'animation', 'poor', 'quality', 'example', 'Superman', 'suffering', 'allergies', 'face', 'lumpy', 'neck', 'as', 'thick', 'water', 'main.All-in-all', 'mean-spirited', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'film', 'massive', 'disconnect', 'costumes', 'personalities', 'who', 'are', 'wearing', 'expect', 'kind', 'disdain', 'DC', 'characters', 'live-action', 'movies', 'yes', ""'Green"", 'Lantern', ""'m"", 'talking', 'see', 'animated', 'division', 'truly', 'sad.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'recommend', 'film']",DCU: Justice League: War (DVD)

First off, the overall quality of the feature is, as usual, light years ahead of anything Marvel has put out, with the exception of Planet Hulk.  The animation is excellent, the story is tight (no unforgivable holes; this is supposed to be fun, after all), and the voices all fit perfectly (thanks GOD for Andrea Romano!).  It's a great way to spend some time; I liked the characters they chose for this group, although I don't diss Aquaman like others do, so I wouldn't have minded having him here.I'll admit to being a little old fashioned, so I found the profanity to be excessive and distracting.  It's as if the script writers had a severely limited vocabulary, and couldn't come up with anything more clever.  Part of what makes these features so entertaining is the effort that the writers put into being dramatic without going for the cheap pop.  Anybody can swear; we see it everywhere.  But that's the problem; we see it so much, we forget that profanity is the language of the unlearned.  I hold these writers to a higher standard.  Don't get me wrong; I get that these are supposed to be edgy; I like edgy.  But it has to help the story; it has to add to the drama or comedic effect; here, it just comes off as uninspired and lazy.As I said, I like the characters they chose, but here again the writing fails some of them, especially Green Lantern.  He comes off like a pretentious, self-absorbed idiot.  Again, I like edgy; I don't like annoying jerk.  Worst thing to do to a supposed &#34;hero&#34; is to make him a character that your audience can't empathize with.  Before long, I was hoping they'd forget GL was supposed to be in the movie.  Not good.Cyborg is well done, and relatable; the Flash is surprisingly mature and engaging.  Wonder Woman...........well, try harder next time; she doesn't have to be THAT ignorant, does she?  And I definitely think they went in the right direction with Superman and Shazam (Captain Marvel).Like I said, overall, a good piece of work, and a welcome addition to my collection.

Superman and Wonder Woman openly flirt and Batman and Green Lantern butt heads in a hilarious way. It was nice seeing a smile (or smirk) on Batman after getting the best of Green Lantern. Flash is always loveable and a good friend. Cyborgs' storyline was heartfelt and filled with emotion and having Shazaams story blend with Cyborgs made me like Shazaam as I wasn't a Shazaam fan. His character in the story was perfectly told through the eyes of the child he really is. I really enjoyed How the team came together and how menacing Darkseid was. He was larger than life just like his agenda but was still able to be wounded by Wonder Woman in a major way.

Yuk!I did not mind the way this film was put together. Wonder Woman is more haughty and arrogant. And puzzled about the ways of Man and the USA. Green Lantern comes across as a smart-aleck, brash and tough. I think the scriptwriter took a page (unfortunately) from the last Green Lantern movie. Hal Jordan is not that bad. As for Batman, well, he's Batman.Superman and the rest meet each other for the first time. The humor of that meeting is cut short by an invasion of creatures send over through the Boom Tube by Darkseid. The Parademons are not invincible and fall to the heroes, but there's just too many of them.I did enjoy the substory of Cyborg's origin and his struggle with his father, who is &#34;too busy&#34; to see his son's football game. Unfortunately parents do screw up their priorities and this film makes that point well.Shazam was quite a deviation of the original Fawcett character and was not done that well. Billy Batson is not a radio announcer (excuse me while I age myself) but is an orphan. The orphanage is not played up well at all, and his family/friends are not really much in this film.Overall, not a bad foray into the JLA world. Looking forward to more adventures. Based on a Geoff Johns story.Here's the Wiki version: Justice League: War is a direct-to-video animated superhero film, an adaptation of Geoff Johns and Jim Lee's 2011 Justice League: Origin storyline.

1678029,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00GD9GNEY,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","At one point during Justice League: War, Green Lantern turns to Batman and calls him a &#8220;phenomenal douchebag&#8221;.  Welcome to DC Comics&#8217; New 52 Universe where Green Lantern is an arrogant A-hole, Shazam is an obnoxious teenager, Superman leers at Wonder Woman like he&#8217;s on the prowl in a single&#8217;s bar and people on the street are protesting Wonder Woman because she dresses like a whore.  The 18th DC original animated film brings the universally reviled (by anyone who actually likes comics) New 52 to life in an adaptation of Justice League: Origin by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee.  The film retells the first teaming of the Justice League which, by my count, is at least the third time the first teaming has been seen in an animated film.  But I suppose when you re-boot your universe every fortnight you&#8217;re bound to have some repetition.Batman and Green Lantern have their first encounter while tracking down a mysterious creature running through Gotham City.  Now admittedly I was never a huge Green Lantern fan but I read the title here and there over 40 years and never recall Hal Jordan being so completely unlikable to the point that you actually find yourself rooting for the villain. The creature turns out to be one of Darkseid&#8217;s Parademons.  It is one of several that have infiltrated the world, planting Mother Boxes as a prelude to an invasion from Apokolips.But let&#8217;s not jump too far ahead&#8230;before that we get Superman battling Green Lantern and Batman when he thinks they are working with the Parademons and nearly kills Batman because, you know, kill first and ask questions later is apparently what this new Superman is about.  Eventually they realize they are all on the same page.  The Mother Boxes open portals to Apokolips through which Darkseid and thousands of Parademons emerge to attack the Earth.  Those three heroes along with Cyborg, Shazam, the Flash, and Wonder Woman all join forces to battle the invaders.  Of course in true heroic fashion they fail at first because they all want to grab the glory.  And it is only when they work as a true team that they manage to defeat Darkseid and send him back home.Frankly Justice League: Origin isn&#8217;t a strong enough story to have warranted an animated adaptation.  The new 52 was designed to bash longtime DC fans into submission and make them forget everything they&#8217;ve learned in the previous 70 years or so.  Darkseid was tossed in casually to give them a significant foe to steel themselves against.  And since when is Darkseid like 30 feet tall anyway?  Batman is at least treated with some respect and still seems like Batman.  The Flash gets the short end of the stick and barely has anything to do while Cyborg hogs a good portion of the story as we get his entire origin told.  Why waste roughly one-third of the running time just to tell one character&#8217;s origin at all?  Heath Corson&#8217;s screen play is sloppy to say the least and you have to wonder if this guy ever even read a Justice League comic previously.Director Jay Oliva does an admirable job with the screenplay, particularly the action and fight sequences.  Fortunately for fans the film is largely fight scenes from beginning to end which helps forget about some of the unlikable characters.  This is definitely a PG-13 or even close to an R rated Justice League.  These guys are NOT playing around!One high point of most DC animated films is a strong voice cast with generally well-respected actors lending their voices to the production.  Even that comes up short in Justice League: War where the cast is led by Sean Astin as Shazam and Michelle Monaghan as Wonder Woman.  In all honesty those two are ok as is Jason O&#8217; Mara as Batman.  But Justin Kirk&#8217;s squeaky voice as Green Lantern almost had me muting the sound and going with subtitles.The animation is similar to what we&#8217;ve seen in other recent films such as Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and Superman: Unbound where the characters appearances are lean and angular with an Anime influence.Justice League: War is a disappointing entry in the DCU animated film series which has been trending downwards ever since the excellent two-part The Dark Knight Returns adaptation.",2,Superman leers at Wonder Woman like he&#8217;s on the prowl in a single&#8217;s bar

The dialog was snarky at its best, but mostly cliche and at times just flat out stupid.The fight scenes were over the top, which normally I love, but it was just a constant repeat of arrogant newbies (with I suppose the &#34;New 52&#34; DC twist) fighting again and again. Plot was optional, Character Development was nonexistent, and the &#34;new&#34; take on Captain Marvel (Shazam), Superman, Green Lantern, and Cyborg was AWFUL. Flash was &#34;meh&#34; and Batman was &#34;ok&#34;.Wonder Woman was the only saving grace, though I was not hip on her costume and the lust for Superman while Green Lantern, Shazam (a 10 year old boy), and Superman took turns being teenage pervs trying to hit on her or making stupid (did I mention cliche') one liners about her.Those were the heroes. The villains were worse. Darkseid was drawn to look like Thanos (right down to the color schemes) and somehow became 15-25 feet tall depending on the scene and the artist's lazy interpretation of a character that is supposed to be about 7-8 feet tall at most. Desaad looked like a screwed up Jonah Hex...the Paradaemons...they looked somewhat cool.Darkseid was also a 1-dimensional boring villain vice the cool aloof interplanetary conqueror that he is supposed to be.SPOILER (MORE OF A WARNING) - The fact that they stabbed Darkseid in the eyes (Wonder Woman's sword in one and a crowbar in the other) was not only dumb, but insulting to the Justice League...and it didn't slow this now Hulk ripoff from fighting on...though blind...with a 4' sword through his brain...oh and thank you so much 'Man of Steel' - now it is ok for Superman to break alien's necks and kill them...again. He killed Desaad...dont worry, the no-eyed-giant-spazoid-Darkseid lived.The writers spent too much time TRYING to be witty to focus on a coherent story leaving the viewer not caring which side wins.I believe this is a taste of what we can expect in the next few DC attempts at live action movies as well.

1678036,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00GD9GNEY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is an animated film based upon DC&#8217;s New 52 story, &#8220;Justice League: Origins.&#8221; Basically, this is a re-telling of how the Justice League was formed according to DC&#8217;s new 52. In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR Green Lantern rescues a woman from being kidnapped and chases a creature (that turns out to be a Parademon) that the news media mistakenly believes might be the Batman. Green Lantern almost gets killed, but is saved by Batman. They end up teaming up and follow the Parademon through the sewers where it plants a strange device before dying. Batman and Green Lantern discover the box is alien in origin and set out to question the only alien on Earth they know of: Superman. One thing leads to another and the box turns out to be one of many planted around the world that are set to explode at the same time. The explosion of each of the devices opens an interdimensional portal that becomes flooded with Parademons entering our world. Batman, Green Lantern, and Superman are soon joined by Flash, Wonder Woman, Shazam (Captain Marvel), and the newly created superhero Cyborg. Together they find themselves fighting not only the legions of Parademons, but the master of the Parademons, Darkseid. One would think it would be a global battle, but instead it seems mostly focused in one unnamed city in North America. However, it does go interdimensional when Superman and Batman travel through one of the portals and travel to Darkseid&#8217;s home planet of Apokolips.In terms of a purely cinematic animated action movie, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is fairly decent. There&#8217;s a ton of action, lots of fight scenes, and the story is fairly easy to follow.With that said, you can&#8217;t really just judge JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR on the terms of an animated action movie. This isn&#8217;t just an animated action movie. This is an animated action movie about DC superheroes and the founding of the Justice League. These aren&#8217;t just any characters. These are characters that have been around for a long time (over 70 years for Superman and Batman) and, therefore, the movie must be judged on how each of the major characters involved are treated.In terms of an animated action movie starring DC superheroes, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR is an atrocity. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the revamp of the DC universe with the &#8220;new 52&#8221;.Superman &#8211; the Big Blue Boy Scout is gone. In his place is an arrogant, self-righteous jock that is a bit of a bully and kind of a meathead. In most of Superman&#8217;s history, he was someone who was able to keep his emotions under check and was always looking out for other people (Superman would go out of his way to fight enemies away from population centers). In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR he&#8217;s extremely emotional, especially when it comes to anger. Not only that, but ****SPOILERS*****Superman kills people in this movie!Green Lantern &#8211; the name of the Green Lantern in this movie is called Hal Jordan, but this is not Hal Jordan. The Green Lantern in this movie is really Guy Gardner because the Green Lantern in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR acts nothing like Hal Jordan, but acts like Guy Gardner  It&#8217;s never stated, but it is implied that this Hal Jordan has been a Green Lantern for a long time. If that&#8217;s true, he must be the Keystone Cop of the Green Lantern Corp.Wonder Woman &#8211; the Wonder Woman I was familiar with was not only a beautiful warrior, but she was also highly intelligent and a superior diplomat. Not so in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR. The Wonder Woman here is still a beautiful warrior, but she&#8217;s actually not very intelligent, knows nothing about diplomacy, is self-centered, and is a little obnoxious. In this version of Wonder Woman, she&#8217;s kind of a mean girl jock who seems to have some dominatrix tendencies. For instance, there&#8217;s a scene where she used her lasso of truth around a man not to gain any critical truth from him, but to publically humiliate him and she takes joy in doing it!Shazam (Captain Marvel) &#8211; in the new DC &#8220;Captain Marvel&#8221; is no more and his name has been permanently changed to Shazam. I&#8217;m okay with that aspect (anyone who has never read comics thinks his name is Shazam anyway). However, what I don&#8217;t like is the way that Billy Batson is portrayed. Instead of a good-natured and innocent homeless boy, Billy has now been turned into an angry pre-adolescent on the verge of puberty.Darkseid &#8211; Darkseid is one of the most powerful villains in the DC universe. It makes sense that he&#8217;s used as the main antagonist in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR. However, although he&#8217;s the big baddie in this movie, he&#8217;s not as powerful as one would think. Not only that, but he&#8217;s completely devoid of any personality. Darkseid is a villain, but he&#8217;s not a nameless villain without any character. However, in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR he might as well be a robot created by Lex Luthor.Flash- Flash seems about normal, but like Darkseid, he&#8217;s been left without any personality whatsoever.Batman- unlike almost all of the other characters, Batman is the only character in this new lineup that seems completely unchanged.In addition, Cyborg is now a founding member of the Justice League. JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR could really have been divided into two parts: the second part could have dealt with the war against Darkseid, while part one could have been titled &#8220;Cyborg&#8221; because about half of the movie deals with the new origin of Cyborg.I have nothing against Cyborg. He&#8217;s an interesting character with a good back story. However, he was not and should not have been a part of the founding members of the Justice League. In JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR poor Victor Stone is turned into Cyborg and before he even knows what&#8217;s happened to him, he&#8217;s fighting Parademons and flying off to join the other superheroes against Darkseid. He doesn&#8217;t even know what his abilities are! It&#8217;s a politically correct move from DC and one that wasn&#8217;t needed. Not only that, but Cyborg&#8217;s inclusion means that one of the real founding members of the Justice League gets bumped out of the picture: Aquaman. Despite being one of the most powerful and interesting characters in the DC lineup, Aquaman continues to be made fun of and his exclusion here is just one more mockery.In addition to all of the changes in the characters, there is an overall difference in tone between the superheroes here and how they have always been portrayed before. The characters are all much more angry than they ever were in the original comics. Anger was mostly the realm of the Marvel universe (Hulk, anyone?) whereas DC&#8217;s characters were more down-to-Earth and good natured. Not anymore: Superman, Wonder Woman, Billy Baston, and even Cyborg are all very angry.Not only that, but the characters in this movie cuss a lot. There are several &#8220;hells&#8221;, &#8220;damns&#8221;, and &#8220;s***s&#8221; said throughout the movie. Cussing also used to be a big no-no in the DC world. But, in the New 52, that old adage is long gone. So the big gun, Superman, is no longer the alien from outer space who is supposed to be a Christ-like figure, and instead has been transformed into an angry and lustful warrior who doesn&#8217;t think twice at killing and who occasionally cusses.It used to be that other than the violence, a film like this would basically be a PG film. Not anymore. Even if you took out all the violence, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR would easily be a PG-13 movie because of the language and sexual innuendo that it is filled with.Overall, although on a purely animated action movie level, JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR has enough to entertain, in the terms of a DC animated movie, it perfectly illustrates everything that is wrong with the New 52.",2,Where Have All the Good Men

I have said time and time again that I had no idea where this film library was going to go after The Dark Knight Returns. Apparently, there is a much darker world beyond that film and we have been seeing it ever since.'Justice League:War', is a loosely based sequel of 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox' in which we see the after math of the The Flashes journey to save the world. Now we are given a Justice League like we have never seen before. Each of these characters that you know and love are suddenly no longer friends and all of them have personalities that you would have never expected. While Batman is still the paranoid strategist that he has always been, he is accompanied by a self centered Green Lantern, boy scout Flash, careless Wonder Woman and let's not forget big bully Superman. This film also has the pleasure of giving us a great origin story of Cyborg, much like what 'Justice League: New Frontier did with Green Lantern and Martian Man-Hunter. We also have Captain Marvel in the mix voiced by non other than Sean Astin who adds some great one liners and action.This film is darker, with a whole bunch of new foul words that have never been used in the DCU films yet. The story is just one big fight with a plot, but gritter and with fewer slow points like in Batman/Superman: Public Enemies. It has a villain that everyone loves, plenty of surprises and a Marvel Film Universe-esque ending.This film library is going on 20 films this year with two more exciting stories on the way featuring non other than Batman.

This is better then Flashpoint as far as plot and story and even characters go..except for Captain Marvel..this is wrong very very wrong..makes no sense at all, this brat would never have been picked to be Captain Marvel, strange thing is he's not in the books. The art work is very good, there are a great many scenes that are truly beautiful, while the character designs are still the same as they were in Flashpoint (kind of remind you of Sting from the movie Dune)...Jim Lee's work is very epic in the books, but he does suffer  quite a few panels that are just explosions of color and make little sense, the animation here is more contained and easier to view...very pleasing to the eyes. The story is fuller, but it is after all just slugfest and doesn't need much of a story..bad guy comes to conquer the world and the good guys just pound him back to his world..you know in the past Superman has been known to do this all by himself.

1678043,A2LCO1J0MNWB43,B00GD9GNEY,"Walters Judson Group ""BOSTON DANIEL""","[2, 2]","The film is fine if you are not too particular about characterization,and film particulars concerning producing and directing.The WJGroup reviewed this (4 of us), and have given it 3 1/2 Stars.The ""Superheroes""GREEN LANTERN is far too arrogant, and the film producers make him looknot very intelligent. The film focuses on him very much.  We like the GreenLantern.. just not this version of him.WONDER WOMAN is far too aggressive and is depicted to be so powerful,she is seen taking hits from the villain ""Darkseid"" that do not deter her, whileone hit from Darkseid knocks out Superman... umm..  (probably to be politicallycorrect now in these days).  Wonder Woman is very threatening towards an icecream man that does nothing to provoke her, yet she pulls her ""sword"" on him.THE FLASH.. mostly ignored in the film, is probably the most intelligent, andreasonable character. He is depicted as rather quiet, and was our most favoriteof all the characters in this film.  Flash does nothing to act like a jerk in anypart of this film and stays this way through out the film.BATMAN, was far too knowledgeable and was depicted as very wise in this film.He knows more than Green Lantern, as is portrayed as been far too seriousin the film.  We did not like his know-it-all character very well.SHAZAM or Captain Marvel (originally), is far too childish, and is a big fan of""victory stone"" (another DC52 character from the 1980s).SUPERMAN comes off as being far too aggressive at first, but slows down a littleas the film progresses.  The film seems to pair Superman with Wonder Woman -which was not necessary. Even ""Shazam"" asks Wonder Woman in the film - ""isthat your boyfriend?""...CYBORG..is 1980 ""teens titans"" character (an invented 1980s DC comic)..that isgiven far too much focus on this film. He seems to know everything they (the villains)are planning and doing. We did not like him on the film.  Another Super hero shouldhave taken this spot.  If you notice - all the Super heroes are from foundations of the1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  Yet Cyborg is so unknown, that you would have to read DCcomics really well to know of his existence. Our readers at WJGroup were familiar with allof the Super heroes - except this character (84 per cent had NOT even heard of him).Cyborg takes too much credit in this film.The film is very violent and full of action, some of it is pretty good - especially thesound effects.CURSING was totally unnecessary for the film.  This is not for Kids under 12 - especiallyif you are trying to raise your kids with MANNERS.  No F words are heard, but muchmore is heard like a man calling Wonder Woman a ""Whore"" (or ""looks like a whore"")ERRORS in the film include DARKSEID looking too big upon entering the film, and thenlooking too small later.  He seems to 40 feet tall at first, but later, he seems to be smallerthan some of the Super heroes.WRITING is bad.. very bad scripting writing. Some times the characters will speak likethey are 9 years old, then speak very intelligently.

And I thought it created some great one liner comedy at times. Never seen a CYBORG origin before and I think this was a great one.I just don't understand why every time we get a new superhero movie we need to do a new origin. After 5 season of JLA on TV.
