It's almost comic book-type put-on for most of the film and then it turns into a sad story at the end.Most of the actors in this star-studded cast are in cameo roles, the best being Stacy Keach's ""Bad Bob."" He seems to be about everyone's favorite character in this film, and justifiably so.The storyline: ""Roy Bean"" (Newman) almost gets killed visiting this one-horse town out in the middle of lawless El Paso, then gets his revenge on the people who roughed him up, and takes over the town which is really nothing but this one building! He appoints himself judge, obtains a few ""marshals,"" and then brings an assortment of crooks and strange people in to be hanged. It's just one long parade of strange characters, either passing by or hanging around (literally).There are sub-plots involving (1) Bean's obsession with the famous Lily Langtree, and (2) what happens when the town grows immensely and things change drastically, such as the people wanting a little bit more of a democracy that what Judge Roy Bean had been offering.This is an intriguing movie that is hard to define. The major negative to the film was that it got kind of silly and ran out of gas in the last half hour, except for the Langtry storyline.",4,"Different, And Mostly Fun",1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,1248,"['Wow', 'what', 'quirky', 'western', 'almost', 'comic', 'book-type', 'put-on', 'most', 'film', 'then', 'sad', 'story', 'end.Most', 'actors', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'are', 'cameo', 'roles', 'best', 'being', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Bad', 'Bob', 'be', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'justifiably', 'so.The', 'storyline', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'Newman', 'almost', 'killed', 'visiting', 'one-horse', 'town', 'middle', 'lawless', 'El', 'Paso', 'then', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'roughed', 'up', 'town', 'really', 'nothing', 'one', 'building', 'judge', 'few', 'marshals', 'then', 'assortment', 'crooks', 'strange', 'people', 'be', 'hanged', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'parade', 'strange', 'characters', 'either', 'passing', 'hanging', 'around', 'literally', 'are', 'sub-plots', 'involving', '1', 'Bean', 'obsession', 'famous', 'Lily', 'Langtree', '2', 'what', 'when', 'town', 'immensely', 'things', 'change', 'drastically', 'such', 'people', 'wanting', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'democracy', 'what', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'had', 'been', 'offering.This', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'hard', 'define', 'major', 'negative', 'film', 'was', 'got', 'kind', 'silly', 'ran', 'gas', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Langtry', 'storyline']",N/A

108516,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790741059,David Baldwin,"[6, 6]","This film is a true original.  If one were to nutshell it you could call it a surreal dark comic western.  It's rare that you get such individualistic talents as director John Huston, writer John Milius, and actor Paul Newman together for one project.  It's rarer that the result produces gold.  Huston, with some exception, was something of a cynic in his work.  Milius, considered something of a bad boy in Hollywood, was known for his conservative political bent.  As noted in a recent obituary for Newman he betrayed his matinee idol looks and pursued rebel roles and offbeat projects.  As a previous reviewer stated Huston and Milius take liberties with Judge Bean's life.  Though some of the elements are true for the most part this is a fanciful work.  But it's an artistic triumph.  If one needs to pursue the ""truth"" go to the library.  This film is completely mesmerizing with witty dialogue that crackles.  This is definitely one of Newman's more underrated performances.  It's an understated performance that barely conceals his off-kilter character.  Stacy Keach has a great cameo as Bad Bob an adversary of Bean's who has the audacity to denigrate the Judge's feminine ideal, Lillie Langtry.

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JUDGE ROY BEAN was a 1972 western film written by John Milius, directed by John Huston, and starring Paul Newman (at the height of his career, between Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting). It was loosely based on the real-life, self-appointed frontier judge.SUMMARY: An outlaw, Roy Bean, rides into a West Texas border town called Vinegaroon by himself. The customers in the saloon beat him, rob him, toss a noose around him, and let Bean's horse drag him off. A young woman named Maria Elena finds and helps him. Bean promptly returns to town and shoots all those who did him wrong. With no law and order, he appoints himself judge and &#34;the law west of the Pecos&#34; and becomes the townspeople's &#34;patrone.&#34; Bean renames the saloon The Jersey Lilly and hangs a portrait of a woman he worships but has never met, Lillie Langtry, a noted actress and singer of the 1890s. When a band of thieves come to town (Big Bart Jackson and gang members Nick the Grub, Fermel Parlee and Whorehouse Lucky Jim), rather than oppose them, Bean swears them in as lawmen. The new marshals round up other outlaws, and then claim their money after Bean sentences them to hang. Dispensing his own kind of frontier justice, Bean lets the marshals hang Sam Dodd and share his money. When a drunk shoots up a saloon, Bean doesn't mind, but when Lily's portrait is struck by a bullet, the fellow is shot dead on the spot. Prostitutes are sentenced to remain in town and keep the marshals company.QUESTIONS: Who was Maria Elena? Who was the mountain man? What kind of gift did he give to Maria? Why did Bean go to San Antonio? What did the Judge bring back to Maria?MY THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. There was action and drama right from the beginning. I thought the job that Paul Newman did in the role, as Judge Roy Bean was great. This Western had something in it as most Westerns don't and that was comedy. One of the best is when Maria catches the Judge with another woman an she takes after him with a shotgun. I bought this movie however for Victoria Principal and I wasn't disappointed. This was Victoria introduction and she was great. She was very young in this picture but her acting was great. You didn't get to see much of her because it was a Western, however because of her beauty and acting I'm giving this movie 5 weasel stars.",5,INTRODUCTION TO VICTORIA PRINCIPAL,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2580,"['TITLE', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'TIMES', 'OF', 'JUDGE', 'ROY', 'BEAN', 'opened', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'December', '18', '1972', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'will', 'take', '2', 'hours', 'watch', 'movie', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'TIMES', 'OF', 'JUDGE', 'ROY', 'BEAN', 'was', '1972', 'western', 'film', 'written', 'John', 'Milius', 'directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'height', 'career', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Sting', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'self-appointed', 'frontier', 'judge.SUMMARY', 'outlaw', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'West', 'Texas', 'border', 'town', 'called', 'Vinegaroon', 'customers', 'saloon', 'beat', 'rob', 'noose', 'let', 'Bean', 'horse', 'drag', 'off', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Bean', 'promptly', 'town', 'shoots', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'law', 'order', 'judge', '34', 'law', 'west', 'Pecos', '34', 'townspeople', '34', 'patrone.', '34', 'Bean', 'saloon', 'Jersey', 'Lilly', 'portrait', 'woman', 'never', 'met', 'Lillie', 'Langtry', 'noted', 'actress', 'singer', '1890s', 'When', 'band', 'thieves', 'come', 'town', 'Big', 'Bart', 'Jackson', 'gang', 'members', 'Nick', 'Grub', 'Fermel', 'Parlee', 'Whorehouse', 'Lucky', 'Jim', 'rather', 'oppose', 'Bean', 'lawmen', 'new', 'marshals', 'round', 'up', 'other', 'outlaws', 'then', 'claim', 'money', 'Bean', 'hang', 'Dispensing', 'own', 'kind', 'frontier', 'justice', 'Bean', 'marshals', 'hang', 'Sam', 'Dodd', 'share', 'money', 'When', 'drunk', 'up', 'saloon', 'Bean', ""n't"", 'mind', 'when', 'Lily', 'portrait', 'struck', 'bullet', 'fellow', 'shot', 'dead', 'spot', 'Prostitutes', 'are', 'sentenced', 'remain', 'town', 'keep', 'marshals', 'company.QUESTIONS', 'Who', 'was', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'Who', 'was', 'mountain', 'man', 'What', 'kind', 'gift', 'did', 'give', 'Maria', 'Why', 'did', 'Bean', 'go', 'San', 'Antonio', 'What', 'did', 'Judge', 'bring', 'back', 'Maria', 'MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'action', 'drama', 'right', 'beginning', 'thought', 'job', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'did', 'role', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'was', 'great', 'Western', 'had', 'something', 'most', 'Westerns', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', 'comedy', 'One', 'best', 'when', 'Maria', 'Judge', 'woman', 'shotgun', 'bought', 'movie', 'however', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'Victoria', 'introduction', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'picture', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'much', 'was', 'Western', 'however', 'beauty', 'acting', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'weasel', 'stars']",N/A

Those movies were all great, but pretty much one dimensional and set the tone for some collective disappointment over the content of Judge Roy Bean.There are some great hilarious moments in this film but I never really got it until recently. It's actually a love story above all else, and a comedy, as well as John Huston's own statement about the retreating old west. If you view it in that context you'll be very impressed. If you're looking for pure comedy you may find that it drags in moments. However, this is the last time you'll get to see Paul Newman with that devilish Eddie Felson/Ben Quick light in his eyes, he was made for the part as a self-appointed and self-styled Judge/philosopher that dispenses justice to just about everyone that wanders through his town whether they deserve it or not. This film also showcases IMO the best villian of all time in Bad Bob, a murderous long haired psychotic albino come to lay ole' Beano to rest. Victoria Principal is so cute you just want to, well you'll see. Anyway, it's very funny but it is a love story. I found that rather distraction 30 years ago but I didn't get it.

I don't buy a lot of videos to own, but I had to have this one in my permanent library. When the DVD comes out I'll be sure to get it, too.When I first saw this in the theaters in '72 I was attracted by the action, the humor, and the sentimentality ( I still can't keep a dry eye when I watch the final scene with the watch bear....)  As I got older I realised that there is a lot more to this movie. There is a consistent theme about Law and Justice, and the distinction between them.When we first see Roy Bean he is a petty outlaw, less than a man. He has total contempt for law and justice, which he doesn't distinguish between. Then, when he first becomes a ""Judge"", it is in dubious title only- to fill his own pockets.  As time goes on he intuitively dispenses true Justice in the name of the Law. By the final climactic scene, when asked who he is , he replies simply, ""Justice."" He has gone full cycle, from a scoff-law and less than a man, to the embodyment of Justice itself, to more than a man.You'll notice that his chief adversary is a Lawyer Gass, a man that knows everything about the Law and nothing about Justice. A ""man"" that steals more with legal trickery than the old outlaws ever dreamed of stealing. It was this movie that made me see that Law is the creation of men, while Justice is an ideal that emanates directly from God.I don't know if this is the theme that John Huston had in mind, but it is what I get out of it.",5,"""Law is the handmaiden of Justice.""",1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,1523,"['not', 'only', 'favorite', 'western', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'lot', 'videos', 'own', 'had', 'have', 'one', 'permanent', 'library', 'When', 'DVD', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'too.When', 'first', 'saw', 'theaters', ""'72"", 'was', 'attracted', 'action', 'humor', 'sentimentality', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'dry', 'eye', 'when', 'watch', 'final', 'scene', 'watch', 'bear', 'got', 'older', 'realised', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'consistent', 'theme', 'Law', 'Justice', 'distinction', 'them.When', 'first', 'see', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'petty', 'outlaw', 'less', 'man', 'total', 'contempt', 'law', 'justice', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'Then', 'when', 'first', 'Judge', 'dubious', 'title', 'only-', 'fill', 'own', 'pockets', 'time', 'intuitively', 'true', 'Justice', 'name', 'Law', 'final', 'climactic', 'scene', 'when', 'asked', 'who', 'simply', 'Justice', 'gone', 'full', 'cycle', 'scoff-law', 'less', 'man', 'embodyment', 'Justice', 'more', 'man.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'chief', 'adversary', 'Lawyer', 'Gass', 'man', 'everything', 'Law', 'nothing', 'Justice', 'A', 'man', 'more', 'legal', 'trickery', 'old', 'outlaws', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'stealing', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'see', 'Law', 'creation', 'men', 'Justice', 'ideal', 'directly', 'God.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'theme', 'John', 'Huston', 'had', 'mind', 'what', 'get']",N/A

108535,AK61LQI92GTCH,0790741059,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[15, 19]","Solidly entertaining, whimsical biography of the hangin' judge west of the Pecos.  THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JUDGE ROY BEAN stars a growly and bearded Paul Newman in the title role, guide to the life of a legend of the Old West and host to a revolving series of guest stars.`Whimsical' seems kind of an odd word now that I think about it.  After all, it connotes a lightness of spirit, and that's a hard choice of words to use for a movie that features an on-screen hanging or five.  `Whimsy' is defined as `an odd or fanciful or capricious idea,' and `whimsy' begets `whimsical', which is made of sturdier stuff that its pappy - `Whimsical: adj. Erratic in behavior or degree of unpredictability.'  I'll let the word stand. John Huston's JUDGE ROY BEAN is erratic and unpredictable enough.  John Milius wrote the original screenplay.  With movies like `Jeremiah Johnson' and `Geronimo: An American Legend' among his credits, Milius has given ample evidence that he's a `print-the-legend' type of writer.  And he takes his heroes seriously.  Underneath everything - and everything piles high in this movie - there's a script that wants to make a legendary hero out of its title character.That serious intent is subverted by Newman, whose charm is unsuccessfully buried beneath a beard and gruff exterior, and Huston, who peppers the whole thing with darkly humorous vignettes.  In fact, JUDGE ROY BEAN is more or less a series of disconnected incidents, from Bean's massacre of a bar full of desperados who rolled him for his (stolen) cash and left him for dead to his circa 1920 explosive showdown with an unscrupulous eastern lawyer played by Roddy McDowell.  In the interim he appoints himself judge, the law west of the Pecos, peppers the bar with posters of the beloved Lily Langtry (Ava Gardner,) adopts a black b'ar dropped off by Grizzly Adams (John Huston,) takes up with pretty young Marie Elena (Victoria Principal,) and witnesses an assortment of quirky cutthroats pass under the shadow of his well-worn noose.If Milius wanted to plant Bean next to Geronimo and Jeremiah Johnson in the pantheon of American legends he must have cringed when Stacy Keach appeared for his twenty-minute segment.  Gigged out in white pancake make-up and an Edgar Winters' fright wig, Keach plays the albino outlaw Bad Bob, who's so tough he drinks boiling coffee directly out of the pot.  Bad Bob has come to call Judge Bean out, and hurls a series of insults about Lily Langtry in the attempt.  I liked the darkly, surreally, humorous Bad Bob character, but he doesn't belong in a movie that's trying to keep things real.  Worse, much, much worse, is the `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' like musical interlude, also known as `Picnic with the B'ar.'  Newman, Principal, and their 300-pound black bear co-star cavort along the Pecos River, accompanied by Andy Williams singing the saccharine ""Marmalade, Molasses and Honey.""  I don't know for a fact, but I believe ""Marmalade, etc."" effectively killed the use of cheesy musical interludes in the middle of westerns.
