The series is missing a plot and the characters are not interesting. The only thing worth watching is the fight scenes witch are pretty well done. The artwork is purposly bad at times and the character talk to the camera and complain about how badly they are being drawn.

I agree - if you are looking for a historical-based, deep plotted, good art styled anime about martial arts, then look somewhere else.However, I really enjoyed Jubei-chan. It was more of a spoof of anime than anything else. Some moments of drama, but mostly poking fun at the serious martial art types of anime. The characters are goofy, and it is a bit racy at times, so its definately not for kids under 15 or so.The soundtrack is awesome, and I absolutely loved the fight scenes (moreso towards the end of the series). It does move kinda slow towards the beginning (to introduce the characters), but with the last two discs especially, I could not pull myself away.",4,"Not a ""smart"" anime, no....",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,731,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'ragging', 'title', 'quite', 'heavily', 'agree', 'are', 'looking', 'historical-based', 'deep', 'plotted', 'good', 'art', 'styled', 'anime', 'martial', 'arts', 'then', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else.However', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Jubei-chan', 'was', 'more', 'spoof', 'anime', 'anything', 'else', 'moments', 'drama', 'mostly', 'poking', 'fun', 'serious', 'martial', 'art', 'types', 'anime', 'characters', 'are', 'goofy', 'bit', 'racy', 'times', 'definately', 'not', 'kids', '15', 'so.The', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'fight', 'scenes', 'moreso', 'end', 'series', 'move', 'kinda', 'slow', 'towards', 'beginning', 'introduce', 'characters', 'last', 'two', 'discs', 'especially', 'could', 'not', 'pull', 'away']",Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl - Complete Set

Watch an episode in English & Japanese & tell me that the English voice actors don't completely suck & KILL THE HUMOR. The following voices suck in English; Mr. Nanohana, Bantaro, Ozaru, Kozaru, Shiro's is okey, Jiyu's is ill-fitting, Lord Jubei doesn't sound old enough, Ryuujouji's is actually a vast improovement, & KOINOSUKE'S IS UNFORGIVABLY BAD!Yes, the dubb is truely aweful, the voices are just terrible. A pitty there isn't a complete set of sub-only, & the subs aren't as good as the fansubs. (for those of you lacking in otakuness, a fansub used to be the only way we could get some animes & latter became the prefured alternative to dub-only VHS releases) Thank goodness for dual-language DVDs.... After years & years, JC1 is still one of my top 3 favorites & I prefur it heavily over season 2.

753398,AGYNZFMF3Y7C,B00009AV89,Mayle,"[1, 1]",If you actually looking for ninja's in this anime by the end of this anime you either feel stupid or really angry. This is not based on any ninja's what so ever besides one which they made fun off. Which was Hattori Hanzo. How dare they mock such a great man like that. There is actually one charcter you might actually like in this story. He dies at the begin of the series. Yet and afterwards its a story going downhill that can't stick to the plot. Some people might call this comedy but i just call it something sad. This story is more like sailor moon without a deep storyline and a snotty girl that has a very hard time conprehending situations of common sense. Which is understandable why some people might like it as they may relate to this character. The fight schenes they will be actually about 4 fight schenes you might come across for the fact that it really doesnt contain that much action. the rest would be 3 second battles as in every episode will have one. What i actually see here is the story that i despite so much for using the term ninja on the title. The main character will be a swordsman aided by a cowardly samurai(which wouldn't make any sense any if a samurai would be a servant to a ninja anyways). Jubei will have many classmates in which the story won't revolve around but they will be there and they shall be anoying for the except of the kendo braggin kid which they story will revolve around. This anime has great music production and artwork but it lacks in character development and story which is basically worth nothing if you dont have those in my opinion having a story that you won't care about and characters you dont care about makes you wonder why your are still watching it. They thing i actually like was jubei's battle uniform which is the only reason why I didn't give it 1 star.,2,No no no!

753399,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00009AV89,Michael Valdivielso,"[10, 11]","Yagyu Jube Mitsuyoshi (1607-1650) was a swordsman with a reputation as a swashbuckler and also a man of mystery.  There are many legends and tales surrounding this man, a man who disappeared for 12 years, which only added to the fires of rumor.  Many believe that during this time, after being dismissed from the Shogun's service, that he in fact continued to work as an agent.  The Yagyu was a family known for their swordsman they produced and Jube was the last of the line (and many feel the best).  The best known story of his adventures was his duel with dummy swords (which was later used in 'The Seven Samurai').The DVDs take this story and add to it.  They continue the tale, saying that Jube left behind an eyepatch that held all his skills and that Koinosuke, his loyal retainer, must find the right person to give it to.  The poor guy ends up searching 300 years before finding Jiyu Nanohama, nicknamed Jubei, and giving it to her.And then the story gets weird!Great story, the artwork can be very good AND silly.  Extras and Easter Eggs in each DVD and you can feel the enjoyment that went into making the set.  Not as many laughs as some and sometimes it tried to be serious (which only worked once and a while- they just did too good a job with the humor and silliness for the serious stuff to stick).  Feels kind of thin, as most background characters, settings and details are simple - the plot is all and nothing will get in its way.Oh, and lots of sword fighting!  Magic, some focus on female chests and love letters.I would suggest getting it used if you can.  Some parts are fine for kids, yet some parts have inside jokes and mature issues only an adult would understand.  Why is it so many moms die before the story even starts in some of the anime I have?
