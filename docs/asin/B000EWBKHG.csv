The camera had to be a piece of crap, the lighting was atrocious (shadows were everywhere...especially where they shouldnt be), and the script was probably written in under 2 hours.  And where did they get those terrible actors?  You could almost see them reading q-cards taped to the wall.  Ive seen better actors in local car dealership commercials.  And the constant footage of animal slaughter added nothing to the movie, except for making it impossible for your stomach to accept any type of snack while watching this lame excuse for a film.",1,Are you serious?,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,630,"['think', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'invested', 'packaging', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'camera', 'had', 'be', 'piece', 'crap', 'lighting', 'was', 'atrocious', 'shadows', 'were', 'everywhere', 'especially', 'where', 'shouldnt', 'be', 'script', 'was', 'probably', 'written', '2', 'hours', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'terrible', 'actors', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'reading', 'q-cards', 'taped', 'wall', 'Ive', 'seen', 'better', 'actors', 'local', 'car', 'dealership', 'commercials', 'constant', 'footage', 'animal', 'slaughter', 'added', 'nothing', 'movie', 'making', 'impossible', 'stomach', 'accept', 'type', 'snack', 'watching', 'lame', 'excuse', 'film']",Ulli Lommel's Btk Killer

This has to be the cheapest piece of crap I've ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on.  And I dig movies about serial killers.  This one just sucks because it's possibly the lowest budget movie that's ever been filmed.  This movie literally looks like it was shot on a bad home video camera with cheap stock footage spliced in. The acting is beyond atrocious, and the script is something that could have come from the mind of a 3rd grader, to be generous.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!

979372,AQRODCIYD7PYX,B000EWBKHG,"Robert F. Powers ""show maniac""","[2, 2]","Ulle Lommell has never made a movie that didn't suck and with BTK KILLER his record stands intact. The story should be about how Dennis Rader, beginning in 1974 Bound, tortured and killed 10 women and stopped and resurfaced 30 years later. Instead Lommell is more interested in showing cows and pigs being slaughtered and those images are always super-imposed over the scenes of BTK torturing his victims. Those scenes are a bit creepy but I suspect that owes more to the director being a bit on the creepy side himself.I won't even begin to knock the sub-par acting and shoddy production values(lighting, filming, settings, sound etal) because when you work on a Ulle Lommell film it's conceded as a given that you are the worst the industry has to offer.To make the whole project even more reprehensible is the movie ends when BTK is captured and the results of the trial and aftermath is never shown.  I suspect Mr Lommell either ran out of stock footage of cows and pigs being slaughtered or he fell asleep. Good idea.
