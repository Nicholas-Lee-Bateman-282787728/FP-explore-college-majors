It's certainly not deep and quite predictable but it's harmless fun enlivened by a great performance by Alan Rickman as a snobby Brit who runs a snobby wine shop in snobby Paris.Off he goes to the Napa Valley to find the best American vintages to compete in a blind tasting. He runs into a rag-tag bunch of cliches all clamoring to be seen and heard -- the proud former lawyer who chucked it in to run a vineyard and is on the verge of going broke; his hippy wastrel son; his proud Mexican employee and his attractive blond bombshell summer intern.It all bubbles up nicely like the Widow Clicquot's best champagne into a pleasing finish that lingers only slightly on the palate and in the memory before dissolving into effervescence.,3,Pretty pleasant and predictable,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,901,"['light', 'comedy/drama', 'how', 'Californian', 'wine', 'industry', 'beat', 'snobby', 'French', 'own', 'game', 'own', 'home', 'court', 'slips', 'down', 'pleasant', 'Chardonnay', 'certainly', 'not', 'deep', 'quite', 'predictable', 'harmless', 'fun', 'enlivened', 'great', 'performance', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'snobby', 'Brit', 'who', 'snobby', 'wine', 'shop', 'snobby', 'Paris.Off', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'find', 'best', 'American', 'vintages', 'compete', 'blind', 'tasting', 'rag-tag', 'bunch', 'cliches', 'clamoring', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'proud', 'former', 'lawyer', 'who', 'chucked', 'run', 'vineyard', 'verge', 'going', 'broke', 'hippy', 'wastrel', 'son', 'proud', 'Mexican', 'employee', 'attractive', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'summer', 'up', 'nicely', 'Widow', 'Clicquot', 'best', 'champagne', 'pleasing', 'finish', 'only', 'slightly', 'palate', 'memory', 'dissolving', 'effervescence']",Bottle Shock

Given the other movies offered, however, it looked appetizing enough, and I'm glad we tried it out.Here, we meet again Alan Rickman (best-known for his role in the Harry Potter film series, as the snarling and sinister Snape). This time, however, he's Steven Spurrier, an amusing British  dirty blond, the middle-aged proprietor of a failing Paris wine-tasting ""academy,"" ahem, business. His exceedingly poor French pronunciation earns him a snub from even the sommelier at classiest City of Light annual vintners' event: He is nearly rejected at the door, and upon indignantly showing his ticket, is seated at the last table in the rear, by the swinging dining room door.We also get another surprise performance from Dennis Farina, most famous for his hardened cop character in Law and Order. Here, as Maurice, Farina plays a gauche New York transplant to Paris, an acquaintance of Spurrier who proposes that the latter stir up business by hosting a wine tasting to pit French wines against the best that California has to offer. The thinking is that California will naturally lose, big time.But everyone in France, at least, is  astonished by the outcome. Along the way, viewers also witness fine character acting by California winery owner Jim Barrett (Bill Pullman) and his post-Woodstock generation son, Bo (Chris Pine).A thoroughly enjoyable romp through a 1976 true-life story---or a story at least based on true life.

In the effort to make this an 'interesting' tale I think the writers actually did damage to the film.  Still it's interesting enough to recommend, but only to those either hugely interested in wine culture or some lovely character work by Rickman & Pullman.  Beyond the clear inventions (Barret's son Bo being at the tasting, Gustavo even actually working at Chateau Montelena prior to the tasting, and the way the wine was selected and acquired by Spurrier) the actual facts as related by Taber, supported by Spurrier, suggest this depiction is far more fanciful than factual.  Which is a shame to my mind since the real facts, as related by Taber in &#34;The Judgement of Paris&#34; (2005).  I think Rotten Tomatoes gets it about right with the comment that the film fails to take advantage of the inspiring actual story!

I think that could have been left out as it didn't really add that much to the movie. The story was so entertaining, though. It's nice to see the underdog win. The Barretts (the Americans) are people who put their heart and soul into making wine, and it's more than just really good...it's a part of who they are and their history, and I think that is something to be admired and appreciated. I watched the extra on the DVD about their search for an excellent wine, and it was informative and neat to see the real Jim and Bo Barrett talking about their wine and wine-making process. Very cool. It was short, but it was still a good little feature.I love Alan Rickman and Bill Pullman, and both of them didn't disappoint in this film. I couldn't get over Bo's (Chris Pine's) hair, but he acted well so I forgive the hair stylist.

1215397,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B001LPWGBY,AverageReviewer,"[8, 10]","I found this movie almost by accident and I must say that it was a wonderful find.  I'd classify it as a light comedic drama.The story centers on two fronts:The first is the story of a small struggling vinyard in California with Bill Pullman at its head raising a 26year old teenage son, Chris Pine, who is still living like its Woodstock 1969, only its the 1970s.  Bill has a small group of mexican workers, played very well by Freddy Rodriguez and Miguel Sandoval and a bright up and coming intern, Rachael Taylor, who comes to work at the vineyard.  Pullman is in debt and had left the city to follow his passion and build great wines in California.  We imagine that all the wine growers of the region have similar stories...just a bunch of ex hippies with ties to academia working the land planting grapes and hoping that one day their wines will be recognized for their greatness.The second - on the other side of the ocean in Paris, the wonderful actor Alan Rickman plays a British Expat who runs an academy for Wines...only all his wines are French.  His partner, another wonderfully talented actor David Farina, tells Rickman that his problem is that the Academy only deals with French wines and that the game is about the world.  So Alan Rickman sets up a blind wine tasting competition between American and French Wines for the American bicentennial (well FRENCH wines vs american wines)...with the French Flag three times bigger than the American flag on the pamphlet.  Rickman comes to America and tastes wines from the Californian wines and picks the best ones to take back to France.You know what happens, in 1976 on the American bicentennial, in a blind taste test, American wines took the #1 spot in both White and Red categories over French wines (the French picked American wines as the best...by mistake I'm sure).  This put California on the map and those poor hippies, well they became snobs too and bought ferraris.Overall, the story told here is great.  Its what I would call ""relaxful""....you know what's going to happen, there's some comedy, a light love triangle (very light), some pretty scenery, some tremendous acting, lots of truly great actors, and a great story of how the underdog hippie grew up to drive the 7 Series BMW...go figure, some things never change.So why hairy....well, this was the 1970s and the weather in California was hot and I have to say that throughout the entire movie (with the exception of Bill Pullman), everyone in the movie appeared to have six days growth of hair....everyone seemed hairy, in the true classical hippie tradition (many of my friends are hippies or sons/daughters of hippies so no disrespect meant there) just that this movie is firmly set in the 1970s and they replicated everything including the clothing, dressing styles, and yes the HAIR.  Hilarious.Its a great movie and a timeless story of us taking our snobby French neighbors down a peg or two.  Who doesn't enjoy that.

Chris Pine plays his part as the long haired son of a controlling father, Bill Pullman, who quit his money making job as a lawyer to start his own wine making business. The time is around the 1970s and is brilliantly captured with the soundtrack and the atmosphere of Napa during that time. A French wine seller, Alan Rickman, is the wine snob that travels from France to Napa to check out the local winemakers of Napa before he approaches the community with the challenge.  Until 1970, France had been the only leader in making great wines - until the upstarts from California USA came along. Chris Pine is at his laid back best with his shenanigans to make the French challenge a reality.

It's just that Bottle Shock is such a hugely disappointing film given the high expectations.  After all, it features an amazing cast, is filmed in the beautiful wine growing counties of California, and, most prominently, attempts to capitalize on the monstrous success of a certain previous Oscar winning film also featuring the humble grape.  One reviewer even writes ""The Next Sideways"" right on the front of the DVD case.  That critic either never saw Sideways or was heavily sedated (in ""drink and dial"" mode) when he wrote that blurb.  As other reviewers have commented, there's a jagged story-line, disappointing editing, and characters with apparently nothing intelligent, witty, or humorous to say.  There are bizarre subplots, like the friendly father-son boxing matches and, even more confusing, the Sam-Gustavo-Bo love triangle.  And the movie doesn't even make clear exactly what Spurrier's mission was, why it was financed, or how it saved his failing wine shop in Paris.  I could go on but won't.  Sideways was a beautifully written story with characters so vivid and alluring, even if in an idiosynchratic way, you wanted to personally meet them.  Though nominated for best supporting actor in that film, Thomas Church famously did not win the Oscar he so richly deserved.  Alan Rickman is similarly the kind of actor who demands your attention when he's on screen.  However, even Rickman cannot save Bottle Shock's tangled mess.  It is Film-Making 101 that a movie must either tell an intensely interesting story or, at the very least, introduce us to intensely interesting characters.

1215407,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001LPWGBY,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed Bottle Shock, but that could be the Pinot Grigio talking. Bottle Shock was brash, but not impertinent. I watched it with my sister, who is my vino compa&ntilde;era, though you could hardly consider her palate discerning... Hey, that's a joke. She usually even eschews wine that is dispensed from a box.Maurice: It's oaky... Oh, yeah, and smoky. I detect... bacon fat... laced with honey melon.Anyway, this movie is the story of when California wines really gained the respect of the world by beating the French wines at a blind tasting in Paris in 1976, historically referred to as the Judgement at Paris.You have the father, who has a crazy dream of owning a vineyard and making great wine, just on the verge of the ultimate humiliation: having to beg for his old job back. This is Jim Barrett, played by Bill Pullman, who I saw in David Lynch's film Lost Highway--and it wasn't really his fault, the catastrophe that was Lost Highway.Then you have his son, Bo Barrett, played by Chris Pine, who was in the latest Star Trek film as Captain Kirk. He is a hippie trying to find himself, still sporting long hair, though Woodstock happened, like, 7 years ago. He is in conflict with his father, and they settle their disputes in the boxing ring. He can't beat the old man in the ring, but he beats him in seizing the opportunity to take down the snobby French. Bo enters the French Competition in spite of his dad's objections.[first lines]Bo Barrett: [voice-over during a vineyard pan] It wasn't always like this. Before Paris, people didn't drink our wine. I mean, my friends did. But  you could hardly consider their palates discerning...Bo Barrett: Hell, we were farmers... sort of...[pan to what looks like out takes from Dazed and Confused but with the Montelena label on the wine bottles]Then there is Gustavo, played by Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez. He is a scrappy short guy who was Gio Rossi, one of Ugly Betty's boyfriends. Stavo is the proud son of Mexican immigrants. He wants not only respect for himself and his incredibly discerning palate, but also respect for California wine. He works for Bo's dad on the Montelena vineyard.Gustavo Brambila: You people, you think you can just buy your way into this. You cannot do it that way.Jim Barrett: All right...Gustavo Brambila: You have to have it in your blood, you have to grow up with the soil underneath your nails, the smell of the grapes in the air that you breathe. The cultivation of the vine was an art form. The refinement of the vine is a religion that requires pain and desire and sacrifice.Into the mix comes Sam, a UC Davis grad who comes to the vineyard to work as an intern. Sam is played by blonde from the land down under Rachael Taylor. She combines academic knowledge of agriculture with a love of the grape, and also possibly Bo... or Gustavo.Sam: To Gustavo Brambila, renegade, who worships the sanctity of the vine.Gustavo Brambila: And can't afford a full tank of gas.[they toast].All the women in this film seem to have men's names. Joe is played by Eliza Dushku, who was Missy in Bring it On and Sissy in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She portrays the local barmaid who will play a pivotal role in the eventual triumph of California wine.Steven Spurrier: This is good!Joe: What were you expecting? Thunderbird?Other pivotal roles are played by Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina. Rickman, familiar as Severus Snape from Harry Potter films, is Steven Spurrier, a British wine snob who opens his mind to the possibility that California wine may have surpassed the French. Farina is Maurice, a wine enthusiast who shows him the way.Steven Spurrier: Great wine is great art, my friend. I am, in effect, a shepherd... whose mission is to offer the public another form of great art and to guide its appreciation thereof.Maurice: Well, a shepherd... by definition, needs a flock. And a business, by necessity... needs customers.Steven Spurrier: So, if I were to subscribe to that proviso would you be considered a customer?Maurice: No. No, I would be considered... an enthusiastic... advocate.The Bottom Line is that Bottle Shock combines a soundtrack of vintage 70's Rock by The Doobie Brothers, The Allman Brothers, Foghat, America, and Puccini with a feel-good story of how California wine kicked the door wide open, proving that the French weren't the only ones who knew how to make wine. It could be compared to Sideways, another story about Wine Enthusiasm, but from the vintners' point of view. It pairs well with Pinot--either Grigio or Noir. It even goes well with Merlot!Sideways(2004)Lost Highway(1997)Star Trek (2009)(2009)Bring It On(2000)Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone(2001)Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back(2001)Havoc (Unrated Version)(2005)Grindhouse (2 Disc Collector's Edition) (Death Proof / Planet Terror)(2007)Bobby (Widescreen Edtion)(2006)Saving Private Ryan (Single-Disc Special Limited Edition)(1998)Steven Spurrier: ""Wine is sunlight, held together by water.""

Dennis Farina and Alan Rickman are good, but the rest of the cast, the Americans that is, other than Freddy Rodriguez (who is very good) are pretty bland to just plain bad.The story is loosely based on the Judgement of Paris tasting, and I say LOOSELY.  There is much that was added to make this film more interesting (such as the airport scene with the bottles, the wine turning brown, etc...), but the fact is that George Taber, a lesser known journalist for Vogue I believe, was in attendance and sold the story to Time magazine.  The rest is history.  It really just established what most California vintners at the time already knew: that their wines were good enough to compete on a global scale.The back story is interesting, though it does stray from actual history a bit.  The saving grace of the film is that it is quite fun.  There are some great moments, both interesting and hilarious.  Another great little plus is that the film really does take the viewer back to the 70s.  They did a great job.  Granted, many parts are completely out of place, such as the entrance road to Chateau Montelena looking like it is in Carneros and not in Calistoga.  (It's heavily wooded at the entrance road).

It's not a bad family film, and that is meant in a nice way, not some saccharin way.Oh sorry for the little hit in the title of this review, Stags Leap turned out to be the red wine in that blind tasting, and has been a perennial crowd pleaser in my wine choices.The good about this film, it appears to be pretty well filmed in California (turns out the wine shop in Paris is really Sonoma, California). There's some gorgeous fly over images of vineyards. Napa, Sonoma, Russian River, and Alexander Valley never looked more beautiful. Rachel Taylor as Sam, is stunning in this film. Alan Rickman (Snape from Harry Potter) is a just oh so unlikeable Brit. Chris Pine is a charming young actor, although we are convinced he never changed his shirt through the whole movie. The characters are generally very likeable.The not so great, the personal stories. They just don't pull together very well. Sam is quite the hussy in this one, she has an intimate afternoon with Gustavo and then deeply kisses Bo when he comes back from France. The plot is very predictible. Nothing really surprising happens. But then again, it's a pleasant little film, so what would anyone expect.The really not so good, the music. The director over played his hand frequently with music building when something obvious had happened on screen. It's a bit insulting to the viewer to have this kind of double or triple reinforcement. There were a number of strange edits, continuity was affected.This is rated PG-13. There's a bit of language here or there, not offensive. There is a scene where Gustavo and Sam end up in bed, with no nudity, but it is implied that they did something in bed. By the way, the scene from her doors is absolutely monumentally beautiful. There is a scene where Sam washes a grape crusher and gets all wet while men sit and watch her do this, that was the moment my wife stopped watching the film. In the end, a reasonably mature 11 or 12 year old could easily watch this film.A pleasant afternoon. No bad aftertaste. Good legs. Decent nose. Plenty of fruit, with barely a hint of tannin or oak.

I didn't even know the name of the movie to start with, having missed the first couple of minutes; but the sight of Alan Rickman and Dennis Farina held my interest, and I'm glad I stayed with it.The time is 1976, a year when France still held sway as the world leader in wine. Alan Rickman plays Steven Spurrier, a displaced Brit sommalier in France, wondering how to better his business. A friend, Maurice (played by Dennis Farina in an unusual role for him), challenges Mr Spurrier to go to California and collect some California-bred wine to bring back in a blind taste test against the French wine, to establish that French is, indeed, the best.Mr Spurrier arrives in Wine Country driving, of all things, a Gremlin. This was, of course, a minor plot device, but a charmer; I smiled when I saw it. And, of course, he has car trouble, and is assisted by the vintner through whose fields he has been driving. Their initial exchange - hard-working farmer, snooty sommalier - was amusing, as of course the farmer had the last word...which rattles the sommalier enough to inspire him to seek out the farmer's ranch later on.This is a movie-fied true story, with the requisite embellishments; there was a wine showdown in France in 1976 between the French and Californian wines, with the personnel headlining the movie. Until 1976, California wines were considered very low-class(I was even convinced of this fantasy), and the blind taste test which was organized was the turning point, when the world came to realize that California was not the poor relation the wine barons overseas were trying to maintain.With good acting from the other principals in the cast (including Bill Pullman as the California vintner), this was an enjoyable little movie. Alan Rickman was his stuffy best(nobody plays I'm-better-than-you as well), and Dennis Farina, in a not-very-big role, was fun - he rarely does a role I can't watch.

McCormick,"[0, 0]","For the facts in the fascinating story of the 1976 wine tasting event which laid the world of wine on its ear, read George Taber's excellent book, ""Judgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine""; for an evening's entertainment on the subject (perhaps accompanied by a glass, or two, of good California wine), watch this delightful film.This film interprets and portrays the actual events of the story in broad strokes, amplifying some details, downplaying others, and filling in between the factual events with a certain amount of interpretation for the sake of story. While valid points are made in some of the less-favorable reviews of this film concerning adherence to the facts, etc., I prefer to take this film in the spirit in which I feel it is being offered -- as an entertaining interpretation of events, and not a documentary. Alan Rickman's character is played as somewhat of a caricature -- but not to a point that I found objectionable -- and the level of contempt in which the French wine community held the rest of the world at the time is not exaggerated!Visually, this film is a tour-de-force -- the cinematography catches the Napa Valley at its best, and though one of the 1-star reviewers took exception to this, complaining that the number of scenes shot in afternoon's golden light was unrealistic, I think that one of the things that film-making is about is visual beauty. As a native Californian (Northern & Central California) I love to see the beauty of The Golden State so well portrayed.Of course, comparisons to ""Sideways"" are inevitable, though that film is more about the (completely) fictional characters than it is about wine, which is just a conduit through which the petty narrow-mindedness of Paul Giamatti's character, Miles, is projected to the viewer. The contemptible behavior of the main characters, Miles and Jack, throughout the film renders them so completely unsympathetic that (for me) it colors the enjoyment of the rest of the film.

A Brit, living and ""teaching"" in Paris, isn't quite in the inner circle of wine experts. Though he knows his juice, no one is even remotely interested in anything he might have to say. His neighboring shopkeeper is an American with big suggestions (Farina). Together they decide to host an international wine blind taste test. In 1976, in celebration of the American and French connection, they will test the rumor that California wines are actually deserving of the word wine on their labels.Alan Rickman plays the misunderstood wine snob oh so well. Amusing in his dry delivery and his new passion for his discovery that not only should California be on the wine map, but that it might turn France into the little brother of wines.A father/son vintner team (Pullman/Pine) struggle with money issues, relational garbage and the remnants of Woodstock while trying to make a few bottles of the perfect chardonnay in California. Another young man (Rodriguez), with wine in his blood and the soil of California in his soul, shoots for a red that makes men cry and women fall in love.Surprisingly clean, this film contains a few intimate scenes that mostly play out off-screen and surprisingly few curse words. I remember one F-bomb and just a smattering of the standard movie fare regulars. There is a bong scene at a party and some drunk patrons in a couple of bar scenes. But most kids aren't going to be willing to sit through the movie's quieter moments. There are some truly amusing moments, beautiful scenery and poignant scenes. Poetry pops up unexpectedly both in photography and words. Several scenes are in French with English subtitles.The movie is about the characters and contains some great acting and writing. Those who get bored with character pieces might want to pass. However, my taste runs toward ""making toast"" movies, as my daughter has dubbed it.

1215455,A39HI3CKVEXV1I,B001LPWGBY,KTFaye,"[15, 18]","It was one of those movies where I REALLY wish it had a better director and/or writer.  There was a interesting story to tell there, but the director and scriptwriters muddied it up.There are good solid performances all around.  Alan Rickman was his usual fine self as the Brit living in France who comes up with the idea of the event.  He's droll, dry, and sarcastic.  Renting the film is worth it for his performance alone.  Bill Pullman is very stoic and tightly wound as Jim Barrett, the winery owner who has staked everything he owns on the little-winery-that-could and is having a financial melt-down.  Chris Pine, dressed in classic mid-70's garb and hair, is the ne'er-do-well useless son who is finding his place in the world.  Freddy Rodriquez, a favorite of mine,  is very good as Gustavo and just about steals the story.  Dennis Farina plays himself, but ""himself"" is always an interesting guy &lt;g>The film is set at a time when all of the wineries didn't have big showrooms and didn't even charge for tastings--and wine is a whole $6 bucks a bottle!  But the basic story is a good one, and although they have fictionalized much of it, the wines were made and they did win.  Following that, a small article in Time magazine brought Napa and its wines to a wider consumer base.The problem is that the screenwriters included a fictional character to support a unnecessary fictional love story.  Also problematic is that the script actually makes the secondary characters more interesting than the lead characters.  For example, there is a secondary storyline about the winemakers assistant, Gustavo (although oddly, the winemaker who actually created the winning wine isn't even mentioned - what's with that?).  Gustavo is the son of a field hand who has been making his own wine on the side while working for Barrett.  He dreams of making wines and knows that he has to goods to deliver.  (In real life he eventually opens his own boutique winery, GustavoThrace.)  But Gustavo's story was actually more compelling than the Barrett prodigal son one, and I wish more time had been spent on it.  He also forms the third side of the love triangle and the problem is that even though he's cast as the guy who loses the girl, you can't help but feel he really should have gotten the girl (despite Chris Pine's considerable attractions &lt;g>)But of course, nobody should have gotten the girl because they didn't need the girl to tell this story in the first place; it could have stood on its own without all that.  I suppose the argument could be made the girl was representative of the female winemakers who would come to Napa, but that's a stretch.  Mostly the character is just there to get wet and add sex appeal.So it's this kind of thing where the story hits some bumps.  This is not to say it sucks, it doesn't.  As long as you're willing to accept that except for the outcome of the French tasting, it's pretty much fiction, I give it a very solid B- for entertainment value and good acting.But it could have been an A with a little more care in the direction and in the script.",4,I enjoyed this although it was an opportunity missed,1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,3093,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'REALLY', 'wish', 'had', 'better', 'director', 'and/or', 'writer', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', 'there', 'director', 'scriptwriters', 'muddied', 'are', 'good', 'solid', 'performances', 'around', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'was', 'usual', 'fine', 'self', 'Brit', 'living', 'France', 'who', 'up', 'idea', 'event', 'droll', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'Renting', 'film', 'performance', 'alone', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'very', 'stoic', 'tightly', 'wound', 'Jim', 'Barrett', 'winery', 'owner', 'who', 'staked', 'everything', 'little-winery-that-could', 'having', 'financial', 'melt-down', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'dressed', 'classic', 'mid-70', 'garb', 'hair', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'useless', 'son', 'who', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'Freddy', 'Rodriquez', 'favorite', 'mine', 'very', 'good', 'Gustavo', 'just', 'steals', 'story', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'always', 'interesting', 'guy', 'lt', '>', 'film', 'set', 'time', 'when', 'wineries', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'showrooms', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'charge', 'tastings', 'wine', 'whole', '6', 'bucks', 'bottle', 'basic', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'have', 'fictionalized', 'much', 'wines', 'were', 'made', 'did', 'win', 'Following', 'small', 'article', 'Time', 'magazine', 'brought', 'Napa', 'wines', 'wider', 'consumer', 'base.The', 'problem', 'screenwriters', 'included', 'fictional', 'character', 'support', 'unnecessary', 'fictional', 'love', 'story', 'Also', 'problematic', 'script', 'actually', 'secondary', 'characters', 'more', 'interesting', 'lead', 'characters', 'example', 'secondary', 'storyline', 'winemakers', 'assistant', 'Gustavo', 'oddly', 'winemaker', 'who', 'actually', 'created', 'winning', 'wine', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'what', 'Gustavo', 'son', 'field', 'hand', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'own', 'wine', 'side', 'working', 'Barrett', 'making', 'wines', 'goods', 'deliver', 'real', 'life', 'eventually', 'own', 'boutique', 'winery', 'GustavoThrace', 'Gustavo', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'compelling', 'Barrett', 'prodigal', 'son', 'one', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'also', 'third', 'side', 'love', 'triangle', 'problem', 'even', 'cast', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'girl', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'considerable', 'attractions', 'lt', '>', 'course', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'girl', 'tell', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'own', 'suppose', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'girl', 'was', 'representative', 'female', 'winemakers', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'Napa', 'stretch', 'Mostly', 'character', 'just', 'there', 'get', 'wet', 'add', 'sex', 'kind', 'thing', 'where', 'story', 'bumps', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'As', 'long', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'outcome', 'French', 'tasting', 'pretty', 'much', 'fiction', 'give', 'very', 'solid', 'B-', 'entertainment', 'value', 'good', 'acting.But', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'A', 'little', 'more', 'care', 'direction', 'script']",Bottle Shock

Reed ""roadrunner""","[0, 0]","This movie is loosely based on the story of a small, obscure 1976 wine tasting in Paris where several California wines (a Stags Leap cabernet and a Chateau Montelena chardonnay) literally ""shocked the world"" by beating the French. This movie focuses on the British entrepreneur (a wine merchant and educator in Paris) who put the competition together and the father-son team that ran the Montelena operation.I have to admit I was a little nervous about the idea of Alan Rickman playing the Brit -- I've liked him in some movies and found him kind of unctuous in others. He was pitch-perfect in this one.I was also a little nervous about this cute story getting the ""Hollywood"" treatment. I bumped into this story by accident shortly after the wine-tasting when I visited a friend in San Francisco who was one of those ""this is the best unknown restaurant in town"" types. We spent a day in Napa and amidst stops at Mondavi and a few of the big ones, he told me the story of the tasting and we stopped and took a look at the Stag's Leap operation (too small, of course, for a tasting room, but the proprietor was friendly and showed us around). In short, I've always been charmed by this story and was worried that the movie would hype it too much.Well, there was a little of that, I'm sure, including a lot of father-son drama that I'm sure the producers invented.

Rickman plays an Englishman living in Paris.  This Englishman has a wine store there, which needless to say is not a financial success.  Not so much because this gentlemen does not know his wine, but because, when it comes to wine, French rely only on their own to make recommendations on what the good wine is (yes - they are wine snobs).This all changes when one day a word gets out that California's Napa Valley has some pretty good wines that match France in their quality.  Before long, the competition starts between two great countries on who produces superior wine.  It is 1976 and it is a historical event.  In a blind wine tasting competition preseided by all French jurors California wine wins the competition!  This historical event made a change in a way world perceives wine.

Alan Rickman is a fine actor but his cliche' of a snobby British man living in Paris who has trouble selling his wines might have worked. Unfortunately, we then get to know the rest of the cast including a terrible 70's parody of Chris Pine in a weave, yes, a weave (I guess being the big up and coming bad boy had him in demand too much for him to take a few months to actually grow his hair out) pretending very broadly at being the prodigal son to a rather stoic Bill Pullman. The British wine expert goes to Napa Valley California to see if his moocher pal, played by Dennis Farina, is right about the growing quality of California wines.There's more to this trip, not the least of which is that this is very loosely based on an actual event where the wines gathered in Napa are brought to France to compete in a blind taste test against French wine and some of the Napa brands are selected as superior.Great premise, right? After all we have the Doobie Bros. providing the soundtrack, the incredible Napa Valley setting, the great and always (and still again) wasted Freddy Rodriguez actually looks like he's getting the girl as well as proving what a great vintner his character's become.........and still, this hatchet job, waste of a film manages to curdle my cheese so many times it had to become laughable in order for me to finish it. And not humorously so, just so bad and predictable that I spent over half the film broadcasting what was going to happen next (the accuracy not so hard to manage with laughs all around).Freddy manages to get this film the one star it deserves and the setting nudges it up another star but I'm being much too nice to this movie because the negatives really wipe those stars out.

Schwartz,"[5, 7]","The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world.  The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena.  To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.

I myself am not a wine connoisseur, however that did not diminish my enjoyment of this film one iota.  This film only added to my ever growing enjoyment of independent films over the all flash and no substance of the big budget Hollywood films.Alan Rickman, Dennis Farina, and Bill Pullman are the crowd pleasers here.  Their characters are witty, charming and endearing in their own respective ways.  Rickman's and Farina's characters bring a great amount of humor to the screen as a Parisian wine shop owner and his somewhat Philistine but always loyal American customer.  As always, the moments that Rickman is on the screen are the most enjoyable moments of the film, and are a pleasure to savor.  Bill Pullman also succeeded in this film as being someone that you wanted to root for - it is one of the best roles I have seen him in.The only weak point of the film, in my opinion were the actors playing the younger characters.  They were rather lackluster - typical of most young actors.  They don't possess screen presence, nor the talent to hold your attention.  I got the feeling they were just reading their lines.  Luckily though, their scenes pass quickly and then it's on to the better actors in the film.On the whole, I found the movie to be quite good.  The story was fascinating and amusing.

I was finally able to view it recently on DVD and the only reason I even bothered was because of Alan Rickman. The man can do no wrong-acting wise. He can turn a movie with a not-so-interesting topic and make it funny and enjoyable for two hours.Unfortunately, Rickman is not in the movie for 2 hours, just here and there. But when he's on, he's spot on. You can't fake that type of humour and you can't really call it acting. It just is. He is a master at it and can do it in his sleep.The rest of the cast is somewhat bland and has nothing to do. Bill Pullman does what he can in a boring role and the younger cast feels wasted. If you love everything about wine, you'll probably like this film alot. If you are indifferent, like I was, well...I probably would not have watched this if Alan Rickman was not in it.Supposedly, though based on actual events, the film version is sketchy and not 100% faithful so you can't even go by that.
