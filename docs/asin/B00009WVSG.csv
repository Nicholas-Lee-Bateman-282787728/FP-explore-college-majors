But here's what I say. Robby Benson, Hassidic Jew, whacking the bejesus out of a baseball. That's one of the films earliest images, and it's a thing of beauty. The other boy is the narrator, and I love everything about this movie. Talented cast, great writing, great story, great dialogue, everything done as it should be done.The time frame is around World War II and the establishment of a Jewish state, but that's in the background. It's a source of friction between the two families, one Orthodox Jew and one Hassidic Jew, but it's not in your face like all the other well-meaning Holocaust movies that bludgeon you into submission. It's such an important subject that I think many of us are willing to forgive ham-handed handling of it. But this film does it right.I love this film. I love everything about it. I'm so pleased I can say that about at least one Hollywood movie this week. I will watch it again, and I thought very hard about using it in a classroom. But alas, I don't know enough about Judaism to do it justice from the standpoint of ""Mr. Teacher Guy."" If you are Jewish, and you teach in China, go find this. Heck, even if you're a Gentile in the USA who will never teach, go find this. This is why we watch movies, folks.

759050,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00009WVSG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","&#8216;The Chosen&#8217; is a very well made film that explores culture, tradition, friendship and family in ways that enlighten as well as emotionally connect.  While I am not Jewish and am not entirely familiar with many of the traditions explored in this film, the human element is very strong and makes it easy to find yourself engaged from frame to frame.  The story takes place in the 40&#8217;s and tells of two young men growing up in Brooklyn who are from opposite ends of their religion.  Young Reuven is living a more modern life with his father, who happens to be a professor.  After a run in on the baseball diamond with Danny, who is orthodox Hasidic, Reuven&#8217;s eyes begin to open, as do Danny&#8217;s, as they explore each other&#8217;s lives through an unlikely friendship that blossoms over time.  The real force in their lives is easily the influence of their fathers, and while Reuven begins to question Danny&#8217;s strict upbringing, a beautiful moment at the film&#8217;s end between the two boys and Danny&#8217;s father Reb is the highlight of the film, and really moved me to tears (Steiger is remarkable here).  I highly recommend this film, for it is historically informative and features some very strong performances (and that score) that only heighten the enjoyment.  I wish that the relationship between the boys was fleshed out as deeply as the one&#8217;s between them and their fathers, but it&#8217;s a nitpick at this point.",4,"Tradition, culture and Rod Steiger&#8230;",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1466,"['8216', 'Chosen', '8217', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'culture', 'tradition', 'friendship', 'family', 'ways', 'enlighten', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'am', 'not', 'Jewish', 'am', 'not', 'entirely', 'familiar', 'many', 'traditions', 'explored', 'film', 'human', 'element', 'very', 'strong', 'easy', 'find', 'engaged', 'frame', 'frame', 'story', 'place', '40', '8217', 's', 'tells', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'growing', 'up', 'Brooklyn', 'who', 'are', 'opposite', 'ends', 'religion', 'Young', 'Reuven', 'living', 'more', 'modern', 'life', 'father', 'who', 'be', 'professor', 'run', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'Danny', 'who', 'orthodox', 'Hasidic', 'Reuven', '8217', 's', 'eyes', 'begin', 'open', 'do', 'Danny', '8217', 's', 'explore', 'other', '8217', 's', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'time', 'real', 'force', 'lives', 'easily', 'influence', 'fathers', 'Reuven', 'question', 'Danny', '8217', 'strict', 'upbringing', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'film', '8217', 's', 'end', 'two', 'boys', 'Danny', '8217', 'Reb', 'highlight', 'film', 'really', 'moved', 'tears', 'Steiger', 'remarkable', 'here', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'historically', 'informative', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'score', 'only', 'heighten', 'enjoyment', 'wish', 'relationship', 'boys', 'was', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'deeply', 'one', '8217', 'fathers', '8217', 's', 'nitpick', 'point']",The Chosen

759056,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00009WVSG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","THE CHOSEN (1981) cannot possibly be compared to any other Jewish-oriented film. YENTL does not even come close.THE CHOSEN was directed by Jeremy Kagan, best known for his film BY THE SWORD and usually a TV director. Adapted from the great Chaim Potok's novel, this film explores first the absolute fact of American Jewry in the late 1940s; it probes deeply the animosity as well as the true union between Jews like the Hasidim and the average ""modern"" Orthodox Jew. It is set in New York, and I guess all this makes the film seem a bit 'specialty'--unless you already have some idea of the world it portrays.The beautiful Robbie Benson (Danny Saunders) is the local rebbe's son, a gangly baseball player with a mean swing. He befriends Reuven Malter (equally lovely Barry Miller, FLAWLESS) and they end up attending Hirsch College together. I think I want to pause and say the film does not shy from the love between these two boys, though the film has nothing to do with sexuality. I sometimes weep even today, at two scenes: the newsreels of the NAZI camps, and the reunion scene of the two boys after a period of estrangement.The Rebbe Saunders (immortal Rod Steiger in his most powerful role) is grooming Danny to be rebbe one day. This film touches me deeply also because the rebbe ultimately apologizes to his son for the way he raised him. He also lets his son go...and it's off to Columbia U. for Danny to study psychology. The rebbe feels the prison-like confines of his own life and at the last moment spares Danny the same fate. You don't hear much about that kind of 'dynasty-breaking' in Hasidism today! This film may not power the point home, but it is clear the world is changing because the rebbe's son will become a psychologist. The Zionist freethinking professor's son will be the rabbi.Saying which, the equally immortal Maximilian Schell plays Reuven's father, Professor David Malter--Orthodox but very Zionist, very prolific in the establishment of Israel. The rebbe does not like that, nor does he like what Prof. Malter writes about Judaism. The film gives a clue of the Orthodoxy of the Malters because at a crucial point, Danny informs Reuven that his father has ""excommunicated"" both Reuven and Prof. Malter. This wounds Reuven deeply.I was surprised and happy to see my friend Rabbi Yonassan Gershom's review, though he seemed to be reviewing the book as much as the film--excellent critique of the way the film measured up to the book. However, I disagree that the film is ""dumbed down"". This was literally the beginning of the ""Jewish Movement"" (my term) in film that lasted exactly four years, after which no Jewish movies were made. Only decades later was 'the Jewish cinema silence' broken by the grotesque HEBREW HAMMER. There is no way THE CHOSEN could have been more faithful to Potok's great work. And I doubt audiences care how Orthodox the Malters are. The adaptation is brilliant.What really gets me today is how relevant and touching the film is. With the fighting among Jews, a sour state of affairs I have suffered from time to time myself, I love the quiet stillness of this film and the healing friendship between Danny and Reuven. It also addresses Zionism directly, and I suspect the film wants to reflect that in a more modern way than Potok originally did.Audiences cheered--I recall this vividly--at the scene when the radio announces the U.N. adoption of Israel as a State. Not as many cheer it today, I think. Yet there you have Danny and Reuven, both determined to go out and change the world. That they are friends and will remain so is the vital thing that must be the lesson taken from this movie.My deeply personal comment goes with my kudos to Robbie Benson. This young Dallas-born boy whose real name is Robin Segal says he went straight into entertainment from the womb. He was a hero and pin-up boy for some of us back in the early 1980s. From his debut in ODE TO BILLY JOE to his controversial role in ICE CASTLES (everyone said he was gay after that role), he was a perennial favorite and all-around sweetie pie for exactly 8 years. Since around 1988 until recently, he was a beloved, honored professor of film at NYU Tisch School of the Arts.All that is stated because I love Robbie Benson and I also feel--perhaps wrongly--that he was 'chased' off the silver screen for some reason. At one time, he was one of the most disliked actors and I don't get that either. Whether it was bad luck, persecution or a personal choice, Benson vanished from the movies and I miss the hell out of him. So don't miss him here, in one of his most powerful performances, in a classic film.",5,"Robbie Benson looks good in a Huckle hat, sidelocks and beard",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,4637,"['CHOSEN', '1981', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'Jewish-oriented', 'film', 'YENTL', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close.THE', 'CHOSEN', 'was', 'directed', 'Jeremy', 'Kagan', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'BY', 'THE', 'SWORD', 'usually', 'TV', 'director', 'Adapted', 'great', 'Chaim', 'Potok', 'novel', 'film', 'first', 'absolute', 'fact', 'American', 'Jewry', 'late', '1940s', 'deeply', 'animosity', 'as', 'well', 'true', 'union', 'Jews', 'Hasidim', 'average', 'modern', 'Orthodox', 'Jew', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'guess', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'already', 'have', 'idea', 'world', 'beautiful', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'Danny', 'Saunders', 'local', 'rebbe', 'son', 'gangly', 'baseball', 'player', 'mean', 'swing', 'Reuven', 'Malter', 'equally', 'lovely', 'Barry', 'Miller', 'FLAWLESS', 'end', 'up', 'attending', 'Hirsch', 'College', 'together', 'think', 'want', 'pause', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'love', 'two', 'boys', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'sexuality', 'sometimes', 'weep', 'even', 'today', 'two', 'scenes', 'newsreels', 'NAZI', 'camps', 'reunion', 'scene', 'two', 'boys', 'period', 'estrangement.The', 'Rebbe', 'Saunders', 'immortal', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'most', 'powerful', 'role', 'grooming', 'Danny', 'be', 'rebbe', 'one', 'day', 'film', 'deeply', 'also', 'rebbe', 'ultimately', 'son', 'way', 'raised', 'also', 'son', 'go', 'Columbia', 'U.', 'Danny', 'study', 'psychology', 'rebbe', 'prison-like', 'confines', 'own', 'life', 'last', 'moment', 'spares', 'Danny', 'same', 'fate', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'kind', ""'dynasty-breaking"", 'Hasidism', 'today', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'power', 'point', 'home', 'clear', 'world', 'changing', 'rebbe', 'son', 'will', 'become', 'psychologist', 'Zionist', 'freethinking', 'professor', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'rabbi.Saying', 'equally', 'immortal', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Reuven', 'father', 'Professor', 'David', 'Malter', 'Orthodox', 'very', 'Zionist', 'very', 'prolific', 'establishment', 'Israel', 'rebbe', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'Prof.', 'Malter', 'Judaism', 'film', 'clue', 'Orthodoxy', 'Malters', 'crucial', 'point', 'Danny', 'Reuven', 'father', 'excommunicated', 'Reuven', 'Prof.', 'Malter', 'Reuven', 'deeply.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'happy', 'see', 'friend', 'Rabbi', 'Yonassan', 'Gershom', 'review', 'seemed', 'be', 'reviewing', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'excellent', 'critique', 'way', 'film', 'measured', 'up', 'book', 'However', 'disagree', 'film', 'dumbed', 'down', 'was', 'literally', 'beginning', 'Jewish', 'Movement', 'term', 'film', 'lasted', 'exactly', 'four', 'years', 'Jewish', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'Only', 'later', 'was', ""'the"", 'Jewish', 'cinema', 'silence', 'broken', 'grotesque', 'HEBREW', 'HAMMER', 'way', 'THE', 'CHOSEN', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'faithful', 'Potok', 'great', 'work', 'doubt', 'audiences', 'care', 'how', 'Orthodox', 'Malters', 'are', 'adaptation', 'brilliant.What', 'really', 'today', 'how', 'relevant', 'touching', 'film', 'fighting', 'Jews', 'sour', 'state', 'affairs', 'have', 'suffered', 'time', 'time', 'love', 'quiet', 'stillness', 'film', 'healing', 'friendship', 'Danny', 'Reuven', 'also', 'Zionism', 'directly', 'suspect', 'film', 'reflect', 'more', 'modern', 'way', 'Potok', 'originally', 'cheered', 'recall', 'vividly', 'scene', 'when', 'radio', 'U.N.', 'adoption', 'Israel', 'State', 'Not', 'many', 'cheer', 'today', 'think', 'have', 'Danny', 'Reuven', 'determined', 'go', 'out', 'change', 'world', 'are', 'friends', 'will', 'remain', 'so', 'vital', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'lesson', 'taken', 'movie.My', 'personal', 'comment', 'kudos', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'young', 'Dallas-born', 'boy', 'real', 'name', 'Robin', 'Segal', 'went', 'straight', 'entertainment', 'womb', 'was', 'hero', 'pin-up', 'boy', 'back', 'early', '1980s', 'debut', 'ODE', 'TO', 'BILLY', 'JOE', 'controversial', 'role', 'ICE', 'CASTLES', 'everyone', 'said', 'was', 'gay', 'role', 'was', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'all-around', 'sweetie', 'pie', 'exactly', '8', 'years', '1988', 'recently', 'was', 'beloved', 'honored', 'professor', 'film', 'NYU', 'Tisch', 'School', 'Arts.All', 'stated', 'love', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'also', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'wrongly', 'was', ""'chased"", 'silver', 'screen', 'reason', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disliked', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'bad', 'luck', 'persecution', 'personal', 'choice', 'Benson', 'vanished', 'movies', 'miss', 'hell', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'here', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', 'classic', 'film']",The Chosen

759058,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00009WVSG,Gregor von Kallahann,"[8, 9]","A book discussion group I participate in read Chaim Potok's THE CHOSEN a few months back.  Since the majority of the group were non-Jews themselves, most of them found the novel fascinating in its portrayal of the complexities of American Jewish life in the 1940s and '50s.  Many were unaware, for instance, that there was a segment of the Jewish community that was opposed to Zionism on religious grounds.I imagine that many non-Jewish--and maybe even some younger non-religious Jewish viewers of the 1981 film version of THE CHOSEN will find its take on Jewish life in New York equally striking.  To that extent, director Jeremy Paul Kagan and screenwriter Edwin Gordon have succeeded.  The film is a pretty effective introduction to a world that many Americans know next to nothing about.But admirers of the book will likely still be disappointed in the screen adaptation.  You can't call it heavy-handed exactly, but the film version ultimately can't do justice to the book's complex depiction of a tentative rapprochement between two wildly divergent Jewish sects in the form of an often rocky but nonetheless enduring friendship between two bright but very different teenagers.  It also can only begin to suggest the significant influence of both boys' fathers and how these two men engage in a dialog of sorts through their sons.Getting all that into 120 minutes of screentime would have been no mean feat, of course.  The filmmakers do what they can, given the limits of their medium.  And the actors do what they can to convey the complexities of their characters' emotional AND intellectual lives.  Old pros Maximilian Schell and Rod Steiger turn in strong performances, and Barry Miller and Robbie Benson (surprise!) are remarkable as the young Jewish boys trying to make sense of a rapidly changing world. It makes for worthwhile viewing, but fans of the novel may still find themselves wanting more.  But how DO you dramatize the plight of a boy raised in silence, anyway?I imagine that my friends from the book group would find at least one of the film's ""enhancements"" to be something of an improvement, however.  A number of women in the group were understandably disappointed in the near total lack of visibility of the book's few female characters.  They're there, but then they're not there, fleetingly seen, but ONLY fleetingly.  And they are almost never heard from.  Given the culture and the times, this is not surprising.  And the lack of any strong female characters in the novel is a valid artistic choice on the author's part.But when, in the film, our young non-Hassid hero Reuven develops a crush on his Hassidic friend's sister, the filmmakers had no choice but to give her a bit of screen time and at least a few seconds of dialog.  And of course, that same mini-subplot gives her concerned Mama a chance to come to the fore herself and insinuate herself into the male-dominated plotline.  It's nice that in the film version, there are these hints of what life is like for the female characters that were almost totally lacking in the novel.And that's one of the things that film can do well--quickly establish a character by a few gestures, a revealing look or a scrap of dialog.

He admits that Potok said to him that it is the best ""interpretation"" of his novel. The book focuses on the differences between a very conservative Chassidic family and one that is Modern Orthodox. The first insists upon accepting the literal words of the Torah, the second examines it in a scientific and rational manner. The film and the book both raised an unresolved question in my mind. Despite this, the film is very enjoyable.Potok has the Chassidic rabbi raise his son in silence. He refuses to speak to him. In the movie, he explains that he noticed that his son was brilliant and had a photographic memory, what is also called total recall, he could speed read a book and then recite it back to you. The rabbi said that he feared that his son would grow up arrogant. He would be unable to feel the pain of normal human beings. So to teach him about pain, he inflicted pain upon him by not speaking to him.

The two boys form an unusual respect and friendship amidst their incredibly different cultures,and yet both are able to transcend both and forge a bond that will be tested amidst paternal disruptions and the end of WW2.THE CHOSEN is an intimate film,evenly paced and features truly exquisite acting from the four principle actors.Each character is well developed and reaches an epiphany,which makes for pleasant viewing where everyone learns something.The revelations are numerous and cut deeply into the minds and souls of each character.NOTE: The author of the book,Chaim Potok, worked very closely with the production of this film and cameos as one of the Talmudic Teachers!The only other film that deals with Hasidism that I would suggest isA Life Apart - Hasidism in Americaand to a certain degreeUshpizin.To learn more about the conflict and the founding of the Israeli State and the conflict with the Arabs, I highly recommend the PBS documentaryArab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land, which adds great dimension to the Zionist vs. Hasidic view of the Jewish State as mentioned in THE CHOSEN.",5,"EXCELLENT DVD TRANSFER!

Stars Robbie Benson and Rod Steiger. I saw this film on PBS channel 28. The Jewish soul ofthis film shines through beautifully and sadly, effectively using Hassidic clothing and glimpses of the lifestyle, which isoddly at variance with the rapidly modernizing New York City of the World War II Era. Robby Benson delivers a fine performanceas the American young man who befriends a Hassidic Jew and assimilates the Jewish lifestyle. Their friendship is rocky at best. His Jewish friend has been raised by a strict father whoupholds the traditonal and orthodox way of life (he's even got him engaged to another Jewish girl)ad shuns modern thinking. He is against the Zionist movement which sought to make Israel its own free state, but the Father in this film believes only God and his Messiah can deliver them. Never has a movie been more embracing of the Jewish faith and old traditions than this movie.Hebrew music is authentically used. The overwhelming sadness and horror hits you when they feature clips from the slaughter of thousands of Jews in the Holocaust during Hitler's Nazi regime in Europe.With a sad, reflective mood and a long run of time, this film does seem to be straight from the equally long novel. But it's a great film and I recommend anyone who is a fan of Potok or Robby Benson the actor. The relationship between the boys and the difference between their fathers- one father is old-fashioned and fiery while the other is peaceful, but modern. It's a look at the difference between the two distinct worlds. In the end, the Jewish boy who always wanted to practice psychiatry, is allowed by a father who finally consents. It's a moving and poignant film. The acting and the script, lifted from the book, is quite good. Why did'nt this get any recognition in the Oscars of 1982 ? Or did it ?

The movie presents the tensions between various Jewish sub groups, along with a healthy dose of Father-Son relationships, the battle between religion in general and the world. The acting is superb - Rod Steiger is just great, Maximilian Schell also - who would not want either of them as a father - but for different reasons. Beneath it all is a very human story of how human beings cope with the world around them - and remain the warm beautiful people that they are. The people in the movie have much to teach the world if the world will accept God and His peace. To all my non-Jewish friends; watch this movie and learn.",5,Understand on many levels - all good,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,740,"['am', 'traditional', 'Catholic', 'looking', 'many', 'ways', 'understanding', 'Orthodox', 'Jewish', 'position', 'Hasidism', 'movie', 'tensions', 'various', 'Jewish', 'sub', 'groups', 'healthy', 'dose', 'Father-Son', 'relationships', 'battle', 'religion', 'general', 'world', 'acting', 'superb', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'just', 'great', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'also', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'either', 'father', 'different', 'reasons', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'cope', 'world', 'remain', 'warm', 'beautiful', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'movie', 'have', 'much', 'teach', 'world', 'world', 'will', 'accept', 'God', 'peace', 'non-Jewish', 'friends', 'watch', 'movie', 'learn']",The Chosen
759072,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,B00009WVSG,The Night Falcon,"[4, 4]","It's been a long time since I've viewed this Robby Benson film.  I loved it when I first saw it.  I grew up in a catholic home where going to Church every Sunday was mandatory.  I attended catholic grade school, high school and college.  As I approached 18, I started to meet others of different faiths which I found very enriching given the particular perspective I was given growing up under the teachings of the nuns, priests and brothers who taught me.What I loved about this film was the contrast presented of mind sets between Robby Benson's character, Danny Saunders, and Barry Miller's character, Reuven.  I was about the same age as these two fellows in the film when it was made.  Both actors are not only good looking men to watch, but their chemistry of interaction is magnetic when you watch this script played out based on Chaim Potok's best selling novel.  Since this takes place in the 1940's with WWII in the works, the tension between the Jewish community and the world is felt and seen only all too clearly, but so is their wonderful culture and their way of thinking which makes this film a post WWII peace ruling tool in my view.  The then tensions in the world is only all too well played out between Danny and Reuven which reduces the greater political trials of the world down to terms all of us can understand.For these reasons I wanted this film in my library.  The character development is excellent.  Some scenes could have been more developed by today's standards, but it is nevertheless an excellent story with a great message of love behind it.The DVD case came in great condition along with the slip covers.  Would have been nice to have the film cover burned onto the disk so I could tell which side goes face down, which I fixed my sticking a label on the side that faces up with the title of the film on the label: No big deal. Good value for the money.
