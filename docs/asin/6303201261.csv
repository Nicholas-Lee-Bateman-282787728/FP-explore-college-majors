Wei Wei needs a ""Green Card"" to stay in the U.S., and Wei Tung needs a fake marriage to stop his parents from trying to find him a wife.It wouldn't be such a big deal if Wei Tung's parents decide not to come to congratulate their son.  Now they have to fake a wedding and living together.  Simon becomes their landlord.  Everyone is trying to compromise.  Everyone is trying to finish the ""act"" and go on their own lives. But is it as easy as they thought?  The wedding itself is a perfect demonstration of melting pot culture.  But at the end of the banquet there is a little twist.  Now what's gonna happen? Is everything still fake?This movie reveals the conflict between traditional Chinese culture and independent American culture, the different aspects in sexuality and morality, and different concept of family, love and honesty.  How hard is it for one to survive in a society with other kinds (being either a foreigner or a gay) and being accepted?  You will find it out through laugher, tears, heartbreaks and strong wills.

Back in the early 90's PC was at it's peak, in addition gay was inextricably linked to AIDS.  So imagine my shock when I go to see this movie, a hilarious, touching, movie that gives a wonderfully accurate view of one gay relationship.  A couple, one American, one from Taiwan have been together in NYC for years.  The Taiwanese man's parents do not know he is gay so keep trying to sign him up for membership in all of these very expensive singles clubs.  One of the best scenes is when he and his boyfriend are filling out the application and putting down traits his ideal woman that they think will be impossible to fullfill, ""two PHD's, an Opera Singer, speaks 7 languages, ect..""  It gets even better when the letter from his parents arrives saying ""We've found her""  This could have degenerated into a slapstick movie, especially when the parents want to come out to NYC, to throw their son a wedding but it was a Superbly done movie that kept you laughing all the way through.  If you have loved any of Ang Lee's Other movies, Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Draggon, Eat Drink Man Woman, you will wonder how you've gone so long without seeing this gem.

362511,A1P2KRAMSBR1RR,6303201261,David Alston,"[7, 7]","I first saw the WEDDING BANQUET upon initial release, and I revisited it again recently.  A bit more sophisticated in its' human observations, it's a film that has grown stronger with time's passage.Lee emerged as an independent filmmaker (an alum of NYU, along with the likes of Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch, who also emerged from the school during the 1980s), and his earliest films were a great indication that independent filmmaking could tackle complex themes, surpassing Hollywood standards, and still connect meaningfully with audiences.Lee also may be ahead of his time as a globally focused filmmaker - also evident here.  With an unusual knack for balancing cultural specifics (and how they fit into individual lives), and broader universal elements, Lee handles cultural clashes, and assimilation wonderfully - WEDDING BANQUET features some of the most entertaining riffs on such themes (the justice of the peace wedding scene is definitely a classic comic moment) to have graced the big screen.  To varying degrees, these themes have surfaced in some fashion in all of Lee's films (also notably in EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, and it's US remake TORTILLA SOUP); here they are at their most charming.Overall this film was marketed as something like a gay-themed update on the classic Hollywood ""screwball comedy"" genre, which it isn't exactly - WEDDING BANQUET moves at a slower pace, and has its' share of humor, but also offers an abundance of very thoughtfully crafted drama.  Like EAT DRINK (and also ICE STORM), Lee is very skilled at shaping relationships, and zeroing in on poignant insights within even the bad moments, and in many ways this film stands as one of his finest.-David Alston",4,A great relationship film and much more,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1697,"['first', 'saw', 'WEDDING', 'BANQUET', 'initial', 'release', 'revisited', 'again', 'recently', 'bit', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'human', 'observations', 'film', 'grown', 'stronger', 'time', 'passage.Lee', 'emerged', 'independent', 'filmmaker', 'alum', 'NYU', 'likes', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'who', 'also', 'emerged', 'school', '1980s', 'earliest', 'films', 'were', 'great', 'indication', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'could', 'tackle', 'complex', 'themes', 'surpassing', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'still', 'connect', 'meaningfully', 'audiences.Lee', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'ahead', 'time', 'globally', 'focused', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'evident', 'here', 'unusual', 'knack', 'balancing', 'cultural', 'specifics', 'how', 'fit', 'individual', 'lives', 'broader', 'universal', 'elements', 'Lee', 'cultural', 'clashes', 'assimilation', 'wonderfully', 'WEDDING', 'BANQUET', 'most', 'entertaining', 'riffs', 'such', 'themes', 'justice', 'peace', 'wedding', 'scene', 'definitely', 'classic', 'comic', 'moment', 'have', 'graced', 'big', 'screen', 'varying', 'degrees', 'themes', 'have', 'surfaced', 'fashion', 'Lee', 'films', 'also', 'notably', 'EAT', 'DRINK', 'MAN', 'WOMAN', 'US', 'remake', 'TORTILLA', 'SOUP', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'charming.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'something', 'gay-themed', 'update', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'genre', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'WEDDING', 'BANQUET', 'slower', 'pace', 'share', 'humor', 'also', 'abundance', 'very', 'thoughtfully', 'crafted', 'drama', 'EAT', 'DRINK', 'also', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'Lee', 'very', 'skilled', 'shaping', 'relationships', 'zeroing', 'poignant', 'insights', 'even', 'bad', 'moments', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'one', 'finest.-David', 'Alston']",The Wedding Banquet VHS
362512,A342YAXL116N5A,6303201261,Dennis!,"[2, 2]","""The Wedding Banquet"" is one of the first films I saw in American mainstream that had as its main plot vehicle a gay Asian-American man and the conflicting pressures that places on him.  This movie is funny and touching in its all-too-realistic depiction of Gao Wei-Tung's protracted attempts to please his parents and hide his sexuality (and, indeed, his lover).The movie takes a few more tosses and twists than it needs to, however:  I could have done well without the extra plot line that gets thrown in after the wedding night (and you know what I mean)... because that then just throws in the complications of further sexual dynamics which weren't necessary for a full resolution of the familial disharmony.In any event, though, the movie is a definite keeper and well worth watching.

362514,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303201261,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Since XI YAN [THE WEDDING BANQUET] is not in my dvd library, I rejoiced at having the chance to watch it again. As some reviews have expressed, I saw this when it was new and it really packed a punch back then. When I see it now, it packs a bigger punch than ever. And that is Ang Lee for you...he wrote, produced and directed this 1993 offering--his finest early work and winner of Best Foreign Film Oscar.Wai Tung Gao (a gorgeous and hilarious Winston Chan) is successful, rich, cute, and...taken. His boyfriend Simon (a sexy and equally talented Mitchell Lichtenstein) and he live a closely bound, deeply loving life together. Simon is a physical therapist and I cannot say I ever figured out what Wai does--but he owns a building with an eccentric squatter tenant, Wei-Wei (sumptuous and amazing Mary Chin). Everyone is more or less happy...Wei-Wei has given up trying to seduce Wai, and he allows her to live in the building in exchange for her expressionist paintings.All's well, until Ma and Pa Gao (the fantastic Ah-Leh Gua and incredible master Sihung Lung) finally get a lucky strike in their matchmaking efforts back in Taiwan. After faking his 'ideal girl' for years, Wai is forced to meet a gal who finally measures up...she visits him in Manhattan and while he worries about his life, she tells him she doesn't know what to do about her white boyfriend.Seems everyone is up China Creek in this film, and Wai's folks are about to pay a visit that will change them all. Or at least provide a paddle.There is only one film in history I can find to compare to this: 1989's LONGTIME COMPANION, which no doubt inspired Lee. With this film, Ang Lee set a true tone for all gay films to follow. No one seemed to have been able to match this side-splitting yet moving gay-Chinese-culture-clash-hide-it-from-the-parents story!Everything is illustrated in a scene with Wai and Simon, struggling not to be seen, running up the stairs, simultaneously undressing each other and necking--it is so touching and so damned funny, I laugh out loud and shed a tear each time. (I'm not even sure why I cry at that scene.) As indicated, there is no nudity in this film other than what I call natural brief nudity (it's Mary Chin we see, not Winston Chao or Mitchell Lichtenstein).Ah-Leh Gua as Mrs. Gao is very talented, and handles her huge task better than any actress I've seen. The immortal master Sihung Lung turns in a subtle, sweet yet strong performance as old Mr. Gao. I just love Sihung Lung--I grew up watching him play villains and heroes, and he doesn't disappoint in any of his three Ang Lee films (PUSHING HANDS, EAT, DRINK, MAN, WOMAN and this film).At an hour and forty minutes, this film packs a lifetime into your heart. I guarantee you will learn lessons in tolerance and understanding which you never thought possible.Everyone performs to perfection, the shooting/editing is masterful, and the silent moments are rich, deep, meditative. Lee adds some food into the story, as always, as if it were a character in itself. Only a handful of silent moments has a Keatonesque humor--I've always said fans don't understand Buster Keaton.

362515,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6303201261,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[5, 5]","Ang Lee creatively uses the conventional social mores and cultural behaviors associated with a traditional Taiwanese family along with their expectations of a good life for their number one son and compares and clashes them with the modern gay lifestyle which the son has kept secret from his family. This is one major comedy where surprises and deception continually arise to keep the viewer laughing and enjoying the events that unfold throughout. The film is jam packed with subtle and direct playful scenes by the director which reveal Chinese cultural expectations for a proper married life which contrasts with the freedom of expression (both verbal and sexual) allowed and experienced in the West. Ang Lee shows the viewer he is sympathetic to both sides of the issue. His film is outstanding and unique. It is a one-of-a-kind film which only a person of his background and understanding could have made.Gao Wai Tung (the number one Chinese son) arranges a marriage of convenience at the suggestion his lover of over 5 years, Simon, to help out a female artist, Wei Wei from Taiwan, just so she can attain the green card to stay in the USA. When his parents hear of their only son's marriage, they arrive in New York and are highly disappointed with the arrangements the couple made for a civil ceremony. They plan an elaborate wedding celebration which is filled with  numerous comedic twists and turns that revolve around the secrets and deception associated with their son's gay lifestyle. A Taiwanese/Chinese wedding is filled with hilarity and games and the married couple must go along with it all ... The biggest surprise is when Wei Wei announces to Gao Wai that she is pregnant. A grandchild is one of the most cherised gifts that Chinese parents look forward to from their offspring, yet this unexpected outcome of a drunken wedding night complicates the lives of both the gay couple and Wei Wei in unimaginable ways. This surprise creates the need for more deception and secrets that must be kept from Gai Wai Tung's parents. It is an amazing set of events that transpire which helps resolve this major dilemma in an already complicated state of affairs. Ang Lee manages to wrap up the ending to this film in a most satisfying manner with more surprises than any viewer could possibly anticipate! This is one hilarious comedy on a highly unusual but modern subject. Ang Lee managed to break down barriers, plus enlighten and entertain all at the same time!

There's also a happy ending which is realistic enough to be satisfying and not too fairy-tale like.  What I'd really like is a DVD of this movie, with some extra's.  Maybe a commentary?  Some interviews with the actors?

I didn't realize that he had directed films as varied in theme as &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, both of which are excellent films.  In some respects, I found &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; to be the most accessible and intimate of his films that I have seen.  It's certainly the most humorous.The plot has been summarized by other reviewers, and in lesser hands it could easily have turned the film into a cliche.  Given that the film appeared in the early 1990's, it could also have look dated to viewers in 2004.  However, this film is not dated and it's not a cliche.  Instead, it's a warm-hearted (but never maudlin) look at the importance of family, cultural heritage, and the difficulty of leading a hidden life, even when your relatives live on the other side of the world.Much of the dialogue is Chinese (with English subtitles), but this is one of those rare films where I quickly became accustomed to the subtitles and they did not interfere at all with my enjoyment of the movie.  The fact that the Chinese characters actually spoke Chinese made the film more believable.Ang Lee's talent for visual composition is apparent throughout the movie.  It's filled with scenes of real beauty, which is not always the case with comedies.  Too often, movie comedies are shot as if they were widescreen TV sitcoms.  That's not the case here.  The production values are consistently high, so much so that I was surprised to discover during the DVD featurette that it was a low-budget film.This film is fun to watch, with excellent acting and outstanding direction.",5,Outstanding,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,1668,"['first', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'quot', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'directed', 'films', 'varied', 'theme', 'quot', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'quot', 'are', 'excellent', 'films', 'respects', 'found', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'Banquet', 'quot', 'be', 'most', 'accessible', 'intimate', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'most', 'humorous.The', 'plot', 'been', 'summarized', 'other', 'reviewers', 'lesser', 'hands', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'turned', 'film', 'cliche', 'Given', 'film', 'appeared', 'early', '1990', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'look', 'dated', 'viewers', '2004', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'dated', 'not', 'cliche', 'Instead', 'warm-hearted', 'never', 'maudlin', 'look', 'importance', 'family', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'difficulty', 'leading', 'hidden', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'relatives', 'live', 'other', 'side', 'world.Much', 'dialogue', 'Chinese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'quickly', 'became', 'accustomed', 'subtitles', 'did', 'not', 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'fact', 'Chinese', 'characters', 'actually', 'spoke', 'Chinese', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'believable.Ang', 'Lee', 'talent', 'visual', 'composition', 'apparent', 'movie', 'filled', 'scenes', 'real', 'beauty', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'comedies', 'Too', 'often', 'movie', 'comedies', 'are', 'shot', 'were', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'consistently', 'high', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'was', 'low-budget', 'film.This', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'excellent', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'direction']",The Wedding Banquet VHS

I'm sure if current films would try to get away with no male nudity.For a movie that seems to benefit from lots of money and production values, nothing in the way of the story was lost.  This is an excellent film depicting the life of a gay couple in 1993.  It's about a culture clash between the growing openness of America vs. the unknown (to me) Asian cultures.It is both a sweet love story and a dramatic film about a couple dealing with parents.
