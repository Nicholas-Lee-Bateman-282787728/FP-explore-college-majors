He has also just met Gally (Irvine) who claims to be his grandson. After being shown the trailer which will be his new home Red drives off with Gally and they head for Mexico. Along the way they pick up two hitchhikers which change the course of not only the night but their lives. The first thing I have to say about this movie is that Robert Duvall was the perfect choice. This is his Gran Torino in the way that this seemed like a movie where they turned on a camera and just filmed him being himself for a few days. He is the only real name in this but that does not diminish the movie at all. It started off a little slow but by the end I ended up liking it and was glad I stuck it out. There is drama, action and some comedy in this but the real reason to watch is Duvall. You really can't take your eyes off of him and his casting alone makes the movie better.
