Tears of sadness, laughter, boredom, and so on. You never know what the next minute is going to contain. Simon, played by a very beautiful Thomas Arklie, loses his lover to AIDS, but gets him back in a very haunting way. Marc (Ian Williams) doesn't want to let go of his gorgeous lover even though he is supposed to be dead and gone. He comes back to haunt Simon who is trying to go on with his life with a series of one night stands. His dates are in for a surprising time when the jealous ghost of Marc play tricks on them and Simon. A very different theme than you will see in any other gay film. Arklie's acting is superb, but not a match for his looks. Williams' role spans a wide range from drag queen to mean ghost, jealousy, practical joker, victim, obnoxious queen, undying love, defender and more. His acting is good but not a character I really liked. The sound quality on this film is not real good. I had it turned all the way up and the only thing that didn't need more volume was the musical score which was way too loud and overshadowing. Don't expect a world class production from this movie, but don't let bad reviews keep you from seeing it. I recommend this one but would certainly recommend others much higher. If you're in a mood to see something crazy, funny, and totally unusual, but gay based, this one is a good change of pace.",4,A haunting love story,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,1467,"['TO', 'DIE', 'FOR', 'a.k.a', 'Heaven', 'Drag', 'strange', 'little', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'lot', 'emotion', 'Tears', 'sadness', 'laughter', 'boredom', 'so', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'minute', 'going', 'contain', 'Simon', 'played', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Thomas', 'Arklie', 'lover', 'AIDS', 'back', 'very', 'haunting', 'way', 'Marc', 'Ian', 'Williams', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'gorgeous', 'lover', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead', 'gone', 'back', 'haunt', 'Simon', 'who', 'trying', 'go', 'life', 'series', 'one', 'night', 'dates', 'are', 'surprising', 'time', 'when', 'jealous', 'ghost', 'Marc', 'play', 'tricks', 'Simon', 'very', 'different', 'theme', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'gay', 'film', 'Arklie', 'acting', 'superb', 'not', 'match', 'looks', 'Williams', 'role', 'wide', 'range', 'drag', 'queen', 'mean', 'ghost', 'jealousy', 'practical', 'joker', 'victim', 'obnoxious', 'queen', 'undying', 'love', 'defender', 'more', 'acting', 'good', 'not', 'character', 'really', 'liked', 'sound', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'real', 'good', 'had', 'turned', 'way', 'up', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'volume', 'was', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'overshadowing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'world', 'class', 'production', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'bad', 'reviews', 'keep', 'seeing', 'recommend', 'one', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'others', 'much', 'higher', ""'re"", 'mood', 'see', 'something', 'crazy', 'funny', 'totally', 'unusual', 'gay', 'based', 'one', 'good', 'change', 'pace']",N/A

It suffered a name change to ""To Die For,"" which should alert us all.  One character is as morose as they come; his favorite movie is the documentary ""Stories from the Quilt.""  In between his gig as a drag queen (he knows ONE song--how believable is that?) he watches this documentary; he sews, he cries, he BORED the crap out of me--but I digress.His companion is one of those ""I'm in an OPEN relationship"" kinda' guys, who is so shallow you can see through him like used Neutrogena.  When his lover passes away, he does the ""mourning thing"" for about, oh, 20 seconds, and he's ready to move on.  But his dead lover comes back to be with him because, according to him, Heaven is dark and lonely.  Isn't that sweet??!!  No.This movie suffers from many problems:  it doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a serious story, or one of those T & A deals.  Whatever it wanted to be, it never became.  With characters no one cares about--each one boring, self-centered, and cold--, horrible acting, and a ""partner"" who didn't even take the time to let his lover's corpse get cold before he was cruising again, this movie was awful.",1,To Die For/Heaven's a Drag,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,1483,"['Having', 'just', 'subscribed', 'NetFlix', 'have', 'found', 'wonderful', 'genre', 'movies', 'a/k/a', 'Gay', 'Lesbian', 'one', 'checked', 'out.Completely', 'unbelievable', 'horribly', 'acted', 'paced', 'director', 'were', 'uppers', 'suffered', 'schizophrenia', 'big', 'old', 'mess', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'title', 'Heaven', 'A', 'Drag', 'suffered', 'name', 'change', 'Die', 'should', 'alert', 'One', 'character', 'as', 'morose', 'come', 'favorite', 'movie', 'documentary', 'Stories', 'Quilt', 'gig', 'drag', 'queen', 'ONE', 'song', 'how', 'believable', 'documentary', 'BORED', 'crap', 'digress.His', 'companion', 'one', ""'m"", 'OPEN', 'relationship', 'kinda', 'guys', 'who', 'so', 'shallow', 'can', 'see', 'used', 'Neutrogena', 'When', 'lover', 'away', 'mourning', 'thing', 'about', 'oh', '20', 'seconds', 'ready', 'move', 'dead', 'lover', 'back', 'be', 'because', 'according', 'Heaven', 'dark', 'lonely', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'No.This', 'movie', 'suffers', 'many', 'problems', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'serious', 'story', 'one', 'T', 'A', 'deals', 'wanted', 'be', 'never', 'became', 'characters', 'one', 'one', 'boring', 'self-centered', 'cold', 'horrible', 'acting', 'partner', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'time', 'let', 'lover', 'corpse', 'get', 'cold', 'was', 'cruising', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'awful']",N/A

702804,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000067IXM,J. Martin,"[5, 6]","I'm going to do something I've never done before--give a good rating to a movie that's so bad I could hardly watch 95% of it. That's because there are three very peripheral things about this movie that I like so much they go a long way toward compensating for the mess it is in general.Just about every negative comment about this movie in other reviews is true. It's a muddled mess that doesn't know what it wants to be, trying at various times to be funny, touching, topical, sexy, tragic and transcendent, and succeeding at none of them. It doesn't even know what its title is. In the opening credits, it's called Heaven's a Drag; in the end credits and on the DVD, it's called To Die For. (It was released the year before Gus Van Sant's much more famous and completely unrelated To Die For, starring Nicole Kidman, so the title wasn't stolen; the same title had been used for a Dracula movie several years before either of these movies was made anyway.) Ordinarily this movie wouldn't deserve more than a couple of stars at most. But now for the good stuff, the three things that together move me to praise it despite its very serious flaws.First of all, this movie has a huge heart. Practically nobody involved seems to have any talent at all. Everything a good movie needs--competent screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, etc--is lacking. But its good intentions are as pure and true and clear as its execution is muddled. A lot of people cared a lot about this movie, and it shows. I don't know HOW it shows, but it does. I've never before rewarded good intentions alone in reviewing a movie, and I might not in this case either if the next two factors weren't working in its favor too.Second, there's something very appealing and attractive about Ian Williams, who plays the drag performer Mark. His performance in this movie isn't much better than anything else about it, but the man himself is unusual and unusually interesting. His speaking voice, for one thing, is lovely.Third (and I've saved the best for last) is Ruth Wallis's fabulous song ""Queer Things (are happening to me)."" The song plays during the opening credits and carries into the first two scenes, where Mark is preparing for and then doing his drag performance to it. (Another reviewer ridiculed the fact that this evidently is the only song Mark knows, but it's good enough to carry several whole drag careers single-handed, if you ask me).I'd never heard this song before, and I'd never heard of Ruth Wallis, but it and she are a joy, and Williams's act accompanying it is superb. I must have watched the first two and a half minutes of the movie 20 or 30 times just for the delight of hearing the song and watching his act, and I haven't come close to being tired of it yet.So for its big heart, for Ian Williams's personal charm, and most of all for ""Queer Things,"" I heartily recommend watching the first two and a half minutes of this movie. That's not much, but it's well worth it.",4,A bad movie I highly recommend,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,2975,"[""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'before', 'give', 'good', 'rating', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'could', 'hardly', 'watch', '95', '%', 'are', 'three', 'very', 'peripheral', 'things', 'movie', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'compensating', 'mess', 'general.Just', 'negative', 'comment', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'true', 'muddled', 'mess', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'trying', 'various', 'times', 'be', 'funny', 'touching', 'topical', 'sexy', 'tragic', 'transcendent', 'succeeding', 'none', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'title', 'opening', 'credits', 'called', 'Heaven', 'Drag', 'end', 'credits', 'DVD', 'called', 'Die', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'Die', 'starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'title', 'was', ""n't"", 'stolen', 'same', 'title', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'Dracula', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'movies', 'was', 'made', 'anyway', 'Ordinarily', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', 'couple', 'stars', 'most', 'now', 'good', 'stuff', 'three', 'things', 'together', 'move', 'praise', 'very', 'serious', 'flaws.First', 'movie', 'huge', 'heart', 'Practically', 'nobody', 'involved', 'have', 'talent', 'Everything', 'good', 'movie', 'needs', 'competent', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'etc', 'lacking', 'good', 'intentions', 'are', 'pure', 'true', 'clear', 'execution', 'muddled', 'lot', 'people', 'cared', 'lot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'HOW', ""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'rewarded', 'good', 'intentions', 'alone', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'case', 'next', 'two', 'factors', 'were', ""n't"", 'working', 'favor', 'too.Second', 'something', 'very', 'appealing', 'attractive', 'Ian', 'Williams', 'who', 'drag', 'performer', 'Mark', 'performance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'man', 'unusual', 'unusually', 'interesting', 'speaking', 'voice', 'one', 'thing', 'lovely.Third', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'best', 'last', 'Ruth', 'Wallis', 'fabulous', 'song', 'Queer', 'Things', 'are', 'happening', 'song', 'opening', 'credits', 'first', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'Mark', 'preparing', 'then', 'doing', 'drag', 'performance', 'reviewer', 'ridiculed', 'fact', 'evidently', 'only', 'song', 'Mark', 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'several', 'whole', 'drag', 'careers', 'single-handed', 'ask', '.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'song', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Ruth', 'Wallis', 'are', 'joy', 'Williams', 'act', 'accompanying', 'superb', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'half', 'minutes', 'movie', '20', '30', 'times', 'just', 'delight', 'hearing', 'song', 'watching', 'act', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'tired', 'big', 'heart', 'Ian', 'Williams', 'personal', 'charm', 'most', 'Queer', 'Things', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'half', 'minutes', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'well', 'worth']",N/A

Sherwin,"[2, 3]","To Die For is a somewhat average movie, although I will admit it wasn't all *that* bad for an evening at home when I was rather tired and I didn't want to watch anything that would make me think too much! People are right--the film tries hard to be many things including funny, dramatic, tragic, deep, revealing and more. But, as many note, it really doesn't meet any of those goals. Yes, I can see that people cared about making a good little film and that's great; but this just doesn't work out very well. The acting was definitely less than convincing at times and the plot moves somewhat slower than it should near the beginning of the film although it picks up the pace and gets rolling much better after the first half or so. However, the musical score was fairly well done.The film's two main characters are Simon (Thomas Arklie), a TV repairman and Mark (Ian Williams), a drag performer who is dying of AIDS. Simon and Mark are lovers although their relationship is sexually open; and Simon seems to take advantage of that quite a lot. After Mark dies, Simon wants nothing more than to forget about Mark, repressing his true feelings of love and affection for Mark who was actually very special to him. Trouble is, however, Mark's ghost just won't go upward into heaven until Simon comes around and gets in touch with his feelings to finally mourn his great loss.Of course, there are a few complications to spice the film up; but they don't really achieve that goal, either. What can I say? It's a mediocre film, after all. Simon must contend with a very homophobic TV repairman partner (""Dogger,"" played by John Altman); and Simon also has issues regarding his late father. Mark's ghost also causes trouble for Simon when Simon can see and talk to him--but all the others see and hear is nothing!Look for Dillie Keane playing the role of their neighbor Siobban; and Tony Slattery does some of the better acting in the film as Terry, Siobban's boyfriend. Ian Williams as Mark's ghost does his best acting in the last major sequence of the film.The DVD comes with an explanation of how the film essentially has two names--the original was To Die For but they had to change it to Heaven's a Drag after Sony told them they couldn't use that name; Sony was releasing their own film under that name at the same time.Overall, if you just want some light entertainment that doesn't require you to think, watch this movie and get at least some enjoyment out of it.

702807,AS27SJQFMATT8,B000067IXM,Shakespeare,"[0, 0]","I will try to be direct and truthful.First, I simply could not stand the conspicuous absence of a 5-star rating for this film from Somebody, anybody, given the depth, soul and love in this film. Like the rebellion in the Stonewall, I cannot sit idly by and not right a wrong.Second, this is not a comedy, this is not a linear story; this brilliantly avoids being a tragedy. Shakespeare would have called this a Redemption Romance, one of those last profound spiritual plays performed rarely, and snuggled it into his works near ""The Winter's Tale."" Shakespeare would have kept this one, if only for himself. This film no one seems to like.Third, this film speaks on multiple levels simultaneously to each person who sees it, whether (s)he realizes or not. It sounds thoughts, characterizations, dialogues, octaves of profundity as different from one another as the carefully and very sensitively selected music of the soundtrack -- and the recurring photography of The Quilt -- jarringly leaping from 90's trash to Bizet, Brahms and Beethoven. The ""Peal Fishers"" male duet has rarely been played so powerfully in an unexpected context to capture such a deep epiphany about the love between two men. The music and the film is unapologetically ""romantic,"" because that is what ""love"" coupled with ""loss through AIDS"" does evoke . . . and which, eventually, in the final minutes of the film, it overwhelmingly accomplishes.Fourth, I ponder whether this film, like the AIDS Quilt itself, ought not to be shown only to people who know in some region of their minds and hearts that the time is NOW to see this -- perhaps gay men, lesbians, lovers who continually reach for the stars as their souls command . . . and Become those stars, while finding death, loss and sorrow rising up simultaneously to enfold their brilliant primary colors in grayscale.Fifth, one's spiritual nature has to have made itself known to you before this film begins to make the ""sense"" it actually and assuredly makes. Timespace flows in every direction simultaneously in this film, and is never wrong or right. That's okay. We allow it in ""Alice in Wonderland."" No Matrix tricks. Only Truth tricks, tricks of the heart and soul, not of the mind. There can be intellectual or emotional depth to works of art. And then there can be ""depth beyond deep"" . . . Depthness . . . which is cognizable only on the ""other side of Sorrow,"" only as wisdom, humility, kindness, mercy, forgiveness shining out of Truth itself -- the only thing one can ultimately trust.Sixth, people today (2012) do not know what the 80's and 90's were like for gay people. Like the Holocaust, the horror is inconceivable and ""could not possibly have been really real."" But it was really real. A mere decade after Stonewall destroyed the Bastille of hate and let the prisoners out into the sun, AIDS struck through the accident of one airline steward, and raced not through the ""sex"" but through the love, through the intimacy, through the self-respect and tenderness of the Fellini farce of life which constitutes each person's reality, especially each person's social and intimate reality, each person's most private heart's joy. And thousands of the very best, most giving, most creative, most caring, most beautiful souls on earth died excruciating and disgusting deaths. Beauty beyond compare turned into rank, filthy human corruption. But then Truth is paradox:-- what is Beauty? which was the truer beauty?Seventh, these people were loved deeply by many; they loved life deeply. These were sons and daughters, young and old, usually the most exuberant and life-bestowing individuals in society, gay and familial and honest and courageous and noble. These were those free to be free, free to BE, free to free us all, free to accept our regret for our unspeakable cruelty through ignorance toward same-gender love, free to forgive the continuous attack. That is absurd -- right? It is certainly paradoxical. And so the drag, the glitter, the fantasies and poses and postures . . . and the wit and intelligence and sensitivity and creativity and brass balls courage it takes to march proudly out of the shadows into the blazing daylight of Fifth Avenue. These people were both good ""actors"" and bad, like the actors in this film; their lives were good ""plots"" and messes; their stylistic direction of the moment by moment ""scenes"" in the Story in which they walked were culture and kitsch.JUST LIKE THIS FILM!Eighth and finally, this film is being told by the lovers who remain after death and loss has desolated them, in their idolatry and unendurable pain, in tribute to those they knew were most surely heaven-bound. If you the viewer did not weep uncontrollably at the documentary footage of the ""lost"" lovers grieving at the shrine of The Quilt, that's okay. You weren't there, you weren't them, and perhaps you are superior to each and every thing you see and hear in this film. That's okay.But some of us were there. This film, this seemingly muddled, tacky confusion of a film like a James Joyce novel deftly gets at the truth of our experience of fact, comedy, tragedy, even redemption better than the Oscar-winning version of this tremendous social experience. What Oscar-winning version? Right:-- there isn't one, could not be one; not and be truer than this film already is. Some of us loved other people like this, as romantically and sentimentally and operatically and absurdly as this. Some of us saw as gods forever in our pantheon some sloppy speaking, non-RADA, physically imperfect, emotionally damaged survivors of the lives they had lived because of the way they had played the cards they were dealt. Some of us were unappreciated, unsung heroes who stayed bedside while a beloved, or a friend, or a friend's friend, died hideously -- but courageously . . . affirming the joy of the life they had lived, the love they had shared. Very, very few suicides in all of this horror. Surprisingly little desertion of the diseased by lovers who had a ready-made justification for rejecting and abandoning their mates. And then some of us, most of whom had never sewn a stitch in our lives, put together a memorial panel for The Quilt. Few had lovers who loved and anticipated aftermath as profoundly as the protagonist in this film, lovers who quietly made their own panels as summations of their love for those they leave behind and bereft.The one thing I can say about this film which I will never doubt, now or in future. This is the heart and soul, body and mind of a gay man -- should someone choose to allow the film to play on all the strings of that spiritual sensorium you can hear, and cannot hear yet. ""Longtime Companion"" is the critics' choice for best romance concerning the AIDS holocaust. There are fine films on the politics, the conspiracies, the heroes and villains of the time. But from this evening onward, for me, this film tells it best, tells it most richly, tells it fully and generously and in its way gorgeously to those who loved and lost. So I'll buy it, and watch it regularly, just as I reread Shakespeare's plays and great books, several times a year. I'll ponder it and rise to clearer truths than I can toss off tonight.
