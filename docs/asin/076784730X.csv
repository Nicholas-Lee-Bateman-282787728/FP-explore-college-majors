22053,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,076784730X,Andres C. Salama,"[4, 7]","Somewhat didactic and sentimental, this film from Zhang Yimou is nevertheless irresistible. An unusual foray from Zhang into realistic filmmaking, Not One Less tells the tale of a young teenager in a Chinese village who is named as substitute teacher in the local school when the head teacher has to visit her ailing mother. Her skills as a teacher are barely adequate, and her students are just a few years younger than she is, yet she makes up her obvious shortcomings as a teacher with an utmost zeal in accomplishing her mission. Her superior has told her that not one of her students must drop out of school, so when one of the more troublemaking boys heads to the big city in order to support his starving family, she has to go there to get him back. The movie is refreshingly sincere in stating that she does not search the boy out of a sense of responsibility, but because of money, since she won't receive any bonus if any of her students are missing. The best part of the movie shows the nave teacher trying to find her lost student in the urban jungle of the city. Shot with a wonderful amateur cast, this look at rural China is beguiling.",4,Wonderful film from Zhang Yimou,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,1150,"['Somewhat', 'didactic', 'sentimental', 'film', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'nevertheless', 'irresistible', 'unusual', 'foray', 'Zhang', 'realistic', 'filmmaking', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'tale', 'young', 'teenager', 'Chinese', 'village', 'who', 'named', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'local', 'school', 'when', 'head', 'teacher', 'visit', 'ailing', 'mother', 'skills', 'teacher', 'are', 'barely', 'adequate', 'students', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'younger', 'yet', 'up', 'obvious', 'shortcomings', 'teacher', 'utmost', 'zeal', 'accomplishing', 'mission', 'superior', 'told', 'not', 'one', 'students', 'must', 'drop', 'school', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'more', 'troublemaking', 'boys', 'heads', 'big', 'city', 'order', 'support', 'starving', 'family', 'go', 'there', 'get', 'back', 'movie', 'refreshingly', 'sincere', 'stating', 'not', 'search', 'boy', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'receive', 'bonus', 'students', 'are', 'missing', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'nave', 'teacher', 'trying', 'find', 'lost', 'student', 'urban', 'jungle', 'city', 'Shot', 'wonderful', 'amateur', 'cast', 'look', 'rural', 'China', 'beguiling']",N/A

I must have caught it fairly close to the beginning, where the mayor was trying to get the new substitute teacher to come in to the classroom.I'm not sure why, but it kinda grabbed me, and just sort of kept me watching. I don't speak any dialect of Chinese, so the subtitles were a bonus. I have no idea how correct the subtitles are. At one point, the mayor calls the local troublemaker a ""farthead"". That was probably the clincher.In any event, this is really a movie worth watching. Most of the other reviewers will give you good indications of the plot, but it basically seems to be a movie which points out how callous and uncaring many people can be, towards those less fortunate. That's a message which can easily break any cultural barrier.But one thing I did walk away with was a sense of culture shock. Sitting in my comfortable middle-class American living room, drinking coffee. Watching a group of 20 children sharing two cans of Coke, most probably never have even tasted a Coke. This kind of gives you a stark view of what life must be like.

Unlike many other seasoned directors who would like to have variety in their portfolio, Zhang seems content with making movies of a single topic: humanity.  He has tackled so many different aspects of Chinese life, from oppression (Judou) to greed (Shanghai Triad), he has virtually become its conscience.  With 'Not One Less,' he shows you that he is keeping up with China's progress.This is indeed a different era in China.  Capitalization has begun to take hold and pockets of the country are prospering, though mostly in the cities.  In this movie, he would like to take you on a tour of rural China, where poverty is still rampant and the living condition is so miserable that a box of blackboard chalk is the prized possession of a school.  Like the subject matter, the film has nothing fancy to offer, just a matter-of-fact and simplistic style of narration.  What makes Zhang a great director is his ability in capturing beauty where you would least expect it.  The camera work is delightful as always.However, the delivery is heavy-handed at times.  The movie seems too preoccupied with trasmitting the message &quot;Don't forget about us.&quot;  For a provocative director, this one feels almost like a public announcement.  Even the title seems to suggest that as a people, China has to move forward together, not leaving anyone behind.  Nevertheless, it is nothing short of a worthy cause.The DVD comes with very few perks.  I hope that one day the studios will find it worthwhile to pay a homage to Zhang and create a documentary or short that will showcase his brilliant works.",4,A little tale about humanity,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",2001,1644,"['Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mou', 'been', 'block', 'long', 'enough', 'many', 'other', 'seasoned', 'directors', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'variety', 'portfolio', 'Zhang', 'content', 'making', 'movies', 'single', 'topic', 'humanity', 'tackled', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'aspects', 'Chinese', 'life', 'oppression', 'Judou', 'greed', 'Shanghai', 'Triad', 'virtually', 'become', 'conscience', ""'Not"", 'One', 'Less', 'keeping', 'up', 'China', 'progress.This', 'indeed', 'different', 'era', 'China', 'Capitalization', 'begun', 'take', 'hold', 'pockets', 'country', 'are', 'prospering', 'though', 'mostly', 'cities', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'tour', 'rural', 'China', 'where', 'poverty', 'still', 'rampant', 'living', 'condition', 'so', 'miserable', 'box', 'blackboard', 'chalk', 'prized', 'possession', 'school', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'offer', 'just', 'matter-of-fact', 'simplistic', 'style', 'narration', 'What', 'Zhang', 'great', 'director', 'ability', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'where', 'would', 'least', 'expect', 'camera', 'work', 'delightful', 'always.However', 'delivery', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'movie', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'trasmitting', 'message', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'us.', 'quot', 'provocative', 'director', 'one', 'almost', 'public', 'announcement', 'Even', 'title', 'suggest', 'people', 'China', 'move', 'forward', 'together', 'not', 'leaving', 'anyone', 'behind', 'Nevertheless', 'nothing', 'short', 'worthy', 'cause.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'few', 'perks', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'studios', 'will', 'find', 'worthwhile', 'pay', 'homage', 'Zhang', 'create', 'documentary', 'short', 'will', 'showcase', 'brilliant', 'works']",N/A
22056,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,076784730X,Chris Fung,"[7, 7]","Like Wu Tianming's ""King of Masks"", Zhang Yimou's ""Not One Less"" marks a change from the standard ""Chinese history as backdrop"" approach of the internationally-oriented art-house movie directors of China's Fifth Generation.Personally, I think this is a change that is well overdue.  The weight of history has proved excessive for some of the most famous of the Fifth Generation's work (examples include otherwise completely masterful offerings such as ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""Red Sorghum""). It's a mark of the creative talent of these directors that they have been able to transcend those fairly obvious roadblocks to understanding. However, it must be said that the traditional Chinese emphasis on story line over characterization has enabled western audiences to hold many of these movies at arms length emotionally.In ""Not One Less"" Zhang (that's his family name by the way, Yimou is probably a little overfamiliar in a public space) provides a close focus on a single point in time and a single set of characters.  It is a moving and well-crafted human portrait of the modern discrepencies between China's interior countryside and the economic dynamos of the coastal belt and the big cities.As the doggedly literal teenage substitute teacher, Wei Minzhi is a wonderful find.  Like Zhang Huike, the boy whom she tracks down in the midst of the city of Xi'an, she was chosen from among a group of children who had never acted before.  Her performance here is absolutely riveting.This movie deserves 5 points just for its humor and the humanity of its characters.  Again, like ""King of Masks"" it manages to make big points without sacrificing the personalities of the characters and this feature makes it a very significant film.One of the most important features to emerge from modern Chinese cinema in the last few years is the appearance of characters who have an intimate emotional impact on western audiences.  Previous offerings have tended towards the heroic or the spectacular: While  Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li were perhaps the most obvious choices as cross-over stars, in the end, their abilities to do more than entertain or elicit admiration for their martial arts skills is pretty limited. Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi while undoubedly beautiful and talented seem almost otherwordly and perhaps too readily assimilated into the China-doll category to be truly liberating figures.The situation in Hollywood is even worse of course.  Only John Lone is consistently employed in anything approaching starring roles and Joan Chen has not really been able to make a significant impact either.  The only recent exceptions were (of course) Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat in Ang Lee's non-Hollywood ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but even here, most of the hype was centered around the martial arts rather than the phenomenal acting job that they both did.In these days ... it is refreshing and faith-restoring to see depictions of Chinese people that are three dimensional, charming and human.  ...just knowing that these movies are around and that I can show them to my students makes me sleep a lot easier at night.",5,One of the best movies of all time,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,3132,"['Wu', 'Tianming', 'King', 'Masks', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'change', 'standard', 'Chinese', 'history', 'backdrop', 'approach', 'internationally-oriented', 'art-house', 'movie', 'directors', 'China', 'Fifth', 'Generation.Personally', 'think', 'change', 'well', 'overdue', 'weight', 'history', 'proved', 'excessive', 'most', 'famous', 'Fifth', 'Generation', 'work', 'examples', 'include', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'masterful', 'offerings', 'such', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Red', 'Sorghum', 'mark', 'creative', 'talent', 'directors', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'transcend', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'roadblocks', 'understanding', 'However', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'emphasis', 'story', 'line', 'characterization', 'enabled', 'western', 'audiences', 'hold', 'many', 'movies', 'arms', 'length', 'emotionally.In', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'Zhang', 'family', 'name', 'way', 'Yimou', 'probably', 'little', 'overfamiliar', 'public', 'space', 'close', 'focus', 'single', 'point', 'time', 'single', 'set', 'characters', 'moving', 'well-crafted', 'human', 'portrait', 'modern', 'discrepencies', 'China', 'interior', 'countryside', 'economic', 'dynamos', 'coastal', 'belt', 'big', 'cities.As', 'doggedly', 'literal', 'teenage', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'Wei', 'Minzhi', 'wonderful', 'find', 'Zhang', 'Huike', 'boy', 'whom', 'down', 'midst', 'city', ""Xi'an"", 'was', 'chosen', 'group', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'before', 'performance', 'here', 'absolutely', 'riveting.This', 'movie', '5', 'points', 'just', 'humor', 'humanity', 'characters', 'Again', 'King', 'Masks', 'make', 'big', 'points', 'sacrificing', 'personalities', 'characters', 'feature', 'very', 'significant', 'film.One', 'most', 'important', 'features', 'emerge', 'modern', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'appearance', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'intimate', 'emotional', 'impact', 'western', 'audiences', 'Previous', 'offerings', 'have', 'tended', 'heroic', 'spectacular', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jet', 'Li', 'were', 'perhaps', 'most', 'obvious', 'choices', 'cross-over', 'stars', 'end', 'abilities', 'do', 'more', 'entertain', 'elicit', 'admiration', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'pretty', 'limited', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'undoubedly', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'seem', 'almost', 'otherwordly', 'perhaps', 'too', 'readily', 'assimilated', 'China-doll', 'category', 'be', 'truly', 'liberating', 'figures.The', 'situation', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'worse', 'course', 'Only', 'John', 'Lone', 'consistently', 'employed', 'anything', 'approaching', 'starring', 'roles', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'significant', 'impact', 'only', 'recent', 'exceptions', 'were', 'course', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'non-Hollywood', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'even', 'here', 'most', 'hype', 'was', 'centered', 'martial', 'arts', 'rather', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'job', 'did.In', 'days', 'refreshing', 'faith-restoring', 'see', 'depictions', 'Chinese', 'people', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'charming', 'human', 'just', 'knowing', 'movies', 'are', 'around', 'can', 'show', 'students', 'sleep', 'lot', 'easier', 'night']",N/A

Yang,"[13, 14]","This is NOT a political protest film, despite the tendency of some people to politicize every major piece of contemporary Chinese film-making.  If  this film has a political over-tone at all, it would be to serve as a  propaganda piece for the government-sponsored Hope Project, a massive  fund-raising campaign to benefit rural education.  Rural education is in  fact one of the bright spots of the Communist record, considering that  prior to the Communist take-over the vast majority of rural China was  illiterate, and efforts to promote literacy (even those sponsored by  Christian missionaries) were violently opposed by the traditional gentry.  But of course, all that was too much Chinese history to expect from people  who insist on referring to the director as &quot;Yimou&quot;, when his  family name is Zhang.  We do not refer to Mao Zedong as Zedong.I  probably don't need to rehash the basic story of the film or to point out  yet again that the director casted local non-actors for every major role in  the film.  The result is a film that has the look and feel of a docudrama.  But despite the somewhat awkward acting, all of the characters are entirely  believable.  While the story line is certainly somewhat contrived, the film  was peppered with enough believable details to maintain the viewer's  suspension of disbelief.  And it's these seemingly trivial details that  will move you, sometimes deeply.The problems exposed by the film are the  universal problems of poverty.  Even if China were to become democratic in  the US model tomorrow, all these problems will remain for some years to  come and may in fact exacerbate in the short run.

22066,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,076784730X,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 10]","Wei Minzhi (played by Wei Minzhi, essentially playing herself) is a 13-year-old peasant girl pressed into being &quot;Teacher Wei&quot; at a small rural elementary school when the regular teacher must take a month off.  She knows one song (a Maoist propaganda song) and that not very well.  She hasn't a clue about how to manage a classroom.  Her arithmetic is suspect and her people skills are those of a self-centered beginner.  It's not even clear that she wants to do the job.  In fact she seems more concerned about the 50 yuan she's supposed to get than anything else.Thus acclaimed Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou sets the stage for a most compelling fairy tale which illustrates how the determined spirit of a little girl might triumph over poverty, ignorance, and the hard-headed reality of the post-Maoist bureaucratic society.And is she determined!  She is given 30 pieces of chalk and warned not to waste any of it.  The lesson plans are to copy some lessons on the chalkboard and to get the students to copy the copy.  That's it!  Both the regular teacher and the town's mayor point to the other as the one who will pay her.  When the regular teacher starts to leave without paying her, she chases after him.  She is told she will get paid when he returns, and if all the students are still enrolled, she will get a ten-yuan bonus.Thus we have the movie's title and the source of &quot;Teacher Wei's&quot; determination.  When one little girl is picked to go to a sports camp because she can run, Wei hides her from the authorities.  When Zhang Huike, the class trouble-maker (played by Zhang Huike), quits school and heads for the city to find work, Wei schemes ways to get him and bring him back.At this point the magic begins.  With this common goal both teacher and the kids figure out ways to raise money to send Wei by bus to the city and back.  They figure the cost for Wei's round trip and for Zhang Huike's one-way trip back, with the kids themselves taking the initiative at the chalkboard with the math.  Wei makes them empty their pocketbooks, and when there is not enough she takes them on a field trip to a brick-making factory and together they move bricks to raise the cash.  Again they calculate how many bricks they must move at so many &quot;cents&quot; per brick.I mention all this because what is demonstrated, by the by, is some real teaching and learning taking place.  In fact the mayor comes by and peeks into the classroom and is delighted to see that the substitute teacher knows how to teach math!This sequence of events is very moving and is at the heart of the film.  Any teacher anywhere in the world will recognize how brilliantly this is done.  The kids become so eager to learn that they learn effortlessly, which is the way it is supposed to be.  Furthermore, one of the phenomena of the profession is exemplified: that of the real teacher learning more (partly because she is older) than the students from the lessons they encounter.Now, it is true that director Zhang Yimou does not show us the real poverty that exists in China nor does he point to the horrid dangers encountered by children who go to the city to work.  Neither the little boy nor Teacher Wei is preyed upon in the manner we might fear.  Recapitulations of the baser instincts of human beings are not part of Zhang Yimou's purpose here.  This is in fact a movie that can be viewed by children, who will, I suspect, identify very strongly with the story.  Zhang Yimou is talking to the child in all of us and he does it without preaching or through any didactic manipulation of adult verses child values.  It is true he does manipulate our hearts to some degree, but with all the ugliness that one sees in the world today, perhaps he can be allowed this indulgence.Although I would not say that this film is as good as Zhang Yimou's internationally celebrated films such as Red Sorghum (1987) (his first film) or Raise the Red Lantern (1991) (which I think is his best film) or The Story of Qiu Ju (1991) (which this film resembles to some extent), it is nonetheless a fine work of art exemplifying Zhang Yimou's beautiful and graceful style and his deep love for his characters and their struggles.  And as always his work rises above and exists in a place outside of political propaganda as does the work of all great artists.Perhaps more than anything else, however, one should see this movie to delight in the unselfconscious, natural, and utterly convincing &quot;amateur&quot; performance by Wei Minzhi as a most determined and brave little girl.

22069,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,076784730X,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 3]","This story is about the care, love, and sheer indomitable stubborn spirit of a 13 year old girl Wei Minzhi who became a substitute teacher in a remote village primary school for one month in China. The film shows how she brought hope and a better future into the lives of her young students. Initially, Wei was concerned with her wages, she had been told that the teacher going on leave to visit his sick mother would pay. She had asked him, but he said the mayor who hired you pays your salary. She spoke with the mayor who reassured her: at the end of the month, when the job is complete you will get paid. As a poor girl from a nearby village, it is not surprising that the money interested her yet in the end, she proved she cared about much more than money.After she received a tour of the school, shown the lessons to teach and introduced to 4 or 5 students who lived with her and were her assistants, she was determined to do her best and earn her salary but was clearly somewhat at a loss, never having done this before and being so close in age to her students. The story revolves around her relationship with Zhang Huike, the ""bad  boy"" of the class, who is mischevious and uses his unspent energy to be disruptive whenever he can get away with it. Whenever Wei turns her back or leaves the classroom he misbehaves. During one such episode, he overturned a desk which held the only box of chalk owned by the school. The chalk became dirty and broke into many small pieces much of which could not be used ... Another time, Wei caught him teasing and grabbing a young girl's diary. She insisted he read the diary entry outloud. The owner of the diary was moritified as her secret thoughts were revealed to the class. In it, she said Wei did not care for the school equipment as much as the previous teacher because Wei did not seek out and punish the culprit Zhang who upturned the desk and broke the chalk. Taking both aside privately, Wei forced an apology from Zhang to the young girl. Wei realized the girl had been a school monitor whose duty was to ensure the chalk was not wasted. She felt responsible for the damage. After this incident, Wei more energetically committed herself to teaching ... She copied taught the lessons and maintained order. She kept her students focused and learning. She provided exercise time and singing lessons, and ensured the students pledged allegiance to Chairman Mao and the Communist system. She was determined to do her best and earn her salary. The build up of the plot and sequencing of scenes is superbly done. As the story unfolds, each current event suprisingly and brilliantly flows into the next event. The message is simple but profound.The film takes a unique turn on the day Wei took roll call and she discovered Zhang was missing. She looked fro him all over the village and even visited his home. There she learned his mother was ill, and as a result the family incurred a debt. He went to work in the city to help pay off the expenses. Her dedication to finding Zhang caught on like a wildfire among the students. She did math lessons using the practical problem of calculating how many days of work it would take carrying bricks at the local factory to raise enough money for her to travel by bus into the city to find Zhang. While doing the calculations on the black board, the mayor walked by and was impressed how this 13 year old Primary School graduate could capture the attention of a whole class of students to intently work out math problems. He did not know their goal was to help find Zhang and bring him back to school. Her zealous spirit and one-mindedness brought about a miracle: all the students worked at the local brick factory to raise the funds necessary for the trip.The film is totally engaging in how it covers her experiences in the city when trying to find Zhang. She hires a girl about her own age to help look for him. It was under her watch Zhang had disappeared at the bus station after going to the bathroom ... The Director does a fabulous job in filming the realistic experiences associated with someone totally unfamiliar with city life who goes looking for a missing person. The difficulties she faced were daunting and well portrayed. Through a chance encounter, a stranger sees her writing posters to place in strategic locations with information about Zhang, he points ouf the problems with this strategy and explains why it will not work. Due to her tenacity, he gives her the most valubale information which allows her to locate a television studio where senseleass bureacracy blocks her goals. By pure chance, the person she is looking for, the radio station manager, learns of her quest ... The story ends in a most heart-warming satisfactory manner: Wei Minzhi is interviewed on a TV program ""Today in China"". She tearfully and sincerely pleads for the viewers to help locate Zhang and she asks with heart felt emotion for him to return to school. Although the home coming to the village is a bit less spectacular than one might expect, over all the execution and flow of the story makes up for this one slight deficiency. The film does indeed reveal the rewards of teaching ...

Bestick,"[11, 11]","My daughter was adopted from rural China as a baby and brought to New York, where she enjoys access to the goods and services available at the upper end of the capitalist food chain.  Except for the happy accident of her adoption (the luck is mostly ours), she would have ended up as one of the impoverished country schoolchildren captured in this moving film.  Zhang Yimou's movie is an eye-opening look at the people who have been left in the dust while China's economic engine roars forward.  Shot mostly with an amateur cast, and using a happy-ending story line that allows him to dance around Party censors, Zhang still manages to make an artful social protest.The story unfolds simply.  Teacher Gao is forced leave the village school to take care of his sick mother, and the only substitute available is Wei, a 13 year old girl.  Barely educated herself, Wei takes the job because she needs the money.  She'll be paid 50 yuan for a month's work and receive a 10 yuan bonus if all the children are still at school when Gao returns.  To put these sums in context, 10 yuan is about one dollar and twenty five cents in American money.Because his family is out of money, one of Wei's rowdier students runs away to the city to find work.  Wanting her 10 yuan bonus, Wei decides to find him and bring him back.  She enlists her remaining students to help raise bus fare, and in these scenes we see with stark clarity how poor these villagers are.  A can of Coke must be shared by half the class.  Even after the class spends a day hauling bricks, they aren't even close to earning a bus ticket to the city.  Wei ends up hitching a ride to find her ten year old lost sheep.Once in the city, Wei and her runaway pupil seem like figures out of Dickens or The Jungle, Upton Sinclair's expose of early American capitalism.  The lost children are bewildered, overwhelmed and victimized, rescued only by improbable acts of kindness.  In a fairy tale twist, a kindly television station manager reunites Wei and her lost pupil and brings them back to the village in buses laden with gifts and supplies. Of course, the station manager is clever enough to realize that Wei's story makes good TV, and that's one of Zhang's main points:  when money's involved, no one's motives are pure.By the story's end, we understand that when the buses from the city depart, these kids, despite their spunk, will still be mired in grinding, hopeless poverty.  Capitalism may be the most efficient wealth creation system ever devised, but China is learning, as England and America did, that it produces victims as surely as it produces wealth.  Zhang's achievement is to make us see the victims in all their grace, pathos and particularity.",4,Life in the Slow Lane,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2713,"['daughter', 'was', 'adopted', 'rural', 'China', 'baby', 'brought', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'access', 'goods', 'services', 'available', 'upper', 'end', 'capitalist', 'food', 'chain', 'happy', 'accident', 'adoption', 'luck', 'mostly', 'ours', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'impoverished', 'country', 'schoolchildren', 'captured', 'moving', 'film', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'movie', 'eye-opening', 'look', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'dust', 'China', 'economic', 'engine', 'roars', 'forward', 'Shot', 'mostly', 'amateur', 'cast', 'using', 'happy-ending', 'story', 'line', 'dance', 'around', 'Party', 'censors', 'Zhang', 'still', 'make', 'artful', 'social', 'protest.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'simply', 'Teacher', 'Gao', 'forced', 'village', 'school', 'take', 'care', 'sick', 'mother', 'only', 'substitute', 'available', 'Wei', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Barely', 'educated', 'Wei', 'job', 'money', ""'ll"", 'be', 'paid', '50', 'yuan', 'month', 'work', 'receive', '10', 'yuan', 'bonus', 'children', 'are', 'still', 'school', 'when', 'Gao', 'put', 'sums', 'context', '10', 'yuan', 'one', 'dollar', 'twenty', 'five', 'cents', 'American', 'family', 'money', 'one', 'Wei', 'rowdier', 'students', 'away', 'city', 'find', 'work', 'Wanting', '10', 'yuan', 'bonus', 'Wei', 'find', 'bring', 'back', 'remaining', 'students', 'help', 'raise', 'bus', 'fare', 'scenes', 'see', 'stark', 'clarity', 'how', 'poor', 'villagers', 'are', 'can', 'Coke', 'must', 'be', 'shared', 'class', 'Even', 'class', 'day', 'hauling', 'bricks', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'earning', 'bus', 'ticket', 'city', 'Wei', 'up', 'hitching', 'ride', 'find', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'lost', 'sheep.Once', 'city', 'Wei', 'runaway', 'pupil', 'seem', 'figures', 'Dickens', 'Jungle', 'Upton', 'Sinclair', 'expose', 'early', 'American', 'capitalism', 'lost', 'children', 'are', 'bewildered', 'overwhelmed', 'victimized', 'rescued', 'only', 'improbable', 'acts', 'kindness', 'fairy', 'tale', 'twist', 'kindly', 'television', 'station', 'manager', 'Wei', 'lost', 'pupil', 'back', 'village', 'buses', 'laden', 'gifts', 'supplies', 'course', 'station', 'manager', 'clever', 'enough', 'realize', 'Wei', 'story', 'good', 'TV', 'one', 'Zhang', 'main', 'points', 'when', 'money', 'involved', 'one', 'motives', 'are', 'story', 'end', 'understand', 'when', 'buses', 'city', 'depart', 'kids', 'spunk', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'mired', 'grinding', 'hopeless', 'poverty', 'Capitalism', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'efficient', 'wealth', 'creation', 'system', 'ever', 'devised', 'China', 'learning', 'England', 'America', 'did', 'victims', 'as', 'surely', 'wealth', 'Zhang', 'achievement', 'make', 'see', 'victims', 'grace', 'pathos', 'particularity']",N/A

While in a sense he has dropped off from his ultra classic early dramatic collaborations with Gong Li (Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, Qiu Jou, To Live, Shanghai Triad), I still find the humble films of this middle stage of his career to be heartwarming and engrossing in a most subtle way.  Happy Times, The Road Home, and Not One Less are all simple films that manage to express and evoke a surprising depth of sympathy and emotion, much like Frank Capra was able to do during the classic era of American cinema with films like It's a Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  And the fact that Not One Less was done with non-actors is a triumph not only for their success but also for the innovative courage that Zhang continues to display.  Many consider films like this to be evidence of Zhang's fall from grace.  On the contrary, I think they show why he is so great.  How could he improve upon Raise the Red Lantern, the veritable Casablanca of Chinese cinema?  Rather than continuing with similar films, he made the bold move to forge other paths.  The next phase of his career will apparently be wuxia films.  I have a feeling it is there where his name will come back into the popular radar abroad.

How this man makes such evocotive films with so little resources can only be fully appreciated when one considers so many other films made with infinite resources that are utterly bereft. If this is not proof of genius in his field, I don't know what might be.When I first starting watching Zhang's films I became charmed by the lack of predictability. I found myself thinking: Now if this were an American film, this would happen. But something different usually happens -- something so true to life that you become involved with the characters of the story on a deep and satisfying level. I hope he can resist the temptation to immitate his Western peers -- it is they who should immitate him.This very simply told tale has a large message that I think Zhang wants to tell about his homeland.In Maoist times, the Chinese people were strongly persuaded that the ideal countryman was a souless, thoughtless, slogan-chanting, agrarian worker who bred the next generation of obeying automatons. The characters of this story are those whose lot in life is to endure the system that regime had wrought, and when our 13 year old heroine journeys to the city, her goal is to retrieve the missing boy for her own narrow purposes.However, when she is interviewed on television, her humanity, in spite of herself, comes forth. Furthermore, the spontaneity of her emotions touches the local viewers in a way that shows China is a land where the oppressors failed to extract the souls from their subjects.If you have kindness and caring in your soul (of course you do) you will connect with this movie.

The school is isolated from the town, the substitute is the only adult on the site, inexperienced and only 13-years old, and lives there with five of her 28 pupils. To say the school was impoverished would be an understatement - its only expense in the last several months was for chalk. Teacher Wei has one piece of chalk for each school day. Teacher Gao, the regular, hasn't been paid in six months, and the Mayor says he has no money to pay Ms. Wei her 50 yuan until the end of the month. Adding to the initial chaos, class clown Zhang Huike refuses to acknowledge Wei as his teacher, until forced to do so by the mayor.Teacher Wei has no idea what to do at first. Slowly she catches on, and gets their education going. The day begins with raising the flag and everyone singing the national anthem. Ten children have left the class already during the year (work), so the Mayor promises Wei a bonus if no more leave while she is there. Unfortunately, after a few days the class clown (Zhang Huike) leaves to work in the city - his mother is ill, and his father died years previously. The bulk of 'Not One Less' is taken up with Teacher Wei's efforts to get to the city and find Zhang. Eventually she succeeds, thanks to her great perseverance and the help of a TV station manager.

But there is much more good to be learned from movies like Zhang Yi-mou's ""Not One Less"", for what we are watching may be part of everyday reality.  In a small school in a remote rural area of China, a thirteen year old girl substitutes for a teacher, who has to visit an ailing parent.  This is a job that not too many people want, so a girl not much older than the kids seems to be the only choice.  The girl is obviously not cut out to teach 28 kids, whose ages range from kindergarten level to fourth grade.  On her first day of teaching, she spends a good part of the day writing the lesson on the board, with the students clueless about what to do.  Yet the teacher seems more clueless in what to do next after she is done with her writing.  When a dispute breaks out in class, the young teacher has absolutely no idea what her responsibilities are.  Yet when events take an interesting turn, she keeps her hopes up and makes the situation into a teachable moment, to the surprise of the village mayor.  With steely stubbornness, she heads to the  big city to uphold her mission to lose not one less kid from her school not just because she needs the money but also because she has become attached to her students, especially this one.  And boy does she get more than she bargained for at the end!There are some very touching moments in this movie, and their effectiveness lies in their sheer simplicity.  We get to know what one of the more responsible and sensitive girls in the class feels about the poverty of her school.  Her tears were from embarrassment, having revealed to the rest of the school, against her will, her personal feelings.  Perhaps she knew there were other possibilities in life, but she felt helpless to attain those possibilities.  Another unforgettable scene was the twenty or so kids sharing two cans of Coke, passing it around, with not one kid feeling entitled to more than a single sip.  The hunger and desperation that beset both teacher and lost student in the anonymity of the big city.  How the TV camera has triggered the teacher's last call for hope.  When the boy recognized the teacher on TV and realized that she was specifically looking for him, how could anyone not be touched by his feeling of happiness, relief, and self-pity?It is unfortunate that lack of resources, kids just dropping out of school in order to work, help the family, or move to the city to work, and the limitations in choices when the kids grow up are realities in many impoverished schools, both rural and urban.  ""Not One Less"" is a movie that brings us closer to reality and makes us think about what we can do or contribute to improve other people's lives.",5,Beauty in simplicity,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2762,"['What', 'good', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'movies', 'not', 'escapist', 'value', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'be', 'learned', 'movies', 'Zhang', 'Yi-mou', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'everyday', 'reality', 'small', 'school', 'remote', 'rural', 'area', 'China', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'teacher', 'who', 'visit', 'ailing', 'parent', 'job', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'want', 'girl', 'not', 'much', 'older', 'kids', 'be', 'only', 'choice', 'girl', 'obviously', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'teach', '28', 'kids', 'ages', 'range', 'kindergarten', 'level', 'fourth', 'grade', 'first', 'day', 'teaching', 'good', 'part', 'day', 'writing', 'lesson', 'board', 'students', 'clueless', 'what', 'do', 'Yet', 'teacher', 'more', 'clueless', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'done', 'writing', 'When', 'dispute', 'out', 'class', 'young', 'teacher', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'responsibilities', 'are', 'when', 'events', 'take', 'interesting', 'turn', 'hopes', 'situation', 'teachable', 'moment', 'surprise', 'village', 'mayor', 'steely', 'stubbornness', 'big', 'city', 'uphold', 'mission', 'lose', 'not', 'one', 'less', 'kid', 'school', 'not', 'just', 'money', 'also', 'become', 'attached', 'students', 'especially', 'one', 'boy', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'end', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'movie', 'effectiveness', 'sheer', 'simplicity', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'one', 'more', 'responsible', 'sensitive', 'girls', 'class', 'poverty', 'school', 'tears', 'were', 'embarrassment', 'having', 'revealed', 'rest', 'school', 'will', 'personal', 'feelings', 'Perhaps', 'knew', 'were', 'other', 'possibilities', 'life', 'felt', 'helpless', 'attain', 'possibilities', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'was', 'twenty', 'so', 'kids', 'sharing', 'two', 'cans', 'Coke', 'passing', 'not', 'one', 'kid', 'feeling', 'entitled', 'more', 'single', 'sip', 'hunger', 'desperation', 'beset', 'teacher', 'lost', 'student', 'anonymity', 'big', 'city', 'How', 'TV', 'camera', 'triggered', 'teacher', 'last', 'call', 'hope', 'When', 'boy', 'recognized', 'teacher', 'TV', 'realized', 'was', 'specifically', 'looking', 'how', 'could', 'anyone', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'feeling', 'happiness', 'relief', 'self-pity', 'unfortunate', 'lack', 'resources', 'kids', 'just', 'dropping', 'school', 'order', 'work', 'help', 'family', 'move', 'city', 'work', 'limitations', 'choices', 'when', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'are', 'realities', 'many', 'impoverished', 'schools', 'rural', 'urban', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'movie', 'closer', 'reality', 'think', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'contribute', 'improve', 'other', 'people', 'lives']",N/A
22082,AAW58LG72PG7I,076784730X,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","NOT ONE LESS is so moving a film that one almost overlooks the numerous social and political subtexts.  During the 1990s, rural education in China was a mixed bag of determined teachers who faced some serious obstacles that were most often financial in nature.  Middle school students were often forced to leave school to find work in the big city to help their families escape crushing debts.  The village schools were little more than ramshackle huts with no supplies other than wooden seats and chalk for old boards.  Into this witches' brew, steps 13 year old Wei Minzhi, who agrees to work as a substitute for one month for fifty yuan (a peasant's pay).  She has absolutely no experience and frankly takes the job only for the money.  But she soon shows that grit and spunk can take even a rookie far.  Her supervising teacher, who has to leave for a month, tells her not to lose even one more student, hence the title.  When one student, a trouble making boy, has to leave to find work, Teacher Wei takes a long trek to find one little boy in a huge city, surely a daunting task.  This is where the magic of director Yimou Zhang enters.  Zhang uses non-actors for the cast, with each actor using their real names and real occupations.  Teacher Wei shows astounding dedication in the face of very nearly insurmountable blocks.  She tries so hard that we are forced to root for her.  Though there are those who are mean to Teacher Wei there are many more who are helpful and kind.  Watching the end is an uplifting experience that some critics unfairly label as pro-government propagandizing.  Yet, director Zhang makes no effort to conceal the very real problems in teaching children who need caring teachers like Teacher Mei more than anything else.

But it was a trick, like when the kids in Rome hold up a newspaper in front of your face while another tries to pickpocket you.  The director is using what seems like formula scenes that any Hollywood hack could write while slowly weaving a truly emotional story that only hits you near the ending.  Maybe it is because the cast are NOT actors, or the actions taken by the cast seemed so normal, or the scenes of street life were so REAL.  By the end of the movie, when the teacher was on TV asking for the boy to come home, I found myself crying.

Little did I expect it to be such a wonderful movie.It is the story of a young substitute teacher barely older than her students who is asked to fill in for the regular village teacher while he is gone for a month.  He tells her that if she has the same number of stndents present when he returns as there are when he is leaving, he will pay her a bonus.  She is 13 - little older than her students.The village school is a one room affair.  The teachers office doubles as her bedroom.  Some of the students sleep at the school so presumeably they live to far to go back and forth each day.  Not only is she a teacher, she is also a house mother with 24 hour responsibilities for her students.One student is recruited for an athletic school.  The young teacher tries to prevent her from leaving so she won't loose the bonus.  However, she is overruled by the mayor and the student leaves the village.  It is a golden opportunity for her to possibly have a chance at a better life.Another student, one she has had trouble with, then runs away to the city to earn money for his mother's debts.  What type of work he could do is not mentioned.  Ultimately you see him just walking around the city, ragged and hungry, begging for handouts of food.His student is determined to get him back to preserve her bonus.  In her determination she rallies the class around her.  First asking them to help solve money problems.  Then they all work for several hours at the local brickyard moving bricks to earn money. When there isn't enough money, the class comes up with another solution.  The teacher stows away on the local bus after the students distract the teacher.  She is discovered and put off after the bus leaves but it is a start.  She then hitches rides to the city.In the city her troubles are not over.  No one has seen the student.  The person he came with was seperated from him.  The teacher decides to make signs so she spends the last few yuan she has to buy paper, pen and ink.  The work is wasted when she falls asleep in a doorway, the wind blows the signs away while she is sleeping and they are swept up by street cleaners.  She meets with many people offering advice but no one really helps her.  She struggles along doing the best she can.Finally someone suggests that she goes to the TV station and after more struggles is put on the air as a guest speaker on a TV show.  Her plea for the student to return is seen by a shop owner who sees the boy outside of her place.  She asks him ""is this you?"" when she brings him inside and he sees the teacher talking to him through the camera.Ultimately the teacher and student are reunited and return ot the village by the TV station.  Along the way, the boy is asked what he will remember from his adventure.  He says "" begging for food, I'll never forget that"".  The school gets additional supplies beyond the wildest dreams of the students who are there.This is a movie that is simple in it's theme but quite effective in the delivery of the message.  It is a part of China that is rarely seen - the deep rural areas with few resources and little money.  It is a far cry from Shanghai and Beijing.  Yet it brought back memories of my elementary school where we had to copy pages from a book.  I never knew why - we just did it.  Likewise the students have to copy sentences written on the blackboard.  Is it make work?  We never know.The determination of the teacher is great.  We forget and maybe she does too, about her bonus based on numbers.  We become absorbed in her adventures and how her students support her.  It is an outstanding movie and while it is a very different subject it should be viewed as a way to learn more about China.

Soon you notice the dynamics of a budding teacher (who herself is adolescent) with a class of 28 students, making you long for the control and stature that she lacks. The kids are a handful, and then some. Especially this one boy whose only solace is in being the center of attraction of the class; by hook, or by crook.The story takes a swift turn when the previous teacher and the village-mayor promise Wei 50 Yuan in a month, and bonus, if she succeeds in retaining the student-count to 28, not one less. Before your realize, the plot has chained itself around you, as you become a first person force from a passive observer. You will grind teeth, cross nails with each other, and be amazed at the resilience and tirelessness that a teenager demonstrates when looking for a lost student. And then it will hit you. Simplicity.

""Not on Less"" focuses more on the students in a one-room schoolhouse.I felt both had a purpose.""Not One Less"" is about how a reluctant teenager comes to a small village to teach. She is told she will get paid if she can keep all the students in school. Wei Minzhi (the 13-year old substitute teacher) not only lacks experience in teaching, she doesn't really want to be there.At first she seems more interested in the money, but as the movie progresses we see a change in her attitude. What is amusing is that even though she seems so focused on getting her pay, this focus helps the students learn valuable lessons.One of the students has to leave to try to make money in the city to help support his family and to pay off their debts.In America, we often take education for granted. In China, poverty forces more than one million children to leave school each year. 15 percent return due to charitable donations.While the attitude of Wei Minzhi borders on annoying at times, you probably won't forget this story anytime soon.The children in this film are a delight. They will steal your heart. You may even find yourself wanting to bring more awareness to various causes. Of all the charitable organizations I've heard of, World Vision seems to be doing the best job of gettingmoney to the needy.While I had expected something like"" The Road Home,"" I can say this movie has a real message that comes from the heart. Yimou Zhang has the ability to see into the soul and brings out emotions in the viewer that are so rare these days.I think this movie appeals to the desire in all of us to be not only unique, but to be important in a big world. The fact that a teacher goes looking for one student in a city in order to keep a class together seems to imply ""the importance of the individual.""The ending of this movie is well worth waiting for.~The Rebecca Review",3,Words in Pastel Chalk across a rugged blackboard,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,1930,"['Road', 'Home', 'love', 'story', 'teaching', 'theme', 'Not', 'Less', 'more', 'students', 'one-room', 'schoolhouse.I', 'felt', 'had', 'purpose', 'Not', 'One', 'Less', 'how', 'reluctant', 'teenager', 'small', 'village', 'teach', 'told', 'will', 'get', 'paid', 'can', 'keep', 'students', 'school', 'Wei', 'Minzhi', '13-year', 'old', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'not', 'only', 'experience', 'teaching', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'there.At', 'first', 'more', 'interested', 'money', 'movie', 'see', 'change', 'attitude', 'What', 'amusing', 'even', 'so', 'focused', 'getting', 'pay', 'focus', 'students', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons.One', 'students', 'leave', 'try', 'make', 'money', 'city', 'help', 'support', 'family', 'pay', 'off', 'debts.In', 'America', 'often', 'take', 'education', 'granted', 'China', 'poverty', 'forces', 'more', 'one', 'million', 'children', 'leave', 'school', 'year', '15', 'percent', 'return', 'due', 'charitable', 'donations.While', 'attitude', 'Wei', 'Minzhi', 'borders', 'annoying', 'times', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'story', 'anytime', 'soon.The', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'delight', 'will', 'steal', 'heart', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'wanting', 'bring', 'more', 'awareness', 'various', 'causes', 'charitable', 'organizations', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'World', 'Vision', 'be', 'doing', 'best', 'job', 'gettingmoney', 'needy.While', 'had', 'expected', 'something', 'Road', 'Home', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'real', 'message', 'heart', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'ability', 'see', 'soul', 'out', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'are', 'so', 'rare', 'days.I', 'think', 'movie', 'appeals', 'desire', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'unique', 'be', 'important', 'big', 'world', 'fact', 'teacher', 'looking', 'one', 'student', 'city', 'order', 'keep', 'class', 'together', 'imply', 'importance', 'individual', 'ending', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Zhang has once again turned his lense onto an overlooked aspect of Chinese society. This film was well received by Beijing's expat community (judging by the turnout for its English language premiere) and it was no less a success with Chinese audiences, an important consideration. While Zhang is not as highly acclaimed by many of his countrymen (a fact often overlooked in the West), he does produce a believable effort here. It is worth noting that Zhang was accused of somehow toeing the government line when he made this film but that is both wrong and patronizing. Indeed, Zhang was indignant that so many &quot;supporters&quot; in the West (i.e. at the Cannes Film Festival) raised suspicions about his motives that he withdrew it and another fine film, &quot;The Road Home,&quot; from the competition.

I think the film had many opportunities to grab the golden ring with easy payoffs (i.e. the novice teacher who ends up doing a miraculous job educating students misdirected by poverty a la &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot; or &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; or &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; or yadda yadda yadda; or the naive bumpkin who travels to the big city and becomes an accidental celebrity by spouting simple but profound aphorisms a la &quot;Being There&quot; or &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; or yadda yadda yadda) but it doesn't.  Teacher Wei's laughable pedagogical methods and her speechlessness at the TV station felt so genuine that I wanted to stand up and applaud.

But after letting the film sink in my mind over the few days, I began to recall the images that point out the outrageous economical and educational disparity between the rural and urban population.  So this film finally answers the question of why the revolution will not be televised -- the necessary advertising sponsors disapprove.  My only quibbles with the film is that the story arc is still fairly predictable, and what's up with the closing captions at the end of the film?

Unlike the other movie however, Not One Less is about a thirteen year old makeshift substitute teacher in a rural school who sets off for the city to retrieve a student from her class. Through the course of the movie, her motives change from selfish to selfless and she does a tremendous amount of growing up in the days and weeks the movie takes place within.Played not by actors but by ordinary people and filmed in Yimou's no frills albeit stunningly gorgeous and evocative style, we witness the power of sheer determination and survival instincts bringing together a large community in a powerful display of humanity and compassion.Rant ahead: As a teacher, I have reminded my students many times of their great fortune in being born in America and having free education for all.  I've even brought this point forward many times with their parents. Sadly, my words often fall on deaf ears because free public education is viewed like so many other things we've long taken for granted in our country that others throughout the world would practically kill to have. How is it that our country can be so far behind the rest of the world in education even as we provide twelve free years of it to every child? If your answer is to blame unions, bad teachers, and government bureaucracy, you're missing the biggest factor. We reap what we sow and our bountiful nation has produced lazy, spoiled, materialistic, self-absorbed brats, and I'm not just talking about our children.
