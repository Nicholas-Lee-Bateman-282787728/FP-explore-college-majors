First of all I felt like I was watching a movie made by my five year old cousins. What was with the camera angle? If it was suppost to be for effect then uuhh...try again. The lines are terrible. The whole movie you watch this guy walking around and around...just walking. Oh yeah, there is this really bad put together robotic angel that looked like the icon on one of aerosmith's ablums. If that's suppost to be an angel I really want to know what the heck these people were smoking when making this movie. It's amatuer film, I hate it.

It went through so many obvious plot contrivances that I knew how it was going to end when I was only twenty minutes in - and then I had to sit through another 70 minutes.It's unfortunate that the movie had a muddled script and a bad story because the cinematography was pretty good, and the first few minutes of the movie showed promise. I just wish that I knew why everyone is suddenly making these third-rate ""I'm dead but I don't know it"" movies. It's becoming a whole sub-genre of thriller movies now. It's probably some kind of M. Night Shyamalan backlash.

This is slow moving, boring, no dialogue and sad.  The villian whomever that may be is sadly portrayed.I couldn't even watch this whole movie, after 30 minutes of 15-words, 3 characters and no plot, I shut this movie off.  Bad acting.This movie isn't cheesy, it's just really, really bad.  It offers NOTHING to the horror genre, nor to the movie genre for that matter.  There is no reason for you to waste your time or money on this garbage.  If you like horror movies, watch something more worth while such as Hellraiser or Night of the Living Dead because this is the lamest of the lame.0 stars, nada, zip, nilch ... seriously, if you like crap - get this.  I'm so glad I got this DVD for free from HMV or else I'd be scavenging for the receit.My 16-year old brother says:  'This movie stinks, it's the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  It sucks royale, next time I want to blow chunks - I'll pop this garbage into my DVD player.  Save us ALL if this is the future of the horror genre!

824107,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000244GOK,Michael Butts,"[1, 3]","Douglas Schulze's film is filled with eerie imagery, a sense of foreboding and doom, and is also vague and indifferent.  Jon Bennett stars as cop Gabriel Goodman, who awakens one day and finds that he may be a survivor of the Apocalypse.  Of course, courtesy of the kinetically charged flashbacks, we realize it's something a little more personal.  Ever since TWILIGHT ZONE did an episode about the final dying moments; ever since CARNIVAL OF SOULS gave us a woman who was reliving a bizarre existence as she lay dying in her submerged car, moviemakers have been fascinated with what might go on in those last moments of life.  DARK HEAVEN is to be commended for its probing of the idea of faith; grief; loss; and just what might lie on the other side.  The problem is the script is so loose-ended, by the time we reach the inevitable conclusion, it has never really committed itself to what it believes, let alone what they want us to believe.  Bennett does fairly well, considering he has to carry the whole film, but he doesn't have the star power to be utterly convincing, but we still feel sorry for him, knowing what led him to his own personal Armageddon.

Dark Heaven was nothing but a FLASHBACK movie. The whole movie was NOTHING BUT FLASHBACKS & NONSENSE. The story NEVER stays in one place, it is constanly moving & not making sense. Nothing is concrete in this movie just pure confusion.Who ever wrote/directed this piece of trash needs to give it up. I sat BORED for over an hour & wanting at times to just turn it off. I made it all the way through & believe me, it was HELL watching this flick!! The writer/director was trying to be cleaver & unique in his/her movie but instead leaves room for ""WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON"". Plain bad was this movie. I have seen thousands of horror flicks & even ones done with a home camera & this was not worth the $1.00 (one dollar) i spent on it. No wonder it was in the dump bin at Wal Mart. Horrible movie, do not RECK-A-MEND. I think the writer was trying to do his/her version of JACOB's LADDER (Which was done VERY WELL). If I could give this trash flick a no star i would but with Amazon's rating system I can't. Don't waste your money or even rental money on this horrible movie.
