545267,A3KZTEUNNB20OY,B00003L9BB,book lover,"[2, 3]","I just watched this movie, and as stated above, it seemed to me to be a badly written and badly acted romance novel, set in the Old West of the early 1860s.  I'm glad I watched it to satisfy my curiosity, but my time would have been better spent vacuuming or doing the dishes.  However, it was better than just staring at a wall.  Of course, that only holds true if it's a single color wall.

Unfortunately, Cheyenne Warrior is nowhere near as good.  The dialogue is not all that great, in particular when it comes to Pato Hoffman's attempts to sound like an Indian speaking English.

I'd remembered it again when I saw Pato Hoffmann in Dr. Quinn Medicine woman.
