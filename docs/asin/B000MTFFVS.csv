The problem with this is there was not one Dumb Dora question on this whole DVD though  there is a good thing about it.

1050933,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000MTFFVS,Robert I. Hedges,"[6, 6]","This is a single disc of ""Match Game"" from its very early days (1973-1976), and given its price since it went out of print, it's probably wise to buy one of the multi-disc sets that are a better value. For fans of the show, this disc is interesting as it has the very first Match Game episode hosted by the legendary Gene Rayburn plus several others. (As an aside, I noticed how quickly the writing of the questions improved after the debut episode.) There is also a special feature starring frequent panelist Brett Somers, who, sadly, passed away in 2007.The games are as entertaining as they were when they first aired, but it would have been nice to have more consecutive shows in the set. The panelists are a varied lot, some of whom have vanished into obscurity in the thirty-something years since their were made. Others are noteworthy, and several became forever linked with the show, notably Richard Dawson, Brett Somers, and the always entertaining Charles Nelson Reilly, who passed away just a few months before Somers.This is one of the original franchise of good clean fun television game shows, and if you don't mind paying the price, this is a genuine piece of television history.",4,Dumb Dora Is So Dumb....,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1194,"['single', 'disc', 'Match', 'Game', 'very', 'early', 'days', '1973-1976', 'given', 'price', 'went', 'print', 'probably', 'wise', 'buy', 'one', 'multi-disc', 'sets', 'are', 'better', 'value', 'fans', 'show', 'disc', 'interesting', 'very', 'first', 'Match', 'Game', 'episode', 'hosted', 'legendary', 'Gene', 'Rayburn', 'several', 'others', 'aside', 'noticed', 'how', 'quickly', 'writing', 'questions', 'improved', 'debut', 'episode', 'also', 'special', 'feature', 'starring', 'frequent', 'panelist', 'Brett', 'Somers', 'who', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', '2007.The', 'games', 'are', 'as', 'entertaining', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'consecutive', 'shows', 'set', 'panelists', 'are', 'varied', 'lot', 'whom', 'have', 'vanished', 'obscurity', 'thirty-something', 'years', 'were', 'made', 'Others', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'several', 'became', 'forever', 'linked', 'show', 'notably', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'Brett', 'Somers', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Charles', 'Nelson', 'Reilly', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'Somers.This', 'one', 'original', 'franchise', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'television', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'price', 'genuine', 'piece', 'television', 'history']",N/A
