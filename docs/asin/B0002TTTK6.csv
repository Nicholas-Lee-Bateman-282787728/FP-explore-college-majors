Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[9, 9]","In addition to viewing the present disc several times, I have also had the oppotunity to view the Live from the Met Simulcast of Hamlet from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera of New York on March 27, 2010. This allowed us to see the Met's staging in 2010 of the same production of the opera as presented at the Gran Theatre del Liceu Barcelona in October 2003 and recorded on this DVD disc. Much of the feeling for the drama was the same as was the Hamlet of Simon Keenlyside. Several of the other cast members were different and often changed the impact of the presentation.Simon Keenlyside is a Shakespearian Hamlet. The intensity of his acting together with his superb French diction and singing carry this opera to heights only a few dramatic actors can achieve for the play. Everything moves as he moves and you know as Shakespear knew that the end was inevitable. This is why in the Met broadcast he had to die before the curtain fell as occurs in the play rather than the composers' ending of the crowd hailing Hamlet as now king. (In the Liceu presentation on this disc it is unclear what will happen but he seems alive as the curtain falls).The Ophelie was different in the two presentations and made a great difference. In the Met Simulcast Natalie Dessay was scheduled to play opposite Keenlyside, but became indisposed shortly before opening night. In her place was Marlis Petersen who was to appear later in the season as the Met's Lulu. Ms Petersen certainly had no time to develope the role (although she had sung it before)so she didn't quite fit in with the rest of the cast. She did a commendable job and certainly has the technique and art the role requires. She has a somewhat knifelike edge to her voice betraying an inner strength that will better suit Lulu than Ophelie. But to really appreciate the drama and pathos of this innocent maiden shattered completely by the fortunes of life listen to Ms Dessay in this recroding. Her redition would bring tears to stone. It is truly one of the great moments in Opera, it is so utterly beautiful.On the plus side for the Met presentation was the Gertrude of Jennifer Larmore. It is the mother-son interaction of the ""closet"" scene that is pivotal to the drama. Her second act arioso ""Dans son regard plus sombre"" proved what a great singing actress she is. That face can convey terror, fear and malice in equal measure as her voice projects it. The Gertrude of Uria-Monzon in this recording is adequate but restrained.Both the Met and the Liceu were excellent presentations of this excellent production. It shows, as in Tales of Hoffmann, that a less than stellar opera can shine if great talent is combined with inspired production and direction.",5,two for one,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2716,"['addition', 'viewing', 'present', 'disc', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'also', 'had', 'oppotunity', 'view', 'Live', 'Met', 'Simulcast', 'Hamlet', 'stage', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'New', 'York', 'March', '27', '2010', 'allowed', 'see', 'Met', 'staging', '2010', 'same', 'production', 'opera', 'presented', 'Gran', 'Theatre', 'del', 'Liceu', 'Barcelona', 'October', '2003', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'disc', 'Much', 'feeling', 'drama', 'was', 'same', 'was', 'Hamlet', 'Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'Several', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'different', 'often', 'changed', 'impact', 'presentation.Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'Shakespearian', 'Hamlet', 'intensity', 'acting', 'together', 'superb', 'French', 'diction', 'singing', 'carry', 'opera', 'heights', 'only', 'few', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'can', 'achieve', 'play', 'Everything', 'moves', 'know', 'Shakespear', 'knew', 'end', 'was', 'inevitable', 'why', 'Met', 'broadcast', 'had', 'die', 'curtain', 'fell', 'occurs', 'play', 'rather', 'composers', 'ending', 'crowd', 'hailing', 'Hamlet', 'now', 'king', 'Liceu', 'presentation', 'disc', 'unclear', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'alive', 'curtain', '.The', 'Ophelie', 'was', 'different', 'two', 'presentations', 'made', 'great', 'difference', 'Met', 'Simulcast', 'Natalie', 'Dessay', 'was', 'scheduled', 'play', 'opposite', 'Keenlyside', 'became', 'indisposed', 'shortly', 'opening', 'night', 'place', 'was', 'Marlis', 'Petersen', 'who', 'was', 'appear', 'later', 'season', 'Met', 'Lulu', 'Ms', 'Petersen', 'certainly', 'had', 'time', 'develope', 'role', 'had', 'sung', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'certainly', 'technique', 'art', 'role', 'somewhat', 'knifelike', 'edge', 'voice', 'betraying', 'inner', 'strength', 'will', 'better', 'suit', 'Lulu', 'Ophelie', 'really', 'appreciate', 'drama', 'pathos', 'innocent', 'maiden', 'shattered', 'completely', 'fortunes', 'life', 'listen', 'Ms', 'Dessay', 'recroding', 'redition', 'would', 'bring', 'tears', 'stone', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'Opera', 'so', 'utterly', 'beautiful.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Met', 'presentation', 'was', 'Gertrude', 'Jennifer', 'Larmore', 'mother-son', 'interaction', 'closet', 'scene', 'pivotal', 'drama', 'second', 'act', 'Dans', 'son', 'regard', 'sombre', 'proved', 'what', 'great', 'singing', 'actress', 'face', 'can', 'convey', 'terror', 'fear', 'malice', 'equal', 'measure', 'voice', 'projects', 'Gertrude', 'Uria-Monzon', 'recording', 'adequate', 'Met', 'Liceu', 'were', 'excellent', 'presentations', 'excellent', 'production', 'Tales', 'Hoffmann', 'less', 'stellar', 'opera', 'can', 'shine', 'great', 'talent', 'combined', 'inspired', 'production', 'direction']",N/A
845187,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B0002TTTK6,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[46, 47]","For sometime I've been hearing a lot about Natalie Dessay; however, only owning a few audio recordings with her,  I really didn't see what all the fuss was about.  After viewing/hearing this performance of Thomas' Hamlet, I see why she is considered one of opera's brightest stars.  Her performance as Ophelie is sublime.  This role is usually a mere display of coloratura excesses.  With Dessay it turns into far more than high notes and vocal runs-she not only sings the role magnificently, she sings it with great dramatic intensity (something that is very rare with the so-called coloratura soprano). I guess she would be called a great ""singing actress"" in the very best sense of the phrase.  Her performance really ""moved"" me.  (The audience that this performance was taped in front of was also impressed with her to a point that they were in a state of delirium from her first aria and by the ""Mad Scene"" they too had also gone completely ""mad"".)  Simon Kennlyside also gives a riveting performance.Simon's voice, at this point in his career, might be a size too small for Hamlet; however, that is soon forgotten because of the dramatic intensity he brings to the role.  He sings poor depressed Hamlet wonderfully.  The ""confrontation scene"" with Uria-monzon (as his mother) is fantastic!  I'm sure his voice will ""grow"" into the role.This production does NOT try to recreate the era; however, it is beautiful to observe-wonderful contrasting colors on a rather bare stage allowing the singers to display their dramatic qualities to the fullest-no this is not ""the Bard"" but it IS opera at its most exciting!",5,AWESOME,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1615,"['sometime', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'lot', 'Natalie', 'Dessay', 'however', 'only', 'owning', 'few', 'audio', 'recordings', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'viewing/hearing', 'performance', 'Thomas', 'Hamlet', 'see', 'why', 'considered', 'one', 'opera', 'brightest', 'stars', 'performance', 'Ophelie', 'sublime', 'role', 'usually', 'mere', 'display', 'coloratura', 'excesses', 'Dessay', 'far', 'more', 'high', 'notes', 'vocal', 'runs-she', 'not', 'only', 'role', 'magnificently', 'great', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'something', 'very', 'rare', 'so-called', 'coloratura', 'soprano', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'great', 'singing', 'actress', 'very', 'best', 'sense', 'phrase', 'performance', 'really', 'moved', 'audience', 'performance', 'was', 'taped', 'front', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'point', 'were', 'state', 'delirium', 'first', 'aria', 'Mad', 'Scene', 'too', 'had', 'also', 'gone', 'completely', 'mad', 'Simon', 'Kennlyside', 'also', 'riveting', 'performance.Simon', 'voice', 'point', 'career', 'might', 'be', 'size', 'too', 'small', 'Hamlet', 'however', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'role', 'poor', 'depressed', 'Hamlet', 'wonderfully', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Uria-monzon', 'mother', 'fantastic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'voice', 'will', 'grow', 'role.This', 'production', 'NOT', 'try', 'recreate', 'era', 'however', 'beautiful', 'observe-wonderful', 'contrasting', 'colors', 'rather', 'bare', 'stage', 'allowing', 'singers', 'display', 'dramatic', 'qualities', 'fullest-no', 'not', 'Bard', 'opera', 'most', 'exciting']",N/A

Sets are minimal, but perfect and varied. The costumes are brilliantly conceived. The lighting puts it all together and varies the pallet when needed.The acting is good not great. Keenlyside is one note as are his arias. I've read nothing but raves for Natalie Dessay, but I find her a bit too mousy with a self-obsessed delivery. She thinks she is the only one onstage. The Gertrude was magnificent, as was the Ghost of Hamlet's Father. Claudius was a little to commonplace for me--certainly not the monster he should be.Thomas' opera is uneven. He does not know how to write for men. However, his work for Ophelia and Gertrude is remarkable. But this is Hamlet's play and opera. No wonder all the reviewers are so ga-ga over Dessay.

Before you jump in however beware. This is not the bard's play. For one thing it has a semi-""happy"" ending. Hamlet lives but he is miserable. What it is is a French Grand Opera - a cousin to Gounod's Romeo and Juliet. And I would say if you like Romeo you probably will like Hamlet although the latter is not as good an opera - only one standout tune. The cast is quite good for today's standards. Dessay does the Mad Scene as well as we can expect. But I was wondering what Sutherland would have made of it. None of those to die for high notes here. Keenlyside is good. First time I've encountered him.The production is someone minimal - lots of cement walls. Is this supposed to be some warehouse. And Hamlet wears either underwear of an overcoat. When are we going to put the overcoats to rest? But the most unfortunate is Uria-Monzon as Gertrude who has half her head shaved. Yikes!And finally something someone else has commented on on EMI's Lady Macbeth also from Liceu - the sound. What is going on? It isn't as bad as he said, but the singers seem to be singing in the bathroom. Somebody correct this before it catches on.With all the caveats I'm glad I got this.
