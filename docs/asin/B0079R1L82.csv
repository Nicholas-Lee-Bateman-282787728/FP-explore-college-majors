1528648,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B0079R1L82,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[1, 1]","This is one of those shmaltzy romances from the 40s which today's audience probably wouldn't warm up to but was de rigueur for its time. Merle Oberon, a wealthy single woman, befriends and then falls in love with blind composer Dana Andrews. She initially pretends to be blind and presents herself as just another ordinary woman in love with his music, which she is, when she deliberately schemes to meet him. Attracted to his music, she wants to get Andrews out of a funk and plans to help him with her wealth but doesn't want him to know what she is up to lest he reject her largesse out of pride. She assumes her real guise to finance Andrews' compositional efforts without his knowledge and, in so doing, develops a separate relationship with him. He, of course, has no idea that the two women are one and the same. He appears to fall in love with the latter but, quite obviously, has strong feelings for the former. ""Wealthy"" Oberon puts Andrews in contact with an eye specialist who restores his sight.Long story short: Andrews completes his piano concerto (actually composed by film composer Leith Stevens) and has it premiered with Arthur Rubenstein at the piano and Eugene Ormandy as conductor.The concerto is well received and an apparent success (the richly attired all white audience would be jarring to present day audiences). While it is being played, Andrews cannot help but think of ""blind"" Oberon and, at the end, tells his sidekick (Hoagy Carmichael) that they are going to California where ""blind"" Oberon lives. Hoagy runs to tell ""wealthy"" Oberon (he knows all along about the duplicity) what Andrews intends.  Hoagy and Andrews take a train to California. Oberon flies to California (she can afford it and they can't, I guess). Andrews arrives at her home, the front door is unlocked (sigh, welcome to the 1940s), Andrews goes into the house and hears his concerto being played by Oberon on her piano. As he enters the room where she is playing, he gradually sees that ""blind"" Oberon is the same as ""wealthy"" Oberon; he smiles, sits down next to her, and they both play. Ethel Barrymore, Oberon's aunt?, comes to the edge of the room, sees the two, smiles, and retreats to the kitchen.  Happy ending.As the title to this review indicates: the best part is the Concerto. It deservedly takes its place in Hollywood filmdom music alongside the Warsaw Concerto by Richard Addinsell and the Spellbound Concerto by Miklos Rozsa. Unfortunately, it is only available in an out of print CD from Elan titled ""Piano in Hollywood"" (which has 8 Hollywood Piano Concertos and 1 Piano Solo). Therefore, this DVD (long overdue) is most worthwhile as a substitute for the CD music.",5,"THE ""NIGHT SONG CONCERTO"" IS THE BEST THING",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2685,"['one', 'shmaltzy', 'romances', '40s', 'today', 'audience', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'warm', 'up', 'was', 'de', 'rigueur', 'time', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'wealthy', 'single', 'woman', 'befriends', 'then', 'love', 'blind', 'composer', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'initially', 'be', 'blind', 'just', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'love', 'music', 'when', 'deliberately', 'meet', 'Attracted', 'music', 'get', 'Andrews', 'funk', 'plans', 'help', 'wealth', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'up', 'lest', 'reject', 'largesse', 'pride', 'real', 'guise', 'finance', 'Andrews', 'compositional', 'efforts', 'knowledge', 'so', 'doing', 'separate', 'relationship', 'course', 'idea', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'fall', 'love', 'latter', 'quite', 'obviously', 'strong', 'feelings', 'former', 'Wealthy', 'Oberon', 'Andrews', 'contact', 'eye', 'specialist', 'who', 'sight.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Andrews', 'piano', 'concerto', 'actually', 'composed', 'film', 'composer', 'Leith', 'Stevens', 'premiered', 'Arthur', 'Rubenstein', 'piano', 'Eugene', 'Ormandy', 'conductor.The', 'concerto', 'well', 'received', 'apparent', 'success', 'richly', 'attired', 'white', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'jarring', 'present', 'day', 'audiences', 'being', 'played', 'Andrews', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'blind', 'Oberon', 'end', 'sidekick', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'are', 'going', 'California', 'where', 'blind', 'Oberon', 'Hoagy', 'tell', 'wealthy', 'Oberon', 'all', 'along', 'duplicity', 'what', 'Andrews', 'Hoagy', 'Andrews', 'take', 'train', 'California', 'Oberon', 'California', 'can', 'afford', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guess', 'home', 'front', 'door', 'unlocked', 'sigh', 'welcome', '1940s', 'Andrews', 'house', 'concerto', 'being', 'played', 'Oberon', 'piano', 'room', 'where', 'playing', 'gradually', 'blind', 'Oberon', 'same', 'wealthy', 'Oberon', 'down', 'next', 'play', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'Oberon', 'aunt', 'edge', 'room', 'two', 'smiles', 'retreats', 'kitchen', 'Happy', 'title', 'review', 'best', 'part', 'Concerto', 'deservedly', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'filmdom', 'music', 'Warsaw', 'Concerto', 'Richard', 'Addinsell', 'Spellbound', 'Concerto', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'available', 'out', 'print', 'CD', 'Elan', 'titled', 'Piano', 'Hollywood', '8', 'Hollywood', 'Piano', 'Concertos', '1', 'Piano', 'Solo', 'Therefore', 'DVD', 'long', 'overdue', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'substitute', 'CD', 'music']",Night Song
1528649,AT1ZKU981AOPC,B0079R1L82,Marion,"[0, 0]","Without the performances of Dana Andrews, Merle Oberon, Ethyl Barrymore and Hoagy Carmichael, this film would be laughable. Merle Oberon plays a conveniently, fantastically wealthy woman of the Arts, who finds a skilled pianist [Dana Andrews] performing exotic jazzy orchestrations in a nightclub. Intrigued by the music, she wants to meet him and is shocked to learn he's blind, and cynical. A thoroughly preposterous love story ensues, with bad pacing to boot. But there are some interesting choices made with the music (composed by Leith Stevens) and it's got to be worth it to see real San Francisco street scenes, real Arthur Rubenstein, Eugene Ormandy, and Carnegie Hall. Better scripts have been written and 5 stars is generous, I agree - but the performances are so high quality, you can keep watching it.
