Something like American Pie, only with Bigfoot thrown into the mix. But it's nothing like that. I'm giving it two stars, because it's not terrible. It's just really really average. Pretty much the only thing that this movie gets right is the nudity. Unfortunately, most of the women who take off their clothes in this movie are flat-chested. I like big boobies. And the ladies and gay guys get to see a good looking guy's butt. Perhaps the funniest thing that happens in this movie is when a boy farts in the presence of four old men, who all act as if it's the worst thing they've ever smelled.",2,Not Very Wild,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,741,"['Bigfoot', 'Wild', 'Weekend', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'laughs', 'was', 'expecting', 'fun', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Something', 'American', 'Pie', 'only', 'Bigfoot', 'thrown', 'mix', 'nothing', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'terrible', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'average', 'Pretty', 'much', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'right', 'nudity', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'women', 'who', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'movie', 'are', 'flat-chested', 'like', 'big', 'boobies', 'ladies', 'gay', 'guys', 'get', 'see', 'good', 'looking', 'guy', 'butt', 'Perhaps', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'when', 'boy', 'presence', 'four', 'old', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'worst', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'smelled']",N/A

It's a B movie but a lot of fun to watch... the monster is just a beer loving, panty stealing party animal who wants to have a good time, and the scantily clad (or sometimes unclad) valley girls and stoner dudes actually accept him and are very cool about it! The delightfully deadpan way in which this is portrayed is so supremely silly that I simply could not help chuckling to myself throughout the movie, even though I was aware that at, taken at face value, it had to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. So dumb it's a classic! Check it out -- I dare you not to laugh at some point.
