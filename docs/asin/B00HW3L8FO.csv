I wondered if this would ever be released as it was on television only once.  Absolutely top-notch performances by an all-star cast and the storyline was very close to Arthur Hailey's book.  Very inexpensive for hours of quality entertainment.,5,Great Value For Excellent Entertainment.,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",2014,337,"['Excellent', 'reproduction', 'original', 'mini-series', 'originally', 'aired', 'back', '1970', 'wondered', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'television', 'only', 'once', 'Absolutely', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'all-star', 'cast', 'storyline', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'Arthur', 'Hailey', 'book', 'Very', 'inexpensive', 'hours', 'quality', 'entertainment']",Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers

1692747,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00HW3L8FO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","The DVD release of the 1976 miniseries &#34;Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers&#34; is a blast from the past that might best be appreciated by those who have a nostalgia factor for the era of grand TV miniseries.  Originally released over four parts, this production has subsequently been shortened and has been replayed both in a two-part version as well as a movie length endeavor.  So it is nice to have the opportunity, after all these years, to see it again as it was supposed to be seen.  For those unfamiliar with Hailey as a novelist (and he was huge), his specialty was to put a diverse group of characters together and have their lives and stories overlap in a singular setting.  Two of his biggest and most popular, &#34;Airport&#34; and &#34;Hotel,&#34; kind of set that standard.  And &#34;The Moneychangers&#34; attempts the same kind of interactions within a major metropolitan bank.  This melodramatic slice of drama is certainly dated and, therefore, might be a harder sell for modern audiences.  Let's just say that in the last forty years, both the TV landscape as well as the banking industry have morphed into entirely new entities.  So take that into consideration when diving into the pleasures of this miniseries.The primary storyline in &#34;The Moneychangers&#34; is the classic story of good versus evil.  When the aging president announces his impending retirement due to a terminal illness, the board is left to decide his successor.  Should it be the villainous Christopher Plummer or the more idealistic Kirk Douglas?  They take their time to decide, but not before Plummer goes to vigorous lengths to ruin any chance Douglas might have.  But never count out true passion, Douglas expounds on the inherent evils of the banking industry with a resolve that just might win the hearts and minds of the board.  Both actors do what they can with an oftentimes cheesy script.  Douglas is certainly convicted, but it is the oily Plummer who will end up stealing every scene he's in.  His role won him a well deserved EMMY award and his increasingly unhinged performance is a sight to behold.Don't worry if this doesn't sound like enough story to sustain the miniseries (or stay true to the Hailey formula), there are plenty of soapy sideplots to keep the action going.  Timothy Bottoms plays an embezzler who transforms into a bank informant after a rather unpleasant and arduous journey.  Douglas wants to marry a new fiancee but is held back by the tenuous mental health of his ex-wife.  Plummer's slide into anarchy includes a tryst with a young Joan Collins.  Susan Flannery (Douglas's betrothed) gets involved in a rather complex scenario to enlist the African America community into campaigning against current bank policy.  It's too much to explain, really, but leads to some of the most memorable moments.In the end, you probably already know if this miniseries is for you.  The DVD transfer is certainly rough and the soundtrack need work.  If they were going to release &#34;The Moneychangers,&#34; it would have been nice had they cleaned it up a bit.  I wouldn't consider &#34;The Moneychangers&#34; one of our TV miniseries essentials (Roots, Thorn Birds, Winds of War), but it can be a bit of melodramatic fun.  It's probably worth it for the actors alone if you are a fan of their work (and I do love what Plummer does here).  An interesting time capsule of seventies TV drama, I give this a guarded recommendation for its undeniable nostalgia factor.  But truth be told, that doesn't make it particularly good.

Particular favorites in the cast are Anne Baxter 7 years before Hotel, A pre Dynasty Joan Collins, and in smaller roles, Virginia Grey, Barry Coe, and in an early role Marla Gibbs who played Florence on The Jeffersons.
