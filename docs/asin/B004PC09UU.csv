1423528,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B004PC09UU,Eric Mayforth,"[2, 2]","The fourth season of ""Storm Chasers"" takes team leaders Reed Timmer, Sean Casey, Tim Samaras, and Josh Wurman through the plains of Tornado Alley as well as into Mississippi and Arkansas--the teams are in search of close-range video footage of the storms as well as scientific data that would increase warning times.The teams have their usual mechanical trouble and friction among team members, but also have the most successful season ever intercepting tornadoes.  Unfortunately, the 2010 season is the most poignant as well--Reed's team is first on the scene of a severe injury, and Sean's team loses a team member to a non-storm-related injury.This DVD set also contains a bonus feature that shows how the series is produced and shot, shows just how dangerous the chasers' task is, and contains a recap of the most memorable storms of recent years.",4,The Most Intense Season Yet,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,851,"['fourth', 'season', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'team', 'leaders', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Tim', 'Samaras', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'plains', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'as', 'well', 'Mississippi', 'Arkansas', 'teams', 'are', 'search', 'close-range', 'video', 'footage', 'storms', 'as', 'well', 'scientific', 'data', 'would', 'increase', 'warning', 'times.The', 'teams', 'have', 'usual', 'mechanical', 'trouble', 'friction', 'team', 'members', 'also', 'have', 'most', 'successful', 'season', 'ever', 'intercepting', 'tornadoes', 'Unfortunately', '2010', 'season', 'most', 'poignant', 'well', 'Reed', 'team', 'first', 'scene', 'severe', 'injury', 'Sean', 'team', 'team', 'member', 'non-storm-related', 'injury.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'bonus', 'feature', 'how', 'series', 'produced', 'shot', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'chasers', 'task', 'recap', 'most', 'memorable', 'storms', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

1423532,A2T0DIXULILRQR,B004PC09UU,Kris128183,"[1, 1]","To date there are 5 seasons of Storm Chasers and this is the most dramatic. Each of the 8 episodes is filled with tons of tornadoes, and plenty of drama. During the 2010 season Sean Casey gets ""the shot"", Reed and his team abandon a chase to pull people from their wrecked homes and Tim Samaras and his crew deploy a probe in a tornado and also aide in relief efforts. If I had one complaint it is that this season eliminates the narrator who presents the action as it happens. The Chasers narrate everything that happens to them and it seems a bit cheesy. In Season 5 in 2011 this issue is resolved.The DVD comes with all 8 episodes from Season 4, Behind the Scenes which takes a look at how the show is filmed, Greatest Storms which takes a look at some of the best storms and Reed's Top 10 storms of 2010.
