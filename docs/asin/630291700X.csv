I saw the original cartoons when I was a kid and absolutely loved it. Giving Tom and Jerry voices has enhanced the cartoon further which is a change from the usual if hilarious Tom and Jerry chase. The storyline is wonderful and the music is lovely.This welcome addition to the classic Tom and Jerry is fun movie for the family that is highly recommended.,5,Hilarious,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,412,"['kids', 'just', 'love', 'movie', 'see', 'very', 'often', 'saw', 'original', 'cartoons', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Giving', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'voices', 'enhanced', 'cartoon', 'further', 'change', 'usual', 'hilarious', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'chase', 'storyline', 'wonderful', 'music', 'lovely.This', 'welcome', 'addition', 'classic', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'fun', 'movie', 'family', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

345408,AQK5FGSORH9SU,630291700X,retrosunshine2006,"[0, 0]","For the longest times, I used to love this movie as a smaller child, but now, as a teen-ager in an adult body, I now realize why people lambaste this movie. I now realized that what was special given to Tom and Jerry is taken away. When T&J were silent, they use their slapstick ability and that's what made them special from their beginning. On here, when they talk, they've lost that special ability and this movie is a fix. For the record, I still like watching Tom Cat talking, not Jerry Mouse, on this movie. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this should have been a Europe only release because there is a movie that never made it here in the US called ""The Magician's Hat"" and compare to ""TAJ:TM"", that would have made a smash hit. There are other TAJ movies that are a lot better than this, like their version of ""The Nut Cracker"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"". Yep. There are more slapsticks and silence in those than this clunker. Like that old saying, ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"".",3,One of the biggest crimes I've ever liked.,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,991,"['longest', 'times', 'used', 'love', 'movie', 'smaller', 'child', 'now', 'teen-ager', 'adult', 'body', 'now', 'realize', 'why', 'people', 'lambaste', 'movie', 'now', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'special', 'given', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'taken', 'away', 'When', 'T', 'J', 'were', 'silent', 'use', 'slapstick', 'ability', 'what', 'made', 'special', 'beginning', 'here', 'when', 'talk', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'special', 'ability', 'movie', 'fix', 'record', 'still', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Cat', 'talking', 'not', 'Jerry', 'Mouse', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Europe', 'only', 'release', 'movie', 'never', 'made', 'here', 'US', 'called', 'Magician', 'Hat', 'compare', 'TAJ', 'TM', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'smash', 'hit', 'are', 'other', 'TAJ', 'movies', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'version', 'Nut', 'Cracker', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Yep', 'are', 'more', 'slapsticks', 'silence', 'clunker', 'old', 'saying', 'not', 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix']",N/A
