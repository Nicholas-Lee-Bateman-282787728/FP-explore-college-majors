Hamil,"[4, 4]","I found this film to be pretty good in spite of being just a little slow getting to the point.It was a little different in that it built the story slowly and carefully but for me it fell short in the end because it didn't comepletely answer why the wife developed this manafestation. There was a hint of parental abuse but not why she would suddenly develop bruises on her body.Still, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something that doesn't rely on car crashes or blood and guts for entertainment.",4,Interesting and different,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,533,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'spite', 'being', 'just', 'little', 'slow', 'getting', 'point.It', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'built', 'story', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'fell', 'short', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'comepletely', 'answer', 'why', 'wife', 'developed', 'manafestation', 'was', 'hint', 'parental', 'abuse', 'not', 'why', 'would', 'suddenly', 'develop', 'bruises', 'body.Still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'something', ""n't"", 'rely', 'car', 'crashes', 'blood', 'guts', 'entertainment']",Mr. Barrington

957479,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B000CDSS72,Mary Whipple,"[15, 15]","Combining the psychological torments of Lila, a young agoraphobic woman, with symbols suggesting the fall of man, director Dana Packard presents a beautifully paced and photographed thriller in which Lila's world, already limited to the confines of her house, is threatened still further by the arrival of a stranger, Mr. Barrington.  At first, the mysterious Mr. Barrington, who wears a bowler hat, formal dark clothing, and spats as he rides his velocipede, appears to be a kooky but friendly neighbor, but his increasingly personal questions soon become intrusive, and in succeeding visits, he becomes much more threatening.  Lila's saintly husband Samuel tries to keep Lila on an even keel, emotionally, until in a grand climax the battle for Lila's heart and mind reaches its peak.Lila, beautifully portrayed by talented Jennifer Nichole Porter, who also wrote the screenplay and the hauntingly romantic piano score, is a stunningly sympathetic, wounded soul.  Eric Schweig, as Samuel, grounds the film.  He is big, caring, and devoted to helping Lila, and he fills the screen with his solid presence.  Brian McCardie, a Scottish actor, is brilliant as the brittle Mr. Barrington, a man who exerts control over Lila as he metamorphoses from cheerful eccentric to devil incarnate, and by the end of the film, even his ears look pointed as he flits in and out of the house.Gorgeous cinematography (Eric J. Goldstein), with many ""foggy"" scenes emphasizing Lila's separation from reality, enhances the film and creates symbolism from the opening scene.  Throughout the film, the front gate and house doors open and close, often mysteriously, as Lila's self-isolation is threatened. Mr. Barrington first arrives at a closed gate at the entrance to Lila's antique house, but there is, significantly, no fence around Lila's yard. Samuel is frequently shown in doorways at the end of long hallways, and as he determines to discover the horrors in Lila's background, the film flashes back to scenes of her life in an orphanage and to the events from her early childhood in which the open and closed doors are also symbolic.  The apple, the fruit of knowledge, is Lila's favorite snack, and it is impossible not to associate her traumas and the climax with the struggle for the soul of man.Though this is a low-budget, independent film, the acting, the photography, and the direction are top quality.  Occasionally, however, the sound has background static, and telephone conversations and whispering are sometimes difficult to understand.  A suspenseful psychological thriller which rewards the viewer's careful attention to detail (including the reference to the William Butler Yeats poem ""Her Anxiety""), this is a fine film by a highly talented young crew.
