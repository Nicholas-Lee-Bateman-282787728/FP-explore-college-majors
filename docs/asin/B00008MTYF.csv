This movie is definitely not easy to watch, and it's definitely not for someone squeamish or overly sensitive. Frankly, this is one of the most depressing movies of all time (as with most prison dramas). It's extremely rare to find any of them that end on a good note. I mean, they all pretty much end in death, destruction, rioting, and murder by shankings. With that being said, I've definitely seen worse. For those viewers who haven't heard ""American Me"" with Edward James Olmos is 10 times worse with the graphic scenes. There's also ""Blood In Blood Out/Bound By Honor"" which is closely related to ""American Me"" and that's also pretty graphic. Of course, that's an opinion though. I also find it very strange that hetrosexual men no longer think that sex with another man is so nasty once they go to prison. Then again, I guess that brings us back to rape being about power, and not about sexual pleasure. Personally, I think these people who get off on this are sick monsters who should be put to sleep like rabid bloodthirsty cannines. I think this movie just goes to show that a person can think their the toughest person in the world, but you never know how tough you really are until your manhood gets tested by someone tougher than you are, and how weakness is taken advantage of.",3,Good...NOT GREAT!,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,1410,"['movie', 'made', 'physically', 'ill', 'Seriously', 'felt', 'puking', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'prison', 'drama', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'definitely', 'not', 'someone', 'squeamish', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'Frankly', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', 'movies', 'time', 'most', 'prison', 'dramas', 'extremely', 'rare', 'find', 'end', 'good', 'note', 'mean', 'pretty', 'much', 'end', 'death', 'destruction', 'rioting', 'murder', 'shankings', 'being', 'said', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'seen', 'worse', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'American', 'Me', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', '10', 'times', 'worse', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'also', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out/Bound', 'Honor', 'closely', 'related', 'American', 'Me', 'also', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'course', 'opinion', 'also', 'find', 'very', 'strange', 'hetrosexual', 'men', 'no', 'longer', 'think', 'sex', 'man', 'so', 'nasty', 'go', 'prison', 'Then', 'again', 'guess', 'back', 'rape', 'being', 'power', 'not', 'sexual', 'pleasure', 'Personally', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'off', 'are', 'sick', 'monsters', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 'rabid', 'bloodthirsty', 'cannines', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'show', 'person', 'can', 'think', 'toughest', 'person', 'world', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'tough', 'really', 'are', 'manhood', 'tested', 'someone', 'tougher', 'are', 'how', 'weakness', 'taken', 'advantage']",N/A
