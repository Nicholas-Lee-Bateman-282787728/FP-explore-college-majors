And yet I never missed any of the words or sexual content that would normally accompany such a film and give it a PG-13 or R rating. Just one casual F-word gives you a PG-13. But it wasn't ""needed"" in this movie. Cairo Time is an unbelievably fresh, yet classic film that surprised the hell...scratch that...heck out of me. Don't wanna tarnish that PG rating with my review. There's really not all that much I'm going to say about this film because I think its a simple film that's better to just watch and enjoy. There's nothing surprising here, no twists or turns in the plot, just a nice tale of the possibility of love between two people. The photography, sets, locations, and costumes are fantastic. Shot entirely on location in Cairo, Egypt, this film simply sparkles. The pyramids are incredible. And Patrician Clarkson and Alexander Siddig are simply spectacular in their acting. Classic! Or at least as I imagine ""classic"" to be. I wouldn't say that this is a great film that will reside in my library and be watched over and over throughout the years. But I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit it down the road. I give it 3 stars out of 5. And I give both actors 4 stars out of 5 for their performances.

1381818,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0041KT3NK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[11, 15]","This film has its strengths and its weaknesses. It is about a North American liberal woman who has come to Cairo Egypt to meet with her UN employed husband who is negotiation in Gaza. Unfortunately her husband is not able to break away from the conflict to join his wife and so she has been left alone. Thus to some extent the movie is about a woman traveling alone in an Islamic country and the cultural differences that both attract her and some which threaten her. Her husband's former employee, Tarek, now retired, is her companion while her husband is detained, opening many doors for her, including romance. The film also explores the concept that when we are in a different culture, feeling alone and isolated, and also feeling somewhat vulnerable, that our decisions and thoughts are not typical and we may act in a way that we would not under our normal circumstances.  The strength of having two characters over 50 years old is that sometimes more experienced people recognize these circumstances and are able to reconnect with former lives and attachments. The city of Cairo was beautiful and the film made me want to visit someday. The Nile River, which played a major visual role in the film, was stunning. There is a scene as to how Egyptian young men would respond to a blond North American woman walking the streets alone. They assumed they could seduce her and that she was sexually available, which highly threatened Juliette. But Juliette continues to explore. Sometimes this results in beauty and insight, especially the wonderful scene where she goes into an ancient mosque to see and hear the chanter's beautiful call to prayer. Sometimes her loneliness leads to problems, such as the scene where she tries to pass into Gaza and is turned back by the Israeli military border guards. The music throughout the film was very good, making me curious as to whether there is a soundtrack.Patricia Clarkson, playing the role of Juliette, is superb and as a great beauty now reaching age 50 she was perfect for the part. Alexander Siddig, playing Tarek, is also a good actor; sometimes however I felt he overplayed the role. There was something not quite right with his role; he seemed too physically close to Juliette too soon, which was a bit out of character.There were some weaknesses to the film. Tarek seemed a bit naive about Western North American culture which seemed out of character for a man who retired as an employee of the UN. The film was not a political statement, but a romantic statement about romance and vulnerability among those old enough to understand and reflect upon their feelings.",3,Mature adults explore vulnerability and romance in an exotic city,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2622,"['film', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'North', 'American', 'liberal', 'woman', 'who', 'come', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'meet', 'UN', 'employed', 'husband', 'who', 'negotiation', 'Gaza', 'Unfortunately', 'husband', 'not', 'able', 'break', 'away', 'conflict', 'join', 'wife', 'so', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'Thus', 'extent', 'movie', 'woman', 'traveling', 'alone', 'Islamic', 'country', 'cultural', 'differences', 'attract', 'threaten', 'husband', 'former', 'employee', 'Tarek', 'now', 'retired', 'companion', 'husband', 'detained', 'opening', 'many', 'doors', 'including', 'romance', 'film', 'also', 'concept', 'when', 'are', 'different', 'culture', 'feeling', 'alone', 'isolated', 'also', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'vulnerable', 'decisions', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'may', 'act', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'strength', 'having', 'two', 'characters', '50', 'years', 'old', 'sometimes', 'more', 'experienced', 'people', 'recognize', 'circumstances', 'are', 'able', 'reconnect', 'former', 'lives', 'attachments', 'city', 'Cairo', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'visit', 'someday', 'Nile', 'River', 'played', 'major', 'visual', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'stunning', 'scene', 'how', 'Egyptian', 'young', 'men', 'would', 'respond', 'blond', 'North', 'American', 'woman', 'walking', 'streets', 'alone', 'assumed', 'could', 'seduce', 'was', 'sexually', 'available', 'highly', 'threatened', 'Juliette', 'Juliette', 'explore', 'Sometimes', 'results', 'beauty', 'insight', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'ancient', 'mosque', 'see', 'hear', 'chanter', 'beautiful', 'call', 'prayer', 'Sometimes', 'loneliness', 'leads', 'problems', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'pass', 'Gaza', 'turned', 'back', 'Israeli', 'military', 'border', 'guards', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'curious', 'soundtrack.Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'playing', 'role', 'Juliette', 'superb', 'great', 'beauty', 'now', 'reaching', 'age', '50', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'playing', 'Tarek', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'sometimes', 'however', 'felt', 'overplayed', 'role', 'was', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'role', 'seemed', 'too', 'physically', 'close', 'Juliette', 'too', 'soon', 'was', 'bit', 'character.There', 'were', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'Tarek', 'seemed', 'bit', 'naive', 'Western', 'North', 'American', 'culture', 'seemed', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'retired', 'employee', 'UN', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'statement', 'romantic', 'statement', 'romance', 'vulnerability', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'reflect', 'feelings']",Cairo Time

The beauty of Cairo and its amazing landmarks impressed me enormously as did the gentle love story which grew as the film progressed.  A workaholic magazine writer arrives in Cairo to meet her husband who works in the Gaza Strip.  He is delayed and has arranged for an ex-workmate to meet his wife and get her settled.The husband`s delay gets longer and the friend goes to the aid of the wife, who cannot walk down a street without attracting attention and who goes unknowingly into a coffee shop which is for men only. He shows her Cairo, the bazaars, the unbelievable traffic both human and mechanical.  They take a boat trip on the Nile and sit on her hotel terrace, smoking apple steam from a giant pipe, They go to the wedding of his friend`s daughter and all the time their attraction to each other is growing.Watching this film again on DVD is again a lovely experience.  The dramatic scenery isn`t quite as grand as on the big screen, but it is still something to behold.  I really enjoyed this film, written and directed by a Egyptian Canadian.

Alexander Siddig is handsome and charismatic as Tareq, an Egyptian caf&eacute; owner who shepherds a married American tourist, Juliette, (Patricia Clarkson) around Cairo. Patricia Clarkson is beautiful and wears her many dresses well.The film's publicity compares it to ""Brief Encounter."" Not a chance. There is no chemistry between Tareq and Juliette. This is the fault of Ruba Nadda's lifeless script and direction so inert you wonder if she has fallen asleep behind the camera and the actors are too polite to wake her.There are shots of the pyramids. There are scenes where characters stroll through an exotic bazaar, smoke hookahs, and dance at a wedding. There is a scene where men harass Juliette on the street. Juliette almost seems to like it; this takes on an ugly tone in the wake of the notorious Tahrir Square assault on Lara Logan. There is an entirely gratuitous scene that depicts Israelis in a negative way. Remarkable, because the film has no plot to speak of, but the director managed to work in her prejudices. These scenes ramble without reaching any point. There is zero dramatic tension.

1381823,A2QKMTVZK2GWIH,B0041KT3NK,dnewman2,"[3, 8]","CAIRO TIME is a restrained, romantic movie about a long-married magazine editor, Juliette (Patricia Clarkson), who travels to Cairo to meet her husband, Mark (Tom McCamus), a U.N. worker.  Unfortunately, Mark is stuck in Gaza on U.N. business, so his charming former aide and friend, Tareq (Alexander Siddig), steps in to show Juliette the wonders of modern Egypt and keep her company.  Strong feelings develop between Juliette and Tareq, but of course, the consequences of acting upon them would be dire.  In this love story set in a strange, exotic land, the question for the audience is, ""Will they, or won't they?""From David Lean's SUMMERTIME to Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION, stories of women in foreign places coming romantically and emotionally unhinged have made for some terrific films.  Unfortunately, CAIRO TIME's writer/director Ruba Nadda doesn't seem to have the chops to bring her characters and setting to life.Still, Nadda's top-notch cast does their best.  Patricia Clarkson is a wonderful, resourceful actress, who wrings the most out of whatever she's given to work with.  As her Egyptian paramour-at-a-distance, Alexander Siddig is tall, good-looking, gracious and self-confident.  Who wouldn't fall for him?The movie ambles at a leisurely, uneventful pace, rarely becoming truly engaging.  Rather than building character, finding the particulars that make the audience care about Juliette and Tareq, Nadda's lead couple are mere sketches.  Through their perfunctory dialogue, we learn certain facts about their lives, but we never get a strong sense of them as people with histories and attitudes, much less senses of humor.And while her own script lets her down, Nadda's flat direction doesn't help, giving her movie a languorous, monotonous feel.  In a story like this, you want the audience to believe that Juliette is overwhelmed with feelings of dislocation and upheaval.  The city of Cairo needs to become a living, breathing entity in the film.  Whether it's Lean's Venice or Coppola's Tokyo, it's accomplished with a directorial eye that Nadda doesn't seem to possess.  The filmmaking is flat and straight-ahead.  She provides some scenic looks at the pyramids, but we never get the feeling we're diving into an unfamiliar world.  Everything is a few steps removed.But CAIRO TIME is not necessarily wasted time.

I love this movie because it's so different from most other movies. For instance, rather than making the marriage between Juliette and Mark a troubled one, the filmmaker chose to make it stable and, from what we see, happy and fulfilling. There's no clear ""bad guy"" in this movie like there are in so many movies involving love triangles.The acting is also great, especially on the part of Siddig. I'd not seen him in anything since his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine days, and I was amazed. He has the character of Tareq down to every detail, including his walk. Tareq was one of the sexiest characters I'd seen on film in a very long time, but Siddig keeps that under control. Tareq is by far the more interesting of the two characters. He's extremely respectful of women, institutions, and societal expectations, which is a great asset, but can also be a liability. He is not, it seems, the type to really go after what he wants. Rather, he lets fate decide things.The Juliette character is a little flat; she doesn't seem to have nearly as much depth as Tareq, but Clarkson does a lovely job with her, especially in the ending scene in the cab. That scene was just perfect.The scenery is also beautiful, as is the music.

Tareeq did not seem remotely interested in `Miss Juliette'. One would have to possess amazing psychic powers to deduce that emotions were bubbling under the surface. One could also argue that as a friend/employee of Juliette's husband, he would not have `gone there' anyway but I doubt that would have prevented him from trying his luck, if he really wanted to. After all, as a Muslim he knows that no Muslim man worth his salt would ever in a million years leave his wife or any female family member in the hands of another man whether that man was married or not. He was gentlemanly but quite cold and distant, with very little smiling or even interest in selling his city to a strange American woman. You saw no build up in the way that `The bridges of Madison County' seduced the viewer.A few points that I found completely unbelievable:I have been to Cairo and much of it is squalid, noisy, dirty and rowdy, however the scenes looked like the Old City of Jerusalem. I hope the average viewer is not swayed in rushing to Cairo to experience this, I can assure you that the city is mega crazy.Juliette's ignorance in just hopping on a bus to Gaza had me raging. What is it with we Westerner's who believe that the world is our oyster just because we come from a `free' country ? I felt the same way after reading Down the Nile: Alone in a Fisherman's Skiff by Rosemary Mahoney.The se xual harassment that she experienced, at the beginning....well I can well believe this. I have been to Egypt and have seen and experienced this for myself. It is very bad indeed. In her defence, I didn't think that she was dressed untoward, just that she looked like a tourist. But what surprised me was that as an Egyptian man who generally tend to be either charming or creepy, Tareeq did not leave a contact number with her when he dropped her off at the hotel, it would have prevented her from braving the streets by herself or at the very least, the hotel staff would have encouraged her to use a taxi. This I did not find believable.Secondly, I am staggered that she did not notice that no women were at the cafe and sauntered in off the streets completely oblivious. This is a predominantly Muslim country where female genital mutilation is rife and there are very specific norms in terms of how a woman should behave and one just has to respect that, even tourists.Surprised that when she decided to visit the citadel, there wasn't a soul in sight and as such was able to walk into the building as the call was being made to prayer. For a Western woman, this would never happen in a million years.The dress that she wore to the wedding and later to visit the pyramids was beautiful but way too revealing for any woman to wear on the streets of Cairo whether she was in the company of a man or not. But like I say, gorgeous dress.Get the movie for the outstanding scenery, the pyramids lit up at night is beautiful. But if you are thinking of a similar performance from Patricia Clarkson like her performance in 'Vicki, Christina, Barcelona' then you may be disappointed.",3,Breathtaking cinematography but the movie is a false representation of Cairo,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3173,"['nice', 'movie', 'lacked', 'romantic', 'punch', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'deemed', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Tareeq', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'remotely', 'interested', 'Miss', 'Juliette', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'possess', 'amazing', 'psychic', 'powers', 'deduce', 'emotions', 'were', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'One', 'could', 'also', 'argue', 'friend/employee', 'Juliette', 'husband', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'anyway', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'trying', 'luck', 'really', 'wanted', 'Muslim', 'Muslim', 'man', 'salt', 'would', 'ever', 'million', 'years', 'leave', 'wife', 'female', 'family', 'member', 'hands', 'man', 'man', 'was', 'married', 'not', 'was', 'gentlemanly', 'quite', 'cold', 'distant', 'very', 'little', 'smiling', 'even', 'interest', 'selling', 'city', 'strange', 'American', 'woman', 'saw', 'build', 'up', 'way', 'bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'seduced', 'viewer.A', 'few', 'points', 'found', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'have', 'been', 'Cairo', 'much', 'squalid', 'noisy', 'dirty', 'rowdy', 'however', 'scenes', 'looked', 'Old', 'City', 'Jerusalem', 'hope', 'average', 'viewer', 'not', 'swayed', 'rushing', 'Cairo', 'experience', 'can', 'assure', 'city', 'mega', 'crazy.Juliette', 'ignorance', 'just', 'hopping', 'bus', 'Gaza', 'had', 'raging', 'What', 'Westerner', 'who', 'believe', 'world', 'oyster', 'just', 'come', 'free', 'country', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'reading', 'Down', 'Nile', 'Alone', 'Fisherman', 'Skiff', 'Rosemary', 'Mahoney.The', 'se', 'xual', 'harassment', 'experienced', 'beginning', '.well', 'can', 'well', 'believe', 'have', 'been', 'Egypt', 'have', 'seen', 'experienced', 'very', 'bad', 'indeed', 'defence', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'dressed', 'untoward', 'just', 'looked', 'tourist', 'what', 'surprised', 'was', 'Egyptian', 'man', 'who', 'generally', 'tend', 'be', 'either', 'charming', 'creepy', 'Tareeq', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'contact', 'number', 'when', 'dropped', 'off', 'hotel', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'braving', 'streets', 'very', 'least', 'hotel', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'encouraged', 'use', 'taxi', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'believable.Secondly', 'am', 'staggered', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'women', 'were', 'cafe', 'sauntered', 'off', 'streets', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'predominantly', 'Muslim', 'country', 'where', 'female', 'genital', 'mutilation', 'rife', 'are', 'very', 'specific', 'norms', 'terms', 'how', 'woman', 'should', 'behave', 'one', 'just', 'respect', 'even', 'tourists.Surprised', 'when', 'decided', 'visit', 'citadel', 'was', ""n't"", 'soul', 'sight', 'such', 'was', 'able', 'walk', 'building', 'call', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'prayer', 'Western', 'woman', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'million', 'years.The', 'dress', 'wore', 'wedding', 'later', 'visit', 'pyramids', 'was', 'beautiful', 'way', 'too', 'revealing', 'woman', 'wear', 'streets', 'Cairo', 'was', 'company', 'man', 'not', 'say', 'gorgeous', 'dress.Get', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'scenery', 'pyramids', 'lit', 'up', 'night', 'beautiful', 'are', 'thinking', 'similar', 'performance', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'performance', ""'Vicki"", 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed']",Cairo Time

But Mark is off swanning about Gaza on an aid mission and can't make it back in a timely manner, so Juliette is left to her own devices. She discovers that walking about Cairo on her own just won't do; she's constantly stared at and followed by strange men. The surprise is that she seems surprised by this. In any case, she falls into the company of Mark's good friend, Tareq (Alexander Siddig), who takes it upon himself to show her the sights and give her some sorely-needed clues about Arab culture.Clarkson can be luminous and has done some good stuff, e.g. roles inThe Green MileandThe Station Agent. But here, she's so ethereal as to be almost invisible. And Tareq, as her potential lover in an exotic place, is entirely too passive.Only at the end, in a scene involving Mark and Juliette in the back of a taxi, did I get a faint hint of the latter's repressed yearning that was so powerfully depicted by the Francesca Johnson character (Meryl Streep) in her husband's pick-up truck at the end ofThe Bridges of Madison County, perhaps my favorite chic-flick of all time.

1381831,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0041KT3NK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Canadian director Ruba Nadda's ""Cairo Time"" is one of those slight wisps of a movie. It sets a quiet mood, and to enjoy the piece--it's best to just let it sort of flow over you. If you are expecting any real plotting, this gentle and picturesque travel document is probably NOT to your taste. However, if you're in the mood for a pleasantly involving mini-indie about unexpected connections amidst the pyramids--""Cairo Time"" is sweetly appealing. Featuring the queen of independent cinema, Patricia Clarkson, Nadda has crafted a bittersweet portrait of middle-aged attraction. It is a film that never declares its intentions overtly but lets a real kinship between its principle characters develop naturally.Clarkson plays a diplomat's wife who arrives in Cairo to join her husband (who has been stationed there) for an extended vacation. When he can't break free from his obligations, Clarkson is left isolated in the foreign city. Adjusting to the unfamiliar culture, the new time zone, concern for her husband's safety, and the differences in sexual politics--Clarkson is a stranger in a strange land. Alexander Siddig, as a former colleague of Clarkson's spouse, is the only person she knows in the city and the two start to spend more time together. From initial awkwardness to increasing familiarity, the two form a real friendship in the beautiful land. But romantic stirrings exist as well, however chaste, and this is unexpected, unsettling and immensely pleasurable to Clarkson.""Cairo Time"" is probably most successful, however, as a travelogue. The attractions, sights, and city streets are shot in all their shimmering beauty. The film functions as much as a love letter to Cairo as a fully formed narrative. Clarkson is great, as always, and Siddig is a revelation! The two share a comfortable compatibility that make it easy to spend time with them. There are a few awkward moments, however, where Clarkson is gently accosted by huge groups of men that seem slightly overcooked--but in a film this understated, it's no wonder they stuck out. Charming, all in all, ""Cairo Time"" is a small film that should be enjoyed for its unapologetically subdued pace.

Clarkson's character, Juliette,is a quiet woman who has held the fort for a husband involved in world affairs.  Her children are now grown, she and her husband are taking a long put off trip together, then he doesn't show.  She is quietly distraught and disoriented as she copes with worry, odd sleeping patterns  and the unfamiliar city.  But if you watch what is happening this is as much a story about a woman learning to know herself again, while she comes to know another person.Siddig's character is meeting a woman he has only known through a third party, her husband. As the story progresses we find he has shut himself off from love and romance. But when she comes to him for company he finds himslef talking about things he's not thought of in years.  As they spend time together they discover how much they are alike. Both quiet gentle people, who like to watch the world, take things in and can sit quietly without speaking. In the final events of the story she offers him what appears to be a small thing, but it is an enormous thing emotionally.  She gives over a memory she had planned with her husband to him, and in the end lies to keep it secret.

The movie is not only a wonderful portrait of Cairo and its people, it touches on the contrasts of US and Egyptian culture. There is a light romance, the kind you know can never be.First, there is the visual beauty of Cairo. In the print I saw the the color was not great, but this did not diminish the beauty of the city or the people. The street scenes, Tareq's coffee house, the Corniche, Khan el-Khalili, the Nile, Ramses Station, the traffic, the desert, the mosque, the wedding etc. were all true to my experience of Egypt.Then there is the beauty of the people. When Juliette asks why no one has asked her to leave the men only coffee house, Tareq says ""It would be rude"". When she says the men are following her his friend says ""You are a beautiful woman.""  This courtesy and easy grace characterized the Egyptian people I knew. The people in national dress from many parts of Africa, the many styles of hijab and galabaya reflected the diversity and spirit of Cairo. It reminds you that Egypt has been a melting pot since long before the US was even conceived.Then there was the contrast of culture. Julliette can not imagine possible dangers for her regarding the letter she has delivered. She is surprised at the reactions to her daughter's degree and her son's elopement. Tareq accepts that the girls in the carpet schools are saving for their weddings and Julliette sees exploitation. When Juliette's husband finally arrives he looks scruffy and overly casual compared to the immaculate and formal Tareq.My only criticism is about Juliette's wardrobe. The low necklines of the gown and the bathrobe don't fit the style of the film. Juliette was an intelligent woman. After a day in Cairo, why would she wear such a sheer skirt to a mosque?If you love Cairo and the Egyptian people, you will love especially love this movie.",5,Beautiful Portrait of Cairo and its People,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,1897,"['loved', 'minute', 'film', 'plan', 'see', 'again', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'portrait', 'Cairo', 'people', 'contrasts', 'US', 'Egyptian', 'culture', 'light', 'romance', 'kind', 'know', 'can', 'never', 'be.First', 'visual', 'beauty', 'Cairo', 'print', 'saw', 'color', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'did', 'not', 'diminish', 'beauty', 'city', 'people', 'street', 'scenes', 'Tareq', 'coffee', 'house', 'Corniche', 'Khan', 'el-Khalili', 'Nile', 'Ramses', 'Station', 'traffic', 'desert', 'mosque', 'wedding', 'etc', 'were', 'true', 'experience', 'Egypt.Then', 'beauty', 'people', 'When', 'Juliette', 'why', 'one', 'asked', 'leave', 'men', 'only', 'coffee', 'house', 'Tareq', 'would', 'be', 'rude', 'When', 'men', 'are', 'following', 'friend', 'are', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'courtesy', 'easy', 'grace', 'characterized', 'Egyptian', 'people', 'knew', 'people', 'national', 'dress', 'many', 'parts', 'Africa', 'many', 'styles', 'hijab', 'galabaya', 'reflected', 'diversity', 'spirit', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'been', 'melting', 'pot', 'long', 'US', 'was', 'even', 'conceived.Then', 'was', 'contrast', 'culture', 'Julliette', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'possible', 'dangers', 'regarding', 'letter', 'delivered', 'surprised', 'reactions', 'daughter', 'degree', 'son', 'elopement', 'Tareq', 'girls', 'carpet', 'schools', 'are', 'saving', 'weddings', 'Julliette', 'exploitation', 'When', 'Juliette', 'husband', 'finally', 'scruffy', 'overly', 'casual', 'compared', 'immaculate', 'formal', 'Tareq.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'Juliette', 'wardrobe', 'low', 'necklines', 'gown', 'bathrobe', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'style', 'film', 'Juliette', 'was', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'day', 'Cairo', 'why', 'would', 'wear', 'such', 'sheer', 'skirt', 'mosque', 'love', 'Cairo', 'Egyptian', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'especially', 'love', 'movie']",Cairo Time

Each time I have seen that movie I feel such intensity of unspoken desires, tension, sadness...and disillusionment.  The characters yearn for a romantic ideal which the ""object"" will inevitably fail to fulfill.  Though in ""Cairo Time"" the characters do not consummate those fantasies, the viewer feels their intensity.  During each event of the film the impulse to overcome ""rules"" and its potential for disaster, slowly works its will. Those fantasies and stirred up needs appear likely to spill over into disillusionment with ""normal life"".  Often reviewers commented that the movie expresses a superficial-cleaned up view of Cairo or that the main characters were not politically correct or sophisticated ""they should have known..."".  Yet such superficial characters and glossy settings represent a protection against deep emotion. They are revealed as brittle when ""fate"" takes a hand.  A woman who has not been admired by young men for years may feel invisible to men and perfectly safe to wander the streets.  When young men follow and crowd her she is suddenly visible and vulnerable. Unfamiliar sensations change her perceptions of others.  When the husband suddenly appears, her emotional nature tries to regain that familiar surface but instead, suddenly she shows true pain.  To summarize-- I disagree with others who deny that this film is more than a lovely unreal travelogue.

1381837,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0041KT3NK,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Opinions range across the board on Ruba Nadda's ""Cairo Time,"" and it's not a film for every taste. But for those who can appreciate the leisurely, insinuating grace of Nadda's direction and screenplay, it's an unforgettable gem. Patricia Clarkson is outstanding--giving one of the best performances of her career--as a woman at loose ends. A magazine writer and mother of grown children, she arrives in Cairo to meet her diplomat husband, only to find he is embroiled in delicate negotiations in Gaza. He has asked his close friend (Alexander Siddig), a coffee bar proprietor and retired UN official, to be her guide in his absence.Beautifully photographed by Luc Montpellier, ""Cairo Time"" begins as a film about culture shock, progresses as an earnest plea for the rights of women in Egypt and elsewhere, and ends as an almost-romance in which Clarkson and Siddig's characters develop a delicate, unexpressed but powerful mutual attraction. ""Cairo Time"" is reminiscent of several films, most notably ""Lost in Translation"" but also ""Brief Encounter"" and Francois Girard's ""Silk."" Some viewers--the ones who hated ""Silk""--will find ""Cairo Time"" intolerably slow; others, however, will thrill to the exquisitely nuanced writing and performances. I loved it, and I think viewers with sufficient patience to savor a slowly unfolding story of personal discovery will love it, too.Extras on the DVD include a ""Making Of"" documentary; a Q&A; session with Nadda, Clarkson and Siddig at the Toronto Film Festival; and a selection of Nadda's early short films.

1381838,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0041KT3NK,mirasreviews,"[6, 7]","""Cairo Time"" seems to be inspired by the restraint of silver screen romances of the 1940s. ""Casablanca"" comes to mind for Ingrid Bergman's passionate but loyal and decorous character -and for the exoticism of that Moroccan city. ""Cairo Time"" is a romantic drama, however, without political intrigue or action. The action is in the characters' emotions, but they are rarely expressed overtly. Juliette Grant (Patricia Clarkson) is a magazine editor whose husband works for the United Nations in Gaza. She has traveled to Cairo to meet him for a romantic vacation, but he has been delayed due to unrest in Gaza. So Tareq (Alexander Siddig), an Egyptian former colleague, meets Juliette at the airport and gets her settled into her hotel.The city of Cairo is a big part of this film, with all of its chaos, beauty, poverty, ancient wonders and modern skyscrapers, both Western and Eastern, Muslim and secular.  Writer and director Ruba Nadda, an Arab Canadian, references the city's relaxed pace in the title ""Cairo Time"", and she has adopted that pace for the film. But it's not dull. The film is only 90 minutes long. It's just not frenzied, as that would be out of place in the extreme heat and languorous Mediterranean culture. Juliette is going stir crazy at the hotel with nothing to do but worry about her husband, so she sets out to explore. At first alone, but when it becomes clear that is a challenge for a blond woman in an Arab city, Tareq becomes her guide.The adventure catches Juliette when her role is changing. Her children have left home. She's come a long way to be closer to her husband, but, for the moment, those plans have fallen through. Tareq is a man who is very familiar with Western ways, having worked for the UN, but he has a traditionalist streak. Juliette and Tareq make a gracious and handsome pair. Though the focus is more on Juliette's inner life during this time, I like Alexander Siddig's performance a lot. I'm not used to seeing a lot of subtlety from him, but what Tareq would never say shows on his face and in his tone: his effort to balance his annoyance with Western self-righteousness, his attraction to his friend's wife, his essentially liberal nature, and the traditions that are his identity.The DVD (MPI 2010): Bonus features are a ""Making of"" documentary, a Q&A; session, 4 short films written and directed by Ruba Nadda, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 1 deleted scene (3 min), and an audio commentary. In the ""Making of"" documentary (7 min), Ruba Nadda talks about why she made the film, the cast, and filming in Cairo. ""Toronto Q&A;"" (26 min) is a September 2009 panel discussion with the director, Patricia Clarkson, and Alexander Siddig. The audio commentary is by writer/director Ruba Nadda and cinematographer Luc Montpellier. They talk about the 25-day shoot in Cairo, scene by scene, the challenges of different etiquette and regulations in Cairo, locations, themes, pacing.

This was one of the most boring, drawn out, long, slow, pointless movies I've seen in a very long time. I was excited to see it and was very disappointed that I had.A middle-aged woman (Patrica Clarkson) goes to Cairo to see her husband who works for the United Nations. While waiting on him to arrive she begins a friendship with her husband's friend (Alexander Siddig), a native who agrees to take her around while she waits on her husband. Simple enough. The problem is the film was so boring you'd rather be in surgery without anesthesia.It fell short as a romance because the characters didn't do anything interesting enough to show they had any chemistry. It was just like they were thrown together. I blame this on the slowness of the movie. I've seen movies where people ventured to foreign lands and took in the sights but the movies were still exciting. This movie was like watching a National Geographic special. At times I forgot I was watching a movie.Patricia Clarkson was droll and dead. She had no spark, no excitement, no nothing. Listening to her was like listening to someone who read a grocery list. She showed no emotion whatsoever. You couldn't tell if she were sad, angry, happy, turned on...nothing! She was like a lifeless paper doll. I've seen Clarkson in movies and she's been more livelier than this! Her boring acting is the main reason the movie moved so slow. The most exciting part was when the men followed her around and whispered nasty things into her ear. That's the ONLY time she had a hint of emotion or reaction to anything.The only reason I watched this movie until the end was because of Alexander Siddig. He was extremely handsome, alluring and intriguing. He kept you guessing through his laid back yet seductive attitude. At least he acted as though the film engaged him which is more than I can say for Clarkson.I'm sorry but it takes more than beautiful scenery and a gorgeous foreign land for a romance to be a real romance. If you took the Egypt element out of this movie you'd have a wooden stage play. The setting was the only thing that made this movie standout. It would've had no chance if it had taken place somewhere else. I also didn't like how we were teased with them getting together at the end only for the husband to come back!

Authentic on-location shooting (that resulted in beautiful landscapes including Qasr al-Nil Bridge and the pyramids of Giza) would have been impossible after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
