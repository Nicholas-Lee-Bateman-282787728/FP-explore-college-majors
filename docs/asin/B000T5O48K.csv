1088480,A1L0OE5XWUGKTJ,B000T5O48K,,"[5, 6]","I just want to start off by saying that I loved this film. A lot of people have given it bad reviews, which is respectable, but many of the reviews were about people being ""mislead"" by the ads and trailers for the movie. One reviewer said that the trailer showed actual bugs - well, they DID show bugs in the movie. There would be brief clips of bugs squirming around; those brief clips helped show you what Agnes and Peter were seeing, especially under the microscope. But, they weren't real. I watched this movie KNOWING that it was going to be a psychological thriller, NOT a horror movie. So I honestly don't know why people get upset about thinking that it was going to be a ""sci-fi"" or about ""monsters"". All you have to do is read the back of the box, or better yet read some reviews.But, regardless of the bad reviews, I really enjoyed this movie. I like movies that have to do with mental illnesses and people going insane. What really got me was Judd's character just eating up everything that Peter told her. She was such a vulnerable character to begin with, so in misery and even a bit paranoid herself. Needless to say, she was already a bit mental before Peter arrived. He just helped her step out of the circle and into the expanding madness. A lot of people complain about movies that have to do with mental illnesses. Not me. I love both books and movies like that.I do want to mention that a lot of people are confused about the doctor smoking. I didn't think anything of it at the time because what I was thinking was ""Okay, he's a doctor and he's trying to sit down and calm her down so that he can talk to her and they can feel comfortable"". In otherwords, he's trying to tell her ""Look, I'm just like you, let's try and see eye to eye"". So, it makes sense to me, not so much to others obviously.The only thing I didn't like was that it was too short. I feel like if they had drawn it out more it would have been better, much more impacting. It didn't really creep me out. I didn't expect it to. I didn't even consider it a horror. It's the concept and everything behind it that stays with you. This guy thinks he has bugs and he's manipulated this woman to think she has them too. That's the idea, not that ""this isn't even about bugs"" or ""this isn't horror"" or ""where are the monsters and action"". It's a psychological thriller. You've got to think deeper than just what's given to you in the film. The idea is to leave you with thinking that, if you're not careful, anyone can manipulate you, just like Jim Jones and just like Peter did with Agnes. Especially vulnerable people. That is what I got from the film. That people can be twisted into something that isn't real and how, as humans, we can believe almost anything, no matter how bizzare.Great movie overall. I won't recommend other movies like reviewers on here do. Instead I'll just say give this one a try. If you don't like it, that's cool.

As much as I am a lover of gory horror films (not to say this isn't gory), but I also like psychological horror films like Silent Hill. This is more on the lines of a psychological horror film, but it commits the cardinal sin of cinema; IT'S BORING. When I saw this film I was even willing to forgive the director, William Friedkin. Why? To tell you the truth, I hated The Exorcist. Sure it had its creepy moments, but it was so unbelievably boring. I found Bug to be far more entertaining, but it was still weighed down by boredom. Unfortunately this film just boils down to a hidden message; Never have sexual intercourse without protection. Or the more likely message would be don't have sexual intercourse with a crazy schizophrenic man.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A woman named Agnes (What a horrible name for a woman) is a waitress living in a motel room hiding from her abusive ex-husband. Agnes is a chain-smoking, drug-using, middle-aged, wannabe lesbian woman struggling with her guilt of losing her son years ago. Then a man named Peter her female lover brings along to her motel room stays with her and they grow closer together and then make love one night and then later that night is when they start to see the ""bugs."" Slowly but surely Agnes begins going insane with Peter and they both become convinced that bugs are attacking them and that the military experimented on Peter and they're after him.MUSIC: Rarely appears, and when it does it's not good.ACTION: This film has nice gore touches and you get somewhat of idea of the couple's insanity. There is some tension to be had throughout the film, but unfortunately this film is mostly focused on boring dialogue. This film starts off slow and never picks up steam until the ending.ACTING: The actors were good, but unfortunately they were given almost nothing but boring dialogue. Overall they were very professional and talented, but the very long-winded dialogue dragged this film down.OVERALL: Cautionary rental. There are great ideas here that are sadly not used to their potential. You must be a person who does not get easily bored, if you're not you will hate this film.THE GOOD: The gore, the ending, and the actors.THE BAD: The music and horrendously long-winded dialogue.",3,A MISSED OPPORTUNITY  6.5 OUT OF 10,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2277,"['Bug', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'great', 'As', 'much', 'am', 'lover', 'gory', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'gory', 'also', 'like', 'psychological', 'horror', 'films', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'more', 'lines', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'cinema', 'IT', 'BORING', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'willing', 'forgive', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Why', 'tell', 'truth', 'hated', 'Exorcist', 'Sure', 'had', 'creepy', 'moments', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'boring', 'found', 'Bug', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'was', 'still', 'weighed', 'down', 'boredom', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'just', 'boils', 'down', 'hidden', 'message', 'Never', 'have', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'protection', 'more', 'likely', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'crazy', 'schizophrenic', 'man.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'woman', 'named', 'Agnes', 'What', 'horrible', 'name', 'woman', 'waitress', 'living', 'motel', 'room', 'hiding', 'abusive', 'ex-husband', 'Agnes', 'chain-smoking', 'drug-using', 'middle-aged', 'wannabe', 'lesbian', 'woman', 'struggling', 'guilt', 'losing', 'son', 'years', 'ago', 'Then', 'man', 'named', 'Peter', 'female', 'lover', 'brings', 'motel', 'room', 'grow', 'closer', 'together', 'then', 'make', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'then', 'later', 'night', 'when', 'start', 'see', 'bugs', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'Agnes', 'going', 'insane', 'Peter', 'become', 'convinced', 'bugs', 'are', 'attacking', 'military', 'experimented', 'Peter', ""'re"", 'him.MUSIC', 'Rarely', 'when', 'not', 'good.ACTION', 'film', 'nice', 'gore', 'touches', 'get', 'somewhat', 'idea', 'couple', 'insanity', 'tension', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'mostly', 'focused', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'film', 'slow', 'never', 'up', 'steam', 'ending.ACTING', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'given', 'almost', 'nothing', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'were', 'very', 'professional', 'talented', 'very', 'long-winded', 'dialogue', 'dragged', 'film', 'down.OVERALL', 'Cautionary', 'rental', 'are', 'great', 'ideas', 'here', 'are', 'sadly', 'not', 'used', 'potential', 'must', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'get', 'easily', 'bored', ""'re"", 'not', 'will', 'hate', 'film.THE', 'GOOD', 'gore', 'ending', 'actors.THE', 'BAD', 'music', 'horrendously', 'long-winded', 'dialogue']",N/A

1088488,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000T5O48K,Andrew Ellington,"[29, 36]","I have a feeling that I may break down in tears during this years Oscar nominations ceremony, for as much as I'd love to have faith in the Academy to `do the right thing' I strongly feel that Ashley Judd's brilliant performance is going to ultimately get the snub.  To say that she doesn't deserve the win let alone the nomination is to not have really seen this film for all that it truly is.  Ashley Judd's performance is her career best, a desperate and broken spirit that permeates the entire film and haunts the viewer more than anything else pertaining to this film.  In fact, the most disturbing thing about `Bug' is the fact that it will most likely receive little to no awards attention.  I'm getting chills just thinking about it.I think the first thing anyone needs to know about `Bug' is that it is not, and I mean `NOT' a horror film in the essence that it is jumpy and intense and consistently frightening but it is in it's own way jumpy and intense and consistently frightening.  `Bug' is a film about the darkest corners of the human mind and the fact that we will allow ourselves to believe anything if it completes a part of our soul.  I feel that this film suffered from misleading advertisement that painted it as this horrifically scary film when it is in most regards a slow moving physiological drama.  There are lots of scenes of pure communication as we watch these peoples minds gradually deteriorate into the hopeless paranoia they find themselves engulfed in.  In fact the bulk of the gore in the film is self inflicted, the majority taking place off screen.Based on the play by Tracy Letts, `Bug' follows the lonely Agnes White who is in hiding from her abusive ex-husband Jerry.  Jerry has just been released from prison and is planning on taking back up where he left off with Agnes, but she isn't having that.  Instead she's moved on to another man, the mysterious and reclusive Peter.  Agnes and Peter lock themselves away in a small motel room and it's there that they slowly go insane.  Peter, a war veteran, has already lost most of it.  He is convinced that the government is after him, that they conducted experiments on him and that they planted bugs under his skin.  Before long Agnes's own loneliness and desperation lead her to believe him and she soon begins to see the bugs that are not really there.The film rarely leaves the confines of the motel room and this aids in the feeling of claustrophobia.  I remember feeling this way when I watched last years `The Descent', that feeling of breathless anxiety.  Although the viewer never sees a single insect there are moments when you can swear they are everywhere.  This is thanks in large part to the commanding direction by William Friedkin who completely understands the objective of his subject and exploits it beautifully.To me the bugs are clearly a metaphor for the `bugs' or `kinks' in the human mind.  These two people are sick.  Their minds do not function properly.  They haven't had the `bugs' worked out so-to-speak and thus suffer from delusions and serious deficiencies that those around them cannot understand.  The scary thing about `Bug' is that this is not really an exaggeration of these issues.  These types of things happen more frequently then one would think.  The human mind is no where near as full proof as one might like to think and truly anyone is susceptible to the downward spiral of insanity.  The worst part about it all is that one never knows they are insane.Ashley Judd gives, for me at least, the finest performance of anyone in any category so far this year.  Her grasp of Agnes is brutally convincing and extremely sympathetic.  Like a child she defends the man she feels connected to, the only man who's given her the kind of attention's she's longed for.  Her slip into paranoia is painfully heart breaking to watch to the point that I was moved to tears especially in the final scenes.  Her facial expression as her whole world incinerates before her is enough to make my heart break into a thousand pieces.  If there is a god then Ashley Judd's name will be called proceeded by ""and the Oscar goes to"" come March (or whenever the Oscar's are held this coming year).The other performances in the film are decently entertaining, with the exception of Harry Connick Jr. who is surprisingly outstanding.  I am not a fan of Harry and I was not looking forward to him being in this film but I was floored to find myself loving his performance.  He was comical, aggressive, charismatic and believable.  I would also consider his name in the supporting actor category AMPA's, seriously.  I was less impressed with Michael Shannon who reprised his stage role as Peter Evans.  His performance was not bad but it failed to deliver any real spark.  Judd was just so impressive and Connick Jr. was just so commanding that Shannon seemed to fall to the background for me even though he was in just about every frame.  Lynn Collins was wonderful as R.C. and would have been even better had she possessed a little more screen time.  What she does with what she's given is very impressive.If you're looking for a film that will scare the pants off you in a general gore filled heart racing kind of way then this is not the film you want to pick up, but if you want to be slowly driven to the brink of insanity by watching the lives of two people slowly unravel then this is the movie for you.  In fact, I think it's even more horrifying to watch something this tragically real then to embrace something that is completely fictitious and ultimately unbelievable.",5,Burrows deep into your skin

She has a recently paroled husband who terrorizes her, and years earlier, her 7 year old son was abducted,which the guilt from that alone was probably what made her give up on life.Anyway, her co-worker introduces her to a drifter, who she becomes quickly attached to.The role she plays is so sad. She is so lonely, that she overlooks this new guy's quirky personality, and becomes totally convinced that he was part of an experiment while in the service, and was injected with bugs.These egg sacs are supposed to be growing and hatching in him and he uses self-mutilation to remove them.She, too becomes convinced that she is infected and starts digging at herself.From here, the level of paranoia and insanity the two of them go through will make you want to SCREAM !!At one point in the movie when he begins pulling out his teeth with pliers...you just MUST turn away.And what he finds here under the microscope, had me thinking ""IS he really crazy?""And the longer she is with him, she begins to be just as bad as him, or even worse in her delusions...up to the point that the whole room is literally COVERED in foil.I know, I know!! - I am giving away a lot here, but as deep as this mind trip goes, it really is only a small part I gave away, and I only did that to peak some interest in this story (which I think is EXCELLENT) because of all the bad reviews it got.I say, give it a chance!

She is a drug-addicted alcoholic w/ absolutely nothing on the horizon to interupt her slow self-annihilation. Agnes lost her 6yo son in a grocery store 10 years ago, and most of her soul appears to have disappeared with him. Now, she drifts through her half-life, waking just long enough to drain another bottle of oblivion-inducer, or fire up another bowl of extreme pain-reliever. Enter Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), a nice, quiet young man who captures Agnes' devastated heart almost immediately. It's love at first sight, or something like that. Meanwhile, Agnes' total loser of an ex-con / ex-husband, Goss (Harry Connick, jr.) begins creeping around, threatening to move in on Agnes to help her to re-live the bad old days of his violence and control. Peter represents paradise by contrast. All seems fine until soon after Agnes and Peter consumate their relationship. Peter finds a small insect in the bed. Agnes can't see it, but Peter is very convincing! This leads to a downwardly spiralling binge of paranoid conspiracy theories, delusions, self-mutilation, and murder. These are two sick people. Two disturbed minds that have found their match. Two empty souls that have gravitated toward each other's deadness in a hopeless attempt at fulfillment. This is insanity squared, as the two become one shrill voice of un-reason. This can only end one way, and... it does... BUG is a tale of terror with the most hideous psychological monsters unleashed.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[26, 30]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***Based directly on the stage play by the same name, BUG will most certainly get under your skin. Although thriller in nature, horror fans should be warned that there are no supernatural or superhuman elements in the story. Looking at the DVD cover, one gets the impression that it might be a spin-off of something along the lines of Alfred Hitchcock'sThe Birds, but Bug couldn't be further from it. No mutant grasshoppers. No aligning of planets that results in bloodthirsty arachnids.Stage play actor Michael Shannon reprises his role on the silver screen as drifter Peter who falls for lonely waitress Agnes played by Ashley Judd. Agnes is damaged goods to begin with; a woman who's lost her only child to a kidnapping and drowns herself in liquor and cocaine. And when she meets Peter, she believes she may have found someone to connect with other than her abusive ex-husband Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.,The Iron Giant). But Peter brings with him his own unique brand of psychological luggage. A battered U.S. veteran who possibly was exposed to torture, Peter begins showing cracks in his psyche soon after their first romantic encounter. He claims that bugs are in the room with them. Then the bugs are in him. Then in her. Then everywhere and involving everyone. The paranoia reaches a crescendo that culminates in the death of someone trying to help Peter and Agnes, and the eventual destruction of everything around them.First let's be clear what we're talking about here. There are no bugs. We, the audience, don't see a single flea. The bugs are internalized as demonic aphids implanted in Peter (Shannon) by military higher-ups. As Peter's paranoia builds, he brings Agnes right along with him, and it's a painful and frightening thing to watch. Initially having hopes that the two might be able to help one another, the story rapidly gives way to the psychological horrors of what happens when mentally damaged people feed off one another like ...well ...like bugs.Second is that the story, too, is completely internalized, both character-wise and on the set. The entire production basically takes place in one room: Agnes' rundown hotel room in the middle of nowheresville. Don't expect panoramic shots of beautiful locales.Third is that this story is exceptionally dark. There are no good and bad people, per se. Agnes' abusive ex is initially seen as a no good A-hole but later becomes a beacon of hope for survival. Even a psychologist who comes in to try and help Peter is damaged in that he's hooked on cocaine himself and seems only passively interested in telling the truth.For horror fans, this one's going to disappoint. But if you're a psych major or interested in paranoid delusions and how far down those people can sink, Bug will crawl right up your alley.",4,Know The Difference Between Horror and Psychological Thriller?

1088499,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B000T5O48K,Brian Driver,"[1, 6]","I sat down to watch this film late one night, finding myself repulsed by the movies's description but intrigued by the actors who took on roles within it.  What could possibly have drawn them into this, I thought?  What would attract good, established actors to such a repulsive project?That's when I realized the director was William Friedkin, and it all made sense.  Well, some sense...for what Hollywood actor would give up the chance to work with a (once) great Hollywood director, even if things haven't gone well for him over the last three decades?  He still is capable of great things.Sure...he hasn't had a hit since 1974.  But admit it: the man had directed two powerhouse smash hits in the early 70s, ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist,"" then took a couple years off and came back later that same decade with another strong film called ""The Sorceror.""  Smart move, huh?  Follow ""The Exorcist"" -- which scared the pants off everybody -- with another great satanic film.  What could go wrong?Well, for one thing, it had NOTHING to do Satan.  It was a slow, thoughtful film about men who were down on their luck, and eventually had to drive trucks full of nitroglycerin through a horrid jungle.  The film tanked, as did a couple more that followed, and a terrific director was relegated to the odd films that popped up here and there.Like ""Bug.""Well, I watched it, and I can't say it wasn't mesmerizing.  But I can't  say I liked it, either.  I will say this: it's the kind of film I could only recommend to a small circle of oddball friends..the ones who might sit up late at night and talk about the strangest film they've ever seen.OK, I guess it was interesting, but only in the sense of having your car break down in the middle lane of traffic in the midst of NY City morning commute.  I know it must have been compelling to work with Friedkin, but wasn't there something else in the till?  Did THIS have to be the project that brought these talents together?Face it: ""Bug"" is a repulsive film.  The best characters within it are down-on-their-luck dead enders who face their problems with booze and drugs.  The character who has the greatest chance of saving one or even both of the key characters at the end of the movie is a disgusting wife beater who just got out of jail.  Everyone is untrustworthy, and no one is even likable.All right, I get it: that's kind of the point of the film.  But why watch it?  What is the message?  That no one is credible?

Bug is more of an alarming psychological journey into the human mind, an intense exploration of a broken soul.  It's closer to the films Beautiful Mind and Conspiracy Theory than something like Aliens or The Fly.  Director William Freidkin opens the crazy door and dares you to step inside.The acting and character development in this movie is outstanding.  Ashley Judd gives the performance of her lifetime as Agnes, an emotionally battered waitress who is hanging on by a thread.  She has a trainwreck of a past, from her abusive ex-husband to her missing child.She meets a mysterious loner named Peter, and he might offer a hand toward gaining some mental stability.  Or he might push them both over the edge.  We quickly realize it's most likely the latter, as this romance doesn't take long to unravel.  Peter is a war veteran, and claims to be the victim of some extreme government experimentations.  His military leaders apparently planted ""bugs"" under his skin.  This may or may not be true, but one thing is for sure--his inner demons are about to come crawling out.Freidkin unleashes a totally original and riveting psychological drama.  The symptoms of this story frantically spread and feed off your mind in frightening fashion.  A psychotically sick tale that plagues you with themes of loneliness, desperation, and mental instability.  Plus it lightly touches on notions of government control and the devastating effects of war.  Such a great film, one that might come off as ridiculous to some as it blazes an unfamiliar path.

1088504,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000T5O48K,Chris Pandolfi,"[14, 18]","William Friedkin's ""Bug"" is the kind of psychological thriller that doesn't rely on plausibility so much as it relies on solid character studies. This isn't to say that the film is implausible; truth be told, I don't think there's any way of knowing how realistic such situations are. But considering the disturbing intensity of the story and the strong dynamic between actors Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, it's difficult to embrace these technicalities. This is easily one of the most unsettling films in recent memory, forcing the audience down an unpleasant path of paranoia that spirals out of control in a relatively short period of time. The film refuses to be a clear-cut study of insanity; there's a subtle brilliance to the way Friedkin explores uncertainty and panic, as if to say that we're not meant to have all the answers.Nor should we. What is obvious is that, from the average person's point of view, every behavior in this film is overwhelmingly irrational. We get a small taste of this with the introduction of Agnes White (Judd), a divorcee living in a motel somewhere in the middle of Oklahoma. The first scene is of her receiving mysterious phone calls, in which the person at the other end says absolutely nothing. Already, she assumes that it's her violent, controlling ex-husband, Jerry Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), recently released from prison on parole. Indeed, it does seem likely that he's making the calls. But does she know for sure? How can she know? How can the audience know? Even when he reenters her life later on in the film, it's impossible to come to any conclusions. It could be that Agnes is allowing her fear to take hold. The fact that she's incredibly lonely only adds to her erratic emotional state.Then along comes Peter Evans (Shannon), an initially soft-spoken man with an underlying uneasiness that effectively makes us uncomfortable. He's a drifter with a hidden past who occasionally lets loose his expanded vocabulary (Agnes is initially confused by the word ""matriarchal""). He makes it clear that he's not really interested in a sexual relationship (not at first, anyway); he merely wants to be friends. From the audience's perspective, everything about this situation is off; here are two fragile individuals looking for companionship under less than ideal circumstances. Is it any wonder that Agnes' willingness to take him in is unnerving? It doesn't help that she listens to him carefully, even when he begins spewing information about tiny bugs he thinks are infesting his bloodstream. In some sick way, it's as if he's telling her what she wants to hear.The rest of the film veers into territory ruled purely by paranoia, the tension building itself until it becomes unbearably thick. Peter eventually reveals that he's an AWOL military officer; he believes that a faction of the government has injected him with thousands of microscopic aphids that have the ability to transmit information. He's now on the run from Dr. Sweet (Brian F. O'Byrne), the man responsible for conducting the experiments. Not only is he able to convince Agnes of this, he also makes her believe that she has now become infested. While we don't see any bugs, they believe that they're seeing them everywhere, especially on their skin. Supposedly, they can burrow through the skin back into the bloodstream; this forces Peter and Agnes to incessantly swat, scratch, and pick at themselves. Eventually, their bodies are covered with open sores.As the film progresses, Agnes' room transforms into a bizarre kind of shelter; bug zappers and flypaper hang from the ceiling, while every other surface is coated in aluminum foil (it helps to block the bugs' transmissions). How they went about this doesn't matter. The plot was never interested in focusing on logistics, and rightfully so. We're now fully immersed in the delusional world of two people who were made for each other, a world in which nonsensical ramblings make perfect sense. The last ten minutes of the film have both Judd and Shannon delivering high-intensity speeches that almost come off as poetic in a twisted sort of way; their words point to an explanation only they can understand, and in turn offer a solution that only they see as appropriate. How the audience feels is of no concern, and that's exactly the way it should be. When both Peter and Agnes look into a microscope holding a drop of Peter's blood, the sense that they're seeing what they want to see allows us to emotionally detach from the characters and let them continue to unravel.During the end credits, I learned that ""Bug"" originated as a play written by Tracy Letts (who also penned the screenplay). I then left the theater wondering how this ever could have been performed on a stage, not because of the sets or the story, but because of the sheer intensity; it's difficult to imagine a live audience sitting through something so disturbing. However, if this film adaptation is any indication, then the play must have something truly unique, a fascinating work that delves into insanity with amazing precision and style. But until I actually see it, then my praise can apply only to the film.

1088507,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000T5O48K,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","With so many horror movies lately that seem to assume it's tendency to stack the film to the nose with gore will scare audiences, it's kind of gratifying to finally watch a film that doesn't simply focus on it. Directed by William Friedkin who did possibly the best horror movie ever with the Exorcist as well as doing the French Connection, you're thinking Bug will be the same thing right? Not really. On first viewing, it's interesting if a little slow and hard to emotionally invest in characters and it might not have the same replay value again but it's a disturbing look into paranoia and is at least worth a watch.Agnes is a bar waitress in a small town who's trying to get out of the grip of her controlling, abusive ex Jerry. With her drug habit and a horrible event from her life, Aggie is not as open to meeting new people until her friend/lover R.C. brings home a stranger named Peter. Very unassuming with a quiet demeanor, Peter seems perfect for Aggie and they get together. But Peter has this problem with seeing bugs everywhere and Agnes gets drawn into it as well and the 2 become increasingly paranoid about being infested not only in the room but inside their own bodies.What sets Bug apart from films like Hostel and Saw is the film focuses mainly on the paranoia and delusions that the characters are facing with more violent elements being part of the characters rather than staging entire scenes around it. That said, it's a very slow moving film with characters talking...and talking a lot about bugs and it's more voyeuristic where we see characters become insane rather than understand or relate, we simply just watch. However, the film has somewhat of a cold feeling to it, as if the first viewing was enough so it might be hard to re-watch since we already know what the film was going to be and the tone it has.Inspired by a play, the film is as minimilist as it can get with less than 8 main speaking parts and one scene involving extras so the film doesn't have a narrative so to speak so it's mainly character-driven and luckily we have Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon to watch. Sane though lost, the 2 unravel and they become crazier by the minute when the bugs arrive (although it's funny it's the 5th film in a row I've seen of Judd where she disrobes).

It makes people uncomfortable.""""Pick up on things?""""Things not apparent,"" Peter says.With that, William Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, working from Letts' play, put us in the middle of an intense and controlled descent into madness. Bug may be a one-theme movie placed almost exclusively in a small, two room set, but thanks to Friedkin, Michael Shannon as Peter Evans and Ashley Judd as Agnes White, it will not only give you the creeps, it'll make you appreciate some fine movie making.Aggie is one of life's losers, worn, dumb, lonely and passive, with a smoker's voice, a four-letter vocabulary and an abusive ex-husband who is just out of the slammer. She has a loss-leader job as a waitress in a honky tonk lesbian bar. Aggie is attractive in a white trash way, and she looks every one of Ashley Judd's 38 years. She lives in a crappy motel in some desolate part of Oklahoma just off the highway. Peter Evans is a quiet loner who was picked up by Aggie's lesbian best friend on the way to a party. He is polite and has no place to stay. Aggie is lonely and offers her couch for him to sleep on. He doesn't want sex. There is a need in both of them that makes a terrible connection.Peter believes in things he knows are true...the machines...the people watching...that nothing will ever be the same. And then there are the insects he finds in the bed sheets, little ones, perhaps a bedbug, or a spider. ""If there's one, do you have any reason to suspect there's more of him?"" Aggie asks. ""Makes sense,"" Peter says with complete seriousness. ""You're assuming it's a him, some rogue aphid on his travels instead of some matriarchal type with a big brood somewhere...Ever watch `Big Valley'? Barbara Stanwyck? Like her."" The way Michael Shannon delivers the line, it's not funny.Aggie is needy and lonely enough to believe. Separately, she probably would have become an over-weight, sloppy alcoholic, waiting on tables in crummy diners. Peter is a schizophrenic paranoid. Separately, he would have wound up drugged to his eyeballs in a public health facility for a week or two, then sent back out to the streets. Together, they feed on each other. Peter knows the federal government has used genetically engineered coke bugs as a component in the poison sprays used to destroy South American cocaine fields. The bugs will survive the drug processing and then attack and kill American coke uses. He can see the bugs infesting the motel room. They're microscopic and have entered his blood stream. Aggie now can see them, too. Reality and delusion have joined. The last half hour is grotesque and violent, with their two rooms sheathed in aluminum foil, scrunched and squeezed to cover every window frame, ceiling, floor and wall. The paranoia is in full, deadly blossom. The conclusion is what we've been led up to.All this could be ludicrous, even with Tracy Letts' fine screenplay. That it isn't is due to Friedkin, Shannon and Judd. Friedkin, within a confined space, manages to keep a sense movement going, with madness, claustrophobia and tension moving right up the scale. More than anything else, however, the movie works because of the two actors. There are only three other significant roles in the movie and they are well handled, especially by Harry Connick, Jr. as the abusive sleaze of an ex-husband. But it is Shannon and Judd who make this movie work. They each start off in a low-key, gradually letting us get to know their characters and building sympathy for them. His madness and her desire to have someone to believe in are delivered with increasing intensity that never, in my opinion, lurches into indulgent over-acting. That's a rare thing in American movies nowadays. It was particularly fine to see this in Ashley Judd. She started out so well inRuby in Paradise, then seemed to lose her way in a number of big budget Hollywood hokums. Now 40, she's reached a time when there are a lot of younger, nubile actresses just aching to play stylish vampire hunters or glamorous government agents. I hope that she finally has decided to be an actress, not just another Hollywood star flavor of the year.The DVD transfer is first-rate. Extras include a commentary by Friedkin, an on-camera interview with him and a behind the scenes look at the movie.",4,A fine movie of paranoia and neediness.

I expected the film to resemble a play, because it's based on one, but it ended up being like the worst kind of play...an avant-garde mess of ridiculous rambling monologues, out of control performances, and weirdness that you really have to see to believe.I knew going in that the movie would be more about paranoia and/or mental disorder than actual bugs, which could have been great if the movie had gone in a different direction.  A film with that kind of subject matter needs to be dark, serious and uncomfortable to watch.  But Bug is laughable, and I mean that literally.

Granted, it was a mainstream crowd watching a decidedly un-mainstream movie (thanks to some dishonest marketing, in my opinion).  But I consider myself a fairly intelligent viewer, and I was laughing right along with everyone else.I can't really think of any reason to see this film.  I'm a fan of both horror movies and psychological films like Jacob's Ladder, and I don't think Bug appeals to either of those audiences.  It's a big mess of performances devoid of subtlety in an absurd story with some scenes that don't even make sense.

There were too many weak leaks in this movie. Psychological thriller is a specific sub-genre of the wide-ranging thriller genre.Generally; thrillers focus on plot over fictional characters, and thus emphasize intense physical action over the character's psyche. Psychological thrillers tend to reverse this formula to certain degree, emphasizing the characters just as much, if not more so, than the plot. This movie shows two characters preying upon one another minds, either by playing deceptive games with the other or by merely trying to demolish the other's mental state. This character had a severe disorder marked by degeneration of mental and social functioning and withdrawal from reality. The character Ashley played, was along venerable and physically abuse.

It is based on the play (written by Tracey Letts, who also adapted it and wrote the screenplay for the movie).  It's a sad tale of a lonely, very damaged, cocaine snorting, pot smoking, divorced waitress (played superbly by Ashley Judd), a stranger (played to perfection by Michael Shannon), and an ex-con boyfriend (played by Harry Connick, Jr.).  Agnes (Judd) is introduced to the stranger and almost instantly falls for him--albiet out of sheer loneliness.  However, in her interaction with him she finds out that he is AWOL from the Army and claims they have infested his blood with parasites.  What happens next will have you eventually turning from the screen in horror.It isn't too often that ""horror"" movies of this type surface.

Bug was originally a play, which is completely obvious in it's delivery.  Long scenes of 2 people interacting (with an occasional 3rd thrown-in) and all taking place in the confines of a single set (a run-down motel room is honestly where 99% of the movie takes place).  Luckily for director William Friedkin and the viewer, the actors all give their best effort with the kind of gusto needed for the delirium put forth on screen (never seen Ashley Judd look so rough... or full-frontally nude!).  Ultimately the movie provides enough in the set-up, Friedkin's always great direction, and the aforementioned acting to make this a worthwhile viewing... at leat once, though I'm not sure that anyone will love it enough to want to see it again anytime soon (kinda tedious for several viewings).  A few scenes of gore (not much though) and a couple ""twists"" (nothing you don't see coming) help push the finale into a maddneing crescendo that, like most of the movie, delivers but doesn't leave much of an impression.  William Friedkin has attempted the horror genre a couple of times with mixed results (personally I LOVE The Guardian though!) and this fits in with those films pretty well... unfortuantely I think it's safe to say that he doesn't have another Exorcist in him (but I hope I'm wrong).",3,The great debate... to remove the bug egg sack from your face or not to?!,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1653,"['expecting', 'traditional', 'horror', 'film', 'Bug', 'may', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'what', 'actually', 'get', 'here', 'slow-burn', 'type', 'film', 'psych', 'study', 'irrational', 'depraved', 'behavior', 'lonliness', 'can', 'create', 'almost', 'feels', 'film', 'student', 'minor', 'psychology', 'decided', 'make', 'informative', 'video', 'got', 'little', 'hand', 'Bug', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'completely', 'obvious', 'delivery', 'Long', 'scenes', '2', 'people', 'interacting', 'occasional', '3rd', 'thrown-in', 'taking', 'place', 'confines', 'single', 'set', 'run-down', 'motel', 'room', 'honestly', 'where', '99', '%', 'movie', 'place', 'Luckily', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'viewer', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'effort', 'kind', 'gusto', 'needed', 'delirium', 'put', 'forth', 'screen', 'never', 'seen', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'look', 'so', 'rough', 'full-frontally', 'nude', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'enough', 'set-up', 'Friedkin', 'always', 'great', 'direction', 'aforementioned', 'acting', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'leat', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'will', 'love', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon', 'kinda', 'tedious', 'several', 'viewings', 'few', 'scenes', 'gore', 'not', 'much', 'couple', 'twists', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'help', 'push', 'finale', 'maddneing', 'crescendo', 'most', 'movie', 'delivers', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'impression', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'attempted', 'horror', 'couple', 'times', 'mixed', 'results', 'personally', 'LOVE', 'Guardian', 'films', 'pretty', 'well', 'unfortuantely', 'think', 'safe', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'Exorcist', 'hope', ""'m"", 'wrong']",N/A

The person who directed it directed the Exorcist so he definately knows how to unsettle people.  It's not the violence that was unsettling because only three people get killed in the whole film.  What's unsettling about it was watching a man's descent into madness and watching him completely lose touch with reality.  Not only that, but watching how a man was able to plant some very powerful and absurd ideas into a lonely woman's head and even take things a step further, made it doubly unsettling.What I got out of the film is that a person's belief is a very powerful thing.

After all, it said as much on the box, and was directed by William Friedkin, who brought us 'The Exorcist'.  Be advised that if that kind of movie is what you want to watch, you need to rent or buy something else. Based on a stage play of the same name, 'Bug' takes place almost exclusively in a small and grotty motel room and the even smaller, grottier spaces of the protaganists' minds.  I guess we could call it 'psychological terror', though that seems rather generous.  There are NO bugs in this film except the imaginary ones that exist in a tortured and schizophrenic mind.  Once that is understood, you will be in a position to better evaluate this movie on its merits, such as they are.  Ashley Judd is a luminously talented actress whose role choices tend to skew toward damaged, trashy characters, and I think these same 'victim' roles only serve to keep her talent underrated.  However, Judd mines some really dark places and is willing to go to hell, quite literally, for this material, and her committed, brave performance is one of the few things to recommend this movie.  Harry Connick appears in a brief supporting role as Judd's ex-con ex-husband and steals all of the few scenes he's in.  Judd's character, Aggie, is grieving the abduction loss of her young son, and though this thread is never satisfactorily explored, it does provide an explanation for the emotional vulnerability that leads to her descent into mutual paranoia.  It might have been a cheaper resolution to actually provide the audience with some real bugs, but at least that would have fulfilled our expectations.",2,Bugged,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,1750,"['rented', 'DVD', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'expectation', 'was', 'horror', 'genre', 'flick', 'involving', 'insects', 'lines', ""'Mimic"", ""'Seven"", 'said', 'as', 'much', 'box', 'was', 'directed', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'who', 'brought', ""'The"", 'Exorcist', 'Be', 'advised', 'kind', 'movie', 'what', 'want', 'watch', 'need', 'rent', 'buy', 'something', 'else', 'Based', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'place', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'small', 'grotty', 'motel', 'room', 'even', 'smaller', 'grottier', 'spaces', 'protaganists', 'minds', 'guess', 'could', 'call', ""'psychological"", 'terror', 'rather', 'generous', 'are', 'NO', 'bugs', 'film', 'imaginary', 'ones', 'exist', 'tortured', 'schizophrenic', 'mind', 'understood', 'will', 'be', 'position', 'better', 'evaluate', 'movie', 'merits', 'such', 'are', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'luminously', 'talented', 'actress', 'role', 'choices', 'tend', 'skew', 'damaged', 'trashy', 'characters', 'think', 'same', ""'victim"", 'roles', 'only', 'serve', 'keep', 'talent', 'underrated', 'However', 'Judd', 'really', 'dark', 'places', 'willing', 'go', 'hell', 'quite', 'literally', 'material', 'committed', 'brave', 'performance', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'brief', 'supporting', 'role', 'Judd', 'ex-con', 'ex-husband', 'steals', 'few', 'scenes', 'Judd', 'character', 'Aggie', 'grieving', 'abduction', 'loss', 'young', 'son', 'thread', 'never', 'satisfactorily', 'explored', 'provide', 'explanation', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'descent', 'mutual', 'paranoia', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cheaper', 'resolution', 'actually', 'provide', 'audience', 'real', 'bugs', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'fulfilled', 'expectations']",N/A

Bug is the film version of a stage play - basically a two character psychological drama about the lethal combination of paranoia and loneliness. Ashley Judd plays a lonely bartender, divorced from a violent convict, living in a flop-house motel in the middle of some white trash desert hell, she's surviving without companionship or prospects and abusing any recreational substance she can acquire. Through a concatenation of circumstances, she ends up hooking up with a shy, polite drifter. He quickly progresses from sleeping on her floor to joining her in bed, and in her hopeless desert he seems to be a movable oasis.Hmm, he's nice. But we got one slight problem....he's crazy.It's fundamentally just two people in a single hotel room getting crazier and crazier. Each moment of the film tries to make us squirm a bit more than the preceding one. The harrowing denouement resembles that of Requiem for a Dream, except that the catalyst is madness rather than heroin.In terms of commercial prospects ... well, as we say in Texas, this puppy was doomed from the get-go. It's the kind of movie where if it were done really poorly, people would hate it, and if it were done really well, people would hate it even more. Either way, it would provoke a lot of walk-outs and a lot of negative reactions. As it turns out, it is done quite well, but that just rachets up the ugliness of the viewing experience, and invites even higher levels of audience negativity. The script gradually increases the intensity of the characters' madness, which in turn amplifies the intensity of the audience's experience until the story explodes in a crescendo of destruction, as you might expect. (Not much room for a happy ending with this premise). Bug is effective enough at achieving its goal. Unfortunately, that goal basically consists of shocking us with deeper and deeper levels of dementia. I have to admit that the film did get under my skin, so to speak, and thoroughly creeped me out, so it's fair to say that the film is quite brilliant in its own way. If Edward Albee were a young man today, he might be exploring alienation with this sort of treatment rather than through ""The Zoo Story"". But brilliant or not, Bug represents a thoroughly depressing and unpleasant viewing experience, and that's not going to place this disc in the carts, and among the few who has purchased this disc, a high percentage will be pressing the eject button before the film ends.",3,[2.5]--I don't know......... this movie just might bug you a little,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2509,"['ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'rate', 'movie', '3', '2', 'Bug', 'film', 'version', 'stage', 'play', 'basically', 'two', 'character', 'psychological', 'drama', 'lethal', 'combination', 'paranoia', 'loneliness', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'lonely', 'bartender', 'divorced', 'violent', 'convict', 'living', 'flop-house', 'motel', 'middle', 'white', 'trash', 'desert', 'hell', 'surviving', 'companionship', 'prospects', 'abusing', 'recreational', 'substance', 'can', 'acquire', 'concatenation', 'circumstances', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'shy', 'polite', 'drifter', 'quickly', 'sleeping', 'floor', 'joining', 'bed', 'hopeless', 'desert', 'be', 'movable', 'oasis.Hmm', 'nice', 'got', 'one', 'slight', 'problem', '.he', 'crazy.It', 'fundamentally', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'single', 'hotel', 'room', 'getting', 'crazier', 'crazier', 'moment', 'film', 'make', 'squirm', 'bit', 'more', 'preceding', 'one', 'harrowing', 'denouement', 'resembles', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'catalyst', 'madness', 'rather', 'heroin.In', 'terms', 'commercial', 'prospects', 'well', 'say', 'Texas', 'puppy', 'was', 'doomed', 'get-go', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'were', 'done', 'really', 'poorly', 'people', 'would', 'hate', 'were', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'people', 'would', 'hate', 'even', 'more', 'way', 'would', 'provoke', 'lot', 'walk-outs', 'lot', 'negative', 'reactions', 'out', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'just', 'up', 'ugliness', 'viewing', 'experience', 'even', 'higher', 'levels', 'audience', 'negativity', 'script', 'gradually', 'intensity', 'characters', 'madness', 'turn', 'amplifies', 'intensity', 'audience', 'experience', 'story', 'crescendo', 'destruction', 'might', 'expect', 'Not', 'much', 'room', 'happy', 'ending', 'premise', 'Bug', 'effective', 'enough', 'achieving', 'goal', 'Unfortunately', 'goal', 'basically', 'shocking', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'levels', 'dementia', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'did', 'get', 'skin', 'so', 'speak', 'thoroughly', 'creeped', 'out', 'fair', 'say', 'film', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'own', 'way', 'Edward', 'Albee', 'were', 'young', 'man', 'today', 'might', 'be', 'exploring', 'alienation', 'sort', 'treatment', 'rather', 'Zoo', 'Story', 'brilliant', 'not', 'Bug', 'thoroughly', 'depressing', 'unpleasant', 'viewing', 'experience', 'not', 'going', 'place', 'disc', 'carts', 'few', 'who', 'purchased', 'disc', 'high', 'percentage', 'will', 'be', 'pressing', 'eject', 'button', 'film']",N/A

Remember the guy who wrote the legendary `The Exorcist'? Well, he wrote this! Peters monologue at the end of the film made me want to memorize it for myself and go around repeating it to my friends just to get a laugh. I suppose it wasn't meant to be funny but I've seen this movie so many times that by now it has become hilarious to me. Much of the dialogue is funny but you have to be paying attention.

I found myself actually perusing her other work on Netftix and buying her makeup line at Kohl's because I really feel like she's the real deal and what she represents is natural and honest, that was my interpretation, anyway. I even discovered she had a clothing line at a store in the southern United States.

From the beginning of the film it's obvious that her loneliness is so intense that even a disaster would be welcome--any disaster save the one she already has to deal with, her vicious ex boyfriend Jerry played by Harry Connick Jr.  He does a very good job playing Southern scum, so much so that there are times you want to take his character by the throat.  Still, though, in the diseased house of cards that this movie comprises he may be one of the only people in Agnes' life who could have prevented the horrific, unforgettable ending.Her gorgeous former lesbian lover R.C., played by Lynn Collins, departs way too quickly to make a difference.But to her credit, she is one who introduces Agnes to Peter, a really, really odd hitchhiker--maybe--who somehow ends up in her social circle.Michael Shannon here gives the best performance as an extremely paranoid schizophrenic that I have ever seen.  At first calm, somewhat rational, mixing his self-tormenting delusions with the truth, there's not one scene with him in it that does not reek of potential danger.  His peculiar fondness for insect theory (which ends up extending to his supposed experiences in the Gulf War, which ends up extending to government experiments on veternans, which ends up extending to Agnes' smoke detector, the motel room itself, and then ultimately Agnes' lost child)  actually seem very believable when you watch the actor recite his lines.What takes place in the last 30 minutes of this movie is an unrelenting, Dionysian rush of psychological horror so intense that it is actually hard to watch--Peter does some dental work on himself in order to block the invasion of the ""bugs"" and it is one of the most brutal scenes I have ever witnessed on film (probably because it takes place so abruptly.)William Friedkin shows once again that he is a hungry talent to be reckoned with; his films always remind us that we can never quite know what goes on, not with absolute certitude, and that some of the mostmomentous events leave us not with truth but with more questions.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 3]","Hold on to something, because BUG will get under your skin.I'm not really sure if I would classify this as a horror movie.  Maybe a dark love story.  A VERY VERY dark love story.  Playwright/screenwriter Tracy Letts seems to have an affinity for writing plays that feature the types of characters you'd find living in trailer parks and seedy motels. They are troubled folks, that's for sure, and often desperate.BUG is a tale of paranoia, yet coursing through its veins is a doomed love story. Agnes joins Peter in his paranoid delusions not because she shares his paranoia necessarily (at least not at first) but really because she desperately needs him as a lover and protector.  There are plenty of other reviews on this site to give you more specifics about plot and characters and theme, so I won't rehash it all here.The film is structured much like the play it is drawn from.  Having seen two of Tracy Letts' plays (many people in his plays end up naked, dead, or both) but not this one, I knew I was in for a wild ride.  The second half of this play/movie does not disappoint -- he ratchets up the intensity and adrenaline in each passing scene.  It actually got funnier as it got darker (typical Letts), thank goodness.  The ending was so explosive I can't possibly figure out how that could have been presented live on a stage.  I'm curious to know.I recommend this DVD to sophisticated fans of either horror or very dark comedy.  This is probably my second-favorite Tracy Letts work, resting just behind his play ""Killer Joe"" (not yet filmed).Trivia:  the actress who played the role of Agnes in the Off-Broadway production of ""Bug"" also played Lois the Prostitute in the first season of ""NYPD Blue"".

1088548,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000T5O48K,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[5, 6]","**No Spoilers**I read nothing but negative things before watching the new psychological thriller Bug--as a critic, it's hard to go see a film with neutrality and an open-mind. Bug works because of its exploration of paranoia, brainwashing and psychosis. Yes, it does start slow with long explanations and dialogue. But like small drops of rain before a thunderstorm, it becomes a visceral experience where madness--neither gore, nor CGI--is the true horror. Think of it as a Twilight Zone episode on steroids.Story:Agnes White (Ashley Judd) is a divorced woman who lives in a remote motel. She is lonely, depressed and always afraid of her ex Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.) who just got out of jail--he harasses her all the time. She also works as a waitress at a local bar, where she hangs out with her lesbian friend R.C (Lynn Collins). One night, they decide to hang out in her motel room and R.C brings a new friend called Peter (Michael Shannon). Agnes is attracted to him right away--his unusual personality and view of the world is something new to her. They become romantically involved--despite her ex--and share deep and painful secrets about themselves. She doesn't know that Peter is the new man who will change her views of the US government and the world.Review:The movie is based on play by Tracy Letts and directed by William Friedkin (The Exorcist). Bug is not about little roaches or a giant praying mantis. The movie has a deeper meaning than that. It deals with the human psyche, conspiracy theories and power to persuade people. This is where the horror comes from. The beginning might be slow for some fans of the genre--there are long conversations and some character development--but then the action begins once the paranoia penetrates their minds. The small motel room becomes a self-contain universe where madness reigns.Other good attributes of the film is the acting. Judd and Shannon did an excellent job, especially towards the end of the film, where they commit strange and terrible things to each other and others. Some scenes are very disturbing.Despite its excellent highlights, Bug has some silly moments. The love scene is probably one of the worst I have ever seen--it's not sexy at all and has this weird ""bug"" view. Some of the nudity is unnecessary. Also the logic is not the best thing here. I couldn't understand why Agnes was so easily convinced by Peter. Why did she follow him so blindly? Perhaps his personality and strange philosophy are the ingredients.The Verdict:Bug is one of the best horror movies we've reviewed this year. It has great moments of psychosis, paranoia and crude violence. It drags for the first act, but it picks up to an explosive finale that will please most of the fans of the genre.",4,A Visceral Experience where Madness is the True Horror,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2749,"['**No', 'Spoilers**I', 'read', 'nothing', 'negative', 'things', 'watching', 'new', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Bug', 'critic', 'hard', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'neutrality', 'open-mind', 'Bug', 'exploration', 'paranoia', 'brainwashing', 'psychosis', 'Yes', 'start', 'slow', 'long', 'explanations', 'dialogue', 'small', 'drops', 'rain', 'thunderstorm', 'visceral', 'experience', 'where', 'madness', 'gore', 'CGI', 'true', 'horror', 'Think', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'steroids.Story', 'Agnes', 'White', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'divorced', 'woman', 'who', 'remote', 'motel', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'always', 'afraid', 'ex', 'Jerry', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'time', 'also', 'waitress', 'local', 'bar', 'where', 'out', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'R.C', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'One', 'night', 'decide', 'hang', 'out', 'motel', 'room', 'R.C', 'new', 'friend', 'called', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Agnes', 'attracted', 'right', 'away', 'unusual', 'personality', 'view', 'world', 'something', 'new', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'ex', 'share', 'deep', 'painful', 'secrets', ""n't"", 'know', 'Peter', 'new', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'views', 'US', 'government', 'world.Review', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'Tracy', 'Letts', 'directed', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Exorcist', 'Bug', 'not', 'about', 'little', 'roaches', 'giant', 'praying', 'mantis', 'movie', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'human', 'psyche', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'power', 'persuade', 'people', 'where', 'horror', 'beginning', 'might', 'be', 'slow', 'fans', 'genre', 'are', 'long', 'conversations', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'action', 'once', 'paranoia', 'minds', 'small', 'motel', 'room', 'self-contain', 'universe', 'where', 'madness', 'reigns.Other', 'good', 'attributes', 'film', 'acting', 'Judd', 'Shannon', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'commit', 'strange', 'terrible', 'things', 'other', 'others', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing.Despite', 'excellent', 'highlights', 'Bug', 'silly', 'moments', 'love', 'scene', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'sexy', 'weird', 'bug', 'view', 'nudity', 'unnecessary', 'Also', 'logic', 'not', 'best', 'thing', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Agnes', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'convinced', 'Peter', 'Why', 'did', 'follow', 'so', 'blindly', 'Perhaps', 'personality', 'strange', 'philosophy', 'are', 'ingredients.The', 'Verdict', 'Bug', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'year', 'great', 'moments', 'psychosis', 'paranoia', 'crude', 'violence', 'first', 'act', 'up', 'explosive', 'finale', 'will', 'please', 'most', 'fans', 'genre']",N/A

It is extremely suspenseful, and recalls the best work of Kubrick, Lynch, and Aronofsky.  But after seeing it, I'm not sure that it's about insects at all.  Although it's often quite gross and horrific, it is not actually a horror movie at all, which will probably disappoint those expecting something more superficial.  It's one of those rare gems that be seen from several completely different perspectives, and create a lot of arguments within yourself and with others.  The plot and occurances are outrageous.  You're instant reaction is ""This could not possibly happen"".  In my opinion, ""Bug"" is totally about paranoid-schizophrenia and its ablity to spread from one person to another.  But watching ""Bug"" carefully on another level, one is given no evidence why the terrifying scenario could not be real.  Are Aggie and Peter nuts?  Or is there an evil government experiment going dreadfully wrong?  It's all up to you.As always, Ashley Judd is beyond amazing as an actress, as is Michael Shannon, who is alternately attractive and terrifyingly loony.

Generally the only methods a moviegoer has for choosing to see a specific movie is the trailer he or she watches on TV, in theaters, or over the internet. If for some reason a person doesn't see the trailer, the other marketing method used to get a moviegoer's attention would be the movie poster with a striking image and catchphrase that sums up the movie with one or two lines of copy. Regardless of what method ends up grabbing the individual's attention, the studio should feel some need to make sure that they have properly marketed the movie to the appropriate audience to maximize the number of tickets sold in order to turn a profit. For some reason though, studios sometimes have a misfire when it comes to their marketing strategy for certain movies. Whether the cause is a misleading trailer or catchphrases on the poster that lead the audience astray, it doesn't matter, if the movie doesn't deliver upon the expectations set forth by the marketing material, the studio will generally find themselves with a flop on their hands. One such misfire would be the most recent directorial effort by acclaimed director William Friedkin (""The Exorcist""), called ""Bug"" starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon.""Bug"" tells the story of a down-trodden, lonely waitress named Agnes, (Ashley Judd), who is barely scraping by as she attempts to hide from her ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) while living in a rundown motel room. One day things begin to possibly look up for this lonely woman as she is introduced to a gulf war veteran, Peter, (Michael Shannon) who is interested in starting a relationship with her; however, this veteran is not without his share of issues. He believes that his time spent fighting for the United States has left him the subject of top-secret testing using bugs implanted beneath his skin. As his paranoia grows exponentially, Peter begins to drag Agnes into his dangerous delusions until she becomes fully immersed in his disturbed version of reality.The marketing campaign for this film, meaning the previews and the movie posters, led me and many other moviegoers to believe that this would be a horror film in the vein of ""The Fly"" or something similar. The catchphrases used in conjunction with this movie were ones along the lines of, `the most disturbing horror film ever made' or `the scariest movie of the year', further convincing me that this would definitely be one scary movie to see and one that would most likely not disappoint. Plus, with the added bonus of solid actors filling the roles and an acclaimed director at the helm, how could this movie possibly go wrong. Well, somehow it found a way, and let me tell you I was extremely let down.""Bug"" is anything but a scary movie, there isn't a single moment in the entire film that could even be deemed as scary. No jump scenes, no blood or gore (a staple for today's modern horror films), or monsters/killers to fear, all this movie had was a lonely woman and a very strange man as the focus. If anything the movie was a little creepy at times, but even that wasn't too extreme. The movie was definitely not one I would consider a horror film, I would place it more in the category of psychological thriller, though using the word thriller is a bit of a stretch, the movie isn't all that thrilling and it's certainly not exciting. It strives to be one of those slow-boiling types of films where the audience senses the impending disaster that is approaching in the lives of the characters, but in the end the film doesn't deliver, and the audience is left disappointed and wishing for something more from the movie.Where the movie did succeed was in the actors' performances and straight-forward, nothing flashy, style of direction from William Friedkin. Friedkin made every scene feel very personable, as if you were in the room with the actors at all times, a very effective method in a movie like this, but not enough to save it. Every one of the three main actors delivered very strong, convincing performances that one would expect from such talent. But their capable acting ability was not enough to save this movie from becoming the flop it turned out to be.It is sad to think that a director like William Friedkin wasn't smart enough or powerful enough to steer this movie into the proper genre it belonged in; or at least assist in making the marketing applicable to the type of film it ended up as. Take it from me don't pay attention to the enticing previews or clever catchphrases for this movie; if you do you will be left severely disappointed by the results.""Bug"" is rated R for brief

I can completely understand why it failed during it's theaterical release...the marketing for it was WAY off. This is not a horror movie, its not suspense, its not action nor is it a love story...its all 4 put together in a very unsettling, twisted way.Agnes lives alone in an old motel in the middle of nowhere. She works in a lesbian bar and pretty much only has one friend...who is also a lesbian. Shes, of course, avoiding men because of her abusive husband who left a couple years earlier. Shes also very scarred by the kidnapping of her 6 year old son 10 years earlier.One night her friend comes by with a strange, kind of creepy guy named Peter on their way to a party. Peter seems really sweet and kind of slow at first and he and Agnes seem to find something in each other that no one else has.This friendship turns into love pretty quickly and Agnes is very desperate for something to love...little does she know that Peter has a secret that will eventually be the end of them both.I've read warnings in other reviews, if you are squeemish with bugs, don't worry...trust me. Not to give anything away, but...just trust me.As I said before, this is not a horror movie as it was marketed, its more of a character study.

Ashley Judd is also quite convincing as the on-the-run waitress who has been broken one too many times by her abusive boyfriend and so takes solace in Shannon's ex-soldier character, despite his mysterious behavior. It is difficult to explain the plot without betraying the suspense or dropping a spoiler or two, so I will refrain from saying much more. Be warned however--this is not conventional horror. If indeed there are creatures lurking here, they will take unfamiliar forms. You might not see them coming, and you shouldn't.

However... there are a number of things I did not like about this film.First, the billing. The previews led you to believe this is a horror film. I recall quick scenes where they showed bugs crawling just under the skin, which didn't happen in the movie. Major points off for being misleading.Second... this is not a thriller by any stretch of the imagination. This is a study in two parts.First part being how easily some people can succumb to the influence of others, especially if they are emotionally fragile for whatever reason (lonely, drug addicted, etc.). Second part being how much in need they are of attention.... whether it's good or bad attention, it's still attention. So more major points off for being misleading in script also.What I will say is that the acting was excellent. Each character, sans the doctor, was believable. The doctor's character was too too out there. What would have happened in real life is not what happened in this movie. Police would have been called and involuntary warrants for admission to a psychiatric place would have been issued, especially after viewing how the interior of the home had been altered.But... I firmly believe they went for some gore so they could use it for misleading billing. Bad, bad move.This movie would have done better as a pure study in how insanity/paranoia can be transmitted and the decline that follows.It's a shame really. The pretense is strong. Put a lonely, emotionally unstable woman together with a mentally sick man and watch what happens. And it does happen.The points I took off were for misleading billing in script and in trailers. Incongruent story line, especially with the doctor and a misleading plot. Nowhere in this film do the police come into play.What was good, but wasted, was the acting by all involved, again, sans the doctor. He was there for the gore factor.All in all, I would have to say, don't waste your time. There's much better films about the decline into insanity.

1088556,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000T5O48K,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[27, 36]","Having caught ""Bug"" during its short theatrical run, I found it one of the strangest curiosities to have come from Hollywood in quite some time.  While you may loathe its lunacy or love its originality, there is no question the film was poorly handled by the studios.  Marketed as a horror film (""by the director of `The Exorcist'""), the advertising campaign completely misrepresented the film.  In fact, it continues to do so--just look at the DVD artwork.  At best, you could call ""Bug"" a psychological horror movie--but it's really a studied descent into madness.  The film was widely distributed to a mass audience instead of being cultivated on the arthouse circuit, which is another unusual choice for a film of this type.  So when average filmgoers went to ""Bug"" expecting a scary date movie, they got something decidedly more unpleasant (but arguably more interesting).So let's be honest--you will either love and respect ""Bug"" or you will absolutely hate it.  The film really doesn't have a middle ground.  But, to me, that's part of its appeal.  I like films to take chances--and, for all its faults, ""Bug"" is genuinely unsettling.  I found myself profoundly disturbed and thinking about this film for days after I'd seen it.  It elicited, from me, some of the same reactions and emotions that I had upon the initial viewing of David Cronenberg's masterpiece ""Dead Ringers.""  While I won't contend that ""Bug"" is in the same league as that film, just the comparison is a huge honor in my book.The story of ""Bug"" revolves around Ashley Judd as a small town waitress living in a desolate motel.  Remote, lonely, and contending with an abusive relationship past--Judd is an interesting blend of fragility and bravado.  When a stranger, played by Michael Shannon, enters the picture, the two form an oddly codependent existence.  At first, this unorthodox couple seems to gain strength from one another--but as Shannon's true psychosis is revealed, things head south.  The motel room becomes a cocoon against the outside world and reality starts to unravel.  We become more and more disconnected from what is real and what is delusional.  And as the film progresses, the madness accelerates in an almost operatic way.The film makes bold choices and not everything works--but with conventional fare always taking the ""safe"" route, I'm not going to fault ""Bug"" for its outrageousness.  Shannon is terrific and Judd commands the screen.  They delve so deeply into these twisted personalities, it's hard not to be awed by their commitment.  I credit Judd--she's a great actress--I like to see her take chances and make interesting choices.If you want a scary movie, don't buy ""Bug.""  It's that simple.  If you want to try something more adventurous, this might be for you.  ""Bug"" got under my skin.  It's ambitious, complicated, messy, overwrought, and intriguing in every way.  If that sounds like a compliment (which I meant it as), then give the film a look.

Meanwhile, her lesbian co-worker introduces her to a lonely, shy drifter.The drifter is a soldier, who've just returned from the war.  Eventually, you'll start to see that this guy is a few marbles short.  He believes that he is part of some classified warfare experient and that he's under the constant watch of the government.  He believes that there are microscopic bugs (critters) that function as...well...bugs (spy devices).Agnes feels obligated to help out this drifter with his problem.

I don't even think she graduated grade school with her mental capacity. The things she believed with no proof. Are there actually people that stupid? That thought kinda scares me.The plot was unique. But both Agnes and Peter were so awkward in the beginning it was almost painful to watch them interact. After the awkward phase however their acting became outstanding. It was just hard for me to grasp that two people could both go completely insane in such a short amount of time. The characters themselves even comment on how little they know each other, yet are in love with each other. I found that hard to believe, but maybe I'm just a skeptic when it comes to matters of the heart.You'd think a unique plot, and great acting would equal a great movie.

And while that movie blatantly rocked your senses his newest film ""Bug"" does so in much more subtle ways.The movie revolves around Agnes White (Ashley Judge), a woman living in a convenience motel in a nowhere town in Oklahoma. Her life consists of working in a lesbian bar and dreading the calls from her ex husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.), a man who abused her that who she fears and who has recently been paroled.One night a friend of Agnes introduces her to Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) and things are never the same. Peter is a quiet, odd sort who finds refuge in Agnes' room. Eventually he finds it in her arms as well. The two misfits find themselves attracted and things could turn out fine with the exception of one fact: bugs.Peter begins to find them everywhere, microscopic bugs that he claims the government inserted into him as a guinea pig. Is this man insane or a part of some major conspiracy?From there we are drawn into a world where two people find themselves ruled by the concept of these ""bugs"". And as a battered woman who thinks she has found love begins to become convinced that what he says is true, Agnes is attacked by the same bugs. Until the last scene we never know for sure they exist or not.The movie offers a number of disturbing scenes, one of which is graphically violent. But perhaps more disturbing is the sense of paranoia and the possibility of Agnes' being brainwashed as opposed to there actually being bugs. Her willingness to believe becomes a centerpiece for the film.While the movie may not be for everyone nor invite multiple viewings, it does offer some great performances from the entire cast and a compelling story that makes you want to watch till the finish.

Scheurich ""The Professor""","[1, 9]","Although great performances by Ashley Judd, Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Shannon the promotional hype is very misleading as they attempt to fool  the potential viewers into thinking this is a horror film and there are bugs which attack people. Produced by William Friedkin and produced by Kimberly C. Anderson the trickery doesn't end there, this off Broadway screen play written by Tracy Letts is reminiscent of extremist who have gone out of their way to ridicule conspiracy theorist's victims. Trying to make the case that conspiracy theorists are simply paranoid schizophrenics  Letts goes overboard and the entire motel room is coated with tinfoil and instead of the tinfoil hats being employed to protect the victim who believes it may help to block them from microwaves they believe are emitted by government scientist electronic instruments conducting mind control experiments. The ridicule continues as the microwaves are emitted by  aphids (a harmless plant pest) who are attacking the characters. The movie becomes even more ridiculous when in the end the writer attempts to mix in actual documented government experiments (uncovered by the U.S. Church Senate  committee that were conducted on innocent civilians during the second half of the 20th century) and other documents released under the freedom of information Act with fantasy conspiracy theories one might expect from mental patients with real brain disorders. To top off this debunking theme the mentaly deranged charcters  then commit suicide (by setting themselves on fire  no less) in order to add icing to the cake. I would have to conclude that Bug is simply another attempt to cover up the real atrocities committed by those employed by the government to conduct experiments on unknowing civilians and innocent patients who went to doctors for mild problems such as depression and were then used as Guinea pigs. One has to wonder what all these doctors, psychiatrists and scientist who agreed to conduct these experiments on patients are now doing with their lives. Evidently they are out looking for screen writers, directors and producers who  will agree to produce movies  which will get them off the hook by convincing the public that the experiments they conducted never happened.

I would say it is similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion where we experience what the person is seeing and going through.  Ashley Judd gives her most vulnerable and powerful performance to date as Agnes White, a down on her luck bar waitress living in a Oklahoma Motel located off a highway.  She is tormented by phone calls from her abusive ex husband Jerry who just got paroled played effectively by Harry Connick Jr. Connick Jr plays Jerry as both witty, charismatic, and almost likable and also an intimidating abusive bully.  So, you can see where Judd's character would fall for him and also why she would hate and be afraid of him.One night after work a friend and co worker stops by to visit her and party a bit, she brings a guy she met recently by the name of Peter Evans played by Michael Shannon and yet again another great performance.  Peter takes a friendly liking to Judd's character and she to him, they are both very lonely and in need of companionship and are able to become very open and close in a short period of time.  Peter is an ex military vet that apparently went a.w.o.l because of experiments being done to him using his body as a guinea pig and infecting him with a contagion.  Peter believes they have infected him with some sort of bug and after an intimate night together between him and Judd they find bugs in the bed and so begins Peter's downward spiral into this horrific delusion of madness as he takes her with him.I found this to be a unique, interesting, and different story of madness with great performances all around.",4,The director of The Exorcist William Friedkin in top form.

What are they getting out of it?The plot holes are numerous - what happens to some of the supporting characters who should be bigger players in this? Things come out of nowhere, there's no real development of characters or concepts. It's a one-trick, one-act piece of mud that collapses under it's own absurdity.I guess the core concept of this piece is the story of people who are co-dependent in the most perverse way possible. There's a much better handling of the idea in the fabulous, underrated movie ""Night Porter"" with Charlotte Rampling and Dirk Bogarde. In the ending sequence of bug, where the two main characters have locked themselves away and are spiraling a self-destructive path, I was really reminded of how fantastic the Night Porter handled it.On stage, Bug might have been more interesting, but I probably would have laughed at the absurdity in the hushed confines of the theatre, like I did watching the movie.

Ashley Judd stars as a white trash waitress with a shattered past who is dreading the return of her ex-con husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and holds up in a cheap motel.  Soon enough, she meets a scarred Gulf War vet (Michael Shannon), and afterwards, he discovers a bug in her bed.  What happens next is a bizarre and often compelling mind trip that turns quite bloody as the ever growing paranoia escalates into territory you'll never see coming.  Without giving too much away, Bug is a twisting examination of mental illness that is made only better by the performances from Judd and Shannon.  Shannon (reprising his stage role) in particular is spectacular, and should become more well known thanks to his performance here, but alas, Bug has gotten a bad rep thanks to some sloppy marketing.  It's no secret that Bug isn't what you may think it is (I wouldn't classify this film as horror really) and that it's definitely not for all tastes, but make no mistake that Bug leaves a lasting impression.

Granted, perhaps this work is meant for the niche segment ofAJ  fans, while the actress reprises her type-cast role as a young woman  havingbehavioral issues, put againt impressive challenges, risks and obstacles, coping with afragile emotional makeup.The story is unpredictable, as AJ  is slowly, little by little, placed into the psychologicalworld of an acquaintance made at the local bar,  and goes through a transformation, not unlikewhat is seen with the Stockholm Syndrome, unable to transcend the new circumstances.The filming is flawless, the camera work is up close and simple.  The  widescreen  enhancesthe quality of the presentation, while the lack of music perhaps does the opposite, or is absent tonot  constitute a distraction.The committment of AJ into the picture is impressive,  with alternating moments of joyand dispair, the evident  misery of poverty, the confusion  of a solitude arising from theseparation from her companion and loss of her child.As with her earlier films, BUG not only has the compulsory nude moment of the actress, but several ones, inthe washroom,  from a side profile and back profile. Indubitably, BUG is obviously intended as a vehicle forvoyeurism, on the one hand to profit from the  personal charisma of the actress, while on the other hand, to stay faithful to the story's  character that is shown  at home, having drinking  and substance abuse habits, in between a lack of personal goals.Harry Connick plays the ex-boyfriend with a flawed character, to the extent that AJ broke off their earlier relationship, despite some relatively  positive qualities. Even after a return to freedom from a prison, his past mistakes and misconduct are impossible to erase from her mind.Taking up with Michael Shannon, (who has a  Christopher Walken style) some comical moments occur, such as ""I'm not much good in the sack!"" or  ""I haven't been with a woman for a long time ...""  AJ  further proceeds to underline  the hedonistic, libertarian  aspects of the character.Thus,  the sensual aspects  are intertwined with madhouse, reminiscent of  PASSION OF DARKLY NOON.The finale could also have been edited shorter, and avoided bringing into the fold controversial elements, Jim Jones and the Koolaid, which may offend those reading the alternative media.BUG is well worth a look.",4,Remarkable!

Peter claims he is on the run from the Army, who did experiments on him. He eventually convinces Agnes that the Army implanted aphids into him, the egg sacs hidden under fillings in his teeth, which have begun to hatch through his skin after sleeping with Agnes.

Ashley Judd delivers an incredible and powerful performance as a lonely and isolated woman who takes in a rather meek and quiet drifter(Michael Shannon), and let's him stay with her in the small motel room she is living in. As the story begins to take root, a more forceful and determined personality begins to emerge in Shannon's character. He begins to notice little bites that she cannot see at first. She soon starts seeing the bites her self. We as the audience really don't know if these bites are real or imagined. From there on the two begin a journey into the darkest corridors of madness as they take measures to fight what they feel are legions of tiny, nearly microscopic bugs that are in their blood streams, Possibly injected into Shannon's character via military experiments conducted on him years earlier, then passed onto Judd's character. As the character structure builds so does the depth of acting. The last 15 minutes of this film delivers some of the the most incredible acting I have ever seen in a film of this type. Both Judd and Shannon are simply so deeply into their characters that both performances deserved Oscar nominations. Judd's performance through out the film is simply astonishing, and I think it may just be her best performance thus far. The film is really not all that scary, nor is it really a horror film. It does have some real originality, and William Friedkin has done a masterful job here at making the movie interesting even if it does take place almost completely in a single small set.

I agree with the 'Exorcist' director on the last two. Ashley Judd is extremely sexy and things do turn savagely violent but I can't claim to have laughed much during the film. Agnes (Judd) is a woman living alone in a run down motel. Haunted by the disappearance of her only child six years ago she has become a recluse whose only solace is the bottle. Working at a gay bar her only friend is a co worker named R.C. (Lynn Collins). One night R.C. introduces Agnes to a shy man named Peter (Michael Shannon). Agnes is nervous around him since he is so polite and quiet. Peter has to assure her that he's not an axe murderer or anything. Coupled by her loneliness and fear of her ex husband Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.) Agnes lets Peter move in and the two start sleeping together. When Goss comes to call on her he's none too happy to discover Peter living there. He does everything he can to get him to leave. A meddlesome husband is the least of the new couple's problems when Agnes learns that Peter has just as much baggage as she does. One night after sex he becomes convinced that bed bugs are biting at him. When Agnes doesn't see them Peter gives her a tutorial on all the different kinds of bugs from termites to aphids. Pretty soon Agnes is a believer and her and Peter start cutting at themselves in the hopes of carving the bugs they believe to be implanted in them by the government out of their bodies. Things get very bloody from here on out and the film is often difficult to watch. When a shadowy doctor shows up at the motel demanding to bring Peter in things get even more violent and shocking. The film is the best kind of horror film: one that actually makes you think by preying on your own fears about everyday things. Judd and Shannon are fearless in their performances. This is raw stuff to watch but it's always riveting. The film was based on a play and the stage origins are felt since, with the exception of a scene in the bar and one flashback, everything happens in or around the motel. It's not easy to watch, and by the end of the film the claustrophobia becomes unbearable, but it's a well made film by very talented people at the top of their game.",3,"""I Am The Queen Mother Bug""",1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,2292,"['hear', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'describe', 'latest', 'film', 'comedy', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'savagely', 'violent', 'agree', ""'Exorcist"", 'director', 'last', 'two', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'things', 'do', 'turn', 'savagely', 'violent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'have', 'laughed', 'much', 'film', 'Agnes', 'Judd', 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'run', 'down', 'motel', 'Haunted', 'disappearance', 'only', 'child', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'become', 'recluse', 'only', 'solace', 'bottle', 'Working', 'gay', 'bar', 'only', 'friend', 'co', 'worker', 'named', 'R.C', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'One', 'night', 'R.C', 'introduces', 'Agnes', 'shy', 'man', 'named', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Agnes', 'nervous', 'so', 'polite', 'quiet', 'Peter', 'assure', 'not', 'axe', 'murderer', 'anything', 'Coupled', 'loneliness', 'fear', 'ex', 'husband', 'Goss', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Agnes', 'Peter', 'move', 'two', 'start', 'sleeping', 'together', 'When', 'Goss', 'call', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'discover', 'Peter', 'living', 'there', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'leave', 'meddlesome', 'husband', 'least', 'new', 'couple', 'problems', 'when', 'Agnes', 'Peter', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'baggage', 'One', 'night', 'sex', 'convinced', 'bed', 'bugs', 'are', 'biting', 'When', 'Agnes', ""n't"", 'see', 'Peter', 'tutorial', 'different', 'kinds', 'bugs', 'termites', 'aphids', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Agnes', 'believer', 'Peter', 'start', 'cutting', 'hopes', 'carving', 'bugs', 'believe', 'be', 'implanted', 'government', 'bodies', 'Things', 'get', 'very', 'bloody', 'here', 'film', 'often', 'difficult', 'watch', 'When', 'shadowy', 'doctor', 'up', 'motel', 'demanding', 'bring', 'Peter', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'violent', 'shocking', 'film', 'best', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'actually', 'think', 'preying', 'own', 'fears', 'everyday', 'things', 'Judd', 'Shannon', 'are', 'fearless', 'performances', 'raw', 'stuff', 'watch', 'always', 'riveting', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'stage', 'origins', 'are', 'felt', 'exception', 'scene', 'bar', 'one', 'flashback', 'everything', 'happens', 'motel', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'end', 'film', 'claustrophobia', 'unbearable', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'top', 'game']",N/A

Right there, the movie is worth seeing.BUT...I must admit the previews for the movie were all pretty misleading.  They make you think you'll be seeing a grimy little horror story, dealing with a bug infestation of some sort.  THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE...at least not in the traditional sense.It is a story about one lonely woman's descent into utter madness...led there by a man who is already quite insane himself.  It is a psychological horror story of the first-order...but it does not deal at all with anything supernatural, sci-fi, alien invasion, killer viruses, etc. etc.  If that's what you're expecting...then you'll be a one-star reviewer just like half the reviews on this site.The movie is based on a stage play, and it is talky.  Most of it takes place in Judd's cheap little hotel room that she has been living in for months or years.  This makes the movie feel a little ""stage bound"" but it also helps make Judd's world seem sad, lonely and pathetic.  Hopeless, even.  She has escaped a bad marriage...but one day, her ex-con ex-husband comes ""home"" and assumes he will just take up residence in her life again.  The hubby (Harry Connick Jr....devoid of any charm) also is clearly ready to start up his abusive ways again.We learn that this couple has also experienced a major personal tragedy...which explains the utter despair that has clearly helped hold Judd back from moving on with her life.Suddenly, into her life comes a strange, and strangely compelling, young man (Shannon) who despite his oddity and somewhat anti-social behavior, takes a shine to Judd and also helps to fend off the unwanted husband.  The two embark on a tentative affair that grows into a clingy relationship that grows into a madness that both share...one that grows ever larger because the two feed off and encourage each other.I don't want to say much about the nature of the madness...but suffice it to say that what the movie shows is that Judd is in a perfect psychological state to turn herself over completely to the delusions of another...to forget her real life and absorb the probably imaginary life of a person who actually has brought her some tiny measure of safety, comfort and intimacy.The acting feels a little ""stagey"" at times...almost over the top.  In fact, Shannon played his role on stage, and I suspect had a hard time turning his intensity down a notch.  So, Judd simply stepped up to the plate and matched his intensity.  She is tough, yet extremely vulnerable.  Closed off yet willing to give her heart and soul in exchange for very little.  Also, Judd brings pretty much no ego to the film...she looks haggard.  True, she is one of the more natural beauties in film (and yes, she even does a nude scene)...but her allure is more carnal, more base, more driven by need.The ending of the movie is quite shocking, a bit sad, and in many ways disappointing.  It happens abruptly, and when we realize that it's over, we might want to throw something at the TV.  But part of that stems from the fact that while these characters are far removed from anyone we know (hopefully!)...they have been built carefully and convincingly...and we eagerly hope for a different fate for them.This is not a film for everyone.  It isn't exactly an ""art film"" and it isn't a ""genre film.""  I think it can suit a viewer whose tastes are wide ranging and who appreciates good performances, even in a script that is a bit stagey and a bit contrived.  It has something to say about the power of loneliness to make us do unattractive things.  It is NOT designed to scare you, creep you out or even make you feel you've had a good time.  It wants to rattle you a bit...and it succeeds.  It is just hugely unfortunate that the films marketing was so misleading.",4,Powerful acting...but NOT a horror film.

1088591,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000T5O48K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 5]","Bug (William Friedkin, 2006)William Friedkin has, rather quietly since the early eighties, crafted himself a career as one of American film's finest auteurs. Yeah, there have been some horrible, horrible missteps along the way (anyone remember Jade?), but a lot of movies that were castigated in the media seemed to me to be a whole lot better than people were making them out to be (anyone remember Rules of Engagement or the remake of 12 Angry Men?) Whatever the reason, a guy who pretty much ruled the roost in the seventies has sunk into such obscurity that his latest film, Bug, played on only 1,661 screens at the peak of its theatrical exposure. (Contrast this to the 4,362 screens on which Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End played the same weekend.) It is, at least, some consolation that long after Gore Verbinski's career is a footnote at best in film almanacs, William Friedkin's greatest films will still be available on holodisc or whatever they watch movies on that far in the future. Bug, in my opinion, will be one of them, on a par with The Exoricst and The French Connection.It shares a lot with those two movies, actually, under its surface. On top, they couldn't be more different; Bug is a somewhat ribald, if creepy, tale about Agnes (Ashley Judd), a waitress whose friend sets her up with Peter (Michael Shannon, who cut his indie teeth in The Woodman and Deadbirds, among others), a drifter who seems like a very welcome change from Agnes' abusive ex-husband Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), who's just gotten out of prison and is sure to be sniffing around soon. Agnes and Peter, both lost souls in the desolate armpit of an uncaring world, find themselves drawn to one another, but things get complicated with the arrival of minuscule, carnivorous, and very hungry bugs.I spent the first half of this movie wondering what all the fuss was about. Then the three-quarters of what was left. I mean, I enjoyed it well enough; Harry Connick Jr. showed us in Copycat that he makes a mean, twisted bad guy, and he does it here just as well, while Shannon and Judd are their usual excellent selves. Friedkin's direction is spot-on, and I get the feeling that the pace, which often feels as if it's far too slow, is absolutely deliberate. For whatever the trailers may be telling you, Bug is not a horror movie. Bug is about tension, paranoia, drama. It will take you a while to realize what Friedkin and scriptwriter Tracy Letts (adapted from his own play) are doing with this; the movie explodes, the evil machinations of the people behind the scenes blindside you, and you really have no recourse but to say ""holy crap."" Friedkin and Letts have pulled a fast one on us, and the sucker-punch at the end is just fantastic.None of this should be new to Friedkin fans. The Exorcist is two hours of buildup with a rather stock mystery plot before we get to see any classic cinema. The French Connection is notorious for the slowness of its first half. What do you think would attract a director like Friedkin to a remake of 12 Angry Men? This is a guy who likes to spend a whole lot of time setting things up in precise ways so that he can come barrelling out of nowhere with a freight train when you're least expecting it. And Bug is Friedkin's strongest showing in this arena in over three decades; it may, in fact, even be better structured than The Exorcist.

1088594,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000T5O48K,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 7]","**1/2*SPOILERS*You can go about halfway with ""Bug,"" William Friedkin's film version of the Tracy Letts play that had its premiere in London, then made its way across the Atlantic to New York, Chicago and Washington D.C.  It is safe to say that the source material has yielded one of the oddest American movies to come our way in quite some time.  It is certainly an example of a dual-genre gear-grinder - for what starts out as an intriguing domestic drama suddenly turns into a whacked-out paranoid thriller.  The whiplash is fairly intense at times, but the quality of the performances compensates for some, though certainly not all, of the discomfort that results.The wonderful Ashley Judd plays Agnes White, a divorced cocktail waitress who lives by herself in a rundown motel stuck out in the middle of the windswept desert.  On the very same night in which she invites Peter (Michael Shannon), a strange young drifter, to stay over at her place, her recently paroled, abusive ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) also shows up, determined to start over with her, even if that means using strong-armed tactics to do so.  Peter, a war vet, is convinced that he has been the victim of some nefarious medical experiments at the hands of the U.S. government, experiments that involve injecting some type of bug into his bloodstream.  Soon, Agnes is sharing Peter's paranoid delusions...if they really are delusions, that is.There's no getting around the fact that this is one majorly schizophrenic film.  There are those who will be pulled in by the human drama of the first half but repelled by the psycho-thriller aspects that develop later on - just as there will be those who will find the earlier sections dull and talky but be intrigued by the sci-fi aspects of the second half (though I certainly don't want to discount those who'll love or hate both halves with equal fervor).  Frankly, I find myself mainly in the first camp, enjoying the movie up to the point where Peter's bug obsession completely takes over and the descent into madness begins.  In the early stages, the relationships among the various characters are complex and involving, with excellent performances from Judd, Shannon, Connick and Lynn Collins as Agnes' lesbian co-worker and friend adding to our interest.  The subtle hints of potential mental disturbance and violence (on the part of both men in her life) keep us on our guard and generate a genuine concern for Agnes' safety and well-being (emotional as well as physical).  Indeed, the quality of vulnerability that Judd brings to the role makes Agnes a very compelling character indeed.  The scenes between Judd and Shannon are particularly well-played and effective.Then the Big Moment arrives and the whole thing degenerates almost instantaneously into a ham-handed exercise in silliness, pretentiousness and pseudo-profundity.  Indeed, by the time the two lovers have plastered themselves into a room-sized tinfoil cocoon, you`ll probably be more than ready to check out of this particular motel for good.  It`s true that ""Bug"" is not quite like anything you've ever seen before, but I'm not sure that that, in and of itself, qualifies as much of a recommendation.",2,goes off the rails after a promising first half,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,3199,"['**1/2*SPOILERS*You', 'can', 'go', 'halfway', 'Bug', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'film', 'version', 'Tracy', 'Letts', 'play', 'had', 'premiere', 'London', 'then', 'made', 'way', 'Atlantic', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'safe', 'say', 'source', 'material', 'yielded', 'one', 'oddest', 'American', 'movies', 'come', 'way', 'quite', 'time', 'certainly', 'example', 'dual-genre', 'gear-grinder', 'what', 'out', 'intriguing', 'domestic', 'drama', 'suddenly', 'whacked-out', 'paranoid', 'thriller', 'whiplash', 'fairly', 'intense', 'times', 'quality', 'performances', 'compensates', 'certainly', 'not', 'discomfort', 'wonderful', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Agnes', 'White', 'divorced', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'who', 'rundown', 'motel', 'stuck', 'out', 'middle', 'windswept', 'desert', 'very', 'same', 'night', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'strange', 'young', 'drifter', 'stay', 'place', 'recently', 'paroled', 'abusive', 'ex-husband', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'also', 'up', 'determined', 'start', 'even', 'using', 'strong-armed', 'tactics', 'do', 'so', 'Peter', 'war', 'vet', 'convinced', 'been', 'victim', 'nefarious', 'medical', 'experiments', 'hands', 'U.S.', 'government', 'experiments', 'involve', 'injecting', 'type', 'bug', 'bloodstream', 'Soon', 'Agnes', 'sharing', 'Peter', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'really', 'are', 'delusions', 'getting', 'fact', 'one', 'majorly', 'schizophrenic', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'pulled', 'human', 'drama', 'first', 'half', 'repelled', 'psycho-thriller', 'aspects', 'develop', 'later', 'just', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'earlier', 'sections', 'dull', 'talky', 'be', 'intrigued', 'sci-fi', 'aspects', 'second', 'half', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'discount', 'who', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate', 'halves', 'equal', 'fervor', 'Frankly', 'find', 'mainly', 'first', 'camp', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'Peter', 'bug', 'obsession', 'completely', 'descent', 'madness', 'begins', 'early', 'stages', 'relationships', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'involving', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Judd', 'Shannon', 'Connick', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Agnes', 'lesbian', 'co-worker', 'friend', 'adding', 'interest', 'subtle', 'hints', 'potential', 'mental', 'disturbance', 'violence', 'part', 'men', 'life', 'keep', 'guard', 'generate', 'genuine', 'concern', 'Agnes', 'safety', 'well-being', 'emotional', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'Indeed', 'quality', 'vulnerability', 'Judd', 'role', 'Agnes', 'very', 'compelling', 'character', 'indeed', 'scenes', 'Judd', 'Shannon', 'are', 'particularly', 'well-played', 'Big', 'Moment', 'whole', 'thing', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'ham-handed', 'exercise', 'silliness', 'pretentiousness', 'pseudo-profundity', 'Indeed', 'time', 'two', 'lovers', 'have', 'plastered', 'room-sized', 'tinfoil', 'cocoon', 'll', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'ready', 'check', 'particular', 'motel', 'good', 's', 'true', 'Bug', 'not', 'quite', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'much', 'recommendation']",N/A

I just grabbed it thinking it might be a sci-fi thriller to pass a few hours with. It is labeled as a ""thriller,"" - but it's not sci-fi, and actually, it's not a ""thriller"" either. That label is a misnomer. This is an intense psychological drama about obsessive-compulsive disorder.It's an unflinching portrayal of a couple's descent into madness. Or is it? You may not be absolutely certain, because there are a few suggestions along the way that the couple's paranoia - their conviction that bugs have been implanted in them, that Government agents are experimenting on them - may not be total hallucination. But assuming the couple is suffering from genuine delusions, their imaginings spiral them down into shocking, brutal alienation.Their relationship seems to start innocently enough. The drifter Ashley Judd meets seems to be the polar opposite of the abusive husband she's been trying to get out of her life. This new man is strangely gentle and literate. But then he starts to see tiny bugs infesting the dingy motel room where they now live together. And soon she sees the bugs too.Some psychologists such as Erich Fromm have written about how most of us end up acceding to the particular insanity of our respective societies as the inevitable price of being accepted as a group member. Here Ashley Judd is all too ready to buy into her new boyfriend's delusions because she has been lonely and his companionship is a lifeline. But what a price she pays.Director William Friedkin' tends to be a little droning and pretentious in his commentary. He laces his remarks with references to Proust's stream of consciousness, and to Cleckley's ideas about ""the mask of sanity"" that we all wear. He uses neologisms he doesn't seem to be aware aren't legitimate words. For example, he several times refers to the boyfriend's imaginings as being ""insiduous,"" perhaps a clutch after some high-flown meaning half-way between ""insidious"" and ""assiduous."" Still, most of his comments are intelligent. He points out the many layers of meaning that the title ""Bug"" has here - from a sense of the literal insects the couple believes are bedeviling them - to a sense of being ""bugged,"" spied on, kept under surveillance - to a sense of being pervasively infected.Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick act out all these levels of meaning brilliantly. Obsessive-compulsive disorder of this magnitude is rarely tackled on film because such inner turmoil is difficult to make cinematic.

O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","One of the most recent entries in the increasingly potent drama/horror hybrid field, ""Bug"" finds Ashley Judd playing a depressed and occasional drug-dabbling woman living in a small motel room close to the little town where she works serving drinks at a loud, boisterous bar.  With a troubled past that includes an abusive husband and a long-vanished child, she becomes deeply afriad when she starts getting annoymous phone calls shortly after her ex is released from prison.  When a fellow barmaid brings a new male friend over to Agnes (Judd's character)'s place for the evening, he (Michael Shannon) and Judd form a connection and later begin to grow closer.  It seems at first that the two may help one another get over their mutual loneliness, but he's got a very secretive nature, and, possibly, some very deep secrets to hide.Peter (Shannon's character) is either insane or carrying some very nasty secrets within himself.  And then the bugs start appearing, small in number, at first...Grim, even dreary at times (but proving itself one of the very few movies that can carry off extended periods of such bleakness and emotional desolation), full of horrors like domestic violence, emotional isolation and post-traumatic stresses, and possibly much weirder horrors as well; ""Bug"" also has a strange beauty to it.  That, and virtuoso performances, help prevent the movie from becoming overly depressing and creates a great film for both horror fans and drama fans.

1088602,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000T5O48K,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[27, 31]","William Friedkin returns with a vengeance in this highly disturbing tale of mental illness, self-mutilation, depravity, and isolation.The story is deceptively simple in that Ashley Judd, who still looks beautiful no matter how sickly she's made up, plays an isolated, abused and tortured woman who has a history for making awful decisions and eventually makes one too many when she hooks up with a paranoid stranger who is at first shy, tender, and compassionate, but quickly becomes as domineering as Judd's criminal ex-husband who is very well played by Harry Connick, Jr. As I said, this is a deceptively simple tale, because nothing is as it seems in this incredibly violent and disturbing film.Things very quickly spiral out of control with both Judd's character and the mysterious stranger believing that the government has arranged their relationship in order to produce some super bugs.  This, ironically, appeals to Judd's character who has been seeking, in her own way, some relevance in a world that has ignored her pain.  It oddly gives her a sense of importance and a reason to hate those around her who have either pointed a judgmental finger at her for literally losing her son (which could happen to anyone) or have done little to help her out of her miserable life (even though she created some of her own misery).Judd's character is both an in-depth, evolving character and a stereotype of a crack-smoking waitress with no ambition in life other than to wallow in self-pity, hang with the wrong crowd and then wonder why her life is so screwed up.  This is a tragically multi-layered character and performance.  Judd deserves an Oscar nomination as she portrays both a pathetic lost soul who has done little to improve her life and someone we feel great compassion for regardless of her shortcomings.  She has created a character that we want to hit with a 2 x 4 in the head one moment, and cradle in our arms and comfort the next.  In a year where many have complained of few good women roles, I can't help but wonder why this performance has gone relatively unnoticed.Shannon, as the mentally ill stranger, is very good in his role too, but he, ironically, is the less interesting of this essentially two-character film.  I found his twitches and mumblings are all too stereotypical of this kind of part.  I found very little real depth to him at all and he, sadly, evokes very little sympathy for the sick man that he is.  I wanted to feel more for him, but simply couldn't.  Perhaps that was intentionally done by the playwright as, in reality, mentally ill people, sadly, annoy us more than touch us.  It is the disability for which we can't readily assist someone; therefore, we often look the other way.  It is not the same as trying to assist someone deaf, blind, or wheelchair restricted.  We can't simply open a door for them.  Mental illness is the often ignored disability because it makes us uncomfortable to be around such individuals.  We only pay attention after the violence happens that is sometimes associated with the kind of severe mental illness depicted in this film, and only then do we cry out, ""Why didn't someone help this man.""This is a film that definitely will not appeal to the masses.  It is both character and story driven, but it's claustrophobic, violent, surreal, sad, pathetic, and just down right depressing.  I can't say that I felt the bugs like many reviewers on here have said as I never accepted them as there in the first place, but the sad life of Judd's character lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

O'Sullivan,"[3, 8]","Like a lot of people I walked into BUG following on the heels of the marketing which sold the film as a horror about... bugs.People trapped in a small space, tin foiled walls, creepy blue lighting, things getting under your skin that should not be there... all wrong (well, almost).  Instead BUG is a tight, sparse, threadbare story of people holed up on their own souls being held prisoner by addiction.  I sat through three quarters of this film waiting for the monsters to arrive, only to find that I had been watching them from the start.  Human monsters, human vices, human horrors - life at the end of pipe.  Not the film I signed up for, not the film I was looking for... but, can anything be salvaged from BUG to recommend?Three things... first, the performances are not bad.  At times it comes across like a far gritter episode of THE L WORD with flashes of brilliance that really help to sell the idea behind the picture.  But, they don't come often, leaving the rest of the film to float along like a block of wood in water.  It's dense, often soap opera quality at best and clipped.  There are some plot surprises, and if you take the time to piece it all together (and, fair warning, it's not easy when you don't have all the pieces to the puzzle) you will get something out of it.  Finally, the direction is not bad.  It's tough to take three rooms and somehow make them into film, but Friedkin does it well enough to keep the picture moving.But, in the end, there is very little to BUG worth watching.  The ending comes quickly and suddenly and with some surprise, but adds nothing to to what had come before it.Commentary is included with the film and for the blind, this commentary will help, but for the rest of it, Friedkin's habit of telling you exactly what's happening on screen as it's actually happening wastes your time.  He does go into some background, does give us some thoughts, but for the majority of the commentary it's too literal to be worth listening to.BUG might have done better to actually have had some bugs in it to help move it along, but as it stands, BUG is a stalled and flawed picture on the state of paranoia and drug use.

I don't mean they exaggerate about how good or exciting it is -- I mean they LIE about its contents and genre.This seems to be especially true with horror films. Horror is popular, so if they can't sell a film on its own merits, they sell it as horror.  HELLCAB (another non-horror film, despite its title) is another example.BUG is based on a stage play (like HELLCAB).BUG is a psychological drama about paranoia.Ever see those schizophrenics or drug addicts who think their bodies are crawling with bugs?  That's what BUG is about.This is no spoiler, since you'll plainly see this early on -- there are NO bugs.  This drifter meets this woman in a motel, they form a relationship, then he tells her about these bugs (that we can't see).  He easily convinces her of his paranoid delusions (she's not playing with a full deck, either).BUG is about their downward spiral.  For instance, there's some self-mutilation as they try to remove the imaginary bugs and egg sacks from their bodies.If sordid self-mutilation is your idea of good horror, then maybe you'll like BUG.I might have given BUG three stars for being an original ""My bodies crawling with bugs!"" paranoid schizophrenic tale. But I deduct one star for the unnecessarily repulsive self-mutilations, and deduct another star for LYING about the film's genre.Sorry, but I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.When I'm in the mood for a horror film, I want horror.

1088610,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000T5O48K,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 7]","Until the point Ashley Judd looks up at the ceiling and begins shouting ""I am the super bug mother. I am the super bug mother"", ""Bug"", the newest film from director William Friedkin was pretty good. But after this point, the fate of the film is sealed. There is simply no way to pull off this line with any degree of believability and the film simply deteriorates.Agnes (Ashley Judd), a waitress at a lesbian honky tonk in Oklahoma, lives in a run down motel in the middle of nowhere. One night, the phone starts to ring and no one is on the other end of the line. She immediately assumes it is Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.), her husband who has recently been released from jail. Her only friend, RC (Lynn Collins), a lesbian waitress at the lesbian honky tonk, introduces Agnes to Peter (Michael Shannon), a drifter. Peter seems to be pretty low key, which is why Agnes agrees to let him stay with her. As they get to know each other, the drifter begins to reveal things about himself. He was once in the Army and recently escaped from a secret hospital where they did experiments on him. Now, he feels like the bugs they have implanted under his skin are starting to break through. Once they break through, they will start to feed on him. Once they start to feed on him, they will also start to feed on Agnes. Thus begins the couple's spiral down into madness.Directed by William Friedkin (""The Exorcist"") and based on a play by Tracy Letts, ""Bug"" effectively builds a lot of tension for the first hour or so, but as Agnes and Peter spiral further down into their madness, the film becomes problematic and almost laughable.Ashley Judd is actually pretty good as Agnes. From the moment we first see her, laying on her sofa, smoking weed, trying to get her mind wrapped around the anonymous phone calls, we realize this is a woman who has suffered in her life. She now seems content, or at least complacent, to live her life in relative peace, as bad as it is. Every time Judd moves, we get a sense of the weight on Agnes' life, how bad her life has been, and how content she may be to live a relatively quiet life, no matter how bad it is.Judd is also fairly unattractive as this woman. Frequently, her hair looks dirty, she wears little or no make-up. She also drinks and smokes heavily, making her appear intensely fatigued.She finds a certain solace at her job, even though she barely makes enough money to scrape by. But she does make enough money to live in her run down motel room, eat, drink, and get high. She now lives in relative peace, which is why these anonymous phone calls are freaking her out even more. Her bank is a coin purse she stuffs under her mattress after adding her evening's tips of single $1 bills every night.Her life has also led her to become more than a little paranoid of strangers, so when the drifter, Peter, is introduced into her life, she is more than a little weary of him. But as she gets to know him, she lets down her defenses and they start to talk, learning a little about each other. As she learns more about him, she becomes more accepting of him. This may seem like a bit of a character development problem, but it really fits. She is so lonely and despondent that any seemingly normal visitor would eventually be welcomed into her home and her life. Simply because she needs the companionship.As they become friends and become involved in each other's lives, Agnes begins to hang on Peter's every word, listening to and believing in everything he has to say. This is also very believable, because Agnes is the type of misguided person who needs to have some guidance, a dominant force in her life. Once she gets this, she latches onto it, for good or bad. This is why the inclusion of the character Jerry (Connick) is so important to the overall fabric of the film. Once we meet him, realize he is an abusive, controlling jerk, we get it. She falls for this type of guy, can't really escape them.Michael Shannon plays Peter, the drifter who happens into Agnes' life. At first, he just seems timid and shy. And this is what draws Agnes to him. But as their relationship develops, he starts to reveal the true extent of his paranoia and Agnes starts to believe in it as well. His performance builds until he is so consumed by his fears, Agnes begins to believe them and adopt them as well. It is an interesting performance because he starts out relatively normal and for a long time, the phobias and problems seep in very slowly.""Bug"" is based on a play, and it has a very play-like feel. Virtually the entire film takes place in Agnes' seedy motel room. Throughout, there are almost never more than two characters on screen at any one time. These two factors help to further reinforce the feeling of abandonment these characters have and help to explain how impressionable they are.What doesn't exactly work are the transitions in the story. As Agnes and Peter become more and more involved in each others lives, as Agnes becomes more and more convinced that what ever Peter says is correct, we see that Peter is, in a way, convincing Agnes to become more like him. But there are stages to this development. At one point, the action shifts and we return to the motel room to find all of the furniture wrapped in plastic. Later, there is another transition and we return to the motel room to find every surface covered in aluminum foil. These moments are probably necessary, but they seem to make a shift that isn't entirely convincing. It would have been more effective to figure out a way for us to watch the madness progress in real time. As it stands, each of these `breaks' make it seem like Act One is ending and then we will have a brief pause before the curtain rises on Act Two.Also, the inclusion of aluminum foil, to `keep out the transmissions' is a movie clich&eacute; at this point, an idea that was new in the 50s. Why are we still returning to this tired mechanism? Try to figure out something new and terrifying.Friedkin has directed a couple of classic films, films that have attained this status due to his ability to create suspense and tension. ""The Exorcist"" is a scary film, but a large part of that can be attributed to the tension he builds between the characters, and with us. ""The French Connection"" is an enormously suspenseful film because Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) is racing to stop a drug deal, building a lot of tension. Friedkin knows his way around these elements and brings them to bear in ""Bug"". The first hour or so is all about creating the characters, showing us their lives, and drawing us into their madness. Then, everything goes wrong...""I am the super bug mother. I am the super bug mother"".There is no actor on the face of the Earth who could pull off this line and make it believable. Not even Merlyn Streep. And Judd, who is really good in this film, is no Meryl Streep. The line is just laughable and completely obliterates any feeling of suspense and tension previously established. It also serves to completely draw us out of the story and to make us aware of everything going on. Because I was so engrossed in the events happening to Agnes and Peter, I overlooked problems. But from this point forward, that was not possible. The problems begin to outweigh everything else.And the last act of the film just deteriorates. And manages to get Judd naked, so we can see her nude.""Bug"" is an interesting and well-made exploration of the two main characters. But once things start to fall apart, we realize how tenuous the connections were to begin with. And everything falls apart. Completely.",3,"""I Am the Super Bug Mother...""

Instead, in William Friedkin's ""Bug,"" paranoia reigns in a run-down motel room. When Agnes White (Ashley Judd), a lonely and nervous waitress, afraid of her abusive ex-husband, meets a war veteran Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), who believes a curious theory about the ""bugs,"" their relationship triggers something deep inside him, and her - a spiral process in which their loneliness (and delusion) is amplified. You know, this is not a film for everyone.""Bug"" intrigued me up to a certain point. In the earlier chapters director William Friedkin suggests Agnes' fears are not totally groundless, using spooky aerial shots or showing Agnes's husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.). But about 40 minutes in, the film attempts to shift the audiences' attention from the blurred line between reality and delusion, to the mental conditions of Agnes and Peter, who start acting more and more unusual.Let's face it. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to watch people obsessed with something. This is what happens in ""Bug,"" but there is more to come. What these people would do in this claustrophobic situation is largely predictable once you sense where the story is leading us. Moreover, the process of their growing delusion might be convincing, but it also alienates us from the characters emotionally. Granted, the film is a wild ride, which is amazingly intense with blood and violence, but I am afraid their intensity contains nothing beneath the surface. Or perhaps that is exactly what is intended.Some viewers might be drawn to the intense world Agnes and Peter represent - and two leads are good actors, I admit - but others including me would think the film is rather pretentious, and no matter how they act well, it is obvious they are acting.",2,Intense Psychological Thriller (But You May Not Like it Because of Its Intensity),1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,1883,"['title', 'B-horror', 'film', 'Bug', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'flesh-eating', 'creatures', 'attacking', 'humans', 'Instead', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Bug', 'paranoia', 'reigns', 'run-down', 'motel', 'room', 'When', 'Agnes', 'White', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'lonely', 'nervous', 'waitress', 'afraid', 'abusive', 'ex-husband', 'war', 'veteran', 'Peter', 'Evans', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'who', 'curious', 'theory', 'bugs', 'relationship', 'triggers', 'something', 'deep', 'spiral', 'process', 'loneliness', 'delusion', 'amplified', 'know', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'Bug', 'intrigued', 'up', 'certain', 'point', 'earlier', 'chapters', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Agnes', 'fears', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'groundless', 'using', 'spooky', 'aerial', 'shots', 'showing', 'Agnes', 'husband', 'Jerry', 'Goss', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'attempts', 'shift', 'audiences', 'attention', 'blurred', 'line', 'reality', 'delusion', 'mental', 'conditions', 'Agnes', 'Peter', 'who', 'start', 'acting', 'more', 'more', 'unusual.Let', 'face', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'people', 'obsessed', 'something', 'what', 'Bug', 'more', 'come', 'What', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'claustrophobic', 'situation', 'largely', 'predictable', 'once', 'sense', 'where', 'story', 'leading', 'Moreover', 'process', 'growing', 'delusion', 'might', 'be', 'convincing', 'also', 'characters', 'emotionally', 'Granted', 'film', 'wild', 'ride', 'amazingly', 'intense', 'blood', 'violence', 'am', 'afraid', 'intensity', 'nothing', 'surface', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'what', 'intended.Some', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'intense', 'world', 'Agnes', 'Peter', 'represent', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'admit', 'others', 'including', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'rather', 'pretentious', 'matter', 'how', 'act', 'well', 'obvious', 'are', 'acting']",N/A

It is very Kafkaesque. The people who gave this movie a bad review have no idea how good this movie is. Why do I say that? Because they just don't get it. They are simple minded generic viewers who want a movie to be predictable and think for them. Ok, so if you are like me, then you will definitely want to give this movie a chance. I almost didn't buy this because of the bad reviews here. What a mistake that would have been. I would have missed out on this INCREDIBLE masterpiece of a movie. For once, the REAL critics got this one right. It recieved a 70% rating from all the top critics as shown at the compilation review site: rotten tomatoes dot com, with both Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper giving it ""thumbs up"" and high praise. 70% on that site is actually considered really good.Only to give you the background of my credentials, I say:I am a huge movie fan who was buying Laserdiscs back in the day when everyone else was watching VHS tapes. I had a DVD player the first month they were released when they cost $1200 and movies on regular DVD were $30 a piece. My current home theater is incredible with a Pioneer Elite Kuro 60"" Plasma and audiophile HDMI 1.3 / 7.1 surround setup. Watching movies at my place is almost better than going to an actual theater. My movie collection is the largest of anyone I have ever met and all my friends trust my recommendations for their movie types and tastes.Ok, so take my word for it. This movie is INCREDIBLE. If you like David Lynch and David Cronenburg movies, then this is one you will enjoy. If you think Brad Pitt did an amazing acting job in Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"", then this movie is for you. If you liked movies like ""Naked Lunch"", ""Spun"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Spider"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Sling Blade"", ""The Salton Sea"", ""Papillon"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"", then this movie is for you!Michael Shannon does the best acting of his career in this movie equaling Brad Pitt's performance in ""12 Monkeys"". Ashley Judd's best acting of her career is shown here. Harry Connick Jr. is so good here that you almost forget he's a great musician because you want to hate him. ALL incredible acting performances. The other people's reviews here on Amazon that said the acting was bad, HAVE NO CLUE what great acting is, so do not believe them! This is some of the finest acting work I have ever seen for this type of movie. It really takes talented actors to do these characters and everyone here is in top notch form.Great set design, cinematography, and directing!Be warned, this movie is DARK and haunting. It's not a Horror movie in the sense of monsters and ghosts. It's a horror movie in the way that it could actually happen in real life. It's dirty and gritty. Very Kafka (google it if you don't know). The only small amount of humor found here is in some of the sarcastic comebacks in a little of the dialog. The rest is very dark with some shocking moments. It does contain sex, drugs, and violence, but it is presented in an artful form that enhances the storyline.Highly Recommended for fans of something dark and different!Thank you so much William Friedkin, Ashley, Harry, and Michael!It's a brilliant masterpiece in it's genre!

Maybe because I am a fan of the director William Friedkin, I came into Bug not expecting your usual modern generic gorefest (and come on now, modern gore movies are tame and lame compared to the 70s 80s stuff, which I doubt dullards and modern horror dorks will even know what I mean and assume I'm talking about Freddy n Jason). If you want the same gore effects, the same dull herky jerky camera work, the same looking monsters, the same spike through the head or decapitation there's plenty of that stuff out there now and plenty more being made, PLENTY! It is funny the second someone sees something slightly different it upsets them to the point of anger. But thats just in response to some unfortunate meat-head reviews I found on here just now. If the negative reviews didn't sound so ""bitchy"" like a 13 year old wrote them I might not have spent any space typing about it but alas, man people suck! Bug has no business being marketed as a horror film, anyways:Bug certainly had an effect on me. The main frightening thing is the insanity between the two main characters is no more insane than the insanity going on between your modern married couple, or house full of drunks, house full of sports fans, house full of anyone. This movie makes knowing people seem disgusting and frightening. Reality and perception of is all in the head. Your language and the way you operate around everyone you know is the insanity portrayed in this film. Ashley Judd's character was no more crazy with her ex-con boyfriend or her girlfriend.The thing is I've met people who remind me of every character in this film, not full blown but easily capable of behaving that way. Friedkin's direction is tight and claustrophobic, I think the film could have tried to shave off the parts that felt too much like a stage play (which yes I know its based on one) and gone more for Friedkin's earlier realism but only in a few parts. The performances are truly intense, there are times when a stutter or a gasp causes more tension and fright than any film of the ""stupid latex karo syrup covered monster intestine with XXXTREEEEMMME SHAKEY MODERN CAMERA (the camera is shaking so that means its scary)"" genre. Ashely Judd pretty much goes completely bonkers on screen and its excruciatingly sad and exhilarating. The visit by the doctor at the end and what it leads up should be in my opinion, iconic horror imagery but gore film translates as horror these days. I feel like I've seen something that deserves more respect than it got. But the movie is what it is, I can't add much to this but say that its a good movie and actually made me think about many things after it was over. The dvd has an excellent interview with Friedkin about his career and his answers are in depth and exhausting.Also, William Friedkin's Sorcerer, see it, just watch it.",4,I'm also a HUGE HORROR FAN,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,2937,"['love', 'gory', 'stupid', 'mess', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'also', 'plenty', 'other', 'types', 'films', 'well', 'Maybe', 'am', 'fan', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'came', 'Bug', 'not', 'expecting', 'usual', 'modern', 'generic', 'gorefest', 'come', 'now', 'modern', 'gore', 'movies', 'are', 'tame', 'lame', 'compared', '70s', '80s', 'stuff', 'doubt', 'dullards', 'modern', 'horror', 'dorks', 'will', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'assume', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Freddy', 'n', 'Jason', 'want', 'same', 'gore', 'effects', 'same', 'dull', 'herky', 'jerky', 'camera', 'work', 'same', 'looking', 'monsters', 'same', 'spike', 'head', 'decapitation', 'plenty', 'stuff', 'there', 'now', 'plenty', 'more', 'being', 'made', 'PLENTY', 'funny', 'second', 'someone', 'something', 'slightly', 'different', 'point', 'anger', 'just', 'response', 'unfortunate', 'meat-head', 'reviews', 'found', 'here', 'just', 'now', 'negative', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'so', 'bitchy', '13', 'year', 'old', 'wrote', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'spent', 'space', 'typing', 'alas', 'man', 'people', 'suck', 'Bug', 'business', 'being', 'marketed', 'horror', 'film', 'anyways', 'Bug', 'certainly', 'had', 'effect', 'main', 'frightening', 'thing', 'insanity', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'insane', 'insanity', 'going', 'modern', 'married', 'couple', 'house', 'full', 'drunks', 'house', 'full', 'sports', 'fans', 'house', 'full', 'anyone', 'movie', 'knowing', 'people', 'seem', 'disgusting', 'frightening', 'Reality', 'perception', 'head', 'language', 'way', 'operate', 'everyone', 'know', 'insanity', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'crazy', 'ex-con', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend.The', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'met', 'people', 'who', 'remind', 'character', 'film', 'not', 'full', 'blown', 'easily', 'capable', 'behaving', 'way', 'Friedkin', 'direction', 'tight', 'claustrophobic', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'shave', 'off', 'parts', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'stage', 'play', 'yes', 'know', 'based', 'one', 'gone', 'more', 'Friedkin', 'earlier', 'realism', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'performances', 'are', 'truly', 'intense', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'stutter', 'gasp', 'more', 'tension', 'fright', 'film', 'stupid', 'latex', 'karo', 'syrup', 'covered', 'monster', 'intestine', 'XXXTREEEEMMME', 'SHAKEY', 'MODERN', 'CAMERA', 'camera', 'shaking', 'so', 'scary', 'genre', 'Ashely', 'Judd', 'pretty', 'much', 'completely', 'bonkers', 'screen', 'excruciatingly', 'sad', 'exhilarating', 'visit', 'doctor', 'end', 'what', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'opinion', 'iconic', 'horror', 'imagery', 'gore', 'film', 'translates', 'horror', 'days', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'more', 'respect', 'got', 'movie', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'think', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'over', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'interview', 'Friedkin', 'career', 'answers', 'are', 'depth', 'exhausting.Also', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Sorcerer', 'see', 'just', 'watch']",N/A
