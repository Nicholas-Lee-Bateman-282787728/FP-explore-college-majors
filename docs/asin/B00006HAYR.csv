And why would a young child be allowed to walk into a school and kill someone?  These issues are at the heart of this film, as this is the supposed motivation for Wesley Snipes in this mainly effective drama.  Whether you're a gun control fanatic or one of those good old boys that think having a gun is the next best thing to heaven, this film has its disturbing moments and benefits from a good director and a good cast.  Linda Fiorentino at first bothers me with her lack of emotional impact; but as the film progresses, we see why Fiorentino is underplaying her role so much.  She is an emotionally wounded individual and only by the film's end do we see what she has struggled through.  Snipes is effective but he was almost too restrained to be totally convincing; would have liked to see more of his anger, guilt, and hurt.  Oliver Platt is okay, but his performance isn't given enough chance to grow.

716065,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006HAYR,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 12]","Liberty Stands Still (Kari Skogland, 2002)This movie, whose US run was a stint at the Palm Springs Film Festival, is hard evidence that even if you're on the A-list, they still won't release everything you make. Wesley Snipes heads up this thriller, backed by B-listers Linda Fiorentino and Oliver Platt, and still the biggest market it played was Italy; its Japanese release was also limited.Snipes stars as Joe, a disenchanted guy with a sniper rifle and a chip on his shoulder. Through a series of not-so-subtle machinations, he traps the heiress to the company that manufactured the rifle (Fiorentino) and has her handcuff herself to a hot dog cart containing a very large bomb in LA. The film's remaining eighty-six minutes (it's ninety-six minutes long, in total) cut between the growing bond between hostage and sniper and the hostage's various attempts to get help.The above sounds like a setup for a movie that beats one about the head and neck region with a gun control message and has nothing deeper for the average viewer. Such is not the case; Skogland does a decent enough job of keeping the gun-control rhetoric to a minimum and in believable places. The message is still a little overpowering, but not nearly as bad as it could have been. The pace is a bit slow for an action/suspense film, but once you're in the proper position, what is there to do, really, but wait? Perhaps the best way to approach this movie is as a combination of the overly preachy John Q. and the as-yet-unreleased Phone Booth.Snipes takes the same deadpan approach to this character he did with Monroe Hutchens in Undisputed, and minimalism is not the best way for Snipes to go. His best moments are when he's right on the edge of losing control. They are, unfortunately, too few. Oliver Platt, as Fiorentino's husband, does a better job here. Unfortunately, he gets too little screen time, and his character is too two-dimensional for him to do much with. What little he can do is worthwhile, however. Fiorentino is fine, and as believable as can be given the situation.All in all, not a bad way to kill ninety minutes.

Why?Sure,a killer could use a knife,or rope,or a bowling ball to kill,but then we are back to that knotty problem involving these items,which are not used for killing only,while guns have no other purpose..Hold the manufacturer as responsible as the trigger-puller and you would see some very stict gun control laws come onto the books pronto,and that is because our corporate types want to continue making big bucks off thier lethal product and would have to go along or go out of business..Then there is that pesky clause about""the right to bear arms""..Written when the Usa was a dangerous wilderness,the nation was new,there were neither standing armies or even police forces,and no refridgerators or super markets and you can see why guns were allowed,even encouraged..Our only military at that time was the citizen-militia,and,afterall,what good would an army do us against an invader if they didn't have-couldn't have-weapons?But that was over 200 hundred years ago,and that need to be your own army,your own police force,your own grocery store is long over,and what is also long over is any real need for the average citizen to possess guns..Still,this does not stop the gun nuts from banging thier empty chests about thier""rights"",or the bogus threats from criminals and/or our government that alledgedly validates thier""need"" to go around armed..Hey-I didn't think the film was so hot,but some of the points made about guns and responsibility were spot on..It's just too bad that they were not made all that well or in a better motion picture...",3,Fair thriller trashed here by the pro gun nuts,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,3068,"['one', 'saying', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'vehicle', 'academy', 'award', 'material', 'Far', 'it..But', 'certainly', 'just', 'as', 'good', '85', '%', 'films', 'similiar', 'film', 'going', 'it-at', 'least', 'here', 'amazon', 'review', 'section-is', 'politics..The', 'pro', 'gun', 'nuts', 'are', 'out', 'force', 'one', 'other', 'reason', 'politics', 'involved', 'BOTH', 'people', 'AND', 'kill', 'people', 'something', 'bullet', 'no-brainers', 'here', 'vehemently', 'disagree', 'withSince', 'so', 'many', 'gun', 'nuts', 'have', 'chosen', 'give', 'plot', 'details', 'comment', 'flat', 'acting', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'politics', 'almost', 'negative', 'review', 'here', 'whole', 'purpose', 'review', 'Most', 'developed', 'nations', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'thier', 'citizens', 'have', 'sort', 'access', 'guns', 'USA', 'most', 'part', 'thier', 'crime', 'murder', 'rates', 'are', 'much', 'lower', 'ours..And', 'hey..These', 'same', 'developed', 'nations', 'are', 'not', 'threatened', 'dictatorships', 'just', 'tom', 'dick', 'harry', 'citizen', ""n't"", 'packing..Guns', 'bubble', 'gum', 'lamp-shades', 'cough', 'medicine', 'sweet', 'corn', 'are', 'commodity', 'product', 'way', 'corporation', 'other', 'make', 'buck..except', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'items', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'millions', 'other', 'products', 'have', ""n't"", 'listed', 'do', 'not', 'thier', 'sole', 'purpose', 'kill', 'things..People', 'animals', 'name', 'it..Guns', 'kill', 'things', 'do', 'nothing', 'else..So', 'when', 'one', 'things', 'are', 'used', 'kill', 'loved', 'one', 'film', 'whom', 'do', 'blame', 'killer', 'sure', 'killer', 'alone', 'Why', 'Sure', 'killer', 'could', 'use', 'knife', 'rope', 'bowling', 'ball', 'kill', 'then', 'are', 'back', 'knotty', 'problem', 'involving', 'items', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'killing', 'only', 'guns', 'have', 'other', 'purpose..Hold', 'manufacturer', 'as', 'responsible', 'trigger-puller', 'would', 'see', 'very', 'stict', 'gun', 'control', 'laws', 'come', 'books', 'corporate', 'types', 'want', 'continue', 'making', 'big', 'bucks', 'off', 'thier', 'lethal', 'product', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'along', 'go', 'business..Then', 'pesky', 'clause', 'right', 'bear', 'arms', '..Written', 'when', 'Usa', 'was', 'dangerous', 'wilderness', 'nation', 'was', 'new', 'were', 'standing', 'armies', 'even', 'police', 'forces', 'refridgerators', 'super', 'markets', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'guns', 'were', 'allowed', 'even', 'only', 'military', 'time', 'was', 'citizen-militia', 'afterall', 'what', 'good', 'would', 'army', 'do', 'invader', 'did', ""n't"", 'have-could', ""n't"", 'have-weapons', 'was', '200', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'need', 'be', 'own', 'army', 'own', 'police', 'force', 'own', 'grocery', 'store', 'long', 'what', 'also', 'long', 'over', 'real', 'need', 'average', 'citizen', 'possess', 'guns..Still', 'not', 'stop', 'gun', 'nuts', 'banging', 'thier', 'empty', 'chests', 'thier', 'rights', 'bogus', 'threats', 'criminals', 'government', 'alledgedly', 'thier', 'need', 'go', 'armed..Hey-I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'hot', 'points', 'made', 'guns', 'responsibility', 'were', 'spot', 'on..It', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'were', 'not', 'made', 'well', 'better', 'motion', 'picture']",Liberty Stands Still

Don't even watch it on cable.... at the end of it you'll want your time back.I seriously wish I had turned it off halfway through like I wanted to instead of watching the whole thing.",1,Straight to video FOR A GOOD REASON,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,1360,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'do', 'ultra-stupid', 'movie', 'acting', 'flat', 'story', 'non-existent', 'editing', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'whole', 'movie', 'terrible', 'boring.I', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'nothing', 'ever', 'plot', 'development', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'never', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'investors', 'who', 'sunk', 'money', 'turkey.Not', 'only', 'movie', 'awful', 'incomprehensible', 'boring', 'also', 'just', 'stupid', 'piece', 'anti-gun', 'rights', 'propaganda', 'supposed', 'be', 'stupid', 'message', 'flick', 'how', 'gun', 'industry', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'keep', 'guns', 'hands', 'kids', 'criminals', 'movie', 'so', 'stupid', 'message-political', 'otherwise-is', 'completely', 'lost', 'yawning', 'checking', 'watch', 'bet', 'whole', 'mess', 'was', 'funded', 'anti-gun', 'activist', 'groups.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'other', 'people', 'there', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'check', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'even', 'waste', 'time', 'renting', 'something', 'so', 'here', 'nut', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WASTE', 'YOUR', 'TIME', 'ON', 'THIS', 'STUPID', 'BORING', 'MOVIE', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'cable', 'end', ""'ll"", 'want', 'time', 'back.I', 'seriously', 'wish', 'had', 'turned', 'off', 'halfway', 'wanted', 'instead', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing']",Liberty Stands Still
716068,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B00006HAYR,Tom Collier,"[5, 12]","I'll say it straight out; I'm pro-gun and proud of it. I'm also a lover of nearly any and everything film related, though this movie is just pure garbage.The whole thing is  poorly shot, acted, and written anti-gun propaganda. In an awful attempt to be ironic, the movie has ex-CIA agent Snipes (who has starred in more than a few movies that glorify guns) holding gun executive Fiorentino hostage with a sniper rifle.Not only does the movie completely fall flat with it's rapport between the leads (unlike Phone Booth, which has a similar scenerio but is brilliantly executed), but the movie takes the trouble to insist that gun companies are responsible for deliberately giving out arms to gang members. While it's definitely not anywhere near below the anti-gun lobby to lie, the assertion that the gun industry hands out firearms to gangs is so ridiclious that even a detailed look at any anti-gun website won't make the claim. This movie is ridiclious, and instead of trying to make a sensible argument for gun control, it decides to try to manipulate emotion and distort the truth, much like Bowling for Columbine.

716069,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006HAYR,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Linda Fiorentino, Wesley Snipes and Oliver Platt (in that order) star in this awfully tedious thriller with a questionable political message.  Let's not talk about the issues like pro- or anti-gun control for now, because the film (which is directed by the same person who did &quot;Children of the Corn 666&quot; -- quite a damning title) has no thrills or suspence.  And at the time of writing this, we have not seen Ms. Fiorentino for two years -- hope it has not killed her career.The story is marginally interesting; I say marginally, for we later are to see much better &quot;Phone Booth.&quot;  Like Colin Farrell film, the protagonist Liberty Wallace (Linda Fiorentino) finds herself in a big trouble.  Someone named 'Joe' (Snipes) aims a rifle at her while she is chained to a hotdog stand where an explosive device is set.  And Liverty is a wife of a rich gun manufacturor (Oliver Platt), and Joe claims he lost his daughter because of the gun her company made.The story, which starts promisingly, suddenly loses steam in the first fifteen minutes.  And then, it's all about the confusing situations and paper-thin characters whom we just don't care.  In terms of thriller, first of all, it is a total failure.  See, if the guy Joe is really a good marksman as the film shows, why does he need a bomb in the first place?  Unaccountably, the film introduces another 'bomb' rigged to the body of a poor fellow (who is supposedly having an affair with Liberty) which only detracts the tension of the main story.The film rasies interesting questions such as, Is Liberty (or her husband) really responsible for the death of the people killed by guns?  The director clearly leans on the left side, which in itself is no problem.  But as the character of Joe is so superficial and unconvincing that his logics start to look like that of a monster.  He never tells us what happened to the daughter, nor he blames the culprit while he could kill innocent people.  There is little sign of intelligence behind his characterization, which is an insult to the victims or survivors of the real murder cases.Of course, the film could be an example of escapism, (like &quot;Phone Booth&quot; again), but the film suffers at that point from the bad acting and awful dialogues with cluttered pace.  Wooden performance from the two leads are deplorable, and as to Ms. Fiorentino, we sincerely miss her in &quot;MIB.&quot;Need a thriller with snipers?  Again I say, see &quot;Phone Booth&quot; instead.  And its sniper Kiefer Sutherland is ten times more authentic than Snipes, though -- or perhaps because -- Kiefer scarcely shows his face.",1,Lamentable &quot;Sniper&quot; Thriller: See &quot;Phone Booth&quot; Instead,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,2631,"['Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'order', 'star', 'awfully', 'tedious', 'thriller', 'questionable', 'political', 'message', 'Let', 'not', 'talk', 'issues', 'pro-', 'anti-gun', 'control', 'now', 'film', 'directed', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'quot', 'Children', 'Corn', '666', 'quot', 'quite', 'damning', 'title', 'thrills', 'suspence', 'time', 'writing', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Ms.', 'Fiorentino', 'two', 'years', 'hope', 'not', 'killed', 'career.The', 'story', 'marginally', 'interesting', 'say', 'marginally', 'later', 'are', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth.', 'quot', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Liberty', 'Wallace', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'big', 'trouble', 'Someone', 'named', ""'Joe"", 'Snipes', 'rifle', 'chained', 'hotdog', 'stand', 'where', 'explosive', 'device', 'set', 'Liverty', 'wife', 'rich', 'gun', 'manufacturor', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Joe', 'lost', 'daughter', 'gun', 'company', 'made.The', 'story', 'promisingly', 'suddenly', 'steam', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'then', 'confusing', 'situations', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'whom', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'terms', 'thriller', 'first', 'total', 'failure', 'See', 'guy', 'Joe', 'really', 'good', 'marksman', 'film', 'shows', 'why', 'need', 'bomb', 'first', 'place', 'Unaccountably', 'film', ""'bomb"", 'rigged', 'body', 'poor', 'fellow', 'who', 'supposedly', 'having', 'affair', 'Liberty', 'only', 'tension', 'main', 'story.The', 'film', 'rasies', 'interesting', 'questions', 'such', 'Liberty', 'husband', 'really', 'responsible', 'death', 'people', 'killed', 'guns', 'director', 'clearly', 'left', 'side', 'problem', 'character', 'Joe', 'so', 'superficial', 'unconvincing', 'logics', 'start', 'look', 'monster', 'never', 'happened', 'daughter', 'culprit', 'could', 'kill', 'innocent', 'people', 'little', 'sign', 'intelligence', 'characterization', 'insult', 'victims', 'survivors', 'real', 'murder', 'cases.Of', 'course', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'example', 'escapism', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'again', 'film', 'suffers', 'point', 'bad', 'acting', 'awful', 'dialogues', 'cluttered', 'pace', 'Wooden', 'performance', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'deplorable', 'Ms.', 'Fiorentino', 'sincerely', 'miss', 'quot', 'MIB.', 'quot', 'thriller', 'snipers', 'Again', 'say', 'see', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'instead', 'sniper', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'authentic', 'Snipes', 'though', 'perhaps', 'Kiefer', 'scarcely', 'face']",Liberty Stands Still
716070,A3OBW7ZP7B1Y1N,B00006HAYR,T. VanPool,"[6, 8]","Warning***Some spoilers belowThis movie has good moments, and creates a surprising amount of intensity for a story that revolves around an individual literally standing still.  However, the political statements related to gun accessibility are way over the top and so heavy handed that they become trite.  After a short while I found myself focusing more on the inaccuracies and inconsistencies of the political arguments instead of the movie itself.For example, the individual who is upset about the random murder of his daughter by a gunman thinks nothing about killing other people's children. Hmmm... Not a particularly good protagonist.There is absolutely no counter balance to the story, and the characters become so stereotyped that they lose an real appeal.  This is especially true of Liberty, who lacks any redeming quality.  Further, nearly everyone in the story winds up dead, except for Liberty, who gets to walk off with her boyfriend after leaving her husband, who unnecessarily placed himself in danger to try to save her, dieing on the street. She didn't even give him a backward glance. I have to admit that by the end of the movie, she was the only character I really wanted to see die.  Instead, she is the only one who lives.  Go figure... (I think the director wanted us to think of the husband as the villain and Liberty as the hero, but I can't think of a single appealing characteristic of Liberty whereas the husband demonstrated bravery, motivation, and a willingness to sacrifice for others.)Over all, the movie isn't worth the ride.  The cinemaphotography is stylish and the concept is neat.  However, the politics are just too dogmatic and poorly argued, and the characters are not compelling.  It could have been a good movie, but it just didn't turn out that way.",2,Heavy handed politics ruin an interesting film,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1795,"['Warning***Some', 'spoilers', 'belowThis', 'movie', 'good', 'moments', 'surprising', 'amount', 'intensity', 'story', 'individual', 'literally', 'standing', 'still', 'However', 'political', 'statements', 'related', 'gun', 'accessibility', 'are', 'way', 'top', 'so', 'heavy', 'handed', 'become', 'trite', 'short', 'while', 'found', 'focusing', 'more', 'inaccuracies', 'inconsistencies', 'political', 'arguments', 'instead', 'movie', 'itself.For', 'example', 'individual', 'who', 'upset', 'random', 'murder', 'daughter', 'gunman', 'nothing', 'killing', 'other', 'people', 'children', 'Hmmm', 'Not', 'particularly', 'good', 'protagonist.There', 'absolutely', 'counter', 'balance', 'story', 'characters', 'become', 'so', 'stereotyped', 'lose', 'real', 'appeal', 'especially', 'true', 'Liberty', 'who', 'redeming', 'quality', 'Further', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'story', 'up', 'dead', 'Liberty', 'who', 'walk', 'off', 'boyfriend', 'leaving', 'husband', 'who', 'unnecessarily', 'placed', 'danger', 'try', 'save', 'dieing', 'street', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'backward', 'glance', 'have', 'admit', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'die', 'Instead', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Go', 'figure', 'think', 'director', 'wanted', 'think', 'husband', 'villain', 'Liberty', 'hero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'appealing', 'characteristic', 'Liberty', 'husband', 'demonstrated', 'bravery', 'motivation', 'willingness', 'sacrifice', 'others', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'ride', 'cinemaphotography', 'stylish', 'concept', 'neat', 'However', 'politics', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'dogmatic', 'poorly', 'argued', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'compelling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way']",Liberty Stands Still
