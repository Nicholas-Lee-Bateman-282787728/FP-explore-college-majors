I rent from netflix and often find myself sending movies back ASAP after watching them just to get the next bollywood film not Dostana I can't wait to watch it again.

John & Abhishek look sexy, but you can fall in love for both, as they go from funny to tender. You can laugh a lot, no matter if you are straight or gay. There is a good message for a conservative society (or even conservative sectors of our ""modern"" societies), as being gay is defended and the most traditional character in the film finally accepts the ""gay"" couple. Which is the ending of this story? You can take your choice.

1221688,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B001O3XB4Y,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[3, 4]","Mumbai crash-lands in Miami, and voil&agrave;, Bollywood meets 'The Birdcage.' The two go together like sun and sand. The reason it didn't happen sooner is because same-sex romance was a taboo movie topic in India--until 'Dostana' came along, that is. The film isn't preachy about tolerance in the least, but rather, it's a rollicking good time, right from the get-go. Maybe that's why audiences embraced the theme despite its touchiness and turned out in droves.The film opens with Bollywood's favorite eye candy, John Abraham, emerging from the ocean Ursula Andress-style--a shimmering Adonis in tight swim trunks. Hero No. 2, Abhishek Bachchan, pulls up in a pink fishtail Cadillac with a bevy of babes in the back seat. And a bikini-clad Shilpa Shetty performs the catchy number ""Shut Up and Bounce"" along Miami's South Beach, cavorting with the two men. But wait--isn't the movie about a gay relationship? No, but it is about acceptance of gay relationships, done in the spirit of 'La Cage Aux Folles.' Instead of two gay men pretending to be a straight couple, two straight men pretend to be a gay couple.The film firmly establishes that the main characters, Sameer (Bachchan) and Kunal (Abraham), like women--a lot. They're macho lady-killers who meet one morning over breakfast after shacking up with two women who live together. Kunal is a fashion photographer who has access to gorgeous women galore, while Sameer is a nurse, who's secure enough in his masculinity to comfortably work in a female-dominated field. They run into each other again when they both show up to rent the same apartment, and both are turned down by the landlady, who doesn't want virile young men as tenants, since they'll be sharing the place with her niece, Neha (Priyanka Chopra). They don't want to pass up the chance to live in this incredible pad, so they tell the landlady they're gay and she decides to make an exception for them. The problems begin when they meet Neha and both are immediately hot for her, but they can't reveal the truth to her or they'll get thrown out. The three become close friends as they hit the beaches and clubs of Miami. The comical complications pile up when Sameer's mother, who's unaware of her son's ruse, shows up for a visit, along with an immigration officer, who's checking to make sure their relationship is legitimate since they applied for permanent residency as a same-sex couple. When Neha starts dating her boss, Abhi (Bobby Deol), Sameer and Kunal--now completely in love with her--do everything they can to break them up, with hilarious results. Of course, only one of these three men can have her, and all of their friendships end up on the line.[...]",5,Must See,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2689,"['Mumbai', 'crash-lands', 'Miami', 'voil', 'agrave', 'Bollywood', ""'The"", 'Birdcage', 'two', 'go', 'together', 'sun', 'sand', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'sooner', 'same-sex', 'romance', 'was', 'taboo', 'movie', 'topic', 'India', ""'Dostana"", 'came', 'along', 'film', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'tolerance', 'least', 'rather', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'right', 'get-go', 'Maybe', 'why', 'audiences', 'embraced', 'theme', 'touchiness', 'turned', 'out', 'droves.The', 'film', 'Bollywood', 'favorite', 'eye', 'candy', 'John', 'Abraham', 'emerging', 'ocean', 'Ursula', 'Andress-style', 'shimmering', 'Adonis', 'tight', 'swim', 'trunks', 'Hero', 'No', '2', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'up', 'pink', 'fishtail', 'Cadillac', 'bevy', 'babes', 'back', 'seat', 'bikini-clad', 'Shilpa', 'Shetty', 'catchy', 'number', 'Shut', 'Up', 'Bounce', 'Miami', 'South', 'Beach', 'cavorting', 'two', 'men', 'wait', ""n't"", 'movie', 'gay', 'relationship', 'No', 'acceptance', 'gay', 'relationships', 'done', 'spirit', ""'La"", 'Cage', 'Aux', 'Folles', 'Instead', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'pretending', 'be', 'straight', 'couple', 'two', 'straight', 'men', 'pretend', 'be', 'gay', 'couple.The', 'film', 'firmly', 'main', 'characters', 'Sameer', 'Bachchan', 'Kunal', 'Abraham', 'women', 'lot', ""'re"", 'macho', 'lady-killers', 'who', 'meet', 'one', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'shacking', 'up', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'Kunal', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'who', 'access', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'galore', 'Sameer', 'nurse', 'who', 'secure', 'enough', 'masculinity', 'comfortably', 'work', 'female-dominated', 'field', 'run', 'other', 'again', 'when', 'show', 'up', 'rent', 'same', 'apartment', 'are', 'turned', 'down', 'landlady', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'virile', 'young', 'men', 'tenants', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sharing', 'place', 'niece', 'Neha', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'live', 'incredible', 'pad', 'tell', 'landlady', ""'re"", 'gay', 'make', 'exception', 'problems', 'begin', 'when', 'meet', 'Neha', 'are', 'immediately', 'hot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'truth', ""'ll"", 'get', 'thrown', 'out', 'three', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'hit', 'beaches', 'clubs', 'Miami', 'comical', 'complications', 'pile', 'up', 'when', 'Sameer', 'mother', 'who', 'unaware', 'son', 'ruse', 'up', 'visit', 'immigration', 'officer', 'who', 'checking', 'make', 'sure', 'relationship', 'legitimate', 'applied', 'permanent', 'residency', 'same-sex', 'couple', 'When', 'Neha', 'dating', 'boss', 'Abhi', 'Bobby', 'Deol', 'Sameer', 'Kunal', 'now', 'completely', 'love', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'hilarious', 'results', 'course', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'men', 'can', 'have', 'friendships', 'end', 'up', 'line.', '[', ']']",Dostana

(After all, didn't they make a whole TV series about a guy pretending to be gay so that he could live with a couple of hot girls? We've been down this road once before.)This was actually my first foray into Bollywood. I can't really believe that people talked this way.What else? The two guys in the movie were nice looking. It is hard to believe that any man who was able to get women as easily as what we were led to believe that these two could would get so hung up on one woman-- especially when there are so many others available.Lastly: There were at least a couple of unresolved ends. And that didn't help.Overall, take this for what it is: Popular comedy/ cinematic kitsch. It is worth seeing for the novelty of Bollywood (for those of us that have not been exposed to it before).

1221692,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B001O3XB4Y,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[12, 13]","This very modern movie about 2 straight guys pretending to be a gay couple to share an apartment in the USA and gain quicker citizenship, was a lot of fun.I gather the gay thing was a bit of a challenge for some conservative Indians but I doubt would raise an eyebrow in the West. The 2 guys are well played by Abhishek Bachchan and John Abrahams who are so secure in their own sexuality that they were able to inhabit the roles and have fun with them without looking awkward. In fact Abhishek is more relaxed than ever and even dances less woodenly. He and John have great 'friend' chemistry and obviously had a ball making it. His comedic timing resists going over the top and is very good.Priyanka looks suitable gorgeous and acts fine (despite quite a few Bollywood critics who see her as a lousy actress- and in fact often lump Abhishek in with that in acting ability - quite unfairly I think). Bobby Deol also has a small but solid part to play. Not much is required of him but he does the nice guy thing well.The plot leaves you guessing which guy she'll go for. There was one small part of the script involving manipulating a 5 year old (no spoilers though) that I did feel crossed the line.There are some quite catchy songs and colorful dance numbers.It is a light comedy piece - not of the over-the-top slapstick Indian's often like in comedy. It is much more Western in its pitch. I think they played sensitively with the gay thing and I don't think any gay person I know would feel offended by it. On the contrary it adds a certain respect for gays as a legitimate part of the world in a way they generally aren't in Indian movies -  even one of their mothers accept this as 'Gods choice' for them!I could almost give this a double the stars for the DVD producers finally addressing the needs of the DVD viewer.As the credits roll there is a colourful song and dance number reduced in size to fit next to the names. For the DVD viewer this is always hard to view - and generally is displayed in the same format if you try to select it through the songs menu. This time, after they had finished with the credits and the reduced size number, they replayed the number in full screen. Many thanks from a grateful viewer who finally got her moneys worth!A lot of light-hearted, well acted fun - and Abhishek is opening up more and more in his range and ability and gives a great performance in particular.",5,A lot of fun,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2412,"['very', 'modern', 'movie', '2', 'straight', 'guys', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'couple', 'share', 'apartment', 'USA', 'gain', 'quicker', 'citizenship', 'was', 'lot', 'fun.I', 'gather', 'gay', 'thing', 'was', 'bit', 'challenge', 'conservative', 'Indians', 'doubt', 'would', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'West', '2', 'guys', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'John', 'Abrahams', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'secure', 'own', 'sexuality', 'were', 'able', 'inhabit', 'roles', 'have', 'fun', 'looking', 'awkward', 'fact', 'Abhishek', 'more', 'relaxed', 'ever', 'even', 'dances', 'less', 'woodenly', 'John', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'obviously', 'had', 'ball', 'making', 'comedic', 'timing', 'resists', 'going', 'top', 'very', 'good.Priyanka', 'suitable', 'gorgeous', 'fine', 'quite', 'few', 'Bollywood', 'critics', 'who', 'see', 'lousy', 'actress-', 'fact', 'often', 'lump', 'Abhishek', 'acting', 'ability', 'quite', 'unfairly', 'think', 'Bobby', 'Deol', 'also', 'small', 'solid', 'part', 'play', 'Not', 'much', 'required', 'nice', 'guy', 'thing', 'well.The', 'plot', 'guessing', 'guy', ""'ll"", 'go', 'was', 'one', 'small', 'part', 'script', 'involving', 'manipulating', '5', 'year', 'old', 'spoilers', 'did', 'feel', 'crossed', 'line.There', 'are', 'quite', 'catchy', 'songs', 'colorful', 'dance', 'numbers.It', 'light', 'comedy', 'piece', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'Indian', 'often', 'comedy', 'much', 'more', 'Western', 'pitch', 'think', 'played', 'sensitively', 'gay', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'gay', 'person', 'know', 'would', 'feel', 'offended', 'contrary', 'certain', 'respect', 'gays', 'legitimate', 'part', 'world', 'way', 'generally', 'are', ""n't"", 'Indian', 'movies', 'even', 'one', 'mothers', 'accept', ""'Gods"", 'choice', 'could', 'almost', 'give', 'double', 'stars', 'DVD', 'producers', 'finally', 'addressing', 'needs', 'DVD', 'viewer.As', 'credits', 'roll', 'colourful', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'reduced', 'size', 'fit', 'next', 'names', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'always', 'hard', 'view', 'generally', 'displayed', 'same', 'format', 'try', 'select', 'songs', 'menu', 'time', 'had', 'finished', 'credits', 'reduced', 'size', 'number', 'replayed', 'number', 'full', 'screen', 'Many', 'thanks', 'grateful', 'viewer', 'who', 'finally', 'got', 'moneys', 'worth', 'lot', 'light-hearted', 'well', 'acted', 'fun', 'Abhishek', 'opening', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'range', 'ability', 'great', 'performance', 'particular']",Dostana

1221695,AGS1GGTC4ZK4V,B001O3XB4Y,Orton Redux,"[0, 1]","Hot! The first-time writer-director, Tarun Mansukhani, pushes a creaky plot - two guys pretending to be gay - to levels of farce. The result is one of fastest paced, and deliriously enjoyable, Bollywood movies in recent memory that is also a comic paen to tolerance. The movie pushes aside the question of ""Are they, or arent they?"" to the last minute (watch the epilogue, and you may still argue about which side of the fence the boys built their dream home on). In spirit and crackle, if not the drag, this is a Bollywood Some Like It Hot, which not coincidentally was also set in Miami. In the heat, everyone gets gently skewered one way or another, without breaking not so much into sweat but, typically, song. The best of an iTunes-worthy lot: the opener Shut Up and Bounce and the closing Maa Da Ladla remix. The four leads (Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, John Abraham, and John Abrahams toned body) create their chosen family with such astonishing ease, the result is positively infectious and hugely appealing. In this, Dostana, more than any other Bollywood production, nails the exuberance of today's India - super-confident, international to the bone, and polished enough to show Hollywood how its done on its own turf. No wonder Dostana 2 is already in the works. If they can pull it off, Karan Johar & Company will have a franchise on their hands, with the Abhishek-Abraham combo triumphant in almost any setting. Of course, the final installment of such a series would settle the ""Are they, or aren't they?"" question once and for all - and in the affirmative, which this  movie, already, suggests we consider in our hearts.
