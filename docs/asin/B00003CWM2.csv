The plot was the biggest challenge to satisfy the Hollywood audience. However, it's not a surprise that Leo would choose a film with a difficult plot, his previous films have been critically acclaimed but not always praised by the audience. His performance as Richard in this film is quite impressive, probably better than the character he played in Titanic. The deleted scenes is satisfying, with a behind-the-scenes look and the alternate opening sequence.",4,A difficult film to satisfy the Hollywood audience.,994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,588,"['Many', 'were', 'disappointed', 'Leo', 'latest', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'Not', 'enjoyed', 'moment', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'satisfy', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'However', 'not', 'surprise', 'Leo', 'would', 'choose', 'film', 'difficult', 'plot', 'previous', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'not', 'always', 'praised', 'audience', 'performance', 'Richard', 'film', 'quite', 'impressive', 'probably', 'better', 'character', 'played', 'Titanic', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'satisfying', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence']",N/A

I don't remember what I was expecting, but it was nothing like what I thought it was going to be.  I decided a while back to revisit the film, since I was young when I first saw it and figured that maybe my taste was the problem.It wasn't.`The Beach' has a brilliant premise and a lot of promise, but it fails to capitalize on any of that.  You have a cast that includes some hot bodies (Virginie Ledoyen), some rising stars (Leonardo DiCaprio) and some established talents (Tilda Swinton).  You have a director who has already established himself as a stunning and provocative visionary (his 1996 film `Trainspotting' is still relevant, poignant and unforgettable) and you have a foundation wrapped around a well regarded and loved novel (I need to read it, but I hear all sorts of wonderful things about it).  Add to that a stunning location and you have the makings of a potential masterpiece.So why does `The Beach' fall apart?The film basically tells the story of a young and impulsive man named Richard who throws caution to the wind while backpacking in Thailand and decides to accompany a French couple (or they accompany him) in pursuit of an island.  What he finds is an endless supply of pot and a group of islanders who live in a dangerous sort of harmony.  Richard and his friends are adopted into the commune, but not without disturbing the unity and bringing about lots of problems and consequences.There are moments of the film that work very well (like the shark attack) but there is so much of the film that just lacks any real punch, thanks to a surprising lack of character development.  The film seems rather pointless, instead of really picking up on the social commentary that is waiting to be expounded on.  Some ambitious novels cannot translate well onto the big screen.  Maybe this was one of those novels.The performances are decent at best, with only Tilda Swinton standing out as very good (and even she suffers from a lack of material).  DiCaprio took a few steps back with this one.  Even Danny Boyle, who is usually remarkable behind the lens, suffers from an inappropriately stimulated imagination.  His most ambitious sequences are the ones that help tear the film apart.  In fact, the whole videogame scene alone is enough to knock a whole star (or maybe even two) from the films overall grade.  The cinematography is good, but it is far from outstanding, and it should have been considering the location.  It is just sub par.In fact, the film in general can be described as sub par; severely underdeveloped and forgettable.",2,"There is very, VERY little here...",1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2637,"['When', 'saw', 'Beach', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'whelmed', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'nothing', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'decided', 'while', 'back', 'revisit', 'film', 'was', 'young', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'figured', 'maybe', 'taste', 'was', 'problem.It', ""wasn't."", 'Beach', 'brilliant', 'premise', 'lot', 'promise', 'capitalize', 'have', 'cast', 'hot', 'bodies', 'Virginie', 'Ledoyen', 'rising', 'stars', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'established', 'talents', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'have', 'director', 'who', 'already', 'established', 'stunning', 'provocative', 'visionary', '1996', 'film', 'Trainspotting', 'still', 'relevant', 'poignant', 'unforgettable', 'have', 'foundation', 'wrapped', 'well', 'regarded', 'loved', 'novel', 'need', 'read', 'hear', 'sorts', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Add', 'stunning', 'location', 'have', 'makings', 'potential', 'masterpiece.So', 'why', 'Beach', 'fall', 'apart', 'film', 'basically', 'story', 'young', 'impulsive', 'man', 'named', 'Richard', 'who', 'caution', 'wind', 'backpacking', 'Thailand', 'accompany', 'French', 'couple', 'accompany', 'pursuit', 'island', 'What', 'endless', 'supply', 'pot', 'group', 'islanders', 'who', 'live', 'dangerous', 'sort', 'harmony', 'Richard', 'friends', 'are', 'adopted', 'commune', 'not', 'disturbing', 'unity', 'bringing', 'lots', 'problems', 'consequences.There', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'shark', 'attack', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'just', 'real', 'punch', 'thanks', 'surprising', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'rather', 'pointless', 'instead', 'really', 'picking', 'up', 'social', 'commentary', 'waiting', 'be', 'expounded', 'ambitious', 'novels', 'can', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Maybe', 'was', 'one', 'novels.The', 'performances', 'are', 'decent', 'best', 'only', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'standing', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'lack', 'material', 'DiCaprio', 'took', 'few', 'steps', 'back', 'one', 'Even', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'who', 'usually', 'remarkable', 'lens', 'suffers', 'inappropriately', 'stimulated', 'imagination', 'most', 'ambitious', 'sequences', 'are', 'ones', 'help', 'tear', 'film', 'apart', 'fact', 'whole', 'videogame', 'scene', 'alone', 'enough', 'knock', 'whole', 'star', 'maybe', 'even', 'two', 'films', 'overall', 'grade', 'cinematography', 'good', 'far', 'outstanding', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considering', 'location', 'just', 'sub', 'par.In', 'fact', 'film', 'general', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'sub', 'par', 'severely', 'underdeveloped', 'forgettable']",N/A

It's certainly not that, but it's also not a terrible movie. The problem is that it's the ""Trainspotting"" director giving us a story that's an odd hybrid of ""Six Nights, Seven Days"" and ""Trainspotting"" -- with a contempt for ordinary travelers that even the movie eventually acknowledges if fatuous -- that veers off unexpectedly to become ""Lord of the Flies"" or ""Apocalypse Now.""Which isn't to say that there's nothing good in the movie. The setting is breathtaking, and many of the performances -- by a who's who of indie film regulars -- are extremely well-done. Even many of the story and directorial conceits work well, most notably a videogame sequence late in the film.But ultimately, the movie's lack of focus makes for a frustrating experience.

517685,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00003CWM2,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","The Beach is a flawed film.  It's about Leonardo DiCaprio taking two people (a man and woman both around his age) to a secluded beach island where apparently all the marijuana of a lifetime can be found.  Fields and fields of that stuff!  Of course, it's interesting how this island is considered such a private mystery when it's within swimming distance of another more popular island which seems like a major storyline flaw to me, but even then, the first 25 minutes of writing is totally awful.  Below average storytelling that accomplishes virtually nothing.However as soon as the one man pulls a shark prank on Leonardo (25 minutes in) this is when the storytelling improves... for a little while.  When Leonardo and friends find themselves involved among the farmers/islanders that don't take too kindly to an abundance of outsiders, this is probably the best segment for the next 45 minutes.  Why is this, you wonder?  Because Leonardo and friends ultimately escape these protective gunmen by taking a giant leap off a waterfall, and discover a more polite and respectable group of people that have actually secretly made a home on the island.At first these people don't really welcome any outsiders either, but eventually they come around when it's realized Leonardo and friends fit right in.  They then become part of the ultimate paradise away from society.  Here's where my 3-star rating comes in- for 45 minutes, almost *nothing* of interest occurs- it's all about partying, meeting the people, falling in love, fishing, etc.  Really boring stuff to be honest.Now what's interesting is that the movie is sort of divided between two different genres.  The first half focuses around adventure with sprinkles of drama and relationships, but the moment a certain shark attack occurs during the second half (or rather, the final 40 minutes) we experience a drastically different and more suspenseful/violent change of pace.  The second half is a rather awkward, clumsy and undeveloped piece of writing that feels out of place.  NOW Leonardo DiCaprio ventures out on his own when it's discovered he may have given information pertaining to the secret island to other people that may be on their way there, so it becomes his job to stop them from entering (by keeping a lookout on a hilltop).You see the farmers/islanders (the gunmen I mention above) only allow a certain amount of people to live there, but eventually it's discovered that too many have found their way there unbeknownst to the islanders, prompting them to change their inviting ways into a more forceful ""Get out of here NOW before we shoot you"".  Tilda Swinton is sort of boring too, which is odd becaues she's a fantastic actress most of the time.  She's the one in charge of the private people living on the island, but her relationship segments with Leonardo DiCaprio are really pointless and uninteresting.  The segment with Leonardo turning into a video game character was probably the most unusual part of the movie.Honestly when it comes down to it, all the flaws in the world can't cover up the fact the Beach just really suffers from a lack of interest.  When Leonardo separates himself from the rest of the pack, it was basically too late into the movie to really change how I feel about the first half which is a shame.  This could have been a really good adventure movie.  As it stands, it's below average.",3,take me to your special island,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,3392,"['Beach', 'flawed', 'film', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'taking', 'two', 'people', 'man', 'woman', 'age', 'secluded', 'beach', 'island', 'where', 'apparently', 'marijuana', 'lifetime', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Fields', 'fields', 'stuff', 'course', 'interesting', 'how', 'island', 'considered', 'private', 'mystery', 'when', 'swimming', 'distance', 'more', 'popular', 'island', 'major', 'storyline', 'flaw', 'even', 'then', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'writing', 'totally', 'awful', 'average', 'storytelling', 'virtually', 'nothing.However', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'man', 'shark', 'prank', 'Leonardo', '25', 'minutes', 'when', 'storytelling', 'little', 'while', 'When', 'Leonardo', 'friends', 'find', 'involved', 'farmers/islanders', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'abundance', 'outsiders', 'probably', 'best', 'segment', 'next', '45', 'minutes', 'Why', 'wonder', 'Leonardo', 'ultimately', 'escape', 'protective', 'gunmen', 'taking', 'giant', 'leap', 'waterfall', 'discover', 'more', 'polite', 'respectable', 'group', 'people', 'have', 'actually', 'secretly', 'made', 'home', 'island.At', 'first', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'welcome', 'outsiders', 'eventually', 'come', 'when', 'realized', 'Leonardo', 'friends', 'fit', 'right', 'then', 'become', 'part', 'ultimate', 'paradise', 'away', 'society', 'Here', 'where', '3-star', 'rating', 'in-', '45', 'minutes', 'almost', '*nothing*', 'interest', 'occurs-', 'partying', 'meeting', 'people', 'falling', 'love', 'fishing', 'etc', 'Really', 'boring', 'stuff', 'be', 'honest.Now', 'what', 'interesting', 'movie', 'sort', 'divided', 'two', 'different', 'genres', 'first', 'half', 'adventure', 'sprinkles', 'drama', 'relationships', 'moment', 'certain', 'shark', 'attack', 'second', 'half', 'rather', 'final', '40', 'minutes', 'experience', 'drastically', 'different', 'more', 'suspenseful/violent', 'change', 'pace', 'second', 'half', 'rather', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'undeveloped', 'piece', 'writing', 'place', 'NOW', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'ventures', 'out', 'own', 'when', 'discovered', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'information', 'pertaining', 'secret', 'island', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'there', 'job', 'stop', 'entering', 'keeping', 'lookout', 'hilltop', 'see', 'farmers/islanders', 'gunmen', 'mention', 'only', 'allow', 'certain', 'amount', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'eventually', 'discovered', 'too', 'many', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'there', 'unbeknownst', 'islanders', 'prompting', 'change', 'inviting', 'ways', 'more', 'forceful', 'Get', 'here', 'NOW', 'shoot', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'sort', 'boring', 'too', 'odd', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'charge', 'private', 'people', 'living', 'island', 'relationship', 'segments', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'are', 'really', 'pointless', 'uninteresting', 'segment', 'Leonardo', 'turning', 'video', 'game', 'character', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'unusual', 'part', 'movie.Honestly', 'when', 'down', 'flaws', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'Beach', 'just', 'really', 'suffers', 'lack', 'interest', 'When', 'Leonardo', 'rest', 'pack', 'was', 'basically', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'really', 'change', 'how', 'feel', 'first', 'half', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'adventure', 'movie', 'below', 'average']",N/A

517692,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00003CWM2,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[0, 0]","""The Beach"" is essentially the story of a scrawny, spoiled brat named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) who joins a bunch of self-centered Western hippies on a hidden Thai island and comes to believe he's in paradise for all the wrong reasons. From the start Richard never really engages Thailand on its own terms and instead experiences that country strictly from the point of view of a vapid, sullen, consumer-oriented American youth. When he and his more attractive French friends, Francoise (Virginie ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) reach the island, they delight in their new found utopia. But Richard has the hots for Francoise and somehow persuades her to leave Etienne for him. Why the seemingly intelligent Francoise deserts her rugged, handsome, and very humane companion for some sullen, self-absorbed little brat is one of the film's enduring mysteries. However, in a deeply emotional sugar cane cutting scene, Etienne gives the couple his blessing and allows them to play vomiting turtle with a clear conscience.In what should be a romantic scene of nocturnal nookie in the sea, the babe and the brat wade out to star lit lagoon for some amphibious goo shooting. After a brief swim and a swirl, Virgie and Leo wrap their legs around each other and repeatedly redefine the term ""chicken of the sea"". Unfortunately, between the awkward motions and idiotic music, this scene just tries too hard to seem sensual, and as anyone with maritime experience knows, the calking gun can only squirt its glue into the seams of the ship when both are on the shore. It takes a willing suspension of one's disbelief to accept the fact that Leo has the right tool for the job let alone that it can plug leaks when soaked to the gill. There is also the disturbing element of the sharks, but we don't encounter them until later in the film. For some reason they don't show up at night to champ on Leo's love tentacle, but maybe the bait simply isn't big enough to attract them.But all is not well in paradise. For one thing, the island's British Matriarch takes Richard to the mainland to purchase supplies but really winds wrapping her love tunnel around his Ford Probe. When they return to the island she banishes him to some remote cliffs to keep a watch on some tourists who thanks to Richard's earlier blunder are on the verge of discovering the island. In the subsequent scenes of Richard's banishment, the film does an extremely poor imitation of ""Apocalypse Now"" and has him lose his mind as he begins to blend with the jungle. In several ridiculous scenes Richard plays practical jokes on Thai opium farmers but is somehow never caught and punished. Now let's think about this for a moment. These are armed, ruthless criminals, born and raised in this type of environment and thoroughly familiar with the terrain, yet they are constantly duped by a boy whose survival skills are limited to throwing a tantrum if his mother doesn't drive him to the mall to purchase some new sneakers. Sometimes I like to amuse myself by replaying those scenes in my mind and imaging what would really happen to him. Anyway, there is a climactic denouement paradise is destroyed but Richard comes out of it a better man; ya da ya da ya da, the end.If this film weren't so shallow I would almost suspect that it is a plug for Western civilization. For one thing the film only focuses on Westerners in Thailand, but never has its skeletal protagonist actually experience the country on its own terms. Rather than exploring Thai culture, and history not to mention the warmth and sincerity of the average Thai person, Richard hangs out with some Westerners in Thailand and then rejects them for other Westerners in Thailand. Ultimately this film is about a frail and shallow boy who acts like a jerk, gets a little roughed up and talks about it in his best caf&eacute; voice. Hmmm, maybe it isn't a plug for Western civilization.",2,Scrawny Individualism,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,3912,"['Beach', 'essentially', 'story', 'scrawny', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'named', 'Richard', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'bunch', 'self-centered', 'Western', 'hippies', 'hidden', 'Thai', 'island', 'believe', 'paradise', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'start', 'Richard', 'never', 'really', 'Thailand', 'own', 'terms', 'instead', 'experiences', 'country', 'strictly', 'point', 'view', 'vapid', 'sullen', 'consumer-oriented', 'American', 'youth', 'When', 'more', 'attractive', 'French', 'friends', 'Francoise', 'Virginie', 'ledoyen', 'Etienne', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'reach', 'island', 'delight', 'new', 'found', 'utopia', 'Richard', 'hots', 'Francoise', 'somehow', 'leave', 'Etienne', 'Why', 'seemingly', 'intelligent', 'Francoise', 'rugged', 'handsome', 'very', 'humane', 'companion', 'sullen', 'self-absorbed', 'little', 'brat', 'one', 'film', 'enduring', 'mysteries', 'However', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'sugar', 'cane', 'cutting', 'scene', 'Etienne', 'couple', 'blessing', 'play', 'vomiting', 'turtle', 'clear', 'conscience.In', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'romantic', 'scene', 'nocturnal', 'nookie', 'sea', 'babe', 'brat', 'wade', 'out', 'star', 'lit', 'lagoon', 'amphibious', 'goo', 'shooting', 'brief', 'swim', 'swirl', 'Virgie', 'Leo', 'wrap', 'legs', 'other', 'repeatedly', 'redefine', 'term', 'chicken', 'sea', 'Unfortunately', 'awkward', 'motions', 'idiotic', 'music', 'scene', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'seem', 'sensual', 'anyone', 'maritime', 'experience', 'knows', 'calking', 'gun', 'can', 'only', 'squirt', 'glue', 'seams', 'ship', 'when', 'are', 'shore', 'willing', 'suspension', 'one', 'disbelief', 'accept', 'fact', 'Leo', 'right', 'tool', 'job', 'let', 'alone', 'can', 'plug', 'leaks', 'when', 'soaked', 'gill', 'also', 'disturbing', 'element', 'sharks', 'do', ""n't"", 'encounter', 'later', 'film', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'night', 'champ', 'Leo', 'love', 'tentacle', 'maybe', 'bait', 'simply', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'attract', 'not', 'well', 'paradise', 'one', 'thing', 'island', 'British', 'Matriarch', 'Richard', 'mainland', 'purchase', 'supplies', 'really', 'wrapping', 'love', 'tunnel', 'Ford', 'Probe', 'When', 'return', 'island', 'remote', 'cliffs', 'keep', 'watch', 'tourists', 'who', 'thanks', 'Richard', 'earlier', 'blunder', 'are', 'verge', 'discovering', 'island', 'subsequent', 'scenes', 'Richard', 'banishment', 'film', 'extremely', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'lose', 'mind', 'blend', 'jungle', 'several', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'Richard', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Thai', 'opium', 'farmers', 'somehow', 'never', 'caught', 'punished', 'Now', 'let', 'think', 'moment', 'are', 'armed', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'born', 'raised', 'type', 'environment', 'thoroughly', 'familiar', 'terrain', 'yet', 'are', 'constantly', 'duped', 'boy', 'survival', 'skills', 'are', 'limited', 'throwing', 'tantrum', 'mother', ""n't"", 'drive', 'mall', 'purchase', 'new', 'sneakers', 'Sometimes', 'like', 'amuse', 'replaying', 'scenes', 'mind', 'imaging', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'happen', 'Anyway', 'climactic', 'denouement', 'paradise', 'destroyed', 'Richard', 'better', 'man', 'da', 'ya', 'da', 'ya', 'da', 'end.If', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'shallow', 'would', 'almost', 'suspect', 'plug', 'Western', 'civilization', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'only', 'Westerners', 'Thailand', 'never', 'skeletal', 'protagonist', 'actually', 'experience', 'country', 'own', 'terms', 'Rather', 'exploring', 'Thai', 'culture', 'history', 'not', 'mention', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'average', 'Thai', 'person', 'Richard', 'out', 'Westerners', 'Thailand', 'then', 'other', 'Westerners', 'Thailand', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'frail', 'shallow', 'boy', 'who', 'jerk', 'little', 'roughed', 'up', 'talks', 'best', 'caf', 'eacute', 'voice', 'Hmmm', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'plug', 'Western', 'civilization']",N/A

In his pursuit he encounters Etienne & Francoise (Guillaume Canet & Virginie Ledoyen), a young French couple who accompany him on his journey.  They do indeed find the beach and the do become integrated with the residents, a group of people who value their seclusion from society and require it stay that way.Of course, things go horribly wrong and the peaceful society they surround themselves in is in danger.  DiCaprio is well cast, as is Tilda Swinton who plays Sal the leader of the group.  The only problem is that these characters are never really explained, never really broken down and so they come across as incomplete.

Litton,"[1, 2]","&quot;The Beach&quot; is one of those movies that starts out good,  developes nicely, and then lets its audience down at the end, which does  not make for a very nice time at the movies. Leonardo DiCaprio returns in  yet another waterlogged role as Richard, an American vacationing in  Bangkok, feeling that life is running like clockwork and has no variety. At  his hotel, he meets up with a man named Daffy, who gives him a map to a  secret island and then kills himself the next day in his hotel room. The  story begins to dive deep when Richard asks his next door roommates, one  being the object of his affection played by Virginie Ledoyen, if they would  like to accompany him to the island, which is said to be very lush and one  of the most beautiful places on Earth. Before going out, DiCaprio dicloses  the location of the island to two new friends, and the next day, they set  out for the paradise. The story grows with intelligence when they arrive at  the island, and they discover that a community of less than 100 people  inhabit the island. Things move along smoothly in the film, but to go any  further from here would give away the ending. Let's just say that it  could've gone down three thousand different avenues, and of the choices it  had, the writers made a lousy decision. DiCaprio is terrific in his role,  even in the ending, and Ledoyen shines in her first onscreen role ever. The  film's location and sets are magnificent, and it is my opinion that the  filmmakers hoped that this would be enough to salvage the film from being a  flop. Don't get me wrong; the film has a lot of momentum, but the ending is  just not good enough to keep that momentum flowing.

When Richard starts going bananas, his video-game fantasy comes  alive in a totally nutters sequence that just makes you laugh, it's so over  the top.  And the moments of danger -- when two of the men are mauled and  bleeding on the beach, or Richard discovering the suicide victim, or when  the natives start hunting their &quot;guests&quot; down -- are rivoting and  intense.  Virginie Ledoyen's underwater embrace with DiCaprio is also  breathtaking, and Tilda Swinton gives a good performance as Sal, the  leader, despite being handed what is basically an unsympathetic  character.I don't love this movie, but I'd be lying to say it didn't  move me, at least at points.

517709,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00003CWM2,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[0, 0]","The Beach takes its theme from Lord of the Flies; that Man, far from being a &quot;noble savage&quot;, unfailingly reverts to his base nature even when placed in a seeming paradise far from the evils of the modern world.  And it takes a bit of its basic premise from that book also--relative youngsters marooned (this time through their own decision and not by fate) on a tropical paradise come through adversity almost to the point of self-destruction but are eventually saved.  And here, I think, is where the movie most lets the viewer down--in the necessity of an uplifting ending, the protagonist Richard's (played by DiCaprio) closing words demonstrate that he missed the point entirely.  I have to admit that those words do seem in keeping with Richards muddled mindset throughout--he's definitely more an irritating grain of sand with potential than a polished pearl!  But that the viewer is left with this pollyanna perception almost invalidates the whole thing.The other problem with The Beach is the occasional stylistic twist.  At one point Richard begins to hallucinate due to isolation, stress, lack of food, and probably odd chemicals in the caterpillars he snacks on.  We get several fantasy sequences, in the most extreme of which he envisions himself in a video game.  Certain viewers, myself included, will find this just too far removed from the grim reality of the story and inadvertently comical.  Others, undoubtedly, will find it bold directing.The other movie The Beach alludes to is Apocalypse Now, with DiCaprio compressing the roles of Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando into a single character--a man in search of himself who eventually becomes totally debased.  In The Beach, the horror is graphic--a fair amount of gore from which the camera doesn't always shy.  The special effects of shark bite wounds are astoundingly and grotesquely realistic.I've not read the novel upon which this movie was based, so I can't speak to its faithfulness.  But on its own the movie was certainly intriguing and worth viewing.  Surely some of the bad press the movie got was due to the critics' expectations being different than what the director and DiCaprio delivered.  Where some fans hoped for something similar to Titanic, Romeo and Juliet, and The Man in the Iron Mask, DiCaprio sought out The Beach to purposely distance himself from those roles.  The Beach may not be as innovative and unusual as What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but it is somewhat similar to The Basketball Diaries.  Fans of the romantic DiCaprio should probably give this one a miss, unless they really want to see those scenes in which he appears bare-chested.

If it was a bomb, then their rates go down ~ that is how it works.  With that in mind,The Beachhas the distinction of being Leo DiCaprio's first mega payday movie as it came on the heels of the blockbusterTitanic.Leo portrays Richard, a video game-playing American tourist who is traveling through Thailand.  While there, he encounters a strange fellow who has a map of what is supposedly a tropical paradise.  Taking the bait, Richard can't help but explore the island on the map.  He gets more than what he bargained for.Richard and 2 friends stumble upon something of a utopia with 1960s-esque values ~ a place where free-love is accepted & people can smoke weed whenever they like.  And, of course, the weed on this island is plentiful.  There is also a gorgeous saltwater lake (that's somehow connected to the ocean) with aqua-blue water whenever one wants to go swimming or fishing.  They have it made!  Just one problem:  they share the island with some drug producers / drug dealers who are rather territorial.  The drug dealers are aware of the small colony......but can their co-existence last?Ultimately, this movie is something of  a cross betweenWalden Two,Lord of the Flies Centenary EditionandRambo.

Though considerably different than the book, meaning that much of Garland's message (think ""Heart of Darkness"", ""The Lord of the Flies"", and ""Apocalypse Now"") is left out here in favor of a more ""sexy"" storyline, the alterations work on the screen.  The audience, unless they've read the book, won't know what they're missing and will take the movie for what it is; an intense, tantalizing thriller starring the perfectly cast (and perfectly gorgeous) Leonardo DiCaprio with a killer soundtrack and breathtaking cinematography.Though I have read the book and consider it to be amongst my favorites, I appreciated the film for what it was.  The themes so prevalent in the book regarding man's descent into insanity through isolation and what one will do to protect their utopia; are hinted at.

517714,A146D2LYLICNLS,B00003CWM2,eric_f,"[13, 18]","I just finished the novel by Alex Garland as well as seeing this movie adaptation, so I can state an educated opinion that this film falls short of capturing the story that the novel does. There are some minor changes that I can live with, for example, when Francoise jumps off the waterfall first (in the novel Richard jumps off first) and the ending of the movie (the novel's ending would have been too graphic for the movie).But what is NOT acceptable is the fact that director Danny Boyle follows the trend of typical Hollywood filmmaking and inserts a couple of unecessary sex scenes that don't move the plot in any way whatsoever. The first is with Richard and Francoise. Anyone who has read the novel knows that while they do flirt a little and have some sexual tension between them, they do not hook up. Having them hook up in this film only satisfies the obligatory love sub-plot, which ends up going nowhere. If Boyle at least made it contribute to the story then it might have been justified. But it doesn't. The second example is with Richard and Sal, when they go to the mainland for the Rice Run. Another excuse for a sex scene, which again adds nothing to the plot. Not only do Richard and Sal never have sex in the novel, but Richard goes on the Rice Run with Jed, a vital character who isn't even in this film. But even if we can overlook the absence of Jed, the characters of Francoise and Sal are compromised and cheapened, turning them into cheap sluts, whereas in the novel both are very dedicated to their partners.But having said all this negativity, this movie adaptation does have its merits. The set location couldn't have been more perfect. This is exactly how I imagined this beach would look like while reading the novel. And in all fairness, it does capture the general ""essence"" of the novel even if it takes so many liberties with it.All in all, ""The Beach"" is probably best enjoyed by those who have not read Alex Garland's book. And for those of you who have read the book and still enjoy this film, more power to you.

Even the yearning to escape society's problems leads us back to the  problems we each face within.  None of us is perfect, thus, in any social  setting, structure and forgiveness must play a balancing act.In this  film, that concept is portrayed...and that's it.  It goes no deeper.  It  splashes its pretentious hand in the shallows along the sparkling  shoreline, and fails to draw out anything deeper.The romantic notions  boil down to jealousy and momentary infatuation; the violent fantasies of  deCaprio soon become predicted nightmares; and the final showdown with the  utopian leader shows how truly fragile everyone's ideologies were in the  first place.DeCaprio's acting is fine, the photography gorgeous, and the  director takes an occasional foray into truly creative movie-making.

I saw it last night and I must say if nothing, Di Caprio's character in the film is worth watching the film for. There's a bit of craze, hesitation, stupidity, a lot of adventure quotient, hazes of undying spirit, fun and humor in his character. He looks forward to a dangerous situation and tries to adapt. There is no much moral message the film tries to send but it's very enjoyable and I didn't know when the 90 or so minute ended. There is a bit of a disconnect in the way the film chose to start in the beginning, the slightly masochistic postulates of certain characters but the overall character portrayal is rather fun.

While many moviegoers avoided this film because they  aren't big DiCaprio fans, the truth is that whether or not one loves him,  one of the main reason to see this film is because of DiCaprio. Whether one  is a Leonardo DiCaprio fan or not, DiCaprio and director Danny Boyle bring  the film based on the best-selling book to life with excellent  cinematography and astounding acting. This film alone proves DiCaprio isn't  just another pretty boy in Hollywood and actually is one of the most  talented young actors around today.  The film's cinematography is yet  another reason that makes the film so engaging. While the breathtaking  beach scenes are much more powerful on the big screen, the scenery still  engages viewers on the television and gives everyone hope that paradise  does exist. One scene though, in which DiCaprio becomes a video game  character fighting for survival in the woods, is even more brilliant and  realistic on the television though, since people usually play their  Nintendos and Sega Dreamcast Systems on a TV instead of the bigscreen .  While editing the film to a mere two hours was a wise decision on the  director's behalf while ""The Beach"" was in theaters, on TV people can pause  the film and come back to it without getting bored and drifting off. That  is why the DVD has an added advantage for people who missed it in the  theater, or even for ""Beach"" fans who are seeing it for a second time  around, by showing additional scenes that have never before been seen. The  DVD also features the alternate ending, a storyboard gallery, the All  Saints music video ""Pure Shores"" and the theatrical trailers.  A great  film like ""The Beach"" deserves a second chance, so go out and rent ""The  Beach"" today on DVD.

I had liked the book, I hadn't liked the scenario, but I find the film is a lot better than the scenario, and yet less strong and powerful than the book, even if you take into account some of the scenes that were cut off, including the ending. This film is a revisiting of The Lord of the Flies, but with adults of both sexes. It is even more pessimistic than The Lord of the Flies. Because there is no real reform possible, when they come back, for these adults that drop out from the world, though not quite completely and with the ever present possibility to go back in their minds. They recreate a society which, in spite of the freedom, of the pleasures, of the enjoyment, is far worse than our normal society. A boss comes up and here it is a woman, and this power structure is that of an absolute dictatorship, and the only element that can save such a situation is that the members oif the community can fly away, escape. These people become, or rather reveal that they are, cruel, vicious even, possessive as for their partners, exacting towards the other members of the community, jealous, easily irritable, cowards in many ways, vain too, and definitely not very d&eacute;dicated to help their mates and volunteer for a chore. They dream of it as if it were paradise, but it is not. It is some kind of rotting hole in the world where you can only ferment and eventually die, practically alone because you know you are dying because the others are just afraid of losing their enjoyment if they cared enough to really take care of you and take you back where you could get some help. They can let you die of gangrene to avoid awkward questions from a hospital's personnel. Frightening about the deep nature of the human being. Nothing to be proud of. And what's more in such a situation they become even more normative than in real society. You better behave according to the unwritten law of the community, or rather of the boss, if you don't want to be punished or put in situations that are plain torture.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,There is no going back except regressive,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2129,"['film', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'see', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'liked', 'book', 'had', ""n't"", 'liked', 'scenario', 'find', 'film', 'lot', 'better', 'scenario', 'yet', 'less', 'strong', 'powerful', 'book', 'even', 'take', 'account', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'including', 'ending', 'film', 'revisiting', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'adults', 'sexes', 'even', 'more', 'pessimistic', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'real', 'reform', 'possible', 'when', 'come', 'back', 'adults', 'drop', 'out', 'world', 'not', 'quite', 'completely', 'ever', 'present', 'possibility', 'go', 'back', 'minds', 'recreate', 'society', 'spite', 'freedom', 'pleasures', 'enjoyment', 'far', 'worse', 'normal', 'society', 'boss', 'up', 'here', 'woman', 'power', 'structure', 'absolute', 'dictatorship', 'only', 'element', 'can', 'save', 'such', 'situation', 'members', 'oif', 'community', 'can', 'fly', 'away', 'escape', 'people', 'become', 'rather', 'reveal', 'are', 'cruel', 'vicious', 'even', 'possessive', 'partners', 'exacting', 'other', 'members', 'community', 'jealous', 'easily', 'irritable', 'cowards', 'many', 'ways', 'vain', 'too', 'definitely', 'not', 'very', 'd', 'eacute', 'dicated', 'help', 'mates', 'volunteer', 'chore', 'dream', 'were', 'paradise', 'not', 'kind', 'rotting', 'hole', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'ferment', 'eventually', 'die', 'practically', 'alone', 'know', 'are', 'dying', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'afraid', 'losing', 'enjoyment', 'cared', 'enough', 'really', 'take', 'care', 'take', 'back', 'where', 'could', 'get', 'help', 'can', 'let', 'die', 'gangrene', 'avoid', 'awkward', 'questions', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'Frightening', 'deep', 'nature', 'human', 'being', 'Nothing', 'be', 'proud', 'what', 'more', 'such', 'situation', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'normative', 'real', 'society', 'better', 'behave', 'according', 'unwritten', 'law', 'community', 'rather', 'boss', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'punished', 'put', 'situations', 'are', 'plain', 'torture.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The thought of finding a remote island all to myself is that much more exciting and enticing.  There are, however, a few things with which I have problems.Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an American backpacker in Thailand living a laissez faire existence.  He just wants to have fun without the worries of every day life; he wants to explore and enjoy all that there is to offer.  In other words, he likes tourism but abhors tourists.  Even though he did make it to Bangkok, he didn't make it to Phucket; so, there's an easy joke missed.After receiving a map in one of the dirtiest hotel rooms ever, from a completely insane guy named Daffy, he links up with a French couple (Guillaume Canet and Virginie Ledoyen) to find the island.  They travel by all sorts of means until they finally see the island in the far off distance and decide to swim for it.  I was really hoping for a repeat of the Titanic, where Richard/Jack plummets to the bottom of the ocean, but I was disappointed.Once the trio inevitably makes it to the island, they meet up with a group of like-minded travelers who have set up an isolated community.  They sustain themselves by selling some of the copious amounts of illegal pharmaceuticals growing on the island.  The problem with this concept, however, is that there are armed Thai drug dealers on the island.  Why would they drug dealers allow the other community?  Why not just kill everyone and keep all the profits?Anyway, the trio fit easily into the island way of life, alongside their new family.  Every day is filled with sporting events, leisurely activities, and random upkeep of their little utopia.  The only real excitement came from sharks that randomly visited the beach for Swedish hor'dourves.  I believe my favorite line of the movie went something like: ""AHHHGHRRHRGGRRRAAHHH"", when the soundtrack took a 180 into eerieness, as a shark littered the water and beach with bloody shreds of flesh, and then flossed with a femur.In the end, there end up being too many visitors, the drug dealers have had enough of the outsiders, and the community must decide how far they'll go to protect their secret.",4,Shark 1 - Sweden 0,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,2238,"['really', 'liked', 'Beach', 'concept', 'travel', 'abroad', 'reservation', 'highly', 'appealing', 'thought', 'finding', 'remote', 'island', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'enticing', 'are', 'however', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'problems.Richard', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'American', 'backpacker', 'Thailand', 'living', 'laissez', 'faire', 'existence', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'worries', 'day', 'life', 'explore', 'enjoy', 'offer', 'other', 'words', 'tourism', 'abhors', 'tourists', 'Even', 'did', 'make', 'Bangkok', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Phucket', 'so', 'easy', 'joke', 'missed.After', 'receiving', 'map', 'one', 'dirtiest', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'ever', 'completely', 'insane', 'guy', 'named', 'Daffy', 'up', 'French', 'couple', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'Virginie', 'Ledoyen', 'find', 'island', 'travel', 'sorts', 'means', 'finally', 'see', 'island', 'far', 'distance', 'decide', 'swim', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'repeat', 'Titanic', 'where', 'Richard/Jack', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'was', 'disappointed.Once', 'trio', 'inevitably', 'island', 'meet', 'up', 'group', 'like-minded', 'travelers', 'who', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'isolated', 'community', 'sustain', 'selling', 'copious', 'amounts', 'illegal', 'pharmaceuticals', 'growing', 'island', 'problem', 'concept', 'however', 'are', 'armed', 'Thai', 'drug', 'dealers', 'island', 'Why', 'would', 'drug', 'dealers', 'allow', 'other', 'community', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'kill', 'everyone', 'keep', 'profits', 'Anyway', 'trio', 'fit', 'easily', 'island', 'way', 'life', 'alongside', 'new', 'family', 'day', 'filled', 'sporting', 'events', 'leisurely', 'activities', 'random', 'upkeep', 'little', 'utopia', 'only', 'real', 'excitement', 'came', 'sharks', 'randomly', 'visited', 'beach', 'Swedish', ""hor'dourves"", 'believe', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'went', 'something', 'AHHHGHRRHRGGRRRAAHHH', 'when', 'soundtrack', 'took', '180', 'eerieness', 'shark', 'littered', 'water', 'beach', 'bloody', 'shreds', 'flesh', 'then', 'flossed', 'femur.In', 'end', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'many', 'visitors', 'drug', 'dealers', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'outsiders', 'community', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'far', ""'ll"", 'go', 'protect', 'secret']",N/A

517735,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B00003CWM2,Jeff  Farrow,"[0, 0]","THE BEACH held my interest, DiCaprio was quite good & Tilda Swinton fascinating in her characterization of a dominant & conflicted leader of castaways on a little bit of Paradise.I'll attempt to make a few comments lacking plotline because that's more than covered on the main page & other reviews.The movie can be seen as a cautionary tale of pseudo-religious cults based on hedonism, rejecting society for a too-good-to-be-true a-social escapism fueled by a charismatic leader and/or drugs.In THE BEACH (a ""hidden"" Thai island) both elements are clearly featured. In an early scene the intrepid Eden seekers suddenly find themselves looking at acres & acres of growing ganga. I'm pretty sure it was the real thing because I found myself salivating at the very sight of it.In the middle of the film Tilda banishes DeCapio from the group for revealing a map leading to the mystic Highland. When he asks what he's supposed to do, she ominously replies, ""Get the map back."" From this point on DiCaprio is alone & appears to be descending into madness. This I felt was going way over the top & overblown. It wasn't Dicaprio's acting so much as the script. Fortunately it got on track--well, nore or less--as the whole scenario escalated into violence.In another banishment scene, the group can't take any more crying from a man dying of gangrene (they were too afraid to send him to a doctor least the location of their secret Paradise leak out.) Finally they remove him from the encampment and leave him out to die--much like certain groups used to ""expose"" unwanted babies.The idea is that no matter how ""perfect"" a Paradise appears, it won't remain that way for long once humans arrive on the scene--and, yes, other people have commented on the fact that THE BEACH is like an adult version of LORD OF THE FLIES.When the film ends, you're not entirely satisfied because for the exception of DeCaprio and to a lesser extent Swinton, the characterizations are too sketchy for any deep indentification or concern with what ultimately happens to them.This brings to mind lyrics from Joni Mitchell's AMELIA:""Where some have found their paradise,Others just come to harm...Amelia, it was just a false alarm.""",3,Parable of Paradise of the Lost,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2201,"['BEACH', 'held', 'interest', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'fascinating', 'characterization', 'dominant', 'conflicted', 'leader', 'castaways', 'little', 'bit', 'Paradise.I', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'lacking', 'plotline', 'more', 'covered', 'main', 'page', 'other', 'reviews.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'pseudo-religious', 'cults', 'based', 'hedonism', 'rejecting', 'society', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'a-social', 'escapism', 'fueled', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'and/or', 'drugs.In', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'hidden', 'Thai', 'island', 'elements', 'are', 'clearly', 'featured', 'early', 'scene', 'intrepid', 'Eden', 'seekers', 'suddenly', 'find', 'looking', 'acres', 'acres', 'growing', 'ganga', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'found', 'salivating', 'very', 'sight', 'it.In', 'middle', 'film', 'Tilda', 'banishes', 'DeCapio', 'group', 'revealing', 'map', 'leading', 'mystic', 'Highland', 'When', 'what', 'supposed', 'do', 'ominously', 'Get', 'map', 'back', 'point', 'DiCaprio', 'alone', 'be', 'descending', 'madness', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'way', 'top', 'overblown', 'was', ""n't"", 'Dicaprio', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'script', 'Fortunately', 'got', 'track', 'well', 'nore', 'less', 'whole', 'scenario', 'escalated', 'violence.In', 'banishment', 'scene', 'group', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'crying', 'man', 'dying', 'gangrene', 'were', 'too', 'afraid', 'send', 'doctor', 'location', 'secret', 'Paradise', 'leak', 'Finally', 'remove', 'encampment', 'leave', 'out', 'die', 'much', 'certain', 'groups', 'used', 'expose', 'unwanted', 'babies.The', 'idea', 'matter', 'how', 'perfect', 'Paradise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remain', 'way', 'long', 'once', 'humans', 'arrive', 'scene', 'yes', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'fact', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'adult', 'version', 'LORD', 'THE', 'FLIES.When', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'exception', 'DeCaprio', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Swinton', 'characterizations', 'are', 'too', 'sketchy', 'deep', 'indentification', 'concern', 'what', 'ultimately', 'them.This', 'brings', 'mind', 'lyrics', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'AMELIA', 'Where', 'have', 'found', 'paradise', 'Others', 'just', 'come', 'harm', 'Amelia', 'was', 'just', 'false', 'alarm']",N/A

It nearly accidentally killed Boyle and it severed his relationship with Ewan Mcgregor*check IMDB for more details. It's a great film for anyone familiar with Danny Boyle; a director who is not happy with giving backstories. This is more obvious in his zombie reinvention genre 28 days later where he puts you 28 days later, literally. Leaving you to pick up your survival knowledge as you tumble along with the proctagonist. Here, he starts things off with Daffy, a shady man who speaks of a mysterious beach isolated from the sea. We never understand why he was outcasted from the island, nor his circumstances. But that's Boyle's style. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Richard, an American who doesn't know metrics and is in permanent seek of the ultimate sensation. Boyle always has an electronic, synthesizer soundtrack. John Murphy more popularly. But in this film it is a mix of cover songs and a few original songs by numerous artists. None by John Murphy to my dissapointment. Tilda Swinton makes a surprising cameo as Sal. Sal is that demented advocate who believes in the community as a check or balance that is beyond necessary, mandated is more like it. We push forward into the reality of the beach and in the end we are TORN out of paradise. I suppose there is no other way to be expelled from paradise but to be forced out, torn out.

I was unimpressed. The same nasal drone like delivery, all his characters seemed like they were closely related to each other, all part of some extended family with lots of Leos.  Ofcourse I hesitated to see Titanic and when I did, I gave credit where it was deserved to James Cameron not Di Caprio. His Character was strong but not the actor. When &quot;The Beach&quot; came out I stayed away as much as I could till a boring weekend where I had to rent something I had not yet seen so my choice was either &quot;The Beach&quot; or &quot;Russian Renegades&quot;. a B movie. Naturally I opted for the Beach, let's see what happens. Well a few months later I am one of the most surprised of all moviegoers. Never did I think I would ever own a Leo movie till now. I ended up buying the DVD. This was a role he could do well because it fits with the alternative media image of him as a brat. And does he carry this movie! It grew on me like something magical, maybe it was the scenery or the clever direction of Danny Boyle or it was the story it self. Like a fantasy story of being alone on an island, this was so close to it and was done well. The first act of the film is interesting and the second act absolutely glimmers but the last half of the film was an absolute waste.I kept thinking of so many things that could have been done but weren't. The descent into madness by the main character was appreciated by me but it got lost somewhere. I guess he got a little too on the edge, that Robert Carlyle, he can do that to some people with his fiendish ways. I do recommend this movie for a viewing definitely, how it unfolds you go and see and make up your mind.

So following my rule of always reading the book before the film, i sat down to watch this. I found it difficult to beleive that they both were the same thing. Characters are given a sympathectic slant when in the book they were cold and caculating. There is an underlying love intrest which was only briefly refered to and the ending has been completely rewritten so that we have a nice Hollywood happy ending instead of the dramactic and sad ending as written. This is an absolute travesty from start to finish. The only actor that comes out of it well is Robert Carlisle physcopathic Scottish traveller. The biggest disaster (and that is all he ever seems capable of) is Leonard DiCaprio who's acting is so wooden it makes Hugh Grant's efforts seem almost Shakesperian. He is so totally unbelievable in the lead role. There is no depth to his acting and he spends so much time acting cool and blaise that i couldn't help but wonder with such a drastic rewrite, DiCaprio's early demise at the hands of the drug dealers would of been a welcome relief.

517753,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00003CWM2,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 3]","What's disappointing about The Beach isn't the cinematography, which is great, or the plot, which is okay, or the acting, which is good. It's the trailer. Have you seen this thing? It makes the movie out to be some fast-paced, thrill-a-minute, will they make it out alive fright-fest. And it is absolutely none of those things.The movie is about an American traveller named Richard. Played very well by Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard stumbles across a map that reveals the location of some perfect little island, a paradise, if you will, and being an impetuous and free-willed young man, Richard decides to go there, accompanied by a young French couple that he has only just met.On this island are two things: 1) enough marjuana to keep all of Ann Arbor busy for a few months, and 2) drug dealers. Barely escaping the drug dealers, our protagonists manage to find the other half of the island, which is populated by kind and reserved people who have decided to reject the outside world and create a perfect little society on this gorgeous island that virtually nobody else knows about.This community has a long-standing pact with the kind-hearted drug dealers. They co-exist in peace as long as they tell nobody else about the island. Everybody's happy.The plot doesn't have much going for it, other than it is a vehicle for some pretty heavy sociological/philosophical messages. But despite the scanty use of conflict in the film, the movie as a whole is fairly entertaining. Directed by Danny Boyle, The Beach has a lot of the same sort of stuff that can be found in Boyle's other works. It has the same gritty sound and speed as Trainspotting, but it also has the confusing and out-of-place weirdism of A Life Less Ordinary. In fact, even though I give this movie a cozy two thumbs up, there are three problems with it that may bother more discriminating viewers.1. A forced love story. Anyone who knows movies knows that all producers want some sort of love interest in their movie. It gets the attention of the female viewership. In many cases, this is pulled off without a hitch. In the case of The Beach, it is almost as if they made the entire movie and then, as a second-thought, realized they needed some kissin', and so they dumped in a horribly contrived and emotionally weak romance between Leo and the young French lady. 2. An unnecessary soul-quest, a la Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors. At some point, Leo goes crazy for fifteen or twenty minutes as he wanders about the jungle. This has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film. It's like a commercial for insanity. 3. The final moral of the movie is imparted by the kindhearted ring-leader of the drug dealers, who doesn't just vocalize the moral, but delivers it Solomon-style: with this obscure and insightful test of the hidden resort leader's faith. Although this is plausible in Danny Boyle's world, I doubt the drug dealer's would have imparted anything to the head-strong island citizens other than a volley of bullets. But, then again, I'm not an expert on drug dealers.",3,Good-Lookin' Gumbo,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,3057,"['What', 'disappointing', 'Beach', ""n't"", 'cinematography', 'great', 'plot', 'okay', 'acting', 'good', 'trailer', 'Have', 'seen', 'thing', 'movie', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'thrill-a-minute', 'will', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'fright-fest', 'absolutely', 'none', 'things.The', 'movie', 'American', 'traveller', 'named', 'Richard', 'Played', 'very', 'well', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Richard', 'map', 'location', 'perfect', 'little', 'island', 'paradise', 'will', 'being', 'impetuous', 'free-willed', 'young', 'man', 'Richard', 'go', 'there', 'accompanied', 'young', 'French', 'couple', 'only', 'just', 'met.On', 'island', 'are', 'two', 'things', '1', 'enough', 'marjuana', 'keep', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'busy', 'few', 'months', '2', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Barely', 'escaping', 'drug', 'dealers', 'protagonists', 'manage', 'find', 'other', 'half', 'island', 'populated', 'kind', 'reserved', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'reject', 'outside', 'world', 'create', 'perfect', 'little', 'society', 'gorgeous', 'island', 'virtually', 'nobody', 'else', 'about.This', 'community', 'long-standing', 'pact', 'kind-hearted', 'drug', 'dealers', 'co-exist', 'peace', 'as', 'long', 'tell', 'nobody', 'else', 'island', 'Everybody', 'happy.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'other', 'vehicle', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'sociological/philosophical', 'messages', 'scanty', 'use', 'conflict', 'film', 'movie', 'whole', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'Directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Beach', 'lot', 'same', 'sort', 'stuff', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Boyle', 'other', 'works', 'same', 'gritty', 'sound', 'speed', 'Trainspotting', 'also', 'confusing', 'out-of-place', 'weirdism', 'A', 'Life', 'Less', 'Ordinary', 'fact', 'even', 'give', 'movie', 'cozy', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'are', 'three', 'problems', 'may', 'bother', 'more', 'discriminating', 'viewers.1', 'forced', 'love', 'story', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'producers', 'want', 'sort', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'attention', 'female', 'viewership', 'many', 'cases', 'pulled', 'off', 'hitch', 'case', 'Beach', 'almost', 'made', 'entire', 'movie', 'then', 'second-thought', 'realized', 'needed', 'kissin', 'so', 'dumped', 'horribly', 'contrived', 'emotionally', 'weak', 'romance', 'Leo', 'young', 'French', 'lady', '2', 'unnecessary', 'soul-quest', 'la', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Doors', 'point', 'Leo', 'crazy', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'jungle', 'absolutely', 'bearing', 'rest', 'film', 'commercial', 'insanity', '3', 'final', 'moral', 'movie', 'imparted', 'kindhearted', 'ring-leader', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', ""n't"", 'just', 'vocalize', 'moral', 'delivers', 'Solomon-style', 'obscure', 'insightful', 'test', 'hidden', 'resort', 'leader', 'faith', 'plausible', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'world', 'doubt', 'drug', 'dealer', 'would', 'have', 'imparted', 'anything', 'head-strong', 'island', 'other', 'volley', 'bullets', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'drug', 'dealers']",N/A

The scenery is breathtaking and the premise of a bored American seeking utopia in Thailand is promising. However, all promises are broken when Leonard DiCaprio takes to the screen. The novel's character is a brash, bold, pot-smoking narcissist - DiCaprio is just a man-boy desperately trying to be tough. He just doesn't have what it takes to carry out this complex role and every potentially riveting scene falls flat. Tilda Swinton as the ruling matriarch of the commune does well with her flat, fierce control over the clan. Director Boyle injects a surreal 'game-boy' sequence which is simply silly and unneeded.

517756,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00003CWM2,Matthew Gladney,"[5, 7]","""The Beach"" is nearly devoid of any real worthwhile content, but visually it is a great film.Leonardo DiCaprio (the best actor under 40 working today) plays Richard, a bored American with adventure and excitement on his mind. While on holiday in Bangkok, Richard finds a map left by a strange man who has commited suicide (creepily portrayed by Robert Carlyle). The map shows how to get to a secret island. Richard decides to follow the map and see where fate takes him. Along for the ride are a French couple who have befriended Richard, Francoise and Etienne.Once the trio reaches the island, the movie quickly disintegrates into an odd, irritating, bewildering montage of strange people, conflicts, death, and danger. I won't give away anything for those who haven't seen it, not that it matters much. Needless to say, I wasn't much impressed with anything that happened.There are a few plusses to ""The Beach"", however, which warrant giving it 3 stars. It is, visually, a beautiful film. The dark and mysterious locations in Bangkok provide a nice mood in the first part of the movie. The soundtrack (which is worth getting just on its own) is extremely well incorporated into the film, providing a great background to the events transpiring on-screen. The beach locale is gorgeous. There are many shots of the water lapping-up onto the sand, and the sights beheld are exquisite. The cast is nice to look at, too. You may be bored, or even annoyed, by the story unfolding, but at least you'll have some beautiful people to watch. Virginie Ledoyen, who plays Francoise, is quite gorgeous. Leonardo DiCaprio is stunningly attractive as Richard. He is muscular, tan, and without his shirt for most of the film. If for no other reason, you can enjoy ""The Beach"" for this alone.I saw ""The Beach"" in 2000, when it was released in theaters. It was the first major Leonardo DiCaprio film since the Titanic phenomenon, and I was quite anxious to see what it had to offer. As stated earlier, the movie quickly disappointed. Do I recommend it? Not really. But would I suggest it if you were in the mood to watch an odd film which features a good usage of rock and chill-out music, beautiful scenery, and good looking actors?

517758,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CWM2,Matthew Horner,"[2, 5]","The Beach failed to entertain Leonardo DiCaprio's legion of teenaged girl fans in America and was quickly washed away at the boxoffice. It did much better overseas where audiences are less inclined to need all their heroes to drip with testosterone. In fact, it's a pretty fair adventure, although it changes the plot of the Alex Garland novel for some rather obvious and silly reasons. We'll get to that later.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Richard, a bright, alienated young America who is bumming around Southeast Asia. He's just one of thousands of mostly European backpackers who go to the region every year seeking the exotic and the pleasurable. In Bangkok, Thailand, he checks into a cheap hotel made out of plywood and plastic paneling. He becomes friendly with a French couple, Francoise and Etienne [Virginia Ledoyen and Guilbume Caret]. He also encounters an insane Scotsman called Daffy [Robert Carlyle] who babbles on about a beautiful island beach hidden away from the tourists. The next morning Richard goes out for breakfast, and when he returns there is a map to the island on his door. He checks on Daffy and discovers to his horror that the man has committed suicide. After dealing with the Thai police, he talks Francoise and Etienne into going with him to find the island. Eventually, they find it. The beach really exists and is breathtakingly beautiful. It is populated by a group of young dropouts who think they have found heaven. The rest of the island, though, is peopled with a native group that farms marijuana. They have allowed the settlers to remain, but patrol their own areas with automatic rifles, which they do not hesitate to use. This island is a false paradise. I think the main theme is that paradise on earth is not a place.The movie makes a jarring shift midway through. Much of the first half is like a TV travelog or something out of MTV's Road Rules episodes - beautiful people having a beautiful time. Then Richard begins to go mad. After that, it becomes a sort of Lord of the Flies meets Heart of Darkness for Generation X. It may be this abrupt turn that confused audiences. What is odd is that the movie offers no plausible explanation for Richard's behavior, even though a truly scary scene in the book gives him reason.Now, about those plot changes. I always understand when a movie cuts parts of a book because of running time or changes things because they wouldn't work on film. In this case, however, it's all about Leo D. Every major plot change seems calculated to convince everyone that the androgynous star is as straight as an arrow. Specifically, Richard woos Francoise away from Etienne early in the movie. In the book, he lusts after her, but is civilized enough to attempt not to act on it. In the movie he has a one night stand with the woman, Sal, who is the island's leader. In the novel they were very wary of each other. The idea never comes up. DiCaprio is one of our great actors, but like others, such as Edward Norton and Johnny Depp, he is one of a kind. He is not now nor ever will be nor ever should be a Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. I suspect some studio execs had a hand in these plot changes. In doing so, they did neither the actor nor the audience any favors. It's all part of the 'dumbing down' process, as though they felt most of us spend our time obsessing over what stars do when they are off work.",2,Teen heart throb beached!,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3381,"['Beach', 'failed', 'entertain', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'legion', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'fans', 'America', 'was', 'quickly', 'washed', 'away', 'boxoffice', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'overseas', 'where', 'audiences', 'are', 'less', 'inclined', 'need', 'heroes', 'drip', 'testosterone', 'fact', 'pretty', 'fair', 'adventure', 'plot', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'novel', 'rather', 'obvious', 'silly', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Richard', 'bright', 'alienated', 'young', 'America', 'who', 'bumming', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'just', 'one', 'thousands', 'mostly', 'European', 'backpackers', 'who', 'go', 'region', 'year', 'seeking', 'exotic', 'pleasurable', 'Bangkok', 'Thailand', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'made', 'plywood', 'plastic', 'paneling', 'friendly', 'French', 'couple', 'Francoise', 'Etienne', '[', 'Virginia', 'Ledoyen', 'Guilbume', 'Caret', ']', 'also', 'insane', 'Scotsman', 'called', 'Daffy', '[', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', ']', 'who', 'beautiful', 'island', 'beach', 'hidden', 'away', 'tourists', 'next', 'morning', 'Richard', 'out', 'breakfast', 'when', 'map', 'island', 'door', 'Daffy', 'discovers', 'horror', 'man', 'committed', 'suicide', 'dealing', 'Thai', 'police', 'Francoise', 'Etienne', 'going', 'find', 'island', 'Eventually', 'find', 'beach', 'really', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'populated', 'group', 'young', 'dropouts', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'found', 'heaven', 'rest', 'island', 'peopled', 'native', 'group', 'marijuana', 'have', 'allowed', 'settlers', 'remain', 'patrol', 'own', 'areas', 'automatic', 'rifles', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'use', 'island', 'false', 'paradise', 'think', 'main', 'theme', 'paradise', 'earth', 'not', 'place.The', 'movie', 'jarring', 'shift', 'midway', 'Much', 'first', 'half', 'TV', 'travelog', 'something', 'MTV', 'Road', 'Rules', 'beautiful', 'people', 'having', 'beautiful', 'time', 'Then', 'Richard', 'go', 'mad', 'sort', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'Generation', 'X', 'may', 'be', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'confused', 'audiences', 'What', 'odd', 'movie', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'Richard', 'behavior', 'even', 'truly', 'scary', 'scene', 'book', 'reason.Now', 'plot', 'changes', 'always', 'understand', 'when', 'movie', 'parts', 'book', 'running', 'time', 'changes', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'case', 'however', 'Leo', 'D.', 'Every', 'major', 'plot', 'change', 'calculated', 'convince', 'everyone', 'androgynous', 'star', 'as', 'straight', 'arrow', 'Specifically', 'Richard', 'woos', 'Francoise', 'away', 'Etienne', 'early', 'movie', 'book', 'civilized', 'enough', 'attempt', 'not', 'act', 'movie', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'woman', 'Sal', 'who', 'island', 'leader', 'novel', 'were', 'very', 'wary', 'other', 'idea', 'never', 'up', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'others', 'such', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'one', 'kind', 'not', 'now', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'suspect', 'studio', 'execs', 'had', 'hand', 'plot', 'changes', 'doing', 'so', 'did', 'actor', 'audience', 'favors', 'part', ""'dumbing"", 'down', 'process', 'felt', 'most', 'spend', 'time', 'obsessing', 'over', 'what', 'stars', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'work']",N/A
517759,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00003CWM2,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 0]","Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back packer traveling Thailand. A tourist that hates tourism. He loathes the fact that people travel to new places, to do exactly what they do at home. Live in a nice place, go to regular restaurants, and watch TV. When he finds a crummy run down hotel room, he's unexpectedly visited by a man, by the name of Daffy, that seems a tad crazy and is talking about an island that is the meaning of perfection. The island has a beach inside of it that is closed off, mainly, from the ocean. White sands, crystal clear waters, the peacefulness people say they'll make their 3rd Genie wish on, and all the weed a man can smoke for the rest of his life. Of course Richard doesn't completely believe him, but Daffy make him a map, and Richard decides to stop doing the normal thing, and to go and find this island. But who wants to die alone right? So he grabs a French couple that he said hi to earlier, and off they go to find the island. When they finally find the island, it's almost everything they dreamed of, with a twist. The island is inhabited with farmers that are very protective of their weed operation, but they allow a very small community of people to live by the secluded beach, so long as they don't tell people about the island. Richard and the two Frenchies are accepted into the community with the promise that they told no one where they were going. Life is good. Lounging, smoking, playing games, fishing, screwing, and the daily chores of island living. Until one day, when some other travelers decide to come to the island. Travelers that Richard forgot to tell the inhabitants that he gave a map too. The peaceful life is about to change.The Beach is a trip, no pun intended. What draws me to this movie is the fact that I love traveling, and I love tropical islands. To live this life would be almost perfect for me, sans the drug farmers. While some might say the story is lacking or that the movie is slow, well, what do you think beach life is? It's exactly that. I thought the story was great, up to a point. Close to the end, Richard is made to stay in one spot to watch the newcomers who haven't swam over to the island yet, because it was his fault they were there. Well while he is waiting, he begins to go a little crazy. Ok... maybe more than a little crazy. And this is where I think the movie begins to crash. Watching him run down a path like a video game with 3 lives and a score board was just... so out of place it just totally takes me out of the movie. While some parts of it were good (like when he sneaks into the farmers sleeping area), most of it was just really dumb. But then the movie picks back up when the newcomers are welcomed with a hail of gunfire and the older inhabitants are now threatened.Definitely a cool movie. Give it a rent though if you are thinking about watching it, because I don't think it's for everyone. I like it a lot though.P.S. - Man I love traveling alone like the character Richard. It's crazy the amount of new people you can meet when you have no one else to talk to. I met a lot of new people when I went to Jordan to visit the Dead Sea.

However, The Beach was surprisingly good, although not faultless, it is a film that is interesting and ripe for discussion.Leonardo DiCaprio puts on one of his best performances since he played Jim Carrol in The Basketball Diaries, here he takes the role of Richard, an American backpacker in search of paradise. When he is staying at a hotel in Hong Kong, Richard meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who tells him of a secret beach in Thailand. Richard is convinced this is the place he has been looking for, and Daffy gives him a copy of the map that leads to the beach. However, Daffy commits suicide the next day, so Richard must find some other keen travellers. That is when he meets the beautiful Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend, Etienne (Guillame Canet). They are intrigued at the idea of a secret beach, and they join him immediately. Richard, Francoise and Etienne go to great lengths to get to the beach, and when they get there, they realise the beach has some chilling, brilliant and even deadly secrets of its own.Based on the best-selling novel written by Alex Garland, The Beach is an electrifying journey through paradise. Unfortunately, it was bombed by many critics who believe it to be pointless trash.

I thought that the beautiful scenery was wasted by a movie with a thin plot line.  However, I decided to give this movie another shot when it aired on HBO.  Boy, am I glad I did...not only did I end up taping it on a subsequent viewing, but I have watched it a total of six times now and have ordered a copy for my DVD player.I will not go into any detail regarding the storyline, as many other reviewers have already done that.  What I will say is that the movie is an engrossing masterpiece.  Not only does DiCaprio give an impressive performance as a lying, cheating, twenty something year-old, you actually like his character because he IS human.  His character (Richard) is one that strives for adventures in the search of personal pleasure, and pays the consequences for some of his indiscretions.What you learn from this movie is that nothing is ever perfect, and humans least of all...  This movie, like Fight Club, condemns our behavior in many ways.  The scene where Richard and Sal go from the beach (paradise) to the mainland to get supplies reminded me of what it's like walking around New York.  It's a horrible mess...way too many people.  Richard had been looking forward to re-joining society, but the minute he stepped foot on the mainland, all he wanted to do was leave again.  However, despite all of the innate flaws that we as humans have, we have many other redeeming qualities that are also captured on this film.  Love, a sense of adventure, friendship, and courage are just some of the human qualities that are highlighted brilliantly by this film.  Life is beautiful and ugly, and everything in between.  This film captures all of it...The voice-over narration by DiCaprio (Richard) is a real key to this movie...it really helps you to understand his character's thoughts and feelings.  Without it, the movie would be far less gripping.Many complaints were made about the last third of the movie, in which Richard goes temporarily insane.  I agree that that part should have been developed more...this is one case where an extra half-hour of development would've helped the movie tremendously.  It does suffer from a sort of schizophrenic complex, but I guess that's the point.

But, in the wake of the phenomenal success of Titanic, all eyes were locked on Leonardo DiCaprio. And the prognosiswas not good. After offers (notably American Psycho), the cherubic 24-year-old settled on The Beach, a mainly British production adapted from the novel by Alex Garland and produced by the team that bought of Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. First of all, Ewan McGregor - disappointed that he was passed over for the lead - grumbled that, in the interests of commercialism, the central character had been changed from a Brit to a Yank. Then came the environmental horror stories. Apparently, the production had transformed a Thai paradise into a self-serving film set, uprooting rare grasses, bulldozing sand dunes and planting no less than 60 palm trees. However, according to producer Andrew Macdonald, he not only paid Thailand's Forestry Commission $66,000 for permission to shoot there, but three tons of rubbish was removed from the site and, at considerable cost, the beach was returned to it's former glory.In the interests of the story, the idyllic setting had to be just right. For The Beach is a powerful polemic on the precarious politics of paradise. Dissatisfied with the numbing mediocrity of his life, Richard (DiCaprio), a young American backpacker, goes in search of new experience. Arriving in Bangkok, he turns his back on the comforts of home in favour of a run-down hostel and an opportunity to sample such local delicacies as snake's blood. Then, during a surreal encounter with drug-addled Scotsman Daffy (Robert Carlyle), he learns of a secret paradise hidden by vertiginous cliffs and geographic isolation. Accompanied by a young French couple, our hero finds his island and, in turn, his true vocation - the pure pursuit of pleasure.Of course, this been a Danny Boyle film, Richard's nirvana is not all that he had it would be. But then the very nature of Utopia is a figment of imagination, is it not?Boasting superlative production values and a terrific script by John Hodge, The Beach is a gripping contemplation of the nature of our world and ourselves - and how we view both. DiCaprio, himself, already looking older than he did in Titanic, invests the part of Richard with gusto. He is electrifying, and is well supported by a largely unknown cast. And Angelo Badalamenti's evocative, electronic score is another major plus.",4,The cost of Paradise.,973296000,"11 4, 2000",2000,2459,"['Few', 'films', 'are', 'afforded', 'such', 'negative', 'publicity', 'production', 'wake', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'Titanic', 'eyes', 'were', 'locked', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'prognosiswas', 'not', 'good', 'offers', 'notably', 'American', 'Psycho', 'cherubic', '24-year-old', 'settled', 'Beach', 'mainly', 'British', 'production', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'produced', 'team', 'bought', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'Trainspotting', 'A', 'Life', 'Less', 'Ordinary', 'First', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'disappointed', 'was', 'passed', 'lead', 'grumbled', 'interests', 'commercialism', 'central', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'Brit', 'Yank', 'Then', 'came', 'environmental', 'horror', 'stories', 'Apparently', 'production', 'had', 'transformed', 'Thai', 'paradise', 'self-serving', 'film', 'set', 'uprooting', 'rare', 'grasses', 'bulldozing', 'sand', 'dunes', 'planting', 'no', 'less', '60', 'palm', 'trees', 'However', 'according', 'producer', 'Andrew', 'Macdonald', 'not', 'only', 'paid', 'Thailand', 'Forestry', 'Commission', '66,000', 'permission', 'shoot', 'there', 'three', 'tons', 'rubbish', 'was', 'removed', 'site', 'considerable', 'cost', 'beach', 'was', 'returned', 'former', 'glory.In', 'interests', 'story', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'had', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'Beach', 'powerful', 'polemic', 'precarious', 'politics', 'paradise', 'Dissatisfied', 'numbing', 'mediocrity', 'life', 'Richard', 'DiCaprio', 'young', 'American', 'backpacker', 'search', 'new', 'experience', 'Arriving', 'Bangkok', 'back', 'comforts', 'home', 'favour', 'run-down', 'hostel', 'opportunity', 'sample', 'such', 'local', 'delicacies', 'snake', 'blood', 'Then', 'surreal', 'encounter', 'drug-addled', 'Scotsman', 'Daffy', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'secret', 'paradise', 'hidden', 'vertiginous', 'cliffs', 'geographic', 'isolation', 'Accompanied', 'young', 'French', 'couple', 'hero', 'island', 'turn', 'true', 'vocation', 'pure', 'pursuit', 'pleasure.Of', 'course', 'been', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'film', 'Richard', 'nirvana', 'not', 'had', 'would', 'be', 'then', 'very', 'nature', 'Utopia', 'figment', 'imagination', 'not', 'Boasting', 'superlative', 'production', 'values', 'terrific', 'script', 'John', 'Hodge', 'Beach', 'gripping', 'contemplation', 'nature', 'world', 'how', 'view', 'DiCaprio', 'already', 'looking', 'older', 'did', 'Titanic', 'part', 'Richard', 'gusto', 'electrifying', 'well', 'supported', 'largely', 'unknown', 'cast', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'evocative', 'electronic', 'score', 'major', 'plus']",N/A

Director Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting', `Shallow Grave', `A Life Less Ordinary') just about manages it.  There are, of course, several bad points, but the good points do outweigh them.  The story is about Richard and two fellow travellers who manage to make their way to a sort of paradise for the backpacker, an island community on a perfect beach.  And there the stage is set for our characters to realise that paradise isn't all it's cracked up to be.Probably the thing that no-one will forgive is the casting of Leonardo diCaprio in the main role of Richard.  Impressive as diCaprio was in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?', he seems a little stuck here.  After all, the book is at least partly about the English obsession with travelling and casting someone that wasn't English was never going to help.  However, diCaprio does somehow manage to come out of this relatively unscathed.  Despite the bad casting, he makes a fair job of the role.  Although he may not be so good early on, he's excellent when he is driven insane, shouting, hiding and screaming alone in the woods.  Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet are perfect though, every bit the Franoise and Etienne as you imagine them in the book.  Tilda Swinton as Sal is also quite intimidating, even if her character isn't really fleshed out well.  Neither, for that matter, is Bugs - Sal's possessive boyfriend.  Plus there's the exclusion of Jed, arguably one of the most important characters in the book.  However, this exclusion was understandable in the face of a movie that was aimed mostly at teenage fans of diCaprio.Perhaps most disappointing though, is Richard's insanity, which is suddenly thrust upon the audience from nowhere.  Although once Richard is mad it makes for compelling viewing, there's always that niggling feeling of why did he become mad, which is never explained properly in the movie.Even so, the whole thing is brilliantly seductive, with spotless beaches and an even more spotless cast.  The movie achieves one goal if nothing else: the audience really feels like paradise is being laid out in front of them.  It's sublime and the whole thing is visually perfect.  The ending was another matter though.  Wisely steering clear of the book's ending, as the characters weren't nearly as three-dimensional enough in the movie for it to work, it instead has an actually quite riveting last scene on the beach.  Unfortunately, there's a distinctly upbeat ending, which seems to have been tagged on for the benefit of a younger audience.  At the end of the day, it's a great movie, but the book is so much better.",4,Flawed but fantastic,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2671,"['Adapting', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'popular', 'novel', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'tough', 'job', 'Director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Trainspotting', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'Life', 'Less', 'Ordinary', 'just', 'manages', 'are', 'course', 'several', 'bad', 'points', 'good', 'points', 'do', 'outweigh', 'story', 'Richard', 'two', 'fellow', 'travellers', 'who', 'manage', 'make', 'way', 'sort', 'paradise', 'backpacker', 'island', 'community', 'perfect', 'beach', 'stage', 'set', 'characters', 'realise', 'paradise', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be.Probably', 'thing', 'no-one', 'will', 'forgive', 'casting', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'main', 'role', 'Richard', 'Impressive', 'diCaprio', 'was', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'little', 'stuck', 'here', 'book', 'least', 'partly', 'English', 'obsession', 'travelling', 'casting', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'English', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'help', 'However', 'diCaprio', 'somehow', 'manage', 'come', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'bad', 'casting', 'fair', 'job', 'role', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'early', 'excellent', 'when', 'driven', 'insane', 'shouting', 'hiding', 'screaming', 'alone', 'woods', 'Virginie', 'Ledoyen', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'are', 'perfect', 'bit', 'Franoise', 'Etienne', 'imagine', 'book', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Sal', 'also', 'quite', 'intimidating', 'even', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'well', 'matter', 'Bugs', 'Sal', 'possessive', 'boyfriend', 'exclusion', 'Jed', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'book', 'However', 'exclusion', 'was', 'understandable', 'face', 'movie', 'was', 'aimed', 'mostly', 'teenage', 'fans', 'diCaprio.Perhaps', 'most', 'disappointing', 'though', 'Richard', 'insanity', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'audience', 'nowhere', 'once', 'Richard', 'mad', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'always', 'niggling', 'feeling', 'why', 'did', 'become', 'mad', 'never', 'explained', 'properly', 'movie.Even', 'so', 'whole', 'thing', 'brilliantly', 'seductive', 'spotless', 'beaches', 'even', 'more', 'spotless', 'cast', 'movie', 'one', 'goal', 'nothing', 'else', 'audience', 'really', 'paradise', 'being', 'laid', 'out', 'front', 'sublime', 'whole', 'thing', 'visually', 'perfect', 'ending', 'was', 'matter', 'Wisely', 'steering', 'clear', 'book', 'ending', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'three-dimensional', 'enough', 'movie', 'work', 'instead', 'actually', 'quite', 'riveting', 'last', 'scene', 'beach', 'Unfortunately', 'distinctly', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'have', 'been', 'tagged', 'benefit', 'younger', 'audience', 'end', 'day', 'great', 'movie', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

But truth is the screenplay is bad (not diCaprio's fault) and the result is a bad film.The story starts interesting, but it turns more and more stupid as the film progresses.

With apparent homage to the classic fairy taleHansel and Gretel, the young people are greeted, upon reaching an expansive field of marijuana, by farmers whose livelihoods are at stake and who are not in a good mood to see the new tourists; strangely, Richard himself, after living in the idyllic commune for some time, abhors the sight of civilization on the shopping trip to the mainland.Be that as it may, he has learned--vis-a-vis the seemingly endless list of shopping requests from fellow communards, that the city is sometimes a necessary evil. The pristine Thai wonderland community that Richard (Leonardo diCaprio) and French fellow travelers Franoise (Virginie LeDoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) discover is flawed by misguided, increasingly dehumanized leadership in the form of Sal (impeccably portrayed by Tilda Swinton). Sal's confrontation with the farmers is strong; one begins to witness the absurdity of boundaries and nearly mourn for lost, wasted possibilities for sharing the world and its resources. Yet we also sympathize on some level with those who were here first and cannot help but wonder at the growers' plight as well as that of the young ""tourists.""There are echoes ofApocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier - Three-Disc Limited Edition (Contains Rare Bonus Disc From Circuit City!)(Francis Ford Coppola, 1978), as Richard begins to go somewhat insane after Sal orders him to ""turn back"" the new arrivals--young people, Europeans and Americans like themselves, on an adventure hunt with the copied map left by Richard.Richard becomes a leader himself after these experiences on the beach, but the genius of director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge (the same incredible team that created Trainspotting) conveys the notion that true heroism sometimes involves the opposite of leaping bravely into the unknown. Franoise's photograph survives, and becomes artifact.It passes into the historical consciousness of the film's heroes. In the final analysis, the Community is neither all evil nor a flawless paradise. It is, rather, a human experience that at moment of Richard's life is met bravely and with idealism, savored, confronted, left behind and finally, cherished.Note: The film includes an incredibly astute cameo performance by Robert Carlyle (ofTrainspottingfame).",5,"High diving, Dreams and Demons in the Land Beyond",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,2833,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'masterpiece', 'young', 'wanderer', 'Community', 'once', 'found', 'so', 'enthralling', 'unique', 'survives', 'artifact', 'even', 'not', 'tangible', 'living', 'entity', 'itself.The', 'Beach', 'classic', 'road', 'film', 'instead', 'shoe-leather', 'inThe', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '70th', 'Anniversary', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'horses', 'bikes', 'Easy', 'Rider', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'cars', 'mode', 'travel', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'paddle', 'boat', 'high-diving', 'jumping', 'swimming', 'lovely', 'wilderness', 'Thailand', 'apparent', 'homage', 'classic', 'fairy', 'taleHansel', 'Gretel', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'greeted', 'reaching', 'expansive', 'field', 'marijuana', 'farmers', 'livelihoods', 'are', 'stake', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'mood', 'see', 'new', 'tourists', 'strangely', 'Richard', 'living', 'idyllic', 'commune', 'time', 'abhors', 'sight', 'civilization', 'shopping', 'trip', 'mainland.Be', 'may', 'learned', 'vis-a-vis', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'list', 'shopping', 'requests', 'fellow', 'communards', 'city', 'sometimes', 'necessary', 'evil', 'pristine', 'Thai', 'wonderland', 'community', 'Richard', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'French', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'Franoise', 'Virginie', 'LeDoyen', 'Etienne', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'discover', 'flawed', 'misguided', 'increasingly', 'dehumanized', 'leadership', 'form', 'Sal', 'impeccably', 'portrayed', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Sal', 'confrontation', 'farmers', 'strong', 'one', 'witness', 'absurdity', 'boundaries', 'nearly', 'mourn', 'lost', 'wasted', 'possibilities', 'sharing', 'world', 'resources', 'also', 'sympathize', 'level', 'who', 'were', 'here', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'growers', 'plight', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'tourists', 'are', 'echoes', 'ofApocalypse', 'Now', 'Complete', 'Dossier', 'Three-Disc', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Contains', 'Rare', 'Bonus', 'Disc', 'From', 'Circuit', 'City', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', '1978', 'Richard', 'go', 'somewhat', 'insane', 'Sal', 'orders', 'turn', 'back', 'new', 'arrivals', 'young', 'people', 'Europeans', 'Americans', 'like', 'adventure', 'hunt', 'copied', 'map', 'left', 'Richard.Richard', 'leader', 'experiences', 'beach', 'genius', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Hodge', 'same', 'incredible', 'team', 'created', 'Trainspotting', 'conveys', 'notion', 'true', 'heroism', 'sometimes', 'opposite', 'leaping', 'bravely', 'unknown', 'Franoise', 'photograph', 'artifact.It', 'passes', 'historical', 'consciousness', 'film', 'heroes', 'final', 'analysis', 'Community', 'evil', 'flawless', 'paradise', 'rather', 'human', 'experience', 'moment', 'Richard', 'life', 'met', 'bravely', 'idealism', 'savored', 'confronted', 'left', 'behind', 'finally', 'cherished.Note', 'film', 'incredibly', 'astute', 'cameo', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'ofTrainspottingfame']",N/A

Upon a second viewing, I found it much less so, although still an above-average film.  A lengthy portion of the flick involves DiCapprio's devolution into something between Captain Willard from Apocalypse Now and William Peter Blattey's character, Killer Kane, in The Ninth Configuration.  This would be okay if it actually led to something in the script, but it doesn't, which was disappointing.  As a viewer you want DiCapprio to rise above the weird, adult adaptation of Lord of the Flies.  Inexplicably, he returns to his former self and focuses on escape, which is short-lived.  The movie does do one thing well by depicting how the troublesome aspects of the beach community's imaginary Utopian lives are dependent upon removing any aspects that detract from their childish heavenly existence.  Another good thing is that DiCapprio actually plays a character who is age appropriate.  My guess is the film endeavors to show the impossibility of living outside reality, regardless of the idyllic setting and the freedoms experienced by the naive beach community.  I sense that the film had the potential to be something of a modern-day classic, but lacked a cohesive vision.

517787,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CWM2,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Is this merely ""Survivor"" without the million-dollar payoff?  Or is it a modern vision of James Hilton's most famous novel?  For those too young to have any memories of ""Lost Horizon,"" ""The Beach"" may seem like a wildly new and original work.  And, as this is, essentially, a narcissistic youth fantasy starring teen-idol Leonardo Di Caprio, chances are that most of the film's audience will indeed be hovering somewhere near the puberty mark.  Since the cast of characters is so youthful to begin with, the film is able to dispense with - or, at the most, treat obliquely - one of the major themes that runs through ""Lost Horizon,"" that of the universal lure of Eternal Youth.Di Caprio stars as Richard, a young man so bored with the mundane rituals of modern civilized life that he journeys alone to Bangkok to partake of the exotic experiences a more primitive life has to offer.  While there, he encounters a seeming madman who, right before his suicide, draws a map for Richard revealing the whereabouts of a small tropical island, guaranteed to be a Shangri-la for any person clever and daring enough to get there.  Recruiting two of his hotel neighbors - a young French couple - to accompany him, Richard sets out to find his own private place in the sun.  But life is never quite that simple and the three soon discover that the island is already inhabited by other jaded tourists who have set up a carefree, thriving community far away from both the amenities and problems of the modern world.This concept of discovering a secret, pristine and uncorrupted paradise has a timeless appeal and pull.  And, as long as ""The Beach"" hews closely to this theme, it remains a reasonably interesting film, for who cannot identify at least partially with the lure of this idea?  The tricky part for the filmmakers tackling this theme is to make this unlikely situation seem real and believable.  Unfortunately, in the case of ""The Beach,"" the people who comprise this out-of-the-way community seem, for the most part, way too agreeable and cooperative.  This is like a Club Med resort without the room service.  Survival here doesn't seem like much of a struggle and there rarely ever seems to be much in the way of intense disagreements and arguments amongst the group's members.  We wonder, for instance, why, without monetary compensation or incentives of any kind for that matter, one man does all the cooking while another man does all the building.  As far as we can tell, they do virtually all the work on the island while the others frolic on the beach playing volleyball all day.  ""Lost Horizon"" was a certified fantasy - ""The Beach"" aspires to realism yet it needs a bit more grit to really achieve the truth it is after.  Yes, grim reality does occasionally poke its ugly head into this insulated world from time to time in the form of man-eating sharks and gun-toting pot harvesters - but the characters themselves lack psychological depth and clarity.  With rare exceptions, the people on the island seem to exist in a state of unlikely harmony, exhibiting little or none of the human conflict, personal jealousy or power politics one would reasonably expect to find in such a situation.  Then when, late in the game, the film develops grand illusions of becoming a meaningful and grim look into the dark heart of madness, ""The Beach"" becomes both pretentious and laughable.

The entertainment value of a film sometimes hinges on its travel outside the normal realm of societal norms. The Beach has just the right amount of reality, combined with the abstract 'dream-come-true' situation and all that comes with it. The Beach focuses uniquely on the youthful psyche of one man, whose search for adventure outside the 'norm' leads him to what appears to be paradise. But, as in reality, nothing dreamlike is perfect and without its price. This is very well portrayed in The Beach. I do see its similarity with Lord of the Flies, but The Beach burrows more deeply into a young man's mind who chose his path instead of being thrust into it involuntarily.Like The Beach, the classic 70s film Papillon travels a bit outside conventional methods for telling a story to relay emotion that engages the viewer and entertains. Those who have seen this film will note that Steve McQueen's memorable vision-of-death sequence climbs outside the box, but is entirely fitting and appropriate to the movie's successful progression. That movie is a classic, despite its unusual plot execution.Therefore, I'm open to a fantastical film with its foundations in reality.

On the good side of things it has wonderful imagery, a relatively interesting, if not a tad shallow, protagonist, and a fairly original storyline, but it's more the execution that leaves much to be desired. I actually liked the contrast between the tropical paradise setting and dark and disturbing elements of the film, but what I did not like was how the story progressed and how it was at times downright bleak and depressing, focusing intensely on the darker side of human nature and society, particularly modern society. It basically focuses on how in today's world the notion of innocence and paradise is becoming less and less prevalent every decade. There are no more unknown cultures and societies, and the world we live in is increasingly connected and globalized, with little to no hope for an escape like in the olden days when the Europeans traveled to the Americas, hoping to escape their miserable lives in their homelands.The main protagonist of this film, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, finally finds that escape, but at what cost?

After seeing the movie based on the film, I'm afraid that I proved my pal wrong.  The essential silliness of the story is laid bare by the celluloid.  As is the unlikeableness of the characters, especially Richard.  As is the purploid prose, captured for those who didn't read the book by Leonardo DiCaprio's narration.  The fact that the novel received all sorts of critical acclaim only illustrates the current literary intelligentsia's penchant for knee-jerk postmodernism -- and interesting characters, to say nothing of logical narrative, be damned.I give the movie two stars because it's pretty to look at, and the actress who played Sal  (don't know her name)  turned in a fine performance, adding complexity to pretty thin role.  Thankfully, Virginie Ledoyen, who is a model in real life I think, merely has to be beautiful and is not really required to act, the script giving her virtually nothing to say.  Robert Carlisle, unfortunately, is in his Overacting Mode.  And poor Leo . . . hey, it's really not his fault, here.  What can he do with a role in which he's asked to change gears every ten minutes in the film?  Near the end, the writers have him going absolutely bonkers for no good reason.  Sal asks him to spend his days on top of a ridge, keeping his eyes peeled on unwanted new guests who have just found the beach.  For some reason, this command sends our hero careening into some heart of GenX darkness, where Life becomes a sort of apocalyptic video game.  If this isn't laughable enough, he finally ends up wearing a bandana, &quot;acting out&quot;  as the psychiatrists might say, hissing at people and such.  The writers seem to think this equates Richard with Colonel Kurtz.  Oh dear.And as for the Beach itself . . . the film fails to prove its case, namely that it's a paradise worth all the trouble of finding.  My idea of Paradise, let me vehemently state, is not hanging out with a bunch of Euros on a deserted beach, playing cricket while stoned on pot, with no air conditioning, no toothbrushes, and an occasional run for rice on the mainland.  I mean, is this anybody's paradise?  I could also have done without the cheap Thoreau philosophy, as cribbed from Cliff's Notes, i.e., when Richard makes a brief return to the mainland and is traumatized by all the people and the noise:  &quot;They're parasites, cancers, eating the entire world&quot; . . . oh pleeeze.

If I had paid for this film, I would have asked for my money back.The cinematography is stunning and the scenery is vivid and breath-taking.  The  acting is superb but the entire concept of the movie is  perposterous.Lusting teens (perhaps early 20s instead of late teens, but  you can't really tell) sow their wild oats in Thailand in the hopes of  finding a secret island flowing with free love and marijuana. No, I'm not  joking... that's the plot.The goal of this movie seems to be to preach a  that a lack of morals has few consequences.  The film seemed to me to be  targeted to a teen audience.  Leonardo DiCaprio is a big teen box-office  grab. The problem is that this is not a film suitable for anyone under  18... and then again, it's just not  suitable, period.  An extremely  graphic sex scene shows everything but actual penetration and lasts way too  long - this is definitely not something I'd want my kids to see. A twisted  Amish-like society lives on the island, blissfully free of the trappings of  machines, electricity, toilets or hot-running water... a society living and  working in harmony even though they're constantly stoned.  Callous,  self-centered characters through-out the film are truly repulsive and yet  do not suffer any ill consequences... just bed-hopping and doobie-smoking  for all.I am not a prude, I just enjoy a good film and this didn't fit  the bill. DiCaprio has already proved himself a talented actor in films  such as &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; and Tilda Swinton (famous  for the lead role in &quot;Orlando&quot;) also delivers a jaw-dropping  performance.... what a shame that such talent had to go into such a piece  of garbage.

I rented it because I'm taking a vacation to the area where the film was shot. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The book does make a better script as I suspected. I was really surprised by DiCaprio's acting. Previously I thought of him as just another pretty boy actor, but he plays the slightly sinister Richard very well. The soundtrack is very good. Good enough that I got the CD. The film does have major plot changes from the book, but for the better in my opinion. I won't belabor the film and will mainly discuss the DVD features. The deleted scenes are mostly extended scenes already in the film. They give a little more background into the characters. The alternative ending I thought was better. It made the ending much darker and pessimistic than the original ending. The music video is okay artistic-wise. The song is a very catchy tune. It sounds like something that would be on a Madonna CD. Many trailers, spots, and photos are included but once again not much worth more than a single viewing. The commentary is very, very good as well as funny. The director of `Trainspotting' gives hilarious insights to making the film such as Leo's shorts were filled with lead weights during the underwater love scene so he didn't float. That is just one of the many witty insights the director gives.

With the assistance of a mysterious map, typical teen hedonist Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and two French pals find their way to a secret island off the coast of Thailand.  It turns out to be the fiercely defended home of two groups - a commune of recovering yuppies led by the charismatic Sal (Tilda Swinton), and a gang of well-organised pot farmers with a penchant for heavy side-arms.  Tensions rise when the new arrivals threaten the balance between the groups, and violent trouble quickly ensues.  Beneath the melodrama, ""The Beach"" is an interesting film.  It shows that even in our urge for simplification, we cannot escape our humanity.  Petty jealousies, the natural love of comfort, and our preference for the privileges of Western culture - such as good dental and medical care - ultimately ensure that a utopia-realised is very close to Hell.  DiCaprio is good as the smarmy American, and earns his money in some particularly dramatic scenes.

517805,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B00003CWM2,the masked reviewer,"[1, 3]","There is a genre of film we have dubbed It's-So-Hard-Being (Fill In Pampered Stars Name Here) Cinema, in which an obscenely over-paid actor goes through an existential crisis and finds his life, like, totally shallow, and so divorces himself from all those superficial trappings and returns to what's really important. Think of Anthony Hopkins in It-Stinked -- sorry, INSTINCT, Kevin Spacey in AMERICAN BEAUTY, Winona Ryder in GIRL, INTERRUPTED. The resulting performances are usually difficult to swallow since they come from people who spend more money on Melrose Avenue in half an hour than we make in a month. One of the most ridiculous contributions to this largely insufferable collection is from Leonardo DiCaprio, who got paid twenty million clams to get back to nature.In THE BEACH, director Danny Boyle's hilariously self-serious travelogue, Leo goes to Thailand in search of himself. He overdoses on ""Who am I?"" voice-overs in the beginning but never really convinces us he's anything more than a Beverly Hills brat in the midst of an amusingly naive rebellion. Roughing it in a fleabag motel, he meets pothead Robert Carlyle, who gives him a map to an island paradise. Since all this navel-gazing would be incomplete without some French influence, Leo teams up with a gorgeous gamine and her equally photogenic boyfriend to find the mythic paradise.So, what then is the film once it hits the glorious white sands? Is it ROBINSON CRUSOE? Is it LORD OF THE FLIES? Is it beautifully shot and dumb as a coconut rind? The answers are ""Not really,"" ""Hell, no,"" and ""You betcha."" On the island, Leo goes shirtless, gets a tan, sleeps with two different women for no apparent reason, kills a shark, yells a lot, imagines himself as a character in a video game and saves the tribe from bloodthirsty drug-dealers. No, it doesn't make a shred of sense, but it sure is pretty. Leo bends over backward trying to be a sexy stud, an action hero and a jungle madman, often in the same scene. Not to diminish his talent, but he's just too darn cute for any of it to be believable.The mediocre reviews originally given to THE BEACH were much too kind.

Because its mistakes, while few in number, are jarring enough to make me think more about what could have been instead of what actually wound up on film.It's beautifully filmed and (generally) well-acted, but I never thought the director of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; would pull his punches.  But almost every time the movie is on the verge of great statement or the same kind of stinging indictments set forth by a truly great film like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; it flinches and pulls back.  It's not by mistake that I invoke &quot;Fight Club;&quot; the films are thematically congruent in their exploration of an individual's dissatisfaction with society (some of DiCaprio's narration sounds eerily like that of Edward Norton's in &quot;Fight Club&quot;), and with a little more passion, &quot;The Beach&quot; could have been in the same class.  The sunny-side up ending doesn't help.Stylistically, anyone should know after &quot;Trainspotting&quot; that Boyle is a visually adept but sometimes overly indulgent director; he clearly fell in love with the idea of putting DiCaprio in a video game to show the character's obsession with the unreal and his deteriorating mental state, but the result is unintentionally comical and should have been cut.  On the plus side, the showdowns with gun-toting farmers in the island's copious marijuana fields and the aftermath of a shark attack are some of the most harrowing scenes I can remember.I like this movie and have overlooked the flaws to give it a permanent spot on my shelf.

She thought the Beach would be a romantic love story that takes place on a Beach, and that the movie would be all fun. I warned her that the Beach had a romance story in the film, but that the story is more of a Thriller than a sweet romance film. So people, be warned: don't expect only butterflies and sweet romance, cause then the Beach will be one big shock to you.The Beach is a film that follows a young Backpacker called Richard (perfectly played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who travels through Thailand, looking for adventure. He meets a man in a hotel who gives him a map to a secret beach where life is perfect and beautiful. Together with two French friends, Richard goes in search of this magical beach and finds it. But he soon finds out that the perfect life doesn't excist at all...The beach is a nice, almost warm film with some Thrilling moments for the first hour. You will be entertained and thrilled by tense situations and the most beautiful locations. The Beach itself almost feels like a character in the movie. The locations in the film are some of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. Although the first part of the film has some dark moments, it shows how great paradise can be.Now the second half of the film is very dark and moody. Be warned, cause there is alot of blood and alot of shocking moments.That's what made me dislike the Beach for the first time I saw it. The first hour was great, magical and fun to see. The second half was shocking and a realistic look on life that made me not look at the film for a long time. But now, after I've seen it again a few times, I realise that the Beach is a perfect film for Thriller lovers, a perfect film for people who like Adventure movies, for people who love Drama films, and for people who just love to see a good film.The Beach is now one of those films I like having in my collection: it has grown on me over the years.The technical elements of the film are fantastic. Great cameramovements, great lighting and great effects. It all flows perfectly and defenitly entertains. Congrats to the director who has done a great job creating a story in a kind of way that keeps you watching.The acting is also of a high level and shows that DiCaprio can also play a shocking character next to a heroic romantic character. The man can act for sure. Virginie Ledoyen is absolutely stunning and drop dead gorgious in this film. She acts great and is part of the beautiful aspects of this film for sure.

In my opion after Shallow Grave it was pretty much downhill for the Danny Boyle team. Yes I do think Shallow Grave is superior to Trainspotting. Well I have done it now! lolBut in all seriousness there really is an essence of desperation in the making of this film - rather than being content to explore the community realtionships that are causing strife in the island, the narrative has been rewritten to 'spice' up the action: This could have been the modern Lord of the flies, but falls far short of that. I can understand that it has tried to focus on the personal discovery of the central character, however even this feels polluted - The oppitomy of the film being the 'artistically' expressed computer game sequence - added in such a way that it seems that someone was cluching at straws to make this film 'different;' they suceeded, it is: but just not in a good way.If you want to see how personal descovery of one's self can be obtained through interaction with mother earth - look at the textual examples seen in 'THE THIN RED LINE' or 'APOCALYPSE NOW.'There is one good point about this film - and that lies in the photography - Darius Kondji is outstanding as always!

517814,A1S56U8GV9C8F9,B00003CWM2,Wilson Smith,"[1, 2]","The only redeeming features of this film are its soundtrack, direction, cinematography and titles (done by London-based Tomato, the same team behind techno band Underworld's eyecandy, Trainspotting and various advertisements). I viewed The Beach in the cinema when it was first released, given that it was done by the same team as two of my favorite movies, Trainspotting and Shallow Grave (Director, Danny Boyle; Writer, John Hodge; Producer, Andrew MacDonald) and checked the DVD out from the library around a year later, because I wanted to hear the commentary by Danny Boyle while watching the feature. Watching it again compelled me to write a review... The first thing that the team did wrong was to cast an American as the protagonist, as opposed to a Brit, such as was in the novel (a rhetorical question: what's the ratio of American backpackers vs. Brits?). It didn't help matters that this American was Leonardo DeCaptrio, fresh out of his post-Titanic fame in its inevitable and well-deserved ebb. I speculate that they did this to win over the much-coveted American market. Big mistake. However, the other characters were cast well, albeit peripherally, against the lead role. The screenplay seems to be poorly adapted from the novel, although, having never read the book I can't really comment on the subtle differences. Unlike Trainspotting (adapted from the novel by Irvine Welsh) or his original screenplay for Shallow Grave, this seems to be a half-hearted attempt by John Hodge. The DVD itself is all right, although I found the fact that as soon as you insert it in the drive film previews appear on the screen fairly annoying - I thought that with DVDs, we had evolved from compulsory viewing of the omnipresent approved-for-all-audiences previews. The multiple extra features (hence it being labeled as a &quot;Special Edition&quot;) are nice, most notably the commentary and deleted scenes. After this film's poor reception the talented aforementioned team who procured it decided to go on hiatus and do some solo work. In the end, what it comes down to is; if you want to see a good film by this talented team see either Trainspotting or the slightly-more-obsucre, Shallow Grave.

He ends up hooking up with a French couple and they travel to the island together.The reason ""The Beach"" leaves people a little puzzled is because it's so many thing. It's an adventure, a drama, a romantic triangle and an art house film with existential commentary. But somehow it all comes together and works as a whole, sort of.The beach community is somewhat of a modern hippie commune. Even the most equalitarian communities have a leader or leaders. In this case it's Sal (Tilda Swinton). Richard realizes he'll have to maintain her favor in order to remain in the paradise, even if her subtle demands are disrespectful and ultimately authoritarian. Since The Beach community is a paradise, anything that takes away from their sense of bliss must be removed. As they say, out of sight out of mind.Shot in Thailand, the film runs 2 hours.FINAL WORD: ""The Beach"" is an unusual film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.

The film has its heart is in the right place but somehow loses track and leaves this viewer with an empty shell of a movie. Leonardo Dicaprio once again puts in a decent performance, but the movie itself is forgettable. Dicaprio (as Richard) finds an island/beach paradise (somwewhere in Thailand), inhabited by a bunch of expatriates from different parts of the world. Then, at the same time, they are co-existing with machine gun toting, marijuana growers on another part of the island.  They sort of know of each other's existence and stay out of each other's way. So, for the sake of conflict to drive the film, this island paradise is not going to last, Once Richard (Dicaprio) arrives, the viewer knows something bad is going to happen with his presence there. Sure enough, this is what happens. There is a message here that no matter where you put a bunch of humans together, no matter the circumstances (paradise or hell, pristine or chaotic) disharmony is going to arise and the proverbial **** is going to hit the fan.
