He's one of the funniest, and the smartest comedians we've got and I tell you, I was loaning it to friends but with the stipulation they give it back as soon as they were done so I could laugh again, again, and again.  Dana tells stories we can all relate to and even doing this review is making me laugh.  It's a marvelous DVD.  Buy it for yourself, buy one for your friend, and if you dare to loan it out, make sure you get it back, they will watch it over and over...and that's O.K.!!!!",5,"Dana, Dana, Dana, what a laugh",1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,602,"['Dana', 'Carvey', 'so', 'funny', 'had', 'keep', 'running', 'room', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'had', 'stomach', 'ache', 'one', 'funniest', 'smartest', 'comedians', ""'ve"", 'got', 'tell', 'was', 'loaning', 'friends', 'stipulation', 'give', 'back', 'as', 'soon', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'could', 'laugh', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'Dana', 'stories', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'doing', 'review', 'making', 'marvelous', 'DVD', 'Buy', 'buy', 'one', 'friend', 'dare', 'loan', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'back', 'will', 'watch', 'O.K.']",Dana Carvey: Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies set

His cast (1989-92) was the strongest, most talented cast ever on SNL (I know, it's sacrilege to not say the original cast, but you know that it's true).  While he may still be good at sketch comedy, he absolutely stinks at stand up.  This whole concert was taxing and unfunny.  I really felt bad for the guy the way the audience was half-heartedly laughing for the benefit of the cameras.

This was definitly not his best pefromance. Some of the jokes wer his usual funny bits and extreme, but others were just hum drum dry, and I wished that he had worked on some of his material better. I did not hate this work by any means, but I truely feel that he has better work in his catalog.

Now thats cool but it was not as funny as Squatting Monkeys,and yes I did laugh a couple of times but it was not gut busting. Its a must have even if you never heard of Dana Carvey.
