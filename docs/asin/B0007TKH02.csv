889235,A8YVD7LAWAEI5,B0007TKH02,"Cristina Mclaughlin ""Cristina625""","[28, 32]","I have done aerobics my whole life and been dancing for some time as well.  I'm not really a hip-hop dancer although I've wanted to get into it for some time.  Whenever you buy an aerobic dance video you want to get a work-out and learn some cool new moves to try out on the dance floor.  This video will do neither.  I bought at the behest of my boyfriend who assured me that she is a great dancer.  While that might be true, she should completely stay away from instruction.Good instructional videos must have steady camera angles where you can see the whole moves consistently.  They can not bounce around b/c it confuses the viewer and limits the viewing of the moves.  This video mostly shows her from the waist up which is awful since you are supposed to be looking at her feet.  Mostly this is to show off how sexy and cool she looks rather than actually try to show you anything at all.Of course it is mandatory to have clear, concise instructions on all facets of new moves.  This includes feet placement, how to step, where your toes should point, hip placement and counting correctly to the rhythm.  She does NONE of this well.  Her counting is off big time and doesn't match her steps.  There are times when all she does is count and not instruct at all.  .Also her instructions don't match her movements.  A good instructor will tell you to step with your right while she steps with her left.  Why? Because she is in front of you and her actions need to mirror yours.  So when she tells you to step with your right it should look like it's on the right side to you.  She doesn't do this at all and actually forgets to mention the left or right altogether after a while.A bit more than half-way through both videos I shut them off because they were totally pointless and a waste of my life.  I've learned more watching people in clubs and got a better workout walking to the store to pick up this video.  Save your money and buy videos from people who made their money instructing instead of taking their clothes off.",1,Why playboy bunnies shouldn't teach,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2029,"['have', 'done', 'aerobics', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'dancing', 'time', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'hip-hop', 'dancer', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'get', 'time', 'Whenever', 'buy', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'video', 'want', 'get', 'work-out', 'learn', 'cool', 'new', 'moves', 'try', 'out', 'dance', 'floor', 'video', 'will', 'do', 'bought', 'behest', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'assured', 'great', 'dancer', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'should', 'completely', 'stay', 'away', 'instruction.Good', 'instructional', 'videos', 'must', 'have', 'steady', 'camera', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'whole', 'moves', 'consistently', 'can', 'not', 'bounce', 'b/c', 'viewer', 'viewing', 'moves', 'video', 'mostly', 'waist', 'up', 'awful', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'feet', 'Mostly', 'show', 'off', 'how', 'sexy', 'cool', 'rather', 'actually', 'try', 'show', 'anything', 'all.Of', 'course', 'mandatory', 'have', 'clear', 'concise', 'instructions', 'facets', 'new', 'moves', 'feet', 'placement', 'how', 'step', 'where', 'toes', 'should', 'point', 'hip', 'placement', 'counting', 'correctly', 'rhythm', 'NONE', 'well', 'counting', 'big', 'time', ""n't"", 'match', 'steps', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'count', 'not', 'instruct', '.Also', 'instructions', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'movements', 'good', 'instructor', 'will', 'tell', 'step', 'right', 'left', 'Why', 'front', 'actions', 'need', 'mirror', 'yours', 'So', 'when', 'step', 'right', 'should', 'look', 'right', 'side', ""n't"", 'do', 'actually', 'forgets', 'mention', 'left', 'right', 'altogether', 'while.A', 'bit', 'more', 'half-way', 'videos', 'shut', 'off', 'were', 'totally', 'pointless', 'waste', 'life', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'more', 'watching', 'people', 'clubs', 'got', 'better', 'workout', 'walking', 'store', 'pick', 'up', 'video', 'Save', 'money', 'buy', 'videos', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'money', 'instructing', 'instead', 'taking', 'clothes']",N/A
