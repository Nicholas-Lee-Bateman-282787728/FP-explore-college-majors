I first heard the Statler Brothers on my car radio in the early 1970s while driving through WV on my way home to visit my mother. I believe they were singing &#34;Moments To Remember&#34;. I stopped the car, wrote down the group's name and put that name on my forever watch and listen list. The harmony wasn't just in their voices. It seemed to be coming from one source. Harmony, emotion and meaning from four individuals in perfect sync. I think they were reading the American mind.",5,Never say goodby,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,547,"['concert', 'took', 'place', 'Salem', 'Virginia', 'October', '2002', 'first', 'heard', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'car', 'radio', 'early', '1970s', 'driving', 'WV', 'way', 'home', 'visit', 'mother', 'believe', 'were', 'singing', '34', 'Moments', 'Remember', '34', 'stopped', 'car', 'wrote', 'group', 'name', 'put', 'name', 'forever', 'watch', 'listen', 'list', 'harmony', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'voices', 'seemed', 'be', 'coming', 'one', 'source', 'Harmony', 'emotion', 'meaning', 'four', 'individuals', 'perfect', 'sync', 'think', 'were', 'reading', 'American', 'mind']",N/A
