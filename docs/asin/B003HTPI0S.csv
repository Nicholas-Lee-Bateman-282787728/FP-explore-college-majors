The cast is also great. Wood Harris and Jamie Hector, who I already loved from THE WIRE, are great in this.

A great story for anyone interested in the workings of the rap industry this could discourage some from entering the the rap business but I dont think this was the films purpose. This is a 5 star based on the great performances from Wood Harris and Jamie Hector both were great in the HBO series the Wire",5,Rappin in South Florida,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,420,"['excellent', 'film', 'thought', 'aspect', 'film', 'mark', 'acting', 'script', 'sets', 'very', 'convincing', 'great', 'story', 'anyone', 'interested', 'workings', 'rap', 'industry', 'could', 'discourage', 'entering', 'rap', 'business', 'dont', 'think', 'was', 'films', 'purpose', '5', 'star', 'based', 'great', 'performances', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Jamie', 'Hector', 'were', 'great', 'HBO', 'series', 'Wire']",N/A

Instead, it was actually good and reflected some real life events in the rap game.  The rappers and music were made up, but they actually sounded good and their names were not bad either.  Lil Scrappy was OK, although the film failed to tell what happened to his character!  I guess they forgot all about him.The music and rhymes sound believable and better than a lot of rappers who do it for a living!  If this had been a major release with a soundtrack (how come they don't make those anymore?), this would have been a hit!  I highly recommend this film, and as one of the only urban films on Blu-Ray, I would say get it!  Oh yeah, Big Daddy Kane was in it and it was good to see him, but his teeth were jacked up with one missing!  I guess all of those years of doing coke caught up to him.  Trick Daddy's face also looked weird too as if he has some type of burn/acne/surgery all along where his beard used to be.  That is strange.",4,"This was good, forget the haters.",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,1035,"['Man', 'had', 'go', 'off', 'haters', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'assumed', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'Instead', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'reflected', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'rap', 'game', 'rappers', 'music', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'actually', 'sounded', 'good', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'Lil', 'Scrappy', 'was', 'OK', 'film', 'failed', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'character', 'guess', 'forgot', 'him.The', 'music', 'rhymes', 'sound', 'believable', 'better', 'lot', 'rappers', 'who', 'do', 'living', 'had', 'been', 'major', 'release', 'soundtrack', 'how', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'urban', 'films', 'Blu-Ray', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Kane', 'was', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'teeth', 'were', 'jacked', 'up', 'one', 'missing', 'guess', 'years', 'doing', 'coke', 'caught', 'up', 'Trick', 'Daddy', 'face', 'also', 'looked', 'weird', 'too', 'type', 'burn/acne/surgery', 'all', 'along', 'where', 'beard', 'used', 'be', 'strange']",N/A

Very interesting to see how one person's career is on the rise and what he goes through, while a big star is starting to lose his fame. All the cast is really good. Definitely worth it.
