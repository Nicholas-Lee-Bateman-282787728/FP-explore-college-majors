1397392,AHVG37KI3IM38,B004DOTKDM,G-Fan,"[8, 8]","I have to admit, for me at least, Ernest P. Worrell was an acquired taste.  It took awhile for the charm of the character to finally get through to me.  Probably the first Ernest appearance to really tip the scales for me was in Ernest Saves Christmas (not included in this triple pack, but readily available on a single disc DVD) which I saw in the theater, many years ago.  I'm a sucker for Christmas movies anyway, and ESC just hit all the right buttons for me.Over the years, the genius that was Jim Varney slowly grew on me, catching the occasional Ernest movie that would turn up on cable TV.  I often entertained the notion of collecting the Ernest films on DVD, as they had come to be true guilty pleasures for me.  But other than the aforementioned Ernest Saves Christmas, I somehow never got around to it.  Then along comes this Mill Creek Entertainment Ernest triple feature for well under ten dollars.  What a deal!  The perfect way to kick-start my Ernest DVD collection.  I'm no expert, but so far as I can tell, the image quality of these DVDs is excellent.  Not much in the way of extras, but for the money, how can you go wrong?  Over time, Mill Creek has more or less built their name by releasing any number of public domain films in multi-pack DVD collections of wildly varying quality.  But the one constant has always been a great value for your hard-earned dollar.  Now with the Ernest movies, the Ernest TV series (which I have yet to purchase, but probably will), and several other recent top-quality DVD releases, Mill Creek has greatly enhanced its reputation, at least in my opinion.  Again, thank you, Mill Creek Entertaiment.  And THANK YOU, Jim Varney, may you rest in peace...So, if you are a fan of Jim Varney/Ernest, this value simply cannot be beat.  Three TOP Ernest films in one low-priced package.  True bang for your buck.  Now go over and check out the terrific value on Mill Creek's Hey Vern, It's Ernest! TV series.

1397417,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B004DOTKDM,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[3, 3]","I remember when my mother was babysitting a grandchild once and they had rented a Jim Varney movie. It was probably Scared Stupid but I haven't watched that movie yet. I have watched Goes to Jail and Goes to Camp. Goes to Jail is a lot better than the camp movie. These movies are ok but the acting can at times, by the cast and not Jim, can be simply dreadful. The ""Goes to Camp"" movie featured ex pro football star Lyle Alzado and the ""Goes to Jail"" movie featured ex boxer Randall Tex Cobb in it. The camp movie also had the actual Indian actor Iron Eyes Cody from the 70's pollution tv commercials. The commercial I am talking about is the Indian in the canoe who has a tear in his eye because of the way we are polluting the world. I was glad to see him alive and in a movie. But what a sad movie it is. The acting is at the level of the worst B movie. And it was sad to see that actor in the movie. Jim Varney was one FUNNY guy and I love how he uses his voice and his face. His self monologues are great. As for the movies though they are at best for very young children, say Kindergarden to about second grade. The movies' plots can be very weak. I'm not surprised that only FANS commented on these videos because only a Jim Varney fan would enjoy these pathetic scripts. Jim Varney is a lot of fun but the movies can be quite retarded. The acting of the so called actors can also be simply awful. There is no comedic or dramatic tension. The movies are easy to SLEEP to. The movies are fun though just to watch Jim Varney. Rest in Peace Jim.Update, I finally watched ""Ernest: Scared Stupid"" and it is by far the best of the three movies. Famous Black Actress Eartha Kitt as some old woman living in some old house on the property where a tree was planted over a troll that would come back to capture kids. The troll also cursed the Varney character's family so that each male descendant would get progressively dumber. This movie clearly has the highest production values and probably the biggest budget. So due to my including this movie in my review if the three pack of movies I felt it was only fair that I add one more star to this review.Jim Varney might not have risen to the level of a Jerry Lewis but it might have been simply due to the movie company and the movie budgets. Back in the day when I was young Jerry Lewis and even a guy like Don Knotts could be featured in a comedy to appeal to young people and to families. Whatever the case I suppose Jim Varney remained a B movie star even when he was in his best movies. It's impossible for me to know if we saw the best of Jim Varney or if his fame could have been increased with better management. Either way Jim Varney will be remembered by his fans in a positive light. So what if the movies were not so great, Jim Varney was the reason for the movie and he was a funny guy. This world needs more people who help the world to laugh.",4,To Enjoy these movies you MUST ENJOY Jim Varney.,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,2907,"['remember', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'babysitting', 'grandchild', 'once', 'had', 'rented', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'Scared', 'Stupid', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'yet', 'have', 'watched', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'Goes', 'Camp', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'lot', 'better', 'camp', 'movie', 'movies', 'are', 'ok', 'acting', 'can', 'times', 'cast', 'not', 'Jim', 'can', 'be', 'simply', 'dreadful', 'Goes', 'Camp', 'movie', 'featured', 'ex', 'pro', 'football', 'star', 'Lyle', 'Alzado', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'movie', 'featured', 'ex', 'boxer', 'Randall', 'Tex', 'Cobb', 'camp', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'actual', 'Indian', 'actor', 'Iron', 'Eyes', 'Cody', '70', 'pollution', 'tv', 'commercials', 'commercial', 'am', 'talking', 'Indian', 'canoe', 'who', 'tear', 'eye', 'way', 'are', 'polluting', 'world', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'alive', 'movie', 'what', 'sad', 'movie', 'acting', 'level', 'worst', 'B', 'movie', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'actor', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'was', 'one', 'FUNNY', 'guy', 'love', 'how', 'voice', 'face', 'self', 'monologues', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'best', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'say', 'Kindergarden', 'second', 'grade', 'movies', 'plots', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'weak', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'only', 'FANS', 'commented', 'videos', 'only', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'fan', 'would', 'enjoy', 'pathetic', 'scripts', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'lot', 'fun', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'retarded', 'acting', 'so', 'called', 'actors', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'simply', 'awful', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'movies', 'are', 'easy', 'SLEEP', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'just', 'watch', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Rest', 'Peace', 'Jim.Update', 'finally', 'watched', 'Ernest', 'Scared', 'Stupid', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'movies', 'Famous', 'Black', 'Actress', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'old', 'woman', 'living', 'old', 'house', 'property', 'where', 'tree', 'was', 'planted', 'troll', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'capture', 'kids', 'troll', 'also', 'cursed', 'Varney', 'character', 'family', 'so', 'male', 'descendant', 'would', 'get', 'progressively', 'dumber', 'movie', 'clearly', 'highest', 'production', 'values', 'probably', 'biggest', 'budget', 'So', 'due', 'including', 'movie', 'review', 'three', 'pack', 'movies', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'fair', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'review.Jim', 'Varney', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'risen', 'level', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'due', 'movie', 'company', 'movie', 'budgets', 'Back', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'even', 'guy', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'could', 'be', 'featured', 'comedy', 'appeal', 'young', 'people', 'families', 'case', 'suppose', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'remained', 'B', 'movie', 'star', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'best', 'movies', 'impossible', 'know', 'saw', 'best', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'fame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'increased', 'better', 'management', 'way', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'fans', 'positive', 'light', 'what', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'guy', 'world', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'help', 'world', 'laugh']",Ernest Goes to Camp / Ernest Scared Stupid / Ernest Goes to Jail

I've always watched the Ernest movies when I was younger and found them quite hilarious, with the exception of Ernest In the Army, which is actually pretty stupid and doesn't make sense to the average Army veteran. But these top three movies are excellent and actually have a pretty good plot to all of them, which are explained in the short version way.""Ernest Goes to Camp""--Ernest P. Worrell is a clumsy groundskeeper at a summer camp who dreams about one day becoming a counselor at Camp Kikakee, which is an Indian tribal site that teaches the way of the Indian to the local youth. He gets his chance with the ""Second Chance"" boys, several city youth from a juvenile detention center who regard Ernest as nothing but a loser, even though Ernest is actually doing his best to keep them from being thrown out. But a danger to the camp's future arises when some local miners are trying to get the camp due to the valuable contents being located on the exact soil of the camp, and Ernest is the camp's last hope to saving the day!Hilarious part: Ernest gets injured at least half a dozen times in this movie, in which case the camp boss walks over to observe what happened and then remarks casually, ""At least no one got hurt."" Classic!""Ernest Scared Stupid""--Worrell is back as another average loser in a loser job, which only the kids seem to like in that local town, which has a local legend from when some inhuman monster was imprisoned in a tree by the townfolk over a hundred years back. You notice the local antisocial witch-like woman who doesn't like people being on her property and how Ernest wants to build a treehouse on GUESS WHAT???--the tree which still holds the local monster! The monster soon gets free on Halloween night and sets out to hatch the eggs of more monsters and to turn kids into wooden, mini statues. The monster soon goes on the rampage and nothing can stop him, except...perhaps dairy substances! Guess that the monster is lactose intolerant! Hee hee.Hilarious part: The main monster cannot be defeated by the dairy products, and is only destroyed when Ernest dances with him and plucks a sloppy kiss on the monster's face. Ewwwwwwww-www! But that scene is guaranteed to have everyone laughing.""Ernest Goes to Jail""--Worrell is the regular clumsy oaf who is now in charge of being the night janitor at a bank, hoping to be a bank teller someday. His antics only get him into further trouble, but he looks on the bright side to being called up to jury duty at the local jailhouse. Turns out, there is an inmate on Death Row who looks just like Ernest, and manages to make the switch when the jury comes by for a tour. So now the bad inmate is on the loose, hoping to rob the bank that Ernest works at, and Ernest is now on death row, hoping to pass himself off as the tough guy that his character is. But his execution date is coming fast and he must find a way to escape and set things right.Hilarious part: When Ernest is switched places with the bad guy inmate, he goes about life as usual, and it takes him several hours before he finally realizes that he is in fact...IN JAIL!!! Why? Because of his incoherent belief that the jury members also share lunch with the inmates in the mess hall, and it takes a door of metal bars to be slammed in his face before the realization hits him.
