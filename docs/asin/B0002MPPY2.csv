Guyton ""eluraluna""","[3, 5]","My kids like this one, because it has lots of music, but not being able to skip or fast forward through the ad at the beginning of teh DVD is a real turn-off. My kids do not care that the purchsase of this video supports Sesmae Street- and neither do I anymore. I have stopped purchasing Sesame Street DVDs because of the blocking of fast forward during the initial ad. Its just too annoying.",4,Love the episode- hate the ad,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,392,"['kids', 'one', 'lots', 'music', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'skip', 'fast', 'forward', 'ad', 'beginning', 'teh', 'DVD', 'real', 'turn-off', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'purchsase', 'video', 'Sesmae', 'Street-', 'neither', 'do', 'anymore', 'have', 'stopped', 'purchasing', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'DVDs', 'blocking', 'fast', 'forward', 'initial', 'ad', 'just', 'too', 'annoying']",N/A

There are some very nice, heart-warming songs on there that I haven't heard on any other Sesame St. shows.  My favorite is ""We all sing with the same voice"".My son dances to just about every song on this DVD, and it's helped him learn some of the basic sing-a-long songs.Our only complaint is that Ernie and Bert are his absolutely favorite characters, and they're really not featured in this DVD.  They each have one song, which is misleading since they're on the cover.  My son wanted this DVD simply because it had Ernie and Bert on it, which was clever marketing but somewhat frustrating once we started playing it.",4,Where are Ernie and Bert??,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,705,"['son', 'LOVES', 'movie', 'agree', 'must', 'young', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'fans', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'heart-warming', 'songs', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'other', 'Sesame', 'St.', 'favorite', 'sing', 'same', 'voice', 'son', 'dances', 'just', 'song', 'DVD', 'helped', 'learn', 'basic', 'sing-a-long', 'songs.Our', 'only', 'complaint', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'are', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'characters', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'featured', 'DVD', 'have', 'one', 'song', 'misleading', ""'re"", 'cover', 'son', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'simply', 'had', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'was', 'clever', 'marketing', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'started', 'playing']",N/A

841410,A26FY1ID4Z56FV,B0002MPPY2,Darren Thornton,"[1, 1]","Sesame Street remains a television classic.  This DVD brings back a lot of memories.  We can see some of our old friends.  Also,  there are lots of incredible songs!  There are two premises with this video.  Biff and Sully are on the roof fixing a TV antenna.  That makes things a little dated for some. I still remember when we first got cable.  This bit gives some comedic moments. Yet it also allows the use of old footage. That practice is quite common on Sesame Street videos.  It saves on the budget. But there isn't always a steady flow with newer material.  For the most part, it works well here.  But I caught one goof.  At one point Sully turns on the TV at the bottom left.  Yet this set has a regular dial on the top right.  The second part is the sing-along.  Bob, David, Gordon, and Maria have brought along a piano and some friends.  Big Bird and Hoots the Owl (with saxophone) are the only other Muppets on the roof. We also have a very diverse group of kids.  One is in a wheelchair.  Some seem a little uncomfortable on camera.  The song selection is pretty good.  We get several kids' classics.  Who knew that Old MacDonald's farm had a saxophone?  The DVD cover is a little misleading.  Grover appears in an old clip with Madeline Kahn.  There is a voiceover by Ernie, leading into Rubber Duckie.  We also get Bert's pigeon dance. These songs are also on the Old School sets.  Alaina Reed (Olivia) and Linda Bove appear in a clip doing ""Sing.""  They sign too!  This video is the first time I recall hearing We All Sing with the Same Voice.  The rooftop gang starts it off, leading into the old clip.  It's a nice video of various children.  Then the gang finishes it off.  Our finale is What's the Name of That Song?  We get to see more of the neighborhood.  Other muppets, including Oscar, join in.  Luis and Susan are walking down the street.  This DVD is only 30 minutes.  That's too short!  Sony Wonder should combine at least three such videos into a single release.  Short DVDs take up the same space as longer ones.  Apparently the video was originally done in the 80s.  Maria's hairdo is definitely from that period.  It's shorter now.  The saddest part was seeing Northern Calloway (David).  He was almost unrecognizable.  His problems behind the scenes have been noted elsewhere.  Supposedly his medicine led to a weight gain.  How come his suggestions for songs were always rebuffed here?  The future wasn't bright for him.  Maria married Luis.  Calloway got fired from the show.  He died not long afterwards.  Yet you can still see some of his old spark here.  Let's remember that part.  Some folks might like something else about this DVD.
