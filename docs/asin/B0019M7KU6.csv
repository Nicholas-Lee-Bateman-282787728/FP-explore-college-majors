1164357,A1K99ETLTLSBNO,B0019M7KU6,Ehav Eliyahu Ever,"[23, 23]","Originally, the title of this movie was The Inevitable Undoing of Jay Brooks. The distrubters forced them to change it to I'm Through With White Girls since they felt it was more catchy. So don't let the title fool you.Now to the review. This was an extremely enjoyable film about what happens when a person thinks that their problems in love are due to one thing and they find that their problems are due to themselves. I don't want to give to much of the story away, but Jay Brooks is a guy who comes to the conclusion that his problems in love are due to the fact that he has only dated white women. What he finds though is that his problems are of his own making and that race and class had nothing to do with it.I enjoyed this movie because it is not a stereotypical movie. There is in fact a funny scene where two people see each other as stereotypes. The movie is a colorful mix of characters surrounding the love story two people who themselves are figuring things out and in the process help Jay Brooks figure out himself. The film is also about growth for several characters in the movie and also about what one will do for love and how it can cause one to overcome their deepest fears.Buy this movie if you love quirky, funny, romance movies.",5,Don't Let the Title Fool You,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1253,"['Originally', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'Inevitable', 'Undoing', 'Jay', 'Brooks', 'distrubters', 'forced', 'change', ""'m"", 'White', 'Girls', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'catchy', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'fool', 'you.Now', 'review', 'was', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'person', 'problems', 'love', 'are', 'due', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'problems', 'are', 'due', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'Jay', 'Brooks', 'guy', 'who', 'conclusion', 'problems', 'love', 'are', 'due', 'fact', 'only', 'dated', 'white', 'women', 'What', 'problems', 'are', 'own', 'making', 'race', 'class', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'fact', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'see', 'other', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'colorful', 'mix', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'figuring', 'things', 'out', 'process', 'help', 'Jay', 'Brooks', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'also', 'about', 'growth', 'several', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'cause', 'one', 'overcome', 'deepest', 'fears.Buy', 'movie', 'love', 'quirky', 'funny', 'romance', 'movies']",I'm Through With White Girls

1164359,A37NODCIL8PP75,B0019M7KU6,"Jeannette Belliveau ""Author, Writer, Editor, ...","[5, 5]","As a French-Canadian woman married to a mixed-race man -- a graphic artist no less who likes some nerdie pursuits such as comic books, writing his own graphic novels, coin collecting, Japanese war movies -- I was astonished to see a movie that would make as its central character someone like Jay Brooks, with his glasses, sketchbooks and line of creative patter to the world around him.""I'm Through With White Girls"" might sound like something along the lines of Spike Lee's ""Jungle Fever"" (who knows with such a title)? Actually on first impression, it doesn't make much of a deal out of interracial dating per se, showing how common it is in modern-day Los Angeles.The texture of the film at first is a bit like a student film project, with some of the audio muffled and a lovely simplicity. However, as Jay moved from his white girl phase to the hilarious ""Operation Brown Sugar"" and ultimately to the girl of his dreams, a biracial Canadian writer named Catherine with Valley Girl elocution, the film grew on me more and more.Jay's mind is so nimble, and his friends including a white hip-hop fan so appealing, that there is much to like here.There is fabulous dialogue throughout -- who knew an Arrested Development writer was involved?I don't want to spoil the fun by quoting many specifics of the dialogue, but you just have to love it when Catherine asks Jay to name the prime minister of Canada before she will accept a date, and when Jay can't and says ""Are you going to make me beg?"" and he adds, ""Beg like Mars Blackman or James Brown?"" This retort eventually sets up a lovely denouement.Can't think of any film that I watched on a whim that was more of a sleeper than this. I can tell by the other reviews here that this is a hit with others who are not graphic artists, writers or in an interracial relationship, because there are some universal observations in ""I'm Through With White Girls"" about family, friends, attraction and commitment worth spending time on.",5,Amazing how much I enjoyed this little indie film,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1980,"['French-Canadian', 'woman', 'married', 'mixed-race', 'man', 'graphic', 'artist', 'less', 'who', 'nerdie', 'pursuits', 'such', 'comic', 'books', 'writing', 'own', 'graphic', 'novels', 'coin', 'collecting', 'Japanese', 'war', 'movies', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'central', 'character', 'someone', 'Jay', 'Brooks', 'glasses', 'sketchbooks', 'line', 'creative', 'patter', 'world', ""'m"", 'White', 'Girls', 'might', 'sound', 'something', 'lines', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'who', 'title', 'Actually', 'first', 'impression', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'deal', 'interracial', 'dating', 'se', 'showing', 'how', 'common', 'modern-day', 'Los', 'Angeles.The', 'texture', 'film', 'first', 'bit', 'student', 'film', 'project', 'audio', 'muffled', 'lovely', 'simplicity', 'However', 'Jay', 'moved', 'white', 'girl', 'phase', 'hilarious', 'Operation', 'Brown', 'Sugar', 'ultimately', 'girl', 'dreams', 'biracial', 'Canadian', 'writer', 'named', 'Catherine', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'elocution', 'film', 'grew', 'more', 'mind', 'so', 'nimble', 'friends', 'including', 'white', 'hip-hop', 'fan', 'so', 'appealing', 'much', 'like', 'fabulous', 'dialogue', 'who', 'knew', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'writer', 'was', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'fun', 'quoting', 'many', 'specifics', 'dialogue', 'just', 'have', 'love', 'when', 'Catherine', 'Jay', 'name', 'prime', 'minister', 'Canada', 'will', 'accept', 'date', 'when', 'Jay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Are', 'going', 'make', 'beg', 'Beg', 'Mars', 'Blackman', 'James', 'Brown', 'retort', 'eventually', 'up', 'lovely', 'denouement.Ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'watched', 'whim', 'was', 'more', 'sleeper', 'can', 'tell', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'hit', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'graphic', 'artists', 'writers', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'are', 'universal', 'observations', ""'m"", 'White', 'Girls', 'family', 'friends', 'attraction', 'commitment', 'spending', 'time']",I'm Through With White Girls

We don't actually get to see the main character in any sort of relationship with white women. Instead this movie is about the main character's insecurities and fear of commitment.And that HAS been done, too many times, and usually better than this.

The characters are well drawn in a multitude of dimensions and flavors. In fact the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the title after the first few minutes. Like Slumdog Millionaire it charms us from the way it shows the struggle of a lovable underdog fitting into the cookie cut out complexity that is commercial society whiles trying to find the truth about himself and love.I don't even know how I found this movie on Netflix, furthermore I don't even know why I bothered to see it since the title suggest something of a lowball Wayan Brothers comedy.
