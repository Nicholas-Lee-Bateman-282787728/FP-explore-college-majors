It must be a real sleeper, but boy is it a good movie.  Funny,  a bit serious and fun to watch.Notle delivers a solid performance but it is Short that makes the movie shine through his brilliant comedy.  There were many laugh out load scenes in this movie and it is fun to watch more than once.Notle is an ex con going straight and Short is the straight but desperate man turning to crime.  The straight man/comic routine really comes across well between these two characters.  If you enjoyed &quot;Pure Luck&quot; with Glover as the straight man, you'll also enjoy this film.

With just getting out of jail after serving his time for robbery Nick Nolte goes to the bank to cash his check so while been  served a  little man decides he'll rob the bank for money to help his daughters school fees. Now what seems to be an simple little thing turns out to be one hell of a mess, the clock is ticking. Police arrive and surround the bank which leaves little doubt as what happens next, a hostage is needed and of cause Nolte is the hostage much bigger than the robber and wanting nothing to do with it. and to make it worse the cops picked Nolte up from the boat ramp and gave him a lift to the bank so now they think he is guilty and the robber. With so much going on it's a must see show, I have told you some of it and that is all. There is a lot more worth mentioning but why spoil it.
