524482,A2TLEB18074L4S,B00003CXGR,Alexander Leach,"[0, 1]","A beautifully made (if slight) film, although the script is not up to Allens's normal standard.  His devotees will search the script in vain for references to Bergman, Scott Fitzgerald or Strindberg.  This is aimed at a much more middlebrow audience.Having said all that I never really laughed at films like Take The Money &amp; Run, while I did at certain sequences in this.The first third concerning the abortive robbery is only sporadically amusing, while the remainder, when the nouveaux riches Allen and Ullman attempt to enter 'society' has some genuinely funny moments.  These are usually triggered by an absurd situation or visual gag (often Allen's lurid costumes) rather than the script itself.There are a couple of good set pieces: a TV 'infomercial' (realistically shot on videotape) in which Allen and the gang describe the working of the cookie company and their crass new found wealth to a bemused TV journalist, and a black tie party hosted by Allen and Ullman in their garish apartment.A very nebulous film which runs out of steam in the final stretch, but definitely worth seeing.

That is the case here with Woody Allen's partial revival of his early film classic Take the Money and Run, with a class twist. Here Roy (Allen's character) is just as dimwitted as old Virgil of Take the Money but as an older and wiser man he knows when to quit (for a while anyway). So when Roy and his associates' attempted bank robbery is foiled by his bugling his wife's successful cookie shop cover operation sees them through the rough spots, again for a while. After a trip through the wilds of bourgeois New York the couple, after some disasters personal and financial, go back to the old tricks of the trade. I am not altogether sure what this says about class mobility in a democratic society but Roy please do not call me for your next caper.

524485,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,B00003CXGR,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[2, 3]","The World Trade Center tragedy makes movie-watching seem patently frivolous, but somehow the more serious the movie the more frivolous it seems.  Perhaps the films that offer the greatest distance from the September 11th events are musicals and comedies.  So last night I watched Woody Allen's &quot;Small Time Crooks.&quot;  The first half ranks with his funniest movies.  But as they say in show biz, you gotta have a second act.  Allen's recent films have had powerful first acts but flopped in the second act.  I'm thinking about films such as &quot;Bullets Over Broadway,&quot; &quot;Mighty Aphrodite,&quot; &quot;Stardust Memories,&quot; &quot;Deconstructing Harry,&quot; and &quot;Small Time Crooks.&quot;  The premise of the latter is well-known; you can't miss it even on the video or DVD box.  Woody and pals set out to rob a bank by tunneling under a rented shop next to the bank; to keep up the front, Woody's wife (Tracey Ullman) sells cookies; but the cookies become a hit, get franchised, and Woody and co. become filthy rich.  This all happens, presumably, before they finish digging the tunnel.  Act One is lively and quick; indeed, more rapid-fire than any previous Allen comedy that I can remember.  This is largely due to Tracey Ullman, who Allen said was the funniest person he's ever worked with. Her comic timing is flawless, almost as good as Carole Lombard.  (Still, in my book Ullman isn't really as funny as Diane Keaton, who may not have been as zippy but whose facial expressions in films such as &quot;Love and Death&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; were simply over the top.  Years later one can remember her facial expressions even as the movie is forgotten, like the grin of the Cheshire cat.)When Woody and Tracey turn nouveau-riche, the Second Act begins and withers away.  Making fun of the nouveau riche is easy, but Allen needed a script writer who could take the humor beyond the obvious.  The best part of the Second Act is Hugh Grant's turn as a con man for Ullman seeking a crash course in aesthetics.  He's very good in this role, although not nearly as good or funny as Michael Caine in &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;--a delightful movie through and through.)People have said that the more films Allen turns out, the more one appreciates his early comedies.  In fact, a student says this of Allen himself in &quot;Stardust Memories.&quot;  I think it's true.  &quot;Annie Hall&quot; must reign as the most accomplished film.  The funniest, I think, are &quot;Love and Death&quot; and &quot;Bananas,&quot; with &quot;Sleeper&quot; a close third.  &quot;Play it Again Sam&quot; has a better plot than these, and may come in second to &quot;Annie Hall&quot; for the all-around award.  Many of Allen's early movies owe their success to editor Ralph Rosenblum', who took the various &quot;bits&quot; that Allen filmed and strung them together into feature-length movies.  It seems to me that Allen has unfairly played down Rosenblum's contribution.  But Allen's films have suffered ever since Rosenblum left.  Allen is a good director, but when he supervises the editing he lacks objectivity--a common fault among directors who insist on editing or on having the final cut.  That being said, I have to concede that the first half of &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; was very well edited; it's as if Allen's editing is improving with on-the-job training.  Still, he lost it in the second act.",4,"In the first half, Woody is in top comic form",1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,3432,"['World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'tragedy', 'movie-watching', 'seem', 'patently', 'frivolous', 'somehow', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', 'more', 'frivolous', 'Perhaps', 'films', 'offer', 'greatest', 'distance', 'September', '11th', 'events', 'are', 'musicals', 'comedies', 'So', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks.', 'quot', 'first', 'half', 'ranks', 'funniest', 'movies', 'say', 'show', 'biz', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'second', 'act', 'Allen', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'powerful', 'first', 'acts', 'flopped', 'second', 'act', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'quot', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'quot', 'quot', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'quot', 'quot', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks.', 'quot', 'premise', 'latter', 'well-known', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'even', 'video', 'DVD', 'box', 'Woody', 'pals', 'set', 'out', 'rob', 'bank', 'tunneling', 'rented', 'shop', 'bank', 'keep', 'up', 'front', 'Woody', 'wife', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'cookies', 'cookies', 'become', 'hit', 'get', 'franchised', 'Woody', 'become', 'filthy', 'rich', 'presumably', 'finish', 'digging', 'tunnel', 'Act', 'One', 'lively', 'quick', 'indeed', 'more', 'rapid-fire', 'previous', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'can', 'remember', 'largely', 'due', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'who', 'Allen', 'said', 'was', 'funniest', 'person', 'ever', 'worked', 'comic', 'timing', 'flawless', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Still', 'book', 'Ullman', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'funny', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'zippy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Love', 'Death', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'were', 'simply', 'top', 'Years', 'later', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'facial', 'expressions', 'even', 'movie', 'forgotten', 'grin', 'Cheshire', 'cat', 'When', 'Woody', 'Tracey', 'turn', 'nouveau-riche', 'Second', 'Act', 'away', 'Making', 'fun', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'easy', 'Allen', 'needed', 'script', 'writer', 'who', 'could', 'take', 'humor', 'obvious', 'best', 'part', 'Second', 'Act', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'turn', 'con', 'man', 'Ullman', 'seeking', 'crash', 'course', 'aesthetics', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'funny', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'quot', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'quot', 'delightful', 'movie', 'People', 'have', 'said', 'more', 'films', 'Allen', 'out', 'more', 'one', 'early', 'comedies', 'fact', 'student', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'Memories.', 'quot', 'think', 'true', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'must', 'reign', 'most', 'accomplished', 'film', 'funniest', 'think', 'are', 'quot', 'Love', 'Death', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bananas', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sleeper', 'quot', 'close', 'third', 'quot', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'quot', 'better', 'plot', 'may', 'come', 'second', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'all-around', 'award', 'Many', 'Allen', 'early', 'movies', 'owe', 'success', 'editor', 'Ralph', 'Rosenblum', 'who', 'took', 'various', 'quot', 'bits', 'quot', 'Allen', 'filmed', 'strung', 'together', 'feature-length', 'movies', 'Allen', 'unfairly', 'played', 'down', 'Rosenblum', 'contribution', 'Allen', 'films', 'have', 'suffered', 'ever', 'Rosenblum', 'left', 'Allen', 'good', 'director', 'when', 'editing', 'objectivity', 'common', 'fault', 'directors', 'who', 'insist', 'editing', 'having', 'final', 'cut', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'concede', 'first', 'half', 'quot', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'quot', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'Allen', 'editing', 'improving', 'on-the-job', 'training', 'Still', 'lost', 'second', 'act']",Small Time Crooks VHS

So much has been made about this man's personal life that people forget his professional talents.Woody Allen and Tracy Ullman play a husband and wife in the style of Fred & Ethel Mertz of ""I Love Lucy"".  They constantly bicker at each other, but it still remains an obviously loving relationship.As the movie begins, Allen's character, Ray, is an ex-con who works as a dish washer, and Ullman plays his manicurist wife, Frenchy.  They have exactly $6,000 between them, and they've decided to pool their money with other partners in order to execute a plan to rob a bank.  They rent a storefront that neighbors the bank and plan on digging a tunnel from the store to inside the bank's vault.  The storefront is turned into a cookie shop as a cover for their operation.  The bank robbery idea goes sour, but ironically, the cookie shop flourishes, and the next thing you know, Ray and Frenchy are heading up their own giant cookie corporation.  Frenchy decides that she'd like to join the ranks of the classy elite, so she buddies with an art dealer (played by Hugh Grant) and asks him to teach her how to live a lifestyle of affluence.  Ray wants no part of this lifestyle, and his relationship with Frenchy begins to suffer.  By the end of the movie, their cookie empire crumbles and Frenchy finds out that the art dealer is using her for her money, so Ray and Frenchy must come together again to salvage some money and escape to Florida.All of this seems like alot to cram into a movie that's only 95 minutes long, but it all happens very fast, and in a very comical way.

524493,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00003CXGR,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 3]","My friend Aleta and I have remained hard core Woody Allen films over the decades. We see his films together in the theater now and, typically, this last summer, we saw this one in an empty theater.  We were the only viewers.  In a way this was good because we found it utterly hilarious.  We were laughing loudly the whole time. Allen has unfortunately played to mainly empty theaters in Cleveland though ever since his disastrous split from Mia Farrow.  Aleta and I never judge our artists by their personal lives though; we're into them solely for their work.  It is hard to see how you can go wrong with this movie.  One absolutely delightful aspect was seeing Hugh Grant be enough of a sport to satirically tackle his own romantic leading man image. He is the &quot;romantic rat&quot; for a change, an English art dealer who courts Allen's wife, played by Tracey Ullmann. He also does none of his usual humble bumbling and shows how extremely polished, suave and deceptive he can be.  How refreshing it also was to see Woody Allen paired with a female, Ullmann, who conceivably might really go out with him or marry him. It was quite a stretch to imagine Julia Roberts even going out with him as she did in Allen's &quot;Everyone Says I Love You.&quot; Elaine May was also a comic delight as Ullman's ditzy cousin who accompanies Allen to a really &quot;out there&quot; party event.  Allen and May I can also picture together and would love to see more of them on the screen together in the future.  The premise of the whole film is well known at this point.  Allen and Ullman get rich quick out of a cookie business built from a bank robbery that never came off.

The only thing some viewers might have a problem with is a fairly abrupt transition from the bank robbery-cookie business episode straight into their lives full tilt as the nouveau riche.  I didn't have any problem with it but jump cuts, from one big event in time to a separate big event in a separate time, generally don't bother me.

Allen plays an ex-con named Ray who, along with his buddies, sets up to tunnel underground and rob a bank.  His wife, Frenchy, sets up a cookie shop as the cover, but when the robbery attempt is spoiled, the cookie business takes off.Woody Allen brought together an amazing cast including Jon Lovitz who was absolutely perfect for his role, Michael Rappaport, and Hugh Grant.  Allen was perfect in the movie, as his one-liners are hysterical and pretty well-timed.  Tracy Ullman plays his wife, and is the perfect compliment to him.  However, Elaine May clearly stole the show, as the dim-witted cousin, May.  She was simply fantastic.The film was quite enjoyable, as it was a well-written story.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[1, 1]","Any Allen film has an interesting subtext often hidden to view for many of us, but which lies there quietly, onnoticed, and causing what some uncomprehending people perceive as ""slow, dragging"" sections.Here we learn that the worst and most effective and heartless thieves are the richest.The worst thieves in this film are the accountants, and the lawyers who front them to the CEO Frenchy Fox.What does this tell us about Allen's experience with lawyers and divorce accountants in the totaltiarian swindle of Connecticut Divorce Courts?The second worst thieves are well dressed socialites stelaing from one another. Notice Mr. Chi-chi wants to rob the Allen character for millios ot fnud a theatre in Aspen. Notice the Hugh Grant gigolo character smells millions from Frenchy. Neither succeed.The most incompetent criminals of coruse are the poor, who actually steal nothing, not even an emerald necklace, which turns out to be glass (could it be that Mr. Chi-chi had already replaced his wife's necklace with a cheap glass one?). And the poor are the ones who do jail time.This is a strong comment on the endemic injustice, corruption and inequality in contemporary America. This is the storyline which holds this rather disjointed movie together. Otherwise we see a series of fragments of other films which seem disconnected. The whole cookie empire blows the earlier bank robbery story (for which we assume this entire movie is titled) out of the water; the late introduction of the Grant character blows the cookie empire out of sight, and then we meet the magnificent ChiChi herself. This movie is like six in one, unless we understand the underlying subtext.I did not find the ending line, stolen from the Honeymooners, convincing, but the rest is pure gold, once you see the subtext. Our corporate aristocracy are the smallest time thieves in the world. And now we have Cheney's Halliburton!(Notice the jungle motif of the nouveau riche decor, and remember Farrow's lines in Broadway Danny Rose in which she states she always wanted to do an apartment in this motif.

The jump cutting is gone, the shaky camera is nowhere to be seen, the obscure artistic allusions completely absent. Instead, Allen packs this little gem with one of the best ensemble casts he's had in years, including the amazingly-talented Tracey Ullman (who seems to have been made to play opposite Woody), the endearingly idiosyncratic Elaine May (another Allen first) and the sophisticated straight foil Hugh Grant.Critics heralding the return of the early and funny Allen fail to notice that this isn't exactly a nostalgic trip through the world of Bananas or Love and Death. On the contrary, patches of warmth and sweetness are all over the place -- sure there are more sight gags here than in his last five films combined, but sympathetic and believable characterization is also here in buckets. Think of it as a funnier, less earnest Hannah and Her Sisters, sure to become one of its director's most beloved films in years to come.

Much to Ray's surprise, Frenchy's cookies become a huge success and after the bank idea falls through, the cookies are what makes the fortune that Ray was seeking.Although the movie starts out well, it quickly takes a turn for the worse. I am a big fan of Woody Allen's and I have seen many of his films. The only other time that I have been this disappointed in one of his plots was when I watched Company Man. The dialogue in Small Time Crooks was clever and entertaining as usual, at least in the beginning. The main problems I had with the movie was the casting and the storyline, which only got worse with each passing moment. The only actors that were able to keep up with Woody Allen were Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow, and Jon Lovitz who unfortunately did not stay throughout the film. I strongly believe that the movie would have been a bit better had they been included in the later parts of the movie. At least this supposed comedy would have actually been amusing. Hugh Grant's character, David, was the second most interesting to watch but his character was dismissed too quickly as well. Tracey Ullman and Elaine May are not very good actresses and looked even less talented working alongside Woody Allen and Hugh Grant.Despite the few good points, Small Time Crooks just was not as good as most of Woody Allen's movies.

The film is a departure from some of his more recent work and more like his earlier film TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN with Louise Lasseter. His existential tone is not obvious, though not completely missing either.SMALL TIME CROOKS is downright slapstick early on, and then the film takes a subtle and serious twist. In some places I laughed so hard I dampened my drawers--and believe me some of these folks wear drawers while others are supposedly top drawer. In a sense the film is a spoof on class snobbery.Whether she is making dough or not, the clothing the fabulous Frenchie (Tracy Ullman) wears is vintage. Frenchie began her career as a topless go-go girl in New Jersey, where Woody's character met her when he was working as a numbers runner. The lime-green stretch pants she sports while preparing his sausage-meatball meals served with a plate stacked high with white Wonder bread leave nothing to the imagination.Elaine Stritich and Elaine May and the perennial George Grizzard are all aging members of the NYC Manhattan upper crust--all of whom take an interest in the new cookie-fortune magnate Frenchie because they're after her dough for &quot;charitable&quot; purposes.Hugh Grant seems to have made the transition from roles portraying dignified innocents to roles where he maintains his some of his dignity. I used to like Grant in romantic leads like Chopinski in IMPROMTU before the LA fiasco. I wondered what he would do for a living after his encounter with Ms. Brown, not because I was sitting in moral judgment but because it was hard to believe he was innocent any longer.Grant is quite good in SMALL TIME CROOKS in which he plays a disengenious antique dealer/wine expert/former vineyard owner who has among other things spent time in a Buddist monastery in Japan.

No, it's just a return to his 1970s idiom, the broad, New York comedy, albeit revised and refined a little since those days. The casting of this director can sometimes seem repetitive, as we see the same faces appear again and again in his films, however he manages to inject new life here with Tracey Ullman and Hugh Grant, neither of whom is exactly challenged by the material. But it's good fun. You see Allen waving his hands about in parallel whilst talking about his neuroses, and there's a crime of the century caper plot to keep the jokes coming.

524504,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00003CXGR,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Even a dozen years ago, Woody Allen had achieved the rare status of being a movie maker who did not have to come up with a Hamlet or Glass Menagerie every time out. He could, as he did here, produce a light film, with no greater pretensions than to give his customers a pleasant time in a movie house or at home before the TV. In that aim, he has succeeded admirably. They say that the major reason he can turn out his films on a regular basis, with no fear that his financing will be pulled out from his next scheduled production, is that he always come out at or under budget. No huge costly overruns, no great risk for the producing organization. They know he might lose them some money, make them some money and, every now and then, make them a very comfortable amount of money. However, millions and tens of millions down the drain, is not what they can ever expect. As a result, he can get a few ideas, sometimes out of the Joe Miller book of old movie plots, put together a cast, usually almost entirely made up of skilled professionals, provide a background of wonderful old tunes, and then satisfy the core audience he has built up over a half-century or so. Probably, the occasional hits, add some new members to his permanent audience. The outcome is the kind of audience that 19th century novelists, today's mega-hit mystery, thriller, and romance story writers, and only a very few movie directors in the history of film could count on: an audience they know will be there for each of their  products as they came out, not an audience, as is true of most films and novels today, that must be built up for each new release.At any rate, for anyone who enjoys Tracy and Hepburn, Power and Loy, Cary Grant and almost anyone, this will be a pleasant, light-hearted, humorous and, yes, somewhat familiar hour and a half. In addition, what a pleasure to see the likes of the two Elaines, Strich and May, doing just a bit to show what mistresses they were of the medium, Tracey Ullman pairs well with Allen, the actor, and Hugh Grant is suitably suave and grasping as a nice guy who, maybe, isn't so nice.All in all, not in contention for Best Comedy of the Decade, but a winning, gratifying, ingratiating film to see.",4,Delightful Small Film by one of the Masters,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2223,"['Even', 'dozen', 'years', 'ago', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'had', 'achieved', 'rare', 'status', 'being', 'movie', 'maker', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'Hamlet', 'Glass', 'Menagerie', 'time', 'out', 'could', 'did', 'here', 'produce', 'light', 'film', 'greater', 'pretensions', 'give', 'customers', 'pleasant', 'time', 'movie', 'house', 'home', 'TV', 'aim', 'succeeded', 'admirably', 'say', 'major', 'reason', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'films', 'regular', 'basis', 'fear', 'financing', 'will', 'be', 'pulled', 'out', 'next', 'scheduled', 'production', 'always', 'come', 'out', 'budget', 'huge', 'costly', 'overruns', 'great', 'risk', 'producing', 'organization', 'know', 'might', 'lose', 'money', 'make', 'money', 'now', 'then', 'make', 'very', 'comfortable', 'amount', 'money', 'However', 'millions', 'tens', 'millions', 'drain', 'not', 'what', 'can', 'ever', 'expect', 'result', 'can', 'get', 'few', 'ideas', 'sometimes', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'book', 'old', 'movie', 'plots', 'put', 'together', 'cast', 'usually', 'almost', 'entirely', 'made', 'skilled', 'professionals', 'provide', 'background', 'wonderful', 'old', 'tunes', 'then', 'satisfy', 'core', 'audience', 'built', 'up', 'half-century', 'so', 'Probably', 'occasional', 'hits', 'add', 'new', 'members', 'permanent', 'audience', 'outcome', 'kind', 'audience', '19th', 'century', 'novelists', 'today', 'mega-hit', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'romance', 'story', 'writers', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'movie', 'directors', 'history', 'film', 'could', 'count', 'audience', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'products', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'audience', 'true', 'most', 'films', 'novels', 'today', 'must', 'be', 'built', 'up', 'new', 'release.At', 'rate', 'anyone', 'who', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'Power', 'Loy', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'almost', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'pleasant', 'light-hearted', 'humorous', 'yes', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'hour', 'half', 'addition', 'what', 'pleasure', 'see', 'likes', 'two', 'Elaines', 'Strich', 'May', 'doing', 'just', 'bit', 'show', 'what', 'were', 'medium', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'well', 'Allen', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'suitably', 'suave', 'grasping', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'so', 'nice.All', 'not', 'contention', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Decade', 'winning', 'gratifying', 'ingratiating', 'film', 'see']",Small Time Crooks VHS

Sure, the premise of Small Time Crooks was interesting - but then I felt the same way when I saw it the FIRST time on television -  on Car 54, Where Are You? back in the 1950s! Created by Nat Hiken (who also wrote many episodes), that classic cop situation comedy had many very funny plots.Plots that included the one about the small band of crooks, three male and one female, that open a business next to a New York bank in order to break into the vault next door. But business gets too good, proving to be a huge distraction to the original plan of emptying the bank of its big bucks, and hilarity ensues.Sound familiar? It should - since Woody obviously lifted that entire scenario in order to make his far-inferior STC film! At first I thought maybe he wrote the original Car 54 script in question, and can therefore do whatever he wants to with his own property. But I checked it out, and no, he did not write that Car 54 script.(BTW, Tracey Ullman is also particularly terrible in this - she's a Brit playing an Italian who's named Frenchy - try figuring out THAT cultural mess!)So what happened Woody? Was the white paper in your typewriter that blank? Was your writers' block that insurmountable? Sure, one can always say it's not exactly script-stealing as long as a writer at least slightly changes a plot twist or a line of dialogue here or there, but c'mon, Woody, who did you think you'd fool?You're not known as a hack writer - you were once considered to be one of the premier comedy talents of the movies, not just in acting but in writing too!So again, we must all ask, Woody...  why?",2,Woody Rips Off Car 54,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1631,"['Why', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'Woody', 'Sure', 'premise', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'was', 'interesting', 'then', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'saw', 'FIRST', 'time', 'television', 'Car', '54', 'Are', 'back', '1950s', 'Created', 'Nat', 'Hiken', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'many', 'episodes', 'classic', 'cop', 'situation', 'comedy', 'had', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'plots.Plots', 'included', 'one', 'small', 'band', 'crooks', 'three', 'male', 'one', 'female', 'business', 'New', 'York', 'bank', 'order', 'break', 'vault', 'next', 'door', 'business', 'too', 'good', 'proving', 'be', 'huge', 'distraction', 'original', 'plan', 'emptying', 'bank', 'big', 'bucks', 'hilarity', 'ensues.Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'Woody', 'obviously', 'lifted', 'entire', 'scenario', 'order', 'make', 'far-inferior', 'STC', 'film', 'first', 'thought', 'maybe', 'wrote', 'original', 'Car', '54', 'script', 'question', 'can', 'therefore', 'do', 'own', 'property', 'checked', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'Car', '54', 'script', 'BTW', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'also', 'particularly', 'terrible', 'Brit', 'playing', 'Italian', 'who', 'named', 'Frenchy', 'try', 'figuring', 'out', 'cultural', 'mess', 'what', 'happened', 'Woody', 'Was', 'white', 'paper', 'typewriter', 'blank', 'Was', 'writers', 'block', 'insurmountable', 'Sure', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'say', 'not', 'exactly', 'script-stealing', 'as', 'long', 'writer', 'least', 'slightly', 'plot', 'twist', 'line', 'dialogue', 'here', 'there', ""c'mon"", 'Woody', 'who', 'did', 'think', ""'d"", 'fool', ""'re"", 'not', 'known', 'hack', 'writer', 'were', 'once', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'premier', 'comedy', 'talents', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'acting', 'writing', 'too', 'So', 'again', 'must', 'ask', 'Woody', 'why']",Small Time Crooks VHS

Together, they winningly play Ray and Frenchy, a vulgar, working-class married couple who rent a restaurant space in order to rob the bank next door. The twist is that Frenchy's cookie business thrives, and they become wealthy beyond their dreams. Written and directed by Allen, this surprisingly free-wheeling 2000 comedy contains little of the deeper life themes that Allen had been exploring for the previous two decades. For the most part, it represents a complete throwback to his first film as a director, the frenetic, nonsensical 1969's ""Take the Money and Run"", as both are character-driven slapstick farces with a slew of funny one-liners.The film starts out strong with Ray and his bumbling partners preparing the heist with every conceivable complication standing in their way, in particular, their own stupidity. The storyline makes a unique turn once Ray and Frenchy become successful. They open up a nationwide chain of cookie stores, move to the posh Upper East Side like the Jeffersons, and start hobnobbing with Manhattan's social elite. Their marriage begins to unravel when Frenchy becomes obsessed with being cultured, while Ray is happy to live his life the same way as before. I don't think the movie is consistently flat-out funny like Allen's earlier works, but it does boast a sterling comedy cast. Freed from his intellectual pretensions, Allen looks like he's having a good time playing the unapologetically guttural Ray. Sporting a convincing New Yawk accent, Ullman, the most chameleonic of comic mimics, dexterously captures the ongoing battle between Frenchy's aspirations for social acceptance and her innately tawdry sensibilities.Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz play Ray's trio of thick-skulled cohorts with &eacute;lan, though they unfortunately disappear for the film's second half. It's good to see Elaine May back onscreen playing Ray's ditzy cousin May, and her crack timing with Allen makes me wish she would resuscitate her clever comedy routines with her ex-husband, film director Mike Nichols. As Frenchy's Pygmalion teacher of art and manners, Hugh Grant plays to his suave persona with subtle venality. The film ends almost like a parable albeit with a hilarious development inspired by the cocktail party scene in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"". Allen must be quite a fan since he would later use the same plot device in ""Scoop"". This is lightweight fare though certainly among Allen's most entertaining movies of late.

524508,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXGR,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 3]","This film takes Woody Allen back to the mood of some of his earliest works, when he was more visceral than cerebral.  It is an amusing rags-to-riches-to-rags story that carries with it the subtle message that the acquisition of wealth doesn't automatically confer class and that class isn't necessarily desirable anyway.Allen sticks to slapstick themes in this story about a hapless couple that accidentally creates a mega-corporation out of a cookie store that is intended to be a front for a bank robbery.  Ray Winkler is a small time crook who rents the store because it is two doors down from the bank.  He intends to tunnel under the store and emerge in the bank vault while his wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) bakes cookies in the store above to avert suspicion.  Of course, the heist is botched, but the cookie store has lines around the block and goes national.With one outrageous skit after another, Allen examines the difference between class and wealth, as Ray and Frenchy try to fit into high society.  Ultimately, success becomes the Winkler's worst enemy as money buys them only misery.Allen applies his trademark manic-depressive portrayal this time to a crook that has big ideas ricocheting around a very empty skull.  Allen has perfected the tortured-soul routine, which I suspect is a persona not very far its performer's true self.  Tracey Ullman delivers an outstanding performance as Frenchy, trying desperately to pull off a societal con and remake herself into a modern Pygmalion.  Ullman offers a great portrayal of a woman who is street smart but nave about aristocratic ways.  She handles the emotional conflict superbly as she spurns Ray for not wanting to become what Frenchy herself, despite all her efforts, can never be.  Elaine May is also priceless as Frenchy's vacuous sister whose mindless chatter is often filled with pointed insight.There is much to enjoy about this straightforward comedy about simple people in extraordinary circumstances.  It is slapstick with a message, which makes it both funny and mentally appealing.  I rated it a 7/10.

524509,A3IXOTBQ767WJ7,B00003CXGR,Glen Eric Reed,"[3, 7]","Woody Allen has made a career - a rather successful one - out of variations on a theme. That theme usually centers around the same style of intellectual, neurotic character, more often than not played by Allen himself. In Small Time Crooks, he breaks out of that mold to play an incompetent, immoral, blue-collar criminal.This isn't entirely new territory for Allen. It was done rather successfully in the character of Virgil Starkwell in Take The Money And Run. This, however, was in one of his &quot;earlier, funnier&quot; films, where a shoestring plot served to hold together a series of hilarious gags like a misspelled hold-up note. In Small Time Crooks, Allen tries to moralize. He's done it successfully in the past, but this time, it results in a rare failure.The acting and directing, though somewhat flat, aren't to blame. The script, however, falls short of achieving its lofty goals. There are underlying themes of &quot;money corrupts,&quot; &quot;you can't teach an old dog new tricks,&quot; &quot;money can't buy happiness,&quot; and other horrendous clich&eacute;s.

I guess Allen had everything going for him in the seventies-after that decade, everything went downhill. I was unbelievably disappointed with &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot;. I thought it would be hilarious. It was, before the one-year jump. Afterwards, everything became incredibly insipid. Because the DVDs were all taken, I was resorted to renting the VHS tape. I was lucky, in a way, because I could stop the movie and take it out to see how much more I had to watch.  I have always enjoyed Allen's self-deprecating whining, but I found his character, Ray, hugely annoying. Ray's whining just grated on my nerves. This movie is just a mess. The plot is structureless, the characters prove to be more dimwitted than Frenchy's cousin, May, which I actually found to be the smartest one. Most of all what's got me steamed is that it has no moral at all. I LOVE movies with serious and funny morals. &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, and &quot;Interiors&quot; proved to have heartbreaking, beautiful morals. This particular movie is the very opposite! You can't relate to any of the characters. The plot is scattered. The dialogue proves to be annoying while trying to be funny.  Watch this movie only if you're vastly bored, but that might be a bad idea, since it would make you even more bored! You've been warned!!  You want wonderful, spellbinding, vivid Woody Allen?

524523,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00003CXGR,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","First, let me say I am NOT a Woody Allen fan.  I find far toomany of his films to be embarrassing and forced.  However,there is always an exception to the rule....and THIS is a filmwhich I recommend to anyone who wants to relax, have a goodtime, laugh a lot, and watch the logically, and hysterically-funny unfolding plot of a very, very, VERY funny movie!Poor Woody Allen!  His character here can't even rob a banksuccessfully...and his ""helpers"" only make things worse!  TracyUlman, as his wife, bakes cookies -- this is an IMPORTANT partof the beginning of the film, (I can see you're puzzled by this...but probably smiling already at the ridiculous juxtaposition of words).  To say WHY Ms. Ullman's baking cookiies is an important part of the beginning of the story would give away too much of the plot...but believe me, her cookies ARE very important.  Also -- you may never look at people who wear miner's hats the same way, ever again.....(?)  Yes, you read that correctly!HUGH GRANT, whose acting style -- and characters -- are mostly 180 degrees away from Woody Allen's, is also on board, in the latter part of the movie.  These three -- plus supporting players -- make this movie a truly PERFECT comedy.  What makes it a perfect comedy is that everything is so LOGICAL...no situation, no matter how ridiculous, seems forced.  It is the low-I.Q., (and really STUPID!), characters of the movie who commit these blunders....for them, the funny mistakes and hilarious consequences just come naturally.If you need a laugh...watch this movie.  If you think Woody Allen can only do movies with ""angst"" in them....watch this movie.  It is, in its own ""small"" way, one of the funniest movies ever made, and deserves a far wider audience.Enjoy it!  (And, if possible, have your favourite type of cookies on hand, to mumch while you watch!)  : ): ) .....  : ( ..... : ) .....  : ( .....  : ) ..... : ( .....pS:  A SERIOUS NOTE HERE, IF I MAY:  Looking at other reviews, mentioning that most of the characters in it had ""low-I.Q.s"", and the undeniable fact that these ""low-I.Q."" characters in the film DID do really STUPID things, led me to ponder upon, and realize the difference between being stupid, (whatever one's IQ), and low I.Q. people who happen to be retarded.  I myself have a cousin who is retarded -- slightly.  She has a job as a bus-girl in a restaurant...and everyone she works with likes her immensely.  She could easily become a waitress, with a rise in status and in pay...but the numerical calculations involved are beyond her (present!) mental capacity.  She was, however, quite smart enough to divorce a husband she found difficult to live with -- perhaps a little later than a person with an ""average"" IQ would -- but she did do it!  She KNOWS her limits, and lives within them -- though she is constantly striving to increase her mental skills....STUPID people, however, seem NOT to know their limits -- or realize they HAVE any limits, and so NEVER strive to get beyond them.  For instance, people with VERY high I.Q.s, in fact, were quite easily swindled by Bernard Madoff!  I happen to know I have a near-genuis I.Q. -- but I've made some REAL stupid blunders in my life.  However, I acknowlege these blunders and seek to improvemyself and not do such things again!  The STUPID people in the movie ""Small Time Crooks"" however, thought they needed no improvement in their mental skills.  No -- they weren't retarded. Their I.Q.s -- though perhaps higher than my cousin's -- however, were NOT put to good use. They did NOT know their limits, nor did they, (as my cousin has -- and as I have, too), strive to improve themselves in any way.  ""Why improve myself?"" these characters, (and real-life people like them), must think.  ""I'm perfect already!""  I suppose that's the difference between being merely retarded, and abysmally stupid -- in this movie, hysterically stupid --people.  Being swindled by someone like Bernard Madoff does not mean a person is stupid -- but believing oneself to be perfect, truly is.  Therein lies the difference.  Low-I.Q. has nothing, really, to do with stupidity.  But not being able to see that perhaps, just perhaps, one MIGHT be choosing the wrong thing do, has everything to do with it!Stupidity knows no I.Q.!",5,F U N N Y......F U N N Y.......F__U__N__N__Y_!!!!!  : ),1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,4269,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'NOT', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'find', 'far', 'toomany', 'films', 'be', 'embarrassing', 'forced', 'However', 'always', 'exception', 'rule', '.and', 'THIS', 'filmwhich', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'relax', 'have', 'goodtime', 'lot', 'watch', 'logically', 'hysterically-funny', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'very', 'very', 'VERY', 'funny', 'movie', 'Poor', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'rob', 'banksuccessfully', 'helpers', 'only', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'TracyUlman', 'wife', 'bakes', 'cookies', 'IMPORTANT', 'partof', 'beginning', 'film', 'can', 'see', ""'re"", 'puzzled', 'probably', 'smiling', 'already', 'ridiculous', 'juxtaposition', 'words', 'say', 'WHY', 'Ms.', 'Ullman', 'baking', 'cookiies', 'important', 'part', 'beginning', 'story', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'believe', 'cookies', 'ARE', 'very', 'important', 'Also', 'may', 'never', 'look', 'people', 'who', 'wear', 'miner', 'hats', 'same', 'way', 'ever', 'again', '..', 'Yes', 'read', 'correctly', 'HUGH', 'GRANT', 'acting', 'style', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', '180', 'degrees', 'away', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'also', 'board', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'three', 'supporting', 'players', 'make', 'movie', 'truly', 'PERFECT', 'comedy', 'What', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'everything', 'so', 'LOGICAL', 'situation', 'matter', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'forced', 'low-I.Q.', 'really', 'STUPID', 'characters', 'movie', 'who', 'commit', 'blunders', 'funny', 'mistakes', 'hilarious', 'consequences', 'just', 'come', 'naturally.If', 'need', 'laugh', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'movies', 'angst', '.watch', 'movie', 'own', 'small', 'way', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'far', 'wider', 'audience.Enjoy', 'possible', 'have', 'favourite', 'type', 'cookies', 'hand', 'mumch', 'watch', '..', '..', '..', '..', '..', '..pS', 'SERIOUS', 'NOTE', 'HERE', 'IF', 'MAY', 'Looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'mentioning', 'most', 'characters', 'had', 'low-I.Q.s', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'low-I.Q', 'characters', 'film', 'DID', 'do', 'really', 'STUPID', 'things', 'led', 'ponder', 'upon', 'realize', 'difference', 'being', 'stupid', 'IQ', 'low', 'I.Q', 'people', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'retarded', 'have', 'cousin', 'who', 'retarded', 'slightly', 'job', 'bus-girl', 'restaurant', 'everyone', 'likes', 'immensely', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'waitress', 'rise', 'status', 'pay', 'numerical', 'calculations', 'involved', 'are', 'present', 'mental', 'capacity', 'was', 'however', 'quite', 'smart', 'enough', 'divorce', 'husband', 'found', 'difficult', 'live', 'perhaps', 'little', 'later', 'person', 'average', 'IQ', 'would', 'did', 'do', 'KNOWS', 'limits', 'lives', 'constantly', 'striving', 'increase', 'mental', 'skills', '.STUPID', 'people', 'however', 'seem', 'NOT', 'know', 'limits', 'realize', 'HAVE', 'limits', 'so', 'NEVER', 'strive', 'get', 'instance', 'people', 'VERY', 'high', 'I.Q.s', 'fact', 'were', 'quite', 'easily', 'swindled', 'Bernard', 'Madoff', 'happen', 'know', 'have', 'near-genuis', 'I.Q', ""'ve"", 'made', 'REAL', 'stupid', 'blunders', 'life', 'However', 'acknowlege', 'blunders', 'seek', 'improvemyself', 'not', 'do', 'such', 'things', 'again', 'STUPID', 'people', 'movie', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'however', 'thought', 'needed', 'improvement', 'mental', 'skills', 'were', ""n't"", 'retarded', 'I.Q.s', 'perhaps', 'higher', 'cousin', 'however', 'were', 'NOT', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'did', 'NOT', 'know', 'limits', 'did', 'cousin', 'have', 'too', 'strive', 'improve', 'way', 'Why', 'improve', 'characters', 'real-life', 'people', 'must', 'think', ""'m"", 'perfect', 'already', 'suppose', 'difference', 'being', 'merely', 'retarded', 'abysmally', 'stupid', 'movie', 'hysterically', 'stupid', 'people', 'Being', 'swindled', 'someone', 'Bernard', 'Madoff', 'not', 'mean', 'person', 'stupid', 'believing', 'be', 'perfect', 'truly', 'Therein', 'difference', 'Low-I.Q', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'stupidity', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'perhaps', 'just', 'perhaps', 'one', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'choosing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'do', 'everything', 'do', 'Stupidity', 'I.Q']",Small Time Crooks VHS

524525,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00003CXGR,Randy Keehn,"[2, 2]","""Small Time Crooks"" is a unique type of love story that seems like a cross between ""Guys and Dolls"", ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"", and ""Take the Money and Run"".  I was going to add ""without the music"" but I really enjoyed the music in ""Small Time Crooks"" as I do with almost all of Woody Allen's post-""Annie Hall"" movies.This movie is more on the humorous side like the earlier Allen movies.  Woody's humor usually had a lot of political and mostly social satire as the core of his humor and ""Small Time Crooks"" is no exception.  What makes it a cut above some of his earlier comedies is his focus on the pitfalls of trying to become someone and/or something you're not and probably never will be.  Through this window, Allen is able to poke fun at both the wannabes and the established in High Society.The movie begins with a look at a bumbling small time crook named Ray Winkler, played by Woody Allen.  His ""gang"" is about as inept as he is (maybe even more so since they follow his lead).  The brilliant plan of theirs metamorphs itself into something else entirely and they all get a look at what they supposedly want out of life.  The problem is that their dreams were really just nightmares in disguise.Ray's wife Frenchy is the real lead in ""Small Time Crooks"" and it is she who develops the highest asperations.  Her reach for elegance extends well beyond Ray's bewilderment as to his own future.  In the end, they discover their own common wants and needs were in the familiar territory that they left behind.  I don't think I'm giving anything away with that synopsis because the movie's humor keeps us attentive throughout and can be enjoyed on its' own; with or without a morality play.  However, Woody Allen's genius as a director is that he cannot create a story without making a statement.

524529,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXGR,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","Though essentially a time-marking throwaway by writer/director Woody Allen, `Small Time Crooks' provides so many gems of performance that one can overlook the film's derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive. In this film, Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middle-aged angst in favor of a more straightforward, plot-driven comedy, paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier well-known theatrical and cinematic works.For example, the first half hour of the movie plays like a stateside version of the 1950's Italian comedy `Big Deal on Madonna Street' as a team of bumbling, far-from-intelligent small time crooks, led by ex-con Ray Winkler (Allen), sets up a cookie store as a `front' so they can drill a tunnel into a bank a mere two or three shops down the road. Then the plot of the film suddenly shifts gears when that plan falls apart and the gang hits pay dirt with the surprising success of the cookies that Ray's uncultured but well meaning wife, the former topless dancer Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), is assiduously baking and selling. The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants - a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clich&eacute;d rags-to-riches theme so essential to our concept of the beloved American Dream.With this plot switch, we leave Madonna Street and head into `Unsinkable Molly Brown/Pygmalion/Educating Rita' territory as the vulgar, uncouth Frenchy realizes that, even with all her suddenly acquired wealth, she cannot possibly gain true acceptance from the elite cultural snobs she so desperately wants to impress without a little assistance from her own personal Henry Higgins, who arrives in the form of an art dealer named David played by the suave Hugh Grant. Thus, as Frenchy branches out and begins to open herself up to new cultural experiences, the couple begins to drift apart as Ray comes to crave the return to the simpler life of spaghetti and meatball dinners he knows they have left far behind.Had Allen been able to sustain the cleverness and bite that inform that `60 Minutes' segment throughout the length of the entire film, `Small Time Crooks' might have emerged as more than just the mere piece of entertaining puffery it ultimately is. Indeed, we find ourselves laughing only occasionally and often at jokes or sight gags that would barely register a chuckle in one of Allen's more sophisticated, more edgy and more character-driven works. Special note must, however, be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy's adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her `A New Leaf' roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film. Unfortunately, Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, as members of Ray's gang, though they all three give outstanding performances, aren't given enough screen time to really let their talents for comic characterization take flight. Hugh Grant is essentially Hugh Grant - which is to say that he fulfills the requirements of his part without having to stretch his thespian muscles too much.The success or failure of a comedy is ultimately determined by how often it is able to elicit laughs from the person watching it.

Of course, nothing goes as planned, and with one outrageous skit after another, Allen examines the difference between class and wealth, as Ray and Frenchy try to retro-fit into high society.The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants &euro;"" a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clichd rags-to-riches theme so essential to the beloved concept of the &quot;American Dream.&quot;Special note must be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy's adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her &quot;A New Leaf&quot; roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film.

It's a slapsticky comedy that will remind fans of his earlier work (particularly &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask&quot;, &quot;Bananas&quot;, etc.), but whereas those films framed its comedy within a fresh and original concept, the new film plays as a broad, familiar comedy comprised of more one-liners than you can possibly keep track of.  With that said, this film isn't as bad as most film critics have made it out to be.  The jokes come fast and often, and they crackle for the most part.  The second half of the film loses some steam but I still heard myself laughing out loud on more than several occasions.  I loved the bickering between Tracy Ullman and Woody.  I loved the buddies Ray brings along on his bungled caper (too bad they were given such limited screen time, especially Jon Lovitz).

The cookie bakery his wife, played by Tracy Ullman, is using as a front for the operation ends up becoming an overnight success which turns them into millionaires.From that point on, the movie stopped being entertaining.  It really does just come to a screeching halt.  Practically nothing interesting happens from this point on with Woody and Tracy, and the rest of the cast is pretty much discarded with.  There was far too much of Tracy in this movie and Hugh Grant just bored me everytime he was on screen.  Jon Lovitz, Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow are completely underused as Woody's gang.  Elaine May actually turned out to be pretty funny as Tracy's dim bulb cousin and should have had more screen time.I was really hoping to see more of the old Woody spirit in here, but it just felt really unimaginative.

524534,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,B00003CXGR,theboombody,"[3, 5]","This film kind of reminds me of Steve Martin's career shift.  At first Martin's roles were downright hilarious, but as time went by, he shifted from being hilarious to what I would call, ""charming.""  Instead of making you laugh, his movies make you smile.  Woody Allen seems to be exploring this kind of style in Small Time Crooks.Unlike Allen's most loved films, this one isn't chock full of witty jokes.  Instead, it's full of lighthearted and amusing situations that keep the viewer entertained without actually delivering big laughs.Allen plays Ray, an ex-criminal who attempts a bank robbery.  He goes about it in a rather simple manner - buying a place close to the bank and digging an underground tunnel.  To avoid suspicion, he disguises the place he buys as a cookie store.  Unexpectedly, the fake cookie store actually ends up selling a lot of cookies, while the tunnel idea fails miserably.  Ray and his wife become exceedingly rich and start growing apart as a result.  Eventually their business fails at the hands of fraudulent accountants, and when this happens, the two come back together again.  It's heart-warming.I was surprised to see trailers of this on TV, and I wanted to go see the film in a theater, but I'm glad I didn't.  It wasn't really what I expected, so I was somewhat let down.  However, after seeing it two or three times, I've grown to like it somewhat, because of its charm and its calming factor.  For instance, there are a few scenes near the end where Ray dates his wife's sister but the storyline doesn't go anywhere.  The scenes just drift around calmly.  The movie is just very calm like that.  Even during scenes like the flood in the cookie store basement, and the bankruptcy of the cookie company, the movie maintains that calm feeling throughout.  You never really think, ""Oh my gosh, so-and-so's life is ruined,"" since their worst point is at the beginning of the film.If you want a calm, charming movie with a PG rating (my favorite rating) I highly recommend Small Time Crooks.
