This is only one track and not worth it.  This is a good song off an album that is loosing it's zip.  The video is a standard tool video, claymation and bizarre images.  However, other than the first track, the rest is just a waste of time and money.  The audio comentary is not funny, and makes tool look like fools (but with a some of my money, and me feeling used.)  The bonus remix is nothing but an extension 8 minutes of ambient noise before the same song. If you want real trance like meditation like music, listen to Neurosis, they have been doing this for 15 years and are a lot better at it.  Tool better have a heck of a next album to dig themselves out of this embarassment. The only reason I do not give this a 1 is that this video is nice to have near salival in my collection.",2,save the cash,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,876,"['Let', 'make', 'short', 'First', 'are', 'fair', 'weather', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'waist', 'money', 'only', 'one', 'track', 'not', 'good', 'song', 'album', 'loosing', 'zip', 'video', 'standard', 'tool', 'video', 'claymation', 'bizarre', 'images', 'However', 'other', 'first', 'track', 'rest', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'audio', 'comentary', 'not', 'funny', 'tool', 'look', 'fools', 'money', 'feeling', 'used', 'bonus', 'remix', 'nothing', 'extension', '8', 'minutes', 'ambient', 'noise', 'same', 'song', 'want', 'real', 'trance', 'meditation', 'music', 'listen', 'Neurosis', 'have', 'been', 'doing', '15', 'years', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'Tool', 'better', 'have', 'heck', 'next', 'album', 'dig', 'embarassment', 'only', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'give', '1', 'video', 'nice', 'have', 'near', 'salival', 'collection']",N/A

955581,AZ7HIM13RBIAY,B000C6NPJU,"Francisco Llanas ""unfooled""","[2, 9]","The Menu and 1st and 3rd choices on the DVD are nicely put together and truly is an extension of Lateralus. I'm surprised at the commentary and disappointed that it's something I turned off within the first 20 seconds. I was hoping for something tremendous and got something that frankly was a waste of audio track. What I think would have been cool is to have something LIKE ""Faaip De Oiad"" on the alternate audio track. Something paranormal, something unexplained. Or maybe commentary from the Director, the actors, the costume techs,. . .anyone but who wound up doing it. Yeah you know tool, blah blah blah, the record industry sucks, blah blah blah, hey those look like grapes, blah blah blah. if anything, the commentary that is on the disc cheapens the masterpiece that is the video. it even cheapens the audio on the 3rd menu choice (which if you listen for long enough, is VERY addicting!) I read reviews that say the commentary is funny. . .that makes me sad. it would have been better if it was incoherent rambling. unfortunately you hear exactly what they're saying in full digital quality. Aside from the 2nd menu item on the DVD, this is a great deal on Amazon, and for the video alone, should find it's way to your Tool Library. I eagerly await all the Tool videos collected on one DVD with better (or even NO) commentary. before you 'fans' tell me, ""you don't get it"" You're right; I don't get it. the video is amazing, a masterpiece, every frame could be a work of art, The commentary is stupid and almost makes fun of the video. Why would I take an original Mucha print, and pour paint thinner on it?

Ratliff,"[15, 18]","I'll start off with saying the video for Parabola is very interesting (as are all of Tool's videos) and that is why I was compelled to get this DVD.  I wanted the video for my own collection and was also excited to see the ""bonus features.""The only good thing I can say other than what I just did is that this was bought for me as a present, so I didn't waste any money on it.Now to the bad.  You have a menu that gives you the option of the video, a remix of the song, and the commentary.  I decided to try the remix first.  Most.  Boring.  Thing.  Ever.  My boyfriend and I were watching it, and for like, the first three or four minutes it's basically nothing, then it changes a tiny bit, making us think it would actually get good, and then it ends.  We were pretty disappointed.  But not to worry!  We still can watch the commentary and get an insightful look into the video and what it's about!  NO.  As someone else described him, it's some jerk-off who has no business commenting on anything Tool does because based off what he says in the commentary (e.g. ""here come the grapes of doom"") I find it hard to believe he even understands any of their songs.  In summation, I thought this would be cool to have being a hardcore Tool fan, but you really shouldn't bother.  You end up irritated at how big a disappointment it is.",2,"Good video, dissapointing release",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1331,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'video', 'Parabola', 'very', 'interesting', 'are', 'Tool', 'videos', 'why', 'was', 'compelled', 'get', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'video', 'own', 'collection', 'was', 'also', 'excited', 'see', 'bonus', 'features', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'other', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'was', 'bought', 'present', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'it.Now', 'bad', 'have', 'menu', 'option', 'video', 'remix', 'song', 'commentary', 'decided', 'try', 'remix', 'first', 'Most', 'Boring', 'Thing', 'Ever', 'boyfriend', 'were', 'watching', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'minutes', 'basically', 'nothing', 'then', 'tiny', 'bit', 'making', 'think', 'would', 'actually', 'get', 'good', 'then', 'were', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'not', 'worry', 'still', 'can', 'watch', 'commentary', 'get', 'insightful', 'look', 'video', 'what', 'NO', 'someone', 'else', 'described', 'jerk-off', 'who', 'business', 'commenting', 'anything', 'Tool', 'based', 'off', 'what', 'commentary', 'e.g', 'here', 'come', 'grapes', 'doom', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'even', 'songs', 'summation', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'have', 'being', 'hardcore', 'Tool', 'fan', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'end', 'up', 'irritated', 'how', 'big', 'disappointment']",N/A

As with Maynard's lyrics, Adam spent a great deal of time, thought and energy, to make such a wonderful video. Perhaps another way of Tool to get my money, making me such a tool (no pun intended). If you enjoy Tool, and haven't seen this video, check it out, on freaking ""You Tube"" if you have to.

955584,A3XHHSLKLW7XX,B000C6NPJU,Sith,"[0, 9]","I don't really know why many people complaining about these 2 DVDs single, many people said that Tool tried to rip off with no much extras on the dvd, some said why they put 2 DVDs into 1 DVD. I can answer your questions that 'Yes ! Because this is Tool ! Not that other cheap Rock band, you can find everywhere !'  I would not be happy if there'll be 5 remixes on each dvd, it would be a piece of junk !! I think if you are the person who really like art (not just only tool's music) will understand how worth of these separate DVDs.  They are different song, they are DVD single (do you know the meaning of 'single' ?), they have their own theme,imagine and artwork. So why should it comes together in 1 DVD ? I even laugh when somebody said he was lucky that he did not buy these DVDs because there're not much extras so that he can burn it from his freid's copy.  What are you talking about ??
