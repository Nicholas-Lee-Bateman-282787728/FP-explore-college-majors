We learn very little of the inner life of Paul, of his relationship with Jesus, and of his compelling need to spread the ""good news"" everywhere. It's all very external--he does this and he does that. But the spiritual force and the realizations that drive him are omitted. Also, his transformation from Christian hater to Christian lover is too abrupt. I wanted to to see a believable gradual transformation that is deeply rooted in love for God--from doubt to uncertainty to understanding to belief to conviction to faith to self-sacrifice and final martydom. The character of Peter is one note--self-guilt, self-dissatisfaction, and self-abasement.

183491,A1NX95COH18OPZ,1563641844,C. Durgin,"[7, 7]",This is a pretty good movie overall in that the acting is very well done as it should be since some top notch actors and actresses participated in the project done in the early 1980s.  The story lines stay true to the bible as we know it all the while bringing to life the human beings involved in starting Christianity.  Saying this is the best movie on the New Testament after Jesus isn't really saying much at least for me because I don't know of any others but this is a good one that stands alone on its own merits.  But there are two major discrepancies.  One is the portrayal of Peter as not doing all that much in the beginning which may have been true to some degree.  But Peter was actually first to be directed to go to the Gentiles (Cornelius having seen a vision from a rooftop and ministering to them ref Acts 10).  The other is the true power of God which seemed to be downplayed or explainable in what little it was shown.  Supernatural healings and miracles in the ministries of both Peter and Paul were not shown at all.  It is great at being historically accurate and giving reasonable human qualities to major biblical figures but fails in showing the works of God involved in the early church and might I add still works today.,3,Peter & Paul (the Movie),1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1248,"['pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'actresses', 'participated', 'project', 'done', 'early', '1980s', 'story', 'lines', 'stay', 'true', 'bible', 'know', 'while', 'bringing', 'life', 'human', 'beings', 'involved', 'starting', 'Christianity', 'Saying', 'best', 'movie', 'New', 'Testament', 'Jesus', ""n't"", 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'others', 'good', 'one', 'alone', 'own', 'merits', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'discrepancies', 'One', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'beginning', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'degree', 'Peter', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'be', 'directed', 'go', 'Gentiles', 'Cornelius', 'having', 'seen', 'vision', 'rooftop', 'ministering', 'ref', '10', 'other', 'true', 'power', 'God', 'seemed', 'be', 'downplayed', 'explainable', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'shown', 'Supernatural', 'healings', 'miracles', 'ministries', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'great', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate', 'giving', 'reasonable', 'human', 'qualities', 'major', 'biblical', 'figures', 'fails', 'showing', 'works', 'God', 'involved', 'early', 'church', 'might', 'add', 'still', 'today']",N/A

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is completely omitted along with stories from the lives of these two apostles where the Baptism is revealed or spoken of.  This was no surprise as those portaying the two great apostles are not saved; however, as the baptism in the Holy Spirit was an intregal part of their story - indeed it is the leading arguement for evangelizing the lost gentiles within the book of Acts.  Peter's trance and vision of the sheet let down, followed by His being led of the Spirit into the home of gentiles where a great number of them were baptised in the Holy Spirit ((Acts 10:9-48)and this story is entirely ommited from the movie) was, according to St. Luke's 'Acts' a leading point of discussion at the council in Jerusalem (Acts 15:7&8).There was, further, a complete lack of the miraculous, or anything else that gave credence to the gospel in those early days of the church (yet the power of God wrought toward the gentiles was another leading point in the Jerusalem council (Acts 15:12)).  I counted one miracle done by Paul, which was only worked into the film because it was an absoolutely necesarry plot point, yet, again according to Acts both Paul and Peter were so anointed of the Holy Spirit that scores of miracles were wrought by them constantly (Acts 5:12,15&16; Acts 19:11&12).The portrayal of the early church as a whole was clearly a secular view: the early church fathers were portrayed as cowering zealots attempting to start a religious 'movement' by human power, rather than the faith pioneers revealed in the book of Acts.If you are content with a powerless gospel, built on fleshly human attempts at godliness rather than a relationship with the living God, you may be satisfied with this movie.

If you're interested in seeing Biblical characters brought to life on screen, I would suggest ""Quo Vadis"" or ""Passion of the Christ"" perhaps. This movie twists Scripture to create a rivalry and hostility between Peter and Paul that didn't exist. Until the final scenes, it portrays Peter as a mopish, do-nothing, cowardly dunderhead who is constantly bemoaning how worthless he is in comparison to Paul. This is the Peter who was the leader of the Apostles, who boldly preached to Jerusalem on Pentecost, whose very shadow was reputed to heal the sick, the Peter through whose mouth ""the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel""? (Acts 15:7) This would be like a movie portraying Napoleon as an unassuming little milquetoast. Strange. Almost as weird as that was the bizarre histrionics and speech patterns Anthony Hopkins chose to attribute to Paul. When he had to act angry, Hopkins did an exact impression of the role he played as Adolf Hitler in 1980's ""The Bunker"", ranting and raving apoplectically like the Fuhrer in his last days. (I was always expecting him to start screaming about the Russians). When conversing normally, he spoke in a very disconcerting, clipped manner reminiscent of a bad William Shatner impersonator.

Robert Foxworth's Peter is also interestingly done but our information is lacking about his ministry when he disappears after Chapter 7 in the book of Acts. Therefore the movie focuses on Paul's attempt to unite Jew,Greek and Roman in a trinity of new Christian faith and this film delivers on that concept, even though it is somewhat romanticized. Some very effective scenes remind you of ""Jesus of Nazareth"". One suprise is when Paul is being confronted by his ""thorn in the flesh"" while consulting with Barnabas and Mark, you hear a mysterious sound that is tough to catch but Mark inquires what it is to which Paul replies ""just an animal"". (Actually it is a devil). Also there is a great confrontation with the woman who throws her voice into statues and animals to ridicule Paul's ministry. When Paul tells her that she won't have the power to do that again it is effective enough to put a fear of the Lord into you! We get to see the journeys of Paul and Barnabas (you will notice a gradual decline in the richness of Barnabas shown in his clothing) , we meet Luke, Timothy, Silas, Mark and get a basic grip on what the spread of Christianity was all about in the ancient world. Nero's fay behavior will get on your nerves especially when he is engaged in conversations about Paul with his jailer. Paul's triumphant entry as a prisoner into Rome will remind you of Jesus and his entry into Jerusalem so much so that it can bring a tear to your eye. The original scene of Paul forgiving the Axeman when he is beheaded has been removed for some reason on this DVD.
