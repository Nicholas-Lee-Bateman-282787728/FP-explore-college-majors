750892,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B00008ZL5I,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[1, 1]","(THE VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY - 1973 - Spanish with English dubbing / Widescreen presentation / 80 minutes) A tour bus of passengers is heading up a mountainous terrain en route to an estate mansion and suddenly the driver drops dead behind the wheel. One of the other passengers quickly commandeers the vehicle before it careens over the cliff, killing the rest. Obviously shaken by the event, the remaining commuters decide to drive to a local town they see a sign for (but isn't on their map) rather than travel for hours to their final destination. Little do they know that the nearby town will be the final destination for most of them.When they get to town, they're surprised to find the town empty, though it's still daylight (nighttime would have been a dead giveaway as to where this was heading). They enter the Inn / Tavern, and it too, is empty, but there's plenty of spirits (the alcoholic kind) to keep the men pacified. Moments later, they meet another male traveler, who has ventured all over the place, and confirms that they indeed are apparently alone. After much imbibing, they all retire to various bedrooms to get some deserved rest.When the clock strikes midnight, the sole sleeping drunkard of the group is startled and awoken downstairs at the bar, and decides to stretch his limbs outside, first to discover that the bus drivers body has disappeared from the bus, and after lighting a cigarette, finds himself being stalked by odd, menacing figures that emerge from the shadows, and it isn't long before he finds himself a midnite snack. To clarify, he's the snack.The next morn, we find the town is indeed populated and the apologetic mayor explains that the townfolk were attending a funeral of one of their own at the nearby cemetery, hence the lack of a welcoming committee. The town is governed by `The Countess' (Helga Line, a lovely staple in Eurohorror films from the 60's/70's) who invites the troupe to her mansion for the duration of their stay, even offering oodles of cash to get them to stay for a spell (pun intended). Everyone has a price, so lingering seems most lucrative, albeit unwise. (If they left, we wouldn't have much of a movie, would we?). Food, especially meat, is a shortage here (for reasons unknown), which means that periodically we come up short a villager or three, but the guests are infatuated with the cuisine as the chef is showered with compliments. But one by one, the guests are picked off and cast to the villagers as finger food or fall prey to the seductions of the dear Countess. At least they are treated to her succulent endowments before being bled, so that amounts to something, doesn't it? How many times have all you red-blooded gents out there thought to yourself, ""I'd die for a piece of that""... well, here's your chance.The few survivors are desperate to get out of Dodge, and there's a nice frantic finale as they attempt to do so - to say more would spoil it. A somewhat predictable though enjoyable ending is unveiled, and end credits roll. All in all, another adequate endeavor from director Leon Klimovsky, who made quite a bunch of Euro and gothic horror films during this era. The desensitized young'ins of today won't find much merit here, as there's not a lot of gore, torture, and women kept in cages to keep them amused, but for those a bit older who are rabid and toothy for Eurohorror from the 70's, this one's a nice way to spend a quiet night at home - Vampires, cannibalism, ghouls and Eurovixen nudity - you know, the simple pleasures in life...",4,So Where's The Orgy???,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,3538,"['VAMPIRES', 'NIGHT', 'ORGY', '1973', 'Spanish', 'English', 'dubbing', '/', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', '/', '80', 'minutes', 'tour', 'bus', 'passengers', 'heading', 'up', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'route', 'estate', 'mansion', 'suddenly', 'driver', 'dead', 'wheel', 'One', 'other', 'passengers', 'quickly', 'vehicle', 'cliff', 'killing', 'rest', 'Obviously', 'shaken', 'event', 'remaining', 'commuters', 'decide', 'drive', 'local', 'town', 'see', 'sign', ""n't"", 'map', 'rather', 'travel', 'hours', 'final', 'destination', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'nearby', 'town', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'destination', 'most', 'them.When', 'get', 'town', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'find', 'town', 'empty', 'still', 'daylight', 'nighttime', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'where', 'was', 'heading', 'enter', 'Inn', '/', 'Tavern', 'too', 'empty', 'plenty', 'spirits', 'alcoholic', 'kind', 'keep', 'men', 'pacified', 'Moments', 'later', 'meet', 'male', 'traveler', 'who', 'ventured', 'place', 'confirms', 'indeed', 'are', 'apparently', 'alone', 'much', 'imbibing', 'retire', 'various', 'bedrooms', 'get', 'deserved', 'rest.When', 'clock', 'strikes', 'midnight', 'sole', 'sleeping', 'drunkard', 'group', 'startled', 'awoken', 'downstairs', 'bar', 'stretch', 'limbs', 'first', 'discover', 'bus', 'drivers', 'body', 'disappeared', 'bus', 'lighting', 'cigarette', 'being', 'stalked', 'odd', 'menacing', 'figures', 'emerge', 'shadows', ""n't"", 'long', 'midnite', 'snack', 'clarify', 'snack.The', 'next', 'morn', 'find', 'town', 'indeed', 'populated', 'apologetic', 'mayor', 'townfolk', 'were', 'attending', 'funeral', 'one', 'own', 'nearby', 'cemetery', 'hence', 'lack', 'welcoming', 'committee', 'town', 'governed', 'Countess', 'Helga', 'Line', 'lovely', 'staple', 'Eurohorror', 'films', ""60's/70"", 'who', 'troupe', 'mansion', 'duration', 'stay', 'even', 'offering', 'oodles', 'cash', 'get', 'stay', 'spell', 'pun', 'intended', 'Everyone', 'price', 'lingering', 'most', 'lucrative', 'albeit', 'unwise', 'left', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'movie', 'would', 'Food', 'especially', 'meat', 'shortage', 'here', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'periodically', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'villager', 'three', 'guests', 'are', 'infatuated', 'cuisine', 'chef', 'showered', 'compliments', 'one', 'one', 'guests', 'are', 'picked', 'cast', 'villagers', 'finger', 'food', 'fall', 'prey', 'seductions', 'dear', 'Countess', 'least', 'are', 'treated', 'succulent', 'endowments', 'being', 'bled', 'amounts', 'something', ""n't"", 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'red-blooded', 'gents', 'there', 'thought', 'yourself', ""'d"", 'die', 'piece', 'well', 'here', 'chance.The', 'few', 'survivors', 'are', 'desperate', 'get', 'Dodge', 'nice', 'frantic', 'finale', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'enjoyable', 'ending', 'unveiled', 'end', 'credits', 'roll', 'adequate', 'endeavor', 'director', 'Leon', 'Klimovsky', 'who', 'made', 'quite', 'bunch', 'Euro', 'gothic', 'horror', 'films', 'era', 'desensitized', ""young'ins"", 'today', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'merit', 'here', 'not', 'lot', 'gore', 'torture', 'women', 'kept', 'cages', 'keep', 'amused', 'bit', 'older', 'who', 'are', 'rabid', 'toothy', 'Eurohorror', '70', 'one', 'nice', 'way', 'spend', 'quiet', 'night', 'home', 'Vampires', 'cannibalism', 'ghouls', 'Eurovixen', 'nudity', 'know', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'life']",Vampires Night Orgy

750894,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B00008ZL5I,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","Disclaimer: The version of 'Vampire's Night Orgy' that I saw is included on a single disc, five movie collection titled 'Vampire Collection Volume 2', which is not available on Amazon in the exact format which I own.  I cannot comment on the quality of the item as sold on this product page; my review is only concerned with the entertainment value of the film.'Vampire's Night Orgy', directed by the incredibly prolific Leon Klimovsky (75 titles in 30 years!), and starring no one I've ever heard of, is, I think, a fairly typical example of cheap European horror films from the early '70's - the plot moves along in a predictable way, even as the characters often do inexplicable things, and there are moments that are almost creepy, followed immediately by developments that leave viewers scratching their heads.  I believe it's rare for these films to get the release format that is going to put them in the best light, and we're probably never going to get 'director's cuts' or even unedited versions - one thing that must plague these releases is that they were chopped and censored even on their initial release, and the integrity of the films have never been restored.  At least those are my guesses, since too often there are elements in these films that are unexplainable any other way.This particular example of 'Euro-horror' doesn't stand out, but I don't think it's a complete write-off either.  A busload of domestic workers are en route to a new employer when their driver has a heart attack and dies.  Because one of the workers has her young daughter with her, the rest of the workers put the dead man in the back of the bus and tell her he is sleeping.  Although I don't know what else they would do in this situation, the entire episode seems a little bizarre, but anyway...one of the soon-to-be handymen (who has an almost uncanny resemblence to Charles Bronson) takes over the driving responsibilities.  Soon he comes to a crossroad - one way leads to their destination, the other to a town which is much closer.  Logically, since they have a dead man in the back, the elect to go to the closest place and report their problems - and here is where the troubles begin.It would be impossible to sell this movie to those that don't already enjoy these types of films, but I did like it in a roundabout way.  When the workers pull into town it seems deserted, so they take it upon themselves to hole up for the night in the town's hotel - it isn't until the next evening that they meet any of the town's inhabitants.  The explanation is that every single soul had been at the cemetery, observing a special service.  Yeah, right.  This is a movie titled Vampire's Night Orgy, after all.  The workers eventually find out that the town is run by 'The Countess', who turns out to be the chief vampire - the rest of the citizens are more like sub-vampires who feast on the remains of her dinner...guests.  Of course the viewer learns this well before the workers, who do eventually figure it out, one by one.Strange quirkiness abounds; our hero first meets our heroine by observing her through a hole between the hotel rooms as she jammies up and gets ready for bed.  Even after they meet, he continues to watch over her, which is creepy not in a vampiric way but in a creep kind of way.  And even though our workers are outnumbered hundreds to one, the entire town goes to extreme lengths to cover up what's really going on - only after nearly all the normal people have been 'had over for dinner' do the last few decide it's in their best interest to leave town.All in all, there's enough here to recommend it to viewer's who are already predisposed to cheesy seventies horror films from Europe (in this case, Spain).  What's unfortunate is that there doesn't really seem to be a release that's worth spending much money on.  My copy comes from a company called TGG Direct, or also known as The Garr Group.  This transfer is extremely poor, with the lighting and sound almost making the action indecipherable at timees, and surveying other reviews, it sounds doubtful that any of the other editions are any better, includingThe Vampires Night Orgy (1973) [Remastered Edition].  It is also available on the Mill CreekPure Terror - 50 Movie Pack- I've been pleased with the 12 movie packs of Mill Creek's that I've watched so far, so perhaps there is hope that they got their transfer from a better source.  I wouldn't hold my breath though.  What would really be interesting would be to watch this film with the night scenes visible and the original Spanish language track and subtitles - in other words, to see it how it was meant to be seen, and then compare it to other horror flicks.  Such a copy probably doesn't even exist, and if it did, the cost might be prohibitive.  After all, I bought this single DVD package with five films for around 8 bucks - even if I had more money than I knew what to do with, I probably wouldn't throw away 25 dollars on a restored special edition.  The sad thing is that studios make a thousand copies ofPearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)and sell enough to get their money's worth, while Vampire's Night Orgy, even though it's no Citizen Kane, sucks the blood out of a film like Pearl Harbor and spits in its eye.Don't let the title fool you - there's no orgy going on here, at least in the large group of naked people sense.  Obviously, once you watch it, you can see that the title is supposed to refer to the gluttonous vampires, but even that's a little questionable.  I would thing 'orgy' would mean over the top, but this is a much more sedate story about blood-sucking freaks than I might have assumed.  Oh well, can't have it all.  Besides, Vampire's Night Orgy is a much better title than 'Vampire's have nice table manners', or even 'Twilight'.",3,Don't let the title fool you,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,5832,"['Disclaimer',

I know it's not perfect. At times it's slow moving, some of the night scenes are almost too dark to see exactly what's happening and the accompanying music score makes NO sense, but after that I only have great things to say about 'The Vampire's Night Orgy'. In case you looked at the title and wondered, no it's not pornographic in any way. Actually the only nude scene I saw in plain sight lasted around 10 seconds. I have to say that I've NEVER encountered a film with such endless dread! From the first 5 minutes until the very end you will feel depressed and bummed out, but more importantly you'll feel scared. This film definitely accomplishes one of the major goals of horror and that is to scare the viewer. I don't know if it's the camera angels or the exploitation style it was filmed in, but every scene where the vampires swarm is creepy as Hell! In the village, on the bus, in the hotel. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but because this film is so dark and nothing ""happy"" ever seems to happen, you'll start to wonder if ANYONE is going to survive in this film. Overall, I'd say if you enjoy French, Italian or Spanish horror, you'll probably find this little gem entertaining and frightening.

A group of new employees are on a bus headed to their employer's mansion. While in route the bus driver suddenly dies. Rather than place him on the luggage rack, like an real American family would do, they wrap him up and place him in the back of the bus. The crew opts to spend the night in a small village inn before pushing on, a very odd village where everyone disappears at night...and their bus won't restart...and the meat is like nothing they have tasted. Oh yes it is the type of inn where connecting rooms have a hole in the closet.AS as exciting as a grindhouse or sexplotation film as this sounds, it is not. It makes promises it doesn't deliver.

It's a cool, very atmospheric 70's Spanish origin vampire flick featuring Helga Line, a personal fave.The problem is the image quality of this Sinema Diable/ Eclectic DVD. It's letterboxed as advertised on the cover, but it's so dark it's actually unwatchable. It seems to become darker as the film progresses as well.

I have several copies of this movie from other companies, and because of the ""remastered"" tag and the higher price, I'd hoped this would be an improvement over those; I love the movie and would jump at a really nice copy.  This, unfortunately, is about as far from that as you can get.  The picture quality looks worse than a downloaded-and-burned-to-DVD YouTube video.  Not only can you not read the opening credits, you can hardly tell the credits are even there!  The picture is very fuzzy, dark, blurry, and has a lot of digital ""swimming"" going on, causing things in the picture to move and flow around.  You can barely tell what you're looking at most of the time. It's amazing that anyone would be so lacking in pride as to put something this horrible-looking out on the market, much less charge you twice as much as better versions do.  By all means, seek out a copy of this movie, because it's a great Euro-vampire film, but avoid the A2ZCDs version like the plague!  It's like watching mud in a blender!
