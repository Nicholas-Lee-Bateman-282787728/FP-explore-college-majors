As far as I can tell, that would be Deathstalker 2. Still, if it's nudity and violence you want, Barbarian Queen has it. It needed more, though. There are moments where nothing interesting happens, and in a 71 minute b-movie that is unacceptable. But this is a pretty fun movie, overall. It could've been very fun, though.",3,"Barbaric, But Fun",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,418,"['Barbarian', 'Queen', 'not', 'best', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'film', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'name', 'attached', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'would', 'be', 'Deathstalker', '2', 'Still', 'nudity', 'violence', 'want', 'Barbarian', 'Queen', 'needed', 'more', 'though', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'happens', '71', 'minute', 'b-movie', 'unacceptable', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie', 'overall', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'fun', 'though']",N/A

669647,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B00005NOP0,J. Munyon,"[4, 4]","In Argentina during 1985, Aires Cinematografica Argentina and Rodeo Products released a 71 minute romp of T & A called ""Barbarian Queen"" with Lana Clarkson, Katt Shea, Dawn Dunlap, Susana Traverso, Andrea Barbieri, Andrea Scriven, Matilde Mur, and Lucy Tiller.  I imagine a few women would enjoy Frank Zagarino in this film, also.  But predominantly, it isn't the sword fighting, it isn't the sets, and it isn't the thespian skills that kept me watching.  The language for the film is English, but that isn't important for this genre.  The story is a raid on a village where survivors are made into slaves, and ultimately back at the castle those slaves and other slaves unite in overthrowing the warlord.  There's raping and pillaging, and some hut burning too.  Lana Clarkson has appeared in many TV hits of the 1970's and 1980's, as well as her fair share of movies.  I like her best in this R-rated film for obvious reasons, as the ""Barbarian Queen.""  Some of the gore and some of the exploitation has been edited, but there's enough here to be worth having.",4,"had the 3 edited out minutes still been in here, it would be ten stars",1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,1062,"['Argentina', '1985', 'Aires', 'Cinematografica', 'Argentina', 'Rodeo', 'Products', 'released', '71', 'minute', 'romp', 'T', 'A', 'called', 'Barbarian', 'Queen', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'Katt', 'Shea', 'Dawn', 'Dunlap', 'Susana', 'Traverso', 'Andrea', 'Barbieri', 'Andrea', 'Scriven', 'Matilde', 'Mur', 'Lucy', 'Tiller', 'imagine', 'few', 'women', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Frank', 'Zagarino', 'film', 'also', 'predominantly', ""n't"", 'sword', 'fighting', ""n't"", 'sets', ""n't"", 'thespian', 'skills', 'kept', 'watching', 'language', 'film', 'English', ""n't"", 'important', 'genre', 'story', 'raid', 'village', 'where', 'survivors', 'are', 'made', 'slaves', 'ultimately', 'back', 'castle', 'slaves', 'other', 'slaves', 'unite', 'overthrowing', 'warlord', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'hut', 'burning', 'too', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'appeared', 'many', 'TV', 'hits', '1970', '1980', 'as', 'well', 'fair', 'share', 'movies', 'best', 'R-rated', 'film', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Barbarian', 'Queen', 'gore', 'exploitation', 'been', 'edited', 'enough', 'here', 'be', 'worth', 'having']",N/A

Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!

This is not a great movie but a acceptable low budget sword and sorcery movie.The print looks half way decent too.  Sadly Lana was murdered by Phil Spector the music producer (he was convicted of it too) and is no longer with us; but her earnest performances in this and other low budget movies still survive.  She had enough talent to make this seem like it was more important than it was and she will be missed.,3,lana lives on,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,476,"['Lana', 'clarkson', 'always', 'gave', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'low', 'budget', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'movie.The', 'print', 'way', 'decent', 'too', 'Sadly', 'Lana', 'was', 'murdered', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'music', 'producer', 'was', 'convicted', 'too', 'longer', 'earnest', 'performances', 'other', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'still', 'survive', 'had', 'enough', 'talent', 'make', 'seem', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
