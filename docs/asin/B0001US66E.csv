I'm not really a hockey fan, just like I'm not really a figure skating fan, but somehow the fact that it's the Olympics always seems to heighten my interest. MIRACLE is quite good in setting the mood of the time and in dramatizing the growing attention across the country as the US hockey team progressed through its schedule that year. The day they played the Soviets, everybody I knew was in front of a TV somewhere watching. Streets were unusually quiet. The excitement of that moment and the tenseness of that game come through in MIRACLE.There are two things that keep MIRACLE from being a great sports movie. The first is that it is ultimately more about the hockey than it is about the players. Despite some nods toward the personal interplay among the various personalities on the team, the personal angle isn't developed much. In the end, it's more about the team than the players, so you don't ever feel much involvement with them in spite of their personal trials and tribulations. The second thing is that, although Kurt Russell does a good job portraying Coach Herb Brooks, he never really becomes the focus of the story, either. Again, it's more about the team and winning the gold than it is about the coach and his personal struggles. So, again, the chance to draw the viewer in more fully is missed. We all know who won the game, so without more development of the personal element, there just isn't enough tension in MARACLE. It plays almost like a documentary, which may have been the intent, but it doesn't engage the viewer as well as it might have.I liked MIRACLE and I certainly feel it's worth seeing. It's a good portrayal of the actual events, especially if you remember them. It has lots of nostalgia appeal. It could have been better, though. Give it a look, but don't expect something with the heart of a movie like HOOSIERS.

Ort ""aorto""","[1, 1]","I was twelve years old when this event happened, sitting in a bedroom with my brothers and some friends, going absolutely crazy when they won the game.  I wasn't aware of the larger implications, of the events in history that had been transpiring nor even the meaning of the Olympic games.  I knew the Russians to be the bad guys, that was about it.  Obviously I somehow knew there was something larger at stake because even my mother was surprised at how nuts we went when they won.I hesitated to watch this film for a long time due, sadly, to the Disney attached to the film.  I was afraid of it being given a gloss.  Happily, this was not the case, as many reviewers here will attest to its accuracy and attention to detail.The opening segue giving a quick and poignant synopsis of events that had been transpiring throughout that decade, with a few significant moments captured at various points throughout the film, grounds it in the history of which I was, at twelve years old, unaware.Kurt Russell is incredible as the coach but it is the seasoned hockey players who were chosen to act in the film that really give this film its feel.  Relive that moment or experience it for the first time, I highly recommend this film, especially in a day and age where the idea of sports has dissipated into big business.

As a 40-year old, I now have a great appreciation for history and am glad that I developed enough interest in the Olympics that I watched and witnessed this historic moment.The film does a fantastic job of recreating the social climate of the late '70's and early '80's: the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, the disco craze, oil embargos, and unrest in the Middle East (i.e. the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis). President Carter gave his infamous ""Crisis of Confidence,"" a.k.a. 'malaise,' speech in which he pointed the finger at the American public while doing nothing to provide inspiring or effective leadership. He was right, though: America was having a crisis of confidence. We needed a morale boost.And along came the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. It was a team of true amateurs unlike the Soviet team that had won the gold medal in the previous four Olympics. The Soviets were so well-funded by their government that they were able to focus entirely on their hockey game and were so good that they even beat a team of NHL all-stars. And yet our amateurs beat our (at that time) arch-enemy's hockey juggernaut and gave the entire country a confidence and morale boost. The fact that they won the gold medal by beating Finland was just icing on the cake; all that really mattered was that they had beaten the Soviets.It's great to get the background behind the players and their coach, Herb Brooks, in this movie. The movie contains many sports cliches: the diverse group of players who need to learn to function as a team, the hard-nosed coach who teaches them, and the underdog comes out on top cliches are all here. None of that matters, though, because it was all true. If you were alive and old enough to remember this time, then this movie will warm your heart as much as the team's victory did in 1980. If you weren't alive or old enough to remember, then watch and see what Americans did (and still can do) when we set our minds on achieving a goal even as everything around us seems to be falling apart. Sports truly can be a metaphor for life, so let's all learn a lesson from this team.",5,A success story when the U.S. desperately needed a morale boost,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,2347,"['had', 'never', 'had', 'interest', 'Olympics', 'Summer', 'Winter', 'was', '13-year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'laid-up', 'flu', '1980', 'watched', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'were', 'only', 'alternative', 'soap', 'operas', 'day', '40-year', 'old', 'now', 'have', 'great', 'appreciation', 'history', 'am', 'glad', 'developed', 'enough', 'interest', 'Olympics', 'watched', 'witnessed', 'historic', 'moment.The', 'film', 'fantastic', 'job', 'recreating', 'social', 'climate', 'late', ""'70"", 'early', ""'80"", 'aftermath', 'Vietnam', 'Watergate', 'disco', 'craze', 'oil', 'embargos', 'unrest', 'Middle', 'East', 'i.e', 'Iranian', 'Revolution', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'President', 'Carter', 'gave', 'infamous', 'Crisis', 'Confidence', 'a.k.a', ""'malaise"", 'speech', 'pointed', 'finger', 'American', 'public', 'doing', 'nothing', 'provide', 'inspiring', 'effective', 'leadership', 'was', 'right', 'America', 'was', 'having', 'crisis', 'confidence', 'needed', 'morale', 'boost.And', 'came', '1980', 'U.S.', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'team', 'was', 'team', 'true', 'amateurs', 'Soviet', 'team', 'had', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'previous', 'four', 'Olympics', 'Soviets', 'were', 'so', 'well-funded', 'government', 'were', 'able', 'focus', 'entirely', 'hockey', 'game', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'beat', 'team', 'NHL', 'all-stars', 'yet', 'amateurs', 'beat', 'time', 'arch-enemy', 'hockey', 'juggernaut', 'gave', 'entire', 'country', 'confidence', 'morale', 'boost', 'fact', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'beating', 'Finland', 'was', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'really', 'mattered', 'was', 'had', 'beaten', 'Soviets.It', 'great', 'get', 'background', 'players', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'movie', 'many', 'sports', 'cliches', 'diverse', 'group', 'players', 'who', 'need', 'learn', 'function', 'team', 'hard-nosed', 'coach', 'who', 'underdog', 'out', 'top', 'cliches', 'are', 'here', 'None', 'matters', 'though', 'was', 'true', 'were', 'alive', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'time', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'as', 'much', 'team', 'victory', 'did', '1980', 'were', ""n't"", 'alive', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'then', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'Americans', 'did', 'still', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'set', 'minds', 'achieving', 'goal', 'even', 'everything', 'be', 'falling', 'apart', 'Sports', 'truly', 'can', 'be', 'metaphor', 'life', 'let', 'learn', 'lesson', 'team']",N/A

813021,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0001US66E,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 3]","One of the more inspiring films of all time, Miracle is the 2004 Disney rendition of the 1980 US Olympic hockey team's improbable pursuit of Olympic Gold. Based on the true story of the team that captured the nation's imagination, it connects with audience like few movies of its kind...The story follows the life of Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a highly successful college hockey coach who just missed being a part of the last US Olympic gold medal ice hockey team in 1960. Several months before the Olympic games, Brooks is given the task of putting together an amateur hockey made up of mostly college students - one that can compete with the mighty Soviet juggernaut which has not only some of the best players in the world, but a team that has been playing together for over 15 years.Along the way, Brooks faces a challenge from the team's committee members when he decides to form a roster that fails to include some of the best known players at the time. Intent on choosing a team and not a collection of individual stars, Brooks win his battle, and most of the final roster is pinned down on the first day.Slowly, Brooks brings the players together (many of them from competing colleges) and creates a true team. Following a loss to Sweden in which his players were more focused on the girls in the crowd than on winning the game, Brooks pushes his players through a series of conditioning drills. He forces them to continuously push and push to the next level, until they are at the brink of exhaustion. He tells them they don't have the talent to beat the Soviets, but they will be the best conditioned team on the ice.By exerting as much psychological and physical pressure possible on his players, Brooks finds out who has the mental capacity to take the US team to the top level. When the 1980 Olympic games arrive at Lake Placid, the Soviets are the overwhelming favorites. The US team meets the Soviets in the semi-finals, and with gut and grit, they defeat them against overwhelming odds.Born from a true story that played out in the height of the Cold War (and Soviet power specifically), Miracle is an inspiring tale of teamwork, freedom's triumph over oppression, and the great heights to which ordinary men can aspire. Uplifting and personally touching, this is a film that no sports fan, movie lover, or American should miss. It's central theme drives at the heart of what it means to be American, prompting Al Michaels' famous one-liner ""Do you believe in miracles?""

Miracle really was a hard movie to make, because they needed to make sure the hockey scenes were believable, but the acting had to be there too. They chose to do the right thing, which is teach great hockey players how to act rather than having actors have stunt doubles play hockey for them. This way they can do head shots while they are on the ice and make it way more believable rather than just seeing feet skating along the ice. The Mighty Ducks movies (though great for kids) really lacked in the hockey scenes, as most people know. Another thing that makes the movie so hard, is that now that they have good hockey players, they still need to make the goals/assists/body checks as close to the real thing in 1980 as possible. On the special features they show you tape of a real goal scored against the Soviets, which went right through the goalies legs, and they show you the movie version...its a spitting image. Amazing job on the directors part, and the hockey players who, in a sense actually have to ""act"" while playing hockey. All in all, Miracle does a great job at showing how much of an underdog U.S.A. was (though i wasnt born then, i can only imagine what it was like) and how amazing of a feat it was to beat the russians. Miracle also ties in some smaller stories that make the movie better, such as Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his family life and how his coaching gets in the way of being with his wife and kids. I could go on forever about Miracle, but the only way to end this is to go with Al Michaels' famous line counting down the last 3 seconds of the game against the soviets : DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?

813023,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0001US66E,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 3]","""Miracle"" is an entertaining movie that chronicles the stunning upset by the U.S. Olympic Hockey team over the former Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. This movie follows the team from its formation all the way through its upset victory against a heavily favored Soviet team- a decisive victory that led to a Gold Medal for the Americans following a win against Finland.What sets this film apart from other sports movies is its direct plot. Unlike other movies that deviate from the main plot at some point, this film stays completely focused. It starts out talking about Herb Brooks and his selection of players for the Olympic team. Then, it follows the players as the take part in grueling daily practices. Then, it shows them practicing and playing exhibition games. Finally, it shows them triumphing over the Soviet Union's team in front of a sellout crowd of fans who are whipped into a frenzy over what is taking place before their eyes. There is little else covered here outside of hockey. At one point, the film shows Brooks and his wife watching television and learning that a group of Americans have just been taken hostage in Iran. Director Gavin O'Connor could have developed all sorts of different subplots using this or other themes. But he sticks to hockey from beginning to end.Another positive of this film is Kurt Russell. He is great as coach Heb Brooks and his look and accent are befitting of the man he played. Russell is tough and knows what it takes to win. He can be credited in this movie with some memorable quotes and with taking the viewer back to the 1970's with his hair style and fashion. The long locks of hair and the plaid suits will have many people reminiscing about this bygone cultural era.There is little character development among the players on the team. But this is primarily because, like I said before, there are no real subplots developed. The movie sticks to hockey so the guys on the team really don't have the opportunity to strut their stuff when it comes to acting. They condition, and they play hockey. There are a few conflicts between Brooks and some of the players, but these conflicts don't last very long. They are quickly resolved and the team and coaches return their focus to winning games.Overall, this is a highly entertaining film that most viewers will find uplifting and enduring. Of course, we already know how the story ends. But the predictability doesn't matter in this instance. Winning against some of the best teams in the world is no easy task, but the members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team and coach Herb Brooks are determined to dream big and achieve the impossible. And this event is captured and brought back to life in this memorable, entertaining movie.",4,Achieving the Impossible,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2774,"['Miracle', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'stunning', 'upset', 'U.S.', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'team', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', '1980', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'team', 'formation', 'way', 'upset', 'victory', 'heavily', 'favored', 'Soviet', 'team-', 'decisive', 'victory', 'led', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'Americans', 'following', 'win', 'Finland.What', 'film', 'apart', 'other', 'sports', 'movies', 'direct', 'plot', 'other', 'movies', 'deviate', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'film', 'completely', 'focused', 'out', 'talking', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'selection', 'players', 'Olympic', 'team', 'Then', 'players', 'take', 'part', 'grueling', 'daily', 'practices', 'Then', 'practicing', 'playing', 'exhibition', 'games', 'Finally', 'triumphing', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'team', 'front', 'sellout', 'crowd', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'whipped', 'frenzy', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'eyes', 'little', 'else', 'covered', 'here', 'hockey', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Brooks', 'wife', 'watching', 'television', 'learning', 'group', 'Americans', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Iran', 'Director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'sorts', 'different', 'subplots', 'using', 'other', 'themes', 'hockey', 'beginning', 'end.Another', 'positive', 'film', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'great', 'coach', 'Heb', 'Brooks', 'look', 'accent', 'are', 'befitting', 'man', 'played', 'Russell', 'tough', 'what', 'win', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'movie', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'taking', 'viewer', 'back', '1970', 'hair', 'style', 'fashion', 'long', 'locks', 'hair', 'plaid', 'suits', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'people', 'reminiscing', 'bygone', 'cultural', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'players', 'team', 'primarily', 'said', 'are', 'real', 'subplots', 'developed', 'movie', 'sticks', 'hockey', 'so', 'guys', 'team', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'strut', 'stuff', 'when', 'acting', 'condition', 'play', 'hockey', 'are', 'few', 'conflicts', 'Brooks', 'players', 'conflicts', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'are', 'quickly', 'resolved', 'team', 'coaches', 'return', 'focus', 'winning', 'games.Overall', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'uplifting', 'enduring', 'course', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'predictability', ""n't"", 'matter', 'instance', 'Winning', 'best', 'teams', 'world', 'easy', 'task', 'members', '1980', 'U.S.', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'team', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'are', 'determined', 'dream', 'big', 'achieve', 'impossible', 'event', 'captured', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.The story also is about Herb Brooks, the coach of the team. Everything in here centers around him. Kurt Russell does a nice job playing him, although I don't understand the Polish accent Russell used. Why would Brooks have a Polish accent?Over the years, sports movies - as in other genres - are becoming more and more realistic. This was about as good as it gets in that regard. A number of the actors are players, meaning they know how to skate. A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic.

I expected a stereotypical sports movie with lots of &quot;We're number one!&quot;jingoism and lame little sub-plots about team members who overcome various personal issues at the last moment so they can help their team win the big game.  Instead, what I saw was a gripping recreation of a specific moment in U.S. sports history, the 1980 victory over the Soviet Olympic hockey team--the mood of the country, what this particular victory meant to Americans, and how one driven man, coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), forged a team that was capable of pulling it off.In a sense, there are really only two main characters in this film--the coach and his team.  Although I came to recognize the players' faces by the end of the film, one of the courageous decisions made by director Gavin O'Connor and screenwriter Eric Guggenheim was to focus on the dynamic between Brooks and his team rather than on individual team players.  This choice allows the filmmakers to avoid many of the usual sports film conventions and tell a story that we don't see very often, the story of the coaching style that brought them success and the enormous pressures placed on the coach himself.  The cast is wonderfully restrained, but Russell is especially good.",4,A big surprise,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,1283,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'one', 'expected', 'stereotypical', 'sports', 'movie', 'lots', 'quot', ""'re"", 'number', 'one', 'quot', 'jingoism', 'lame', 'little', 'sub-plots', 'team', 'members', 'who', 'overcome', 'various', 'personal', 'issues', 'last', 'moment', 'can', 'help', 'team', 'win', 'big', 'game', 'Instead', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'gripping', 'recreation', 'specific', 'moment', 'U.S.', 'sports', 'history', '1980', 'victory', 'Soviet', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'team', 'mood', 'country', 'what', 'particular', 'victory', 'meant', 'Americans', 'how', 'one', 'driven', 'man', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'forged', 'team', 'was', 'capable', 'pulling', 'sense', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'coach', 'team', 'came', 'recognize', 'players', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'courageous', 'decisions', 'made', 'director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'screenwriter', 'Eric', 'Guggenheim', 'was', 'focus', 'dynamic', 'Brooks', 'team', 'rather', 'individual', 'team', 'players', 'choice', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'many', 'usual', 'sports', 'film', 'conventions', 'tell', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'often', 'story', 'coaching', 'style', 'brought', 'success', 'enormous', 'pressures', 'placed', 'coach', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'Russell', 'especially', 'good']",N/A

The acting is strong all around, and the movie inspires.  Sadly, the real Herb Brooks died in a car accident shortly after filming had wrapped up; he never saw the completed film.The blu-ray transfer is solid.  While there is some film grain, this is still a definite improvement over the DVD.  The colors pop, particularly the blue uniforms of Team USA and the red uniforms of the Soviet team.  They look great against the white ice.Parental Advisory: The movie was rated PG.  It has some hockey-related violence, including intense workouts.  There is some mild language.

813041,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0001US66E,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[8, 10]","1979-1980...the United States of America was in a difficult position from in the late 70's with water shortages, oil shortages (which led to long lines at the gas pump since gas stations didn't have enough gas), Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan and the Iran hostage crisis.  As 1980 came, there was one major highlight in sports history for the United States that won the hearts of millions and that was the underdog United States men's hockey team defeating the ""unbeatable"" Soviet team in the medal round.  That moment in time sports announcer Al Michaels said ""Do you believe in miracles?"" and from that win, the game was dubbed a ""miracle"".In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures and director Gavin O'Connor (""Tumbleweeds"" and ""Pride and Glory""), writer Eric Guggenheim, actor Kurt Russell (""Stargate"", ""Backdraft"", ""The Thing"", and ""Escape from New York""), composer Mark Isham (""Crash"", ""Next"", ""Invincible"" and ""Pride and Glory""), cinematographer Dan Stoloff ""Tumbleweeds"", ""The Vagina Monologues"" and ""The Prince"") came together to recreate this moment of time and adapt it into a film.Working with the coach of the 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team, Herb Brooks (who passed away before the film was completed) and several of the players from the team, the filmmakers and the athletes and the talent would come together and make a film that would be true to how the original people were but to have a film that was as authentic and real, so that meant having actors who can play hockey and even have to participate in grueling and challenging moments in order to understand how strict the coach was on the players and how they needed to prepare for the Olympics.""MIRACLE"" documents the challenges that the players had to go from day one up to the actual 1980's Olympic games but also challenges some of the players and the coach had to face off the ice.The film would earn its distinction as one of the most accurate looking sports films ever and also take home ""Best Sports Movie"" at the ESPY Awards in 2004.VIDEO & AUDIO:""MIRACLE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.  The picture quality does feature grain throughout but you can see the quality from Kurt Russell's skin pores, detail on the clothing.  Low light scenes look great with no digital compression artifacts and no dust or scratches.  Skin detail can be seen quite well during the dark as well.Director Gavin O'Connor and Director of Photography Daniel Stoloff did a great job in capturing the look and feel of that time.  From hair styles, clothing, closeups but most of all capturing all the action on the ice.As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  Director Gavin O'Connor was very much involved with the audio process and making sure that the sounds of hockey, from the puck hitting a post, body clashing on the barriers, pucks being hit, skates on the ice were captured.  Sounds of various players from different countries communicating to each other in their own language was covered.  The cheers from the audience would come alive through the audio.With that being said, the audio is front channel heavy.  Audio is quite clear and the music by Mark Isham comes alive as well.  But I was no immersed in sound as I was hoping to be.  Rear surrounds were used sparingly but I suppose I was expecting a full round of audience cheering all around me but that didn't happen.  Everything seemed as if it was all front channel driven.  I don't recall any low frequency sounds utilizing the subwoofer as well.But overall, dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music is clear and heard quite well.  But I wish the audio was more immersive and utilized the rear audio channels even more.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:MIRACLE comes with a good number of special features.  Included are:* Audio Commentary by Director Gavin O'Connor, Director of Photography Dan Stoloff and Editor John Gilroy -* The Making of Miracle - (17:52) Behind the scenes on the making of ""MIRACLE"".  How Director Gavin O'Connor wanted authenticity and the talent needing to go through training camp and having to take the physical hits, having to go through similar grueling conditioning that  Coach Herb Brooks put the 1980 Olympic Men's Ice Hockey team through.  Having to bring Al Michaels to re-record certain play-by-play calls and much more.  Capturing the game from that time period and making things look authentic nearly 25 years later.* From Hockey to Hollywood:  The Actor's Journeys - (27:31) An interesting interview as we get some of the original team members with the actors who are portraying them.  The actors talk about their roles and trying to make sure that they were like the actual actors.  Original athletes of the 1980 team talking about how the talent were almost like spitting image of them during that time.* The Sound of Miracle - (10:24) As the Director Gavin O'Connor wanted to create authenticity of the game.  It was important to get the sounds of the game incorporated in the film.  This featurette shows us how that was done.* Miracle ESPN Roundtable with Linda Cohn - (41:08) Linda Cohn interviews actor Kurt Russell and 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team members Mike Eruzione, Buzz Schneider and Jim Craig.  From discussions of the comparison of the film and what happened in real life and remembering Coach Herb Brooks and what Kurt Russell did to play the role of the coach.* First Impressions: Herb Brooks with Kurt Russell and the Filmmakers - (21:13) Herb Brooks passed away before the film was completed but the filmmakers had footage of when they met with Herb Brooks and getting to know the man.  Brooks talked about his emotions of being part of the 1960 US Olympic Men's Ice Hockey team but then getting cut before the day of the Olympics and the emotions he head then and also as a coach.* Outtakes - (4:52) - The bloopers and outtakes from the film.The special features are all featured in 480i Standard definition and with English 2.0 Dolby Digital audio.  Subtitles for the special features are in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:When I was younger, I can easily remember watching the 1980's US Men's Olympic Hockey Team beating the Soviets and watching as many of the games before the medal rounds and literally be entranced by the moment.After watching ""MIRACLE"", I was amazed by how much went into the creation of this film in order to capture the authentic feel of the game but everything that went on behind-the-scenes such as the players calling themselves only by their characters names, going through extensive hockey training and preparing them for actual grueling scenes of conditioning (especially having to take part in actual ""Herbies"" that the 1980 United States Olympic ice hockey team had to go through), having to endure actual hockey body-to-body hits and much more.Kurt Russell also determined to capture Coach Herb Brooks in his mannerisms and even going so far in reality not introducing himself to the talents and keeping his distance in order to capture Brooks attitude towards his players.Sports films are typically, make or break.  People know when actors are playing sports films because scenes are not realistic.  But what made this film work so well was the preparation that Director Gavin O'Connor demanded and got from his crew and talent in capturing authenticity.  From making hockey look like hockey, the sounds are captured authentically for the film and more.As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is good and definitely much better than its DVD counterpart.  Audio is clear and understandable but I wish that the rear surrounds were utilized much more, especially to make the audio of the crowds much more immersive and make you feel that you were there.  The special features were all informative and fun to watch.But for those who own the original 2-disc DVD, there's not much of anything extra on this Blu-ray disc in terms of features but you do get the 1080p High Definition transfer which looks great and a DTS-HD Master Audio track.  So, if you really enjoyed the film, you'll enjoy the High Definition transfer on Blu-ray.Whether or not you enjoy hockey, ""MIRACLE"" is about adversity, team work, rising from the bottom to the top and an awesome and nostalgic return to that moment in time to show us that ""miracles do happen"".Do you believe in miracles?  ""MIRACLE"" is highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray:  An inspiring film that is one of the more realistic sports films out there but is it worth the double dip?,1245110400,"06 16,

813042,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0001US66E,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[2, 2]","'Miracle' retells the story of the &quot;Miracle on Ice,&quot; which is the name given to the improbable gold medal winning United States Olympic hockey team from 1980. In addition, the movie is a fitting tribute to Herb Brooks, the coach of that team. In my opinion, it is also one of the most underatted movies in the last two years.Kurt Russell plays coach Herb Brooks. Brooks has been hired by the United States Olympic committee to coach the U.S. hockey team at the Olypmics. Standing in their way are the national hockey teams from the Eastern Bloc countries including the Soviet team which has won the last four gold medals and soundly defeated a team of NHL All-Stars. While the Soviet team is largely made up of veteran players that have played together for fifteen years, the U.S. team is assembled from college players. However, Brooks has a plan, and he puts together a team of players that aren't the best the United States has to offer, but the players that will best carry out his system.The movie is masterful in several ways. First, it captures the desire of Coach Brooks as he prepares the U.S. team with gruelling practices. It also successfully captures the tension he felt at home when he is forced to sacrifice time with his family to construct his team. Russell plays an excellent Brooks. His usual flair and bombast is gone, and instead, we get a thoughtful, if not riveting, performance.Second, the scenes from the hockey games were excellently coreographed and captured on film. The crew that made the movie went back to the footage from 1980 and did their best to recreate what happened in the games on the ice. As seen on the DVD extras, this included several inovations for filming, and to get it right, required miles of film to be shot. The results are beautiful and astounding. Al Michaels provides a new recording for the game against the Soviets. Michaels originally called the game in 1980 and gave the famous &quot;Do you believe in miracles? Yes!&quot; line, which was used in the movie.Third, the movie succeeds by portraying the time in which the Miracle happened. The 1980 Olympics occurred at the height of the Cold War. The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan. Nixon had resigned from office. The Vietnam war had left America scarred. America needed something to cheer for. It is ironic that a hockey team would provide the needed lift when hockey is the least popular of the big four sports in the U.S. In many ways, the time period of the 1980's is similar to the time period of today as America recovers from the financial scandals of Enron and Worldcom, a war that is beginning to take its toll in Iraq, and a disputed election from 2000 (note: I do not express any political views on any of these events). This move is uplifting, and reminds the viewer of what it means to be American.The DVD contains several excellent extras. There is a 'making of' featurette that explains the complexity of making the film, including the challenge of finding hockey players that could act. There is a 'blooper reel' that really is a blooper reel and not just several clips of actors giggling through their lines. Also included are a round table discussion, a feature on the sound effects, and a director's commentary. All are first class.I highly recommend this movie. Hockey fans should enjoy it for its purity. There are no crazy antics as in 'Slap Shot,' although that is a good movie, or silly trick plays as found in 'The Mighty Ducks.' Everyone else should enjoy it because it is a great film that celebrates one of the greatest sports moments in American history.",5,"Highly Underrated, Fantastic Film",1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3600,"[""'Miracle"", 'story', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Ice', 'quot', 'name', 'given', 'improbable', 'gold', 'medal', 'winning', 'United', 'States', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'team', '1980', 'addition', 'movie', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'coach', 'team', 'opinion', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'underatted', 'movies', 'last', 'two', 'years.Kurt', 'Russell', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Brooks', 'been', 'hired', 'United', 'States', 'Olympic', 'committee', 'coach', 'U.S.', 'hockey', 'team', 'Olypmics', 'Standing', 'way', 'are', 'national', 'hockey', 'teams', 'Eastern', 'Bloc', 'countries', 'including', 'Soviet', 'team', 'won', 'last', 'four', 'gold', 'medals', 'soundly', 'defeated', 'team', 'NHL', 'All-Stars', 'Soviet', 'team', 'largely', 'made', 'veteran', 'players', 'have', 'played', 'together', 'fifteen', 'years', 'U.S.', 'team', 'assembled', 'college', 'players', 'However', 'Brooks', 'plan', 'together', 'team', 'players', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'United', 'States', 'offer', 'players', 'will', 'best', 'carry', 'system.The', 'movie', 'masterful', 'several', 'ways', 'First', 'desire', 'Coach', 'Brooks', 'U.S.', 'team', 'gruelling', 'practices', 'also', 'successfully', 'tension', 'felt', 'home', 'when', 'forced', 'sacrifice', 'time', 'family', 'construct', 'team', 'Russell', 'excellent', 'Brooks', 'usual', 'flair', 'bombast', 'gone', 'instead', 'get', 'thoughtful', 'not', 'riveting', 'performance.Second', 'scenes', 'hockey', 'games', 'were', 'excellently', 'coreographed', 'captured', 'film', 'crew', 'made', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'footage', '1980', 'did', 'best', 'recreate', 'what', 'happened', 'games', 'ice', 'seen', 'DVD', 'extras', 'included', 'several', 'inovations', 'filming', 'get', 'right', 'required', 'miles', 'film', 'be', 'shot', 'results', 'are', 'beautiful', 'astounding', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'new', 'recording', 'game', 'Soviets', 'Michaels', 'originally', 'called', 'game', '1980', 'gave', 'famous', 'quot', 'Do', 'believe', 'miracles', 'Yes', 'quot', 'line', 'was', 'used', 'movie.Third', 'movie', 'portraying', 'time', 'Miracle', 'happened', '1980', 'Olympics', 'occurred', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'Soviets', 'had', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'Nixon', 'had', 'resigned', 'office', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'had', 'left', 'America', 'scarred', 'America', 'needed', 'something', 'cheer', 'ironic', 'hockey', 'team', 'would', 'provide', 'needed', 'lift', 'when', 'hockey', 'least', 'popular', 'big', 'four', 'sports', 'U.S', 'many', 'ways', 'time', 'period', '1980', 'similar', 'time', 'period', 'today', 'America', 'recovers', 'financial', 'scandals', 'Enron', 'Worldcom', 'war', 'beginning', 'take', 'toll', 'Iraq', 'disputed', 'election', '2000', 'note', 'do', 'not', 'express', 'political', 'views', 'events', 'move', 'uplifting', 'viewer', 'what', 'be', 'American.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'excellent', 'extras', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'complexity', 'making', 'film', 'including', 'challenge', 'finding', 'hockey', 'players', 'could', 'act', ""'blooper"", 'reel', 'really', 'blooper', 'reel', 'not', 'just', 'several', 'clips', 'actors', 'giggling', 'lines', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'round', 'table', 'discussion', 'feature', 'sound', 'effects', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'first', 'class.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Hockey', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'purity', 'are', 'crazy', 'antics', ""'Slap"", 'Shot', 'good', 'movie', 'silly', 'trick', 'plays', 'found', ""'The"", 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'Everyone', 'else', 'should', 'enjoy', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'sports', 'moments', 'American', 'history']",N/A

I don't understand the intricacies of the sport, plus it's bloody hard watching it on TV.  I've only watched one hockey game, from start to finish, in my life:  The 1980 Olympic hockey game between a hodge-podge of college kids playing for USA versus the best hockey team in the history of the sport, the vaunted, intimidating Soviets.  On that Friday night in February, I watched with several friends the most historical--and riveting--upset in the history of sports.  It was literally a miracle (thank you, Al Michaels, for uttering possibly the most famous words in all of sports), we were all on our feet screaming ourselves hoarse, and yes, plenty of alcohol was consumed.  So it was with great interest I recently pulled up a chair to see the 2004 film MIRACLE, the story of the 1980 USA hockey team.  Again, riveting.The actors portraying the players are all (to me) unknowns; but crikey, can they all skate and play hockey.  What holds this film together so well is Kurt Russell's performance as USA head coach Herb Brooks.  Brooks is a my-way-or-the-highway taskmaster who pulls no punches and runs a Spartan-type training camp--and he's not afraid to humiliate his players following an exhibition game.  At the outset, he tells his young charges he's not there to be a mentor or even a shoulder to lean on:  He's there to beat the Soviet Union.  He tells his players if they want a friendly ear, go speak to assistant coach Patrick (Noah Emmerich).  But he has their undivided attention and grudging respect, and once the team is assembled the story moves swiftly to the Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York, during the height of the Cold War, when post-Watergate America was, in President Carter's own words, in a ""malaise"".  It was the perfect time for some sort, any sort, of pick-me-up.When watching the recreations of the various games as the US team advances, it was a stroke of genius to pull the actual audio announcing from the ABC broadcasts.  That lends a striking authenticity to what the viewer is watching.  And the climactic game between Team USA and the Soviets is grand seat-squirming fun that will have you clapping and cheering from your chair.  What's also very interesting is as the film ends, we get updates on what the various players are now doing in their lives (current as of 2004).  And Patricia Clarkson is also solid playing Brooks's (oft neglected, but always supporting) wife.  Kudos to director Gavin O'Connor for delivering such a feel-good story; with the possible exception ofRudy, MIRACLE may be the very best sports film in circulation.--D.

I still remember the media reporting that the U.S. knocked off the invincible Soviet hockey team in the Olympics.  At the time, I didn't know what the big deal was.  After all, I figured that the United States should dominate the Olympics in all sports.  Needless to say, I was a naive kid!Since that time, I've gained an appreciation for the historic victory in Lake Placid NY.  As I didn't see the game itself, the present movie was a splendid way of ""replaying"" it (sort of?).Beyond the game itself, the movie does a good job of taking the viewer back to those dark days in American history.  The U.S. was coming off of a humiliating retreat in Vietnam, Watergate, soaring energy prices and (worst of all) the Iranian hostage crisis.  Seeing this movie brought back a lot of unpleasant memories, for even as a kid I could sense that pessimism was in abundance in those days.Kurt Russell gets his chance to play an iconic coach & he makes the most of it.  He has that certain coach's charisma that the best actors all have.  The film serves as an eye opening demonstration of how the players were chosen in an autocratic way.  Thankfully, ""Coach Herb"" knew what he was doing!This is one of the most important sports movies ever made simply due to the fact that it tells the story of what was perhaps the SINGLE greatest upset in sports history.

Two players from Bowling Green State University were on that team and they are totally ignored. UNH is mentioned in the script, but in reality, that university was not represented on the team.Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, is supposed to be Mr. Macho so he has to use excessive vulgarity to achieve his goal in the eyes of this stereotypically written script. In practice he resolves a conflict between two rival players by having them beat each other up. Now how logical is that? Again, typical Hollywood writing.

She passed away recently after 13 years of battling various types of cancer [no lie, multiple]. The second being that the winter Olympics just passed with the US doing very well in hockey, in this true story they went all the way and won the gold. When getting ready to write this I thought about various things, things I should say, should it be about the film and just that, or should I discuss my mama as well. The truth is I am not sure even still while typing this but it may serve as some kind of therapy, who knows. What I do know is that even if she was still around this is a very good film that shows what America is all about. In hockey, war, friendship, love, and life this is still the greatest country ever. From the actual hockey all the way to the acting the film is suburb in every way, and I mean that.I am sure after all the years this film as been out you know the story, the story of the underdog. The story of the people who are not even looked at as worthy to be in there let alone win the thing. Yeah that is the story of the American Olympic Hockey Team from the 1980 Winter Games. The team was coached by Herb Brooks who was the coach at the University of Minnesota at the time, turns out this guy was a genius. He was counted out even before he got the job and once he did no one supported his decisions except maybe one or two people. Even still no one believed he could lead the US to victory especially over heavy favorites the Soviet team. Still as it would turn out he was the right man for the job, and his methods were excellent.From the get go he wanted his team to be able to practice and come together longer than planned, so instead of a week long try out he had one day. Picked 26 guys who were all talented but maybe not the best over all in some cases, he wanted the best potential team players. Then he wilted it down to just 20 and off he went making his team of no name college guys [remember pros were not playing at the time in the Games] making them hate him so they wouldn't hate each other, which made them a team. Eventually that hate turned to respect for Brooks which made them into a family. It was that frame of mind that Herb wanted all along because it was no longer a team of individuals but one unit. It was that unit that would go on to give this country something it needed most off all in that time. What was that one thing, well for some it was hope, for others a good time, for others an escape, but one thing is for sure it was more than a hockey game.Kurt Russell does a fantastic job of playing Herb Brooks and gets the man point blank, from his mannerisms to his voice and everything else. From what I can tell from the excellent special features he spent a lot of time with Herb and basically became him on the set. Same thing for all of the players on the team, they actually became the people they were portraying. Honestly Kurt could have won some awards for this because it truly is a great film and he did a great job. The surprising thing about this film is how good the kids are that played the players. Finding people that can act and play hockey is an amazing task, I mean my brother fits that to a t but finding a whole team is amazing. Also Patricia Clarkson does a great job as Herb's wife for the time that she is on screen, as does every one in the film.Gavin O'Connor did a great job directing this film and making as true as possible and bringing this story back to life. You could tell when watching the behind the scenes he really did enjoy making this film. Writer Eric Guggenheim as well did an excellent job turning this true life sensation into a screenplay; I wish he would do more films. Also DP Dan Stoloff did a marvelous job, I love the way they filmed the hockey. This movie truly is a great film and not only should be watched but should be owned. I recommend buying this film as soon as possible because during these times it is could to see something like this. There are some excellent special features from behind the scenes, to the true story, to an excellent audio commentary.This is not the grand review that I wanted to write but I just can't seem to get the words to come out. As I type and type after watching this movie I can't help but think about my mother, I was hoping to not only honor this film but to honor her as well. To be honest I am not even sure if I should post this or not, I guess I did if you are reading this. This movie is not only a true story but it showcases the best this country has to offer, its people. I get goose bumps when the legendary line ""do you believe in miracles"" is said, it is also the actual audio from that game. So here's to the greatest person I have ever had the pleasure and honor of knowing. The strongest person to have ever impacted my life, who was actually a hockey mom, we all miss and love you.So here's to my miracle, my mother.",5,HERE'S TO YOU,1269216000,"03 22,

A group of guys batting, kicking and/or hitting a ball around a field doesn't do much for me, usually. But one time when guys, pucks and sticks made me cheer, as I sat riveted to my TV screen, was during the 1980 Olympic &quot;Miracle.&quot;1979-1980 were not good years for the United States. Militant Iranians took US citizens hostage in our embassy in Teheran, the USSR invaded Afghanistan, the Cold War was at below zero temperatures, and at home gas prices were sky high, as were interest rates. The film is set in the context of this period, which makes it even more exciting. Americans really needed something to cheer about.In the summer of 1980, newly hired US Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks took a group of boys, average age 21, worked them 'til they dropped for seven months, taught them new strategies, made them into a cohesive team, and miraculously led them to unbelievable victory. They beat the pants off the unbeatable champion Soviet hockey team in what has been called the &quot;Miracle on Ice.&quot; In a super surprise win, the underdog US team, which had played poorly against the much older Russian veterans a few weeks before at Madison Square Garden, made all the right moves to score success, 4 to 3. The team then went on to win Olympic Gold! The Cold War may be long over, but remembering the moment still feels sweet. The look on the Soviet coach's face alone is worth the price of the rental. And now the &quot;moment&quot; and more can be relived - seen on the big screen, with accurate details and superb characterizations, in director Gavin O'Connor's and screenwriter Eric Guggenheim's &quot;Miracle.&quot;Kurt Russell is superb as coach Brooks. He has the Minnesota accent down pat, chews gum like Brooks - 500 chews per minute...and even looks like him. Actual ice hockey players were cast as teammates in O'Connor's quest to make this an authentic sports film. The last 30 minutes of footage are devoted to the US - Soviet match. But the movie is as much a character study as it is a film about Olympic sport. And Russell's understated, intense performance is compelling. Patricia Clarkson is excellent as Brooks' wife Patty, as is Noah Emmerich as assistant coach Craig Patrick.The movie is dedicated to Herb Brooks, who was tragically killed in an auto accident over a year ago. He is portrayed as a complex man who was totally dedicated to his sport and his team, to the detriment, at times, of his family life. This is a wonderful film to see with the entire family.

After all, they hadn't been beaten in 15 years. But it could be done. Coach Brooks kept telling his 19 year-old players to play their game and to take the fight to the Russians. They had to WANT it. In some games, the players had given less than 100%, and coach Brooks would not stand for it.But first things first. The team had to become a cohesive unit. And, even if it were never to become the best team in the world, it had to become the best conditioned team in the world. This took time. Finally, even if they were not better than the Russians overall, they HAD to be the better team that particular night.The politics at the time was clear.

Munson,"[2, 2]","There have been many defining moments in U.S. Sports, such as Don Larsen's perfect game in the world series, or Babe Ruth's ""called shot', but no individual or team captured the heart and essence of America like the 1980 men's Olympic hockey team.  What started out as a group of college individuals seven months before the games began were melded into a cohesive team formed in the hard-nosed image of their coach, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell).This team was not given much of a chance against the powerhouse eastern-bloc countries.  The Soviet Union team had beaten a team of NHL all-stars rather easily, and had won every Olympic gold medal since 1960.  The Swiss and Czech teams were also considered out of the U.S team's class.Undaunted, Brooks prepared his team to beat the Soviets at their own game; pass and attack.  This approach didn't fare to well in a pre-Olympic tune-up game at  Madison Square Garden, where the Soviets beat the U.S. 10-3.Once the Olympics began, the Americans began to surprise people with their level of play.  Not expected to reach the medal round, the U.S complied an undefeated 4-0-1 record in the preliminaries, the tie coming against Sweden in the first game.  This vaulted the U.S. into the medal round and another match with the Soviets.  This time, the U.S. was not afraid.  Behind the extraordinary goaltending of Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), the U.S. won the game 4-3 in what is considered the greatest upset in Olympic history.  The U.S. Team went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finland in the gold medal game.This is a superb movie.  Kurt Russell' s portrayal of head coach Herb Brooks is simply perfect.  Russell brings out every quality of Brooks; from his passion to be the best to his unbelievable drive to have his players succeed and believe in themselves.  It was this constant encouragement from Brooks that ultimately helped the players achieve their goal.  Noah Emmerich (ass't coach Craig Patrick), Eddie Cahill (Jim Craig) and Patrick O'Brien Demsey (Mike Eruzonie) give excelent performances as well.I was 15 years old when the U.S won the gold medal in hockey.  I can remember the tremendous feeling of pride that these men gave to the United States at a time when the U.S. was down with high unemployment and the capture of the hostages in Iran.  These men will be heroes forever.  Its a tragedy that Herb Brooks passed away before being able to see this wonderful memoir of a few months that paved the way to Olympic history.  I highly recommend this movie.  You'll stand and cheer, you'll get chills during Al Michaels' call of the U.S.-Soviet game, and you'll see how a group of college kids banded together to become legends.",5,One of the Greatest Moments in U.S. Sports,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2690,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'defining', 'moments', 'U.S.', 'Sports', 'such', 'Don', 'Larsen', 'perfect', 'game', 'world', 'series', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'called', 'shot', 'individual', 'team', 'captured', 'heart', 'essence', 'America', '1980', 'men', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'team', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'group', 'college', 'individuals', 'seven', 'months', 'games', 'began', 'were', 'melded', 'cohesive', 'team', 'formed', 'hard-nosed', 'image', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Kurt', 'Russell', '.This', 'team', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'chance', 'powerhouse', 'eastern-bloc', 'countries', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'team', 'had', 'beaten', 'team', 'NHL', 'all-stars', 'rather', 'easily', 'had', 'won', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', '1960', 'Swiss', 'Czech', 'teams', 'were', 'also', 'considered', 'U.S', 'team', 'class.Undaunted', 'Brooks', 'prepared', 'team', 'beat', 'Soviets', 'own', 'game', 'pass', 'attack', 'approach', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'pre-Olympic', 'tune-up', 'game', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'where', 'Soviets', 'beat', 'U.S.', '10-3.Once', 'Olympics', 'began', 'Americans', 'began', 'surprise', 'people', 'level', 'play', 'Not', 'expected', 'reach', 'medal', 'round', 'U.S', 'complied', 'undefeated', '4-0-1', 'record', 'preliminaries', 'tie', 'coming', 'Sweden', 'first', 'game', 'vaulted', 'U.S.', 'medal', 'round', 'match', 'Soviets', 'time', 'U.S.', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'extraordinary', 'goaltending', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'U.S.', 'won', 'game', '4-3', 'what', 'considered', 'greatest', 'upset', 'Olympic', 'history', 'U.S', 'Team', 'went', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'defeating', 'Finland', 'gold', 'medal', 'game.This', 'superb', 'movie', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 's', 'portrayal', 'head', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Russell', 'out', 'quality', 'Brooks', 'passion', 'be', 'best', 'unbelievable', 'drive', 'have', 'players', 'succeed', 'believe', 'was', 'constant', 'encouragement', 'Brooks', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'players', 'achieve', 'goal', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', ""ass't"", 'coach', 'Craig', 'Patrick', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'Demsey', 'Mike', 'Eruzonie', 'give', 'excelent', 'performances', 'well.I', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'U.S', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'hockey', 'can', 'remember', 'tremendous', 'feeling', 'pride', 'men', 'gave', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'when', 'U.S.', 'was', 'down', 'high', 'unemployment', 'capture', 'hostages', 'Iran', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'heroes', 'forever', 'tragedy', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'passed', 'away', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'wonderful', 'memoir', 'few', 'months', 'paved', 'way', 'Olympic', 'history', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'cheer', ""'ll"", 'get', 'chills', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'call', 'U.S.-Soviet', 'game', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'banded', 'together', 'become', 'legends']",N/A

I'll watch the occasional few minutes of Michael Jordan in a tense playoff or a fantastically close Super Bowl on occasion, but beyond that, I have no interest.I do find  few movies about the fanatics who drives themselves to excel interesting or the fanatics who drive people to excel, to go far beyond what they themselves thought possible.That's what ""Miracle"" is all about, a coach named Herb Brooks who drove a group of mostly collegiate hocky players to fuse into an Olympics winning team, trumping the Soviets, who had won four consecutive championships.Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks. What we see is a narrow, driven man who has only one goal: to produce an Olympics winning hockey team through his coaching. And Russell conveys that image beautifully, leaving us with an impressiona of a guy we probably wouldn't want to spend any time with (and, likewise, we would be of no interest to him) who ignored his family and browbeat 20 some kids into submission until they became a functioning team.It's a great movie about a coach. The players, as they were in the real incident, were submerged to the coach's will and ego. The hockey scenes are exciting. I don't know enough about hockey to comment on their authenticity and, frankly, I don't care.In the end, it is the story of a driven, selfish man demanding that his recruits obey his every order and become, to a large extent, automatons until they fuse into a single whole, a team. Look closely and you will see the techniques of every successful army since the beginning of time: slavish obediance while preserving the capability to make individual decisions. It worked for Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, George Patton and Herb Brooks, when he applied it to hockey.A lot of the film centers on rah-rah American patriotism which needed a boost after feckless Presidency of Jimmy Carter who cancelled American participation in the 1980 Summer Olympics to ""protest"" the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It is a nice feeling to see the United States portrayed positively in a Hollywood movie, for a change.Overall, ""Miracle"" is an entertaining movie about an eccentric coach, the team he built and the results they acheived.

813069,APRU373UYVK2Y,B0001US66E,J. N. Mohlman,"[121, 126]","As the Cold War fades into memory, it is hard to explain the on-going, almost mystical fascination with The Miracle on Ice; the defeat of the vaunted Soviets by a bunch of unknown American college kids.  Yes, national pride plays a big role, and more generally everyone loves an underdog.  But I think what has really made this event such a cultural touchstone is the pure joy that surrounded it.  Across the nation, and the world, for a myriad of reasons, but distilled and purified in the players and coaches who pursued their dream not for fame and fortune, but because the only dreams worth chasing are the hard ones.""Miracle"" captures this spirit down to the smallest nuance; in a day and age when you are as likely to read about athletes in the police blotter as the sports page, it is refreshing to watch people play for the pure joy of sport and love of the game.  The ability to capture this love of the game was made possible by the fact that every single one of the actors portraying a hockey player was first and foremost an actual hockey player.  That's not to say they can't act, but they sought out the opportunity because they have scored Eruzione's game winning goal a thousand times on a rink or pond or even on asphalt and they wanted an opportunity to tap into a little bit of that magic.  They didn't audition for ""Miracle"", they tried out for it, and once they had the job, they went to training camp to prepare for filming.  This attention to detail comes through in spades; I know hockey, but you don't have to be an expert to realize these guys are in great shape and have been on the receiving end of a check more than once.In contrast to these raw and unseasoned actors stands Kurt Russell, a Hollywood veteran (and admittedly a very big hockey fan). His portrayal of Herb Brooks is dead on; from the voice and mannerisms down to the single minded determination to beat the best team in the world.  Moreover, his punishing conditioning regimen and mind-bending schemes are accurately portrayed without bogging down in details that would likely bore even dedicated fans.  The supporting cast is likewise strong, and wisely limited in large part to just Brooks' wife and assistants.  This focus mirrors the way Brooks lived the game and minimizes distractions.So the film has real hockey players and fine actors in all the key roles but the most daunting task for the director still remained: how to portray a game where the outcome is know when the NHL hasn't found an entirely effective view for live games.  The answer was to use as many ice level shots as possible, which serves a twofold purpose.  The first is that it is much easier to follow the puck when it is the focus of the shot, and at the same time, when a hit or injury is the key part of the scene, the puck isn't a distraction.  The other reason this approach is successful is because this player's eye view of the ice injects a sense of urgency that makes victory seem in doubt even when it is a known factor.  A corollary to this approach is in the narrative of the game with the Soviets; the director wisely chose not to reinvent the wheel and used Al Michael's definitive call, which includes key commentary from Ken Dryden which can be informative for the non-hockey fan.In the end, what this all adds up to is the perfect encapsulation of the joy I referenced above.  The cold hard fact is that we are unlikely to ever see such joy in sport again, as professionals have come to dominate Olympic team sports and high schoolers join the pro ranks as soon as they graduate and middle schoolers go to strength and conditioning camps under relentless pressure from their parents.  What ""Miracle"" portrays is a joy born of a love of competition, a love of sport and a love of teammates that has become all too rare.  That's not to say that this movie only portrays sunshine and roses, but the ultimate goal transcended any one individual.  Some of the best scenes in the movie have nothing to do with hockey, but rather the camaraderie that comes from sharing simple things with good friends.Superb in its portrayal of perhaps the greatest sporting event of all time in every aspect - from acting to wardrobe to the game on the ice, ""Miracle"" is an absolute joy to watch.  It wisely frames the geo-political import of the game and then sets it aside, focusing instead on the beauty of sport and the satisfaction of hard earned accomplishments.Jake Mohlman.",5,When the actors aren't acting,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,4448,"['Cold', 'War', 'memory', 'hard', 'explain', 'on-going', 'almost', 'mystical', 'fascination', 'Miracle', 'Ice', 'defeat', 'vaunted', 'Soviets', 'bunch', 'unknown', 'American', 'college', 'kids', 'Yes', 'national', 'pride', 'big', 'role', 'more', 'generally', 'everyone', 'underdog', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'event', 'cultural', 'touchstone', 'pure', 'joy', 'surrounded', 'nation', 'world', 'myriad', 'reasons', 'distilled', 'purified', 'players', 'coaches', 'who', 'pursued', 'dream', 'not', 'fame', 'fortune', 'only', 'chasing', 'are', 'hard', 'ones', 'Miracle', 'spirit', 'down', 'smallest', 'nuance', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'are', 'as', 'likely', 'read', 'athletes', 'police', 'blotter', 'sports', 'page', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'people', 'play', 'pure', 'joy', 'sport', 'love', 'game', 'ability', 'capture', 'love', 'game', 'was', 'made', 'possible', 'fact', 'single', 'one', 'actors', 'portraying', 'hockey', 'player', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'actual', 'hockey', 'player', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'sought', 'out', 'opportunity', 'have', 'scored', 'Eruzione', 'game', 'winning', 'goal', 'thousand', 'times', 'rink', 'pond', 'even', 'asphalt', 'wanted', 'opportunity', 'tap', 'little', 'bit', 'magic', 'did', ""n't"", 'audition', 'Miracle', 'tried', 'out', 'once', 'had', 'job', 'went', 'training', 'camp', 'prepare', 'filming', 'attention', 'detail', 'spades', 'know', 'hockey', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'expert', 'realize', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'shape', 'have', 'been', 'receiving', 'end', 'check', 'more', 'once.In', 'contrast', 'raw', 'unseasoned', 'actors', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'admittedly', 'very', 'big', 'hockey', 'fan', 'portrayal', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'dead', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'single', 'minded', 'determination', 'beat', 'best', 'team', 'world', 'Moreover', 'punishing', 'conditioning', 'regimen', 'mind-bending', 'schemes', 'are', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'bogging', 'down', 'details', 'would', 'likely', 'bore', 'even', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'strong', 'wisely', 'limited', 'large', 'part', 'just', 'Brooks', 'wife', 'assistants', 'focus', 'way', 'Brooks', 'lived', 'game', 'distractions.So', 'film', 'real', 'hockey', 'players', 'fine', 'actors', 'key', 'roles', 'most', 'daunting', 'task', 'director', 'still', 'remained', 'how', 'portray', 'game', 'where', 'outcome', 'know', 'when', 'NHL', ""n't"", 'found', 'entirely', 'effective', 'view', 'live', 'games', 'answer', 'was', 'use', 'many', 'ice', 'level', 'shots', 'possible', 'twofold', 'purpose', 'first', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'puck', 'when', 'focus', 'shot', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'hit', 'injury', 'key', 'part', 'scene', 'puck', ""n't"", 'distraction', 'other', 'reason', 'approach', 'successful', 'player', 'eye', 'view', 'ice', 'sense', 'urgency', 'victory', 'seem', 'doubt', 'even', 'when', 'known', 'factor', 'corollary', 'approach', 'narrative', 'game', 'Soviets', 'director', 'wisely', 'chose', 'not', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'used', 'Al', 'Michael', 'definitive', 'call', 'key', 'commentary', 'Ken', 'Dryden', 'can', 'be', 'informative', 'non-hockey', 'fan.In', 'end', 'what', 'up', 'perfect', 'encapsulation', 'joy', 'referenced', 'cold', 'hard', 'fact', 'are', 'unlikely', 'ever', 'see', 'such', 'joy', 'sport', 'again', 'professionals', 'have', 'come', 'dominate', 'Olympic', 'team', 'sports', 'high', 'schoolers', 'join', 'pro', 'ranks', 'as', 'soon', 'graduate', 'middle', 'schoolers', 'go', 'strength', 'conditioning', 'camps', 'relentless', 'pressure', 'parents', 'What', 'Miracle', 'portrays', 'joy', 'born', 'love', 'competition', 'love', 'sport', 'love', 'teammates', 'become', 'too', 'rare', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'only', 'sunshine', 'roses', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'transcended', 'one', 'individual', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'hockey', 'rather', 'camaraderie', 'sharing', 'simple', 'things', 'good', 'friends.Superb', 'portrayal', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'sporting', 'event', 'time', 'aspect', 'acting', 'wardrobe', 'game', 'ice', 'Miracle', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'wisely', 'geo-political', 'import', 'game', 'then', 'aside', 'focusing', 'instead', 'beauty', 'sport', 'satisfaction', 'hard', 'earned', 'accomplishments.Jake', 'Mohlman']",N/A

You know, the one that shockingly beat the dominant Soviet team, a Soviet team so strong it was beating the NHL All Stars in exhibition games. I knew this, but I didn't really understand. ""Miracle"" is the story of the 1980 team and follows the team from the formation to the conclusion at the Lake Placid Olympics.We open with coach Herb Brooks (a nearly unrecognizable Kurt Russell) talking to a group of me, probably the US Olympic Committee about his vision for the squad and how he would like to form the team. He doesn't want to pick the best players, he wants to pick the best team. He knows this is the only way to have a chance against the Soviets who work so well as a team against the All Star Teams which are made up of individuals. Making the players into a team will be a challenge, one which is suggested throughout the movie as Coach Brooks asks the players their name and what team they play for and the players give their names and then their college (University of Minnesota, Boston College, University of Wisconsin, etc). It is easy to tell what answer Brooks is going for and not going and it is a bit later in the film that Brooks gets the answer he wants and that the viewer knows is a key turning point.One would think that knowing exactly how the movie has to end would rob ""Miracle"" of dramatic tension. Somehow the director is able to make the viewer doubt that this team really is good enough to win in the Olympics at all, let alone to face the mighty Soviet squad which had won the previous four Gold medals for Hockey. Even when we get to the Gold Medal match is the ending in doubt. The US may have won their previous games, but these are the mighty Soviets. So much credit has to go to the filmmakers, the actors, the director, and the editor for cutting this film together in such a way that even knowing the ending does not lessen the impact of the ending, the emotion of the ending.It is clear that I like this movie. It is a ""feel good"" movie in the best sense of the phrase because it isn't sappy and sweet, but a hard played game that brought out the best in the players and the underdog (which the United States is not used to being) is able to come out on top in the end-Joe Sherry",5,one of the best sports movies,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,2470,"['someone', 'who', 'watched', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'twenty', 'years', 'been', 'watching', 'sports', 'general', 'perhaps', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'United', 'States', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'Team', '1980', 'know', 'one', 'shockingly', 'beat', 'dominant', 'Soviet', 'team', 'Soviet', 'team', 'so', 'strong', 'was', 'beating', 'NHL', 'All', 'Stars', 'exhibition', 'games', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'Miracle', 'story', '1980', 'team', 'team', 'formation', 'conclusion', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Olympics.We', 'open', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'talking', 'group', 'probably', 'US', 'Olympic', 'Committee', 'vision', 'squad', 'how', 'would', 'like', 'form', 'team', ""n't"", 'want', 'pick', 'best', 'players', 'pick', 'best', 'team', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'chance', 'Soviets', 'who', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'team', 'All', 'Star', 'Teams', 'are', 'made', 'individuals', 'Making', 'players', 'team', 'will', 'be', 'challenge', 'one', 'suggested', 'movie', 'Coach', 'Brooks', 'players', 'name', 'what', 'team', 'play', 'players', 'give', 'names', 'then', 'college', 'University', 'Minnesota', 'Boston', 'College', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'etc', 'easy', 'tell', 'what', 'answer', 'Brooks', 'going', 'not', 'going', 'bit', 'later', 'film', 'Brooks', 'answer', 'viewer', 'key', 'turning', 'point.One', 'would', 'think', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'end', 'would', 'rob', 'Miracle', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Somehow', 'director', 'able', 'make', 'viewer', 'doubt', 'team', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'win', 'Olympics', 'let', 'alone', 'face', 'mighty', 'Soviet', 'squad', 'had', 'won', 'previous', 'four', 'Gold', 'medals', 'Hockey', 'Even', 'when', 'get', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'match', 'ending', 'doubt', 'US', 'may', 'have', 'won', 'previous', 'games', 'are', 'mighty', 'Soviets', 'So', 'much', 'credit', 'go', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'director', 'editor', 'cutting', 'film', 'together', 'such', 'way', 'even', 'knowing', 'ending', 'not', 'lessen', 'impact', 'ending', 'emotion', 'ending.It', 'clear', 'like', 'movie', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'best', 'sense', 'phrase', ""n't"", 'sappy', 'sweet', 'hard', 'played', 'game', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'players', 'underdog', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'used', 'being', 'able', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'end-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

This is false.  The NHL starts their season in October.  Why would they play an All-Star game?The actual event was a three-game series played in February, 1979, in place of the league's annual All-Star Game.  It was won by the Soviets 2 games to 1, with the final game being the aforementioned 6-0 result.Since Herb Brooks was named coach of the team in June 79, there is no way he could have been watching that sportscast showing highlights of the game at the airport with his team.Other than this blunder, the film was pretty good, utilizing real hockey players rather than actors to play hockey players.  This gives the hockey scenes (and there are plenty) much credibility.  And for a near two and a half hour movie, it didn't feel that long, as the hockey makes the movie fly.  In fact, the ending feels kind of abrupt.  They didn't expand much into the Finland game, which was the actual gold medal winning game.  Historians seem to always neglect that game.  It is a shame too, because if we don't win that game, we don't win gold.  And what was up with the gray Finland jerseys?  In the real game they wore white.

The highlight for the U.S. was Dorothy Hamill winning the ladies' figure skating gold medal.  I remember watching everything, especially downhill skiing.  I really liked those winter games, so when the Lake Placid games started four years later, I was very interested in watching it.  Those were the games of Eric Heiden winning five speed skating gold medals, Robin Cousins, Ingemar Stenmark, and......of course......the Miracle On Ice.The U.S. men's hockey team wasn't favored to win ANY medal, let alone the gold medal.  But they played extremely well in the tournament, then had to face the Soviet Union, the world's best team and a team that had just defeated the U.S. 10-3 in an exhibition game in New York's Madison Square Garden less than two weeks earlier.  Well, we all know what happened - a 4-3 victory for the U.S.  EVERYBODY was watching this game - THE WHOLE COUNTRY.  The 1980 winter games were tension-filled due to the political climate of the time period (the Cold War) and the fact that the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan two months earlier, not to mention the fact that President Jimmy Carter had already talked about boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics that were held in Moscow later that year.  Sporting events often are a way for people to take out their frustrations on things that bother them, and winning makes everyone feel pride and glory.  This game vs. the Soviets is THE prime example of this.  After defeating the heavily favored Soviet Union, the U.S. then defeated Finland 4-2 to win the gold medal two days later.Miracle (2004) is a great re-telling of the Miracle On Ice.  Rated PG, it is 135 minutes long and stars Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks and many good actors who play the roles of the 20 or so players that made up the hockey team.  The acting overall is good.  The overall feel of the movie is key.  When I watch the movie, I really do feel like I'm re-living February 1980.  ABC Sportscaster Al Michaels does a play-by-play voiceover throughout.  The musical score by Mark Isham is good.  You'll also hear some songs from around that time period.  I especially like the use of (Don't Fear) The Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult.  This is a 2-DVD set that has over four hours of extras, including ""The Making Of Miracle"", audio commentary, a conversation between Kurt Russell and Herb Brooks, outtakes, a featurette about turning hockey players into actors called ""From Hockey To Hollywood: The Actors' Journey"", an ESPN Roundtable with Linda Cohn, Mike Eruzione, Buzz Schneider, Jim Craig, and Kurt Russell, and ""The Sound Of Miracle"" featurette.This is a great set to own.

(As to those ""reviewers"" who claim the Soviets threw the game?  Utter pathetic nonsense.  The venom and hatred spewed forth by some of these ""reviewers"" is absolutely unreal and beyond my comprehension. Maybe it does speak volumes as to how good the movie really is.)The movie opens with a montage of film clips from the 1970's.  Don't just read the opening credits.  Watch and listen.  By the time the movie itself actually begins, you can feel the funk this nation was in at the close of the decade.  Therein lies the importance of that ""hockey game"".  The economy was stagnant.  The Soviet Union was ascendant.  The U.S., post-Watergate and post-Vietnam, was adrift and lacking in confidence.  Along come a bunch of college kids, bringing down the Soviet hockey ogre that had dominated international hockey for 20 years, and was considered to be unbeatable.Kurt Russell nails Herb Brooks, possibly Russell's best acting performance ever.  Unlike a lot of his earlier movies, throughout Miracle, although you know it is ""Kurt Russell"" playing Brooks, you do not see Kurt Russell.  You ""see"" Herb Brooks.  While some seem to react negatively to the Herb Brooks character, he coached at a time when a coach was expected to push his kids to the limit in order to make them achieve.  In today's more ""sensitive"" times, maybe we could not have a Herb Brooks?But the kids stole the movie.  The overwhelming majority of them were hockey players first, with little or no acting experience, and they were wonderful (including one kid whose father actually played on the 1980 team).  Michael Mantenuto as Jack O'Callahan and Eddie Cahill (some acting experience) as goalie Jim Craig, nearly steal the movie.This country probably needed to chant ""USA!  USA!"" a few times at the end of the 1970's, and the ""Miracle on Ice"" team let us do it.  So enjoy the movie, and the anticipation of one of the most famous endings in sports (""You've got ten seconds . . . . ""), as the end of the game against the Soviets draws to and end ("". . . . the count down going on right now . . . .""), and Al Michaels makes the final call of the game ("". . . .Morrow up to Silk . . .

What can only be conceived from the minds of Hollywood is actually the story of the 1980 U.S.A. Olympic hockey team that shocked the world by defeating the insurmountable Russians in the semi-finals, known as ""the miracle on ice,"" and then finishing off Finland for the coveted gold medal. ""Miracle"" is a typical sport movie but it still succeeds because it avoids most sport clich&eacute;s.Another positive note to ""Miracle"" is that they treat the game of hockey pretty straight forward. The drills and games are shot realistically with no fanciful things. The opposing teams do not have a unique personality but simply ordinary players like the U.S.A. team with an urge to win. Nothing is ever overdone. Moreover, even though we know the fate of the team and the games, the movie does a fabulous job in maintaining suspense. What the movie does do a bad job on is that it knows where it is heading but leaves the audience behind. What stage are they in? What is the importance of this game? Are they qualifying or are they already in there? These were the sorts of question that I asked myself during the courses of their game.In spite of all the clich&eacute;s and mismanagement of certain plot points, Kurt Russell alone is worth the price of admission. It is always fascinating to see an obsessive coach but even more intriguing knowing that he is a real person. ""Miracle"" certainly is a feel-good movie and it will leave a proud grin in your face.

813088,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0001US66E,L.A. Scene,"[3, 3]","There is little question when one looks at what is one of the great sports stories our the 20th Century, the Gold Medal Victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics by the Men's United States Hockey team has to rank up there as one of the top ones.  This was highlighted by an improbable victory over the Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. ""Miracle"" is a movie that tells the story of Herb Brooks (who sadly died in an auto accident shortly before the film's release).  He is the coach that led the U.S. team to that 1980 gold medal.  This is a movie that is highlighted by one of the great acting performances of recent years by Kurt Russell who would play Brooks.At the time, when it came to the Olympics -  there was still debate over what exactly ""amateur"" status meant.  We took it as those players who did not play in a professional league as being eligible.  It was very different in the Eastern Bloc and Communist countries where players basically played for state-controlled hockey teams - thus all had amateur status.  As a result, countries like the United States and Canada were not sending the best players to the Olympics.  In the case of Men's Hockey, the teams in the 1970s were basically formed as a collection of College All Stars.  As a result, our teams were completely overmatched in International competition by these foreign powers.  It was Brooks who was selected by the Olympic committee as the coach who would put together a team that would make the improbable run at the gold medal.The term ""Miracle"" comes from announcer Al Michaels.  Michaels was the play-by-play man for Hockey at the 1980 Olympics (In ""Miracle"", Michaels' commentary with Ken Dryden is widely featured).  When the U.S. would beat the Soviet Union, Michaels coined the famous expression ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"".  As for this movie, this ultimately has an ending that most people know about (although the U.S. had to be Finland following the Soviet Union win in order to get gold - which they did).  So the strength of this movie isn't so much the story, it is around the coach - Herb Brooks.Kurt Russell gives one of the great performances in any movie.  It is definitely the top performance he has given in his career.  I'm completely surprised that this performance didn't garner a Academy Award nomination (in my opinion, he should have won the award)  My memories of Herb Brooks were one as a stoic coach - most notably the stoic coach of some mediocre New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, and Pittsburgh Penguins teams.  ""Miracle"" brings out a whole new side to Brooks.  Despite the fact that Herb Brooks himself was a consultant to the movie - this side of Brooks was one that can be validated by many of the players who played on that Hockey team.  We see a coach who was passionate about the game, winning, and most importantly his country.  A good part of this movie is devoted to Brooks' obsession of defeating the Soviets.  This is evident when there was talk of a boycott of the Moscow games could cause the Soviets to pull out of the 1980 games.  Ultimately it is Russell's performance that is going to make us believe that he really is Herb Brooks.  The movie's most emotional scene is when Herb Brooks holds a grueling late night workout - even as the arena was about to shut down and the lights were turned off.  While I always thought of Herb as a laid-back coach, this completely changed my perception of him.  Another point that I found interesting is how Herb Brooks had to meld the personalities of the players from two the hotbeds of Collegiate Hockey - Boston and Minnesota.It is worth noting that this is not the first movie made about the U.S. Men's Gold Medal run.  Shortly after the victory, ABC did a made for TV movie called ""Miracle on Ice"".  This movie also told the story of the U.S. Men's Gold Medal Run.  This movie did feature a much more stoic Herb Brooks - this one was played by Karl Malden.  While ""Miracle"" really focuses more on Brooks himself, ""Miracle on Ice"" focused more on the team - most notably the relationship of Brooks and his team captain Mike Eruzione (played by Andrew Stevens, but also featured Steve Guttenberg as Jim Craig).  ""Miracle on Ice"" seemed to dramatize things more to make an interesting story.  In a lot of ways, I prefer the approach taken in ""Miracle"" to do a character study on Herb Brooks instead.Another thing I like about ""Miracle"" is how they cast the players in the movie.  Instead of trying to cast big name actors and try to either make them Hockey players or use doubles, Director Gavin O'Connor goes the opposite route.  He decides to cast actual Hockey players and make them actors.  The formula seems to work because you get some incredible skating sequences on the ice.  In fact real-life U.S. Olympic Hockey Player Buzz Schneider is played by his son Billy.  As a result, you aren't going to have the players have as prominent a role in the story, but they still get the job done.Finally it is worth noting the movie's opening does a great job at setting the tone of the morale of the country in early 1980.  The country was still on the heels of Watergate, the Vietnam War, the Energy Crisis, the Iranian Hostage situation, and inflation.  The morale was ripe for a bunch of heroes to emerge as boost the morale.  Perhaps this is what launched what Ronald Reagan would term ""The New Patriotism"".Overall, this is a very good movie.  Despite the fact that most people are going to know the ending, it's still a terrific character study.  Russell's performance will have you wanting more.  Highly recommended.",4,An Outstanding Character Study of Herb Brooks,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,5595,"['little', 'question', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'one', 'great', 'sports', 'stories', '20th',

813089,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001US66E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[43, 44]","The first hockey games I ever watched were during the 1980 Winter Olympics and I know I was not alone in that respect.  It took a while to understand what a blue line had to do with icing the puck and I have never gotten past the idea of what basketball would be like if it was played the same way as hockey (you are allowed to foul the guy with the puck/ball).  But I remember watching the games the U.S. Hockey Team played against the Soviet Union and Finland.  How big was the miracle that Al Michaels proclaimed during the final seconds of the semi-final match against the Soviets?  Well, when ""Sports Illustrated"" came out the next week there was no need for a headline or caption on the cover photo of the U.S. team celebrating.Knowing what is going to happen in ""Miracle"" is important because if we did not know that this team is going to win the gold medal then we might suspect the means that coach Herb Brooks (Kirk Russell) is using to achieve that end.  Brooks is haunted by the 1960 Winter Olympics, when he was cut from the U.S. team a week before it won the gold medal.  It was also the last year the Americans beat the Soviets on the ice and Brooks knows how to pull off the upset against the best hockey team on the planet.  All it will take is a team that he handpicks playing the way he wants them to play.The best part of this film is watching how Brooks does exactly that and then becomes basically a spectator and cheerleader when his team goes out and wins the gold medal.  Director Gavin O'Connor hits a bulls eye with the casting of Russell, who should get serious Oscar consideration for his performance.  The hard driven coach who puts his sport before his wife and family is something of a clich&eacute;, but what matters here is how Brooks' determination and intelligence comes through as he molds his team.The production also scores because they went out and got hockey players to act instead of trying to fake us out the other way around.  The only real professional actor on the team is Eddie Cahill, but he plays goalie Jim Craig.  You can put anybody you want behind a mask in goal on the ice (former Edmonton Oilers' goalie Bill Ranford in fact) and because Craig was such high maintenance and high profile he was the one role where you needed to up the acting level.  But Michael Mantenuto as Jack O'Callahan, Patrick O'Brien Dempsey as Mike Eruzione, Nathan West as Rob McLanahan, Eric Peter-Kaiser as Mark Johnson, and the other 15 players on the team are playing exactly what they are: hockey players brought together to create a team.One thing I was surprised about in the film was that there is never an explicitly stated reason why Eruzione was picked as the team captain.  Yet in the context of the film I was right in thinking that I knew exactly what Eruzione was going to do that was going to make him stand out as first among his teammates.  (You will know what I am talking about when the moment comes).The fidelity to recreating the moments we remember from the 1980 Olympics was quite impressive.  You can check out the added features on this two-disc DVD set to see direct comparisons of the television footage from the actual games with the movie's re-creations as well as the techniques used to give you a dynamic feeling of being on the ice.  Of course getting Al Michaels to ""call"" the games again was a necessity and it is not surprising that they worked in the original version of his famous line that gives the movie its title.  You can re-create history but you cannot really improve on it, although this 2004 film does a nice job of trying to accomplish that particular feat. I just wonder if those who know nothing about what happened at Lake Placid in 1980 can appreciate that as much as those of us who do.",4,"""You don't have enough talent to win on talent alone...""",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,3769,"['first', 'hockey', 'games', 'ever', 'watched', 'were', '1980', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'respect', 'took', 'while', 'understand', 'what', 'blue', 'line', 'had', 'do', 'icing', 'puck', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'idea', 'what', 'basketball', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'played', 'same', 'way', 'hockey', 'are', 'allowed', 'foul', 'guy', 'puck/ball', 'remember', 'watching', 'games', 'U.S.', 'Hockey', 'Team', 'played', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Finland', 'How', 'big', 'was', 'miracle', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'proclaimed', 'final', 'seconds', 'semi-final', 'match', 'Soviets', 'Well', 'when', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'came', 'next', 'week', 'was', 'need', 'headline', 'caption', 'cover', 'photo', 'U.S.', 'team', 'celebrating.Knowing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Miracle', 'important', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'team', 'going', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'then', 'might', 'suspect', 'means', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Kirk', 'Russell', 'using', 'achieve', 'end', 'Brooks', 'haunted', '1960', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'when', 'was', 'cut', 'U.S.', 'team', 'week', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'year', 'Americans', 'beat', 'Soviets', 'ice', 'Brooks', 'how', 'pull', 'off', 'upset', 'best', 'hockey', 'team', 'planet', 'will', 'take', 'team', 'playing', 'way', 'play.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'watching', 'how', 'Brooks', 'exactly', 'then', 'basically', 'spectator', 'cheerleader', 'when', 'team', 'out', 'gold', 'medal', 'Director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'bulls', 'eye', 'casting', 'Russell', 'who', 'should', 'get', 'serious', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'performance', 'hard', 'driven', 'coach', 'who', 'sport', 'wife', 'family', 'something', 'clich', 'eacute', 'what', 'matters', 'here', 'how', 'Brooks', 'determination', 'intelligence', 'team.The', 'production', 'also', 'went', 'out', 'got', 'hockey', 'players', 'act', 'instead', 'trying', 'fake', 'out', 'other', 'way', 'only', 'real', 'professional', 'actor', 'team', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'goalie', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'can', 'put', 'anybody', 'want', 'mask', 'goal', 'ice', 'former', 'Edmonton', 'Oilers', 'goalie', 'Bill', 'Ranford', 'fact', 'Craig', 'was', 'such', 'high', 'maintenance', 'high', 'profile', 'was', 'one', 'role', 'where', 'needed', 'acting', 'level', 'Michael', 'Mantenuto', 'Jack', ""O'Callahan"", 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'Dempsey', 'Mike', 'Eruzione', 'Nathan', 'West', 'Rob', 'McLanahan', 'Eric', 'Peter-Kaiser', 'Mark', 'Johnson', 'other', '15', 'players', 'team', 'are', 'playing', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'hockey', 'players', 'brought', 'together', 'create', 'team.One', 'thing', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'reason', 'why', 'Eruzione', 'was', 'picked', 'team', 'captain', 'context', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'thinking', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'Eruzione', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'teammates', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'when', 'moment', '.The', 'fidelity', 'recreating', 'moments', 'remember', '1980', 'Olympics', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'added', 'features', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'see', 'direct', 'comparisons', 'television', 'footage', 'actual', 'games', 'movie', 're-creations', 'as', 'well', 'techniques', 'used', 'give', 'dynamic', 'feeling', 'being', 'ice', 'course', 'getting', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'call', 'games', 'again', 'was', 'necessity', 'not', 'surprising', 'worked', 'original', 'version', 'famous', 'line', 'movie', 'title', 'can', 're-create', 'history', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'improve', '2004', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'particular', 'feat', 'just', 'wonder', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'what', 'happened', 'Lake', 'Placid', '1980', 'can', 'appreciate', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'do']",N/A

Everyone knows it's about the US defeating Russia in 1980 at the Winter Olympics in ice-hockey, but it's so well acted and so true to the actual events, we get to see it unfold again and relive that incredible match.  I barely remember the 1980 games, but I do know how much I love ice-hockey and so this is very interesting to me and is an inspiring movie to everyone out there that shows that with hard work, and enough determination, you can achieve your goals (get it?) and dreams.  These guys were facing such fierce competition, but they were so passionate about helping their country win, they went all out to make it happen.

813093,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0001US66E,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","It is easy to summarize the plot behind this movie.  It is about the 1980 U.S. hockey team that went all the way to gold in the Olympics at Lake Placid.  What is harder to summarize is the era and feelings of the United States at that time, and just what a kick in the behind this game was for the U.S.1980 was a very bad time.  Inflation was horrible.  We recently left Viet Nam, failing to accomplish whatever mission we had.  Students kidnapped Americans from the embassy in Teheran.  We suffered from a president who was tied to a politically motivated hotel break-in and from a president who was unable to effectively deal with politics in Washington, D.C.; then came the 1980 Olympic hockey team.The hockey team of the Soviet Union was the dominant team for 20 years.  They were favored to win the 1980 Olympics.  The U.S. team might have a shot for bronze, if we were lucky.  Instead, the U.S. team kept beating teams that ""everyone"" expected to beat the U.S.  Americans began holding their breath as the team played each new opponent, and won.  It was amazing.  The gold medal game against Finland was almost an anti-climax after the game against the Soviet Union.  While Coach Brooks was there to play hockey and go all the way, the biggest hurdle was going to be the tough, professional Soviet team.This movie captures it all; the feeling of the era, details of the era, the thrill of each team victory, and Coach Brook's refusal to celebrate any victory until the truly important one.  I was amazed at Kurt Russell's performance.  He is compelling as Coach Brooks.  Brooks is obsessed in his drive to make his team the best, and he skillfully transmits that obsession to his players.  Kurt Russell was perfect for the role of Brooks, and it is one of his finest moments in a movie.This movie is perfect for most members of the family, and may well serve as an inspiration for some family members.  Some younger members of the family may be distressed by the violence of hockey, which is well replicated in this movie.

It's the true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team defeating the unstoppable Soviet Union. It wasn't so much about winning the Olympics ... it was about the U.S. beating the Soviets. Kurt Russell portrays Coach Herb Brooks and is excellent. He plays Brooks in an understated and solid manner (and he's got some really spiffy '80s outfits too ... check out the plaid pants!)- and does a good job of keeping you interested in how he's going to turn this group of kids into an Olympic-Gold-Worthy hockey team.This is not a hockey movie. This is a story about having dreams and giving 110%, not leaving anything on the table, and going for a goal with everything you've got. Yes - everyone before you has failed - yes everyone is expecting you to fail. You still go for it.And then ... This is a hockey movie. As a hockey fan, I thoroughly enjoyed all the game scenes. I can't imagine what it would have been like to watch the actual game on TV in 1980! I'd recommend this movie to anybody (especially hockey fans) and there's no foul language, so it's good for the whole family.Go Team Go!A few favorite parts ...For weeks, Herb asks each player who they play for ... and they would all respond their college team names.

The Russians were undefeated since 1961. And 1960 was the last year we won the ""Gold"". The title of the movie is an apt description of the USA upset at Lake Placid in 1980.This movie shows what it took to mold individuals into a well-coordinated team in just seven months of very hard work. Up until 1980, no team was ever willing to train as hard as was required to defeat the Russian team. Not only is skill on the ice, but actually physical endurance. Our young team of average age of 21 years stepped up to the plate and exceeded that goal.This movie also shows that you cannot win a team sport by choosing the best players and calling them a team. But that it takes a group of team players working together. This movie brought back all the excitement I felt watching the game. And also let's you see what it took back then to be an Olympic team player. Now we use professional players in so called DREAM TEAMS. Well if you ask me, the 1980 team of amateur athletes that brought home the Gold Medal was the Dream Team. And I wish the Olympics had not evolved as it has.This is a movie for everyone. You do not need to know about the sport of ice hockey to enjoy it. It is a pleasure to watch people play for the pure pleasure of the sport instead of money.

It's an understatement to say that hockey was a sport I had little knowledge of, and even less interest in.That changed very dramatically in 1980. For those of you too young to remember the cold war, it's probably hard to understand the national significance attached to sporting and cultural events that pitted the US vs. the Soviet Union: Van Cliburn winning the Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow in 1958; Bobby Fischer defeating Boris Spassky for the world chess championship in 1972; the Soviet basketball team (in an extremely controversial game) ending the US's unbeaten streak in the Olympics that same year; and the Miracle on Ice depicted in this movie. In each case, millions of Americans who had little interest in classical music or chess or basketball or hockey suddenly found themselves very interested indeed. Whether or not these events should have been viewed as Cold War battles, it's simply the case that they were.Having said that, how well does ""Miracle"" recall the events? I think it does so brilliantly, from the casting to the cinematography to the direction -- all of it. It's not hard to believe you're back in 1980.Final note: next to hearing the famed Al Michaels line ""Do you believe in miracles? Yes!"", my favorite scene was a few seconds earlier.

Starting with a fresh uncompromising script, a lot of heart and an incredibly controlled performance by Kurt Russell, this movie shows us how the twenty diverse young men who had never played together before as a team, learn how to become a team.  At first, it may seem Coach Herb Brooks is way too harsh on his team, but as the movie unfolds, we see that he was smart in knowing exactly what had to be done to get the team to the point it reaches.The fiercely unrecognized Patricia Clarkson is marvelous as Brooks' understanding, yet outspoken wife.  Noah Emmerich is very good as Craig, Brooks' assistant coach who takes a while to fully understand Brooks' sometimes questionable coaching tactics.  All the guys playing the hockey players are perfect, with Eddie Cahill and Patrick Sean Dempsey standing out.  But as in the case with the hockey team, it's not a solo effort, rather a group performance helmed by Russell's outstanding performance.

The U.S. men's team went on to win Olympic  Gold that year, for the first time since 1960. I remember watching that game. I wasn't a fan of ice hockey, but neither were most of the viewers glued to their television sets. Only someone living in isolation could have been unaware of the U.S. men's hockey team's unexpected performance at the Olympic Games that year. They had earned a spot in the medal round, against the Soviet Union. This was just as the Cold War was  heating up. The U.S.S.R. had invaded Afghanistan. Americans were being held hostage in Iran. There was a  feeling of national malaise. A young hockey team with more heart than experience had become unlikely heroes, at least in the minds and hearts of Americans. Even so, no one expected them to beat the Soviet Union. We only hoped they would put up a good fight. But win they did, in one of the most memorable televised sporting events ever. ""Miracle"" is a dramatization of that team's journey to the Olympic  games and it's triumphant conclusion twenty-four years ago. I wonder what took Hollywood so long.Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is the hero of the story. He had coached the University of Minnesota Men's Ice Hockey team to 3 NCAA championships when he was hired to coach the U.S. Olympic  team. He proposed to employ a  hybrid of the Soviet and Canadian styles of play, and to rely on teamwork instead of individual talent. The U.S. team had nothing to lose after several dismal Olympic  performances, so they hired him. He spent only one day assembling the right players. And he trained them longer and harder than seemed reasonable to accomplish what seemed unreasonable: to win.""Miracle"" is shot in the color palette, and to some degree the style, of 1970s cinema, which gives the film a  nice period air. The climactic  hockey game, however, employs more modern cinematographic  and editing techniques, which help make it exciting. ""Miracle"" spends a lot of time on that game, and director Gavin O'Conner, cinematographer Dan Stoloff, and editor John Gilroy deserve praise for making it suspenseful, even for those of us who remember  the real thing. Kurt Russell splendidly transforms himself into a middle-aged, stoic, stubborn and very determined Coach Brooks. Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich turn in very nice supporting performances as Brooks' wife Patti and the team's assistant coach Craig Patrick, respectively. There is an awful lot of training footage in this film, some of which should have been cut to trim some length off of ""Miracle""'s slightly bloated two hours and ten minutes. But this is still a nice film. The first half is a little sluggish, although informative. The pacing improves in the second half, and the final hockey game exhibits a lot of skill and delivers a lot of excitement.",4,Relive the Sporting Event that Energized a Nation in 1980.,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,3002,"['1980', 'Winter', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'NY', 'American', 'men', 'ice', 'hockey', 'team', 'comprised', 'young', 'college', 'players', 'took', 'best', 'ice', 'hockey', 'team', 'world', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'won', 'U.S.', 'men', 'team', 'went', 'win', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'year', 'first', 'time', '1960', 'remember', 'watching', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'ice', 'hockey', 'were', 'most', 'viewers', 'glued', 'television', 'sets', 'Only', 'someone', 'living', 'isolation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'unaware', 'U.S.', 'men', 'hockey', 'team', 'unexpected', 'performance', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'year', 'had', 'earned', 'spot', 'medal', 'round', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'just', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'heating', 'up', 'U.S.S.R.', 'had', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'Americans', 'were', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'Iran', 'was', 'feeling', 'national', 'malaise', 'young', 'hockey', 'team', 'more', 'heart', 'experience', 'had', 'become', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'least', 'minds', 'hearts', 'Americans', 'Even', 'so', 'one', 'expected', 'beat', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'only', 'hoped', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'good', 'fight', 'win', 'did', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'televised', 'sporting', 'events', 'ever', 'Miracle', 'dramatization', 'team', 'journey', 'Olympic', 'games', 'triumphant', 'conclusion', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'ago', 'wonder', 'what', 'took', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'long.Coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'hero', 'story', 'had', 'coached', 'University', 'Minnesota', 'Men', 'Ice', 'Hockey', 'team', '3', 'NCAA', 'championships', 'when', 'was', 'hired', 'coach', 'U.S.', 'Olympic', 'team', 'proposed', 'employ', 'hybrid', 'Soviet', 'Canadian', 'styles', 'play', 'rely', 'teamwork', 'instead', 'individual', 'talent', 'U.S.', 'team', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', 'several', 'dismal', 'Olympic', 'performances', 'hired', 'spent', 'only', 'one', 'day', 'assembling', 'right', 'players', 'trained', 'longer', 'harder', 'seemed', 'reasonable', 'accomplish', 'what', 'seemed', 'unreasonable', 'win', 'Miracle', 'shot', 'color', 'palette', 'degree', 'style', '1970s', 'cinema', 'film', 'nice', 'period', 'air', 'climactic', 'hockey', 'game', 'however', 'more', 'modern', 'cinematographic', 'editing', 'techniques', 'help', 'make', 'exciting', 'Miracle', 'lot', 'time', 'game', 'director', 'Gavin', ""O'Conner"", 'cinematographer', 'Dan', 'Stoloff', 'editor', 'John', 'Gilroy', 'deserve', 'praise', 'making', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'who', 'remember', 'real', 'thing', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'splendidly', 'middle-aged', 'stoic', 'stubborn', 'very', 'determined', 'Coach', 'Brooks', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'turn', 'very', 'nice', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Brooks', 'wife', 'Patti', 'team', 'assistant', 'coach', 'Craig', 'Patrick', 'respectively', 'awful', 'lot', 'training', 'footage', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'trim', 'length', 'Miracle', 'slightly', 'bloated', 'two', 'hours', 'ten', 'minutes', 'still', 'nice', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'little', 'sluggish', 'informative', 'pacing', 'improves', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'hockey', 'game', 'lot', 'skill', 'lot', 'excitement']",N/A

'Miracle,' starring Kurt Russell (Vanilla Sky,Escape From L.A.) as Olympic coach Herb Brooks, aims to retell this story as realistically as possible to show the audience what it was like to be a member of that remarkable team and be a part of such an astonishing accomplishment.  The audience gets to see the process of forming such a team from the selection of the coach, to the selection of the players, to the grueling schedule of practice, through several defeats, to eventual success.'Miracle' is a completely successful, realistic depiction of a remarkable event in American sports history.  Herb Brooks and a variety of the members of the real 1980 US hockey team signed on as advisors with Brooks suffering an untimely death during the production.  The contribution of these people enables the goals, action, story, and acting, to be dead-on accurate in its presentation of the events as they took place during the 1980 games.  Kurt Russell shines brightly in his role as the coach of this team; from the Minnesota accent, to the coaching style, Russell's performance is as life-like as acting gets.  All the hockey players are remarkable in their performances, but special attention should be paid to Billy Schneider, the son of Buzz Schneider, who portrays his father in this film, Patrick O'Brien Demsey who perfectly plays the role Mike Eruzione, and Mike Mantenuto, the former UMaine player, who portrays Jack O'Callahan.While there are movies which are much more complex, much deeper, and much more artistically valuable, 'Miracle,' aims to be a simple, but accurate, depiction of this remarkable event in the history of the Cold War. Director Gavin O'Connor succeeds admirably in meeting and surpassing these modest goals.  'Miracle' is strongly recommended to all audiences and a hearty thank you is due to Disney for allowing such an exceptional film to be made.",5,Simply incredible!,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2142,"['1980', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'US', 'Hockey', 'team', 'overcame', 'enormous', 'disadvantages', 'successfully', 'defeat', 'Soviet', 'Hockey', 'team', 'earn', 'gold', 'medal', 'breaking', 'nearly', 'twenty-year', 'winning', 'streak', 'Soviets', 'what', 'was', 'aptly', 'described', 'miracle', 'ice', ""'Miracle"", 'starring', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Escape', 'From', 'L.A.', 'Olympic', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'retell', 'story', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'show', 'audience', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'member', 'remarkable', 'team', 'be', 'part', 'such', 'astonishing', 'accomplishment', 'audience', 'see', 'process', 'forming', 'such', 'team', 'selection', 'coach', 'selection', 'players', 'grueling', 'schedule', 'practice', 'several', 'defeats', 'eventual', 'success', ""'Miracle"", 'completely', 'successful', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'remarkable', 'event', 'American', 'sports', 'history', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'variety', 'members', 'real', '1980', 'US', 'hockey', 'team', 'signed', 'advisors', 'Brooks', 'suffering', 'untimely', 'death', 'production', 'contribution', 'people', 'enables', 'goals', 'action', 'story', 'acting', 'be', 'dead-on', 'accurate', 'presentation', 'events', 'took', 'place', '1980', 'games', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'brightly', 'role', 'coach', 'team', 'Minnesota', 'accent', 'coaching', 'style', 'Russell', 'performance', 'as', 'life-like', 'acting', 'hockey', 'players', 'are', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'special', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'paid', 'Billy', 'Schneider', 'son', 'Buzz', 'Schneider', 'who', 'father', 'film', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'Demsey', 'who', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Mike', 'Eruzione', 'Mike', 'Mantenuto', 'former', 'UMaine', 'player', 'who', 'Jack', ""O'Callahan.While"", 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'much', 'deeper', 'much', 'more', 'artistically', 'valuable', 'be', 'simple', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'remarkable', 'event', 'history', 'Cold', 'War', 'Director', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'admirably', 'meeting', 'surpassing', 'modest', 'goals', ""'Miracle"", 'strongly', 'recommended', 'audiences', 'hearty', 'thank', 'due', 'Disney', 'allowing', 'such', 'exceptional', 'film', 'be', 'made']",N/A

In fact, it seems that so many sports film clich&eacute;s found in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s were somehow inspired from this true story.  The thing is, so many of these clich&eacute;s actually happened...very little was dramatized.  And while I'm not a fan of clich&eacute;s and normally push a film down a notch in the ratings, this film makes up for it's many clich&eacute;s by remaining true to its source material and for showing us the state America was in, enhancing the importance of this now-legendary game.  Personally, I could watch this film over and over again.  I've never had an opinion about Kurt Russell and I don't know that much about Herb Brooks, but I know enough about coaches to say that the former portrayed the latter very well.  It's sad that the real Herb Brooks died in a car accident during production.  But since a great coach only gets a team so far, I will now commend the decision to hire the players for their hockey skills rather than their acting abilities...I think everyone was able to do just fine because they were in their element out on that ice.

The movie was exciting enough for me as well as it brought back memories of an exciting event in US sports history.  I'm not sure it was ""the greatest moment in sport history"" as the cover of the DVD claims, but it was pretty darn good.  I remember it well as do most sports fans who witnessed it live or on tape delay.  The ""miracle"" of course is the US/Soviet hockey game in the semi-final round of the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, NY.  A popular trivia question since then has been, ""Who did the US defeat in the Gold Medal hockey game of the 1980 Olympics?""  Surprizingly, most people get it wrong since, after besting the Soviets, the US still had to go out and beat the Finns.  The Finns get shorted in this movie as well but that can be forgiven since the title of the movie refers to the one game in particular.  The strength of the movie is the focus through the eyes of the coach, the late Herb Brooks.  Through his drive and determination, we see the forging of a team that is able to go beyond itself.  The players are well represented but not over done as was the story of Jim Craig and his dad in the actual coverage in 1980.  That wasn't their fault, however.  That was the fault of a media that felt there had to be a human interest story to every event; a human interst story of their own chosing.  ""Miracle"", by and large, escapes that mistake which is rare for Hollywood and even rarer for Buena Vista Productions.  The build-up for THE GAME is steady and methodic as, I presume, was the coaching of Herb Brooks.  The excitement and enthusiasm is enthralling even though we all know the eventual result.I would have rated this a 4.5 if possible.  I stopped short of giving it a ""5"" mainly because I'd recently seen ""Mystic River"" and felt there's a level of excellence that this movie just doesn't quite achieve.  I also wondered what the point was of including portions of President Carter's ""Malaise"" speech; historical perspective on just how desperate the country was for anything good?

813120,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001US66E,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 33]","Those who made ""Miracle"" seem to think that none of us have ever seen a movie about a sports team before.  Even though it is based on a true story, the film is so derivative and formulaic that you could practically write the screenplay yourself (had scenarist Eric Guggenheim not already done it for you, that is).  Despite the best efforts of Kurt Russell in the lead role, there isn't a single original or surprising moment in the entire 134 minutes that the film takes to drag us through its story.Russell plays Herb Brooks, a hockey coach from Minnesota who fulfills his dream of leading an American team to a gold medal against the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.  Brooks is the ultimate sports film stereotype: a coach driven to extremes to make his team the best that it can be.  More drill sergeant than coach, he pushes his players almost to the breaking point, carrying his ""tough love"" philosophy nearly to the level of sadism.  But, of course, this uncompromising taskmaster is just what this ragtag collection of hockey players needs to achieve cohesion and discipline, break through their underdog status, and pull off a ""miraculous"" win on the ice.  And this is also what eventually earns him the undying respect and allegiance of his players, fellow coaches and financial backers, all of whom greet Brooks with initial skepticism until they see the miracle he is able to perform.It's hard to overestimate just how vapid and corny most of ""Miracle"" turns out to be.  The boys have so little personality that they quickly become both interchangeable as teammates and indistinguishable as individuals.  Patricia Clarkson plays the stereotypical loving wife who nevertheless whines and pouts endlessly because her hubby is devoting all his time to the team and none to the family at home.  Much of the dialogue is of the rah-rah, pep talk, we-are-family variety, made all the more mawkish by a lugubrious symphonic score droning on incessantly in the background.The raison d'etre that is supposed to separate ""Miracle"" from all those countless films that have come before it is the fact that this team beat the Soviets at a time when not only was the Cold War at its height but the Russians had just invaded Afghanistan, the Iranians were holding American citizens hostage, and American motorists were stuck in long gas lines during the peak of the ""energy crisis.""  We even hear a snippet of President Carter's infamous ""malaise"" speech to underscore just how badly Americans were feeling about themselves and how much of a moral boost this victory gave to the beleaguered nation.  The film, however, despite its good intentions, is simply not rich or resonant enough to sustain this broader theme.  Thus, even with all the swelling music and inspirational speeches, ""Miracle"" can't overcome the triteness at its core.

Coaches are generally dry men. And Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, was arid and driven - shunning the U.S. Olympic committee in crafting his team, relegating his assistant (Noah Emmerich) to a whistle-blowing stooge, applying mind tricks to his blue collar squad of players. Russell gets inside Brooks - his tics, body language and &quot;Fargo&quot; accent - to create a decent, winning man, repressed but ambitious, given to celebrating (or genuflecting or even smiling) in private. Brooks' moral rectitude makes for an education - &quot;Miracle&quot; is built for the family library - but the movie is workmanlike and stodgy, too. Were Patricia Clarkson not on hand as &quot;the wife&quot; to jazz up scenes - Clarkson raises domestic performance to a kind of art - Brooks would emerge as an anti-hero.&quot;Miracle&quot; charts the maturity of Brooks' vision, which is to craft a team as the Russians would, on Communist principles - submerging the I for the team, group punishment for individual discretion, a fiendish devotion to sport. &quot;I'm not looking for the best players,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm looking for the right ones.&quot; Socialism fails as a government but not as an ethic of sports organization, and the Russians won four consecutive gold medals honing that theory. Brooks goes so far as to make his team unavailable for interviews at the Olympics, although the savior of those Winter Games, goalie Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), staved off one Russian slapshot after another, opening the door for the Americans to attack the Soviets with a similar offense and deserved at least as much credit as Brooks did, having played nearly every minute for seven months leading into the Lake Placid.The movie's turning point arrives early: After a subpar performance in Norway, Brooks hauls his team back onto the ice and skates them to exhaustion. Director O'Connor takes a risk here, dragging the scene out beyond all cinematic purpose for a thematic one: Brooks yells &quot;again&quot; well after we would have expected &quot;enough,&quot; and yet this gamble works, playing against expectations. Unlike &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; crisply edited into two-minute chunks yet shallow for the choice, Miracle&quot; makes its stand as the lights go out and Brooks nods once more for the whistle.

And that is really what this movie is all about: the power of people working together as a team instead of individually. Nowadays, we are tired of seeing superstars in different team sports that think that they are the greatest thing in the world and that their teammates are just the supporting cast. This is true in the US mostly in football and basketball, and in other countries in the word mainly in soccer.I was born in Uruguay and lived there until the year 2000, and therefore am a big soccer fan. I am tired of seeing the players from my country excel in their European clubs only to see them fail miserably when they play for our country. The reason is that several of them think they are stars when they come to play for Uruguay and neglect to play as a team. They should all get together and give this movie a try!Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is the new coach of the US men's hockey team that will compete in the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid and has a huge task ahead of him. The Soviets dominate the world's ice hockey and US was embarrassed in their last attempt in the Olympiads. But this is not all that Herb has to face in order to succeed. Right from the start he has to fight against the politics surrounding hockey in order to be able to select the players he wants instead of the ones he is supposed to choose. Also, several players carry grudges from their college games and are unwilling to help each other.The movie revolves around the challenges faced when trying to create an efficient team, the stress of competition and the spillover of work into one's personal life and the strain this causes. Of course, if you like ice hockey you are probably going to enjoy this movie a lot. However, if you do not like or understand the sport, you can still enjoy the storyline. In my case, working in a company that has season tickets for the current champion of the National Hockey League, the Tampa Bay Lightning, it was easy enough to start learning about the sport and loving it before watching this production.",4,"""I am not looking for the best players...",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2071,"['am', 'looking', 'right', 'ones', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'power', 'people', 'working', 'together', 'team', 'instead', 'individually', 'Nowadays', 'are', 'tired', 'seeing', 'superstars', 'different', 'team', 'sports', 'think', 'are', 'greatest', 'thing', 'world', 'teammates', 'are', 'just', 'supporting', 'cast', 'true', 'US', 'mostly', 'football', 'basketball', 'other', 'countries', 'word', 'mainly', 'soccer.I', 'was', 'born', 'Uruguay', 'lived', 'year', '2000', 'therefore', 'am', 'big', 'soccer', 'fan', 'am', 'tired', 'seeing', 'players', 'country', 'excel', 'European', 'clubs', 'only', 'see', 'fail', 'miserably', 'when', 'play', 'country', 'reason', 'several', 'think', 'are', 'stars', 'when', 'come', 'play', 'Uruguay', 'neglect', 'play', 'team', 'should', 'get', 'together', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'new', 'coach', 'US', 'men', 'hockey', 'team', 'will', 'compete', 'Winter', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'huge', 'task', 'ahead', 'Soviets', 'dominate', 'world', 'ice', 'hockey', 'US', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'last', 'attempt', 'Olympiads', 'not', 'Herb', 'face', 'order', 'succeed', 'Right', 'start', 'fight', 'politics', 'surrounding', 'hockey', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'select', 'players', 'instead', 'ones', 'supposed', 'choose', 'Also', 'several', 'players', 'carry', 'grudges', 'college', 'games', 'are', 'unwilling', 'help', 'other.The', 'movie', 'challenges', 'faced', 'when', 'trying', 'create', 'efficient', 'team', 'stress', 'competition', 'spillover', 'work', 'one', 'personal', 'life', 'strain', 'course', 'like', 'ice', 'hockey', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'understand', 'sport', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'storyline', 'case', 'working', 'company', 'season', 'tickets', 'current', 'champion', 'National', 'Hockey', 'League', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'Lightning', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'start', 'learning', 'sport', 'loving', 'watching', 'production']",N/A

813134,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B0001US66E,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 3]","MIRACLE(2004) Directed by Gavin OConnorStarring Kurt Russell.It is 1980 and the United States people, buffeted by the Democratic Witchunts called Watergate and their subsequent betrayal of the country in the Vietnam War during the 70s, wake up every day to learn of a new defeat or degradation. The Communists, after having conquered Indochina, have now invaded Afghanistan. The Muslem Barbarians have raised oil prices causing long lines at the pumps and the Iranians, led by the Ayatollah Khomeni and Achmednidijad, have seized the American embassy in Tehran and taken many hostages. Jimmy Carter is President. It simply cannot get any worse.Then in the American heartland, a Minnesota Hockey coach named Herb Brooks trains a team of young patriotic American boys to take on the Soviet Red Team at the 1980 Olympics games at Lake Placid. Can a group of unprofessional yet decent American kids compete against the greatest and most Evil Hockey team in the world?? And will this be enough to turn the tide of malaise, despair, appeasement, treason and defeat that will eventually lead to Ronald Reagan, the halting of the Red Advance and a miraculous victory in the Cold War???Apparently so.While one is dubious of the idea that any sporting event at anytime in world history means anything more than an excuse to paint ones face blue and drink beer, one must confess that this viewer found this is to be not only a far better film than it had any right to be but actually a solid upper tier historical film that can stand on its own without any hockey/sports fans to buoy it. The film---whose sense of history is pitch perfect completely and believably capturing the look and feel of the period(check out Russell's hair and checkered pants..not to mention his Dodge Dart)---takes the very interesting and insightful tact of positioning the game in symbolic/representative terms. This happens to be historical picture ABOUT 1980 that just happens to use a sporting event to make its point rather than a film just about a silly hockey game. This was the year where, the film seems to say, that it may not have been the beginning of the end but it was certainly the end of the beginning and it identifies the Game as that moment. Okay fine whatever.There is a minor and extraneous scene that seems to imply that it was some bathetic speech by Carter that inspired the change in course but no one who knows anything of the history of the period will believe it and the film itself is so halfhearted about the premise that it feels like some gesture on their part in the hopes of gaining all around general good will.....and positive reviews. But alas as those who would affect that Jimmy Carter could inspire anything are not the type who would watch a patriotic film where the Americans defeat the Communists at anything let alone hockey so it seems a thankless and pointless moment.Still a well directed, confident and intelligently written, nicely acted film with solid history and, one is informed, accurate hockey scenes that, in spite of the triviality of its subject, manages to attain a surprising and satisfying epic scope.Highly recommended.",4,GOAL!!!,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3148,"['MIRACLE', '2004', 'Directed', 'Gavin', 'OConnorStarring', 'Kurt', 'Russell.It', '1980', 'United', 'States', 'people', 'buffeted', 'Democratic', 'Witchunts', 'called', 'Watergate', 'subsequent', 'betrayal', 'country', 'Vietnam', 'War', '70s', 'wake', 'up', 'day', 'learn', 'new', 'defeat', 'degradation', 'Communists', 'having', 'conquered', 'Indochina', 'have', 'now', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'Muslem', 'Barbarians', 'have', 'raised', 'oil', 'prices', 'causing', 'long', 'lines', 'pumps', 'Iranians', 'led', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeni', 'Achmednidijad', 'have', 'seized', 'American', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'taken', 'many', 'hostages', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'President', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'worse.Then', 'American', 'heartland', 'Minnesota', 'Hockey', 'coach', 'named', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'team', 'young', 'patriotic', 'American', 'boys', 'take', 'Soviet', 'Red', 'Team', '1980', 'Olympics', 'games', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Can', 'group', 'unprofessional', 'decent', 'American', 'kids', 'compete', 'greatest', 'most', 'Evil', 'Hockey', 'team', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'tide', 'malaise', 'despair', 'appeasement', 'treason', 'defeat', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'halting', 'Red', 'Advance', 'miraculous', 'victory', 'Cold', 'War', 'Apparently', 'so.While', 'one', 'dubious', 'idea', 'sporting', 'event', 'anytime', 'world', 'history', 'anything', 'more', 'excuse', 'paint', 'ones', 'face', 'blue', 'drink', 'beer', 'one', 'must', 'confess', 'viewer', 'found', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'right', 'be', 'actually', 'solid', 'upper', 'tier', 'historical', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'hockey/sports', 'fans', 'buoy', 'film', '-whose', 'sense', 'history', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'completely', 'believably', 'capturing', 'look', 'feel', 'period', 'check', 'out', 'Russell', 'hair', 'checkered', 'pants..not', 'mention', 'Dodge', 'Dart', 'very', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'tact', 'positioning', 'game', 'symbolic/representative', 'terms', 'be', 'historical', 'picture', '1980', 'just', 'use', 'sporting', 'event', 'make', 'point', 'rather', 'film', 'just', 'silly', 'hockey', 'game', 'was', 'year', 'where', 'film', 'say', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'certainly', 'end', 'beginning', 'Game', 'moment', 'Okay', 'fine', 'minor', 'extraneous', 'scene', 'imply', 'was', 'bathetic', 'speech', 'Carter', 'inspired', 'change', 'course', 'one', 'who', 'anything', 'history', 'period', 'will', 'believe', 'film', 'so', 'halfhearted', 'premise', 'gesture', 'part', 'hopes', 'gaining', 'general', 'good', 'will', '..and', 'positive', 'reviews', 'alas', 'who', 'would', 'affect', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'could', 'inspire', 'anything', 'are', 'not', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'watch', 'patriotic', 'film', 'where', 'Americans', 'defeat', 'Communists', 'anything', 'let', 'alone', 'hockey', 'thankless', 'pointless', 'moment.Still', 'well', 'directed', 'confident', 'intelligently', 'written', 'nicely', 'acted', 'film', 'solid', 'history', 'one', 'informed', 'accurate', 'hockey', 'scenes', 'spite', 'triviality', 'subject', 'attain', 'surprising', 'satisfying', 'epic', 'scope.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

He even has to remind fans that this is just a game, and that, ""Killing Commie B**tards,"" isn't what Hockey is all about.Then of course, there's the stress of playing the games themselves.....26 men, all fighting for a chance to become a 20 man team. Each man had to go through hell to get their rightful place at being the best the US had to offer. Eddie Cahill stars as Jim Craig, the goalie of the team, who's mother just died and had a dream that her son would make it to the olympic team. With his father at ringside it was an emotional moment for both father and son.Other men were great as acting like the family they all said they were. Nathan West [who plays Rob McClanahan] Patrick O'Brien Demsey [who plays Mike Eruzione] Bobby Hanson [who plays Dave Silk] all give great supporting roles as the team mates who bonded after some rocky starts between some of them as the season started.One memorable scene was Brooks' way of teaching the young men some respect for the game after giving them drill after drill when the stadium had emptied and they were the only one's left in the dark. It just made the men strive to become more like the team that Brooks knew they could turn out to be.The movie is filled with thrilling hockey game shots, some hard hitting action as the opponents constantly bash into each other, and some really great saves by Craig, made the games seem as important to the viewers as they were to the players.This is a great movie and the DVD comes with some great extras;""The Making of Miracle""Adio Commentary by the Director, Gavin O'Conner, and othersOuttakesAnd a little showing of how they made hockey players into actors.I definately reccommend this DVD",5,This was their time to shine.......,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,2284,"['Miracle', 'story', 'United', 'States', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'Team', '1980', 'managed', 'overcome', 'impossible', 'odds', 'defeat', 'greatest', 'hockey', 'team', 'time', 'Russel', 'stars', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'hockey', 'coach', 'who', 'had', 'unrealistic', 'dream', 'beat', 'best', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'team', 'world', 'become', 'new', 'dream', 'team', 'coach.He', 'impossible', 'odds', 'forming', 'team', 'young', 'college', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'female', 'fans', 'first', 'game', 'making', 'sure', 'wife', 'more', 'game', 'obsessively', 'obsessed', 'about', 'even', 'remind', 'fans', 'just', 'game', 'Killing', 'Commie', 'B**tards', ""n't"", 'what', 'Hockey', 'about.Then', 'course', 'stress', 'playing', 'games', '..26', 'men', 'fighting', 'chance', 'become', '20', 'man', 'team', 'man', 'had', 'go', 'through', 'hell', 'get', 'rightful', 'place', 'being', 'best', 'US', 'had', 'offer', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'goalie', 'team', 'who', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'had', 'dream', 'son', 'would', 'make', 'olympic', 'team', 'father', 'ringside', 'was', 'emotional', 'moment', 'father', 'son.Other', 'men', 'were', 'great', 'acting', 'family', 'said', 'were', 'Nathan', 'West', '[', 'who', 'Rob', 'McClanahan', ']', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'Demsey', '[', 'who', 'Mike', 'Eruzione', ']', 'Bobby', 'Hanson', '[', 'who', 'Dave', 'Silk', ']', 'give', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'team', 'mates', 'who', 'bonded', 'rocky', 'starts', 'season', 'started.One', 'memorable', 'scene', 'was', 'Brooks', 'way', 'teaching', 'young', 'men', 'respect', 'game', 'giving', 'drill', 'drill', 'when', 'stadium', 'had', 'emptied', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'dark', 'just', 'made', 'men', 'strive', 'become', 'more', 'team', 'Brooks', 'knew', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'thrilling', 'hockey', 'game', 'shots', 'hard', 'hitting', 'action', 'opponents', 'constantly', 'bash', 'other', 'really', 'great', 'saves', 'Craig', 'made', 'games', 'seem', 'as', 'important', 'viewers', 'were', 'players.This', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'Making', 'Miracle', 'Adio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Gavin', ""O'Conner"", 'little', 'showing', 'how', 'made', 'hockey', 'players', 'actors.I', 'definately', 'reccommend', 'DVD']",N/A

""Miracle"" is no exception, but the reason for its success like the above-mentioned motion pictures is simple-great acting and some excellent sports footage.""Miracle"" stages the incredible story set in 1980 about the over-achieving United States hockey team that shocks the unblemished, dominant Soviet Union squad in the semifinal match of the Olympic tournament (this is certainly not a spoiler; it was one of the most publicized sporting events of the past quarter century).  Kurt Russell is excellent as the hard-nosed head coach Herb Brooks, who is determined to take this group of ragtag college hockey jocks to the brink of success because of his own personal misfortune at the Games twenty years before.  With his wife (Patricia Clarkston) at his side, Brooks toughens up his group of players as no other coach would dare-putting them through grinding drills, making them skate for hours, and proving to them that being a cohesive team is much more important than talent alone.The film is exceptionally directed by Gavin O'Connor, who brilliantly links the importance of the win against the Soviet Union with the awful Cold War taking place that had a terror-grip on the world.  ""Miracle"" has only one major flaw-with all the attention on Brooks, there is little characterization of the rest of the supporting cast (namely the players).  While there is emphasis on the troubled goalie (Cahill), many other deserving participants are not dually represented in the picture.  With this set aside, ""Miracle"" is a great story that has been told time and time again, but not usually with this much flair and emotion.  A suitable presentation for all ages, it is a film that not only stages some excellent hockey sequences and fine performances, but historically conveys the horrors that political hatred can bring, only to show that hard work and hope can win over all.",4,Miracle  (2004),1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,2559,"['Director', 'Gavin', ""O'ConnorCast"", 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Patricia', 'Clarkston', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Sean', 'McCann', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'Dempsey', 'Michael', 'Mantenuto.Running', 'Time', '136', 'minutes.Rated', 'PG', 'foul', 'language', 'film', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family.Although', 'possessing', 'all-too-similar', 'theme', 'conveyed', 'society', 'most', 'popular', 'sports', 'films', 'such', 'Rudy', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Hoosiers', 'Rocky', 'underdog', 'easiest', 'character', 'team', 'relate', 'only', 'way', 'root', 'defining', 'winner', 'supposed', 'inspire', 'strive', 'most', 'unreachable', 'unbelievable', 'goals', 'darn', 'could', 'do', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Miracle', 'exception', 'reason', 'success', 'above-mentioned', 'motion', 'pictures', 'simple-great', 'acting', 'excellent', 'sports', 'footage', 'Miracle', 'incredible', 'story', 'set', '1980', 'over-achieving', 'United', 'States', 'hockey', 'team', 'unblemished', 'dominant', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'squad', 'semifinal', 'match', 'Olympic', 'tournament', 'certainly', 'not', 'spoiler', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'publicized', 'sporting', 'events', 'past', 'quarter', 'century', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'excellent', 'hard-nosed', 'head', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'who', 'determined', 'take', 'group', 'ragtag', 'college', 'hockey', 'jocks', 'brink', 'success', 'own', 'personal', 'misfortune', 'Games', 'twenty', 'years', 'wife', 'Patricia', 'Clarkston', 'side', 'Brooks', 'up', 'group', 'players', 'other', 'coach', 'would', 'dare-putting', 'grinding', 'drills', 'making', 'skate', 'hours', 'proving', 'being', 'cohesive', 'team', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'talent', 'alone.The', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'directed', 'Gavin', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'brilliantly', 'importance', 'win', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'awful', 'Cold', 'War', 'taking', 'place', 'had', 'terror-grip', 'world', 'Miracle', 'only', 'one', 'major', 'flaw-with', 'attention', 'Brooks', 'little', 'characterization', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'namely', 'players', 'emphasis', 'troubled', 'goalie', 'Cahill', 'many', 'other', 'deserving', 'participants', 'are', 'not', 'dually', 'represented', 'picture', 'set', 'aside', 'Miracle', 'great', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'not', 'usually', 'much', 'flair', 'emotion', 'suitable', 'presentation', 'ages', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'hockey', 'sequences', 'fine', 'performances', 'historically', 'horrors', 'political', 'hatred', 'can', 'bring', 'only', 'show', 'hard', 'work', 'hope', 'can', 'win']",N/A

I really have to think about this one. I can certainly understand how Americans love this movie; it's our Olympic hockey team composed of amateurs who wind up defeating an invincible Soviet team that defeated our own NHL All-Star team, and had a record of something like 42-1. So why not get caught up in a movie like this, especially since it's a true story? Well, I DID get caught up in it--just like I did when I was a 9 year old glued to the TV back in 1980. This movie is an accurate reflection of what happened in those months before the Olympics, with the fiery, mind-playing coach, Herb Brooks. Played by Kurt Russell, Brooks is determined to match the Soviets and eventually beat them at their own game, using a grueling conditioning program to ready his team, and holding accountable those who don't give 110%. Throughout the film, Brooks alienates his players through intimidation, and even his assistant coach can't believe what he's seeing with Brooks's tactics. However, a slow but sure process of gaining respect from his players takes place, as the players see the big picture. As the team continues to win, Brooks instills confidence in his players, especially on the eve of playing the Soviets. Kurt Russell does a magnificent job as Brooks, and is easily the star of this movie. I was also impressed with the good acting by the players. We hold the 1980 U.S. hockey team dear to our hearts, and there's an element of sacredness to the whole thing, because we had a team of top amateurs instead of the bloated roster of professional players that we use today. This movie reminds us that sports is a great institution in our country,  but was at its best during this period. The whole movie gives the feel of the Olympics and a message that miracles can and do happen.",5,AGAIN,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,1910,"['read', 'somewhere', 'Americans', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'greatest', 'sports', 'movie', 'time', 'reading', 'paused', 'really', 'have', 'think', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'how', 'Americans', 'love', 'movie', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'team', 'composed', 'amateurs', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'defeating', 'invincible', 'Soviet', 'team', 'defeated', 'own', 'NHL', 'All-Star', 'team', 'had', 'record', 'something', '42-1', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'movie', 'especially', 'true', 'story', 'Well', 'DID', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'was', '9', 'year', 'old', 'glued', 'TV', 'back', '1980', 'movie', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'what', 'happened', 'months', 'Olympics', 'fiery', 'mind-playing', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Played', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Brooks', 'determined', 'match', 'Soviets', 'eventually', 'beat', 'own', 'game', 'using', 'grueling', 'conditioning', 'program', 'ready', 'team', 'holding', 'accountable', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', '110', '%', 'film', 'Brooks', 'players', 'intimidation', 'even', 'assistant', 'coach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'seeing', 'Brooks', 'tactics', 'However', 'slow', 'sure', 'process', 'gaining', 'respect', 'players', 'place', 'players', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'team', 'win', 'Brooks', 'confidence', 'players', 'especially', 'eve', 'playing', 'Soviets', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'magnificent', 'job', 'Brooks', 'easily', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'good', 'acting', 'players', 'hold', '1980', 'U.S.', 'hockey', 'team', 'dear', 'hearts', 'element', 'sacredness', 'whole', 'thing', 'had', 'team', 'top', 'amateurs', 'instead', 'bloated', 'roster', 'professional', 'players', 'use', 'today', 'movie', 'sports', 'great', 'institution', 'country', 'was', 'best', 'period', 'whole', 'movie', 'feel', 'Olympics', 'message', 'can', 'do', 'happen']",N/A

813141,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0001US66E,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","1979-1980 was a critical time in U.S. history. In fact, the post-9/11 world in which we now live in many ways resembles the beginning of that fateful decade.  The Middle East was in turmoil and terrorists had hijacked a plane with a bunch of American citizens and was holding them hostage. People were afraid of traveling overseas because of the threat and gas shortages and prices caused people to begin carpooling, walking, and biking to work. The Cold War had been going on for almost 35 years without WW III breaking loose, but for the first time since the Cuban Missle Crisis, the Cold War was heating up in a major way and everyone was fearful of world annihilation through a nuclear war. There was talk that the Soviet Union was thinking of boycotting the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid as a sign of contempt (something President Carter actually forced the U.S. to do during 1980 Summer Games in Moscow) and the nation was on edge.But in February of 1980, the nation witnessed something that revived everyone's spirits and united people in a way they hadn't been since the middle of Vietnam.  During the Semi-final game of the Olympic hockey game, the amatuer U.S. team beat the mighty Soviet powerhouse in a sport they had dominated for more than 20 years.  The chanting of ""U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A"" was first heard during those games and the little team that could went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finnland.MIRACLE is a movie that recreates those events.  The tone, mood, and setting is captured almost perfectly and places the audience right in the midst of what it was like living in America in 1979-1980. Great pains have been taken not only to just physically recreate the events that the members of the U.S. hockey team went through, but the emotions and mentality, too.The ""actors"" playing the hockey players in the movie really aren't ""actors"" but are instead first and foremost real hockey players.  This is just one example of many that illustrates the extent the filmmakers went through to get things right.However, though the movie is thought as being about the 1980 U.S. hockey team, it's really a very personal movie that really isn't about the team, but about the man who led them there, Herb Brooks.  Brooks had played on the 1960 team that lost to the Soviets for the first time and since that time had made it his life's ambition to beat the Russians at their own game. The majority of the country had no idea at the time of Brooks' unusual and somewhat controversial training methods and even if they had I don't think most people would have given it much thought.  It was Brooks' determination and leadership that formed the team and gave them the opportunity to perform a little ""miracle"" for all the world to see.A couple a bits of trivia about the film.  The scene in MIRACLE where the players are forced by Brooks to skate back and forth doing drills after their 3-3 tie with Norway was filmed over the course of 3 days, 12 hours a day because the filmmakers wanted the ""actors"" to look as exhausted as possible. Also, the shot of New York that is seen in the movie with the World Trade Center in the background is actual footage shot for the movie, post 9-11. The Two Towers are seen in the picture were actually digitally recreated, making MIRACLE the first movie to ""create"" the towers since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.MIRACLE is a movie sure to stir up some sort of emotion from those who were alive to watch the famous moment of sport live. For those who have only read about the event in history books or watched it on ESPN or on a DVD, the effect isn't quite the same and the movie will probably not have as much significance. Nevertheless, the film is well made and makes for a great sports picture.",5,"""Do You Believe in Miracles?""",1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,3767,"['1979-1980', 'was', 'critical', 'time', 'U.S.', 'history', 'fact', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'now', 'live', 'many', 'ways', 'resembles', 'beginning', 'fateful', 'decade', 'Middle', 'East', 'was', 'turmoil', 'terrorists', 'had', 'hijacked', 'plane', 'bunch', 'American', 'citizens', 'was', 'holding', 'hostage', 'People', 'were', 'afraid', 'traveling', 'overseas', 'threat', 'gas', 'shortages', 'prices', 'caused', 'people', 'begin', 'carpooling', 'walking', 'biking', 'work', 'Cold', 'War', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'almost', '35', 'years', 'WW', 'III', 'breaking', 'loose', 'first', 'time', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'heating', 'up', 'major', 'way', 'everyone', 'was', 'fearful', 'world', 'annihilation', 'nuclear', 'war', 'was', 'talk', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'thinking', 'boycotting', 'Winter', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'sign', 'contempt', 'something', 'President', 'Carter', 'actually', 'forced', 'U.S.', 'do', '1980', 'Summer', 'Games', 'Moscow', 'nation', 'was', 'edge.But', 'February', '1980', 'nation', 'witnessed', 'something', 'revived', 'everyone', 'spirits', 'united', 'people', 'way', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'middle', 'Vietnam', 'Semi-final', 'game', 'Olympic', 'hockey', 'game', 'amatuer', 'U.S.', 'team', 'beat', 'mighty', 'Soviet', 'powerhouse', 'sport', 'had', 'dominated', 'more', '20', 'years', 'chanting', 'U-S-A', 'U-S-A', 'U-S-A', 'was', 'first', 'heard', 'games', 'little', 'team', 'could', 'went', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'defeating', 'Finnland.MIRACLE', 'movie', 'events', 'tone', 'mood', 'setting', 'captured', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'audience', 'right', 'midst', 'what', 'was', 'living', 'America', '1979-1980', 'Great', 'pains', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'physically', 'recreate', 'events', 'members', 'U.S.', 'hockey', 'team', 'went', 'emotions', 'mentality', 'too.The', 'actors', 'playing', 'hockey', 'players', 'movie', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'actors', 'are', 'instead', 'first', 'foremost', 'real', 'hockey', 'players', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'many', 'extent', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'get', 'things', 'right.However', 'movie', 'thought', 'being', '1980', 'U.S.', 'hockey', 'team', 'really', 'very', 'personal', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'team', 'man', 'who', 'led', 'there', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'Brooks', 'had', 'played', '1960', 'team', 'lost', 'Soviets', 'first', 'time', 'time', 'had', 'made', 'life', 'ambition', 'beat', 'Russians', 'own', 'game', 'majority', 'country', 'had', 'idea', 'time', 'Brooks', 'unusual', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'training', 'methods', 'even', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'Brooks', 'determination', 'leadership', 'formed', 'team', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'perform', 'little', 'miracle', 'world', 'see.A', 'couple', 'bits', 'trivia', 'film', 'scene', 'MIRACLE', 'where', 'players', 'are', 'forced', 'Brooks', 'skate', 'back', 'forth', 'doing', 'drills', '3-3', 'tie', 'Norway', 'was', 'filmed', 'course', '3', 'days', '12', 'hours', 'day', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'actors', 'look', 'as', 'exhausted', 'possible', 'Also', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'seen', 'movie', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'background', 'actual', 'footage', 'shot', 'movie', 'post', '9-11', 'Two', 'Towers', 'are', 'seen', 'picture', 'were', 'actually', 'digitally', 'recreated', 'making', 'MIRACLE', 'first', 'movie', 'create', 'towers', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'September', '11', '2001.MIRACLE', 'movie', 'sure', 'stir', 'up', 'sort', 'emotion', 'who', 'were', 'alive', 'watch', 'famous', 'moment', 'sport', 'live', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'read', 'event', 'history', 'books', 'watched', 'ESPN', 'DVD', 'effect', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'significance', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'sports', 'picture']",N/A
