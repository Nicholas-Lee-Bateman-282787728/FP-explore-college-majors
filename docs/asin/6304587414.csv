Here, the beautiful Madhabi Mukherjee appeared in Charaluta and Karapush.  Although made in 1963, the time period is to reflect 1955.  The setting is a tiny, cramped, dingy looking dwelling.  Arati lives with her husband, Subrata, two kids, and her husband's elderly parents.  Upon opening, we see that Subrata's father is in need of glasses and asks his son again when he can get them.  The elderly father was an educator and begins to rely on his past students for benefits.When money is tight, Arati presents the question to her husband about getting a job.  He  has strict values about women in the workplace,  while the young son tells his sister that if she doesn't study she could be in the kitchen  ""just like mom"".  You also learn the values of the husband, who reiterates that a woman's place is in the home.  But without argument, the husband is compliant, and helps her find a job, until he is threatened by her achievement and contribution.What is inspirational about this movie is that here we have a woman who is a devoted homemaker, has NOT worked outside the home, performs well as a sales girl (door to door), boldly challenges her boss regarding treatment of a colleague; asks for a raise and gets it.On the other hand, a man who has shallow values, ego bruised, long-time head of a household and isn't able to dutifully support his family evolves as the weaker of the two.Excellent movie that may not be on DVD at this time.  ....Rizzo",5,A woman's place is in the home ....  and the workforce,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,1557,"['have', 'seen', 'several', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'films', 'will', 'recognize', 'repeated', 'use', 'actors', 'Here', 'beautiful', 'Madhabi', 'Mukherjee', 'appeared', 'Charaluta', 'Karapush', 'made', '1963', 'time', 'period', 'reflect', '1955', 'setting', 'tiny', 'cramped', 'dingy', 'looking', 'dwelling', 'Arati', 'husband', 'Subrata', 'two', 'kids', 'husband', 'elderly', 'parents', 'opening', 'see', 'Subrata', 'father', 'need', 'glasses', 'son', 'again', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'elderly', 'father', 'was', 'educator', 'rely', 'past', 'students', 'benefits.When', 'money', 'tight', 'Arati', 'question', 'husband', 'getting', 'job', 'strict', 'values', 'women', 'workplace', 'young', 'son', 'sister', ""n't"", 'study', 'could', 'be', 'kitchen', 'just', 'mom', 'also', 'learn', 'values', 'husband', 'who', 'woman', 'place', 'home', 'argument', 'husband', 'compliant', 'find', 'job', 'threatened', 'achievement', 'contribution.What', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'here', 'have', 'woman', 'who', 'devoted', 'homemaker', 'NOT', 'worked', 'home', 'performs', 'well', 'sales', 'girl', 'door', 'door', 'boldly', 'boss', 'regarding', 'treatment', 'colleague', 'raise', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'man', 'who', 'shallow', 'values', 'ego', 'bruised', 'long-time', 'head', 'household', ""n't"", 'able', 'dutifully', 'support', 'family', 'weaker', 'two.Excellent', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'DVD', 'time', '.Rizzo']",Mahanagar The Big City  VHS

MAHANAGAR (""THE BIG CITY"") is set in Kolkata/Calcutta in the 1950s, just a few years before the film was released in 1963. The Mazumdar family, consisting of Subrata and his wife Arati, their child Pintu, and Subrata's parents and teenage sister, can barely afford to keep themselves afloat; out of pure necessity, the shy Arati takes a job as a saleswoman for a company that manufactures labor-saving devices for housewives. Her husband's parents are shocked she would break with tradition in such a way, even out of necessity, and Pintu tries to reject her; nevertheless, she is a success at her job and is quickly promoted. Humiliated by her success, her husband tries to get her to quit, but after there's a run on the bank where he works as a clerk she must stay in her post as the family's sole breadwinner.No one is better at portraying complex emotions wordlessly than Ray is; there are great scenes with his camera simply slowly closing in on his main character's faces that tell you so much about their inner lives it can feel almost overwhelming. He has two great actors in his central two roles of the Mazumdars: the stunningly beautiful Madhabi Mukherjee, and Anil Chatterjee. The scene where Mukherjee, as Arati, receives her first salary payment and reacts with quiet triumph is a classic, as is the much more complicated scene where her jobless husband overhears her in a cafe lying to a client about her husband's employment status (to his great humiliation). Rare for one of Ray' early films, the film ends hopefully, with the Mazumdars' marriage unbroken by modernity, which has not destroyed their love for one another and which has surprisingly given them a sense of new possibilities.",5,The world and the home,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,1882,"['problems', 'families', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'intensely', 'absorbingly', 'portrayed', 'seeing', 'one', 'films', 'own', 'life', 'can', 'seem', 'paltry', 'comparison', 'MAHANAGAR', 'BIG', 'CITY', 'set', 'Kolkata/Calcutta', '1950s', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1963', 'Mazumdar', 'family', 'consisting', 'Subrata', 'wife', 'Arati', 'child', 'Pintu', 'Subrata', 'parents', 'teenage', 'sister', 'can', 'barely', 'afford', 'keep', 'afloat', 'pure', 'necessity', 'shy', 'Arati', 'job', 'saleswoman', 'company', 'labor-saving', 'devices', 'housewives', 'husband', 'parents', 'are', 'shocked', 'would', 'break', 'tradition', 'such', 'way', 'even', 'necessity', 'Pintu', 'tries', 'reject', 'nevertheless', 'success', 'job', 'quickly', 'promoted', 'Humiliated', 'success', 'husband', 'tries', 'get', 'quit', 'run', 'bank', 'where', 'clerk', 'must', 'stay', 'post', 'family', 'sole', 'breadwinner.No', 'one', 'better', 'portraying', 'complex', 'emotions', 'wordlessly', 'Ray', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'camera', 'simply', 'slowly', 'closing', 'main', 'character', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'inner', 'can', 'feel', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'central', 'two', 'roles', 'Mazumdars', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Madhabi', 'Mukherjee', 'Anil', 'Chatterjee', 'scene', 'where', 'Mukherjee', 'Arati', 'first', 'salary', 'payment', 'reacts', 'quiet', 'triumph', 'classic', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'scene', 'where', 'jobless', 'husband', 'cafe', 'lying', 'client', 'husband', 'employment', 'status', 'great', 'humiliation', 'Rare', 'one', 'Ray', 'early', 'films', 'film', 'hopefully', 'Mazumdars', 'marriage', 'unbroken', 'modernity', 'not', 'destroyed', 'love', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'sense', 'new', 'possibilities']",Mahanagar The Big City  VHS

The wife of the main character decides to go to work to help support the family, and ultimately discovers new things about herself. She likes her new job and independence and having work gives her a different outlook about her own life and marriage, as well as the world. This is basically an upbeat movie, with a modern feel to it. As always, Ray's direction is impeccable and the cinematography is great.

429124,A2FVLYFKJSV1WJ,6304587414,"Paul Peabody ""peapod""","[4, 6]","I was In India on my 5th trip in 3 years recently when this was shown to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its release. For me I was at the end of a long journey when I happened to catch this on a great screen in my hotel. I think in many ways it is the most astonishing film I have ever seen. Precisely because of what one previous reviewer says is Rays' inimitable gifts at catching the emotions of people close up without have to use any words. I found it particularly intense as my tours have all been musical in nature and the entire way that I go about interacting with people has been without words. A feat that has been surprisingly easy to access.However, to see Ray capture the heart and humanity of so many of the Indian people I have been fortunate to interact with was too much emotionally for me. I couldn't make it to the end, as the scene in the coffee shop was so intense (imagining the pain of the husband hearing his wife's description of his job) I just couldn't bare the emotional intensity anymore.His own music composed for the film ,beautiful and sparingly applied ,reminds me of the sensitive and subtle ways that so much of the food in India is so delicately spiced and is perfect in a way that no soundtrack I have participated in equals. Having created or played in the soundtracks of over 90 major motion pictures I don't think I have ever sensed such a perfect wedding of cinematic views with music .A revelation, as my love for film has always been huge, it actually made me plan to visit the school that is dedicated to his films and teaching, to perform and also to learn more on how to craft films myself as I now am lucky enough to have a pro level dslr and requisite equipment.As much as certain films can be the lynchpin for those wanting to delve deeper into this field, the humanistic and deep sensitivity of Rays vision in this film will I hope be as moving for you as it was for me. (and I intend to purchase so that I can watch the rest of it!).Also , as I am in love with the colors of India (among many other aspects),though at times (frequently) this can also be overwhelming,,by creating this in b/w with the grainy aspect of film of the period ,it actually makes it in a different way ,,even more deep and colorful !",5,overwhelming,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,2267,"['was', 'India', '5th', 'trip', '3', 'years', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'celebrate', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'release', 'was', 'end', 'long', 'journey', 'when', 'happened', 'catch', 'great', 'screen', 'hotel', 'think', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'astonishing', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Precisely', 'what', 'one', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Rays', 'inimitable', 'gifts', 'catching', 'emotions', 'people', 'close', 'up', 'have', 'use', 'words', 'found', 'particularly', 'intense', 'tours', 'have', 'been', 'musical', 'nature', 'entire', 'way', 'go', 'interacting', 'people', 'been', 'words', 'feat', 'been', 'surprisingly', 'easy', 'access.However', 'see', 'Ray', 'capture', 'heart', 'humanity', 'so', 'many', 'Indian', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'interact', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'emotionally', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'end', 'scene', 'coffee', 'shop', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'imagining', 'pain', 'husband', 'hearing', 'wife', 'description', 'job', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bare', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'anymore.His', 'own', 'music', 'composed', 'film', 'beautiful', 'sparingly', 'applied', 'sensitive', 'subtle', 'ways', 'so', 'much', 'food', 'India', 'so', 'delicately', 'spiced', 'perfect', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'participated', 'equals', 'Having', 'created', 'played', 'soundtracks', '90', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'sensed', 'perfect', 'wedding', 'cinematic', 'views', 'music', '.A', 'revelation', 'love', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'actually', 'made', 'plan', 'visit', 'school', 'dedicated', 'films', 'teaching', 'perform', 'also', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'craft', 'films', 'now', 'am', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'pro', 'level', 'dslr', 'requisite', 'equipment.As', 'much', 'certain', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'lynchpin', 'wanting', 'delve', 'deeper', 'field', 'humanistic', 'deep', 'sensitivity', 'Rays', 'vision', 'film', 'will', 'hope', 'be', 'moving', 'was', 'intend', 'purchase', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'rest', '.Also', 'am', 'love', 'colors', 'India', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'though', 'times', 'frequently', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'overwhelming', ',by', 'creating', 'b/w', 'grainy', 'aspect', 'film', 'period', 'actually', 'different', 'way', ',even', 'more', 'deep', 'colorful']",Mahanagar The Big City  VHS
