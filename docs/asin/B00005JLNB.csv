I was actually disappointed to hear how bad it was because I grew up loving the original Italian Collodi story of the live wooden puppet. Having seen the SUBTITLED version of the DVD, I must say the film is not nearly as horrific as some critics would have people believe. While I agree that it is very hard to buy Roberto Benigni in the title role as a young boy/puppet, much of the film is presented as 'theater' and thus asks the audience to suspend belief. The characters of the Fox and Cat, and many others rely not on actual animal makeup but features which create an illusion of their characteristics. In this sense, the film is quite ingenius and imaginative. The sets and costumes are beautiful and the script and story line are very faithful to the original book. That said, this film is a hard one to market to any audience because it is an adult (or 'art')version of a children's story, produced in another language. Sadly, in spite of its strengths, the film was doomed to fail in America because most children know only the animated Disney version of the story, and most parents do not wish to see a 50-year old playing the lead in a children's fairy tale. A shame, because while far from perfect, the film is not the disaster that many have proclaimed it to be.",3,"Missed its potential, but not as bad as critics say...",1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,1358,"['movie', 'notoriety', 'quot', 'worst', 'film', '2002', 'quot', 'peaked', 'curiosity', 'was', 'actually', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'original', 'Italian', 'Collodi', 'story', 'live', 'wooden', 'puppet', 'Having', 'seen', 'SUBTITLED', 'version', 'DVD', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'horrific', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'people', 'believe', 'agree', 'very', 'hard', 'buy', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'title', 'role', 'young', 'boy/puppet', 'much', 'film', 'presented', ""'theater"", 'thus', 'audience', 'suspend', 'belief', 'characters', 'Fox', 'Cat', 'many', 'others', 'rely', 'not', 'actual', 'animal', 'makeup', 'features', 'create', 'illusion', 'characteristics', 'sense', 'film', 'quite', 'ingenius', 'imaginative', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'script', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'said', 'film', 'hard', 'one', 'market', 'audience', 'adult', ""'art"", 'version', 'children', 'story', 'produced', 'language', 'Sadly', 'spite', 'strengths', 'film', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'America', 'most', 'children', 'know', 'only', 'animated', 'Disney', 'version', 'story', 'most', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'see', '50-year', 'old', 'playing', 'lead', 'children', 'fairy', 'tale', 'shame', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'not', 'disaster', 'many', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'be']",Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio
602425,A2TQ0SRDL86VPH,B00005JLNB,Charles Richards,"[8, 9]","I had my worries before I saw this film, as I do before I see any adaptation of a favorite piece of literature, but I can happily say that I was not the least bit disappointed in this beautiful film. Visually stunning from get-go, the film never seems to let up on its attraction to the eye. But even more to its credit, the film is extraordinary in its fidelity to the spirit of the Collodi original, which made it such a treat. I was afraid that most American moviegoers and critics, used to the Disney version, might find the differances in the story-line and characters unsettling enough to leave a bad taste in their mouths, and, while this was not entirely the case, its poor critical reception seems to be partially due to this. Not that I'm not knocking the Disney film, it is a masterpiece in its own right with some of the most magnificent animation ever produced for the silver screen, but its highly Americanized and slightly emasculated interpretation of the original book has always left me preferring the original.But some warning, this is not a movie for children. Most children who have seen the Disney film and then gone on to read the book have been disappointed, due to the episodic and didactic nature of Collodi's tale, and I think most (American) children will probably not enjoy this new version for those reasons. Also, the casting is less-than-ideal, and I think this is another reason for its strong critical failure in this country (and the reason I've given it four stars rather than five). Benigni is obviously too old for the part (although I'd rather see him than some annoying, precocious child actor)and his wife is unsuitable for the Fairy with the Blue Hair (far too glamerous, I think). Also the English sountrack is incredably annoying, I am greatly looking forward to viewing the film in its original Italian. But on the whole, to those who fancy fairy tales, and especially those who are familiar with the original story, it is highly recommended.",4,A visually stunning and faithful adaptation,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,1987,"['had', 'worries', 'saw', 'film', 'do', 'see', 'adaptation', 'favorite', 'piece', 'literature', 'can', 'happily', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'get-go', 'film', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'attraction', 'eye', 'even', 'more', 'credit', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'fidelity', 'spirit', 'Collodi', 'original', 'made', 'treat', 'was', 'afraid', 'most', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'critics', 'used', 'Disney', 'version', 'might', 'find', 'differances', 'story-line', 'characters', 'unsettling', 'enough', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'case', 'poor', 'critical', 'reception', 'be', 'partially', 'due', 'Not', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'Disney', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'right', 'most', 'magnificent', 'animation', 'ever', 'produced', 'silver', 'screen', 'highly', 'Americanized', 'slightly', 'emasculated', 'interpretation', 'original', 'book', 'always', 'left', 'preferring', 'original.But', 'warning', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'Most', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Disney', 'film', 'then', 'gone', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'due', 'episodic', 'didactic', 'nature', 'Collodi', 'tale', 'think', 'most', 'American', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'new', 'version', 'reasons', 'Also', 'casting', 'less-than-ideal', 'think', 'reason', 'strong', 'critical', 'failure', 'country', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'given', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'Benigni', 'obviously', 'too', 'old', 'part', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'annoying', 'precocious', 'child', 'actor', 'wife', 'unsuitable', 'Fairy', 'Blue', 'Hair', 'far', 'too', 'glamerous', 'think', 'Also', 'English', 'sountrack', 'incredably', 'annoying', 'am', 'greatly', 'looking', 'forward', 'viewing', 'film', 'original', 'Italian', 'whole', 'who', 'fancy', 'fairy', 'tales', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'original', 'story', 'highly', 'recommended']",Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio
602426,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00005JLNB,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[11, 19]","This summer a great film was released in America. That film is called Pinocchio. I didn't expect this movie to be any good after the negative press and critcally shutdown. I saw it because I wanted to try out a foriegn movie, and I heard there were alot of celebrity dubbed voices. Eric Idle,Glenn Close,Breckin Myer,Kevin James,Regis Philbin,and Jim Bulisi. It was fun trying to figure out which characters has those voices.This movie was made in Italy by Roberto Bennigni who was the star in Life is Beautiful. He also wrote,directed,and starred in this epic film event. The movie is nothing like the oringal Disney version which I thought is great. It gives the film it's own spotlight. The movie is a remake but if has it's own style of pacing and special effects.Bennigni has so much energy and power in bringing a beloved character to the silver screen. His acting is wonderful as is the prose of the words. My only complaint is that they should have had a seprate version with English subtitles. They couldn't do that with one version because it's a kids movie. How many kids know Italian? Two would have been good. One for kids and one for the people who want subtitles.Everyone probally knows what the plot of this movie is about but I'll explain. One night the Blue Fairy and a king are riding in a carriage. Without knowing it the Blue Fairy's power's turn a block of wood alive. The block travels all over the town and ends up in front of a house. The house belongs to Gepettio. He makes a wooden puppet but the puppet comes alive. In a white outfit and a hat made of bread Pinocchio goes to school but unfortuatly trouble ensures. After losing all of his money from a cat and a fox Pinchocio tries to make everything right. But Pinchocio has a nack for causing trouble...which is just what happens.With beautiful senerny and Oscar winning acting this version of Pinocchio is great for people of all ages. It's a big shame that this movie didn't make alot of money in the box office. Hopefully it will do good on video.ENJOY!",4,A Masterpiece!,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2037,"['summer', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'America', 'film', 'called', 'Pinocchio', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'negative', 'press', 'critcally', 'shutdown', 'saw', 'wanted', 'try', 'out', 'foriegn', 'movie', 'heard', 'were', 'alot', 'celebrity', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Breckin', 'Myer', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Regis', 'Philbin', 'Jim', 'Bulisi', 'was', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'characters', 'voices.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Italy', 'Roberto', 'Bennigni', 'who', 'was', 'star', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'epic', 'film', 'event', 'movie', 'nothing', 'oringal', 'Disney', 'version', 'thought', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'spotlight', 'movie', 'remake', 'own', 'style', 'pacing', 'special', 'effects.Bennigni', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'power', 'bringing', 'beloved', 'character', 'silver', 'screen', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'prose', 'words', 'only', 'complaint', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'seprate', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'version', 'kids', 'movie', 'How', 'many', 'kids', 'know', 'Italian', 'Two', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'One', 'kids', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'subtitles.Everyone', 'probally', 'what', 'plot', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'One', 'night', 'Blue', 'Fairy', 'king', 'are', 'riding', 'carriage', 'knowing', 'Blue', 'Fairy', 'power', 'turn', 'block', 'wood', 'alive', 'block', 'town', 'up', 'front', 'house', 'house', 'Gepettio', 'wooden', 'puppet', 'puppet', 'alive', 'white', 'outfit', 'hat', 'made', 'bread', 'Pinocchio', 'school', 'unfortuatly', 'trouble', 'ensures', 'losing', 'money', 'cat', 'fox', 'Pinchocio', 'tries', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'Pinchocio', 'nack', 'causing', 'trouble', 'just', 'what', 'happens.With', 'beautiful', 'senerny', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'acting', 'version', 'Pinocchio', 'great', 'people', 'ages', 'big', 'shame', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'alot', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'video.ENJOY']",Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio

Needless to say I went to see it for myself.  OH MY GOD!!  This made &#34;Plan 9 from Outerspace&#34; look like &#34;Casablanca&#34; by comparisons.  I knew I was trouble when kids behind me saw the hanging scene of this movie and said &#34;I don't want this anymore!&#34;Ok first off the movie was originally made in Italy which is also the novel's country of origin too.  Roberto Benigin played Pinocchio. He was obviously too old for the part.  This character whined, griped, and shouted at top volume.  Ghepeto wore a bad toupee wich looked like a &#34;fried egg&#34;(I did not see a resemblence of an egg but anyhow).  These two so poor they didn't have a pot to piss in.  Yet Ghepeto makes a &#34;hat out of bread&#34; for Pinoc to wear.  There was the blue fairy(played by Benigni's wife)&#62; Her hair was  purple and teeth yellow(she looked more like Shampoo from &#34;Ranma 1/2).  There was an annoying cricket(a bald guy with antenae), a fox and cat that duped pinoc out of this money(they look like casting rejects from &#34;The Island of Doctor Manroe&#34; 1990s edition), a dog man coach driver named Miderueax who is needs glasses and a best friend named &#34;Leonardo&#34;  who looked more Irish than Italian.  Since this is a  foregin film, it was dubbed in English with talents of Cheech Marin, Regis Philman, Queen Latifah,  and John Cleese.  What a group.This movie was slow paced, had little coherent plot, a very repeatitive soundtrack and  at times just plain unrealistic.  If you want a cheesey foregin film this is perfect.

Now, this is not the fault of the critics, but the fault of Miramax, who made one of the most bone headed decisions ever in their lifetime when they decided to dub this film into English.  The dubbing is absolute zero.  I didn't even bother with that version.  The Italian with English subtitle version is the one to see, and it's a magnficent film.  Benigni shows that he's a great comic actor as well as a great filmmaker.  The look of this film is sumptuous.  It almost can be seen as a blending of Fellini and Visconti, at least in its production design and cinematography.  In fact, Danilo Donati did the production design for this, and he worked exclusively with Fellini and Pasolini.  In fact, this was originally conceived as a colloboration between Fellini and Benigni, but Fellini passed away, and Roberto took it over.  Despite Miramax's boneheaded decision to dub the film, at least they released the uncut, undubbed version on DVD.  Check this one out.

Holland,"[11, 15]","Without regurgitating what seemingly every reviewer of this film felt HAD to be said, I will say that this is certainly the most interesting of ALL Pincchio movies/adaptations in history!For one, and this MUST be said again, to watch a 50 year old man play the part of a little wooden puppet is a exercise in sheer open-mindedness and tolerance!In fact, watching the entitre film (ORIGINAL VERSION ONLY PLEASE) one get's the impression that Benigni favors adults over children, even in a childrens' story, as ALL characters are played by grossly overaged/sized adult actors.The movies is funny though...in a strange way.The biggest drawback aside from his age, is Benigni's un-naturally high pitched voice and penchant for rambling dialogue.As a student of the Italian language, it can be hard to follow his incessant jumble of non-sensical jibberish.At the same token, it is Benigni's annoying acting style that makes this film fun to watch.What makes this film even quirkier is the relationship between a very grown Pinocchio and a rather attractive Blue Haired Fairy. There were times when I thought Pinocchio would just grab his beloved fairy and use his long nose to work his own brand of magic on HER. Sounds bad I know, but if you've seen this film you'll have no choice but to agree that there is waaayyy more physical chemistry between Pinocchio and the Fairy than ANY childrens story ought to have.I can see why the critics AND the vast majority of viewers hated this one.

602432,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005JLNB,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[14, 21]","Roberto Benigni received extremely harsh critical attack for his recent rendition of Collidi's classic fairy tale of a puppet who wished to become a wooden boy.  Part of this is because Miramax decided to cut the film from 110 minutes to 99(!) -- often a bad mistake, as it can damage the effect of a film.  But they added another slapping blow by overdubbing the character voices.  In a foreign animated film, this works more successfully because an animation cel stands on its own.  Unfortunately, it's not so in the case of live action.  The line-readings of the voice actors clash horrendously with the moving mouth of the foreign language, and, here, in PINOCCHIO, it's just really awful.  I only listened to bits and pieces of the dub, and although the voice cast is certainly talented and does a respectable job (except for Breckin Meyer as Pinocchio himself), their words are so poorly synchronized with the moving mouth that the results come across as disastrous.Although the film holds well together in its native tongue and uncut version, one cannot help but wonder just what went wrong with this production.  PINOCCHIO is definitely an ambitious picture; the costumes, set designs and cinematography are all strikingly beautiful.  There are also lots of staggering special effects shots, from a carriage drawn by mice to an enormous shark in the sea.  Such effects made the movie the most expensive in Italy --$45 million in total--; and Benigni should consider himself fortunate that it broke even in box office receipts.  In America, however, it didn't have the same reception.  Either because of the cutting and disastrous dubbing (despite the presence of big names in the cast such as John Cleese, Eric Idle, Cheech Marin, and Glen Close), or the fact that people could not accept this version, the movie was a dismal failure.Part of the problem is the decision of having Benigni himself playing Pinocchio.  I mean, come on!  Benigni is WAY too old for Pinocchio, and a lot of the other &quot;kids&quot; in this picture are played by grown-ups!  Somehow it didn't come off on me as glaring that such was the case, but I can just imagine why critics and film buffs would slamdunk this film for that cause.  There are plenty of interesting concepts and ideas for the film; the Blue Fairy's costumes are gorgeous, and the image of a butterfly present in the film is very nice, but that's not enough to save this poor, troubled picture.  There's hardly a sympathetic character in the movie; Pinocchio is supposed to be disobedient, yes, but here he's portrayed as a crazy maniac, refusing to behave or do anything good until he is goaded into it.  The Talking Cricket is not much better.  If you were spoiled by Jiminy Cricket from the (far superior) Disney version, prepare to be shocked - he not only looks a man with artificial antennas placed on his head, he also acts condescendingly.  Instead of being encouraging, he comes across as a sarcastic, unhelping little jerk who just badmouths the &quot;boy&quot; instead of coaching him.  Granted, I'm aware that this is true of the original Collidi tale (Disney &quot;softened up&quot; Pinocchio's personality for his film), yet here it's executed so awkwardly that it becomes difficult to become involved in this film.  It also is not a very clear, focused picture:  it's too dark and menacing for youngsters and too insane to appeal to older audiences.A modern misfire, this version of PINOCCHIO is more likely to be remembered for its cinematography rather than its misguided story and below-average dubbing.  (Even on the Italian original, there is some gratingly bad acting.)Surprisingly, even though Miramax butchered this film in its theatrical release, they certainly produced a great package with this DVD.  It's a two-disc set, complete with a very gorgeous transfer, and two different versions of the movie.  One disc is the horribly recut U.S. release while the other is the uncut Italian version.  Strangely, even an English language track is offered on the second disc as well, and it includes all the stuff that was cut from the U.S. premiere!  Very interesting indeed, even if the dubbing still can't hold a candle to some of the better ones I've heard (mainly from animation films, because they don't have the same lip-sync problem that live-action ones do).  Sadly, though, even the presence of the uncut version doesn't change the fact that this movie is a disappointing experience.  It's gorgeous to look at, but it's certainly not a classic by any means.",2,"Interesting ideas, but falls flat on all levels.",1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,4539,"['Roberto', 'Benigni', 'received', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'critical', 'attack', 'recent', 'rendition', 'Collidi', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'puppet', 'who', 'wished', 'become', 'wooden', 'boy', 'Part', 'Miramax', 'decided', 'cut', 'film', '110', 'minutes', '99', 'often', 'bad', 'mistake', 'can', 'damage', 'effect', 'film', 'added', 'slapping', 'blow', 'overdubbing', 'character', 'voices', 'foreign', 'animated', 'film', 'more', 'successfully', 'animation', 'cel', 'own', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'so', 'case', 'live', 'action', 'line-readings', 'voice', 'actors', 'clash', 'horrendously', 'moving', 'mouth', 'foreign', 'language', 'here', 'PINOCCHIO', 'just', 'really', 'awful', 'only', 'listened', 'bits', 'pieces', 'dub', 'voice', 'cast', 'certainly', 'talented', 'respectable', 'job', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Pinocchio', 'words', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'synchronized', 'moving', 'mouth', 'results', 'come', 'film', 'well', 'together', 'native', 'tongue', 'uncut', 'version', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'production', 'PINOCCHIO', 'definitely', 'ambitious', 'picture', 'costumes', 'set', 'designs', 'cinematography', 'are', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'are', 'also', 'lots', 'staggering', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'carriage', 'drawn', 'mice', 'enormous', 'shark', 'sea', 'Such', 'effects', 'made', 'movie', 'most', 'expensive', 'Italy', '45', 'million', 'total', 'Benigni', 'should', 'consider', 'fortunate', 'broke', 'even', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'America', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'reception', 'cutting', 'disastrous', 'dubbing', 'presence', 'big', 'names', 'cast', 'such', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Glen', 'Close', 'fact', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'version', 'movie', 'was', 'dismal', 'failure.Part', 'problem', 'decision', 'having', 'Benigni', 'playing', 'Pinocchio', 'mean', 'come', 'Benigni', 'WAY', 'too', 'old', 'Pinocchio', 'lot', 'other', 'quot', 'kids', 'quot', 'picture', 'are', 'played', 'grown-ups', 'Somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'glaring', 'such', 'was', 'case', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'why', 'critics', 'film', 'buffs', 'would', 'slamdunk', 'film', 'cause', 'are', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'ideas', 'film', 'Blue', 'Fairy', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'image', 'butterfly', 'present', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'poor', 'troubled', 'picture', 'hardly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'movie', 'Pinocchio', 'supposed', 'be', 'disobedient', 'yes', 'here', 'portrayed', 'crazy', 'maniac', 'refusing', 'behave', 'do', 'anything', 'good', 'goaded', 'Talking', 'Cricket', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'were', 'spoiled', 'Jiminy', 'Cricket', 'far', 'superior', 'Disney', 'version', 'prepare', 'be', 'shocked', 'not', 'only', 'man', 'artificial', 'antennas', 'placed', 'head', 'also', 'condescendingly', 'Instead', 'being', 'encouraging', 'across', 'sarcastic', 'unhelping', 'little', 'jerk', 'who', 'just', 'badmouths', 'quot', 'quot', 'instead', 'coaching', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'aware', 'true', 'original', 'Collidi', 'tale', 'Disney', 'quot', 'softened', 'up', 'quot', 'Pinocchio', 'personality', 'film', 'yet', 'here', 'executed', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'difficult', 'become', 'involved', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'focused', 'picture', 'too', 'dark', 'menacing', 'youngsters', 'too', 'insane', 'appeal', 'older', 'audiences.A', 'modern', 'misfire', 'version', 'PINOCCHIO', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'cinematography', 'rather', 'misguided', 'story', 'below-average', 'dubbing', 'Even', 'Italian', 'original', 'gratingly', 'bad', 'acting', 'Surprisingly', 'even', 'Miramax', 'butchered', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'certainly', 'produced', 'great', 'package', 'DVD', 'two-disc', 'set', 'complete', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'transfer', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'movie', 'One', 'disc', 'horribly', 'recut', 'U.S.', 'release', 'other', 'uncut', 'Italian', 'version', 'Strangely', 'even', 'English', 'language', 'track', 'offered', 'second', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'stuff', 'was', 'cut', 'U.S.', 'premiere', 'Very', 'interesting', 'indeed', 'even', 'dubbing', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'mainly', 'animation', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'lip-sync', 'problem', 'live-action', 'ones', 'do', 'Sadly', 'even', 'presence', 'uncut', 'version', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'certainly', 'not', 'classic', 'means']",Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio

602435,AFLTHO3MB4825,B00005JLNB,Robert J. Willert,"[10, 10]","When this film came out, U.S. audiences were 'treated' to the horribly dubbed version. Despite celebrity voices (Glenn Close, John Cleese, Cheech Marin, others), Benigni's film was doomed from the start. Also, Benigni's 'Pinocchio' was nothing like the Disney animated classic. Benigni's version is closer to the actual book, which can get very dark. When Pinocchio was hanging by the neck from a tree branch in this film, this came as quite a shock to family audiences. While Disney's classic remains the best version, it is only loosely based on the book (as most of Disney's animated story-telling is). Benigni's imaginative tale cost $45 million (the most expensive Italian film ever made). The money went into the marvelous sets, the costume designs, and the creation of the giant whale. The supporting cast is good. The main theme is never lost. Benigni does a good job at handling the complicated series of Pinocchio's adventures. In Benigni's film, characters are key. The Blue Fairy, the Cricket. You like these characters. Benigni's script has something to say, no matter how subtle. It is clear a lot went into the planning of this film. But the major drawback in the film was the casting of Roberto Benigni as Pinocchio. He simply looks too old for the role. Another problem is Benigni's tendency to get rather long-winded. Without coming up for air, his dialogue can get tedious. I found myself exhausted watching him, and hoping the Blue Fairy would slap some sense into him. This 'style' of performance exhausts the audience, and steals away some of the magic. Furthermore, Pinocchio should have resembled a puppet more. Benigni wears a clown-like costume and a pointed hat. This is OK, but considering the money thrown into this fairy tale, maybe a little more should have been paid to make him look less human. Still, Benigni's 'Pinocchio' is not the failure that critics will have you believe. I give Benigni high marks for imagination. The film may drag at times, but Benigni doesn't try to be too showy, and the film is superior to today's mindless summer fare. But be warned: Stay away from the dubbed version. Stick to the original Italian.

602440,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLNB,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 22]","[The following review refers to the original version.]  Let's face it.  I don't want to say this, but Roberto Begnigni's new film, live-action version about the story of Pinoccio is a huge disappointment.Not that everything in it is bad, I tell you.  On the contrary, you have Danilo Donati (famous for Felini's films) as production/costume designer.  You also have Academy-nominee Dante Spinotti as photographer, whose works in such as ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""The Insider"" ""LA Confidential"" are all memorable.  Plus, Nocola Piovani gives good soundtrack as in ""Life Is Beautiful,"" and even people from America help immensely with Rob Hodgson (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  But the result is quite unsatisfactory, even though we hear that this film became a big hit in Italy.  But why?It's Roberto Benigni as the star (not the director) of the film who should be blamed.  You just cannot accuse the people at The Golden Raspberry Awards of giving him an award.  If they find that Benigni's decision to cast himself as the titular wooden puppet unacceptable, that is only natural.  I share their thought, too, and while I was watching the film, I tried to find any reason that he should be in the title role.  I do not object his jumping around or talking fast itself.  It is just that he is NOT that puppet, Pinocchio, no matter how he does.In his country where films are more influantial than in Japan or in USA, Benigni has been seen as a sort of cultural icon, not just a comedian.  That makes his decison understandable to take up a beloved story of Pinocchio as subject matter, but it is also an undeniable fact that he could have made the film better and more accesible internationally by staying back behind the camera, not in front of it.  If the film is meant only for domestic market, his appearance could be justified, but as he is now known world-wide after the success of ""Life Is Beautiful,"" he should have been more cautious.A few words about the way of adapting the story.  The film, unlike classic Disney animation or the recent live-action made in 1996 (starring Martin Landou), follows pretty faithfully the original story by Carlo Collodi.  But as the original story was serialized in a periodical for children, and twice entended because of its huge popularity, the original book has some inconsistency in the plot.  (Believe or not, Pinocchio is once killed after 15 chapters of the book, but given another life later to continue the story!)As a consequence, in this film, you may not be sure whether or not The Talking Cricket is really dead; moreover, the identity of The Blue Fairy is very ambiguous.  These apparently incoherent elements are brought into the film without being modified much from the original.  The film adaptations of ""Pinocchio"" in the past solved the problem by simply smoothing out the jarring factors, simplifying the story, but Benigni just didn't follow suit.  If you have read the original book recenty, you will see his point; otherwise, you may be irritated by the story's a bit redundant nature.I don't think that the film is as bad as some people say.  Still, it is true that Benigni's portrayal as Pinocchio is ineffective and often annoying.  I like him and his partner Nicoletta Braschi (as The Blue Fairy); I really admire their sweet and creative relations represented in ""Life Is Beautiful.""  But ""Pinoccio"" just doesn't show that to me.",2,If Somebody Else Played Pinocchio ....,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,3408,"['[', 'following', 'review', 'refers', 'original', 'version', ']', 'Let', 'face', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'Roberto', 'Begnigni', 'new', 'film', 'live-action', 'version', 'story', 'Pinoccio', 'huge', 'disappointment.Not', 'everything', 'bad', 'tell', 'contrary', 'have', 'Danilo', 'Donati', 'famous', 'Felini', 'films', 'production/costume', 'designer', 'also', 'have', 'Academy-nominee', 'Dante', 'Spinotti', 'photographer', 'works', 'such', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Insider', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'are', 'memorable', 'Nocola', 'Piovani', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'even', 'people', 'America', 'help', 'immensely', 'Rob', 'Hodgson', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'result', 'quite', 'unsatisfactory', 'even', 'hear', 'film', 'became', 'big', 'hit', 'Italy', 'why', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'star', 'not', 'director', 'film', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'accuse', 'people', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'Awards', 'giving', 'award', 'find', 'Benigni', 'decision', 'cast', 'titular', 'wooden', 'puppet', 'unacceptable', 'only', 'natural', 'share', 'thought', 'too', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'tried', 'find', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'title', 'role', 'do', 'not', 'object', 'jumping', 'around', 'talking', 'fast', 'just', 'NOT', 'puppet', 'Pinocchio', 'matter', 'how', 'country', 'where', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'influantial', 'Japan', 'USA', 'Benigni', 'been', 'seen', 'sort', 'cultural', 'icon', 'not', 'just', 'comedian', 'decison', 'understandable', 'take', 'up', 'beloved', 'story', 'Pinocchio', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'better', 'more', 'accesible', 'internationally', 'staying', 'back', 'camera', 'not', 'front', 'film', 'meant', 'only', 'domestic', 'market', 'appearance', 'could', 'be', 'justified', 'now', 'known', 'world-wide', 'success', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'cautious.A', 'few', 'words', 'way', 'adapting', 'story', 'film', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animation', 'recent', 'live-action', 'made', '1996', 'starring', 'Martin', 'Landou', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'original', 'story', 'Carlo', 'Collodi', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'serialized', 'periodical', 'children', 'twice', 'entended', 'huge', 'popularity', 'original', 'book', 'inconsistency', 'plot', 'Believe', 'not', 'Pinocchio', 'once', 'killed', '15', 'chapters', 'book', 'given', 'life', 'later', 'continue', 'story', 'consequence', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'Talking', 'Cricket', 'really', 'dead', 'moreover', 'identity', 'Blue', 'Fairy', 'very', 'ambiguous', 'apparently', 'incoherent', 'elements', 'are', 'brought', 'film', 'being', 'modified', 'much', 'original', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Pinocchio', 'past', 'solved', 'problem', 'simply', 'smoothing', 'out', 'jarring', 'factors', 'simplifying', 'story', 'Benigni', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'suit', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'recenty', 'will', 'see', 'point', 'otherwise', 'may', 'be', 'irritated', 'story', 'bit', 'redundant', 'nature.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say', 'Still', 'true', 'Benigni', 'portrayal', 'Pinocchio', 'ineffective', 'often', 'annoying', 'like', 'partner', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'Blue', 'Fairy', 'really', 'admire', 'sweet', 'creative', 'relations', 'represented', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Pinoccio', 'just', ""n't"", 'show']",Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio
