1041538,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B000LXH0AO,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","I liked this film from the classic drive in movie viewpoint. Its a little scary, its a little dumb, its well filmed, the special effects are a little cheesy, and there are pretty women. So, there it is, just about the right formula for a summer movie when there's not much else to do at night.Aliens have invaded the earth in the form of beautiful young women. They pick a guy, take him out in the cold, and then inject their egg into the guy with these crazy wild tentacles. The egg recipient has to be frozen, but his heart has to say pumping. Its a delicate operation. The first time this implanting happens is just so funny. The opening scene is just classic, a guy and girl are making out in the back seat of a car on a deserted snow covered parking lot. A cop stops by to see if everything is all right. He leaves, and she implants the guy. The rest of the movie takes place on a college campus. The story line is predictible, but with a few twists. Classic summer movie.This isn't a film to analzye very carefully. The story doesn't hold together very well if you think about it too hard. Some things are a bit implausible, and don't make sense. I managed to just go along for the ride, and was pleasantly surprised by this film. The odd part, the filming was done rather well. Normally this type of movie is done on the super cheap and fast. No, lighting was always good. The shots were steady, well exposed, and clear. The tentacle special effect was a bit cheesy, but there have been much worse. When the woman takes the full on alien look, the alien was pretty decent. So a technical surprise, the director knew what he was doing. There's no academy award performances here. But generally the acting was competent, nobody just read their lines.In all, I got a few good laughs from Decoys 2. I appreciated the decent technical job of filming. The females were certainly attractive. There was more suggestiveness than out and out nudity, and that was pleasant. Where the film didn't do so well was the story line. With a little better script, this could be a much better film.",3,What a Strange Movie,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,2085,"['liked', 'film', 'classic', 'drive', 'movie', 'viewpoint', 'little', 'scary', 'little', 'dumb', 'well', 'filmed', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'cheesy', 'are', 'pretty', 'women', 'So', 'just', 'right', 'formula', 'summer', 'movie', 'when', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'do', 'night.Aliens', 'have', 'invaded', 'earth', 'form', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'pick', 'guy', 'take', 'out', 'cold', 'then', 'inject', 'egg', 'guy', 'crazy', 'wild', 'tentacles', 'egg', 'recipient', 'be', 'frozen', 'heart', 'say', 'pumping', 'delicate', 'operation', 'first', 'time', 'implanting', 'just', 'so', 'funny', 'opening', 'scene', 'just', 'classic', 'guy', 'girl', 'are', 'making', 'out', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'deserted', 'snow', 'covered', 'parking', 'lot', 'cop', 'stops', 'see', 'everything', 'right', 'guy', 'rest', 'movie', 'place', 'college', 'campus', 'story', 'line', 'predictible', 'few', 'twists', 'Classic', 'summer', 'movie.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'analzye', 'very', 'carefully', 'story', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'things', 'are', 'bit', 'implausible', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'managed', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'odd', 'part', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'rather', 'well', 'Normally', 'type', 'movie', 'done', 'super', 'cheap', 'fast', 'No', 'lighting', 'was', 'always', 'good', 'shots', 'were', 'steady', 'well', 'exposed', 'clear', 'tentacle', 'special', 'effect', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'When', 'woman', 'full', 'alien', 'look', 'alien', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'technical', 'surprise', 'director', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'academy', 'award', 'performances', 'here', 'generally', 'acting', 'was', 'competent', 'nobody', 'just', 'read', 'lines.In', 'got', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'Decoys', '2', 'appreciated', 'decent', 'technical', 'job', 'filming', 'females', 'were', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'was', 'more', 'suggestiveness', 'out', 'nudity', 'was', 'pleasant', 'Where', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'better', 'script', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'film']",Decoys: The Second Seduction

This time around it is basically the same exact film but with a different cast and well that is it. The ladies are back and they are needing some sex once more and of course the fellas are down to get down, we guys are so easy. But thanks to Luke and another kid that happens to see them much like Luke did in the first film they may not succeed.The first film was kinda funny and had some enjoyable moments in it and this one follows that same formula, this time though there is some good T & A. That is basically the biggest difference this time around as some of the ladies bare it for the cameras so this must be the unrated edition on DVD. Writers Tom Berry and Miguel Tejada-Flores really didn't change things up much for this go round and director Jeffery Scott Lando keeps things about the same.I am not really sure if I like this one better or which film I prefer but I guess they are about the same, did I already say that? Corey Sevier returns and is seeking some psychiatric help because he is not sure if the events were real. Oh and also the Lampoon style of the first is here in the form of a contest between the guys as they have to film their interactions with the opposite sex with their camera phones. Tyler Johnston plays Sam and is the lead this time around that learns of these creatures first, much like Luke in the first.Dina Meyer is good in this one as one would expect, you may know her from SAW 2, 3, and 4 and appearances on shows like BURN NOTICE and MONK. Also of SAW fame we have the great Tobin Bell in this flick and he is actually in a bit more then one would think. The ladies look good in this film and in fact I prefer the ones in this one, that may be because the strip in this one. The acting is fine and at times over the top much like the first, but it is this kinda flick.This is a decent flick and worth a rental or catching on TV or something I guess if you liked the first I think you will like this one. I was lucky enough to buy both for the price of one in a two pack so I guess it was worth it.",3,THE LAMPOON STYLE SPECIES ARE BACK,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,2201,"['DECOYSTHE', 'SECOND', 'SEDUCTIONWell', 'Luke', 'back', 'trying', 'get', 'over', 'what', 'happened', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'parts', 'first', 'one', 'time', 'basically', 'same', 'exact', 'film', 'different', 'cast', 'well', 'ladies', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'needing', 'sex', 'once', 'more', 'course', 'fellas', 'are', 'down', 'get', 'down', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'easy', 'thanks', 'Luke', 'kid', 'see', 'much', 'Luke', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'succeed.The', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'kinda', 'funny', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'one', 'same', 'formula', 'time', 'good', 'T', 'A', 'basically', 'biggest', 'difference', 'time', 'around', 'ladies', 'bare', 'cameras', 'so', 'must', 'be', 'unrated', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Writers', 'Tom', 'Berry', 'Miguel', 'Tejada-Flores', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'things', 'up', 'much', 'go', 'round', 'director', 'Jeffery', 'Scott', 'Lando', 'things', 'same.I', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'film', 'prefer', 'guess', 'are', 'same', 'did', 'already', 'say', 'Corey', 'Sevier', 'returns', 'seeking', 'psychiatric', 'help', 'not', 'sure', 'events', 'were', 'real', 'Oh', 'also', 'Lampoon', 'style', 'first', 'here', 'form', 'contest', 'guys', 'have', 'film', 'interactions', 'opposite', 'sex', 'camera', 'phones', 'Tyler', 'Johnston', 'Sam', 'lead', 'time', 'creatures', 'first', 'much', 'Luke', 'first.Dina', 'Meyer', 'good', 'one', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'may', 'know', 'SAW', '2', '3', '4', 'appearances', 'shows', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'MONK', 'Also', 'SAW', 'fame', 'have', 'great', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'flick', 'actually', 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'ladies', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'prefer', 'ones', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'strip', 'one', 'acting', 'fine', 'times', 'top', 'much', 'first', 'kinda', 'flick.This', 'decent', 'flick', 'worth', 'rental', 'catching', 'TV', 'something', 'guess', 'liked', 'first', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'buy', 'price', 'one', 'two', 'pack', 'guess', 'was', 'worth']",Decoys: The Second Seduction
1041543,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000LXH0AO,Joshua Koppel,"[2, 2]","The alien seducers from the original movie are back and they are trying to be more careful.  Our hero from the first movie is also back and in therapy.  He is also devouring evolutionary biology in some hopes of understanding what he went through.  But the main characters are a group of horny college students how have put together a contest to see who can sleep with the most women.  One of the roommates is a little reluctant 9he's holding out of someone else), and another is a virgin who would do it with anyone (except a gorgeous babe who is interested in him).  But the other two are fully into the idea.  Their attempts to pick up girls overlap the alien girls' attempts to mate with human males.  Unfortunately the babes still have the usual problem of freezing their mates.The alien babes are not as careful as they should be so some students other than our hero begin to suspect that something is going on.  As the evidence piles up the students know that the authorities would never believe them so they set out to locate and stop the aliens before they either kill more or succeed in their plans.  Eventually all of the characters are working together and put together a plan of action.  Will they succeed?  Will they be forced to have sex with beautiful aliens?  Will there be another sequel?  You will have to watch in order to find out.The original movie had the tag line, ""They can seduce anyone.""  But in the first they had trouble with this.  In the second movie they still do.  The characters you would think are the most eager are actually the most reluctant.  But other than that, this actually follows the first movie better than most sequels do.  Monsters, beautiful women, nudity, camp, and a reasonable plot actually make this better than a lot of the horror coming out these days.  I was somewhat surprised when the alien leader told the others that they had to take move more slowly in their seductions (more foreplay) so they don't freeze their mates and then they seem to move even faster.  Oh, well.  This movie does not try to be what it is not so it succeeds at trying to be what it is, a silly sex comedy/sci-fi horror film.
