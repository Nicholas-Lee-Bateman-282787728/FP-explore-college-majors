716570,A1K8UEUPSP7L33,B00006I4XS,Beginner pretzel,"[6, 6]","Let me start out by saying that this is not a video for absolute beginners.  Having said that, this is, overall a great video.  My only issue with the video is that when Ms. Birch says that there are alternative poses for those (like me) that are not quite flexible enough to do some of the bound poses she usually doesn't expound on what they are.  Although there is more than one person doing the video and they are of different levels ability, sometimes the camera doesn't show the easier variations.  That is my only criticism of this video.  Other than that, this is a fantastic dvd.  It is also one heck of a workout, and is also great for building your stamina.  This video is nonstop ashtanga from the get go all the way up to corpse pose.  Be ready to do plank to upward facing dog to downward facing dog between every pose.  This may not sound like much until you've done it for about an hour and ten minutes.  This video is also great to shoot for to improve yourself at yoga overall by going into poses that are usually not seen on other videos (i.e. a lot of the bound poses).  This is by far the most challenging yoga dvd that I personally own.",5,A Must for Your Home Practice Library,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1158,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'not', 'video', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'Having', 'said', 'overall', 'great', 'video', 'only', 'issue', 'video', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Birch', 'are', 'alternative', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'flexible', 'enough', 'do', 'bound', 'usually', ""n't"", 'expound', 'what', 'are', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'doing', 'video', 'are', 'different', 'levels', 'ability', 'sometimes', 'camera', ""n't"", 'show', 'easier', 'variations', 'only', 'criticism', 'video', 'Other', 'fantastic', 'dvd', 'also', 'one', 'heck', 'workout', 'also', 'great', 'building', 'stamina', 'video', 'nonstop', 'ashtanga', 'get', 'go', 'way', 'corpse', 'pose', 'Be', 'ready', 'do', 'plank', 'upward', 'facing', 'dog', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'pose', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'much', ""'ve"", 'done', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'video', 'also', 'great', 'shoot', 'improve', 'yoga', 'overall', 'going', 'poses', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'videos', 'i.e', 'lot', 'bound', 'far', 'most', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'personally', 'own']",N/A
716571,A1O3ONM1MJM7EM,B00006I4XS,"C. Marsteller ""Cafreen""","[37, 50]","I take live power yoga classes 2-3 times a week.  I've acheived wonderful results in 6 months of practice.  I wanted to bring the practice home and so purchased this based on these reviews.  Honestly, I'm surprised this has been rated so highly by many.  From the power yoga point of view, there isn't much power behind it.  She starts off with the basics: sun salutations A & B, followed by triangle, revolved triangle extended side angle, etc...(not necessarily in that order, but you get the picture)  There is a lengthy 15-20 minute segment right in the middle of the series that goes through 6 or 7 seated postures starting off with the staff pose. By this point, whatever heat you've built is completely gone and it feels a lot like a cool-down session. There is still another 20 minutes of poses after these seated postures.I'm the kind of person who likes to break a sweat, and I've had live sessions where I've left the room completely soaked as if I had run 10 miles.  I barely broke a sweat with this DVD, it was a moderate workout at best and NOTHING like the high intensity that power yoga is supposed to be (well, for me at least).  I finally got smart and asked my yoga instructor what she follows for home practice and she recommended Baron Baptiste.  If only I had consulted her prior to purchasing this DVD! I was very disappointed overall and I would not recommend this if you're seeking a serious power yoga workout.",2,No Power in this Power Yoga Practice,1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,1436,"['take', 'live', 'power', 'yoga', '2-3', 'times', 'week', ""'ve"", 'acheived', 'wonderful', 'results', '6', 'months', 'practice', 'wanted', 'bring', 'practice', 'home', 'so', 'purchased', 'based', 'reviews', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'been', 'rated', 'so', 'highly', 'many', 'power', 'yoga', 'point', 'view', ""n't"", 'much', 'power', 'basics', 'sun', 'salutations', 'A', 'B', 'followed', 'triangle', 'revolved', 'triangle', 'extended', 'side', 'angle', 'etc', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'get', 'picture', 'lengthy', '15-20', 'minute', 'segment', 'right', 'middle', 'series', '6', '7', 'seated', 'postures', 'starting', 'off', 'staff', 'pose', 'point', 'heat', ""'ve"", 'built', 'completely', 'gone', 'lot', 'cool-down', 'session', 'still', '20', 'minutes', 'poses', 'seated', 'postures.I', ""'m"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'break', 'sweat', ""'ve"", 'had', 'live', 'sessions', 'where', ""'ve"", 'left', 'room', 'completely', 'soaked', 'had', 'run', '10', 'miles', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat', 'DVD', 'was', 'moderate', 'workout', 'best', 'NOTHING', 'high', 'intensity', 'power', 'yoga', 'supposed', 'be', 'well', 'least', 'finally', 'got', 'smart', 'asked', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'what', 'home', 'practice', 'recommended', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'only', 'had', 'consulted', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'serious', 'power', 'yoga', 'workout']",N/A

Now Power Yoga is a derivative of Ashtanga yoga, a very athletic style yoga practice and Berryl's version of Power Yoga is as close to the eight limb tradition of Ashtange Yoga primary series with some variation.Users should defintely be familiar with Ashantga/Power Yoga prior to practicing this DVD through use of Birch's ""Power Yoga"" book or at least be a fast learner and athlete.  There are a number of students varying in size, age, gender, and flexibility.  The asanas are perfectly guided by Beryl who constantly reminds the users to stay mindful by using the breathe and engaging the locks.I have other Ashtanga/Power Yoga DVDs but none compare to this.

716573,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B00006I4XS,James E. White,"[68, 68]","I loved this DVD.  The workout is by no means easy.  I think that if you either have good endurance or want to improve your endurance, then buy this DVD.  This DVD goes no stop for roughly 75 minutes.  This is the full primary series she is doing, plus a few poses she throws in.  The DVD has no bookmarks or stopping points, it's basically either you do the whole thing or you just fast forward past what you don't want to do.I know some reviewers saw this this as a hindrance moreso than a help, but the idea is do all of the poses in a certain sequence.  The fact that there 8-10 people of different skill levels doing either the full pose or some modification makes up for lack of bookmarks/stopping points.  If you do want to just perform segments, then purchase Richard Freeman's Primary Series workout.  You can elect to do the whole workout (including opening and closing chants), or just perform segments (sun salutations, standing poses, seated poses, etc.).  However, there are no modifications, and Freeman is performing these poses at a near perfect level (check your ego at the door).  If you are looking for a shorter more accessible version of Ashtanga yoga, then try either Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga 3 or MTV's second power yoga tape.  While Baron offers a condensed (45 minute vs 75-90 minute) version that includes most of the easy to intermediate poses, the MTV version is a loosely based version of the primary series where many of the poses are there, but not necessarily in order, and the instructor uses a lot more creative license.I found this DVD highly motivating.  Seeing people of different skill levels get through the entire workout spurred me to go on.  Berly makes the primary series fun and accessible, but you will sweat.  If you think that 75+ minutes is too long, then try one of the other tapes I suggested, however, if you want to try to complete the primary series, and want to build the endurance needed to do 1-1.5 hrs of yoga, then buy this tape.",5,Tough but accessible workout,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,1991,"['loved', 'DVD', 'workout', 'means', 'easy', 'think', 'either', 'have', 'good', 'endurance', 'want', 'improve', 'endurance', 'then', 'buy', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'stop', 'roughly', '75', 'minutes', 'full', 'primary', 'series', 'doing', 'few', 'poses', 'DVD', 'bookmarks', 'stopping', 'points', 'basically', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do.I', 'know', 'reviewers', 'saw', 'hindrance', 'moreso', 'help', 'idea', 'do', 'poses', 'certain', 'sequence', 'fact', '8-10', 'people', 'different', 'skill', 'levels', 'doing', 'full', 'pose', 'modification', 'up', 'lack', 'bookmarks/stopping', 'points', 'do', 'want', 'just', 'perform', 'segments', 'then', 'purchase', 'Richard', 'Freeman', 'Primary', 'Series', 'workout', 'can', 'elect', 'do', 'whole', 'workout', 'including', 'opening', 'closing', 'chants', 'just', 'perform', 'segments', 'sun', 'salutations', 'standing', 'poses', 'seated', 'poses', 'etc.', 'However', 'are', 'modifications', 'Freeman', 'performing', 'poses', 'near', 'perfect', 'level', 'check', 'ego', 'door', 'are', 'looking', 'shorter', 'more', 'accessible', 'version', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'then', 'try', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Power', 'Yoga', '3', 'MTV', 'second', 'power', 'yoga', 'tape', 'Baron', 'condensed', '45', 'minute', 'vs', '75-90', 'minute', 'version', 'most', 'easy', 'intermediate', 'poses', 'MTV', 'version', 'loosely', 'based', 'version', 'primary', 'series', 'where', 'many', 'poses', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'instructor', 'lot', 'more', 'creative', 'license.I', 'found', 'DVD', 'highly', 'motivating', 'Seeing', 'people', 'different', 'skill', 'levels', 'get', 'entire', 'workout', 'spurred', 'go', 'Berly', 'primary', 'series', 'fun', 'accessible', 'will', 'sweat', 'think', '75+', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'then', 'try', 'one', 'other', 'tapes', 'suggested', 'however', 'want', 'try', 'complete', 'primary', 'series', 'want', 'build', 'endurance', 'needed', 'do', '1-1.5', 'hrs', 'yoga', 'then', 'buy', 'tape']",N/A

Maybe a year from now I'll be able to give this a try again. Three things prospective buyers should know. First, Beverly Woods uses the original language of yoga to instruct and you may get lost. Second, she goes very quickly, going through the sun salutations twice as quickly as Bryan Kest on his Power Yoga DVD. Third, there are a lot of advanced moves that she does not describe or give you detailed instruction. She assumes you know the moves from her book or that you are advanced and already have a familiarity with them. If you're a beginner or transitioning to intermediate, you may find this DVD discouraging and frustrating. Wait until you're advanced.
