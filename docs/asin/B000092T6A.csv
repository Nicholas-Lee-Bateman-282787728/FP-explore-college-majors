751343,A1YZ2NO74DCP48,B000092T6A,Autumn Butterfly,"[5, 6]","I was expecting the same type of foamy fundy type behavior that was so prevalent in Jesus Camp, but the group in Hell House came across as much more sane and sedate. There was some of the 'speaking in tongues' stuff but I didn't see anyone twitching on the floor (thank goodness), and in their interviews the kids and the adults both came across as thoughtful, bright and passionate without being so over-the-top.I was particularly impressed by a father we meet about ten minutes into the film. His daughter is trying out for the Hell House abortion scene and we see her and her three other siblings getting ready for school. You immediately sense something is different about this family because instead of mom cooking breakfast and hurrying the children along, their father is doing it. Turns out he and his wife split up because she was seeing someone she met on the internet and he not only has custody of his children, he is raising them by himself. One of the children has epilepsy and goes into a seizure at the table, and this father carries him to a comfortable room and talks (also prays) the little guy out of it while they wait for the ambulance to arrive. It's a very powerful and emotional scene, and this man is so gentle and loving with his children it just really pulls at your heart. Later on the father decides to try out for a scene himself and he and his daughter both end up with good roles.I've been very outspokenly against the whole concept of spiritually terrorizing kids at Halloween, and I still don't agree with terrifying children for the sake of proselytizing but I have to admit there's a lot of good intentions behind it. I don't think there's a drop of malice or evil intent in these people whatsoever, but I do question the wisdom of allowing children to see some of the scenes because they are so incredibly graphic. People dying of AIDS in a hospital room, a horrific car wreck,  a girl laid out on a hospital bed bleeding to death after a botched abortion. It was so realistic and frightening there's no way I'd ever let my little ones see it.The two scenes that got to me the most were the hospital scenes involving the AIDS patient and the post-abortion girl. It gives the wrong impression; that it's mainly gay people who get AIDS and it's their own fault. The setting and other aspects of the scene are quite realistically rendered, however, and I can see why people would be terrified by it.The botched abortion scene is even more graphic. A teen girl is wheeled in on a gurney, her crotch, legs and the bedding under her literally soaked in blood. The set people really know their stuff; it looked frighteningly real. And wet. The artificial blood was pooling under her. Very graphic. The site of it is shocking and intense. The worst part of it that while this girl is lying there crying and screaming in pain there's a rubber-masked, black-robed demon standing behind the bed yelling at her that she's a murderer and she deserves to suffer for killing her baby. I wasn't even there and it got to me, I can only imagine how horrifying this would be to an elementary or middle-school aged child. Scary to some adults, even.Oddly, no one complained save for a small group of kids who were so upset by the scene involving the gay kid in the hospital they confronted one of the adults. One of them was swearing and flipping the bird while yelling at the man about bigotry. I understood the upset but it could have been handled a bit more diplomatically. That better than any other part of the film showed the emotional and psychological impact the production has on people.Still, I couldn't help but giggle at their 'occult props', one of which was a black board with what they no doubt thought was a pentagram, which was actually a red star of david painted inside a circle. There was an underlying sense of camp to the Hell House, and I could easily imagine my son and I and I going in and being impressed by the more realistic things, then watching the occult scenes and just laughing our butts off. I mean, arms around each other's shoulders for support, leaning, tears of mirth streaming down our faces, breathless laughter. You get these awful images of bloody bodies, hospitals and tormented people followed by the most poorly informed and campily-staged scenes of satanism and/or witchcraft imaginable. Hilarious!!I found that while watching the film I experienced a strange mix of emotions ranging from hilarity to horror. It's definitely an objective look at something a lot of us are not involved in and it leaves you emotionally drained, to be sure, but you don't (at least I didn't) get the sense that these people are wackos like the 'Jesus Camp' group. They're sincere and very, very serious about what they're doing. Their passion is inspiring, even if they aren't exactly well-informed. I also liked the noticeable absence of input from the director. He didn't narrate, he didn't make an appearance, he didn't do anything but film what was being done and put up a camera for the individual church members to record their video diaries. The editing was sparse but tight and you get a sense of who these people are without the intrusion of a lot of special effects or negative commentary. I like this approach; it says, 'this is the way things are, take it or leave it'.Overall it's an excellent documentary, and a fascinating look into a belief system some of us haven't been exposed to, and others among us (like myself) are glad to have left behind. I'm looking forward to watching it again.",5,Not as wacky as I expected...,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,5550,"['was', 'expecting', 'same', 'type', 'foamy', 'fundy', 'type', 'behavior', 'was', 'so',

751344,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000092T6A,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 8]","When I requested this movie, I guess I assumed it was like ""Jesus Camp,"" produced by an outside film-maker who was either neutral or actively critical of the Hell House program. But apparently it was done by someone within the church, because the only critical scene was a brief one of a few teenagers who had just been through the program. Their primary complaint seemed to be that a direct consequence was implied to every thing they considered a sin: you're gay, you die of AIDS and go to hell. You go to a rave, you're going to be raped and commit suicide. It's an awfully grim picture they paint.They were complaining to the guy (I think he is the pastor of the church that put it on, but he may have been one of several ministers) who produced the program that it was unrealistic, only designed to scare people into joining their church. He didn't really disagree, he just thought that was a good thing.The movie starts in August, when the early planning stages are explained, the actors and actresses, mostly teenagers, are selected. You get to see scenes of the construction of the house, the auditions for the parts, all sorts of things. Interestingly, they are just as interested in how committed the kid is to the church as how good an actor or actress.The thing is seriously scary, gory, downright disgusting in parts. Then after you've ""gone through hell,"" the last part is a room where a guy says there are people through that door who will pray with you and help you. Or you can stay here and assume you know where you're going when you die. You have ten seconds, and then we will close the door. (He actually counts somewhat slower than that, but it's no more than 20 seconds, I would estimate.)I have studied propaganda and brainwashing techniques, and I was analyzing the details all through this. The most stark example is at the end, when time pressure to choose is upon you, and the assumption is that those people in the next room who will pray with you are the only way to get to heaven. Presumably you've already bought the idea that heaven and hell are real.I cannot recommend this movie.",1,Wish I Could Make it Zero Stars,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2113,"['When', 'requested', 'movie', 'guess', 'assumed', 'was', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'produced', 'outside', 'film-maker', 'who', 'was', 'neutral', 'actively', 'critical', 'Hell', 'House', 'program', 'apparently', 'was', 'done', 'someone', 'church', 'only', 'critical', 'scene', 'was', 'brief', 'one', 'few', 'teenagers', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'program', 'primary', 'complaint', 'seemed', 'be', 'direct', 'consequence', 'was', 'implied', 'thing', 'considered', 'sin', ""'re"", 'gay', 'die', 'AIDS', 'go', 'hell', 'go', 'rave', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'raped', 'commit', 'suicide', 'awfully', 'grim', 'picture', 'paint.They', 'were', 'complaining', 'guy', 'think', 'pastor', 'church', 'put', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'several', 'ministers', 'who', 'produced', 'program', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'designed', 'scare', 'people', 'joining', 'church', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'disagree', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'thing.The', 'movie', 'August', 'when', 'early', 'planning', 'stages', 'are', 'explained', 'actors', 'actresses', 'mostly', 'teenagers', 'are', 'selected', 'get', 'see', 'scenes', 'construction', 'house', 'auditions', 'parts', 'sorts', 'things', 'Interestingly', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'interested', 'how', 'committed', 'kid', 'church', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'actress.The', 'thing', 'seriously', 'scary', 'gory', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'parts', 'Then', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'hell', 'last', 'part', 'room', 'where', 'guy', 'are', 'people', 'door', 'who', 'will', 'pray', 'help', 'can', 'stay', 'here', 'assume', 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'when', 'die', 'have', 'ten', 'seconds', 'then', 'will', 'close', 'door', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'more', '20', 'seconds', 'would', 'estimate', 'have', 'studied', 'propaganda', 'brainwashing', 'techniques', 'was', 'analyzing', 'details', 'most', 'stark', 'example', 'end', 'when', 'time', 'pressure', 'choose', 'assumption', 'people', 'next', 'room', 'who', 'will', 'pray', 'are', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'heaven', 'Presumably', ""'ve"", 'already', 'bought', 'idea', 'heaven', 'hell', 'are', 'real.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie']",Hell House
751345,A8KWNRQPZLAXC,B000092T6A,Bette,"[0, 4]","Hell House is put on by many churches by now.  Supposedly, most of the attendees are bussed in from other churches, so they have an idea what to expect.  But these churches also attempt to attract the ""unsaved;"" unsuspecting persons who believe they are going to see the best haunted house ever, as one of their Halloween activities.  (A friend of mine was one of these people, and he told me his story.)Aside from the usual hypocrisy and general bs of preachy churches like this, the real SICK here is the blaming of rape and incest victims for those crimes against them, the bleeding-to-death-and-on-her-way-to-hell abortion victim being screamed at by a demon for ""killing her baby,"" and the homosexual dying from AIDS, because in their minds, only homosexuals get AIDS, and they deserve to die.After the attendees (mostly kids, tweens and teens) go through this sickness, they sit down with ""counselors"" who get them to complete forms wherein they recommit to the faith.They also have acting awards for the ""actors"" in the production.  It's like Oscars/Prom - they get dressed up, they receive golden awards for best performance, they accept their awards and give acceptance speeches.Truly insidious and gross is how this one teen girl (a cheerleader) is totally playing the whole system to her advantage. She's the best actress of all, spouting out ""the preach"" like a pro, but one can feel and see her performance - she KNOWS that it's bs, but she is like ""the prettiest whackjob of all.""  She's gaining popularity and power within the system and she's going with it.  This is the kind of atmosphere that raises psycho-power-nuts who end up in politics and as evil ceo's of companies like Halliburton.  These are the women that look the other way while their daughters are being raped by their fathers.More pathetic might be the father of several young children (and the cheerleader mentioned above) who tossed out the wife for having had an internet affair. OK, she cheated.  But they malign this woman as though she were Satan! The father, who had a very inappropriate moment with his daughter in which he begged for a special cheer for daddy, won custody of all several children.  I can only imagaine what a nightmare the custody battle was for this poor mother.  In most modern societies, a mother has to commit severe crimes against her children to lose custody.  All this woman did was cheat on her husband, and she was metaphorically burned at the stake!  She is nowhere to be found, hence cannot defend herself in this documentary.  She was probably run out of town.We should have heard more from the director, he's oddly silent throughout.  One of the extras is Ratliff's This American Life appearance, and it is worth a listen if you have not already heard it.",3,A good look at some very sick people,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2776,"['Hell', 'House', 'put', 'many', 'churches', 'now', 'Supposedly', 'most', 'attendees', 'are', 'bussed', 'other', 'churches', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'churches', 'also', 'attempt', 'attract', 'unsaved', 'unsuspecting', 'persons', 'who', 'believe', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'best', 'haunted', 'house', 'ever', 'one', 'Halloween', 'activities', 'friend', 'mine', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'told', 'story', 'Aside', 'usual', 'hypocrisy', 'general', 'bs', 'preachy', 'churches', 'real', 'SICK', 'here', 'blaming', 'rape', 'incest', 'victims', 'crimes', 'bleeding-to-death-and-on-her-way-to-hell', 'abortion', 'victim', 'being', 'screamed', 'demon', 'killing', 'baby', 'homosexual', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'minds', 'only', 'get', 'AIDS', 'deserve', 'die.After', 'attendees', 'mostly', 'kids', 'tweens', 'teens', 'go', 'sickness', 'sit', 'down', 'counselors', 'who', 'get', 'complete', 'forms', 'recommit', 'faith.They', 'also', 'have', 'acting', 'awards', 'actors', 'production', 'Oscars/Prom', 'get', 'dressed', 'up', 'receive', 'golden', 'awards', 'best', 'performance', 'accept', 'awards', 'give', 'acceptance', 'speeches.Truly', 'insidious', 'gross', 'how', 'one', 'teen', 'girl', 'cheerleader', 'totally', 'playing', 'whole', 'system', 'advantage', 'best', 'actress', 'spouting', 'out', 'preach', 'pro', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'see', 'performance', 'bs', 'prettiest', 'whackjob', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'power', 'system', 'going', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'psycho-power-nuts', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'politics', 'evil', 'ceo', 'companies', 'Halliburton', 'are', 'women', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'daughters', 'are', 'being', 'raped', 'fathers.More', 'pathetic', 'might', 'be', 'father', 'several', 'young', 'children', 'cheerleader', 'mentioned', 'who', 'tossed', 'out', 'wife', 'having', 'had', 'internet', 'affair', 'OK', 'cheated', 'malign', 'woman', 'were', 'Satan', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'inappropriate', 'moment', 'daughter', 'begged', 'special', 'cheer', 'daddy', 'won', 'custody', 'several', 'children', 'can', 'only', 'imagaine', 'what', 'nightmare', 'custody', 'battle', 'was', 'poor', 'mother', 'most', 'modern', 'societies', 'mother', 'commit', 'severe', 'crimes', 'children', 'lose', 'custody', 'woman', 'did', 'was', 'cheat', 'husband', 'was', 'metaphorically', 'burned', 'stake', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'hence', 'can', 'not', 'defend', 'documentary', 'was', 'probably', 'run', 'town.We', 'should', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'director', 'oddly', 'silent', 'One', 'extras', 'Ratliff', 'American', 'Life', 'appearance', 'listen', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'heard']",Hell House
751346,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000092T6A,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 9]","Wanna get the cr@p scared out of you? And I don't mean that in any respectfully horror-ish way when referring to HELL HOUSE. I mean it in a way that'll cause you to doubt human sanity.Technique-wise, I have to give the creators of this idea a definite thumbs up. Utilizing graphic imagery to frighten people toward God, the Assembly of God Church has accomplished something quite unique every October 31st. Threatening sinners with eternal damnation if they have premarital sex, are gay, or attend a rave party, this church puts on a haunted house filled with gore and violence each Halloween. The actors and actresses are pulled from their congregation annually. Some are young women who dip their crotches in fake blood and scream in mock pain while perched on a makeshift hospital gurney (their dialogue during this horrific scene is centered around ""the morning after pill""and how dangerous it is ...which is completely untrue of course, but we're talking self-induced abortion so this little fib is obviously okay.)Other scenes include a homosexual man dying of AIDS. A ghoulishly evil creature hovers around him and comments on his ""evil lifestyle choice"" as he groans his last breath and is ushered into everlasting pain and devilish servitude (never mind that the man may have been a pediatrician who cured a type of cancer that saved thousands of lives. Homo? You're goin' to Hell!)At the end of peoples' tour through these strange Halloween acts, prayer groups are offered up for those who wish to be saved. Never mind that the pressure put on the guests by the aforementioned scenes and the ""limited time"" they have to act on this compulsion are stressed to the maximum (""You have six seconds to walk through that door and be saved by Jesus. One..."")Probably the biggest downer here is that this is a growing phenomenon. Forget that God is merciful or full of love or wants you to be happy. That's not what this is about. This is all about fear and the tactics used to instill it by a group of individuals who claim to be ""religious."" Excuse me but isn't religion supposed to be about acceptance, caring, and the loving nature of Jesus/God? Maybe I'm missing something.The other issue is that these Assembly of God members obviously have no idea what Halloween is about nor its history (Note: All Hallows Day - also known as ""All Saints' Day"". The holiday was a day of religious festivities in various northern European Pagan traditions, until Popes Gregory III and Gregory IV moved the old Christian feast of All Saints' Day from May 13 to November 1. In the ninth century, the Church measured the day as starting at sunset, in accordance with the Florentine calendar. Although we now consider All Saints' - or Hallows' - day to be on the day after Halloween, they were, at that time, considered to be the same day.)The church also shows how suicide is a sin. But God (nor the bible) ever said this (Note: ""In the early Christian era suicide was not only tolerated, but condoned by the church, as a result certain sects such as the Donatists and the Circumcellions jumped off cliffs in great numbers to hasten an afterlife that promised greater rewards than those found on jolly old Earth.

The goal of this infamous haunted house is to scare people, especially kids, into turning away from their ""evil"" secular lifestyle and joining the church. Inside Hell House young actors play characters like ""Abortion Girl"", ""Suicide Girl"" and ""Dying Of AIDS Gay Guy"" as examples of the sorts of sins that will send you to eternal suffering and damnation in the fiery pits of Hell.One aspect of this documentary that I appreciated was it's objectivity. I imagine that the church members insisted that they be allowed to speak for themselves and express their beliefs. The director wisely consented, as I'm sure he realized that the words of these extremists would be more damning than any method of satire or ridicule he could create on his own. And believe me these hellfire and brimstone lunatics don't disappoint in their hypocrisy and absurdity.I expected to laugh. But my reaction was actually one more of sadness and worry. I have two nephews growing up in a Pentecostal church in Florida that probably is not too different from this one. My nephews are smart kids and hopefully once they become older they will begin to think for themselves and get away from the brainwashing my idiotic ex-sister in law and her ridiculous church is forcing on them.I also felt bad for the kids in this movie, taught to believe that the world is inherently evil and that the impending return of Christ is their only hope. The violence, bigotry and lies in Hell House were bad enough. But the worse part was the final room where they force everyone to wait before exiting while they try to pressure them into joining the church. Think of the public outcry if some group of Muslim extremists, who have very similar notions of Hell, were to try to gain youthful converts through methods such as this. But I guess if they are Christians it's considered OK.It's hard to imagine any religous teachings that are further away than these from the essential Christian message of love and mercy.

751354,A2BLITJITO97N5,B000092T6A,Ingalls,"[1, 15]","This is the sort of documentary that will drive secular nihilists nuts - which is why I liked it so much. Here we have some decent people in Dallas who take their faith and convictions seriously. Both the adults and teenagers at Trinity Church are the type of people you would love to have as neighbors. They exude goodness, honesty, and sincerity. They are committed to their families, their children, and their faith. I'd trust any of them to keep an eye on my house while I was out of town. And I would go out of my way to help them if they needed me. You won't find any of that post-modern sneering cynicism and moral nihilism that is an indicator of the intellectual and cultural bankruptcy that some Americans want to import from exhausted old Europe. So what did Trinity Church do to earn so much venomous criticism from  so many haters of Christianity? They put on a show about heaven and hell. Being Christian, they believe that some acts earn salvation and some acts earn damnation. Because liberals tend to have no strong moral convictions about much of anything, this is offensive enough to them. To go further and suggest that there may actually be a moral code built into a universe that they see as meaningless only adds to the crime of Trinity Church in their eyes. Throw in some very thinly veiled hatred of Christians (which is the default position in some intellectual, academic, and geographical circles) that would be considered socially taboo if aimed at any other group and you begin to understand why Trinity Church became a target. I like that Trinity put on Hell House and that the members of TC believe in hell. Religion should have some bite - ecstasy needs to be balanced with reverence and fear if it isn't going to be reduced to a self-serving pleasure machine that refuses to deal with the evil possibilities that lie within each of us. Some will complain that Hell House was inappropriate for the young. The same people who make that complaint would be the first to object to any censoring of movies or violent video games. They are probably the same people downloading multi-gigs of porn off the internet. No, it's not realistic violence or the portrayal of disturbing situations that they object to. They love that stuff. The media is full of it. What they don't like is Christians doing it - because it lends emotional power to the message of Christians. They don't like that.

751356,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000092T6A,Jean E. Pouliot,"[3, 3]","""Hell House"" is a documentary showing the way that one Assemblies of God church in Texas chooses to teach morality -- by mounting a haunted house that literally shows the wages of sin. The teens and adult leaders of Trinity Church spend a couple of months building sets, holding auditions, making costumes and writing sketches that show how abortion, homosexuality, internet chat rooms, raves, suicide and other aspects of modern life lead to death and to eternal punishment in Hell. This is conservative American Christian morality at its most literal and graphic. No nuances allowed. You accept Jesus or you go to Hell. Period.The church adults are the odd, plasticky Jesus types who live their lives in a bubble defined by their theology and distrust of the secular world. The kids are kids -- full of youthful energy and enthusiastic about their church and Jesus. Some have been scarred by modern life by rape or the drug scene and hold onto their faith for meaning and support. Many are just regular kids who grew up in a world defined by their church and its teachings.But churchy or not, every October, the group lets go of Jesus for a walk on the wild side and a chance to portray prostitutes, druggies, killers and drunks. There is some irony in a church that fears the Devil encouraging its young to portray -- in lurid detail -- the sins they should be avoiding. Some folks put a lot of themslves into their work. One young man enjoyed going to raves before his conversion. But his choice of hell-bound debauchery is the rave scene -- which he constructs with loving attention, seting himself up as the demented DJ. A girl who had been raped chooses to play a girl getting raped. Most affectingly, a man whose wife left him for a man she met online is shown watching the very scene that destroyed his life and turned him into a single Dad. This man happens also to be the father of 5 kids -- from about 2 to 16 -- one of whom has cerebral palsy and actually goes into a seizure at the breakfast table. The Dad, already frazzled beyond what anyone should have to bear, calmly holds the kid down with one hand while dialing 911 with the other. Just another day in the life of a struggling disciple of Jesus. His heart is broken on a daily basis, yet he plods on.While well-meaning, the people who put on Hell House have the kind of unempathic, unloving religious fanaticism that allows them to stage a school attack scene -- complete with shotguns and trenchcoats -- just 6 months after the Columbine shooting. That's just creepy and wrong. The idea that the shooters get dragged to Hell by cackling demons is such a hurtful assault on the parents of the boys involved and is bad theology to boot. Judge not, lest ye be judged. The lone girl who gets taken to Heaven is the one said to have confessed her Christian faith. The rest of the murdered kids get left on the library floor in ambiguous limbo. That's exploitation at its worst.Hell House is not a terribly well-made film, but its subjects are endlessly fascinating.

White ""impossiblefunky""","[8, 10]","In what often feels like a Christian-themed WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, teenage thespians vie for roles as ""the abortion girl"" or ""the date raper"" in the tenth annual Hell House ""Haunted House."" Documenting this yearly collection of social ills and flagrant sins presented by the Trinity Assembly of God in Dallas, Texas, HELL HOUSE provides ample belly laughs coupled with groans of frustration.Director George Ratliff takes the audience behind the scenes of the tenth annual Hell House, from early brainstorming sessions to ""opening night,"" where Bible-thumping thespians try to save souls via their morality plays. We witness the wild auditions, fact-checking of the script (""Is it 'Magic' or 'The Gathering'?""), and creation of the sets. In between, we catch glimpses of Pentecostal pandemonium wherein prayer sessions are plagued with folks speaking in tongues (""Speaking in tongues is like speaking in French or German,"" says one parishioner), sounding like a Latka Gravis convention.With material this good, it's difficult to go wrong but HELL HOUSE nearly does. The film remains steadfastly objective throughout. At times, the stone-faced journalism allows the irony to flow freely. However, the muted opinion of the film quiets the outrageousness of these amateur actors as they present crazed scenes of abortions, homosexuality, and suicide. Sure, the scripts to the preachy skits of Hell House sound like they're right out of a Jack Chick comic book but their implications are ominous.

I was really to launch my liberal idealistic arguments into a fight with this movie. But, instead, I almost fell asleep and my liberal values went to sleep also.The documentary is completely unbiased, it simply lays out these people's project and how they come about it (with excessive detail). There documentary does not try to steer you into any direction, which I appreciate, but the excessive detail as to pre-production was too boring. The documentary showed everything from the building of the hell house to auditions (Yay! I am the suicide girl, or I am the abortion girl! ....Sickening) to the through process behind it all. But, finally we get to the end, which was very interesting.In my own personal opinion, this is a bit wrong. They are carrying out an ultra conservative message from being gay is evil and you will get AIDS, or if you go to a rave, take drugs and get raped, it is all your fault. The liberal in me was a bit upset that they would present a situation in which a young girl, who was raped by her father, and other people at a rave, and obviously not in her right state of mind, will go to hell because she committed suicide.

751360,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B000092T6A,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[0, 0]","When I was a teenager I had an audio tape of evangelist and alleged exorcist Bob Larson visiting hell (or describing the experiences of somebody else who visited hell; I forget which). I lent the tape to a friend of mine, a headbanger who looked the part with his long hair and worn jean jacket with the Iron Maiden backpatch. He listened to it in his bedroom. Lying there in the semi-darkness, listening to the evangelist drone on about the flames of hell and the unimaginable torments of those left to rot there, he quite literally was scared into becoming a Christian.This kind of fear-based evangelism has long been a staple of evangelical preaching. Most of us have probably read (or at least heard of) Jonathan Edwards&#8217; famous sermon of the First Great Awakening, &#8220;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&#8221;. The fire and brimstone preacher has long been a staple of North American evangelical piety. And even if such preaching techniques are not now as common as they once were, countless evangelicals still think of evangelism as the selling of fire insurance.Consider then the 2001 documentary &#8220;Hell House&#8221;. The film follows Trinity Church, an Assemblies of God congregation in Cedar Hill, Texas in the year 2000 as it prepares for its tenth year putting on &#8220;Hell House&#8221;, a hard hitting evangelistic outreach that files visitors (each paying $7) through several scenes with live actors playing out a series of grisly scenes, each involving a death from things like a botched abortion, AIDS, and suicide. Each scene is framed with a grim theme like &#8220;drug deal&#8221;, &#8220;rave&#8221;, &#8220;occult&#8221; and &#8220;suicide&#8221;.Not surprisingly, the situation of evangelical Christians acting out very grisly scenes provides many moments of deadpan humor. For example, in one scene Mr. Cassar (who comes across as a deeply committed father of several children) is driving his kids to school when he tells his teenage daughter that he&#8217;d like to try out for the family violence scene. She expresses skepticism saying she finds it hard to picture her dad hitting and stabbing a woman. He agrees, it is a stretch!Equally amusing moments follow. At one point the pastor asks his workers: &#8220;Y&#8217;all need red paint for the pentagram?&#8221;During the auditions one young man says he&#8217;d like to act any part but the drug deal scene because that&#8217;s the only scene he&#8217;s acted in the past. He caps off the request with a vote of piety when he says he prays that the Spirit will lead them not to cast him in the drug deal scene!After his rehearsal one man observes, &#8221;I&#8217;m playing the villain so if people are hatin&#8217; me I did my job. Now I need to leave here and go to church.&#8221;At another point a man says: &#8220;This is Jessica, my girlfriend. It&#8217;s kind of a neat story. We&#8217;ve known each other for awhile but last October, uh, she was the, uh, victim in the rave scene and I was the death monitor of the DJ. And what was really neat, for a whole month I claimed her soul to hell and she died under my power. Just shortly after that we got together and everything&#8217;s been great since&#8230;.&#8221;And to cap it off, on opening night one guy says into his walkie talkie: &#8220;Hello, Stephen? Would you look around in the control room in the portable and see if there is a knife that the occult people can use to cut the bride&#8217;s throat with?&#8221;Just another day at the Trinity Church Assemblies of God!The evangelistic outreach is definitely fear based and decision based. After the tour through hell groups are led into a room where a man (presumably a pastor or deacon) gives a short evangelistic message. After that a door opens and he invites people to walk through and receive prayer to become Christians. He then begins a countdown from 5. When he reaches 1 the door is closed again. Everything is directed to getting people to make a crisis decision, and over the previous decade the film reports that 15,000 of 75,000 attendees have made such a decision.Obviously hell house is a well-intentioned effort and a massive undertaking. And the filmmakers seem to be quite sympathetic with the participants, especially Mr. Cassar who is caring for several children &#8212; including an epileptic child &#8212; since his wife left him for another man. The filmmakers are not interested in presenting caricatures. These are real people and even if one might question their methods, their intentions are good. (Good intentions, eh? But what&#8217;s that they say about the road to hell itself being paved with such as these?)Let me make two observations about the limits of hell house. To begin with, it presents a very distorted and limited picture of sin and death. The house includes all the usual suspects for sin: dramatic scenes of people engaged in the occult, drugs, the &#8220;homosexual lifestyle&#8221;, abortion. But where are the rooms that depict the sin of failing to aid the poor or the sin of religious hypocrisy? And in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus preached that a person can sin in mind with no external action. So how about a room of a man who is simply sitting serenely on his couch and yet is sinning egregiously in mind? The point was well stated by Harry Blamires in his classic book The Christian Mind:&#8220;But the Christian mind cannot accept the facile distinction made by the secular mind &#8211; reflected in public society &#8211; between the nation&#8217;s criminals and libertines on the one hand and her good men on the other. For the discerning Christian knows that a cunning or intelligent man may lead a life of almost diabolical pride, in which he strives in every moment to minister to the desires and vanities of his own inflated self&#8212;and yet may pass for a respectable, law-abiding citizen. Indeed he may rise to a position of eminence in the world by the persistent and subtle practice of the most calculated self-service. He may become a judge, packing off poor men to gaol [jail] with words of stern condemnation ostensibly reflecting the indignation of righteous men, and yet he may be, by virtue of a cancerous inner self-centredness, the greatest sinner, essentially the most evil man, ever to have entered the courtroom in which he sits&#8212;though its dock has accommodated a stream of murders, thieves, and perverts for the last fifty years.&#8221;  (p. 90, emphasis added)So how about a hell house that subverts our comfortable picture of what sin is? How about a hell house that challenges our comfortable notions about who is in and who is out? Blamires made the point effectively by reflecting on Jesus&#8217; teaching on the sheep and goats:&#8220;The Christian mind knows that, in any sorting out of the sheep and the goats, of the virtuous from the sinful, the forces of Heaven would slice through human society at an unexpected angle. The knife would cut firmly, but certainly not horizontally. What can we say or think of how it would separate the self-seekers from the fundamentally God-directed souls, except that it would certainly not leave all the convicts and perverts and public nuisances on one side, and all the cabinet ministers and business executives &#8230; on the other?&#8221; (p. 91)This brings me to my second point. This woefully incomplete picture of sin and alienation is not only manipulative for its focus on a fear-based quick decision, but it also alienates many people who see through the distorting simplicity of the church&#8217;s moralistic framework. This is how one articulate young woman puts it to one of the volunteer workers:&#8220;This is why people are so turned off to the Christian religion was that in there. It seemed that they&#8217;re stereotyping. If you&#8217;re gay you&#8217;re going to hell.&#8221; &#8220;You make it too cut and dried, too black and white. There&#8217;s no grey area. It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t have that grey area and that&#8217;s what life is.&#8221;randalrauser.com",4,Scare the hell out of people in Jesus' name,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,8031,"['When',

751361,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000092T6A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[55, 69]","Hell House (George Ratliff, 2001)Hell House is a documentary, a quick look at the infamous haunted house run every October by a Pentecostal church in Texas. One gets the distinct feeling that the church members had no idea Ratliff was making this documentary to poke fun at them, as earnest as they are.The best scenes in this are those where Ratliff is using wordless, lingering shots to show how little these people actually know about what they're doing. The funniest thing in the whole movie is one church member describing the ""occult"" scene, which uses a pentagram; actually, it's not a pentagram, it's a Star of David in a circle. (It continues to amaze me no one there, seemingly, knows how to count to five.) Moments like this happen with regularity in the film, if you're paying close enough attention. Most of them are more subtle, but the payoff is just as grand.For those of you unfamiliar with the increasingly-popular Hell Houses, a quick rundown: a Hell House is a Christian ""haunted house""-type Halloween attraction put on for the purpose of converting the heathen. Everything from the amusing (raves, satanic sacrifice) to the boring (kid commits suicide because his peers are picking on him) to the morally repugnant (at this congregation, at least, AIDS is still strictly a ""gay disease"") is depicted in an attempt to scare the heathen straight and get them to convert. Does it work? This documentary would lead you to believe not, despite the claims of one church member that a number of people converted that month. (Entirely possible; Ratliff couldn't film all the groups being ministered to, of course, and the church (backed up by news reports) claims three thousand coming through per day. Like the old mama said, if you throw enough spaghetti against a wall...Best watched for the amusement factor, but prepare to be horrified as well.

The filmmakers -- in true verite style -- make no commentary as they record everything from initial script meetings through the lavish stage production of this peculiar, over-the-top sermon meant to scare the hell out of non-believers.

This film is very interesting, regardless of one's beliefs. The scenes of the young children who go through the house - only to find themselves traumatized - are memorable. Also, I found that the Hell House in the film was surprisingly sophisticated; a lot of planning went into all aspects of the production.I think that the filmmakers do a good job of showing viewers what happens at a Hell House without trying to tell the viewers what to think. Too many of the journalists who comment on the Christian Right spend most of their time condemning fundamentalists. As a result, our understanding of a large segment of the U.S. population is incomplete. Hell House allows you to draw your own conclusions.My wife and I watched a streaming (online) version of the film. Unfortunately, the video was low quality and it was distracting as we watched.One aspect of fundamentalism that particularly bothers me is on vivid display in this film. I have noticed that fundamentalist parents tend to push their kids onto the front lines to do the hard work; the parents, meanwhile, do not demand the same sacrifices of themselves. If a ""true"" Christian is supposed to proselytize, then the parents should ""step up"" and do some of the hard work.Hell House is an interesting look at a disturbing trend.

751365,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B000092T6A,The Cool Guy,"[9, 11]","I saw this movie and it struck home with me. Mainly because I used to think that way. I used to be a Christian, and here was how I thought about life: ""We are in a war. The battle is being fought over souls. We must win this war at any cost. Fear is a good thing, because the important thing is that people come to Jesus. It doesn't matter how.""However, this doesn't hold up. Faith based on fear is no faith at all no matter what Christians say. Emotional intimidation and bullying are characteristics of cults. I respect Christians who do not use scare tactics to share the Gospel. But I question why they believe in any of it at all.The subject of Hell House is Hell. I do not understand why the concept is so important to Christians. What sin has any person commited that would warrant them spending an ETERNITY being tortured forever? What sin deserves such punishment? Even the worst child molester will have been punished enough after a thousand years or so. But eternity? Why is this an acceptable belief system for Christians? If a person tortured somebody, they would feel shocked. But when God does it, it is okay.The Christian god is an unjust god. They can argue that god doesn't send people to hell; they send themselves to hell. But god created the torture chamber. The creator of the torture chamber is no better than the one who sends people there.Really thinking about HELL for the first time in my life is what made me leave Christianity after 28 years. Hell is so wrong and immoral that I could never believe in a god who would create such a thing. I am now an Atheist, and proud of it. I watched this DVD shortly after I left Christianity. It is certainly thought-provoking. But mostly it is just sad. Over and over, I could see the brain-washing and the lies that I myself used to believe also. I could see the silliness and absurdity of the entire message. I can't believe that that used to be me.For you Christians out there, this movie is completely objective. To his credit, the producer imposes no opinions, and lets Christians have their complete say. Christians get the last word in this movie, and unbelievers are shown to be inarticulate at best.This was filmed in Cedar Hill, Texas. I used to live not far from there, and actually attended that church for some time while I was in college. So I recognized a few of the people in this movie. That youth pastor is a total jerk. It is obvious from the movie. It is his way or the highway. He could learn a thing or two from the Bible about submission and love.The ignorance of some (not all) of the people in this movie is astounding. Hearing them talking about Goosebumps and Magic: The Gathering was amazing. They actually know absolutely nothing about these subjects, yet they condemn them and talk like those things will turn you into a Satanist. That stereotype is a typical example of Christian bigotry and stupidity. Have they ever actually read Goosebumps even once in their life? Have they ever played Magic: The Gathering or met anyone who has? Some Christians are so naive that they really will believe anything they are told. That one scene demonstrated that very effectively.I also found this movie to be sad. I really felt for the guy with the epileptic son. My heart moved for him. And I cringed when I heard him talking about his wife leaving him because of her sin. No wonder people find comfort in religion. It is much easier to say, ""My wife left me because she is a sinner and I'm a Christian,"" rather than, ""My wife left me because our marriage was screwed up."" But I still felt for the man. I also felt angry that he is trapped in the defeatest position that the church puts you in, where you are a victim who cannot change your situation except through prayer. And you've got to put up with all that kind of crap in your life ""out of love"".The quality of this movie is excellent. I especially liked the background music and the ""demons"" deleted scene. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 only because I wish that he had left in the Satanic Sacrifice scene. The producer probably thought that would be a little too grisly and over-the-top even for this movie. But hey, that came from the mind of Christians and no one else.One final word here. I hope Christians will watch this movie and really think about what their church and what their Bible is telling them. I do not think that Christians truly believe in hell, or they would live their life quite differently. If they truly believed in hell, then every ounce of their spare time, energy, and money would be spent in trying to convert and save souls. How can one Christian's life compare to an entire eternity of one unbeliever suffering? Even if a Christian sacrifices his entire existence witnessing, it is worth it to save just one soul. Anything less is hypocritical.Christians file Hell into that part of the brain labeled ""Do Not Think."" I am convinced that Christians do not truly believe in hell. If Christians truly believed in hell, then they would not live the lives of luxury that they enjoy in America today. Thanks for reading this review.P.S. I watched this movie one time and now I'm selling it.

751366,A1O4METJV1LE91,B000092T6A,"William A. Carroll ""Bill Carroll""","[2, 3]",Most of the other reviews have summed it up quite nicely. However scenes of cute smiling young teens saying some of the things they say in this film were quite chilling and frightening. It is quite disturbing to see these kids involved in this exercise of FEAR and exclusion of free thought. I find it difficult to express exactly what I'm thinking but basically it is just VERY disturbing and scary. I don't pray in the traditional sense but I pray that some of these kids can some day think and do what THEY truly want to. Amazing!,5,SCARY SCARY SCARY!!!,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,533,"['Most', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'summed', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', 'However', 'scenes', 'cute', 'smiling', 'young', 'teens', 'saying', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'chilling', 'frightening', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'see', 'kids', 'involved', 'exercise', 'FEAR', 'exclusion', 'free', 'thought', 'find', 'difficult', 'express', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'basically', 'just', 'VERY', 'disturbing', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'pray', 'traditional', 'sense', 'pray', 'kids', 'can', 'day', 'think', 'do', 'what', 'THEY', 'truly', 'want', 'Amazing']",Hell House
