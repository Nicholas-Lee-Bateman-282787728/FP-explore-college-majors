This has some of the characters from the comics but it's mostly all a bunch of characters who arn't in the comics.  It doesn't have Gambit in it and it doesn't have Jubilee.  If you're an X-Men fan don't get this.,2,This is  a very dumb cartoon.,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,244,"['liked', '90s', 'X-Men', 'series', 'characters', 'comics', 'mostly', 'bunch', 'characters', 'who', 'ar', ""n't"", 'comics', ""n't"", 'have', 'Gambit', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jubilee', ""'re"", 'X-Men', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'get']",X-Men: Evolution - Mutants Rising

I was pleased to find that the animation, lip-synching, and voice acting had improved a bit.  Kurt/Nightcrawler remains my favorite element of the series; I also enjoy the high school setting, the anime style of the drawings, and the interesting situations that arise.  The humor can be lame sometimes, but at other times it's effective.  There's a surprising revelation about Rogue's friend Risty in one of the episodes on this DVD.Overall, X-Men: Evolution definitely is not the best kids' show out there, but it's got some redeeming qualities.",4,Improved from season 1,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,646,"['re-experiencing', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'animation', 'lip-synching', 'voice', 'acting', 'had', 'improved', 'bit', 'Kurt/Nightcrawler', 'favorite', 'element', 'series', 'also', 'enjoy', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'anime', 'style', 'drawings', 'interesting', 'situations', 'arise', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'lame', 'sometimes', 'other', 'times', 'effective', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'Rogue', 'friend', 'Risty', 'one', 'episodes', 'DVD.Overall', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'kids', 'show', 'there', 'got', 'redeeming', 'qualities']",X-Men: Evolution - Mutants Rising

734981,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B000087F7J,Mr. Bey,"[2, 4]",The first season of this show was where it started. The sceond season was when it started to get reall good. All of these episodes are good but i'm kinda getting bored with Badda-Bing Badda-Boom. Tabitha is a good charcter and she comes back to the institute in the third season. She leaves the brotherhood house when Mystique came back. She wasn't happy to learn that Avalanche had tried to join the X-men but she soon straightens them out. Power Surge focuses on Jean and her teleapthy problem. The team helps her get under control soon. This is a great bunch of episodes and i'm sad that the series was cancelled.

I found however that Evolution has done a nice job with the whole plot. These episodes were some of the better ones of the series, adding Boom-Boom to the story was a great idea (she is one of the lesser known very overlooked teen characters in the X-Men comic world) and her moments with Nightcrawler were priceless. I was also very happy to be able to find out  Wolfsbane (remade to look more human and less wolfish than she has been in the past) was one of the newest members of the evolution team.",4,High school isn't just normal anymore,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,661,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'older', 'FOX', 'X-Men', 'cartoon', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'little', 'taken', 'aback', 'idea', 'changing', 'nearly', 'X-Men', 'teenagers', 'found', 'however', 'Evolution', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'whole', 'plot', 'episodes', 'were', 'better', 'ones', 'series', 'adding', 'Boom-Boom', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'one', 'lesser', 'known', 'very', 'overlooked', 'teen', 'characters', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'world', 'moments', 'Nightcrawler', 'were', 'priceless', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'Wolfsbane', 'remade', 'look', 'more', 'human', 'less', 'wolfish', 'been', 'past', 'was', 'one', 'newest', 'members', 'evolution', 'team']",X-Men: Evolution - Mutants Rising
734983,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B000087F7J,Scott,"[0, 0]","Unfortunately, the WB is very poor at marketing DVDs for their animated series. This show is best viewed as a series, and it would have made more sense to simply come out with the entire second season on 1 DVD than simply throw a few episodes on a disc. That being said, if you can't wait for them to do that, I recommend grabbing this DVD. No extra features are included, but the show is one of the best comic book adapatations I've seen.",5,"Great show, so-so DVD",1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,439,"['Unfortunately', 'WB', 'very', 'poor', 'marketing', 'DVDs', 'animated', 'series', 'show', 'best', 'viewed', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'simply', 'come', 'out', 'entire', 'second', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'simply', 'throw', 'few', 'episodes', 'disc', 'being', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'recommend', 'grabbing', 'DVD', 'No', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adapatations', ""'ve"", 'seen']",X-Men: Evolution - Mutants Rising
