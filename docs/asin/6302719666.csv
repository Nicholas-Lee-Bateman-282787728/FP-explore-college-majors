It is a metaphoric tale about people frightened by their own choice of destiny; the style is as un-Russian as a film can get. Understatement is the word; you will not see overblown emotion or people making dramatic statements every step of their way. It is amazing that, ideologically, the director got away with the pictures of barbed wire and dereliction which looked distinctly like home to viewers in the Soviet Union. It is unbelievable that censors went so easy on a film with so many hidden meanings and without a clear-cut politically correct message. The film benefits from Kaydanovsky's very strong acting, it does not feel very long at all and flows beautifully. The tiny role of Stalker's wife, played by Alisa Freindlikh, a prominent Russian actress, is one of her best.Unfortunately, VHS version does not do justice to supremely soft, understated and subtle picture and cameraman's work. This is best revealed in cinema viewing. Nevertheless, definitely top-notch work.

329310,A4VH04TA14CPE,6302719666,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[25, 54]","Problem number one is that Tarkovsky's script is very wooden. In this film, characters with allegorical names like Writer and Scientist are liable to sit down while under threat of machine-gun fire and say ""How can I know what to call that which I want? How can I be certain that that which I want is really that which I want, and that I do not want that which I do not want?"" or gaze gloomily on a sand dune and say ""This is all someone's foolish invention, and you all want to find out whose. But whose conscience will ache from your discovery?"" or assert that ""There is no Bermuda Triangle. There is a triangle A-B-C which is congruent to a triangle A'-B'-C'."" This film is like that for most of its two and a half hours.Problem number two is that the symbolism used by Tarkovsky very frequently has no emotional effect. Consider, for example, the scene in which Writer takes a crown of thorns which conveniently happened to be lying on the floor of the room he was in, says ""I will not forgive you,"" and puts it on his head. First, this is too blatant, too dependent on the reference, to produce a great emotional reaction in the viewer. Second, the cynical, occasionally vulgar Writer is in no way like Christ. Nor is he that great an opposite of Christ, since he isn't particularly evil or demonic, either. The figure of Christ is irrelevant to his character, so the comparison can't really be made literally or ironically. Why, then, show him as Christ?Several times in this film, Tarkovsky shows a body of water with various objects floating in it. These include guns, books and religious icons. Now, Tarkovsky always liked to fill space with objects in order to induce a sort of organic or realistic atmosphere. For example, in his film Solaris, he filled the rooms of the cosmonauts with books, vases, ashes, and other objects. But in that film, it served to make the cosmonauts seem more like people, to give them outside interests, to maybe show their intellectual lives a little. Putting icons, books and guns into a river, on the other hand, accomplishes no such thing. Similarly gratuitous and unexplained is the image of Stalker throwing bolts tied to bandages in order to find the ""correct"" path through the ZONE. Regarding this, I recall an unintentionally funny quote said by some intellectual while viewing those scenes - ""That's _exactly_ what life is like in the Soviet Union!"" Indubitably!Another thing Tarkovsky likes to do is quote things. Here, passages are read out of the Bible, and poetry is quoted on two occasions. The problem is that scenes from the Apocalypse don't seem too relevant to the rest stop of the film's characters in a peaceful landscape. But even when these quotes are applicable to the situation depicted on the screen, they don't work - for example, a passionate love poem, designed to show the love Stalker's wife feels for her husband, is recited in a completely flat, droning monotone, devoid of feeling or even volume, that saps it of absolutely all of its vitality and fire and makes it tedious to listen to.Problem number three is the central philosophical conceit. Tarkovsky's big films (Andrei Rublev, Solaris and Stalker) are united in their borderline contempt of science and love of religion. The underlying message eventually comes down to the notion that one has to believe in god because otherwise one will never find happiness or achieve self-actualization. Of the three films, however, Stalker is by far the preachiest. Those who believed the talk about Stalker being a ""science-fiction epic"" should beware, since the science-fiction framework is used primarily to create analogies to religion. Here, god is represented by the magical Room at the heart of the Eden-like ZONE, from which people have been expelled. Writer and Scientist are the two unbelievers, whose lives are naturally vapid and meaningless due to their lack of belief. Scientist, as expected, is the worse of the two - he goes to the ZONE out of a desire to exact petty vengeance on a colleague, and wishes to destroy the ZONE - but both are fairly disagreeable. Stalker is the holy fool who believes in the magical powers of the Room and has a purpose in life. The unbelievers preach their nihilistic atheism to him, claiming that there is really no ZONE or Room, and depart to finish their meaningless and vapid lives. Stalker is filled with righteous anger at their lack of faith. Then the director steps in and shows Stalker's invalid daughter moving objects using telekinesis, thus showing that the ZONE is not a fiction after all. So Stalker is proven right and everyone else is proven wrong, because Tarkovsky said so. The debate is thus reduced to asking if there is a god with the premise that there is, and asking if one should believe in god with the premise that one will be unhappy and bitter if one does not. Well, then.To say the characters are unsympathetic is to miss the point, since the characters as people are unimportant - they are allegorical constructs used to advance the central philosophical conceit. Those who already adhere to this conceit will probably find something to like about this film, although I don't know if all of them will like sitting through all of it. Serious cinema scholars will doubtless have to see it once, due to the reputation Tarkovsky's work has accrued, but by doing so, they will be heading down a road where entertainment is the enemy, sermons fill the air, and accessibility lies dead on the wayside. I won't deride this film by calling it ""pointless,"" because Tarkovsky clearly had a point in mind, but I honestly do not see how it can be called a masterwork.",2,"Abandon hope, all ye who enter

One of the best works on ambient ever! Then I learned that this CD was inspired by Tarkovski's movie. So, when I moved to  the US, I was able to rented it. And what a journey! The movie is really an  experience of still, solitaire and moody landscapes, a story that should be  experienced instead of watched. The cinematography is dull, but fascinating  at the same time. The characters are terrific, a bit sinister and  captivating. The movie is strange in its own development, of still shots,  and lenghtly stop images.

And that's not just a cynical remark -- it really is. The same way that 'The Joy of Painting' is pleasant to fall asleep to; or the Japanese film 'Gate of Hell.' But those are far preferable to Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' when all is said and done.A &quot;visual poem&quot;? Perhaps. But what's it worth? Go outside, look around: there are visual poems everywhere. The only thing differentiating Tarkovsky's film from, say, me standing around looking at meadows and run-down buildings, is that Tarkovsky's film comes with a pretentious air of self-importance, and three relatively annoying characters who occasionally wax oblique and try to sound deep.It's not that I don't &quot;get it&quot; -- (although it is a bit of a struggle due to the general atmosphere of weird artsy-fartsiness.) It's supposed to be metaphorical. It's supposed to be contemplative and slow-moving. It isn't supposed to be a science fiction thriller (which the back of the box unfortunately makes it sound like.) And it's not that I'm utterly against slow-moving, metaphorical films. I liked Kurosawa's 'Dreams,' preachy as it was. And Kobayashi's 'Kwaidan.' And to a lesser extent the aforementioned 'Gate of Hell.' Though the last two are admittedly not really &quot;metaphorical&quot; in the sense that 'Stalker' is, all of them are very slow-moving, aesthetically spacious foreign movies that have a definite feel of &quot;visual poetry&quot; to them.The problem is that Tarkovsky is just flat-out boring and depressing. I can handle a degree of pretention if I feel there's some real flare and aesthetic power to the work in question. But Tarkovsky doesn't make the cut. What he gives us with 'Stalker' is a four-hour exercise in cinematographic (word?) masturbation, peppered with vague dialogue and a silly, throw-away outline of an actual story.Those who find 'Stalker' engaging or inspirationl must, in my opinion, REALLY be digging hard, doing Tarkovsky's work for him. I don't mind a film which requires some degree of imagination on the viewer's part, but there's nothing about Tarkovsky's work that makes me want to spend time with it in that way.Dull, pretentious, and silly. One or two vaguely thought-provoking lines can't save a four-hour film.

It reminds me most of Beckett's Waiting for Godot but it lacks the caliber of dialogue of that play.If Solaris seems ten times slower than any film you've seen before, Stalker seems ten times slower than Solaris. It takes full attention to remain with this film: anything that happens around you while you are watching, whether someone walking by or sneezing or a bird flying by outside, will seem considerably more interesting than the screen if you're not making an effort to stay with this movie.Some men in dark clothes on a dark day walk along a while, looking anguished. They pause and one says something perhaps profound like ""Life can be difficult but we somehow survive"". Closeup of another man looking down into some muddy water. Walk some more. Stop and one man says something equally profound, something like ""Stalking is all I know. I have not been able to stop."" Shot of a decripit factory. Walk some more. And so on.That's not just how Stalker goes or what was said but its how it basically felt. After two viewings, The Stalker seems like an interesting experiment but a probably unnecessarily challenging one. I'd expect well under 5% of the public would find it worthwhile.

329315,AERGIVLVUJAY4,6302719666,"C. J Millett ""movie critic and buff""","[15, 17]","I believe Andrei Tarkovsky once mentioned that his films were meant to touch the soul, rather than the intellect. Indeed, the ""grand"" experience of his works have a way of drifting into your subconcious and stir something inside if only you let them. The feelings that are achieved can lead to meaningful discussions (and thus the intellect) about life and, in the case of Stalker, that elusive search for happiness that consumes our lives.As is the case in all of Tarkovsky, 'Stalker' does not lend itself to virtually any of the cinema's plot convention, nor easy explanation, nor does it consider Box Office potential. In fact, it is a minor miracle that Tarkovsky was able to create films like this for over 20 years at all. He never found a wide audience in his native Russia, thriving only by independent means, and was eventually exiled. But back to the film:The world outside of ""The Zone"" is captured in an eerie faded black and white tint that recalls the silent era. The two characters who search for happiness (The Professor and The Writer) are led blindly through the dangerous outer perimeters of the Zone, which is closely guarded by the military. Perhaps not coincidentally, it feels we are in the aftermath of nuclear haulocaust. Mysterious trains seem to float through the fog, like ghost ships. They carry weapons and supplies, but no one is ever shown getting on or off. The music is subtle and strange, and comes and goes as eerily as the trains.When the characters finally enter the Zone, the screen fades into color to correspond to the ""sacredness"" and supposed ecstasy that this place promises. Tarkovsky often offers us an empty frame, a soft wind, as the characters drift through tall grass and trees, never quite sure what is around the next bend. The Stalker knows the place all too well, and knows that there are unseen traps that can spell death to the overconfident. The two other characters come to symbol our split conciousness: The Writer is brash and daring, always questioning what is ""right"" and never afraid to take risks to satisfy his curiousities; The Professor is quite and contemplative, content to go along with what is expected of him in order to come to a higher understanding (Though his true purpose becomes clear later on.)It would take several more paragraphs to go into the details of Tarkovsky's meaning through the film (And, in fact, I'm sure there is much I have yet to understand.)However, at it's center, this film is a meditation on the full meanings and complexities of happiness and the values of one's life. Toward the end, as the character return to the outside world, and the color fades back into blandness, there is a great moment of insight. Without giving it away, I'll just say that one of the most hopeful and moving moments captured on film occurs when the screen suddenly blazes with color once again at a moment of new awakening for one character. It justifies and reaffirms all that we have experienced along the way throughout this profound journey....",5,Taking another look at Tarkovsky,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,3027,"['believe', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'once', 'mentioned', 'films', 'were', 'meant', 'touch', 'soul', 'rather', 'intellect', 'Indeed', 'grand', 'experience', 'works', 'have', 'way', 'drifting', 'subconcious', 'stir', 'something', 'inside', 'only', 'let', 'feelings', 'are', 'achieved', 'can', 'lead', 'meaningful', 'discussions', 'thus', 'intellect', 'life', 'case', 'Stalker', 'elusive', 'search', 'happiness', 'lives.As', 'case', 'Tarkovsky', ""'Stalker"", 'not', 'lend', 'virtually', 'cinema', 'plot', 'convention', 'easy', 'explanation', 'consider', 'Box', 'Office', 'potential', 'fact', 'minor', 'miracle', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'films', '20', 'years', 'never', 'found', 'wide', 'audience', 'native', 'Russia', 'thriving', 'only', 'independent', 'means', 'was', 'eventually', 'exiled', 'back', 'film', 'world', 'Zone', 'captured', 'eerie', 'faded', 'black', 'white', 'tint', 'silent', 'era', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'search', 'happiness', 'Professor', 'Writer', 'are', 'led', 'blindly', 'dangerous', 'outer', 'perimeters', 'Zone', 'closely', 'guarded', 'military', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'are', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'haulocaust', 'Mysterious', 'trains', 'seem', 'float', 'fog', 'ghost', 'ships', 'carry', 'weapons', 'supplies', 'one', 'ever', 'shown', 'getting', 'music', 'subtle', 'strange', 'as', 'eerily', 'trains.When', 'characters', 'finally', 'enter', 'Zone', 'screen', 'color', 'correspond', 'sacredness', 'supposed', 'ecstasy', 'place', 'Tarkovsky', 'often', 'empty', 'frame', 'soft', 'wind', 'characters', 'drift', 'tall', 'grass', 'trees', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'next', 'bend', 'Stalker', 'place', 'too', 'well', 'are', 'unseen', 'traps', 'can', 'spell', 'death', 'overconfident', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'symbol', 'split', 'conciousness', 'Writer', 'brash', 'daring', 'always', 'questioning', 'what', 'right', 'never', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'satisfy', 'curiousities', 'Professor', 'quite', 'contemplative', 'content', 'go', 'along', 'what', 'expected', 'order', 'come', 'higher', 'understanding', 'true', 'purpose', 'becomes', 'clear', 'later', 'would', 'take', 'several', 'more', 'paragraphs', 'go', 'details', 'Tarkovsky', 'meaning', 'film', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'much', 'have', 'yet', 'understand', 'However', 'center', 'film', 'meditation', 'full', 'meanings', 'complexities', 'happiness', 'values', 'one', 'life', 'end', 'character', 'return', 'outside', 'world', 'color', 'back', 'blandness', 'great', 'moment', 'insight', 'giving', 'away', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'hopeful', 'moving', 'moments', 'captured', 'film', 'occurs', 'when', 'screen', 'suddenly', 'color', 'once', 'again', 'moment', 'new', 'awakening', 'one', 'character', 'have', 'experienced', 'way', 'profound', 'journey']",Stalker VHS

It doesn't really conform to any of the set standards for cinema. The average shot length is over a minute (whereas nowadays it's around 4 seconds). The film has a premise, but no real plot, story, or narrative. It certainly lacks a happy ending, or a digestible ending for that matter. Stalker could best be described as a cross between Dostoevsky's philosophy and Ingmar Bergman's visuals. Thankfully, it's the best and most entrancing of each world. The film's three primary characters, the stalker, the writer, and the professor, interact and contrast in such an abstract yet understandable way, holding in their musings Stalker's complete human appeal. Their journey into 'the zone' makes for an excellent primer and acts as a metaphorical journey into their truest human thoughts and feelings. The film is remarkable as a rumination of human suffering, but even more incredible as a visual and sonic work of art. Moving from a sepia-toned wasteland to an earthy, mystical setting (very much in a Wizard of Oz fashion), Stalker is always off-putting and haunting in the most artistic and rewarding way. Tarkovsky's long and seamless takes lend a real-time quality to the meditation of both picture and sound. The soundtrack by Eduard Artemyev is debatably just as important as Tarkovsky's visuals. This is true in that the film would be drastically altered if either aspect was tampered with. The natural sounds and the soundtrack are so fused that the viewer often loses track of what is real and what is synthetic, adding immensely to the film's transcendental quality. The work from the three main characters and the stalker's wife cannot be understated. Without their realistic and contemplative performances, Stalker might be nothing but pretty pictures and sounds. So much more can be said about the film, but a loss of words seems like a response Tarkovsky was trying to elicit. Repeated viewing is a must for this masterpiece.",5,Spiritual Meditation,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2028,"[""'More"", 'experience', 'movie', 'applied', 'one', 'film', 'Stalker', 'probably', ""n't"", 'really', 'conform', 'set', 'standards', 'cinema', 'average', 'shot', 'length', 'minute', 'whereas', 'around', '4', 'seconds', 'film', 'premise', 'real', 'plot', 'story', 'narrative', 'certainly', 'happy', 'ending', 'digestible', 'ending', 'matter', 'Stalker', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'cross', 'Dostoevsky', 'philosophy', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'visuals', 'Thankfully', 'best', 'most', 'entrancing', 'world', 'film', 'three', 'primary', 'characters', 'stalker', 'writer', 'professor', 'interact', 'contrast', 'such', 'abstract', 'yet', 'understandable', 'way', 'holding', 'musings', 'Stalker', 'complete', 'human', 'appeal', 'journey', ""'the"", 'zone', 'excellent', 'primer', 'metaphorical', 'journey', 'truest', 'human', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'film', 'remarkable', 'rumination', 'human', 'suffering', 'even', 'more', 'incredible', 'visual', 'sonic', 'work', 'art', 'Moving', 'sepia-toned', 'wasteland', 'earthy', 'mystical', 'setting', 'very', 'much', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'fashion', 'Stalker', 'always', 'off-putting', 'haunting', 'most', 'artistic', 'rewarding', 'way', 'Tarkovsky', 'long', 'seamless', 'lend', 'real-time', 'quality', 'meditation', 'picture', 'sound', 'soundtrack', 'Eduard', 'Artemyev', 'debatably', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'Tarkovsky', 'visuals', 'true', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'drastically', 'altered', 'aspect', 'was', 'tampered', 'natural', 'sounds', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'so', 'fused', 'viewer', 'often', 'track', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'synthetic', 'adding', 'immensely', 'film', 'transcendental', 'quality', 'work', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'stalker', 'wife', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understated', 'realistic', 'contemplative', 'performances', 'Stalker', 'might', 'be', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'sounds', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'loss', 'words', 'response', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', 'trying', 'elicit', 'Repeated', 'viewing', 'must', 'masterpiece']",Stalker VHS
329317,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6302719666,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 7]","Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker (''''''') is not the great nor masterful film its most ardent critical supporters proclaim, nor is it the slow, boring Eurotrash that its most vocal critics counterclaim. It lies somewhere in between- a film that risks and occasionally fails, although it is far closer to greatness than trash. That's because Tarkovsky has crafted a film of unusual visuals with even more unusual power. There are scenes that recall the old telefilm The Lathe Of Heaven, released the same year as this film, 1979; Carl Theodor Dreyer's great Vampyr, in its use of shadows and fog; the 1976 sci fi classic Logan's Run, in that the three leads of the film are running away from their society; Tarkovsky's earlier Solaris, in its mix of color and sepia images; and, most of all, with Alex Proyas' 1998 sci fi classic Dark City, which, like Stalker, creates a wholly believable alternate world unlike any other put on screen. Visually, Stalker most reminds me of the human portraits of the great Austrian painter Egon Schiele, with its myriad of gaunt, pallid, balding, dirty, twisted characters.But, as in most Tarkovsky films, it is not the visuals that dominate, rather the philosophic depth of the characters. What they don't say or dream is almost always as important as what they do say and dream. Stalker succeeds because its ellipses are more brilliant than its fodder. Stalker misses greatness, however, because its fodder some times fails.... Of course, there are the usual misreadings by critics, who praise the very things that do not work- like the ending, or imbue their own interpretations of Stalker as a Christ-like figure (his being a religious character makes him no stand-in for a religious figure), when the film is surprisingly shorn of any religious mumbo jumbo (humanist philosophy and religion are not analogues), and the three lead characters are in no way merely symbols- of Christian Wise Men, the Trinity, nor any tripartite invocation. Do they bear some symbolism? Of course, since they are known only by their professions. But, each is a unique character, not a caricaturization. Thus, Stalker achieves a rare intimacy in film, one absent from most films, Hollywood or foreign, and if not a great film, certainly it is an excellent film, and one of the most unique visions committed to screen. See for yourself how even failure can fail better than most.",4,Good,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2401,"['Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', '1979', 'film', 'Stalker', 'not', 'great', 'masterful', 'film', 'most', 'ardent', 'critical', 'supporters', 'proclaim', 'slow', 'boring', 'Eurotrash', 'most', 'vocal', 'critics', 'counterclaim', 'somewhere', 'between-', 'film', 'risks', 'occasionally', 'fails', 'far', 'closer', 'greatness', 'trash', 'because', 'Tarkovsky', 'crafted', 'film', 'unusual', 'visuals', 'even', 'more', 'unusual', 'power', 'are', 'scenes', 'recall', 'old', 'telefilm', 'Lathe', 'Heaven', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'film', '1979', 'Carl', 'Theodor', 'Dreyer', 'great', 'Vampyr', 'use', 'shadows', 'fog', '1976', 'sci', 'fi', 'classic', 'Logan', 'Run', 'three', 'leads', 'film', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'society', 'Tarkovsky', 'earlier', 'Solaris', 'mix', 'color', 'sepia', 'images', 'most', 'Alex', 'Proyas', '1998', 'sci', 'fi', 'classic', 'Dark', 'City', 'Stalker', 'wholly', 'believable', 'alternate', 'world', 'other', 'put', 'screen', 'Visually', 'Stalker', 'most', 'reminds', 'human', 'portraits', 'great', 'Austrian', 'painter', 'Egon', 'Schiele', 'myriad', 'gaunt', 'pallid', 'balding', 'dirty', 'twisted', 'characters.But', 'most', 'Tarkovsky', 'films', 'not', 'visuals', 'dominate', 'rather', 'philosophic', 'depth', 'characters', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'dream', 'almost', 'always', 'as', 'important', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'dream', 'Stalker', 'ellipses', 'are', 'more', 'brilliant', 'fodder', 'Stalker', 'greatness', 'however', 'fodder', 'times', 'fails', 'course', 'are', 'usual', 'misreadings', 'critics', 'who', 'praise', 'very', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'work-', 'ending', 'imbue', 'own', 'interpretations', 'Stalker', 'Christ-like', 'figure', 'being', 'religious', 'character', 'stand-in', 'religious', 'figure', 'when', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'shorn', 'religious', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'humanist', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'are', 'not', 'analogues', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'merely', 'symbols-', 'Christian', 'Wise', 'Men', 'Trinity', 'tripartite', 'invocation', 'Do', 'bear', 'symbolism', 'course', 'are', 'known', 'only', 'professions', 'unique', 'character', 'not', 'caricaturization', 'Thus', 'Stalker', 'rare', 'intimacy', 'film', 'one', 'absent', 'most', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'foreign', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'visions', 'committed', 'screen', 'See', 'how', 'even', 'failure', 'can', 'fail', 'better', 'most']",Stalker VHS
329318,A2G5HYJO4L3K86,6302719666,"David McNally ""wild rover""","[3, 5]","Like Solaris - to which this could form a neat earth-bound companion piece - Stalker turns sci-fi conventions on their heads by insisting that our reactions to an alien intelligence may be more interesting than the alien culture itself. But this is where Tarkovsky's insistence ends; his refusal to promote one fixed point of view leaves it up to the viewer to judge the merits of these reactions. It's his provocative ambilvalence which makes him maddening to some and challenging to others. If nothing else, his films provide an antidote to the almost Wagnerian bombast of Hollywood - even the most modest romantic comedy costs $30 mil plus these days, while Stalker looks as if it was made for 2 bob. But if going to see a big-budget blockbuster is like being strapped into a rollercoaster, watching Stalker is more akin to taking your mind and soul for a punishing session at the gym, followed by an eye-wateringly cold shower. Not your idea of fun? Then stay away.Short on dialogue but long on ideas and lingering images, Stalker tells the story of a Stalker (directly if meaninglessly translated from the Russian) whose job involves smuggling people into 'the Zone' - site of an alien landing which has been sealed off by the military (the country, like the date, is non-specific leaving even more blanks to be filled in). Weary but still evangelical, he shepards a writer and a professor who are willing to risk their lives in order to find out what the Zone has to offer, and the majority of the film tracks their laborious progress. I dont think it would be giving too much away to say that they never quite find what they are looking for (it being Tarkovsky after all; thank God he died before the concept of 'closure' became common currency, his head would have exploded!). Indeed, this film was pitched at me as being about 'some guys who want to get to this place, and they dont know why they're going and they never get there'! To say that the journey is more important than the end point would be simplifying things a little, as well as ignoring the fact that they never quite reach an end-point. This allows the movie -and the ideas behind it - to live on in your mind long after the film ends...I sometimes catch myself thinking about the Zone at odd moments. And yes I do have a full time job and a family!If you think this all seems a bit internal and philosophical, you'd only be half-right. There are startling moments of action and a major plot point involving that old dramatic stand-by, the cuckolded husband. Tarkovsky makes these moments co-exist with the weightier aspects without comment,and by the end you feel emotionally as well as intellectually involved. Some might say that he regarded emotions every bit as ridiculous as pompous philosophical musings, but I think the final scene -as ambiguous a closing shot as Solaris's - presents yet another aspect and stops the viewer from parsing Stalker and prescribing nihilism.

The film mostly takes from the last chapter of the novel when Redrick and a boy enter the Zone, only in the movie it is three men who enter the Zone together. The Zone is a region of alien refuse that contains things that are beyond our understanding and are a source of danger and power. The Stalkers are individuals who enter the Zone in order to retrieve alien technology, or safely lead people through the dangerous terrain. The ultimate trophy in the Zone is a device rumored to grant a person's most deep seated wish. Tarkovsky takes us through an amazing terrain of abandoned factories, fields of destroyed tanks, and subterranean tunnels all the while leading us through the psyche and thoughts of the three men on this journey. It is a beautifully haunting journey on the intersection of science, morality, imagination, faith, and skeptism.This special two disc DVD set has the movie on one disc, and special features, including interviews, on another.

Agony is the word that describes this Odyssey, the agony of the soul to salvation through a  journey that will alter the three heros forever. Dont try to interpret this  film, dreams cannot be interpreted. They just leave a feeling to your  tongue after you wake up that you forget moments after. STALKER reaches the  point of the ontological question: Who are we, were do we come from and  what is our destination. It does not give answers, that is impossible, but  it describes this unfair struggle.The film is not divided in scenes or  acts or anything else. It is a collective flow of the human spirit. It is  one act that flows in slow motion because Tarkovsky's notion of time is  completely different than the conventonal one. The time and space inside  the ZONE are badly distorted by the presence of the subconscious of the  three heros, in the same way that space and time are distorted in the  universe by the presence of mass. Tarkovsky manages to visualize this  strange coupling between the human soul and nature through his brilliant  invention of the invinsble &quot;traps&quot; inside the ZONE.The images  that are depicted on the film are greater than life. Tarkovsky's  achievement is unique. It is like the child that pretends that his bed is a  spaceship and travels across the universe without ever leaving its room.  This is the same &quot;ROOM&quot; inside the ZONE.

Villagers travelled through this curious area, now known  as The Zone, and disappeared. Stories purport that there is an inner  chamber within the Zone, The Room, that grants one's deepest wish.  Fearing the consequences from such an inscrutible resource, the army  immediately secured the area with barbed wire and armed patrol. But  the desperate and the suffering continue to make the treacherous  journey, led by a disciplined, experienced stalker who can stealthily  navigate through the constantly changing traps and pitfalls of the Zone. A  successful Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), perhaps searching for inspiration  or adventure, and a Scientist (Nikolai Grinko) searching for Truth, enlist  the Stalker (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to guide them through The Zone.  The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine,  who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone  and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is  evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the  uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold  to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their  answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.&quot;Stalker&quot; is a visually serene, highly metaphoric, and deeply haunting  treatise on the essence of the soul. Episodically, Andrei Tarkovsky uses  chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and The Zone.  Thematically, as in &quot;Solaris&quot;, the transition serves as an oneiric device to  separate physical reality from the subconscious. The created barriers  and imposed laws of the outside world parallel the Stalker's incoherent  tracking methods for reaching The Room. Note that despite the  Stalker's warning not to use the same path twice, the Scientist returns to  retrieve his knapsack unharmed, casting doubt on the Stalker's  navigational rules. Symbolically, it is as if the subconscious is in denial of  its sincerest wish, creating its own boundaries and impediments to  prevent its realization. After a circuitous route, the men arrive at the  antechamber to The Room, hesitant to proceed, unable to define their  innermost wish: their spiritual longing. The floor is strewn with coins,  hypodermic needles, weapons, and religious icons: a reflection of the  mind's search for escape from its misery. In the end, The Zone's real or  imagined powers proves to be inconsequential to the weary, ambivalent  seekers.

329326,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,6302719666,Gary,"[6, 28]","Much as I love Tarkovsky, and I deeply love three of his movies, I really hate this one. It is boring and silly. In fact it could well lay claim to be the most boring film ever made. The script is nothing much and the usual device of poems seems forced this time. First cringe is the transition from sepia to colour upon entering the zone thus conjuring unfavourable comparisans to 'The Wizard Of Oz'. Unfortunately, the Stalker's wife does not enliven the proceedings with her version of 'Over The Rainbow', deciding instead to roll around the floor of her hovel with belly ache. Originally, the producers of 'Oz' left out that song because they didn't want to delay Dorothy's journey. In 'Stalker' they don't much care if the protagonists are held up or if they don't move at all, so a song might have been nice. Actually, some Can-Can dancers would have been especially welcome.Once in the zone, our three cheerful chums do pretty much what we all did around derelict building sites and forests as a kid, which is to bicker, roll around on the floor and chuck metal objects at each other. Thanks for the nostalgia trip. Well, maybe not. Someone chucks something into a steel well. Plink. Remember that too? They find a skeleton and this reminds me of an amusing production anecdote in which a newly arrived crew member on the set either sat on, or placed something on the skeleton, squashing it. The budget didn't extend to making a new skeleton so the poor crew member was dispatched to the railway station, presumably for a very drawn out and excrutiatingly boring wait for a rural train. Tarkovsky later relented however, true humanitarian that he was. Actually, it's not that amusing an anecdote, I'm just worried this review is getting boring. Which it is. So to make things even more boring we only get to see half a skeleton because of the damage. Pity, they could have tied some string to the original and had it do Stanislavski's greatest hits, or failing that, the Can-Can.Tarkovsky railed against the lack of sacrifice people were willing to make in today's materialist culture but the long walk through the catacombs of the building betrays an almost priggish sadism, especially as the writer doing the walking then sits down for ten minutes and whinges about his publishers. Then in one of many naff moments, the writer wears a crown of thorns presumably because he doesn't want to be beaten by the Stalker in a 'Baldest on Building Site' competition. Sadly this man has the unfortunate distinction of being the least disappearing visitor to the zone, thus, to our ultimate existential horror, returning to the outside world to bore some more.The one saving grace is the intriguing and beautifully shot ending which bumps up some much needed stars for the film.Incredibly, 'Stalker' was a remake, the original version allegedly spoiled by obstructive lab technicians. Or could it be that God was trying to tell you something, Andrei? After all, if he'd put us on the earth to be bored out of our minds, would he have given us Formula One racing driving? Actually, I can't stand that either, bad example.On a sadder note, it was speculated that this film caused Tarkovsky and some of the crew to suffer an early demise from cancer because of the Communist block's disastrous environmental policies concerning industrial waste of which 'The Zone' was an alleged dumping ground.",2,"Sorry Andrei, wherever you are, this is horrible!",1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,3391,"['Much', 'love', 'Tarkovsky', 'deeply', 'love', 'three', 'movies', 'really', 'hate', 'one', 'boring', 'silly', 'fact', 'could', 'well', 'lay', 'claim', 'be', 'most', 'boring', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'script', 'nothing', 'much', 'usual', 'device', 'poems', 'forced', 'time', 'First', 'cringe', 'transition', 'sepia', 'colour', 'entering', 'zone', 'thus', 'conjuring', 'unfavourable', 'comparisans', ""'The"", 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Unfortunately', 'Stalker', 'wife', 'not', 'enliven', 'proceedings', 'version', ""'Over"", 'Rainbow', 'deciding', 'instead', 'roll', 'around', 'floor', 'hovel', 'belly', 'ache', 'Originally', 'producers', ""'Oz"", 'left', 'out', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'delay', 'Dorothy', 'journey', ""'Stalker"", 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'protagonists', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'song', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Actually', 'Can-Can', 'dancers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'especially', 'welcome.Once', 'zone', 'three', 'cheerful', 'chums', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'did', 'around', 'derelict', 'building', 'sites', 'forests', 'kid', 'bicker', 'roll', 'around', 'floor', 'chuck', 'metal', 'objects', 'other', 'Thanks', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'Someone', 'something', 'steel', 'well', 'Plink', 'Remember', 'too', 'find', 'skeleton', 'amusing', 'production', 'anecdote', 'newly', 'arrived', 'crew', 'member', 'set', 'sat', 'placed', 'something', 'skeleton', 'squashing', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'extend', 'making', 'new', 'skeleton', 'poor', 'crew', 'member', 'was', 'dispatched', 'railway', 'station', 'presumably', 'very', 'drawn', 'out', 'excrutiatingly', 'boring', 'wait', 'rural', 'train', 'Tarkovsky', 'later', 'relented', 'however', 'true', 'humanitarian', 'was', 'Actually', 'not', 'amusing', 'anecdote', ""'m"", 'just', 'worried', 'review', 'getting', 'boring', 'So', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'boring', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'skeleton', 'damage', 'Pity', 'could', 'have', 'tied', 'string', 'original', 'had', 'do', 'Stanislavski', 'greatest', 'hits', 'failing', 'Can-Can.Tarkovsky', 'railed', 'lack', 'sacrifice', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'make', 'today', 'materialist', 'culture', 'long', 'walk', 'catacombs', 'building', 'almost', 'priggish', 'sadism', 'especially', 'writer', 'doing', 'walking', 'then', 'down', 'ten', 'minutes', 'whinges', 'publishers', 'Then', 'one', 'many', 'naff', 'moments', 'writer', 'crown', 'thorns', 'presumably', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'beaten', 'Stalker', ""'Baldest"", 'Building', 'Site', 'competition', 'Sadly', 'man', 'unfortunate', 'distinction', 'being', 'least', 'disappearing', 'visitor', 'zone', 'thus', 'ultimate', 'existential', 'horror', 'returning', 'outside', 'world', 'bore', 'more.The', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'intriguing', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'ending', 'up', 'much', 'needed', 'stars', 'film.Incredibly', ""'Stalker"", 'was', 'remake', 'original', 'version', 'allegedly', 'spoiled', 'obstructive', 'lab', 'technicians', 'could', 'be', 'God', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'something', 'Andrei', ""'d"", 'put', 'earth', 'be', 'bored', 'minds', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Formula', 'One', 'racing', 'driving', 'Actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'bad', 'example.On', 'sadder', 'note', 'was', 'speculated', 'film', 'caused', 'Tarkovsky', 'crew', 'suffer', 'early', 'demise', 'cancer', 'Communist', 'block', 'disastrous', 'environmental', 'policies', 'concerning', 'industrial', 'waste', ""'The"", 'Zone', 'was', 'alleged', 'dumping', 'ground']",Stalker VHS

It's arguably Tarkovsky's best film (and the last one he made completely under the auspices of the USSR), and a film that gets inside your head and your soul. The plot is rather simple.  An alien force lands on Earth, and then leaves. The area where they landed is a vast wasteland where the laws of physics are suspended.  It's been dubbed the zone (or 3OHA in Russian). A stalker (not the current definition), a writer, and a professor venture into the zone, where there is a room that will grant you your most inner wishes. Now, it's not what you ask for, it's what you really desire. The room reads into your soul. This is a very slow, cerebral movie (it wouldn't be a Tarkovsky movie otherwise), but it has to be seen many times to fully comprehend it.  I love Stalker's ""dream"" sequence, which has one of the most amazing shots I've ever seen in cinema. The ending is really exceptional as well. I have seen Stalker at least 10 times, and I can see 10 more. It was a difficult shoot (Tarkovsky had to stop shooting because there was a defect in the film stock he was using. He had to reshoot from scratch, essentially), yet, it is Tarkovsky's greatest film along with Solaris and Andrei Rublev. When you watch it, make sure that you choose the original mono soundtrack. The DVD company, RUSCICO, remixed the soundtrack to 5.1 dolby, but they ADDED sound to the original film, including music during the ride to the zone (which originally only had dialogue and the sound of the trolley car).

This is either dystopian or just marooned banter in the lives of very worried people. The film gave me an almost 1984'ish vibe. The film is largely about the ides of life and society and a major part of it takes place in the form of CONVERSATIONS between the three. The professor, the writer and the stalker.I didn't like that it is made in a very ambiguous morose style. Yes, I understand the intention of the director of a poor wet sodden world and slow moving cameras over objects destroyed by water. I am not even lost in translation but by the end of 2/3rds of the film i couldn't help but want it to finish already. It is long and it is slow as burden, I feel a film can be slow but it shouldn't make the viewer think it is slow.The Stalker is one of those slow films which you either love or you hate. I regret watching it and the high ranking is the reason I messed with it in the first place.What I found was a confusing long drawn out dialog between three under achievers who seek the meaning of something? Their own ineptness. But somehow the film didn't muster enough confidence and even halfway through the film the characters seemed vague and as complete strangers to me.I wish the film was explained better, I wish I knew the language it was made in, perhaps then I would look at it differently, there is way too much dialogue and I wish there was a monologue to events. 8 years before the Stalker Kubrick did A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and yet THE STALKER seems way older and entirely helpless in comparison.

The riddle is a very complex puzzle ; but Tarkovsky gives you the clues , but beware with certain requisites you need .Think for instance in The divine comedy and go to the hell journey ; that film has too many devices that run parallel to this concept . Remember the intense dialogue in the last circle of the hell when in his exhaustive seeking for Beatriz he is forced to see the face of a monster consuming men ; he will have to face the monster face to face and he will watch a sad face with tears in its eyes .The Zone is a very special place ; there is a desire room which only will give you your most sincere desire ; and that premise is clearly hazardous ; because it is going to reveal your real nature and for many people who still scare to their inner demons is really better deny this challenging proposal .The crudeness and the overwhelming message against the political opressing in those ages in the ancient USSR meant to Andrei Tarkovsky was exiled from his beloved country . You know ; the Politburo patient reached the limit and this collosal , giant , intelligent and artistic work crossed the forbidden red line. The art , intelligence and the talent have always been subversive in totalitarian regimes .

329337,A3DU3WOGW4A9QH,6302719666,"jammer ""jammmer""","[17, 36]","This reviewer would normally not review a film which already has so many reviews, except these reviews reveal so much ignorance of film's original ""source:""  ""Roadside Picnic"" (Macmillan 1st US printing 1977; or Pocketbooks, 1st US printing 1978, by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky).  For those fortunate enough to have read this 55,000-word novella, be advised that despite the Strugatskys' involvement, Tarkovsky's film bears at most a cursory resemblance, being an interminably dull and pretentious work masquerading as a sort-of inconsistent sequel, all the original work's brilliance, philosophical musings, concepts, and entertainment value being gutted.  The sparse skeletal remains are then buried in Tarkovsky spouting piles of his personal-style irrelevant philosophical and metaphysical manure, with a milquetoast ""zone"" thrown in, and an ending dash of gratuitous pseudo-science which is absolutely inimical to the original work's concepts.  But you be the judge.  Bear in mind that the film barely or never even MENTIONS most of the items or concepts discussed below, much less showing them IN ACTION!""Roadside Picnic"" (engagingly-translated into modern English vernacular) is arguably among the twenty or so most brilliantly conceived, yet scientifically plausible science fiction novels (or novellas) ever written.  Stanislaw Lem (who wrote ""Solaris"", another such entry) felt sufficiently moved by this work to write a 13000 word essay, ""About the Strugatskys' Roadside Picnic."", published in his ""Microworlds,"" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1st edition, 1984).  Prospective readers of the story might read Lem's essay first, since it contributes to a better understanding and enjoyment of that work's depth and sheer originality.Imagine six objects, perhaps a six-part procession of one object, approaching earth from inter-stellar space on a radiant passing through the star Deneb, the impact pattern caused by earth's rotation.  Such an event happened twenty-some years prior to the near-future events imagined in ""Roadside Picnic.""  The six ""meteorites"" had deadly effects immediately upon impact, and in the years following, to anything within the resultant multi-square-mile impact Zones, later postulated as alien Visitation sites.A global UN ""institute"" was established to study these Zones, maintaining adjacent research centers, controlling and overseeing all legal access.  These centers hire free-lance ""stalkers"": experienced dare-devils with instinctual Zone survival ability and willing to risk their skins and genetics to legally enter the Zones, survive the hazards, and retrieve for scientific study alien artifacts of incalculable value.  Significant profits reward such stalkers, though some is frittered away in bribes, fines, illicit dealings, drink and carousing.  Usually aided by darkness, there is even more profitable entrepreneurial business in ""swag:"" illegally recovered Zone artifacts for a rampant world-wide black market.The story occurs at a Canadian Zone from the perspective of stalker ""Red"" Schuhart.  While a Zone's perimeter can be freely crossed, illegal sorties must elude not only the Zone's inner hazards, but also the institute's perimeter patrols.  Red's notoriety as an ""extra-curricular"" swag trafficker exemplar simultaneously creates demands for his illegal services, and also results in jail time and constant harassment by those who know damn well what he does but are usually unable to catch him red-handed.The Zone's inner hazards are confined within its perimeter and include such as burning fluff; witches jelly - a highly proscribed, very dense and toxic colloidal gas that converts anything it touches into witches jelly (naturally some gets smuggled out!); hairy black ""cotton"" - a lethal mossy-like growth on such as abandoned TV antennas, desirable to study, but so inimical it cannot even be approached for samples; mosquito mange - intensely deadly and invisible gravitational anomalies - hence the throwing of nuts for detection; silvery webs that induce heart attacks; quasi-""alive"" yet invisible disturbances that ""creep"" about, detectable only by light-refractive properties; searing heat traps; pseudo intelligent electrical strikes; something called the ""meatgrinder"" - describing its effects on unwary stalkers; and numerous other hazards.  In the story, the stalkers interact with all these hazards on practically every visit.  Several stalker fatalities occur front and center, dozens more occur ""off-stage.""Other effects like genetic defects and apparent violations of the laws of causality and of the first and second laws of Thermodynamics can be exported from the Zone through one's presence during the original Visitation time, through subsequent visits to the Zone, or by artifacts removed from the Zone:  ""empties"" - containers of some sort whose structure defies known physics; ""full empties; ""so-so"" self-reproductive and eternal batteries used to power cars, an example of incomprehensible alien technology applied outside the Zone; itchers - gadgets that wreck psychological havoc over a given area; black sprays - surmised to be vast expanses of space curled into marble-sized spheres in our dimensional space; zombies or ""moulages,"" - non-earthly-fleshy reconstructions on skeletons of pre-Visitation graveyard corpses with surprising physiological effects on those that harbor them; and of course the Golden Ball - naively and mythically rumored to grant anyone their innermost desires.If looking for philosophy which actually relates to the story, and which exposes the film's pretentious, preachy and irrelevant discourses, consider Chapter 3's extended discussion between Dr. Pilman and Richard Noonan concerning the incomprehensibilities and mysteriousness of the aliens and their technology.  Dr. Pilman also elaborates on the many Zone hypotheses, one such being to imagine how the remains from a roadside picnic might later appear to the local wildlife: an inexplicable collection of items like bread crumbs, raisins, apple cores, orange peels, meat scraps, candy; then perhaps a forgotten child's toy, a wrench, some pennies, marbles,  someone's nail-clippers, faded nursery flowers;  but then also hazards like cigarette butts, lye cleaner crystals, kerosene spills, a still-burning charcoal campfire, an opened boric acid container, several mothballs or snail pellets, insecticide spray residuals.  Now imagine that we are the local wildlife.  There are, of course, other hypothetical scenarios.In Tarkovsky's Solaris, the intent to remain basically faithful to the concepts of the original work seems clear, albeit with understandably limited special effects.  As is shown above, in ""Stalker,"" arguably not even the basics of the original work survive.",2,This is no Roadside Picnic,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,6758,"['reviewer', 'would', 'normally', 'not',

329338,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,6302719666,Jeremy Storly,"[5, 6]","Have you ever been so entranced by a work of art that you can hardly stop gazing at it?  I remember the first time this happened to me was when I was very young and saw an image of Picasso's _Guernica_ in a second-grade textbook.  I didn't want to turn the page; I just kept looking, taking it all in.  Even though I couldn't have expressed myself in words, I felt a deep emotional response, an appreciation for his work that required my total involvement with the image.Every single frame in _Stalker_ is so carefully and cleverly composed that it elicits such a response.  Sometimes we hardly know what we are looking at, we can't understand it, but what we are seeing is absorbing, often dreamlike.  Tarkovsky has a reverence for his work that is seldom found in film-making, eschewing the sensational and embracing the heartfelt, so that even a blade of grass or a drop of water seems to possess a significance in his world, and even the supernatural can seem very natural.  But, of course a mysterious alien presence could create the Zone.  But, of course you can't go back the way you came (nobody does).  But, of course a room can grant your deepest wish.  But, of course a bandage tied to a nut can guide your way.  After even a single viewing, the viewer recalls scenes from _Stalker_ in much the same way that one remembers sequences from a dream.  Tarkovsky involves the viewer to the point that his world becomes a part of our world in the same way that our sleeping world becomes a part of our waking life.  And isn't this the sign of a great artist: that his work follows us?Tarkovsky was the kind of artist that later film-makers like Tarantino and Luhrmann rebelled against.  His work is scene-driven and character-driven, not action-driven, and it requires a thoughtful involvement on the part of the viewer.  Just as only certain people can be led into the Zone, it is sad to think that many viewers today may not have the patience required to appreciate such a film.

329340,A22AL5CB23F2SK,6302719666,"Karran ""karran_s""","[0, 1]","I first saw ""Stalker"" nearly 20 years ago with a bunch of friends. The video was a little grainy and no one in the room had the slightest idea what the movie was about, except that it was a Russian film. Within the first 20 mins of the film, most of my friends had drifted to start a poker game, showing little or no interest on what was happening on screen, except for two of us, who were mesmerized with the film, admiring not only the visuals, which were stark and devoid of cinematic effects, but also the ideas that were being exchanged by the film's three central characters - the ""Stalker"", the Writer and the Professor. Just based on this one incident, this is a movie that demands a certain level of introspection as well as acute concentration and involvement, especially to understand where Tarkovsky is leading the viewer and his deep philosophical expositions through his characters on the ultimate fate of ""humankind"". There is a certain statement in the film on the ultimate use of technology, its limitations and its inability to ultimately create something of lasting value. As one of its characters [ ""Writer""] explains, technology has served mankind as a kind of ""crutch"" or artifical prop, but with no lasting value, from an artistic or creative point of view. Also, in the ""Zone"", a mysterious place that seems innocuous visually and presents life amidst decay and detritus [human detritus, left behind by man, ranging from burnt out tanks in green fields to a syringe ], nothing is certain, nothing is ""straight"" and there's no logic to be found here. Only the ""Stalker"" knows his way around the Zone and not by any knowledge of the terrain or his prior forays into the Zone but an immediate, real time assessment of his own state of mind, his internal communication with the mysterious forces acting in the Zone. The ""ultimate"" room is a mental construct of sorts and is actually a dreadful place ultimately for most people, although it supposedly grants people their innermost wishes. In a simplistic way, this is the ""Holy Grail"" for most people, a place where they can get their most secret desires and wishes granted. However, the interesting question being posed here is - does anyone really know or is anyone really interested in having their innermost desires or wishes granted. There is a certain dark truth here that most individuals would actually be better off if such a place did not exist and their innermost desires may actually not be what they are really wishing for. Human beings are complex, selfish and ultimately, self-serving. It is impossible for Tarkovsky to comprehend that any one person can be totally unselfish in his desires. That is his view and I would tend to agree. People are ultimately going to act in their own interests, or in the interests of their family or other things that they are concerned with. No one is going to act for humankind, an altruistic view that has no basis in reality. Witness the Stalker's story in this regard regarding a character called ""Porcupine"", another stalker who killed his brother. He enters the Zone hoping to restore a life and ease his anguish and guilt by entering the mysterious room and asking for his wish to be granted. And what was this wish, you may well ask ? Why , to restore his brother to life and good health and assuage his feelings, bring him peace. Or, to just wipe away the guilt. However, the Zone recognized the real scoundrel that he really was and granted him his innermost, secret desire - to be really wealthy. Fabulously wealthy as soon as he returned from the Zone, he was tortured by guilt and committed suicide within the week. Moral of the story - do you really, really, want to know your innermost desires ? This assumes that in the first place, is anyone really capable of articulating his/her innermost desires ? People are shallow individuals, focused on their own interests and live on the surface. I'm not too sure that anyone can ""know"" what their innermost desires are ? Second, what if you do manage to discover what your desires really are - if they are really deep, dark and disgusting, can you really live with yourself once you become aware of them ? Lastly, who would ever want to have their desires fulfilled, if they were not in the right place to start with ?All in all, a deep philosophical movie that draws you into the ""Zone"" and never lets you go.",5,Thought-provoking movie about humankind,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,4390,"['first', 'saw', 'Stalker', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'bunch', 'friends', 'video', 'was', 'little', 'grainy', 'one', 'room', 'had', 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'Russian', 'film', 'first', '20', 'mins', 'film', 'most', 'friends', 'had', 'drifted', 'start', 'poker', 'game', 'showing', 'little', 'interest', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'two', 'who', 'were', 'mesmerized', 'film', 'admiring', 'not', 'only', 'visuals', 'were', 'stark', 'devoid', 'cinematic', 'effects', 'also', 'ideas', 'were', 'being', 'exchanged', 'film', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'Stalker', 'Writer', 'Professor', 'Just', 'based', 'one', 'incident', 'movie', 'certain', 'level', 'introspection', 'as', 'well', 'acute', 'concentration', 'involvement', 'especially', 'understand', 'where', 'Tarkovsky', 'leading', 'viewer', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'expositions', 'characters', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'humankind', 'certain', 'statement', 'film', 'ultimate', 'use', 'technology', 'limitations', 'inability', 'ultimately', 'create', 'something', 'lasting', 'value', 'one', 'characters', '[', 'Writer', ']', 'explains', 'technology', 'served', 'mankind', 'kind', 'crutch', 'artifical', 'prop', 'lasting', 'value', 'artistic', 'creative', 'point', 'view', 'Also', 'Zone', 'mysterious', 'place', 'innocuous', 'visually', 'presents', 'life', 'amidst', 'decay', 'detritus', '[', 'human', 'detritus', 'left', 'behind', 'man', 'ranging', 'burnt', 'out', 'tanks', 'green', 'fields', 'syringe', ']', 'nothing', 'certain', 'nothing', 'straight', 'logic', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Only', 'Stalker', 'way', 'Zone', 'not', 'knowledge', 'terrain', 'prior', 'forays', 'Zone', 'immediate', 'real', 'time', 'assessment', 'own', 'state', 'mind', 'internal', 'communication', 'mysterious', 'forces', 'acting', 'Zone', 'ultimate', 'room', 'mental', 'construct', 'sorts', 'actually', 'dreadful', 'place', 'ultimately', 'most', 'people', 'supposedly', 'people', 'innermost', 'wishes', 'simplistic', 'way', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'most', 'people', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'most', 'secret', 'desires', 'wishes', 'granted', 'However', 'interesting', 'question', 'being', 'posed', 'here', 'anyone', 'really', 'know', 'anyone', 'really', 'interested', 'having', 'innermost', 'desires', 'wishes', 'granted', 'certain', 'dark', 'truth', 'here', 'most', 'individuals', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'such', 'place', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'innermost', 'desires', 'may', 'actually', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'wishing', 'Human', 'beings', 'are', 'complex', 'selfish', 'ultimately', 'self-serving', 'impossible', 'Tarkovsky', 'comprehend', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'totally', 'unselfish', 'desires', 'view', 'would', 'tend', 'agree', 'People', 'are', 'ultimately', 'going', 'act', 'own', 'interests', 'interests', 'family', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'concerned', 'one', 'going', 'act', 'humankind', 'altruistic', 'view', 'basis', 'reality', 'Stalker', 'story', 'regard', 'regarding', 'character', 'called', 'Porcupine', 'stalker', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'Zone', 'hoping', 'restore', 'life', 'ease', 'anguish', 'guilt', 'entering', 'mysterious', 'room', 'asking', 'wish', 'be', 'granted', 'what', 'was', 'wish', 'may', 'well', 'ask', 'Why', 'restore', 'brother', 'life', 'good', 'health', 'assuage', 'feelings', 'bring', 'peace', 'just', 'wipe', 'away', 'guilt', 'However', 'Zone', 'recognized', 'real', 'scoundrel', 'really', 'was', 'granted', 'innermost', 'secret', 'desire', 'be', 'really', 'wealthy', 'Fabulously', 'wealthy', 'as', 'soon', 'returned', 'Zone', 'was', 'tortured', 'guilt', 'committed', 'suicide', 'week', 'Moral', 'story', 'do', 'really', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'innermost', 'desires', 'first', 'place', 'anyone', 'really', 'capable', 'articulating', 'innermost', 'desires', 'People', 'are', 'shallow', 'individuals', 'focused', 'own', 'interests', 'live', 'surface', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'anyone', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'innermost', 'desires', 'are', 'Second', 'what', 'do', 'manage', 'discover', 'what', 'desires', 'really', 'are', 'are', 'really', 'deep', 'dark', 'disgusting', 'can', 'really', 'live', 'once', 'become', 'aware', 'Lastly', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'have', 'desires', 'fulfilled', 'were', 'not', 'right', 'place', 'start', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'movie', 'Zone', 'never', 'lets', 'go']",Stalker VHS

The Zone is suppose to have mythical properties as it has forces that can lure people to their demise, but also uncover our deepest desires.  Stalkers are the only ones who can sense mysterious forces and avoid the dangers within the Zone.  Many courageous people come to the Zone with stalkers as guides on quests to fulfill their wishes.  In this film the audience is to follow three characters, Stalker, Writer, and Scientist, as they venture into the perilous Zone.  The party's venture becomes a breathtaking journey through armed guards, obscure traps, and  psychological horror.  The journey can symbolically be interpreted as a pilgrimage in order to restore ones faith and hope, which have been lost.  This pilgrimage develops into a psychosocial battle between rationalism and abstract thought as the travelers attempt to reason with hope, faith, and love.

329342,A1J2LQPDI4NKRG,6302719666,Kirk McElhearn,"[3, 3]","It'd been many years since I had seen Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky's excellent science fiction film, and I watched it last night. For a science fiction movie, Stalker is certainly an oddity. Released in 1979, loosely based on the short novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and directed by Tarkovsky, the masterful Russian director who lived too short a life, it tells the tale of a part of Russia that has been visited by an odd event. It may have been a meteorite that fell, or it may have been an alien visitation. But the event created the Zone, a dangerous area which was cordoned off by the police, and where few could go.A Stalker - a sort of guide who takes people through the traps in the Zone - meets up with two men who want to visit the Room, a place where wishes come true. One is a Professor, a man of reason, and the other a writer, a man of inspiration. The Stalker is a man of belief. Very little happens in the movie, which lasts more than 2 1/2 hours, except for their trip to the Room, and their discovery of what they want from it.Stalker is science fiction only in its premise; there are no aliens, no magic, nothing that would be noticed as science fiction. It is a slow movie; very little happens, and some of the shots are several minutes long. It's a science fiction movie as it would have been written by Samuel Beckett. Yet it's a brilliant existential examination of the desires of men and women.At first, the film begins in sepia-toned black-and-white, but once the three characters reach the Zone, the film changes to color. Just as Oz was in color, so was the Zone. The Zone is located outside an industrialized city, and is full of the detritus of modernity. Yet Tarkovsky films these banal, cast-off items with the plastic beauty that he showed in all his films. Some of the shots are breathtakingly haunting, yet there is nothing special in them.In a prescient shot, near the end of the movie, the Stalker can be seen returning to his home with his wife and daughter, and, across the river, a nuclear power plant is seen. The Zone could be the area surrounding Chernobyl. There is no devastation, simply signs of nature taking over some human artefacts.According to an interview with the production designer, the film took two years to shoot. The first year's footage was lost, apparently because it was an experimental film stock that couldn't be developed. (Though that suggests that it was only sent for development after the entire film was shot, which seems at odds with the way movies were created at the time.) Tarkovsky then started over, reshooting the entire movie, over another year.The DVD is decently produced, though the English subtitles are a bit clunky. It contains the original mono soundtrack, and also a recent 5.1 mix, which, in my opinion, ruins the movie. It is merely the mono soundtrack with added environmental sounds, trying to create ""atmosphere,"" yet Tarkovsky used a lot of silence in this film, and the surround mix is never quiet.I first saw Stalker in the early 1980s at a retrospective of movies by Wim Wenders in New York. Wenders had made a selection of films to be shown with his movies, and, preceding his Kings of the Road (In the Course of Time), was Stalker and John Ford's The Searchers. All three of these movies are quests, searches for people or ideas, and the very long program that day (more than 7 hours) was an extraordinary example of three different approaches to the quest movie. Since then, it has been one of my favorite films. It's an odd movie, more like a Beckett play than science fiction, yet it is unforgettable.If you've never seen Stalker, you should by all means watch it. It is a truly unforgettable movie by one of the great directors of the 20th century. His life and career were too short, but his films are all masterpieces.",5,The Great Existentialist Science Fiction Film,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,3840,"[""'d"", 'been', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'seen', 'Stalker', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'excellent', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'Stalker', 'certainly', 'oddity', 'Released', '1979', 'loosely', 'based', 'short', 'novel', 'Roadside', 'Picnic', 'Arkady', 'Boris', 'Strugatsky', 'directed', 'Tarkovsky', 'masterful', 'Russian', 'director', 'who', 'lived', 'too', 'short', 'life', 'tale', 'part', 'Russia', 'been', 'visited', 'odd', 'event', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'meteorite', 'fell', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'alien', 'visitation', 'event', 'created', 'Zone', 'dangerous', 'area', 'was', 'cordoned', 'off', 'police', 'where', 'few', 'could', 'go.A', 'Stalker', 'sort', 'guide', 'who', 'people', 'traps', 'Zone', 'up', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'visit', 'Room', 'place', 'where', 'come', 'true', 'One', 'Professor', 'man', 'reason', 'other', 'writer', 'man', 'inspiration', 'Stalker', 'man', 'belief', 'Very', 'little', 'happens', 'movie', 'more', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'trip', 'Room', 'discovery', 'what', 'want', 'it.Stalker', 'science', 'fiction', 'only', 'premise', 'are', 'aliens', 'magic', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'noticed', 'science', 'fiction', 'slow', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'shots', 'are', 'several', 'minutes', 'long', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'brilliant', 'existential', 'examination', 'desires', 'men', 'women.At', 'first', 'film', 'sepia-toned', 'black-and-white', 'once', 'three', 'characters', 'reach', 'Zone', 'film', 'changes', 'color', 'Just', 'Oz', 'was', 'color', 'so', 'was', 'Zone', 'Zone', 'located', 'industrialized', 'city', 'full', 'detritus', 'modernity', 'Tarkovsky', 'films', 'banal', 'cast-off', 'items', 'plastic', 'beauty', 'showed', 'films', 'shots', 'are', 'breathtakingly', 'haunting', 'yet', 'nothing', 'special', 'them.In', 'prescient', 'shot', 'end', 'movie', 'Stalker', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'returning', 'home', 'wife', 'daughter', 'river', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'seen', 'Zone', 'could', 'be', 'area', 'surrounding', 'Chernobyl', 'devastation', 'simply', 'signs', 'nature', 'taking', 'human', 'artefacts.According', 'interview', 'production', 'designer', 'film', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'shoot', 'first', 'year', 'footage', 'was', 'lost', 'apparently', 'was', 'experimental', 'film', 'stock', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'developed', 'was', 'only', 'sent', 'development', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'odds', 'way', 'movies', 'were', 'created', 'time', 'Tarkovsky', 'then', 'started', 'reshooting', 'entire', 'movie', 'year.The', 'DVD', 'decently', 'produced', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'bit', 'clunky', 'original', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'recent', '5.1', 'mix', 'opinion', 'movie', 'merely', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'added', 'environmental', 'sounds', 'trying', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'yet', 'Tarkovsky', 'used', 'lot', 'silence', 'film', 'surround', 'mix', 'never', 'quiet.I', 'first', 'saw', 'Stalker', 'early', '1980s', 'retrospective', 'movies', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'New', 'York', 'Wenders', 'had', 'made', 'selection', 'films', 'be', 'shown', 'movies', 'preceding', 'Kings', 'Road', 'Course', 'Time', 'was', 'Stalker', 'John', 'Ford', 'Searchers', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'quests', 'searches', 'people', 'ideas', 'very', 'long', 'program', 'day', 'more', '7', 'hours', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'example', 'three', 'different', 'approaches', 'quest', 'movie', 'then', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'odd', 'movie', 'more', 'Beckett', 'play', 'science', 'fiction', 'unforgettable.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Stalker', 'should', 'means', 'watch', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'one', 'great', 'directors', '20th', 'century', 'life', 'career', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'films', 'are', 'masterpieces']",Stalker VHS
329343,A1WTYALNQNQG99,6302719666,Larry L. Looney,"[2, 4]","That being said, I'm so overwhelmed by Tarkovsky's work that I don't really know where to begin - I'm not a cinema expert by any means, but I can't resist weighing in with my opinions here.  Rather than re-hash the narrative of the film, I think I'll just stick to some of my impressions...Tarkovsky's use of color is astonishing - he switches from color to black-and-white in several of his films, for emphasis and mood, and very effectively.  The black-and-white sections of STALKER are actually sepia-toned - and the use of this device is perfect for underlining the bleakness (both physical and spiritual) of the cityscapes depicted.  He also uses it nicely in a dream sequence as the trio is on their way to the Room, journeying through the Zone.  The images of Stalker's dream - water flowing over hypodermic needles, religious icons, weapons, and other debris, all drained of color - are incredibly vivid, and symbolize (at least to me) the attempts of humans to numb themselves, to separate themselves from that which really matters - nature and the human spirit.  The voice-over - a woman or child - reading from the Book of Revelations is chilling as well.There's a scene in which Stalker leaves his companions for a brief while and makes his way to a well - his soliloquy here can only be termed a prayer, in my opinion - `...Let everything that's been planned come true.  Let them believe.  And let them have a laugh at their passions - because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world.'  He goes on to speak of the nature of weakness and strength - `...let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing and strength is nothing...Hardness and strength are Death's companions.  Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being - because what has hardened will never win.'  This is, for me, one of the most moving scenes in the film - and one of the greatest expressions of the importance of faith and hope that I've ever seen in a film.  Tarkovsky placed great store in hope - it's an idea that surfaces in many of his works.For the viewer unfamiliar with Tarkovsky's work, STALKER might actually be a good place to start - the non-linear method he used in some of his other works might be a little discouraging for some.

Villagers traveled through this curious area, now known as The Zone, and disappeared. Stories purport that there is an inner chamber within The Zone called The Room that grants one's deepest wish. Fearing the consequences from such an inscrutable resource, the army immediately secured the area with barbed wire and armed patrol. But the desperate and the suffering continue to make the treacherous journey, led by a disciplined, experienced stalker who can stealthily navigate through the constantly changing traps and pitfalls of The Zone. A successful Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), perhaps searching for inspiration or adventure, and a Scientist (Nikolai Grinko) searching for Truth, enlist the Stalker (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to guide them through The Zone. The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine, who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.Stalker is a visually serene, highly metaphoric, and deeply haunting treatise on the essence of the soul. Episodically, Andrei Tarkovsky uses chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and The Zone. Thematically, as in Solaris, the transition serves as an oneiric device to separate physical reality from the subconscious. The created barriers and imposed laws of the outside world parallel the Stalker's incoherent tracking methods for reaching The Room. Note that despite the Stalker's warning not to use the same path twice, the Scientist returns to retrieve his knapsack unharmed, casting doubt on the Stalker's navigational rules. Symbolically, it is as if the subconscious is in denial of its sincerest wish, creating its own boundaries and impediments to prevent its realization. After a circuitous route, the men arrive at the antechamber to The Room, hesitant to proceed, unable to define their innermost wish: their spiritual longing. The floor is strewn with coins, hypodermic needles, weapons, and religious icons: a reflection of the mind's search for escape from its misery. In the end, The Zone's real or imagined powers proves to be inconsequential to the weary, ambivalent seekers.

During the journey we're given the obligatory and angst ridden insights into each man's character and learn that, while the Stalker can get them to the room, he is himself forbidden entry.  We also learn of a previous visitor (called Porcupine) who returned from the room to fabulous wealth and then killed himself.""Stalker"" has been hailed by many as a masterpiece.  But ""Stalker"" is long and slow (163 minutes), and lots of people (who seem to be anticipating some kind of ""Citizen Kane"" thing) have trouble with this, get upset, and write reviews about ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", etc..Which is fine, because the joke is on them.  ""Stalker"" is one of those movies that either you get, or it gets you.It is, of course, an allegory.  The Writer and Scientist are obviously symbols for the right and left brain, and The Stalker is obviously a Film Director (Artist).  The Journey is the work itself, and the Room is the mirror that great Art is: to enter is to risk discovering something new about yourself.  This is why Porcupine committed suicide: when he discovered his heart's desire he couldn't face it.Eventually the Stalker gets Writer and Scientist to the threshold of the room, but the journey has shown them enough about themselves to give them second thoughts -- they are petty, vengeful, shallow, narcissistic, insecure -- and on the verge of achieving their ""heart's desire"", they refuse to go in.Back home they go their separate ways, the Stalker returning to his miserable home, long-suffering wife, and crippled child.  He is despairing: he won't go back there, can't make the journey again. It's a waste of time.  But while he sleeps his wife tells us otherwise.Tarkovsky's science fiction films are probably his most autobiographical: ""Solaris"" (his relationship with his father), ""Stalker"" (his wife), and ""The Sacrifice"" (his son).  Depending on your mood, they can all be a hard slog,  but it is ""Stalker"" that is probably the most gut-wrenchingly personal: it describes the agony, effort and despair that confronts any artist trying to make something of value.  And the humiliation when it is wasted on fools.""Stalker"" is a film about Art, The Audience and The Artist that is so masterfully constructed it traps the Audience inside the idea that is the film: a work of Art about the Artist amd his Audience; a complete statement about the relationship between Director and Audience: if you are watching this film, then this film is about you.  It's a gag worthy of the Coen Brothers (maybe even the Marx Brothers in ""Go West"").  Once the film begins, you are there: you *are* on the journey (literally and metaphorically).  You *are* taken to the room (literally and metaphorically).An artist trying to see their own work is like a magician trying to be surprised by his own tricks.  Whatever the original inspiration might've been, in the end it's reduced to process -- the journey.  Like the Stalker, this was Tarkovksy's lot in life -- no magic, just a long and arduous journey to a place that someone else will get to enjoy.  But if you've ever made art, you will recognize the path, and sometimes that's enough.For everyone else, love it or hate it, ""Stalker"" -- the movie -- *is* the room.

329346,APAFXF4XQ2CFF,6302719666,"Mark Handel ""Mark Handel""","[5, 7]","In 1986, the film world lost one of its unique contributors in Andrei Tarkovsky, who helped to redefine the sci-fi genre with Solaris in 1972 and 1979's sometimes-forgotten masterpiece, Stalker. One of the progenitors of the ""slow burn"" plot pace, which came to dominate much of the science-fiction epics of the 1970s, Tarkovsky focused on the psychological consequences, rather than technological aspects, of the future and its revolutionary discoveries. Though both of these films center on indirect meetings between man and intangible alien life forms, Stalker takes the concept one step further and completely strips it of anything resembling technological advancement. Centered on ""the Zone,"" a forbidden area in rural Russia where something happened 20 years ago (nobody knows for sure what), Stalker concerns a noted guide of the Zone and his attempt to bring two passengers into the area for purposes of exploration, enlightenment, and ultimately fulfillment. After sneaking through the heavily guarded gates to the Zone, the guide and his passengers encounter a decrepit village area, littered with rusted objects and distended foliage overgrowth. In a likely homage to the Wizard of Oz, the film itself changes from the drab, depressing sepia of the ""real"" world into vivid color, accentuating the unreality of what appears to be a typical, though abandoned, country village. Nothing, of course, is what it seems in the Zone, and the further the characters delve into it, the more it messes with their minds. We learn the fears, ambitions, and flaws of the characters as they venture deeper into the Zone, and when they arrive at their final destination, a place that supposedly grants one's innermost wishes...well, I don't want to spoil it for you. Stalker requires, like other films of its time and genre, a certain degree of patience from the viewer--patience that is handsomely rewarded in the end. Five invisible, psychokinetic stars.

329350,A1MKFYZZ2X46RA,6302719666,"""mythologue""","[2, 7]","This profound and mystical film covers space which is as much interior as it is exterior; a space of faith more and more impeded by the skepticism of the modern world, represented here by both the Writer and Professor. The Stalker, on the other hand, stands for an initiatory wisdom that still lives despite growing oppression and incomprehension. The movie begins with the dark and urban images of the profane condition, but they are gradually eclipsed by the vivid colors and textures of the Zone, which symbolize man's renewed proximity to the sacred. The knowledge one obtains in the Zone is quite unlike ordinary knowledge; one doesn't so much grasp it as one lives it. The characters' ritual journey has deep ties with what they really are, and thus the knowledge of the divine (or what goes beyond man) is inextricably linked to the knowledge of self. The Zone culminates in the Room, where miracle proper can take place; the Zone-Room couple is akin to the Temple-Sanctuary relationship that can be found in ancient mystery cults. In order to get the most out of the Zone, man must be animated by a true vocation (like the Stalker), and not only by ambition and curiosity (like the Writer and Professor); one must surrender to it rather than rationalize its subtle power.

329351,A38921VU3NJDFK,6302719666,N. Anno,"[2, 4]","In his return to the sci-fi genre, seven years after Solaris, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky delivers another stupefying vision. This time, it's of a world in ruins following the strike of a meteor, which has left in its wake an area called ""The Zone"", wherein there is a room that is said to have the ability to grant one his or her most intimate desires. Permitted to enter and exit ""The Zone"" are guides called ""Stalkers"", one of which is the film's main focus, a man played by Alexander Kaidanovsky who goes into ""The Zone"" with two others (credited simply as ""Writer"" and ""Scientist""). As great sci-fi films are often able to do, Stalker presents its central idea through sequences of beauty and metaphorical poetry. Its central idea is faith, which, in the film, contends against science and technology. As a production, Stalker is one of the more contemplatively gorgeous movies ever made -- it's articulate, though subtle; modest, yet overwhelming; and extremely powerful, despite its apparent quiet intention to be slip by the viewer unnoticed.",5,Stalker (1979),1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,1056,"['return', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'seven', 'years', 'Solaris', 'Russian', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'stupefying', 'vision', 'time', 'world', 'ruins', 'following', 'strike', 'meteor', 'left', 'wake', 'area', 'called', 'Zone', 'wherein', 'room', 'said', 'have', 'ability', 'grant', 'one', 'most', 'intimate', 'desires', 'Permitted', 'enter', 'exit', 'Zone', 'are', 'guides', 'called', 'Stalkers', 'one', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'man', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Kaidanovsky', 'who', 'Zone', 'two', 'others', 'credited', 'simply', 'Writer', 'Scientist', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'able', 'do', 'Stalker', 'central', 'idea', 'sequences', 'beauty', 'metaphorical', 'poetry', 'central', 'idea', 'faith', 'film', 'science', 'technology', 'production', 'Stalker', 'one', 'more', 'contemplatively', 'gorgeous', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'articulate', 'though', 'subtle', 'modest', 'yet', 'overwhelming', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'apparent', 'quiet', 'intention', 'be', 'slip', 'viewer', 'unnoticed']",Stalker VHS
329352,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,6302719666,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[7, 9]","Tarkovsky's fifth feature film, and the last one he made in the USSR, depicts a profound and unsettling journey into the mysterious regions of human desire.  Probably his best film and likely the best introduction to his work, the film employs the trappings of science fiction in order to explore the relation between literature and science, between reason and faith, and between the individual and the state.A strange region, of unknown origins, is created in the midst of an unnamed authoritarian country.  Unable to destroy the ""Zone"" through force, the authorities sealed it off, guarding its borders; only a few have the courage to enter, inspired by legends of a hidden room in the depths of the zone where one's deepest desires can be granted.  A scientist and a writer solicit the help of an outlawed ""stalker"" to help them find their way through the zone.  Only they can determine whether they have courage to face their own deepest longings.The film exhibits many of Tarkovsky's distinctive stylings - long, slow takes with subtle camera movements, spare and inventive use of soundtracks, obsession with the ruins of human dwellings, quotations from his father's poetry, alternation between color and monochrome photography - but here these are very much in the service of the story, and the story is very much in the service of creating a mood and atmosphere for reflection that evokes the concerns of the characters, who serve both as types (scientist, writer, spiritual guide) and as very distinctive individuals.  The world outside of the zone is depicted in a high contrast sepia, while the inner regions of the zone are in vivid color, for example.  Tarkovsky suggested that his composer not create an orchestral soundtrack, but rather to draw upon the natural sounds of the scenes depicted in order to make music of them, most evident perhaps as the three travelers enter the zone on a train car, and the rhythms of the rails create an otherworldly music.What makes Stalker so remarkable is that it works on so many levels.  As a science fiction voyage, it is inventive and unusual, and creates a real atmosphere of wonder and dread, and brings the mysteries of the Zone to life through creative use of real locations.  As a poetic exploration of human desire, it is subtle and powerful and the beautiful imagery creates the right atmosphere for and the long takes give the space for real reflection on nature and civilization and possibilities for transcendence.  As a philosophical investigation, the dialogue is sure to stimulate reflections on the relation between art and science, between faith and reason, and between the individual and community.  Highly recommended for seekers of truth and stalkers of exciting cinema.On the DVD: it looks quite good, and I'm glad to see that Kino put some care into this release, though it seemed to me that sometimes the color balance was off, and that when there was a shift from long establishing shots to medium or closeups the lighting levels didn't match precisely.  As I recall, I didn't notice that issue in the older VHS copy - even though the picture and especially the sound in this version are superior to that one in other respects - or when I saw this in a theater from a 35mm print about 15 years ago.  The extras are valuable - a few interviews with people who worked on the film.  The interview with Eduard Artemyev regarding Tarkovsky's ideas about sound was interesting.  And I thought ""Memory,"" a rare short film depicting the ruins of Tarkovsky's childhood home in Moscow, was quite provocative.  Most intriguing, perhaps, was the interview with production designer Rashit Safiullin.  He lived with Tarkovsky throughout the two years of production, with the first year ending in disaster when the experimental Kodak film they had used could not be developed, so that the film had to be remade completely, with a much smaller budget, and in a very different way.  He describes that period as like being in the zone, where you speak only the most honest words about the most important subjects.  Outside the zone you dissimulate, you seek to impress; inside your inner truth is revealed, whether you are superficial, whether you have something to say, what it is you really want.  He claims to have experienced such intimacy during his time with Tarkovsky.",5,"Do we have the courage to face our innermost desires? - a brilliant, unsettling, poetic journey into the Zone",1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,4335,"['Tarkovsky', 'fifth', 'feature', 'film', 'last', 'one', 'made', 'USSR', 'profound', 'unsettling', 'journey', 'mysterious', 'regions', 'human', 'desire', 'Probably', 'best', 'film', 'likely', 'best', 'introduction', 'work', 'film', 'trappings', 'science', 'fiction', 'order', 'explore', 'relation', 'literature', 'science', 'reason', 'faith', 'individual', 'state.A', 'strange', 'region', 'unknown', 'origins', 'created', 'midst', 'unnamed', 'authoritarian', 'country', 'Unable', 'destroy', 'Zone', 'force', 'authorities', 'sealed', 'off', 'guarding', 'borders', 'only', 'few', 'have', 'courage', 'enter', 'inspired', 'legends', 'hidden', 'room', 'depths', 'zone', 'where', 'one', 'deepest', 'desires', 'can', 'be', 'granted', 'scientist', 'writer', 'solicit', 'help', 'outlawed', 'stalker', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'zone', 'Only', 'can', 'determine', 'have', 'courage', 'face', 'own', 'deepest', 'longings.The', 'film', 'many', 'Tarkovsky', 'distinctive', 'stylings', 'long', 'slow', 'subtle', 'camera', 'movements', 'spare', 'inventive', 'use', 'soundtracks', 'obsession', 'ruins', 'human', 'dwellings', 'quotations', 'father', 'poetry', 'alternation', 'color', 'monochrome', 'photography', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'service', 'story', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'service', 'creating', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'reflection', 'concerns', 'characters', 'who', 'serve', 'types', 'scientist', 'writer', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'very', 'distinctive', 'individuals', 'world', 'zone', 'depicted', 'high', 'contrast', 'sepia', 'inner', 'regions', 'zone', 'are', 'vivid', 'color', 'example', 'Tarkovsky', 'suggested', 'composer', 'not', 'create', 'orchestral', 'soundtrack', 'rather', 'draw', 'natural', 'sounds', 'scenes', 'depicted', 'order', 'make', 'music', 'most', 'evident', 'perhaps', 'three', 'travelers', 'enter', 'zone', 'train', 'car', 'rhythms', 'rails', 'create', 'otherworldly', 'music.What', 'Stalker', 'remarkable', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'science', 'fiction', 'voyage', 'inventive', 'unusual', 'real', 'atmosphere', 'wonder', 'dread', 'mysteries', 'Zone', 'life', 'creative', 'use', 'real', 'locations', 'poetic', 'exploration', 'human', 'desire', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'long', 'give', 'space', 'real', 'reflection', 'nature', 'civilization', 'possibilities', 'transcendence', 'philosophical', 'investigation', 'dialogue', 'sure', 'stimulate', 'reflections', 'relation', 'art', 'science', 'faith', 'reason', 'individual', 'community', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'seekers', 'truth', 'stalkers', 'exciting', 'cinema.On', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Kino', 'put', 'care', 'release', 'seemed', 'color', 'balance', 'was', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'shift', 'long', 'establishing', 'shots', 'medium', 'closeups', 'lighting', 'levels', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'precisely', 'recall', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'issue', 'older', 'VHS', 'copy', 'even', 'picture', 'especially', 'sound', 'version', 'are', 'superior', 'one', 'other', 'respects', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', '35mm', 'print', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'extras', 'are', 'valuable', 'few', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'interview', 'Eduard', 'Artemyev', 'regarding', 'Tarkovsky', 'ideas', 'sound', 'was', 'interesting', 'thought', 'Memory', 'rare', 'short', 'film', 'depicting', 'ruins', 'Tarkovsky', 'childhood', 'home', 'Moscow', 'was', 'quite', 'provocative', 'Most', 'intriguing', 'perhaps', 'was', 'interview', 'production', 'designer', 'Rashit', 'Safiullin', 'lived', 'Tarkovsky', 'two', 'years', 'production', 'first', 'year', 'ending', 'disaster', 'when', 'experimental', 'Kodak', 'film', 'had', 'used', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'developed', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'remade', 'completely', 'much', 'smaller', 'budget', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'period', 'being', 'zone', 'where', 'speak', 'only', 'most', 'honest', 'words', 'most', 'important', 'subjects', 'zone', 'dissimulate', 'seek', 'impress', 'inner', 'truth', 'revealed', 'are', 'superficial', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'have', 'experienced', 'such', 'intimacy', 'time', 'Tarkovsky']",Stalker VHS

Admittedly I'm not a fanboy of Tarkovsky, but I had heard of the storyline of ""Roadside Picnic"" which this was inspired by and which has translated into a fabulous computer game (Stalker -- 2007).  I was fully expecting something strange and perhaps slow, but had an otherwise open mind.  The beginning of the movie is intriguing -- the Stalker and his companions plan to penetrate into the Zone past the military checkpoint.  This they carry off at great risk to themselves.  Finally clear of the military, they confront the Zone itself with all its dangers.  They confront the first appearance of an anomaly in great trepidation.  There is a glimpse of something unusual in the tall grass.  All this should set the heart of players of the game Stalker racing, and without having read the book, I would imagine up to this point the movie is very faithful to the story.Now had Tarkovsky continued in however minimal a fashion with this great opening, the film would have been stunning.  But the highpoint of the film after this point -- or, excuse me, the highpoint of the action in the film -- would be an encounter with a real dog.  The interim period up until the finale, which had its moments, consists of long looks at murky mud puddles and beautiful long pans of an ugly albeit colorful landscape.  It's an internal film, all right, which is another way to say it is stupefyingly boring unless you're just fine with zero action.  This was Tarkovsky's stated intention -- he knew the story and could have made a post apocalyptic film like so many others, but he wanted something different.I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one -- otherwise why would so many wax poetic on the brilliance of this film?  But from the perspective of one with a fairly high tolerance for oddity and slow spots, I must say this movie is worth a rental but a hard sell for a permanent spot in ones collection.  I drifted in and out of conciousness trying to stay awake to see something interesting.  Beautifully photographed and musically scored, this is a yawner of staggering eminence.

Having no insurance Tarkovsky had to re-shoot most of the film again on a remaining shoe-string budget which restricted the production dramatically. He was forced to film Stalker without the vast sets that had since been taken down and headed for the fields in order to concentrate on a character driven science-fiction movie.Stalker is bafflingly simple, but it is the story and characters that take this film to a new level. The premise is quite straightforward - a meteorite has crashed near a small town causing the Russian army to takeover the entire area. During their investigation they discover that the meteorite has caused some form of a psychological disturbance on all who enter The Zone. The Zone is sealed off but our main protagonist, Stalker, has been to The Zone more than once and acts as a tour guide for people who want to visit this strange and dangerous place. The film starts with Stalker disobeying his distraught wife in order to take two men - a writer and a scientist, to The Zone. The rest of the movie concentrates on their journey, spiritually, mentally and physically. There are some surprises in store at the end.Stalker is like the metaphysics of the Matrix multiplied by ten. It is deeply philosophical in nature and haunting. The locations are beautiful and the camera is always where Tarkovsky wants it to be. Stalker can be a bleak film at times with many slow parts but it is still highly engaging and looks terrific. Not many directors can take three men, put them in a field and then using dialogue alone and a few puddles of water, turn it into an absolutely original sci-fi fest.... for that alone the film is a must see and deserves full marks.Film students should definitely study this simple masterpiece.***As a note the transfer is not the best and MPEG encoding does not work well with still shots. In fact DVD does not do Tarkovsky any justice. The film has also been digitally corrected and the start of the film in the bedroom looks terrible, but it does get a lot better after that.

'Stalker' which, if my memory serves me, is photographed by Tarkovsky, but not directed by him; it's a film that lacks the subjectivity of 'Ivan's Childhood'. Tarkovsky's 'Ivan's Childhood', is a wonderful piece of cinema that places the audience within its' frames and reigns you through a devastating story and not rob you of essential and hypnotic moments, 'Stalker' tends to do the opposite. Even if this was a novel, I can't believe that there would be moments in the story where the reader and in this case the viewer would be toyed like this until an important surprising moment in the film arrives, with no foreshadow or even a slight forboding in its' narrative... an approach this intense story would have deserved ... so it just lays an egg.Why would you make a film with stunning photography and moments of incredible mood, with an interesting, compelling story, a wonderfully written script with great actors and rob us of the experience?My review will not give away any details and my disappointment is not generally about pacing; I love slow moving art, but there are some slow moments that mean nothing in this movie. It takes away the experience of cinema, yet expects us to enjoy it as cinema. I do not highly recommend this movie, but for cinema buffs, when it gets it right, it's worth at least one viewing. To be specific, when it does succeed we are reminded of Kubrick and Hitchcock, so don't look for originality in camera shots but look out for the great photography; there are sublime moments.If you are wanting to see a Tarkovsky masterpiece, see 'Ivan's Chilhood' one of the greatest films I've ever seen!",2,"cinema is an art form, not an exercise",1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,1743,"['seeing', 'masterpiece', 'Childhood', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', 'determined', 'find', 'other', 'films', 'DVD', ""'Stalker"", 'memory', 'serves', 'photographed', 'Tarkovsky', 'not', 'directed', 'film', 'subjectivity', ""'Ivan"", 'Childhood', 'Tarkovsky', ""'Ivan"", 'Childhood', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'audience', 'frames', 'reigns', 'devastating', 'story', 'not', 'rob', 'essential', 'hypnotic', 'moments', ""'Stalker"", 'tends', 'do', 'opposite', 'Even', 'was', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'moments', 'story', 'where', 'reader', 'case', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'toyed', 'important', 'surprising', 'moment', 'film', 'foreshadow', 'even', 'slight', 'forboding', 'narrative', 'approach', 'intense', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'deserved', 'just', 'egg.Why', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'stunning', 'photography', 'moments', 'incredible', 'mood', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'script', 'great', 'actors', 'rob', 'experience', 'My', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'details', 'disappointment', 'not', 'generally', 'pacing', 'love', 'slow', 'moving', 'art', 'are', 'slow', 'moments', 'mean', 'nothing', 'movie', 'away', 'experience', 'cinema', 'enjoy', 'cinema', 'do', 'not', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'cinema', 'buffs', 'when', 'right', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'be', 'specific', 'when', 'succeed', 'are', 'reminded', 'Kubrick', 'Hitchcock', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'originality', 'camera', 'shots', 'look', 'out', 'great', 'photography', 'are', 'sublime', 'are', 'wanting', 'see', 'Tarkovsky', 'masterpiece', 'see', 'Chilhood', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",Stalker VHS
329361,A3FDFVJKDA4P1D,6302719666,Peter S. Lunde,"[143, 163]","The title STALKER is quite misunderstood because many think it is a translation from a Russian word that means 'to stalk.'. Actually Tarkovsky's script inserted the word STALKER thinking it was a catchy  English equivalent for something like a Russian pathfinder or guide. In  that context, the central character's role is better understood, for he  spends time leading the writer and scientist toward discovery and  revelation, which they ultimately cannot achieve. STALKER is a masterpiece  of imposed reality on the viewer. Make no mistake: this film is very  difficult to stay with without your utmost attention. Little artifice, few  physical elements, hardly any plot, STALKER exists as a journey that draws  your mind, heart, and soul into the nature of human existence. Only those  intelligent and sensitive enough to ride Tarkovsky's waves of feeling,  emotion, and thought can comprehend his message of possible salvation and  redemption through love and persistent searching for human truth. The  writing on the video box implies this is another sci fi film, but clearly  it is not. Tarkovsky's great films are mythical allegories in the tradition  of Pilgrim's Progress or Piers Plowman. For me, Tarkovsky is the ultimate  challenge in intellectual film making, because he presents and discusses  his ideas only in the context of the film itself, not just as a media  vehicle to speak. What strikes me most is his absolutely consistent sense  of pace in all his films: slow, deliberate, but fluid and highly organic.  He is one of the few great masters of film as an art form.",5,The title STALKER is misunderstood,930700800,"06 30, 1999",1999,1588,"['title', 'STALKER', 'quite', 'misunderstood', 'many', 'think', 'translation', 'Russian', 'word', ""'to"", 'stalk.', 'Actually', 'Tarkovsky', 'script', 'inserted', 'word', 'STALKER', 'thinking', 'was', 'catchy', 'English', 'equivalent', 'something', 'Russian', 'pathfinder', 'guide', 'context', 'central', 'character', 'role', 'better', 'understood', 'time', 'leading', 'writer', 'scientist', 'discovery', 'revelation', 'ultimately', 'can', 'not', 'achieve', 'STALKER', 'masterpiece', 'imposed', 'reality', 'viewer', 'Make', 'mistake', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'stay', 'utmost', 'attention', 'Little', 'artifice', 'few', 'physical', 'elements', 'hardly', 'plot', 'STALKER', 'journey', 'mind', 'heart', 'soul', 'nature', 'human', 'existence', 'Only', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'ride', 'Tarkovsky', 'waves', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'thought', 'can', 'comprehend', 'message', 'possible', 'salvation', 'redemption', 'love', 'persistent', 'searching', 'human', 'truth', 'writing', 'video', 'box', 'implies', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'Tarkovsky', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'mythical', 'allegories', 'tradition', 'Pilgrim', 'Progress', 'Piers', 'Plowman', 'Tarkovsky', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'intellectual', 'film', 'making', 'ideas', 'only', 'context', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'media', 'vehicle', 'speak', 'What', 'most', 'absolutely', 'consistent', 'sense', 'pace', 'films', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'fluid', 'highly', 'organic', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'masters', 'film', 'art', 'form']",Stalker VHS
329362,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6302719666,Phillip Kay,"[6, 8]","Watching Tarkovsky's Stalker was not an enjoyable experience, but it did make something about his achievement much clearer to me. In this film, and in most of his work that I have seen, Tarkovsky tells the viewer nothing: no plot, no characters, no resolution. He sets up an ambience through beautifully textured photography and lighting, stunning command of soundscapes, and a carefully undefined nexus of meaning. Then he allows the viewer to create a meaning. For some it is an overwhelming experience, for others a bore. This is not cinema as we normally know it but much closer to the effect of great poetry. It is sound and setting used as metaphor by means of which we can create what we can. Or not.Forget the Strugatsky's Roadside Picnic (just as you had to forget Lem's Solaris when watching Tarkovsky's film of the same name). There is something called the Zone, but we don't know what it is, where or why it occurred. For the confused or troubled, something inside the Zone can provide a revelation. What it is or how it works we don't know. It's perimeter is guarded, but we don't know who guards it or why. Three men enter the Zone, we don't really know why, nor who they are. Viewers who claim to know more are reading information from the novel's plot, or quoting other viewers who are.The Stalker (think of one of Fenimore Cooper's characters like the Deerstalker), the Writer, the Scientist are on a journey like Dante's. They seem confused and inarticulate, but they do know something is wrong, and they hope to remedy it, somehow, within the Zone. The Stalker is as driven as the other two.  Tarkovsky suggests what the men are seeking by filming outside the Zone, a sterile no man's land of ruin, in a washed out sepia, and inside the Zone, a lush natural tangle of vegetation, in vibrant colour.Stalker is about the search for redemption, filmed in such a way the viewer must conduct the search themselves. Unlike Solaris, whose themes of love and memory were presented in the form of a screenplay the viewer could engage with, Stalker is a much more extreme film which approaches the limit of what a film can do. It is a film which can have no clear climax, no rationale, no explanation. The journey is the important part.I regret the fact my rational self would not let go while watching it, that I thought the lack of proper names risible and just like everybody's first novel, that the contrast between inside and outside the Zone was too obvious. I hated that the film was unnecessarily divided over two disks as it was for VHS release and that the subtitles were sometimes in such bad English they were hard to follow.  This time around it wasn't for me.

Even the ""ugly"" scenes are riveting to look at, and the lush greenery of the Zone, interspersed with rusting vehicles and crumbling buildings, is so real I often felt I had to brush the dew off of me while watching. The theme is definitely worthy of Tarkovsky, and like his other films, would require a moderately-sized paragraph in itself to even state what it is.There are numerous ""stand alone"" scenes which show flashes of Tarkovsky's usual standard of brilliance (the initial scene in the bar where the characters get aquainted with each other, the running of the blockade around the Zone, the Stalker's despair over the lack of Faith in his companions, and one or two others... but (and this is a HUGE ""but"")...The movie just never manages to make any of it come together. Far too often, we listen to the Stalker referencing ""terrible things"" that will happen to them if they deviate from the path, but we never actually see anything even remotely terrifying. This violates Chekhov's First Law of Drama: If a gun is shown in Act One, it must be fired before Act Five. The ""gun"" is never fired in ""Stalker"". What we are left with is a moderately difficult trek though overgrown fields and abandoned ruins, interspersed with moderately interesting philosophical discussions. As viewers, the characters instruct us to consider all this to be spiritually mysterious and pregnant with meaning, but in the end we as viewers see none of this. In contrast, consider the magnificently structured final scene in Andre Rublev, the Casting of the Great Bell. Here no one tells us ""this is going to be moving and charged with meaning""  - it just is. We need no instruction in how we're supposed to react - we just do.So is it a ""bad"" movie? No. But it is a disappointing one, mainly because Tarkovsky has set the bar so high in his other, far superior works.

We seem to be drawn to this (is it a film) it breaks the genre, or that is simply Tarkovski's visual language. Fear is the Factor here; what makes one travel to the Forbidden Zone?, this is a very Eastern concept, (that a ""place"" can be contaminated, places are usually reserved for the spirit,like nature) They say Russia had kept the barbarian hordes from the West and this has shaped its history giving it a function for better and worse. If it didn't have nuclear weapons, it would have been invaded, robbed by the free democracies long ago.The Stalker himself is unsure,he wants intellectuals to have committment to humanity, simply to be what they say they are,and they are not; the word ""pravda"" is tossed about throughout the film. But the Writer and the Scientist are simply opportunists. The Scientist is going to the Zone to acquire power,or knowledge.Well that's why you go, but you could return, deformed relatively, (for we are already deformed.) Tarkovski it seems explores this ""grayness"",opaqueness; neither this nor that paradox I think.  The Scientist brought a kiloton bomb with him, to detroy the Zone? Perhaps Not! He was in the Room and phoned his equally opportunist colleague. I guess the phones work in the Zone, but the Flowers don't smell.And one needs to throw these white clothes with a stone enbedded in its head like a dart to see if it is safe to proceed.The number of shots of the Human Head (turned away from frontal view) while the situation is one of movements/motions are incredible, as in the initial travel to the Zone where all we see is the Writer's Head, and all are on a railcar, we hear only the clickkedy clack of the rails, the pulse of motion.Not knowing where we are going, like traveling on a train with one's eyes closed. And again at the end the Stalker carries his daughter who is deformed without legs, we see only her head bobbling as she rides on the Stalker's shoulders. The price he paid for travelling to the Zone prior, his sperm is infected now.The slow transformations of colour are also incredible from the darknesses of the opening brwons and greens, blacks and their shadows, to almost full colour. Tarkovski seems to create quite a filmic language with the various horizons is viewed(indoors and outdoors) of the neiboring towns, just enough to get a feel for the serenity that can be part of existence, or the corridors and alleyways in the opening half hour.The overall grainy-ness of the film is a tension in and of itself, like something that cannot be resolved.

That he has chosen the science-fiction genre to explore these inner worlds and landscapes in ""Stalker"", only adds to the obtuse and challenging quality of the film. Like ""Solaris"" before it, this is a film devoid of special effects and devoid of the universal narrative concerns and themes which one associates with the genre, one could ask whether it is science-fiction at all. As one expects the patience of the narrative build up is quite demanding and instead of action set pieces, the main sequences of the film are derived through dialogue exchanges. The zone brings up all kinds of ethical concerns which are explored, but it's presence in the world as an Eden like space is its most important function. Just as the harsh, polluted and decaying modern Russia is sepia tinted, the zone is shot in lustrous colour, giving the greens of the vegetation an added lustre and vitality. This formal device to me works in an allegorical fashion. The Zone is a space separate from the corruption and tyranny of a dehumanising communist regime and as such its very existence is the ultimate wish fulfilment for the people.

The opening titles just get in the way of the not-quite black-and-white Tarkovsky achieved by filming in color and processing in black and white.  It's my first Tarkovsky and I'm already doing research!You immediately know that you are in the presence of something great, a Kurosawa, a Besson, an unTarantino.  That Stalker could get made in 1979 in the Soviet Union is incredible, especially considering some of the quotes and allusions.Oh it's slow and boring, some have complained.  Two minutes of a dude walking across a field; two minutes of the same dude walking back.  Nothing happening.  Not true, there is always something happening in a Tarkovsky shot, you just gotta look for it.  The foreground is shimmering, the background is shimmering, the guy lying motionless in the grass has a leech crawling across his hand and so on.Stalker is also one of the wettest movies you'll ever see, drip drip dripping like Zed and Two Noughts, The Faculty, or even Das Boot.The director imbues ordinary scenery and locations with such dread and foreboding that you too fear every step, but feel compelled to go on.  How does he do it without the cellos and the splatter and other hackneyed devices that are currently used to portray suspense?  There is a subtle sense of humor too.  A conversation ensues between the three characters and the camera pans back and forth between them in a conventional way.  The three march off and the camera remains, it was really taking no one's perspective, it was some fourth other, maybe The Zone itself watching them!Don't turn the sound down for the famous rail transit into the Zone (some claim the scene was intended to be silent) Turn It Up! way up, and enjoy the Persian tar and Tarkovsky at his best.The ending?  Well enigmatic about covers it, but maybe it's like the couple of slow spots in the film, you just need to view it more.  Besides, anything vaguely M. Night Shyamalan-ish would have been a travesty.

329370,A2AREUQXKG7PCG,6302719666,Snow Leopard,"[6, 7]","The first Tarkovsky movie I ever saw, this left an instantaneous and indelible impression on me.  Set in an apparently rather totalitarian, and Sovietly grim future, the film follows two men (a writer and a scientist) on their trek, guided by a stalker, into the Zone, at the center of which is said to be a room where one's wishes come true.  Anyone familiar with the novella by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (they wrote the screenplay as well) will be struck by how different the two are.Tarkovsky denies that there is any symbolism in his films. If that is the case, then it is not a subtext of spirituality that I get from this film, but an open announcement of it. Because what most makes this film really not science fiction in the final analysis is its deeply felt spirituality. (Not that science and spirituality are mutually antagonistic, but that's a separate issue.)  The stalker, played by Alexander Kaidonovsky, is genuinely heart-breaking in his simplicity and openness, compared to the intellectuality and cynicism of the two men who accompany him.  And the speculations the two educated men engage in are more purely philosophical than inherently science fictional in nature. (Not that science fiction and philosophy are mutually antagonistic either.)What most makes the film, though, is its intense surreality and the cinematography that makes it possible.  If you are not already familiar with the achingly slow cinematography Tarkovsky loves to employ, then the sense of suspense that this film can drum up in you will be amazing.  Tarkovsky loves to plant the camera on a physical object, and then make you look at it until you have no choice but to decide you're missing something, that more must be there. Thus Tarkovsky inspires you to look at the world in a visionary way so that even the most banal objects start to take on an ominous significance.  Elsewhere, Tarkovsky unnerves you by having his characters keep looking over their shoulders while the camera creeps up on them with murderous intent from an off-angle.In the novella, the Zone itself is a place where the laws of physics are broken, bent or simply no longer apply.  As such, one cannot approach the Room directly (even though it is just across a field), but must approach with respect by going the long way around.  Tarkovsky encodes this ""non-Euclidean"" reality of the Zone in several ways, but one shot in particular is breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. The Stalker lies in a stream of water, and the camera then pans in a straight line, treating us to a phenomenally gorgeous still life of submerged objects, when suddenly the stalker comes back into view.  Apparently we've somehow gone in a circle, though it seemed the line of vision was constantly straight.  The way that this is blatantly startling is matched by innumerable other details throughout the film, as Tarkovsky ruthlessly and subtly tweaks things to keep the suspense constantly high.  Tarkovsky will even change grains of film stock in order to unsettle what you are looking at.Certainly one of the most moving and gorgeous ""science fiction"" movies ever, it is also a meditation on the nature of human responsibility and remorse.  Personally, I find the Stalker to be the most affectingly drawn of all of Tarkovsky's protagonists, perhaps because he is the one who most openly gives voice to Tarkovsky's own intense spirituality.",5,Amazing and Breathtaking,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,3395,"['first', 'Tarkovsky', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'left', 'instantaneous', 'indelible', 'impression', 'Set', 'apparently', 'rather', 'totalitarian', 'Sovietly', 'grim', 'future', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'writer', 'scientist', 'trek', 'guided', 'stalker', 'Zone', 'center', 'said', 'be', 'room', 'where', 'one', 'come', 'true', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'novella', 'Boris', 'Arkady', 'Strugatsky', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'struck', 'how', 'different', 'two', 'are.Tarkovsky', 'denies', 'symbolism', 'films', 'case', 'then', 'not', 'subtext', 'spirituality', 'get', 'film', 'open', 'announcement', 'what', 'most', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'final', 'analysis', 'deeply', 'felt', 'spirituality', 'Not', 'science', 'spirituality', 'are', 'mutually', 'antagonistic', 'separate', 'issue', 'stalker', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Kaidonovsky', 'genuinely', 'heart-breaking', 'simplicity', 'openness', 'compared', 'intellectuality', 'cynicism', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'accompany', 'speculations', 'two', 'educated', 'men', 'engage', 'are', 'more', 'purely', 'philosophical', 'inherently', 'science', 'fictional', 'nature', 'Not', 'science', 'fiction', 'philosophy', 'are', 'mutually', 'antagonistic', 'either', 'What', 'most', 'film', 'intense', 'surreality', 'cinematography', 'possible', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'achingly', 'slow', 'cinematography', 'Tarkovsky', 'employ', 'then', 'sense', 'suspense', 'film', 'can', 'drum', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'amazing', 'Tarkovsky', 'plant', 'camera', 'physical', 'object', 'then', 'make', 'look', 'have', 'choice', 'decide', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something', 'more', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'Thus', 'Tarkovsky', 'look', 'world', 'visionary', 'way', 'even', 'most', 'banal', 'objects', 'start', 'take', 'ominous', 'significance', 'Elsewhere', 'Tarkovsky', 'having', 'characters', 'keep', 'looking', 'over', 'shoulders', 'camera', 'up', 'murderous', 'intent', 'off-angle.In', 'novella', 'Zone', 'place', 'where', 'laws', 'physics', 'are', 'broken', 'bent', 'simply', 'no', 'longer', 'apply', 'such', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'approach', 'Room', 'directly', 'even', 'just', 'field', 'must', 'approach', 'respect', 'going', 'long', 'way', 'Tarkovsky', 'non-Euclidean', 'reality', 'Zone', 'several', 'ways', 'one', 'shot', 'particular', 'breathtakingly', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'Stalker', 'stream', 'water', 'camera', 'then', 'straight', 'line', 'treating', 'phenomenally', 'gorgeous', 'still', 'life', 'submerged', 'objects', 'when', 'suddenly', 'stalker', 'back', 'view', 'Apparently', ""'ve"", 'somehow', 'gone', 'circle', 'seemed', 'line', 'vision', 'was', 'constantly', 'straight', 'way', 'blatantly', 'startling', 'matched', 'innumerable', 'other', 'details', 'film', 'Tarkovsky', 'ruthlessly', 'subtly', 'tweaks', 'things', 'keep', 'suspense', 'constantly', 'high', 'Tarkovsky', 'will', 'even', 'change', 'grains', 'film', 'stock', 'order', 'unsettle', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'at.Certainly', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'gorgeous', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'ever', 'also', 'meditation', 'nature', 'human', 'responsibility', 'remorse', 'Personally', 'find', 'Stalker', 'be', 'most', 'affectingly', 'drawn', 'Tarkovsky', 'protagonists', 'perhaps', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'openly', 'voice', 'Tarkovsky', 'own', 'intense', 'spirituality']",Stalker VHS

Stalkers are adventurous individuals who, for a proper payment, lead people to the Zone and to the mysterious Room at the heart of the Zone where your deepest wishes are allegedly granted. The film tells the story of one such Stalker, an ordinary man with a wife and a crippled daughter with the magic capacity of moving objects, who takes to the Zone two intellectuals, a Writer and a Scientist. When they finally reach the Room, they fail to pronounce their wishes because of their lack of faith, while Stalker himself seems to receive an answer to his wish that his daughter would get better.The journey is hazardous and Stalker is one of the few able to navigate.The subconscious sets up its own barriers and blocks to going straight to the Room.Tarkovsky has emptied the source novel,Roadside Picnic,of the abandoned technology of advanced aliens in the context of a fascistic state(the aliens,indifferent to the Earth,have left behind 7 Zones on the planet).He has placed into the centre of his film Man's spiritual quest,Man's dreams and desires.The film is a journey through the traps and pitfalls of the Zone.The Writer(Solinitsyn)searches for inspiration,the Scientist(Grinko) searches for truth.The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine, who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.This film is a masterpiece.The language of the Zone is the language of life.Tarkovsky uses chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and the Zone,physical reality from the subconscious.He utilises breath-taking long takes,mesmerising images and sounds, moments of surprise like the dog that crosses their path or the birds that fly up over the sand-dunes in the antechamber,the shaking ground.As Tarkovsky said,if you held a shot""a new quality emerges,a special intensity of attention.""There was a lot of heart-break in the making of this film,the first year's filming went to waste as the film-stock was not developed and another film was reshot in another country.Chemical pollution upsteam led to early deaths for Tarkovsky and his wife and a leading actor.The film is full of pulsating rhythm,dialogues and monologues of the travellers.It evokes the disasters of Chernobyl and Japan with forbidden zones.It contains the essence of great film-making,meditations on the soul,breathing in a much larger world,containing many subjects in one.",5,Epic journey into the interior,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,3429,"['Stalker', 'Tarkovsky', '2nd', 'incursion', 'SF', 'following', 'Solaris.There', 'inability', 'communicate', 'alien', 'force', 'had', 'drastic', 'effects', 'astronauts', 'subconscious', 'was', 'transfiguring.Here', 'following', 'crash', 'meteorite', 'alien', 'craft', '20', 'years', 'before', 'landscape', 'been', 'altered', 'so', 'Zone', ""n't"", 'obey', 'physical', 'laws', 'Earth', 'matter', 'warped', 'mysterious', 'dangerous', 'ways.The', 'Stalker', 'guide', 'people', 'wishing', 'enter', 'Zone', 'surrounded', 'soldiers', 'barbed', 'wire.The', 'mysterious', 'foreign', 'entity', 'left', 'industrial', 'debris', 'bleak', 'devastated', 'forbidden', 'landscape', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'disappear', 'Stalkers', 'are', 'adventurous', 'individuals', 'who', 'proper', 'payment', 'lead', 'people', 'Zone', 'mysterious', 'Room', 'heart', 'Zone', 'where', 'deepest', 'wishes', 'are', 'allegedly', 'granted', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'such', 'Stalker', 'ordinary', 'man', 'wife', 'crippled', 'daughter', 'magic', 'capacity', 'moving', 'objects', 'who', 'Zone', 'two', 'intellectuals', 'Writer', 'Scientist', 'When', 'finally', 'reach', 'Room', 'fail', 'pronounce', 'wishes', 'lack', 'faith', 'Stalker', 'receive', 'answer', 'wish', 'daughter', 'would', 'get', 'better.The', 'journey', 'hazardous', 'Stalker', 'one', 'few', 'able', 'navigate.The', 'subconscious', 'sets', 'up', 'own', 'barriers', 'blocks', 'going', 'straight', 'Room.Tarkovsky', 'emptied', 'source', 'novel', 'Roadside', 'Picnic', 'abandoned', 'technology', 'advanced', 'aliens', 'context', 'fascistic', 'state', 'aliens', 'indifferent', 'Earth', 'have', 'left', '7', 'Zones', 'planet', '.He', 'placed', 'centre', 'film', 'Man', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'Man', 'dreams', 'desires.The', 'film', 'journey', 'traps', 'pitfalls', 'Zone.The', 'Writer', 'Solinitsyn', 'inspiration', 'Scientist', 'Grinko', 'truth.The', 'Stalker', 'been', 'trained', 'renowned', 'stalker', 'named', 'Porcupine', 'who', 'excursion', 'brother', 'Zone', 'returned', 'alone', 'infinitely', 'wealthy', 'only', 'commit', 'suicide', 'week', 'later', 'Soon', 'evident', 'reaching', 'Zone', 'not', 'greatest', 'impediment', 'uncertainty', 'deepest', 'wish', 'men', 'approach', 'threshold', 'Room', 'fear', 'trepidation', 'materialization', 'answered', 'prayers', 'profound', 'revelation', 'self-discovery.This', 'film', 'masterpiece.The', 'language', 'Zone', 'language', 'life.Tarkovsky', 'uses', 'chromatic', 'shifts', 'delineate', 'outside', 'world', 'Zone', 'physical', 'reality', 'subconscious.He', 'breath-taking', 'long', 'mesmerising', 'images', 'sounds', 'moments', 'surprise', 'dog', 'path', 'birds', 'fly', 'up', 'sand-dunes', 'antechamber', 'shaking', 'ground.As', 'Tarkovsky', 'said', 'held', 'shot', 'new', 'quality', 'special', 'intensity', 'attention', 'was', 'lot', 'heart-break', 'making', 'film', 'first', 'year', 'filming', 'went', 'waste', 'film-stock', 'was', 'not', 'developed', 'film', 'was', 'reshot', 'country.Chemical', 'pollution', 'upsteam', 'led', 'early', 'deaths', 'Tarkovsky', 'wife', 'leading', 'actor.The', 'film', 'full', 'pulsating', 'rhythm', 'dialogues', 'monologues', 'travellers.It', 'disasters', 'Chernobyl', 'Japan', 'forbidden', 'zones.It', 'essence', 'great', 'film-making', 'meditations', 'soul', 'breathing', 'much', 'larger', 'world', 'containing', 'many', 'subjects', 'one']",Stalker VHS
329375,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,6302719666,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[11, 14]","As with all of his other films, Tarkovsky is the true author of Stalker.  This film is loosely based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Road Side Picnic, and Tarkovsky tried, as he did with Solaris (1972), to downplay the science fiction aspect of Stalker.  Except for a brief explanation at the beginning of the film, Tarkovsky chooses to ignore the speculations as to what could have created The Zone, and the changes within it.  He changed the Strugastsky brother's characters and events almost unrecognizably, as he had done previously with the characters and events in Lem's Solaris, and he shifted the philosophical implications of the story in a more pleasant direction.  Nevertheless, many of the original details of the novel remain.  Stalker is definitely a science fiction film, but its style is unlike that of the pulp and high-tech films, such as the Star Wars Trilogy (1977 - 1983).  It is a very demanding and sometimes inaccessible viewing experience.This magnificent film almost did not see the light of day.  As the exteriors were being shot (for some three and a half months in Tallinn, Estonia, beginning in May 1977, Tarkovsky encountered a number of problems, starting with some serious disagreements with key members of his crew, but mostly from the bad processing of the apparently out-of-date film stock.  These events led to a serious financial problem, which somehow, almost miraculously, got resolved.  Eventually, in June 1978, a second shooting in Tallinn took place, with the interiors being shot in Moscow, and the premiere took place in May, 1979, to total official disapproval.  The film met with some recognition in the USSR, toward 1981, following its success at the Cannes Festival in 1980, where it was awarded the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.With Stalker, Tarkovsky marks the shift toward his later style, with the long takes throughout the film averaging one minute in length, with many which are four minutes or longer.  The scene in the ""telephone room"" lasts almost seven minutes.  These long scenes in turn rely heavily on the talent of the actors to sustain the mood, like Writer's long monologue in the sand mogul room.  Even in a succession of single shots, the Director wants to give the impression of a long take, such as in the ride into The Zone on the flatbed car, which lasts three and a half minutes and actually consists of five shots.In Stalker, Tarkovsky is definitely more systematic with his use of black-and-white (sepia) and color stocks than he had been in his previous works.  A sickly black-and-sepia is reserved for the polluted and sterile reality of the world of the future, while color represents the escape from this world provided by The Zone.  In the swamp scene and ""Stalker""'s dream, Tarkovsky reverts to is more usual convention, where dreams are shown in black-and-sepia-tones, and reality in color. However, the last scene is in color, implying a leakage of the powers of The Zone into the outside reality.As always in Tarkovsky's films, the natural world is present.  Water, which used to be the source of life, a redemptive force and a center of regeneration, is now mostly a symbol of decay and pollution.  Often, the men wade through stagnant water, and when clear water flows, it flows over the rusting, decaying remnants of props of civilization: coins, weapons, religious images, hypodermic needles.  The only exception is in the dream scene in the swamp, where the water is somewhat restored to its positive, life-affirming symbols.  In the last scene in The Zone, the men, resigned to their limitations and weakness, sit outside The Room as the rain falls inside, gently blocking them from entering.The wind, often associated with the spiritual aspects of life, ominously rises when Writer walks directly toward The Room, and he is told to stop.  The earth is a positive force, and upon arriving in The Zone, ""Stalker""'s first act is to lie down and embrace it, and in the swamp, all three men lie upon it.  Like a miracle, there is the luxuriant, if dangerous, Nature ever-present in the Zone, in contrast to the polluted outside world, where it is totally absent.  Birds are part of this Nature: the call of the cuckoo bird is heard numerous times in The Zone.There is also the mysterious dog, which first appears in the swamp scene, when all three men are lying down, becoming intimately close to the earth.  Up to this point, the men felt totally alienated from their environment, outside and inside The Zone, and it is at the very moment when they start to meditate and remember, that the dog appears: The Zone is its territory.  But at the end of the film, the dog has followed ""Stalker"" outside the Zone, showing that even there, the hope that the men were looking for inside The Zone must somehow also exist here, outside, as the dog establishes its own space even though he becomes domesticated in the process.Although Tarkovsky usually favors classics by such composers as Bach, Pergolesi, or Purcell, the musical score in Stalker consists almost exclusively of Eduard Artemiev's electronic music mixed with some folk melodies, contributing efficiently to the eerie atmosphere of the film. There are also few distorted musical fragments from Wagner, Ravel, and Beethoven.Two of Tarkovsky's favorite actors are Nikolia Grinko and Anatoly Solonitsyn.  They appear in five (Grinko) and four (Solonitsyn) of Tarkovsky's Russian films, including Stalker.  Their performances as two lost souls in search of an answer are convincing.  Aleksandr Kajdanovsky is outstanding in his role of a tormented and somewhat pathetic ""Stalker"".  Although Alisa Frejndlikh's appearance in the film is restricted to only few scenes, she is a powerful presence, especially with her monologue at the end of the film.In Stalker, Tarkovsky juxtaposes a world in decline, polluted and sterile, with a verdant Zone, which has overtaken all human enterprises, as shown by the remnants of rusting cars and tanks, dilapidated buildings, which have been taken over by the luxuriant vegetation. He portrays a society which has severed all links with nature, with its own past, and, as a result, lost its spiritual and moral bearings.Stalker explores the conflict between science, rationalism, materialism, and cynicism versus spirituality, faith, art, and love.  The three men embody different philosophical principles.  In the beginning of the film, Professor justifies his going into The Zone as pure scientific curiosity, and probably also to reassure himself that The Room's so-called ""miracles"" can, if they ever happened, be examined through the scientific method and explained in a logical, reasonable way.  Professor is a rational being who tries to understand the world according to the law of physics.  However, when he arrives at The Room, Professor divulges his ulterior motive, which is to destroy it with the bomb he was carrying all along in his knapsack.  In doing so, he would remove the incentive for people to visit The Room with irrational hopes, and because ""this place obviously won't bring anybody happiness.""  By blowing up the Room, Professor will stop gangsters, tyrants, megalomaniacs, and all ""the self-appointed benefactors of the human race"" from misusing The Room's power.  But his main reason to blow up The Room is that he does not understand it.Writer belongs to those people who cannot accept the world as it is.  He is well aware of humanity's decay and of his own as well, but he abhors science, which he does not understand, and would rather look for answers in the supernatural. Writer believes in the redemptive power of art, but he has lost his inspiration.  He would like to believe in the potential of The Room to restore it, but because of his cynicism and self-loathing, he cannot be sure.  He has lost faith in himself and in his writing's capacity to help other people.  Besides, he hates writing, which is for him a torture.""Stalker"" is alone in showing an inclination toward faith, with his comments regarding Nature and his prayer for his companions to ""become helpless like children.""  ""Stalker"" knows The Zone, and he has total faith in The Zone.  He speaks about it as if it were a living being. ""Stalker"" simultaneously respects and fears The Zone, as he recognizes its potential to provide comfort to the wretched ones who, like himself, have lost all hope, but at the same time it punishes whoever transgresses its rules.  This is, of course, how most religious people see their own Gods. The film contains many Christian images and biblical references, but it would be a mistake to take them in a Christian context:  they stand in a general framework of faith and spirituality.The redemptive power of love is personified by ""Stalker""'s wife.  Her love and devotion is the final miracle which opposes cynicism and the emptiness of the modern world.  All these ideas are clearly expressed at the film's end, as she addresses the audience with her heartfelt monologue, while at the same time asking her husband to remember the love she feels for him.As the three characters reach The Room, they can ask for their dearest wishes to be granted, but this would require a painful and searching self-examination, with the realization that what they thought they wanted was not exactly what they now really want. ""You dream of one thing but you get quite another,"" observes Writer.  The film began with the question, ""Will the three men enter The Room?"" and it ends with, ""Why won't the three men enter The Room?""  Professor's true aim was to destroy The Room, which was beyond his scientific understanding.  Now he is forced to consider that there may be a mystery that his Cartesian mind cannot account for.  He shows some humility and acknowledges that it is not up to him to save humanity from itself.  Writer had said that the purpose of his journey was to regain his genius, his inspiration.  However, on the threshold of The Room, he realizes that he may not worthy of accepting The Room's gift.  While he had previously expressed his unworthiness, he now for the first time truly feels it.  As a result of their journey, both men have changed -- some would say for the better -- and although they do not enter The Room, they nevertheless receive its gifts, something quite different than what they expected.  ""Stalker"", however, asks for nothing of The Room because he is a stalker, and stalkers do not enter The Room.  However, ""Stalker"" has faith in The Zone, and does not need reassurances. He is in touch with his ""self,"" aware of his own wretchedness, and his only purpose in making the trip is to guide to faith and hope those more wretched than he.Musical fragments of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" in the last sequence, struggling to be heard over the rumble of a passing train, imply a society in decay and the unsettled nature of the film's resolution.  This ending of the film is typically Tarkovskian, in so far as it is open-ended, and deliberately ambiguous, leaving the viewer to create his or her own meaning of the film.",5,Arguably the best of

It's the time between three and four in the morning. You can't sleep and all you can see is the troubles, and the problems, and the ways that your life should have gone, but didn't. All you can hear is the sound of your own heart. At times like this, my father used to take one large glass of vodka before bed, to keep the wolf away he said. Then he would take three very small drinks of vodka, just in case she had cubs while she was waiting outside.""I think we all have hours like these, maybe at a different time as the one mentioned above, but nevertheless. When in such moments hope seems far off and the beating of your heart is not the knock on a door that is opened as a result offering a new perspective, no, if all doors remain closed and the wolf has not left your house for a long time, wouldn't it be wonderful if there were a place, where hope is reborn and wishes fulfilled?You say, there is no such place, but there is. You have to go to a place in Russia, strictly off limits to anyone, guarded on the periphery by soldiers, in short almost impossible to get to.In all likelihood you'll give up on the plan, already ridiculed by friends and acquaintances, since there's no way to get past the soldiers, the road blocks and even if you do succeed, where exactly do you go, because there are no maps of this area where the house is supposed to be located where hope lost can be found again.That is, unless you know a guide, who knows how to get around the obstacles ... his name is Stalker and the area ominously known as ""The Zone"" he knows like his back pocket. It's the place where he is happy and where each time he makes the trip puts his life at risk.We get to know his most recent companions in this Tarkovsky masterpiece as a burnt out and cynical writer and a scientist who seems extremely focused on his backpack. Stalker informs them that the Zone has its own laws and you can't get from A to B in a straight line or the Zone will punish you and therefore Stalker uses screws tied to handkerchiefs and throws them haphazardly and wherever it lands, that's their next destination.What follows is a surreal and philosophical journey to the deepest truth to each of the three men, who are , every one for his own reasons, men without hope, that desperately need to find the Room to find an answer to their desperation.It will turn out to be Stalker's most difficult journey, which as never before will put to the test the meaning of his endeavors to the Zone as to his entire existence.The movie Stalker is a work of art difficult to put into words. It is a journey, an exploration of the deepest layers of your being, with half the time not even knowing exactly why. If you allow the movie to take you along, you will experience a journey that is unique which will confront you with difficult questions like the ancient one concerning the meaning of life or whether science has impoverished us to such a degree that the sound of wind in the trees and grass dancing to its rhythm will not make us stop in breathless expectation and that maybe hopelessness has already spread so widely, that the well of wishes has dried up long ago.The images are of a unique beauty and visual poetry unequalled, supported by the intriguing electronic music of Artemyev (who also wrote the music to Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"").Kaidanowsky as the title character is amazing to look at and the Zone itself will bind you in its spell and make an indelible impression.A journey between black and white and color, science and nature, fear and hope.See it ...

329378,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,6302719666,Wayne A.,"[23, 26]","I love the trash review directly below! And I always stupidly thought it was drugs and sophomoric attitudes that made films like this impossible for some people.Working with next to nothing, Tarkovsky conjures up a unique film experience. Imagine a visually magical film about the search for the Grail filmed in someones backyard--it's kind of like that. In some respects it's a bit like Godard's Alphaville...but only in some. It's certainly not a film to ""get,"" but one to get lost in and I think that's why it frustrates a lot of viewers who sometimes think every intelligent film is a puzzle that needs to be worked out. Some film-goers need to understand that one can't always be poetic and linear/literal (I say ""can't always"" to be ironic). Hard point to make in the world's most unpoetical linear/literal society.Tarkovsky is a master of the tangential, the sublime, the surreal--anything but the direct. I've watched this film nearly a dozen times and I can't tell you what most of it is about--especially the ending (which is utterly devastating and quite beautiful). Well, that's not totally true, I've a fair idea what it's vaguely about; in some ways the meaning's as clear as French criticism. It's just elusive too, because people's souls are slippery eels, and souls seem to be an obsession with Tarkovsky.I'd put hard money on this being a great film but it's tough to prove it, especially using the Procrustean critical and analytical tools we find scattered around the garage today (The ""Boring-ometer,"" or the ""Left-handed PC Gauge"") People who strongly dislike it seem to be of two camps: one is the sort of ADD group that can't handle long, slow movies with little visceral stimulation; it's a valid lifestyle for many but insufficient grounds for condemning anything*. The other camp consists of a type that's been with us since the cave man or woman discoverer of the wheel was given one star on Amazon.rock for creating a pointless spinning thing that made folks dizzy. There's no response available to complaints that a complex, advanced, or visionary work of art is ""boring,"" ""artsy,"" or ""pretentious."" The reviewer is writing--quite validly and no irony intended--to his or her equals and they should listen keenly. My dog, Alphonse, once reviewed a Beethoven symphony and described it as ""meaningless and annoying low-frequency noise with no hope of dinner or treat implied in its raucous ending"" and since that was published (in The New Yorker, no less!) no other dog has bothered to listen to the ""Eroica."" My cat hates paintings by Mondrian because the artist didn't leave enough texture on the canvas to sharpen ones nails on. The mice, however, love Pollock. To each according to their needs and abilities.[* I recently suggested to the Turner folks that since colorizing worked so well to bring boring old black and white films to the attention of the easily distracted (Or ""Differently Attentive"" as the PC folks say), that we should, uh, ""stimulize"" slow-moving old films. This would involve say, adding footage of car crashes and explosions, maybe even a graphic decapitation to ""Twelve Angry Men"" or re-editing ""Jane Eyre"" so that it looked like an MTV video. We could easily digitally minimize clothing so that ""Miracle on 42nd Street"" could get an R rating and an audience.

329379,A27XZS1UKWJY7F,6302719666,"William Hermann ""Willy""","[6, 8]","Having finally come to love Solaris, I set out to watch other Tarkovsky films. This being one of his other most popular, and also a science fiction tale, it was decreed to be next. We open with a slow reveal of a grimy room in sepia photography--even now we can marvel at the richness and texture of the images. After some loooong credits, a quote from a fictitious Nobel Prize winner about The Zone: No one knows whether it was caused by a meteorite or was created by aliens, but it is acknowledged as a miracle. Originally they sent in police to investigate, but they never returned. Since then The Zone has been cordoned off and all access forbidden. It is said that in the room at the center of The Zone one's innermost wish will come true. This has led to the employ of Stalkers, people who lead others in for money, but never enter the room. By the way, the word ""stalker"" is meant in its original sense, that is, one who approaches something very carefully and steadily.So the camera slowly enters a room where a couple is sleeping. We pan at a glacial pace left across the sleeping couple, then slowly back. The man wakes and tries to slip out, but his wife wakes and berates him for leaving again. She says he's addicted to The Zone, isn't thinking of her and their daughter--who was born with defects as stalkers' children often are--and will be sent be sent back to prison. He replies that to him, everywhere is a prison. He leaves, and his wife falls to the floor, writhing in a highly sensual emotional agony.A couple waits by a nasty shipyard. The man, who we'll know as the Writer, complains that everything in life is so boring and he has lost his engagement with reality long ago. Again, the photography is gorgeous and impeccably composed: for example, look at the frame below. You have the couple in front of this beautiful jumble of old ships in the distant mist, with a tree dividing the frame toward the left. Much of the movie is just unbelievably gorgeous like this, with shots as composed, rich and textured as paintings. The first part of the movie also lays out this reality as a dank, nasty, polluted nightmare world.The stalker takes the Writer to meet the Professor, the other guy he'll be escorting into the Zone today. The Writer, who, it must be said, is a trifle bitter, makes a speech about how a treasured antique in a museum might have been just a slop bowl when it was produced and used, and defrauded ""all those connoisseurs."" Yep, life is dead to him--and he won't shut up about it. The Writer is also cut off from life and unable to write. So this happy bunch set off in a jeep to enter the zone and have their wish fulfilled [I want a pony!] and maybe find something to live for again.They drive through this incredibly evocative deserted industrial city--they obviously have some super-powerful fog machines at their disposal--while the Writer shares his many thoughts on how life totally sucks. I used to think I was bitter. They spot a train being let into the big gate to the zone, and rush their jeep in after it, drawing machine gun fire from the guards. Once inside they are safe--from the guards, at least--because no one would dare venture in.In the zone, the photography switches to vivid color, although it too is a green wasteland, littered with hulks of abandoned cars, tanks and buildings. It's kind of amazing the low-burning tension this film is able to create while moving at such a slow pace, something those who found themselves getting into Solaris will be familiar with. This one is, comparatively, a total edge-of-your-seat thriller, however.As they proceed the Stalker keeps warning them about the various terrible things that can happen to them if they wander off alone or try to hurry--yet nothing ever happens. He says that the place is constantly rearranging itself, and that ""no one comes out the same way they came in."" He ties ribbons to steels nuts and throws them ahead in their path, to make sure it's safe to go that way. Soon the writer starts to think the Stalker is just full of stuff--this is his basic view of humanity anyway--and wants to hurry off on his own. The Stalker becomes quite impassioned about how they must listen to him... apparently the personalities of the people one is traveling with affect one's visit, the obstacles one faces, and suchlike. They regroup, continue on, and this is the end of part one.The Writer is getting nastier and nastier, and they're all starting to hate each other. The Professor has smuggled in instruments to measure the Zone, which the Stalker thinks is just so much silliness. These two do not seem to grasp the mystical nature of the Zone, which the Stalker laments. They lay down to sleep, and the Writer starts up his philosophical musings on how the world is crap and people are rotten, causing the Professor to tell him to shut up and ""Keep your complexes to yourself."" The Writer then says he just wants to say one more thing... and starts on another bitter monologue on another topic. Then we have an absolutely gorgeous slow track up a stream, looking at various little objects embedded in the stream, then a slow track back. The whole shot lasts three minutes.SPOILERS > > >They continue. At a certain point they have to go through a tunnel, which the Stalker says is very dangerous and refers to as ""the meat grinder,"" but nothing at all dangerous happens. The Writer was asked to go first, however, a fact that he is very bitter about. The Professor has brought a gun, they now find out, and when a phone suddenly rings, he answers it and indicates that he's going to cause some trouble when they finally reach the room. The Stalker is all psychologically anguished that people could be so nasty, bitter and cynical. They finally reach the threshold of the room.They are warned that the room will grant their innermost wish, which may not be the best thing. For example, a previous fellow who went in had a wish that in some way required the death of his brother to make possible, and the wishee ended up killing himself a week later for guilt. They ask the Writer to go in first, but had to go through the tunnel first and he's not gonna go. So they ask the Professor to go, and he reveals that he has a bomb. He's going to destroy the room, because it might one day fall into the wrong hands. They have a physical and verbal fight for the bomb, but the Stalker can't get it, causing him more anguish, since the promise of the Zone is ""all the people of this Earth have left.""They talk. Eventually the Professor disassembles the bomb and throws it away. They all sit down together, and it starts raining inside, into a pool of water in the foreground. We see a fish near the detonator, and then a black pool of oil spreads over the water.Now we are back in the bar, the men having returned. A black dog that they saw in the Zone has returned with the Stalker. He goes home and laments the soul-deadness of the two men, how you can't choose the personalities of who you travel with, and that people should be so without hope. His wife says that he should pity them, but he seems to take it very personally, that they cannot appreciate the gift he would have given them. We never find out if they made it into the room, but I came away feeling like they all just waited outside.The Stalker's wife then makes a speech, to the camera, about how difficult it is to love a Stalker, what with him being emotionally distant and the time in jail and the mutant children and all--Girls, it ain't easy. Then we see their daughter wandering around, having to use crutches. She sits down at a table as we hear the sound of a train going by--like in the first scene of the film--and she stares at three glasses, sliding them across a table, apparently with her mind, until one falls off. The end.&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDIt was very poetic. I think one has to consider it more as a visual poem than anything, and the reasons I say that is that it unfolds with a number of beautiful images and evocative ideas, none of which come to any definite point or statement, but which define the ideas, and the act of experiencing and processing them, as the point. The images are held so long [the movie is 163 minutes and there are only 142 shots] that in a way you stop paying attention to what is ""happening"" and enter into a subconscious haze, where several interesting thoughts play through your mind: dreary lives in squalor without hope, bitterness and the inability to escape it, having to submit oneself to a higher power, not being able to choose your companions, your combined personalities creating your experience, and more. One spends the entire movie thinking something is just about to happen, but one doesn't really resent the movie when it doesn't, since the whole journey WAS the experience.Apparently much of the exteriors were shot in Tallin, Estonia, where there is now a plaque up commemorating this movie's production. Tarkovsky shot all of the exteriors with one cinematographer, whom he had a rather troubled relationship with, then later discovered that all of his footage, a year's worth of work, was damaged and unusable. This apparently almost caused the director a nervous breakdown. He began again with another cinematographer, and interestingly, people who have seen both say that the footage was virtually identical. Ultimately it ended up taking three years to finish the film. Some see it as prophetic of Chernobyl, where you have another Russian Zone that is cordoned off and cannot be visited.This film ends up being strikingly thematically similar to Solaris, in structure and topic. There is a prologue in a dreary real world where the characters are set up, then they venture into a place where the rules of nature are suspended, and they are forced to take a deep journey into their minds and emotions. One could see the planet is Solaris as granting wishes, like the room is said to do here. The personalities of the primary people involved, three men in both cases, create the circumstances they have to deal with. Both films end with them returning, in a sense, to the environment of the beginning, with vastly different perspectives, based on their experience. In retrospect, Solaris has a little more of a hook, but this one is perhaps richer and more rewarding, and also has much greater visual variety.Anyway, certainly a specialized taste, and a film that will bore the eyelids off people who aren't prepared for how very slow Tarkovsky can be, but one that that is thoughtful and beautiful and very much worth watching.It's undeniably very good, but also extremely esoteric and most people will probably not want to sit through it.",5,Must love Solaris,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,10700,"['Having', 'finally', 'come', 'love', 'Solaris', 'set', 'out',

The good news is that there's plenty to keep me coming back.Action: not a lot. Effects: an alternation of B&W; and color photography - in other words, not a lot. Plot: not a lot, and cryptic. What really hit me, more than any other movie I've seen lately, was the visuals. It opens in a decrepit tenement that rattles every time a train goes by. Everything is a montonous montone, not sepia but a plain, decayed brown. Somehow, Tarkovksy gives that imagery an edge like broken glass.The Stalker (more of a ""pathfinder"", with allusions to Last of the Mohicans) leads people into the forbidden Zone. Once in, the world's acid monochrome turns into a colored, pastoral scene. Plenty of mystery remains, though: the preternatural senses of the Stalker, and ruins and rubble of some forgotten human habitation. It's a sustained image that the world could barely have imagined before the Chernobyl poisoned so many hundreds of square kilometers: devastation and ruin, complete depopulation, but no touch of violence. Simply the exile of every human, with every human thing vanishing slowly under layers of time. But something is in there - maybe the most important thing in the world. Maybe only the Stalker's daughter knows.More goes unsaid than said, and much of the the action exists only in the minds of the characters. This movie doesn't give any easy answers about itself. It gives enough, though, and I expect it to give more as I study it more. And I will.//wiredweird",5,"Baffling.

329381,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,6302719666,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[1, 2]","STALKER is truly the masterpiece of Tarkovsky.  If Andrei Rublev was an exploration of the spiritual artistic suffering of mankind, and if SOLARIS was the exploration of science's inability to ever know what is REAL, and what is not, then STALKER is the combination of both themes.  This film is not about a Stalker, who might follow you around town. This is a STALKER, in the exact sense that there used to be TRIP LEADERS, when a group of people would gather for a spiritual LSD experience.  One person was experienced with THE TRIP, and would lead neophytes thru the maze of illusions, and delusions, looking for that ultimate experience of reality.  This movie works, in many ways, like a psychedelic drug trip, tho there is almost nothing psychedelic about it, in the way most people think of a ""psychedelic"" film, unless that film were ERAISERHEAD. The common motif is the way Lynch used an expanded sense of TIME in his film, to disorientate the viewer.  Time is expanded and stretched all thru THE STALKER. Likewise Space constantly changes from normal vectors and straight lines, to spirals and fractal images. Its as strange as anything from SOLARIS, and as emotional as RUBLEV is.First off, Tarkovsky's idiomatic artistic devices, are perfected here. The film is Black and white when you are in THE WORLD, and color, when you are in THE ZONE.  The Zone is an off limits area of the world, where an alien intelligence landed THE ROOM like an asteroid. Around THE ROOM arose THE ZONE, which is beyond human conscousness, beyond causality and reality. In these middle parts of the film what is, and what COULD be, combines, and dissolves, and recombines again.  The STALKERS who lead you thru THE ZONE,  are all criminals. Government placed an iron curtain placed around THE ZONE, after suffering great losses trying to attack the ROOM. Still, people enter THE ZONE to reach THE ROOM which grants your INNERMOST WISH.  Some people try and succeed, others die trying. Because there is a menacing danger, more scary than ANY vampire in cinematic history. For who can live with their INNERMOST WISH (subconscous desires) made real? Who is that strong? Who knows what their own heart most wishes to own? In the film, this isnt a philosophical question, but a burning question facing the men before THE ROOM. THE STALKER, who represents a priest, leads THE PROFESSOR and THE WRITER, who represent SCIENCE and ART, to a place beyond human understanding, much like God is.  But knowing this analogy does NOTHING to clarify the film's intent. Instead, if the film has any intention, its to give yourself up to the journey to your innermost desires. Because like all great art, its a journey inside your heart and brain.  In that sense THE ZONE is the esthetic experience, and THE ROOM is artwork. Like a great poem, its all up to you what it means.Nothing about the film states a time period, except for a future where all is grey and lifeless, where hope and faith is lost. (THE STALKER often bemoans this fact, like a priest.) The film seems to proceed slower than it does, because so many shots are closer to still art photography. The ""false - energy"" of moving camera cinematography, like in those shaky ""cinema verite"" hand helt video camera angles, or tracking shots, is exchanged for a static, inner stillness with the cinematic viewpoint. Also, the script has periods of spoken poetry in the film, along with a very industrial, minimalistic drone type soundtrack. The KLANGKLANG of trains on rails, is the rythymic backround of JOURNEYING. THE STALKER hears the train sound of journeying, even when he wishes most to escape the journey. Like ERAISERHEAD,  ambient sounds are amplified, and distorted, to give the sense of the hell of modern industrial citylife.  If you can absorb poetry, or read philosophy, or meditate, then you will enjoy this film.  This film works thru a meditation on your innermost desires, and what YOU WOULD DO to realize them. Since the film's basic concept centers on alien intelligence, and how it can manifest your deepest desires, you have SCIENCE FICTION. ( IT's the same concept as SOLARIS.)  Most Tarkovsky's films explore the intersect between art, philosophy and religion.  If you look for it, you will find it. When you find it, it lasts inside your heart a lifetime. Popcorn adventure films might bring you to the edge of your seat when you watch them, but a year later, you wont remember the title of the film.  If you watch STALKER, you will never forget it.",5,Even TIMOPHY LEARY couldnt lead you on this trip to ZONE.,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,4507,"['STALKER', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'Tarkovsky', 'Andrei', 'Rublev', 'was', 'exploration', 'spiritual', 'artistic', 'suffering', 'mankind', 'SOLARIS', 'was', 'exploration', 'science', 'inability', 'ever', 'know', 'what', 'REAL', 'what', 'not', 'then', 'STALKER', 'combination', 'themes', 'film', 'not', 'Stalker', 'who', 'might', 'follow', 'town', 'STALKER', 'exact', 'sense', 'there', 'used', 'be', 'TRIP', 'LEADERS', 'when', 'group', 'people', 'would', 'gather', 'spiritual', 'LSD', 'experience', 'One', 'person', 'was', 'experienced', 'TRIP', 'would', 'lead', 'neophytes', 'maze', 'illusions', 'delusions', 'looking', 'ultimate', 'experience', 'reality', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'psychedelic', 'drug', 'trip', 'tho', 'almost', 'nothing', 'psychedelic', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'psychedelic', 'film', 'film', 'were', 'ERAISERHEAD', 'common', 'motif', 'way', 'Lynch', 'used', 'expanded', 'sense', 'TIME', 'film', 'disorientate', 'viewer', 'Time', 'expanded', 'stretched', 'thru', 'STALKER', 'Likewise', 'Space', 'constantly', 'normal', 'vectors', 'straight', 'lines', 'spirals', 'fractal', 'images', 'as', 'strange', 'anything', 'SOLARIS', 'as', 'emotional', 'RUBLEV', 'is.First', 'off', 'Tarkovsky', 'idiomatic', 'artistic', 'devices', 'are', 'perfected', 'here', 'film', 'Black', 'white', 'when', 'are', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'color', 'when', 'are', 'THE', 'ZONE', 'Zone', 'off', 'limits', 'area', 'world', 'where', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'landed', 'THE', 'ROOM', 'asteroid', 'THE', 'ROOM', 'arose', 'THE', 'ZONE', 'human', 'conscousness', 'causality', 'reality', 'middle', 'parts', 'film', 'what', 'what', 'COULD', 'be', 'combines', 'dissolves', 'recombines', 'again', 'STALKERS', 'who', 'lead', 'thru', 'ZONE', 'are', 'criminals', 'Government', 'placed', 'iron', 'curtain', 'placed', 'THE', 'ZONE', 'suffering', 'great', 'losses', 'trying', 'attack', 'ROOM', 'Still', 'people', 'enter', 'ZONE', 'reach', 'THE', 'ROOM', 'INNERMOST', 'WISH', 'people', 'try', 'succeed', 'others', 'die', 'trying', 'menacing', 'danger', 'more', 'scary', 'ANY', 'vampire', 'cinematic', 'history', 'who', 'can', 'live', 'INNERMOST', 'WISH', 'subconscous', 'desires', 'made', 'real', 'Who', 'strong', 'Who', 'what', 'own', 'heart', 'most', 'wishes', 'own', 'film', 'philosophical', 'question', 'burning', 'question', 'facing', 'men', 'ROOM', 'THE', 'STALKER', 'who', 'priest', 'THE', 'PROFESSOR', 'THE', 'WRITER', 'who', 'represent', 'SCIENCE', 'ART', 'place', 'human', 'understanding', 'much', 'God', 'knowing', 'analogy', 'NOTHING', 'clarify', 'film', 'intent', 'Instead', 'film', 'intention', 'give', 'up', 'journey', 'innermost', 'desires', 'great', 'art', 'journey', 'heart', 'brain', 'sense', 'ZONE', 'esthetic', 'experience', 'THE', 'ROOM', 'artwork', 'great', 'poem', 'up', 'what', 'means.Nothing', 'film', 'time', 'period', 'future', 'where', 'grey', 'lifeless', 'where', 'hope', 'faith', 'lost', 'STALKER', 'often', 'fact', 'priest', 'film', 'proceed', 'slower', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'closer', 'still', 'art', 'photography', 'false', 'energy', 'moving', 'camera', 'cinematography', 'shaky', 'cinema', 'verite', 'hand', 'helt', 'video', 'camera', 'tracking', 'shots', 'exchanged', 'static', 'inner', 'stillness', 'cinematic', 'viewpoint', 'Also', 'script', 'periods', 'spoken', 'poetry', 'film', 'very', 'industrial', 'minimalistic', 'drone', 'type', 'soundtrack', 'KLANGKLANG', 'trains', 'rails', 'rythymic', 'backround', 'JOURNEYING', 'THE', 'STALKER', 'train', 'sound', 'journeying', 'even', 'when', 'most', 'escape', 'journey', 'ERAISERHEAD', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'are', 'amplified', 'distorted', 'give', 'sense', 'hell', 'modern', 'industrial', 'citylife', 'can', 'absorb', 'poetry', 'read', 'philosophy', 'meditate', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'film', 'thru', 'meditation', 'innermost', 'desires', 'what', 'YOU', 'WOULD', 'DO', 'realize', 'film', 'basic', 'concept', 'centers', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'how', 'can', 'manifest', 'deepest', 'desires', 'have', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'IT', 'same', 'concept', 'SOLARIS', 'Most', 'Tarkovsky', 'films', 'explore', 'intersect', 'art', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'look', 'will', 'find', 'When', 'find', 'heart', 'lifetime', 'Popcorn', 'adventure', 'films', 'might', 'bring', 'edge', 'seat', 'when', 'watch', 'year', 'later', 'wont', 'remember', 'title', 'film', 'watch', 'STALKER', 'will', 'never', 'forget']",Stalker VHS

High, rusty fences that only seem to be put there to keep people boldly out, and not savely in.Degenerated panorama's and desolate scenes of scourched, withered remains of culture and society. Troubled pools of water with behind it a skyline of blackened factories and concrete buildings filled with hissing, steaming machines.On and on. On and on.Next... rundown houses, earth covering earth, puddles of black water and oozing mud. Houses without recognizable facades. Bars with stools you cannot easily sit on. Dank, hysterical poetry.Outside soldiers march on, their backs crooked or even broken, burdend by the smog of unconceivable dreams.Within the interiors of one of those many anonym bars, chilly, colourless shadows. They hide three faces. That of a scientist, that of a writer, and that of Stalker.They look at each other. Not really being there. Not really loking at each other. More looking past one another, staring into some unknown empty, sun-ridden void.They ponder, wander around in their own autistic minds. That they will soon enter ""The Zone"", a forbidden place beyond the vast desolate plains, is clear to them, but they are in no way arroused. No extasy, no emotion. Deadpan cries of Angst, of an omniscient feel of extensialim.

329383,A25JBPU5G0C29H,6302719666,Zev Bazarov,"[17, 19]","This 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film, a favorite among his fans, is all philosophy in a story of three men searching for meaning in their lives in a hellish environment. Truth, motive, art, meaning, purpose, reason, selfishness, hope, soul, belief, are all examined here. The story focusses on three men. They are called Stalker, Professor and Writer. The Professor and Writer have hired the Stalker to take them to the guarded Zone, where mysterious hidden forces influence the area. In the heart of the Zone is a room, where any wish will be granted. The three men, have to overcome various physical, mental, and social problems among themselves to reach the room. They discuss, debate, and reflect on their world and situation, and philosophize on the room, and the mysterious forces in the world, and their place in it. What will this journey hold for them, and the room, waiting, offer to them? What do they really wish for, and what will it mean to the rest of mankind? And why does the Stalker bring others to the room, but he does not enter?So many questions are raised in this interesting sci-fi analysis of human existence. The film is long and slow, but nevertheless, the ideas are fascinating, and are a real treat to see laid out masterfully by Tarkovsky, in images, words, and music, within an entertaining story. The film is emotional, and as in other Tarkovsky's films, he creates an experience in you, and warps your views of the world, and offers so much more than mainstream films give after viewing. If you look for films that will offer more than just a two hour cheap thrill ride and then never thought of again; a real beautiful, and meditative journey, that includes you along, and inspires you to look around and beyond life, so memorable, and intelligent then you really should see this film any way you can. Anyone disturbed by high concepts, intelligent scripts, and slow pacing, stay far away, as you will be bored to tears. 5 stars.
