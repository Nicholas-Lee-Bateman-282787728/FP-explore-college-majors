Father Aidan's return, in my opinion, is crucial herein.  After 3 years of Father Peter Clifford, it's welcoming to have the same local priest around for a second year running.  The priest is, generally speaking, the central focus of this drama set---and filmed---in Ireland; in Avoca, in case you're in the Dublin area.  It's not too far away for a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar if you're driving south. Interestingly too, Don Wycherley, who plays Father Aiden is Tina Kellegher's (Niamh) real-life brother-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program.Change is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring), is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.And also returning, fortunately, are the characters of Sean Dillon, and Orla.  So there isn't much to complain about regarding season 5 (well, of course, there are some things, but not worth harping on here as they aren't that troublesome). I wish the same could be said about season 6, but unfortunately, that's when a slew of characters leave the show.  So, enjoy this season all the more!
