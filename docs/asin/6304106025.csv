401206,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304106025,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","I really wanted to like `Mr. Wrong'.  I think I should start by making that perfectly clear.  I love Ellen DeGeneres.  I think that she is a total laugh riot and I am interested in watching everything she's in because of that very fact.  I also adore Joan Cusack (the more talented of the Cusack siblings, in my humble opinion) and so when I saw that she was here as well I was itching to get my hands on the movie.  Despite the fact that Bill Pullman is hot or miss with me, I did really like him in `While You Were Sleeping', which was released just the year prior to this film, and so I half expected to really like him here as well.  All that said, `Mr. Wrong' was just that; all wrong.Ellen plays Martha Alston, a near middle aged woman whose younger sister just got married and is starting to feel pressure from her parents to tie the knot herself.  She is busy with her job and her life, too busy to really actively search for Mr. Right, and even though she receives advances from her younger co-worker Walter she still can't bring herself to make any commitments.  That is until she meets Whitman Crawford (you know something aint right when the guy has two last names), a charming and good looking man who seems to really be interested in her.  She falls head over heals for him almost instantly and soon they are inseparable.  Then, for almost no reason at all, Whitman goes crazy and Martha tries to break things off with him but she can't because Whitman won't let her.Ellen has some funny moments in the beginning of the film but as the films drags on the jokes get stale.  Bill Pullman is as annoying as the day is long in this film.  He delivers one of the worst performances I've ever seen (seriously, how did Ellen get the Razzie nomination and Pullman walk away unscathed from this debacle?) with his disastrous attempt at executing charm and grace.  When he meets Martha in the bar the first time I was gagging at the idea that he was supposed to be irresistible when in fact he came across as somewhat mentally retarded.  Joan Plowright saves some of this film for me with her performance as Whitman's mother.  I just love her and adore her delivery here.  Sure she has a stock character but she handles it elegantly.  Speaking of stock, Joan Cusack is the crazy ex-girlfriend, so crazy that she makes Whitman look sane.  The great thing about this though is that it actually gave me an opportunity to laugh.  Cuscak is hysterical as Inga.  Sure, her character is far fetched and ridiculous but she makes up for the rest of the mediocre film.I can't recommend this movie (even if I think everyone should see Cusack's Inga) simply because it really has no redeeming factor aside from Cusack's very limited role (she has two key scenes, both of which are gut-bustingly funny).  Well, there is the scene where Whitman forces Martha to steal some beer and as they are running from the gas station clerk Whitman throws a beer can at a homeless man.  That part was funny too.  But really, that's it.  This film had a lot of potential.  Sure, it's been done before, but it had DeGeneres and Cusack and that alone should have spelled success, but sadly it did not.  `Mr. Wrong' is a mess of a film that suffers from being too over-the-top without being -over-the-top enough; if that makes any sense.  It is a film that rests itself on the shoulders of a character so out there he is beyond believability yet it feels stale and bland.  How they messed this up I'll never know.",2,As the title would suggest; this movie is all wrong...,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,3487,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'think', 'should', 'start', 'making', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'love', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'think', 'total', 'laugh', 'riot', 'am', 'interested', 'watching', 'everything', 'very', 'fact', 'also', 'adore', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'more', 'talented', 'Cusack', 'siblings', 'humble', 'opinion', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'itching', 'get', 'hands', 'movie', 'fact', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'hot', 'miss', 'did', 'really', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'year', 'prior', 'film', 'so', 'half', 'expected', 'really', 'like', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'was', 'just', 'wrong.Ellen', 'plays', 'Martha', 'Alston', 'near', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'younger', 'sister', 'just', 'got', 'married', 'starting', 'feel', 'pressure', 'parents', 'tie', 'knot', 'busy', 'job', 'life', 'too', 'busy', 'really', 'actively', 'search', 'Mr', 'Right', 'even', 'advances', 'younger', 'co-worker', 'Walter', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'make', 'commitments', 'Whitman', 'Crawford', 'know', 'something', 'aint', 'right', 'when', 'guy', 'two', 'last', 'names', 'charming', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'interested', 'head', 'heals', 'almost', 'instantly', 'soon', 'are', 'inseparable', 'Then', 'almost', 'reason', 'Whitman', 'crazy', 'Martha', 'tries', 'break', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'Whitman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'her.Ellen', 'funny', 'moments', 'beginning', 'film', 'films', 'drags', 'jokes', 'get', 'stale', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'as', 'annoying', 'day', 'long', 'film', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'seriously', 'how', 'did', 'Ellen', 'get', 'Razzie', 'nomination', 'Pullman', 'walk', 'away', 'unscathed', 'debacle', 'disastrous', 'attempt', 'executing', 'charm', 'grace', 'When', 'Martha', 'bar', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'gagging', 'idea', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'irresistible', 'when', 'fact', 'came', 'somewhat', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'film', 'performance', 'Whitman', 'mother', 'just', 'love', 'delivery', 'here', 'Sure', 'stock', 'character', 'elegantly', 'Speaking', 'stock', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'crazy', 'ex-girlfriend', 'so', 'crazy', 'Whitman', 'look', 'sane', 'great', 'thing', 'though', 'actually', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'laugh', 'Cuscak', 'hysterical', 'Inga', 'Sure', 'character', 'far', 'fetched', 'ridiculous', 'up', 'rest', 'mediocre', 'film.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'even', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'Cusack', 'Inga', 'simply', 'really', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'aside', 'Cusack', 'very', 'limited', 'role', 'two', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'Well', 'scene', 'where', 'Whitman', 'Martha', 'steal', 'beer', 'are', 'running', 'gas', 'station', 'clerk', 'Whitman', 'beer', 'can', 'homeless', 'man', 'part', 'was', 'funny', 'too', 'really', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'Sure', 'been', 'done', 'had', 'DeGeneres', 'Cusack', 'alone', 'should', 'have', 'spelled', 'success', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'mess', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'being', '-over-the-top', 'enough', 'sense', 'film', 'shoulders', 'character', 'so', 'out', 'there', 'believability', 'yet', 'stale', 'bland', 'How', 'messed', 'up', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know']",Mr Wrong VHS

It vacillates between a madcap &quot;Lucille Ball&quot; sit-com and a dark comedy about stalking, but suceeds in neither. To their credit, Pullman and DeGeneres try hard to wring some humor out of this idiotic script but their efforts were in vain. No actor, no matter how talented, could save this lousy movie. I am amazed that a star of DeGeneres' magnitude would even bother to do such a film.

I have never laughed so hard at a comedy! Ellen is perfect! She's the only sane person in this completely INSANE movie! A lot of the jokes aren't found in one liners but in the facial expressions of the actors. Take a look at Ellen's face when her &quot;daughter&quot; reveals that she wasn't holding her up with a gun but by a squirt gun! Ellen's face is priceless!

I think Ellen Degenerous is as funny as Bill Engvall and Louis Anderson most of the time but I didn't get this story. I thought Ellen liked girls and this fact was known by everyone. So why is she making a movie about liking a guy(the super actor Bill Pullman)that goes psycho. I knew she dated Anne Hench who I guess went psycho on her in real life. Hench also did a movie where she liked a guy. Please, I'm not very smart so make movies that I can understand. If you like girls so be it, in fact I'm totally cool with it, but don't pretend to fall for the great Bull Pillman if you don't like guys anyway. It's not like I would do a thriller with Natalie Portman and date a dude in real life. I'm totally straight and would date Natalie Portman in real life.
