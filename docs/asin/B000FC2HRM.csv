The film itself is very good and kept my attention, and after it was over it had interested me enough to want to know more about Blackbeard.  So I did some research, and that's when I learned that what I had just seen was not necessarily how it happened...For one, in this film Blackbeard is shown always operating on his own, on one ship, when in fact he often had a mini-flotilla of three or four vessels.  Another surprise was that his famous flagship, Queen Anne's Revenge, was run aground in North Carolina (some say intentionally).  Somehow the film failed to mention this seemingly important event.The story is told through the eyes of Israel Hands, Blackbeard's 2nd-in-command.  That much is true, for Hands was part of the crew, but the film does not mention that Hands actually captained another ship in Blackbeard's group; furthermore, the film shows Blackbeard deliberately wounding Hands to save him from a coming battle, while the historical account of the incident is that Blackbeard shot at another sailor, missed him, and the bullet found Hands by chance.  Blackbeard's reason for shooting?  ""That if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.""  This is hardly the same reason for shooting as the film portrays.Lastly, and rather disturbingly, the film shows Blackbeard bringing his new wife to his ship (after a brief attempt at retirement) and allowing his crew to gang-rape her; the voice-over in the film states ""she was never heard from again.""  While I suppose that a corrupt individual like Blackbeard was certainly capable of such an act, I could find no historical reference or basis for it.  In fact, if anything, it appears he was more of a ""ladies' man"" and, according to author Robert Lee ""few pirates treated women or girls with greater respect than he...""  Given that, it's puzzling why this film would portray Blackbeard authorizing such a heinous crime.The sad part is, I really enjoyed the film and thought it was well done.  It was only after I did some research that I learned the film does not do the best job in presenting history as it happened.  I give it 3 stars for entertainment value, but it loses two for playing ""fast and loose"" with some of the facts.",3,"Entertaining, but...",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2339,"['was', 'little', 'dismayed', 'learn', 'production', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'facts', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'kept', 'attention', 'was', 'had', 'interested', 'enough', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Blackbeard', 'did', 'research', 'when', 'learned', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'how', 'happened', 'one', 'film', 'Blackbeard', 'shown', 'always', 'operating', 'own', 'one', 'ship', 'when', 'fact', 'often', 'had', 'mini-flotilla', 'three', 'four', 'vessels', 'surprise', 'was', 'famous', 'flagship', 'Queen', 'Anne', 'Revenge', 'was', 'run', 'aground', 'North', 'Carolina', 'say', 'intentionally', 'Somehow', 'film', 'failed', 'mention', 'seemingly', 'important', 'event.The', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'Israel', 'Hands', 'Blackbeard', '2nd-in-command', 'much', 'true', 'Hands', 'was', 'part', 'crew', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'Hands', 'actually', 'captained', 'ship', 'Blackbeard', 'group', 'furthermore', 'film', 'Blackbeard', 'deliberately', 'wounding', 'Hands', 'save', 'coming', 'battle', 'historical', 'account', 'incident', 'Blackbeard', 'shot', 'sailor', 'missed', 'bullet', 'found', 'Hands', 'chance', 'Blackbeard', 'reason', 'shooting', 'did', 'not', 'now', 'then', 'kill', 'one', 'would', 'forget', 'who', 'was', 'hardly', 'same', 'reason', 'shooting', 'film', 'portrays.Lastly', 'rather', 'disturbingly', 'film', 'Blackbeard', 'bringing', 'new', 'wife', 'ship', 'brief', 'attempt', 'retirement', 'allowing', 'crew', 'gang-rape', 'voice-over', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'suppose', 'corrupt', 'individual', 'Blackbeard', 'was', 'certainly', 'capable', 'such', 'act', 'could', 'find', 'historical', 'reference', 'basis', 'fact', 'anything', 'was', 'more', 'ladies', 'man', 'according', 'author', 'Robert', 'Lee', 'few', 'pirates', 'treated', 'women', 'girls', 'greater', 'respect', 'Given', 'puzzling', 'why', 'film', 'would', 'portray', 'Blackbeard', 'authorizing', 'such', 'heinous', 'crime.The', 'sad', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'only', 'did', 'research', 'learned', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'presenting', 'history', 'happened', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'entertainment', 'value', 'two', 'playing', 'fast', 'loose', 'facts']",National Geographic: Blackbeard - Terror at Sea

Told through the eyes of his first mate, Israel Hands, the legend comes to life. James Purefoy is wonderful in the title role.

It is a movie for the whole family though perhaps parents should screen it first if they have very young children.The only minor quibble I have with it is the fact vs. folklore special feature, I had a difficult time getting it to play on my dvd player.

987921,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,B000FC2HRM,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[19, 20]","National Geographic's documentary on Blackbeard the Pirate is one of the best I've ever seen on the subject. It brings together all the bits and pieces of fact that are known about the dreaded Captain Edward Teach and uses them to build a wonderful dramatization of the life of one of the most famous and fearsome of all the pirates to sail the seas.Most of what we know of Blackbeard comes from Charles Johnson's famous book ""A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates"", the classic history of piracy's golden age in the early 18th century. This serves as the basis for National Geographic's well-made film that chronicles Blackbeard's life and exploits from his early piratical conquests along the coast of the American colonies to his bloody death at the Battle of Ocracoke in 1718. The documentary portrays Teach as a somewhat human character who, despite his fearsome reputation as a bloodthirsty rogue , prefers to capture prizes without a fight and who spills blood only when needed to make a point. He forms a friendship with his first mate Israel Hands who serves as his trustworthy confidant throughout his career. Blackbeard tries and fails to settle down as a country gentleman after accepting the King's pardon, but quickly finds that gentlemanly ways and a proper wife do not suite him and he longs to return to his rightful place at sea. Virginia Governor Alexander Spottswood, obsessed with finding and killing Blackbeard, sends Lt. Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy to draw him out of 'retirement' and send him to the murky depths. The resulting battle is one of legend.""Blackbeard- Terror at Sea"" is an excellent documentary and serves to clear up many myths surrounding the legendary pirate. It is entertaining and educational and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of piracy and true adventure.",5,The Golden Age of Piracy Brought to Life,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,1870,"['National', 'Geographic', 'documentary', 'Blackbeard', 'Pirate', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'subject', 'together', 'bits', 'pieces', 'fact', 'are', 'known', 'dreaded', 'Captain', 'Edward', 'Teach', 'build', 'wonderful', 'dramatization', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'fearsome', 'pirates', 'sail', 'seas.Most', 'what', 'know', 'Blackbeard', 'Charles', 'Johnson', 'famous', 'book', 'General', 'History', 'Robberies', 'Murders', 'Most', 'Notorious', 'Pirates', 'classic', 'history', 'piracy', 'golden', 'age', 'early', '18th', 'century', 'basis', 'National', 'Geographic', 'well-made', 'film', 'Blackbeard', 'life', 'exploits', 'early', 'piratical', 'conquests', 'coast', 'American', 'colonies', 'bloody', 'death', 'Battle', 'Ocracoke', '1718', 'documentary', 'portrays', 'Teach', 'somewhat', 'human', 'character', 'who', 'fearsome', 'reputation', 'bloodthirsty', 'rogue', 'prefers', 'capture', 'prizes', 'fight', 'who', 'blood', 'only', 'when', 'needed', 'make', 'point', 'friendship', 'first', 'mate', 'Israel', 'Hands', 'who', 'trustworthy', 'confidant', 'career', 'Blackbeard', 'tries', 'fails', 'settle', 'down', 'country', 'gentleman', 'accepting', 'King', 'pardon', 'quickly', 'gentlemanly', 'ways', 'proper', 'wife', 'do', 'not', 'suite', 'return', 'rightful', 'place', 'sea', 'Virginia', 'Governor', 'Alexander', 'Spottswood', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'killing', 'Blackbeard', 'Lt.', 'Robert', 'Maynard', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'draw', ""'retirement"", 'send', 'murky', 'depths', 'resulting', 'battle', 'one', 'legend', 'Blackbeard-', 'Terror', 'Sea', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'clear', 'up', 'many', 'myths', 'surrounding', 'legendary', 'pirate', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'piracy', 'true', 'adventure']",National Geographic: Blackbeard - Terror at Sea

While many docu-dramas splice in some dialogue, this runs for many minutes of dramatic scenes that are as good as or better than many made to the purpose dramatic movies. Blackbeard is very beleivable, has real menacing but human presence and the use of the Mate's character as the narrator works very well indeed. The acting is not the wooden line speaking so often found in these sorts of things but beleivable dialogue. This could have actually been expanded to be a feature length historical drama!
