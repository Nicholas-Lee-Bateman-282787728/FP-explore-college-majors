753283,A3HB3L8E5JD0AH,B00009ATJZ,"Ali P. Breland ""Mrmad2007""","[1, 3]","I SAW THIS MOVIE THE CORNER AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT DAVID SIMON, HBO, CHARLES DUTTON AND THE CAST GAVE TRUE REALISM TO THIS PROBLEM OF DRUG ADDICTION AND VIOLENCES IN GHETTO. CHARLES DUTTON GAVE THIS FILM TOTAL NO HOLDS BARRED LOOK AT THE PROBLEM OF DRUGS AND THE DAY TO DAY LIFE STRUGGLE OF A COMMUNITY TRYING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE HOOD AND THE DRUGS AND VIOLENCES THAT COMES WITH IT. I LOVE THE INTRODUCTION THAT HE DID TALKING ABOUT THE FILM...ITS SO TRUE THAT THE CORNER WAS LIFE IN GOOD AND BAD WAYS. ITS WHERE YOU GOT YOUR DRUGS, ITS WHERE YOU GOT THE LATEST INFO ON WHAT HAPPEN IN THE STREETS, ITS WHERE THE POLICE ARE TRYING TO WIN A ENDLESS BATTLE, ITS ALSO WHERE IT DESTORY LIVES WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO REBUILD WHAT WAS TAKEN AWAY. I THOUGHT THAT DEANDRE STORY ABOUT HIS FAMILY WAS SO SAD, FUNNY, REAL, INSPIRING, EMOTIONAL AND MOST OF ALL DEPRESSING. THESE ADJECTIVES ARE JUST ONE OF MANY THAT DESCRIBE THE BRUTAL REALISM OF LIFE IN THE CORNERS OF THE GHETTO. THIS IS ANOTHER MOVIE THAT I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT MY CHILDREN SAW WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS ITS SHOULD BE SEEN IN MANY SCHOOLS ETC. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE FROM DAVID SIMON OF HOMICIDE LIFE ON THE STREET AS WELL AS CHARLES DUTTON BRILLIANT DEBUT AND DESERVED EMMY FOR BEST DIRECTION. THE CAST SHOULD ALL BE REMEMBER BECAUSE THEY WERE SO REAL AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING MOVIE. SO WHEN U DO BUY THIS MOVIE KNOW THAT YOU WILL SEE SCENES THAT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO TURN OFF THE TV OR NOT EAT YOUR DINNER WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SICK WITH SOME OF THE DRUG SCENES. BUT IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH THEN BY ALL MEANS TAKE A LOOK AT CHARLES DUTTON MASTERPIECE OF LIFE IN THE CORNER FOR ONE STRUGGLE FAMILY OF GARY, FRAN, DEANDRE AND DERODD AS WELL AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I HOPE THAT CHARLES DUTTON DO ANOTHER FLICK HE HAS A EXCELLENT EYE FOR THE CAMERA. I CANT WAIT TO SEE DAVID SIMON NEXT PROJECT CALL MANHUNT THE STORY OF JOHN W.

Sometimes HBO misses, but most of the time, they are right on the money.When ""The Corner"" debuted a few years ago, it came around with little fan fair, so much so, I only discovered it by channel surfing one day (A real crime, if you asked me). But once I started watching, I could not stop. As the series came to an end, I eagerly awaited for all the awards shows to herald this monumental piece of work. There is no doubt that Charles S. Dutton deserved his Emmy. T.K. Carter and Khandi Alexander should have been received theirs too. The whole cast was on point. They all deserved praise. And Toy Connor (played DeAndre's girlfriend), well, all I can say is you blew me away...Since BET is now carrying the series, my interest in the series has been sparked. So instead of watching it with commercial interuptions and blotted out scenes, I decided to purchase the DVD  and share it with my teenage son.Every now and then a movie/series comes along that rocks your very foundation with it's truth, validity and raw beauty. Well ""The Corner"" is one of those. It has spawned one of the best acclaimed series on HBO ""The Wire"" (another of my favorites). Bravo Mr. Dutton, Ms. ALexander and Mr. Carter.

753286,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B00009ATJZ,Birdman,"[83, 89]","Before viewing this miniseries, I had only read the book (of the same name) by David Simon and Edward Burns published in 1997. Still, the world of decaying neighborhoods, the havoc of street drugs and  hopelessness among the disadvantaged has deepened in the Bush era.  It took an ingenious director like Charles Dutton to recount one family's troubled history  gripping miniseries that doesn't miss a beat. And he's selected a cast of relative unknowns who assume their roles with dead-on realismThe film follows a year in the life of one impoverished family against the backdrop of their neighborhood during the 1990's a drug-ridden quarter-mile from Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Dutton, like Simon and Burns, dwells on the humanity of his cxharacters and the universal themes of their day-to-day struggles. You needn't have been an alcoholic or drug addict to enter the hearts of these people or understand how they swing between hope and hopelessness.As political commentary, THE CORNER couldn't be more timely, especially in its grasp of urban education, inner city commmunties, underage pareenthood and America's Dickensian juvenile  justice system. Viewing what these potentially gifted people endure, viewers may ask how many good people we discard because of our cultural myopia, institutional racism and apathy.The core performance here is T.K. Dutton's ""Gary"" -- the father of his broken family. The ways in which he struggles to overcome present shame in light of past success is something most of us will recognize -- race aside -- if not today, then tomorrow.There is no score to speak of except for Corey Harris's blues track which occurs on splash screens and during the credits for each of six episodes. Dutton frames each episode with interviews of different principal characters to evoke the feel of a documentary, and he more than succeeds.Dutton understands the lives of these characters because he grew up in their neighnorhood and experienced first-hand the dissolution of life on these corners -- where red tops and spider bags are the basis of life and death. He knows that the pain of addiction is potent, but not always as devastating as the cruelties of the real world ""clean.""Every facet of this production suggests HBO should rebroadcast THE CORNER  on its tenth anniversary.  You wil laugh, weep, wince and cheer; and when it's over, you will hate to leave these good people.While there are segments that are bleak, Dutton didn't intend to shock. He wanted to remind us that these men and women are fully human, and that --like Gary-- we have the potential to stumble, too. We might be doomed to the Corner but for the grace of God.Five glowing stars for the DVD set -- and the book on which it's based.",5,HBO Has it Together -- THE CORNER is a Masterpiece,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2731,"['viewing', 'miniseries', 'had', 'only', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'David', 'Simon', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'published', '1997', 'Still', 'world', 'decaying', 'neighborhoods', 'havoc', 'street', 'drugs', 'hopelessness', 'disadvantaged', 'deepened', 'Bush', 'era', 'took', 'ingenious', 'director', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'recount', 'one', 'family', 'troubled', 'history', 'gripping', 'miniseries', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'selected', 'cast', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'who', 'assume', 'roles', 'dead-on', 'realismThe', 'film', 'year', 'life', 'one', 'impoverished', 'family', 'backdrop', 'neighborhood', '1990', 'drug-ridden', 'quarter-mile', 'Baltimore', 'Inner', 'Harbor', 'Dutton', 'Simon', 'Burns', 'humanity', 'cxharacters', 'universal', 'themes', 'day-to-day', 'struggles', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'enter', 'hearts', 'people', 'understand', 'how', 'swing', 'hope', 'hopelessness.As', 'political', 'commentary', 'THE', 'CORNER', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'timely', 'especially', 'grasp', 'urban', 'education', 'inner', 'city', 'commmunties', 'underage', 'pareenthood', 'America', 'Dickensian', 'juvenile', 'justice', 'system', 'Viewing', 'what', 'potentially', 'gifted', 'people', 'endure', 'viewers', 'may', 'ask', 'how', 'many', 'good', 'people', 'discard', 'cultural', 'myopia', 'institutional', 'racism', 'apathy.The', 'core', 'performance', 'here', 'T.K', 'Dutton', 'Gary', 'father', 'broken', 'family', 'ways', 'overcome', 'present', 'shame', 'light', 'past', 'success', 'something', 'most', 'will', 'recognize', 'race', 'aside', 'not', 'today', 'then', 'score', 'speak', 'Corey', 'Harris', 'blues', 'track', 'splash', 'screens', 'credits', 'six', 'episodes', 'Dutton', 'episode', 'interviews', 'different', 'principal', 'characters', 'evoke', 'feel', 'documentary', 'more', 'succeeds.Dutton', 'lives', 'characters', 'grew', 'up', 'neighnorhood', 'experienced', 'first-hand', 'dissolution', 'life', 'corners', 'where', 'red', 'tops', 'spider', 'bags', 'are', 'basis', 'life', 'death', 'pain', 'addiction', 'potent', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'devastating', 'cruelties', 'real', 'world', 'clean', 'facet', 'production', 'HBO', 'should', 'rebroadcast', 'THE', 'CORNER', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'wil', 'laugh', 'weep', 'wince', 'cheer', 'when', 'over', 'will', 'hate', 'leave', 'good', 'people.While', 'are', 'segments', 'are', 'bleak', 'Dutton', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'shock', 'wanted', 'remind', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'fully', 'human', 'Gary', 'have', 'potential', 'stumble', 'too', 'might', 'be', 'doomed', 'Corner', 'grace', 'God.Five', 'glowing', 'stars', 'DVD', 'set', 'book', 'based']",The Corner

Compassionately directed by actor Charles S. Dutton and written by David Simon and Edward Burns (creators of ""The Wire""), every performance here is deeply moving and powerfully acted. Based on a real-life family from Baltimore, and the friends and neighborhood they are from, this miniseries deals with the horrors of drug addiction in a more realistic way than perhaps any movie or TV series ever has. You feel like you are right there in the middle of this horror, as the series takes an intimate, documentary-like approach. You have to keep reminding yourself that these are all actors playing a part. This would be a powerful series even if it was completely fictional. The fact that every character actually exists in real life just makes it that much more riveting.T.K. Carter's heartbreaking portrayal of Gary McCullough is one of the most poignant acting performances ever captured on film. Gary was once an extremely intelligent and successful stock market wizard who abhorred drugs and worked hard for his money. The fact that he eventually falls into a life of heroin abuse, and loses everything, most of all his dignity, is particularly sad. In every scene, you see a broken man with a look in his eyes that says, ""how did I get myself into this mess?"" Out of all the people whose lives are documented in this series, he seems to be the one you are pulling for the most. Carter captures the true essence of a man who is clearly not cut out for this kind of life, knows he is worth much more than this, but seems unable to stop himself from falling deeper into the abyss that has also claimed everyone around him. It's a truly shattering performance that will leave you in tears.Khandi Alexander and Sean Nelson, who play his ex-wife and son, also give deeply moving performances, as does everyone in the cast. Glenn Plummer's portrayal of ""Blue"" is also worth noting, as he struggles to get himself out of his own battles with addiction.You keep praying for everyone to pull themselves out of this self-created hell, but only a few are able to do so. Some are so far gone, you are amazed they have made it this far in life. They are truly ravaged souls, physically and mentally.After the film is over, Dutton interviews some of the real-life counterparts, and you can see the hopefulness they convey, but also a lot of the emotional scars and demons they still carry with them.This is one series that should be seen by everyone. It shows the absolute devastation and unrelenting destruction that drugs (whether doing them or selling them) will cause. It does it in a way that is not melodramatic or glamorized but simply realistic. It's bleak but manages to remain hopeful in the wake of all this human carnage.You'll find yourself choked up but I guarantee it will stay with you for a long time to come.

The adults seem to be drug addicts and hopeless most of the time and the younger set seem to be sellers and abusers.  One family is unique.  The parents had good jobs and the father had one year of college - amazing in these parts.  The mother became an abuser and partier of cocaine and eventually the father took to herion.  His explanation is that the people doing drugs around him including his wife were criticizing him and encouraging him to do it.  He thought people would like him better if he abused drugs too.  Unfortunately, they liked him less.  A young girl at 13 has a baby.  The young man doesn't go to school or work, he hangs on the corner.  All this is based on real story and ring true.

753305,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,B00009ATJZ,Michael Fishman,"[1, 1]","The Corner is based on real people and real events and was one of the strongest, most emotional mini-series I've ever seen. Playing almost like a documentary, these brilliantly directed six episodes take place over the course of one year and they combine to tell the story of a family living and surviving in a Baltimore ghetto along with some other residents of the neighborhood.The Corner wasn't an easy show to watch, but it was absolutely enthralling. From the directing to the acting to the writing, I can't think of anything flawed about the show. The pain of the characters in this miniseries is tangible and the viewer feels that pain during every minute of every episode.The subject matter is naturally depressing, but in a way it's not as depressing as the thought of a society content in sitting back and watching junk TV, happy as long as what's happening out there doesn't affect them and numb to the point of being blind that life as depicted in The Corner really does exist. The Corner is nowhere near as depressing as a society that allows conditions and lives like this to survive and flourish in our country.I think to try and put the focus of the miniseries on drugs, or poverty, or on stereotypes, or to try and pass it off as exploitation is to really miss the point of the story, and to not realize that no matter who we are, we all deal with corners in our lives (admittedly without much of the tragic nature of the areas or the people represented in the series) is to miss part of the message.The Corner is really a must-see miniseries that should be shown to our politicians and shown in our schools and shown in our living rooms. The Corner should be seen by everyone.I mentioned the acting and in particular I think both Kandye Alexander and Clark Peters were absolutely amazing.Some writers have a certain knack for being able to capture honest and emotional human interactions and dialogue. Raymond Chandler, Richard Price and George Pelecanos are just three that immediately come to mind and I have to add David Simon to the list as well. From Homicide: Life on the Streets, to The Wire, to The Corner, Simon proves himself capable of taking his audience directly inside the minds and souls of the characters he writes about. The downside to that is that it's not always a pleasant place to be.A random scale of 1 to 5 doesn't do justice to a piece of work like The Corner.",5,Flawless.

753309,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B00009ATJZ,Olukayode Balogun,"[24, 29]","There's a scene right at the end of episode three titled ""Fran's Blues"", where Charles S. Dutton is talking to Baltimore Police Officer Robert Brown (played by Brian O'Neill). Officer Brown says he's sad about how the neighbourhood has changed over the years due to drugs. ""The rot started in the projects,"" Brown says, and then it ""Just kept creeping uphill."" Dutton asks Brown if he ever feels like he's wasting his time, given the number of people the city locks up every year only a fraction of who get ""prison time"". Brown doesn't seem to think so, replying that there are still good people in the neighbourhood, ""Church people, working people"", who want to see the drug scourge end. Duttom then asks Brown if he thinks the war on drugs will ever be won? There's a long pause. The officer looks everywhere but at the camera and, after what seems like an age, finally says: ""No comment.""Fans of ""The Wire"" (of which this series is a very close relation) will also recall a scene where it's implied by one of the characters that the war on drugs isn't being fought with any conviction because if it was and was eventually won, well, then local politicians wouldn't have anything to campaign about, would they? And then let's not forget the very strong belief among social commentators and observers both black and white, that narcotic drugs were brought into the black community by the CIA to ensure black folk remained a permanent underclass. Why do I bring all this up? I bring it all this up because these are the issues that came up for me while watching this powerful series. More than anything else, I came away feeling amazed that we live in a society that has allowed such incredible suffering to go on, on such a massive scale, for so long.The six-part series is very cleverly directed by Charles S. Dutton to look like it was part documentary and part drama with skilfully added in flashbacks. In just six one-hour episodes it explores a wide range of social issues such as urban deprivation, poverty, family breakdown and teenage pregnancy but the focus is really the psychology of drug addiction and the despair of people caught up in it, particularly the McCullough family: Dad Gary (played by T.K. Carter), Mom Fran (played by Khandi Alexander) and two sons DeAndre and DeRodd (played by Sean Nelson and Sylvester Lee Kirk respectively). The series poses a lot of interesting and crucial questions about the so-called war on drugs that so far, I haven't heard any real-life politicians seriously address. Ever.The series is from the same brains behind similarly Baltimore-focused shows as ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and of course ""The Wire"". I know a couple of Baltimore residents personally and while all fans of these shows, they do have mixed feelings about them. I can understand why. Other shows supposedly based in other cities like New York's ""Law & Order"", Los Angeles' ""The Shield"" or Las Vegas' ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" are all very well produced, directed and acted, (not to mention popular world-wide), but they are also very obviously works of fiction. This crop of shows on the other hand are based on non-fiction books. ""The Corner"" is based on ""The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood"", a non-fiction book by David Simon and Edward Burns and ""The Wire"", though largely written by Simon and Burns, is based on the non-fiction book ""The Wire: Truth Be Told"" by Rafael Alvarez. Even ""Homicide"" was based on a non-fiction book. They are thus so very close to the truth of what life is like on the streets of Baltimore. Or so I'm told. I can understand how that could make some people uncomfortable. Almost like they and their city are being put under a microscope.In any event, one question that never seems to get answered via any of these shows and always seems to get glossed over is why these people get into drugs in the first place. We're told that Fran lost her sister and turned to drugs to ease the pain but no more is said on the subject. Personally, I'd have liked to find out what it was about Fran or any of the other drug addicts in the series and/or what it was about their lives that made drugs so attractive an option as an escape?Also, these drugs are not manufactured on the streets of Baltimore so how do they get there? And where do they come from? I feel until we get shows that begin to focus on some of the root causes of the world's drug epidemic today, all we'll ever get is very entertaining shows that mainly serve to make us voyeurs on other people's tragic sadness.But the emphasis is definitely on 'very entertaining'. I watched the entire series over two days, three episodes a sitting and then watched them all over again. As sad as the stories are, they were fun to watch. It was so much fun to see many of the same actors from the current season of The Wire on this too, people like Lance Reddick, Maria Broom, Clarke Peters, Reg E. Cathey; all incredibly versatile and talented artistes. Finally, it was also great to see (at the end of the final episode) the real-life people behind the story and find out how they felt about being portrayed on film in this way. They didn't seem to mind and the real Fran Boyd expressed the hope that seeing how bad her life on drugs was, might encourage other drug addicts to get help.I hope so too.I know this is long-winded and may seem more like an essay than a review of a DVD but I just don't think it's enough to review something this significant with generic praise like ""Great work by Charles S. Dutton!"" (Even though it is) or ""T.K. Carter's performance was stunning!"" (Even though it was) or ""Sean Nelson was great!"" (Even though he was) or ""Khandi Alexander shines!"" (Even though she does). In my view, this winner of 3 Emmys is a body of work that is much greater than the sum of its parts, as fantastic as those parts are. This series makes me think and it makes me wonder. Not many TV series can do that.But then, this isn't TV.

The Corner does show a lot of the ugliness that surrounds a community of drug addicts, but there's far more to it than that.The creators of this mini series did an excellent job of showing the many sides surounding addiction.
