It only contains 14 minutes of video, which loops over and over again.Then the soundtracks don't correspond to what's on the cover. They mix a bunch of music played in a classical style and call it Bach.For less money you can get the Blu-Ray disc Blue Planet - filmed in Imax with much higher resolution, Walter Cronkite narration and over one hour of unrepeated, unlooping high resolution  video from space.",1,Ripoff!!!

990931,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,B000FIHNIY,H. Snyder,"[6, 6]","I purchased this video expecting stunning views from space, and I got that.  But it was not ""one hour"" as advertized, rather it was a 3:45 launch sequence followed by 14:53 of original footage from space, followed by three repeats of about 14:30 each from the space view footage.  Despite the claim in another user review, this repetition has nothing to do with consecutive orbits, it is merely re-use of the same footage. Even the most casual observer can notice the repetition of such distinctive scenes as a zoom-in on Mt Fuji, or the dumping of the urine holding tank.  I would have given this disc a five-star rating if it had the promised hour of original video.  As it is, the crystal-clear views from space and the 8 hours of great 5.1 surround music warrant a four-star rating.

Noteworthy, is a three and a half minute long video clip of the launch sequence.  It is quite impressive and worth looking out for as the video loops!By all means, add 'A View from Space with Heavenly Music' to your collection ... but, as an Audio blu-ray with just 20 minutes of Hi- Def video.  It will make a great Holiday stocking stuffer for those classical music aficionados on your gift list!Despite having 8 hours of high quality audio, I held back 2 STARS for the MUCH TOO SHORT video content.Hope this review was helpful ...Jeffrey A.
