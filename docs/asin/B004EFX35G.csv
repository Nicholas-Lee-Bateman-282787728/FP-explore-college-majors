It is weird.  Not motivating at all.  Instructor is good but does not have the voice for shouting and her voice gets whiny/shrieky, so a music only option would solve a lot of problems.",3,good but where is the music?,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,459,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.I', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'instructor', 'usually', 'challenging', 'workout', 'also', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'tough', 'others', 'Why', 'workout', 'have', 'audible', 'music', 'weird', 'Not', 'motivating', 'Instructor', 'good', 'not', 'have', 'voice', 'shouting', 'voice', 'whiny/shrieky', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'would', 'solve', 'lot', 'problems']",Jane Fonda's Workout: Bootcamp Ultra with Jeanette Jenkins

I must not have been doing it right because the 2nd time really kicked my tail.  I like Jeanette's personality very much.  She's motivating without being annoying.  The reps are longer than reps in some of the typical workouts I do (Jessica Smith, the firm), but it wasn't boring long (like Jeri love IMO).  It's long, so I can't do it on weekdays because I rarely have 60 minutes before work, but it is in my weekend rotation.  I think she is in amazing shape and enjoy seeing instructors who are healthy and strong in appearance.  Other reviewers complain of the music, but I didn't notice music at all.  Which is agreeably not ideal.  I also felt like her counts were off at times and not consistent.  But these aren't deal breakers.  All in all, it's not my favorite, but I think it's a really good workout.",4,really enjoyed this workout,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,943,"['purchased', 'due', 'great', 'reviews', 'had', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'right', '2nd', 'time', 'really', 'kicked', 'tail', 'like', 'Jeanette', 'personality', 'very', 'much', 'motivating', 'being', 'annoying', 'reps', 'are', 'longer', 'reps', 'typical', 'workouts', 'do', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'firm', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'long', 'Jeri', 'love', 'IMO', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'weekdays', 'rarely', 'have', '60', 'minutes', 'work', 'weekend', 'rotation', 'think', 'amazing', 'shape', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'instructors', 'who', 'are', 'healthy', 'strong', 'appearance', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'music', 'Which', 'agreeably', 'not', 'ideal', 'also', 'felt', 'counts', 'were', 'off', 'times', 'not', 'consistent', 'are', ""n't"", 'deal', 'breakers', 'not', 'favorite', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'workout']",Jane Fonda's Workout: Bootcamp Ultra with Jeanette Jenkins

With Jeanette's bootcamp you receive an HOUR workout and it is intense.  It is non-stop cardio!  It also features a variety of moves and really gets your heart rate high.  The weight section is equally as nice.  Not the few reps Jillian does.  You will see results if you use the correct amount of weights.  I like all of her DVD's because you get a good cardio workout and weight workout instead of the cardio and weights put together in a less than 20 minute program.  Also try the bikini beach body and blast the belly fat workouts.",5,Better than Jillian Michaels!,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,652,"['know', 'everyone', 'likes', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'productive', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'Yes', 'said', 'Jeanette', 'bootcamp', 'receive', 'HOUR', 'workout', 'intense', 'non-stop', 'cardio', 'also', 'variety', 'moves', 'really', 'heart', 'rate', 'high', 'weight', 'section', 'equally', 'nice', 'Not', 'few', 'reps', 'Jillian', 'will', 'see', 'results', 'use', 'correct', 'amount', 'weights', 'DVD', 'get', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'weight', 'workout', 'instead', 'cardio', 'weights', 'put', 'together', 'less', '20', 'minute', 'program', 'Also', 'try', 'bikini', 'beach', 'body', 'blast', 'belly', 'fat', 'workouts']",Jane Fonda's Workout: Bootcamp Ultra with Jeanette Jenkins

The first 30 minutes are pure cardio in boot camp style.  It's intense and is a good workout for a low-intermediate and up fitness level.  The final 30 minutes is all strength - I used 5 lbs. weights.Very straightforward workout that you can alternate on busy days (30 mins of cardio on Mondays & Weds; 30 mins of strength on Tues & Thurs).

1398090,A3CEIZWEEX9W3W,B004EFX35G,Sourpatchkid,"[4, 4]","I just completed this workout for the first time and it is amazing! Jeanette Jenkins is a great instructor and keeps you motivated through this hour long intense workout. The first 35 minutes include a warm up and cardio portion. The cardio portion includes kickboxing, basketball inspired exercises, and several unique moves such as a burpee to pushup to side plank, and several high intensity cardio moves that were new to me and believe me I own a lot of exercise dvds. The best thing about this dvd is that the moves are never repetitive and the time really flies by. It's an intense workout but it is so much fun that it makes it easy to get through the full hour. The last portion consists of toning. Jeanette uses combination exercises with 3 to 5 pound dumbbells to tone your entire body. Then she takes it to the mat for some leg and ab work. My heart rate was elevated the entire time. At the end there is a great stretch segment to cool down. Of all my 70 plus dvds this is definitely a new favorite and I will use it often.
