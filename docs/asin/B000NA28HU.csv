1055292,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B000NA28HU,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","When the novelEragon (Inheritance, Book 1)was first published I resisted reading it for the longest time; there was nothing about it that sounded new and interesting.  Sure, it was a self-published hit written by a home-schooled teenager, but other than that the novel sounded like a mish-mash of different fantasy sterotypes I'd read dozens of times before.  Then, someone gave it to for a birthday present and since I would never insult that person by not reading the novel I sat down one weekend and poured through the story.  Was my opinion changed?  No.  As I thought, it was a mish-mash of fantasy sterotypes and a story obviously written by a child, with a child's viewpoint on the world.  I'll grant Christopher Paolini this:  he did create interesting characters in the likes of Eragon and Saphira, but that did not save the derivative story.  Regardless of the praise Paolini has been given, he is not the reincarnation of J. R. R. Tolkien; he is not Terry Brooks reimagined; he is not the heir to Robert Jordan.When I sat down to watch the movie version of the novel, I came away understanding why the film was not the success the studio had hoped it would be.  The screenwriter took a mish-mash of a novel and turned it into an even bigger mish-mash of a movie.  While the film keeps the basic premise and characters of the novel, it deviates in many ways.  So much so that it barely resembles the novel upon which it is based.  Add to that some wooden acting from usually-good actors like Jeremy Irons and Djimon Honsou along with sub-par special effects and you get a movie even fans would not enjoy.  I will grant that unknown-until-now Edward Speleers was an engaging young actor with some talent and a perfect choice for the role of Eragon.

The only things it has going for it are some utterly wasted A-list stars, some cartoonishly executed action sequences and special effects, and the name of a best-selling but apparently unrelated book as its title. The plot is disjointed and paper thin, the production values are wretched, there is no character development, and what plot there is advances almost entirely through poorly acted and ponderous exposition. The abysmal result could have perhaps been improved if the screenplay writers had made more than a token effort to draw on the rich source material available in the book that the movie takes its title from. As it is, the story presented in the movie is all but unrecognizable to those who have read the book. Departing from the source material isn't necessarily problematic when the result can stand on its own merits, but the excellence of the book makes the wretchedness of this at best tenuously related film stand out all the more.

I loved the book, but after watching this piece of crap movie, I was so angry at all of its patheticness, inaccuracy,and the ten-thousand things they got totally wrong that I actually burst into tears, and than chucked it back into the trash. I even have a distinct memory of cursing out the television set during the course of the film. I mean, come on; they couldn't even make one simple thing, such as the characters looks, be consistant with how they were portrayed in the book? Last time I checked, Eragon had DARK hair, Brom was old and had long hair and a beard, and Arya was a black-haired elf (and where were her pointy ears in the film?), just to name a few. The only thing I was even remotely satisfied with was the CG effects on Sapphira, as well as Rachel Weiz's portrayal of her. I have no wish to completely re-state all of the negative things about this film, but I will say that it is THE WORST film adaptation of a book that I have ever seen. Yes, I do realize that not every single thing in a film based on a novel can be 100% accurate, but this film didn't even come close to hitting the halfway mark, let alone the full 80-90% that successful film adaptations achieve, not even remotely. Even a parody of the book would have been way better. Even if I had never read the book before seeing the film, I know I would have considered this movie to be trash.

As someone said before, everything doesn't have to be a kids movie so why bother making it short? Kids like LOTR you know! They're not exactly short, and look how great they are! Things in the books are unnecessarily left out, such as Katrina, Saphira growing up (hello? it just takes about a minute of a few simple shots with some music in the background!), like, the real Murtagh, Arya's ears (and hey, maybe mention that she's an elf! Kinda important ya know...), the real glory of Tronjheim, Angela [without the beads], Eragon's futere-telling, Solembum (HELLO? WAKE UP! He's the BEST CHARACTER!), Jeod, half the villages they travel to, the Ra'zaccs' cloaks beaks and body shape (what's up with the crawling worms in the face?), Eragon and Saphira's relationship (they become sister/brother pals overnight), Sloan, Togira Ikonaka ""The Cripple Who Is Whole,"" and ORIK! Yeah, I think I named just a few things, not to mention half the dialogue was lousy, the other half acceptable but the exact opposite of the book.If you enjoy seeing a fabulous, richly detailed, passionate, dynamic and unique BOOK be RIPPED TO PIECES, then be my guest, get this movie, but if you do U R SICK. Who wants to see a great story be shredded like that? I, for one, am appalled how they can give it the same title.Must give it credit for special effects and Saphira is very well done, but how about timing?? Special effects are cool and all, but you need to pace yourself, and the special effects in Eragon are running a ten mile marathon, and they start running out of breath at about the third mile, which is why the last seven miles are CRAP, and rushed and TERRIBLE. I was seriously looking forward to seeing Tronjheim, but nope... guess they couldn't afford to build a huge saphire, but hey: WHY MAKE A MOVIE IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THE BEST IT CAN BE?If you enjoy disappointment, then please, by all means, get this movie. Be disappointed. It doesn't matter to me, I'm just here to give you a review.I gave this two stars because although everything is backwards and messed up and scrambled, there are a few parts which are splendid, such as the first five minutes or so of the movie. I loved the village of Carvahall even if we only see it once, and I enjoyed Saphira's egg hatching. I think Roran and Eragon's relationship was well displayed as well. This is about the only things that are FAIR. Jeremy Irons was wonderful but there's only so much you can do with an AWFUL script.Thanks for the effort, but all thumbs down.

Seriously, switching between a few characters every 30 seconds is just not the way to do it.  It felt too much like the creators were just pulling stuff out of thin air for no reason other than filler.  The fight between Brom and Eragon came out of nowhere, when just a few seconds earlier they were in great danger.  How does that make any sense?The story just went too fast.  LOTR in less than 2 hours, or at least that's what it felt like they were shooting for.  The viewer is given no time at all to identify, familiarize, or immerse themselves into story.Low budget, and that's probably why it was so terrible.  The dragon looked fantastic, but we saw less of her than we should have.  And even less of Eragon riding her.  And what's with using character dialogue more than once?  Did they think viewers wouldn't notice?  Come on, now.Very, very bad choice of director.  Sorry, but a first-timer should not have even touched this movie.  No talent at all, and it shows.There is so much wrong with this movie, but it all boils down to no vision.  So little effort put into something that could have been a wonderful experience for both fans and newcomers alike.All in all, this movie is filled with poor choices and missed oppurtunities.  The only redeeming quality is the dragon, which is why I gave 3 stars.  If it weren't for her, this atrocity would have been a dead bore B-movie.Most likely the trilogy is cancelled because of the poor performance of this one.  But, if for some strange reason they decide to go through with it - everyone involved with this project needs to be replaced immediately and the entire thing should be overhauled.

I thought the special effects were very good, better then Narnia and a more interesting story.  Jeremy Irons and John Malcovich were both very good as one would expect.Many of these negative reviews amaze me, it seems some just criticize because that is what they enjoy doing. Such nit picking! Some complain that it has the usual fantasy themes, clothes, creatures, magic etc of other fantasy films such as Lord of the Rings.  Well of course it does, it is a fantasy film. All fantasy stories have common themes, just as all westerns have common themes. Would you go to a western and be upset that it had cowboys and horses and gunfights? Or go to a Science Fiction film and complain that it had space ships and aliens?  That is a silly complaint to make.Some complained it was poorly written, well the novel was a best seller and many including myself loved the story.  Yes, I know they left a lot out of the movie, but that cannot be helped, the story took place over a long period, and they had to condense it into less then two hours, although I do feel they should have made it at least a three hours movie to cover more of the story.One complained that Saphira had the voice of a female.  Well duh, she is a female dragon and has a female personality, obviously never read the books.  I guess that reviewer thought a female dragon should have the voice of Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwartenegger, Geez.Others complained that it was set up for sequels, well I guess so, it is only the first chapter in the Inheritance Trilogy.  Just as Fellowship of the Ring was only the first chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, neither was ever intended to stand alone as a single story, but the beginning of a story.Everyone wants to compare this and other fantasy films with Lord of the Rings, and it is unfair to make that comparison.  I can't imagine any fantasy films living up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but that does not mean they can not be enjoyable films in their own right.I am not a kid, but have not forgot how to enjoy youthful things, this was not intended to be ""Gone With the Wind"", just a fun fantasy film about a magical dragon and her hero rider, and I really enjoyed it.",4,"A fun fantasy film, unfairly criticized.",1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,2417,"['Having', 'read', 'books', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'leave', 'lot', 'make', 'changes', 'was', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Saphira', 'was', 'delighted', 'looked', 'behaved', 'had', 'pictured', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'better', 'then', 'Narnia', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'expect.Many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'just', 'criticize', 'what', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'Such', 'nit', 'picking', 'complain', 'usual', 'fantasy', 'themes', 'clothes', 'creatures', 'magic', 'etc', 'other', 'fantasy', 'films', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Well', 'course', 'fantasy', 'film', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'have', 'common', 'themes', 'just', 'westerns', 'have', 'common', 'themes', 'Would', 'go', 'western', 'be', 'upset', 'had', 'cowboys', 'horses', 'gunfights', 'go', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'film', 'complain', 'had', 'space', 'ships', 'aliens', 'silly', 'complaint', 'make.Some', 'complained', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'well', 'novel', 'was', 'best', 'seller', 'many', 'including', 'loved', 'story', 'Yes', 'know', 'left', 'lot', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'long', 'period', 'had', 'condense', 'less', 'then', 'two', 'hours', 'do', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'least', 'three', 'hours', 'movie', 'cover', 'more', 'story.One', 'complained', 'Saphira', 'had', 'voice', 'female', 'Well', 'duh', 'female', 'dragon', 'female', 'personality', 'obviously', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'guess', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'female', 'dragon', 'should', 'have', 'voice', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Arnold', 'Schwartenegger', 'Geez.Others', 'complained', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'sequels', 'well', 'guess', 'so', 'only', 'first', 'chapter', 'Inheritance', 'Trilogy', 'Just', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'chapter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'was', 'ever', 'intended', 'stand', 'alone', 'single', 'story', 'beginning', 'story.Everyone', 'compare', 'other', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'unfair', 'make', 'comparison', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'fantasy', 'films', 'living', 'up', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'not', 'mean', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'own', 'right.I', 'am', 'not', 'kid', 'have', 'not', 'forgot', 'how', 'enjoy', 'youthful', 'things', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'just', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'film', 'magical', 'dragon', 'hero', 'rider', 'really', 'enjoyed']",N/A

The movie does look like a pilot so maybe more will come in a sequel or a TV show.See the story much better done as ""Star Wars"" (1977) the farmer's nephew must become a hero after his uncle was burnt to a crisp.

1055316,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000NA28HU,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 5]","`Eragon', directed by Stefen Fangmeier, is based on a screenplay by Peter Buchman, from the first novel by teenaged author Christopher Paolini. To point out that the story is loosely based on themes from and the style of the `Lord of the Rings' films is less interesting than to say that it is also based heavily on themes from `Star Wars' and Anne McCafferty's `Dragonriders of Pern' series, both of which are themselves heavily influenced by the `Lord of the Rings' novels first published in 1955 through 1958 and even more so on the first Middle Earth quest described in `The Hobbit'. So, since Tolkien's tales from Middle Earth have had a pervasive influence on fantasy fiction and role-playing gaming for the last 50 years, we must take their influence as a given and move on. The immediate influence on the novel and the movie is not Tolkien's books so much as the great success of the `Lord of the Rings' movies. I also detect some influences from the Matrix trilogy in some scenes, although these influences are minor.The problem now faced by `Eragon' the movie is that with the `Lord of the Rings' movies, Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's story has raised the bar so high, practically no one outside of fantasy creative powerhouses such as Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas have the juice to put the kind of creative energy and money into a film to match Jackson's benchmark. The film version of `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' comes close, but basically served as a proof of my contention that even with a classic script based on a C. S. Lewis' novel and all the resources of the Disney studios, we get a movie which at best comes in a distant second to `Rings'.It may be just a bit less obvious than with `The Fellowship of the Ring', but `Eragon' story is clearly the opening chapter of a series. Virtually the only area where `Eragon' is superior to `Fellowship' is that like the first (Episode IV) `Star Wars' flick, the story is fairly self-contained, with a reasonably satisfying ending. Otherwise, the story is weaker than `Fellowship'. My first observation is that while `Fellowship' had at least fourteen (14) interesting characters, `Eragon' has barely three, and that's counting the dragon. `Fellowship' had the nine members of the fellowship plus Bilbo Baggins, Arwen Evenstar, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman. And that's not counting the black riders, Barliman Butterbur and the Balrog! I count Jackson's greatest achievement with the filming of `Rings' is his (and Elijah Woods) making the character of Frodo Baggins interesting and sympathetic. Through countless readings of `Rings', I could never shake the notion that Frodo was a wimp. In the movie, he is beset with doubt, but he does not come off as a wimp! So, compared to the character of Eragon, the filmed Frodo Baggins is much more interesting. Eragon's mentor, played well by Jeremy Irons, is simply no match for Viggo Mortensen's realization of `Ring's Strider / Aragorn character. Again, I was never entirely happy with Aragorn on the written page. Director and actor really make the most of his character.While there was no dragon in `Rings', we do get a superb realization of an intelligent, speaking dragon in the gloriously limned picture of the great Smaug in `The Hobbit'. In comparison, our friendly dragon Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz, carries her own.The primary heavy, the `shade', in the employ of king Galbatorix (a waste of the talents of John Malkovich) is no match for the heavies in `Fellowship', that being primarily the black riders (who still give me nightmares after reading about them one late Saturday night, forty years ago), the Balrog, and the Uruk-hai (Saruman's own special breed of orc).When it comes to pivotal scenes, `Eragon' pales in comparison to `Fellowship'. One can claim that Jackson actually drags out some scenes just a bit too much to milk them for all they are worth, but I totally forgive him for his totally convincing realization of the encounter between Gandalf and the Balrog. Director Fangmeier has nothing that comes even close.The other speaking characters in `Eragon' seem to never be adequately introduced or explained, and in the world of grand mythical fiction, that is the cardinal sin, as it is the primary legacy of Tolkien's work. In no other world of science fiction or fantasy do we have the depth of realized legend, language and lore as in Tolkien. McCafferty in `Dragonriders' and Lucas in `Star Wars' come close, and that is why the work as well as they do.The director's commentary on this DVD was interesting, but it failed to provide much of the mythical background I so much want in works like this. This is a fair effort, but the series has a long way to go to come up to its legendary model.",3,Weak fantasy.

1055317,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000NA28HU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","ERAGON is one of those films that makes Sci-Fi and Fantasy lovers cringe. It is plainly a horrifically done adaption of Christopher Paolini's book by the same name, slashing vital plots into nothingness, showing forced performances by some the best actors of our time (the most noteworthy being John Malkovich), and producing a main character (Eragon played by Edward Speelers) who grows too fast and is rarely sympathetic in the short 104 minutes of the entire film.Note that time: 104 minutes. Chris Paolini wrote Eragon as a sort of epic, brandishing derivative works such as Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Ringsseries and McCaffrey'sDragonriders of Pernstories. But Paolini was only fifteen when he started writing it, so quite a bit of leeway was given to him because of youthful inexperience. He did create an interesting world, but the book was lukewarm at best (in my opinion) yet sparked the imagination of younger readers. Perhaps his book could be considered a gateway to the more in-depth novels by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and the other great fantasy authors. Regardless, his ""epic"" was slashed to 104 minutes ...although the ending of this movie certainly leaves it open for a sequel even though there's NOTHING on the film radar/horizon to suggest one is coming. Which pretty much leaves this flick dead in the water. Dropping off plots in order to wedge the story into a certain time-frame for a certain audience has proved disastrous time after time.The Lord of the Rings movies(178 min., 179 min., and 201 min. respectively),The Chronicles of Narnia(143 min.) and many, many other lengthy films proved this. Although they did make alterations to the literary works, they kept almost all of the plots intact. Of course longer movies mean more costs for the production studio, too.So the first big strike against Eragon is its short length in comparison to the depth the novel gave us.The second is the acting. When the best job is done by a CGI character who's voiced by Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardner), you know there's a problem. Her Saphira voice-over is done well, leaving all the other actors/actresses in the dust. Although Jeremy Irons (Casanova) does a middlin' job as the old dragonrider Brom, it most certainly isn't his most shining moment on celluloid. Many of his lines are stilted and sound as if he's afraid to use more than five words in a sentence. From here, the acting takes a serious nosedive into oblivion. Newbie Edward Speelers as Eragon is rip-your-eyes-out bad. You can tell he's trying way to hard to make his character empathetic and interesting but the script wouldn't allow it. Sienna Guillory as the magical Arya is practically unknown to the viewer, never letting us know why she, of all people, is carrying something so important through such a dangerous land. Robert Carlyle as the dastardly Duza is probably the most forced evil character you'll ever see, making you laugh at him more than fear him.The best quality within the movie was the CGI. The images were rendered exceptionally well and the dragon Saphira has a very authentic look to her (which was good considering how much time she's onscreen).If you loved Paolini's Eragon novel, you'll probably screech in dismay at this adaption.

I just wish Paolini hadn't given up his material for this horrible movie. It's horrible that now his other books have no chance at being made. I completely understand that sometimes a book has to be modified to be a movie, and I have no problem when it's done successively (like LoTR). However the script writers, producers, and director simply raped the original story to a point where I almost didn't recognize the story outside of 'boy finds egg and becomes dragon rider.' The book is long, and for some reason they decided to make it an hour and a half long, which is a length that no fantasy story could properly be told in. Because of this they cut out all of the character development, making the viewer not care about anything that's happening. The worst part of this is where Saphira is a baby dragon, flies for a minute and comes back as a full adult, I mean what were they thinking. I just wonder if Paolini had any involvement, or he was just so excited to have his book turned into a movie he didn't care what they did.

In fact, ""Eragon"" might almost be described as ""A New Hope"" without spaceships--but that doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a 17-year-old farmboy who's been raised by his mother's brother (Alun Armstrong) following her precipitous and mysterious disappearance from his life.  His country groans under the tyrannical rule of Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the last of a corps of dragon riders who for thousands of years were the guardians of the land and its people until they fell to quarrelling among themselves and gave him a chance to destroy them from within.  Eragon knows he'll soon be of age to be impressed into the king's army--his cousin has already headed off into the wilderness rather than meet that fate--but before he can decide what to do about it, he finds a beautiful blue object from which hatches a small dragon.  The creature grows rapidly and soon is communicating mentally with him, explaining that he is her destined Rider.  But the King and his sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) know the egg has hatched, and send assassins after its Rider.  Only with the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an antisocial villager with secrets of his own, do Eragon and his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) escape.  Then there's the matter of a beautiful young woman (Sienna Guillory) being held prisoner by Durza and the King, a band of fugitive rebels hiding in the mountains, and the young archer (Garrett Hedlund) who saves Eragon's life.It becomes clear fairly early on that Eragon isn't a Rider because he has a dragon: he has a dragon because he's a Rider.  The ability to work magic is in him--he just needs it trained--and Saphira has somehow sensed this (a dragon will wait forever to hatch if it has to, rather than emerge without its Rider to bond to).  There's plenty of fast action, scary villains, great costumes and armor (especially Saphira's wonderfully articulated suit), and of course splendid special effects (created, of course, by George Lucas's ILM), plus a powerful soundtrackSoundtrackby Patrick Doyle.

I even read the books that followed after that, Eldest and Brisingr. My problem with this movie is, in terms of adapting a succesfull book, its just lazy. It barely takes time to fully flesh out the story like the book did after the opening. We barely get to know the characters that exist here.The story follows into Alagaesia as its called, about a young man named Eragon who unintentionally finds a blue stone containing a dragon, and soon finds himself in a whirlwind of Dragon Riders, Elves, Dwarves(at least elves and dwarves were suppose to be in the movie), and an army consisting of the major elements ready to oppose an evil king.I won't lie. I did like the cast selected to be in this, but despite that: I still hated this movie. Its a real shame that Christopher Paolini sold out his work like this for it to become a movie, and for this to become an hour-and-a-half long disaster. The acting wasn't terrible at all. The bad dialogue was the major issue and the movie was playing away like it didnt care about the story. In terms of directing, the movie certainly does not lack for visual flair, but the another problem is the movie felt incomplete.

You can count the number of fantasy films made over the years on your fingers and toes. Of course, you have the Lord of the Rings, Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Conan etc. Secondly, how many times do you get to see a huge fire breathing dragon that looks really cool and REAL? Excellent effects.So, why only two stars?ERAGON is based on a book written by Christopher Paolini, who is most noteably known for beginning writting ERAGON when he was fifteen years-old. Good for him. I wish I were so lucky with the novel I wrote in high school.I haven't read the novel, but after watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that many of it seemed borrowed from other films. Many young writers write stories that steal from films they have seen. I know because I did. I know because many fellow writers I know struggled with the same thing. It's just nature. You watch movies and something grabs you. So, you cook up your own version in your head and put it to paper.So, with ERAGON, you get a story of a boy who falls into his destiny as a dragon rider. Yet, many of the themes of the film are borrowed from other films, like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragonheart, Harry Potter etc.ERAGON is a decent film. Yet, a forgettable one. I'm just disappointed that hollywood has once again put its weight behind a novelty movie. There have been many fantasy stories written in recent years, and many of them would have been more memorable and more lasting films.

""Eragon"" is a story that makes use of them all, and I suppose some of you may find this appealing due to the popularity of the fantasy genre. But others may see such tried and true inclusions as problematic. I'm one of those others. ""Eragon"" is an unimpressive, unoriginal effort, filled with ideas that have been utilized far too many times. I was not excited by anything this film had to offer, nor did I find anything particularly special about the characters. This is about as predictable as it gets when it comes to a fantasy film.Diehard fans of the original Christopher Paolini novel will most likely hate this film adaptation; it's pretty unfaithful to the source material (something that wasn't all that good to begin with). Those who have not read the novel may be a bit more flexible, though they still may find that something is lacking from the narrative quality, namely an original idea. It begins when Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) uses her magical powers to transport a shiny blue stone away from the clutches of the ruthless Durza (Robert Carlyle). It then lands in the middle of a forest and is found by young Eragon (Ed Speleers), a local farm boy with no previous acts of courage or heroism to his name. He immediately decides to take the stone home with him. Already, one of the many cliche elements enters the story: an object of power and mystery falls into the hands of the story's would-be hero. Can we say J.R.R. Tolkien?After returning home, Eragon discovers that what he possesses isn't a stone: it's an egg. It hatches, revealing a baby dragon that's surprisingly cute. Immediately, the two take on a pet/owner relationship, with the dragon responding affectionately to his petting. It quickly develops into a full-grown, majestic behemoth, with a striking blue tone to its scales. As it grows, Eragon discovers that it can hear his thoughts. Likewise, he can hear those of the dragon, and that's when he learns its identity: her name is Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz). He also learns that he's now destined to become a Dragon Rider, a medieval form of protection for the people. How they did this and why, I'm not entirely sure; their development as legendary figures is weak at best. What is explained is that, long ago, dragons and Dragon Riders were mercilessly slaughtered and are now considered extinct. Funny; I'm suddenly reminded of the Jedi Knights.Their demise was at the hands of King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a malevolent dictator who started out as a Dragon Rider before wanting to achieve complete control. He kept with him one remaining dragon's egg, the same one that was stolen by Arya and sent to Eragon. Now Galbatorix has to find this boy and kill him before he has the chance to become a Dragon Rider. We already have another cliche element: an evil figure has to hunt down and destroy a boy with a destiny. Eat your hearts out, J.K. Rowling and George Lucas.Helping Eragon on his journey is Brom (Jeremy Irons), a disgraced man with a troubled past. He understands how important Eragon is, and he does everything he can to prepare him for his new role in life. For one thing, he teaches the boy how to fight. He also informs him that a dragon's magic can turn a Dragon Rider into a wizard, giving him magical abilities he normally wouldn't have. Eragon quickly discovers that he's gained certain magical abilities, including being able to see what Saphira sees and shooting blue flames. He does all this by speaking words of an ancient Elvin language that supposedly takes a long time to learn. Miraculously, Eragon learns it after just a couple of scenes.This is but one example of how overly condensed this film felt. It was as if too many details were removed in order to make it simpler and easily understood by a mass audience. Consider the character of Murtagh (Garrett Hedlund); he meets Eragon under mysterious circumstances, then they both travel to a village hidden behind a waterfall (supposedly belonging to a group that opposes Galbatorix's rule). The leader of this group, Ajihad (Djimon Hounsou), immediately throws Murtagh in jail because of bad family ties. After that quick exchange, nothing more is learned. Here's a subplot that was virtually neglected, pretty much to the point of making Murtagh an unnecessary character. What exactly did his father do to make Ajihad's people hate him?The truth is that all of the characters felt underdeveloped: Eragon's back story is barely mentioned; his cousin, Roran (Chris Egan) leaves the film before he can say anything insightful; Brom's role is superceded by Eragon's mission; and Arya is probably the biggest mystery of all, with no clear purpose other than being Durza's captive. I was especially disappointed with Galbatorix; while Malkovich's performance was good (if incredibly short), it seemed as if it belonged in a different film, specifically one that's not of the fantasy genre. I never once believed that he fit into this imaginative world, which is a shame considering his range as an actor. Still, his character is fierce and overbearing, enough so to instill fear in Durza.I suppose I have to give ""Eragon"" credit for its decent special effects and stunning cinematography; the film was certainly wonderful to look at, especially during some breathtaking flight scenes with Eragon and Saphira. Fans of the fantasy genre will definitely get their money's worth: if you want a classic Good vs. Evil fable with caricatures, that's exactly what you're going to get. I guess I'm at a point where I want to see something new, something that doesn't begin with a young boy being chosen and end with a frenetic battle sequence. The ads for this film say that it's the first chapter in the Inheritance Trilogy, meaning that the sequel--""Eldest""--is already on the way. I can't say that I'm looking forward to it. For that matter, I'm not looking forward to the third film, either; if both are anything like the first, then we're in for one of the most uninspired trilogies in existence.",3,Once Upon a Dragon's

1055332,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000NA28HU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 2]","Most people, at least those who read books and watch movies, agree that usually the book is better than the movie that is based on it. Books are more interesting and principled whereas film only has the fun factor going for it. You can't have a blue CGI dragon in your book, for instance. Well, sad to say I found the book version of ""Eragon"" to be a mess, marred by a 12 year olds vocab and a cliche filled laundry list of fantasy book must haves. There are dragons and languages (mentioned but never developed) and arbitrary rules. It was also an overweight book made that way to in hopes of keeping with the tradition of that genre. Even sadder to say that the hypothesis holds true in this case as well as the movie version is an ever bigger mess. Only this time there are millions upon millions of dollars involved so everything had to feel safe and sanitized. In fact, it looks as though the makers were solely focused on making a decent looking dragon and that they ignored that whole plot thing so much that it resulted in a disturbingly dull and uninspired film. I'm sure they didn't care because people show up for the CGI dragons not the tale being told, and with this being a blue dragon and all I'm sure the producers slept easy at night dreaming of children lined around the block clutching their dollar bills and studio marketed merchandise. But then the movie opened, as movies tend to do, and it got trounced by Will Smith playing poor in ""Pursuit of Happyness"". Of course this film is terrible and deserves the shellacking it took but my concern lies with the rest of the trilogy they had promised us. I sincerely hope that the egg ""Eragon"" laid last winter won't be the end of ""Eldest"" and the subsequent sequel. Fox just needs to saddle up and make a better movie, then those kids will actually show up.The film is quite obviously trying to be ""Lord of the Rings"" for a smaller set. The story involves an impoverished people living under the boot of a ruthless king (yawn). One day a boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds an egg which hatches the oh so famous blue dragon. Since the dragon, Saphira, becomes the hope of the proletariat the evil powers that be feel as though she must be killed. Jeremy Irons, good here but no miracle worker, is the town rabble rouser who sits in the town tavern and taunts the royal guards. Soon he joins forces with Eragon and Saphira to hunt down some young piece of meat who honestly nobody cares about. Eragon, like all kids these days, feels as though he can conquer the world just by mustering enough can do spirit. It is the type of mind set that lands people in the Middle East. The team travels the countryside dodging baddies and trying (and failing) to crack wise. It is all a pretext for some stupid battle that only exists to send the fan boys home happy. And really there is no reason this movie had to be so unwatchable, it is just poorly written and poorly directed. Plus Speleers acting won the movie no points either. He with his frozen face and forced delivery was plucked from who knows where for his ability to attract the Tiger Beat crowd, not his acting ability.  How do I know this? Well because near the end of the movie, for no good reason, he takes his shirt off and shows us some skin.

It very excellent captures the pointless characters, the ripped-off plot, the badly-done setting and clunky dialogue. To those things is adds mediocre acting, lousy directing and even worse dialogue.On agonybooth.com there's a write up of this movie. It points out certain things that seem obvious, but escaped the filmmaker's attention (like why is Eragon hunting in the middle of the night? Why does this ""poor farm boy"", live on what is, by mideval standards, a small estate? Why does he keep his bow strung and hung on a wall? Why does his cousin wear blue jeans? This, mind, is in the first ten minutes). The film also leaves one wondering why the Evil Bad Guy (tm), keeps his throne room so darkly lit. Surely there's tons of people who wanna stab him. Logically, shouldn't he keep his space bright and cheerful in order to keep from being snuck up on? (and no, I'm not sure of the grammar there, either)Given the source materiel, I don't know if it was possible at any point for this to be made into a decent movie. None of the actors are bad. Some of them are quite good, just horrible in their roles. I know it would've been helpful had the elven character had pointy ears and had the dwarf character not been the same height as everyone else.Basically, this is a movie that makesDungeons & Dragons (New Line Platinum Series)look intelligent and complex. It's the kind of movie that gives fantasy films a bad name. Had this film been made before the Lord of the Rings movies, it would have merely been stupid.

It had such potential to be great but ended up mediocre. I'm not sure if Edward S. is a bad actor or badly directed. I'm leaning towards the latter since he did manage to pull it off at times. The wierd ""eye widening"" that happened oftem didn't seem genuine and when he made his way to the fallen Saphira after the final battle I almost laughed at the way he ""struggled"" to reach her. It would have been better if he'd crawled a foot or two, then dragged himself to his feet then hurried as much as his battered body would allow until he collapsed at her side. Typed out is sounds just as lame as what actually happened but in the mind it looks better than both.Plus, what was with the funky editing? Are we telling a story or a series of scenes? It got better as it went along but at the beginning it was a bit painful.And fianlly, the final battle. Was there actually a battle or just a dragon burning everything in site? As it was told in the movie, I fail to see how having a dragon on their side made any real difference. Where's the give and take? Where's the back and forth betwen the bad guy getting ahead and the good guys getting their shot. Where's the sudden burst of inspiration that leads to an unexpected twist that finales in a win for the good guys?Maybe I expect too much after LOTR. As my sister said, this was no Helm's Deep. A poor man's Helm's Deep.I don't feel the original writing was that bad. I get the feeling there was more to the battle but we didn't get to see it.There's forshadowing and then there's just giving away the end.That said, Eraon was entertaining to watch,as I said, if you've never read the book , which I haven't.Once again.

1055337,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000NA28HU,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 6]","I have to say one thing upfront: I have never read Eragon, or its sequel, Eldest. I'm walking into this story completely fresh without hopes of ""better than the book"". In that regard, I simply cannot figure out just how this story got published. Not only is it derivative and oddly has some parts that seems stolen, it's not even an interesting story by any stretch. Of course you wouldn't think so considering the abundance of special features which suggests this is like some prestige title, or simply giving off the impression it's more important than it is. It's not, but then again it's not completely without merit; it's just you have to look really hard to find it.In the land of Alagaesia, dragon riders were once the powerful group of people who wielded special abilities and were able to ride powerful fire-breathing dragons. But one dragon rider, Galbatorix, all but wiped out the dragons and thanks to him, the land is in turmoil. Enter Eragon, a 17 year old farmboy who discovers a blue egg one night which eventually hatches and a blue dragon appears. Eragon is now the main focus of Galbatorix and his right-hand man Durza, who is a wizard or as they're called here, a ""Shade"". With the help of Brom, an older man with a talent for how to survive in the world (read: a former warrior), and Arya, a beautiful Elf princess, Eragon has to work together with his dragon, Saphira, to bring down Galbatorix.Even typing that, I couldn't help but thinking how nerdy it would sound with people asking if I made it up. Nope, it's all the story you need. It's unbelievably hard to get into the story when you keep seeing familiar plot devices, not just in the story but the film itself. Since it is an adaptation, the very book will have story elements similar to Star Wars (farm boy Eragon with uncle who becomes a Dragon Rider = Luke with uncle who becomes a Jedi) to Lord of the Rings (elf princess Arwen = elf princess Arya, enemy Ra'zac = Uruk-Hai/Orc). But worse is the familiar scenes like when Durza addresses his minions in a scene eerily similar to Saruman addressing his minions before Helm's Deep. Durza might as well shout ""to war!"".So the story's way too familiar so how's the casting? It's hard to imagine a talented pool of actors looking so uninterested. At least Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle act like they're trying but everyone else is either haphazardly directed or they have a ""this is a nerd movie so act accordingly"" look. Only bright spot is Sienna Guillory since she just looks so cute. Now did they do anything right in the film? Sure, some of the dragon effects - some - look pretty convincing and like a lot of people thought, the box sure does look neat but other than that you tend to look hard for the good parts.This bad a movie you'd think the studios would cheap us out on special features right? Nope since we got tons of stuff from looks into the characters, the effects, interviews with the author where he reveals some tiny insights about the trilogy (which'll most likely have even more lifted stuff in book 3). It's quite an ingenious move though: pack the DVD with tons of features to give the impression this is like Lord of the Rings or films by Ridley Scott that are filled to the brim with special features. But in the end it's a case of either misguided optimism (""I don't know what people are complaining about, we made a great movie!"" attitude) or just sucker people in thinking this is a purchase-worthy package.It's a sad day when the only things you remember are the cover art, a beautiful actress and the notion that the story seems like a big combination of everything in sci-fi and fantasy literature. To paraphrase a quote from Treebeard: there's no curse in the language of Man, Tree or Elvish for the travesty that is Eragon.",2,"Strangely, I knew it would be bad",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,3789,"['have', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'upfront', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Eragon', 'sequel', 'Eldest', ""'m"", 'walking', 'story', 'completely', 'fresh', 'hopes', 'better', 'book', 'regard', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'story', 'got', 'published', 'Not', 'only', 'derivative', 'oddly', 'parts', 'stolen', 'not', 'even', 'interesting', 'story', 'stretch', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'considering', 'abundance', 'special', 'features', 'prestige', 'title', 'simply', 'giving', 'off', 'impression', 'more', 'important', 'not', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'completely', 'merit', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'it.In', 'land', 'Alagaesia', 'dragon', 'riders', 'were', 'once', 'powerful', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'wielded', 'special', 'abilities', 'were', 'able', 'ride', 'powerful', 'fire-breathing', 'dragons', 'one', 'dragon', 'rider', 'Galbatorix', 'wiped', 'out', 'dragons', 'thanks', 'land', 'turmoil', 'Enter', 'Eragon', '17', 'year', 'old', 'farmboy', 'who', 'blue', 'egg', 'one', 'night', 'eventually', 'hatches', 'blue', 'dragon', 'Eragon', 'now', 'main', 'focus', 'Galbatorix', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Durza', 'who', 'wizard', ""'re"", 'called', 'here', 'Shade', 'help', 'Brom', 'older', 'man', 'talent', 'how', 'survive', 'world', 'read', 'former', 'warrior', 'Arya', 'beautiful', 'Elf', 'princess', 'Eragon', 'work', 'together', 'dragon', 'Saphira', 'bring', 'down', 'Galbatorix.Even', 'typing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'how', 'nerdy', 'would', 'sound', 'people', 'asking', 'made', 'up', 'Nope', 'story', 'need', 'unbelievably', 'hard', 'get', 'story', 'when', 'keep', 'seeing', 'familiar', 'plot', 'devices', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'film', 'adaptation', 'very', 'book', 'will', 'have', 'story', 'elements', 'similar', 'Star', 'Wars', 'farm', 'boy', 'Eragon', 'uncle', 'who', 'Dragon', 'Rider', '=', 'Luke', 'uncle', 'who', 'Jedi', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'princess', 'Arwen', '=', 'princess', 'Arya', 'enemy', ""Ra'zac"", '=', 'Uruk-Hai/Orc', 'worse', 'familiar', 'scenes', 'when', 'Durza', 'minions', 'scene', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Saruman', 'addressing', 'minions', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'Durza', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'war', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'familiar', 'how', 'casting', 'hard', 'imagine', 'talented', 'pool', 'actors', 'looking', 'so', 'uninterested', 'least', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'act', ""'re"", 'trying', 'everyone', 'else', 'haphazardly', 'directed', 'have', 'nerd', 'movie', 'act', 'accordingly', 'look', 'Only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'just', 'so', 'cute', 'Now', 'did', 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'film', 'Sure', 'dragon', 'effects', 'look', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'lot', 'people', 'thought', 'box', 'sure', 'look', 'neat', 'other', 'tend', 'look', 'hard', 'good', 'parts.This', 'bad', 'movie', ""'d"", 'think', 'studios', 'would', 'cheap', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'right', 'Nope', 'got', 'tons', 'stuff', 'characters', 'effects', 'interviews', 'author', 'where', 'tiny', 'insights', 'trilogy', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'lifted', 'stuff', 'book', '3', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'move', 'pack', 'DVD', 'tons', 'features', 'give', 'impression', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'are', 'filled', 'brim', 'special', 'features', 'end', 'case', 'misguided', 'optimism', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'attitude', 'just', 'sucker', 'people', 'thinking', 'purchase-worthy', 'package.It', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'only', 'things', 'remember', 'are', 'cover', 'art', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'notion', 'story', 'big', 'combination', 'everything', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'literature', 'paraphrase', 'quote', 'Treebeard', 'curse', 'language', 'Man', 'Tree', 'Elvish', 'travesty', 'Eragon']",N/A

1055341,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B000NA28HU,Crystal Starr Light,"[3, 3]","After puttingEragon (Inhertitance)on my summer reading list, I thought, ""Now I am prepared to watch the movie.""  I am sure glad I read the book or the movie would have made little sense.Plot:Overall, the same as the book (with huge chunks condensed, combined, or otherwise mutilated).  Eragon lives in the mountains with his uncle and cousin until he finds a mysterious ""stone"". He quickly discovers this stone is an egg when it hatches to reveal a dragon he calls Saphira. However, Galbatorix's agents are searching for, in this version, Eragon himself. Eragon's uncle dies, and Eragon leaves his home with a mysterious storyteller, Brom, and his dragon, Saphira, to head off to the Varden (instead of revenge). During their travels, Brom speed teaches Eragon about the legacy of an order called the Riders, sword fighting, and magic (all taking a grand total of one lesson to be grasped), they battle beings called ""Urgals"", and Eragon searches for his purpose.Good:The special effects are awesome.  Saphira was well done and meshed well into the rest of the characters.  Not once did I think, ""Wow, she's CG.""  Jeremy Irons stands out as Brom, the only interesting character in this version.  He captures the rugged former dragon rider, now teacher role well.Bad:It's so long, but I'll summarize.1.  I don't know why, but someone thought this needed to fit into an hour and a half timeslot.  So a team went through the 730 page book and started yanking out pages, gluing others together.  So many incidents either don't happen (Brom and Eragon don't go to the village decimated by Urgals) or rush past (Murtagh's intro, Angela's fortune telling, and pretty much every other characters' introduction) or are combined in silly ways (Brom dying while Eragon and he rescued Arya--really?!?).2.  I hated how everyone knows when the dragon hatched and to whom it hatched to.  Puh-leaze.3.  The villains are weak.  I feel they had the strength of a slug.4.  Why didn't Arya have pointed ears?  She was an Elf, right?5.  The ending diverged so much from the book.  Saphira almost died?  Yeah, right!6.  So many characters were hacked.  Murtagh had all of three lines.  The Twins were omitted.  The leader was given two.  Angela was given one scene.  And what happened to the werecat?I may not have thought the book was the best thing to have ever happened in the world (read my review), but compared to this movie, it looks like a new-found classic!Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:PG style dialogue.  Arya wears some form-fitting battle wear.  Violence includes a man piercing people with his finger nail, sword-fights, and magic induced battles.Overall:If you were a fan of the book, you will hate this movie as it cuts out any culture, background, or character that the book had.  If you sort of liked the book, you will probably still hate this movie (like myself).  If you didn't read or didn't like the book, you will have a good chance of hating this movie (like my poor sister who hadn't read the book and probably never will now).  My advice?

1055345,A1UIMU8Q87ZPCH,B000NA28HU,"Darren Levine ""He shoots, He Edits, He freque...","[1, 1]","This rant has been long overdue, but a recent case in point has me in awe of what I already knew to be true. I was loaned the novel Eragon, within a week and a half, finished the 400+ page work of good fiction. The day after finishing it, I watched the movie. Now I know you already know what I would say about it. That the movie was a vapid vacuous menstruation of an adaptation, casted with insanity, pieced together with madness, and forced with every word out of every orifice.I wish I had a better memory, I do, because before I finish this rant I will have forgotten some of the things that I wanted to imbibe into you.But back to the main rant. Eragon, was a book which had characters of great depth. Over 400 pages each of the characters ALLUDED to many things, but let the reader wonder about them, and certain things did get revealed, some not. What about the movie you ask? Allude was not in the screenwriter's limited vocabulary apparently. Every single detail was forced out into the open either directly or within a few minutes, Leaving no wonder, no possibilities, just strait, shoved, excrement, into, your, viewing, mouth. You get nice heap of It right in the beginning with the bring-me-up-to-speed voice over recap. Hollywood: fail.The story, did they stick to it? Well... actually yes... if you call using the same names and rushing through scenes and making new garbage up as you go just to get to the finish line then yes, they stuck to what a delusional misfit would call a &#8220;story.&#8221; I can't get through a month without hollywood taking a great work of literature and using the same names, sketch, and watered down motives and then do whatever the heck else they want with it. But how do they make it all work together? Aerial Shots!! Yes! If we do a dozen or so helicopter shots of them riding their horses over the tops of mountains then the audience will be distracted enough to not realize that this dung reeks! Meanwhile all im thinking is why in holy heeeell would anyone not on LSD ride to the top of a damn mountain for no reason when traveling at their base would be easier. In case you aren't following along: their destination wasn't the top of any mountain, they just for some reason liked to travel out in the open where their pursuers could find them easier. Nail in the coffin: throughout the entire book, they obsess about keeping low and hidden from view. Hollywood: Epic F******ckeeen Fail. This also leaves no excuse as to why they cut important scenes out, get rid of the damn aerials and give us something REAL.And what of the characters? Surely they came out OK? Wrong. And with that I need to ask: Did elves become unmarketable or something? I ask because one of the primary driving characters who was in fact an elf in the book just decided not to be an elf in the movie. What the heck was to be gained or avoided by making her not an elf? I can find no damn reason whatsoever.... Dwarves too, they disappeared from the movie, not even a mention. Seems the screenwriter doesn't like anything non human... OH and the Urgals too, in the book they were kind of like hagred in harry potter, but beastlier and with horns, maybe if hagred slept with an Orc and then that offspring slept with an ox, but still walk like a human. But in the movie, nope, just regular old beer bellied Giants and Jets fans who really have a hard on for putting indian like dots all over their faces. Seriously, whoever made this movie really really doesn't like anything but humans.... It's called the fantasy world idiot, if you're not into it, don't be involved in it.And details hollywood, do you know the definition of what a detail is? Little things, like,.... why the heck  does the dragon have FEATHERS? Let me take a look around every single instance i've ever seen a dragon represented in... hmm, any feathers? I think NOT. WHAT did you have to gain by turning the dragon into a effin' parrot? Did the animator tell the producer that his computer had trouble rendering membranes, but could handle feathers with ease? And then there is the mark on the rider's hand, which was supposed to be just a silvery patch. Apparently in the movie the makeup artist forgot their silver paint, so instead just squiggled a little scar on there instead.I want to talk for a second about character development. Why? Because there wasn't any, THAT'S why. In the book the main character GROWS, it's something that happens in good storys, and in the movie there isn't a SINGLE DAMN thread of growth in this character, absolutely NOTHING. And as I sit here munching on my butter flavored rice cakes, I think of the whiny turd they chose to play Eragon. In the book he is a deep, interesting figure who is driven by his curiosity. This actor whose pitchy voice I can't stand, plays this character like monkey playing with his dingaling. There is no depth, there is no intrigue, there is no character in what this abortion of an actor plays. Though I can't blame it all on him, nowhere in the script does he have any chance to grow. But dammit if your playing a turd for god sake don't polish it. Hide the damn thing behind as much good acting as you can. Which is where Jeremy Irons comes in. He is, one of my favorite actors. He has great depth to his performances(except dungeons and dragons, we're not going to remember that one). In the book Brom is a great character. But what Mr. Irons was given was a character who was shriveled up and belittled, with nothing else to it. And jesus you could FEEL the depth TRYING to ooze out of his performance, and the dialogue that came out just shot down what should have been there. The growth through their time together In the book defined much of the story, and hollywood cut every single piece out. But don't worry, they put in a dragon made of smoke! If you actually enjoyed that part, then hollywood has won.And then we throw john malkovich in there, playing a character that was never in any scenes in the book, just mentioned. Being prepped for the later novel, but hollywood couldn't wait, they had to force him in there, again leaving no wonder for anything to come. If I wanted to be spoonfed, i'd put on a fake beard, dye my hair grey, and admit myself to a retirement home. Keep this garbage out of my movies.And in the last few minutes they reach their allies just in time to be attacked. No character development in the allies called the Varden, but don't worry, the leader wears a big funny hat. No detail in the mountain city which was spectacular in the book and turned into a caveman living room in the movie.This is a serious problem people, especially since hollywood is now trying to pretend it's indie, which was our last hope.There needs to be accountability, but there never will be. Book writers need to retain control over their work so that hollywood degenerates don't take a big steamy one all over it. Primary blame can be placed on the adapters, they either adapted it out of their own accord, or they were influenced by the produces, and either way I'd want to see them strung up for doing so.I am calling for an impeachment of Hollywood. What it pushes us is the wrong end of the 80/20 principle, which for those of you who aren't familiar with that philosophy, its that 20 percent of an effort usually equals 80 percent of the outcome. So if I were to make 100 products and sell them, 20 of those products would make 80 percent of the overall money, whilst the remaining 80 products would steam over like a pile of fresh dung. That's where hollywood comes in, if you have not guessed, it is the dung. 80 percent of what hollywood shows us is pure garbage, and not just any garbage, real special garbage, because this garbage now costs us 10-12 Dollars to watch on a big screen. And just you wait, if that garbage is in 3D, then it'll cost you 20-30% more.Hollywood, you suck. You are nothing of of the glory which you used to be. You are a shriveled, greedy little single celled fart in the wind. You have no artistic merit or shred of decent motive. With the exception of the few great filmmakers who have the power to make movies their way and say shut the heck up to the system, I have zero respect for what has become of the now 'so called' cinema. Today's movies are filled with a minimum number of explosions, aerials, sex scenes, and other plot neutral elements which studios force into the script to ensure the extra dollar is made from the lower IQ audience who can be entertained by the equivalent of dangling shiny keys in front of a cat.And that is where I have to force myself to stop this rant, despite being able to go on and on. Ignoring punctuation, spelling, and any remote sense of proper writing style, just so I can get this rage out of my head. What could have been a Lord of the Rings level epic series of movies was raped into being a turd of mediocrity.",1,This is proof as to why hollywood needs to perish in a napalm attack,1388534400,"01

The acting wasn't bad, the cinematography was wonderful, and it was overall well-done in terms of production.  The problem is that there just wasn't a lot to work with in terms of a script.  It needed another hour to make sense.  It skipped a lot which was in the book.  There was a two-minute discussion about 15 minutes in, then a main character gets introduced who was related to that discussion, but it was an ""if you blinked you missed it moment"".  The key battle at the end, altered for the screen, lacked a lot of the punch it had in the book.  And let's not even get into the lack of training... one minute we have a kid who has a ""oh, man, I'm a WHAT?!?"" moment, then five minutes later he's ""super mage"".  Uh huh.

1055351,A8MTO1HMPRVVR,B000NA28HU,D. R. Folkerts,"[3, 4]","Let me start by saying I am an adult in my 40s and I really enjoyed the books!  Yes, the writing is a little immature in book one (it gets better in Eldest), and the plot is something of a rehash.  Big hairy deal, LOTR fans need to get over themselves already!!!  It still is a fun read, and I was really looking forward to the movie.Biggest weakness--103 minutes, what are you kidding me??  The first ""act"" up to the part where Saphira flies was very well done.  Yes, they changed a lot from the book, but I thought it still captured the spirit of the books.  Jeremy Irons was not what I expected for Brom, but he's such a terrific actor I found myself liking him anyway.  However, they really should have added 5 or 10 minutes in there to show an implied time span and a scene where Eragon helps Saphira pick her name (with or without talking to Brom first, as he does in the book).  The sudden growing up thing just came across as stupid, and from there the movie morphed into breakneck speed so fast to be virtually unenjoyable.  The day after we watched the film, my teen son and my spouse both separately asked if we could sit down and watch ""the rest of the movie""!!  (We saw the normal edition, not realizing there was a 2-disk with cut scenes at least!!)There was also an annoying lack of attention to character details.  Some of this could have been solved by adding more time to the film (even the 17 minutes to make it a full 2-hour film would have been appreciated!!), but some of it was just sloppy inattention to detail.  The man with the beard who was maybe 3"" shorter than Eragon at best seemed to have been intended as a dwarf.  The director explains in his commentary that he ""wanted to do something different"" with the urgals by neglecting their horns and/or heavy makeup, but what he mainly did differently was nothing at all!!  Their red eyes was the only thing that helped us recognize them as anything other than rather dirty poorly dressed humans!  We can forgive the director for casting Arya as blonde, but could he not spare a couple of dollars in his budget to give her pointy ears??  Elves are portrayed differently in different books, I realize, but ALL of them have pointy ears, and as it was she came across as some kind of human amazon woman.  :(  Galbatorix also needed... something.  He came across as whiney with bad dialogue, not evil or frightening.  This is all the director and screenplay, as Galbatorix does not appear in the first book at all (except as a topic of conversation).The film is still a fun watch though, and they definitely took pains to make it family friendly.  The special effects on Saphira were really wonderful!!  I gave it 3 stars largely for this reason alone, because if the dragon was bad the whole movie would be hopeless.  I thought the casting overall was very good, and the actors did a good job of pulling it off even when the lines were rather lame on occasion.  Although they changed a lot from the book, I thought it still would have worked if they had just stretched the length enough to make it work.

In a pinch, it'll settle for ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" with a dash of Harry Potter.But those hoping for a spectacular PG-rated epic shouldn't hold their breaths, because the adaptation of Christopher Paolini's bestseller is a massive bellyflop. The direction is stilted and plodding, the acting is on par with tree stumps, and the whole thing is uninspired -- it never moves beyond ""quick cash-in.""A young woman is being chased through the woods by a band of evil soldiers, trying to recapture a bright blue stone she stole from evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), but she magics it away. It's found in the woods by a young farm boy, Eragon (Edward Speleers), who unsuccessfully tries to trade it for food. But the stone turns out to be a dragon's egg.When his home and uncle are destroyed, Eragon escapes with his now-grown dragon Saphira (Rachael Weisz) and a mysterious stranger named Brom (Jeremy Irons), who knows a lot about the Dragon Riders. Now Eragon and Saphira may be the only hope for the land, not to mention the captive elf princess he's dreaming about, and whom he has to rescue from the evil king.Dragons, damsels in distress, magic spells, an evil king and his evil wizard, and a Young Hero in the Luke Skywalker mold... well, ""Eragon"" had a lot of obstacles in front of it from the start. It sounds like the love child of ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings""... except it's infinitely more clumsy than either of those movies.And the director doesn't help -- Stefan Fangmeier is horribly crude and clumsy in his directing, with a style that manages to be both stilted and choppy. The scripting is even worse. Expect the most pompous, cliched fantasyspeak imaginable (""It is your fate to be a Dragon Rider. The Varden need a Rider if they are to defeat Durza and the king."" ""I didn't ask for any of this!"" ""But you were chosen, nevertheless!"").It's not surprising, since Fangmeier has never even directed a short film before. His only prior movie work has been for visual effects, which might explain why the CGI for Saphira the dragon is so beautifully detailed and fluid. Wonderful work there. But not enough to make you forget the rest of the movie.Speleers looks like a deer in the headlights, while Sienna Guillory has all the elegance and magic of hobbit feet, and Malkovich is given the most 2-D villain role of the 21st century. The supporting actors give the only solid performances, miscast as they are -- Weisz gives a wonderfully nuanced performance, while Irons is solid as the mentor figure.""Eragon"" has the occasional good performance or moment of excellence -- usually from Weisz as Saphira.

However, I went to the movie, and left feeling satisfied.Jeremy Irons as Brom is solid as always, Rachel Weisz's voice is perfect as Saphira - although the conversations between Saphira's character and Eragon are quite limited compared to the book. Edward Seepeler's is young, and so not as experienced, but again, he's not as bad as everyone has made him out to be.

1055358,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000NA28HU,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 2]","NOTE: This review contains major spoilersSeeing as how the original novel by Christopher Paolini is the worst novel I have ever read (for now), I became curious as how the movie adaptation fared out. Critics panned the movie for obviously being a LOTR/Star Wars ripoff, and audiences disliked it for being unfaithful to the source material. Despite all the criticisms, however, I saw the movie, anyway. Now, I've seen some really bad films in my life, such as Battlefield Earth, The Hot Chick, Chicken Little, and so forth. ""Eragon"" is.....well, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's worse than the movies I've just mentioned, but I'll explain.First, I will say the film does have some nice scenery and a couple of decent special effects shots (the flight sequence, for example). But it all ends there as the rest of the movie fails to achieve greatness in many ways. The story, much like the book, is heavily borrowed from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even The Wheel of Time (The Spine, anyone?). While the movie is notably different from the book, you can still spot the clich&eacute;s from beginning to end. I mentioned in my written review for the original novel that the author basically recycles one of the oldest fantasy formulas ever known (average villager leaves home, goes on a quest, delves into his family history, becomes a great warrior, etc.) and adds nothing that's new to the genre. Well, the evidence in the movie is still strong if you observe closely. The mentor trains our main hero to become a great swordsman, that's a clich&eacute;. The mean heroine is pretty much a damsel in distress, that's another clich&eacute;. Our main hero is revealed to be the Chosen One, that's the most obvious clich&eacute;. You know, I find it interesting that in many fantasy stories, there's just one person who is destined to restore peace and destroy evil forever. Why not a trio of heroes, or a quintet? Well, anyway, the plot is pretty much riddled with clich&eacute;s, and adds nothing new to the fantasy genre. The movie itself is basically one of the most simplistic fantasy films ever created. And you might argue that this is just a family film. Well, families aren't stupid.And if you think the story is bad, you haven't examined the character of Eragon (Ed Speleers). One of the biggest problems I had with the book was the main character: his personality was disorganized, and his chemistry with the other characters were very awkward (Arya, for example). Nothing is changed. The Eragon that we see in the film is the same handsome boy who embraces the same exaggerated nobility and becomes the same savior of the human race. The arrogance in the character is also shown in the middle of the film when he confronts Brom (Jeremy Irons); he acts like a grownup before and after he realizes that Brom used to be a dragon rider himself. In fact, the entire race of the Varden seems hopeless until Eragon enters the picture. In addition, I've noticed that Eragon's clothes are remarkably clean for a villager. When he's living in Carvahall, his clothes look like they come from a prince compared to everyone else. Did he just buy his own washing machine or something? So basically, there are many things wrong about this character. I mean, here's a kid who enters a fort to save Arya (Sienna Guillory), and no one is aware that he is about to rescue one of their own prisoners. The guards must be idiots. And what's worse, he doesn't even get hurt when he escapes. Not a scratch. The guards must REALLY be idiots. And Durza (Robert Carlyle), one of the main antagonists in the story, can't even break this kid's finger. HE must be an idiot. And Brom is the only one who is fatally injured. He's.....pretty lucky to be killed off in a movie like this. To be quite honest, Eragon is one of the oddest characters I have ever seen in a movie. This so-called average villager finds a blue-colored egg in the woods and he is not the least bit shocked that it hatches and out pops a baby dragon. He just smiles. Like an idiot. He's an idiot. Then, he has high hopes for becoming a dragon rider, and yet he doesn't think of the dangers that he would face. Can't he just pose for GQ or something? And THEN, he wants to rescue Arya, and he thinks that he can take on dozens of people with only a sword and a limited use of magic. The guards are still idiots, but not as idiotic as Eragon.And do they really expect us to believe that Eragon can learn to become a dragon rider in such a short time? And learn a different language in such a short time? And fall in love with an unknown elf who looks old enough to be his mother?Incredible.But we're not going to stop there. There are other things about this movie that can make you lose your appetite.  The dialogue is cheesy and poorly written. The music is horribly overblown. John Malkovitch as Galbatorix is an embarrassment, complete with a terrible attempt at a foreign accent. Ed Speleers as Eragon is a terrible bore, and he isn't trying hard enough to actually act (granted, this IS his first starring role in a movie, so I guess that's the reason why). Rachael Weisz's voice is inappropriate for Saphira as her lightweight tone doesn't mix with the character's strong-minded personality. The sexual innuendo is pretty obvious (this is rated PG, right?). The special effects are bland; nothing special comes out of it. The action scenes are dull. What have I left out? Oh yes, a few scenes are unintentionally goofy, so don't eat or drink anything while you're watching this movie.Reading the novel was a dismal experience. Watching the movie was a dismal experience. Knowing that Hollywood actually had the guts to adapt the novel into a movie was a DISMALLY dismal experience. ""Eragon"" is basically a silly, simplistic, clich&eacute;d, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and badly pretentious fantasy film that doesn't deserve the $250 million that it earned at the box office. It's one of those movies that just don't work. Babies, kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, and humans in general deserve better than this.Grade: F",1,"Can a movie be just as bad as the book it's based on?

1055360,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000NA28HU,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[3, 4]","Going into this movie, I was expecting a mediocre and boring piece of film which would fall into the cracks of movies never to return again. Instead, it's like one of those strange 80's fantasy films which didn't fit into the whole feel of the day, but holds enough charm to one day become a backwoods classic. Think ""Labyrinth"" and other such movies. And contrary to the opinion of so many ravingly insane and stalker-like fans, this movie isn't half-bad.I don't know where all the ""Star Wars"" comparisons were coming from, except for that suspicious sunset scene. But anyways, this felt a lot like Lord of The Rings. And that's what this movie aspires to be, with the Peter Jackson like pans of the journey over breath-taking landscapes. Who know Hungry could look that good?So while this movie doesn't exactly do anything new, I didn't really expect it to be, when all fantasy works steal off each other anyway. This movie is a combination of those Tolkienesque quest epics, and those dragon movies which never seemed to strike a chord with audiences. See that's 90's dragon movie whose name I can't think of, and that Christian Bale evil dragon film which I kinda liked.Another bad point to this movie is just the poor choice of director and writer. If you're going to do a big movie like this, don't give it to a first-timer. And as for writer, let's just say it's fun to guess what the character is going to say, before they actually say it. Fun game.As for characters, Eragon is likeable, yet immature and stupid. Jeremy (love that name) Irons does the best with what he is given. And the girl, what can I say, she doesn't look half-bad. But here's a question while we're at it. Is all Elvish the same? Do Lord of The Rings Elves, and Eragon Elves speak the same language? And why do they sound so different from Santa Clause Elves?Anyways, the bad guys on the other hand, are pretty bad, mean, cardboard, evil, and you wish for them to go away, in a bad way. And those soldiers sure seem a lot like Orcs. Here's another question. Why did Rachel Weiz lose her English accent for her dragon role? I didn't even know it was her.But onto the good points. The action, while not original, is entertaining. The sword fights are cool, and the battles, while not exactly impressive, are interesting. The story, while not original, is interesting, and mostly keeps your attention. It also avoids the ugly fate of Golden Compass, by keeping down the confusing mythology. Although they could have cut down on the Elvish a little bit.But for the best part of the movie, let's give a round of applause for the director. Because I thank him for keeping the movie a little more than an hour and a half. Not 3 hours, not 2 hours. Just a nice little hour and a 38 minutes. But although this is a very nice running time, the director could have easily cut down many scenes to make this a true 1 hour and a 1/2.Overall, while not exactly original or brilliant, it's Lord of The Rings light. It keeps you interested throughout the whole movie, it has some cool sequences, and some characters are pretty likeable. And again, I like the running time. So don't listen to the crazed and mentally unstable fanatics of the much-overrated book, this movie could have been a whole lot worse.Real Score: 3.5",4,Lord of The Rings Light,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,3285,"['Going', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'mediocre', 'boring', 'piece', 'film', 'would', 'fall', 'cracks', 'movies', 'never', 'return', 'again', 'Instead', 'one', 'strange', '80', 'fantasy', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'whole', 'feel', 'day', 'enough', 'charm', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'backwoods', 'classic', 'Think', 'Labyrinth', 'other', 'such', 'movies', 'contrary', 'opinion', 'so', 'many', 'ravingly', 'insane', 'stalker-like', 'fans', 'movie', ""n't"", 'half-bad.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Star', 'Wars', 'comparisons', 'were', 'coming', 'suspicious', 'sunset', 'scene', 'felt', 'lot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'what', 'movie', 'be', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'pans', 'journey', 'breath-taking', 'landscapes', 'Who', 'know', 'Hungry', 'could', 'look', 'good', 'So', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'be', 'when', 'fantasy', 'works', 'steal', 'off', 'other', 'anyway', 'movie', 'combination', 'Tolkienesque', 'quest', 'epics', 'dragon', 'movies', 'never', 'seemed', 'strike', 'chord', 'audiences', 'See', '90', 'dragon', 'movie', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'evil', 'dragon', 'film', 'kinda', 'liked.Another', 'bad', 'point', 'movie', 'just', 'poor', 'choice', 'director', 'writer', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'big', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'first-timer', 'writer', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'fun', 'guess', 'what', 'character', 'going', 'say', 'actually', 'say', 'Fun', 'game.As', 'characters', 'Eragon', 'likeable', 'yet', 'immature', 'stupid', 'Jeremy', 'love', 'name', 'Irons', 'best', 'what', 'given', 'girl', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'look', 'half-bad', 'here', 'question', ""'re"", 'Elvish', 'same', 'Do', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Elves', 'Eragon', 'Elves', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'why', 'do', 'sound', 'so', 'different', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Elves', 'Anyways', 'bad', 'guys', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'mean', 'cardboard', 'evil', 'wish', 'go', 'away', 'bad', 'way', 'soldiers', 'sure', 'seem', 'lot', 'Orcs', 'Here', 'question', 'Why', 'did', 'Rachel', 'Weiz', 'lose', 'English', 'accent', 'dragon', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'her.But', 'good', 'points', 'action', 'not', 'original', 'entertaining', 'sword', 'fights', 'are', 'cool', 'battles', 'not', 'exactly', 'impressive', 'are', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'attention', 'also', 'ugly', 'fate', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'keeping', 'down', 'confusing', 'mythology', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'Elvish', 'little', 'bit.But', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'let', 'give', 'round', 'applause', 'director', 'thank', 'keeping', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'hour', 'half', 'Not', '3', 'hours', 'not', '2', 'hours', 'Just', 'nice', 'little', 'hour', '38', 'minutes', 'very', 'nice', 'running', 'time', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'cut', 'down', 'many', 'scenes', 'make', 'true', '1', 'hour', '1/2.Overall', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'brilliant', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'light', 'interested', 'whole', 'movie', 'cool', 'sequences', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'likeable', 'again', 'like', 'running', 'time', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'crazed', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'fanatics', 'much-overrated', 'book', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse.Real', 'Score', '3.5']",N/A

It was noted beforehand that I alone had no expectations.  The rest of this review is a spoiler, so proceed at your own risk.I'm sorry to report that none of us enjoyed the movie.  It was all about the animation.  The story was recycled.  The dialogue was inane.  They repeated one line at least three times, and I'm told it was never in the books...""One part brave, three parts fool.""This project had the depth and imagination of Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"", meaning not much.  My family (the Eragon fans) were intensely disappointed, outraged and offended.  They said it was like taking a novel and condensing it to a four-frame comic strip.  I wonder what the author, Christopher Paolini thought?  There is mention of elves and dwarves, but you never see them...or so I thought.  I was told afterward that the female lead character, Arya, was an elf.  The movie never revealed that.  At the end, I thought she was Minnehaha the Indian princess.Personally, I did not hate Eragon as much as the others in my family, but I would not recommend it.  I thought that as presented, this movie was a bold-faced rip-off of Star Wars; the king is a dragon-rider who turned against his brethren to gain ultimate power...there is a secret encampment of rebels, waiting for a leader to appear...that leader has no idea he is the chosen, or why...the hero's adoptive family is slain in the search for him by the evil king...the hero's mentor is slain by the evil king's more evil minion.

Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[0, 0]","Eragon is the work of a clever young writer (a boy of 15) who decided sometime before 2002 to write his book about a female Dragon. But, totally forgot about originality because he decided to make the theme of his book about Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.A 15 year old boy named Eragon (Edward Speleers,lives with his Uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong)and his cousin Roran (Chris Egan). They all live on a farm near the small village of Carvahall. Eragon, while hunting through the forest finds a blue stone--which is teleported by a witch named Angela, who is being chased by Durza (Robert Carlyle). Later on, he decides to take the stone to the village of Carvahall to sell it to a local buyer (pawn shop) but, instead he turns him down. As he leaves, he notices the village storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons) and he is very curious about the stories that he has heard about the legendary Dragon Riders from the past. Afterwards, he goes back to the farm and soon discovers that the blue stone is an egg. He witnesses the birth of a baby dragon Saphira (Rachel Weisz, the voice of the dragon) and within a short time develops a bond with this creature. But, King Galbatorix, John Malkovich(who was a former Dragon Rider but, turned rogue) learns of the hatching and dispatches the Ra'zac who are creatures that look like mummies. They are flying when suddenly Eragon notices that something has happen on his Uncle Garrow's farm but arrives to late and fines his uncle dead. Brom soon finds out and joins up with Eragon and Saphira and tells him that Eragon and Saphira are the last hope, along with the freedom fighters known as the Varden, to overthrow King Galbatorix and his evil empire. Will Young Eragon succeed?We wonder why Christopher Paolini couldn't get any one better to direct his book, and could it be the reason most of this movie was derived from the plot of Star Wars, trilogy (1977-1983).This movie is directed by first time director Stefen Fangmeier whose past film credits (which had nothing to do about directing, which obviously shows up) are visual effects work on such movies as Lemony Snicket's A series of Unfortunate Events and Master and Commander. The screen writer for this movie was Peter Buchman who is only known work has been Jurassic Park 3 (yes, you could say he's a first time writer). The biggest problem with this movie is the originality. There are many instances where his screenplay shows this; Eragon is a farm boy (Luke Skywalker), he lived with his uncle (Uncle Ben), he tries to sell the stone (that looks like a gigantic, blueberry jellybean) and this is very similar to Luke Skywalker buying R2-D2 from the Jawas. His uncle getting killed by the Ra'za this is the same as the Stormtroopers killing Luke's uncle and aunt. Brom is very much the same as Obi Wan Kenobi who was a former Jedi Knight and a protector and of the peace; much like Brom was a former Dragon Rider. When the rider and Dragon are connected together it's just like the mysterious energy that connects the Jedi Knight with the Force.Now, the acting, the visual effects, makeup, even the sound effects, and creature effects present a problem for this picture. The acting in this movie was not horrible, but presented itself as laughable, too serious (Jeremy Irons is the one to blame for this), and even emotionless because of the screenplay. Dragons are mystical and powerful creatures. We do not experience the supremacy of the dragon because of her female voice. The dragon's voice reminds us a lot of the Julia Roberts which was used in the recently released version of Charlotte's Web. How can we embrace this Dragon, if it does give us a sense of strength? The voice and the acting, simply fail.The visuals are just horrible, their special effects crew and designers took a lot of set designs from the Lord of the Rings; like the flying sequences, to the background scenery, and even to the battle sequences. One of the worse scenes in the movie is towards the end when Durza and Eragon are fighting (this is the climax of the movie), you can't see the action that is going on between the two of them because the camera is moving around to quickly for the us to appreciate the action, so this leads the audience to confusion.The make up and the costume design of our villains (King Galbatorix and Durza and the Urgals) were like a cheap representation of The Lord of the Rings. The Dragon which was probably the most important part of this film was not convincing at all, because it looked a cross between the Dragon from Never Ending Story and the remote control toy roboraptor.Lastly the sound effects were a bit overdone when Saphire flew, because she sounded like a Tie Fighter from Star Wars or even like the sound effects used in a Japanese's Godzilla/Rodan monster movie.Enter at your own risk because this movie is a complete rip off of Star Wars and every other fanasty fiction movie in the last 25 years.",1,"Eragon was derived from the plot of Star

It will be virtually impossible to replicate the product presented by Peter Jackson.However, with that said, ""Eragon"" the movie retains the spirit of the book, if not all of the details. Time compression is necessary when carrying a book to the screen (PJ did it at the beginning of FOTR). It is not a direct copy of ""Star Wars"", which borrowed heavily from LOTR in the first place. It is simply another fantasy presentation of the battle between good and evil, the corruption of power and the quest to control all peoples in a given geographical area.I especially enjoyed the performance of newcomer Edward Speleers and Jeremy Irons.

So, as you can imagine, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this movie since the news came out (a couple years before) that Eragon would be adapted for the big screen.What a disappointment!  Unlike the mini series adaptation of Earthsea, this adaptation at least has more than a marginal resemblance to the book upon which it was based.  However, the acting is poor, the scripting is poor, and even the special effects are a disappointment (and would have been even ten years ago).  The plot, though in many ways it resembles that of the book, was different enough that the story had a very different vibe and message (well, if the film had a message at all); further, there were substantial enough changes (I will not get into them for the sake of those who have not yet read the book) that there is now no chance that there could be a sequel based even remotely closely on Eldest.I could list out all my specific complaints, but I won't, because there is no point to that.  Just know that if you enjoyed the books, as I have, that you will almost certainly find this movie not just disappointing, but saddening.

The writing is uninspiring, and at times it's downright cheesy (are we together... as one.../ into the sky, to win or die).  Some of the lines were supposed to be inspiring but they usually just made me laugh.  It's a shame, too, because I see it as a story with great potential.  From what I've heard about the book, I doubt Chris Paolini intended for it to be watered down into an 80-minute extravaganza of what might could be called special effects.Eragon himself seems to be just a spoiled teenager who never uses his head.  I think the actor who played him could have done a good job if he had more to work with.I saw two somewhat redeeming points to the movie: Saphira the dragon was very good.  And Brom, played by Jeremy Irons, added a refreshing bit of good acting to this movie.I think if Eragon had relied more on good writing and acting and less on special effects and gimmicks, it could have been an excellent movie, but as it is, the movie might even be worse than Dragonheart.

1055387,A3C94LV082BV2T,B000NA28HU,"J. Davis ""Just a guy.""","[4, 5]","A couple years ago, a good friend of mine told me she was reading ""Eragon."" I had never heard of the book, so eventually I asked her what it was about. She told me it was about a young man who found a stone in the forest, except it wasn't a stone, it was a dragon egg. Interest piqued, she loaned me her copy.I read it, and it was an engaging read, though I did have some qualms about the use of magic. Altogether though, I was not too impressed. Christopher Paolini, though I'd give him high marks for an original story, was obviously inspired by ""Lord of the Rings."" An unlikely hero emerging, a powerful mentor, unexpected new friends, dwarves and elves, evil rulers, beings who were almost incarnate evil, dangerous magical devices, were all little things that reminded me of Tolkien's series. (As reviews of the book state, the editor should have done a better job.)However, with the fantasy epic movie trend, I was not surprised to hear ""Eragon"" was on the way to the big screen. I don't go to the movies often, so I passed up going to see it.When the DVD came out, however, I went ahead and bought the 2-disc edition. Not every book I've read has been made into a big movie.Having written four ""epic fantasy"" fan screenplays (the last three all part of a six-part series) and having listened to a lot about current tastes and how to write movies, I was unable to look at ""Eragon"" without judging it by certain standards.The basic storyline was kept. Sadly, a lot of character development was overlooked in favor of ""cool special effects and cool dramatic scenes!"" Maybe the screenwriter and director thought further character development would make the movie too long ""and too long is too boring,"" they likely thought. This is not always true. Peter Jackson was able to pull off a scene with Frodo and Gandalf having a powerful conversation in Moria without making it boring, and all they do is talk! Perhaps the crew would've done better to get some ideas from ""Lord of the Ring's"" writing rather than effects...One storyline that took several chapters in the book was dropped: a search for a poisonous oil, leading Eragon, Brom, and Saphira to Dras-Leona, a town under the shadow of a satanic ""church."" This was a good excision, so as not to offend the religious audiences who thrilled to ""Narnia"" and ""Rings."" But this was practically the only good thing that was dropped from the book, although it meant Brom had to die another way. (In the book, he is killed trying to leave Dras-Leona.)Because of the writer's ""let's drop the boring bits"" philosophy, Arya's poisoning, a real page-turner for me in the book, was played down to one scene. A lot of Eragon's journeys and training were also cut down to a unsatisfying and unbelievable minimum. (If Eragon really as much training as he had on screen, he would've been dead meat!) And the ""deleted scenes"" on disc 2? Yeah, the movie could've used those put back in.Saphira's development was a big disappointment: she grows to her full size in one short scene (hard to take, even in a fantasy film), while at the end of the book, she's big enough for one rider, but still growing. When she breathes fire at Farthen-Dur, Eragon looks too grim at the sight. It's her first time breathing fire: he should be surprised.One thing that ""Rings,"" ""Narnia,"" and even older fantasy classics like ""Return to Oz"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" left me with, just after the first viewing, was how memorable the music was. I could hum, whistle, or sing a bit of music from the film right off. In ""Eragon,"" I can't remember how any of the music plays. Avril Lavigine's song at the end sounded too modern for the film. The songs at the end of the ""Rings"" movies each had a specific feel for the supposed period and plot of the story, while Imogen Heap's ""I Can't Take It In"" captured the wonder of ""Narnia"" perfectly.EDIT: Upon listening to the film's score, I was disappointed again. Every track seemed to re-use the same forgettable theme! The theme was even re-used for a song that I assume is after the Avril Lavigine song during the credits, which I didn't watch all the way through.I haven't watched all the special features, but the way the second disc is set up is awful: you select different parts of the map to find special features with only the names of the locations to guide you. This would be fine had there been a guide telling me WHERE to look for the desired features. All you get is a list. (Come on, the DVDs for ""Narnia"" and ""Rings"" had printed guides with elaborate special features trees!)EDIT: Over a month later, I still haven't bothered with all of the special features.I did decide to give Paolini another shot and read ""Eldest,"" which dissappoints as a sequel to the book. Maybe such a treatment would be an improvement!I would've made this very differently, though. More time for character development, not being afraid of looking like ""Lord of the Rings,"" NOT letting special effects take over the movie, put Angela's cat back in, and so on and so forth... The Film Industry really needs me.3 out of 5 stars for weak writing, adaptation, and editing, but impressive special effects and actually telling A story.",3,"Changes from the book good/bad, trying

How can ANYONE expect the depth, plot and complexity of Lord of the Rings!?!?!?!  Even the book was panned by the critics!The photography and special effects are well above average.  The dragon is one of the best (possibly THE best) I've ever seen on film.  I loved the scene where she flew into battle wearing silver armor.  She was gorgeous and beautifully photographed.

I was hoping the movie would be better than the book; that it would have been re-molded by the screenwriter and director into a more engaging package. It wasn't.The film looks good: the costumes and armor are beautiful, and the make-up is stellar. The digital dragon works well enough not to be distracting, and the rest of the visual effects are fine. The filmmakers assembled an amazing group of actors; veterans (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich) and newer faces alike, they all turn in amazing performances. (I would love to see Eragon and Arya in a different story.) But a film is a whole, and individual great performances don't count for much when they're not well-directed in a strong screenplay.If you liked the novel, you will like the movie.

We even have a princess and a Han Solo like character who pops up later.But don't let any of that deter you.  It's a classic setup and there is plenty of originality.  The inheritance of the Dragon and the bonding of rider to beast is a very original concept and played out well in the film.  The F/X are spectacular, the scenery and landscape are unspoiled and the pace and dialogue are efficient and well directed.  Jeremy Irons gives a solid and enjoyable performance as the mentor.  John Malcovich, who is only in a few scenes, is good but he doesn't have a lot to do.

It skips a lot of character development to put the dragon in the hands of Eragon right in the very beginning of the movie. Heck it even has the dragon grow quickly and goes straight to Eragon training to be a dragon rider pretty quick. It's faithful to the book but with cutting out a lot of talking to mostly just have action. The best thing about the movie is the relationship between Eragon and the dragon. It's well done how they communicate by their minds and is faithful to the book. Jeromy Irons isn't bad either and is prety brave I must say. I mean he had the guts to do another dragon movie after Dungeons and Dragons...lol.The direction is  kind of sloppy though since everything is just quickly thrown together with no real scenes of wonder. I don't think it's fair that it got bad reviews because everyone compares every fantasy that comes out to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Not every fantasy that comes out is gonna be that good. This is still a decent fantasy with nice looking effects and cool villians. But I'd be dishonest if I didn't admit that it was kind of a mess since it's too fast paced with everything thrown together kind of sloppy. The end makes it clear that there could be more but it's kind of cheesey and doesn't even make that much sense. Plus since this one wasn't that well received we might not even get a sequel that continues after the silly ending that shows that things won't remain happlily ever after.

I have read my share of Fantasy books, and I have a fairly decent collection of Fantasy movies as well. When a book or a film comes out that is in this genre, I give it some latitude, because we are talking about a fictional world, but this was such a horrific movie.No, I did not read the novel, and I am aware of the age of the author, which I doubt would have changed anything about this film either way. This film was such a huge empty calorie. There is plenty of screen time, and very little actual substance.First of all, when you have John Malkovich in a film, you have a wonderful villain. USE HIM! He had maybe a total of 5 minutes on screen, and it was in a little throne room with the villain that chased the hero ... how trite. If that is all the character has in the book, then you wasted money on paying for J.M. to be in the film, and not use his malevolency to its maximum.Secondly, what was with the dragon? It didn't look, bear with me, REAL. I know that it is CG, but come on. It looked more like a glorified Gila monster or something. And having a female voice that wasn't ... harsh ... what is that? ""I am a celestial being from a heavenly planet?"" No, it is a dragon that couldn't scare a sheep into fear. I was drawn into the movie for that alone, and I was disappointed.Third off, the character deaths were so lame. I am your mentor, I am dead! I am your enemy, I'm dead! No I'm not! Yes I am, this time for real. Hey, I know that your friend that you just met and now completely trust for no reason is here to replace your other friend that you knew for 30 minutes, and died revealing that he was, *GASP*, a dragon rider! Say it isn't so!Side note here, I loved how there was the, ""We must walk from this point on; the horses cannot go this way,"" as they walk along the flat, wide path with those horse-killing pebbles. I still laugh when I think about this part.Lastly, there is the ending. Well, I guess it was the end. The credits started rolling. That usually signifies the end of a movie. I didn't feel that anything was ... resolved. Yes, I am aware that there is a sequel, but make me want to see it because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to, to know what happens to the characters. I honestly don't care about any of the characters. Or the supposed ""love interest"" ... ""I will see you again,"" ""I know you will"" ...

I haven't read the book, and enjoyed the movie well enough.It is pretty much exactly what I was expecting, which is a big, dumb, splashy fantasy epic in the same league as Krull or Beastmaster. To compare it to Lord of the Rings is foolish: it has nowhere near that level of complexity. A better comparison would be Dragonslayer, with Dennis Quaid. There is not an original scene or character in the movie. If you've seen any fantasy, you can predict what will happen. In fact, if you've seen the original Star Wars (episode IV, for you purists), you've seen this movie: farm kids whose parents vanished mysteriously in being raised by his uncle. He finds he has special powers, and is tutored by an older mentor after his uncle is killed by bad guys. The main bad guy also has special powers. And on and on and on. Nothing new here.That being said, if you have no expectations, this movie can be a lot of fun. John Malkovich chews the scenery, Jeremy Irons lends the movie some weight, the effects are good and the people are pretty. It moves along at a lightning pace. True, there are about a hundred plot points that are dropped, but it becomes apparent early on that the entire point of this flick is to have a sequel.

However, I suspect diehard fans of fantasy film and literature will be quite disappointed. Sadly ""Eragon"" comes across as a mediocre imitation of ""Star Wars"", with the hero, Eragon himself, as a pale fourth-rate version of Luke Skywalker (There is a scene in the film which all too readily echoes the classic image of Luke staring out from his uncle's Tatooine farm at sunset, pondering his fate.), combined with a barely credible version of sword and sorcery harkening back to Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"". While other Amazon.com customer reviewers have severely criticized the film director and screenwriters for producing a poor film adaptation of the novel, I can't help but wonder whether the fault lies too with the author, Christopher Paolini, for producing what is at best, a second-rate version of fantasy literature, borrowing too extensively from classics like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Chronicles of Narnia"". There are truly a handful of good reasons to see this film, starting with Jeremy Irons' fine portrayal of Brom, the Obi-Wan Kenobi-like figure, who becomes a mentor to young Eragon. Another fine reason is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Durza, the wicked wizard, who comes across as a more malevolent mixture of Brad Dourif's Wormtongue and Christopher Lee's Saruman from Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" cinematic trilogy (John Malkovich's evil King Galbatorix steals every scene he appears in, but alas, it's only for a few brief moments at best.). Last, but not least, I think Peter Doyle has composed a memorable film score which ranks with his earlier, classic scores for Kenneth Branagh's splendid cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare. Otherwise, unless you are a diehard fan of the fantasy novel ""Eragon"", I recommend skipping this film and renting instead Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" from your local DVD rental store.",2,"Mediocre Imitation of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings""",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,2049,"['Eragon', 'surely', 'film', 'will', 'please', 'families', 'young', 'kids', 'even', 'are', 'graphically', 'intense', 'quite', 'violent', 'scenes', 'warranted', 'film', 'PG', 'rating', 'However', 'suspect', 'diehard', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'film', 'literature', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'Sadly', 'Eragon', 'across', 'mediocre', 'imitation', 'Star', 'Wars', 'hero', 'Eragon', 'pale', 'fourth-rate', 'version', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'scene', 'film', 'too', 'readily', 'classic', 'image', 'Luke', 'staring', 'out', 'uncle', 'Tatooine', 'farm', 'sunset', 'pondering', 'fate', 'combined', 'barely', 'credible', 'version', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'harkening', 'back', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'other', 'Amazon.com', 'customer', 'reviewers', 'have', 'severely', 'criticized', 'film', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'producing', 'poor', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'fault', 'too', 'author', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'producing', 'what', 'best', 'second-rate', 'version', 'fantasy', 'literature', 'borrowing', 'too', 'extensively', 'classics', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'are', 'truly', 'handful', 'good', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'starting', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'fine', 'portrayal', 'Brom', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi-like', 'figure', 'who', 'mentor', 'young', 'Eragon', 'fine', 'reason', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'portrayal', 'Durza', 'wicked', 'wizard', 'who', 'across', 'more', 'malevolent', 'mixture', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Wormtongue', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Saruman', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'cinematic', 'trilogy', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'evil', 'King', 'Galbatorix', 'steals', 'scene', 'alas', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'best.', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'think', 'Peter', 'Doyle', 'composed', 'memorable', 'film', 'score', 'earlier', 'classic', 'scores', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'splendid', 'cinematic', 'adaptations', 'Shakespeare', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'Eragon', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'film', 'renting', 'instead', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'local', 'DVD', 'rental', 'store']",N/A

Literally every shot in here is copied and pasted from one movie or another, whether it beDragonheart - Collector's EditionorBraveheartor their two favorite sourcesThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)andStar Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc). How dare they? The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are two of my favorite films of all time and they have done a great deal to shape me into the person I am today. For anyone who has fallen in love with the works of JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson and Gorge Lucas you will be angered beyond all comprehension when you see this ""film"" rip off those great men's work. I'm telling you, EVERY SINGLE SCENE in this movie is copied and pasted from other, much better works.But apart from the obvious rip off factor, the movie manages to fail all on its own as well. The obvious flaws are there for anyone with any amount of sense to see and are too blatant to ignore. It literally takes one day for our hero to change from an everyday farm boy (Luke Skywalker) who doesn't even know how to hunt to superman who's now all of a sudden breaking into the evil castle (the Death Star) and saving the damsel in distress, (Princess Lea) using his magic (the force) and being saved by his wise old mentor (Obi One Kenobi) who then dies heroically. It literally takes him two days toA) Learn how to fly a dragon,B) Learn how to use a sword,C) Learn to use magic,D) Learn how to sneak stealthy into heavily guarded castles, and much, much more. Wow, what is he smoking and where can I get some?Shortly after escaping the previously mentioned castle, he then leads an army of men who look like Easterlings from LOTR against an army of bad guys who look like Orcs in a fort that looks like Helms Deep while wearing Elvin armor. The bad guy leading said orcs also looks like Dracula fromVan Helsing (Widescreen Edition)and they engage in a battle with an odd resemblance to Dragon Heart. Of course, they win and the beautiful girl he saved, the one he has YET to have a full conversation with despite being with her for about half the movie, runs off to plan to defend her home nation against the evil king who will be attacking in the inevitable sequel (a movie I will make it a point not to see whenever it DOES come out).In short, the plot moves too fast, the characters are bland and one dimensional, the acting is sub par at best, the effects looked like they were done on a ten dollar budget, and it blatantly rips off some of the greatest works of fiction ever made. There is absolutely nothing original about this film, everything here is merely copied and pasted from much better works. Eragon so desperately wants to be The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, and Bravheart, and Dragon Heart, and Van Helsing, and this, and that, but in the end it fails to be anything but a silly kid's movie so shallow that only the blindest movie goers will manage to get anything out of it.

1055402,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000NA28HU,Jonathan Appleseed,"[41, 70]","In order to trim the film to two and a half hours, much is left out. My guess is that they trimmed what would have added an hour to the running time because what they trimmed was so much worse than what they kept.It's no surprise that Eragon feels like ""The Lord of the Rings Lite"", or ""Star Wars Impaired"", because that's what the book was. The screenwriters made no attempts, and neither did the director, to put a stamp of originality on this. That may be because they couldn't without drastically changing the events of the story. Like leaving Eragon's uncle out of the story, or Brom, or...well, perhaps even Eragon himself. (By the way, did anyone else expect to see a light saber every time Eragon flashed his sword around? I did.)There's a certain amount of guilt that I feel for being so critical of a story written by such a young writer. But when he is asked, ""What race from your books would you choose to be?"", and he answers, ""A dwarf, because their language and culture is so fascinating"", it soothes that guilt. He honestly believes that the dwarves have a complete language and culture. Perhaps in his mind they do, and perhaps in the minds of so many teenagers who have never read *good* fantasy they do, but for anyone who has read *good* fantasy (LOTR, for example) this rings hollow. No writer (artist) who steals so openly from others and who had half a brain or a teaspoon of common sense would say things like that. And yes, there have been many other comments made by him, similarly narcissistic.The acting wasn't half bad, but the dialogue (something that Paolini says is essential to make realistic) is horrid. It's also pulled nearly word by word from the text. I think that people seeing this film will have a better grasp of the weaknesses of the book, as visuals are often more striking than the written word.How did so many good actors get caught up into this?? My only guess is that they never read the book, never read the criticism, and thought they were going to ""Ian McKellan-ize"" themselves. Well...that didn't work.I almost gave this movie two stars because of the special effects, but the special effects nearly mirrored those of The Lord of the Rings movies. The one aspect where they could have been original (this also includes the physical appearance of the various races), and they chose not to. I cannot imagine why. The director had to know that he was dealing with a thief (even if Paolini won't acknowledge this), and he could have done so much to make this original. Again, I can't imagine why he didn't. Even with the thievery of the book's plot and characters, an original film could have been made.

1055403,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000NA28HU,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[6, 6]","The genre of fantasy has always been a shaky area as far as cinema is concerned.  While there were have been some truly magical (or at least entertaining) efforts such as WILLOW, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, THE DARK CRYSTAL, and THE PRINCESS BRIDE (I apologize if I forgot to mention anything else), audiences have been mostly treated to trashy dreck such as THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, DEATHSTALKER, and the DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie.  It wasn't until recently with the phenomenally successful theatrical releases of HARRY POTTER, the LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA that fantasy in cinema really seemed to find its peak.  Now it seems as though other studios are trying to get on the fantasy wave.This is certainly true of the newly released ERAGON, which, as with HP, LOTR, and CoN, is based on a popular (although not necessarily legendary) book trilogy called ""Inheritence"".  Interestingly, the story was penned by a seventeen-year-old named Christopher Paolini, and this movie is based on the first book of his series.  Unfortunately, audiences expecting the movie of ERAGON to be in the same caliber as HARRY POTTER, LOTR, or NARNIA, are bound to be disappointed, for, while the movie shows potential in many areas, it does not come anywhere near close to excellence.Not having read the books at all, I cannot remark on what changes have been made from the source material, so I won't make any comments about that.  It has been declared, however, that the story--in which a young farm boy discovers a magical stone which turns out to be a dragon's egg, and, with the aid of an old sage and his talking dragon, aspires to overthrow a medieval tyrant and his court wizard--is a rip-off of STAR WARS and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  Yet one can make the same argument about fantasy tales in general--as a huge fan of the genre I recognize that no tale is totally, 100-percent original (I could go on with comparisons on how the aforementioned HP, LOTR, and CoN all share similarities, but that's irrelevant); what ultimately matters is whether the end result is good or bad.For the most part, newcomer director Stefan Fangmeier handles the all-too familiar material fairly well.  The movie is highlighted by beautiful cinematography, and there are many breathtaking panoramic helicopter shots and intricate production design sets that bring a fun, but underdeveloped fantasy world to life.  Patrick Doyle's impressively grand music is also a plus--very epic in style and scope.  As one might expect from a fantasy movie, ERAGON is loaded with special effects, and the majority of them are spectacular.  Particularly noteworthy is the hero's dragon companion, an impressive beast named Saphira.  As with DRAGONHEART, this purple-scaled giant--fully realized by computer-generated-imagery and a gentle, edgy voice supplied by Rachel Weisz--is the central attraction of the movie.Not that there aren't any good performances from the human cast in ERAGON.  Jeremy Irons (who unfortunately portrayed an oh-so-over-the-top villain in the ill-fated DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie) is excellent as the old sagely figure, Brom, (a sort of Obi-Wan Kenobi type character) bringing both a dramatic presence and credibility to a role that would otherwise come across as cardboard cut-out.  (And for those of you who dreaded him in DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, he doesn't overact here.)  Just as good is Robert Carlyle as the evil wizard, Durza, a dead-on impersonation of Brad Dourif's Wormtongue in LORD OF THE RINGS.The film moves along at a breezy pace and is never boring--except this also proves to be one of ERAGON'S major faults.  Through the movie's 98 minutes, the tangled plot comes across as very rushed; characters like a princess and a Han Solo-like rogue figure jump out of nowhere, and, as such, come across as superfluous and uninteresting.  An extra thirty minutes worth of character building wouldn't have hurt.  I also felt that Saphira's growth from a cuddlesome baby to a magnificent beast happened too quickly, even for a fantasy story.My other quibbles:  newcomer Edward Speleers as young hero Eragon sticks out like a sore thumb.  When he's thrust into action sequences, Speleers is decent, but for the majority of the movie he comes across as flat and emotionless (although not as much as, say, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker in STAR WARS EPISODE II).  Furthermore, John Malkovich as the real bad guy only shows up for scanty scenes, and consequently, his character never develops into anything.  Because of this, I was unable to evaluate his acting to get enough of an opinion about his overall performance.As mentioned, it is probably unrealistic to expect every fantasy story to be totally original, and the occasional nods to STAR WARS (the hero's uncle is killed by an enemy attack, and later Brom meets a similar fate) and LORD OF THE RINGS (Durza looking down at an army of stripped-down orc imitations) don't really pose much problem.  But the script doesn't do much to make the entire adventure fully satisfying for a more demanding audience. These flaws bring ERAGON down from its potential as a worthy new franchise and turn it into a fun but uninspired and too rapidly paced action flick.In short, ERAGON is passable although not stellar--certainly more watchable than most sword-swinging dreck, but weaker than its more superior counterparts.  The movie promotes itself as the beginning of a trilogy, and it ends with the promise of a sequel to come.  I look forward to the next movie, but I also hope it will be something better.  If ERAGON or its future installments hope to achieve its promise, it needs to improve on its failings.  That would make this tale more than just ""watchable.""",3,Well-intentioned but flawed attempt to make another fantasy franchise.,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,5719,"['genre', 'fantasy', 'always',

It isn't meant to; it is meant to bring to the screen the basic story. You can't watch a dragon grow up in an hour and a half, so you have to be creative about getting a baby dragon into adulthood quickly. There is never enough time to fit everything that is in the book into a movie, so you get the highlights to tell the story on the screen. I felt this movie was quite fun and enjoyable to watch. Ed Speleers is off to a great start as a fresh young actor (who, by the way, won this role by beating 180,000 competitors).  I was quite impressed by his performance, considering the fact that this is his first movie. I was equally empressed by Saphira. I don't see how anyone can complain about the special effects in this film.  That dragon looked real, from babyhood to adulthood! I don't for a moment feel that this movie was trying to imitate Lord of the Rings or any other movie, for that matter.  I am a GREAT Lord of the Rings fan, and tend to be critical of imitations.

1055408,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B000NA28HU,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","""Eragon"" is the film based off of the book of the same name written by Christopher Paolini. If you've read the book, then it's hard to believe that you are following the same story. It seems like they quickly scanned the book, took the major characters, and then re-wrote the entire thing. No film adaption of a fantasy novel has ever been perfect, or even contained every detail that was present in the book, but it felt as if they disregarded the book entirely when they wrote the script.They added dialogue that wasn't present in the books, as well as added scenes that weren't in the story, and went as far as changing an entire scene altogether. The best example would be the final fight scene with Eragon and Durza. Nothing about that scene is even remotely close to how the battle was portrayed in the book. When the film originally came out I didn't notice any of this because 1) I was young and 2) I kind of rushed through the book. However, I recently re-watched the film and it gave me the desire to re-read the entire series. Well I just finished book 1 and it left me speechless as to how different the story was in comparison.As I said they did change major things, but it wasn't just that. They changed minor things as well. How Saphira's name was chosen, how Brom died, their time in the Varden, the list goes on. They left out the relationship that was built with Brom and Eragon, as well as the relationship that was built with Murtagh, they ddin't mention Jeod or Solembum, Angela was only present in one scene and I wasn't happy with how they portrayed her at all, but I don't want to bore you with a big list.As a standalone film it is easy to find things that you can like about it. As a film based off of a novel? Not so much. If you want to give the film a try and haven't read the books, then I encourage you to do so, but rent it first. If you have read the book then I would suggest you skip this.

However, this movie truly should have been a lot better.  They really missed an opportunity here to start a nice franchise.  It's not Lord of the Rings and there really is no reason it needs to be so I don't really understand all the comparisons.Storyline: The overall plot, I thought, was pretty sound.  But the tone was a little too childish.  I felt like it was even pandering to young kids.  They didn't gap the bridge too well between making a movie for kids as well as adults.  It felt a little lost here.Direction:  It was clear that the director is a special FX guru.  Maybe he shouldn't direct films after all.  It's bad when a movie like this wreaks of misguided direction.  If I can tell it's bad direction, that's not good.Editing:  I kept thinking the editing was all off.  There were times when a scene would end and I couldn't tell what the heck the filmmakers were trying to say or even what was going on.Special FX: I thought they did a truly wonderful job with the effects on Saphira the dragon.  Loved it.  They really nailed it.Cast:  Thank gawd for Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz.  Robert Carlyle was great too!  John Malkovich I think is very miscast here.  I felt like he was phoning in his performance.  The performance he gave here can be seen in other films.  I swear I was watching his same character from ""In the Line of Fire.""Set design/costumes:  Ah..this could have been better too.  It didn't look or feel cohesive.  It felt a little patched together and a little cheesy.Length of film:  Waaaaaaay too short and no wonder it felt like story lines and plot pieces were missing.I feel sorry for the film makers involved on this project.  So much work and such an oddly paced film.  I felt like they concentrated a lot of their dollars on the FX for Saphira (which I admit is wonderful) but sacrficied a little too much elsewhere.The only reason I give this 3 stars is because I thought the special dragon FX were spot on.  This really could have been a great film from such a well loved book.  Despite my own general poor review, I hope someone makes a 2nd film because I think they can salvage something.

Even though Eragon the movie differs in many ways from Eragon the book, I still enjoy the movie for what it is and don't feel that it deserves the hate that it gets.  Hollywood rarely does a book justice, even when the director has its best intentions in mind.  Lord Of The Rings is one of the few that I feel did the books justice and even then, Jackson left things out of the movie.  I think the director of Eragon could've done more if he'd had more time (with a longer movie) and control.  I would've liked to see all 4 books represented with movies, but Hollywood made that impossible.  Like The Golden Compass, the detractors made it so that the people who would've liked the story be told in its entirety will be left forever longing.

So this is not one of my more skilled synopses but this movie is not really hard to sum up.Ok I didn't hear of Eragon until I saw the preview for this film. I never heard of the book or anything. I have no idea why I pay any attention to trailers cause most of the time they seriously make the good films look bad and the bad films look good. Eragon looked like a decent film and I expected a lot of it. This is one weird movie because it had everything it needed to be great. It had the what I'm told a great book to go by so the story was a piece of cake. It had the money so the cinematography was no problem and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. And it also had actors, so where could this movie mess up? Well for one the script to me had no heart, no feeling. You can tell when it's the actors or the writing and I'm sure it was the writing. I mean Jeremy Irons is no amateur at these types of films. Rachel Weisz was a nice fit playing the voice of Saphira and did a great job. She was the only one that had a couple of good scenes where you could feel her and she was a computer-generated dragon.The battles were awful and the sound quality of the battle made it worst. I've heard more sword clashing on an episode of Rachel Ray's cooking show. Some say the film was slow but to me it went too fast and just organized badly altogether. There was no suspense building up to the final battle either. If anything good came out of Eragon it was the cinematography and the base of the story itself was interesting. If there is a sequel which I'm sure there will be because this movie did well at the box office I would be tempted to see it hoping someone reads all the bad reviews and fixes the mistakes. To be honest this story has a lot to work with and the next film can be saved. I'd say save Eragon for your child or young niece or nephew who will just be fascinated by the dragon but leave some room for hope that the second will be better.",2,"No Depth, It Basically Had No Heart",1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2443,"['Eragon', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'author', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'film', 'young', 'teen', 'farmer', 'who', 'land', 'controlled', 'evil', 'king', 'named', 'Galbatorix', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'story', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'men', 'dragons', 'fought', 'together', 'Galbatorix', 'betrayed', 'people', 'killed', 'dragons', 'most', 'riders', 'Now', 'unborn', 'dragon', 'named', 'Saphira', 'hands', 'young', 'Eragon', 'two', 'are', 'destined', 'other', 'take', 'out', 'Galbatorix', 'not', 'one', 'more', 'skilled', 'synopses', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'hard', 'sum', 'up.Ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Eragon', 'saw', 'preview', 'film', 'never', 'heard', 'book', 'anything', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'pay', 'attention', 'trailers', 'cause', 'most', 'time', 'seriously', 'make', 'good', 'films', 'look', 'bad', 'bad', 'films', 'look', 'good', 'Eragon', 'looked', 'decent', 'film', 'expected', 'lot', 'one', 'weird', 'movie', 'had', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'great', 'had', 'what', ""'m"", 'told', 'great', 'book', 'go', 'so', 'story', 'was', 'piece', 'cake', 'had', 'money', 'cinematography', 'was', 'problem', 'CGI', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'also', 'had', 'actors', 'where', 'could', 'movie', 'mess', 'up', 'Well', 'one', 'script', 'had', 'heart', 'feeling', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'actors', 'writing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'writing', 'mean', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'amateur', 'types', 'films', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'was', 'nice', 'fit', 'playing', 'voice', 'Saphira', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'had', 'couple', 'good', 'scenes', 'where', 'could', 'feel', 'was', 'computer-generated', 'dragon.The', 'battles', 'were', 'awful', 'sound', 'quality', 'battle', 'made', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'more', 'sword', 'clashing', 'episode', 'Rachel', 'Ray', 'cooking', 'show', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'went', 'too', 'fast', 'just', 'organized', 'badly', 'altogether', 'was', 'suspense', 'building', 'up', 'final', 'battle', 'either', 'anything', 'good', 'came', 'Eragon', 'was', 'cinematography', 'base', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'be', 'tempted', 'see', 'hoping', 'someone', 'bad', 'reviews', 'fixes', 'mistakes', 'be', 'honest', 'story', 'lot', 'work', 'next', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'saved', ""'d"", 'say', 'save', 'Eragon', 'child', 'young', 'niece', 'nephew', 'who', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'fascinated', 'dragon', 'leave', 'room', 'hope', 'second', 'will', 'be', 'better']",N/A

It is the tale of a boy who finds a dragon egg. When the egg hatches he finds a wonderful friend in Saphira. The kingdom is ruled by a tyrannical dragon rider. The king murdered all the known dragons and riders so that he could not be challenged. When he learns that a new dragon and rider have appeared he sends his evil sorcerer to kill them, but Eragon and Saphira make it to a fortress controlled by the only remaining people who dare to fight for their freedom. A terrible battle soon begins.This movie is very good. It has good actors, special effects, soundtrack, and a well done screenplay. I think that the weakest part of this movie is the ending. The ending pretty much states that there will be a sequel, without just flat out saying it verbally. At the time I'm writing this review the film is almost 7 years old. That's a long time to leave fans hanging. I know that there are several books that go beyond the material in the movie. I hope they actually make another Eragon movie. I'm sorry I rambled.

1055419,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000NA28HU,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[13, 19]","Ever since 2001 fantasy films have been huge for movie theater business. That was the year that produced both ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" as well as ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and managed to make almost two billion dollars combined. Since ""The Lord of the Rings"" films are finished and the Harry Potter films on their way, new properties need to be looked at to keep the genre alive. It's easy to see why ""Eragon"" was green-lit: Some executive at Fox saw that this book about dragons written by a 15 year old was selling tons of copies, and decided to buy himself a new franchise. If Fox isn't careful though, ""Eragon"" could easily destroy the fantasy genre once again. Having read the book and enjoyed it despite some obvious similarities to Star Wars, I walked into ""Eragon"" expecting a fun little fantasy romp. Man, leave it to Hollywood to destroy the things you love. Heck, leave it to Hollywood to destroy things you even enjoy on a very simplistic level.I never for a minute believed ""Eragon"" was the next classic in the making, just a fantasy book for kids that I happened to really enjoy. After watching the film I wondered whether or not I was crazy for even getting into the books in the first place. ""Eragon"" revolves around a young farmer named Eragon (but not Luke Skywalker), who lives with his Uncle and half brother (but no Aunt), and dreams of leaving the farm when he gets older (but not too much older). Then one day Eragon finds a dragon egg while hunting, and when it hatches into the worlds last dragon Eragon finds he is in possession of something that could change the fate of the world (but this item isn't an evil ring that makes people go all woo-ho). Shortly after Eragon names the dragon Saphira, an old man named Brom (but not Obi-Wan Kenobi) shows up to explain that Eragon is the last Dragon Rider in the world.Dragon Riders (which in no way should be confused with Jedi's) used to be the best magic warriors in the land, until the evil emperor Galbatorix (but not Darth Vader) destroyed them all. With Eragon though, the Dragon Riders have a chance to rise again, and destroy the empire. All Eragon has to do is follow Brom and join the rebel freedom fighters the Varden (but not the Rebel Alliance). Along the way Eragon and Brom meet up with Ayra the elf (but not Princess Leia), the evil killers known as Ra'zac (but not Black Riders), and a rouge named Murtagh (but not Aragon...oh, wait, Eragon's supposed to be Aragon. Darn, now I'm getting this crap confused). Throw in some okay special effects (AKA: Money!) and you have the ""Eragon,"" which was once a charming children's book that now looks all corporate due to big wigs interfering. ""Eragon,"" which was directed by a first time director, feels amateurish and cheap. The acting in this movie, save for Jeremy Irons as Brom, is simply awful.Edward Speleers, who was hand picked to play Eragon himself, is so bloody terrible I wanted to slap the kid. Why must this guy say something stupid at every. Single. Important scene? Do we need this character to say ""The empire sounds really evil"" and ""We, shall, PREVAIL!!!"" Oh, and while Eragon himself didn't say this, hands down the worst line is ""Some friends can't be replaced...thankfully, some friends don't have to be."" I swear, I shot soda out of my nine inches from a gag reflex (and the fact that I wasn't even drinking soda made this situation even more unpleasant). The action sequences are okay, but not spectacular. One of the characters disappears in a haze of smoke, other characters run and scream while getting barbequed by the dragon, and the evil emperor constantly complains that his minions can't do anything right. This is why neo-terrorism was never a huge threat in the old days: No body has a clue on what makes a good killer.They run, they scream, they do everything but kill anyone (one characters death is an accident). All of this leads up to a shocking epic village battle, where the climax features Eragon flying on his dragon and sword fighting with a wizard who has conjured his own fake dragon out of black powder. That was a great scene, though it's frustrating because it hints that this movie could have been much better then it ended up being. It's not even the epic things that is a problem with this movie, it's the minor things. A suit of armor is made for Saphira, but the armor she ends up wearing is completely different. Ayra is an elf, but do to a lack of pointy ears you would have no clue of this unless someone told you. The ending is extremely abrupt, with a scene that has been in neither of the two books, which leads me to believe this twist was either a sneak preview to book three or a big guess on the film makers part.It's a common thing to see a movie where the film makers obviously had no faith in their source material, it's just strange to see them having no faith in a sure bet. They have the rights to film a trilogy for one of the most popular children's books in the last five years, I think they can breath a sigh of relief and not worry so much to the point where they feel they have to change everything. I also admit to being disappointing the CGI, as the dragon looks overly cartoony and almost never interacts with the live actors or the ho-hum sets. The final irony in all this was to watch the ending credits with a love ballad sung by Avril Lavigne, which I suppose is supposed to be the cherry on top of this Ice Cream Sunday. Like the rest of the movie it's extremely corny, and since there is no romance in the movie at all I wonder what it's doing here (Eragon and Arya's relationship won't develope until movie two). ""Eragon"" was a huge, huge misfire. My anticipation for the ""Eldest"" movie has dropped dramatically.Rating: * and a half stars",1,An Epic Dragon In A Small Scale Film,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,5797,"['Ever', '2001', 'fantasy',

1055420,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000NA28HU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","Reading over a few of the reviews of this film I noticed one major difference between those who enjoyed the movie and those who, well, hated it.  Folks who read the book this film is based on generally seemed to regard this film as an atrocity.  Those people who didn't read the book (such as myself) either really enjoyed the movie or thought it was a mediocre film at best.  I happened to really enjoy the film.  It isn't the greatest fantasy flick to ever grace the silver screen but, then again, most fantasy flicks aren't out to be the greatest.  The bulk of them simply tell a generic story of a ""chosen"" one who sets out to fulfill their destiny or sacrifice their livelihood for the good of others.  To say that the film is cliche is cliche in and of itself.  Even those films and books considered to be some of the best fantasies involve a singular hero (Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, etc.) who, with a small band of friends, faces off against terrible odds and somehow manages to succeed.  Lesser fantasy films like ""Krull,"" ""Willow,"" ""Dragonslayer,"" and others all reflect the exact same story as do the great ones.""Eragon"" falls into this ""lesser"" fantasy category.  It's a very fun, fast-paced film that tells the story of a young boy who becomes the ""last dragonrider.""  He's expected to lead the war against the wicked King Galbatorix and his legion of evil.  Along the way he develops friendships with shady characters and honorable fellows.  It's a stock fantasy to say the least, but it's still fun to watch it unfold.I agree with others that say there are plenty of underdeveloped characters.  I also see where many would say that the film is too rushed.  However, with that said, I still found this film to be palatable.  The special effects are well done.  The dragon, Sephira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), is wonderful to look at.  The actors do a fine job with what they're given to work with although some, especially John Malkovich, lack sufficient screentime to really get a grasp on them.  The music fits the fantasy setting very well.  There's nothing that's overly terrible about the movie as a whole in my opinion.So, if you enjoy fantasy films along the same lines as ""Krull"" and ""Willow,"" ""Eragon"" should be right up your alley.  If you've read and enjoyed the book, I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy this movie based on the opinion of others reviewing this film.

The dragon movies of any time are often boring and tedious.  One can tell a movie such as this was based upon a book written by an 18 year old.It's funny how the author has stated he wrote the book because he had read a bunch of fantasy novels and wanted to write one for himself.  So what did he do?  As this film shows: he just took a bit of EVERYTHING and combined them.But, back to the film:The story involves a young boy who is sent a blue dragon egg which he cares for until it hatches.  He then learns he's destined to become a ""Dragon Rider"" based upon some mumbo jumbo legend only Jeremy Irons is privy to.So he communicates via telepathy with the horredously blatant CGI dragon which shares the screen with him.  All the while, Jeremy Irons leads him into danger and either whispers or yells each and every line he's given.Meanwhile, John Malkovich apparantely portrays a powerful king who rules the entirle land and desperately wants that dragon dead.  So he enuciates as much as possible, then sends a half albino/half vampire version of Robery Carlyle to defeat Eragon (our hero boy) with magic.And so, a legend is 'born' or something and adventure ensues.  If I sound bitter, it's mostly because I attempted three times to sit through this movie.  I should have taken a hint from my oldest daughter (who adored the book) when she said she fell asleep during the film and never bothered watching it again.So, in essence, the film is vastly improved with Rifftrax.",1,Era-yawn,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1578,"['Honestly', 'movie', 'horrible', 'Normally', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'whole', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'films', 'dragon', 'movies', 'time', 'are', 'often', 'boring', 'tedious', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'such', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'written', '18', 'year', 'old.It', 'funny', 'how', 'author', 'stated', 'wrote', 'book', 'had', 'read', 'bunch', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'wanted', 'write', 'one', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'film', 'just', 'took', 'bit', 'EVERYTHING', 'combined', 'them.But', 'back', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'sent', 'blue', 'dragon', 'egg', 'then', 'destined', 'become', 'Dragon', 'Rider', 'based', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'legend', 'only', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'privy', 'to.So', 'telepathy', 'horredously', 'blatant', 'CGI', 'dragon', 'shares', 'screen', 'while', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'danger', 'whispers', 'yells', 'line', 'given.Meanwhile', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'apparantely', 'powerful', 'king', 'who', 'rules', 'entirle', 'land', 'desperately', 'dragon', 'dead', 'So', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'then', 'half', 'albino/half', 'vampire', 'version', 'Robery', 'Carlyle', 'defeat', 'Eragon', 'hero', 'boy', 'magic.And', 'so', 'legend', ""'born"", 'something', 'adventure', 'ensues', 'sound', 'bitter', 'mostly', 'attempted', 'three', 'times', 'sit', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'hint', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'adored', 'book', 'when', 'said', 'fell', 'asleep', 'film', 'never', 'bothered', 'watching', 'again.So', 'essence', 'film', 'vastly', 'improved', 'Rifftrax']",N/A

The proud, independent and STRONG villagers of Carvahall were turned into dirty, cringing peasants not deserving a moments notice. Galbatorix, who in the book is only mentioned in conversations, makes frequent appearances in the movie for no other reason than to direct Durza to ""go get them, NOW."" Just a pointless waste of time when good parts of the book were slashed to make it fit to movie length. Arya is no longer a strong, vibrant character. Angela the healer is a pretty young woman instead of an old woman. Solembum the werecat does not exist. Murtagh is barely a character in the movie. The relationship between Brom and Eragon is not developed well so that you don't even care when Brom dies. Farthen Dur does not exist, the Varden live outdoors in the mountains. So, so much chopped and changed. Some of the special effects are pretty good but others are disappointing. The dragon in 1996's Dragonheart was nearly as well rendered. BTW ...Urgals?

1055429,A26KIF01GEUXBT,B000NA28HU,Kyle Pratt,"[3, 3]","Fifteen year old Christopher Paolini wrote the bestselling novel and adults, who should forever remain nameless, destroyed the movie.  Children and those who have not read the book may enjoy this movie, but having read the book, I know that it pales beside the novel.Paolini's youth can be seen in his writing, his plot is at times clich&eacute;d and often formulaic.  However, having said that, I enjoyed the novel.  Unfortunately I can not  say the same for the movie.  In the novel, Paolini creates a detailed back-story, geography and laws that rule his imaginary world.  (Yes, some of these laws are borrowed from other authors.)  The characters of this world, in comparison to the movie are much fuller and more developed.It is very difficult to take a 750 page novel and adapt it into a 103 minute movie but this movie leaves the essence of novel on the cutting room floor.  People enjoy books and movies if they care about the characters.  While I did care about Eragon in the movie, I cared much less about Brom and Murtagh and their relationship with Eragon is vital to the story.  Other changes that were made were merely annoying.  Arya is an Elf in the novel and that is important to the story.  What is she in the movie?  The military draft subplot is entirely an invention for the movie and is completely unnecessary.  I could go on but I have made my point.Eragon is not fantasy in the class of The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but I asked myself, would I have enjoyed this book if I had known nothing about the author?  My answer is yes.  For me his youth only adds to the enjoyment I receive from his work.  To have created a fine story while only a teenager makes me wonder what he will achieve in twenty years.Christopher Paolini is a fine young author and I look forward to Eldest and all his future stories.  Sadly these later books will probably never be made into movies because of the hack job done on Eragon.Recommendation: Read the book,Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1), skip the movie.Kyle Pratt",2,Don't Judge the Book by this Movie,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2048,"['Fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'wrote', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'adults', 'who', 'should', 'forever', 'remain', 'nameless', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'Children', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'novel.Paolini', 'youth', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'writing', 'plot', 'times', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'often', 'formulaic', 'However', 'having', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'novel', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'movie', 'novel', 'Paolini', 'detailed', 'back-story', 'geography', 'laws', 'rule', 'imaginary', 'world', 'Yes', 'laws', 'are', 'borrowed', 'other', 'authors', 'characters', 'world', 'comparison', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'fuller', 'more', 'developed.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'take', '750', 'page', 'novel', 'adapt', '103', 'minute', 'movie', 'movie', 'essence', 'novel', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'People', 'enjoy', 'books', 'movies', 'care', 'characters', 'did', 'care', 'Eragon', 'movie', 'cared', 'much', 'less', 'Brom', 'Murtagh', 'relationship', 'Eragon', 'vital', 'story', 'Other', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'were', 'merely', 'annoying', 'Arya', 'Elf', 'novel', 'important', 'story', 'What', 'movie', 'military', 'draft', 'subplot', 'entirely', 'invention', 'movie', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'go', 'have', 'made', 'point.Eragon', 'not', 'fantasy', 'class', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'asked', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'had', 'known', 'nothing', 'author', 'answer', 'yes', 'youth', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'receive', 'work', 'have', 'created', 'fine', 'story', 'only', 'teenager', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'achieve', 'twenty', 'years.Christopher', 'Paolini', 'fine', 'young', 'author', 'look', 'forward', 'Eldest', 'future', 'stories', 'Sadly', 'later', 'books', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'movies', 'hack', 'job', 'done', 'Eragon.Recommendation', 'Read', 'book', 'Eragon', 'Inheritance', 'Book', '1', 'skip', 'movie.Kyle', 'Pratt']",N/A

Being a fantasy genre, *Eragon* should have been directed by those who made LOTR and Harry Potter and the like.  I mean, hey, let's admit it, we're nerds!  However, seeing that *Eragon* was rated PG, then you should know that this was made with only kids in mind.  Not that this is an excuse for leaving out...what...80 or 90% of the story.But, to be fair, *Eragon* was somewhat an enjoyable movie...even though I knew what was missing.  It would have been nice to see more bonding between Saphira and Eragon.  Perhaps a montage would have helped or something like that.  It would have been nice to see Eragon bonding with Brom and learning ancient words of the Elves.I had a different image in my mind when I read the book.  For example, elves should look like elves...you know, pointed ears.  In the movie, you'd have no idea that there were Elves in the movie.  Scrying is a whole lot different in the movie.  To me, Eragon and Arya  just happened to connect on the same dream ""wavelength"".  And lastly, it would have been nice to show the Varden as more elaborate and breathtaking.Ah well, *Eragon* was made the way it was made.  Of course, I'm not satisfied with it.

1055431,A383PPSVXNB0NB,B000NA28HU,Leigh Fitzpatrick,"[3, 4]","Well it's no surprise that the movie seeks to be like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films because the book is notorious for it's ""borrowing"" of themes and specifics from other authors' work, particularly Tolkien, LeGuin, and McCaffrey.  And just like the book, the movie quickly introduces ideas and then just as quickly abandons them.  Still, you can always turn lemons into lemonade and this could have been a reasonably good move....but it isn't.  So many things are so obvious to advance the plot that my jaw kept hitting the ground (EX: The dragon takes off in flight as a youngster and returns as a fully grown beast; The Irons character talks about how names of things relate to magic (LeGuin) and how difficult it is to master yet the young Eragon immediately and with no difficulty becomes a powerful wizard and warrior).There is none of the struggle here that made Sam and Frodo so compelling. Eragon is like a kid who hit the Lotto who then skates along serenely while the film maker (and the author of the source material) handle the tough stuff for him.Much of the film (especially the final battle sequence) is filmed darkly and is hard to see and the writing and acting is horrible.

1055433,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000NA28HU,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[6, 7]","There's two ways to look at a movie based on a book. One is to hope it really does justice to the fine writing in the book, and brings that vision to life. The other is to completely ignore the book and hope that the movie simply is a great movie, loosely based on a book text.To review Eragon fairly, my boyfriend and I took two different points of view. I read the book first, so I would judge the movie against the book. He did NOT read the book first, so he could watch the movie without any bias.We both thought the movie did a VERY poor job.Let's look at why. Interestingly, the things he laughed at, I laughed at as well. Probably the most key issue was the development of Saphira, the dragon. In the book, Ergaon builds a meaningful relationship with her over time. He learns about her, she learns about him, they grow to care for each other. There are subtle interplays with Saphira's jealousy and love for him. Out of all of the book's substance, this is probably the best done, and the key for the story.To me, the ""five second explosion"" where Saphira morphs from a gremlin-like baby dragon into a full grown dragon was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. It killed much of the meaning of the story. Interestingly, Bob (my boyfriend) found this morph equally ridiculous. Even without having read the book, he could clearly see that this was wrong.So many of the movie's scenes and dialogue are stolen from other movies that it was hard to count them all. The one in particular that had us both rolling on the ground with laughter was when Luke Skywalker (oh sorry, I mean Eragon) was wistfully looking off into the sunset as the music swelled. We kept looking for that second sun of Tattoine. Could you have been more obvious there?There were sections of dialogue where I literally could recite the words along with the characters, even though they weren't in the book. The things they said were THAT predictable.With really well written books, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the set designers would keep copies of the book on set, referring to them page by page to ensure they had the details exactly right. JK Rowlings was called in frequently when the first Harry Potter book was made into a movie, to ensure that the costumes and environments were perfect.In comparison, you have to wonder if the movie makers here even read the book. The things they ""got wrong"" are staggering. Yes, you could say that the book was very flawed to begin with and that they were trying to ""fix"" it. But if that were the case, they would have improved on the book. Instead, even the important parts of the book are lost completely - and the thievery involved in the movie is almost even more blatant than what the book held.I'm not saying that the book was without flaws. For example, one serious issue for me was that the only real female character - the elf, Arya - was comatose for 99% of the book. In the movie, Arya is much more talkative. You could say they ""changed the book here"" - but to me it was like enhancing Arwen and Eowyn's part in the Lord of the Rings movies. The book had a flaw, and they fixed it. To me that's a healthy change. Of course, they somehow turned Arya from an elf into a human, but that was minor compared to other issues.In general, the damage the movie plot wrought was far more severe. They destroyed Eragon's relationship with Saphira. They destroyed much of the meaning of Brom's mentorship, and of Murtagh's friendship. The variety of villager issues between Eragon and various people was simplified to ""everyone is scared of the Evil Empire"".In the end, my boyfriend, who watched the movie ""without prejudice"" (i.e. no book knowledge) felt VERY disappointed by what it offered as a story. I, who HAD read the book first, felt equally disappointed with how it interpreted the book. Most movies at least either please the book readers or please movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.",2,Skips Important Book Meanings Plus Steals from Other Movies,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,3959,"['two', 'ways', 'look', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'One', 'hope', 'really', 'justice', 'fine', 'writing', 'book', 'vision', 'life', 'other', 'completely', 'ignore', 'book', 'hope', 'movie', 'simply', 'great', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'text.To', 'review', 'Eragon', 'fairly', 'boyfriend', 'took', 'two', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'would', 'judge', 'movie', 'book', 'did', 'NOT', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'bias.We', 'thought', 'movie', 'did', 'VERY', 'poor', 'job.Let', 'look', 'why', 'Interestingly', 'things', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'as', 'well', 'Probably', 'most', 'key', 'issue', 'was', 'development', 'Saphira', 'dragon', 'book', 'Ergaon', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'time', 'grow', 'care', 'other', 'are', 'subtle', 'interplays', 'Saphira', 'jealousy', 'love', 'book', 'substance', 'probably', 'best', 'done', 'key', 'story.To', 'five', 'second', 'explosion', 'where', 'Saphira', 'morphs', 'gremlin-like', 'baby', 'dragon', 'full', 'grown', 'dragon', 'was', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'ridiculous', 'killed', 'much', 'meaning', 'story', 'Interestingly', 'Bob', 'boyfriend', 'found', 'morph', 'equally', 'ridiculous', 'Even', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'was', 'wrong.So', 'many', 'movie', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'stolen', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'hard', 'count', 'one', 'particular', 'had', 'rolling', 'ground', 'laughter', 'was', 'when', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'oh', 'sorry', 'mean', 'Eragon', 'was', 'wistfully', 'looking', 'off', 'sunset', 'music', 'swelled', 'kept', 'looking', 'second', 'sun', 'Tattoine', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'obvious', 'there', 'were', 'sections', 'dialogue', 'where', 'literally', 'could', 'recite', 'words', 'characters', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'book', 'things', 'said', 'were', 'THAT', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'books', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'set', 'designers', 'would', 'keep', 'copies', 'book', 'set', 'referring', 'page', 'page', 'ensure', 'had', 'details', 'exactly', 'right', 'JK', 'Rowlings', 'was', 'called', 'frequently', 'when', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'ensure', 'costumes', 'environments', 'were', 'perfect.In', 'comparison', 'have', 'wonder', 'movie', 'makers', 'here', 'even', 'read', 'book', 'things', 'got', 'wrong', 'are', 'staggering', 'Yes', 'could', 'say', 'book', 'was', 'very', 'flawed', 'begin', 'were', 'trying', 'fix', 'were', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'book', 'Instead', 'even', 'important', 'parts', 'book', 'are', 'lost', 'completely', 'thievery', 'involved', 'movie', 'almost', 'even', 'more', 'blatant', 'what', 'book', 'held.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'book', 'was', 'flaws', 'example', 'one', 'serious', 'issue', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'female', 'character', 'elf', 'Arya', 'was', 'comatose', '99', '%', 'book', 'movie', 'Arya', 'much', 'more', 'talkative', 'could', 'say', 'changed', 'book', 'here', 'was', 'enhancing', 'Arwen', 'Eowyn', 'part', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'book', 'had', 'flaw', 'fixed', 'healthy', 'change', 'course', 'somehow', 'turned', 'Arya', 'elf', 'human', 'was', 'minor', 'compared', 'other', 'issues.In', 'general', 'damage', 'movie', 'plot', 'wrought', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'severe', 'destroyed', 'Eragon', 'relationship', 'Saphira', 'destroyed', 'much', 'meaning', 'Brom', 'mentorship', 'Murtagh', 'friendship', 'variety', 'villager', 'issues', 'Eragon', 'various', 'people', 'was', 'simplified', 'everyone', 'scared', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'end', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'prejudice', 'i.e', 'book', 'knowledge', 'felt', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'what', 'offered', 'story', 'who', 'HAD', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'felt', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'how', 'interpreted', 'book', 'Most', 'movies', 'least', 'please', 'book', 'readers', 'please', 'movie', 'viewers', 'movie', 'fail', 'BOTH', 'counts', 'quite', 'infamous', 'achievement']",N/A

I don't know whats worse - the blatant rip-offs of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" or the very weak casting. And lets not even start on the dialogue.I think the main problem here is the casting. The young boy they selected to play the lead is not at all convincing or a very good actor in any sense of the word. Then there is the strange problem of character and place names. I swear, its as if the writer was so unimaginative that he actually fused together various names from LOTR and Star Wars to create new names for everything here. Pathetic.The dialogue is beyond bad. The language used in the book was pretty pedestrian (at least there was an excuse due to the young age of the author) but for a script to sound so sad is inexcusable. Here are a few gems (read and weep!):""What wisdom can I give people that they haven't already learned? What feats can I achieve that an army couldn't do better? It's insanity!"" - by Eragon""My mind is the only sanctuary that has not been stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I've learned to defend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts.""""Oaths betrayed, souls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers!""""You are an enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve.""Add to that the numbing performances of all concerned. To be fair, the dragon special effects were very good, but this has been done better in countless other films.At the end of it, this film gives off a very ""cheap"" look. It looks like something that was produced for the Sci-Fi Channel but then someone had the sick idea to actually release this to mainstream theaters. Bad idea. No wonder this flopped (as it should have), as it has no redeeming features that I can think of.Not Recommended. You deserve better than to spend your money on this nonsense.

These warriors and their dragons brought peace and prosperity to the land for many years.  But one of them, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), wanted all the power for himself.  He betrayed and killed the others and became king of the land.  As is always the case in these tales, he rules with an iron fist and is hated by all.Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young man in the kingdom.  This seventeen year old is content to farm his uncle's land.  One day, while out hunting, he finds a weird stone.  He takes it home, and it hatches.  He now has a baby dragon on his hands.The dragon grows quickly, and Eragon learns that he is a dragon rider.  He is a fulfillment of prophecy and the last hope of the resistance to defeat Galbatorix.  He learns this from Brom (Jeremy Irons), a man from his village who tries to teach him a little about his new life while taking him to safety with the rebels.  Will they survive the perilous journey?First, what worked.  The acting was great.  The scenery was fantastic, and the special effects were awesome.  The dragon looked so real.  I'm seriously considering reading the books to see just what happens next.Unfortunately, the actors and special effects teams were working with a very weak script.  Part of that is the basic stories fault.  Based on a book by the same name, the story feels like Star Wars with bits of other fantasy novels thrown in.  Of course, most of these ""original"" stories borrowed heavily from what came before them, so it's not like that in and of itself is a crime.The bigger problem is the length.  I feel like there is story missing from the movie.  Eragon learns magic overnight and we never see him bond with his dragon.  What I thought to be plot threads were introduced then lead nowhere.  I realize they were trying to keep the running time down since the movie is aimed at kids, but I think they could have found some other way to trim the time.Speaking of kids, they may or may not like the movie.

You can definitely see the influences in the story line;  Tolkien, Lewis, McCaffrey, and even Lucas.The script overall was mediocre.  I think they were thinking Tolkien and ended up the DragonHeart.

According to what I had heard, it was far from being a good movie, but I was curious, so I decided to give it a try. A friend had given me the book on which this film is based as a Christmas present, and I decided to read it if the movie had at least something that managed to charm me.Regarding the plot, I suppose I should start by saying that the main character is Eragon (Ed Speleers), a young man that discovers a blue stone he wants to trade for something to feed his family. Unable to do so, Eragon decides to keep the stone, and receives a very big surprise when the stone turns to be a dragon's egg, and he makes the acquaintance of a new friend, a young dragon named Saphira. The birth of Saphira is a powerful magical event noticed by many, among them King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the man that rules Alagaesia the land where Eragon lives.Galbatorix used to be a dragon rider, but he betrayed the other dragon riders and became a tyrant, ruling his empire with strength and without mercy. From his point of view, Eragon and Saphira are a threat, and they must join him or be wiped out.Galbatorix makes the wrong move, though, and turns Eragon into an enemy. The young man decides to join the Varden, those that oppose the king. With the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an old bard that is a lot more than what he seems to be, Eragon will try to find his path, with Saphira by her side.That sounds interesting and you want to know more? Well, watch the movie. It is not perfect, but it is entertaining, the kind of movie that engages the spectator quickly in the adventures of the main characters, and makes them care. Of course, recommended...Belen AlcatPS: By the way, after watching this movie I immediately started reading Christopher Paolini's ""Eragon"", and I loved it.

Out of no where appears a shiny blue stone the size of a large watermelon. He takes it home with him and at first tries to sell it to a local vendor. The vendor realizing immediately this is something King Galbatrorix (John Malkovich) will want to kill for will have nothing to do with it. Eragon takes it home and hides it in the barn.What Eragon doesn't know is he has been chosen by an elfin princess who sent to stone magically to him to keep it away from the evil King. Shortly after hiding the stone, which is really one of the last dragon eggs to exist, it hatches before Eragon's eyes. What emerges is a beautiful blue dragon which quickly grows up to become a very large dragon. A dragon that read his thoughts and communicate telepathically with him. Her name is Saphira (Rachel Weisz). She tells Eragon she's waited 1000 years to be born to the right person. Her rider. Him.Eragon learns from the local storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons) that the land used to be filled with dragons and their chosen riders. They were the peacekeepers. Even the King use to be a rider. Over time greed inhabited them and a civil war broke out killing what they believed to be all the dragons and most of their riders. Brom who was also a dragon rider carries much guilt about this battle. He takes it upon himself to mentor the boy who has also inherited the magic that comes to every rider.Eragon starts off as an arrogant boy who acts prematurely. Brom tries to instill in him to be wiser with his actions because a rider will live if the dragon dies but if a rider dies so does his dragon. And the evil King knows this also which puts Eragon's life and that of his dragon at stake. At the moment his biggest hurdle is the malicious wizard, Durza (Robert Carlyle), sent by the King to kill Eragon, and finding the Varden Rebels who went into seclusion after the age of dragons.I felt all the actors did an exceptional job. I even enjoyed Jeremy Irons who I've never been especially warm to. The dragon special effects are a highlight to be sure. Saphira is magnificent and blue! The movie is listed as containing violence and mature themes but I didn't find it nearly as violent as Narnia or Lord of the Rings (both of which I loved). In some instances the relationships did feel sped up causing a loss of connections but the real characters are the dragon and her rider. Eragon ends with one battle over only to lead the way for another. I sense a sequel. This movie is based on the book of the same name by Christopher Paolini and is part of a trilogy. I have not read the books but after seeing the movie and checking out the ""spanning time"" feature on the official website I'm putting them on my wish list.

Based upon the first book written by the young author Christopher Paolini in 2003, ""Eragon"" is about a teenager named Eragon (played by Edward Speleers) in a fictional kingdom named Alagasia.  While hunting one day, he finds what turns out to be a dragon egg.  The egg hatches revealing a young dragon inside that quickly grows into a powerful winged animal.  Named Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz), the dragon and its chosen rider, Eragon, are bound to each other for life.  Of course, someone didn't want the dragon to be born nor find a rider.  That someone is Alagasia's evil king named Galbatorix (John Malkovich) who is assisted by an equally evil wizard named Durza (Robert Carlyle).  Once, the skies over Alagasia had been filled with dragons and dragon-riders, including Galbatorix; but he was successful in destroying virtually all of them.  However, one dragon-rider from an earlier time had survived: Brom (Jeremy Irons), who becomes Eragon's mentor.  And, who had dropped the egg in the forest that allowed Eragon to find it?  A princess named Arya (Sienna Guillory).Though the plot & characters sound interesting, they bear a strong resemblance to other works that predate ""Eragon"": namely, ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"".  Being a long time fan of ""Star Wars"" myself, one cannot help but notice the strong similarities between Eragon and Luke Skywalker, Brom and Obi-wan Kenobi, Arya and Princess Leia, Galbatorix and Emperor Palpatine, Durza and Darth Vader, as well as Murtagh (Garrett Hedlund) and Han Solo.  As Han Solo in the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" comes to Luke's rescue in the nick of time, so does Murtagh come to Eragon's rescue in one crucial scene.  Further, the whole dragon and magic-wielding dragon-rider past of Alagasia is very similar to the days of the Republic in ""Star Wars"" that was guarded by the Force-wielding Jedi.  As for the similarities with ""Lord of the Rings"", as in J.R.R. Tolkien's classic work, the world of ""Eragon"" is a world of magic, sorcerers, elves, dwarves and an Elvish language.  Thus, with the release of ""Eragon"" in 2006 being only 1 year after ""Star Wars III"" was released and 3 years after the release of the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, one has to wonder whether ""Eragon"" was an attempt to cash in on the success of these previous works by using similar plot & character elements.  With an estimated budget of $100-million and an approximate net gross of $75-million four months after the film's release, ""Eragon"" was a box-office failure.One more aspect to examine in ""Eragon"" is the film's director: Stefen Fangmeier.  A long-time special affects artist who worked on films such as ""Terminator 2"" (1991), ""Hook"" (1991), ""Twister"" (1996), ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""Galaxy Quest"" (1999), ""The Perfect Storm"" (2000), and ""Master and Commander"" (2003), his first solo directorial work was ""Eragon"".  While the special effects in ""Eragon"" were great (like so many other dragon-based films that predate it), the story (as I have already pointed out) was nothing new.  Hence, my rating for ""Eragon"" is 3 out of 5 stars.",3,"""Eragon"": The Good and the Bad",1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,3187,"['highly', 'anticipated', '2006', 'film', 'Eragon', 'was', 'most', 'strong', 'disappointment', 'Based', 'first', 'book', 'written', 'young', 'author', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', '2003', 'Eragon', 'teenager', 'named', 'Eragon', 'played', 'Edward', 'Speleers', 'fictional', 'kingdom', 'named', 'Alagasia', 'hunting', 'one', 'day', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'dragon', 'egg', 'egg', 'revealing', 'young', 'dragon', 'quickly', 'powerful', 'winged', 'animal', 'Named', 'Saphira', 'voice', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'dragon', 'chosen', 'rider', 'Eragon', 'are', 'bound', 'other', 'life', 'course', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'dragon', 'be', 'born', 'find', 'rider', 'someone', 'Alagasia', 'evil', 'king', 'named', 'Galbatorix', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'assisted', 'equally', 'evil', 'wizard', 'named', 'Durza', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Once', 'skies', 'Alagasia', 'had', 'been', 'filled', 'dragons', 'dragon-riders', 'including', 'Galbatorix', 'was', 'successful', 'destroying', 'virtually', 'However', 'one', 'dragon-rider', 'earlier', 'time', 'had', 'survived', 'Brom', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'Eragon', 'mentor', 'who', 'had', 'dropped', 'egg', 'forest', 'allowed', 'Eragon', 'find', 'A', 'princess', 'named', 'Arya', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'plot', 'characters', 'sound', 'interesting', 'bear', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'other', 'works', 'predate', 'Eragon', 'namely', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Being', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Star', 'Wars', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'strong', 'similarities', 'Eragon', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'Brom', 'Obi-wan', 'Kenobi', 'Arya', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'Galbatorix', 'Emperor', 'Palpatine', 'Durza', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'as', 'well', 'Murtagh', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Han', 'Solo', 'original', '1977', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Luke', 'rescue', 'nick', 'time', 'so', 'Murtagh', 'come', 'Eragon', 'rescue', 'one', 'crucial', 'scene', 'Further', 'whole', 'dragon', 'magic-wielding', 'dragon-rider', 'past', 'Alagasia', 'very', 'similar', 'days', 'Republic', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'guarded', 'Force-wielding', 'Jedi', 'similarities', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'classic', 'work', 'world', 'Eragon', 'world', 'magic', 'sorcerers', 'elves', 'dwarves', 'Elvish', 'language', 'Thus', 'release', 'Eragon', '2006', 'being', 'only', '1', 'year', 'Star', 'Wars', 'III', 'was', 'released', '3', 'years', 'release', 'last', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'one', 'wonder', 'Eragon', 'was', 'attempt', 'cash', 'success', 'previous', 'works', 'using', 'similar', 'plot', 'character', 'elements', 'estimated', 'budget', '100-million', 'approximate', 'net', 'gross', '75-million', 'four', 'months', 'film', 'release', 'Eragon', 'was', 'box-office', 'failure.One', 'more', 'aspect', 'examine', 'Eragon', 'film', 'director', 'Stefen', 'Fangmeier', 'long-time', 'special', 'affects', 'artist', 'who', 'worked', 'films', 'such', 'Terminator', '2', '1991', 'Hook', '1991', 'Twister', '1996', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '1998', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', '1999', 'Perfect', 'Storm', '2000', 'Master', 'Commander', '2003', 'first', 'solo', 'directorial', 'work', 'was', 'Eragon', 'special', 'effects', 'Eragon', 'were', 'great', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'dragon-based', 'films', 'predate', 'story', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'Hence', 'rating', 'Eragon', '3', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1055466,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B000NA28HU,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","** SPOILERS ahead, in case you can't predict the whole movie anyway **Another entry in my neverending quest to watch every last fantasy and science fiction film ever, no matter how bad,  ERAGON - based on the supposedly awful first novel by the then-teenage Christopher Paolini - is surprisingly enough not nearly as terrible as I expected it to be.  It kept me awake at least, and only had one or two actually cringe-inducing moments; I suspect that, as much as I'm bored with generic stuff like this, I'm also more able to tolerate some of it simply because I like the Tolkien-influenced genre tropes to begin with; those who don't have patience for stuff like farmboys-becoming-chosen-heroes for no reason whatsoever other than that's what the story says will probably be less generous than I am, and perhaps be annoyed that they've seen it all before even if they haven't seen it nearly as many times as I have. There's something to be said for being a genre specialist I suppose.But generic this story is, unfortunately, and ultimately its greatest sin is dullness and predictability. Let's see how few words it takes to sum it up: years ago there were dragons and dragonriders that protected the land of Alagasia, until one day one of them went all bad and decided to kill all of his buddies and take power over the land for himself. His name was John Malkovich, oops I mean Galbatorix (Paolini's strength, if he has one, is not in naming). But one egg somehow got saved (this is never explained) and eventually a young woman guarding it, Arya (Sienna Guillory) saves it from the king's evil magician Durza (Robert Carlyle) by sending it to Eragon (Ed Speleers) a young farmboy. The king soon realizes what's up and sends people to kill the kid, but not before the dragon hatches. Soon the town is aflame and Eragon has to escape with his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) - which grows to adulthood instantly in one of those ""magic"" moments. They're helped out by an older, wise man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, sorry I mean Brom (Jeremy Irons, who also narrates the opening few minutes) who knows - well, you'll figure it out. They have to get to the Vardens, the people who resist the king, but Eragon gets a psychic message from the imprisoned Arya and decides to go save her; Brom of course counsels against this but Eragon being headstrong goes ahead, penetrates the Death Star and saves Princess Leia with the help of the brash young Han Solo, but not before Brom sacrifices himself in the fight against Darth Vader...oops, there I did it again. Well, you get the idea. And at the end there's a spectacular battle as the dragon has learned to breathe fire and Eragon gets to avenge Brom, yadda yadda yadda.What saves this from being really horrible is the acting of Irons and Weisz, who really put a lot of heart and seriousness into this silly stuff, some nice photography that actually has a decent range of light and color palettes compared to the typical modern action film (courtesy of DP Hugh Jackson), and relatively competent and brisk direction on the part of first-time feature director Fangmeier. Yes, the 104 minutes gloss over an awful lot of stuff that must have been developed better (well one hopes so) in the book, but this being so utterly lacking in originality only the stupidest or youngest and least experienced of viewers are going to really have trouble knowing what's going on or filling in the blanks. Even really idiotic scenes like Irons' reappearance in the magician's stronghold just in time to save Eragon by taking a spear for him can probably be explained through ""magic"" which we gradually learn lets dragonriders do just about anything. How convenient.So I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if you're in the mood for completely undemanding, mindless fantasy there's plenty out there that is much worse, and I'm happy to give it two stars; in a really generous mood it could even push for a third.",2,Predictable melange of better films & stories isn't as bad as it could have been,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,3955,"['**', 'SPOILERS', 'ahead', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'whole', 'movie', 'anyway', '**Another', 'entry', 'neverending', 'quest', 'watch', 'last', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'ever', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'ERAGON', 'based', 'supposedly', 'awful', 'first', 'novel', 'then-teenage', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'terrible', 'expected', 'be', 'kept', 'awake', 'least', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'actually', 'cringe-inducing', 'moments', 'suspect', 'as', 'much', ""'m"", 'bored', 'generic', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'also', 'more', 'able', 'tolerate', 'simply', 'like', 'Tolkien-influenced', 'genre', 'tropes', 'begin', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'stuff', 'farmboys-becoming-chosen-heroes', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'other', 'what', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'less', 'generous', 'am', 'perhaps', 'be', 'annoyed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'being', 'genre', 'specialist', 'suppose.But', 'generic', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'ultimately', 'greatest', 'sin', 'dullness', 'predictability', 'Let', 'see', 'how', 'few', 'words', 'sum', 'up', 'years', 'were', 'dragons', 'dragonriders', 'protected', 'land', 'Alagasia', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'went', 'bad', 'decided', 'kill', 'buddies', 'take', 'power', 'land', 'name', 'was', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'mean', 'Galbatorix', 'Paolini', 'strength', 'one', 'not', 'naming', 'one', 'egg', 'somehow', 'got', 'saved', 'never', 'explained', 'eventually', 'young', 'woman', 'guarding', 'Arya', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'king', 'evil', 'magician', 'Durza', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'sending', 'Eragon', 'Ed', 'Speleers', 'young', 'farmboy', 'king', 'soon', 'what', 'up', 'people', 'kill', 'kid', 'not', 'dragon', 'hatches', 'Soon', 'town', 'aflame', 'Eragon', 'escape', 'dragon', 'Saphira', 'voiced', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'adulthood', 'instantly', 'one', 'magic', 'moments', ""'re"", 'helped', 'out', 'older', 'wise', 'man', 'named', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'sorry', 'mean', 'Brom', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'also', 'opening', 'few', 'minutes', 'who', 'well', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'have', 'get', 'Vardens', 'people', 'who', 'resist', 'king', 'Eragon', 'psychic', 'message', 'imprisoned', 'Arya', 'decides', 'go', 'save', 'Brom', 'course', 'counsels', 'Eragon', 'being', 'headstrong', 'ahead', 'Death', 'Star', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'help', 'brash', 'young', 'Han', 'Solo', 'not', 'Brom', 'sacrifices', 'fight', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'oops', 'did', 'again', 'Well', 'get', 'idea', 'end', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'dragon', 'learned', 'breathe', 'fire', 'Eragon', 'avenge', 'Brom', 'yadda', 'yadda.What', 'being', 'really', 'horrible', 'acting', 'Irons', 'Weisz', 'who', 'really', 'put', 'lot', 'heart', 'seriousness', 'silly', 'stuff', 'nice', 'photography', 'actually', 'decent', 'range', 'light', 'color', 'palettes', 'compared', 'typical', 'modern', 'action', 'film', 'courtesy', 'DP', 'Hugh', 'Jackson', 'relatively', 'competent', 'brisk', 'direction', 'part', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Fangmeier', 'Yes', '104', 'minutes', 'gloss', 'awful', 'lot', 'stuff', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'better', 'well', 'one', 'so', 'book', 'being', 'so', 'utterly', 'lacking', 'originality', 'only', 'stupidest', 'youngest', 'least', 'experienced', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'really', 'have', 'trouble', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'filling', 'blanks', 'Even', 'really', 'idiotic', 'scenes', 'Irons', 'reappearance', 'magician', 'stronghold', 'just', 'time', 'save', 'Eragon', 'taking', 'spear', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'explained', 'magic', 'gradually', 'learn', 'lets', 'dragonriders', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'How', 'convenient.So', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'mood', 'completely', 'undemanding', 'mindless', 'fantasy', 'plenty', 'there', 'much', 'worse', ""'m"", 'happy', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'really', 'generous', 'mood', 'could', 'even', 'push', 'third']",N/A

1055468,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000NA28HU,Newton Ooi,"[4, 5]","This movie is based on the first book of a three-series trilogy inspired by the LOTR movies.  I have not read any of the books, and will only comment on the movie as a stand-alone piece of work.  The strongest impression I had of this movie is the amatuerish feel of everything, including the dialogue, acting, action scenes, story line, and soundtrack.First, the dialogue was simple and boring, full of short sentences and seemed to be ripoffs from other movies.  For example, there is a scene when an evil sorcerer named Durza leads an army of grotesque humanoid creatures into battle.  From the setting of the scene, to the way it was shot, seemed like a total copy of the scene in LOTR: Two Towers when Saruman sends his Uruk-Hai army of to battle.Second, the acting was horrible.  From the death scene of Brom, to King Galbatorix's musings on his throne, most of the serious scenes looked fake.  One good example is after Eragon finds his uncle dead.  Brom tries to take him away and Eragon resists with angry words but weak actions.  Brom easily puts him on a horse and leads him away.  It seems Eragon knew the entire time he had to leave, but was just trying to throw a tantrum.  A more realistic version would be to have Eragon resist Brom violently, and the latter having to knock out the former with a good punch in the face.Third, the action scenes were very disappointing.  This is most apparent at the end when Galbatorix's army invades the land of the Varden.  The ensuing swordfights looked totally staged, and there were several times when two swords are supposed to clash, but no sound is heard.Fourth, the story line was full of holes.  The entire battle scene seems to belong to the bad guys, but somehow the good guys end up victorious by the movie's end.  How did this happen?  Also, who teaches the dragon Saphira how to breathe fire.  One moment she blows hot air; then after one night with the Varden she can blow streams of fire.The soundtrack was also a big disappointment.  I heard one tune repeated over and over again for all the action scenes.  The rest of the movie the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  Of all the recent fantasy movies so far; LOTR, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia and this, this movie has the worst soundtrack.Overall, a bad viewing experience.  It was not the worst movie of 2006, but for the hype it received, it was the biggest disappointment.

The name put me off a bit because it was just suspiciously close to the name of the hero from LOTR. Should have followed my gut and rented instead of buying because this is a one time viewing event.Unfortunately, LOTR set the bar so high for this type of movie that the chances of anything even coming close are zero to none. Remember that what gave LOTR its greatness was the source material. Tolkien was a genius and his meticulous development of a whole realm of existence was amazing. LOTR is (and will probably always be) the gold standard for fantasy, sword, and sorcery. Good acting and special effects can NEVER make up for a weak story. This is the problem with much of Star Wars for example...and most modern films (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) in general. And then there is the whole bugaboo about adapting books to film...That being said. If you go into this movie not expecting something ""great"" but just enjoyable, most ""young"" fantasy buffs should enjoy this film. The strengths are the visuals. Unfortunately the weakness is just about everything else (plot...yawn, acting...a whimpy ""hero"", predictable villains, sassy dragon, etc.).The female lead is enchanting and I hope to see more of her in the future. The male lead on the other hand was totally miscast. Even in the film he admits ""yea you probably expected more"". Even the black leader of the resistance somehow seemed like a token of political correctness.

I'm sure by now, many are sick of the comparsions to LOTR, but Peter Jackson set a standard for fantasy movies that is going to be hard to live up to.  Jackson did an excellent job of casting LOTR and writing the screenplay.  He kept true to the essence of the story.  This was not the case with Eragon.Eragon was almost completely miscast.  The characters of Brom, Arya, Murtagh, Galbatorix, and Durza (the Shade) were all wrong.  I thought the choice for Eragon was ok, but because of the poor script, he came off dull.  Djimon Hounsou was a good choice for Ajihad, but again, the terrible dialogue didn't show his talent.  Jeremy Irons as Brom was awful.  What's actually funny is that he probably would have been better cast as Galbatorix!  And then there are the ""monsters"" of the film, which were less than scary.  Urgals are fat, bald men?  And what the heck were the Ra'zac?  Again, here is where Jackson shines!  The Wraiths, Orcs, Goblins, and Uruk-hai of LOTR were all eerie, scary, and menacing to watch on screen.  Eragon's monsters are portrayed this way in the book, but Fangmeier could not convincingly translate them onto the big screen.While I didn't mind the changes that Jackson made to LOTR, and even found some of them to be more exciting than what really happened in the book, i.e. Helm's Deep (sorry LOTR fans); Fangmeier was not as adept at this.Overall, this movie was poorly made.

1055478,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000NA28HU,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 1]","Chris Paolini, with author of the book that the film ""Eragon"" is based on, was only 15-years old when he began writing his fantasy fable.  While the age at which he wrote it is remarkable, the end product is predictable from someone that age.  It is a very shallow and derivative story that translates to an unsatisfying movie experience.""Eragon"" tells the tale of a young boy, the titular Eragon (Ed Speleers), who comes into the possession of a magical dragon egg that hatches to become Saphira, the blue dragon.  With the help of Saphira and a former dragon-rider named Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon seeks to avenge his father's death and defeat the evil forces of Galbatorix (John Malkovich).The tale is as old as literary time and it has found itself manifested in such phenomenal tales as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  So, while the tale is nothing original, a new angle on its telling can still make it memorable.Alas, ""Eragon"" fails in that regard.  This story is merely generic retelling with very unremarkable characters and adventures.  It is unfortunate that this film should be this way, but is it simply a product of an unpolished scribe (Paolini) whose work I'm not certain most directors could make into something compelling.",2,Derivative of too many of films,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,1247,"['Chris', 'Paolini', 'author', 'book', 'film', 'Eragon', 'based', 'was', 'only', '15-years', 'old', 'when', 'began', 'writing', 'fantasy', 'fable', 'age', 'wrote', 'remarkable', 'end', 'product', 'predictable', 'someone', 'age', 'very', 'shallow', 'derivative', 'story', 'unsatisfying', 'movie', 'experience', 'Eragon', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'titular', 'Eragon', 'Ed', 'Speleers', 'who', 'possession', 'magical', 'dragon', 'egg', 'become', 'Saphira', 'blue', 'dragon', 'help', 'Saphira', 'former', 'dragon-rider', 'named', 'Brom', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Eragon', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'defeat', 'evil', 'forces', 'Galbatorix', 'John', 'Malkovich', '.The', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'literary', 'time', 'found', 'manifested', 'such', 'phenomenal', 'tales', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Star', 'Wars', 'So', 'tale', 'nothing', 'original', 'new', 'angle', 'telling', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'memorable.Alas', 'Eragon', 'fails', 'regard', 'story', 'merely', 'generic', 'retelling', 'very', 'unremarkable', 'characters', 'adventures', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'simply', 'product', 'unpolished', 'scribe', 'Paolini', 'work', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'most', 'directors', 'could', 'make', 'something', 'compelling']",N/A
1055479,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B000NA28HU,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[3, 5]","I have not read the books associated with this film so I'm in a good position to evaluate the film on its own merit. Clearly people are all over the place with this film (from one star to five stars and everything in between) and I can detect without difficulty that many folks feel strongly about the movie either one way or another.THE STORY: This film manifests your basic ""good versus evil"" theme. A malevolent despot king rules the land but he has one fear -- that a ""dragonrider"" (and a dragon) will reappear to ultimately dethrone and destroy him. This nasty king has a powerful wizard of sorts, ready at his beck and call to deliver on his evil plans. The wizard rules over a really nasty pack of dreadful pseudo-humans who possess magical powers and skills.But the dragonrider, Eragon, and his female dragon, Saphira, also utilize magic to do battle with the bad guys. Various mentors and allies come along to guide and aid Eragon and, of course, there is a culmination of the two factions in a Battle Royal. The film's conclusion clearly leaves the way open for the sequel film.Let me say up front that this is a fine fantasy film, lots of action, a good story, superb cinematography, and great acting. What I detected was a number of ""film techniques"" (for lack of a better phrase) which mirrored the action in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition).I realize that they are the same sort of story and that ""Eragon"" may, in fact, soon turn into a series of films like LOTRs; however, at every turn I kept finding myself reliving scenes from LOTRs so I was just a tiny bit distracted by this.The huge bulk of complaints that I see on this film (especially at IMDB) is that the books are purportedly so much better than the film. Well, when was this not true in the case of nearly any film which had its genesis in a book? So I therefore discount much of this facet of criticism, even though it may be true. I felt the same way about LOTRs but this diminution of excellence from book to film was a personal expectation -- as a consequence, I was not disappointed when I viewed the film trilogy.So here are my recommendations: if you have read the books and feel strongly that the film will be a weak second, then don't watch it. But if you've never read the books and you want to see a fine film (even if it borrows a bit in technique from LOTRs), then I think that you'll enjoy this one.The Special Edition version contains a second disc -- here's what you'll find on it:-- audio commentary with Director Stefen Fangmeier.-- extended and deleted scenes with optional director's commentary.-- ""Inside the Inheritance Trilogy"": ""The Magic of Eragon"" documentary.-- ""Eldest"" -- the first two chapters of the second book in the ""Inheritance Trilogy"".-- ""The Inhabitants of Alagasia"" character featurettes.-- Arya's Ambush original animatic sequence with optional director's commentary.-- Vision of Eragon conceptual art gallery.-- pronunciation guide.-- original and unused storyboard galleries.-- Christopher Paolini interview.-- ""The Secrets of Alagasia"" visual effects featurette.-- Saphira's animation guide CGI featurette with director's commentary.-- original teaser and trailerThis 2006 film is in widescreen and runs a total of 103 minutes.",4,"NOT a book comparison review (2-disc Special Edition), details",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,3338,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'associated', 'film', ""'m"", 'good', 'position', 'evaluate', 'film', 'own', 'merit', 'Clearly', 'people', 'are', 'place', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'five', 'stars', 'everything', 'can', 'detect', 'difficulty', 'many', 'folks', 'feel', 'strongly', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'another.THE', 'STORY', 'film', 'basic', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'theme', 'malevolent', 'despot', 'king', 'rules', 'land', 'one', 'fear', 'dragonrider', 'dragon', 'will', 'reappear', 'ultimately', 'dethrone', 'destroy', 'nasty', 'king', 'powerful', 'wizard', 'sorts', 'ready', 'beck', 'call', 'deliver', 'evil', 'plans', 'wizard', 'rules', 'really', 'nasty', 'pack', 'dreadful', 'pseudo-humans', 'who', 'possess', 'magical', 'powers', 'skills.But', 'dragonrider', 'Eragon', 'female', 'dragon', 'Saphira', 'also', 'utilize', 'magic', 'do', 'battle', 'bad', 'guys', 'Various', 'mentors', 'allies', 'come', 'along', 'guide', 'aid', 'Eragon', 'course', 'culmination', 'two', 'factions', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'film', 'conclusion', 'clearly', 'way', 'open', 'sequel', 'film.Let', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'fine', 'fantasy', 'film', 'lots', 'action', 'good', 'story', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'great', 'acting', 'What', 'detected', 'was', 'number', 'film', 'techniques', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'mirrored', 'action', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Trilogy', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'Special', 'Extended', 'Edition', '.I', 'realize', 'are', 'same', 'sort', 'story', 'Eragon', 'may', 'fact', 'soon', 'turn', 'series', 'films', 'LOTRs', 'however', 'turn', 'kept', 'finding', 'reliving', 'scenes', 'LOTRs', 'was', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'distracted', 'this.The', 'huge', 'bulk', 'complaints', 'see', 'film', 'especially', 'IMDB', 'books', 'are', 'purportedly', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Well', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'case', 'nearly', 'film', 'had', 'genesis', 'book', 'So', 'therefore', 'discount', 'much', 'facet', 'criticism', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'LOTRs', 'diminution', 'excellence', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'personal', 'expectation', 'consequence', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'when', 'viewed', 'film', 'trilogy.So', 'here', 'are', 'recommendations', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'feel', 'strongly', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'weak', 'second', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'want', 'see', 'fine', 'film', 'even', 'bit', 'technique', 'LOTRs', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one.The', 'Special', 'Edition', 'version', 'second', 'disc', 'here', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Stefen', 'Fangmeier.', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary.', 'Inheritance', 'Trilogy', 'Magic', 'Eragon', 'documentary.', 'Eldest', 'first', 'two', 'chapters', 'second', 'book', 'Inheritance', 'Trilogy', 'Inhabitants', 'Alagasia', 'character', 'featurettes.', 'Arya', 'Ambush', 'original', 'animatic', 'sequence', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary.', 'Vision', 'Eragon', 'conceptual', 'art', 'gallery.', 'pronunciation', 'guide.', 'original', 'unused', 'storyboard', 'galleries.', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'interview.', 'Secrets', 'Alagasia', 'visual', 'effects', 'featurette.', 'Saphira', 'animation', 'guide', 'CGI', 'featurette', 'director', 'commentary.', 'original', 'teaser', 'trailerThis', '2006', 'film', 'widescreen', 'total', '103', 'minutes']",N/A

I saw this yesterday in the theater and fell asleep 3 times. I liked the book, but this was just uninteresting.Here are two things you should be advised of before seeing this movie:1. The movie is NOTHING like the book- It seemed to me as if somebody read 5 chapters of the book and went ""Hey, I have an idea- This book is pretty impressive so far, so if we made a movie, despite the fact I we only know a little of the book, we could make a million dollars!"" This movie barely follows the book's plotline.2. The acting and special effects are terrible- At a couple times, I had a stomach ache, and the kids would have one too.To the director who decided to make this: Stop this madness NOW!

1055491,AVM4JATY3QDO2,B000NA28HU,Reviews4U,"[1, 1]","After I read the book ""Eragon"", I thought to myself, ""Wow, if they made a movie of this, it would be amazing."" Then one of my friends told me there already was a movie! Needless to say, I was pretty excited, and got my hands on it as soon as possible. I'm sorry to say, my love of Eragon was a little deflated. This has to be one of the worst fantasy movies I've ever seen besides The Last Airbender.Just a few of its major flaws-1) It doesn't follow the book AT ALL! Every time I watch it, I wonder if the director even read the book! It started off okay, then gradually got worse...and worse...and by the end, I actually said, ""Christopher Paolini has got to be furious at this."" No trip across the Hadarac Desert, no Twins, no Isidar Mirthrim. I was especially disappointed at the dwarf city, Tronjheim. You get quite a picture in your head when you read the book, but in the movie, it's so plain and unimpressive I almost skipped the scene.2) The script was absolutely horrible. I cringe every time Eragon says, ""Closer, so we can reach his heart!"" or when Murtagh says, ""I suggest you leave quickly!"" If Mr. Paolini lent a hand in writing the script, it would've been good, but he didn't, and it had the crappiest dialogue I've ever seen in a movie.3) Character development- none WHATSOEVER. Brom's just a grumpy old man, which, yes, he is in the book too, but the book makes you feel sorry for him when he dies. In the movie, you're just like, ""Oh, Brom died? Oh well. Let's move on."" And they just had to put Jeremy Irons in as Brom, which really makes me mad because he's a very good actor, but this movie brings his acting score way down.Arya had almost no part. She says a few lines scattered throughout the film, but there's no real part she plays. She's an imprisoned elf, Eragon rescues her, she doesn't stay deathly sick like she's supposed to, and in the final battle, she's an invincible amazon woman who doesn't even get a scratch.Eragon was okay, I guess: not as bad as everyone else. I had to give some credit to Ed Speleers. For this being his first movie ever and it being a trashy one at that, he actually did quite a decent job as Eragon, and was probably the most believable character in the movie. But like everyone else, there was no feeling to the characters. You couldn't sympathize with them, laugh with them, or anything.And a few more minor ones-1) Why does Saphira have feathers? She's a dragon, people, not a bird.2) Arya is an elf, and she's supposed to have pointed ears.3) In Carvahall, everyone's clothes are rags except for Eragon's (and Roran's, who's wearing JEANS!{yeah, no joke}), whose clothes are like a prince's.The one positive thing I have to say about this movie is the animation for Saphira. Her motions were really smooth and flawless- almost as good as the CG for 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes.'So, if you haven't read the book, this movie would be kind of okay, I guess, but if you have, avoid this like the plague.",2,Would have been one of the best fantasy films ever.,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,2969,"['read', 'book', 'Eragon', 'thought', 'myself', 'Wow', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'Then', 'one', 'friends', 'told', 'already', 'was', 'movie', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'got', 'hands', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'love', 'Eragon', 'was', 'little', 'deflated', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'fantasy', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Last', 'Airbender.Just', 'few', 'major', 'flaws-1', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Every', 'time', 'watch', 'wonder', 'director', 'even', 'read', 'book', 'started', 'off', 'okay', 'then', 'gradually', 'got', 'worse', 'worse', 'end', 'actually', 'said', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'got', 'be', 'furious', 'trip', 'Hadarac', 'Desert', 'Twins', 'Isidar', 'Mirthrim', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'dwarf', 'city', 'Tronjheim', 'get', 'quite', 'picture', 'head', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'so', 'plain', 'unimpressive', 'almost', 'skipped', 'scene.2', 'script', 'was', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'cringe', 'time', 'Eragon', 'Closer', 'can', 'reach', 'heart', 'when', 'Murtagh', 'suggest', 'leave', 'quickly', 'Mr.', 'Paolini', 'lent', 'hand', 'writing', 'script', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'had', 'crappiest', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie.3', 'Character', 'development-', 'none', 'WHATSOEVER', 'Brom', 'just', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'yes', 'book', 'too', 'book', 'feel', 'sorry', 'when', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'Oh', 'Brom', 'died', 'Oh', 'well', 'Let', 'move', 'just', 'had', 'put', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'as', 'Brom', 'really', 'mad', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'acting', 'score', 'way', 'down.Arya', 'had', 'almost', 'part', 'few', 'lines', 'scattered', 'film', 'real', 'part', 'imprisoned', 'elf', 'Eragon', ""n't"", 'stay', 'deathly', 'sick', 'supposed', 'final', 'battle', 'invincible', 'amazon', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'scratch.Eragon', 'was', 'okay', 'guess', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'give', 'credit', 'Ed', 'Speleers', 'being', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'being', 'trashy', 'one', 'actually', 'did', 'quite', 'decent', 'job', 'Eragon', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'believable', 'character', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'feeling', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'anything.And', 'few', 'more', 'minor', 'ones-1', 'Why', 'Saphira', 'have', 'feathers', 'dragon', 'people', 'not', 'bird.2', 'Arya', 'elf', 'supposed', 'have', 'pointed', 'ears.3', 'Carvahall', 'everyone', 'clothes', 'are', 'rags', 'Eragon', 'Roran', 'who', 'wearing', 'JEANS', 'yeah', 'joke', 'clothes', 'are', ""prince's.The"", 'one', 'positive', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'animation', 'Saphira', 'motions', 'were', 'really', 'smooth', 'flawless-', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'CG', ""'Rise"", 'Planet', 'Apes', ""'So"", 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'okay', 'guess', 'have', 'avoid', 'plague']",N/A

1055495,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000NA28HU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Eragon (Stefan Fangmeier, 2006)Fangmeier, the visual effects supervisor for a number of high-profile effects-heavy movies (among his resume are Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, and Twister, among many others), takes to the director's chair for his big screen debut. And my oh my, is it an ambitious one-- Christopher Paolini's epic novel Eragon, here adapted by Peter Buchman. Don't know the name? Well, this was only his second project. The first was Jurassic Park III.Are alarm bells going off in your head yet? They should be.If there's one thing Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien taught us, it's that if you put a lot of effects in a movie and back it up with some solid characters, audiences will, in fact, sit through three hours of movie. (Most other countries in the world recognize this. It's only America where we have this odd attention span problem with movies over two hours.) And Eragon demands a three-hour treatment; I mean, come on, this is a book of almost six hundred pages, and it's dense. Paolini packed a great deal of action into those pages, but there was more than enough room for character development, uneasy alliances, witty repartee, and all the other things that made the book such a fun read. Buchman, in short, butchered it. Major characters disappear entirely, and others exist only, it seems, to pacify readers of the novel. (Murtagh is the biggest major character given short shrift, getting only eight lines; the big plot twist regarding him is relegated to a useless piece of trivia in the film.) He did keep a good portion of the action, but that's about it.Worse is (some of) the acting. There are a number of big names in here, and they give varying levels of expertise in their performances. Jeremy Irons, by far, is the brightest light among them. As Brom, Eragon's mentor, Irons conveys the character's mix of amusement, despair, and gratitude quite well (in fact, Irons makes Brom a much more likable and three-dimensional chap than he was in the book). John Malkovich comes perilously close to overacting to unintentional hilarity as King Galbatorix; his only saving grace is that he doesn't get enough screen time to really mess things up. Joss Stone is as flatly uninteresting an actress as she is a singer. Robert Carlyle I didn't even recognize, he's so cardboard here. Djimon Hounsou looks as if he's about ready to burst into laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. Edward Speelers, the unknown cast in the title role, comes relatively close to getting it right, but there's no sense of him going from nave farm boy to accomplished warrior-mage. (I am, however, willing to place the blame for that entirely on the butchered script.) The others? Don't bother. Speelers, Irons, and Rachel Weisz (as the voice of Sephira the dragon) are the only characters here who get more than twenty or thirty lines in the entire film.The one thing Eragon does have in its favor is the visual effects. Given Fangmeier's usual job description, that's not surprising. A lot of the effects seem rather unrooted in the storyline, but there you go. And while Sephira's development is mostly sacrificed in the interests of saving time, what we see of her is wonderful, especially the scenes of her as an infant.Despite the above, I have to say, I seem to have liked the movie a lot more than most people did. It is not the book by any means, and it is clumsily-handled in the extreme, but I think it does manage to do what it sets out to-- be a mindless action flick with a whole lot of special effects. For a turn-your-brain-off good time, it's not awful if you've never read the book. ** ",2,Could've beern worse...,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,3627,"['Eragon', 'Stefan', 'Fangmeier', '2006', 'Fangmeier', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'number', 'high-profile', 'effects-heavy', 'movies', 'resume', 'are', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Terminator', '2', 'Twister', 'many', 'others', 'director', 'chair', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'oh', 'ambitious', 'one', 'Christopher', 'Paolini', 'epic', 'novel', 'Eragon', 'here', 'adapted', 'Peter', 'Buchman', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'Well', 'was', 'only', 'second', 'project', 'first', 'was', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'III.Are', 'alarm', 'bells', 'going', 'off', 'head', 'yet', 'should', 'be.If', 'one', 'thing', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adaptations', 'Tolkien', 'taught', 'put', 'lot', 'effects', 'movie', 'back', 'up', 'solid', 'characters', 'audiences', 'will', 'fact', 'sit', 'three', 'hours', 'movie', 'Most', 'other', 'countries', 'world', 'recognize', 'only', 'America', 'where', 'have', 'odd', 'attention', 'span', 'problem', 'movies', 'two', 'hours', 'Eragon', 'three-hour', 'treatment', 'mean', 'come', 'book', 'almost', 'six', 'hundred', 'pages', 'dense', 'Paolini', 'packed', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'pages', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'uneasy', 'alliances', 'witty', 'repartee', 'other', 'things', 'made', 'book', 'fun', 'read', 'Buchman', 'short', 'butchered', 'Major', 'characters', 'disappear', 'entirely', 'others', 'exist', 'only', 'pacify', 'readers', 'novel', 'Murtagh', 'biggest', 'major', 'character', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'getting', 'only', 'eight', 'lines', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'regarding', 'relegated', 'useless', 'piece', 'trivia', 'film', 'did', 'keep', 'good', 'portion', 'action', 'it.Worse', 'acting', 'are', 'number', 'big', 'names', 'here', 'give', 'varying', 'levels', 'expertise', 'performances', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'far', 'brightest', 'light', 'Brom', 'Eragon', 'mentor', 'Irons', 'character', 'mix', 'amusement', 'despair', 'gratitude', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'Irons', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'three-dimensional', 'chap', 'was', 'book', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'perilously', 'close', 'overacting', 'unintentional', 'hilarity', 'King', 'Galbatorix', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'as', 'flatly', 'uninteresting', 'actress', 'singer', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'so', 'cardboard', 'here', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'about', 'ready', 'burst', 'laughter', 'ludicrousness', 'Edward', 'Speelers', 'unknown', 'cast', 'title', 'role', 'relatively', 'close', 'getting', 'right', 'sense', 'going', 'nave', 'farm', 'boy', 'accomplished', 'warrior-mage', 'am', 'however', 'willing', 'place', 'blame', 'entirely', 'butchered', 'script', 'others', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Speelers', 'Irons', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'voice', 'Sephira', 'dragon', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'here', 'who', 'get', 'more', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'lines', 'entire', 'film.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Eragon', 'have', 'favor', 'visual', 'effects', 'Given', 'Fangmeier', 'usual', 'job', 'description', 'not', 'surprising', 'lot', 'effects', 'seem', 'rather', 'unrooted', 'storyline', 'there', 'go', 'Sephira', 'development', 'mostly', 'sacrificed', 'interests', 'saving', 'time', 'what', 'see', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'scenes', 'infant.Despite', 'above', 'have', 'say', 'seem', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'book', 'means', 'clumsily-handled', 'extreme', 'think', 'manage', 'do', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'whole', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'turn-your-brain-off', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'awful', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', '**']",N/A

1055500,A3GM64N13BILUP,B000NA28HU,Ron Cole,"[2, 2]","Eragon is not a bad movie - in fact, when judged on its own merits, it is both a respectable film and one that I enjoyed watching. There's action, likeable characters, believable special effects (the opening scene hooked me instantly), and an epic plot that will keep most in the audience interested. Younger viewers will probably be especially entertained, as they can see themselves in the roles of Eragon and/or Arya.Criticism of the movie really comes from two areas. The first is that the film attempts to pack too much into too short of a time frame, and thus fails to properly develop itself. Dragons grow from hatchlings to adults in the blink of an eye, and powerful magical spells appear to be learned in a day. Characters become best friends almost instantly, making viewers wonder how the bonds of trust were formed. Readers of the books received a much more detailed version of this adventure, so they can see the discrepancies more easily than those exposed to the material for the first time through the film (this is probably the reason so many are writing such negative reviews here). The film SHOULD have been expanded to incorporate more details/depth, but there are also limits as to how much can be transfered from a book.The other big criticism of this movie is that, as it is has been cut and edited, the story almost completely parallels Star Wars: A New Hope with a few Lord of the Rings elements thrown in. Does this description sound familiar: ""A princess is captured while attempting to get an important item into the hands of the rebellion. During her capture, the princess is able to transfer the item from her possession to a random location. The item falls into the hands of a farm boy, who's uncle (that raised him) is killed by those searching for the item. The boy meets an outcast old man that teaches him about a mystical power he can control, as well as his special destiny."" The similarities don't stop there, but that's as far as I'm willing to go in my explanation due to possible spoilers. Needless to say, if you know the plot of one film, you know the plot of both.I recommend Eragon to those looking for a fun fantasy film. Fans of the books will probably be disappointed with it, but those looking for something fun to watch during an afternoon could do a lot worse.

I think Narnia has been the best so far, and Eragon could have ranked way up there but it was somehow missing something.There's nothing new about the storyline itself...a boy finds a dragon egg and learns he's the dragon rider after the egg hatches and that he must save his kingdom from an evil king.  Perfect imagery for any young boy's imagination, and the scenes with the dragon in the movie are excellent.  The conflict in the movie is underdeveloped and all just gets wrapped up in the end with a quick battle.  The dragon rider and the king never meet face to face, although the ending was left wide open for a sequel.Despite a bit of violence, kids would probably love this movie.  As an adult, I felt the characters lacked definition.  The dragon actually seems out of place because it's obvious they spent more of the movie's budget on the dragon scenes, and less on developing the rest of the story.

I keep flipping through it once in a while, but between the blatant borrowing of so many tolkien concepts and names, the whining of the lead character - well, I just couldn't really get into it, sorry.  So, I was looking forward to the movie.  Sigh.  The script writer should have been crucified.  There is just no way to ""boil"" down a book with this many characters and scope - and ceratinly not with the ludicrious, weak dialogue that's in it.  Also, although the director thought it was a FABULOUS idea, there are WAY too many big name actors in here!  with horrible dialogue!  which not only overshadow the lead, there is so LITTLE time spent on them, you wonder why the money was spent on them.  There is nothing worse then watching a first rate actor struggle with stupid dialogue.  Clues from the director on what the movie was supposed to be like: Galbatorix is supposed to be ""conflicted"" - ahhh, really?  Didn't come across at all.  He just looks pissed and bored, if it's possible to have the combination.  The chick on the horse was an elf?  Well, since no mention of it was ever made, she doesn't have the ears, etc, how exactly is someone supposed to know that?  Dwarves are in this movie?  Um, where exactly?  Also, the dude with the long beard is a KING?  Did I miss where they introduce him that way?  It's absolutely ludicrous.  Maybe they'll get a new director from the second one as well.Saphira is great, and the lead actor really isn't too bad given HIS horrible dialogue, makes it worth watching.

Some of the names made me cringe as they provided a perfect example as to why people outside of the fantasy genre just don't respect it.  And of course, we have the farm boy who unsuspectingly gets chosen by fate to save the remnants of the world.  He has trouble accepting this duty at first even though all he really seemed to need was to learn three or four words of elvish magic in order to beat his main enemy.The best I can really say is that there's very little development or depth to most of the characters.  Everything pretty much just happens within a minute or two.  I was able to guess most of the plot twists well before they happened.  And I'm almost positive I can predict the reappearance of his older brother/cousin and guess the circumstances.  One problem with all of this may have been that the movie doesn't even last 2 hours.  It relied heavily on the typical symphony music and cliche speeches to invoke the various emotions and get the message across.I can't say it was an all together terrible movie.  It wasn't.  The initial scenes with the dragon as a baby were probably the most interesting I've ever seen (That doesn't last long though since the dragon has to magically evolve).  The CG elements were fine but would probably look cheap to those who really scrutinze it and compare it to some of the other really big productions out there.  The overall scenery really reminded me of Dragonheart as far as picture quality went.  The battle scenes were simple and basic.  Most of the final battle focused on the dragon breathing fire, not really bothering too much with the small armies fighting, which I'm sure will satisfy many anyways.  Once again, though, I just have to say that it somehow just felt short-changed.

I see the majority of reviewers here and other places like Netflix who gave it a good rating did not read the book, which is fortunate for them, because if you've read it, watching this movie will make you want to pull your hair out.About the only similarities between the movie and the book are the names of the characters and the fact that it, indeed, features a dragon.One reviewer tried to defend this film by stating they did the best they could with a 470 page book, but the Harry Potter books are far longer and while they may have to cut a lot of the storyline out of those movies, they still manage to keep it within JK Rowling's vision.Watching Eragon, one of the things I just could not get past enough to tolerate this movie, let alone enjoy it, was the fact the Saphira sounds like a teenage girl, or even sometimes a sexy young vixen.  I was expecting a dragon to sound a little more....well, ""dragon-like""...a little more ""other-worldly.""  And because Eragon and Saphira communicate telepathically, I was expecting the dialogue between them to have it's own unique sound as well...something that would make it obvious to the viewers that what was being said could only be heard between the two of them. I mean, come on!  Movie makers have been doing this for decades: Such as when a character in a movie is thinking something in his head that none of the other characters can hear... Would that have been so difficult?  The fact that the film-makers couldn't even pay this much attention to such an obvious aspect of this movie gives you an idea of how much else they didn't bother with.The only thing they got right was to cast Jeremy Irons as Brom.  The character who played Eragon was easy on the eyes, but he really needs some more acting lessons....or maybe just a better script.  And I will admit that the special effects people behind Saphira did a good job.  She may not sound like a dragon, but she indeed looks like one.My 8-year-daughter was so disappointed in this movie she was ready to chuck the DVD out the window before I stopped her, and she is really NOT hard to please.  In fact, I think this is probably the first movie she hasn't liked.I will be amazed if these same film makers have the nerve to make more movies from the rest of the Inheritance series.

Following Eragon as he acquires a Dragon egg and subsequently learns to be a Dragon Rider, this film has plenty of CGI animation and sword fights. Eragon has to fight to rid the lands of an evil king and his tyrannical rule and battles against a shade (or wizard to you and me) in the form of Robert Carlyle. All in all this is pretty standard fantasy film fare, with nothing highly original or earthshaking. The effects are good and the story, although lack lustre, manages to keep you watching. I'm inclined to feel if it was much longer I'd be getting bored though. The cast is sadly underused and Jeremy Irons and Malkovich could deliver so much more.

1055521,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000NA28HU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 10]","""Eragon"" is one of the most recent entries in the currently booming field of high-caliber fantasy epics, a theme of moviemaking that until fairly recently had to rely on a very infrequent rate of new live-action films (but has had a slew of great anime titles under its banner for years and years).  A dragon-lover's dream film, ""Eragon"" takes place in a vast mythical land once protected by heroic pairs of dragons and dragonriders.  Within the lifetimes of some of the characters, that status quo was destroyed as a rogue dragonrider, Galbatorix (John Malkovich) recruited sorcerors and an army to destroy the dragons and install himself as absolute ruler.  The focus of the movie is the new turning point, where the first new dragon to be born in years, hatches and chooses a rider for itself, a young farmhand named Eragon (Edward Speelers).  Mentored by a veteran of the old war, Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon and the dragon Saphira embark on a quest to find and join one of the last pockets of resistance against Galbatorix.This has got everything you want in a fantasy movie - likable heroes, a courageous and gorgeous princess (Ayra, played by Sienna Guillory), awesome creatures, an engaging story, breath-taking action, dashes of appropriate humor, fantastic visuals (both with the special effects and the natural lands the show takes place in) and a richly realized world that feels real.  A lot has been made of similarities between ""Eragon"" and movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord Of The Rings"".  It's true that there are similarities, but it isn't a clone of a previous movie.  In any given summer, there are probably close to a dozen conventional action movies that have more in common with each other (and some of these are really good movies; I'm not saying they all stink) than ""Eragon"" does to its like-themed movies.  I guess to a lot of viewers the similarities between fantastic elements like dragons and sorcery stand out more than similarities between things like car chases that end with both cars crashing and the chase continuing on foot, climatic gun battles, cop partners who hate each other at first but end up best friends, and nearly identical cocaine-smuggling scenarios.  I think it's a shame that ""Eragon"" gets judged so harshly for having points-in-common with ""Lord Of The Rings"" and all, when all it's done is use some classic elements to build a new, and totally invigorating movie.  This is the kind of movie I wouldn't mind seeing more of, and it's without question a top pick for fantasy and adventure lovers.  10/10",5,A Masterpiece Of Fantasy And Adventure; Every Bit As Good As Lord Of The Rings,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,2554,"['Eragon', 'one', 'most', 'recent', 'entries', 'currently', 'booming', 'field', 'high-caliber', 'fantasy', 'epics', 'theme', 'moviemaking', 'fairly', 'recently', 'had', 'rely', 'very', 'infrequent', 'rate', 'new', 'live-action', 'films', 'had', 'slew', 'great', 'anime', 'titles', 'banner', 'years', 'years', 'dragon-lover', 'dream', 'film', 'Eragon', 'place', 'vast', 'mythical', 'land', 'once', 'protected', 'heroic', 'pairs', 'dragons', 'dragonriders', 'lifetimes', 'characters', 'status', 'quo', 'was', 'destroyed', 'rogue', 'dragonrider', 'Galbatorix', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'recruited', 'sorcerors', 'army', 'destroy', 'dragons', 'install', 'absolute', 'ruler', 'focus', 'movie', 'new', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'first', 'new', 'dragon', 'be', 'born', 'years', 'hatches', 'rider', 'young', 'farmhand', 'named', 'Eragon', 'Edward', 'Speelers', 'Mentored', 'veteran', 'old', 'war', 'Brom', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Eragon', 'dragon', 'Saphira', 'embark', 'quest', 'find', 'join', 'one', 'last', 'pockets', 'resistance', 'Galbatorix.This', 'got', 'everything', 'want', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'likable', 'heroes', 'courageous', 'gorgeous', 'princess', 'Ayra', 'played', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'awesome', 'creatures', 'engaging', 'story', 'breath-taking', 'action', 'dashes', 'appropriate', 'humor', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'special', 'effects', 'natural', 'show', 'place', 'richly', 'realized', 'world', 'real', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'similarities', 'Eragon', 'movies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'true', 'are', 'similarities', ""n't"", 'clone', 'previous', 'movie', 'given', 'summer', 'are', 'probably', 'close', 'dozen', 'conventional', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'other', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'stink', 'Eragon', 'like-themed', 'movies', 'guess', 'lot', 'viewers', 'similarities', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'dragons', 'sorcery', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'similarities', 'things', 'car', 'chases', 'end', 'cars', 'crashing', 'chase', 'continuing', 'foot', 'climatic', 'gun', 'battles', 'cop', 'partners', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'first', 'end', 'up', 'best', 'friends', 'nearly', 'identical', 'cocaine-smuggling', 'scenarios', 'think', 'shame', 'Eragon', 'judged', 'so', 'harshly', 'having', 'points-in-common', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'when', 'done', 'use', 'classic', 'elements', 'build', 'new', 'totally', 'invigorating', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'question', 'top', 'pick', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'lovers', '10/10']",N/A

1055523,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000NA28HU,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[4, 7]","Ok, I knew going in that ERAGON was a poorly received film.  I have found that surprisingly often, such poorly reviewed films end up being not half bad.  Unfrotunately, this is not the case here.  ERAGON was every bit as weak as it was criticized for being.Now, I know nothing about the acclaimed books, so I can't speak to the original story.  But as a film screenplay, this is derivative stuff of the highest order!  Let me describe the plot - farm boy orphan lives with uncle and discovers a secret that a dark ruler in a distant land will kill for - then he realizes he has mystical powers and leads a band of rebels against the army of the dark ruler.  Sound familiar?  It should - its the plot of the original STAR WARS - its the plot of LORD OF THE RINGS!Now to be fair, as I cited in my title, the hero myth is largely similar in just about every film.  Hero leaves home to go on quest, returns home a different person.  No one expects a REINVENTION of the hero myth - the trick to hero tales is in the nuance and flair with which the writer/director adapts the myth to their own story.  And in the movie ERGAON, there is no flair at all.  It's as if the screenwriters sat down with Campbell's HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES and started the checklist:""OK, main character's a farm boy . . . check . . . farm boys caretaker is killed, leaving him no option to stay home . . . check . . . farm boy has an unrealized gift, in this case, magic . . . check . . . ""With the familiar strains of the movie playing from start to finish, I left fully convinced that the sequel will reveal the dark king is really Eragon's father!  SHUDDER!A derivative story can still be overcome . . . if you have interesting characters.  Sadly, Eragon falls short here as well.  By the twenty minute mark, Eragon is already flying away on his fully formed dragon to start the battle, which means we had no time to learn about him or his people, which means we don't really care about them and their fate.  We don't even get to know his mentor Obi Wan Ken . . . I mean Brom, who was also once a Jedi Kni . . . I mean Dragon Rider.All we know is that prior to the movie, Darth Vad . . . I mean Galbatorix, who was a Jedi Kni . . . I mean Dragon Rider himself turned on his fellow Jedi Kn . . . erm, Dragon Riders and killed them all.  But Luke Sky . . . that is, Eragon, receives the plans for the Death Star . . . I mean the Dragon Egg from Princess Leia . . . whoops, I meant Arya, thereby ensuring A NEW HOPE for the Rebellion Forces . . . I mean the Valden.At any rate, characters come and go throughout, but are never given anything interesting to say about themselves.  Every line of dialogue advances the story, with ZERO room for character growth.  So when we finally reach the climatic battle, I care not one whit about who won.The only bright spot is the Shade, played quite well by Robert Carlyle.  His brief scenes manage to save the film from being a total loss.As far as the effects, well, they really are quite excellent.  From flying, to fire, to magic arrow - everything looked pretty flawless.  The final duel between Eragon and the Shade astride their dragons made me forget for the briefest of moments that the film was mostly dragon dung.  Unfortunately, the scene came to its end and all that was left was the obligatory reminder that there is much more story to tell - just wait for ERAGON II - The Empire (oops, I mean King Albatorix) Strikes Back!",1,"You can almost see the writers, one eye on the script, the other on Joseph Campbell's HERO WITH  A THOUSAND FACES!",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,3448,"['Ok', 'knew', 'going', 'ERAGON', 'was', 'poorly', 'received', 'film', 'have', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'often', 'such', 'poorly', 'reviewed', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'Unfrotunately', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'ERAGON', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'weak', 'was', 'criticized', 'being.Now', 'know', 'nothing', 'acclaimed', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'screenplay', 'derivative', 'stuff', 'highest', 'order', 'Let', 'describe', 'plot', 'farm', 'boy', 'orphan', 'uncle', 'secret', 'dark', 'ruler', 'distant', 'land', 'will', 'kill', 'then', 'mystical', 'powers', 'band', 'rebels', 'army', 'dark', 'ruler', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'plot', 'original', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'plot', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'Now', 'be', 'fair', 'cited', 'title', 'hero', 'myth', 'largely', 'similar', 'just', 'film', 'Hero', 'home', 'go', 'quest', 'home', 'different', 'person', 'one', 'REINVENTION', 'hero', 'myth', 'trick', 'hero', 'tales', 'nuance', 'flair', 'writer/director', 'myth', 'own', 'story', 'movie', 'ERGAON', 'flair', 'screenwriters', 'sat', 'down', 'Campbell', 'HERO', 'WITH', 'A', 'THOUSAND', 'FACES', 'started', 'checklist', 'OK', 'main', 'character', 'farm', 'boy', 'check', 'farm', 'boys', 'caretaker', 'killed', 'leaving', 'option', 'stay', 'home', 'check', 'farm', 'boy', 'unrealized', 'gift', 'case', 'magic', 'check', 'familiar', 'strains', 'movie', 'playing', 'start', 'finish', 'left', 'fully', 'convinced', 'sequel', 'will', 'reveal', 'dark', 'king', 'really', 'Eragon', 'father', 'SHUDDER', 'derivative', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'overcome', 'have', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Sadly', 'Eragon', 'short', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'twenty', 'minute', 'mark', 'Eragon', 'already', 'flying', 'away', 'fully', 'formed', 'dragon', 'start', 'battle', 'had', 'time', 'learn', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'fate', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'know', 'mentor', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Ken', 'mean', 'Brom', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'once', 'Jedi', 'Kni', 'mean', 'Dragon', 'Rider.All', 'know', 'prior', 'movie', 'Darth', 'Vad', 'mean', 'Galbatorix', 'who', 'was', 'Jedi', 'Kni', 'mean', 'Dragon', 'Rider', 'turned', 'fellow', 'Jedi', 'Kn', 'erm', 'Dragon', 'Riders', 'killed', 'Luke', 'Sky', 'Eragon', 'plans', 'Death', 'Star', 'mean', 'Dragon', 'Egg', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'whoops', 'meant', 'Arya', 'thereby', 'ensuring', 'A', 'NEW', 'HOPE', 'Rebellion', 'Forces', 'mean', 'Valden.At', 'rate', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'line', 'dialogue', 'advances', 'story', 'ZERO', 'room', 'character', 'growth', 'So', 'when', 'finally', 'reach', 'climatic', 'battle', 'care', 'not', 'one', 'whit', 'who', 'won.The', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Shade', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'brief', 'scenes', 'manage', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'total', 'loss.As', 'far', 'effects', 'well', 'really', 'are', 'quite', 'excellent', 'flying', 'fire', 'magic', 'arrow', 'everything', 'looked', 'pretty', 'flawless', 'final', 'duel', 'Eragon', 'Shade', 'astride', 'dragons', 'made', 'forget', 'briefest', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'dragon', 'dung', 'Unfortunately', 'scene', 'came', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'obligatory', 'reminder', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'tell', 'just', 'wait', 'ERAGON', 'II', 'Empire', 'oops', 'mean', 'King', 'Albatorix', 'Strikes', 'Back']",N/A

1055525,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000NA28HU,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 8]","A respectable cast, visually striking, ambitious film that fails to deliver on what could have been something of a masterpiece.Without having known in advance that the author was so young, I did find the book heavily influenced by both the written and screen work of LOTR as well asDragonslayerand written in a rather amateurish fashion.  Don't get me wrong; I highly commend this young author for being able to even get a book publish in this very competitive market and he does have talent, but it's rather raw and overly visual (he may make a better screenwriter).  This is why I think Hollywood failed to do justice to his work.This was a picturesque novel with some very traditional themes that should have translated well to the big screen.  Some striking visuals are present in the film, but not what I had hoped for or expected following the LOTR saga.  The actors are all fine, especially newcomer Edward Speleers, and  Rachel Weisz whose voice is captivating and sexy as Saphira.  Jeremy Irons is always a pleasure to have on hand, but he does look a bit bored with his role that is all too familiar.  I expect him to yell out at any moment ""May the force be with you.""  John Malkovich has played so many Hollywood baddies these days that at this point he seems to be mocking those roles now.  I almost expect him to wink at the camera after delivering an evil cliche-ridden line.The pacing is probably the biggest flaw in this film.  My kids, 11 and 15, were rather bored with it.  They would be momentarily enthralled with the action sequences and visual effects, but then walk off to get a drink or something until the music keyed in another action scene.  The story failed to hold them as they have seen better work in this genre and therein lies the films other fatal flaw.The original work that this film is based upon is somewhat weak in of itself.  It lacks depth and maturity, but certainly hints at better things to come from this author.  It's hard to take a so-so work and make a successful film from it, although it can be done.  In addition, it is even harder to so with a work that is obviously very influenced by far greater works.  Still, I think Hollywood blew this one.Hollywood is capable of improving upon the written word at times and especially with more visual novels.  Some average visual books (IMO) that became great films areJaws,The Great Train Robbery,Moby Dick, and the Harry Potter films which I think are actually better than the unnecessarily bloated novels upon which they are based (now don't start throwing rocks at me).  And, yes, you read right aboutMoby-Dick.  It is considered a classic and for good reason, but that doesn't mean it isn't filled with way too much blubber.In any event, my point is that Hollywood missed an opportunity to rework the weak aspects of a generally good tale and squandered the talents of those within this film.  The film is just okay.  It soars every once in awhile, but feels ponderous and bloated with self-importance at other times.  It's watchable, but not all that enjoyable or memorable.",3,An ambitious disappointment.,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,3074,"['respectable', 'cast', 'visually', 'striking', 'ambitious', 'film', 'deliver', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'masterpiece.Without', 'having', 'known', 'advance', 'author', 'was', 'so', 'young', 'did', 'find', 'book', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'written', 'screen', 'work', 'LOTR', 'well', 'asDragonslayerand', 'written', 'rather', 'amateurish', 'fashion', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'highly', 'commend', 'young', 'author', 'being', 'able', 'even', 'get', 'book', 'publish', 'very', 'competitive', 'market', 'have', 'talent', 'rather', 'raw', 'overly', 'visual', 'may', 'make', 'better', 'screenwriter', 'why', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'failed', 'do', 'justice', 'work.This', 'was', 'picturesque', 'novel', 'very', 'traditional', 'themes', 'should', 'have', 'translated', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'striking', 'visuals', 'are', 'present', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'expected', 'following', 'LOTR', 'saga', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'especially', 'newcomer', 'Edward', 'Speleers', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'voice', 'captivating', 'sexy', 'Saphira', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'always', 'pleasure', 'have', 'hand', 'look', 'bit', 'bored', 'role', 'too', 'familiar', 'expect', 'yell', 'out', 'moment', 'May', 'force', 'be', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'baddies', 'days', 'point', 'be', 'mocking', 'roles', 'now', 'almost', 'expect', 'wink', 'camera', 'delivering', 'evil', 'cliche-ridden', 'line.The', 'pacing', 'probably', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'kids', '11', '15', 'were', 'rather', 'bored', 'would', 'be', 'momentarily', 'enthralled', 'action', 'sequences', 'visual', 'effects', 'then', 'walk', 'off', 'get', 'drink', 'something', 'music', 'keyed', 'action', 'scene', 'story', 'failed', 'hold', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'work', 'genre', 'therein', 'films', 'other', 'fatal', 'flaw.The', 'original', 'work', 'film', 'based', 'upon', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'depth', 'maturity', 'certainly', 'hints', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'author', 'hard', 'take', 'so-so', 'work', 'make', 'successful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'addition', 'even', 'harder', 'so', 'work', 'obviously', 'very', 'influenced', 'far', 'greater', 'works', 'Still', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'blew', 'one.Hollywood', 'capable', 'improving', 'written', 'word', 'times', 'especially', 'more', 'visual', 'novels', 'average', 'visual', 'books', 'IMO', 'became', 'great', 'films', 'areJaws', 'Great', 'Train', 'Robbery', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'think', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'unnecessarily', 'bloated', 'novels', 'are', 'based', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'throwing', 'rocks', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'aboutMoby-Dick', 'considered', 'classic', 'good', 'reason', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'filled', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'event', 'point', 'Hollywood', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'rework', 'weak', 'aspects', 'generally', 'good', 'tale', 'squandered', 'talents', 'film', 'film', 'just', 'okay', 'once', 'awhile', 'feels', 'ponderous', 'bloated', 'self-importance', 'other', 'times', 'watchable', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'memorable']",N/A

I could go on about utterly ridiculous tangents in the movie that didn't happen in the book.  For example - King Galbatrax?  He is only referred to in the first two books, though I imagine we'll finally meet the character in the final book - but, no, let's get John Malkovich in for what was probably a one-day shoot for him and have him chew scenery rather than using the 10-15 minutes of combined shots to say, ya know, follow the actual plot.  Nope, instead, let's skip entire things from the book, including the difficulties of raising a dragon.  Hell no!  Let's instead have some ridiculous lightning effects that has the newly flying, dog sized dragon, mirculously reach full growth in a few minutes.Let's give the dragon the voice of Rachael Weisz (The Mummy, The Fountain, etc.).  Don't get me wrong, I like her work, but it JUST DIDN'T Work.  As for Jeremy Irons, I would see just about anything to hear his silky voice.  If anything, he spent less time in this movie than he did in The Time Machine (which was about ten minutes of time).  Under-utilized is an understatement.I could go on and on.

1055542,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NA28HU,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","OK, as many reviewers on the net have already pointed out, the plot of `Eragon' resembles some of the more famous epic stories in such films as `Star Wars' (I'm talking about Episode IV). But I suspect that is not really the real problem of `Eragon.' You should remember that George Lucas actually borrowed from Kurosawa's masterpiece `Hidden Fortress' when he wrote the story of the Princess, the Warriors, and two comic relief. The difference is that Lucas created the characters that almost instantly became cultural icons every one can relate to - Who can forget the `conversations' of R2-D2 and C-3PO?`Eragon' has promising start when we are introduced to the dragon named Saphira. Rachel Weisz effectively provides the voice of this newly-born dragon, who quickly grows to be much wiser than its `rider' Eragon (Edward Speleers), young farm boy who happened to discover the dragon's egg. The egg was in fact stolen from King Galbatorix (scenery-chewing John Malkovich) who orders Durza (Robert Carlyle) to take it back no matter what it takes.Well, I think this is a pretty good story. I don't see originality here. but not that bad. However, director Stefen Fangmeier (formerly visual effects supervisor for `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' and others) misses every opportunity to let us know the film's characters on the screen. If the film's story says the egg was stolen from the evil king, presenting a bit more actions (and information) about Arya (Sienna Guillory) would not hurt. It would give us more vivid pictures of the fantasy world by showing more of this beautiful fighter, but the film just forgets it. Or how about Eragon's mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons) who says he knows much about dragons and dragon riders? I do not doubt his mumbling words, but he could have used and showed better tricks than just words and sword-fighting with wood sticks to prove his knowledge.The only thing we are sure of is that the young hero is a good boy but still immature, even arrogant sometimes. That's OK as long as his motives are reasonable and consistent. Apparently the director didn't think that way. While watching, we are often at a loss as to the mission or the purpose of his journey, having few clues as to what he realy wants to (or has to) do. Magic spells are cast all too sudden, rather haphazardly. Geography of the world is not clear, and worst of all it seems as if Eragon himself is causing some of the troubles (and their serious consequences). But we are required to take side of him while he doesn't know what he is doing.CGI of the film is nothing great, if not bad. The images of the flying dragon(s) are good, but its facial expressions need improvement. The lack of more convincing dragon's face may be forgiven in other films, but not in this where the relation between the dragon and the dragon rider plays a significant role in the plot.I expected more from `Eragon' because I like films about fantasy world. Yes, while watching Jeremy Irons in ragged coat, I was reminded of Obi-Wan and Jedi Master, but that didn't bother me a lot.

1055543,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000NA28HU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth. Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin. They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders. The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders. He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way. Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom. In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza. Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone. Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it. It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes. The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider. Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it. Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains. The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly. Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos. Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie. The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made. Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine? That scene is in this movie. Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke? That scene is in this movie, too.Another problem with the film is the pacing. The entire movie runs about ninety minutes. I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended. Many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel. The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture. A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate. It shouldn't be rushed. I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon. Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been. I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could. An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month. Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed.

However, my son (13) and I have read the books and it just falls miserably FLAT!!First off, Arya has red hair and no pointy elf ears!!  She acts and feels too young and flighty the whole movie.  Secondly, right from the beginning there are King's soldiers in Carvahall where Eragon lives -- not ever in the book and for very good reasons!!  Next, Saphira does not have beautiful gem like scales and membrane on her wings -- she has snake-like skin and feathers??  Also, instead of showing Eragon taking her and making her nest in the woods and feeding her and then maybe a speeded up part to show over a few months how fast she grows, the director has Saphira take off thrown into the sky by Eragon when quite small (4-5 feet long from head to tail) and then magically in the sky she grows and comes down full-sized!!  This was NOT just a device -- this was it as no seasons changed, etc.  And finally, for me, the worst part was that Galbatorix and Durza are trying to KILL Eragon and Saphira instead of capture!!  In the book as made sense, Galbatorix wanted to capture Eragon and Saphira and turn them to HIS side.  That for me is just a major issue.Now what was good?  If you haven't read the book, the darkness of the village and Urgals.  The flights of Eragon on Saphira were very cool and the final battle.If you haven't read the books, I recommend it as a fun movie!!If you have read the books, wait for the DVD.Oh and Christopher Paolini?

The adventure story is classic: the evil tyrant, the secret cabal of rebels just waiting to strike for freedom, the young hero-to-be, unknown even to himself. Dragons are cool, especially when they're done as well as they are here. The castworks pretty well, too, with Jeremy Irons as the mysterious mentor and Sienna Guillory as the magical princess in need of rescue. Her slight resemblance to Tilda Swinton is a minor but enjoyable benefit to the role.The story, written by a 15 year old prodigy, has plenty of excitement - but that's about it.

1055551,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B000NA28HU,Wm19,"[14, 17]","I read a few chapters of the book, then stopped because the dialogue was so dull. I figured the movie would be better.  Well, the movie seemed like a teenage boy's simple idea of fantasy.  Dragons and their riders were killed many years ago and an evil king took over the kingdom. All hope is gone, for there are no more dragons or dragonriders. A young (17-year-old) farmboy named Eragon finds a stone.  The stone hatches a helpless baby dragon. Unbelievably, a few days later, the dragon has a telepathic voice, is quite huge, and loyal as a dog. Eragon is just a farmboy, he doesn't want to be a grand rider. Brom, a uncle-like storyteller, teaches Eragon a few snippets about being a dragon-rider. Brom and Eragon flee the farm, chased by evil bad guys. Watching the movie was just like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, David Edding's Belgarion series - a young farmboy has a destiny (here, a dragon), and a mysterious old man teaches him the ways of life while they flee the bad guys.Eragon is lauded throughout the whole movie as a destined hero, but I thought he seemed outright stupid. Eragon is bonded to the last dragon in the world. If a dragonrider is killed, his dragon dies too. Eragon is also a farmboy who can't fight. Yet Eragon keeps on rebelling against the wise Brom and running to fight evil Urgals who can kill him (and therefore his dragon) in a heartbeat. Then Eragon gets a dream from a captured elf (a young teenage girl who looks like any human, except she wears feathers in her hair) and of course, he runs out to rescue her and imperils his dragon. Brom tries to get Eragon to understand how important it is that Eragon stays alive so the last dragon stays alive too, but Eragon has no head for strategy and only knows that he is smart and strong enough to save this girl from whatever unknown is holding her. Talk about overconfident and stupid. He should at least try to learn more about his enemy before literally walking into his lair.Eragon is actually quite annoying.  He's disrespectful, ignorant, selfishly reckless and can't see beyond the end of his nose. He is really, really cocky.  Once Eragon is on his own, he overacts like he's a confident 30-year old leader and only then, after the fact, does he start to talk respectfully of Brom. Eragon is also annoying in his patriarchal attitude towards his dragon. At one point, his dragon tries to reason with him, and his response is, ""I'm the rider, and I say we go"". Hence, they go. Hm, arrogant and treats his dragon like property?  The entire story is populated by evil goons, middle-aged men, a dragon, Eragon, and two teenage beauties (of course).  Both teenage girls are the tanned, sweaty, heavy make-up, super-skinny kind, with bony faces like you'd see on a magazine cover. Aren't elves supposed to look ethereal or at least not quite human?The scenery is beautiful, very mountainous and vast. The hardest part of the movie was the dialogue; it was very inane. Perhaps the cheesiest line was, ""...into the sky...to win or to die!"". There's no humour or interesting conversation between any characters. There's little to no camaraderie. Eragon is annoying and has no manners (he gets a nice set of armour or someone saves his life, and he doesn't even say thanks!). He'd be a lot more interesting if he showed any humility. Either he's rebelling against being a rider or he's confident that he can take on anyone. If he were smarter, he'd be training with his dragon on how to be a better fighter on horseback, or practicing his swordplay. The story relies on the natural-born ability theory of power. Eragon doesn't need to practice riding maneouvres/swordplay/magic - it just comes naturally to him because he's the chosen one! Unlike Luke Skywalker, Frodo and Belgarion, Eragon doesn't really try to improve his skills, because of course, he was born with what he needs - or so the movie suggests.  Once Eragon realizes he can use magic, Brom tells him to use it as a last resort, and of course, being a good listener,  Eragon uses magic over and over again.  The intelligent, telepathic dragon sounds like a loyal dog with very little personality or assertiveness with her rider - she meekly does what he tells her to do. The evil king doesn't sound evil at all (he has a very ordinary-joe voice). Over all, I'd have to give it 2 stars for the scenery and computer generated dragon.  The hero was ignorant, arrogant and had no manners, the dragon wasn't treated like an equal, and the dialogue was terrible.
