Face it, nobody who is alive today ever spoke to Lincoln or heard him speak.  We have a certain amount of information from his contemporaries, along with a massive amount of his writings, but as to dialogue, the record does not stand up to an awful lot of conversation in the five hours of drama presented in this two disk set.Having said that, let me qualify the criticism by saying that I didn't see much in this presentation that seemed unreal or unlikely to me.  We know a lot about Lincoln and the people who were around him during his presidency, and I found this dramatic presentation quite enjoyable.  I'll have to say that I think the appearance of most of the supporting actors was very poorly done.  The only one I recognized without hearing his name spoken by one of the other characters was Edwin Stanton.For those who have not bought or seen this portrayal of Lincoln's years in the White House, the 2 disk set is definitely worth the price.  It focuses much more on the emancipation proclamation than on the Civil War, and demonstrates as well as it can both the support for, and the resistance to, Lincoln's determination to both hold the Union together and also honor the belief that ""all men are created equal.""From a personal standpoint, having read much about Lincoln, the Civil War and other persons involved in both the war and government of that time, this is probably as close as we're going to get to sharing the events of those turbulent years.",4,Interesting and enjoyable,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1632,"['usually', 'avoid', 'dramatic', 'representations', 'historical', 'persons', 'events', 'so', 'much', 'necessarily', 'fictional', ""'m"", 'talking', 'conversations', 'Face', 'nobody', 'who', 'alive', 'today', 'ever', 'spoke', 'Lincoln', 'heard', 'speak', 'have', 'certain', 'amount', 'information', 'contemporaries', 'massive', 'amount', 'writings', 'dialogue', 'record', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'awful', 'lot', 'conversation', 'five', 'hours', 'drama', 'presented', 'two', 'disk', 'set.Having', 'said', 'let', 'qualify', 'criticism', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'presentation', 'seemed', 'unreal', 'unlikely', 'know', 'lot', 'Lincoln', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'presidency', 'found', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'quite', 'enjoyable', ""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'think', 'appearance', 'most', 'supporting', 'actors', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'only', 'one', 'recognized', 'hearing', 'name', 'spoken', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'was', 'Edwin', 'Stanton.For', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'bought', 'seen', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'years', 'White', 'House', '2', 'disk', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', 'much', 'more', 'emancipation', 'proclamation', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'both', 'support', 'resistance', 'Lincoln', 'determination', 'hold', 'Union', 'together', 'also', 'honor', 'belief', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'equal', 'personal', 'standpoint', 'having', 'read', 'much', 'Lincoln', 'Civil', 'War', 'other', 'persons', 'involved', 'war', 'government', 'time', 'probably', 'as', 'close', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'sharing', 'events', 'turbulent', 'years']",Sandburg's Lincoln

1434245,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B004Z2ECX0,Steven Hancock,"[26, 28]","Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, has been portrayed on film more than any other historical figure in American history. From the silent films of 1911, to the upcoming Spielberg movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Lincoln has been on film well over two-hundred and sixty times. There have been many great actors in the role, including Sam Waterston (inGore Vidal's Lincoln, which I feel presents the definitive screen Lincoln), and Gregory Peck (inThe Blue and the Gray). One of the few actors to portray him in more than one different film or miniseries has been Hal Holbrook. I first saw him portray Lincoln in Books One and two of the MiniseriesNorth and South. There, Holbrook gave a warm and wonderful portrayal of Honest Abe. But I did not know that those two miniseries were not his first time portraying the character. That came eleven years before in this six-part miniseries from 1974, the first of its kind at the time.Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Carl Sandburg, this miniseries presents a really strong portrayal of Lincoln. From his time as a Prairie Lawyer, to his last days as President of the United States, Holbrook shows a wonderful range as Lincoln, capturing his sense of funny storytelling, his strong emotions when confronted with death, and his strong determination to win the war at all costs. The supporting cast does a fantastic job as well. But when one approaches this series, be aware that it is not a straightforward story being told chronologically. The story shifts from various points of Lincoln's life and Presidency from one episode to the other. It is best to be viewed as a series of ""vignettes"" that take a look at certain aspects of the story of Lincoln. And it does seem that trying to view it in any sort of chronological order will be nearly impossible. Nevertheless, this is a fine look at the life and Presidency of one of America's greatest leaders.

Even though this is an older production, it still captures what many of the other films have left out including his early years before his presidency.  Lincoln's wit and charm are masterfully captured by Holbrook's performance like none of the other films I have seen.The only problem, which has already been noted by others, is the episodes are out of order on the two discs.  I was confused when ""Mrs. Lincoln's Husband"" had them in the White House then the episode following it, ""Prairie Lawyer"" shows Lincoln prior to moving to the White House.  Sometimes Lincoln will be seen with or without the beard so it's a little puzzling.Overall, I believe this is one of the best films depicting Lincoln.  I didn't experience severe color problems as others reported.  The film showed its age, but nothing significant.  I did discover that the discs do not play well in Analog DVD Dual Layer recorders which I own.  After finally purchasing a new Blue Ray DVD player, it played perfectly with no problems.I highly recommend especially to those who think the 2012 version of Lincoln was amazing.",5,A Classic Lincoln,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1201,"['Hal', 'Holbrook', 'amazing', 'Lincoln', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'shines', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'classic', 'mini-series', 'Even', 'older', 'production', 'still', 'what', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'including', 'early', 'years', 'presidency', 'Lincoln', 'wit', 'charm', 'are', 'masterfully', 'captured', 'Holbrook', 'performance', 'none', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'seen.The', 'only', 'problem', 'already', 'been', 'noted', 'others', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'two', 'discs', 'was', 'confused', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln', 'Husband', 'had', 'White', 'House', 'then', 'episode', 'following', 'Prairie', 'Lawyer', 'Lincoln', 'prior', 'moving', 'White', 'House', 'Sometimes', 'Lincoln', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'beard', 'little', 'puzzling.Overall', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'depicting', 'Lincoln', 'did', ""n't"", 'experience', 'severe', 'color', 'problems', 'others', 'reported', 'film', 'showed', 'age', 'nothing', 'significant', 'did', 'discover', 'discs', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'well', 'Analog', 'DVD', 'Dual', 'Layer', 'recorders', 'own', 'finally', 'purchasing', 'new', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'player', 'played', 'perfectly', 'problems.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'who', 'think', '2012', 'version', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'amazing']",Sandburg's Lincoln
1434248,AHO60TMP4EZQN,B004Z2ECX0,William Nash,"[5, 7]","I had never seen the mini-series Sandburg's Lincoln. It first aired in 1974. I'm 38 years overdue on this! Just recently, it became available on DVD. I don't even own a VHS player anymore. Anyway, I had heard over the years how good Hal Holbrook played Lincoln. Many said his is the best of all portrayals of Lincoln. When I saw the picture on the cover of the DVD set I had my doubts. The picture doesn't do justice to Holbrook as Lincoln. Holbrook's face looks too fat to me. However, once I started watching the movie I was blown away! If ever any actor nailed the looks of Abraham Lincoln-it has got to be Holbrook!While watching Hal Holbrook as Lincoln it struck me in a way that I had not realized before-just how homely Abraham Lincoln really was! This has been talked about before. We have gotten used to seeing images of Lincoln and don't give his looks much thought. However, when watching Holbrook as Lincoln move about as he does in the film-it brings the looks out in a way a still picture doesn't. The make-up people did a masterful job in creating Lincoln out of Holbrook. I couldn't believe how large Lincoln's ears were. Forgive me I love Lincoln-but I can see why McClellan called him a gorilla. Lincoln, himself, knew he was not a handsome man.More than that, Holbrook captures Lincoln in other ways. No wonder his performance earned him an Emmy. He is brilliant. I just watched the movie with my eyes glued to Holbrook studying his moves, mannerisms, and reactions to things. The deathbed scene of Willie Lincoln is very moving. Silently, Lincoln walks out of the room where Willie has died. Lincoln says nothing. He is barely holding back from crying out in emotional pain. A tear is noticed streaking down his cheek. Other scenes are just as powerful. There's also Lincoln the husband. It is plain the Abraham and Mary love each other very much. Lincoln expresses guilt that he has brought pain into Mary's life by bringing her to Washington. Their affection is often warm and wonderful to watch. By all means, purchase this set!",5,Hal Holbrook as Lincoln is stunning!,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,2051,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'mini-series', 'Sandburg', 'Lincoln', 'first', 'aired', '1974', ""'m"", '38', 'years', 'overdue', 'Just', 'recently', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'own', 'VHS', 'player', 'anymore', 'Anyway', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'how', 'good', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'played', 'Lincoln', 'Many', 'said', 'best', 'portrayals', 'Lincoln', 'When', 'saw', 'picture', 'cover', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'doubts', 'picture', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Holbrook', 'Lincoln', 'Holbrook', 'face', 'too', 'fat', 'However', 'once', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'ever', 'actor', 'nailed', 'looks', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln-it', 'got', 'be', 'Holbrook', 'watching', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Lincoln', 'struck', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'realized', 'before-just', 'how', 'homely', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'really', 'was', 'been', 'talked', 'before', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'seeing', 'images', 'Lincoln', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'looks', 'much', 'thought', 'However', 'when', 'watching', 'Holbrook', 'Lincoln', 'move', 'about', 'film-it', 'looks', 'out', 'way', 'still', 'picture', ""n't"", 'make-up', 'people', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'creating', 'Lincoln', 'Holbrook', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'large', 'Lincoln', 'ears', 'were', 'love', 'Lincoln-but', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'McClellan', 'called', 'gorilla', 'Lincoln', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'handsome', 'man.More', 'Holbrook', 'Lincoln', 'other', 'ways', 'wonder', 'performance', 'earned', 'Emmy', 'brilliant', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'eyes', 'glued', 'Holbrook', 'studying', 'moves', 'mannerisms', 'reactions', 'things', 'deathbed', 'scene', 'Willie', 'Lincoln', 'very', 'moving', 'Silently', 'Lincoln', 'room', 'where', 'Willie', 'died', 'Lincoln', 'nothing', 'barely', 'holding', 'back', 'crying', 'out', 'emotional', 'pain', 'tear', 'noticed', 'streaking', 'down', 'cheek', 'Other', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'powerful', 'also', 'Lincoln', 'husband', 'plain', 'Abraham', 'Mary', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'Lincoln', 'guilt', 'brought', 'pain', 'Mary', 'life', 'bringing', 'Washington', 'affection', 'often', 'warm', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'means', 'purchase', 'set']",Sandburg's Lincoln
