292172,A14JWF5U4EB6DY,630203535X,"geatornez82 ""Cartoon Connoisseur""","[28, 31]","I taped this movie from the Disney Channel, but my sister taped over my copy of it. This isn't the greatest MLP cartoon in the bunch (my favorites are ""Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape from Catrina""), but this one still had it's moments.The Witches from the Volcano of Gloom create the Smooze to destroy the Little Ponies and their spring festival, so they have to go get the Rainbow of Light, but it ends up buried in the Smooze, and they have to go find the Flutter Ponies. Also, some of the other ponies search for Baby Lickety Split who has run away, with Spike the Dragon.PROS:The music and the songs are really good, I think. One of the best song numbers is ""I'll Do the Dirty Work"" sung by Reeka and Draggle. Every time I see this routine, I crack up, along with ""Nothing Can Stop the Smooze"" with the Smooze doing a little 1950's doo wop riff while the witches are singing. Another great song was ""There's Always Another Rainbow."" Not funny like the other two I mentioned, but still a great song.The Moochick and his rabbit cracked me up. I love Tony Randall's voice of the Moochick better than whoever did him in the MLP TV series. It just seems funnier to me.Any scene with the Grundles, especially when the Grundle King mentions Grundleland.Keep your eyes open during any scene with Reeka and Draggle. You'll find little surprises along the way.CONS (reasons why I give this a 4 rather than a 5):A lot of the scene changes were a bit choppy and seemed to come so fast.The paint job on this seemed a bit washed out.Baby Lickety Split was a brat, and I didn't like Gusty's personality all that much, even BEFORE she got Smoozed.I didn't particularly care for Buttons's, Lofty's, Baby Lickety Split's, or Sundance's voices. Having seen the MLP TV series before this movie, I think that explains it.The end of the ""I'll Go it Alone"" song, because the animation was a little odd there.In some scenes, there are ponies that aren't supposed to be there, and they mysteriously disappear later. Something comman in the TV series, too.But other than the cons, this is a great movie. It's really very cute!

292177,A1HUFWL01E94C5,630203535X,Lauren Rodriguez,"[9, 11]","Hi there!! I hope everyone is doing well.  I LOVE this movie and the TV Series.  I used to watch it all the time when I was little and I'm now twenty and still LOVE it.Summary:  The witches from the volcano of gloom want to destroy the ponies spring festival, so they create the Smooze to devour ponyland.  Baby Lickety Split runs away after Buttons yells at her, and she is accompanied by Spike, a baby dragon.  They meet the Grundles who help them find their way back to Dream Castle.Meanwhile, The smooze has gotten Gusty, who is very upset and Wind Whistler suggests they go to Megan for help.  Upon arriving at Megan's house, they meet Megan's little sister, Molly, who is seven and Danny, Megan's younger brother who is ten.  Molly is riding Megan's old pony, TJ, and successfully jumps a bail of hay with Megan snapping a picture proudly.  After the picture is taken, Wind Whistler explains the situation and Megan insists to help.  Danny wants to help too, as does Molly, who is very close to Megan and doesn't want to be left out.  They return to ponyland where the other little ponies are introduced to Molly and Danny.  Fizzy, who is a fun loving, easy going unicorn, takes to Molly instantly and vowels to take care of her for Megan.  Megan and the little ponies rush off to seek the Moochick's help after the smooze traps the Rainbow of Light and covers Dream Castle.  The Moochick tells them they need the help of the Flutter ponies who live in Flutter Valley.  He also gives them a new home, Paradise Estate.  After Megan who is accompanied by Fizzy and Wind Whistler, leave the Moochick, they return to Dream Castle to pick up the other little ponies, as well as Molly and Danny.  Molly hops on Fizzy, and Danny hops on Surprise.  After Megan hops on Wind Whistler they're off.I don't want to give away anymore, but the movie ends on a very sweet and uplifting note.Proes:The movie teaches valuable lessons about faith and family and it also shows you more of Megan's home life and her family.  It shows that she will do anything and everything to protect Molly and Danny, along with the little ponies.  It also shows her being more stern with Molly and Danny when they fight, which I think is good considering, Megan was portrayed in the other two movies as being an only child and not very confident in herself, but with a sweet and nice personality.  There were also great songs and I loved the message of , ""There's Always Another Rainbow"".  I firmly believe that myself.  Always have, always will.I also liked the fact that RoseDust, the Queen of the Flutter ponies, refused to help Megan and the others at first.  It gave the story more of a climax and it also gave viewers a reason to keep watching it.  The other reason I thought that part was good is because it taught the lesson of tolerance and helping others, even if they aren't like you.  Which in my opinion, is a very good lesson to learn.Cons:The smooze was plain useless.  It didn't have any characteristics or anything.  Meaning, usually when they have a villain, it speaks it's own mind.  This thing just took orders.

I am in the latter category and I hadn't seen the movie in probably 10+ years. I watched it and still enjoyed it, though I can say that there are flaws to the movie. It is silly at times and has some weird elements (the Smooze is pretty weird) but I would say that overall, it's still a fun movie to watch. Like most of the cartoons from that era, it tries to teach a lesson, and for that reason I think it is worthwhile to share with a child or to watch if you used to love it.This movie also has a star-studded cast, including Danny DeVito, Madeline Kahn (who I love), and many others that you may recognize by their voices. All these stars for a pretty cheap price is a bargain to me. If you don't read into the movie too much, it's a very cute and fun flick.",4,Nostalgia and some fun...,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,890,"['would', 'say', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'age', '10', 'used', 'watch', 'child', 'am', 'latter', 'category', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'probably', '10+', 'years', 'watched', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'flaws', 'movie', 'silly', 'times', 'weird', 'elements', 'Smooze', 'pretty', 'weird', 'would', 'say', 'overall', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'most', 'cartoons', 'era', 'teach', 'lesson', 'reason', 'think', 'worthwhile', 'share', 'child', 'watch', 'used', 'love', 'it.This', 'movie', 'also', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'including', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'who', 'love', 'many', 'others', 'may', 'recognize', 'voices', 'stars', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'price', 'bargain', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'cute', 'fun', 'flick']",My Little Pony:the Movie VHS
