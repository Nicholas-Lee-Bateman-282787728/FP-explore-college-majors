865742,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0006FO5LO,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[3, 6]","To be completely honest, I hate westerns. It's the city boy in me, and the fact that I'm only recently in my twenties. Most would agree that the best westerns came out in the fifties and sixties, and that's a time I just haven't had much of a care to visit (tragic, isn't it). So, when I heard HBO was going to have its own western based mostly on historical events, I was a little skeptical. So skeptical, in fact, that I didn't even watch the show during its first and second season run. It wasn't until I saw it On Demand that I became hooked.I wasn't hooked immediately, though. I was struck dumb by the graphic violence and the constant stream of profanity that spewed from the characters' mouths. I didn't appreciate the fact that the obvious main character (or scene stealer) was the proprietor of a ""brothel."" It redeemed itself, however, as the story progressed dramatically into the more historical elements. It was odd and delightful at the same time to see characters that took shape in tall tales in stark reality form: Calamity Jane, a foul-mouthed alcoholic, and Wild Bill, a brooding gambler.After that, my interest ran downhill. All the characters made their slow appearances, all of which were as unique as the next and, despite such a large cast, with an important role in the story. And the story itself, continuing from episode to episode, is filled with as much drama as comedy.The one problem I have with the series itself is the large cast I mentioned before. While I said that all the characters have a role in the story, it is difficult to grasp all the names in the series, especially when new characters are introduced in each episode.

865743,ARA48345JZPZR,B0006FO5LO,Archmaker,"[8, 9]","I love Deadwood.  I love the language in Deadwood so much I watch it with Closed Captioning just so I won't miss any of it.  There is a slew of elaborate profanity mixed into some of the best self-revealing soliloquies by different characters (usually at least one per show) that, as many reviewers have pointed out, rises to an over-arching eloquence that is Shakespearian in its density.  David Milch has noted that Deadwood was known for being foul-mouthed.  Did they use the ""F"" word in the 1800's?  I don't know, and I don't care.  This Deadwood was written for our age, not that age.Just like the muddy, cruddy, yet aspiring and energetic mining town itself, the dialogue in Deadwood runs from the crudest to the most proper.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but Seth Bullock and his partner rarely curse, nor does the Newspaper editor, and of course, the widow and assorted others.  Many curse only infrequently.  The foulest mouths are the saloon/brothel owners, the prostitutes, gamblers, drunks and killers that frequent them.  Well, duh!Towering over them all, of course, is Al Swearengen, the gloriously unscrupulous, profane, and hilarious Ian McShane, in the character and performance of a lifetime.  Swearengen's ruminations and outbursts remind me of Jean Shepard talking about his father's cursing ""my old man worked in profanity like other artists worked in clay or paint"" or ""he wove a tapestry of curses that is drifting somewhere over lake Erie to this day"".So, if you are offended by serious profanity interspersed with some of the best dialogue I've heard in ages, for crying out loud do not watch Deadwood or buy this DVD.That said, many other reviewers have outlined all the things to like about Deadwood.  Dense and complex characters, atmosphere and plots.  All true.  As mentioned above, I also find the show damn funny, and find the ironic twist and the acerbic aside delightful and hilarious.  It is an off-center look at the entrepenuerial spirit and the American Dream.  It's assorted losers trying one more time to hit it big before civilization, big business and the Politicos crush them. And it never failed to surprise me.The cast is superb.  I could single out individual performers, but the fact is all of them, from the ""Mayor"", to Doc, to the Widow, to the marvelous Calamity Jane, to the muleskinner, to Trixie and Bullock and his partner are all first rate. Not to overlook the brief appearance of Wild Bill nicely done by Keith Carradine.It is a terrific ensemble piece that is immeasurably enhanced by the towering performance of McShane's Al Swearengen.  What an inspiration of casting to find in this very competent, but rarely seen, British actor, someone who has somehow pulled out of himself this incredibly powerful, shameless, vile, conniving, ruthless, frightening and captivating rogue.  Swearengen is a total piece of work, a prism of differing colors from moment to moment, reflecting his mood and situation.  With his own weird charisma offset by so many different characters and sensibilites, Deadwood makes a constant claim on your attention and intelligence.Many of the episodes are written by women.  I ascribe no significance to this, other than an interesting detail, unless perhaps it partially explains why the women characters are as complex, tough, gritty and flawed as the male characters in Deadwood.First rate in all departments, this is work that challenges and delights if the profanity and earthiness of it's characters doesn't put you off.  Season Two really took flight, but anyone new to the series will need the first season to get their sea legs. McShane and all the others have their sea legs by the next season and Al Swearengen talking to the ""Chief"" is coming up and it is priceless.",5,Hilarious and Profane Eloquence!,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,3764,"['love', 'Deadwood', 'love', 'language', 'Deadwood', 'so', 'much', 'watch', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'just', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'slew', 'elaborate', 'profanity', 'mixed', 'best', 'self-revealing', 'soliloquies', 'different', 'characters', 'usually', 'least', 'one', 'show', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'over-arching', 'eloquence', 'Shakespearian', 'density', 'David', 'Milch', 'noted', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'known', 'being', 'foul-mouthed', 'Did', 'use', 'F', 'word', '1800', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'written', 'age', 'not', 'age.Just', 'muddy', 'cruddy', 'aspiring', 'energetic', 'mining', 'town', 'dialogue', 'Deadwood', 'runs', 'crudest', 'most', 'proper', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'noticed', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'partner', 'rarely', 'curse', 'Newspaper', 'editor', 'course', 'widow', 'assorted', 'others', 'Many', 'curse', 'only', 'infrequently', 'foulest', 'mouths', 'are', 'saloon/brothel', 'owners', 'prostitutes', 'gamblers', 'drunks', 'killers', 'frequent', 'Well', 'duh', 'Towering', 'course', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'gloriously', 'unscrupulous', 'profane', 'hilarious', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'character', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Swearengen', 'ruminations', 'outbursts', 'remind', 'Jean', 'Shepard', 'talking', 'father', 'cursing', 'old', 'man', 'worked', 'profanity', 'other', 'artists', 'worked', 'clay', 'paint', 'wove', 'tapestry', 'curses', 'drifting', 'somewhere', 'lake', 'Erie', 'day', '.So', 'are', 'offended', 'serious', 'profanity', 'interspersed', 'best', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'ages', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'Deadwood', 'buy', 'DVD.That', 'said', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'outlined', 'things', 'like', 'about', 'Deadwood', 'Dense', 'complex', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'plots', 'true', 'mentioned', 'also', 'find', 'show', 'funny', 'find', 'ironic', 'twist', 'acerbic', 'aside', 'delightful', 'hilarious', 'off-center', 'look', 'entrepenuerial', 'spirit', 'American', 'Dream', 'assorted', 'losers', 'trying', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'hit', 'big', 'civilization', 'big', 'business', 'Politicos', 'crush', 'never', 'failed', 'surprise', 'me.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'could', 'single', 'out', 'individual', 'performers', 'fact', 'Mayor', 'Doc', 'Widow', 'marvelous', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'muleskinner', 'Trixie', 'Bullock', 'partner', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Not', 'overlook', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'nicely', 'done', 'Keith', 'Carradine.It', 'terrific', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'immeasurably', 'enhanced', 'towering', 'performance', 'McShane', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'What', 'inspiration', 'casting', 'find', 'very', 'competent', 'rarely', 'seen', 'British', 'actor', 'someone', 'who', 'somehow', 'pulled', 'out', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'shameless', 'vile', 'conniving', 'ruthless', 'frightening', 'captivating', 'rogue', 'Swearengen', 'total', 'piece', 'work', 'prism', 'differing', 'colors', 'moment', 'moment', 'reflecting', 'mood', 'situation', 'own', 'weird', 'charisma', 'offset', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'sensibilites', 'Deadwood', 'constant', 'claim', 'attention', 'intelligence.Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'written', 'women', 'ascribe', 'significance', 'other', 'interesting', 'detail', 'perhaps', 'partially', 'why', 'women', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'tough', 'gritty', 'flawed', 'male', 'characters', 'Deadwood.First', 'rate', 'departments', 'work', 'delights', 'profanity', 'earthiness', 'characters', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'Season', 'Two', 'really', 'took', 'flight', 'anyone', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'need', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'sea', 'legs', 'McShane', 'others', 'have', 'sea', 'legs', 'next', 'season', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'talking', 'Chief', 'coming', 'up', 'priceless']",N/A

Deadwood is the western reimagined with a myriad of complex characters, vulgar and grandiose (and I mean that as a compliment) dialogue, ambitious themes including greed, loyalty, morality, etc. and surprising dashes of dark humor that serve as a respite from the often intense proceedings.Set in a lawless town that sprouts up in the Dakotas during the late 1800's, Deadwood's first season follows a panoply of individuals who have flocked there for varying reasons including, most prominently, the allure of gold.  But not everyone is there to strike it rich.  The infamous Wild Bill Hickock has come there to live out his final days (at one point in the series he asks his friend, Charlie, to allow him to go to hell in his own way) while others are looking to get out from under the law.  Lawlessness seems to be the only constant in the morally bankrupt town of Deadwood, but what's fascinating is how a certain sense of order manages to emerge from the chaos.Deadwood doesn't rely on huge plot twists or melodrama to propel its story.  Everything that transpires is largely character driven as the citizens of the town act out of greed, jealousy, rage and a desire for power.  All of the performances are stellar, especially Ian McShane as Al Swearingen the owner of the town's local saloon.  Swearingen has a pitch black soul and an intensity in his eyes that could cut through even the bravest of souls.  Yet even he is not without complexity.  Swearingen is ruthelss and will do whatever is necessary to protect his own interests, but he still sees the need for order and fairness (however twisted that idea may be to him) and is even capable of compassion as evidenced in the season finale.Granted, the profanity comes fast and furious in this series which will understandibly turn many away.  But for me the profanity is as much a part of the characters as is their complex motives and moral ambiguities.  Deadwood just wouldn't feel right without either of them.",4,Not your traditional western,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,2116,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'westerns', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'find', 'so', 'Deadwood', 'not', 'typical', 'western', 'Deadwood', 'western', 'reimagined', 'myriad', 'complex', 'characters', 'vulgar', 'grandiose', 'mean', 'compliment', 'dialogue', 'ambitious', 'themes', 'including', 'greed', 'loyalty', 'morality', 'etc', 'surprising', 'dashes', 'dark', 'humor', 'serve', 'respite', 'often', 'intense', 'proceedings.Set', 'lawless', 'town', 'up', 'Dakotas', 'late', '1800', 'Deadwood', 'first', 'season', 'panoply', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'flocked', 'varying', 'reasons', 'including', 'most', 'prominently', 'allure', 'gold', 'not', 'everyone', 'there', 'strike', 'rich', 'infamous', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'come', 'there', 'live', 'out', 'final', 'days', 'one', 'point', 'series', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'allow', 'go', 'hell', 'own', 'way', 'others', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'out', 'law', 'Lawlessness', 'be', 'only', 'constant', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'town', 'Deadwood', 'what', 'fascinating', 'how', 'certain', 'sense', 'order', 'manages', 'emerge', 'chaos.Deadwood', ""n't"", 'rely', 'huge', 'plot', 'twists', 'melodrama', 'propel', 'story', 'Everything', 'largely', 'character', 'driven', 'citizens', 'town', 'act', 'greed', 'jealousy', 'rage', 'desire', 'power', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'especially', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Al', 'Swearingen', 'owner', 'town', 'local', 'saloon', 'Swearingen', 'pitch', 'black', 'soul', 'intensity', 'eyes', 'could', 'cut', 'even', 'bravest', 'souls', 'even', 'not', 'complexity', 'Swearingen', 'ruthelss', 'will', 'do', 'necessary', 'protect', 'own', 'interests', 'still', 'need', 'order', 'fairness', 'however', 'twisted', 'idea', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'capable', 'compassion', 'evidenced', 'season', 'finale.Granted', 'profanity', 'fast', 'furious', 'series', 'will', 'understandibly', 'turn', 'many', 'away', 'profanity', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'characters', 'complex', 'motives', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'Deadwood', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right']",N/A

I never got to watch this show when it was first on the air, but since it has been added to Amazon's Prime selections, I've looked forward to seeing it. I became a fan of Tim Olyphant from his role as Raylen Givens on The FX network hit, Justified, and Ian McShane has long been an interesting actor, so I was doubly interested in this show . The supporting cast is top notch, full of recognizable faces you've seen in lots of other things over the years, so this is a great ensemble cast. The stories are okay, but nothing really to write home about. It's the dialogue that really gets your attention, and not just the near-constant cursing. There's a stilted formality to everyone's vocabulary that makes me wonder if this is just David Milch and Co. showing off or if people actually talked this way in those days. I mean, going back to Justified again, the writers on that show write some awesomely witty dialogue for their characters, but I've lived around enough Southern rednecks to know that very damned few of them have the linguistic chops portrayed by the make-believe residents of Harlan County, KY, and I'm pretty sure the gold-hungry residents of Deadwood, SD are no different. A minor quibble is Olyphant's portrayal of Seth Bullock. He seems nearly always on the verge of boiling over into violence. And it's tiring to watch. He spends nearly the entire season screwing his face into a barely masked rage at nearly everyone and everything. On the other hand, McShane's Al Swearingen and Powers Booth as his chief competitor for the horny gold miner market are both chewing enough scenery to put an entire herd of goats out of business and it's damned fun to watch; and anytime William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum or Brad Dourif as Doc Cochran are on screen, they are not to be missed. Others to watch are Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, John Hawkes as Bullock's mild-mannered business partner Sol Star, and Molly Parker as Alma Garrett. Parker's performance for most of the first season is rather inert, but at the end of the first season, you start to see a bit of fire as she and Bullock heat things up in the boudoir. Finally, if you're a fan of TV show drinking games, take any given episode and down a shot whenever Weigert's of McShane's characters utter a profane sexual reference...you'll be knee-walking drunk by the closing credits!",5,@%^$!!!!,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,2411,"['Man', 'characters', 'show', 'sure', 'do', 'swear', 'bunch', 'never', 'got', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'air', 'been', 'added', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'selections', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'became', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Olyphant', 'role', 'Raylen', 'Givens', 'FX', 'network', 'hit', 'Justified', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'long', 'been', 'interesting', 'actor', 'was', 'doubly', 'interested', 'show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'full', 'recognizable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'other', 'things', 'years', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'stories', 'are', 'okay', 'nothing', 'really', 'write', 'home', 'dialogue', 'really', 'attention', 'not', 'just', 'near-constant', 'cursing', 'stilted', 'formality', 'everyone', 'vocabulary', 'wonder', 'just', 'David', 'Milch', 'Co.', 'showing', 'off', 'people', 'actually', 'talked', 'way', 'days', 'mean', 'going', 'back', 'Justified', 'again', 'writers', 'show', 'write', 'awesomely', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'enough', 'Southern', 'rednecks', 'know', 'very', 'damned', 'few', 'have', 'linguistic', 'chops', 'portrayed', 'make-believe', 'residents', 'Harlan', 'County', 'KY', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'gold-hungry', 'residents', 'Deadwood', 'SD', 'are', 'different', 'minor', 'quibble', 'Olyphant', 'portrayal', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'nearly', 'always', 'verge', 'boiling', 'over', 'violence', 'tiring', 'watch', 'nearly', 'entire', 'season', 'screwing', 'face', 'barely', 'masked', 'rage', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'everything', 'other', 'hand', 'McShane', 'Al', 'Swearingen', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'chief', 'competitor', 'horny', 'gold', 'miner', 'market', 'are', 'chewing', 'enough', 'scenery', 'put', 'entire', 'herd', 'goats', 'business', 'damned', 'fun', 'watch', 'anytime', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'E.B', 'Farnum', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Doc', 'Cochran', 'are', 'screen', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Others', 'watch', 'are', 'Robin', 'Weigert', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Bullock', 'mild-mannered', 'business', 'partner', 'Sol', 'Star', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Alma', 'Garrett', 'Parker', 'performance', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'rather', 'inert', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'start', 'see', 'bit', 'fire', 'Bullock', 'heat', 'things', 'up', 'boudoir', 'Finally', ""'re"", 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'drinking', 'games', 'take', 'given', 'episode', 'shot', 'whenever', 'Weigert', 'McShane', 'characters', 'utter', 'profane', 'sexual', 'reference', ""'ll"", 'be', 'knee-walking', 'drunk', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A

865782,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,B0006FO5LO,Christopher Hivner,"[2, 2]","Set in a burgeoning mining camp in 1876 in modern day South Dakota, Deadwood brings together honest businessmen, dreamers intent on striking it rich with a gold claim and crooks who go where the money is and the law isn't. The action boils around the Gem saloon owned and operated by Al Swearengen who knows everything that's going on in camp and how to profit from it. Seth Bullock and his friend Sol Starr are ex-lawmen from Montana who arrive to open a hardware store and immediately butt heads with Swearengen who they have to buy the plot from. Wild Bill Hickok rides into town burdened by demons and accompanied by ultra foul mouthed Calamity Jane. E.B. Farnum owns a hotel, sells information to Swearengen and talks in circles using big words and phrases in an attempt to elevate himself above his station. The only doctor in town has to deal with a plague, all the whores at two saloons and taking care of a Scandinavian child whose family has been killed.Deadwood is so well written and acted you almost forget how base it is. Until someone opens their mouth. This is probably the best depiction of a lawless old west town you'll ever see, but they do go overboard on the language. Sometimes the words are flying so frequently I start to laugh and that's not a good thing when you're presenting a drama. That being said, everything else about the show is wonderful. Ian McShane as Swearengen is unreal. Brad Dourif as the doctor gets better with each show, cresting with the episode when Rev. Smith dies. Dourif's scenes at the end are amazing. William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum continues to add to his resume of odd characters, both in comedies and dramas. It takes special talent to do both.I don't have HBO so I'm late getting on the Deadwood train, renting them from Blockbuster. Learning that there are only three seasons was a sad moment.

But, as with the best of HBO's hourlong dramas, patience pays off.It's as if David Milch, taking a cue from Tom Fontana, had wandered onto the set of ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" and plotted a series that describes the darker side of the west and of America's post-Civil War expansion.Although there are many characters, the central conflict is between saloon keep and crime boss Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) -- who wants to milk his town for everything he can -- and Bullock (Tim Olyphant), a chronically noble, hard-nosed sheriff-turned-hardware salesman who has a tendency to chafe the corrupt.  They're the axels of the wagon, surrounded by a host of colorful characters.Much has been made of the show's profantiy but not nearly enough has been said about the strange moments of friendship and sweetness that float through the darkness.  There's something strangely bittersweet about the shine the gruff Charlie Utter takes to Bullock; about Bullock's quiet bond with his partner Starr; Calamity Jane's devotion to Bill Hickok; and especially Brad Dourif's Doc, who treats everyone with tough-love compassion and a intense curiosity for the stranger side of medicine.  Even Swearengen has rare flashes of virtue and, in fact, in his dealing with Reverend Smith he performs the biggest act of kindness in the entire season.Unlike the four- and twelve-letter words (which are reportedly historically accurate to the time and place), the moments of mercy and humanity aren't as overt and have attracted less attention from critics.  They're subtle and require more attention and, in the end, elevate the series beyond its gritty surface.",5,"""Oz"" meets ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller""",1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,1773,"['took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'mud', 'rhythms', 'challenged', 'characters', 'odd', 'syntax', 'strange', 'often', 'repellent', 'Western', 'series', 'best', 'HBO', 'hourlong', 'dramas', 'patience', 'pays', 'off.It', 'David', 'Milch', 'taking', 'cue', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'had', 'wandered', 'set', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'plotted', 'series', 'darker', 'side', 'west', 'America', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'central', 'conflict', 'saloon', 'keep', 'crime', 'boss', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'who', 'milk', 'town', 'everything', 'can', 'Bullock', 'Tim', 'Olyphant', 'chronically', 'noble', 'hard-nosed', 'sheriff-turned-hardware', 'salesman', 'who', 'tendency', 'chafe', 'corrupt', ""'re"", 'axels', 'wagon', 'surrounded', 'host', 'colorful', 'characters.Much', 'been', 'made', 'show', 'profantiy', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'been', 'said', 'strange', 'moments', 'friendship', 'sweetness', 'darkness', 'something', 'strangely', 'shine', 'gruff', 'Charlie', 'Utter', 'Bullock', 'Bullock', 'quiet', 'bond', 'partner', 'Starr', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'devotion', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'especially', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Doc', 'who', 'everyone', 'tough-love', 'compassion', 'intense', 'curiosity', 'stranger', 'side', 'medicine', 'Even', 'Swearengen', 'rare', 'flashes', 'virtue', 'fact', 'dealing', 'Reverend', 'Smith', 'biggest', 'act', 'kindness', 'entire', 'season.Unlike', 'four-', 'twelve-letter', 'words', 'are', 'reportedly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'time', 'place', 'moments', 'mercy', 'humanity', 'are', ""n't"", 'overt', 'have', 'attracted', 'less', 'attention', 'critics', ""'re"", 'subtle', 'require', 'more', 'attention', 'end', 'elevate', 'series', 'gritty', 'surface']",N/A
865786,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,B0006FO5LO,colinwoodward,"[9, 11]","I just finished watching the first season. What a terrific show! However, it is excessively profane. First, let me address the profanity and then I'll get to the terrific aspects. David Milch, the show's creative talent, seems to forget that Deadwood is not Hell's Kitchen, NYC, in the 2000s. No doubt, towns like Deadwood were filled with profane people. Nevertheless, I have a PhD in early American history, and I can say with confidence that Westerners--even the worst killers such as those who populate this show--did not talk this way. There's a big difference between the profanity of the 1870s and today. ""MFer"" was simply not in common usage back then. The use of MFer and C-sucker is an affectation of the show's writers, nothing more. The show's intention regarding the language obviously is not historical accuracy, but to make these guys and gals seem tough. The show certainly makes its point. But as much could have been accomplished without using pervasive four and 12-letter words. After all, does anyone remember Eastwood swearing that much in his Westerns? Sure, it's HBO, and Deadwood should revel in its artistic freedom. But it gets carried away with its vulgarity. It was only until around WWII and after that such 12-letter words were used commonly. I mean, who even today uses C-sucker this much? The F-word certainly existed in the 1870s, but the more profane types were more prone to use G-damn and SOB. But rather than dispute the historical accuracy of the show's language, in using too much profanity, Milch makes a worse artistic mistake than a historical one. The swearing distracts us more than it underscores the drama and character development. Ian McShane's constant profanity is sometimes very funny and effective. At other times, it's unnecessary and distracting. I couldn't imagine anyone, no matter how tough or influential back then, telling an important politician to F-himself to his face. Even the most notorious criminals had more sense and diplomacy than that. And many of the characters talk the same way. Occasionally, we feel more like we're watching a David Mamet or Scorsese film than a Western--all the bad guys talk like a Bronx wiseguy. The show's excessive foul language aside, let me say that the merits far outwieght the in-your-face dialogue. For the most part, the historical details of the show are excellent. The sets, costumes, and props were carefully researched and are truly convincing. And many of the characters on Deadwood were real people, who really looked like they do on the show. It's nice to see people walking through muddy streets, just as they did in the 1800s. We see the West, warts and all. The show's greatest success, however, is in the energy, pacing, and performances. The ensemble cast is superb, made up of unknowns as well as familiar character actors. They all seem incapable of giving a bad performance. Much praise, and well deserved at that, has been given to the show's main characters of Al Swearingen, Seth Bullock, Cy Tolliver, and Wild Bill Hickock. However, my favorite character, and perhaps the most decent man to be found in Deadwood is the doctor, played by Brad Dourif (Exorcist III, Mississippi Burning). Also great is William Sanderson (""Larry"" from the Newhart show), who, as the hotel proprietor (and later, mayor) E. B. Farnum, is as slimy and calculating as they come. But he, as with McShane's Swearingen, gets laughs even when doing the most reprehensible things. But Farnum, not to mention Powers Boothe's Tolliver, seems more evil than Swearingen because his wickedness is behind-the-scenes. As amoral as Swearingen is, he doesn't hide much, and he is capable at times of compassion and understanding. Unlike so many previous Westerns, which focus on loners (the Eastwood and John Wayne pictures), gunslingers (The Magnificent Seven), outlaw bands (The Wild Bunch) or do-gooders (Bonanza), Deadwood involves a whole community in the action. Thus, we get the excitement of a Spaghetti Western as well as the complexity of a western show like Little House on the Prairie. Deadwood is not about gunfights or cowboys versus Indians, and those fights that are featured are free of cliches. Here, the struggle to survive often blurs lines of good versus evil. Deadwood is more about how people act in a society where rules and morality are fluid. Deadwood is a place populated by brutal, selfish, and cruel people. There are some good souls, but none are without their flaws or free of suffering. Deadwood is about the birthpangs of American society. Even more so, it is about human nature and the struggle for people to bring civility to a wilderness. But at a more basic level, it is simply great drama. Deadwood contains some of the most memorable and moving (not to mention violent) characters and scenes I have ever seen in a TV show. We get a much richer sense of humanity than on any other TV Western. Unlike Bonanza, good does not necessarily triumph. If the motion picture industry has stopped making good Westerns, then let HBO make them. The first season of Deadwood is the best 12 hours of Western ever put on film.",5,4.5 Stars,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,5132,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'What', 'terrific',

The acting is first rate, even brilliant at times, and the gritty feel of the show (a grit that encompasses everything from the set design to the costumes to the language) strikes me as more inherently true to the show's time period than the squeaky clean sets and sanitized scripts of the old Fifties Western ever were.That said (and having read through a few of the negative comments and found what I think are common threads of complaint), I offer a fair warning to some who might be easily offended: this show is profane, in the strict sense that the scripts, while artfully constructed, are filled with every kind of bad word you can imagine, strung together in every kind of combination that you can imagine (and even, perhaps, some that you can't). There is violence and plenty of it, sometimes quite graphic. And there is a decent amount of nudity and sexual content. While I don't find (most) of it unnecessary - I think much of it serves the writers' goal of equating the corruption of the West with the corruption of the present - I would point this out to those who might be put off by such things.

865788,A3PFKE8EFXAXQE,B0006FO5LO,"cornbreadthedog ""larue""","[0, 0]","DEADWOOD ROCKS!A very dark and a very jarringly gritty western that's written in such a way as to bring the old west to life as it really was: every man's and every dreamer's out for himself, trying to stake a claim on the ever changing and ever shifting world around him, far from home and not a nickel to loan. Here, in this version of DEADWOOD, constant heartbreak and bitter betrayal seems just as natural as muddy streets and horse waste knowing each other on a first name basis!..LOL..LOL...My two favorite characters,so far, are E.B. FARNUM, the hotel owner and the ""mayor"" of DEADWOOD and,of course,  AL SWEARENGEN, the money hungrily complex and morally twisted proprietor of the brothel/saloon called THE GEM!The actor that plays E.B. FARNUM is a funny little scene stealer! He plays a scummy, shady, spineless but a somewhat unlikeable little weasel extremely well!Then, there's IAN MCSHANE who plays AL SWEARENGEN to sheer perfection! It might be just me, but at certain angles and because of the way that he carries on and intimidates people with his brooding insanity and spiteful ruthlessness, MCSHANE channels a little bit of an old west version of AL PACCINO into the villain that he's portraying. And that's a good thing.Man, I could go on and on about DEADWOOD and how there's so many cold and memorable lines in just this box set alone and how there's some very sweet and tender moments, like when the Reverend is comforting people with such joy when his own illness has overtaken him and has him bent over in the coffee brown mud. There's also some great laugh out loud and awkwardly humorous moments that light up my DVD player as well.I only have just one gripe about DEADWOOD. SOMETIMES I WISHED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TONED DOWN SOME OF THE FOUL LANGUAGE AND TONED DOWN SOME OF THE NUDITY A BIT. But, hey, I get it. They're prostitutes here and there's some serious fornication going on in an old western town. People cussed up a storm then and they still cuss like sailors nowadays anyways. Still, this is an HBO show and HBO has always pushed the envelope in creativity and has always embraced artistic expressions, however they may be showcased about.Yet,I still wished that there was a little less skin and more shoot outs in the streets of DEADWOOD.I'm over onto SEASON TWO of DEADWOOD right now. I'm busting my gut laughing and then turning right around and feeling some real empathy for the townsfolk of this makeshift western community. Who knows? Maybe that's the real appeal and the real inquisitive fascination of the old west for us here in America. Or it just might be the draw of a really good show?In any case...DEADWOOD'S got a new tenderfoot in town, mister.So's I'm a need some sausages, a frying skillet, a sleeping blanket, some beans, and a pick axe.What? 12 dollars?....(Drawing gun on  DEADWOOD merchant)",4,"THIS'UN HERE'S NOT YA' PAPPY'S KINDA' WESTERN, YOUNG-UN'!",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2850,"['DEADWOOD', 'ROCKS', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'jarringly', 'gritty', 'western', 'written', 'such', 'way', 'bring', 'old', 'west', 'life', 'really', 'was', 'man', 'dreamer', 'out', 'trying', 'stake', 'claim', 'ever', 'changing', 'ever', 'shifting', 'world', 'far', 'home', 'not', 'nickel', 'loan', 'Here', 'version', 'DEADWOOD', 'constant', 'heartbreak', 'bitter', 'betrayal', 'just', 'as', 'natural', 'muddy', 'streets', 'horse', 'waste', 'knowing', 'other', 'first', 'name', 'basis', '..LOL..LOL', 'two', 'favorite', 'characters', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'E.B', 'FARNUM', 'hotel', 'owner', 'mayor', 'DEADWOOD', 'course', 'AL', 'SWEARENGEN', 'money', 'hungrily', 'complex', 'morally', 'twisted', 'proprietor', 'brothel/saloon', 'called', 'THE', 'GEM', 'actor', 'E.B', 'FARNUM', 'funny', 'little', 'scene', 'stealer', 'scummy', 'shady', 'spineless', 'somewhat', 'unlikeable', 'little', 'weasel', 'extremely', 'well', 'Then', 'IAN', 'MCSHANE', 'who', 'AL', 'SWEARENGEN', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'certain', 'angles', 'way', 'intimidates', 'people', 'brooding', 'insanity', 'spiteful', 'ruthlessness', 'MCSHANE', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'west', 'version', 'AL', 'PACCINO', 'villain', 'portraying', 'good', 'thing.Man', 'could', 'go', 'DEADWOOD', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'cold', 'memorable', 'lines', 'just', 'box', 'set', 'alone', 'how', 'very', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moments', 'when', 'Reverend', 'comforting', 'people', 'such', 'joy', 'when', 'own', 'illness', 'overtaken', 'bent', 'coffee', 'brown', 'mud', 'also', 'great', 'laugh', 'loud', 'awkwardly', 'humorous', 'moments', 'light', 'up', 'DVD', 'player', 'well.I', 'only', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'gripe', 'DEADWOOD', 'SOMETIMES', 'WISHED', 'THEY', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'TONED', 'DOWN', 'SOME', 'THE', 'FOUL', 'LANGUAGE', 'AND', 'TONED', 'DOWN', 'SOME', 'THE', 'NUDITY', 'A', 'BIT', 'hey', 'get', ""'re"", 'prostitutes', 'here', 'serious', 'fornication', 'going', 'old', 'western', 'town', 'People', 'cussed', 'up', 'storm', 'then', 'still', 'cuss', 'sailors', 'nowadays', 'anyways', 'Still', 'HBO', 'show', 'HBO', 'always', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'creativity', 'always', 'embraced', 'artistic', 'expressions', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'showcased', 'about.Yet', 'still', 'wished', 'was', 'little', 'less', 'skin', 'more', 'shoot', 'outs', 'streets', 'DEADWOOD.I', ""'m"", 'SEASON', 'TWO', 'DEADWOOD', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'busting', 'gut', 'laughing', 'then', 'turning', 'right', 'around', 'feeling', 'real', 'empathy', 'townsfolk', 'makeshift', 'western', 'community', 'Who', 'Maybe', 'real', 'appeal', 'real', 'inquisitive', 'fascination', 'old', 'west', 'here', 'America', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'draw', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'case', 'DEADWOOD', 'got', 'new', 'tenderfoot', 'town', 'mister.So', ""'m"", 'need', 'sausages', 'frying', 'skillet', 'sleeping', 'blanket', 'beans', 'pick', 'axe.What', '12', 'dollars', 'Drawing', 'gun', 'DEADWOOD', 'merchant']",N/A

This show is not for the timid. The drama is complex, well woven, and worth every penny. However, the language is boldly profane, almost to the point of distraction. What keeps you mesmerized is the excellent writing and acting, both of which captivate and cajole you into wanting more at the end of every episode. Despite the profanity and violence, there is a stunningly good plot in this show. A widow with a valuable gold claim, a pair of merchants with law-man tendencies, a saloon owner of royal ambition, and a host of other characters trying to eek out an existence in a place where nothing's easy. What I enjoy most about this show is that it is not Bonanza or a lame western melodrama. Rather, it is a fully developed world populated by characters willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their ambitions within the context of boom town. It's not as simple as good guys versus bad guys. There are shades of evil and spots of serenity everywhere. How they splice together is where the action is and you won't be disappointed. I watched this show when it was on HBO and am glad to have it now to watch several more times. I only wish it would have remained a series. There's a lot more distance these characters can go.

Theres characters of many shades in the camp and its anything but your usual television pablum. I thought the show was well paced early in the season with many character introductions and interesting plot twists. However later in the season the plot moved along at a glacial pace. This is probably the biggest knock on the show, it really does move at a slow pace.Thankfully the characters are interesting enough despite the slow pace. Though unfortunately probably the most interesting character of all dies halfway through the first season. I'm not sure the producers of the show once they saw the powerful performance of that actor may not have wanted that character to stay on the show for another season or so before his inevitable demise. No one steps in to fill his shoes, so despite rationalizing the loss as 'historically accurate' you cant help but feel a bit cheated at the loss.Still we're left with Swearengen who is obviously the star of the show now, and he's suitably interesting to keep things rolling along. Occassionally another character like Bullock or someone else has a good scene in the show and breaks out of their mold. I'm not sure if the scriptwriters are simply better at writing for compromised and conflicted characters like Swearengen and Hickcock or if they're just more interesting to watch, but they totally outshine the other characters on the show who sometimes seem a bit wooden.A very watchable show that is faithful to its period and has production values equal to that of any Hollywood movie let alone any television show.

865821,A2G39KAEO73GVC,B0006FO5LO,echoes999,"[11, 13]","HBO is known for it's great TV shows, I should know, since I've already payed a fortune getting them all on DVD. Whether it's The Sopranos, Oz, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Six Feet Under or Carnivale, they're all incredible shows. But with Deadwood they've truly out done themselves. This has got to be one of the best shows ever created, and yes, it even squeaks by Sopranos as my favorite show.David Milch, the creator has crafted a pure work of art and managed to reinvigorate the genre Western. The show has everything you could possibly want. It follows several main characters as well as quite a few secondary characters. There's Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) the Gem Saloon owner who basically runs Deadwood from behind the scenes. He is one of the most incredible villians I've ever seen on screen, and it's not because he's so evil. It's because he's so multi-diminsional. Yes he's evil and mean, the killer, the brothel owner, drug dealing snake. And yes he strikes fear in almost everyone he meets, but at moments you see he has another side to him. In a roundabout way he does care about his underlings and the prostitutes that work for him, and occasionally you see moments of compassion and good come out of Swearengen. He's a rather complicated villian that McShane plays with pitch-perfectness. How he didn't get nominated for an emmy I'll never know. Just one look from him and you can see why people are so afraid of him.Another main character is Seth Bullock,(Timothy Olyphant)who used to be a sherrif and has come to start a hardware buisness with his partner Sol Star(John Hawkes). The only problem is, Seth has a quick temper and comes to blows with Swearengen quite easily as he quickly falls in love with a newly made Widow Garret(Molly Parker)There's also Wild Bill Hickok(Keth Carradine) the famous killer and gambler along with his friend Calamity Jane(Robin Weigert) who is almost comedy relief in such a gritty show, but never so much you feel like she's just a mockery. There's the Doc(Brad Dourif) who looks after the camp and Swearengens girls. Dourif does an incredible job make Doc credibly and vulnerble, since he was involved with the Civil War and still suffers bad memories of what happened there.There's another not so nice Saloon owner Cy Tolliver(Powers Boothe) who has more of a quite rage compared to Searengen's gusto, but he's still someone not to be messed with.The show centers on Deadwood, a real place in South Dakota in 1876. The Gold rush is on and there's plenty of it up in the hills around town, and not only that, but Deadwood is lawless because it's on Indian territory. This show is a gritty look into America's past, touching on plagues and diseases, the advancement of civilization, one mans dream of controlling the city and other mans reluctance to keep things morally right with the law behind him. This is one of the smartest shows I've ever watched, with great, beautifully written dialogue. A lot has been said about the use of those four letter words all throughout the show, but it fits in with everything else the West was and you hardly notice it. One of the great things about this show is that it builds and builds in momentum through talking and action, and then suddenly there's a moment of quick viciousness you didn't quite know was coming, and it just hits you.

I love HBO series Sopranos, Carnivale & Six Feet Under. I loved Carnivale best, then Deadwood, then Sopranos, then Six Feet Under.For Ian McShane this is the portrayal of a so-far lifetime. You don't see better acting. He's amazing and deserves an Emmy. And I hated him as Lovejoy (sorry Ian). Brad Dourif again deserves an Emmy. He's superb, and I do not overstate. Ray McKinnon's exquisite portrayal of the Reverend brought tears to my eyes, repeatedly. He definitely deserved an Emmy.  The ladies' parts are excellent, but I think a little overmuch is made of Calamity Jane because she is so, ahem, different. But the actress portraying her is perfection. Trixie is my favorite, played by Paula Malcolmsen. What I absolutely love most about the women's parts is that they are real women with real faces. No botox - they are beautiful with expressions, an occasional little wrinkle and imperfect eyebrows. :-)What a sad state of the world that HBO would cancel Carnivale AND Deadwood!!

First of all, as you have probably all ready heard, the language is way over the top.  Perhaps the infamous ""F"" word was around back in 1876, (or perhaps not, I've seen research to support both conclusions) but even if it was, it was NOT used as commonly as is protrayed on ""DeadWood.""  It just plain wasn't.  Not even with the people with the foulest of mouths.  But what we have here, I think, is the fact that a) the real Deadwood was a ""wide-open"" town, where anything went, and b) the producer and writers of this show had to find a way to get THAT point across to 21st century audiences, so they choose to use language.  (And honestly, I have always suspected that HBO writers get a bonus for using ""f--k"" over a certain number of times in a show.) Okay so we have language, anthing else?  Well, they do play fast and loose with history just a bit.  Not much, but some.  For an example, Seth Bullock and his partner Sol Starr did not get to Deadwood until the day before Wild Bill Hicock was shot, so Hicock and Bullock probably never met, and neither did they become the close friends they are protrayed here.Okay, that's is out of the way, so what do we have left?  For one thing, absolutely the best job of costuming that I've seen in a long, long time.  And also the best sets as well.  Deadwood was not a clean antiseptic town as you see so often in Westerns, but one where horses (and even people) took dumps in the street, one where mining was being done right in the town's main street, and one where most of the women there were prostitutes.  Deadwood protrays all this accurately.And the casting gets an A+ as well.  Maybe not for Bullock so much, but Ian McShane captures Al Sweringin (who was NOT an Englishman, by the way) and the same applies to Robin Weighert (sp?) who plays Calmity Jane.  And never has the engima that Jane Canary (supposedly her real name) so perfectly captured.  Another example of particularly good casting is Keith Carradine as Wild Bill.  Carradine LOOKS more like the ""real thing,"" than anyone else I have seen take on the role.And the scripts are good, with very little dead time in them, very little, if anything, happening just to fill time.  Each character is well developed, with each of them acting in a way that would perfectly consisent with their character.The complete season 1 is expensive, no doubt about that, but you seldom will buy anything else so throughly entertaining for the same price.  I can hardly wait for season 2 to come out.",5,excellent and realistic western series....,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2632,"['Deadwood', 'look', 'Wild', 'West', 'really', 'was', 'more', 'less.A', 'couple', 'minor', 'gripes', 'get', 'way', 'begin', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'probably', 'ready', 'heard', 'language', 'way', 'top', 'Perhaps', 'infamous', 'F', 'word', 'was', 'around', 'back', '1876', 'perhaps', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'research', 'support', 'conclusions', 'even', 'was', 'was', 'NOT', 'used', 'as', 'commonly', 'protrayed', 'DeadWood', 'just', 'plain', 'was', ""n't"", 'Not', 'even', 'people', 'foulest', 'mouths', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'think', 'fact', 'real', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'wide-open', 'town', 'where', 'anything', 'went', 'b', 'producer', 'writers', 'show', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'point', '21st', 'century', 'audiences', 'choose', 'use', 'language', 'honestly', 'have', 'always', 'suspected', 'HBO', 'writers', 'get', 'bonus', 'using', 'f', 'k', 'certain', 'number', 'times', 'show', 'Okay', 'have', 'language', 'anthing', 'else', 'Well', 'do', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'history', 'just', 'bit', 'Not', 'much', 'example', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'partner', 'Sol', 'Starr', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Deadwood', 'day', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hicock', 'was', 'shot', 'Hicock', 'Bullock', 'probably', 'never', 'met', 'did', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'are', 'protrayed', 'here.Okay', 'way', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'left', 'one', 'thing', 'absolutely', 'best', 'job', 'costuming', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'best', 'sets', 'as', 'well', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'not', 'clean', 'antiseptic', 'town', 'see', 'so', 'often', 'Westerns', 'one', 'where', 'horses', 'even', 'people', 'took', 'dumps', 'street', 'one', 'where', 'mining', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'right', 'town', 'main', 'street', 'one', 'where', 'most', 'women', 'were', 'prostitutes', 'Deadwood', 'casting', 'A+', 'as', 'well', 'Maybe', 'not', 'Bullock', 'so', 'much', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Al', 'Sweringin', 'who', 'was', 'NOT', 'Englishman', 'way', 'same', 'applies', 'Robin', 'Weighert', 'sp', 'who', 'Calmity', 'Jane', 'never', 'engima', 'Jane', 'Canary', 'supposedly', 'real', 'name', 'so', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'example', 'particularly', 'good', 'casting', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Carradine', 'LOOKS', 'more', 'real', 'thing', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'take', 'role.And', 'scripts', 'are', 'good', 'very', 'little', 'dead', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'anything', 'happening', 'just', 'fill', 'time', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'acting', 'way', 'would', 'perfectly', 'consisent', 'character.The', 'complete', 'season', '1', 'expensive', 'doubt', 'seldom', 'will', 'buy', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'throughly', 'entertaining', 'same', 'price', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'season', '2', 'come', 'out']",N/A

It's because Season 1, which is contained on this DVD, is far superior. In writing, acting and originality, Season 1 approaches Sopranos level of dramatic achievement. Thus, I endorse wholeheartedly the many laudatory reviews posted here.However, something that has not been adequately emphasized in previous reviews is the outstanding performance of Keith Carradine as Wild Bill Hickok in the first four episodes. In Carradine's understated portrayal of this mythical American figure, Hickok's popular cowboy/gunslinger image is transformed into that of tragic hero worthy of Graham Greene -- a world-weary, burnt out case who acts heroically and humanely toward others in the face his own hopeless fate -- in this case, the violent, senseless death that looms before him. To his close friend Charlie, who senses Hickok's fate and seeks to save him, Carradine's Hickok implores, ""Why can't you just let a man die the way he wants to""? No easy answer can be given to this problematic question, and the writers have the good sense and restraint not to suggest one.Also notable is Swearingen (played with wicked gusto by Emmy winner Ian McShane), one of the best villains since Shakespeare's' Iago, profane in language, but ironically, the only character with the depth and dimension to search for meaning in Hickok's tragic denouement.The other acting is good, if not quite at the level of Carradine and McShane.

Yes, the language is exceedingly crude, rough, profane, dirty, nasty, repulsive... whatever adjective you want to use.  The solution for folks who are put off by the language is an easy one: don't watch the show.  But don't watch the show a few times, decide you are offended by the profanity, and then decide that by that criterion alone Deadwood deserves a single star.  Go watch your PG- or G-rated series or some mind-numbing reality show if you're looking for clean language (but, of course, there's no guarantee of finding clean language in other TV shows, especially so-called 'reality shows', which simply 'bleep' out the offensive words).  Cursing is part of the human condition.  Is it ""over the top"" in Deadwood, i.e., simply so excessive that it detracts from enjoying this amazing production?  That, of course, if up to individual taste and discretion.This series is characterized by absolutely top-notch writing, acting, cinematography and set design.  The plots -- as complex and veering as they can be -- unfold and inter-twine over the course of weeks (like real life) and offer a compulsively watchable, quasi-operatic story line.  Like a series of interwoven morality plays, supported by fascinating arcs of character development.  A mix of Cormac McCarthy (read Blood Meridian), Shakespeare and bar-room banter.  What's most compelling to me is to see how some of the major (as well as certain seemingly lesser) characters develop over time, how they each in their own way struggle with maintaining some semblance of goodness and compassion in the midst of hellish conditions and unabated evil, violence and pestilence.  Of course, some don't even pretend that they ever had a moral compass to begin with.The entire cast is first-rate, with McShane and Olyphant standing out in their dominant roles.  And don't miss Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, Molly Parker as Alma Garrett or William Sanderson as E.B. Farnum.  The ENTIRE cast is amazing.  Powers Booth, Keith Carradine, Brad Dourif, Dayton Callie, Ray McKinnon, Dan Dority, Kim Dickens, Jeffrey Jones, Paula Malcomson, John Hawkes, etc.  Just an incredibly talented cast at the peak of their skills, and a script equal to their acting talents.  The final episode of Season 1 was nothing short of jaw-dropping.  Watch Seth Bullock (Olyphant) -- always chafing at what he sees transpiring in Deadwood, always simmering with pent up rage -- finally reach his limit and cross a line that can't be uncrossed.  Watch Swearengen (McShane)do what he does best (end lives) with cold calculation and not a scintilla of remorse.  Paradoxically, we see Swearengen also -- in taking another life -- commit perhaps his first truly merciful act. Terrific stuff.Is the language and violence a reasonably accurate depiction of social intercourse in the real-world Old West, in South Dakota in frontier days?  That's for the historians to comment upon, I suppose.  But that question misses the point of dramatic art.  And make no mistake: Deadwood is Art.

I expected some kind of pioneer saga, not knowing too much about the background.I found a pioneer saga alright.But what makes this 12 hour movie truly outstanding is something else: its language! The first thing you notice is that hardly ever a sentence is spoken which does not include the F word, often more than once. Once the shock is settled, which took me maybe 2 minutes, as I don't suffer much from sensitive ears in vulgar environments, and if you have ears for language, you realize that these people speak differently from any known world. They speak as if they had imported their conversational style from Victorian England and from the novels of the time.

865860,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B0006FO5LO,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[415, 438]","The best kept secret on television is Deadwood, a semi-true story of the lawless town in South Dakota that popped up during the gold rush days of the 1800's.  The real Deadwood boasted legendary residents like Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickock.  Both figure prominently as characters in the TV series but are far from the only great characters on display.Perhaps you've heard of the series, but never gave it a look.  Or perhaps you were warned by others that the language was so profane as to render it unwatchable.  True, the series isn't for anyone under the age of 18, but it must be understood that this semi-historical piece was written to represent the actual dialect and social tenor of the region at that time.  Deadwood was a rough place without real law, and gold was on everyone's mind.  All the elements for great drama were there.  Greed, corruption, deceipt, innocence, morality (or a lack thereof), hope, hate, fear, addiction, murder, jealousy and love.  Deadwood truly represents a kind of sociological study of human evolution within a laissez faire society.It was clear from episode 1 that the new Deadwood series on HBO was something special.  By episode 4, I was certain that Emmy nominations/awards were imminent.  The show was largely ignored by the Emmys, likely sufferering from a combination of ""newcomer syndrome"" and overshadowing by The Sopranos.  But make no mistake, it was more than worthy with the actors comprising a splendid balance of the familiar and the unfamiliar.  Regardless of fame however, there isn't an off performance to be found in the season.  Nor is there a grossly derivitive one.  The characters are all satisfyingly deep, nuanced and often downright quirky.The writing, as is the case with most HBO original series, was entirley engaging with a character and rhythm all its own.  It is to be savored as a fine wine or concerto.  Unlike many adult drama series on the ""other networks"", Deadwood never loses its momentum.  There is no need to manipulate the audience with cheap antics to get them to care week to week.  The story, actors and writing take care of that.  Each episode flows to the next with amazing fluidity while always maintaining an anticipatory mood.There is really no need to get into plot points as it would require a review the size of the Deadwood script and would involve spoiling much of the drama that one should experience as purely as possible.  Suffice it to say if you enjoy adult themed series such as The Sopranos, you will love Deadwood.  Even if you don't like westerns, it won't matter.  The acting, writing, and plot are just that good.

The show captures the grittiest, grimiest aspects of life in and around the Gold Rush era through the happenings of a small mining town. Deadwood is unflinching and uncompromising, which is what makes it easily the best show on television today. Timothy Olyphant plays Seth Bullock, a man of means and morality. He anchors the show from the chaos and anarchy around him. The show's true star is Ian McShane's Al Swearengen. He is complex and dark but you can also see a bit of good in him behind the tough talking facade. Swearengen runs the Gem Saloon, a brothel and for all intensive purposes runs the daily operations of the camp. What amazed me the most was the audacity of the producers to introduce a core character, Wild Bill Hickock, and then kill him off in the middle of the first season. Hickock's death signified to me, a show that holds nothing sacred, it is truly television without rules, outlaw television and you have to admire it. Each character in Deadwood is fascinating in their own way, from E.B. Farnham's deceptive nature to Cy Tolliver's mean streak, the show always brings you the unexpected and keeps you on your toes. Some people will complain about the coarse language and graphic violence but Deadwood is closer to ""reality tv"" than any of these other so called ""reality"" shows eventhough its fiction. Overall, fans of westerns and just good acting, directing and mainly writing should buy this soon to be classic first season on DVD and cherish it.

Well, thanks to Prime's recent HBO streaming bounty, I could finally start from the beginning, and I was immediately hooked...big time.  Undoubtedly this is television for the ages and Ian McShane as the proud, profane, murderous yet strangely noble Al Swearengen deserves to be enshrined as one of the all-time greatest TV characters.  Special mention also to William Sanderson who tends to be overlooked amid most of the raves for Deadwood.  Somehow he manages to graft his character (Larry with 2 brothers named Daryl) from The Bob Newhart Show to the old west without missing a beat and becomes the most unctuous, sycophantic, supercilious hotelier (shades of John Cleese AND Newhart) cum mayor ever to grace the small screen and yet remain strangely adorable at the same time.

865870,A3BUFAGPDKONX1,B0006FO5LO,Jeff Howard,"[8, 9]","The way to watch these HBO limited series is one episode after another with no interuptions.  I saw ads for DEADWOOD and heard how great it was, but didn't try it until the first season came out.  What an awesome spectical.  The characters are richly drawn and, for the most part, based on about 90% real people.  I'd heard about the profanity but nothing prepares you for the assault.  You just have to watch and enjoy.It's difficult to single out any particular performance as better than any other, however, Ian McShane as Al Swearingen has a plum role as the Gem Saloon keeper, as he has no laws or rules to tie him down.  You find yourself rooting for him in spite of his overall badness.Tim Olypahnt is Seth Bullock, another real life character of the time.  Mostly moral, but a there is a streak of meanness when it is needed.  Usually called upon when there is an issue of justice or fairness to be metted out and usually with extreme violence.Brad Douriff does not receive much credit in the press for his role as Dr. Cochran, an alcoholic and Civil War veteran who is never satisfied with his limitations.  He always strives to do more than the period allows and BD's acting is top-notch as usual.  Here he has been cast in the role of his career.  Like many of the other characters it is hard to take your eyes off of him.Keith Carridine makes a brief turn as Wild Bill Hickock.  He is killed about 4 episodes in, following a timeline mirroring history.  Carridine's performance is so powerful you will swear that he was in more than just the 4 episodes.  He play Hickock with a real depth that is mesmorizing.The perriferal characters are too numerous to mention, but one of my favorites is Mr. Wu, a Chinese version of Swearingen.  The episode entitled MR. WU is among the most comedic.  Primarily due to the extensive use of the word, ""C---sucker!""  You'll be roling in your seat with laughter.An intense drama, you really have to give each episode your full attention because there is so much going on and all characters are richly drawn.

865884,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0006FO5LO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 7]","David Milch, the head writer of the now defunct ABC show ""NYPD Blue"" is the creator of ""Deadwood"" the HBO hit Western-show that recieved notice because of the cussing. And, yes there is a lot of it. The show is one of the most entertaining and well thought out modern westerns I've seen and truly, I don't even like westerns that much. The cast is absolutely spectacular, the characters are well drawn out, the sets are great. The fact that HBO hasn't renewed the actors contracts for a 4th season (yet, I hope) is a damned travesty. Anyway, the show introduces us to a whole array of characters;Seth Bullock (Timothy Olymphant, ""The Girl Next Door""), Sol Star (John Hawkes, ""Me and You and Everyone We Know""), Al Swearengen (Ian McShane, ""Sexy Beast""), Will Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine), Calamity Jane (I'm not sure of the actresses name, but she's great in the role), Doc Cochran (I think it's Brad Dourif, but I'm not positive), Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe, ""U-Turn""), Eddie (Ricky Jay, ""Magnolia""), Trixie, Alma Garrett, and E.B. Farmum; among other names I may have left out. If you haven't watched the show, these names are meaningless...But, I'll give you a quick synopsis of the show (I feel it's best to watch each episode without a preconceived notion of what's going to happen) which I'll follow with some comments on each episode. Seth Bullock and his partner Sol Star move from Montana, where Seth was sheriff, to the Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood is a lawless town that features a whole array of misfits. One of them is a saloon owner named Al Swearengen, who controls almost everything in the town and is basically the villain of the series. Right about the time Bullock and Star arrive, Will Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane do as well. Across the street from Swearengen's saloon, another saloon run by the unstable Cy Tolliver opens up and it features something the citizens of Deadwood have not seen before...A craps table, which is managed by Eddie. Meanwhile, Alma Garrett's husband is pressured into selling his gold claim by Swearengen and Farnum and eventually is killed over the debacle. That's about as far as I'll go getting into the series. Here's the episodes and some thoughts:1. Deadwood-Cool pilot episode. Interesting twist at the end and a pretty good cliffhanger.2. Deep Water-The dialouge is better than the 1st episode and it's funnier.3. Reconnoitering the Rim-The first episode on the second disc is a big improvement on the other two episodes. The dialogue here is very well written and witty...Quick question though. Did people in the Old West really say the word ""f**knut""?4. Here Was a Man-Easily the best episode so far and features a well-known historical event involving Wild Bill Hickok.5. The Trial of Jack McCall-Ian McShane gets better every episode. The title of the episode is decieving, because in the end you don't really care about the trial.6. Plague-The dialogue, including that in the final scene, is some of the best...But, this episode is not my favorite of the bunch.7. Bullock Returns to the Camp-My favorite episode so far. It's massively entertaining and has some of the best dialogue so far. Some new characters appear, which is nice.8. Suffer the Little Children-One of the most intense scenes of the entire show haappens here...This is one of the best episodes and they just keep getting better.9. No Other Sons or Daughters-This episode isn't bad, but it's one of the duller episodes...But, it's kind of funny at the same time.10. Mister Wu-The Wu character is very funny,  the first five minutes of the episode were hilarious. You also geet to see Ian McShane's character hit the peak of his evilness.11. Jewel's Boot is Made for Walking-This episode was written by Ricky Jay and involves the handicapped chick Jewel, who works for Swearengen, trying to get a leg brace. Jay obviously knows the show pretty well and the end of the show is great.12.

And as a big fan of post-modern westerns like Cormac McCarthy's novels and There Will Be Blood, I figured Deadwood would fit the bill.  Unfortunately, the show disappoints.  All the dialogue is dense bloviation, peppered with profanity.  The actors often don't even seem to understand the words they're reading and the profanity, apparently, isn't historically accurate.  Timothy Olyphant is miscast as a gritty former sheriff prone to violence.Whatever its faults, you have to credit Deadwood for a few truly great performances, especially Ian McShane as an amoral saloonkeeper, pimp and opium peddler.  His voice is as cracked and leathery as an old saddle.

I really can't stand week to week serials with three months or more between seasons. So I hunkered down last weekend and over three days watched all three seasons. What a treat! So many fine characters: Keith Caradine as Wild Bill was deadpan perfect, Robin Weigert was the foul-mouthed drunk with a soft spot for Bill, the children, and the pox victims that I've been hoping to see since I first encountered her in The Plainsman (though I have to admit Ellen Barkin was a turn-on in Wild Bill--too much of a turn-on unfortunately). Gerald McRaney was a coward cold as ice always ready to hire the Pinkertons to do his dirty work. But it was Ian McShane as Al Swearingen who stole the show for me--what a tough, nasty sonofabitch--though Powers Boothe (an actor I've always felt was under-rated) was also fine as a mean dandy with a crush on Tricksie, which never stopped him from beating the hell out of her if he thought she needed it. Loved Charlie Utter too. Rough and uneducated as he was, he seemed to me to be the true moral center of the show. All of which would have led me to give Deadwood 5 stars except for the rather bland performance by Timothy Olyphant, who seemed to express every repressed emotion as though he were about to have a stroke.

Yes, it does take a little while to tune into, but you might want to consider doing a little homework before you shoot your mouth off about it being dumb, trivial, or especially  ""unrealistic"".Milch painstakingly researched the history of the period and the kind of language used, and in fact a large part of the show's project is about how the use of such language fits into a scenario where people are trying to establish order and civilization in a brutal, wild area.  The amount of swearing in gold rush areas like Deadwood was huge and there were many reasons for it.  One of the big ones is that the same words could be used in a variety of contexts to convey emotion and intention without having to reveal anything about oneself in terms of content, which could be dangerous.  In a place like Deadwood, revealing personal information incautiously could quickly get you killed.He substituted contemporary swear words for antiquated ones because the old-fashioned ones would sound silly to us, and would add an element of unintentional comedy that would detract from the drama.  For instance, I believe ""dern"" was a fairly filthy word back then.  How scary is it going to be if a ruthless killer gets mad and calls someone a ""dern hornswaggler"" or somesuch?  Contemporary swear words are able to have a wide variety of often visceral effects on us as viewers, which is the whole point.

Swanson,"[1, 1]","""God bless you, Mister Swearengen!""""Well, not likely.But my short term prospects just improved.""A completely separate beast from all other tv westerns, Deadwood sparkles with superior writing, direction, and performances, especially Ian McShane's beguilingly nasty turn as Jim Swearengen.I watched a bit of this on HBO in 2004 then decided to wait to see it all at once on dvd. Glad I did, for the whole series plays out as well as The Sopranos. Compulsively watchable, a mixed delight of humor and horror, Deadwood is yet another bar-raising series from HBO, whose shows are so far ahead of normal tv that it seems something of a joke.I love old westerns, and this takes all the tropes and ratchets them up a notch or three. The language seems at last to be, after so many sanitized westerns, what you would have really heard back then. It's all so believable and yet so well-paced and crisply penned that there's nothing left to ask for: you just sit back and marvel.If you like westerns at all, or just excellent writing and fine dramatic craft, this is one not to be missed.And hey, casting agents of Hollywood: McShane is one of the very best character players alive. What are you doing throwing him bit parts in stuff like Death Race? He should be leading man in any number of big budget movies. The guy has the goods.

Bernabo,"[170, 201]","Of all of the HBO series that I have watched in their entirety, I think ""Deadwood"" is the weakest of the lot (the other are ""The Sopranos,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and ""Carniv&agrave;le"").  However, before I convince you this is damning with faint praise I would add that ""Deadwood"" is one of the ten best shows on television and that it has one of the most captivating characters around with Ian McShane's Al Swearengen, the profane overlord of the frontier town as the owner of the Gem Saloon.  Ironically, Al is so good at being bad, with his fingers in every pie in town and always looking for more, that he ends up dominating all of his scenes and all of the other characters.""Deadwood"" was created by David Milch, who always gets mentioned as being the creator of ""NYPD Blue,"" but whom I always laud as the writer of ""Trial by Fury,"" the third season premier episode of ""Hill Street Blues,"" which remains on my personal list of ten best television episodes I have ever seen.  To jog your memory, it is the one where a nun is raped and murdered and Frank Furillo coerces a confession from one of the killers by threatening to drop charges and have them released to an angry public.  The threat was of vigilante justice, which is certainly an element of ""Deadwood.""The time is 1876, which is when the nation's centennial was soured by the news of Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn.  Deadwood is in the South Dakota Territory, where statehood threatens to bring law and order, which the locals consider more of a threat than Indian attack.  The men play cards, get drunk, and dream of mining for gold, which allows them to indulge in more gambling, drinking, with money left over for buying the services of a woman for a night as well.  This is not the glorious West of Manifest Destiny or even Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis, but a cesspool of human existence that is the gateway to the gold of the Black Hills.Our entry into this world is the arrival Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), a former lawman from Montana who arrives with his buddy, Sol Starr (John Hawkes), intending to open by a hardware business and make their fortune off those who want to make their own by mining for gold.  They have to deal with Swearengen to get their operation going, but Bullock becomes acquainted with Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine).  Circumstances force the pair together a couple of times and they are similar in temperament, morals, and ability to shoot a gun and they become friendly, but not friends.  Of course, if there is one thing we know about Wild Bill, it is that he is no long for this world.Also in this world are some rather interesting women, especially Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), who is the second most fascinating character on the show.  She loves Wild Bill even though it will never be reciprocated and when he plays his last hand of poker (two pairs, black aces and black eights) she has to find a new reason for living.  Then there is Trixie (Paula Malcomson)  a prostitute who ends up caring for a young girl who is suddenly orphaned by one of Swearengen's machinations, and Alma Garret (Molly Parker), who comes from the East with her husband and suddenly finds herself a widow and a claim that might not be worthless.  If you want to talk about the most desperate women on television, then check out this trio.In Milch's Deadwood the vermin are always interesting and my attention is most drawn to the Brad Dourif's Doc Cochran, who stubbornly insists on doing the right thing in a  world where right and wrong are irrelevant concepts, and William Sanderson as Eustis Baily (E.B.) Farnum, who thinks obsequiousness translates into something that somehow approaches confidence in the service of Al Swearengen.  Everything in Deadwood comes back to Swearengen, literally.  We get the feeling that Bullock is supposed to be the force for good to counter Swearengen in Deadwood, but we have no reason to believe they are in the same league.  Powers Booth shows up as Tolliver, ostensibly Swearengen's new competition in the saloon business, but we do not think he stands a chance either.The only thing more omnipresent that Swearengen and his assorted interests on ""Deadwood"" is the constant swearing.  For Swearengen profanity is not just an art form but necessary verbal punctuation, and for many of the characters swearing is on a par with breathing (especially for Calamity Jane).  Milch research the historic Deadwood and has justified the language on that basis, but the profanity is part of the texture, as much as the art design, the sets, and the costumes.  If you want a constant reminder that the rules of civilization do not apply here, then all the foul language suffices.  I bet the demographics on this show skew more male than ""Monday Night Football.""Ultimately, with this HBO series the comparison is not to network television shows but rather the genre of the Adult Western that can be traced back to ""High Noon"" and ""Shane.""  But Milch pushes it to a time and place that predates those particular morality plays.  Those mortals stupid enough to want to have a civilized impulse in a place like Deadwood quickly learn to hide it or sublimate it in some way that might keep them alive another day.  In the end, the dreamers in Deadwood are not the ones who picture personal riches, the benefits of statehood, or a honest man wearing a badge bringing law and order to this hell hole, but those wretched individuals who actually think they will live to see another day and that such a day might be worth living.",5,"David Milch turns ""Deadwood"" into the Wild Wicked West",1103414400,"12 19,

865909,A383PPSVXNB0NB,B0006FO5LO,Leigh Fitzpatrick,"[9, 12]","My wife and I really like the first season.  Set in a mining camp in the Dakota territory, the series brings together good guys, bad guys, and others whose ultimate motives are revealed in very clever ways.  The 'feel' of the series is authentic, with muddy streets, realistic clothing and dialog.One thing we love about the series is that the characters are extremely complex.  I said earlier that the series has its good guys and bad guys and while that's true, the actors bring out layers of complexity in their characters that at times you empathize with the bad guys while the good guys reveal through their actions and words a kind of hypocrisy.  It's fascinating.Case in point is the character of Al Swearengen, a blood soaked, larger than life criminal and owner of the Gem Saloon who adheres to the ""knowlege is power"" credo....his informants seem to be everywhere.  Brutal, profane, and cruel, the writers use clever devices to bring out his backstory with its own take on the nurture versus nature debate.  He is also capable of surprising compassion.  Ian McShane's portrayal of this complex character is masterful.On the flip side is Seth Bullock, one of Deadwood's `good guys.'  Yet there is no white hat here....the former marshal possesses a hair trigger temper, a streak of brutality, and a moral code that can get rather muddy.Many of the secondary characters are just as riveting as the headliners.  E.B. Farnum, owner of the town's hotel and Swearengen's lackey, is like gum on the shoe that you can't scrape off.  He pokes his nose into everything and after a while you wonder about who is playing who. Farnum isn't revealing everything he knows or what his ultimate motives are.  Dan Dority, Swearengen's heavy, is another character who, despite his thuggish trade, is capable of tenderness and mercy.The bottom line here is that all of these characters feel fully developed and full-blooded.  It's a fascinating study of life in the old West.The ""But"" here is the language....one of the hot topics in these reviews.  Unfortunately, I've noticed that the reviewers who take umbrage at any critique of the profanity do so under the unthinking assumption that objections to profanity must be morality based, and that's not always true.  My wife and I are not prudes and we understand that the mining camps were wild and profane places. But sometimes it feels like David Milch, finally free of network television's constraints, writes like a kid joyfully spewing swearwords because his parents are nowhere around. At times it feels forced and overdone. We get that the camps were profane places....but the swearing sometimes is more of a distraction than a needed tone setter.  It detracts from some otherwise great dialog.",4,"Complex and fascinating series, with a small ""but""",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2742,"['wife', 'really', 'first', 'season', 'Set', 'mining', 'camp', 'Dakota', 'territory', 'series', 'together', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'others', 'ultimate', 'motives', 'are', 'revealed', 'very', 'clever', 'ways', ""'feel"", 'series', 'authentic', 'muddy', 'streets', 'realistic', 'clothing', 'dialog.One', 'thing', 'love', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'complex', 'said', 'earlier', 'series', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'true', 'actors', 'bring', 'out', 'layers', 'complexity', 'characters', 'times', 'empathize', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'reveal', 'actions', 'words', 'kind', 'hypocrisy', 'fascinating.Case', 'point', 'character', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'blood', 'soaked', 'larger', 'life', 'criminal', 'owner', 'Gem', 'Saloon', 'who', 'knowlege', 'power', 'credo', '.his', 'informants', 'seem', 'be', 'everywhere', 'Brutal', 'profane', 'cruel', 'writers', 'use', 'clever', 'devices', 'bring', 'out', 'backstory', 'own', 'take', 'nurture', 'versus', 'nature', 'debate', 'also', 'capable', 'surprising', 'compassion', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'portrayal', 'complex', 'character', 'flip', 'side', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'one', 'Deadwood', 'good', 'guys', 'white', 'hat', 'here', '.the', 'former', 'marshal', 'hair', 'trigger', 'temper', 'streak', 'brutality', 'moral', 'code', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'muddy.Many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'riveting', 'headliners', 'E.B', 'Farnum', 'owner', 'town', 'hotel', 'Swearengen', 'lackey', 'gum', 'shoe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scrape', 'off', 'nose', 'everything', 'while', 'wonder', 'who', 'playing', 'who', 'Farnum', ""n't"", 'revealing', 'everything', 'what', 'ultimate', 'motives', 'are', 'Dan', 'Dority', 'Swearengen', 'heavy', 'character', 'who', 'thuggish', 'trade', 'capable', 'tenderness', 'mercy.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'here', 'characters', 'feel', 'fully', 'developed', 'full-blooded', 'fascinating', 'study', 'life', 'old', 'West.The', 'here', 'language', '.one', 'hot', 'topics', 'reviews', 'Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'reviewers', 'who', 'take', 'umbrage', 'critique', 'profanity', 'do', 'so', 'unthinking', 'assumption', 'objections', 'profanity', 'must', 'be', 'morality', 'based', 'not', 'always', 'true', 'wife', 'are', 'not', 'prudes', 'understand', 'mining', 'camps', 'were', 'wild', 'profane', 'places', 'David', 'Milch', 'finally', 'free', 'network', 'television', 'constraints', 'kid', 'joyfully', 'spewing', 'swearwords', 'parents', 'are', 'nowhere', 'around', 'times', 'forced', 'overdone', 'get', 'camps', 'were', 'profane', 'places', 'swearing', 'sometimes', 'more', 'distraction', 'needed', 'tone', 'setter', 'otherwise', 'great', 'dialog']",N/A

If extremely rude langauge and nudity offends you - do not watch this show.  Some question it's heavy use and felt it deterred from the story but I feel it added to the whole feel of the piece - the real grittiness of the move westward and what pioneering really meant.  Another tip for deciding whether to watch this show is to be prepared to think.  Every episode requires your full attention to follow the distinct language used (an artful mix of crude and erudite) as well as the numerous plotlines and characters connected to and intermixed with each.  This show was casted by a GENIUS.  There are no two-dimensional characters here, even the stereotypes are fascinating.  Ian McShane as the resident bad guy is brilliant and not so bad as we keep viewing the series and although it is hard to equal McShane's larger then life character, Timothy Olyphant as the good guy who treads the line does his best.  The surrounding characters are many and equally great and just plain fascinating.  I won't go into each and every character but every one shines - I mean who else would place a physically challenged actress in a role that gets no quarter and asks for none and makes the audience look for more (remember Gerri from Facts of Life?) or have Calamity Jane show her historic colors and not the folklored version?  And while not having these characters demeaned in any way by using these techniques show off the beauty of this one-of-a-kind show.  This series has all the usual elements (good vs. bad, love interests, plot twists, etc.) but it relays it with such masterful strokes that the viewer can't help but be awed...

The complaints I've read here are justified, certainly, but coming from people that can't seem to get past the cursing. Is that the only problem?It's okay to be set in your ways, used to the old fashioned vision of the ""old west"". It's okay to argue that people didn't talk like that, even though they did and still do. Perhaps not with the poetic brio they speak with in ""Deadwood"" but I know a few people who swear every other word--- I bet you do too. In fact you probably swear without even realizing that you're doing it, which is the mindset of the characters in Deadwood. These people aren't swearing as much as they are simply talking. They have tough backgrounds, and are eking out a living in a tough and dirty place. If they can't swear they can't talk.Did the cultured and educated Brom Garret and his wife Alma swear throughout the first season? No. Those characters were raised in high society, away from such brutish talk. In fact I learned a few new words listening to their dialogue. There is little that is unrealistic about the language in Deadwood in terms of the ""f(beep)ks"", ""c(beep)nts"" and the ""c(beep)k-suckers"". It not what they say that makes Deadwood's dialogue special, it's the way they do it. And yes there is a Shakespearean theatricality about it... it's a drama.People think of that period, ""the old west"", as a wild, romantic, kind of chivalrous time-the old west Hollywood created, where guys in black hats face off with guys in white hats on a deserted street, save for the tumbleweed that rolls past in the dusty breeze and Indians and Mexicans were bad. Movies of the past, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and soforth, were great films, great stories told their way in their time. Today, watching some of them would insult our intelligence (like Natalie Wood, the whitest woman ever, playing a Native American). Did you know that the ""high-noon showdown"" or the ""quick-draw"" duels we know originated from Japanese samurai films? The face off at sunset never happened in those days, the quick draw is a Hollywood creation. The Samurai probably never had quick draws either! It's all bulls(beep)t! Go figure. Ahh but I digress..The bottom line is that you can't argue about what ""really happened"" and you certainly can't say ""this isn't how people talked back then"". We weren't there, and no one alive today was (and if they are they probably wouldn't remember anyway). How many people speak in real life the way they do on ANY tv show (except reality tv---which is what drives most of us to HBO in the frist place). It's drama, liturature, it's entertainment.These characters are complex in spite of their lowly use of expletives. This show is more of a political drama than a Wild West film, presented as close to what the real place may have actually been like. There are gross historical inaccuracies, but it's not a history lesson. It's a drama.Can they rope in the cursing? Yeah. Why though? It's HBO. It's not for kids, or conservatives. You can take it or leave it, like all television.

865945,A1MOGEXNCBZE3U,B0006FO5LO,"M. Packham ""Stuart""","[9, 10]","Sitting through these twelve masterful episodes of television I couldn't help but think I should savour every minute. Deadwood ranks on even keel with the best of the HBO drama series, namely The Wire, The Sopranos and the first two seasons of Six Feet Under. It moves perhaps a bit more slowly than the aforementioned and is sparing in its shocking and riveting moments, but nevertheless maintains the viewer's attention from start to finish with some finely drawn characters and excellent plot points.Central to the show is Seth Bullock, the stern-faced ex-sheriff of Montana who comes to Deadwood, a law-free town not yet annexed to the United States, to start a hardware business with his Jewish partner Saul Starr. Upon arrival he immediately meets the ruthless, foul-mouthed Al Swearengen; the drunken, depressive Wild Bill Hicock; and the blustering, all-bark-and-no-bite Calamity Jane, to name but a few.The 'camp' of Deadwood runs on subsistence trade, gambling, prostitution, prospecting and drinking. Thus, for the entirety of the season we are kept within its mud-soaked streets and rickety wooden saloons. The people of Deadwood are many and varied, coming from miles around to find their fortunes in the hills or to start a business from scratch, or perhaps to claim property that will later be annexed and recognised by the United States as bona fide title.In this glorious context the story of Deadwood begins, and it would spoil the surprises of the show to reveal the multiple plot threads. Suffice to say that electrifying every scene that he's in is Swearengen, played by Ian McShane. His Swearengen is aptly put by a reviewer on this page as the Tony Soprano of the wild west. He's not all bad, but he's certainly no good. Also, ejecting from his mouth is a constant stream of profanity and put-downs to both his friends and enemies. McShane deserves every award in the book for his work. Timothy Olyphant plays Seth Bullock with a sense of implosive violence. Bullock forever just seems to be keeping his anger in check, and Olyphant plays the role with enough skill for us to see, at once, that he's kind hearted yet brimming with self-loathing.Like Carnivale, this show moves slowly.

For those of us who are fanatical viewers, the bonus disc is outstanding, and greatly enhances the enjoyment of the series. For those who are new to the program, I would suggest viewing the bonus disc first, to get a feel for the series prior to watching the first episode. There is nothing in the nature of a real spoiler on the disc, and I was very impressed with the features, especially the one on the history of Deadwood, the town. It includes photographs of the real people who were the inspiration for many of the characters in the series, and interviews with the actors who portray them.The plot of the series has been related elsewhere on this page, so I will not give a rundown of the storylines, except to say that they are skillfully entertwined. The relationships between the characters are complex, particularly the relationship between Al Swearengen and the prostitute Trixie, and the parallel relationship between rival saloon owner Cy Tolliver and his madame, Joanie. Al is more openly physically and emotionally abusive to Trixie than Tolliver is to Joanie (his abuse is more psychological). Be advised that this series is not for young children, as they may find many of the images disturbing, especially the violence and strong sexual themes. One small spoiler: The women introduced in the first season seem to have had a history of sexual abuse, starting as young girls, which is not spelled out directly, but is hinted at in the course of the episodes. Also, the language used is not for ""gentle viewers,"" who may be upset by the constant use of a certain phrase, but the shock value is over (or at least it was for me) by the second episode. There is also a very good feature about the language on the bonus disc.The sets, the music, and the writing are fantastic and the acting is outstanding. I was so happy that Ian McShane received a Golden Globe for his performance as Al, after the series was shamefully ignored at the Emmy Awards. Powers Booth, often overlooked when the awards are handed out, is equally good as Tolliver, while Keith Carradine puts in a memorable performance as Wild Bill Hickok. Robin Weigert, who is a new performer for me, does a wonderful turn as Calamity Jane, who is profane when drunk, but tender and caring when sober.The second season started on March 6th, and hold the promise of being every bit as good as the first season, with some new plot twists and turns.

Taking place in 1876 in the lawless town of Deadwood, former lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant, perfectly cast) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes) arrive in town to make a fresh start and, like almost everyone else in town, to make some lucrative business as well.  In the center of Deadwood is Al Swearengen (Golden Globe winner Ian McShane); a foul mouthed, blood soaked tyrant and saloon owner who quickly becomes one of the most mesmerizing, magnetic, and unforgettable villains in TV history.  Paths are also crossed with burned out outlaw Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his cohort Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), and that's only the beginning.  There's so much more going on in these 12 episodes that the complexity of it all will amaze you, and the star making turn of Olyphant and especially McShane will leave your jaw on the floor.  Also featuring Molly Parker, Powers Boothe, Paula Malcomson, and Brad Dourif; Deadwood features the most well assembled ensemble cast since Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana's Oz.

Despite their manifold differences there is a commonness of sepia tone, and both plumb equally cavernous philosophical depths: Intellectually, Deadwood is a meditation on anarchy in which Hobbesian pessimism is tested but falsified: in Deadwood, decent men (and strong women) prevail despite the poor odds - as long as you are prepared to be openminded about exactly what might count for decentness, at any rate.The first episode takes a while to catch fire - the brutalilty and nastiness is heaped on, and the narrative is spent establishing the hard-man credentials of most of the cast, and the dope-addled naivete of Alma Garrett and her patsy-written-all-over-him husband, fresh from New York to seek their fortune in the hills with the rest of the lowlife.But soon some things become clear. Primarily among them, Ian McShane - once BBC's loveable rogue antique dealer Lovejoy (I kid you not) has a peach of a part as the dastardly, but all the same loveable, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen, and he utterly nails it. A swear engine he certainly is - although matched in his cussatorial enthusiasm by the entire rest of the cast, McShane bullies, and cajoles, and wisecracks his way through the series with the experienced occular twinkle of a life-long loveable rogue, every appearance on the screen an utter joy to behold.McShane is perfectly cast - but is aided and abetted by a terrific supporting cast and a sublime script. Sublime, that is, if you don't mind the dictionary definition of ""a stupid or unpleasant person"" sprayed around. If repeated reference to ladies' nether regions, rendered agriculturally, isn't your bag, then nor is this show, by the way. But the blue language is matched by the inventively archaic dialogue which is simply wondrous, particularly in McShane's capable hands. One tip: the dialogue is rendered quickly at times and, as a single word is not to be missed, I found it useful to have the subtitles permanently on!Elsewhere the characterisation is beautifully played, with a succession of great double acts: Robin Seigert's Jane to Dayton Callie's Charlie Utter; William Sanderson's EB Farnum to Molly Parker's Alma Garrett, but mostly the fulcrum around which all relationships, dramatic impulse and sypathy revolves is the marvellous Al Swearengen.The production values are top notch, and if there were a weakness, it would be Timothy Olyphant's somewhat effete Seth Bullock: attempting the strong silent treatment, but not really pulling it off: A hard job, in any case, when everyone's rooting for Al.Olly Buxton",5,A slow-burning riot - take a bow Ian McShane,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,2881,"['Hard', 'heels', 'cinematic', 'mysticalCarnivale', 'HBO', 'out', 'gritty', 'puke-', 'blood', 'cuss-', 'mud-soaked', 'western', 'tracing', 'quasi-historical', 'fashion', 'days', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'others', 'pre-confederated', 'gold', 'prospecting', 'camp', 'called', 'Deadwood', 'what', 'nowadays', 'Dakota', 'manifold', 'differences', 'commonness', 'sepia', 'tone', 'plumb', 'equally', 'cavernous', 'philosophical', 'depths', 'Intellectually', 'Deadwood', 'meditation', 'anarchy', 'Hobbesian', 'pessimism', 'tested', 'falsified', 'Deadwood', 'decent', 'men', 'strong', 'women', 'prevail', 'poor', 'odds', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'prepared', 'be', 'openminded', 'about', 'exactly', 'what', 'might', 'count', 'decentness', 'rate.The', 'first', 'episode', 'while', 'catch', 'fire', 'brutalilty', 'nastiness', 'heaped', 'narrative', 'spent', 'establishing', 'hard-man', 'credentials', 'most', 'cast', 'dope-addled', 'naivete', 'Alma', 'Garrett', 'patsy-written-all-over-him', 'husband', 'fresh', 'New', 'York', 'seek', 'fortune', 'hills', 'rest', 'lowlife.But', 'soon', 'things', 'become', 'clear', 'Primarily', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'once', 'BBC', 'loveable', 'rogue', 'antique', 'dealer', 'Lovejoy', 'kid', 'not', 'peach', 'part', 'dastardly', 'same', 'loveable', 'Gem', 'Saloon', 'owner', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'utterly', 'swear', 'engine', 'certainly', 'matched', 'cussatorial', 'enthusiasm', 'entire', 'rest', 'cast', 'McShane', 'bullies', 'cajoles', 'way', 'series', 'experienced', 'occular', 'twinkle', 'life-long', 'loveable', 'rogue', 'appearance', 'screen', 'utter', 'joy', 'behold.McShane', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'aided', 'abetted', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sublime', 'script', 'Sublime', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dictionary', 'definition', 'stupid', 'unpleasant', 'person', 'sprayed', 'repeated', 'reference', 'ladies', 'nether', 'regions', 'rendered', 'agriculturally', ""n't"", 'bag', 'then', 'show', 'way', 'blue', 'language', 'matched', 'inventively', 'archaic', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'wondrous', 'particularly', 'McShane', 'capable', 'hands', 'One', 'tip', 'dialogue', 'rendered', 'quickly', 'times', 'single', 'word', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'found', 'useful', 'have', 'subtitles', 'permanently', 'Elsewhere', 'characterisation', 'beautifully', 'played', 'succession', 'great', 'double', 'acts', 'Robin', 'Seigert', 'Jane', 'Dayton', 'Callie', 'Charlie', 'Utter', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'EB', 'Farnum', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Alma', 'Garrett', 'mostly', 'fulcrum', 'relationships', 'dramatic', 'impulse', 'sypathy', 'revolves', 'marvellous', 'Al', 'Swearengen.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'were', 'weakness', 'would', 'be', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'somewhat', 'effete', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'attempting', 'strong', 'silent', 'treatment', 'not', 'really', 'pulling', 'off', 'hard', 'job', 'case', 'when', 'everyone', 'rooting', 'Al.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

It didn't. It has more focus on dialogue, but most of it is inconsequential. Like Carnivale, Deadwood relies on your commitment to absorbing the atmosphere of the show to maintain your interest. It's not going to win you over with it's plot, dialogue, or characters if you aren't already dedicated to liking the show on concept alone. Obviously I haven't lived in the 1800s but I don't find the way the characters talk very believable. It's like a Shakesperian take on 1800s America.

865962,A1TVP6C06M6ZKX,B0006FO5LO,"Paul Papadopoulos ""Kinky Greek""","[5, 7]","My son bought me the box set of season 1 for this past  Christmas in Ontario. As a fan of Lost and 24 Hours I was a bit sceptical because I never really liked Westerns. I actually fell asleep during the first  episode but this may have been due to  over indulgence in a Kosher Turkey on Boxing Day (the first fresh non-Kosher turkey rotted in the driveway on Christmas eve before the women of the household  remembered they had left it there). However, on returning home to Greece I doggedly watched the episode  that I had missed and realised that this brilliant series is about  strong  personalities and  micro power struggles in the  real Wild West of America before law and order have been established and is entirely different from the usual  western.  An order of sorts is  maintained via conventions by the chief town villains themselves, two rival  hotel,  bar and brothel  owners. Al Swearengen (a true historical character)  owner of the Gem Hotel played by the British arch villain  actor Ian McShane (remember his role as the villain  bank robbery promoter in Sexy Beast)  and  Cy Toliver played by Powers Boothe (whom I last remember  as the father of the lost boy in the Emerald Jungle and as the 1940s detective Philip Marlowe in the television series aired in the 1980s).  As in the case of the main villain  real historical events and people  have been fictionalised. So we  meet  characters such as Wild Bill Hickok  and Calamity Jane.  True to  history  Wild Bill is murdered while playing  cards in the Gem Hotel bar.The good guys, who open a hardware store together, are  Seth Bullock (played by Timothy Olyphant) and his  Jewish partner, Sol Star  (played by John Hawkes, the  liquor store  manage who comes to a sticky end in From Dusk to Dawn) are also based  on true Deadwood characters. The script is lively and fascinating as are the  multiple plot developments. By the end of episode two  one  begins to  disentangle the different elements in Deadwood.The cinematography is superb with just the right amount  of light, shadow and  dark ""whiskey"" tones to give a sense of the late 1870s period and its hurricane  lamp lighting (one can  almost smell the oil burning). The musical score is also excellent, while the casting  could not be better.  A wealth of good actors without  exception.  Aside from some steamy sex scenes there is a good deal of violence, with many of the victim's bodies donated to the Chinese  laundry man's pigs as fodder. One  wonders what spice such high protein  feed  gave to the  taste of local bacon, hams and pork ribs? The language is obscene to the extreme. The f-word is often used as a form of punctuation. I cannot  stop wondering whether  blasphemy would have not been  more common and damning than sexual references in late nineteenth century  swearing  (as it is still the case in modern Quebec). The swearing, sex  and violence is  mostly incidental but necessary for the right  atmosphere.Even The arch villain  Al Swearengen, evil as he is  portrayed,  is shown to have a human side, albeit a twisted  humanity of sorts. He generally murders or has people murdered that get in his way or annoy him, but  one  ""kind"" act by his perverse standards is when he smothers a dying preacher to  put him out of his agony (also to get rid of the noise the poor demented  cleric is making while  on his last legs). McShane's villain is indeed a complex  person but not without a sense of warped humour. The rival as portrayed  by Powers Boone is smooth, cool and wicked (though  more sparing than  Swearengen  in his  choice of the moment to murder a young couple who have robbed him as an example) without  even the slightest touch of  humour. Calamity Jane (admirably played by Robin Weigert)  provides the full range of humour needed as a comic relief to the grimness and severity  of the series  and is true to the historical character, being drunk most of the time  but  extremely fond of children.The real  hero of the series one, in my opinion is Doc Cochran  who administers to the medical needs of the whole town, including  treating a small pox epidemic as well as  carrying out the regular inspections of the town  prostitutes state of health and  providing vials of opium to a female drug addict. His fine unselfish humanity  in this hellish den of  iniquity - that Deadwood was - is revealed when he  produces  an effective prosthetic  device for the  unfortunate cripple who chars at the Gem Hotel and  accepts her request to  waltz with him once the device has been  fitted and she can move normally. The actor who plays the part of Doc  with the unlikely name of Brad Dourif, may be remembered from  his role as Grima Wormtongue in  the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",5,Deadwood not Dead in the Water,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,4737,"['son', 'bought', 'box', 'set', 'season', '1', 'past', 'Christmas', 'Ontario', 'fan', 'Lost', '24', 'Hours', 'was', 'bit', 'sceptical', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Westerns', 'actually', 'fell', 'asleep', 'first', 'episode', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'indulgence', 'Kosher', 'Turkey', 'Boxing', 'Day', 'first', 'fresh', 'non-Kosher', 'turkey', 'rotted', 'driveway', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'women', 'household', 'remembered', 'had', 'left', 'there', 'However', 'returning', 'home', 'Greece', 'doggedly', 'watched', 'episode', 'had', 'missed', 'realised', 'brilliant', 'series', 'strong', 'personalities', 'micro', 'power', 'struggles', 'real', 'Wild', 'West', 'America', 'law', 'order', 'have', 'been', 'established', 'entirely', 'different', 'usual', 'western', 'order', 'sorts', 'maintained', 'conventions', 'chief', 'town', 'two', 'rival', 'hotel', 'bar', 'brothel', 'owners', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'true', 'historical', 'character', 'owner', 'Gem', 'Hotel', 'played', 'British', 'arch', 'villain', 'actor', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'remember', 'role', 'villain', 'bank', 'robbery', 'promoter', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'Cy', 'Toliver', 'played', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'whom', 'last', 'remember', 'father', 'lost', 'boy', 'Emerald', 'Jungle', '1940s', 'detective', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'television', 'series', 'aired', '1980s', 'case', 'main', 'villain', 'real', 'historical', 'events', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'fictionalised', 'meet', 'characters', 'such', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'True', 'history', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'murdered', 'playing', 'cards', 'Gem', 'Hotel', 'bar.The', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'open', 'hardware', 'store', 'together', 'are', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Jewish', 'partner', 'Sol', 'Star', 'played', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'liquor', 'store', 'manage', 'who', 'sticky', 'end', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Dawn', 'are', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'Deadwood', 'characters', 'script', 'lively', 'fascinating', 'are', 'multiple', 'plot', 'developments', 'end', 'episode', 'two', 'one', 'disentangle', 'different', 'elements', 'Deadwood.The', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'light', 'shadow', 'dark', 'whiskey', 'tones', 'give', 'sense', 'late', '1870s', 'period', 'hurricane', 'lamp', 'lighting', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'oil', 'burning', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'excellent', 'casting', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'wealth', 'good', 'actors', 'exception', 'Aside', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'good', 'deal', 'violence', 'many', 'victim', 'bodies', 'donated', 'Chinese', 'laundry', 'man', 'pigs', 'fodder', 'One', 'spice', 'such', 'high', 'protein', 'feed', 'gave', 'taste', 'local', 'bacon', 'hams', 'pork', 'ribs', 'language', 'obscene', 'extreme', 'f-word', 'often', 'used', 'form', 'punctuation', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'wondering', 'blasphemy', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'more', 'common', 'damning', 'sexual', 'references', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'swearing', 'still', 'case', 'modern', 'Quebec', 'swearing', 'sex', 'violence', 'mostly', 'incidental', 'necessary', 'right', 'arch', 'villain', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'evil', 'portrayed', 'shown', 'have', 'human', 'side', 'twisted', 'humanity', 'sorts', 'generally', 'people', 'murdered', 'get', 'way', 'annoy', 'one', 'kind', 'act', 'perverse', 'standards', 'when', 'dying', 'preacher', 'put', 'agony', 'also', 'get', 'rid', 'noise', 'poor', 'demented', 'cleric', 'making', 'last', 'legs', 'McShane', 'villain', 'indeed', 'complex', 'person', 'not', 'sense', 'warped', 'humour', 'rival', 'portrayed', 'Powers', 'Boone', 'smooth', 'cool', 'wicked', 'more', 'sparing', 'Swearengen', 'choice', 'moment', 'murder', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'robbed', 'example', 'even', 'slightest', 'touch', 'humour', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'admirably', 'played', 'Robin', 'Weigert', 'full', 'range', 'humour', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'grimness', 'severity', 'series', 'true', 'historical', 'character', 'being', 'drunk', 'most', 'time', 'extremely', 'fond', 'children.The', 'real', 'hero', 'series', 'one', 'opinion', 'Doc', 'Cochran', 'who', 'medical', 'needs', 'whole', 'town', 'including', 'treating', 'small', 'pox', 'epidemic', 'as', 'well', 'carrying', 'out', 'regular', 'inspections', 'town', 'state', 'health', 'providing', 'vials', 'opium', 'female', 'drug', 'addict', 'fine', 'unselfish', 'humanity', 'hellish', 'den', 'iniquity', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'revealed', 'when', 'effective', 'prosthetic', 'device', 'unfortunate', 'cripple', 'who', 'Gem', 'Hotel', 'request', 'waltz', 'once', 'device', 'been', 'fitted', 'can', 'move', 'normally', 'actor', 'who', 'part', 'Doc', 'unlikely', 'name', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'may', 'be', 'remembered', 'role', 'Grima', 'Wormtongue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy']",N/A

""Ginger Vitus""","[2, 2]","Being a faithful viewer of American history-based television programs and series, I feel comfortable offering a brief evaluation of Deadwood, season 1.  Let me begin by saying that I did not watch the series during its original run and have only now seen the first complete season. Most of us can probably agree that HBO has a history of producing high-quality TV entertainment, and this series is an honorable addition to that legacy. Deadwood (season 1) isn't ""The Sopranos"", but it runs a respectable close second, begging the question...why was the plug pulled after only 3 seasons? Surely it was not limited by a lack of a rich era as its backdrop or a storyline that simply dried up. On the contrary, it would seem that the series' talented creator and writer, David Milch, could write about a stale sandwich and make it interesting.Season 1 flowed very nicely. (I'm a little embarrased to admit that I watched all 12 hrs within a 24 hr period). As is often the case in television these days, characters in this series seem over the top and hard to identify with, much less like. Although far from being a prude, I felt the extreme use of profanity was unnecessary and at times gratuitous. However, I would bet that this interpretation of life in a late 19th century mining town is more closely depicted than in anything on film previously. As a historian opined on the bonus featurette: ""there were no black or white hats in Deadwood. Only hats in varying shades of grey"".I guess the best endorsement I can give is that I ordered Season 2 as soon as I finished watching Season 1.

Crawford,"[4, 4]","This is the kind of quality that I have come to expect from HBO:  an original story line that mixes in some historical truth, absolutely superlative and multi-facetted acting for complex characters, and an atmosphere that powerfully evokes a community.  Once you get with the characters, this is completely and utterly mesmerizing, some of the best TV that has ever been done imho.There are many daringly brutal lowlife sociopathic types, such as the bar owners, but there are also good people with potential to become great leaders and caretakers.  Ok, the sleaze predominates the first season without a doubt, but most of them have some pathos (with a few exceptions) and often a good deal humor and irony to them.  The presentation of historical characters, such as Hickock and Calamity Jane, is stimulating and very fun.  I looked a number of them up to learn their bios.  But the hangers-on and minor folks, such as the doctor, the preacher, and the crippled washer woman, are also wonderfully drawn and evolving, often into something that cannot be predicted.  I think that there is real depth of theme there, however cynical it might appear to more naive viewers.The plot, if there is one to be summed up, is how a gold-rush town on the frontier grows and is in search of its soul as a functioning community.  There appear to be good guys and bad, but it is often more complex than that.  Immigrants keep arriving, witnessing the struggle for power and then becoming actors in it.  In the first year, you see Deadwood evolve from a government-less spot in the middle of Indian Territory into a candidate for statehood.

865994,AFLTHO3MB4825,B0006FO5LO,Robert J. Willert,"[15, 39]","I remember watching Clint Eastwood's brilliant 'Unforgiven'. I enjoyed the film not only for the actor's performance, but because he showed us what the old west might be really like. 'Wild Bill' (Jeff Bridges) was another realistic version of the old west. What made these two westerns worth watching were the characters and the dialogue. 'Lonesome Dove' and even portions of 'Heaven's Gate' are two others...I can go on about westerns that tried to show us the way it probably was in the mid to late 1800's. Now HBO comes up with the same idea - try to show the TV audience what it was like in the old west. Okay. I'm for that. I grew up with 'Gunsmoke' and 'Bonanza' and 'The Rifleman'. Great westerns, but not very realistic I suppose. What the producers did with 'Deadwood' was hire a lot of good character actors to play key parts. Powers Boothe, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Ian McShane, Keith Carradine (as Hickock). Good actors all. What's the most troubling about this western series, and I won't point my finger only at 'Deadwood' but also at a host of TV shows and movies today, is it's language. Censors cannot censor what we see on cable, so HBO knows it can get away with it. Gratuitous violence, sex, and language is the name of the game these days. Critics today have called 'Deadwood' brilliant writing. What is brilliant about it? 'High Noon' starring Gary Cooper was considered brilliant for its day. 'Unforgiven' was given the Best Picture Oscar because of its depiction of the old west. That was only 14 years ago. Now characters in 'Deadwood' are using the 'F' word in every sentence. In every scene I can anticipate that every character with lines will speak some kind of profanity. It's as if they brought the old west into some 2006 comedy club where all they do is swear. 'Deadwood' would be comical if the sets and the violence and the sex weren't so depressing to watch. There is nothing comical about 'Deadwood', but there is nothing really interesting about the show either. Even though 'Bonanza' was corny and even though Matt Dillon of 'Gunsmoke' usually always got his man, these were good, quality shows that kept our interest because of characters we enjoyed. Why couldn't the producers of 'Deadwood' create characters that we can enjoy and still show us the realism of the wild west? A little swearing doesn't bother me. But when the swearing seems out of place, and the profanity here isn't only relegated to the 'F' word (they use every #@*#@!!! in the book) it becomes ridiculous. I have read many of the '5 star' reviews. I am not knocking the whole show. It has its moments. But putting a good western together means developing good characters and strong dialogue (they always go hand in hand). Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln giving a speech and including the 'F' word in it a number of times? What if the writers of this show showed how Custer died at the Little Big Horn and some of his last words to the charging Indians included the 'F' word? What were Wild Bill's final words in real life? Of course it IS known Calamity Jane was not a looker (not like here or in other depictions) and WAS known for her salty language. There is no doubt that in the old west, as it is true today, people used foul language. But in 'Deadwood' the language doesn't seem to come natually to these characters. It's as if the director is telling the actors to say their lines while inserting profanity wherever the actor sees fit (improvised profanity rarely works in the show - it just sounds stupid and unreal). 'Deadwood' could've been a quality show, and they certainly had some good ideas. However, HBO decided that their emphasis on gratuitous sex and violence and profanity as the show's main selling point was all they needed for the show to be a big hit. Luckily for the viewers of HBO's quality programs, 'Deadwood' has been cancelled. A note to 'Deadwood's' producers. 'Gunsmoke lasted 18 years. 'Bonanza' lasted 14 years (and would have lasted longer had Dan Blocker lived). Though today's young writers and producers may think these shows as silly by today's standards, they were very popular with audiences. Even though as viewers we eventually outgrow some of these old TV shows, we will never outgrow quality TV and good old fashioned filmmaking.",2,"'Deadwood' looks real enough, but do we really need that language???",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,4291,"['remember', 'watching', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'brilliant', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'actor', 'performance', 'showed', 'what', 'old', 'west', 'might', 'be', 'really', 'like', ""'Wild"", 'Bill', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'realistic', 'version', 'old', 'west', 'What', 'made', 'two', 'westerns', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'Dove', 'even', 'portions', ""'Heaven"", 'Gate', 'are', 'two', 'others', 'can', 'go', 'about', 'westerns', 'tried', 'show', 'way', 'probably', 'was', 'mid', 'late', '1800', 'Now', 'HBO', 'up', 'same', 'idea', 'try', 'show', 'TV', 'audience', 'what', 'was', 'old', 'west', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'grew', 'up', ""'Gunsmoke"", ""'Bonanza"", 'Rifleman', 'Great', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'suppose', 'What', 'producers', 'did', ""'Deadwood"", 'was', 'hire', 'lot', 'good', 'character', 'actors', 'play', 'key', 'parts', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Hickock', 'Good', 'actors', 'What', 'most', 'troubling', 'western', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'point', 'finger', 'only', ""'Deadwood"", 'also', 'host', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'today', 'language', 'Censors', 'can', 'not', 'censor', 'what', 'see', 'cable', 'so', 'HBO', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'Gratuitous', 'violence', 'sex', 'language', 'name', 'game', 'days', 'Critics', 'today', 'have', 'called', ""'Deadwood"", 'brilliant', 'writing', 'What', 'brilliant', 'Noon', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'considered', 'brilliant', 'day', 'was', 'given', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'depiction', 'old', 'west', 'was', 'only', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'characters', ""'Deadwood"", 'are', 'using', 'F', 'word', 'sentence', 'scene', 'can', 'anticipate', 'character', 'lines', 'will', 'speak', 'kind', 'profanity', 'brought', 'old', 'west', '2006', 'comedy', 'club', 'where', 'do', 'swear', ""'Deadwood"", 'would', 'be', 'comical', 'sets', 'violence', 'sex', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'depressing', 'watch', 'nothing', 'comical', ""'Deadwood"", 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'show', 'either', 'Even', ""'Bonanza"", 'was', 'corny', 'even', 'Matt', 'Dillon', ""'Gunsmoke"", 'usually', 'always', 'got', 'man', 'were', 'good', 'quality', 'shows', 'kept', 'interest', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'producers', ""'Deadwood"", 'create', 'characters', 'can', 'enjoy', 'still', 'show', 'realism', 'wild', 'west', 'little', 'swearing', ""n't"", 'bother', 'when', 'swearing', 'place', 'profanity', 'here', ""n't"", 'only', 'relegated', 'F', 'word', 'use', '@', '*', '@', 'book', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'read', 'many', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'knocking', 'whole', 'show', 'moments', 'putting', 'good', 'western', 'together', 'developing', 'good', 'characters', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'always', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'giving', 'speech', 'including', 'F', 'word', 'number', 'times', 'What', 'writers', 'show', 'showed', 'how', 'Custer', 'died', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'last', 'words', 'charging', 'Indians', 'included', 'F', 'word', 'What', 'were', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'final', 'words', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'known', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'was', 'not', 'looker', 'not', 'here', 'other', 'depictions', 'WAS', 'known', 'salty', 'language', 'doubt', 'old', 'west', 'true', 'today', 'people', 'used', 'foul', 'language', ""'Deadwood"", 'language', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'natually', 'characters', 'director', 'telling', 'actors', 'say', 'lines', 'inserting', 'profanity', 'actor', 'fit', 'improvised', 'profanity', 'rarely', 'show', 'just', 'stupid', 'unreal', ""'Deadwood"", 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quality', 'show', 'certainly', 'had', 'good', 'ideas', 'However', 'HBO', 'decided', 'emphasis', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence', 'profanity', 'show', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'was', 'needed', 'show', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'Luckily', 'viewers', 'HBO', 'quality', 'programs', ""'Deadwood"", 'been', 'cancelled', 'note', ""'Deadwood"", 'producers', ""'Gunsmoke"", 'lasted', '18', 'years', 'lasted', '14', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'had', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'lived', 'today', 'young', 'writers', 'producers', 'may', 'think', 'shows', 'silly', 'today', 'standards', 'were', 'very', 'popular', 'audiences', 'Even', 'viewers', 'eventually', 'outgrow', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'will', 'never', 'outgrow', 'quality', 'TV', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'filmmaking']",N/A

And also, I understand &#34;Deadwood&#34;'s creator's (David Milch) use of modern profanity because he wants to project an air of &#34;darkness and evil&#34; during a time when the F-bomb was not in constant use.  He is quoted as saying that if he had used the historically accurate curses in these characters mouths, &#34;they would all have sounded like Yosemite Sam&#34;.  Be that as it may, its constant use here serves only as an aural assault against his audience, and does not add one wit to his themes.  It is an utter distraction, and always keeps us rooted HERE in 2014 rather than there in 1876.But beyond the gratuitous and constant swearing (which does reveal a lack of imagination on the writers' part), there is the adolescent obsessive-compulsive preoccupation with the genitalia of both males and females in this series which very quickly grows obnoxious.  Much thought has gone into the various and sundry ways in which graphic verbal description can be given to the male completion of the act of fornication.  Again, it adds nothing to &#34;Deadwood&#34; and only flash-forwards us into modern porno.  I hesitate to explore in my own mind any further into that of the creator here.Most of the actors turn in adequate performances, with the exception of Calamity Jane.  Robin Weigert talks like a buffoon out of the side of her mouth, as if she has just inhaled a plate of mashed potatoes.  I had no sympathy for the character, and just cringed in empathy for the performer.  Perhaps she just needed the work?  Also, the multiple plot-lines are difficult enough to follow, what with all the mixed messages and constant cussing, and then someone decided to use the same actor (without explanation in the plot) to play two different characters.  Yes, Garret Dillahunt, who portrays Buffalo Bill's killer in Season One, is the same actor used to play Hearst's geologist in Season Two.Finally, there are some tedious soliloquies which prove that some of these writers can actually put together a coherent thought or two and make it historically accurate, but they are too little and too far between.  Add that to the lack of any real action in most of the episodes, and it makes for one long slog through to get to the end, if not the point.  This thing is being presented as &#34;much nominated and award-winning&#34;, but I cannot understand for what.  Certainly not writing, acting, or producing.  The only thing &#34;real&#34; here would be the set decorations and costuming.  It is filmed with a solid feel, the boards and wood heavy and real, instead of the usual Hollywood back-lot store fronts.

866006,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0006FO5LO,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","One of my favorite childhood memories comes from Deadwood Gulch.  During a cross-country road trip, my family stopped here during a heavy storm and my brother and I were thrilled to have front-row seats for ""The Trial of Jack McCall,"" a vaudeville production of the trial of the murderer of Wild Bill Hickock.  Of all the things we saw that trip, my brother and I still talk about that show.So imagine my delight at seeing an entire TV series dedicated to Deadwood, that infamous frontier settlement where Wild Bill met his end.  I was even more delighted because ""Deadwood"" is an HBO production, and HBO has quite simply made the best TV series over the past decade.Even with all that hype, I was not prepared to like ""Deadwood"" as much as I did.  Created by David Milch, this is a sumptuous, profane, dirty, conflicted, sexy, and hilarious series populated by characters who get under your skin and into your hearts.  What more can one ask for?""Deadwood"" revolves around the sordid lives of a bizarre cast of characters.  The ""town"" is actually a mere ""camp"" at the outset of the story, set in the days following Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn.  Not part of any state or territory, the camp has no sanctioned law enforcement authority.  This dubious fact, coupled with the local gold rush, makes Deadwood the land of opportunity for America's thrill-seekers, fortune hunters, desperados, and adventurers.What local law there is can be found in the corrupt soul of Al Swearengen (Ian McShane).  Swearengen runs the only saloon in town and has his fingers into virtually every pie.  His saloon, the ""Gem,"" is an NC-17 version of Rick's Cafe in ""Casablanca"" - everyone goes there, but not everyone walks out.Swearengen's hold on Deadwood is threatened by two men - Seth Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and Wild Bill Hickock (Keith Carradine).  Hickock is the only man in town Swearengen fears, but Swearengen knows that Hickock is too focused on his private demons to care a whit for Swearengen's plots and schemes.  Bullock is another matter.  A former marshall from Montana, Bullock is ruthless but wants to live a quiet life, opening a hardware store.  But it is clear that Bullock and Swearengen are going to be the two leading characters in this drama . . . and they are going to butt heads.""Deadwood"" is populated by a large, rich cast of characters, too many to list here.  My personal favorite is Doc Cochran, played with exquisite rage and humanity by Brad Dourif.  But other key players include E.B. Farnum (William Sanderson), Swearengen's flunky and ultimate mayor of Deadwood, Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe), the proprietor of a rival saloon that opens up mid-season, and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert).Deadwood is the kind of town where murderers as well as businessmen have standing agreements with the local Chinese pigkeepers to dispose of dead bodies by feeding them to the pigs.  It is also a town that is susceptible to plague, local Sioux raids, and the prospect of imminent statehood . . . which can be either a joyous boon or the destruction of paradise, depending on which character you're talking to.Just as with HBO's other period series ""Carnivale,"" look for a dirty, realistic setting for these wonderful characters.  Virtually no character represents an archetype - all have their flaws and virtues, hopes and dreams.

M.Silver ""Lobo(AW)""","[11, 15]","As a former historian, I tend to cringe when Hollywood tries to portray actual events and since ""Deadwood"" takes place during my area of concentration (Civil War to present), I was very concerned. Well, I've been delighted. Certainly there's been some playing with history but the basic thrust has been accurate. I wondered if they would be willing to have such a dominant character as Wild Bill die but they did. The struggle for control of the camp's destiny is a reasonable portrayal of what took place. The main characters did exist (the real Al was an even more viscious person than in the series) and largely were of the type portrayed. And the language... What happened in the 19th Century was that publishers refused to print accurate portrayals of frontier language, a curious mix of earthy profanity and deliberate efforts to appear of a higher class (you see some of this with the large number of people who dress formally with coats, ties, and vests even when manual laborers; this is far more so than today where the reverse is true and people try to portray themselves of a lower class than they are). In any case, the literature of the 19th Century frontier is utterly free of profanity because of that censorship and, as a result, we've seldom heard an accurate portrayal of their language. Bringing this element into the series must have been a tough decision but it gives ""Deadwood"" a unique, historically accurate sound. Undoubtedly some will find this at least initially shocking and distracting but it is hardly the most important thing about the series. The complex story lines and brilliant acting, at least for me, more than off-set any disturance I might have had at first hearing their crude yet elegant language. One other point - the lovely thing about the DVD set is that you can go back and see things again and often I have found myself picking up on bits of dialogue and nuances of acting that I had overlooked the first time (or two) through.",5,Remarkably accurate in actions and language,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1975,"['former', 'historian', 'tend', 'cringe', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'portray', 'actual', 'events', 'Deadwood', 'place', 'area', 'concentration', 'Civil', 'War', 'present', 'was', 'very', 'concerned', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'delighted', 'Certainly', 'been', 'playing', 'history', 'basic', 'thrust', 'been', 'accurate', 'wondered', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'have', 'dominant', 'character', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'die', 'did', 'struggle', 'control', 'camp', 'destiny', 'reasonable', 'portrayal', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'exist', 'real', 'Al', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'viscious', 'person', 'series', 'largely', 'were', 'type', 'portrayed', 'language', 'What', 'happened', '19th', 'Century', 'was', 'publishers', 'refused', 'print', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'frontier', 'language', 'curious', 'mix', 'earthy', 'profanity', 'deliberate', 'efforts', 'appear', 'higher', 'class', 'see', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'dress', 'formally', 'coats', 'ties', 'vests', 'even', 'when', 'manual', 'laborers', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'where', 'reverse', 'true', 'people', 'try', 'portray', 'lower', 'class', 'are', 'case', 'literature', '19th', 'Century', 'frontier', 'utterly', 'free', 'profanity', 'censorship', 'result', ""'ve"", 'seldom', 'heard', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'language', 'Bringing', 'element', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'decision', 'Deadwood', 'unique', 'historically', 'accurate', 'sound', 'Undoubtedly', 'will', 'find', 'least', 'initially', 'shocking', 'distracting', 'hardly', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'series', 'complex', 'story', 'lines', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'least', 'more', 'off-set', 'disturance', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'first', 'hearing', 'crude', 'yet', 'elegant', 'language', 'One', 'other', 'point', 'lovely', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'things', 'again', 'often', 'have', 'found', 'picking', 'up', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'nuances', 'acting', 'had', 'overlooked', 'first', 'time', 'two']",N/A

The dialogue has the crippled formality of ""True Grit"" (and, later, ""Lonesome Dove""), sounding both simple-minded and ornate at the same time, even though certain terms, such as the euphemism for, um, oral gratification, probably didn't exist in 1876, and the efforts to sometimes avoid obvious racist terms by substituting perhaps less offensive euphemisms borders on comical.  That's okay, as the rest of the show at least feels authentic enough that you want to believe you're watching something historical.  The first season starts out very strong, with a premiere episode that not only sets up the characters, but provides genuine tension in the conflicts.  As the season wears on, especially after the departure of a major character, the show suffers from some of the same problems as ""The Sopranos,"" in that the ongoing, by this point soap-opery conflicts have simmered too long without meaningful resolution.  The cast, including Keith Carradine, Tim Olymphant, Robin Weigert, William Sanderson, and Brad Dourif, is excellent, providing colorful characterizations without going over-the-top.  Anyone who's picked up a Time/Life book on the Old West will find a lot of the trappings familiar, and though the show is yet another in a seemingly endless line of programs about European expansion into the frontier, yet again told from the European point of view, the lengths it goes to to show the immorality of the period is refreshing.  These are not morality tales, however, but ones about power, certainly an element of Old West mythology that generally goes overlooked.  Graphic on pretty much all fronts, ""Deadwood"" also favors a particular word beginning with ""C"" . . . let's just say that there are few words I know that are more likely to offend people, especially women I know.

The term in movies and TV ""over the top"" in reality means the writers and directors have no restraint or taste.  Deadwood initially had me devided between loving the characters, plot, setting and hating the ""over the top"" use of constant swearing.  Yup, I'll bet there was plenty of swearing back then but there was a balance of normal conversation and salty talk just like there is today.  I sat in a breakroom with a co-worker recently who went on a tirade about something or another for no more than 5 minutes.  I kept track of how many times he used the ""F word"" in those mere 5 minutes and it was 75 times. He also used the word ""dude"" about as many times but I couldn't keep track of both words.  Too much work! It would be interesting to take a work of Mark Twain and fill it with F***ing C**ks***ers to the point of absurdity.  His artful writing would be obscured with the attention drawn to childish profanity.  I use the ""F word"" on occasion when the occasion warrents but I use it for the ultimate of expression.  In other words I use it when circumstances themselves are ""over the top"".  Its a GREAT form of expression when used when something has got you completely and absolutely rilled.  Therefore, I RESERVE it for times I want to make a point when normal language doesn't suffice.  And there's the problem with Deadwood, a Mark Twain should have written the script and been allowed to pepper in some salty dialogue for occasional EMPHASIS.  Mark Twain spent some time in Silver City, Nevada and had real life experience with what the town of Deadwood was really like so too bad he's not around.  I'd sure like to have Mark Twain write the script for Deadwood but it sounds more like it was written by my co-worker.  Yo, yo, yo mother f***ing c***sucker the wild west was never so f***ing cool, dude!

866047,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006FO5LO,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[68, 73]","This is my nominee for best new drama. This revisionist western will knock your socks off with its fascinating characters and atmosphere. It's May 1876 former Montana marshal Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his business partner Sol Star (John Hawkes) open a hardware business in the gold-mining town of Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood becomes the crossroads for the famous, infamous and the people they kill. Bullock meets Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and has a run in with Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane). Swearengen lives up to his name; he's a man with the foulest mouth one can imagine and a pretty nasty fellow to cross. McShane's portrayal of Swearengen makes him one of the most complex villans this side of Tony Soprano.""Deadwood"" becomes the nexus for some of the most important figures of the old west creating a great opportunity for storytelling from writer/creator/producer David Milch (""NYPD Blue""). A sprawling, down and dirty revisionist western, the pilot directed by Walter Hill (""Southern Comfort"", ""Hard Times"", ""The Warriors"") features marvelous performances from Ian McShane, Brad Dourif, Timothy Olyphant, Molly McShane, Keith Carradine and Powers Boothe. Authentic right down to the pig crap, ""Deadwood"" features the great dialogue, action and storytelling skills we've come to expect from Milch, Hill and the other collaborators on this cable TV series. A warning for viewers--you'll hear a lot of bad words because, well, because Milch feels that folks spoke like that back then.There may only be 12 episodes included here but they're all high quality. My only complaint is that the series probably could have been packaged with more episodes per disc making the set less cumbersome. The price is a bit steep for what you're getting as well but given the quality of the series, packaging and extras, makes this a worthwhile edition to pick up.Twelve episodes spread over six discs presented in a high quality anamorphic widescreen presentation, ensures that the image quality of the show is kept sharp, clear and with nice, robust rustic colors. The 5.1 sound mix actively surrounds you in the environment of the old west. Since much of this drama is dialogue based the 5.1 atmosphere comes across most effectively when there's action sequences.Although this isn't an extra per se, the designing and packaging of this series makes ""Deadwood"" special right away. One of the best packaged boxed sets I've seen, the box resembles the Star Trek: The Next Generation sets with a sturdy outer box and an accordion fold out holder for the DVDs. It's big, bulky and personally I like the package that way. Sure, it takes up a lot of space but, hey, it's better than some of the flimsy packaging we've seen lately with these expense sets. While there isn't any booklet to tell you about the show, each episode has a brief synopsis of each one. There's also a preview and recap for each and every episode included.There's a featurette on the making of the show with a generous helping of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with Milch and the cast. Featuring vintage photographs of the actual Deadwood. Milch, the cast and crew appear in the featurette as well discussing the intersection of fiction and reality in this 25 minute glimpse into the inspiration for the show.  Milch and his collaborators discuss both the attraction of the town and the mythos that it represented. Essentially a promo piece for the series it also provides a nice introduction to the series with a generous helping of clips from the show. Interviews with local historians highlight the featurette on the real Deadwood.  Keith Carradine and Milch interview each other for ""The Language of the Old West"".  There's a number of commentary tracks with Milch and most of the main cast. The quality of the commentary tracks vary quite a bit but all are informative and interesting.A terrific series well packaged (but you end up paying for the packaging) with excellent extras, ""Deadwood"" will keep you involved in the petty dealings of saloon owner Swearengen and his conflicts with the residents and prospectors of the town.",5,"""I don't mean to upset you, it's always about the money""",1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,4155,"['nominee', 'best', 'new', 'drama', 'revisionist', 'western', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'May', '1876', 'former', 'Montana', 'marshal', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'business', 'partner', 'Sol', 'Star', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'open', 'hardware', 'business', 'gold-mining', 'town', 'Deadwood', 'South', 'Dakota', 'Deadwood', 'crossroads', 'famous', 'infamous', 'people', 'kill', 'Bullock', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'run', 'Gem', 'Saloon', 'owner', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Swearengen', 'up', 'name', 'man', 'foulest', 'mouth', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'fellow', 'cross', 'McShane', 'portrayal', 'Swearengen', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'villans', 'side', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Deadwood', 'nexus', 'most', 'important', 'figures', 'old', 'west', 'creating', 'great', 'opportunity', 'storytelling', 'writer/creator/producer', 'David', 'Milch', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'sprawling', 'down', 'dirty', 'revisionist', 'western', 'pilot', 'directed', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'Southern', 'Comfort', 'Hard', 'Times', 'Warriors', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Molly', 'McShane', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Authentic', 'right', 'down', 'pig', 'crap', 'Deadwood', 'great', 'dialogue', 'action', 'storytelling', 'skills', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Milch', 'Hill', 'other', 'collaborators', 'cable', 'TV', 'series', 'warning', 'viewers', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'lot', 'bad', 'words', 'well', 'Milch', 'feels', 'folks', 'spoke', 'back', 'then.There', 'may', 'only', 'be', '12', 'episodes', 'included', 'here', ""'re"", 'high', 'quality', 'only', 'complaint', 'series', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'packaged', 'more', 'episodes', 'disc', 'making', 'set', 'cumbersome', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'quality', 'series', 'packaging', 'extras', 'worthwhile', 'edition', 'pick', 'up.Twelve', 'episodes', 'spread', 'six', 'discs', 'presented', 'high', 'quality', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'image', 'quality', 'show', 'kept', 'sharp', 'clear', 'nice', 'robust', 'rustic', 'colors', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'actively', 'environment', 'old', 'west', 'much', 'drama', 'dialogue', 'based', '5.1', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'effectively', 'when', 'action', 'sequences.Although', ""n't"", 'extra', 'per', 'se', 'designing', 'packaging', 'series', 'Deadwood', 'special', 'right', 'away', 'One', 'best', 'packaged', 'boxed', 'sets', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'box', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'sturdy', 'outer', 'box', 'accordion', 'fold', 'out', 'holder', 'DVDs', 'big', 'bulky', 'personally', 'like', 'package', 'way', 'Sure', 'up', 'lot', 'space', 'hey', 'better', 'flimsy', 'packaging', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'expense', 'sets', ""n't"", 'booklet', 'tell', 'show', 'episode', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'one', 'also', 'preview', 'recap', 'episode', 'featurette', 'making', 'show', 'generous', 'helping', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'interviews', 'Milch', 'cast', 'Featuring', 'vintage', 'photographs', 'actual', 'Deadwood', 'Milch', 'cast', 'crew', 'appear', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'discussing', 'intersection', 'fiction', 'reality', '25', 'minute', 'glimpse', 'inspiration', 'show', 'Milch', 'collaborators', 'discuss', 'attraction', 'town', 'mythos', 'represented', 'Essentially', 'promo', 'piece', 'series', 'also', 'nice', 'introduction', 'series', 'generous', 'helping', 'clips', 'show', 'Interviews', 'local', 'historians', 'highlight', 'featurette', 'real', 'Deadwood', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Milch', 'interview', 'other', 'Language', 'Old', 'West', 'number', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Milch', 'most', 'main', 'cast', 'quality', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'vary', 'quite', 'bit', 'are', 'informative', 'interesting.A', 'terrific', 'series', 'well', 'packaged', 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'packaging', 'excellent', 'extras', 'Deadwood', 'will', 'keep', 'involved', 'petty', 'dealings', 'saloon', 'owner', 'Swearengen', 'conflicts', 'residents', 'prospectors', 'town']",N/A

I rented the first disc of Deadwood season 1 because I love the old west theme and I've liked HBO's other productions, so I really wanted to check this out.Unfortunately, within the first 5 minutes of episode 1, I quickly started noticing a theme with the dialogue that did not let up one bit throughout the 2 episodes on this disc, and that was the profanity.  Lots and LOTS of it.  I'm no goodie-two-shoes and don't have the cleanest mouth in the world, so profanity in itself doesn't bother me, but when it is SOOOOOOOO over the top that it's a distraction from what is really supposed to be going on, then that's a problem.
