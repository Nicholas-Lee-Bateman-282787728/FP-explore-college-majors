298799,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302161401,Acute Observer,"[1, 10]","Private Eddie Slovik was the only Army deserter to be shot in WW II, the first since the Civil War. This TV film is a dramatization of the events. [No mention of the soldiers who were executed for murder or rape.] The red keystone patch on the shoulders identify their outfit. In reality, the firing squad had no regrets about their job, or so the books say. The beginning spends time on the details of the execution, slowing the pace. Then there are flashbacks to Slovik's past. Time in jail made him 4F, the war made jobs plentiful. Eddie tells of his bad luck and his petty thefts; he hung out with a bad crowd. A good job and a marriage changed his life for the better. But change is the only constant in this world. The need for recruits caused the draft board to revise the status of now married Eddie to 1A, and he was inducted. [Since this happened after he changed jobs could someone have arranged this in revenge?]Slovik got 17 weeks of basic training in Texas. He and the others will be sent to a replacement depot (""repple-depple""). Eddie is unhappy and wants a discharge. No luck; he will be shipped overseas. Under shellfire Eddie is separated from the others, and stayed with Canadian troops. Eddie loses his ammo, and his nerves cause a problem. He writes a confession and gives it to an officer. The process begins: Slovik is sentenced to be shot. Unlike many others, his sentence will be carried out. A colonel offers him a chance to get his sentence suspended if he returns to the line. Eddie refuses and makes the biggest mistake of his life. The medical report finds him healthy and sane. Slovik is found guilty, the three ballots agree on the sentence. The reviews of the sentence do not recommend clemency. His death is needed to set an example to the many other soldiers who were separated or thought of doing it. [This film ignores the Battle of the Bulge and the worries it caused.]Most soldiers train with a unit and there is a bond between them. The replacements often had no chance to become acquainted. Stories about wartime tell of replacements whose names were unknown during their short life in battle. Experience is always important in life.This story is slow-paced with maudlin sentiments. Its too long by 30 minutes. The team of Levinson and Link went on to create many hit shows. What was the purpose of this 1974 film? It was made just after our Vietnam War finally ended.",1,The Story of His Life and Death,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2410,"['Private', 'Eddie', 'Slovik', 'was', 'only', 'Army', 'deserter', 'be', 'shot', 'WW', 'II', 'first', 'Civil', 'War', 'TV', 'film', 'dramatization', 'events', '[', 'mention', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'executed', 'murder', 'rape', ']', 'red', 'keystone', 'patch', 'shoulders', 'identify', 'outfit', 'reality', 'firing', 'squad', 'had', 'regrets', 'job', 'so', 'books', 'say', 'beginning', 'spends', 'time', 'details', 'execution', 'slowing', 'pace', 'Then', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'Slovik', 'past', 'Time', 'jail', 'made', '4F', 'war', 'made', 'jobs', 'plentiful', 'Eddie', 'tells', 'bad', 'luck', 'petty', 'thefts', 'hung', 'out', 'bad', 'crowd', 'good', 'job', 'marriage', 'changed', 'life', 'better', 'change', 'only', 'constant', 'world', 'need', 'recruits', 'caused', 'draft', 'board', 'revise', 'status', 'now', 'married', 'Eddie', '1A', 'was', 'inducted', '[', 'happened', 'changed', 'jobs', 'could', 'someone', 'have', 'arranged', 'revenge', ']', 'Slovik', 'got', '17', 'weeks', 'basic', 'training', 'Texas', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'replacement', 'depot', 'repple-depple', 'Eddie', 'unhappy', 'discharge', 'luck', 'will', 'be', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'shellfire', 'Eddie', 'separated', 'others', 'stayed', 'Canadian', 'troops', 'Eddie', 'ammo', 'nerves', 'cause', 'problem', 'confession', 'officer', 'process', 'Slovik', 'sentenced', 'be', 'shot', 'many', 'others', 'sentence', 'will', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'colonel', 'chance', 'get', 'sentence', 'suspended', 'line', 'Eddie', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'life', 'medical', 'report', 'healthy', 'sane', 'Slovik', 'found', 'guilty', 'three', 'ballots', 'agree', 'sentence', 'reviews', 'sentence', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'clemency', 'death', 'needed', 'set', 'example', 'many', 'other', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'separated', 'thought', 'doing', '[', 'film', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'worries', 'caused', ']', 'Most', 'soldiers', 'train', 'unit', 'bond', 'replacements', 'often', 'had', 'chance', 'become', 'acquainted', 'Stories', 'wartime', 'tell', 'replacements', 'names', 'were', 'unknown', 'short', 'life', 'battle', 'Experience', 'always', 'important', 'life.This', 'story', 'slow-paced', 'maudlin', 'sentiments', 'too', 'long', '30', 'minutes', 'team', 'Levinson', 'Link', 'went', 'create', 'many', 'hit', 'shows', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', '1974', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'finally', 'ended']",N/A

Slovik (Martin Sheen) was a strange person and I didn't know how to react to this story, frankly. I knew Hollywood was going to give it its usual liberal bias, especially with Sheen in the starring role, so I tried to look at this objectively with no prejudices.Unfortunately, in trying to be totally neutral, it's easy to watch this film and come away with no definite stance. On one hand, you can't blame the military because it would be in chaos if every soldier who didn't want to fight could get out of it.  On the hand, Slovik was such a nice, gentle guy, the death penalty for his actions seemed severe, too. Couldn't something else have been worked out?Anyway, the film - except for a couple of lulls with the romance angle - kept my attention and made me think about an issue, so it served its purpose.",4,A Tough Call,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,935,"['was', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'shown', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'be', 'shot', 'desertion', 'Slovik', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'strange', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'react', 'story', 'frankly', 'knew', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'usual', 'liberal', 'bias', 'especially', 'Sheen', 'starring', 'role', 'tried', 'look', 'objectively', 'prejudices.Unfortunately', 'trying', 'be', 'totally', 'neutral', 'easy', 'watch', 'film', 'come', 'away', 'definite', 'stance', 'one', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'military', 'would', 'be', 'chaos', 'soldier', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'could', 'get', 'hand', 'Slovik', 'was', 'such', 'nice', 'gentle', 'guy', 'death', 'penalty', 'actions', 'seemed', 'severe', 'too', 'Could', ""n't"", 'something', 'else', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'Anyway', 'film', 'couple', 'lulls', 'romance', 'angle', 'kept', 'attention', 'made', 'think', 'issue', 'served', 'purpose']",N/A
298801,A1532CWT9FCNUC,6302161401,"D.E.M ""irish-dara""","[8, 22]","My father was a WW2 Vet. If I was a male, I probably would have been drafted into the Viet Nam war. But I am female, and the conscientious Objectors were part and parcel of my collegiate aged generation. I do not believe Slovik was a 'whiner' or a coward. He faced death with certainty; front lines meant, as the movie portrayed 'uncertainty' of 'not knowing'.. so when he was made such a sick example of, by the military, he accepted being shot by his own American army as his plight, and, he took and accepted this more than anyone in my generation would have, or since.There were no demonstrations against war in WW2, as there were about Viet Nam. His past petty theft time in jail for 5 yrs, has zero to do with his heart. He simply did not want to KILL another human being. He was no coward.TO KILL is not courage. To NOT kill and and face death with no redemption of living IS courage. He turned the other cheek. He, prayed to have strength spiritualy and sought the denomination of his catholic faith, and asked for a preist... he, exemplified the kindest, most courageous of all.. to face that which was so unacceptable, to the US army in a wartime era, where noone questioned the military, their means of attack, or murdering other mother's sons. So, we hear... 'freedom is not free..'today and yesterday. It would be free, if HUMANITY did NOT KILL. If, all would give peace a chance. IF, there were talks over violent aggressive disputes, if people realized that war is not the answer.. that, our boys are being so brainwashed into murdering other 'mothers sons' and that we, are not 'so right' in war after war after war, especially NOW. My own father suffered the effects of WW2 greatly, with nightmares and violence upon me in my childhood; no one talked about this, no one helped our guys, no on had any answers. My generation, fortunately questioned these reasons, and.. defied them.I am glad I am of my generation which after the sanitization of war, and the coming home to america to become one of the baby boomer generation, to later question all this stuff and now? I am seeing that each generation has a war to go to. The Gulf war, could have involved my then 19 yr. old son... but the draft was abolished. While, i recognize that we have so many wonderful things in this country, at this juncture, I question George W. Bush, and I question this war in 2005; and, I am in harmony with Malachy McCourt's views and most of Europes with this insanity.Most, in the military DO NOT or cannot ask questions... period. They are trained to KILL, period. They are conditioned not to think but to DO as they are told, period. It is brain-washing in the name of 'freedom.' How free is that??? IF, our leaders sat at tables and spoke to one another about world's problems, and solved them with intelligence, integrity and PEACE, then innocent men, women and children would not suffer torn bodies, limbs, pain, starvation, murder, death, and untold years of misery to rebuild their lives if at all possible, all in the name of WAR.it is very simple, if the world's leaders would abide by the most easiest of measures to give peace and peace talks a CHANCE. Call me a peacenik,if you wish, but war has never ever worked, and if you don't believe me, ask any son's mother, who's body has been shipped home in a box, and all she has got is a cloth fabric of the flag, for the life giving she gave to her child...and years of loving devotion she's provided along with her husband, to her SON.Or, his pregnant wife, or his wife who has children minus a daddy, they'll never see..OR... know.So, what do we do? Huh? Are we so threatened that we cannot fight? slavik didn't fight back, and did it ever occur to anyone back then, that he in his so called cowardice, did not kill some other mother's son? I think so.I am going back to the 60's....""WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAR, AND NOBODY CAME??""I still believe in this... and always will.",5,Slovik faced death with certainty & acceptance,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,3931,"['father', 'was', 'WW2', 'Vet', 'was', 'male', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'drafted', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'am', 'female', 'conscientious', 'Objectors', 'were', 'part', 'parcel', 'collegiate', 'aged', 'generation', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Slovik', 'was', ""'whiner"", 'coward', 'faced', 'death', 'certainty', 'front', 'lines', 'meant', 'movie', 'portrayed', ""'uncertainty"", ""'not"", ""knowing'.."", 'so', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'sick', 'example', 'military', 'accepted', 'being', 'shot', 'own', 'American', 'army', 'plight', 'took', 'accepted', 'more', 'anyone', 'generation', 'would', 'have', 'were', 'demonstrations', 'war', 'WW2', 'were', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'past', 'petty', 'theft', 'time', 'jail', '5', 'yrs', 'zero', 'do', 'heart', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'KILL', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'coward.TO', 'KILL', 'not', 'courage', 'NOT', 'kill', 'face', 'death', 'redemption', 'living', 'IS', 'courage', 'turned', 'other', 'cheek', 'prayed', 'have', 'strength', 'spiritualy', 'sought', 'denomination', 'catholic', 'faith', 'asked', 'preist', 'exemplified', 'kindest', 'most', 'courageous', 'all..', 'face', 'was', 'so', 'unacceptable', 'US', 'army', 'wartime', 'era', 'where', 'noone', 'questioned', 'military', 'means', 'attack', 'murdering', 'other', 'mother', 'sons', 'So', 'hear', 'not', ""free..'today"", 'yesterday', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'HUMANITY', 'did', 'NOT', 'KILL', 'would', 'give', 'peace', 'chance', 'IF', 'were', 'talks', 'violent', 'aggressive', 'disputes', 'people', 'realized', 'war', 'not', 'answer..', 'boys', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'brainwashed', 'murdering', 'other', ""'mothers"", 'sons', 'are', 'not', ""'so"", 'right', 'war', 'war', 'war', 'especially', 'NOW', 'own', 'father', 'suffered', 'effects', 'WW2', 'greatly', 'nightmares', 'violence', 'childhood', 'one', 'talked', 'one', 'helped', 'guys', 'had', 'answers', 'generation', 'fortunately', 'questioned', 'reasons', 'and..', 'defied', 'them.I', 'am', 'glad', 'am', 'generation', 'sanitization', 'war', 'coming', 'home', 'america', 'become', 'one', 'baby', 'boomer', 'generation', 'later', 'question', 'stuff', 'now', 'am', 'seeing', 'generation', 'war', 'go', 'Gulf', 'war', 'could', 'have', 'involved', 'then', '19', 'yr.', 'old', 'son', 'draft', 'was', 'abolished', 'i', 'recognize', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'country', 'juncture', 'question', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'question', 'war', '2005', 'am', 'harmony', 'Malachy', 'McCourt', 'views', 'most', 'Europes', 'insanity.Most', 'military', 'DO', 'NOT', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'questions', 'period', 'are', 'trained', 'KILL', 'period', 'are', 'conditioned', 'not', 'think', 'DO', 'are', 'told', 'period', 'brain-washing', 'name', ""'freedom"", 'How', 'free', 'IF', 'leaders', 'sat', 'tables', 'spoke', 'one', 'world', 'problems', 'solved', 'intelligence', 'integrity', 'PEACE', 'then', 'innocent', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'suffer', 'torn', 'bodies', 'limbs', 'pain', 'starvation', 'murder', 'death', 'untold', 'years', 'misery', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'possible', 'name', 'WAR.it', 'very', 'simple', 'world', 'leaders', 'would', 'abide', 'most', 'easiest', 'measures', 'give', 'peace', 'peace', 'talks', 'CHANCE', 'Call', 'peacenik', 'wish', 'war', 'never', 'ever', 'worked', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ask', 'son', 'mother', 'who', 'body', 'been', 'shipped', 'home', 'box', 'got', 'cloth', 'fabric', 'flag', 'life', 'giving', 'gave', 'child', 'years', 'loving', 'devotion', 'provided', 'husband', 'SON.Or', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'wife', 'who', 'children', 'daddy', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see..OR', 'know.So', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Huh', 'Are', 'so', 'threatened', 'can', 'not', 'fight', 'slavik', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'did', 'ever', 'occur', 'anyone', 'back', 'then', 'so', 'called', 'cowardice', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'other', 'mother', 'son', 'think', 'so.I', 'am', 'going', 'back', '60', 'WHAT', 'IF', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'A', 'WAR', 'AND', 'NOBODY', 'CAME', 'still', 'believe', 'always', 'will']",N/A

Raynor,"[6, 6]","This movie boldly states that you don't need the special effects in Saving Private Ryan to tell an incredible (and true) World War II Story.I cannot do the story justice in a few words, but I'll try. This is the tale  of an individual who never got a brake in life except for when he found  someone to love. When he married her his life began to turn around. Then he  was drafted into the army and sent to France. His desire to return to her  and his fear of sudden death led to his dissertion from front-line duty.  He was not afraid to die -- he just feared knowing that it could happen any  second he was out there.The Execution of Private Slovik is the type of  tale that makes you understand the underdog and although you know that he  dies at the end - you wind up wishing, perhaps as much as he did, that  there was some way he could escape it. Told through the eyes of the people  he met, this film reaches deep inside you and touches those emotions you've  forgotten about in your daily grind.I rate this film a MUST SEE.
