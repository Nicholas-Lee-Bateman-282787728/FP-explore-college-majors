1607289,A1X3ZH6HGDZDGU,B00AAQHO2Q,Brad T. Janowitz,"[0, 0]","Loved this series. With all of the controversy behind it, tends to taint the whole thing. Now they are trying to find a new bad guy, regain their focus, and continue on. The odds of someone finding their fortune in a storage locker are slim. They film the very unusual aspects of this profession, and high light it. Still a fun series to watch.",3,Losing Steam,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,344,"['Loved', 'series', 'controversy', 'taint', 'whole', 'thing', 'Now', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'bad', 'guy', 'regain', 'focus', 'continue', 'odds', 'someone', 'finding', 'fortune', 'storage', 'locker', 'are', 'slim', 'film', 'very', 'unusual', 'aspects', 'profession', 'high', 'light', 'Still', 'fun', 'series', 'watch']",Storage Wars: Volume 4

1607291,A1AJUV4X9LS6AA,B00AAQHO2Q,"Jon Bon ""JoN""","[2, 3]","I really enjoy watching Storage Wars and I highly recommend this show! I love the anticipation of waiting to see what treasures are buried in the storage lockers!! Also, in my opinion, this show can be very exciting, and humorous! I am also a huge fan of all of the characters. However, I was very disappointed to see Dave Hester go this season! This show definitely has it's own cool, unique style!! Moreover, to briefly sum it up, basically, the show revolves around a few main characters who bid on used storage lockers. The contents of the lockers can then be kept as treasures, or sold for profit! Be warned, this show can be very addicting!!!",5,Storage Wars,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,648,"['really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Storage', 'Wars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'love', 'anticipation', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'treasures', 'are', 'buried', 'storage', 'lockers', 'Also', 'opinion', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'exciting', 'humorous', 'am', 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'characters', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Dave', 'Hester', 'go', 'season', 'show', 'definitely', 'own', 'cool', 'unique', 'style', 'Moreover', 'briefly', 'sum', 'up', 'basically', 'show', 'around', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'bid', 'used', 'storage', 'lockers', 'contents', 'lockers', 'can', 'then', 'be', 'kept', 'treasures', 'sold', 'profit', 'Be', 'warned', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'addicting']",Storage Wars: Volume 4
