I would recommend, if you don't own Uncut Box Set #1, to get it either first or at the same time.  And if you like the story line started in Uncut Box Set #1, you will need the Uncut Box sets 1 through 4 (Uncut Box Set #4 is actually 2 Box Sets - set 1 and 2 - not sure why they did this other than milking the fans of extra cash)The 1st 4 Uncut Box sets will get you through Episode #63.

Normally these sets are anywhere between $40.00 to $60.00.  They're not cheap (but I don't think any season set is when it comes to anime).  This set was very reasonably priced.  I couldn't believe how cheap it was.  Also, the set looked brand new and played perfectly.  I'm very pleased and so is he.
