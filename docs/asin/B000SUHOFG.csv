I see that there are 3 stars provided, and that is wrong!Two of the movies were so badly flawed (one too bright and both static-ridden all the way through) that I almost gave up, but I  wanted to let others know what I received.  The Shadow Strikes was boring as well as a ""white-out"" film. What I couldn't see, I couldn't hear.  The same willow trees in a lot of scenes were probably lovely...if I could have really seen them.  Very few sets used.A Shot in the Dark was full of jerkings and static.  Another boring movie. I can't find anything good to say about it.Slightly Honorable was the purpose of the purchase because Eve Arden is noted as one of the stars, and she's a favorite of mine.  She had about 8 appearances as a receptionist, all one-two liners with a smart remark. I can't imagine why she is noted at all.  Not even a very good cast could save this.Shadows on the Stairs was filmed on three sets, all in a dark boarding house with boring characters and a supposed mystery plot. If you are a Turhan Bey fan, he didn't do much but try to sneer as he spoke intermittently.  The characters could have been interesting, but they weren't.  The furniture, all dark wooden pieces, would be interesting to an (almost) antiques dealer.I wouldn't watch this again, and am sorry that I read such glowing reviews from others.  I am a '30s black and white movie fan, and there are so many wonderful movies from that era that there is no excuse for this to have been made for sale.
