It was very low budget, but there were creepy scenes. The blood shower scene is pretty awesome! The main flaw, in my opinion anyway, comes from the choppy editing. I guess this was done on purpose (or so the director claims), but it just irritated me. Also, I could tell that some plot-related scenes had been cut out. This was probably due to pacing reasons I'm guessing. It kind of hurt the finished film as a whole. Over all, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of low-budget horror from the late 70's/early 80's. Also of note, there is a fantastic dvd version available from the Amazon UK site. It's uncut and has a ton of special features too. Well worth picking up.",3,The ship needs blood!,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,799,"['just', 'watched', 'recently', 'reading', 'issue', 'Horrorhound', 'magazine', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'were', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'blood', 'shower', 'scene', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'main', 'flaw', 'opinion', 'anyway', 'choppy', 'editing', 'guess', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'so', 'director', 'claims', 'just', 'irritated', 'Also', 'could', 'tell', 'plot-related', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'was', 'probably', 'due', 'pacing', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'kind', 'hurt', 'finished', 'film', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'late', ""70's/early"", '80', 'Also', 'note', 'fantastic', 'dvd', 'version', 'available', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'site', 'uncut', 'ton', 'special', 'features', 'too', 'Well', 'picking', 'up']",N/A
