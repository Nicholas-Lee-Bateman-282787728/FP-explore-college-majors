259282,A2JCDEK5UVKU1Q,6301628829,"D. Demro ""Vietnam War and WWII historian""","[1, 1]","Father Jerzy Popieluszko was a Roman Catholic priest from Communist Poland who courageously spoke out against the persecution of the Polish people and was outspoken in his support of the Solidarity movement that was sweeping the unions in the 1980s. When the Communists saw their lies were not resonating with the Polish people, it was a Catholic priest they feared most. A Catholic priest who spoke the truth and helped his people to see the lies and distortion that so often are associated with the evil of Communism. In the end, the Communists chose to do what they do best - use force, intimidation and finally murder to silence the voice of the people. On October 19, 1984 Father Popieluszko was kidnapped by three agents of the Polish Communist Internal Intelligence Agency. He was severely beaten, then bound with rope and thrown into a reservoir where his body was recovered 11 days later. Father Popieluszko has since been recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church and on June 6, 2010 he was beatified.I remember quite clearly reading about the brutal murder of this priest in Reader's Digest at the time it took place. I was horrified by the sheer brutality of the beating of Father Popieluszko before they finally hung a rope around his neck that had a weight tied to the other end, and while still alive, they threw him into a waterway where he died. What is most ironic is how just a few short years later, in this same paper mill just feet from where I was seated at the time I read this story, a friend and fellow co-worker was brutally beaten, had a rope tied around his neck that was attached to a weight, and was thrown in a pulp vat to die because he too chose to take a stand against evil. In this case it was the evil that existed in six union thugs who were eventually sentenced to life in prison for the murder. Evil is evil and wherever there is good there will always be evil. It seems throughout history wherever you have Communism you will find the persecution and murder of Catholic priests and nuns because they are deemed a threat to those who want to disallow free thinking and who only seek to control people with an iron fist.When I came across the movie on Amazon I decided to order it and learn more about the story behind the man (I also strongly recommend the following movies which also deal with the horrific realities of communism):- ""Katyn"" (True story of the cold-blooded execution of almost 22,000 Polish Nationals by the Russians in 1940).- ""Eleni"" (The true story of an award-winning investigative journalist from the NY Times, played by John Malkovich, who returns to his native Greece with the intention to track down and kill the former communist soldier who was responsible for the 1949 torture and murder of his mother (for smuggling her children out of Greece to the United States).- ""Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us"" (The Polish-produced version of ""To Kill A Priest"", with the spoken language being Polish and English subtitles. Personally, after seeing both versions I felt watching the movie in its native tongue gives a much more realistic feel to this tragedy).- ""Escape From Camp 14"" (True story of a man named Shin Dong-hyuk who, in 1996, escaped from the N.Korean slave labor camp from which he was born into, and sadly from where his actions convicted his mother and brother to death).- ""Guilty of Treason"" (True story of Hungarian Cardinal J&oacute;zsef Mindszenty, played by Charles Bickford, who was tortured and given a life sentence in 1949 for his uncompromising opposition to fascism and communism in Hungary).These are the kind of movies that should be shown in every American classroom so this generation of young adults can better understand the true meaning of Communism. Very little is reported about the atrocities taking place, to this very day, in countries like the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and North Korea. Communism silences all freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom of speech, freedom of travel, etc., etc. I have heard countless stories from those who've escaped Communist countries and the stories are always the same: stories of unspeakable horror, suffering, imprisonment, death and brutality. They are Godless societies which lack human compassion, love, trust, assistance on all levels, food, etc. All the freedoms and luxuries we so readily take for granted here in America, cannot even be imagined by the citizens of these countries. And yet sadly, every year Americans surrender more and more of their freedom to an ever-growing government that is over-reaching the restrictions placed on it by our Constitution. The more control that is surrendered to the government the more restrictions we will find ourselves living under.This movie was extremely well done and at times you forget these are actors. Now this priest is in the last steps of being anointed sainthood and will spend his eternity at the right hand of God. How true is Edmond Burke's famous quote: ""The only thing necessary for evil to prosper is for good men to do nothing."" This is a movie for all to see how the devil uses people to do his work, then abandons them once he is finished with them.",5,The True Face of COMMUNISM is always EVIL!,1374364800,"07 21,

259284,A1M5405JH9THP9,6301628829,golgotha.gov,"[2, 4]","TO KILL A PRIEST (1988)directed by Agnieszka Hollandapprox. 2 hoursThis movie is about the Polish ""Solidarity"" movement - a labor movement that the Communist state considered to be a domestic threat.  This movie accurately shows the central government thugs monitoring, arresting and even killing citizens for the simple act of dissent.  This didn't take place in the 1910s or 1940s but as recently as the early 1980s!  Its worth pointing out that Solidarity wasn't exclusively a Catholic phenomenon and that it was more like a coalition of non-communist peoples.  This movie is based on a real priest named Jerzy Popieluszko who aligned himself with Solidarity against the wishes of his superiors.  Poland was in a state of martial law and it was an extremely risky time to criticize the government.Now on to the movie.  The direction is beautiful but the writing drags at parts.  However what holds the movie back is the casting.  A lot of times this is a problem when making a movie for an American audience about a European setting (for example, some characters in this movie have accents, others don't).  Actors Tim Roth and Ed Harris gave great performances but seem a little out of place.  Christopher Lambert of ""HIGHLANDER"" fame plays the priest somewhat comfortably but only a limited range of emotion is shown with his character.Nevertheless many of the details of the movie are important and included in the dialogue.  The movie did not need to be as long as it was, but one interesting thing it shows is how living in a ""surveillance state"" affects the families of government operatives.  You can see a wife who fears that her husband will be murdered because she believes propaganda that Solidarity is a terrorist group.  You also see a lonely son who is untrusted by his peers because his father works against religion.  Finally, this movie is worth seeing as it details the last gasp of a Soviet satellite struggling to crush public opposition.Polish director Agnieszka Holland is perhaps best known in the US for her movie adaptation of the book 'THE SECRET GARDEN'.To the best of my knowledge, this movie has never been released on DVD format!",3,to kill resistence,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2161,"['TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'PRIEST', '1988', 'directed', 'Agnieszka', 'Hollandapprox', '2', 'hoursThis', 'movie', 'Polish', 'Solidarity', 'movement', 'labor', 'movement', 'Communist', 'state', 'considered', 'be', 'domestic', 'threat', 'movie', 'accurately', 'central', 'government', 'thugs', 'monitoring', 'arresting', 'even', 'killing', 'citizens', 'simple', 'act', 'dissent', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', '1910s', '1940s', 'as', 'recently', 'early', '1980s', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'Solidarity', 'was', ""n't"", 'exclusively', 'Catholic', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'more', 'coalition', 'non-communist', 'peoples', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'priest', 'named', 'Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', 'who', 'aligned', 'Solidarity', 'wishes', 'superiors', 'Poland', 'was', 'state', 'martial', 'law', 'was', 'extremely', 'risky', 'time', 'criticize', 'government.Now', 'movie', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'drags', 'parts', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'back', 'casting', 'lot', 'times', 'problem', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'American', 'audience', 'European', 'setting', 'example', 'characters', 'movie', 'have', 'accents', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'Actors', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'gave', 'great', 'performances', 'seem', 'little', 'place', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'HIGHLANDER', 'fame', 'priest', 'somewhat', 'comfortably', 'only', 'limited', 'range', 'emotion', 'shown', 'character.Nevertheless', 'many', 'details', 'movie', 'are', 'important', 'included', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'one', 'interesting', 'thing', 'how', 'living', 'surveillance', 'state', 'families', 'government', 'operatives', 'can', 'see', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'murdered', 'propaganda', 'Solidarity', 'terrorist', 'group', 'also', 'see', 'lonely', 'son', 'who', 'untrusted', 'peers', 'father', 'religion', 'Finally', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'details', 'last', 'gasp', 'Soviet', 'satellite', 'struggling', 'crush', 'public', 'opposition.Polish', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'US', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'SECRET', ""GARDEN'.To"", 'best', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'format']",N/A

259288,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6301628829,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 7]","Ed Harris plays an up-and-coming secret policeman in mid 1980&#65533;s Poland in this morality film about the communist crackdown on the Solidarity movement.  The film also gives us Christopher Lambert as a soft-spoken Priest who outdoes his superiors in antagonizing the communists.  Supposedly based upon a true story, &#65533;Priest&#65533; seems to pit Harris&#65533;s secret policeman against Lambert&#65533;s noble and fearless priest during the period of martial law, but the story soon focuses on Harris&#65533;s character and makes him the battleground for war of Poland&#65533;s soul.  As Stefan, Harris gamely goes after Lambert&#65533;s Alec.  Though prodded by his superiors &#65533; especially Joss Ackland as a morally dubious police chief who tries to get Stefan to murder the priest without having to order him to do it &#65533; Stefan finds his efforts undercut by spineless toadies unwilling to openly confront the opposition.  Though repeatedly arresting and releasing the priest, Stefan&#65533;s communist chiefs keep the pressure on both of them, tearing Stefan apart.  Stefan, we learn, is the proud lineage of unregenerate Stalinists.  Though the nominal chiefs of Poland, the shared popularity of the Solidarity movement and the Church isolates Stefan and his circle, further driving Stefan to the edge.This was a good film when it becomes Stefan&#65533;s story.  Harris is so good, you forget that he&#65533;s otherwise miscast (the quintessential American, Harris is surrounded with Europeans like Lambert, Ackland, Tim Roth as a fellow officer or Pete Posthelthwaite as a Solidarity supporter), and really has nobody to work with.  Also, the film doesn&#65533;t really play up it&#65533;s best story &#65533; Stefan&#65533;s disintegration.  Why Harris has his character go to pieces isn&#65533;t clear.  Stefan is intelligent and dogmatic.  Early on, however, he shows signs that he may be a bit of a devout Catholic himself (while caught on video &#65533;infiltrating&#65533; a Solidarity rally attended by other loyal churchgoers).  Though he strenuously insists it was an act to help him blend in, why he feels subject to the very whims of his spineless superiors (who release Stefan&#65533;s prisoners during frequent Amnesties) is unclear.  Neither does he feel he owes anything to his parents&#65533; generation (they had the opportunity to rid Poland of the Church years before the Solidarity movement existsed, and squandered it).  Rather than explore the two sides of Stefan&#65533;s soul over which the Church and the Communists fight, the script relegates Stefan into one of the combatants, an ill-fated move sealed with Harris&#65533;s closing speech.  Lambert seems woefully miscast &#65533; and I like him in other movies.  However, the script has him squaring off defiantly against the communists as if they worked for the Kurgan from the highlander movies.  Much of the problem is that this is an historical movie robbed of its force by later history.  The Poland&#65533;s communists are gone, and even the solidarity movement needed to shift its attentions to other threats to Poland&#65533;s well being.
