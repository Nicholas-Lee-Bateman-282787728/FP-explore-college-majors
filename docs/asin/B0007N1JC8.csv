I completely disagree with everything the reviewers on here say; in fact, I think the polar opposite is true in many cases.The cinematography is awful, the color is grainy beyond belief. The dialog is terrible, it comes across as amateurish techno-babble. The dialog is hard to understand, the comments rarely connect, and the script is full of left-field nonsequiturs. The acting is awful, particularly the blond guy.WHY do they go through the whole movie wearing shirts and ties with slacks? They wear them when they're lounging at home or working on the machine, everywhere. They look like Mormon missionaries.This came across as a meaningless movie; a movie about nothing.

Have you ever wondered while watching a Hollywood sci-fi, hi-tech thriller that if the film were actually as intelligent as it was pretending to be, it would actually present science that was coherent and interesting. Well, the actual result is almost as bad, but not entirely because of the writing.  The film fails because: 1) Non professional actors were used and the performances are pretty lifeless and 2)The writer/director hadn't really grasped the notion of dramatic action and how to portray that beyond the page. As a result, the film fails to draw the audience into its predicament.  Towards the end thing started to get somewhat interesting in terms of actual plot development, but to no avail.  It's as if the director sought to create a factual film while not caring about how he felt about the facts.  Films are a very emotional and sensoral medium which is why going to see them in a theatre is such a privelige, but seeing this one in a theatre would be just as entertaining as seeing it at home. While I applaud the effort of the team that made this film, I believe they failed in a large way and succeeded in a very small one.  As such, I recommend it to engineers, and not too many others.",2,"A sci-fi thriller, written by an engineer",1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,1333,"['such', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'loving', 'audience', 'fanbase', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'impact', 'Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'sci-fi', 'hi-tech', 'thriller', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'as', 'intelligent', 'was', 'pretending', 'be', 'would', 'actually', 'present', 'science', 'was', 'coherent', 'interesting', 'Well', 'actual', 'result', 'almost', 'bad', 'not', 'entirely', 'writing', 'film', '1', 'Non', 'professional', 'actors', 'were', 'used', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'lifeless', '2', 'writer/director', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'grasped', 'notion', 'dramatic', 'action', 'how', 'portray', 'page', 'result', 'film', 'draw', 'audience', 'predicament', 'end', 'thing', 'started', 'get', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'terms', 'actual', 'plot', 'development', 'avail', 'director', 'sought', 'create', 'factual', 'film', 'not', 'caring', 'how', 'felt', 'facts', 'Films', 'are', 'very', 'emotional', 'sensoral', 'medium', 'why', 'going', 'see', 'theatre', 'such', 'privelige', 'seeing', 'one', 'theatre', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'seeing', 'home', 'applaud', 'effort', 'team', 'made', 'film', 'believe', 'failed', 'large', 'way', 'succeeded', 'very', 'small', 'one', 'such', 'recommend', 'engineers', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'others']",Primer
883540,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0007N1JC8,Alistair McHarg,"[16, 48]","Primer is arguably the slowest movie ever made, far from being a primer in time travel it seems to be an advanced tutorial in stopping time.  Imagine four Silicon Valley techno-geeks talking simultaneously into barely functioning mikes and you have Primer.  The plot, such as it is, has also traveled through time, revisit old episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to see for yourself.On its face, the premise of time travel and the creation of alternate selves, manipulating or not manipulating events and thereby tinkering with the smooth continuum, would seem to be promising.  While it does prompt rather grandiose philosophical questions, (questions that exceed the grasp of Mr. Carruth who wrote, directed, starred, scored, edited, and painted the props), it defeats its purpose because there are simply too many possibilities.  Drama depends on well-defined situations and tension, in the silly-putty world of Primer, where anything can happen; there is no definition, tension, or suspense.Normally, when I learn that plucky kids made a movie for $7,000 I cheer, because Hollywood needs to know that big money does not equal quality.  (Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle is a stellar example of film excellence on a shoestring budget.)  When I hear that a film is a Sundance winner, I'm immediately interested because this often points me towards movies that are small, overlooked, and wonderful.  But no system is foolproof, and Primer snuck through the cracks.For a mature look at time manipulation that does provide meaningful structure, try Last Year At Marienbad, Memento, or even Lost Highway.  Marienbad and Memento are brilliant, and Highway, while it leans heavily on signature Lynch weirdness to make its point, at least provides the visceral impact thoroughly lacking in Primer.

Ultimately, I still wish I could truly go back in time -- and NOT see this horrendous excuse for a movie.  But let me tell you why:The audio was beyond horrible,... it was confoundingly bad. All the background noise, cars passing by outside the house, and other stuff totally unrelated to the movie, were always louder than the dialogue.  But that was the GOOD news, inasmuch as the dialoge was much much WORSE than I could have believed possible.  This was without a doubt the longest and most unenjoyable 77 minutes I have endured in a very long time.(Sci-Fi lovers should watch ""Crimson Rivers"" a Jean Reno film I have reviewed on Amazon.  ""Event Horizon"" is another fine movie.  And if a 'time-travel' flick is the only thing that will satisfy you, save yourself and just pick any one other than this)""Primer"" was not unlike sitting all day in a barbershop frequented entirely by very old retirees and listening to them rambling, ad nauseum, about nothing. At once having nothing to say, yet constantly and endlessly talking. Failing to hold to one banal theme from beginning to end of each boring and long-running sentence. Or in the rare instance of getting onto something seeming to be remotely of interest, forgetting halfway through the sentence what they'd been talking about in the first place and going on to something else.I died a thousand times during this movie, but sadly the folks who made it kept traveling back in time and reviving me so as to force me to go on! This movie would justify the government in requiring a license for the ownership or possession of a camera. For it is proof that not everybody should be allowed to have one.Someone should go back in time and track down the grandparents of everyone responsible for Primer and sterilize their ancestors at birth, so that this awful nightmare could be prevented in it's entirety.Always a lover of science fiction, I have seen many a time-travel movie, most of them bad, some of them very bad. In choosing to see Primer, my thought was, ""It might be good. Besides, how bad could it be?"" Let me tell you, for seventy seven minutes time nearly stood still, so that when finally I had reached the end and awakened from this horrific and painful nightmare, I felt I had aged about seventy seven DAYS.Forget the death penalty. Take the worst criminals and strap them into a comfortable chair with their eyes taped open. Run an IV with chemicals to keep them awake forever. Play Primer again and again so they are forced to watch it. After the tenth time, let them loose and they will surely gouge out their own eyeballs, stab their eardrums with pencils, weep endlessly and beg for mercy.",1,"Always the optimist, I watched the entire movie, looking for something good to say...",1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,2819,"['Primer', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'FOR', 'students', 'cinema', 'who', 'love', 'art', 'wonderful', 'example', 'way', 'NOT', 'tell', 'story', 'Ultimately', 'still', 'wish', 'could', 'truly', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'NOT', 'see', 'horrendous', 'excuse', 'movie', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'audio', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'confoundingly', 'bad', 'background', 'noise', 'cars', 'passing', 'house', 'other', 'stuff', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'movie', 'were', 'always', 'louder', 'dialogue', 'was', 'GOOD', 'news', 'inasmuch', 'dialoge', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'WORSE', 'could', 'have', 'believed', 'possible', 'was', 'doubt', 'longest', 'most', 'unenjoyable', '77', 'minutes', 'have', 'endured', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Sci-Fi', 'lovers', 'should', 'watch', 'Crimson', 'Rivers', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'film', 'have', 'reviewed', 'Amazon', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'fine', 'movie', ""'time-travel"", 'flick', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'satisfy', 'save', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'other', 'Primer', 'was', 'not', 'sitting', 'day', 'barbershop', 'frequented', 'entirely', 'very', 'old', 'retirees', 'listening', 'rambling', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'nothing', 'once', 'having', 'nothing', 'say', 'yet', 'constantly', 'endlessly', 'talking', 'Failing', 'hold', 'one', 'banal', 'theme', 'beginning', 'end', 'boring', 'long-running', 'sentence', 'rare', 'instance', 'getting', 'something', 'seeming', 'be', 'remotely', 'interest', 'forgetting', 'halfway', 'sentence', 'what', ""'d"", 'been', 'talking', 'first', 'place', 'going', 'something', 'else.I', 'died', 'thousand', 'times', 'movie', 'sadly', 'folks', 'who', 'made', 'kept', 'traveling', 'back', 'time', 'reviving', 'so', 'force', 'go', 'movie', 'would', 'justify', 'government', 'requiring', 'license', 'ownership', 'possession', 'camera', 'proof', 'not', 'everybody', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'have', 'one.Someone', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'track', 'down', 'grandparents', 'everyone', 'responsible', 'Primer', 'sterilize', 'ancestors', 'birth', 'so', 'awful', 'nightmare', 'could', 'be', 'prevented', 'lover', 'science', 'fiction', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'time-travel', 'movie', 'most', 'bad', 'very', 'bad', 'choosing', 'see', 'Primer', 'thought', 'was', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'Besides', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'Let', 'tell', 'seventy', 'seven', 'minutes', 'time', 'nearly', 'stood', 'still', 'when', 'finally', 'had', 'reached', 'end', 'awakened', 'horrific', 'painful', 'nightmare', 'felt', 'had', 'aged', 'seventy', 'seven', 'DAYS.Forget', 'death', 'penalty', 'Take', 'worst', 'criminals', 'strap', 'comfortable', 'chair', 'eyes', 'taped', 'open', 'Run', 'IV', 'chemicals', 'keep', 'awake', 'forever', 'Play', 'Primer', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'tenth', 'time', 'let', 'loose', 'will', 'surely', 'gouge', 'out', 'own', 'eyeballs', 'stab', 'eardrums', 'pencils', 'weep', 'endlessly', 'beg', 'mercy']",Primer

I was told it was done with an extraordinarily low budget, but it doesn't seem like it. Of course, the guys who made it are all engineers, so they were able to cluge together the things they needed for it. In fact, it comes off rather like a true story they way they did it.A group of four engineers are working on something in the garage of one of their homes, and I must say it is not obvious what they were planning to create. What they got started out being some sort of super-efficient energy source, so that may be what was intended. But what they ended up with was a time machine. Not like the H.G. Wells type that takes you forward or backward to a specified time. It's more like the time turner that Hermione Granger used in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Of course, there are paradoxes to avoid, but that's no problem. They just look up what stock has increased in value the most, then go into the time reversal machine (stored in a storage bin they rented), and when they come out, go buy a bunch of that stock.The real problem comes when they get word that a former boyfriend of one of their friends came into a party and started shooting. Of course they want to go back and change things so nobody gets hurt.If you can follow the permutations of the action, and realize which ""edition"" of the two men who are moving through time you see at a given time, you're more clever than I am. I think I'd have to see it several more times to get it all straight.It's a mind-blower, an amazingly clever plot, and my hats are off to these guys for a very good movie on what was allegedly about $7,000 budget.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[41, 72]","Aaron and Abe are two brainiac engineers trying to come up with a new concept that'll help them get published and, hopefully, make them some money. But nothing seems to be working in their favor ...until ...they accidentally stumble upon something of a time machine while working in Abe's garage. At first it just seems to be a machine that can decrease the size and weight of an object, something that could save companies like NASA billions of dollars in payload lifting. But they soon find that the machine ISN'T decreasing weight and size, it's moving the item back in time.Initially Abe and Aaron use their newfound discovery to help them make money (they travel back one day in time to find out what the stock market was doing and put their money into stocks that blossom the next day). But the risks are greater than they could've imagined. You've got to stay away from anyplace that your double might be, and you can't interact with anyone on your trip back or you could screw up the time-line. What they don't know, couldn't know really, is that they've gone into a time loop (something that repeats itself over and over and over again), but the loop changes because of what each of them knows about the future and what they can get out of it.***********************************************************************************If this sounds confusing, it is. The concept is beyond the grasp of normal individuals (with the exception being time theorists and engineers), so that's partly why I only gave it three stars.The incredible thing about the film that made it watchable is that the concept, although REALLY out there, was fresh. There was no time machine, per se, but a little box that resembled a coffin in which you stuck yourself into while your doppleganger wandered around and did your bidding. Again, don't get your brain into a twist over this; it's complicated science.The filming was pretty amazing, too. Done on a shoestring budget of just $7,000, it looks and feels like a professionally shot movie. There's no wobbly camera movements, no out of focus shots, etc. There were a few times when the sound was less than optimal, but it wasn't anything that bothered me too much.The parts of the film that bothered me most were the dialogue and the out-of-reach message that most movie viewers will never, ever get. The dialogue was both beyond me (I'm not an engineer or a time theorist) and difficult to hear due to overlapping conversations. Now I know that this might be how real engineers talk, but does that translate into good dialogue on film? I think not. The message of the film is in there, but it's buried so deeply in the engineer double-speak and concept of the movie that most viewers will never be able to find it.This isn't the type of film you can watch once and think you have a grasp of what it's all about. Trust me, it'll take at least three viewings.What surprises me most is that this film won the Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. A science fiction movie? Winning an independent film award?

Still, I'm a sucker for festival award winners, so I rented ""Primer,"" which won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance.  In addition, I heard this was made for $7000, on par with the classic ""El Mariachi,"" so that caught my interest.I was surprised to find that ""Primer"" looked so much like a movie - something very difficult to do for so little money, especially when shooting on film.  The composition, the camera motion, and the lighting were on par with much more expensive movies.  Lighting can be one of the toughest things for a new filmmaker to master, but in virtually every shot the lighting works.  The camera work was excellent, and by and large the actors were surprisingly good.The biggest problem with ""Primer"" is the fact that it has a lot of story to cram into a short running time, and that story is pretty confusing at best.  It's difficult to tell a time-travel story where multiple incarnations of the same person are in that story; there needs to be some way to tell them apart.  Some visual shorthand, some dialogue cues, something.  Yet, toward the end of this film, some events happen that are tremendously confusing, and we get no help from the movie or the commentary in figuring them out.  As a result, the ending loses some of the impact I think it was meant to have.  To me, this was the greatest failing of ""Primer,"" and why it gets 4 and not 5 stars.  Adding to the confusion factor is the fact that the actors intentionally talk over each other a lot in the first part of the movie, so that the audience doesn't get some pieces of what's happening.Still, this movie is quite an accomplishment, especially for the money.  And while it can be confusing, it never fails to engage your interest.

You lose very little if you don't know about superconductors, magnetic field strength, oscillations and etc.  Just pay close attention to who goes back in time, when they do it, and what happens as a result, and you'll have plenty to contemplate.I have read and watched countless time travel stories, and I have never seen any other story that used Primer's concept.  I gave the movie five stars in spite of a few flaws in photography and sound because it is such a super piece of work for a first time filmmaker.More than any other story, Primer makes you feel as if its time travel is real, with real consequences.

883559,A3E2X26RAH8NI0,B0007N1JC8,"Cliff Hays ""Cliff Hays""","[1, 1]","Primer is the most realistic science fiction movie I've ever seen, and hands down the best time travel movie of all time! Many time travel stories depend on invoking either nostalgia for long-passed days or dystopian fear of distant futures. Still others depend on far-fetched occurrences and/or special effects to achieve their goal. Primer, on the other hand, is in a class all its own. To begin with, the time travel destinations are only hours or days removed from the present. This is part of what gives the film its very puzzling quality, as people do not age noticeably nor do environments change drastically within a few days time span. As a result of this, the chronology of the film must be deduced primarily from the behavior, intentions, and dialogue of the characters; behavior which is unpredictable, intentions which evolve as the film moves along, and dialogue which is awesomely scientific. As other reviewers have pointed out, the writer/director/protagonist/composer makes no attempt to dumb down the conceptual framework and overall temporal complexity within which the film operates. Primer is difficult to understand. Whether you are a scientist or a science fiction fan, the first time you watch it you will probably only fully comprehend about half of it. But this, for me, is the film's best quality. The urge to rewatch it is immediate due to the fascination invoked by what was not comprehended. At this point I have watched it several times, and each time it makes more sense to me, however I still do not fully comprehend it.Difficulties aside, Primer is a beautiful film with top-notch cinematography and an amazing score. It is very refreshing to see a science fiction film without the standard barrage of computer-generation and overly-dramatic music. Any ""special effects"" experienced are the result of very well-thought-out shots combined with skillful editing.

883565,A2FCL4OC6CJB0X,B0007N1JC8,Devon,"[26, 31]","Engineer turned filmmaker Shane Carruth's debut film, ""Primer,"" examines the overwrought theme of time travel in an expressive, refreshing light.Filmed with a budget of $7,000, which hardly covered the cost of its 16mm film stock and camera rental, ""Primer"" is by no means the next obtrusive sci-fi PG-13 Hollywood blockbuster.  Often compared to ""Memento"" and ""Pi,"" the film utilizes neither special effects nor flashy spectacle, yet creates an astounding world both scientifically complex yet personally grounded.Writer/director/star Carruth's story revolves around four friends who, outside of their suit-and-tie jobs, spend hours of their free time in a garage working on an ambiguous science project.  There are moments of frustration and failure, but ultimately efforts result in a box-like machine that has various unmatchable capabilities; most intriguingly, it can ""degrade"" time.  Given the machine's potential, the men realize that they have created something too dangerous to market.  The question is then, how not let its technology go to waste.Technically, as the story shifts to a focus on the two main characters, Aaron (Carruth) and Abe (up-and-coming actor David Sullivan), ""Primer"" turns to a path frighteningly close to the clich&eacute; time travel story.  While exploiting the possibilities of time travel with newly built human-sized boxes, Abe and Aaron soon realize the inconceivable dangers they have brought upon themselves and those they love.  Haven't we seen this before?However, the film's low budget and close knit cast and crew ultimately shine through brightly.  The Grand Jury Prize at Sundance is not awarded carelessly.  With an entire supporting cast consisting of friends and family of its unpaid stars, who also doubled as the crew, there is a sense of trust and unity emanated by the actors' performances and the film itself.  It becomes clear that the volatile relationship between Abe and Aaron is truly the centerpiece of the film's script.Yet the film's greatest success sadly lies in its ability to confuse the viewer.  The time in which events take place, the characters involved, and the reasons for various actions become blurred.  And with a 78 minute running time, there is certainly a yearning for more.While the scientific aspects of the film are neither sufficiently thorough nor simple, the core of the film lies in its emotion.  ""Primer,"" beautifully shot in an amateur yet sophisticated style, appeals to a mature audience able to delve into the profundity of the human spirit.

Though its production values are terribly low - the film was made for just $7,000 - Primer's discount visuals actually work well within the context of the story itself. Narrow in scale but not in scope, it hones in on a small team of overworked engineers who discover functional time travel by accident, then set about (naturally) exploiting it to solve their money troubles. The air of intensity and excitement is palpable, with an almost nonstop track of dialog running from start to finish, and that really gives the scene a sense of authenticity. True savants, these guys possess excessively bright minds, and clearly their mouths are struggling to keep up with the volume produced by their brains. It would be easy to get lost in the minutiae of what they're saying and miss the forest for the trees, were the discourse not so insanely fast and heavily loaded. We're dealing with a seriously complicated subject matter, after all, and not even the twin geniuses at its epicenter seem to fully grasp the particulars of what they're living through. Let's put it this way: this isn't the first time I've seen the movie, and I still had to look up a summary afterwards to work out a few of the details.

This film is the finest, most logical time travel film I have ever seen, and I need to own a copy!! I haven't seen it since it was new.Not wishing to ruin the flavor of the 151 reviews already present, let me add a few observations:1. There is nothing to regret in this film. Nothing. If they hadn't slowed down the beginning to teach the audience about our own true timeframe, the film would have lost something.2. Have you ever thought of pursuing youself through time to prevent a nasty event? To steal when no one could possibly be looking, only to find someone's watching all the time?--questions that DEFY time-travel storytelling, in this film make the heart of the story.3. I was a bit depressed that they destroyed a Weeble to prove the time machine worked.4. H.G. Wells would have loved these fellas.5. Not since the movie PI have I felt so challenged and inspired by a sci-fi film that felt like a documentary. If any fans recall, PI has that I-am-there feel to it, but THIS film is even better.6. I think--an opinion, that's all--the guys making this film wanted to say something about the morality of the age, and not really time travel. That is why I love the film: it all works on multiple levels, and this led me to wonder if the inspired makers actually did a real-life time-travel test.You can do it. But as a Buddhist of the highest degree, I cannot tell you how. This you must find for yourself. Watch this film a few more times--you'll see. And you won't even need a Weeble.

883577,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0007N1JC8,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Primeris certainly one of the more challenging movies I've seen in a while. Shane Carruth, the director and one of the main actors, gets a lot right, particularly the atmospherics and dialogue. Unfortunately, the film almost seems too focused on these aspects, but leaves viewers confused about the plot. It's an odd film, but one definitely worth checking out if you like thoughtful, cerebral sci-fi.Oddly enough, for a sci-fi movie about time travel,Primer's treatment of science is easily one of the film's strengths. This is no H.G. Wells'The Time Machine, where time travel simply involves a machine with lots of lights and gadgets. Rather, the time machine inPrimeris a much more sophisticated affair. At least the first 20-30 minutes show Carruth and David Sullivan's characters discussing the science behind the machine and sharing the audience's surprise at the discovery of time travel. This stems from Carruth's astute understanding that many key scientific breakthroughs happen through serendipity, not dramatic eureka moments. Sure, much of it is techno-babble, but it's probably the most convincing depiction of a time machine and time travel ever in cinematic history.Unfortunately, the techno-babble at the beginning can be intimidating for many viewers. I understand why Carruth spent so much time on this aspect. It's important to convince the audience to suspend its disbelief regarding time travel (always a tall order). It also sets the mood as the plot moves from science (the wonder of discovery) to ethics (the dilemma of using it). It's a nice transition, but that is perhaps overdone a bit at the beginning.Primeralso makes good use of its very limited budget. The camera angles were consistently interesting and innovative; sometimes up close, sometimes through a window. The video quality is grainy, but rather than looking like a bad transfer to DVD, it gives the film a ""home"" or real-life quality that Hollywood can't capture.The biggest problem I had withPrimeris the plot. It's rather convoluted and I don't feel like the film did enough at the beginning to really make the ending resonate with audiences. I'd say during the first hour the plot is discernible, if not exactly easy to comprehend. However, it's during the crucial last 20 minutes when it's not entirely clear who is doing what, when, how, and why. I watched those last 20 minutes twice and got the gist of it, but couldn't help thinking that there were too many loose threads. There is one plot twists that seems quite important and mysterious, but is never explained.Both characters go off in directions that don't seem to follow from what we know of them - or perhaps the movie doesn't tell us enough about them to understand their character arc. I think a bit more time developing the two main characters and their relationships beyond their time machine work would have helped. It's a shame because perhaps 10 more minutes of plot exposition (at 80 minutes, the film is actually pretty short) would have made this one of the top movies of the past decade",4,"Realistic, but confusing plot",1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,3056,"['Primeris', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'challenging', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Shane', 'Carruth', 'director', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'lot', 'right', 'particularly', 'atmospherics', 'dialogue', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'focused', 'aspects', 'viewers', 'confused', 'plot', 'odd', 'film', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'like', 'thoughtful', 'cerebral', 'sci-fi.Oddly', 'enough', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'Primer', 'treatment', 'science', 'easily', 'one', 'film', 'strengths', 'H.G', ""Wells'The"", 'Time', 'Machine', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'simply', 'machine', 'lots', 'lights', 'gadgets', 'Rather', 'time', 'machine', 'inPrimeris', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'affair', 'least', 'first', '20-30', 'minutes', 'show', 'Carruth', 'David', 'Sullivan', 'characters', 'discussing', 'science', 'machine', 'sharing', 'audience', 'surprise', 'discovery', 'time', 'travel', 'Carruth', 'astute', 'understanding', 'many', 'key', 'scientific', 'breakthroughs', 'happen', 'serendipity', 'not', 'dramatic', 'eureka', 'moments', 'Sure', 'much', 'techno-babble', 'probably', 'most', 'convincing', 'depiction', 'time', 'machine', 'time', 'travel', 'ever', 'cinematic', 'history.Unfortunately', 'techno-babble', 'beginning', 'can', 'be', 'intimidating', 'many', 'viewers', 'understand', 'why', 'Carruth', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'aspect', 'important', 'convince', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'regarding', 'time', 'travel', 'always', 'tall', 'order', 'also', 'mood', 'plot', 'moves', 'science', 'wonder', 'discovery', 'ethics', 'dilemma', 'using', 'nice', 'transition', 'perhaps', 'overdone', 'bit', 'beginning.Primeralso', 'good', 'use', 'very', 'limited', 'budget', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'innovative', 'sometimes', 'close', 'sometimes', 'window', 'video', 'quality', 'grainy', 'rather', 'looking', 'bad', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'film', 'home', 'real-life', 'quality', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'capture.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'withPrimeris', 'plot', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'did', 'enough', 'beginning', 'really', 'make', 'ending', 'resonate', 'audiences', ""'d"", 'say', 'first', 'hour', 'plot', 'discernible', 'not', 'exactly', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'However', 'crucial', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'when', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'when', 'how', 'why', 'watched', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'twice', 'got', 'gist', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'threads', 'one', 'plot', 'quite', 'important', 'mysterious', 'never', 'explained.Both', 'characters', 'go', 'off', 'directions', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'follow', 'what', 'know', 'perhaps', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'enough', 'understand', 'character', 'arc', 'think', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'relationships', 'time', 'machine', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'shame', 'perhaps', '10', 'more', 'minutes', 'plot', 'exposition', '80', 'minutes', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'top', 'movies', 'past', 'decade']",Primer

But that's not the problem with this movie.The script is dense, and about 2/3 of the way through the film, it becomes almost impossible to understand exactly what is happening, and why. But that's not the problem with this movie.If I did watch the requisite number of times needed to figure out the puzzle of what is actually happening in this film, it would not matter, because I do not care about what happens to any of these bland, directionless people. That is the problem with Primer.After finishing the film, I started to go through it again, this time listening to the director's commentary. As he described the rehearsals, how much of the sound had to be redubbed, how the film's only special effects shot was done on his home computer, I thought to myself, 'Even if he eventually does explain the plot to me, I really could care less!' So, I gave up, and saved mysefl the time.I like films that one can watch over and over again, catching new details and enjoying newly-noticed nuance. My Dinner With Andre would be an example of such a film. This movie is not worth watching once, except as a demonstration of what is technically possible on a low budget, filming with Super 16mm film, and editing with a computer. The technique is only worthwhile if you have characters who are worth knowing, and the characters in Primer are hardly more dimensional than the paper the script was printed on.I wasted a free Blockbuster movie rental on this obtuse excuse for drama.

However, if you're into slow-paced, complex, and philosophical films, then chances are you'll love this movie. I myself was a bit bothered by the slow and simplistic approach to a thriller about time travel, but as time past, I found it an enjoyable experience (but not too enjoyable). The only flaws I found was that the film's concept of time travel is so complicated that I doubt I'll ever understand it completely after repeated viewings. And plus, the film does tend to drag in certain places. But that aside, I think the extremely slow pace of the film really works. Unlike most fast-paced films, this film still manages to help us see what's going on (if you don't mind the numerous scientific explanations). And the very little use of music is very effective; I think it shows that time travel may not be as grand and powerful as it seems. In short, Shane Carruth has created a unique sci-fi film. The lack of bombast, quickness, and huge explosions is what makes this very special; it's a film that truly makes us think.

883581,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0007N1JC8,General Zombie,"[21, 23]","'Primer' is a film about that most famed and classic sci-fi concept, time travel.  Many films about time travel simply use it as a plot device, a way to get their characters to a different age, but 'Primer' is one of those works that's interested in the concept of time travel in and of itself, and the complications and paradoxes inherent in such activities.  Needless to say, it doesn't explain or resolve these concerns, indeed they can't be resolved, but it does result in a very interesting, dense film.  Like many, probably most viewers of the film, I wasn't entirely sure what had happened as the film ended the first time around.  I got a better, much more certain grip on it after watching it a second time, and I actually think the movie became a bit less interesting when it's more fully understood, but it's still an intriguing web.The film opens by introducing us to 4 young engineer types who work together on side projects in their spare time.  Frankly, we don't know too much of what they're actually doing, we just watch them work for a while as the group is pared down to two central figures, Abe and Aaron, who create a strange new invention, which they contain in a small steel box.  Even they're not entirely sure what it is or what it does, but their experimenting with it reveals that objects contained within the box are removed from the conventional timeline, and they eventually discover that this device can allow them to travel backwards in time.  The rest of the film shows us the difficulties that come from their experimenting with the machine.  These opening sections alone will doubtless scare some people off, as they're filled with techspeak. It's not as hard to understand as some would have you believe, but maybe I just let the words and concepts I'm unfamiliar with fly by with out concern because, in the end, this stuff doesn't much matter.  They are making.... something, somehow.  How they do it doesn't matter all that much, it's just a play to sell you on the reality of the film and draw you in, and it worked for me, anyway.The time machines themselves are intriguingly different from what you'd usually see in a modern sci-fi film.  Again, they're just boxes, and you travel backwards in time simply by sitting in them after they've heated up.  Furthermore, you only move backwards in real time, i.e. you get in the box at 6 P.M. and stay there for 6 hours and it's now noon.  This sort of time travel is amusingly mundane, allowing for simple practical problems and benefits, and forcing the characters to continuously deal with potential timeline deviations as they're living through an immediate past where their past self currently exists.  Thus, it comes down to living the same day twice, the first time around planning it all out, the second time reaping the benefits.  Of course, the short timeline means that they aren't allowed to advance particularly ambitious goals, not much beyond making money on the stock market, but Writer/Director/Actor/Everything Shane Carruth does a good exploring the sort of complications related to such short distance time travel, and this is where the major intrigue of the film comes in.  For example, Aaron, at one point, brings his cell phone with him on one of their trips, and it rings.  This begs the question, is the time symmetry affected?  Is his other cell phone also ringing?  They don't know.  They also note small, amusing points, like how the storage unit security guard always sees them come in to gain access to the time machine, but never sees them come out, and how they must, the first time thru the day, bring in an extra car in the morning to the storage facility, as the car that they take there won't actually be there yet when they get out.  Obviously, the potential complications of time travel have been considered before, but you usually don't see this kinda contemplation in a film, and it felt relatively new and different to me, anyway.  And, again, it's interesting to see a film with simple, everyday concerns related to time travel rather than just the bigger overlying concepts.The film can be quite difficult to follow, as it, for the most part, simply moves forward in the later timelines of the film, rather than just showing us the very first, original timeline and then the various permutations.  For example, we see that Abe has traveled back in time before we learn that they have the ability to do so--  After all, he traveled back in time to *before* he was actually was able to do so in order to discuss it with Aaron, so this is the scene that we actually watch.  This also allows for some unanswered questions which are legitimately left unanswered.  For example,  at one point they notice that one Mr. Granger has used the time machine and now has a double, but neither they nor us knows why. Again, they haven't told him about it *yet*, so why would they know?  Eventually things spiral out of control, as Aaron and Abe have ideas about manipulating the past beyond simply cheating at the stock market, and they grow paranoid and lose their trust for one another and so on, leading to problems relating to maintaining the timeline and dealing with doubles and so on.  I won't go in to too many specifics, and while the final third of the picture can be tough to follow it is, again, interesting.This film was really shot on the cheap.  Reportedly a miniscule $7,000.  It's a fairly professional affair considering that, cleanly and competently shot, and with acceptable acting.  (Fortunately, the film is very staid, with the characters generally discussing things in a calm manner, thus requiring little real acting or emoting).  The picture is pretty damn grainy at times, and the sound isn't always too hot, but it's never painful to watch, and even has some nice cinematography at moments.Yeah, this is a neat film.  I don't think it's quite the mind puzzle that most people make it out to be, though I certainly don't claim to be 100% sure of everything that happened, but it's definitely a lot more dense and intriguing than the vast majority of the films out there. (I must also note, however, that I don't really think that everything is supposed to tie itself together cleanly and clearly, no matter how carefully you look at it.  Indeed, the fact that it can't all be put together is the major point, and that the situation has become to complicated to be surely dissected.)  Definitely worth a look if this is your kinda thing.Grade: B+",4,Very Interesting,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,6485,"[""'Primer"", 'film', 'most', 'famed', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'concept', 'time',

""Primer"" is definitely not for all audiences, and, truth be told, it's pretty slow going stuff for a good portion of the film.  Nonetheless, my interest never flagged, but was rather piqued and curious more than being merely entertained.Extremely difficult to fully understand, I watched, at times uncertain of what I was hearing and pretty sure that all of this was over my head.  Slowly though, one realizes there are several points in ""Primer"" where things begin to click and make sense.  There was, for me, one particular point which can only be described as a truly ""Aha!"" moment . . . as my jaw hit the floor!""Primer"" is loaded with paradoxes and writer/director and star Shane Carruth clearly acknowledges these, yet even within these limitations - like time travel itself - we watch them expand and contract into permutations that, once understood, are horrifyingly unsettling.This is a movie to watch repeatedly and I can see cults devoted to ""Primer.""  The movie was apparently made for almost nothing and its sets, costumes reflect that - beautifully:  Primer doesn't need them.

883584,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007N1JC8,Grady Harp,"[7, 10]","A strange, creative little film, this.  One that manages to make visual the chaos of quantum physics in the form of human permutations of the disorder and bizarre combination of marvel and fear that confront the mind upon a moment of discovery of a new fact/concept. This is a film that should be viewed by an  audience prepared to engage those parts of the brain not usually readily accessible, but available cellules of new thought chambers that need and should be challenged if we are to continue to cope with a universe increasingly less understandable the more we study it.Beginning with the title, PRIMER, no insight is presented as to whether the meaning is 1) introductory text: a book that provides an introduction to a topic, or 2) as in  biochemistry: genetic material - a molecular substrate such as a DNA molecule needed in the polymerization reaction that produces another molecule structurally similar to the substrate.  That is the beginning hurdle.  But if the viewer stumbles on the easy bumps, then the remainder of the story will be impossible.  Instead it is recommended that this film be approached with a 'tabula rasa' and simply watch as four young men bent on inventing the next big 'thing' fall into discovery of what appears to be a device that involves time travel, both horizontal and vertical.  The characters (Shane Carruth, David Sullivan, Casey Gooden, and Anand Upadhyaya) resemble talking heads and it is the dissolution of this quartet into a duet that supplies the human-interest aspect of this science experiment.  First, discovery, then analytical permutations, and ultimately greed and the accompanying human foibles that are sparked by the new.This is very obviously a low budget work of love by writer/director/actor/cinematographer/producer/musical scorer/editor Shane Carruth (yes, he does it all) with all of the other tasks being accomplished by the remaining members of the cast.  The idea of the film is good and the fellows pull it off well.  If the dialogue becomes annoyingly verbose and abstract and covered by a rather pompous voice-over commentator, just rest assured that much of it isn't decipherable because of the quality of the sound and the fact that everyone talks simultaneously.  And if at the end of the film you are left scratching your head as to what you have just seen, then try to quickly summarize quantum physics or the chaos theory or even something as simple as molecular biology!  It is not meant to be simple, it is meant to approximate the terror and joy of confrontation with the frontiers of science and examine how inventions dealing with the chaos theory are inexorably linked with human frailties.  At a budget of $7,000.  this film relies more of personal commitment on the part of the crew than on the need to create a blockbuster movie.  Exercise your mind - try it.

883587,A3CALY5BP8OQ9C,B0007N1JC8,Infinite Loop,"[3, 8]","Normally, I'd preface this type of review with a bold ""SPOILER ALERT"", but I suspect those who've yet to see this film couldn't make sense of the spoilers anyway. I'm not sure one can really ""spoil"" such a convoluted plot even if they tried.I'd like to give this film 5-stars for its originality and a very creative concept in the best tradition of Arthur C. Clarke (as noted is a few other reviews), but a lot of that creativity was lost on a plot that became too obtuse and burdensome for its own good -- which is why I have to give it a 1-star.  I like films that are intellectually challenging but prefer not to have my brain fried during the experience. And that's the quandary I had with ""Primer"", it was too smart and too film-school artsy for it's own good; it's one ripping science fiction yarn that kinda went off into the film festival weeds with way more abstraction than what was needed to tell a relatively simple, but good, story.The main stumbling block for me:  the plot could've been greatly simplified without losing its appeal. The audience really deserves a few more clues and guideposts along the way to make the cinematic journey that much more enjoyable without sacrificing artistic creativity or the intended meaning of the film. As any good writer knows, stay out of the way of a good idea and let the words flow naturally -- don't embellish, don't add unnecessary artifices for the sake of appearing ""artistic""!On the plus-side, I enjoyed the style and texture of the film from a geeky-person's point of view; the scripting was so natural I thought I was watching a historical documentary. No CGI, no special effects of any kind (although that levitation machine they build in their garage was kind of cool). You don't need a lot of zap-bang-boom-pow effects, battling mega-robots, mindless car chases with somersaulting SUV's, naked body-doubles performing simulated sex to keep people's attention when you have a GOOD STORY to tell!On the minus side: the plot had WAY TOO MANY versions of Aaron, Abe, boxes and fail-safe boxes to keep track of without the aid of a spreadsheet. What the story lacked was just enough continuity to hold the plot together long enough for people to figure out what was going on. I eventually figured out most of it -- except for the the final scene in the ""warehouse"". Frankly, I think there were points in the film where the writer/director/actor wasn't entirely sure what was going on.It seems clear to me (after multiple viewings) that the ""beginning"" of the film really wasn't the beginning at all given that the first rendition of Abe was, in fact, a time traveler who made the first trip in the machine and traveled back six hours to inform his partner, Aaron (sitting on the park bench) that the trip was successful. He proved it buy taking Aaron to the storage facility where we see the ""original"" Abe returning to the machine after leaving the hotel.  After that, things got real complicated to the point where we have not one but THREE Aarons running around -- ""hoodie"" Aaron, ""original"" Aaron locked up in an attic and rendition #2 Aaron.  Now add in another version of Abe to the mix along with two ""fail safe"" machines and you have a real mess.  Oh, and don't forget, these time machines are portable -- you can fold one up and take with you back to the past.  Enough, already!!!!!!Which brings us to the brief final scene: one of the Aarons splits from one of the Abe's at the airport and ends up in this big warehouse directing some sort of activity, presumably building a larger version of the time machine. Many commentators & reviewers saw no special significance in this scene, but I thought it was a rather odd way to end the movie, especially given the low budget -- why shoot unnecessary footage?  And what was with the French-speaking dude directing that crowd of hard-hatted works in the warehouse?I now believe the entire movie was intended to depict a corrupted time line from the get-go and the Aaron we saw in the warehouse was, in fact, the original Aaron (as opposed to the Aaron locked in the attic).

883589,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B0007N1JC8,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[11, 12]","My husband is a HUGE fan of time travel movies, and when he heard about a film called Primer winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, he wanted me to keep an eye out for it to add to our online rental queue.There's a whole lot of talking in the first 15 minutes or so. It's kind of aggravating because you can't hear what they're saying because they're speaking over each other. (Found out later when listening to the director commentary that it was rehearsed many, many times...to give a feel of improvisation).I had a feeling that if we hung in there, we'd be rewarded. Some movies...you just get that feeling.Yes, the plot is convoluted. The director wanted to stay true to ""real science"", so the back-and-forth talking was, well, real science. I just wished that it was mentioned early on just *what* they were building in the garage! (You find out through the director commentary that they were building a superconductor. Don't remember even hearing that in the movie.) Rather, there's a lot of techno-speak about freon, freezing points, and so on.I have to say that I knew nothing about this film when watching it. I was struck by some of the unusual camera angles...I felt like I was watching art. The acting was incredibly believable, and the sound ""effects"" were organic and analog. Found out through the commentary that this was the director's precise intent. You don't get the feeling that you're watching a slick Hollywood production; instead, you feel like you're literally a part of these guys' pet projects.As time goes on, tension builds and a sense of foreboding enters the picture. There were quite a few scenes where I gripped my husband's hand and my stomach was in knots. I said to him ""Man, this is like a horror film!"" I don't like slashers, or even horror films, but my idea of ""horror"" was the implications of what those guys were doing in the garage...and then, later, in the U-Haul storage center.Surprisingly, the director and writer was also the main star. He's a *wonderful* actor that looks a bit like Keanu Reeves. The guy playing Abe was just as good. And the shots...to *think* that this guy filmed in his proverbial backyard is amazing. There's some really great shots in this film. And you know what? I didn't even notice the music until the second play-through with the director's commentary. To me, that's good music editing...when you don't even know it's there. (And yeah, the director did the music, too...on his computer!)The movie's ending is confusing, and I still am not sure about some of the elements. When you're dealing with time-travel scenarios and messing with the future, you'll have that, I guess.If you're the type of person that wants/needs everything spelled out for you, you may not like this film. If you need ""the point"" on a proverbial billboard, or want mile-a-minute MTV-like action, you may not like this film. But if you're fascinated by the idea of time travel and other scientific ""what ifs?"", you'll likely enjoy this cerebral movie. If you enjoy subtlety as is seen in movies such as Office Space, Pieces of April, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.-- as well as flicks that are compellingly character-driven--you'll likely love this movie. Those who appreciate the art of filmmaking will no doubt enjoy this movie as well...especially after you hear the director's commentary (and what went into making this film.) And contrary to what another reviewer said, not ALL shots were done in one take. This movie wasn't done slipshod and then sent off to Sundance. A lot of care went into this movie...with Shane and his co-star rehearsing one scene (a dialogue) for two months.I'm excited to see more from this filmmaker, writer, and actor. He is truly a talented guy...as is his main co-star and the other actors (one of which is also the cameraman).Note: the DVD said it was R rated for brief language, but I can't remember one curse word being uttered!

Although it will become confusing as the story progresses, I found Primer to always be engaging and thought provoking even when you're completely lost.  Because the characters are pretty lost too!About half way through the movie I quit trying to keep up with who was who or how they arrived at the point they were at any given moment.  I simply listened and pondered at the ""endless permutations"" that were possible.  I also knew that I would watch the film again immediately.  After doing so, I can safely say that Primer is a completely different film the second time through.  You begin to realize that not everything was as it seemed the first time.  It's a richly rewarding film upon repeated viewings and I didn't find this arduous but instead quite a pleasurable fact of the film.  Further, I really like the way the writer/director handles the subject of time travel.  It isn't hokey or comic book in its approach.  But I caution that this film is not for the lazy movie watcher.

My advice...don't sweat it.From a sci-fi fan point of view this movie is a great exploration of the consequences of time travel.Due to it being about time travel, once i realized this, I had to pay attention.The premise of the time travel was different than I had been exposed to before, and i liked it.I enjoyed that the movie was done in a way, that for me at least, left me thinking about where the loops started.I took from the events that we were stepping into the plot at a point after the time experiments began, but that could be because I think linearly.Overall, if yo can get past the production quality, and what seems like jumping about, but isn't or is depending on how you perceive time travel i think it was well done.If you like nice tidy endings that leave no room for questioning the events, this may not be for you.",4,Non science genius review!,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1140,"['tend', 'watch', 'movies', 'i', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'those.While', 'slow', 'first', 'i', 'admit', 'not', 'being', 'science', 'whiz', 'other', 'reviewers', 'interesting', 'go.I', 'admit', 'great', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'was', 'either', 'head', 'i', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'well', 'My', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'it.From', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'great', 'exploration', 'consequences', 'time', 'travel.Due', 'being', 'time', 'travel', 'once', 'i', 'realized', 'had', 'pay', 'attention.The', 'premise', 'time', 'travel', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'been', 'exposed', 'i', 'liked', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'least', 'left', 'thinking', 'where', 'loops', 'started.I', 'took', 'events', 'were', 'stepping', 'plot', 'point', 'time', 'experiments', 'began', 'could', 'be', 'think', 'linearly.Overall', 'yo', 'can', 'get', 'production', 'quality', 'what', 'jumping', 'about', ""n't"", 'depending', 'how', 'perceive', 'time', 'travel', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'done.If', 'nice', 'tidy', 'endings', 'leave', 'room', 'questioning', 'events', 'may', 'not', 'be']",Primer

I love it when a film assumes its audience has some intelligence and imagination! This is the best time-travel Sci-Fi film I have ever seen. It addresses the complex physical and philosophic implications, and the writing is extremely tight. One picks up on new things with each viewing. On my short list of films worth owning.PACE The movie is NOT slow, but IS dialogue-based. Some confuse action with pace. The dialogue is dense and moves quickly.SUBTLETY Nothing in this film is spelled out in big neon letters and shoved down your throat. The acting is far from over the top: no big gestures, or gut wrenching scenes of emotional agony. Important moments pass by without close-ups, pauses, musical queues or other typical ""important moment markers"" found in most films. One must pay attention.HOLES Some events are not explicitly shown or explained. These holes must be filled in by one's imagination. This requires complex puzzle solving type of thinking which can be painful for two reasons. First, this is almost never required by your typical movie. Second, not everybody thinks like this or enjoys puzzles. I love it when movies call for imagination.PLOT The plot is NOT incomprehensible. Even the complexities of the time lines have been meticulously analyzed and are available on-line (do a search for ""Primer timeline""). It IS complex and challenging. Guess some don't like that.ACTING I found their portrayal of young entrepreneurial engineering science geeks rather convincing. Also see SUBTLETY. No David Carusoian over acting here!SCIENCE They make no effort to present the scientific aspects in layman's terms. But it doesn't matter. While some people may want to understand the physics, math and mechanics behind their invention, it is not relevant to the other aspects of the plot.

Although it is an intriguing time-travel movie, it isn't an overtly dramatic film, and it's dialogue heavy in a way that doesn't really reveal (or differentiate) character or create plot momentum; there is a LOT of technical talk, and often talk substitutes for dramatic action.Still, what this filmmaker managed to do on a miniscule budget is amazing. It IS a good story, and original story. And the commentary was for me as interesting as the movie itself.  Carruth not only wrote, produced, directed, and acted in the film, he did the over-dubbing and special effects--effects done with a camcorder and his home pc.  Weebles figure significantly in the movie--these he picked up on E-bay.

It's got a lot of low tech engineero-babble in it that actually sounds pretty good (I am one of their kind, and can speak their language).  With the exception of the weeble-coating slime-mold clue, it comes across as ""believable"". Very original and ballsey for a first time indy project, so a lot of credit is due, BUT, this movie fails in the fundamentals.Doesn't a movie owe it to a viewer to at least be understandable on some level during the first viewing? Isn't that a fundamental part of the movie art form, a reasonable expectation of a viewer? I don't mind a good head-fake ending, like Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, or Fight Club. Even a thick plot like Heat, or Memento may take multiple viewings to fully appreciate all the connections, but all of those projects provide a payoff for the first time viewer.Primer on the otherhand is just an excercize in manipulation. Too clever by half. Being intentionally indecipherable, it is inaccessable, and therefore not really art, and not really much of a movie. The techno babble, the lack of any warmth or arc or discernable motivations, the extraordinarally poor audio, all of it knee-caps this thing before it even starts to move.  The entire viewing experience is a let down.  I've seen it twice, but haven't gotten much in the way of genuine enjoyment out of it. And I also have to throw the flag on the Sundance award given to this movie.

For $7,000 -- if I understand correctly -- he's got an independent release that garnered him Independent Spirit Award nominations for Best Director & Best First Screenplay.  You want to cheer for the film because both Carruth and David Sullivan are nice looking leads who look as good in button-down shirts with ties as they do in their boxers crawling out of the big blue box.  Independent Spirit nominated blond David Sullivan for best debut performance.  Casey Gooden, Anand Upadhyaya & Carrie Crawford who round out the cast all have first time film credits.The dynamic between the two leads is interesting as they consider the ethical considerations of issues at the same time they try to defraud the stock market.

883614,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0007N1JC8,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[23, 25]","TRESCA-PRIME: Primer is a no-frills science fiction film that details a realistic portrayal of time travel.  Like Donnie Darko, it examines what happens when humans discover they can influence time...and then just how little control they really have over it.  Aaron (Shane Carruth) and Abe (David Sullivan) struggle to create a magnetic invention in their garage, only to stumble upon time travel.  And once Pandora's Box is opened, there's no going back.  In no time (pun intended), they're sending themselves into the past.  This leads to a perpetual struggle to avoid paradoxes that most time travel stories don't consider. When duplicate cell phones are in the same time stream, which one rings first? Can you really avoid changing the outcome of reality simply by avoiding your prime self? And who is really the ""first"" prime anyway?  The film explores all these possibilities, which makes it an interesting ""what-if"" scenario that exponentially spins more and more questions. That said, I have to admit that my first viewing of Primer wasn't all that favorable.  The dialogue sounds like it came out of Clerks, the film is often grainy and choppy, and there's almost no action whatsoever throughout the script.  Perhaps my future selves will have a different opinion.TRESCA-2: On second viewing, the term ""Primer"" takes on new meaning.  Primer can mean an introductory textbook, and indeed we discover that Aaron was providing a guideline for future events to his Prime self--in other words, a textbook of sorts as to how to relive his life again without causing a paradox.  Primer can also mean white paint, used coat something for the first time.  As Aaron discovers he can go back in time, he begins to whitewash events, making himself look like a hero and giving himself the best possible outcomes.  But are these changes merely cosmetic, like paint?  Finally, there's the notion of Primer as an explosive, setting off a disastrous chain of events.  And the end of the film leaves us with the certainty that something very bad is about to happen.TRESCA-4: Another alternative my former selves hadn't thought of was Primer as being first and primary.  Once Aaron discovers the ability to create multiple versions of himself, he becomes increasingly obsessed with controlling them.  And of course, each Aaron in the past feels exactly the same way. So how do you become the prime?  How do you become the person who is control of your own destiny?  How do you become your own God? Aaron and Abe (Abraham) are Biblical names and their inclusion is certainly not an accident.TRESCA-8: Seeing the movie again really makes you appreciate exactly how much work went into crafting Primer.  Dialogue and scenes that seem odd and disjointed make perfect sense when you realize it's the time doubles tweaking the timeline. The more duplicates that get involved, the more the film becomes fuzzy and unfocused, a sometimes annoying but important visual cue.  And always there is the suspicion that something is off, from the ""rats in the attic"" to Abe waking up laying face down on the floor, to the fact that Aaron doesn't want to ""talk to those kids who hang out"" with Abe.  Why?  Multiple viewings tie it together.TRESCA-16: Primer is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of time travel science in recent memory, but that doesn't necessarily make it an engaging film.  Primer strains our patience.  Most of the time, the characters stand around chatting with each other from innovative camera angles.  The climactic moment, a scene where an ex-boyfriend shows up with a shotgun at a party, is never even shown.  And the grainy footage, the monotone dialogue, the talking-over-each-other style of acting, all make the film seem more like a reality show than a movie.  It doesn't have the slick sensibilities of Donnie Darko or the neatly wrapped storyline of Groundhog Day.  And yet, the nihilistic outcome of the film is too powerful to ignore, sticking with you through multiple future viewings.In short, Primer is both a fantastic piece of thoughtful science fiction and a challenging viewing experience.  By all means watch it.

With it, they open Pandora's box and a metaphysical can of worms.What I like the most about the film is what will likely turn some viewers off: its elliptical and condensed style and dialogue.  It is that these engineers speak like engineers.  They talk to each other as if they each actually know something, and they'd be impatient and annoyed if they were expected to repeat or explain themselves.  You could say they out-mamet David Mamet, by acting like what they are supposed to be, highly intelligent inventors (rather than like Hollywood movie stars pretending to be academics).  You are either in it and know what's going on, or you don't and if you don't don't bother asking.  So when one of them slows down and starts explaining, leading his partner through the process of figuring out just what it is their device does, you really have to pay attention.This is the kind of film that the Sundance film festival - where I saw this first and where Primer won the Grand Jury Prize - was made to celebrate.  It is inventive and unsettling, thoughtful and provocative, and makes maximum use of a very low budget.  I can't believe they made this for seven grand and favors!

883622,A15ZZDKRKP7L4R,B0007N1JC8,Nick Tropiano,"[1, 2]","I was as confused as anyone else starting with ""Act II"" of this film.  I have this film figured out and have solved the mystery, me thinks.  No, it had nothing to do with the assorted websites and diagrams devoted to the paradoxes of time travel and ""Weeble"" creation (duplicates) pertaining to this film's uncharacteristically intelligent take on time travel.  I figured it out when I learned of Primer's humble microbudget of a $7000.  With this budget, nearly every penney had to have gone to Super 16 film stock and lab fees.  I thought this film was shot on video (which is fine) - looked it, and assumed so given its budget, but was perplexed by selective focus and scenes containing ""bokeh"" (generally film-only).  Often, long-term ""labor of love"" indies are shot sequentially or near sequentially, unlike big budget pics, which ironically are shot way out of sequence around location availability, sets, and actor schedules.  So, here's my theory - it's simple.  The film was shot sequentially, with the quite credible and well-handled ""accidental invention of the time machine"" sequences happening first as it was in the script. There was only so much film stock available - and once that was gone, that was it.  Too much precious film stock was used up early on - perhaps the actors couldn't do the 1:1(?) OR 2:1 tight shooting ratio, leaving not enough film left to explore the paradoxes in the 2nd half of the script.  This resulted in (in my opinion) an unbalanced film that spends too much time on the creation of the time machine, and not nearly enough exposition time in the second half to explain the paradoxes and duplicates - or even get into the deterioration of the relationship between Aaron and Abe.  The first half sucks you in, and the second half plays out like you have your DVD running at 4X speed - with just ""snippets"" of scenes wizzing by giving you a sketch of what's happening but no where near enough data to process to approach anything other than partial coherence at best (and most likely utter cluelessness...)  Now, what I've proposed is admittedly pure speculation but that's my guess.  Somehow, through clever editing or a ""happy accident"" - whatever, it all manages to work, and the net-net is a pretty compelling and certainly unique little indy time travel flick.  - Excellent natural performances, excellent time-travel concept, very good natural dialog, compositions are often outstanding (though not the best Super 16 transfer I've ever seen), acceptable audio and minimal but unobtrusive and appropriate score all add. Primer does somehow manage ultimately to work as a riddle - so in my speculation/opinion, hours were spent editing to salvage it from an incomperhensal, unreleasable, and unwatachable mess.  And while perhaps not hitting a ""home run"" in the process, hit a safe by a nose triple.  I watched it twice, and went to the 'Net to get ""cheats"".  Any film that manages to get me to do this earns a solid four stars in my book.  Primer is a flawed but compelling sci-fi film - a little overrated perhaps, but certainly worth your time.

The audio isn't pristine, the video isn't always in perfect focus, the story doesn't have a full explanation for it's conclusion.I would like to focus on what this movie is:  Brilliant.  Being a free lance videographer I know the difficulties of producing something when you're giving two apples and a piece of lent as a budget.  You have to be quite a few things.  You have to be creative with a story, you have to learn to work with what you have, and you must be able to take a stereotyped culture and make them forget that you're doing both of the previous things.People the actors are also the writers are also the camera men.  It was done for under 10,000 dollars.  Considering most movies run at a price of 10,000 dollars PER SECOND the feat is even more admirable.  I commend these people for showing the rest of us what you can do with using unique camera angles, a solid script, and a few tricks the old fashion way.

883624,A22JPMJTJFIVKB,B0007N1JC8,NSCPE,"[4, 5]","""Primer"" is a very cool and somewhat creepy time travel film. In short, it's about two guys, Abe and Aaron, who (accidentally) build a device that allows them to travel back in time. They do the standard things a novice time traveler would to--play around with the stock market, test out some minor paradoxes, re-shape certain events in their favor, etc. Eventually, they discover that a third party knows about their device, and chaos ensues (sorry--I don't want to give away too much at this point).The plot is extremely complex. Not only are there multiple timelines to consider, but there's a power play going on between Abe and Aaron in that whoever uses the device the most and whoever sets it earliest will have an advantage over the other in that they will have more knowledge of future events.The film is also fairly realistic in that it doesn't rely on special effects and that it mixes just enough science fact in with the fiction in order to make it plausible. Plus, it's well-acted--you get the sense that this is how events would unfold if a time machine were really invented in someone's garage.The reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the plot is a little *too* complex for such a short movie (only 76 minutes). Too much goes on behind the scenes, and the viewer is left to figure out too much for themselves. If it's too confusing, there are numerous timelines posted on the Internet that help put things in perspective.In summary, if you like weird independent films or hard sci-fi, then you'd like this movie.

Suddenly, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all......"".""Primer"" might be the greatest inside joke on audiences since the 1938 radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"".  It was meant to be confusing and subject to multiple interpretations.  There is a relatively restricted voice over narration which breaks with film convention by being unreliable, adding yet another layer of vagueness to the story.  ""Primer""  requires engaged viewers to give free reign to their imaginations, and since the commercial films these viewers have been consuming are too structured for multiple interpretation, the novelty causes some of them to proclaim it a work of considerable genius.Indeed its subject matter, the perils and paradoxes of time travel set in motion by an inexplicable amoral character (Aaron - versions one, two, and three) with futile fixes by an equally inexplicable moral character (Abe - versions one and two), present quite a cerebral challenge to a viewer seeking such a challenge.  Unfortunately all this is at the expense of concurrent suspense or on-screen entertainment value; there is plenty of fun to be had with this film, but the enjoyment comes retrospectively after the initial viewing.In ""Primer"" time travel is only possible to the past where the traveler must mark time in real hours before a return to the present, the time machine cannot be used to leap forward into the future.  And one can only travel back to the point at which the time machine first existed (there must be a time machine in the past from which a person can emerge).  It presents time travel as a process where causality does not affect the time traveler.  Making it the flip side of ""Back to the Future"",  whose premise was the peril to Marty McFly's existence should he alter the events that led to his being born.  ""Primer's"" time travelers can alter past events and thereby change the future, but the corporeal form that time traveled to the past is immune from the consequences of their actions;  thus any number of the same person can exist simultaneously.The film itself is a poorly told narrative whose assorted deficiencies (be they deliberate, necessary economies, or just general laziness) are disguised behind a smokescreen of non-unified, noncontiguous representations of space and time (literally and figuratively); with segments and timelines full of jump cuts and inserts that fracture the sequencing.  If you listen to the commentaries on the DVD you will find that pre-production was an afterthought and that those associated with the film were generally clueless during its ultra-cheap production phase.Everything happened in post-production, where the motivation was not to assemble the best told version of the story with the material they had shot; but rather a desperate and inventive effort to create enough confusion and ambiguity that the staggering lameness of the actual production would be adequately obscured.  Watch for several occasions where a single segment is cut and the visual pieces re-assembled in a different order, while the audio track plays in its original order.Thus you have a modern day ""Emperor's New Clothes"", a film that exploits the conceit of its most enthusiastic viewer segment.  Rather than appear to be rubes these viewers attribute the confusion to the genius of writer/director/star Shane Carruth.  Even taking it so far as to disparage those who do not enthusiastically embrace the film (note the negative votes for earlier reviews that do not 100% embrace the film - people hate to have it pointed out that they have been duped by a crowd mentality). To be fair, judging from the DVD commentaries no one associated with the film appears to have taken the thing very seriously, or to be terribly taken with themselves, or to be affecting (at least at the time they were taped) any Orsen Welles pretensions.Patrick McGoohan had a similar experience with ""The Prisoner"", a television series that explored deeper subject matter than your standard secret agent show.  A cult developed around the series, attributing intentional symbolism, metaphor, allegory, and philosophical substance to every word, gesture, and production design element.  Although unlike ""Primer"", ""The Prisoner"" was a top quality production that had some profound things to say,  just not to the degree its cult following wants to believe.I continue to enjoy repeat viewings of ""Primer"" and continued speculations about the ramifications of what it presents.  But for the actual exercise of reading a film with a scrambled timeline, I prefer something like ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" (2007);  where the timelines are also fractured and a fair about of expressionistic elements are inserted, but  all done by design in the service of inventively telling the story and better communicating the themes.Then again, what do I know?

Too bad he can't play a tune. The film is totally inexplicable on a narrative level. It took quite a while until the premise was even set up-that the two lead characters had inadvertantly created a device that sends things back in time. I was only able to figure this out from their scheme to manipulate stocks or mutual funds to their advantage. That's also about the last thing in the film I could understand. The two talk about the time travel process creating doubles, but this didn't seem readily apparent to me nor was it explained. The film's plot doesn't work and aside from the plot it offers nothing else of merit. The actors are amateurs, the dialogue sounds like what might happen if William Burroughs' cut-up technique was applied to a technical manual and the film is visually uninteresting.Every few years someone comes along with a film supposedly made on a shoestring budget and their triumph of entrepreneurship wows people. That seems to really be the story that people want to hear. The actual quality of the film itself is irrelevant.

883628,A2H4SX356GPXHS,B0007N1JC8,Phil Wernig,"[3, 3]","A time travel story confronts the paradox: how can a traveler to the past avoid affecting the future in uncontrollable ways? ""Primer"" tackles the conundrum with compelling force, cerebral gymnastics and the python grip of inexorable logic.The joke goes: What do they do with engineers who turn 40? They take them out and shoot them.A quartet of engineers who work for a Dallas semiconductor company have decided to pool their talents in their spare time to develop an original invention, a break-through process or a patentable idea that will have commercial applications and deliver them from the dreary tedium of their work-driven lives before the promise of their most productive years slips away and consigns them to permanent disappointment.They are not geniuses. ""Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated. Nothing extreme."" On their best days, they might be considered ""clever.""In their off duty hours they work in long-sleeved shirts and ties. They conduct experiments on the cheap in a garage with borrowed equipment. They buy electronic components from Walmart. They cannibalize a microwave oven, a car, a refrigerator. Brimming with notions, they speak in elliptical sentences and argue briskly in the language of physics and electrical engineering.""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more.""Abe and Aaron are the first to see sparks fly from their flints. After months of fruitless tries, they produce a field in an enclosed box that creates more energy than it uses. ""There was value in the thing."" They knew that. What might be its practical application? ""They were out of their depth."" They realize that ""the easiest way to get exploited was to sell something they did not yet understand."" They decide to cut out their partners.More weeks of hit and miss experiments reveal a stunning fact: their box drew its energy from a continuous feedback loop that could return its contents to the past. They had built a time machine.The next step is inevitable: they must test their device on themselves. They build a pair of coffin-sized boxes to generate their field. Aaron asks, ""What is your opinion on how safe this thing is?""Abe shrugs, ""I can imagine no way in which this thing could be considered remotely close to safe.""The device has its limits. It does not propel its occupants into the future. It can only return them to the moment at which it was activated. Abe and Aaron warm up the boxes for five days, enter them, and return to the past.The practical application is obvious. The device grants them five days of prescience, enough certain knowledge of outcomes to reap fortunes from jackpot lottery numbers, sports wagers, and spectacularly performing market securities.There are also complications. The past is exactly as they have left it and it includes them as they were before they traveled backward in time. They have become their own doubles.They are alert to the peril of discovery by their doubles or by anybody who might detect them in two places at once, wives, relatives, friends, or their partners unaware of their invention. ""If we're playing with causality..."" Abe worries. They take themselves ""out of the equation"" by sequester in an out-of-town motel, disconnecting phones, television, radio - anything that might keep them connected electronically or emotionally to their personal world.Leaving their doubles to continue replaying the crucial five days, Abe and Aaron repeat their trips back to the original moment of their machine's activation, returning each time with an accumulation of knowledge they can transform into exponential growth of bankable cash.Their circuitous repetitions of time travel take a physical toll. Their ears bleed. Their hands lose the ability to fashion script. Their decision-making faculties lose focus. Aaron voices a fantasy of violent confrontation with an obnoxious superior, ""just to know what it feels like"", then explains that he would subsequently prevent himself from the act by intervening before it occurred. Abe reminds him that contact with their doubles must never happen. The consequences would be inconceivable. But ""The idea had been spoken. The words wouldn't go back after they had been uttered aloud.""""I'm not going to pretend I know about paradoxes."" Aaron admits. ""About the worst thing in the world is to know that the moment you're experiencing has already been plotted.""In a moment of shocking clarity, as Aaron and Abe observe their doubles from afar, they realize that they have no way of knowing whether either of them, without the knowledge of the other, has already altered their past. Mistrust has introduced a variable into their equation. The permutations are terrifying.""What's worse,"" Aaron wonders, ""thinking you're being paranoid or knowing that you should be?""Writer/director Shane Carruth, who also edited and stars in the film and composed its music and sound effects, is a one-man band, who produced ""Primer"" on an onion-skin budget, stocked the cast and crew with friends and family, and delivered a taut, intricate, visually arresting, intellectually stimulating gem. Crafting film virtue from raw necessity and quicksilver imagination, Carruth employs low-key realism in cost-conscious characters, tech-heavy dialog, taped-together props, and naturalistic lighting. With quickening pace, the narrative contours move from the familiar to the fantastic. It is a convincing fable of garage science yielding profound innovation with infinite implications.""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more.""

The concepts in this film are based on real research, though obviously taken to an extreme.  The lingo is fairly accurate.  The temporal physics and logic behind the events is spot on.  The more you watch and pay attention to it, the more you'll feel like you've got pop rocks on the brain.  It's exhilerating from a documentary-like objective standpoint and intellectual exploration.  But the acting is also very good with nice pacing within the scenes.  The ending at first seems a bit rushed, yet on further viewings I think it works.  It parallels the rapid spinning out of control that has occured with breaking causal symmetry.  And the last line of the film, a voice over, is pitch perfect.  That's film making.  Great beginnings and great endings with a proper development, connections, and set up between the two.  It's amazing this was done on such a budget.  Sure, it looks like 16mm that wasn't transfered correctly all the time, but it often works better than if it had a bigger budget.  I am eager to see what this writer/director does in the future.

883633,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007N1JC8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 9]","Primer (Shane Carruth, 2004)There are, in general, two kinds of movies. There's the kind that spells everything out, either loading you up with information throughout the narrative or giving you everything at the end, like one of Agatha Christie's detectives in the drawing room, pipe in hand, laying out the criminal's activities for interested guests of the recently departed. The other kind of movie gives you just enough, and makes you work for the rest. I vastly prefer the second type of film.Primer attempts to be the kind of movie that gives you just enough and has you make the rest of the connections in your head, but it falls short in a few places. Shot for just $7,000 (the same budget Robert Rodriguez had for El Mariachi; I've no idea if that will end up meaning anything, but look where Rodriguez is now), it's probably possible to forgive Primer a few of its various shortcomings; after all, with seven grand, you're not going to have a lot of technical wizardry to play with. (One is tempted to draw parallels between the filmmaker shooting for seven grand and the character played by the filmmaker, an inventor who's constantly out of money. One will resist.) What's not forgivable for seven grand are the movie's two main failings. The first is that the script could have used another draft or two; the second is that, as I mentioned before, there are a few places in the movie where we could have been given more detail, enough for us to figure it all out. (I know I'm not alone in not being able to grasp it; I read reviews as well as write them.)The movie revolves around four guys, Aaron, Abe, Robert, and Philip, who by day are drones in corporate America, and by night are fledgling inventors. They've been fledgling inventors forever; they develop a lot of products that are great for niche markets, but have yet to come up with anything that will allow them to quit their jobs and live in the lap of luxury, etc. Then Abe comes up with a machine capable of allowing time travel, and he and Aaron start experimenting.""Ah,"" you say, ""but what happened to Robert and Philip?"" That's the rub. They are conveniently written out of the script during the middle third of the movie (Aaron and Abe bar their access to the garage where the four work by telling them that it's being sprayed for bugs and no one's allowed in), only popping back in at the end for a bit in order to remind the viewer that the director hasn't forgotten about them altogether. Also, Abe and Aaron's significant others appear only when a question needs asked or some seemingly-innocuous tidbit (read: foreshadowing) needs added to the mix. The convenience factor of minor characters is something that has always bugged me; your mileage may vary.As for not quite getting enough, it seems as if the film goes in jags on how it delivers this. During the first part of the movie, when we have more than Aaron and Abe in almost every scene, we get a realistic, but very confusing, depiction of four geeks inventing something-- everyone's talking all at once, and the viewer will never be able to follow it. Even the subtitler, who did a patchy job at best anyway, just gives up most of the time in scenes with simultaneous speech; there are, simply, no subtitles to be had there. (This is one of those films that you need to watch in English with English subtitles, so you can marvel at how things get lost in translation even when it's the same language in two different media.)

At its core it really is.... a primer.  It's a glance at the what/how/whys of the discovery of time travel.  All the elements are there.  And it is truly intended to give you no answers (after all... it's not called ""Conclusions"").My first viewing of Primer was on IFC, and I started watching it 15 minutes into it.  I ended that viewing angry above all else.  I decided there must have been something I missed in that first 15 minutes that ties it all together.So I watched it again, in its entirety.

But they do it, and leave it raw, with the crosstalk, tedious explanations, and egotistical posturing that goes along with any engineer who thinks they're right (believe me... it happens).Then after discovery, it delves into the human condition.  Wanting to exploit it for profit, then considering the moral implications, then devolving into the selfishness of trying to play god.And the way it is filmed, as things progress, there are intentional gaps as timelines become more blurred and disconnected.  This makes Primer incredibly original, and great fun to play with the possibilities.It truly stimulates the mind, and gives you something to walk away with and think about for days after viewing.

For that money they could have enticed kids from the high school drama club to come do some acting for them.There is an inventor's group of 4 guys who get together and bounce ideas off of each other. They are discussing Tesla coils and coming up with a new economic way to reduce temperatures. Two of the four create a small device in their garage. They place an object in the device and slightly weird things happen such as the object weighs less, and the machine can run by itself for short periods of time without power. The object suddenly has a fungus growth on it. They take it to a lab and find out that it is 30 days worth of growth. How could that be? They then place their watch in the device and discover they have a time machine. Yes, they accidentally created a time machine in their garage which violates all the laws of physics the movie was so careful not to cross.They make a larger time machine, big enough for a person. They are at first careful not to come in contact with anything or anyone which might alter the future, most likely an idea the got from watching too many science fiction movies. As time goes by, they get bolder on their interactions and they also use the stock market to their advantage.

Then they discover something shocking, they&#8217;ve created time machines.The question of what do with these machines arises. At first it seems the machines may be commercially valuable, but this proves false. This is when the inventors turn towards using the machines to benefit themselves.One inventor is conscientious from the beginning, while the other inventor is more adventurous. One inventor is wary of the potential dangers while the other inventor ignores them. They both profess their not wanting to alter the past, but each has a different level of commitment to the subject. They both try to keep the project quiet, under wraps from world, but things easily get out of control amongst themselves. Aghast at their errors, they try to set things right, but since time travel functions according unknown sets of laws different from those of linear time, the concocted logical solutions to their problem end up becoming just additional steps towards disaster.Supposedly made for only $7000, this film is a marvel. Not only is it a fascinating story, the camera work and the production value are very good. With long scenes, and thoughtful performances by the cast, this quasi Sci-fi/Arthouse film is a visual pleasure to watch. It doesn&#8217;t screen as a low budget thriller.While Director/Writer Shane Carruth&#8217;s vision isn&#8217;t exactly crystal clear, this mystery is part of the charm. For a film about a complex subject like time travel, the success is in Carruth&#8217;s ability to purvey the concept with very little flare. Everything seems to have aligned perfectly here. That is not to say it is the greatest film ever, but for a movie about such complicated subject matter, the bare-bones approach is very interesting. The script and characters talk about what they know. A narrator fills us in on a few more key details. Then the rest we are left to figure out on our own.

883648,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B0007N1JC8,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[3, 3]","I like a challenge, but this is one of the most confusing movies of all time. Despite its brevity, looping plot, and highfalutin physics dialogue, Primer (2004) still comes away a winner in my book.I am not sure if this movie's circularity actually makes sense. Really. (Chuck Klosterman is said to have seen it seven or eight times and is still not sure what transpired.) The basic premise is that a group of four dudes accidentally invent a time machine in a garage while spending their spare time after their day jobs working on computer hardware. Aaron, the married guy with the garage, and Abe, his single friend, decide to keep the discovery a secret from the two other dudes.If only they could keep the secret from their past selves (or is it future selves?).  Abe decides to fashion a desk-sized version of their first television-sized time travel box. And this is where the movie gets really interesting, raising all kinds of philosophical and existential issues along the way about time and space, morality, and reality.I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that Abe and Aaron start to travel through time. Like any red-blooded American males that have moved beyond college and into the working world, the guys predictably use time travel schemes to boost their financial situations. They exploit the stock market. But, things become less than kosher and fancy free when trust breaks down between Abe and Aaron.The final 15 minutes of this movie are a head-scratcher. There is so much looping and nefarious backstabbing going on between Abe, Aaron, and their ""time doubles"" that I could not follow it. Wikipedia has a nice diagram that explains the time travel device and how it works; I can't understand that, either. I walked away feeling that the creator of this movie is very intelligent, but not in a way that allows him to leave the average viewer (i.e., me) walking away feeling victorious for figuring out the M.C. Escher maze that was laid out. Good luck.I am a fan of short movies, and at 78 minutes Primer is a miracle of efficiency. But, the pithiness of the film was a product of necessity and a small bankroll, so it is possible that my gripes about the last 15 minutes might have been lessened if the director/actor/writer/producer/cameraman in charge of this picture had more film stock to work with. Just another 10 minutes might have relaxed the breakneck pace and confusing looping in the last 15 minutes.One of the most incredible aspects of this film is that it was produced on a $7,000 budget, most of it dedicated to film stock. In the first five to 10 minutes of action, you'll note that the cinematography and sound are not up to big studio snuff. The dialogue seems to overlap, and the acting is wooden. After the time machine is discovered and the plot really kicks into gear, the brilliant story takes over and you forget about the amateur, low-budget feel. You relate to the protagonists, placing yourself into their shoes and considering the implications of the ""fun"" that time travel could provide before the complications rear their ugly heads. The middle of this movie is the satisfying thought-provoker, the beginning the underwhelming physics lesson, and the ending a mystifying quagmire.Primer works if you go in with a little knowledge of the plot, have already slogged through movies like Memento and Inception, and bring your patience ""A"" game. And don't do this one alone. The real fun with a movie like Primer is discussing it with your friends and family afterwards.",3,You'll need a Primer primer.,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,3535,"['like', 'challenge', 'one', 'most', 'confusing', 'movies', 'time', 'brevity', 'looping', 'plot', 'highfalutin', 'physics', 'dialogue', 'Primer', '2004', 'still', 'away', 'winner', 'book.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'circularity', 'actually', 'sense', 'Really', 'Chuck', 'Klosterman', 'said', 'have', 'seen', 'seven', 'eight', 'times', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'transpired', 'basic', 'premise', 'group', 'four', 'dudes', 'accidentally', 'invent', 'time', 'machine', 'garage', 'spending', 'spare', 'time', 'day', 'jobs', 'working', 'computer', 'hardware', 'Aaron', 'married', 'guy', 'garage', 'Abe', 'single', 'friend', 'decide', 'keep', 'discovery', 'secret', 'two', 'other', 'dudes.If', 'only', 'could', 'keep', 'secret', 'past', 'selves', 'future', 'selves', 'Abe', 'fashion', 'desk-sized', 'version', 'first', 'television-sized', 'time', 'travel', 'box', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'interesting', 'raising', 'kinds', 'philosophical', 'existential', 'issues', 'way', 'time', 'space', 'morality', 'reality.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Abe', 'Aaron', 'start', 'travel', 'time', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'males', 'have', 'moved', 'college', 'working', 'world', 'guys', 'predictably', 'use', 'time', 'travel', 'schemes', 'boost', 'financial', 'situations', 'exploit', 'stock', 'market', 'things', 'become', 'less', 'kosher', 'fancy', 'free', 'when', 'trust', 'breaks', 'down', 'Abe', 'Aaron.The', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'head-scratcher', 'so', 'much', 'looping', 'nefarious', 'backstabbing', 'going', 'Abe', 'Aaron', 'time', 'doubles', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'Wikipedia', 'nice', 'diagram', 'time', 'travel', 'device', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'creator', 'movie', 'very', 'intelligent', 'not', 'way', 'leave', 'average', 'viewer', 'i.e.', 'walking', 'away', 'feeling', 'victorious', 'figuring', 'out', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'maze', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'Good', 'luck.I', 'am', 'fan', 'short', 'movies', '78', 'minutes', 'Primer', 'miracle', 'efficiency', 'pithiness', 'film', 'was', 'product', 'necessity', 'small', 'bankroll', 'possible', 'gripes', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lessened', 'director/actor/writer/producer/cameraman', 'charge', 'picture', 'had', 'more', 'film', 'stock', 'work', 'Just', '10', 'minutes', 'might', 'have', 'relaxed', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'confusing', 'looping', 'last', '15', 'minutes.One', 'most', 'incredible', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'produced', '7,000', 'budget', 'most', 'dedicated', 'film', 'stock', 'first', 'five', '10', 'minutes', 'action', ""'ll"", 'note', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'are', 'not', 'big', 'studio', 'snuff', 'dialogue', 'overlap', 'acting', 'wooden', 'time', 'machine', 'discovered', 'plot', 'really', 'gear', 'brilliant', 'story', 'forget', 'amateur', 'low-budget', 'feel', 'relate', 'protagonists', 'placing', 'shoes', 'considering', 'implications', 'fun', 'time', 'travel', 'could', 'provide', 'complications', 'rear', 'ugly', 'heads', 'middle', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'thought-provoker', 'beginning', 'underwhelming', 'physics', 'lesson', 'ending', 'mystifying', 'quagmire.Primer', 'works', 'go', 'little', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'have', 'already', 'slogged', 'movies', 'Memento', 'Inception', 'bring', 'patience', 'A', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'alone', 'real', 'fun', 'movie', 'Primer', 'discussing', 'friends', 'family', 'afterwards']",Primer

And amazing was what was created in the fallout seen in Primer. The explanation is easy enough to give: you have something go into Side A of something and come out Side B when you look at the rules we regularly follow. What if the rules did not apply, however, and what if the thing entering Side A also leaves Side A, pushing aside the constructs of time and crafting a reversal of sorts. It seems endless, like a beautiful thing filled with money and power and promise of the grandest type, until you really think of what could come from creating a truly remarkable breakthrough.You never know who your friends are until you find something to test those waters. Sometimes the adage about you being your own worst enemy - that might possibly be true.I'm not one for the costs of movies, not really impressed with the label ""independent"" slapped on a shaky project, because movies are movies in the end and many aren't given financial backin. Many genre-specific classics were made on shoestring budgets, and entries like cost sort of fall by the wayside when you look at the end product. While I would not call Primer a classic piece of work, I would call it a great movie and would add that I would have never guessed that it was premiered Independently. The camerawork is great, the acting is really good, and the jargon - despite the use of heavy terminology and dose after dose of wording in speeches that explain things - makes things make sense.And make sense they do.When I first watched Primer I found the movie intriguing as a whole because of the way it played through, and because it gave the viewer an idea and started running with it. It took the idea of time and explained how everything worked, allowing a person to pick up with a couple of friends and continue through a corridor of oddity until...well, until a climax is beautifully rendered. It really got my attention.The reviews on the movie were mixed from the beginning, and the major complaint people had was the heavy use of dialog to substitute action. While I would disagree with that assessment I have to say that was a lot of wordplay here, and if that is a problem then you probably should avoid the movie.

883652,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007N1JC8,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 8]","Software engineer-turned-film director Shane Carruth shows one brilliant idea in `Primer': What if you can go back to yesterday, or any time in the past, using a time machine? Usually in the films based on time-traveling idea such as `Back to the Future' series, the time travelers (who go back to the past) do not meet themselves while staying in the past (themselves before time-traveling), and in this way the filmmakers avoid the confusing storytelling process that must follow the consequences of, say, Marty A meeting Marty B. What would happen if Marty in `BTTF' Part 1 looks up, and finds himself Marty in `BTTF' Part 2 looking down at him? Is it possible? If possible, how can you show it on screen, inevitable results affecting the entire series?`Primer' does this brave thing. The low-budget is basically about two young engineers Aaron and Abe who invented a time machine in their small garage. Instead of selling the license of techniques to major company (which I would love to do in their place), Abe and Aaron decide to conceal their invention from the public, and use it to make money. The idea is simple: investment in stock market. Get the right information about the market today, travel back to yesterday, and buy the right ones in the market.But this method inevitably produces (sort of) TWO Aarons and TWO Abes at the same time. It produces `doubles' or `alternatives' of Aaron and Abe. Now here is a question. What if one of the `doubles' starts to act on his own? What if the double gets another `double' using the machine while the original is unaware of his move?The premise sounds incredible, but very intriguing. But for all its fantastic concept, Shane Carruth made one mistake in making the film, and that is the script. To follow what is going on, we need a detailed chart of Abe and Aaron written by someone who can explain all the moves of the two characters, including their `doubles.' One viewing of the film is not enough, perhaps merely allowing you understand the 30 per cent of the story, and that is what happened to me. Now I read the many comments on the net, and that finally became 70 per cent. You might say you have to see the film at least five times. Yes, you are right. But why not make it `three times' or less?`The Primer' uses frequently high-tech jargons, which are slightly off-putting, but that is not a big problem. The film's production designs are frankly amateurish, and the time machine looks like a small box made of brown cardboard, but I can happily ignore those things. But I certainly didn't like sitting as a totally bemused audience in the dark, trying to think, `Is this my fault or not?'I like the film's bleak outlook on the idea of time traveling, and its challenging attitudes to make us think. Shane Carruth has succeeded in doing the latter, I think, for many viewers, including me, still find the mind-bending puzzle very intriguing after watching it.

883655,A3OND36Q71G76D,B0007N1JC8,W. Scott Heitman,"[8, 10]","There exists a very small genre of movies...12 Monkeys, Memento, The Thing, Basic, Donnie Darko....that DEMAND repeated viewings.  These are movies that with one viewing, you have not enjoyed or understood the majority of the material.  Watching one of these movies is like uncovering a gold mine....you find that there is a wealth, a journey of information and thoughts that you have been invited to and have only just begun.Primer is one of these movies.  I have only seen it once, which nearly makes me unqualified to review it.  I cannot say how well it all fits together yet.  I will say that it makes Memento seem simple at times and promises to keep me thinking for months if not years.Here's the real kicker: 1) Primer was made on a budget of $7000!  2) Every scene was filmed in one take!  3) All of the actors are complete unknown amateurs!You would never guess that any of these three facts are true.  The acting is seamless, the cinematography is often noticeably (in an attention grabbing way) good, and while there aren't any special effects, nothing suggests that this is a low budget film.Like most of the movies I listed at the top, Primer is a movie best viewed without knowing ANYTHING about it.  It has a playful tone of discovery that will be blunted if you have too much knowledge of the plot.Some people have complained that the movie is largely emotionless.  For most of the movie, this is true.  However, the puzzle it creates is engrossing enough that I, for one, felt no lack of emotion.  In fact, the absence of swelling emotions made the film feel much more realistic at times, and I think that may have been the intent.If you like any of the films I mentioned above, don't miss this one.  This isn't the type of movie that mainstream audiences like, so it will never get the recognition it deserves.  I'll be ordering my copy of the movie very soon to support this new Director, Writer, Actor, Composer!",5,Destined for Cult Classic Status!,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,1933,"['very', 'small', 'genre', 'movies', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Memento', 'Thing', 'Basic', 'Donnie', 'Darko', '.that', 'DEMAND', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'movies', 'one', 'viewing', 'have', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'understood', 'majority', 'material', 'Watching', 'one', 'movies', 'uncovering', 'gold', 'mine', '.you', 'find', 'wealth', 'journey', 'information', 'thoughts', 'have', 'been', 'invited', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'begun.Primer', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'nearly', 'unqualified', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'well', 'together', 'yet', 'will', 'say', 'Memento', 'seem', 'simple', 'times', 'promises', 'keep', 'thinking', 'months', 'not', 'real', 'kicker', '1', 'Primer', 'was', 'made', 'budget', '7000', '2', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'one', 'take', '3', 'actors', 'are', 'complete', 'unknown', 'amateurs', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'three', 'facts', 'are', 'true', 'acting', 'seamless', 'cinematography', 'often', 'noticeably', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'way', 'good', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'effects', 'nothing', 'low', 'budget', 'film.Like', 'most', 'movies', 'listed', 'top', 'Primer', 'movie', 'best', 'viewed', 'knowing', 'ANYTHING', 'playful', 'tone', 'discovery', 'will', 'be', 'blunted', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'knowledge', 'plot.Some', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'largely', 'emotionless', 'most', 'movie', 'true', 'However', 'puzzle', 'engrossing', 'one', 'felt', 'lack', 'emotion', 'fact', 'absence', 'swelling', 'emotions', 'made', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'times', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intent.If', 'films', 'mentioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'recognition', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ordering', 'copy', 'movie', 'very', 'soon', 'support', 'new', 'Director', 'Writer', 'Actor', 'Composer']",Primer
