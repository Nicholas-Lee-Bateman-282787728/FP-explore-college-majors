883806,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,B0007NFLYK,Ghost(Ghost(M)),"[2, 2]","Like many on this page have mentioned, this is NOT a documentary of any sort. It's assorted bits and scraps from German-made (and French? Some of the nazified film is in French! Which kinda sounds weird) performance movies of 1930s and 1940s.Is it curious? Yes it is: you can see Goebblels make a short speech in the theatre before the performance, for example. Seeing the bloody [bad man] live, smiling, and quite pleasant-looking is an experience. Performances are all very good (as expected: I'm not sure why some people below are bemoaning the supposed disconnect between the beauty and the goodness... I don't know why it surprises some that there's no connection whatsoever. Yes Boehm and Karajan were enthusiastic nazis and incredible musicians at the same time, so get over it already and enjoy their music while staying away from their nazism... musicians are not intellectuals, after all: a lot of them are quite as dumb as they're talented).What else... well, there's German tanks in Paris in 1940. Not that it's anything new, but I was amazed to see what kind of junk Germans had for tanks at that time -- we're more used to having a mental picture of some sexy beasts like their Tiger, but they obviously didn't have them at the beginning of the war. Looking at this armor parade in Paris, one truly wonders why the French lost so quickly -- after all they had a huge army, and, you'd think, their own weird-looking but heavy and very well armed Char B's should have made mincemeat out of these German tin cans that drive through Paris on this video. They look even worse than the US tanks of the era.All this is rather curious, but again, the film is not a documentary of any sort: there's no unifying idea, no ""editorial"" content of any kind, no narration, nothing ""educational"" -- all you have is an assortment of old-footage fragments. Worth watching? Yes. Worth having? No; rent it, watch it once, and be done with it. Must see?

883807,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B0007NFLYK,Mr John Haueisen,"[3, 4]","Many of the other reviewers have been a bit harsh in claiming this is nothing but a collection of old documentary films.  Some claim that it is not a documentary at all.  It is actually an invaluable record that provides information on items of historical interest.  It offers us the opportunity to see:the enthusiastic and gesticulative conducting technique of the great Wilhelm Furtwaenglerthe quality of German video and sound recording at a time when such techniques were still in their infancy, or at least their childhoodThe Nazi government's belief that art and culture should be brought to the people--even in the workplaceAn example of this is the film of Goebbels in the AEG factory, watching Furtwaengler conduct, surrounded by an audience of recuperating combat soldiers and men and women factory workers, sitting on or alongside boilers and large engines to watch the concert.  Workers listen in thoughtful attention--or is it just that the Nazis put together the film to put across this image?  The crux is that they thought it good to show government bringing art to the masses.Of course there is the ubiquitous film of Hitler arriving at Bayreuth, greeted warmly by Winifred Wagner.  We might even notice that the pressing crowds of deliriously enthusiastic young people, dazzled by a Hitler promising reform, change, and hope, are not all that different from today's enthralled throngs hoping for a glimpse of a current charismatic leader.  That's another reason this is a valuable recording of pictures and sounds from the past.",4,An important historical mirror:  pictures and sounds from the past,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,1546,"['Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'harsh', 'claiming', 'nothing', 'collection', 'old', 'documentary', 'films', 'claim', 'not', 'documentary', 'actually', 'invaluable', 'record', 'information', 'items', 'historical', 'interest', 'opportunity', 'see', 'enthusiastic', 'gesticulative', 'conducting', 'technique', 'great', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwaenglerthe', 'quality', 'German', 'video', 'sound', 'recording', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'techniques', 'were', 'still', 'infancy', 'least', 'childhoodThe', 'Nazi', 'government', 'belief', 'art', 'culture', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'people', 'even', 'workplaceAn', 'example', 'film', 'Goebbels', 'AEG', 'factory', 'watching', 'Furtwaengler', 'conduct', 'surrounded', 'audience', 'recuperating', 'combat', 'soldiers', 'men', 'women', 'factory', 'workers', 'sitting', 'alongside', 'boilers', 'large', 'engines', 'watch', 'concert', 'Workers', 'listen', 'thoughtful', 'attention', 'just', 'Nazis', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'put', 'image', 'crux', 'thought', 'good', 'show', 'government', 'bringing', 'art', 'masses.Of', 'course', 'ubiquitous', 'film', 'Hitler', 'arriving', 'Bayreuth', 'greeted', 'warmly', 'Winifred', 'Wagner', 'might', 'even', 'notice', 'pressing', 'crowds', 'deliriously', 'enthusiastic', 'young', 'people', 'dazzled', 'Hitler', 'promising', 'reform', 'change', 'hope', 'are', 'not', 'different', 'today', 'enthralled', 'throngs', 'hoping', 'glimpse', 'current', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'reason', 'valuable', 'recording', 'pictures', 'sounds', 'past']",N/A
883808,AGDKDYTDL9SB9,B0007NFLYK,"Ralph J. Steinberg ""Lover of German Music""","[44, 51]","Although I have not seen this video as such, I am acquainted with its contents from other sources. I will confine myself to commenting on the notes of Spotts, specifically the most outrageous attack I have ever seen in print on Wilhelm Furtwaengler.I suppose controversy over the wisdom of Furtwaengler's decision to stay in Nazi Germany (encouraged by Jewish artists such as Arnold Schoenberg and Max Reinhardt) will always continue. But Spotts, like his predecessor Ira Hirschman, goes far beyond this, stating that Furtwaengler was an enthusiastic collaborator with Goebbels, profitted from the regime, and was virulently anti Semitic, objecting to the mistreatment of Jews only when it would harm Germany's image and cultural needs.The facts speak otherwise. If Furtwaengler was an enthusiastic collaborator, why did he resign from all his posts after protesting the ousting of Jewish musicians and the ban on Hindemith? Yehudi Menuhin pointed out that in resigning, Furtwaengler gave up all benefits and pensions, and indeed was penniless after the war. He never resumed his posts during the regime, only remaining with the Berlin Philharmonic as a free-lance conductor. Any concessions that he made, such as conducting at the ""Winterhilfe"" concerts (a series of charity events) were done to wring from Goebbels the assurance that the Berlin Philharmonic would continue to be subsidized and that THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE ARYANIZATION DECREE, ALLOWING THE JEWISH MUSICIANS TO CONTINUE AS BERLIN PHILHARMONIC MEMBERS. When the Jewish members finally did emigrate, Furtwaengler expressed his regret and continued to write to them. And of course, if Furtwaengler was such a loyal supporter of the Nazis, why did Himmler finally order the Gestapo to shadow the conductor, causing him to seek asylum in Switzerland to avoid assassination? Remember that Himmler wrote in Furtwaengler's dossier, ""There is no Jew, filthy as he may be, for whom Furtwaengler does not stretch out a helping hand.""When Furtwaengler wrote his letter to Goebbels defending Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer from dismissal, he stated that as an artist, his job was not to disrupt people, but to unite. He saw no difference between Jewish and non-Jewish art, only between good and bad art. In other words, the distinctions between religions and races meant nothing to him, only quality counted! Of course, he could not attack this from the standpoint of humanity, as this would hardly cause an anti Semitie like Goebbels to lend his ear to the plea.The case of Arnold Schoenberg is very telling here. Furtwaengler was reported to have only intervened for him so that he would not be made into a martyr by the Nazis. As this was reported by the Nazi-controlled press, the veracity of this statement is very much in doubt. Frau Schoenberg tells a much different story:  Furtwaengler visited them in Paris and offered to negotiate with the Nazis for the release of Schoenberg's assests. He expressed shame over what was being done to Schoenberg and asked them: ""What shall I do now?"" Schoenberg replied: ""You must stay and conduct good music!"" Max Reinhardt also urged him to remain.I met a cellist who had played under Furtwaengler in the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He of course was a Jewish German refugee. When this man was about to emigrate, he had a conversation with Furtwaengler about the political situation. According to him, Furtwaengler said that he could not abandon his orchestra, as he regarded them as his children. One might add that Furtwaengler also had fears that the Nazis would imprison his mother if he emigrated (remember that they did in fact confiscate his passport after his resignations). Interesting that he did finally emigrate after learning that his mother had died.Being Jewish AND German, I can appreciate the notion that there was another, truer Germany that existed along with the Nazis, and that men like Furtwaengler were needed to keep its values alive. (Only recently has a German Resistance been acknowledged).Had he not stayed and used his influence whenever he could, the Berlin Philharmonic might not exist today, and something like 108 people might not have survived the war. On a personal level, however, I now wish that he had left, for his own sake, and could have avoided the irresponsible vilifications that he still, posthumously, undergoes at the hands of people who won't look beneath the surface. But like Frau Schoenberg, I will hold Furtwaengler dear in my heart, no matter what slander is thrown in his way.One last comment, a quote from Wikepedia:Third Reich controversyFurtw&auml;ngler's relationship with -- and attitude towards -- Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was a matter of much controversy.On April 10, 1933, Furtw&auml;ngler wrote a public letter to Goebbels to denounce the new rulers' anti-Semitism:I feel that I am first and foremost an artist, and that I am therefore apolitical in the sense of party politics. Art and artists exist to create love, not hate; to unite, not to divide. Ultimately there is only one dividing line I recognize: that between good and bad art. However, while the dividing line between Jews and non-Jews is being drawn with a downright merciless theoretical precision, that other dividing line, the one which in the long run is so important for our music life, yes, the decisive dividing line between good and bad, seems to have far too little significance attributed to it. Musical activity today, already weakened by the World crisis, the radio, etc., cannot tolerate any more experiments. Music cannot be made contingent in the same way as other essentials such as potatoes and bread. If concerts offer nothing then people will not attend; that is why the QUALITY is not just an idea: it is of vital importance. If the fight against Judaism concentrates on those artists who are themselves rootless and destructive and who seek to succeed in kitsch, sterile virtuosity and the like, then it is quite acceptable; the fight against these people and the attitude they embody (as, unfortunately, do many non-Jews) cannot be pursued thoroughly or systematically enough. If, however, this campaign is also directed at truly great artists, then it ceases to be in the interests of Germany's cultural life [...] It must therefore be stated that men such as Walter, Klemperer, Reinhardt etc. must be allowed to exercise their talents in Germany in the future as well, in exactly the same way as Kreisler, Huberman, Schnabel and other great instrumentalists of the jewish race. It is only just that we Germans should bear in mind that in the past we had Joseph Joachim one of the greatest violinists and teachers in the German classical tradition, and in Mendelssohn even a great German composer - for Mendelssohn is a part of Germany's musical history"".[8]Furtw&auml;ngler received a flood of letters agreeing with him and thanking him, people hoping that Furtw&auml;ngler would disavow the politics of anti-Semitism in music.[9] The Nazis considered this letter as a very clear support for Jews. For instance, Winifred Wagner wrote: ""the claim that Dr. Furtw&auml;ngler has a favourable attitude towards Jews was proved once again by himself in his exchange of letter with Dr. Goebbels. For the last sixteen years or so he has had Fr&auml;ulein Dr. Geissmar - a full-blooded Jewess - as his full-time assistant, and my first serious disagreement with him during the 1931 festival [in Bayreuth] was provoked by our opposing views of the Jewish press.""[10] In another text of June 1933 that was the basis for a coming discussion with Goebbels, Furtw&auml;ngler starts saying : ""The Jewish question in musical spheres: a race a brilliant people!"" He writes that if the boycotts against Jews are extended to artistic activities, he will resign from all his posts immediately, concluding ""at any rate to continue giving concerts would be quite impossible without [the Jews] - to remove them would be an operation which would result in the death of the patient.""[11]During the period 1933-1934, Furtw&auml;ngler was constantly helping Jewish people so that Georg Gerullis, ministerial director at the Ministry of Culture sent a letter to Goebbels saying: ""Can you name me a Jew on whose behalf Furtw&auml;ngler has not intervened?""[12] Because of his international renown, he was appointed as the first vice-president of the Reichsmusikkammer and Staatsrat of Prussia. He accepted these honorific positions only in order to try to bend the racial policy of Nazis in music and to support Jewish musicians.[13] On 25, November 1934, he wrote a letter in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung to support Hindemith's art, a degenerate artist for the Nazis and conducted a piece of Hindemith's opera Mathis der Maler.[14] This unleashed a storm, the Nazis understood that all their opponents were behind Furtw&auml;ngler. He was then forced to resign from all his positions.[15] In 1936 it seemed possible that he might follow Erich Kleiber's footsteps into exile when he was offered the principal conductor's post at the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where he would have succeeded Arturo Toscanini. Toscanini's biographer Harvey Sachs wrote that Toscanini recommended Furtw&auml;ngler for the position, one of the few times Toscanini expressed admiration for a fellow conductor.[16] There is every possibility that Furtw&auml;ngler would have accepted the post,[17] but a report from the Berlin branch of the Associated Press, possibly ordered by Hermann G&ouml;ring, said that he was willing to take up his post at the Berlin Opera once more. This caused the mood in New York to turn against him; from their point of view, it seemed that Furtw&auml;ngler was now a full supporter of the Nazi Party.[18] In addition, Grove Online notes that he was ""personally unpopular"" with the orchestra's board, whom he had treated disrepectfully when he conducted the orchestra in 1925-27; influential boards were unknown in German orchestras at the time.However, Furtw&auml;ngler never joined the Nazi Party nor did he approve of them,[19] much like the composer Richard Strauss, who made no secret of his dislike of the Nazis. Furtw&auml;ngler always refused to give the Nazi salute, to conduct the Horst-Wessel-Lied and to sign his letters with ""Heil Hitler"" even in those he sent to Hitler.[1]   [17]   [20] Berta Geissmar who was Furtw&auml;ngler's secretary during the period 1915-1935 was a Jewess. She says on the book she wrote on Furtw&auml;ngler in England in 1943:Furtw&auml;ngler, although he had decided to remain in Germany, was certainly no Nazi [...] He had a private telephone line to me which was not connected via the exchange [...] Before going to bed, he used to chat with me over telephone. Sometimes I told him amusing stories to cheer him up, sometimes we talked about politics. One of the main threats the Nazis used against Furtw&auml;ngler and myself later on was the assertion that they had recorded all these conversations. I should not have thought that it was possible ! Was there enough shellac ? If the Nazis really did this, their ears must certainly have burnt, and it was not surprising that Furtw&auml;ngler was put eventually put on their black list, let alone myself.[21]Furtw&auml;ngler was treated relatively well by the Nazis; he had a high profile, and was an important cultural figure, as evidenced by his inclusion in the Gottbegnadeten list (""God-gifted List"") of September 1944 (however, his name was removed from the list on December 7, 1944 because of his relationships with German resistance[22]). During the war, he tried to avoid conducting in occupied Europe as much as possible. In particular, he categorically refused to go to France during the occupation of this country, although the Nazis tried to force him to conduct there.[23]  [24]  [25] However, he conducted in Prague in 1940 and again in March 1944 in a concert marking the fifth anniversary of the German occupation[26] where he played Slavonic music (M&aacute; vlast (My Country) of Bedich Smetana in 1940 and the Symphony No. 9 of Anton&iacute;n Dvo&aacute;k in 1944) and in Oslo in 1943 where he helped the Jewish conductor Issay Dobrowen to flee to Sweden.[27] His concerts were often broadcast to German troops to raise morale, though he was limited in what he was allowed to perform by the authorities. He later said he tried to protect German culture from the Nazis;[28] it is now known that he used his influence to help Jewish musicians and non-musicians escape the Third Reich.[17]   [29]  [30] He managed, for example, to have Max Zweig, a nephew of conductor Fritz Zweig, released from Dachau concentration camp. Others, from an extensive list of Jews he helped, included Carl Flesch, Josef Krips and the composer Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg.[31] Goebbels wrote in two entries of his diary in 1937 that Furtw&auml;ngler was constantly helping Jews, ""half-Jews"" and ""his small Hindemith"".[32]In April 1944, Goebbels wrote:Furtw&auml;ngler has never been a National Socialist. Nor has he ever made any bones about it. Which Jews and emigrants thought was sufficient to consider him as one of them, a key representative of so-called 'inner emigration'. Furtw&auml;ngler['s] stance towards us has not changed in the least.[33]  [34]  [35]  [36]Albert Speer claimed that in December 1944 Furtw&auml;ngler asked whether Germany had any chance of winning the war. Speer replied in the negative, and advised the conductor to flee to Switzerland from possible Nazi retribution.[37] Indeed, Furtw&auml;ngler had strong links to German resistance that organized the 20 July plot against Hitler. As Furtw&auml;ngler explicitly said during his denazification trial, he knew that an attack was organized against Hitler, although he did not participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well[38] and his Doctor, Dr. Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to avoid official manifestations, was a member of the Kreisau Circle.[39] Grove Online states that he was ""within a few hours of being arrested "" by the Gestapo when he escaped to Switzerland shortly after a concert in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic on January 28, 1945 (the Nazis had begun to crack down on German liberals at this time). At that concert he conducted an account of Brahms's Second Symphony that was caught on tape and is considered one of his greatest recordings.[40]At his denazification trial, Furtw&auml;ngler was charged with two official concerts for the period 1933-1945. The first concert was for the Hitler Youth on 3 February 1938. It was part of a long series of concerts presented to Furtw&auml;ngler as a way to acquaint the rising generation with classical music. According to Fred Prieberg: ""when he looked at the audience he realized that this was more than just a concert for school kids in uniform; a whole collection of prominent political figures were sitting there as well [...] and it was the last time he raised his baton for this purpose"".[41] The second concert was a performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg with the Vienna Philharmonic on 5 September 1938, on the evening before the Nazi congress in N&uuml;remberg.[42] Furtw&auml;ngler agreed to conduct this concert to preserve the Viennese orchestra (the Nazis wanted to eliminate the orchestra) but required that the concert was not part of the nazi congress and this is why the political event only formally opened the following morning.[42] He was charged also with his honorific title of Staatsrat of Prussia (he had resigned from this title in 1934, but the Nazis had refused his resignation) and with making an anti-semitic remark against the part-Jewish conductor Victor de Sabata.[43]  [44] The judge started the trial with the following sentences:""The investigations showed that Furtw&auml;ngler had not been a member of any [Nazi] organization, that he tried to help people persecuted because of their race, and that he also avoided ... formalities such as giving the Hitler salute.""[43]At the end of the trial, musicians certified that Furtw&auml;ngler helped many people during Nazi era such as Hugo Strelitzer who declared:If I am alive today, I owe this to this great man. Furtw&auml;ngler helped and protected a great number of Jewish musicians and this attitude shows a great deal of courage since he did it under the eyes of the Nazis, in Germany itself. History will be his judge.[45]As part of his closing remarks at his denazification trial, Furtw&auml;ngler said,I knew Germany was in a terrible crisis; I felt responsible for German music, and it was my task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like. Does Thomas Mann [who was critical of Furtw&auml;ngler's actions] really believe that in 'the Germany of Himmler' one should not be permitted to play Beethoven? Could he not realize that people never needed more, never yearned more to hear Beethoven and his message of freedom and human love, than precisely these Germans, who had to live under Himmler's terror? I do not regret having stayed with them.[46]He was eventually cleared on all the counts.[43]The violinist Yehudi Menuhin was, with Arnold Schoenberg and Nathan Milstein, among the musicians in the Jewish community who had a positive view of Furtw&auml;ngler. In 1933 he had refused to play with him, but in the late 1940s after a personal investigation of Furtw&auml;ngler, he became supportive of him, and performed and recorded alongside him.[47]Yehudi Menuhin had sent a wire to General Robert A. McClure in February 1946 that has remained very famous:Unless you have secret incriminating evidence against Furtw&auml;ngler supporting your accusation that he was a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture. As for quote 'lending an aura of respectability to the Party', are we the Allies not infinitely more guilty and of our own free will by recognising and pactizing with these monsters when almost despite ourselves we were literally dragged and unchivalrously knocked into this struggle, except of course for Great Britain which declared war before being directly attacked. Remember Munich and Berchtesgaden and all the years when we all wantonly abandoned to their cruel fate every brave and hopeful heart, every valiant and defiant nation. I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtw&auml;ngler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin. If this diseased nation should ever grow up to become a self-respecting member of the community of nations, it will be due to the efforts of men like Furtw&auml;ngler who have proven that they are able to rescue from the war at least part of their soul. Witness the Berlin Philharmonic. These men alone are able to build on this unsullied base a better society. It is not by stifling such men that you will achieve your aim. Quite the contrary you will only stir up a justifiable resentment against a vandalism as real as the more obvious variety which carves up churches and paintings [...][48]",1,A Gratuitous Slander of Furtwaengler!

Yet this beauty did not produce truth nor did it generate goodness.That the Nazis treasured Beethoven and used the Ninth Symphony, with its history of celebrating freedom of the spirit, as one of their signature pieces, created such anguish in me that it was hard to watch and listen.  And to see one of the most gifted and imaginative conductors of all time, Wilhelm Furtwangler, shaking hands with Josef Goebbels at a concert in honor of Hitler's birthday, made me want to cry.Yet it is important that music lovers watch this DVD.  It is of the greatest importance that we never confuse beauty with truth, or beauty with goodness, or talent with morality, or intelligence with wisdom.  These performances, especially the Beethoven, show that beauty can be used in the service of evil, talent can be hijacked by the most vile murderers, intelligence and culture perverted by the wicked.All my life I have had a problem with Wagner.  He was the single most horrible person to produce sublime beauty whom I know.  What does one do with this?One friend of mine refused to buy Karajan recordings until after he died.  I spent decades immersed in opera before I was willing to see my first performance of The Ring (which actually swept me away, to my great ambivalent dismay).Some of these conductors were active and enthusiastic participants in the Nazi regime.  Others convinced themselves that they were serving ""art"" and not the regime, but saw themselves contributing to the propaganda of the Nazis nevertheless.The question of the relationship between beauty and goodness is hard to resolve.  I guess I'm going to have to struggle with it for the rest of my life.  Perhaps others will start a thread on this that will shed some light on the perplexing problem this DVD generates.",5,Breaks my heart; beauty does not equal truth or goodness.,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,2047,"[""'Beauty"", 'truth', 'truth', 'beauty', 'allYe', 'know', 'earth', 'ye', 'need', 'know', 'DVD', 'will', 'prove', 'Keats', 'was', 'mistaken.Some', 'selections', 'DVD', 'are', 'most', 'beautiful', 'exciting', 'performances', 'greatest', 'music', 'ever', 'written', 'beauty', 'did', 'not', 'produce', 'truth', 'did', 'generate', 'goodness.That', 'Nazis', 'treasured', 'Beethoven', 'used', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'history', 'celebrating', 'freedom', 'spirit', 'one', 'signature', 'pieces', 'created', 'such', 'anguish', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'listen', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'imaginative', 'conductors', 'time', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtwangler', 'shaking', 'hands', 'Josef', 'Goebbels', 'concert', 'honor', 'Hitler', 'birthday', 'made', 'want', 'cry.Yet', 'important', 'music', 'lovers', 'watch', 'DVD', 'greatest', 'importance', 'never', 'confuse', 'beauty', 'truth', 'beauty', 'goodness', 'talent', 'morality', 'intelligence', 'wisdom', 'performances', 'especially', 'Beethoven', 'show', 'beauty', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'service', 'evil', 'talent', 'can', 'be', 'hijacked', 'most', 'vile', 'murderers', 'intelligence', 'culture', 'perverted', 'wicked.All', 'life', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'Wagner', 'was', 'single', 'most', 'horrible', 'person', 'produce', 'sublime', 'beauty', 'whom', 'know', 'What', 'one', 'do', 'One', 'friend', 'mine', 'refused', 'buy', 'Karajan', 'recordings', 'died', 'spent', 'decades', 'immersed', 'opera', 'was', 'willing', 'see', 'first', 'performance', 'Ring', 'actually', 'swept', 'away', 'great', 'ambivalent', 'dismay', '.Some', 'conductors', 'were', 'active', 'enthusiastic', 'participants', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'Others', 'convinced', 'were', 'serving', 'art', 'not', 'regime', 'saw', 'contributing', 'propaganda', 'Nazis', 'nevertheless.The', 'question', 'relationship', 'beauty', 'goodness', 'hard', 'resolve', 'guess', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'struggle', 'rest', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'others', 'will', 'start', 'thread', 'will', 'shed', 'light', 'perplexing', 'problem', 'DVD']",N/A

I, too, had been expecting a documentary about conductors in the Third Reich and some explanation of background with arguments against or maybe even in favor of them and their decisions to work under the Nazis. There is none of that.What we do have are clips, as follows:- Max von Schillings conducting the Berlin Staatsoper Orchestra in the William Tell overture, 1932-33- Leo Blech conducting the Berlin Staatsoper Orchestra in the the Meistersinger Prelude, 1933- A short speech by Joseph Goebbels opening up the renovated German Opera House Berlin in 1935, prior to...- ... Karl B&ouml;hm conducting the Meistersinger Prelude and finale to Act III- Brief Nazi newsreel clip about the Salzburg Festival- Another brief newsreel clip of German tanks in Paris and the arrival of the Berlin Opera with ""Madame Wagner"" in tow to watch a Berlin Philharmonic concert conducted by Karajan -- again with the Meistersinger prelude! But the footage has just excerpts, not the entire prelude.- Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler conducting -- guess which piece? That's right! The Meistersinger Prelude, at the AEG factory in 1942.- Furtwangler conducting the BPO in Beethoven's Ninth, fourth movement, choral section. This is the famous ""Hitler's birthday"" performance with the big swastikas on the walls, followed by the Goebbels handshake and Furtw&auml;ngler's subsequent wiping off his hand with a handkerchief.- Hans Knappersbuch again conducting the BPO in the choral section of Beethoven's Ninth, fourth movement, in 1942-43.- Brief clip of Clemens Krauss conducting the BPO in Schubert's Unfinished Symphony in France in 1943- Winifred Wagner in 1940 greeting Hitler at Bayreuth. The F&uuml;hrer waves to the audience from a balcony in a tuxedo, which might be the single most interesting image on the whole DVD. Clips of the finale of -- you guessed it -- the Meistersinger.There is no value added in terms of commentary or documentarian insight. And worst of all, right now all these old historical clips are up on YouTube, which means there is even less incentive to buy this DVD.If you are looking for insight into classical music under the Nazis, I can highly recommendThe Reichsorchester: The Berlin Philharmonic, which deals specifically with the BPO under Furtw&auml;ngler, as told by the surviving members of the orchestra from that period. I also likeTaking Sides, a fictionalized account of Furtw&auml;ngler's denazification proceedings after the war. While it is not historically accurate, it does a good job of framing the moral issues and questions of the responsibilities of artists serving vicious dictatorships.I suppose you might want to get this DVD if for some strange reason you just can't get enough of Nazi performances of the Meistersinger Prelude. Can't think of any other real reason to get it. Worth watching once, perhaps.",2,"No documentary, just old footage -- mostly of Meistersinger",1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,2914,"['have', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'regarding', 'value', 'film', 'too', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'documentary', 'conductors', 'Third', 'Reich', 'explanation', 'background', 'arguments', 'maybe', 'even', 'favor', 'decisions', 'work', 'Nazis', 'none', 'that.What', 'do', 'have', 'are', 'clips', 'Max', 'von', 'Schillings', 'conducting', 'Berlin', 'Staatsoper', 'Orchestra', 'William', 'Tell', 'overture', '1932-33-', 'Leo', 'Blech', 'conducting', 'Berlin', 'Staatsoper', 'Orchestra', 'Meistersinger', 'Prelude', '1933-', 'A', 'short', 'speech', 'Joseph', 'Goebbels', 'opening', 'up', 'renovated', 'German', 'Opera', 'House', 'Berlin', '1935', 'prior', 'Karl', 'B', 'ouml', 'conducting', 'Meistersinger', 'Prelude', 'finale', 'Act', 'III-', 'Brief', 'Nazi', 'newsreel', 'clip', 'Salzburg', 'Festival-', 'brief', 'newsreel', 'clip', 'German', 'tanks', 'Paris', 'arrival', 'Berlin', 'Opera', 'Madame', 'Wagner', 'tow', 'watch', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'concert', 'conducted', 'Karajan', 'again', 'Meistersinger', 'prelude', 'footage', 'just', 'excerpts', 'not', 'entire', 'prelude.-', 'Wilhelm', 'Furtw', 'auml', 'conducting', 'guess', 'piece', 'right', 'Meistersinger', 'Prelude', 'AEG', 'factory', '1942.-', 'Furtwangler', 'conducting', 'BPO', 'Beethoven', 'Ninth', 'fourth', 'movement', 'choral', 'section', 'famous', 'Hitler', 'birthday', 'performance', 'big', 'swastikas', 'walls', 'followed', 'Goebbels', 'handshake', 'Furtw', 'auml', 'subsequent', 'wiping', 'off', 'hand', 'handkerchief.-', 'Hans', 'Knappersbuch', 'again', 'conducting', 'BPO', 'choral', 'section', 'Beethoven', 'Ninth', 'fourth', 'movement', '1942-43.-', 'Brief', 'clip', 'Clemens', 'Krauss', 'conducting', 'BPO', 'Schubert', 'Unfinished', 'Symphony', 'France', '1943-', 'Winifred', 'Wagner', '1940', 'greeting', 'Hitler', 'Bayreuth', 'F', 'uuml', 'hrer', 'audience', 'balcony', 'tuxedo', 'might', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'interesting', 'image', 'whole', 'DVD', 'Clips', 'finale', 'guessed', 'Meistersinger.There', 'value', 'added', 'terms', 'commentary', 'documentarian', 'insight', 'worst', 'right', 'now', 'old', 'historical', 'clips', 'are', 'up', 'YouTube', 'even', 'less', 'incentive', 'buy', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'looking', 'insight', 'classical', 'music', 'Nazis', 'can', 'highly', 'recommendThe', 'Reichsorchester', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'specifically', 'BPO', 'Furtw', 'auml', 'told', 'surviving', 'members', 'orchestra', 'period', 'also', 'likeTaking', 'Sides', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Furtw', 'auml', 'denazification', 'proceedings', 'war', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'good', 'job', 'framing', 'moral', 'issues', 'questions', 'responsibilities', 'artists', 'serving', 'vicious', 'dictatorships.I', 'suppose', 'might', 'want', 'get', 'DVD', 'strange', 'reason', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Nazi', 'performances', 'Meistersinger', 'Prelude', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'real', 'reason', 'get', 'Worth', 'watching', 'once', 'perhaps']",N/A
