I mean, who doesn't like a murder mystery, especially the idea of it being at sea, characters disappearing one by one and the audience wondering who it will be? It was enough to make me want to go rent this movie.However, the problems with this movie come from a plethora of areas. First of all, the acting is pretty atrocious. The characters seem a little wooden, seemingly just going through the motions of the script, and, because of this, many of the scenes kind of just die (no pun intended). Another perplexing element is the preposterousness of having a killer aboard a tiny boat, and no one seemingly being able to see or figure out who it is. Are we to believe that no one can hear the victim's screams as they are being attacked? Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is the over abundance of plot twists (as one reviewer mentioned), and the attempt to explain them all away in the film's final twenty to thirty minutes. This really is a disservice to anyone who actually tried to follow the film. The dark and murky camera scenes make it hard to figure out what is going on much of the movie. Finally, what's with the odd choice of background music during the film? This completely kills any sense of suspense this movie is supposed to have.This is an average movie at best. At worst, it isn't very good.",2,Sea Something Else,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1363,"['premise', 'movie', 'interesting', 'mean', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'murder', 'mystery', 'especially', 'idea', 'being', 'sea', 'characters', 'disappearing', 'one', 'one', 'audience', 'wondering', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'rent', 'movie.However', 'problems', 'movie', 'come', 'plethora', 'areas', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'pretty', 'atrocious', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'wooden', 'seemingly', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'script', 'many', 'scenes', 'kind', 'just', 'die', 'pun', 'intended', 'perplexing', 'element', 'preposterousness', 'having', 'killer', 'tiny', 'boat', 'one', 'seemingly', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'Are', 'believe', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'victim', 'screams', 'are', 'being', 'attacked', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'film', 'over', 'abundance', 'plot', 'twists', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'attempt', 'explain', 'away', 'film', 'final', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'really', 'disservice', 'anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'tried', 'follow', 'film', 'dark', 'murky', 'camera', 'scenes', 'make', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'much', 'movie', 'Finally', 'what', 'odd', 'choice', 'background', 'music', 'film', 'completely', 'sense', 'suspense', 'movie', 'supposed', 'have.This', 'average', 'movie', 'best', 'worst', ""n't"", 'very', 'good']",Sea Of Fear

997064,A3H2P1QBOZLHOO,B000FWHW7M,Mreal,"[2, 2]","Sea of Fear is one of those movies that leaves you amazed at how something so bad could have been written, funded and actually filmed. The guy who made this must have a loose grip on reality because his movie is at its' very best bad comedy. As an example (there are so many), and this is my absolute favorite scene, the girl in the end is laying on top of her boyfriend on the ship's deck kissing him when she reaches for a life preserver... she places it over his mouth and instead of him easily tossing her aside with one of his totally free arms, he flails about like he's actually somehow trapped by her tiny limbs and dies after like 4 seconds. The silliness of the scene is not lost on the actor and actress because they're practically laughing while doing it. If I had just turned this on I would have guessed it was from an SNL skit.Bottom line- If you're the type of person who can get a good laugh from a preposterious movie than Sea of Fear is for you, for everyone else don't waste your time!",1,How did this get made?,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1005,"['Sea', 'Fear', 'one', 'movies', 'amazed', 'how', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'funded', 'actually', 'filmed', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'must', 'have', 'loose', 'grip', 'reality', 'movie', 'very', 'best', 'bad', 'comedy', 'example', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'scene', 'girl', 'end', 'laying', 'top', 'boyfriend', 'ship', 'deck', 'kissing', 'when', 'life', 'preserver', 'mouth', 'instead', 'easily', 'tossing', 'aside', 'one', 'totally', 'free', 'arms', 'actually', 'somehow', 'trapped', 'tiny', 'limbs', 'dies', '4', 'seconds', 'silliness', 'scene', 'not', 'lost', 'actor', 'actress', ""'re"", 'practically', 'laughing', 'doing', 'had', 'just', 'turned', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'was', 'SNL', 'skit.Bottom', 'line-', ""'re"", 'type', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'preposterious', 'movie', 'Sea', 'Fear', 'everyone', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",Sea Of Fear
