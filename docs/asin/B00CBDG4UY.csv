The scenes in the movie are also horrible. At the beginning of the movie, I felt like there were only 6 guys running around in the entire trench, and the camera man was running behind one guy with constantly one angle shot that made it even looked worse and ridiculous. The explosions, the gun shots in the battle were supposed to make the viewers ""feel"" it...but not in this movie. it's just BORING! The uniforms look like brand new... Also, the sound is also horrible.I bought this movie for $5 and I don't think it's even worth $2... it was so bad that I could not finish the movie although I tried.",1,"Low budget, horribly directed, horrible reenactors = bad movie",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,697,"['movie', 'just', 'BAD', 'actors', 'are', 'believe', 'reenactors', 'who', 'obviously', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'horrible', 'beginning', 'movie', 'felt', 'were', 'only', '6', 'guys', 'running', 'around', 'entire', 'trench', 'camera', 'man', 'was', 'running', 'one', 'guy', 'constantly', 'one', 'angle', 'shot', 'made', 'even', 'looked', 'worse', 'ridiculous', 'explosions', 'gun', 'shots', 'battle', 'were', 'supposed', 'make', 'viewers', 'feel', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'BORING', 'uniforms', 'look', 'brand', 'new', 'Also', 'sound', 'also', 'horrible.I', 'bought', 'movie', '5', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'worth', '2', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'could', 'not', 'finish', 'movie', 'tried']",21 Brothers

1645348,A2OMPN58KBTD2I,B00CBDG4UY,Ironmike,"[23, 24]","Now I was not expecting an epic with thousands of extras and big name actors, but this Canadian effort was poorly done as it seemed like it was a bunch of over-weight reenactors festooned in all their expensive but authentic web gear (kits, excuse me) and .303 Enfields stumbling about in trenches that were far too shallow and not enough sandbags. It was well done as far as the gear and uniforms, don't get me wrong, but the attempt to portray the filthy conditions, the vermin (not one rat was in the cast) was nowhere to be seen. No duckboards, the sandbags weren't stacked well and it seemed like all the guys were too tall for the trench. I understand the limitations of budgets and such, but everybody was far too clean and orderly. Ever go camping for a few days? Dirt just seems to follow you and clings to you but in this film the cast were too neat and clean and few whiskers were visible. I did like the two ceramic rum jars in the beginning. I know the film was supposed to focus on the hazards and daily frustrations faced by the troops but this fell short.And besides that, my new DVD froze near the end. Nadda. Not sure how it ended but it could have been so much better for an independent and low-budget film.",2,A feeble attempt at showing the true horror of war,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1226,"['Now', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'epic', 'thousands', 'extras', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Canadian', 'effort', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'seemed', 'was', 'bunch', 'over-weight', 'reenactors', 'festooned', 'expensive', 'authentic', 'web', 'gear', 'kits', '.303', 'Enfields', 'stumbling', 'about', 'trenches', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'shallow', 'not', 'enough', 'sandbags', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'far', 'gear', 'uniforms', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'attempt', 'portray', 'filthy', 'conditions', 'vermin', 'not', 'one', 'rat', 'was', 'cast', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'duckboards', 'sandbags', 'were', ""n't"", 'stacked', 'well', 'seemed', 'guys', 'were', 'too', 'tall', 'trench', 'understand', 'limitations', 'budgets', 'such', 'everybody', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'clean', 'orderly', 'Ever', 'go', 'camping', 'few', 'days', 'Dirt', 'just', 'follow', 'clings', 'film', 'cast', 'were', 'too', 'neat', 'clean', 'few', 'whiskers', 'were', 'visible', 'did', 'two', 'ceramic', 'rum', 'jars', 'beginning', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'focus', 'hazards', 'daily', 'frustrations', 'faced', 'troops', 'fell', 'short.And', 'new', 'DVD', 'froze', 'end', 'Nadda', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'ended', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'independent', 'low-budget', 'film']",21 Brothers

I own hundreds & hundreds of war/history DVDs and couldn't get thru this movie it had so little to hold my attention; no action, no characters to get to know, no interesting dialogue (the film has no subtitles by the way which doesn't help) and the ending is just ridiculous. Its not like war movies can't be well done on a small budget. Also listed along with this film is &#34;Juno&#34;  about Canadian troops during WWII on D-Day. &#34;Juno&#34; is very well done and a WAY better film than this drek.
