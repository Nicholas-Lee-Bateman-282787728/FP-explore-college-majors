1616718,AYWDYNQRLHV3Q,B00ATK01W8,J. Carroll,"[5, 6]","Based on all the stellar reviews I really got my hopes up for this one, but I can't blame anyone. Everyone's opinions are different and with a steller cast like Leon, Crawford, and Robin Givens I knew I couldn't go wrong...but I was wrong! This might as well had been a play, as a matter of fact a play might have been better. All the scenes take place in one freakin room. The characters walk in and out this room depending on who's turn it is to get their shine and the storyline was just a total drag! My brother sat down to watch it with me because we've seen Crawford do stand up and we love the guy! Even had him as our screensaver for our home computer at one point. And we're familiar with Robin and Leon from better roles they've played in. We were really excited to watch this thinking we were going to get major laughs but the only thing we laughed about was the fact that someone actually had the nerve to write this terrible script and put out there as a movie! After 40 minutes of waiting for a turnaround in the storyline or just anything interesting to happen my brother just got up and left and I shut it off and threw another movie in. Not sure I'll even bother to finish watching it, where I left off the one girl shot her ex's girlfriend in the arm. Even that wasn't funny...Geesh. I don't blame the actors and actresses for this mess. We've seen them do way better, even the guy who plays Cole off Martin. I can't even say the storyline was horrible. Just needs better writing and more locations, changes of clothes, punchlines, stuff that makes real films interesting. Without these elements this ""movie"" was a bust!",2,I had high hopes for this one,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1638,"['Based', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'really', 'got', 'hopes', 'up', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'anyone', 'Everyone', 'opinions', 'are', 'different', 'steller', 'cast', 'Leon', 'Crawford', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'was', 'wrong', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'play', 'matter', 'fact', 'play', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'freakin', 'room', 'characters', 'walk', 'room', 'depending', 'who', 'turn', 'get', 'shine', 'storyline', 'was', 'just', 'total', 'drag', 'brother', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Crawford', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'love', 'guy', 'Even', 'had', 'screensaver', 'home', 'computer', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Robin', 'Leon', 'better', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'played', 'were', 'really', 'excited', 'watch', 'thinking', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'major', 'laughs', 'only', 'thing', 'laughed', 'about', 'was', 'fact', 'someone', 'actually', 'had', 'nerve', 'write', 'terrible', 'script', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'movie', '40', 'minutes', 'waiting', 'turnaround', 'storyline', 'just', 'anything', 'interesting', 'happen', 'brother', 'just', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'shut', 'off', 'threw', 'movie', 'Not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'even', 'bother', 'finish', 'watching', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'one', 'girl', 'shot', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'arm', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Geesh', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'actresses', 'mess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'way', 'better', 'even', 'guy', 'who', 'Cole', 'off', 'Martin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'storyline', 'was', 'horrible', 'Just', 'better', 'writing', 'more', 'locations', 'changes', 'clothes', 'punchlines', 'stuff', 'real', 'films', 'interesting', 'elements', 'movie', 'was', 'bust']",Je'caryous Johnson's Marriage Material
