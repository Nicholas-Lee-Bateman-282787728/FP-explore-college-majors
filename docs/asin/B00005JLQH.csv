603379,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLQH,,"[3, 3]","For me, it is hard to review this film.  There is a lot about it that touches me deeply and actually brings me to a place that is hard for me to accept.  That said, the film is one of the most complete films I've ever seen, maybe THE most complete.  What I mean by that is that the film has every element down to a science, from the sets to the score to the cinematography to the acting to the dialog; everything perfectly fitting within the stylistic vision direction Todd Haynes creates here.  When I say stylized I should probably clear up what I mean.  This is far from a visually overwhelming spectacle in the vein of Hollywood epics but is stylized in that it is a visually stunning recreation of a time and place.It is authentic in every sense of the word.In Haynes' telling of the tragic tale of the Whitaker family, the 50's are brought to roaring life, albeit a quiet roar.  With subtle textures that provoke powerful emotions, Haynes strings his actors, and the audience, along through each thoughtfully constructed frame.Cathy and Frank Whitaker have a seemingly perfect life.  Frank is a hardworking businessman who provides for his family better than most.  He is likable and respected and loving.  Cathy takes care of her children impeccably, making sure that she never neglects her home or her husband; and talk about hospitable.  What seems so lovely on the surface is about to come to a crashing halt when Frank's secret life (involving men) is uncovered and Cathy is presented with a troubling choice.  As she struggles to accept (and change) her husband she strikes up a friendship with Raymond, an African American gardener who comforts her and makes her feel a warmth her husband has stolen from her.  The community is less than enthused about Cathy's choices, even her best friend and confidant Eleanor refuses to understand what Cathy is going through.Haynes brilliantly captures a society that doesn't quite know how to accept what it cannot bring itself to understand.The film is propelled forward by some brilliant performances, especially from Quaid and Moore.Julianne Moore is often toted as the rightful owner of the 2002 Lead Actress Oscar.  She lost that night to Nicole Kidman in a performance that was mere gimmick as far as I'm concerned (and I really love Kidman, but not in that film).  For me, 2002 is all about Diane Lane, but Julianne Moore is absolutely stunning as Cathy, a true revelation.  Her style of acting lends itself perfectly to this type of film.  I have always said that Moore is a very mannered actress.  She can appear very theatrical which can lead her performances to feel stiff and unnatural.  In this type of a film, those unnatural mannerisms bleed such truth into her character's emotional struggling.  She appears desperate to contain herself, prim and proper like she is expected to be, yet her fragility is seen as her body shakes with every word.  She is mesmerizing as she attempts to make her voice heard without overstepping her boundaries; conveying a sense of self entitlement even when it is expected that she have none.For me though, this film is all about Dennis Quaid.  His riveting portrayal of a man condemned by his own emotions is just stunning to watch.  Some have complained that he never really allows us to see why he was such a well loved man to begin with, but the film really uses his character to point out the major flaws in society at that time.  Nice or not, Frank was a caretaker, a provider and a handsome man.  He had wealth, charm and intellect.  He was a prime catch, and so he was regarded as well liked despite his apparent flaws.  He is perceived as one thing even though his very presence contradicts it.  It should also be stated that the film opens at the beginning of an unraveling so-to-speak, with Frank's secret on the verge of exposure and his emotional rollercoaster reaching it's pitfall point.  Quaid is just extremely captivating, moving and so invested in this performance that one nearly quivers as he delivers his heartbroken lines.His final decision is gut wrenching for so many reasons.The supporting cast (Quaid is supporting as well, since this is Cathy's story through and through) is miraculous, especially Patricia Clarkson, who embodies the term `supporting actress' beautifully.  She has only a few scenes, but she captures a woman with a deeper sense of structure than the film lets on.  There is a story behind her shattering words, even if that story is never fully explored (how dare Cathy find an out in her marriage when women like Eleanor are stuck eternally in there's).  Dennis Haysbert is also very well used here, his earthy demeanor really embellishing his character's draw factor.  You can't help but cozy up to him, just as Cathy does.The film is a beautifully rendered social commentary on the controversies that surrounded a time period and that still bleed into our way of thinking today.  By tackling themes such as infidelity, homosexuality and racism with such strength and apparent fearlessness, Todd Haynes created a masterpiece of modern cinema that bares a soul as old as its protagonist.",5,Heavenly...,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,5133,"['hard', 'review', 'film', 'lot', 'deeply', 'actually', 'place', 'hard', 'accept', 'said', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'films',

This movie just had too much hype and that's the only reason that I saw it.Unlike Douglas Sirk this movie just didn't do it for me.The premise is basically this: A 1950s couple seem to have it all together. He's the husband that brings home the bacon and climbing the corporate ladder. She's the perfect wife & mother, they come complete with two young kids. Unfortunately not everything is at seems to be on the surface.Pretty soon the wife finds out of his affair with another man, she stars being friends with her African-American gardner, Raymond, and finds herself falling in love with him.When their seen together in town, vicious rumors soon circulate about them in their small town and mostly Caucasian community. What will this 50s housewife do?It has physical adultery, emotional adultery, homosexuality (yes I respect homosexuals but I just wasn't comfortable seeing them kiss and he was cheating on his wife with another man..come on!), the husband hits his wife but always apologizes later on.Its a movie to discuss homosexuality, racial tension & interracial dating, prejudice, adultery, etc.. that's all. I didn't think much of the movie except that it was artistic. It was well acted, the costumes & cinematography were beautiful.They were wonderful..but that's all this movie is: artistic & critic eye candy.I didn't mind that they were from different ethnicities and the movie was realistic when it ended them not having to be together.

603381,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B00005JLQH,Adrien Caldwell,"[5, 5]","I just finished watching this movie and wanted to leave a review. A friend bought this movie and so I watched it Saturday July 24th, 2010. I skimmed through the people who left only one star for this movie. I will give my analysis of the movie and acknowledge some of the harsh critiques regarding this movie.Some reviewers were calling this movie a bad clich&eacute;. Having lived in New England myself for a short time during the 90's I completely understand the entire stratification of social class as this movie captured in detail. For those of you who are from other parts of the country and do not know what it is like to deal with people in ""high society"" you may think that this movie blew it out of proportion. But actually it was quite diluted from real life. From my experience and from the people I know who are from that area it was right on the money. And the curiously disturbing thing for me is how I can identify with what I saw in this movie with my own personal experience having lived in New England for a brief time during the 1990's. I am a Chicagoan; born and bred. I am wondering if many people from other parts of the country cannot relate simply because they do not know people from Hartford, Connecticut or New England.Now, on with the movie review. I was seduced by everything. Wow! The cinematography, the wardrobes, the furniture and design sets, the New England colloquialisms and of course the acting. I am a big fan if Ms. Moore. I believe I shall now classify this as my favorite ""Moore movie."" She never disappoints.My initial response after having watched this film is that a lot of research went into this movie in order to recreate a very authentic time period piece. I am not simply referring to the visual aspect but also the way women were ""trained"" in order to be the perfect Barbie housewife and mother and always perfectly ""behaved."" Women were trained to be show pieces - to always look their best and to tolerate unappreciative husbands and to turn a blind eye (with a smile and perfect posture, of course) when their husbands whore around and cheat on them.The title for this movie is perfect. ""Far From Heaven"" is the story about a woman from an upper class family who appears to have it all. A successfully employed husband, a gorgeous home, two kids, a maid, a gardener, gorgeous looks and beautiful clothes, etc. But as the movie progresses it is painfully and sadly obvious that she really does not have much at all. Her character is that of a good woman who is ahead of her time. She is progressive about racial issues, is a faithful loving wife and a good mother. Tragically, she gets the short end of the stick on so many levels.I thought the movie was well done. The mix of racism, sexuality and the 50's era appeal were all captured beautifully. The only thing that could be considered a clich&eacute; was the subplot related to racism. But for me this story was more about the lack of equality and power that women had to endure and also having to put everyone else first and themselves last. I found the subplots of sexuality and racism to tie in very well with what women had to endure during a time in our not so long ago history. A story I would watch again and recommend to friends.",5,I loved this movie.,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,3246,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'wanted', 'leave', 'review', 'friend', 'bought', 'movie', 'so', 'watched', 'Saturday', 'July', '24th', '2010', 'skimmed', 'people', 'who', 'left', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'analysis', 'movie', 'acknowledge', 'harsh', 'regarding', 'movie.Some', 'reviewers', 'were', 'calling', 'movie', 'bad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Having', 'lived', 'New', 'England', 'short', 'time', '90', 'completely', 'understand', 'entire', 'stratification', 'social', 'class', 'movie', 'captured', 'detail', 'who', 'are', 'other', 'parts', 'country', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'deal', 'people', 'high', 'society', 'may', 'think', 'movie', 'blew', 'proportion', 'actually', 'was', 'quite', 'diluted', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'area', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'curiously', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'how', 'can', 'identify', 'what', 'saw', 'movie', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'having', 'lived', 'New', 'England', 'brief', 'time', '1990', 'am', 'Chicagoan', 'born', 'bred', 'am', 'wondering', 'many', 'people', 'other', 'parts', 'country', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'people', 'Hartford', 'Connecticut', 'New', 'England.Now', 'movie', 'review', 'was', 'seduced', 'everything', 'Wow', 'cinematography', 'wardrobes', 'furniture', 'design', 'sets', 'New', 'England', 'colloquialisms', 'course', 'acting', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'believe', 'shall', 'now', 'classify', 'favorite', 'Moore', 'movie', 'never', 'disappoints.My', 'initial', 'response', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'lot', 'research', 'went', 'movie', 'order', 'recreate', 'very', 'authentic', 'time', 'period', 'piece', 'am', 'not', 'simply', 'referring', 'visual', 'aspect', 'also', 'way', 'women', 'were', 'trained', 'order', 'be', 'perfect', 'Barbie', 'housewife', 'mother', 'always', 'perfectly', 'behaved', 'were', 'trained', 'be', 'show', 'always', 'look', 'best', 'tolerate', 'unappreciative', 'husbands', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'smile', 'perfect', 'posture', 'course', 'when', 'husbands', 'whore', 'cheat', 'them.The', 'title', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'story', 'woman', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'A', 'successfully', 'employed', 'husband', 'gorgeous', 'home', 'two', 'kids', 'maid', 'gardener', 'gorgeous', 'looks', 'beautiful', 'clothes', 'etc', 'movie', 'painfully', 'sadly', 'obvious', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'character', 'good', 'woman', 'who', 'ahead', 'time', 'progressive', 'racial', 'issues', 'faithful', 'loving', 'wife', 'good', 'mother', 'Tragically', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'so', 'many', 'levels.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'mix', 'racism', 'sexuality', '50', 'era', 'appeal', 'were', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'subplot', 'related', 'racism', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'lack', 'equality', 'power', 'women', 'had', 'endure', 'also', 'having', 'put', 'everyone', 'else', 'first', 'last', 'found', 'subplots', 'sexuality', 'racism', 'tie', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'women', 'had', 'endure', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'history', 'A', 'story', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend', 'friends']",N/A

I must say that I have watched it more than once since I received it the day the film was released on dvd but I could never bring myself to write a review. Moore playing her heart out to perfection as an uptight perfect housewife of the 50's to her sexually closeted homosexual husband. What erupts on the screen never stops and keeps one off ease. Moore never truly lets her emotions fly, her scenes of pain and anguish are hidden behind her china like skin and perfect hair. Haysbert and Quaid match her performance to the hilt. Quaid overly expressive and brooding as he wrestles with his emotions and Haybert as the calm and educated negro she falls for.Haynes puts the drama of the film inside the house. The house which is perfect in every way down to its monochrome couch and chairs is off set by the drama brought into the house. Moore is truly trapped here and often bottle her emotions to keep the facade admist but outside the property Moore can let go and she often does so in the comfort of Haysbert!The final scenes of the flick can have you reaching for the tissue. Never once do Haysbert and Moore kiss but just the wave goodbye has more intimate detail and love in it than Moore's entire union with quaid. Yes this flick does copy heavily from Douglas Sirk's masterpieces like ""Written on the Wind"" but when it's copied from such amazing source material no one can blame a retread.

603384,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JLQH,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","... she awoke with a start around two in the morning, with a realization that he, her husband and father of  her two young elementary school-aged children, was for the fourth night running once again not home from work, from that damn project that his boss, his damn boss (although she would not, properly lady-like raised, properly educated at Sarah Lawrence, Class of 1948, to be the perfect mate for her up and coming man and mother to his adoring children, utter those damns in public, well, at least not outside the friendly confines of her Ladies Club luncheons). Somewhere deep  in her restless sleep she sensed something was wrong, not some something articulable, not something she could present him with, but something gnawing at her.She immediately ran through the list of possible wrongs and came up with only one conclusion-he was with another woman. She had failed, failed miserable to be that help mate, to be that confidant, to be that worthy homemaker that she read about in those women's magazines she picked up occasionally from the check-out counter at the supermarket. She promised herself to do better, to read the articles more carefully, and to, carefully, ask her best friend Bev who had been through it all with her Ben, what to do. Bev said surprise him some night at work with a special dinner. She did.Yes, he was having an affair, an affair with a man. He was doing an act which dare not speak its name. Her husband was nothing but a damn homo and she would say that in public, very loud in public if he didn't stop, stop being, what was it the girls said at that art show they attended as that fairy art critic came in the door,  oh yes, ""light on his feet.""  A damn homosexual, a damn queer like those guys she would see in New York in the Village when she went into the city to shop. She wished now, wished to high heaven, that he was having an affair with a woman. Damn.And he, her husband he, all confused, all too much work, too much alcohol, too much hidden rage, too much all getting ahead in the rat race 1950s world, raising up that ancient itch, long suppressed. Long suppressed since college, New York University Class of 1947, maybe a little after when he had that affair with sweet Raymond, the funny abstract artist, who all the girls (if they only knew) and boys (boys who knew) too were crazy over, could not stop himself, could not stop partaking of the crime, the crime in his eyes, of the partaking of the act that dare not speak its name. Jesus, that was just above being negro in the contempt scale, his own self-contempt as well as that of his neighbors. Looking back he remembered that first time, that first time with his boyhood friend, Eddy, and how they explored each other on that Boy Scout camping trip when they were tent-mates. And how soon after Eddy ""grew out"" of his taste and went with girls, a million girls as if to mock him, Eddy, beloved Eddy, who later would fall in frozen Inchon.He had tried, tried to be normal, tried to fit in the leafy suburban ranch house big lawn country club life, tried to be a good if distracted father, tried to bring home the bacon, really tried with her too, tried in bed (always with a few drinks in him and a picture of some pretty boy flame encountered on the streets in his head). But it was no good, no good at all when the itch came back. He was queer, and only queer love would make him whole in that red scare cold war good night. And so he left, left her, the kids, the snide leaf cocktail Saturday night country club dance life and went to search for himself, and who he was.In the end she depended on the kindness of strangers to see her through.

Thus, the decision to purchase a copy is based on a perception of extraordinary quality; the assumption is you'll watch it more than once. Most films fail this test; Far From Heaven passes it dramatically.This jewel dazzles on every level, conception, directing, cinematography, acting, relevance, and heart. In conception it is a stylistic homage to the melodramatic films of the 1950s, and to its eternal credit, is played straight, completely without irony. Director Todd Haynes, fond of fishing in some very dark water, exercises admirable restraint here and respect for his source material. The cinematography is simply breathtaking, this movie is consistently gorgeous eye candy from start to finish. When autumn leaves fall in the idealized Connecticut back yard, they are not merely autumn leaves, they are the most perfect autumn leaves ever. Julianne Moore's beauty fits well in this context, and her wardrobe and mannerisms say everything about the alleged ""perfection"" of her life. The innocent way she inhabits this mythical landscape causes viewers to forget that she's acting, which is the definition of acting.Her secretly tormented husband is played by Dennis Quaid. Quaid is consistently workmanlike with many good performances to his credit, but here he is like a tennis player who, for some unknown reason, is playing far above what is normally his best game. Dennis Haysbert, now familiar to millions as President Palmer on Fox's 24, knows far more than Mrs. Whitaker about the cruelty lurking behind American society's cheerful mask. The social suicide facing all these key players, and the internal pain they must confront, is discussed in whispers behind closed doors. This will lull some viewers into the mistaken belief that Far From Heaven is a ""period piece"" reflecting a repressed age now mercifully outgrown. Haynes is actually making the opposite point, the difference exists only in degree, not essence.These people seem to live in the world of Henry James, where social class can be determined by how you hold your teacup. Today, we imagine ourselves more free and tolerant because we use the ugly epithets brazenly. But the darkness we carry around inside undermines our humanity in precisely the same way; just like these people we fear and flee from the content, clinging desperately to the veneer.

603386,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005JLQH,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[0, 2]","I am astonished at how good ""Far From Heaven"" is in all categories: screenplay, direction, themes, acting, locations, and design. It's just triumphant in all respects, especially considering it's a genre that Hollywood seems to have lost the blueprints for in the early sixties, back when anything unconventional became the norm to explore and movies about domestic travail of the bourgeoisie were DONE, already.Although not a direct replica, the director modeled his overall style after the idiosyncratic 1950s film director Douglas Sirk, who was known for domestic melodrama such as ""All that Heaven Allows"" and ""Written on the Wind."" (Notice similarity between name of first film and this one.) Fortunately for us, citizens as well as moviegoers here in the 2000s are freer to examine topics that could only be alluded to 45 years ago: homosexuality and racial interraction.How long has it been since a TV show or movie came along set in the Fifties that was sincere about itself? ""Happy Days"" was an amusingly exaggerated notion of the Fifties, nothing more. ""Pleasantville"" was an excellent movie with a serious social topic (racism), but at heart its gimmick was camp science fiction, the notion that Nineties kids have to be sucked into an old Fifties sitcom to make sense of their lives.Indeed, since the mid-1970s an easy way to get laughs is to rip off the Eisenhower decade through simple parody, as when Beaver shoots Eddie Haskell on a late-night parody of ""Leave it to Beaver"", or the lazy rage for mock-retro TV advertisements.But after beating up the Fifties for 25 years, the Fifties have turned tail and beat ME up. Excellent ""Far from Heaven,"" set in Hartford, Connecticut in 1957, came along and hit me in the head like a tennis mallet. Dennis Quaid stretches himself to the max as a midlevel TV company sales exec who is drifting farther and farther away from his family because of work commitments but mostly from his growing attraction toward sex--the same sex. He tries to quell his guilt with alternate bouts of rage and alcohol then makes things worse when he goes into therapy with the most modern kind of psychiatrist of the day, a strict conversion-oriented Freudian. Nothing could be worse.At home, the amazing, versatile Julianna Moore plays the wife. In good Fifties housewife style, her character tries for, and succeeds at, the difficult balancing act of making the house look as though it were running itself, while at the same time hosting daiquri-driven ""puncheons"" for her friends and no-holds-barred parties for Hartford's upper-middle-class, even at the same time holding up the social scene and the arts. Like the graceful swan, she must look stately above water while paddling like hell underneath to keep afloat, but we can't condemn her because her motives are well-meaning, not hypocritical. She knows perfectly well these fatuous social gestures complement and keep afloat her husband's career at TV-manufacturer ""Magnatech.""Alcohol, money worries, stress, and even her husband's ambivalent sexuality are not the lady's immediate worries: her chief antagonist is the set she runs with. Free spirits are slaughtered; conformits stay alive. That much we all know about the Fifties, but HOW that occurs and the WAY in which its citizens were so damaged is fascinating, especially with such terrific direction, acting, and a good taut script. Turns out that her husband's gayness (a very non-Fifties term) throws the family into crisis, but her having a friendly relationship with an African-American gardener throws the smart set into a frenzy. So much for Yankee tolerance. Ironically, all this is played out against President Eisenhower's attempt to desegregate the public schools of Little Rock, Arkansas. Wonder which is worse: mean and forthright or mean and genteel?Only people ""of a certain age"" will remember this time and milieu well, but those who have affirm that this superb film's rendering of a bygone era is scrupulous. This writer--a real meanie when it comes to looking for anachronisms and continuity error--was informed of one by a friend: a container of nutmeg had a plastic top. Shhhh! I myself am puzzled about how some of the vaster effects were obtained. A 1950s passenger train with coaches that wouldn't have survived Amtrak? Oh, one or two from a museum, but a whole train?Not just material things, but things visual: how on earth did ""Far from Heaven"" cough up a tracking shot that covers an entire town? Oh, a neighborhood is easy enough, but a whole town? (Several Jersey suburbs lent their exteriors to this production). Entire fleets of vintage cars? Much skill, craft and inspiration must have gone into this movie--and a lotta dough. My thanks go to Steven Soderberg and George Clooney, executive producers. Your courage won't be forgotten.Unless you'd absolutely despise a serious movie set in the year 1957 with blazingly brilliant fall color and top-notch acting, I'd more than highly recommend ""Far from Heaven."" In my opinion it's one of 2002's very best.PS:  In a superlative year, it's a pity this film had to be overlooked in the wake of other such superlative films as CHICAGO.  An embarrasment of riches!  But what few Oscar noms. it garnered, I'm more than happy to support.",5,Maybe They SHOULD Make 'em They Way They Used To-Again,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,5262,"['am', 'astonished', 'how', 'good',

Julianne Moore is luminous as a '50s housewife caught between the two men in her life--her beloved husband (Dennis Quaid) and her black gardener whom she befriends (Dennis Haysbert)""Far from Heaven"" is retro with an edge--Dennis Quaid embodies gay issues as the closeted husband. Dennis Haysbert embodies the racial issues of the time that still exist. There's a timelessness, but also a contemporary slant. Dennis Quaid,usually macho,is perfect as the closeted,conflicted husband. Haysbert is wonderful as Moore's wise friend. Julianne Moore is especially poignant and powerful in her portrayal. As a woman, she loses everything due to societal taboos. She becomes a stigmatized divorcee because of her husband's forbidden inclinations; she is isolated once Haysbert says their racial differences are irreconcilable.""Far from Heaven"" is melodrama.

And being a central-European, with no knowledge about what Douglas Sirk films were like, I had no preconceptions about ""Far From Heaven"". I took it as plainly as possible, ready to enjoy the cinematic treat many critics purported this to be. In the end, I must say I was vaguely disappointed. Although the movie has many redeeming qualities.""Far From Heaven"" certainly recreates setting of 1957 with striking sense of detail. From the beginning you have to but admire exquisite colors of cinematography, nice production design and beautiful music by Elmer Bernstein (""The Age Of Innocence""). The story unfolds when a typical mid-class housewife Cathy Whitaker (played by Julianne Moore) discovers that her handsome husband Frank leads a double life -- the other being homosexual -- something that probably was missing from the 1950's film productions. Cathy finds solace around their Afro-American gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert, a distillation of Nat King Cole and Sidney Poitier), before nasty gossip -- and unsuccessful 'treatment' of Frank -- mark the beginning of the end of Cathy's life as she'd known it.The viewer of course must feel sympathy with Cathy (merited also by Moore's flawless performance), who is portrayed as conventional, yet inside a very strong woman. The storyline itself flows conventionally, there's absolutely nothing surprising in the plot. Director Todd Haynes said he had wanted to shoot a movie about 1950's the way it couldn't be made in 1950's.

And it is obviously possible for a white lady to turn to a black man for comfort as she did.

603393,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B00005JLQH,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 2]","Perhaps this is the most powerful Todd Haynes film I've seen. But in order to fully understand it one must first be privy to Douglas Sirk movies. Rather than a remake ""Far From Heaven"" is a diegetic exploration of melodrama as a film genre and it's firmly inserted in the 1950s cinematographic tradition. Not only it evokes the sensibilities of a particular era, it also recreates its true nature; everything (from illumination techniques to music, brilliantly composed by Elmer Bernstein) has a common goal. That is why Haynes' magnum opus elegantly confronts Sirk's work, mainlyAll That Heaven Allows (The Criterion Collection)andImitation of Life.Once the film begins the viewer witnesses the harmless tribulations of a most perfect family, settled in an idyllic environment. Husband and wife are almost celebrities. Surrounded by success and smiling people, nothing seems to seclude them from happiness. Nonetheless, this is but a well elaborated faade, for Frank Whitaker, the man of the house, has succumbed yet again to his homosexual tendencies.In a very conservative society, there is no place for someone who defies the heterosexual normativity. Perhaps, following the infamous Lacan's sexuation graphic, homosexuality symbolizes the abject, id est, the vilest and the lowest... Despite being a successful entrepreneur, Frank is an exscinded individual, but first and foremost he is a subaltern subject. In a way, there are more limitations for him than for black people (racism in 1950's America is also a very important theme in Haynes' production).Peter Brooks and other intellectuals have analyzed the dynamics pertaining melodramas. For a melodrama to occur there must be a victim and a victimary; these stories cannot be fathomed without this binary equation (which, by the way, preexisted Sirk's movies). At moments, it seems as if Frank's wife is the victim, after all, not only must she cope with his husband's proclivities but also she must endure the domestic violence that takes place at some point. In addition to this situation, she must also struggle to hide the truth, although her husband makes that a difficult task (in the middle of a party he'll say aloud ""It's all smokes and mirrors, fellas. That's all it is""). However, from one's standpoint it's clear that Frank is but a mere victim of society itself. If homosexuality, according to Lacan, is the representation of the interdict, then it's society who demands and reinforces this interdiction.Homosexuality as an option is then socially banned. But at the same time it's also scientifically forbidden or at least invalidated. Frank's shrink assures him that this ""disease"" can and must be cured. There is treatment for it. Let's remember that American psychiatrist associations considered homosexuality as some sort of mental disorder until very recently, which just proves how narrow-minded certain doctors can be.But the interdict acquires power precisely because of the nature of its prohibited condition. After all, nothing is more attractive than that which is not supposed to be... Lacan explains that the interdict is always libidinized. Homosexual intercourse becomes highly erotic because it's forbidden. Thus it's evident that even if Frank tries to live the life of a straight man, he will eventually give in to his innermost desires.If Frank is a ""masculine gay"", unclenched from other generalized gay stereotypes, at least according to Judith Butler's Queer Theory inUndoing Gender, can he be absolved from his victim role? Absolutely not. Because Haynes film is a brilliant analysis of America, of sexuality, of repression and ultimately of the well-sought ideal of freedom. And Frank is the hero who will face all of these obstacles even if that means paying the highest price.",5,Victims and melodrama: an outsider's point of view,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,3777,"['Perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'order', 'fully', 'understand', 'must', 'first', 'be', 'privy', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'movies', 'Rather', 'remake', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'diegetic', 'exploration', 'melodrama', 'film', 'genre', 'firmly', 'inserted', '1950s', 'cinematographic', 'tradition', 'Not', 'only', 'sensibilities', 'particular', 'era', 'also', 'true', 'nature', 'everything', 'illumination', 'techniques', 'music', 'brilliantly', 'composed', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'common', 'goal', 'why', 'Haynes', 'magnum', 'opus', 'elegantly', 'Sirk', 'work', 'mainlyAll', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'andImitation', 'Life.Once', 'film', 'viewer', 'harmless', 'tribulations', 'most', 'perfect', 'family', 'settled', 'idyllic', 'environment', 'Husband', 'wife', 'are', 'almost', 'celebrities', 'Surrounded', 'success', 'smiling', 'people', 'nothing', 'seclude', 'happiness', 'Nonetheless', 'well', 'elaborated', 'faade', 'Frank', 'Whitaker', 'man', 'house', 'succumbed', 'yet', 'again', 'homosexual', 'tendencies.In', 'very', 'conservative', 'society', 'place', 'someone', 'who', 'heterosexual', 'normativity', 'Perhaps', 'following', 'infamous', 'Lacan', 'sexuation', 'graphic', 'homosexuality', 'abject', 'id', 'est', 'vilest', 'lowest', 'being', 'successful', 'entrepreneur', 'Frank', 'exscinded', 'individual', 'first', 'foremost', 'subaltern', 'subject', 'way', 'are', 'more', 'limitations', 'black', 'people', 'racism', '1950', 'America', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'theme', 'Haynes', 'production', '.Peter', 'Brooks', 'other', 'intellectuals', 'have', 'analyzed', 'dynamics', 'pertaining', 'melodramas', 'melodrama', 'occur', 'must', 'be', 'victim', 'victimary', 'stories', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fathomed', 'binary', 'equation', 'way', 'preexisted', 'Sirk', 'movies', 'moments', 'Frank', 'wife', 'victim', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'cope', 'husband', 'proclivities', 'also', 'must', 'endure', 'domestic', 'violence', 'place', 'point', 'addition', 'situation', 'must', 'also', 'struggle', 'hide', 'truth', 'husband', 'difficult', 'task', 'middle', 'party', ""'ll"", 'say', 'smokes', 'mirrors', 'fellas', 'However', 'one', 'standpoint', 'clear', 'Frank', 'mere', 'victim', 'society', 'homosexuality', 'according', 'Lacan', 'representation', 'interdict', 'then', 'society', 'who', 'interdiction.Homosexuality', 'option', 'then', 'socially', 'banned', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'scientifically', 'forbidden', 'least', 'invalidated', 'Frank', 'shrink', 'disease', 'can', 'must', 'be', 'cured', 'treatment', 'Let', 'remember', 'American', 'psychiatrist', 'associations', 'considered', 'homosexuality', 'sort', 'mental', 'disorder', 'very', 'recently', 'just', 'how', 'narrow-minded', 'certain', 'doctors', 'can', 'be.But', 'interdict', 'power', 'precisely', 'nature', 'prohibited', 'condition', 'nothing', 'more', 'attractive', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Lacan', 'explains', 'interdict', 'always', 'libidinized', 'Homosexual', 'intercourse', 'highly', 'erotic', 'forbidden', 'Thus', 'evident', 'even', 'Frank', 'live', 'life', 'straight', 'man', 'will', 'eventually', 'give', 'innermost', 'desires.If', 'Frank', 'masculine', 'gay', 'unclenched', 'other', 'generalized', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'according', 'Judith', 'Butler', 'Queer', 'Theory', 'inUndoing', 'Gender', 'can', 'be', 'absolved', 'victim', 'role', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'Haynes', 'film', 'brilliant', 'analysis', 'America', 'sexuality', 'repression', 'ultimately', 'well-sought', 'ideal', 'freedom', 'Frank', 'hero', 'who', 'will', 'face', 'obstacles', 'even', 'paying', 'highest', 'price']",N/A

When she turns to her black landscaper (Dennis Haysbert) for friendship and comfort, she finds her acquaintances and neighbors are not very enlightened about race relations.  Like the films to which it pays tribute, Far From Heaven presents an idyllic setting populated by people making big choices at dramatic moments, living lives in stark contrast to their surroundings.  The couple's children are invisible and easily disposed of -- ""Watch the children, would you, Sybill?"" -- in an era pined for by particular conservatives but remembered by many of us as a time of genteel sordidness and ugly hypocrisy, when race, gender, sexuality, legitimacy, income, career, kith, kin and company neatly boxed off your expected behavior, some were far more equal than others, and tolerance was not listed in anyone's book of virtues.This is a quiet film about appearances, restraint and social pressure.  On first viewing it, I enjoyed it but didn't think it was brilliant, though I loved the over-the-top look of the film, so to me it succeeded more as an homage than as a film in its own right.  And committed tribute it is -- with the look, the sets, the shots, the plot, the music, that never veer from their inspiration.  I did come to appreciate the film more on watching the accompanying features and listening to the director's commentary.Sets and costumes are sumptuous and the lighting is quite dramatic, darker than West Wing with pools of emerald and cobalt lights saturating nearly every interior shot.  It's jarring to watch the making-of feature and see that these scenes were filmed in normal light during the day.  Most of the exteriors were shot in gorgeous New Jersey locations.  NB: note the films being played at the local theatre at different points in the film.DVD extras include a commentary track by Haynes, a Q&A; with Haynes and Julianne Moore (who was pregnant during shooting), a trailer, brief production notes, cast & director info, an 11-1/2 minute making-of feature, and the Sundance Channel's Anatomy of a Scene which featured the Whitaker's party scene, a social climax marked by confrontational undercurrents.

The movie takes an interesting twist when the poised housewife played by Julianne Moore learns that her husband is gay.  Of course she dare not tell anyone (especially those gossiping friends of hers), but she soon learns she can confide in her black gardener (it helps that he is tall, dark, deep-voiced --- oh, and i like how they they slipped in the fact that he has a business degree...ewwww an EDUCATED ""negro""!).  Of course, the gardener takes an interest in this docile, kind, white woman who happens to be someone else's wife (it's interesting to me that this fine black gardener is even single...his wife died six years ago? And none of those sistas around there tried to snatch him up? He could have had his choice of any number of women I'm sure...but he decides to take interest in his married employer...hmph...figures).  Anyway, the movie rolls along at a fairly predictable pace, and I feel sorry for Moore's character who, unfortunately, has no true friends except for the gardener.  Her best girlfriend seems more appalled at the wife's interest in the black gardener than in her husband's homosexuality.  That she could be with a black man --- the mere idea --- WELL!! Of course the gardener is kind, accepting, charming, and handsome.  He is soooo interested in her when she is married, so willing to challenge commonly held attitudes that spoke against their friendship.  Yet when she comes to him at the end of the movie and tells him she is soon to be single (her husband wants a divorce), he is less interested.  All of a sudden now the most important thing is his daughter; his daughter's best interest; his daughter's needs.  He wasn't thinking about his daughter when he sent her outside to play with kids she didn't know so he could have a few moments to chat with his married employer at the art exhibit (yeah, and try to impress her with flowery words...uh huh...i got your number, buddy).  Was he thinking about his daughter when he took that woman to lunch and danced with her? The fact is, things just didn't go how the gardener thought: his plan backfired and his daughter got hurt by white boys wanting to ""teach her a lesson"" because her father was close with a white woman.  I felt so sorry for this housewife.  Here she has a homosexual husband who wants to leave her for another man and she is hurt, yes.  But there's the gardener.  She has feelings for him.  Maybe THEY can be together now.  But the gardener has other plans.  Think women are more attractive when their taken? I do.  True motives and true love can be revealed when the going gets tough.  If he really cared about that woman, he could have said, ""of course you can visit me when I get settled in Baltimore...I care about you and I want to continue to explore this relationship.""

The reason for it, strangely, is the delight I felt about this movie, which is not supposed to be set in the actual 1957 or a parody of 1957. This movie is supposed to evoke the feel of those cheesy Douglas Sirk too-perfect Technicolor melodramas for the time by standing alongside them, looking like them and treating its subjects in the manner that those movies did. It is, as best it can be, a fun old movie (that just happens to have been made today).It's almost impossible to describe to people who aren't familiar with Douglas Sirk. (Even if someone's seen ""Imitation of Life,"" they don't necessarily associate Sirk with it.) The movie's like an episode of ""Leave it to Beaver,"" only Ward's fighting his attraction to guys and June's main confidante is her black male gardener. They try to maintain their idyllic appearance in the society, though the issues that they can't completely comprehend nor put into words are tearing apart their world.This was everything I wanted ""Pleasantville"" to be. But it's better than that because it represents its '50s movie culture subject without making fun of it, just going along with the joke completely straight-faced. At the same time, it manages to say more about the issues it faces by placing them in that environment, forcing its characters to confront things that are completely alien to them.I don't know if a lot of people are going to get this movie, and I fear that it's going to face a backlash. I overheard someone on the way out of the theater calling it ""too stylized."" To me, though, the style was, yes, campy but apt. The acting was across-the-board excellent.

603399,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B00005JLQH,Bitcetc,"[5, 9]","From the first cinematographically beautiful screen, Far From Heaven bathes the movie-goer in its lushness, its luxuriant view of life in the 'fifties. Director Todd Haynes completely avoids the unconscious condescension toward that era expressed by other movies which use black and white or a two-dimensional stereotype of daily life to represent a feeling we have that something was lacking in the life of the 'fifties.Julianne Moore's character ""Cathy"" certainly begins the movie with an appreciation of the richness of her life. Stunningly beautiful in the movie, Cathy knows she has a beautiful life, and works hard to hold her vision of perfection together. Liberal, kind, polite, she is ""Mrs. Magnatech"", an icon of her age. So perfect is her world that it is believable, though funny, when she rebukes her son for saying ""Jeez, Mom,"" with a ""We don't use language like that at this house."" Perfectly costumed, perfectly coiffed (look for Oscar nominations for costume and make-up), she sallies forth to carpool, to volunteer for good causes, to support her husband, to plan perfect parties in her perfectly modulated voice.Her husband, Dennis Quaid, ""Mr. Magnatech"", has much more difficulty trying to uphold the image. His perfect world is in trouble, and he is unravelling as his dark secret is coming into the light. While he distances himself from his perfect wife, his perfect life, she meets a man who is her equal in dignity, in compassion, in love for beauty and the arts, a natural king among men. And, oh yes, he's black.Julianne Moore's performance is Oscar-worthy. Personally, I do not care for Dennis Quaid, so the fact that I didn't care for  his character worked for me. I do not know whether Dennis Haysbert exercised any acting muscle or not, as the only roles in which I've seen him call for him to be this accomplished, dignified, caring and wise man. His role on the ""24"" television series seemed to call for more of a stretch. But he certainly inhabits this character.As this lovely, serene little world of prettiness, pleasantness, and perfection crashes upon the ugliness beneath, we are already so vested in this movie that we are not tempted to look condescendingly at the 'fifties for its self-delusions, but to look at other eras instead. Remembering the era of The Crucible, for example, where even more rigid images of perfection controlled the surface, and even more viciousness lay hidden beneath, we know we've progressed somewhat over the ugly attitudes which come into the sunlight in Hartford, Connecticut, in this portrayal. But we leave the theater wondering in what ways our own images of perfection are blinding us to our own era's ugliness beneath.""Best movie"" material--- certainly likely to be overrun, but should not be overlooked.",5,Perfection unraveled in Far from Heaven,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,2782,"['first', 'cinematographically', 'beautiful', 'screen', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'movie-goer', 'lushness', 'luxuriant', 'view', 'life', ""'fifties"", 'Director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'completely', 'unconscious', 'condescension', 'era', 'expressed', 'other', 'movies', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'two-dimensional', 'stereotype', 'daily', 'life', 'represent', 'feeling', 'have', 'something', 'was', 'lacking', 'life', ""'fifties.Julianne"", 'Moore', 'character', 'Cathy', 'certainly', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'richness', 'life', 'Stunningly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Cathy', 'beautiful', 'life', 'hard', 'hold', 'vision', 'perfection', 'together', 'Liberal', 'kind', 'polite', 'Mrs.', 'Magnatech', 'icon', 'age', 'perfect', 'world', 'believable', 'funny', 'when', 'son', 'saying', 'Jeez', 'Mom', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'language', 'house', 'Perfectly', 'costumed', 'perfectly', 'coiffed', 'look', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'costume', 'make-up', 'forth', 'carpool', 'volunteer', 'good', 'causes', 'support', 'husband', 'plan', 'perfect', 'parties', 'perfectly', 'modulated', 'voice.Her', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Mr.', 'Magnatech', 'much', 'more', 'difficulty', 'trying', 'uphold', 'image', 'perfect', 'world', 'trouble', 'unravelling', 'dark', 'secret', 'coming', 'light', 'perfect', 'wife', 'perfect', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'equal', 'dignity', 'compassion', 'love', 'beauty', 'arts', 'natural', 'king', 'men', 'oh', 'yes', 'black.Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Personally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'character', 'worked', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'exercised', 'acting', 'muscle', 'not', 'only', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'call', 'be', 'accomplished', 'dignified', 'caring', 'wise', 'man', 'role', '24', 'television', 'series', 'seemed', 'call', 'more', 'stretch', 'certainly', 'character.As', 'lovely', 'serene', 'little', 'world', 'prettiness', 'pleasantness', 'perfection', 'crashes', 'ugliness', 'beneath', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'vested', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'tempted', 'look', 'condescendingly', ""'fifties"", 'self-delusions', 'look', 'other', 'eras', 'instead', 'Remembering', 'era', 'Crucible', 'example', 'where', 'even', 'more', 'rigid', 'images', 'perfection', 'controlled', 'surface', 'even', 'more', 'viciousness', 'lay', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'know', ""'ve"", 'progressed', 'somewhat', 'ugly', 'attitudes', 'come', 'sunlight', 'Hartford', 'Connecticut', 'portrayal', 'leave', 'theater', 'wondering', 'what', 'ways', 'own', 'images', 'perfection', 'are', 'blinding', 'own', 'era', 'ugliness', 'beneath', 'Best', 'movie', 'material', 'certainly', 'likely', 'be', 'overrun', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked']",N/A
603400,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B00005JLQH,Black Barbie,"[4, 6]","It's 1957. Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) has it all: a charming and successful husband, Frank Whitaker (Dennis Quaid), two adorable children, fashionable friends and she is the perfect housewife and mother with impeccable manners. Yet, the dark and unfair side of 1950's perfection is revealed in this moving and touching drama. Mr. Whitaker has a secret that crushes Mrs. Whitaker. She finds comfort in her intelligent and calm gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert) and feelings grow between the pair. However, she causes an uproar because her confidant is black.Positive PointsJulianne Moore was absolutely delightful and bloody brilliant!  The way she portrays her character's genuine and kind heart is beautiful; her soft-spoken manner that betrays her inner pain is vivid and heartbreaking. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 2003 for this role (only losing to Charlize Theron for her role in 'Monster'). I have not seen Monster but judging from Far From Heaven, this category must been one of fierce debate.Dennis Haysbert was impressive in his dramatic role as the kindred spirit that Moore is attracted to and while their scenes together are ones of delicacy, there is great chemistry between the two. He is now widening his scope from not only acting in African-American films like 'Love & Basketball' to the acclaimed TV series, '24' and now this feature, 'Far From Heaven'.Dennis Quaid? Hmm, I think he'll grow on you. At first, his performance is hard to comprehend - is he truly sorry for his secret or is he just biding his time? Then at the end, he does deliver a great show of the emotional guilt and turmoil he is experiencing because of leading a double life.The costume and art design is bloody wicked! The dresses, the hair, the makeup look brilliant but it doesn't feel modernised at all, it looks like you have been transported to a posh neighbourhood in 1950s America. The use of light, dark and colour is excellent. The colour is rich and vibrant but yet when it is dark, it adds to the sombre and tragic tone of the film. 'Far From Heaven' is in the league as 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' when it comes to the usage of colour - captivating to look at for the artistic flair.Negative PointOne negative is the lack of character development: Sybil (Viola Davis) could have been an integral part of the story and so could have Eleanor (Patricia Clarkson) as she was Cathy's best friend but instead they were peripheral figures who weren't as strong as they should have been.Last ThoughtThe message of this film is multi-layered, exposing the attitudes towards inter-racial relations and homosexuality and portraying that betrayal lurks everywhere even behind the smiles of the perfect couple.",4,Wow!,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,2743,"['1957', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'charming', 'successful', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Whitaker', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'two', 'adorable', 'children', 'fashionable', 'friends', 'perfect', 'housewife', 'mother', 'impeccable', 'manners', 'dark', 'unfair', 'side', '1950', 'perfection', 'revealed', 'moving', 'touching', 'drama', 'Mr.', 'Whitaker', 'secret', 'Mrs.', 'Whitaker', 'comfort', 'intelligent', 'calm', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'feelings', 'grow', 'pair', 'However', 'uproar', 'confidant', 'black.Positive', 'PointsJulianne', 'Moore', 'was', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'bloody', 'brilliant', 'way', 'character', 'genuine', 'kind', 'heart', 'beautiful', 'soft-spoken', 'manner', 'inner', 'pain', 'vivid', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', '2003', 'role', 'only', 'losing', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'role', ""'Monster"", 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Monster', 'judging', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'category', 'must', 'been', 'one', 'fierce', 'debate.Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'was', 'impressive', 'dramatic', 'role', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Moore', 'attracted', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'ones', 'delicacy', 'great', 'chemistry', 'two', 'now', 'widening', 'scope', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'African-American', 'films', ""'Love"", 'Basketball', 'acclaimed', 'TV', 'series', ""'24"", 'now', 'feature', ""Heaven'.Dennis"", 'Quaid', 'Hmm', 'think', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'first', 'performance', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'truly', 'sorry', 'secret', 'just', 'biding', 'time', 'Then', 'end', 'deliver', 'great', 'show', 'emotional', 'guilt', 'turmoil', 'experiencing', 'leading', 'double', 'life.The', 'costume', 'art', 'design', 'bloody', 'wicked', 'dresses', 'hair', 'makeup', 'look', 'brilliant', ""n't"", 'feel', 'modernised', 'have', 'been', 'transported', 'posh', 'neighbourhood', '1950s', 'America', 'use', 'light', 'dark', 'colour', 'excellent', 'colour', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'yet', 'when', 'dark', 'sombre', 'tragic', 'tone', 'film', ""'Far"", 'Heaven', 'league', ""'Girl"", 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'when', 'usage', 'colour', 'captivating', 'look', 'artistic', 'flair.Negative', 'PointOne', 'negative', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Sybil', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'Eleanor', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'was', 'Cathy', 'best', 'friend', 'instead', 'were', 'peripheral', 'figures', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'should', 'have', 'been.Last', 'ThoughtThe', 'message', 'film', 'multi-layered', 'exposing', 'attitudes', 'inter-racial', 'relations', 'homosexuality', 'portraying', 'betrayal', 'lurks', 'everywhere', 'even', 'smiles', 'perfect', 'couple']",N/A

Her take on the film being it was too realistic and reminded her too much of the things she hated most about the 50s: the so called social mores and values one was expected to live up to.'Far From Heaven' is perfectly shot in brilliant Technicolor with fine attention to detail:  excellent costumes, gorgeous sets and beautiful vintage cars.  This gives the movie an almost pristine surreal quality that counters the harsh reality of Cathy Whitaker's less than perfect life (Julianne Moore in yet another outstanding performance). Add to this the sometimes over the top ""By gosh! By golly!"" acting (no doubt done on purpose to further convey the surreal quality of 50s life) and you find yourself immersed in a frighteningly domestic Stepford wife world where housewives dress to the nines and gossip over daiquiris and husbands ""work late"" at the office.Cathy sleepwalks through her life aching for something that she can't quite comprehend.  Her girlfriends chatter and giggle about how many times their husbands like to &#65533;get into the mood"" as she perturbedly stays quiet. When approached by her best friend about speaking to a Black man at an art exhibit she innocently replies: ""He has some interesting views on modern art.""  When she finds her husband kissing another man, she thinks a vacation will solve all that. Cathy is so naive with herself and her surroundings and so intent on living the ideal 50s life that she's nearly oblivious to the changes around her, the changes she is causing and the changes that are waiting for her. When the film ended, I was anxious to know what lay in store for Cathy.  Will she find true love and happiness?  Will she champion the cause for equal rights?  Will she finally become a strong willed and independent woman?  Julianne Moore infuses so many subtle nuances into her portrayal of Cathy that although at times you want to slap some sense into her, you can't help but feel her pain, especially when she finally breaks down.Although the themes explored in &#65533;Far From Heaven&#65533; have been tackled before, this film comes across as touching and heartfelt.  It&#65533;s a close call between Julianne and Nicole for this year&#65533;s Best Actress Oscar.

She's so distraught and can only find solace in the humble fine presence of her black gardner.  This creates a shockwave in the community that has far-reaching implications for 1950s America.The whole affair is shot beautifully as a technicolor dream, and on DVD the colors pop just as they did on the big screen.  Also here to savor is a Berstein musical score that becomes its own character in the movie.  WOW!  It's old-style movie magic.But don't forget the MODERN extras - ANATOMY OF A SCENE, MAKING OF featurette, interview with Todd Haynes and Ms. Moore, and a commentary track!

Her children address her as ""Mother""; her maid addresses her as ""Mrs. Whitaker"", she refers to her husband as ""Mr. Whitaker"", and her children are scolded for using such words as ""geez"" -- because that language is not used in the Whitaker household.  The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing the plot and commenting on the acting.

Apparently, the movie's creators used old sitcoms for guidance in drawing Moore's character.  They have her clomping around her home in pumps and dressy, crinolined frocks, fluttering about as spacily as Lucy Ricardo--when the dialogue proves her to otherwise be intelligent, socially conscious, and forward thinking.  The creators obviously did no homework concerning racial relations or homosexuality either.  Are we to believe that in the fifties a white woman couldn't carry on a conversation or ride in a pickup truck with her black gardener without an entire community assuming they were having an affair?  Given the taboos of the times, people would have been more likely to think anything but that!  And oh-so-proper Moore would have been the last person her acquaintances would suspect of scandalous behavior.  On the other hand, the movie's treatment of attitudes toward homosexuality suffers from a present viewpoint being imposed on the past.  The characters appear much less shocked and dismayed by the idea of same-sex conduct than by that of interracial sexuality, a notion that is simply out of kilter with the times!  The script dutifully attempts to convey the decade's condemnation in presenting various exhibitions of shame and confusion, but then the love that dares not speak its name abruptly finds a voice--a lilting one at that!  This would have been a great movie had it drawn believable characters and dealt realistically with the subjects at hand.  The relationship depicted between Moore and Dennis Haysbert is utterly charming, and viewers can easily maintain sympathy and interest in their plight.

Set in 1950's American Suburbia, the viewer will quickly spot the film's collage of colors - and sheer intensity of the sweeping landscapes, from the tree lined street, gardens and buildings.  I found it unique and timeless.  I think in some respect it helps detract from the underlying messages of the film - repressed 1950's homosexuality and purely hateful discrimination against people of color.  Thank heaven that we have left the 1950's behind (for the most part).This is a somewhat difficult film to describe, as it's divided into 2 distinct story lines.  The primary focus in my opinion is actually our housewife's (Cathy - played by Julianne Moore) relationship with her black gardener.  This story is focused upon in much greater depth and is extremely powerful and though-provoking.  Although the relationship develops upon learning of her husbands sexual encounter (kiss) with a man, it still takes precedence, as does the story of discrimination.Unlike the 1950's households of Ozzie and Harriet or I Love Lucy, this one is in turmoil as lives are changed forever.  The ending is powerful. Another unexpected great film in my list of 5 star experiences.

This time out, he nails it. Everything about Far From Heaven is flawless, from the pastel production design and complimentary costuming (even to the rear projection for interior car scenes and the Lana-Turner-tied-back scarf) to the soundtrack and the titles. Stylistically, there's not a single jarring note; even the slicked-down hair on the males is just right. Thematically this is far darker and far deeper than the 50s models to which Haynes pays homage. It's about appalling hypocrisy (it's more acceptable to have a homosexual husband than a friend who is a man of color), about the repression of true emotion, and about the surface of things being kept clean and shiny at all times--while, underneath, emotions are simmering on their way to a boil. Particularly stunning are the scenes between the always-wonderful Moore and stalwart performer Haysbert. There is so much subtext, so much quiet courage that the viewer dares to hope for the impossible--that, just once, two people will make it past the rigid boundaries of convention. Certainly, we're left hoping that they do; just not within our viewing. Dennis Quaid does a decent turn as the hopelessly conflicted husband who wants desperately to be ""normal,"" but can't quite manage.

I am familiar with the Douglas Sirk movies on which he based this film. I found it a very powerful experience to go to a theater and see for the first time a movie in the style of rerun staples on Turner Classic Movies.Yet this experience did not translate for me on the small screen. I might as well have been watching a Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman movie on TCM.The film's plot is powerful and profound: the marriage of a perfect 50's couple in Hartford, CT, is threatened by his homosexuality and her friendship with a black college-educated gardner. Dennis Quaid, in the role of the tortured, gay husband, turned in the finest performance of the year in a supporting role in my book. The dvd is worth it just for his performance. He haunted me. Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert are also wonderful in their roles.Haynes uses the technique of exaggeration as a means to examine the artifice and the lives of those individuals in 50's. As other reviewers have noted in the press, not everyone in 1957 drove a 1957 car, had everything in their home purchased that year in a 1957 style, wore 1957 clothes etc. People then, as today, drove older clothes, had a mismash of furniture and styles in their homes, and a wardrobe of new and old. Yet this technique, while obviously artificial, highlights the emphasis on appearance of the era. Once again, I loved it in the movie, I found it less impressive on the small screen. I also wasn't overwhelemed by the director's commentary-I thought that I would get more from him.Still an important, intelligent movie that most serious moviegoers should see at some point.",4,"5 stars for the theaterical release, 4 for the dvd",1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,1850,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'last', 'fall', 'loved', 'it.The', 'director', 'exaggerated', 'everything', 'film', 'faux', '50', 'styles-the', 'clothes', 'sets', 'cars', 'film', 'graphics', 'music-and', 'big', 'screen', 'made', 'huge', 'impact', 'am', 'familiar', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'movies', 'based', 'film', 'found', 'very', 'powerful', 'experience', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'style', 'rerun', 'staples', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies.Yet', 'experience', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'small', 'screen', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'movie', 'TCM.The', 'film', 'plot', 'powerful', 'profound', 'marriage', 'perfect', '50', 'couple', 'Hartford', 'CT', 'threatened', 'homosexuality', 'friendship', 'black', 'college-educated', 'gardner', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'role', 'tortured', 'gay', 'husband', 'turned', 'finest', 'performance', 'year', 'supporting', 'role', 'book', 'dvd', 'just', 'performance', 'haunted', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'roles.Haynes', 'technique', 'exaggeration', 'means', 'examine', 'artifice', 'lives', 'individuals', '50', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'press', 'not', 'everyone', '1957', 'drove', '1957', 'car', 'had', 'everything', 'home', 'purchased', 'year', '1957', 'style', 'wore', '1957', 'clothes', 'etc', 'People', 'then', 'today', 'drove', 'older', 'clothes', 'had', 'mismash', 'furniture', 'styles', 'homes', 'wardrobe', 'new', 'old', 'technique', 'obviously', 'artificial', 'emphasis', 'appearance', 'era', 'Once', 'again', 'loved', 'movie', 'found', 'less', 'impressive', 'small', 'screen', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'overwhelemed', 'director', 'commentary-I', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'important', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'most', 'serious', 'moviegoers', 'should', 'see', 'point']",N/A

The husband of the family is secretly homosexual, and greatly tormented to be. The wife is more than supportive of her husband, family, and her role in society, but she is clearly lost and unfulfilled by what seems under all conventional standards the achievement of an ideal existence. In her desperation she develops a close bond with a sensitive Negro gardener, and more than any other occurrence within the film it is the hostile reactions to this friendship from all sides which carries Far From Heaven through its run-time.The good: with the exception of the lack of depicted smoking so endemic in the era, this movie looked like the 1950's down to the tiniest detail. It also featured a profoundly restrained performance by Julianne Moore, and the beautiful scenery of autumn colors around her in the first half of the movie was striking to behold.The bad: the plot was impotent, shallow, and betrayed a lack of understanding on its writers' part of the mores of the era in which it was set.

I'll start I guess with the film itself, a film that I decided to see about a year ago but have not had the chance or the persistence to go ahead with it until last night.  I've read an article, about six months ago, likening this film to `Brokeback Mountain' and the article is really what set my determination over the edge.  `Brokeback Mountain' to me is one of the greatest and most intelligent films I've ever seen and so with that in mind my mind was set in seeing this film as well.  Well truth be told `Brokeback' this is not, but this film truly resonates at a high level with the viewer if they allow it.  This to me would be the flip side of `Brokeback', the story of the scorned wife not the confused husband.  Cathy Whitaker (Moore) is living the perfect life, and this life is immediately fed to us within the first few minutes of the film where the local newspaper is doing an article on her.  She has the perfect house, children husband and she seems genuinely happy, that is all until she discovers her husband's dark secret.Dennis Quaid is one of the reasons this movie is so wonderful for he finally proves what I've suspected all along, this guy can really freaking act.  His portrayal of the confused Frank Whitaker is so emotionally charged and heart breaking that I'm utterly astonished it didn't garner him at least an Oscar nomination (while in my humble opinion he should have won).  After Cathy comes upon her husband in the arms of another man they are forced to face the facts, and so in an attempt to save his marriage and his family Frank agrees to see a doctor in an effort to `cure' him of his tendencies.  What makes this film for me was the genuine sincerity in Quaid's performance.  Every outburst, every tear, every word and or action was completely surreal and convincing.  I was just truly blown away by the power in his performance.In the wake of this new development in the Whitaker household Cathy begins to take solace in the form of her new gardener Raymond Deagan (Haysbert) who extends to Cathy the kind of genuine kindness she's lacking from everyone else around her.  While never disclosing her family's dark new nightmare she does unload some of her surface feelings to her new found friend, but this friendship also ends up being more of a malediction when the community starts to frown down upon her choice of associates.  You see, Raymond is black and in this 50's community, well a white woman just doesn't spend that much alone time with a black man.  With her friends as well as her husband turning on her she ends her relationship with Raymond, which ends up being the hardest mistake she'll ever have to live with, and continues to work on her family.  I won't give away the outcome of this film but I'm sure it's one that we all saw coming.Another thing that this film helped me to see was what all this Julianne Moore hype was all about.  I've actually never been on her bandwagon, having really only seen performances I've felt were good at best, but her performance here was stunning and perfectly poised and on point.  She captured the essence of the 50's housewife to perfection and carried so much expression and weight in her face alone.  I did notice something though, and I just want to throw this out there, but to me Julianne's performance really shined when she was interacting with her brilliant supporting cast, her best scenes stand where she was bouncing off of Quaid's intensity or Haysbert's sincerity or even Clarkson's wit and charm.  On her own I felt that Moore's performance wasn't quite as strong.  Don't get me wrong, she still was outstanding, but I felt her performance would get a face lift every time someone else occupied the screen alongside her.I will make a quick note as well in regards to Todd Haynes brilliant directing here.  He truly captures the era that was the 1950's, from the look, the feel as well as the performances he drew out from his entire cast.  He was so effective that throughout the first ten minutes or so I could almost swear I was watching an episode of `Leave it to Beaver', from the way the children spoke to their mother to the way the family interacted in general, is was all so `otherworldly' as some have said yet all the more real because of that.  I was utterly impressed with every passing frame.  Very well done indeed.So in closing I wanted to address that this film does indeed touch upon the prejudices we all see even today, whether they be sexual or racial, but to me this film is more about the loneliness one faces when everything he or she believed in comes crashing down.  The film for the most part focuses on Cathy and her dilemma as her supposed perfect life is destroyed, but in scenes like Franks final breakdown we can really see that this is not affecting him in a good way either.  He doesn't want to tear his family apart; he just doesn't know how to say no to what he desires.  He knows that he'll never be truly happy if he ignores it.  It's a no win situation for someone is going to walk away hurt.  While Frank may in the short of things look like a horrible person or in any instance the villain of this story he is in fact just another victim in this game we all call our lives.  Thanks in a large part to Quaid's riveting performance `Far From Heaven' will be remembered, no not as the best film of 2002 but certainly as one of the most moving.",5,Sheer

603414,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B00005JLQH,Daryl B,"[8, 11]","Julianne Moore is an actress that makes interesting choices in her career.  Whether it be a drug addicted porn star in ""Boogie Nights"", stepping into the shoes of Clarice Starling in place of Jodie Foster for the film ""Hannibal"" or as the perfect 1950s wife and socialite in this film, she always seems to be right on target.  Cathy, a dedicated wife and mother (imagine the combination of TV mom, June Cleaver and Melanie Wilkes of ""Gone With the Wind""), seems to lead a life that anyone would clamor for. She is kind to everyone, well respected and a role model for the women in her community.  As the film progresses, however, we see how her world slowly begins to unravel.  Her husband, played very nicely by Dennis Quaid, is a man tormented by the fact that he can no longer control his homosexual urges. The fact that he is uncomfortable with his repressed sexual orientation causes him to lash out at his wife and turn to alcohol.  The one person Cathy turns to for consulation is the family's new gardener, an African American man (Dennis Haysbert of Fox's drama ""24"").  A friendship grows between the two, who see the beauty in each other but both the period of time and Cathy's social circle frown upon such a friendship and most definitely a relationship.  The story is a very emotional ride and well worth the admission for this film. Diretor Todd Haynes does a great job of mixing beautiful scenery and the slow building of tension among the story's main protaganists to make a deeply engrossing film.  Patricia Clarkson is good as well protraying Cathy's best friend, a woman in her social circle who shows her true colors at Cathy's time of need. This is an excellent film that I hope lots of people go to see. OVERLOOK the naysayers and negative reviewers here.  Treat yourself to one of the best films of the year so far.

603415,AVV1ACH67XI85,B00005JLQH,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[11, 12]","With 201 reviews online, I am not about to summarize this film. But for those who say they ""hated it,"" it is clear that they have no clue what Todd Haynes was trying to do. It is a very stylized film meant to evoke certain films from the 1950s, and if you watch all the extra features on the DVD, you will understand that is what the goal is. The difference, which makes this film absolutely stone cold brilliant, is that Haynes does what filmmakers in the 1950s could not do: address homosexuality. Anyone who is gay or sensitive to gay people will quickly grasp that many films in the 1950s had ""veiled"" themes, and that some of them could have been gay love stories or had gay themes, had the times allowed. Haynes shows what may have really been going on in the ""Donna Reed"" world of Cathy Whitaker, behind closed doors, so to speak.The acting of the leads and the supporting cast is stellar, and Julianne Moore, in particular, conveys emotions in such an incredible way that it is impossible not to feel connected to her. When she admits to her best friend Eleanor that she feels the only person she can talk to is the black gardener, and that she feels somehow ""alive"" -- you can almost see a woman who has felt true, honest human affection for the first time in her adult life.Other reviews commented on the bad camera shots/angles/what not -- I don't know what they're talking about. It is clear that everything in this film was thought out in minute detail and there was a deep love for the period, for the specific films being emulated, and that even the composer, the brilliant Elmer Bernstein, felt connected to the film, from his mesmerizing score, to his insightful comments that he offers on the DVD.One of the tragedies of being young is not having lived through certain things, and yet making the assumptions that something is dumb, cliche, stupid, or any other sort of bizarre commentary that I have read about this film. I lived in this era, I saw these movies, those colors were in my house, and people said those things -- because movies influence us in ways that we cannot even begin to imagine.This movie is not perfect; there are a couple of scenes, which, if watched too many times, border on the hysterically funny -- but even those have to be considered in light of the whole undertaking, which is absolutely brilliantly conceived.I think that Dennis Quaid, who seemed uncomfortable discussing his part in the DVD extras (maybe he didn't want to give away the ""secret""), was superb. Knowing men from that era, I can recognize the look in his face, and his posture, his clothes, everything about him said ""closet case."" He was fantastic. I find it odd that everyone is making a hysterical big deal out of the male-male kiss in ""Alexander"" -- and yet, look at Dennis -- he went for it. He is totally believable, and when their relationship really starts to fall apart, it's tragic -- two people living a lie, keeping up appearances, for what? This is one of the messages, if there were any, that I got. And the other is where Dennis Haysbert, as the gardener, has a moment with Julianne Moore in front of the theater -- an incredibly honest moment which he says a few things that make so much sense -- and yet, all around them was a world of fear, a white world with white people, all living in some fantasyland that they were the only people in it, and that black people were somehow ""extras"" or ""atmosphere people"" that showed up and did the dirty work, and were then bussed out of town at night.Todd Haynes wanted to express these and other things within the very specific and stylized framework of certain 50s' films, and I think he did so with absolute, total brilliance.",5,Close to Heaven,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,3701,"['201', 'reviews', 'online', 'am', 'not', 'summarize', 'film', 'who', 'say', 'hated', 'clear', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'very', 'stylized', 'film', 'meant', 'evoke', 'certain', 'films', '1950s', 'watch', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'goal', 'difference', 'film', 'absolutely', 'stone', 'cold', 'brilliant', 'Haynes', 'what', 'filmmakers', '1950s', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'address', 'homosexuality', 'Anyone', 'who', 'gay', 'sensitive', 'gay', 'people', 'will', 'quickly', 'grasp', 'many', 'films', '1950s', 'had', 'veiled', 'themes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gay', 'love', 'stories', 'had', 'gay', 'themes', 'had', 'times', 'allowed', 'Haynes', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'going', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'world', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'closed', 'doors', 'so', 'speak.The', 'acting', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'particular', 'conveys', 'emotions', 'such', 'incredible', 'way', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'connected', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'Eleanor', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'talk', 'black', 'gardener', 'somehow', 'alive', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'felt', 'true', 'honest', 'human', 'affection', 'first', 'time', 'adult', 'life.Other', 'reviews', 'commented', 'bad', 'camera', 'shots/angles/what', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'clear', 'everything', 'film', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'minute', 'detail', 'was', 'deep', 'love', 'period', 'specific', 'films', 'being', 'emulated', 'even', 'composer', 'brilliant', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'felt', 'connected', 'film', 'mesmerizing', 'score', 'insightful', 'comments', 'DVD.One', 'tragedies', 'being', 'young', 'not', 'having', 'lived', 'certain', 'things', 'yet', 'making', 'assumptions', 'something', 'dumb', 'cliche', 'stupid', 'other', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'commentary', 'have', 'read', 'film', 'lived', 'era', 'saw', 'movies', 'colors', 'were', 'house', 'people', 'said', 'things', 'movies', 'influence', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'imagine.This', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'border', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'even', 'have', 'be', 'considered', 'light', 'whole', 'undertaking', 'absolutely', 'brilliantly', 'conceived.I', 'think', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'seemed', 'uncomfortable', 'discussing', 'part', 'DVD', 'extras', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'secret', 'was', 'superb', 'Knowing', 'men', 'era', 'can', 'recognize', 'look', 'face', 'posture', 'clothes', 'everything', 'said', 'closet', 'case', 'was', 'fantastic', 'find', 'everyone', 'making', 'hysterical', 'big', 'deal', 'male-male', 'kiss', 'Alexander', 'yet', 'look', 'Dennis', 'went', 'totally', 'believable', 'when', 'relationship', 'really', 'fall', 'apart', 'tragic', 'two', 'people', 'living', 'lie', 'keeping', 'up', 'appearances', 'what', 'one', 'messages', 'were', 'got', 'other', 'where', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'gardener', 'moment', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'front', 'theater', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'moment', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'yet', 'was', 'world', 'fear', 'white', 'world', 'white', 'people', 'living', 'fantasyland', 'were', 'only', 'people', 'black', 'people', 'were', 'somehow', 'extras', 'atmosphere', 'people', 'showed', 'up', 'did', 'dirty', 'work', 'were', 'then', 'bussed', 'town', 'night.Todd', 'Haynes', 'wanted', 'express', 'other', 'things', 'very', 'specific', 'stylized', 'framework', 'certain', '50s', 'films', 'think', 'did', 'so', 'absolute', 'total', 'brilliance']",N/A

603417,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00005JLQH,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","It's obvious that director Todd Haynes used the work of Douglas Sirk as a reference point with ""Far From Heaven"".  It's a homage of Sirk that isn't reduced to parody unlike the work of, say, Brian DePalma and his Hitchcock obsession.  Granted, the film is set in the white picket fence suburban fifties but strip away the beehives and the tailfins there is alot here that can be reflected in contemporary society.  Haynes succeeds in using Sirk as a template but distinguishing himself in the process.  As daring a director that Sirk was he couldn't fully explore certain themes that Haynes has the luxury of.  Where Haynes succeeds best is in his handling of race relations and not just the platonic one between Kathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) and Raymond Deegan (Dennis Haysbert).  Not to diminish the work of Moore and Haysbert because they are excellent here particularly in the heartbreaking final scenes of the movie.  Two scenes come to my mind that put the nature of racism under the microscope.  One is at a cocktail party congregated by ivory tower liberals who make thoughtless comments oblivious to the sensitivities of the African-American servers.  Another is at a swimming pool in Miami Beach where the bathers flee after a young African-American boy unknowingly dangles his feet in the water.  I thought Haynes was a little tentative in exploring homosexuality.  Dennis Quaid is fine as Frank Whitaker whose not so latent homosexuality comes at the most inopportune time but I just didn't feel the character was as fully developed as he might have been.

603418,A1DAOL3NMHEPLS,B00005JLQH,David F. Nolan,"[1, 1]","The photography in &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; is truly wonderful -- carefully staged and lighted shots filmed in DEEP saturated color -- but the movie is hard to accept as a realistic depiction of suburban Connecticut in 1957-58. While Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert offer heartfelt and touching performances, Dennis Quaid is over-the-top most of the time, and the two Whitaker kids are just annoying.  I grew up in that era, and believe me, nobody I knew talked like those kids!It has been suggested that this movie is not intended to be realistic, but instead surreal -- a belated 1950s movie that uses the style and conventions of that era, but address topics (i.e. homosexuality) that would not have been addressed so openly back then. Fair enough, but is it a good movie by today's standards?

603419,A1BFTKKBHIR1BY,B00005JLQH,David G. Smith,"[6, 7]","I would like to believe that somewhere down the line the combo of Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore will be mentioned as one of the stunning collaborations in film.  Haynes is one of the most innovative directors, sometimes saddled to concepts that tend to overshadow the fact that he, like William Wyler, should be directing women's pictures.  And I think an argument can be made for me being one of our most luminescent performers.  This film, shot in the luscious pallete of Douglas Sirk, glows brightly.ok, whatever.  I wanted to try to open this with some sort of stylistic thing.  Some people are satisfied with style over content, and I must admit, if the content is some &quot;I&quot;m out for revenge-my brother got killed by the mob, and by the way, I&quot;m a character played by the Rock&quot; I&quot;m all for setting it in post apocalyptic Vegas as directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Style sometimes makes all the difference....the style of this movie is amazing.  But it is not all.  Haynes tells stories of passion unanswered...people reigned in by conventions, and society.  I believe that the style of this movie helps tell that tale.  We only see glimpses of modern devices.  The film, told in 50's style, cuts away before we see everything.  In this way, the characters are restrained, and our imaginations are set loose.Long ago I heard Ronald Reagan(oh my god, I&quot;m going to agree with Ronald Reagan) say that movies of his era were summed up by a man and a woman going into a room, and the door closed, and you pieced it together in your mind.  This is that sort of movie.  I loved it.And finally, the story is not overtly earthshaking, it is the fifties and we know that interacial love was taboo, as was homosexuality.....but when taken as a symbolic language for the oppression people  still feel, it is a remarkable work.  Moore gives one of the most restrained performances of great depth I have ever seen.  Dennis Quaid, who I often think is a little over the top, works well in this.  Patricia Clarkson is fantastic, as is Dennis Haysbert. The work is fantastic throughout.So this is a unique film where style helps content to the max.

Frank (Dennis Quaid) has issues with his sexuality that are worsened considerably by an out of control drinking problem.  The man leads his life in a reckless manner as if he wants to get into trouble.  The couple, along with their two young children, live in Hartford, Connecticut in the late 1950s.  Their social milieu might be open to modern art, but race and homosexuality are topics best ignored.  Even a casual conversation between a man of color and a white woman is sufficient to encourage considerable gossip.  Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert) is a well educated black man unable to find employment equal to his formal educational level.  He takes over his late father's gardening business and one of his clients is the Whitaker family.  Cathy's marriage is disintegrating and Raymond does not hesitate to offer an arm to lean on.  He is a man of quiet dignity relegated to a second class status by the dominant white establishment.  The latter do not commit violent acts against the blacks living in their city. There are even bars for gay men that are tolerated if they remain hidden from public view.  Still, gay pride and political activism are most certainly not viable options. Minority citizens, however defined, are expected to know their place and abide by behavioral codes that are both tacitly and explicitly restrictive.The whole film revolves around Cathy who readily reminds one of a Stepford wife.  She patiently endures abuse and presents an inauthentic plastic persona to the outside world. Cathy has no life other than being an eager to please wife who causes no problems.  This woman seems unable to take a minute out of her busy day to spend on herself.  There is only one thing that can be said about Cathy's friends: with friends like these folks, who  needs enemies?  She is far too nice and passive.  The feminist revolution is a few years away, and Cathy is definitely not a pioneer ahead of the curve. We almost cease feeling sorry for her and have to fight the urge to get angry at Cathy's punching bag mentality.  Julianne Moore may very well win an Academy Award.  This might be her best work.  Todd Haynes has directed a five star movie.

She has great expression and seems constantly professional in her acting manner.This is a beautifully filmed drama with some outstanding acting. Patricia Clarkson, she plays the best friend Eleanor, is just brilliant in her role as well. She is an underrated actress.The subject matter is of course, scandalous in the era being portrayed. Frank, Dennis Quaid's character and husband of Cathy, is gay.  She finds him, in her quest to bring him a nice home cooked dinner, in his office in the arms of a man...very shocking for the 50's.  She befriends a black man, played by smooth talker, Dennis Haysbert.  He is the son of the gardener she had previously employed.

603431,A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW,B00005JLQH,Eric Anderson,"[95, 107]","The tremendously talented director Todd Haynes, has created an amazing new film called Far From Heaven. It is the 1950s in Hartford, Connecticut. Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) lives in a perfectly lovely house with a perfectly lovely family. She is a respected and envied member of her community, admired for her liberal mind and successful husband. However, as the film progresses we see trouble brewing between husband and wife. Frank Whitaker ( Dennis Quaid) is coming home later in the evenings and his drinking is slipping out of control. Then Cathy, ever the dutiful wife, walks into Frank's office late one night while delivering his dinner and discovers her husband's horrible secret. The occurrence is such a shocking rupture to their peaceful world that they aren't able to summon the language to articulate it. Instead, they try to carry on as if nothing has changed using the most modern psychological methods to deal with it. But it becomes increasingly obvious that this isn't possible despite running away to a peaceful vacation in Miami where Cathy proclaims ""Everything is pink!"" Not least of all because Cathy has befriended her new black gardener (Dennis Haysbert) and the town sure is talking. These characters all struggle to voice their independent needs in a society whose code of conduct is so strict that anything which deviates from it must be swept quickly under the carpet or violently vilified, where ""jiminy cricket"" is considered strong language not to be used in the house.From the moment the camera pans down on this perfect community life, we realise we are looking through the prismatic lens of America's most prominent ideals: happy family, affluent lifestyle, happy home. This film was strongly influenced by the melodramatic 50s films of Douglas Sirk, particularly All That Heaven Allows. Haynes uses colors in a way similar to Sirk that creates sharp contrasts of emotional moods that aren't possible to articulate in the restrained dialogue. Each scene is carefully balanced with soft and hard colors setting the mood. Similarly, the script reflects those melodramas inspired by stories from Ladies Home Journals. The characters are only allowed to speak of things on the surface because of the constraints of their community and are only occasionally given moments to speak in grandiose terms of life's great mystery. Sweeping over this emotional tale is a triumphant score composed by Elmer Bernstein that will remain humming in your mind after the film ends.The actors of this film really contribute to its tremendous success. Dennis Quaid's performance is powerful in conveying his inability to express hidden aspects of his identity as well his complete disregard for Cathy's needs. He is often cloaked in shadow as if striving to disappear from his hated environment. Dennis Haysbert's character is dignified, quietly hopeful that you may do what feels right if you don't pay attention to the sneering gossips. Haysbert conveys this wonderfully and makes our hearts break when his dignity is eclipsed by fear once serious danger arrives on his doorstep. Equally strong are smaller roles performed movingly by actors like Bette Henritze and young Jordan Puryear. Most prominently, the film is carried along beautifully by its center, Julianne Moore. She gives tremendous dignity to this female character who in her own way is trying to understand and define her desires amidst a maelstrom of public scrutiny. She trembles in the face of prejudice, anger and hate, but never crumbles. Unlike her husband, who wildly abandons the needs of everyone but himself, Cathy must keep up the house and uphold appearances. It would be easy for Moore to deliver this in a knowing self-conscious manner like parody, but we never see more than the utmost sincerity. Her performance is worthy of many awards.One might ask why Haynes felt it necessary to dredge up this outmoded film style now. The answer he has given to this is that it conveys aspects of our society that aren't possible in modern, straightforward films. He says that the ""issues"" raised in this film are still evident in our 2002 society in different forms, but remain unresolved nonetheless. The primary accomplishment of this film is the way it raises issues from different marginal groups of American society, revealing that most commonly women's needs are almost always placed last. No one meaning breaks to the forefront of your understanding of the film though. It is most definitely not playful pastiche. Perhaps the style of it is intended to just hold up our ideals to the light, like a piece of fine crystal to illuminate all the cracks and magnificent colors.",5,Important and Emotionally Compelling,1037664000,"11 19, 2002",2002,4671,"['tremendously', 'talented', 'director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'created', 'amazing', 'new', 'film', 'called', 'Far', 'Heaven', '1950s', 'Hartford', 'Connecticut', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'perfectly', 'lovely', 'house', 'perfectly', 'lovely', 'family', 'respected', 'envied', 'member', 'community', 'admired', 'liberal', 'mind', 'successful', 'husband', 'However', 'film', 'see', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'husband', 'wife', 'Frank', 'Whitaker', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'coming', 'home', 'later', 'evenings', 'drinking', 'slipping', 'control', 'Then', 'Cathy', 'ever', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'walks', 'Frank', 'office', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'delivering', 'dinner', 'husband', 'horrible', 'secret', 'occurrence', 'such', 'shocking', 'rupture', 'peaceful', 'world', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'summon', 'language', 'articulate', 'Instead', 'try', 'carry', 'nothing', 'changed', 'using', 'most', 'modern', 'psychological', 'methods', 'deal', 'increasingly', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'possible', 'running', 'away', 'peaceful', 'vacation', 'Miami', 'where', 'Cathy', 'Everything', 'pink', 'Not', 'least', 'Cathy', 'befriended', 'new', 'black', 'gardener', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'town', 'sure', 'talking', 'characters', 'struggle', 'voice', 'independent', 'needs', 'society', 'code', 'conduct', 'so', 'strict', 'anything', 'must', 'be', 'swept', 'quickly', 'carpet', 'violently', 'vilified', 'where', 'jiminy', 'cricket', 'considered', 'strong', 'language', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'house.From', 'moment', 'camera', 'down', 'perfect', 'community', 'life', 'realise', 'are', 'looking', 'prismatic', 'lens', 'America', 'most', 'prominent', 'ideals', 'happy', 'family', 'affluent', 'lifestyle', 'happy', 'home', 'film', 'was', 'strongly', 'influenced', 'melodramatic', '50s', 'films', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'particularly', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'Haynes', 'colors', 'way', 'similar', 'Sirk', 'sharp', 'contrasts', 'emotional', 'moods', 'are', ""n't"", 'possible', 'articulate', 'restrained', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'soft', 'hard', 'colors', 'setting', 'mood', 'Similarly', 'script', 'melodramas', 'inspired', 'stories', 'Ladies', 'Home', 'Journals', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'allowed', 'speak', 'things', 'surface', 'constraints', 'community', 'are', 'only', 'occasionally', 'given', 'moments', 'speak', 'grandiose', 'terms', 'life', 'great', 'mystery', 'Sweeping', 'emotional', 'tale', 'triumphant', 'score', 'composed', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'will', 'remain', 'humming', 'mind', 'film', 'ends.The', 'actors', 'film', 'really', 'contribute', 'tremendous', 'success', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'powerful', 'conveying', 'inability', 'express', 'hidden', 'aspects', 'identity', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'disregard', 'Cathy', 'needs', 'often', 'cloaked', 'shadow', 'striving', 'disappear', 'hated', 'environment', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'character', 'dignified', 'quietly', 'may', 'do', 'what', 'feels', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'sneering', 'gossips', 'Haysbert', 'conveys', 'wonderfully', 'hearts', 'break', 'when', 'dignity', 'eclipsed', 'fear', 'once', 'serious', 'danger', 'doorstep', 'Equally', 'strong', 'are', 'smaller', 'roles', 'performed', 'movingly', 'actors', 'Bette', 'Henritze', 'young', 'Jordan', 'Puryear', 'Most', 'prominently', 'film', 'carried', 'beautifully', 'center', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'tremendous', 'dignity', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'own', 'way', 'trying', 'understand', 'define', 'desires', 'amidst', 'maelstrom', 'public', 'scrutiny', 'face', 'prejudice', 'anger', 'hate', 'never', 'crumbles', 'husband', 'who', 'wildly', 'needs', 'everyone', 'Cathy', 'must', 'keep', 'house', 'uphold', 'appearances', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'Moore', 'deliver', 'knowing', 'self-conscious', 'manner', 'parody', 'never', 'see', 'more', 'utmost', 'sincerity', 'performance', 'worthy', 'many', 'awards.One', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'Haynes', 'felt', 'necessary', 'dredge', 'up', 'outmoded', 'film', 'style', 'now', 'answer', 'given', 'aspects', 'society', 'are', ""n't"", 'possible', 'modern', 'straightforward', 'films', 'issues', 'raised', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'evident', '2002', 'society', 'different', 'forms', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'nonetheless', 'primary', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'way', 'issues', 'different', 'marginal', 'groups', 'American', 'society', 'revealing', 'most', 'commonly', 'women', 'needs', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'placed', 'last', 'one', 'meaning', 'breaks', 'forefront', 'understanding', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'playful', 'pastiche', 'Perhaps', 'style', 'intended', 'just', 'hold', 'up', 'ideals', 'light', 'piece', 'fine', 'crystal', 'illuminate', 'cracks', 'magnificent', 'colors']",N/A

I tried viewing it again, and, I hated it even more the second time, and I hated myself for again exposing myself to this parade of costumes and authentic vintage set design. There is no artistry in this film, no empathy, just an abundance of concern for recreating the &quot;look&quot; of those famous fifties melodramas. This it accomplishes. Whoop-de-doo.

603435,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JLQH,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[125, 134]","With FAR FROM HEAVEN, writer-director Todd Haynes meticulously recreates the look and conventions of 1950s ""domestic drama""--and then subverts it. Like all domestic drama heroines, Cathy Whittaker (Julianne Moore) is a glamorous woman, and the film finds her married to Frank (Dennis Quaid), a rising executive in television sales. They are the perfect 1950s family: they are upwardly mobile, have two children (a boy and a girl, of course), live in an expensive home in an expensive residential district. One evening, Cathy unexpectedly opens a door--and discovers that Frank is unfaithful to her.If this were a Douglas Sirk film starring Lana Turner, Cathy would have found Frank in the arms of another woman and done battle with her to save her marriage. But Frank is in the arms of another man, something that falls completely outside Cathy's frame of reference. Desperate to save her marriage, she encourages Frank to see a psychiatrist; unable to confide in her friends lest she provoke a scandal, she finds solace in the company of her gardener. But he is black--and when their largely innocent friendship is discovered it provokes the very scandal she feared.The themes of homosexuality and racism are merely the most obvious way in which Haynes subverts the genre. More interestingly, Haynes essentially presents us with characters trapped between the stereotypes of 1950s domestic drama and hard reality, and the result is often quite surreal. Time and again the characters respond to harsh reality by resorting to the high-flown dialogue and awkward dollops of social consciousness typical of the genre--and time and again the nature of the film works to highlight how ridiculously unnatural this response is. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly claustrophobic in feel, and while none can deny that it is homage in form, it becomes metaphor in fact, satirizing and condemning both the artificial social codes of the past and present. Moreover, it works to undercut our selective memory of the 1950s, which we prefer to recall as ""Happy Days"" but which saw the House Un-American Committee, The Cold War, and the beginnings of everything from racial integration, the gay rights movement, and feminism--and in the face of such issues role models like Lana Turner in her evening gown and Donna Reed with her pearls crack and shatter.The cast is superlative here. Julianne Moore, whose career has been building for the past several years, clearly demonstrates that she is now in the same league with the greatest screen actresses of her generation, playing the role of Cathy Whittaker on so many levels that it has the effect of an emotional Rubik's Cube. Dennis Quaid, best known for playing mischievously macho ""bad boy"" characters, gives an extremely unexpected and highly charged performance as husband Frank, and both are excellently supported. The script captures every grotesque nuance of the 1950s domestic drama while neatly undermining it at every turn, and the production staff has done a remarkable job of recreating the visual style involved. The cinematography and score are incredibly beautiful, and the director's approach to the project is less homage than it is critical evaluation of those who enjoy such artificial constructs both then and now, both on the screen and off. It is an extraordinary feat, and quite possibly one of the best movies of the past ten years. The DVD package is quite interesting, with three solid documentaries and a good director's commentary.FAR FROM HEAVEN will not be to every one's taste, not by a long shot. Many who liked the 1950s ""domestic drama"" genre--and many who don't--will not be able to make the leap of perception that Haynes requires, won't be able to shift gears to look at the work with the objectivity necessary. But it is powerful stuff, and I recommend it all the same.--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--",5,A Cosmetic Facade Cracked by Ugly Realtiy,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,3880,"['FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'writer-director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'meticulously', 'look', 'conventions', '1950s', 'domestic', 'drama', 'then', 'domestic', 'drama', 'heroines', 'Cathy', 'Whittaker', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'glamorous', 'woman', 'film', 'married', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'rising', 'executive', 'television', 'sales', 'are', 'perfect', '1950s', 'family', 'are', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'boy', 'girl', 'course', 'live', 'expensive', 'home', 'expensive', 'residential', 'district', 'One', 'evening', 'Cathy', 'unexpectedly', 'door', 'discovers', 'Frank', 'unfaithful', 'her.If', 'were', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'film', 'starring', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Cathy', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'Frank', 'arms', 'woman', 'done', 'battle', 'save', 'marriage', 'Frank', 'arms', 'man', 'something', 'completely', 'outside', 'Cathy', 'frame', 'reference', 'Desperate', 'save', 'marriage', 'Frank', 'see', 'psychiatrist', 'unable', 'confide', 'friends', 'lest', 'provoke', 'scandal', 'solace', 'company', 'gardener', 'black', 'when', 'largely', 'innocent', 'friendship', 'discovered', 'very', 'scandal', 'feared.The', 'themes', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'are', 'merely', 'most', 'obvious', 'way', 'Haynes', 'genre', 'More', 'interestingly', 'Haynes', 'essentially', 'characters', 'trapped', 'stereotypes', '1950s', 'domestic', 'drama', 'hard', 'reality', 'result', 'often', 'quite', 'surreal', 'Time', 'again', 'characters', 'respond', 'harsh', 'reality', 'resorting', 'high-flown', 'dialogue', 'awkward', 'dollops', 'social', 'consciousness', 'typical', 'genre', 'time', 'again', 'nature', 'film', 'highlight', 'how', 'ridiculously', 'unnatural', 'response', 'film', 'increasingly', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'none', 'can', 'deny', 'homage', 'form', 'metaphor', 'fact', 'satirizing', 'condemning', 'artificial', 'social', 'codes', 'past', 'present', 'Moreover', 'undercut', 'selective', 'memory', '1950s', 'prefer', 'recall', 'Happy', 'Days', 'saw', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Committee', 'Cold', 'War', 'beginnings', 'everything', 'racial', 'integration', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'feminism', 'face', 'such', 'issues', 'role', 'models', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'evening', 'gown', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'pearls', 'crack', 'shatter.The', 'cast', 'superlative', 'here', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'career', 'been', 'building', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'clearly', 'now', 'same', 'league', 'greatest', 'screen', 'actresses', 'generation', 'playing', 'role', 'Cathy', 'Whittaker', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'effect', 'emotional', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'mischievously', 'macho', 'bad', 'boy', 'characters', 'extremely', 'unexpected', 'highly', 'charged', 'performance', 'husband', 'Frank', 'are', 'excellently', 'supported', 'script', 'grotesque', 'nuance', '1950s', 'domestic', 'drama', 'neatly', 'undermining', 'turn', 'production', 'staff', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'recreating', 'visual', 'style', 'involved', 'cinematography', 'score', 'are', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'director', 'approach', 'project', 'less', 'homage', 'critical', 'evaluation', 'who', 'enjoy', 'such', 'artificial', 'constructs', 'then', 'now', 'screen', 'extraordinary', 'feat', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'DVD', 'package', 'quite', 'interesting', 'three', 'solid', 'documentaries', 'good', 'director', 'commentary.FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'taste', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'Many', 'who', 'liked', '1950s', 'domestic', 'drama', 'genre', 'many', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'leap', 'perception', 'Haynes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'shift', 'gears', 'look', 'work', 'objectivity', 'necessary', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'recommend', 'same.', 'GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

My wife and I saw this movie last week and thought it was as good as any movie we've seen this year. To dismiss the movie as postmodern sophism on the part of Haynes, is to miss the point of the movie entirely. We have seen quite a few movies (David Lynch and John Waters come to mind) that portray the Eisenhower years with a great deal of irony and that it is an easy task. Haynes resists camping it up and instead presents a heartfelt meditation on the nature of love, breaking social taboos and ultimately the price one pays for following their heart. Not since Bodonovich's ""Last Picture Show"", have we gotten such a photo-realistic examination of life in the fifties. ""Far From Heaven"" may possess the same social values as Water's ""Hairspray"" but Haynes resistance to using campy stereotypes is what makes this movie so powerful.The three principal actors Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid and Dennis Haysbert all turn in compelling performances. Julianne Moore's nuanced performance as a housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown should earn her an well deserved Oscar nomination. Dennis Quaid's fallen ""golden boy"" who discovers his own homosexuality and responds to it with self hatred and binge drinking is riveting. Dennis Haysbert's understated and sensitive performance as the black gardener shows us that all black movie roles don't have to be portrayed with overstated histronics. Haysbert, like Denzel Washington, refuses to resort to a stereotypical ""black"" performance.Seeing ""Far From Heaven"" made me remember that we are still grappling with many of these social issues nearly 50 years later. Many will see Hayne's treatment of racism, homosexuality and domestic violence as oversimplified, however if these issues are so ""simple"" why do they still persist as significant social problems in 2002?

603438,AH39OFADI4W11,B00005JLQH,Granten Lee,"[3, 4]","The 1950s were a truly amazing time for America.  The decade is remembereed with fond memories of pop culture: I love it that gentlemen still wore hats, suits and ties even to ballgames and ladies daily wore beautiful dresses with big skirts, complimented by a gloves, a pearl necklace and high heels.  Coca-Cola came in beautifully sculpted glass bottles.  Elvis.  We liked Ike and still trusted our leaders.  Cars were works of art and gasoline was so cheap you could drive for a month for what you pay for one gallon today.  The milkman still came to your front door.  Baseball alone was the national pastime and the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn... at least for most of the decade.  The evening news wasn't fraught with stories of terrorism and senseless crimes.  I saw a Time-Life book on the '50s once and on the cover was a little girl in pigtails and a dress skipping rope, with no adults in sight.  That single image evokes the confidence and security America felt during that time... if a little girl could be safe, who couldn't be?Unfortunately, the 1950s- nor any time- was really as idealistic as we would like to think it was.  I don't just mean the threats of nuclear war... the 1950s were not a kind time to African-Americans and others who didn't fit into the mainstream.  Few people would dare to live an openly homosexual lifestyle.  There is a reason you never saw black people on Lucy, Ozzie & Harriet or Leave it to Beaver... it was about creating a fictional world where these people simply did not exist.Far From Heaven is a movie that tries to reconcile our image of the 1950s with our 20/20 hindsight of racial and lifestyle prejudices.  The film is actually Director Todd Haynes' tribute to Director Douglas Sirk's filmmaking style; only Haynes made the film Sirk could have never made 50 years ago.As Frank Whittaker (Dennis Quaid) struggles with his homosexuality and his wife Cathy (Julianne Moore) befriends and then falls in love with a black man (Dennis Haysbert), it is an interesting question: what do we have a harder time accepting?  Homsexuality among our own particular ethnic group, or an interracial relationship between a black man and a white woman?  One of the most interesting scenes in answer to this question is when Frank explodes in an alcoholic rage at Cathy after the ""scandal"" of her socializing with Raymond Deagan (Haysbert) has been made public by gossips.  His own wife caught him red-handed with another man and was still willing to forgive and accept him, but her friendship with Raymond was unspeaskable and out of the question.Watch this film with someone else so that you can discuss it afterwards.  And remember, it's not an attack on the cherished 1950s; just a more authentic look at the ""Golden Era.""",5,"Far From ""Happy Days""",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2766,"['1950s', 'were', 'truly', 'amazing', 'time', 'America', 'decade', 'remembereed', 'fond', 'memories', 'pop', 'culture', 'love', 'gentlemen', 'still', 'wore', 'hats', 'suits', 'ties', 'even', 'ballgames', 'ladies', 'daily', 'wore', 'beautiful', 'dresses', 'big', 'skirts', 'complimented', 'gloves', 'pearl', 'necklace', 'high', 'heels', 'Coca-Cola', 'came', 'beautifully', 'sculpted', 'glass', 'bottles', 'Elvis', 'liked', 'Ike', 'still', 'trusted', 'leaders', 'Cars', 'were', 'works', 'art', 'gasoline', 'was', 'so', 'cheap', 'could', 'drive', 'month', 'what', 'pay', 'one', 'gallon', 'today', 'milkman', 'still', 'came', 'front', 'door', 'Baseball', 'alone', 'was', 'national', 'pastime', 'Dodgers', 'were', 'still', 'Brooklyn', 'least', 'most', 'decade', 'evening', 'news', 'was', ""n't"", 'fraught', 'stories', 'terrorism', 'senseless', 'crimes', 'saw', 'Time-Life', 'book', ""'50s"", 'once', 'cover', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'pigtails', 'dress', 'skipping', 'rope', 'adults', 'sight', 'single', 'image', 'confidence', 'security', 'America', 'felt', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'safe', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'Unfortunately', '1950s-', 'time-', 'was', 'really', 'as', 'idealistic', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'threats', 'nuclear', 'war', '1950s', 'were', 'not', 'kind', 'time', 'African-Americans', 'others', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mainstream', 'Few', 'people', 'would', 'dare', 'live', 'openly', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'reason', 'never', 'saw', 'black', 'people', 'Lucy', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'was', 'creating', 'fictional', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'exist.Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'movie', 'reconcile', 'image', '1950s', '20/20', 'hindsight', 'racial', 'lifestyle', 'prejudices', 'film', 'actually', 'Director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'tribute', 'Director', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'Sirk', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'made', '50', 'years', 'ago.As', 'Frank', 'Whittaker', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'homosexuality', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'befriends', 'then', 'love', 'black', 'man', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'interesting', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'harder', 'time', 'accepting', 'Homsexuality', 'own', 'particular', 'ethnic', 'group', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'woman', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'answer', 'question', 'when', 'Frank', 'alcoholic', 'rage', 'Cathy', 'scandal', 'socializing', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'Haysbert', 'been', 'made', 'public', 'gossips', 'own', 'wife', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'man', 'was', 'still', 'willing', 'forgive', 'accept', 'friendship', 'Raymond', 'was', 'unspeaskable', 'question.Watch', 'film', 'someone', 'else', 'so', 'can', 'discuss', 'afterwards', 'remember', 'not', 'attack', 'cherished', '1950s', 'just', 'more', 'authentic', 'look', 'Golden', 'Era']",N/A
603439,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00005JLQH,guillermoj,"[0, 0]","Although I did not get around to seeing this movie when it was originally released, it has been almost universally praised so I gave it a shot. As usual I did not get into the details of the reviews that I scanned before seeing it as I don't to know too much about it so that I can judge it based on my own perspective. After seeing most movies that, I do go back to read the finer points of several reviews to bring the experience full circle. While not the masterpiece that some of the best known reviewers have made it out to be, it is certainly not the absolute polar opposite than some reviewers here (one of my very favorite sites due to the democratic nature of the sum of the ratings) have made it out to be.One major quibble before going on with my review. For some reason almost every single review told the ENTIRE STORY and more than ever I was happy that I read them after seeing this movie. Even reviewers who make it a point not to give too much away, failed miserably as it is possible to introduce and review a movie without giving everything away. Here are my two cents.To me this movie faithfully represents and looks like one of the best movies of 1957. This is not a back-handed complement as it never introduces the wink, wink, nudge, nudge irony that has been done to death in almost every genre in recent pictures. When I say one of the best movies of 1957, it say it because it not only convinces you that it is a 1957 social melodrama yet takes it a little further than those actually being made at the time.I am not giving too much away by revealing that the movie centers around an ideal white-upper middle class suburban family from the 1950's, where not everything is like it appears to be. Behind the perfect house, effortless parties, ordinary kids who are constantly reminded to mind their manners, great friends, we soon will learn that the parents of this household are living in very different worlds and things will never be the same after they move beyond the written, and unwritten, expectations that society had and continues to have (albeit to a different degree) with regard to racism, homophobia, the role of women, men, and even children.The ideal parents in this perfect family are expertly played by Julianne Moore (one of the very best working actresses in the business and very much earned her Oscar nod) and Dennis Quaid. Their roles are very difficult because in every single scene there is the possibility of them falling flat on their faces by over-emoting or being too droll to cause any reaction to what would be explosive material even today. Almost every supporting player, especially Patricia Clarkson and Viola Davis, is exceptional. The one exception for me is Dennis Haysbert who is always a strong presence, but he gets the almost impossible task of bringing to life a character that is almost not human and simply too perfect to be true. I kept seeing a somewhat kinder &quot;President Palmer&quot; as played by Haysbert in the hit series titled &quot;24.&quot;The movie accurately reflects the values of the 1950s (and risking beating a dead horse, very much alive even in the 2000s) and looks at the downside of what is an era when life seemed so much simpler largely because of ""family values"". Maybe for some, but if you were not white/male/heterosexual/or even simply a personal who acted in accordance with beliefs, things were even worse than they are today. Recent events in the US, lead me to believe that were a coming full circle as having an opinion can literally have worse consequences than it may have in the 1950s.Although I enjoyed many aspects of the movie and would recommend it if only for the amazing cinematography, acting, and originality, the movie does not pack the punch that it could have had the script focused a little more of how people really spoke in the 1950's and not how they sounded on TV and in the movies. I understand that this movie was an homage to some of the ""women's pictures"" of the era, but the writer/director would no have been any less faithful to the genre if he had taken even further what those movies only hinted at, and this one stretches to a certain degree. This movie would have hit a homerun if it had not only addressed some core issues with every perfect TV/movie family of the era, but also went behind closed doors and tried to look behind closed doors to create an entirely full picture of not only the gloss of the era, but those details that humanize all characters.Unlike most, I think that this movie deserves 3 and like I said at the beginning it's neither the mess that some believe this movie to be, but it is not anywhere is good as critics made it out to be. I am upping the grade to almost 4 only due to Julianne Moore's challenging performance.",3,An ambitious and original movie that almost earns 4 stars.,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,4779,"['did', 'not', 'get', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'been', 'almost', 'universally', 'praised', 'so', 'gave', 'shot', 'usual', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'details', 'reviews', 'scanned', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'judge', 'based', 'own', 'perspective', 'seeing', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'finer', 'points', 'several', 'reviews', 'bring', 'experience', 'full', 'circle', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'best', 'known', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'certainly', 'not', 'absolute', 'polar', 'opposite', 'reviewers', 'here', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'sites', 'due', 'democratic', 'nature', 'sum', 'ratings', 'have', 'made', 'be.One', 'major', 'quibble', 'going', 'review', 'reason', 'almost', 'single', 'review', 'told', 'ENTIRE', 'STORY', 'more', 'ever', 'was', 'happy', 'read', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Even', 'reviewers', 'who', 'make', 'point', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'failed', 'miserably', 'possible', 'introduce', 'review', 'movie', 'giving', 'everything', 'away', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'cents.To', 'movie', 'faithfully', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1957', 'not', 'back-handed', 'complement', 'never', 'wink', 'wink', 'nudge', 'nudge', 'irony', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'almost', 'genre', 'recent', 'pictures', 'When', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1957', 'say', 'not', 'only', '1957', 'social', 'melodrama', 'yet', 'little', 'further', 'actually', 'being', 'made', 'time.I', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'revealing', 'movie', 'centers', 'ideal', 'white-upper', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'family', '1950', 'where', 'not', 'everything', 'be', 'perfect', 'house', 'effortless', 'parties', 'ordinary', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'mind', 'manners', 'great', 'friends', 'soon', 'will', 'learn', 'parents', 'household', 'are', 'living', 'very', 'different', 'worlds', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'move', 'written', 'unwritten', 'expectations', 'society', 'had', 'have', 'albeit', 'different', 'degree', 'regard', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'role', 'women', 'men', 'even', 'children.The', 'ideal', 'parents', 'perfect', 'family', 'are', 'expertly', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'working', 'actresses', 'business', 'very', 'much', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'single', 'scene', 'possibility', 'falling', 'flat', 'over-emoting', 'being', 'too', 'droll', 'cause', 'reaction', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'explosive', 'material', 'even', 'today', 'supporting', 'player', 'especially', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'exceptional', 'one', 'exception', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'always', 'strong', 'presence', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'bringing', 'life', 'character', 'almost', 'not', 'human', 'simply', 'too', 'perfect', 'be', 'true', 'kept', 'seeing', 'somewhat', 'kinder', 'quot', 'President', 'Palmer', 'quot', 'played', 'Haysbert', 'hit', 'series', 'titled', 'quot', '24.', 'quot', 'movie', 'accurately', 'values', '1950s', 'risking', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'even', '2000s', 'downside', 'what', 'era', 'when', 'life', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'simpler', 'largely', 'family', 'values', 'Maybe', 'were', 'not', 'white/male/heterosexual/or', 'even', 'simply', 'personal', 'who', 'acted', 'accordance', 'beliefs', 'things', 'were', 'even', 'worse', 'are', 'today', 'Recent', 'events', 'US', 'lead', 'believe', 'were', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'having', 'opinion', 'can', 'literally', 'have', 'worse', 'consequences', 'may', 'have', '1950s.Although', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'aspects', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'originality', 'movie', 'not', 'pack', 'punch', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'script', 'focused', 'little', 'more', 'how', 'people', 'really', 'spoke', '1950', 'not', 'how', 'sounded', 'TV', 'movies', 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'homage', 'women', 'pictures', 'era', 'writer/director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'faithful', 'genre', 'had', 'taken', 'even', 'further', 'what', 'movies', 'only', 'hinted', 'one', 'certain', 'degree', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'homerun', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'addressed', 'core', 'issues', 'perfect', 'TV/movie', 'family', 'era', 'also', 'went', 'closed', 'doors', 'tried', 'look', 'closed', 'doors', 'create', 'entirely', 'full', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'gloss', 'era', 'details', 'humanize', 'characters.Unlike', 'most', 'think', 'movie', '3', 'said', 'beginning', 'mess', 'believe', 'movie', 'be', 'not', 'anywhere', 'good', 'critics', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'am', 'upping', 'grade', 'almost', '4', 'only', 'due', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'challenging', 'performance']",N/A

Connecticut.Set in the fifties, Julianne Moore discovers the hidden secret sexual of his husband. The visual effects and the lights game are exquisite when she talks with him in the hall. The camera is not over them, but it gets far, in a obvious signal of discrete sense of intimity.Haynes has surprised me in a positive way. The handle of the camera is elegant, fluid and never abuses about the close takes and either the close up.The natural landscape is superbly photographed; and the story is told organical without any hole, with clever clues you slowly are discovering and finding all the details.His style reminds me the influence of two great directors,the first one obviously is Douglas Sirk and the other one is Joseph Losey. The script is built following the classical structure of the soap melodrama, but its flowness and the articulation of smart secondary themes avoids falling that road.The camera shows no mercy with the double moral in that neighborhood. The envy and bitter sights falls under the raising relationship with her gardener. Once more the racism phantom rises as a veil that surrounds and warns her friends.Remember the explicit sequence in the modern art musseum.But the most remarkable aspect from this film is the way is told.

603445,A5ZJFVV0564T6,B00005JLQH,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[10, 18]","In the 1950s, Universal International produced a series of highly successful, glossy, melodramatic films directed by German-born Douglas Sirk. Lushly produced, these films breathed new life into the careers of aging glamour queens and presented some pretty serious social issues to audiences, under the guise of &quot;entertainment.&quot; &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; dealt with an older woman/younger man relationship and the malicious gossip it bred. &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; dealt with irresponsibility, alcoholism, impotence, sibling hatred, and their destructive effects, and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; dealt with the &quot;race&quot; issue and troubled parent/child relationships. Subversive in retrospect, these films proved themselves to be more than just &quot;glossy trash.&quot; They entertained you. In fact, they sometimes made you weep.Having read the rave reviews of Todd Haynes' &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; and the obvious comparison to the Sirk melodramas, I was anxious to see the film. &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, in my opinion, isn't a &quot;bad&quot; film, but it's really not &quot;great&quot; either. In fact, I found it to be somewhat flat, uninvolving, and downright gutless. Director Haynes certainly did his homework on the overall &quot;look&quot; of Sirk's films, such as the lush Technicolor photography, handsome production design, costumes, and schmaltzy Elmer Bernstein score, but the film is essentially cold and bloodless.  Set in ultra-WASPy Connecticut in the 1950s, &quot;Perfect Wife&quot; Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore, wearing a truly terrible wig), bringing some dinner to hubby Frank, played by Dennis Quaid (he's working late at the office), discovers him in a passionate embrace with another man. Her reaction? She turns on her heels and leaves, somewhat zombified, and proceeds through the film like Donna Reed on Miltowns (1950s tranquilizers). She talks to her black gardener Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert), and they become friends. Shocking stuff for 1950s Connecticut. The gossip circulates, Raymond's young daughter is harassed and assaulted by bratty white boys, Cathy and Frank eventually separate (no, he isn't &quot;cured&quot;, and ends up with a MUCH younger man, excuse me, more like a boy), and Cathy and Raymond's friendship comes to an end, too. It seems that Raymond's friendship with Cathy has caused him to be shunned by the other black citizens, and he and his daughter relocate to Baltimore. End of film.  Now this would sound like a dramatic and moving story, right? Under Haynes' direction, it becomes a plodding, lackluster cartoon. The performers are certainly competent, but given their inane dialogue (it's too flat and banal to be even slyly satirical) and seemingly nonexistent direction, they really don't elicit much from the viewer, except maybe a desire to kick them. Julianne Moore is a good actress, but in this film, she doesn't act merely &quot;naive&quot;, she's downright goofy! I don't think that any woman, no matter how &quot;sheltered&quot;, would be that passive and complacent, unless she were brain damaged. Dennis Quaid's chickenhawk soon-to-be-ex-husband doesn't really elicit too much sympathy, either. (Are we supposed to feel &quot;big things&quot; for these Ward and June Cleaver paper dolls?) I think the main problem with &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; lies in its too self-conscious &quot;craftiness&quot; to be emotionally involving, more concerned with appearances (which, I suppose, is true to the characters), but it doesn't really scratch beneath the shiny linoleum kitchen floor surface to reveal the dirt underneath. Haynes' direction timidly approaches these &quot;taboo&quot; subjects, then cautiously steps back again, creating barely a ruffle in its cinematic crinoline skirt. At least in Sirk's films there was SOME confrontation! Recreating the look of a 1950s &quot;women's picture&quot; is a fun exercise. Drawing an audience in and moving them (isn't that what &quot;drama&quot; is?) is a much more difficult task, and this film never quite hits the mark.  Essentially, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; is a pretty-looking, rather forgettable film that's all dressed up with no place to go.",2,All That Magnificent Imitation of Written on the Wind Allows,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,4218,"['1950s', 'Universal', 'International', 'produced', 'series', 'highly', 'successful', 'glossy', 'melodramatic', 'films', 'directed', 'German-born', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Lushly', 'produced', 'films', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'careers', 'aging', 'glamour', 'queens', 'presented', 'pretty', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'audiences', 'guise', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'quot', 'dealt', 'older', 'woman/younger', 'man', 'relationship', 'malicious', 'gossip', 'bred', 'quot', 'Written', 'Wind', 'quot', 'dealt', 'irresponsibility', 'alcoholism', 'impotence', 'sibling', 'hatred', 'destructive', 'effects', 'quot', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'quot', 'dealt', 'quot', 'race', 'quot', 'issue', 'troubled', 'parent/child', 'relationships', 'Subversive', 'retrospect', 'films', 'proved', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'quot', 'glossy', 'trash.', 'quot', 'entertained', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'made', 'weep.Having', 'read', 'rave', 'reviews', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Sirk', 'melodramas', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'film', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'quot', 'great', 'quot', 'fact', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'uninvolving', 'downright', 'gutless', 'Director', 'Haynes', 'certainly', 'did', 'homework', 'overall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sirk', 'films', 'such', 'lush', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'handsome', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'schmaltzy', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'film', 'essentially', 'cold', 'bloodless', 'Set', 'ultra-WASPy', 'Connecticut', '1950s', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Wife', 'quot', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wearing', 'truly', 'terrible', 'wig', 'bringing', 'dinner', 'hubby', 'Frank', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'working', 'late', 'office', 'passionate', 'embrace', 'man', 'reaction', 'heels', 'leaves', 'somewhat', 'zombified', 'proceeds', 'film', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Miltowns', '1950s', 'tranquilizers', 'black', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'become', 'friends', 'Shocking', 'stuff', '1950s', 'Connecticut', 'gossip', 'circulates', 'Raymond', 'young', 'daughter', 'harassed', 'assaulted', 'bratty', 'white', 'boys', 'Cathy', 'Frank', 'eventually', 'separate', ""n't"", 'quot', 'cured', 'quot', 'up', 'MUCH', 'younger', 'man', 'more', 'boy', 'Cathy', 'Raymond', 'friendship', 'end', 'too', 'Raymond', 'friendship', 'Cathy', 'caused', 'be', 'shunned', 'other', 'black', 'citizens', 'daughter', 'relocate', 'Baltimore', 'End', 'film', 'Now', 'would', 'sound', 'dramatic', 'moving', 'story', 'right', 'Haynes', 'direction', 'plodding', 'lackluster', 'cartoon', 'performers', 'are', 'certainly', 'competent', 'given', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'too', 'flat', 'banal', 'be', 'even', 'slyly', 'satirical', 'seemingly', 'nonexistent', 'direction', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'elicit', 'much', 'viewer', 'maybe', 'desire', 'kick', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'good', 'actress', 'film', ""n't"", 'act', 'merely', 'quot', 'naive', 'quot', 'downright', 'goofy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'woman', 'matter', 'how', 'quot', 'sheltered', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'passive', 'complacent', 'were', 'brain', 'damaged', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'chickenhawk', 'soon-to-be-ex-husband', ""n't"", 'really', 'elicit', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'either', 'supposed', 'feel', 'quot', 'big', 'things', 'quot', 'Ward', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'paper', 'dolls', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'quot', 'craftiness', 'quot', 'be', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'more', 'concerned', 'appearances', 'suppose', 'true', 'characters', ""n't"", 'really', 'scratch', 'shiny', 'linoleum', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'surface', 'reveal', 'dirt', 'underneath', 'Haynes', 'direction', 'timidly', 'quot', 'quot', 'subjects', 'then', 'cautiously', 'back', 'again', 'creating', 'barely', 'ruffle', 'cinematic', 'crinoline', 'skirt', 'least', 'Sirk', 'films', 'was', 'SOME', 'confrontation', 'Recreating', 'look', '1950s', 'quot', 'women', 'picture', 'quot', 'fun', 'exercise', 'Drawing', 'audience', 'moving', ""n't"", 'what', 'quot', 'drama', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'task', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'mark', 'Essentially', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'pretty-looking', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'film', 'dressed', 'up', 'place', 'go']",N/A
603446,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005JLQH,James Hiller,"[9, 10]","Stylish, surprisingly modern, this 50's style film unites many big themes as they roll through the landscape of Hartford suburbia in the film, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;.Todd Haynes recreates the somewhat dullish, over dramatic style of 50's melodramas with a well thought out, dynamic script that manages to tackle issues so relevant to today. Things are never what they seem from the outside, as his characters play pretend okay while their inner lives are being shattered at every turn. It's daring to allow them the full course of their emotions, all the while repressing them every chance they get. It's the dichotomy that drives this film, ever so successfully.Rest assured, Julianne Moore gives the perfomance of a lifetime in the role of Cathy Whittaker. Every bit the proper, refined housewife, Julianne manages to take a role that could very easily be overacted, and gives her dignity and control and a sense of vulnerability all at the same time. Her range and skill as a performer leads me to see films that she is in simply because she is in them, and I cannot say that about many other actors. Dennis Quaid and Patricia Clarkson also wallop their roles wonderfully.Todd Haynes' &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; should have been more heavily lauded from critics and audiences, and Oscars alike.

603447,A2EY1BJK2ETC37,B00005JLQH,Jason W. Qualls,"[3, 4]","Todd Haynes's ""Far From Heaven,"" a semi-replica of Douglas Sirk's classic 1954 ""All That Heaven Allows,"" surpasses its predecessor with stunning grace. The film not only broadens the accusation of society's attitudes toward social issues (by adding the factors of homosexuality and interracial relationships), it also achieves something else very important from its audiences: empathy.Suburban Connecticut, circa 1957. Cathy Whitaker (played by the impeccable Julianne Moore) has a seemingly perfect life until her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), struggles with his sexuality and she finds solace in her black gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert). She must deal with her inner demons as she cares for her children, her friends, and her social status.In the making of this film, director Haynes had choices to make: either to convert the melodramatic style of the original film into today's style of moviemaking and to touch upon the social issue with familiar revolutionary pretensions, or to retain the melodramatic style of filmmaking and to allow the film to make its own statement through the subtleties of its story. Haynes chose the latter, and it was a very wise choice.The film is made in the style of a 1950s melodrama, but sincerely refrains from poking fun at the genre. The consistency of the exquisite cinematography by Edward Lachman and the magnificently emotional musical score by Elmer Bernstein are among the elements that beautifully add to Haynes's excellent screenplay. The true sincerity of the film, however, comes from an utterly brilliant performance by Julianne Moore, who is in practially every scene. Her purposefully stilted dialogue and seemingly fake emotion (which hit a sour note with some film critics) reflects the restrictions that are imposed by this particular genre, and they further offer a critique of the cultural expectations which the film sets out to expose. Subtleties such as this are constant throughout, and though there is no social impact present in the film's plot, the film manages to make a statement which is far more sincere than it would have been otherwise.

That said, I want to talk about the real ""guts"" of this film, which has to do with more than its breathtakingly lush production and the truly immortal performance by Julianne Moore.Every great actress has a career-defining role. Joan Crawford had Mildred Pierce. Jessica Lange had Frances. Nicole Kidman had Moulin Rouge. And now Julianne Moore has her unforgettable performance - in Far From Heaven. Obviously, all these performances have something in common...the brilliant, lyrical mastery and poetic imagery they brought to their roles. Moore truly transcends her written character, making Cathy Whitaker very much a real, yet larger-than-life and somehow ideal, creature.The film's main message is not a confrontation of '50s artifice with brutal emotional reality.  Nor is it a tribute or satire of the ""women's picture"" or weeper.  It simply uses the forgotten, yet essential, genre of melodrama to move an audience. Melodrama has rarely been better than it is here...because it is combined with a powerful message.Not everyone has found the message. You have to dig for it. Love is our only happiness, and yet society has imposed barriers that separate us from the people we love.  In the 1950s, one of the barriers was between interracial couples. Another was between people of the same sex. The great tragedy was these people could not realize their love for each other and be together in the society of the times (hence, the film's quote, ""What imprisons desires of the heart?"").By contrasting these two barriers, the film not only exposes the barriers that kept us from love and happines in the past, but also shows how far our society still has to go. With gay rights and marriage on the horizon, few films were more relevant - and historically intelligent - than Far From Heaven.

603451,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLQH,Joe Sherry,"[1, 2]","Far From Heaven is, without question, one of the best movies of 2002.  It may not have made every top ten list or made enough at the box office, but this was a very memorable film.  This is a beautiful movie.  Set in the 1950's, it sets up an exaggerated reality where everything is too perfect and everyone is too close to the stereotype of the time period.  Julianne Moore puts June Cleaver to shame as the perfect housewife and Dennis Quaid is her hardworking husband.  The characters try to present an image of 50's perfection, but very quickly we see that things aren't quite right.  Far From Heaven takes the stereotype of the 50's image and shakes it up by introducing racial prejudice and sexual prejudice.  Moore's housewife becomes friends with a black man.  She feels that he is one of the few people she can openly talk to, but this causes problems in the insular society she lives in.  Though the civil rights movement does exist, the world of Far From Heaven is separated into white and black, and there should be no crossing over.  The friendship of Moore and Dennis Haysbert is viewed as more than a friendship and also as a betrayal of white society (Haysbert has the same problem in the black community).  The other big issue that Far From Heaven plays with is that of sexual prejudice.  When Julianne Moore catches her husband with another man, Quaid's struggles with homosexuality come out into the open.Far From Heaven is a wonderfully acted movie and is perfectly put together.

603452,A33IATTAB2Q7KD,B00005JLQH,John Bliss,"[6, 7]","My immediate reaction to this movie was ""beautifully shot, beautifully acted gimmick."" Todd Haynes does a wonderful job of recreating the style of 50s melodramas, as well as capturing the look and feel of 1950s, when the future was right around the corner. The movie takes a more unblinking view of sexual attitudes and race relations than the movies of that time did (or could, for reasons that are perfectly clear once you see the film), but on first viewing it didn't have much emotional resonance for me.Now it's weeks later, and I can't get it out of my head. The four leads - I include Patricia Clarkson as Julianne Moore's best friend, whose nuanced performance is one of the best on film this year - fling themselves completely into their work. Julianne Moore, always stunning, does an incredible job slowly unveiling layers of a character who does her best to add enough layers to protect herself. Dennis Quaid has the unenviable task of playing a man who has cut himself so far off from his emotional center that his only choices are to work or drink. Dennis Haysbert, third billed as the black gardener, serves as the rational core of the film, as the only character who is self-aware, who chooses to push what is socially acceptable rather than doing it accidentally or by compulsion, and in doing so almost loses everything he holds dear.The movie is very talky, as social commentary often is, but the meat of the movie takes place in the silences. Emotional conversations are cut short and punctuated by half-spoken sentences. A look - or an avoided glance - often says more than all the language of a scene. The actors convey so much in how they hold themselves that words are almost unnecessary. Yet they ramble on, because not to speak leaves such uncomfortable gaps.This movie doesn't tell us anything new about 1950s America. But it shows it to us, in a way that the films of the time couldn't even see. It's this vision of a time, so much still with us (as Trent Lott pointed out), that makes the film resonate for me so long after the fact.",4,Under My Skin,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2061,"['immediate', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'gimmick', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'wonderful', 'job', 'recreating', 'style', '50s', 'melodramas', 'as', 'well', 'capturing', 'look', 'feel', '1950s', 'when', 'future', 'was', 'right', 'corner', 'movie', 'more', 'unblinking', 'view', 'sexual', 'attitudes', 'race', 'relations', 'movies', 'time', 'did', 'could', 'reasons', 'are', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'me.Now', 'weeks', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'four', 'include', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'best', 'friend', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'fling', 'completely', 'work', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'always', 'stunning', 'incredible', 'job', 'slowly', 'unveiling', 'layers', 'character', 'who', 'best', 'add', 'enough', 'layers', 'protect', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'cut', 'so', 'far', 'emotional', 'center', 'only', 'choices', 'are', 'work', 'drink', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'third', 'billed', 'black', 'gardener', 'rational', 'core', 'film', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'self-aware', 'who', 'push', 'what', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'rather', 'doing', 'accidentally', 'compulsion', 'doing', 'so', 'almost', 'everything', 'dear.The', 'movie', 'very', 'talky', 'social', 'commentary', 'often', 'meat', 'movie', 'place', 'silences', 'Emotional', 'conversations', 'are', 'cut', 'short', 'punctuated', 'half-spoken', 'sentences', 'look', 'avoided', 'glance', 'often', 'more', 'language', 'scene', 'actors', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'hold', 'words', 'are', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'ramble', 'not', 'speak', 'leaves', 'such', 'uncomfortable', 'gaps.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'new', '1950s', 'America', 'way', 'films', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'vision', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'still', 'Trent', 'Lott', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'resonate', 'so', 'long', 'fact']",N/A

We come to see, arduously, their ""perfect"" lives as being based on nothing more than lies; thus, they inhabit ""perfect"" cages in which all vulgarity, originality, and spontaneity are banished.  And yet this knowledge ennobles them, elevates them above their restrictive, petty bourgeois surroundings, etc.  The highly controlled, stylized Julianne Moore seems to be channeling Joan Crawford and Lana Turner.  This movie has its poignant moments, but, with its stylized sets and costumes, its obvious topicality, and its central heroine heaving and sighing in deep frustration, it also seems a camp parody of serious ""issue"" movies of the past, except now everything's spelled out and the audience doesn't have to guess why everyone's getting all upset.  Todd Haynes must be giggling at all the soporofic seriousness devoted to this movie, although I will never understand why the good old repressive 1950s of Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies appear to hold such a pull on white gay men of a certain age--do they feel some ambivalence about being out of the closet?  I get the feeling they liked it better when they could sneak around and live lives of inner torture and illicit sex.  The thrill is gone when everyone knows about it, I guess.

603454,A3H7HJ8O42U70Z,B00005JLQH,"""johntchance""","[3, 3]","Far From Heaven is indeed beautifully shot and it captures perfectly the mood and decor of a 1950s era Douglas Sirk picture.  In fact, it borrows heavily from Sirk's 1955 film, ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS.  That movie was about the taboo relationship between an older Jane Wyman with almost grown kids and the younger Rock Hudson.  The clever thing in FAR FROM HEAVEN is that Julianne Moore is married to the character that Rock Hudson played in real life, and her taboo relationship is with a black man instead of a younger man.The movie hardly covers any new ground.  We've seen these issues explored and re-explored already.  Maybe we've never seen it in the style of Douglas Sirk, and maybe it is clever that Director, Todd Haynes, just reworks a Sirk plot to make his point, but I think the critics went a little overboard with their praise.  In the end, you have a beautifully shot film with good acting, but Moore still has the same regrets as Jane Wyman about her life.  The characters are really the same, only the circumstances that got them there are a bit different.It's still enjoyable and even funny in places, but just like the movie School Ties that explored anti-Semitism in the 1950s, I felt that we really don't learn anything new about the issue of prejudice just by watching it happen 50 years ago.  It only seems to allow us to look back from the safety of modern enlightened live and shake our heads at those poor fools who were so wrong.  That's too easy.Great movies with messages should challenge our thoughts not reward us for our own modern-day sensibilities.  ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS let modern audiences think about the constraints society was currently putting on the reverse age-difference question.  It gave people something to consider when they left the movie.I doubt Todd Haynes was trying to make the film that he is being praised for.  He probably just thought it would be interesting to rework ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and re-introduce that style of filmmaking to modern audiences.  He made an entertaining film, but not a classic.  I can only think the politically correct premise made this film seem a bit more important to critics than it really is.",3,What's all the hubub?,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,2183,"['Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'indeed', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'decor', '1950s', 'era', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'picture', 'fact', 'heavily', 'Sirk', '1955', 'film', 'THAT', 'HEAVEN', 'ALLOWS', 'movie', 'was', 'taboo', 'relationship', 'older', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'almost', 'grown', 'kids', 'younger', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'clever', 'thing', 'FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'married', 'character', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'taboo', 'relationship', 'black', 'man', 'instead', 'younger', 'man.The', 'movie', 'hardly', 'new', 'ground', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'issues', 'explored', 're-explored', 'already', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'style', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'maybe', 'clever', 'Director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'just', 'reworks', 'Sirk', 'plot', 'make', 'point', 'think', 'critics', 'went', 'little', 'overboard', 'praise', 'end', 'have', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'Moore', 'still', 'same', 'regrets', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'same', 'only', 'circumstances', 'got', 'are', 'bit', 'different.It', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'funny', 'places', 'just', 'movie', 'School', 'explored', 'anti-Semitism', '1950s', 'felt', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'issue', 'prejudice', 'just', 'watching', 'happen', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'allow', 'look', 'back', 'safety', 'modern', 'enlightened', 'live', 'shake', 'heads', 'poor', 'fools', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'wrong', 'too', 'easy.Great', 'movies', 'messages', 'should', 'challenge', 'thoughts', 'not', 'reward', 'own', 'modern-day', 'sensibilities', 'THAT', 'HEAVEN', 'ALLOWS', 'let', 'modern', 'audiences', 'think', 'constraints', 'society', 'was', 'currently', 'putting', 'reverse', 'age-difference', 'question', 'gave', 'people', 'something', 'consider', 'when', 'left', 'movie.I', 'doubt', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'being', 'praised', 'probably', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'rework', 'ALL', 'THAT', 'HEAVEN', 'ALLOWS', 're-introduce', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'modern', 'audiences', 'made', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'politically', 'correct', 'premise', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'important', 'critics', 'really']",N/A

Perfect father, mother, marriage, children (or at least reasonably well behaved), job (for Dad - Mom stayed home), house, schools, and neighborhood. If there was a dark side, it didn't extend further than one of the Anderson kids complaining about having to help set the perfect table for the perfect home-cooked dinner. America had single-handedly won WWII (what Eastern Front?) and was keeping the world safe for democracy. Ike was President, and life was grand. For those of us who lived even a close approximation, it was.FAR FROM HEAVEN begins just that way. Frank Whitaker (Dennis Quaid) and his All-American blonde wife Cathy (Julianne Moore) - the high school cheerleader/prom queen sort who probably married right after graduation - own a perfect (and huge) home in a perfect neighborhood of Hartford, CN where you can't see the perfect neighbors for all the trees (gloriously clothed in perfect fall colors). The Whitakers have two perfect kids, and Frank manages the local office of mighty Magnatech. It's 1957, and when the Whitaker boy says ""Oh, gee!"", Mom reprimands him for his bad language. Frank wears a suit, tie and hat; Cathy wears full skirts and is perfectly coifed. In this all-white world, the only Blacks are the perfect housekeeper Sybil (Viola Davis) and the perfect gardener Ray (Dennis Haysbert). But there's a flip side.In the film's leading role, Moore turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the 50s-perfect wife whose perfect life implodes on the day she discovers hubby, ostensibly working late, in his office passionately kissing another man. And she's so pathetically grateful when Frank reluctantly consents to undergo psychiatric treatment. But then, in her growing loneliness, she befriends Ray, who's just taken over his deceased father's yard maintenance business. Ray is educated, sensitive, soft-spoken, gentle, and the single father of a young daughter. One day, Cathy accepts Ray's offer to take her on a short errand out of town to pick up some shrubs. On the way back, they stop for lunch at a roadhouse. Cathy is seen exiting Ray's truck by a local gossip, who soon pours gasoline on the smoldering racism of the Whitakers' neighbors. Even Cathy's best friend Eleanor (Patricia Clarkson) is appalled. Finally, thinking all is at least approaching right again with Frank (who's undergoing that therapy, remember?), off Cathy and her troubled spouse go for an idyllic winter vacation in Miami, a place peopled with handsome young men. Oh oh, big mistake.In a role very different from the congenial characters recently played in FREQUENCY and THE ROOKIE, Quaid is darkly effective as the tortured Frank. And Haysbert is perhaps another Denzel Washington in the making. The ""look"" of the film is superb, recreating the fashion, cars, home and office decor, and technology of the period to an uncanny degree.FAR FROM HEAVEN gives the viewers a glimpse at the dark side of an ideal time perhaps existing only in nostalgia and Norman Rockwell prints. It presages the turmoil and changes in a society on the verge of irrevocable evolution. For American audiences, this deserves to be a great film. For foreign audiences who didn't share in America's 50s bounty, it may be something less, but at least they can see where we come from.",5,The dark side of Father Knows Best,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,3452,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'remember', '50s', 'shows', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'how', 'perfect', 'life', 'American', 'WASP', 'middle', 'class', 'was', 'depicted', 'being', 'Perfect', 'father', 'mother', 'marriage', 'children', 'least', 'reasonably', 'well', 'behaved', 'job', 'Dad', 'Mom', 'stayed', 'home', 'house', 'schools', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'dark', 'side', 'did', ""n't"", 'extend', 'further', 'one', 'Anderson', 'kids', 'complaining', 'having', 'help', 'set', 'perfect', 'table', 'perfect', 'home-cooked', 'dinner', 'America', 'had', 'single-handedly', 'won', 'WWII', 'what', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'was', 'keeping', 'world', 'safe', 'democracy', 'Ike', 'was', 'President', 'life', 'was', 'grand', 'who', 'lived', 'even', 'close', 'approximation', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'just', 'way', 'Frank', 'Whitaker', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'All-American', 'blonde', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleader/prom', 'queen', 'sort', 'who', 'probably', 'married', 'right', 'graduation', 'perfect', 'huge', 'home', 'perfect', 'neighborhood', 'Hartford', 'CN', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'perfect', 'neighbors', 'trees', 'gloriously', 'clothed', 'perfect', 'fall', 'colors', 'Whitakers', 'have', 'two', 'perfect', 'kids', 'Frank', 'local', 'office', 'mighty', 'Magnatech', '1957', 'when', 'Whitaker', 'boy', 'Oh', 'gee', 'Mom', 'bad', 'language', 'Frank', 'suit', 'tie', 'hat', 'Cathy', 'full', 'skirts', 'perfectly', 'coifed', 'all-white', 'world', 'only', 'Blacks', 'are', 'perfect', 'housekeeper', 'Sybil', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'perfect', 'gardener', 'Ray', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'flip', 'film', 'leading', 'role', 'Moore', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', '50s-perfect', 'wife', 'perfect', 'life', 'implodes', 'day', 'hubby', 'ostensibly', 'working', 'late', 'office', 'passionately', 'kissing', 'man', 'so', 'pathetically', 'grateful', 'when', 'Frank', 'reluctantly', 'undergo', 'psychiatric', 'treatment', 'then', 'growing', 'loneliness', 'Ray', 'who', 'just', 'taken', 'over', 'deceased', 'father', 'yard', 'maintenance', 'business', 'Ray', 'educated', 'sensitive', 'soft-spoken', 'gentle', 'single', 'father', 'young', 'daughter', 'One', 'day', 'Cathy', 'Ray', 'offer', 'take', 'short', 'errand', 'town', 'pick', 'up', 'shrubs', 'way', 'back', 'stop', 'lunch', 'roadhouse', 'Cathy', 'seen', 'exiting', 'Ray', 'truck', 'local', 'gossip', 'who', 'soon', 'pours', 'gasoline', 'smoldering', 'racism', 'Whitakers', 'neighbors', 'Even', 'Cathy', 'best', 'friend', 'Eleanor', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'appalled', 'Finally', 'thinking', 'least', 'approaching', 'right', 'again', 'Frank', 'who', 'undergoing', 'therapy', 'remember', 'off', 'Cathy', 'troubled', 'spouse', 'go', 'idyllic', 'winter', 'vacation', 'Miami', 'place', 'peopled', 'handsome', 'young', 'men', 'Oh', 'oh', 'big', 'mistake.In', 'role', 'very', 'different', 'congenial', 'characters', 'recently', 'played', 'FREQUENCY', 'THE', 'ROOKIE', 'Quaid', 'darkly', 'effective', 'tortured', 'Frank', 'Haysbert', 'perhaps', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'making', 'look', 'film', 'superb', 'recreating', 'fashion', 'cars', 'home', 'office', 'decor', 'technology', 'period', 'uncanny', 'degree.FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'dark', 'side', 'ideal', 'time', 'perhaps', 'existing', 'only', 'nostalgia', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'prints', 'turmoil', 'changes', 'society', 'verge', 'irrevocable', 'evolution', 'American', 'audiences', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'foreign', 'audiences', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'America', '50s', 'bounty', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'less', 'least', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'come']",N/A
603456,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,B00005JLQH,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[2, 5]","""Far From Heaven"" is Tod Haynes' masterpiece, a deeply moving and textured period piece that resonates with prescence and authenticity.  Set in 1950's Connecticut, its suburban mix of domestic bliss and martini-swilling liberalism both engulfs and betrays the main characters - the luminous housewife Cathy and her conflcited husband Frank.  Their story, which begins in what many will know as domestic heaven is swept away by events beyond their control, and as both couple and individuals, the characters are reinvented before our eyes.  Human ""beingness"" = the frailties that we all confront, the demons we all at some point face down crashes head first into the social order of the day - the condescension towards ""negros"", the perfectly manicured lawns and society funtions.  The effect is almost spiritual and familiar at once, as the audience tries to cope with the realities of plot and setting and the unexpected sensation of really UNDERSTANDING these characters.Tod Haynes has created a multi-layered work of art that deserves to be seen by any adult who relishes superb filmmaking and simply put, flawless acting.  Julianne Moore is breathtakingly beautiful in a surreal role that asks her to be vulnerable, angry and honest beyond imagination, often all at once.  Her Cathy is a domestic goddess of another era, confronting situations and ideas that have never even occurred to her, much less happened.  Moore's capacity to act with simple grace and moral authority makes Cathy deeply human, fallen and far from innocent.  Dennis Haysbert as the family gardner, with whom Cathy explores her own lifeview and inner resolve, is superb - a yong Morgan Freeman, with deep pools for eyes and a heart that seems to lift off his chest.  And Dennis Quaid gives perhaps the performance of the year as the troubled Frank, the salesman-poster-boy who has it all and then throws it all away so that he, too, may be fully alive.  Quaid speaks volumes with casual glances and toss-away remarks in whatever role he finds himself -as father, husband, corporate citizen and lover.  Quaid and Moore deserve Oscars for giving the performances of their careers, and Haysbert's star is certain to rise.  Their work - along with Patricia Clarkson - ought to be celebrated and studied for years to come.""Far From Heaven"" is a five-star profound film that dares to plumb the human condition and address important themes (universal and commonplace even fifty years later) we can all relate to.

SOUTH,"[16, 18]","I was quite surprised after seeing ""Far From Heaven"", and then reading some of the tepid-to-terrible audience reviews on this web page.I only went to see this film based on my experience with another Todd Haynes film, the powerful ""Safe"". My trip to see ""Heaven"" was strictly a time-out diversion from the holiday season, and I only expected it to be reasonably enjoyable. I ended up being totally blown away, have seen it twice since, and everyone I've sent to see it (mostly acting and theatre devotees) has had a similar reaction.It IS a peculiar film, in that the genre is so much like stepping through a time warp back into the 1950's. The look, the style of acting, the photography, EVERYTHING seems meticulously like a movie actually made in the mid-fiftes. However, underneath all the Technicolor glitz are tortured dilemmas that past film-makers could only hint at. In fact, that seems to be a fascinating theme throughout Haynes' films, beginning with a college film about singer Karen Carpenter told through (of all things!) Barbie dolls. The writer-director bores through a seemingly perfect surface appearence to reveal the pain and emotion never glimpsed by the outside world.Haynes, as he did in ""Safe"", once again makes masterful use of quite possibly the best actress of our generation. As protagonist Cathy, Julianne Moore does more with a tiny bit of energy and concentration than anyone chewing up and spitting out the scenery. No one elicits more empathy from an audience. In ""Heaven"" she's challenged to walk a tightrope between placidity and melodrama. One teeter in either direction could have sent the movie into a dangerous imbalance, but Moore walks straight down the middle. If ""Heaven"" doesn't get her an Oscar nomination, something is very, very wrong.Equally strong (and startling) is Dennis Quaid as Cathy's husband, Frank. His depiction of a bisexual husband is eye-opening, tragic, and tortured.  In fact, the whole picture painted of how homosexuality was viewed in that time period is chilling and scary, and that's coming to you from a gay man. Although I consider him a good actor, this is a performance I would never have expected out of Quaid. Certainly assured a lot of recognition for best supporting actor in 2002.See it, buy it, rent it, whatever . . . but see it!",5,"Truly a masterpiece, as entertaining as it is intelligent.",1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,2308,"['was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'then', 'reading', 'tepid-to-terrible', 'audience', 'reviews', 'web', 'only', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'based', 'experience', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'film', 'powerful', 'Safe', 'trip', 'see', 'Heaven', 'was', 'strictly', 'time-out', 'diversion', 'holiday', 'season', 'only', 'expected', 'be', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'have', 'seen', 'twice', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'sent', 'see', 'mostly', 'acting', 'theatre', 'devotees', 'had', 'similar', 'reaction.It', 'peculiar', 'film', 'genre', 'so', 'much', 'stepping', 'time', 'warp', 'back', '1950', 'look', 'style', 'acting', 'photography', 'EVERYTHING', 'meticulously', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'mid-fiftes', 'However', 'Technicolor', 'glitz', 'are', 'tortured', 'past', 'film-makers', 'could', 'only', 'hint', 'fact', 'be', 'fascinating', 'theme', 'Haynes', 'films', 'beginning', 'college', 'film', 'singer', 'Karen', 'Carpenter', 'told', 'things', 'Barbie', 'writer-director', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'surface', 'appearence', 'reveal', 'pain', 'emotion', 'never', 'glimpsed', 'outside', 'world.Haynes', 'did', 'Safe', 'once', 'again', 'masterful', 'use', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'actress', 'generation', 'protagonist', 'Cathy', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'more', 'tiny', 'bit', 'energy', 'concentration', 'anyone', 'chewing', 'up', 'spitting', 'out', 'scenery', 'one', 'more', 'empathy', 'audience', 'Heaven', 'challenged', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'placidity', 'melodrama', 'One', 'teeter', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'sent', 'movie', 'dangerous', 'imbalance', 'Moore', 'walks', 'straight', 'down', 'middle', 'Heaven', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'something', 'very', 'very', 'wrong.Equally', 'strong', 'startling', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Cathy', 'husband', 'Frank', 'depiction', 'bisexual', 'husband', 'eye-opening', 'tragic', 'tortured', 'fact', 'whole', 'picture', 'painted', 'how', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'viewed', 'time', 'period', 'chilling', 'scary', 'coming', 'gay', 'man', 'consider', 'good', 'actor', 'performance', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'expected', 'Quaid', 'Certainly', 'assured', 'lot', 'recognition', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', '2002.See', 'buy', 'rent', 'whatever', 'see']",N/A
603458,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JLQH,J R Zullo,"[2, 3]","If you used Doc Brown's time machine and brought someone from the 50's to watch ""Far from heaven"", this immaginary time traveller would notice no difference. Todd Haynes' best film so far is a complete and very accurate re-creation of a movie from the half-century, most notedly Douglas Sirk's dramas and romances. Figurine, cinematography, art, direction techniques, sound score, etc. everything was made to provide the viewers with the feeling of fifty years ago. ""Far from heaven"" is indeed very well produced and researched, without being annoying and out of date.Julianne Moore, once again acting with perfection, is Cathy Whitaker, the wife of a television-set company executive, mother of two children, owner of an excellent house with beautiful gardens. In other words, the typical successful family of Hartford, Connecticut. But then, she suddenly finds her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid, very good) is gay. Yes, he likes men, an though they try, in many different ways, to cure his ""disease"" togheter, the always-smiling Cathy powerlessly watches Frank drift away. Then, she finds confort talking and unwillingly falling in love with Raymond (Dennis Haysbert), the black and enlightened gardender of her house. Obviously, this is not seen with good eyes among her circle of friends .So, as you've already noticed, ""Far from heaven"" is a movie about a hypocrit society, and about prejudice, in a double front: blacks and homossexuals. We have to remember, this is New England, where ""people know better than people in the south"", so blacks are tolerated and treated with a distant respect. No riots, no confrontations. But when Cathy is seen talking with the black gardener in a vernisage, the high-class society is shocked. Even to the point that Frank, who is ""surely ill - he's gay"" shouts at her wife and asks her ""what is she trying to do with his life?"". This is the subtetly of  ""Far from heaven"". The problem is, this movie is too subtle.Dealing with a level of prejudice like this, in a society that was perhaps at the top of its hypocrital fit, ""Far from heaven"" could be a little more agressive, more in-your-face.  Of course, the movie would loose part of its beauty, but the way it is it seems a little pointless. I left the theater with the impression that I'd watched a terrific movie, but there was something missing. Or  maybe I didn't understand what Haynes was trying to show. Maybe he's saying: ""Some lives are really pointless and have no way to get better"", like that famous Jack Nicholson's character: ""What if this is as good as it gets?"". But I don't think like that, and that's why in my opinion ""Far from heaven"" is lacking in obviousness.But a great movie nonetheless. Good script, amazing visuals (pay attention to the sets of trees and leaves), and top-notch performances by Julianne (""the forgotten"") Moore and Dennis Quaid.Grade 8.4/10",4,Came in a DeLorean,1061251200,"08 19, 2003",2003,2875,"['used', 'Doc', 'Brown', 'time', 'machine', 'brought', 'someone', '50', 'watch', 'Far', 'heaven', 'immaginary', 'time', 'traveller', 'would', 'notice', 'difference', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'best', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'complete', 'very', 'accurate', 're-creation', 'movie', 'half-century', 'most', 'notedly', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'dramas', 'romances', 'Figurine', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'techniques', 'sound', 'score', 'etc', 'everything', 'was', 'made', 'provide', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'Far', 'heaven', 'indeed', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'researched', 'being', 'annoying', 'date.Julianne', 'Moore', 'once', 'again', 'acting', 'perfection', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'wife', 'television-set', 'company', 'executive', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'owner', 'excellent', 'house', 'beautiful', 'gardens', 'other', 'words', 'typical', 'successful', 'family', 'Hartford', 'Connecticut', 'then', 'suddenly', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'very', 'good', 'gay', 'Yes', 'men', 'try', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'cure', 'disease', 'togheter', 'always-smiling', 'Cathy', 'powerlessly', 'Frank', 'drift', 'away', 'Then', 'confort', 'talking', 'unwillingly', 'falling', 'love', 'Raymond', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'black', 'enlightened', 'gardender', 'house', 'Obviously', 'not', 'seen', 'good', 'eyes', 'circle', 'friends', '.So', ""'ve"", 'already', 'noticed', 'Far', 'heaven', 'movie', 'hypocrit', 'society', 'prejudice', 'double', 'front', 'blacks', 'homossexuals', 'have', 'remember', 'New', 'England', 'where', 'people', 'know', 'better', 'people', 'south', 'blacks', 'are', 'tolerated', 'treated', 'distant', 'respect', 'riots', 'confrontations', 'when', 'Cathy', 'seen', 'talking', 'black', 'gardener', 'vernisage', 'high-class', 'society', 'shocked', 'Even', 'point', 'Frank', 'who', 'surely', 'ill', 'gay', 'shouts', 'wife', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'life', 'subtetly', 'Far', 'heaven', 'problem', 'movie', 'too', 'subtle.Dealing', 'level', 'prejudice', 'society', 'was', 'perhaps', 'top', 'hypocrital', 'fit', 'Far', 'heaven', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'agressive', 'more', 'in-your-face', 'course', 'movie', 'would', 'loose', 'part', 'beauty', 'way', 'little', 'pointless', 'left', 'theater', 'impression', ""'d"", 'watched', 'terrific', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Haynes', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'Maybe', 'saying', 'lives', 'are', 'really', 'pointless', 'have', 'way', 'get', 'better', 'famous', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'What', 'as', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'opinion', 'Far', 'heaven', 'lacking', 'obviousness.But', 'great', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'Good', 'script', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'pay', 'attention', 'sets', 'trees', 'leaves', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'Julianne', 'forgotten', 'Moore', 'Dennis', 'Quaid.Grade', '8.4/10']",N/A
603459,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00005JLQH,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[7, 8]","My three favorite films from early teen years were: 'Written On The Wind', 'All That Heaven Allows', and 'Imitation of Life'. I loved all I saw, heard, and felt from, in, and about these films.  What I didn't know at the time was that were all the products of the masterful Douglas Sirk.It was not necessary for me to hear Todd Haynes' interesting and reflective commentary on this DVD to know that his film 'Far From Heaven' pays homage not to the real-life 1950s, at least not any life I was living at the time, but rather to the beautiful work of Douglas Sirk and his melodramas.  Films that totally removed us from our routine lives and plunged us into the fairytale romantic world of people with beautiful faces, complex personal problems, thwarted love affairs, stunning wardrobes, lush landscapes, and immaculate homes, lives all lived fabulously surrounded by a background of sweeping, majestically emotional musical scores.Speaking of the music, Elmer Bernstein re-created the sound of the scores from the above mentioned films with such accuracy in 'Far From Heaven' it is difficult to believe he was not responsible for any of the original scores of my three favorite Sirk films; with the soundtrack of  'Written on the Wind' (released on 45 EP) being my favorite soundtrack for years to come. Has there ever been a greater musical film moment than that portrayed by the seductive Dorothy Malone (in her Oscar-winning role of Marylee Hadley) when she storms into her room, slams the door, blasts out a mambo/type jazz tune on the phonograph and dances alone, casting off her inhibitions and torrid desires?It is my belief, though of course I can't prove it or even know it with absolute certainty, that many reviewers of this film may have never viewed the original Sirk films which inspired 'Far From Heaven', probably certainly not in their original era.  Those reviewers speaking negatively of Quaid's stoic, wooden performance were perhaps not intimately familiar with performances by John Gavin or Rock Hudson.  Certainly, the naivet&eacute; portrayed by Juliette Moore's character was the most closely reality-based truth about the 50s in this film.  Not one mother in any family of my friends at that time could even drive a car.  Younger viewers, born well after the 1955, have both lived very different lives than those of us born and reared before 1963 and certainly have been raised on a completely different type of Hollywood film style.  It is difficult to say whether we are better served by film styles that are either more intelligent or more jaded, depending upon one's point of view.  Certainly they are more action-oriented than the more thoughtful, slower moving films of the 1950's.The one jarring note I felt in 'Far From Heaven' was the single curse word (in the use of the 'f' word).  While that word is a staple of today's standard vocabulary (including my own personally), and is often barely even consciously heard by many movie-goers in the context of today's films (or our lives for that matter); I found it disorientingly out of place in this film.  Haynes addressed this issue in his commentary and indicated the intent was to 'jar' the audience, which in my case - he did.  However, given the otherwise flawless dedication to recreating the work of Douglas Sirk, it was amazing how this one word stood out as inappropriate for the time, the character, and the genre.  This is not a moral judgment by any stretch, words are words.  Rather my notice of this particular use of this word was more like a reminder of how well-structured films can transport us so completely from our real lives into the world of their creation.  For someone who views the variety of films I do, as often as I do, this was an astonishing recognition, mostly for just how unaware I still was of the power of films, even after all this time and exposure.I purchased this DVD at a bargain rate and more than got my money's worth in pleasure and memories.  The extras, of which there are several, were interesting and informative.  If you are a serious fan or student of 'film', this is a modern day treat which will transport you to more innocent days and a decidedly different film style that you might see in the theater today.If you were a fan of the movies of the 50's, do not let the reviews of those who are not familiar with the originals deter you from securing this film at any price and of allowing yourself to take a magnificent journey filled with heavenly pleasure back into the world of the movies we loved.",5,Imitation Written Close to Heaven,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,4538,"['three', 'favorite', 'films',

It recaptures the look and the feel of Sirk's low key, but scathing satire on American society. Far from Heaven goes further to crack the veneer of American society and reveal the racism and the loathing present at the time.Moore plays the perfect wife of a corporate advertising executive played by Dennis Quaid, spending her time doing the perfect the dinner party. Quaid has deep and dark secrets and revealing his true self shatters her neat perfect world.

603468,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,B00005JLQH,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[4, 8]","Todd Haynes' new film is a homage to 1950s Hollywood, specifically the glossy Technicolor dramas of Douglas Sirk, ""women's pictures"" featuring stars such as Jane Wyman and Lana Turner as glamorously coiffed and dressed women beset by adversity. From the fonts chosen for the opening title sequence, to the music by veteran film composer Elmer Bernstein, to every detail of the set decoration and costuming, the period is evoked to perfection, not so much the actual time period as how it was portrayed on film.It is thus easy early on to regard the movie as a campy sendup, with its stilted dialogue and portrayal of an impossibly perfect family, social and business life. As ""Far From Heaven"" progresses, however, it is apparent that Haynes has a much more grandiose aim. His genius and unique power is his ability to continue evoking the film conventions of Sirk and 50s Hollywood even as he subverts them. Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore), faced with the knowledge that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is straying, turns to the handsome gardener (Dennis Haysbert) for solace, just as Jane Wyman turned to Rock Hudson in Sirk's ""All That Heaven Allows."" (Note the titular reference.) Only this time the handsome, intelligent, soft-spoken gardener is black. Moreover, she catches her husband in the arms not of another woman but a man. Suddenly Moore's impeccably styled and coiffed heroine is dealing with homosexuality and the possibility of interracial romance, issues that tear her carefully managed existence to shreds by the end, with no artificial happy ending this time to restore order.Haynes' vision could not have been realized without the assistance of his leading actors, all of whom give performances that brilliantly walk the fine line between sincerity and irony. Julianne Moore's Cathy and Dennis Quaid's Frank are fine enough, but Dennis Haysbert arguably has the most difficult task--to make the impossibly noble and intelligent gardener a believable human figure. (A scene where Cathy and her gardener converse about Miro at a posh art opening that he has somehow managed to wander into strikes, for me, the only false note in the script.) It is a measure of his success that the scenes between him and Moore, while they occasionally may be implausible as drama, are always believable as two wounded souls reaching out to one another. Due to the depth and power of the emotions projected by the actors, ""Far From Heaven"" transcends its origins as a retro-homage and attains the power of the finest human drama.

It's set in the 1950s, but it's a film that could never have been made at that time.  That's because the themes of homosexuality and interracial romance could only be hinted at in those days.The story is about the kind of  upscale suburban couple with two children who seem to have a perfect life.  All is not well however. Both the husband and wife have both broken social taboos of the time and have to deal with the consequences.  The acting is outstanding and so is the script.  I was immediately involved in their predicaments and felt tension throughout as they tried to cope with the realities around them.Written and directed by Todd Haynes, the script is excellent and never preaches.  At the same time, the dilemma was brilliantly etched in color.  I mean this literally.  The clothes were all 1950's style but, compared to films actually made in the 50's, they were uglier and brighter.  In one scene all the women were dressed in bright orange hues.  And even the gardener was dressed in an orange shirt and trousers.  At other times they're all dressed in shades of green. Julianne Moore always had perfect makeup, wore bright dresses with full skirts and, for some strange reason, never carried a purse when she went anywhere. This gave the film a surreal feeling, almost like a comic book sketch, with the details exaggerated just enough to enrich the theme.This is a fine film.

Now, as I spent a fair amount of my childhood holed up in an apartment watching those very movies, I fear it falls to me to say that this movie doesn't really evoke those movies. It was the same way when ""Pleasantville"" came out a few years ago; that didn't do it for me either. What I find curious is that a much better job of ""looking like a 1950s movie"" was done by ""Eight Women"" also out last year. That one really had the clothes and technicolor down. So, if your aim is to see That Kind of Thing, then pick up that movie, not this. ""Far from Heaven"" looks more like the 1960s ""The Children's Hour"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine, and perhaps bears better comparison with that movie, because both feature homosexual storylines.Julianne Moore's suburban socialite housewife lacks an emotional center, and that's what kept this from really achieving great movie status for me. She responds to things more like a Stepford Wife than not, so it does play like satire or spoof. Dennis Quaid is doing most of the work in this movie, as he has to deal with his own demons about his latent homosexuality. He's walking a seamy side of life, but can't seem to stop himself. The much-lauded gardener is in the vein of Nat King Cole. One of the other reviewers is quite right when they observed that there is just no way that a character this intelligent couldn't have figured out what would be the end result of his befriending the white Julianne Moore. In fact, Moore's continuing to seek him out demonstrates that she is actually as uncaring about the impact of her desires on his life as her husband is uncaring about the ramifications of his leaving her for his boyfriend.

603476,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JLQH,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[24, 28]","Far From Heaven is a beautiful, passionate film.  It unfolds with the perfect family life for the Whitakers, just like we always saw on TV shows of the era. It seems as though director Todd Haynes was shooting for that look - that perfect look of the 50's that only really existed in black and white TV.  The staging of the utterly perfect home and backdrops is in stark contrast to what is really going on in this family.  Nothing prepares wife Cathy (Julianne Moore) for the shocking revelation of her husband's (Dennis Quaid's) dark secret.In exploring that secret, and the feelings that Cathy develops for black gardener Raymond(Dennis Haysbert from ""24""), Haynes shows us that the nostalgic feel we have for the idyllic life of the 50's was very much a sham.  Racial divisiveness, bigotry, homophobia and secret dual lives....they all existed, and were covered by a thin veneer of pretense in our society.  Because journalists and movie makers were not allowed to portray the seamier side of life, we all think of life in the era as picture perfect, based on the films that WERE made.  Haynes doesn't let us keep this illusion, but despite his beautiful imagery, the picture perfect costuming, the score,  his pace and his skill with the details in a film, it would all be for naught if he were not working with the caliber of the actors that he drew.  Haynes prior efforts are notable but little known, ""Safe"", ""Poison"" and ""Velvet Goldmine""  being the most widely distributed, and he's worked with topics like homophobia and flaunting social mores, as well as with  Julianne Moore before.  This time he brings out the best in her - and she was my favorite for the Best Actress Oscar.If you can get beyond Moore's ethereal beauty, you'll doubtless recognize the depth she brings to a character.  It's true that no one of Cathy Whitaker's background would have probably taken the bull by the horns as openly as she does in her relationship with Raymond,but Moore plays it believably.  We ache for her.  Both Quaid and Haysbert give masterful and understated performances - Quaid as a man driven by his needs which he's bottled up successfully inside him, his whole life, and Haysbert, as a man of uncommon dignity, who is forced by society to live in the shadow of his own needs and feelings.The performances and the uncommon beauty of the film will linger with you long after the tale is finished; but don't miss the extra features of the DVD - so much of what makes this an exceptional picture is mapped out for you that the film takes on even more meaning.Far From Heaven - a definite must see!",5,The film transcends the tale....,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,2602,"['Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'film', 'perfect', 'family', 'life', 'Whitakers', 'just', 'always', 'saw', 'TV', 'shows', 'era', 'director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'was', 'shooting', 'look', 'perfect', 'look', '50', 'only', 'really', 'existed', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'staging', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'home', 'backdrops', 'stark', 'contrast', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'family', 'Nothing', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'dark', 'secret.In', 'exploring', 'secret', 'feelings', 'Cathy', 'black', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', '24', 'Haynes', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'have', 'idyllic', 'life', '50', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'sham', 'Racial', 'divisiveness', 'bigotry', 'homophobia', 'secret', 'dual', 'lives', '.they', 'existed', 'were', 'covered', 'thin', 'veneer', 'pretense', 'society', 'journalists', 'movie', 'makers', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'portray', 'seamier', 'side', 'life', 'think', 'life', 'era', 'picture', 'perfect', 'based', 'films', 'WERE', 'made', 'Haynes', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'illusion', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'picture', 'perfect', 'costuming', 'score', 'pace', 'skill', 'details', 'film', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'naught', 'were', 'not', 'working', 'caliber', 'actors', 'drew', 'Haynes', 'prior', 'efforts', 'are', 'notable', 'little', 'known', 'Safe', 'Poison', 'Velvet', 'Goldmine', 'being', 'most', 'widely', 'distributed', 'worked', 'topics', 'homophobia', 'flaunting', 'social', 'mores', 'as', 'well', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'time', 'out', 'best', 'was', 'favorite', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar.If', 'can', 'get', 'Moore', 'ethereal', 'beauty', ""'ll"", 'doubtless', 'recognize', 'depth', 'character', 'true', 'one', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'taken', 'bull', 'horns', 'as', 'openly', 'relationship', 'Raymond', 'Moore', 'believably', 'ache', 'Quaid', 'Haysbert', 'give', 'masterful', 'understated', 'performances', 'Quaid', 'man', 'driven', 'needs', 'bottled', 'up', 'successfully', 'whole', 'life', 'Haysbert', 'man', 'uncommon', 'dignity', 'who', 'forced', 'society', 'live', 'shadow', 'own', 'needs', 'feelings.The', 'performances', 'uncommon', 'beauty', 'film', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'tale', 'finished', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'exceptional', 'picture', 'mapped', 'out', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'meaning.Far', 'Heaven', 'definite', 'must', 'see']",N/A

603479,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JLQH,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 4]","Julianne Moore was magnificent in both ""The Hours,"" as a suburban 1940's housewife, unhappy with her life and family, hiding repressed sexual feelings toward her best friend, Kitty, and in ""Far From Heaven,"" as a 1950's housewife whose husband is hiding his homosexuality, but is unable to control his sexual feelings toward members of the same sex. This made me wonder, can an actress be nominated for two Oscars in the same year--one for Best Actress and one for Best Supporting Actress? She certainly deserves it. Julianne Moore is most certainly an exceptional artist, playing her roles with renewed vigor and great emotion. While both story-lines may sound incredibly similar, the character of Cathy in ""Far From Heaven"" cannot be more different than that of Laura Brown in ""The Hours,"" and Moore plays both characters wonderfully. Cathy is a loving wife, devoted to her husband and two children. She is living the perfect 1950's suburban life, until her husband's secret obsession threatens to tear their family apart. Dennis Quaid is superb as her husband, and Dennis Haysbert is surprisingly successful in his portrayal of the man who comforts Cathy in her time of need. The feel for the era is most certainly there, and Todd Haynes does a brilliant job of directing, as well as adding little touches here and there. This is much like a sitcom from the 50's, which quickly takes a few drastic turns. Sexuality and racism are explored as things take a turn for the worse. ""Far From Heaven"" is truly engrossing, wih great performances all around, including Patricia Clarkson, an underrated actress who plays best friend to Cathy. This is a heart-felt and powerful film.

603480,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JLQH,Matthew Gladney,"[9, 21]","I came out of the theater after seeing ""Far From Heaven"" wondering what, exactly, the point was of the movie. It still baffles me, weeks later. Perhaps I am putting too much thought into it, and should just accept it at face value, but I know too much of the backstory to be able to do that. The film is most definitely cohesive in its structure, and there are many, many superb elements to it. There are, unfortunately, enough shaky elements that I felt confounded, harangued and even slightly irked with the picture as a whole. But, maybe I just didn't 'get it'?Cathy and Frank Whitaker (Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid) are an affluent middle-class couple living in gorgeous, tree-lined Connecticut, with precisely two children and one big, spacious house. Frank is a successful executive for the Magnatech company, and he and his lovely wife frequently host dinner parties for the town's powerful and well-to-do. Everything seems perfect, until Frank starts to act upon his hidden, homosexual urges. He starts frequenting gay bars, and even invites a man up to his office after hours. Meanwhile, as their marriage is slowly slipping away, Cathy begins to take an interest, purely friendly at first, in their gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert). Soon, however, Cathy is seeking possibly more than just a friendship with the African-American gentleman.""Far From Heaven"" is set during the 1950s, and, according to all the articles regarding the film, it attempts to evoke the look and feel of films made during that decade, particularly those directed by Douglas Sirk. The only Douglas Sirk film which I've seen thus far is ""Imitation of Life"". I suppose there are slight similarities, but not much. The link is supposedly stronger to another Sirk feature, ""All That Heaven Allows"". The look of ""Far From Heaven"" is right - the beautiful autumnal leaves, in all their glorious colors, cascade down from the trees in every shot, adding soft tones to the events of the film. The set design is spot-on. The acting is quite good, by all involved. Julianne Moore is especially exceptional. My quibbles lie with the feel of the film, portions of its script, and with the overall direction.The director of ""Far From Heaven"", Todd Haynes, has said that he set out to make a 1950's movie that couldn't have been made in the 1950s, due to the social mores and inhibitions of the time. We therefore are shown the budding friendship/attraction between Cathy Whitaker and Raymond Deagan, a caucasion woman and an African-American man. If it is still a somewhat infrequent coupling today, it most certainly was social heresy at the time this movie is set in. The film reflects this. There are whispers and negative opinions voiced. But the obvious tilt of ""Far From Heaven"" is that those whispers and voices are wrong. And that's fine. I agree. But, it makes me wonder, do people really want to be hit over the head with such a preachy motion picture? While racism in the 1950s was deplorable, we have thankfully, for the most part, moved on from that now. I can't see what the point is of re-hashing it.And as for the side-story of Frank Whitaker's homosexual affair? That is another odd thing. The emphasis is, at first, on Frank's dalliances, his insecurities with his own sexuality. Then, he proclaims that it is wrong, that he wants to be 'cured', and then the story shifts more toward Cathy and Raymond's romantic interest. The character of Frank is portrayed as volatile, confused, angry, and a home-breaker. This is the homosexual representation in the film. I found it unreasonable, and short-changed.""Far From Heaven"" may have sounded intriguing on paper, but it is flawed in its execution. The set design, acting, and cinematography are all excellent. Unfortunately, parts of the screenplay hampers the overall flow of the film, and I did not feel as though the directing was reminiscent enough of the camera shots and pacing of a true 1950's movie. Too bad.

It also has one great performance by an actress in Julianne Moore's portrayal of Cathy Whitaker. I found the film mesmerizing, as well as meaningful. Though the story is easy to follow, it will prove too studied and `old fashioned' for many viewers. I suppose that to appreciate it fully, one must love movies. A knowledge of history is also helpful, as the film presumes that the audience is knowledgeable of the way society in America was in 1957.Kathy and her husband, Frank [Dennis Quaid], live in a lovely New Haven, CT suburb. They are a popular couple with two young children. Frank is a successful executive at a TV manufacturing company, while Kathy is active in charity work and in local arts groups. They are representative of the burgeoning middle class which sprung up after WWII. Still painfully aware of that dreadful conflict and blessed with a multitude of technological advances, the American people were consumed with creating a bright, beautiful, almost utopian world for themselves and their children. But life, of course, doesn't operate in a vacuum, nor does emotion. Desire and change have lives of their own. Underneath Frank and Kathy's perfectionist existence lies the truth about themselves and the world. Slowly but surely, reality wrecks their shimmering, idealistic construction.The cinematography by Edward Lachman is gorgeous, and the set designs by Ellen Christiansen are about as close to the look of 1950s suburbia as you will ever see onscreen.

With career altering performances from the wonderfully dynamic Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid, the film intricately breaks down a seemingly perfect family's demise.Julianne Moore flawlessly portrays Cathy Whitaker, a seemingly faultless 50&#65533;s housewife, and Dennis Quaid nails the part of her homosexual husband.  From the gorgeous opening sequence to the purposefully colorless ending, the perfect fifties housewife&#65533;s image is tainted through her budding relationship with her black gardener (superbly played by Dennis Haysbert), and her corporate giant of a husband falls victim to his own demons, resulting in a crack in the surface of the family&#65533;s image.  As time progresses, the crack severs the family completely, and the picture perfect family from the opening sequence become but a memory.This film is an amazing glance at the prejudices in life, not just in this time era, but at all times. The theme of this movie rings true for the entirety of history.  This heartbreaking story is a wonderful addition to anyone&#65533;s collection, movie lover or not; it is breathtaking from all standpoints, and, in my opinion, the best picture of the year.",5,"Astounding, moving look at life in general",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,1348,"['controversial', 'subjects', 'have', 'been', 'addressed', 'years', 'homosexuality', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'are', 'analyzed', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'career', 'altering', 'performances', 'wonderfully', 'dynamic', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'film', 'intricately', 'down', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'family', 'demise.Julianne', 'Moore', 'flawlessly', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'seemingly', 'faultless', '50', '65533', 's', 'housewife', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'part', 'homosexual', 'husband', 'gorgeous', 'opening', 'sequence', 'purposefully', 'colorless', 'ending', 'perfect', 'fifties', 'housewife', '65533', 's', 'image', 'tainted', 'budding', 'relationship', 'black', 'gardener', 'superbly', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'corporate', 'giant', 'husband', 'victim', 'own', 'demons', 'resulting', 'crack', 'surface', 'family', '65533', 's', 'image', 'time', 'crack', 'family', 'completely', 'picture', 'perfect', 'family', 'opening', 'sequence', 'become', 'memory.This', 'film', 'amazing', 'glance', 'prejudices', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'time', 'era', 'times', 'theme', 'movie', 'true', 'entirety', 'history', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'anyone', '65533', 's', 'collection', 'movie', 'lover', 'not', 'breathtaking', 'standpoints', 'opinion', 'best', 'picture', 'year']",N/A

A parallel story line explores a budding, sinfully sensuous relationship between wife and black gardener. The movie juxtaposes the two forbidden desires in an attempt to sort out the greater of two evils. The movie is wonderfully filmed with all the accoutrements of 1950s motif. Dress, language, style, d&eacute;nouement . . . all accurately reflects the period. Although I did find many of the interactions between the wife and her taboo desire unrealistic for the era, I was able to take the movie fantasy plunge and stay engaged with the story line. The film moves slowly at times however, excellent acting by the cast help keep the slow periods from being out right boring.Overall a enjoyable flick.

603486,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JLQH,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[43, 49]","""Far from Heaven"" is Todd Haynes' homage and attempt to recreate what was called, in the 50's and 60's, a ""weepie,"" a domestic melodrama with all the attendant production values: lush musical score, sumptuous costumes and a heroine with big concerns/problems mostly having to do with Love, Family and usually both. Think ""Written on the Wind,"" ""Magnificent Obsession"" or ""All that Heaven Allows."" The problem with this kind of a venture is that in order for it to work it must be handled in a non-ironic, straightforward manner. Haynes's and his actors succeed most but not 100% of the time. The very nature of an enterprise like this calls for a somewhat arch and precise acting technique as we are dealing with a dead genre probably farther removed from our 2002 reality than are Shakespeare's plays.Like the best of these films, ""Far from Heaven"" can be unbelievably moving; when we are not only marveling at the gorgeous mise en scene but when the superior acting abilities of the amazing Julianne Moore as Cathy shine through.Cathy and her husband Frank (Dennis Quaid) lead a tranquil life in Connecticut where beautiful and well-put together Cathy is slowly withering away, being eaten alive by the fact that her perfect life is irrevocably punctured when she catches her husband in the arms of another man. But this is not all. Cathy's natural openness towards everyone she comes across as well as her empathy for other races specifically her African American gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert) is also causing gossip among her friends and her neighbors. The outwardly disapproving and disgusted looks on the townspeople's faces when Cathy is with Raymond are laughable in one way but in another really goes to the heart of race relations then as well as now.  Has much changed in this regard in the last 44 years?There is a very poignant scene in which Frank slaps Cathy across the face and Cathy, always the understanding one, reassures him that all is ""fine"" but then pathetically asks him to bring her some ice to quell the swelling. She tells her friend, Eleonor (Patricia Clarkson): ""Frank didn't mean to hit me."" Frank, in a kind of homosexual panic, lashes out at Cathy, the one person who loves and accepts him; as well as the one who reminds him on a daily basis that his love for her is a lie. The scene in which Frank asks Cathy for a divorce is a stunner: watch Moore's eyes and body language. Even when her heart seems about to explode, her eyes remain dry, calm and understanding even in this harrowing and unspeakable situation.So as not to portray her as the ultimate victim, Haynes has smartly imbued Cathy with a strong desire to change from the all accepting, never questioning woman she's been to the strong, independent woman she aches to become. Her heartbreaking attempts to contact the N.A.A.C.P to volunteer are both incredibly nave yet strongly sympathetic.Heaven to Cathy Whitaker is a place in which she is always loved, always valued, forever cherished.

603487,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JLQH,Michael Butts,"[2, 3]","Director Todd Haynes is to be commended in his approach to FAR FROM HEAVEN.  A throwback to the 50's weepers like ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS, BACK STREET and IMITATION OF LIFE, he wisely chose not to parody or ridicule them; he lovingly made this movie in homage to those films.  The cinematography is lush and gorgeous; Elmer Bernstein's score is appropriately romantic and melodramatic; it really looks like the fifties.Julianne Moore's performance is letter perfect:  she has the Susan Hayward/Lana Turner style down to a pat, but infuses it with a deep passion and strength.  Many times her dialogue with her husband Frank and her children seems so Donna Reedish, but once we understand just how manipulated she has been, we can understand it.  Only in her scenes with her gardener, Raymond, do we see the woman Moore could have been.Dennis Quaid matches Moore's performance with his portrayal of Frank, the husband who is cheating on her---with other men.  His internal anguish, guilt, and shame are hidden well at first, but when he breaks down, there is an honest gut-wrenching catharsis.Dennis Haysbert plays Raymond, the gardener, who uses his quiet strength and empathy to show Moore the true meaning of friendship and love.  Of course, in the fifties a romance for these two is unthinkable so we're left with a bittersweet resolution to this.Rounding out the cast is Patricia Clarkson, who plays Moore's ""closest and dearest friend"" who is there for her when it comes to adjusting to life without Frank, but cannot tolerate the thought that Moore is having an affair with a black man.So many reverse standards in this film:  for instance, when Quaid hears rumors that his wife is messing around with Haysbert, he is furious...odd isn't it, that it's okay for him to break a sexual taboo, but not her.FAR FROM HEAVEN doesn't have a crucial showdown scene, and the ending is pretty straightforward and dry, so it's not what one would call a happy ending.Still, it's a very well made movie and Haynes and crew should be proud of this accomplishment.",4,ANGELS IN WAITING,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2053,"['Director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'be', 'commended', 'approach', 'FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'throwback', '50', 'weepers', 'ALL', 'THAT', 'HEAVEN', 'ALLOWS', 'BACK', 'STREET', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'wisely', 'chose', 'not', 'parody', 'ridicule', 'lovingly', 'made', 'movie', 'homage', 'films', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'gorgeous', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'appropriately', 'romantic', 'melodramatic', 'really', 'fifties.Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'letter', 'perfect', 'Susan', 'Hayward/Lana', 'Turner', 'style', 'down', 'pat', 'deep', 'passion', 'strength', 'Many', 'times', 'dialogue', 'husband', 'Frank', 'children', 'so', 'Donna', 'Reedish', 'once', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'manipulated', 'been', 'can', 'understand', 'Only', 'scenes', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'do', 'see', 'woman', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'been.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Moore', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'Frank', 'husband', 'who', 'cheating', '-with', 'other', 'men', 'internal', 'anguish', 'guilt', 'shame', 'are', 'hidden', 'well', 'first', 'when', 'down', 'honest', 'gut-wrenching', 'catharsis.Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Raymond', 'gardener', 'who', 'quiet', 'strength', 'empathy', 'show', 'Moore', 'true', 'meaning', 'friendship', 'love', 'course', 'fifties', 'romance', 'two', 'unthinkable', ""'re"", 'left', 'bittersweet', 'resolution', 'this.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'Moore', 'closest', 'dearest', 'friend', 'who', 'there', 'when', 'adjusting', 'life', 'Frank', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'thought', 'Moore', 'having', 'affair', 'black', 'man.So', 'many', 'reverse', 'standards', 'film', 'instance', 'when', 'Quaid', 'rumors', 'wife', 'messing', 'Haysbert', 'furious', 'odd', ""n't"", 'okay', 'break', 'sexual', 'taboo', 'not', 'her.FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', ""n't"", 'have', 'crucial', 'showdown', 'scene', 'ending', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'dry', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'happy', 'ending.Still', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'Haynes', 'crew', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'accomplishment']",N/A

Moore,"[4, 7]","Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven"" is such a letter-perfect recreation of Fifties weepers that you need a little time after seeing the movie to appreciate the true depth and breadth of Haynes' accomplishment. At first the movie seems a straightforward soap opera, with a few knowing digs at the racist and homophobic prejudices of the Eisenhower era. Then the film's irony slowly grows on you, until you realize that Haynes has his cake and has eaten it too: the film works both on the surface as a soap opera and as a deeply ironic commentary on ""American"" values that still go woefully underexamined today. The multiple layers of meaning in ""Far from Heaven"" become apparent only in retrospect, after one has had time to ponder them. The depth and heartfelt emotion of the performances of Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid and Dennis Haysbert, however, are obvious from the start, and the dazzling, hypnotic colors of Edward Lachman's photography make you long for the days of Technicolor. This ranks with ""Black Narcissus"" for its intoxicating and symbolic use of color.

Her charmed life is shattered when she learns that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is homosexual. She takes comfort in a friendship with her Black gardener (Dennis Haysbert), only to find that her affection for him endangers both of their families. ""Far From Heaven"" is Cathy's gradual discovery that real ugliness, cruelty and  hypocrisy lie beneath the surface of her heavenly world.Written and directed by Todd Haynes, ""Far From Heaven"" both emulates and scrutinizes  1950's America with its stylized environments, vivid colors, and well-manicured everyone and everything. The first thing the viewer notices about this film is certainly its astonishingly vivid colors. I don't think I've ever seen such colors in a movie before. They are more saturated than Technicolor. Still photographers will recognize Far From Heaven's hues as looking a lot like Fujichrome Velvia, but of course it couldn't be as that is not a movie film. I am not normally a fan of super-saturated colors, but it is so striking and unusual to see in a modern film that I thoroughly enjoyed looking at this movie. Its Oscar nomination for cinematography is well-deserved. Moving past appearances, Far From Heaven closely resembles a 1950's melodrama in its exploration of the trials and tribulations of the most perfect suburban housewife that the world has ever known. What separates it from the melodramas of the past that it emulates so precisely is that Far From Heaven's housewife is dealing with life-changing problems that could not be spoken of in suburban 1950's America or in the films of the time. And the fact that they could not be publicly discussed in that society is precisely what makes these issues into problems. The issues in question are: homosexuality, racial hypocrisy, and women circumscribed by double standards. We see the consequences of these social taboos so clearly because Cathy Whitaker really is the self-sacrificing, beautiful and perfect housewife of legend. Her appearance genuinely reflects her character, and so she suffers the hypocrisies of her society when unspeakable realities invade her life. The performances in Far From Heaven are fantastic. I cannot praise Julianne Moore enough. Cathy Whitaker could easily come across as being a cartoonish or satirical character, but Julianne Moore makes her completely sincere and sympathetic.

Julianne Moore looked stunning and even more beautiful in person. Awards are already beginning to stack up for Julianne Moore.  She has already won the Best Actress award at the Venice International Film Festival this past September 2002.  Just recently she picked up the Best Actress award from the National Board of Review.  Halle Berry won it last year before going on to win the Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"", so that's a really good omen.  After watching the film I was very moved by the the subject matter and especially the performances. I have to say that Julianne Moore is the one to beat for this year's Best Actress Oscar. I have not seen a stronger performance by a woman this year then one she gave in this film. I would have to agree with Peter Travers of Rollingstone Magazine in saying that ""Moore and Quaid give the performances of their careers."" Moore simply transformed into Cathy. With the blonde hair, 50's era clothing and cheerful mask of insecurity, she became the character of Cathy in every way imaginable. One thing that Moore has such amazing talent for as an actress is restraint. Never do you get the feeling that she is ""acting"" but just ""being"" which is some much more powerful for the viewer to watch. You can read so much from her facial expressions and they way she executes the dialogue. A perfect example would be from the trailer where she says, ""I feel like there's no one in the world that I can talk to."" You somehow relate and feel for her. I know a lot of you have the heard the expression, ""the eyes are the doorways to the soul."" Well it is so resonately true when watching Moore's powerful performance. Now I know a number of people have already negatively criticized the film for being ""too stylized"" but I don't even want to waste my energy debating the matter. All I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Todd Hayes definitely succeeded in transforming and reviving the tired and bland film genre of melodrama by making it his own. Bravo to him and Julianne Moore for making it so subtly powerful.

There, I said it. &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; is director, Todd Haynes attempt at emulating 'Sirk'. In that respect, the film succeeds. It is riddled with lush photography and set in the 1950's - which helps. But as a film of today, it miserably flops. Like Sirk's &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; concerns a dutiful wife, Kathy (on this occasion played by Julianne Moore) who discovers that her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid) is not all that he appears to be. And like Sirk's &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; there is a hint of tempered racial tension and interracial romance (between Raymond [Dennis Haysbert] and Kathy) that sneaks into the proceedings. But if anything, &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; proves that you can't go back to the well twice - as it were - and relive the past without being compared and judged inferior to it. Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid aren't very engaging as a couple and the racial undertones are played from a safe distance. Director, Todd Haynes' photography is too lush, at times appearing as garishly cartoonish - something that Sirk was never guilty of - and the plot, such as it is, seems better suited for a segment on &quot;General Hospital&quot; than mainstream Hollywood film-making. Ironically, it was Sirk's influence through films like &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; that paved the way for television to take its cue and cultivate the soap opera on the small screen. In retrospect, that premise works. The other way around ? it?s an embarrassment. Besides, &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; plays it safe at every turn, eschewing biases and bigotry and ending on a very postmodern unhappy note that Sirk would never have approved of.The transfer perfectly captures Haynes' intent. Colors are rich, vibrant and nicely balanced. Black and contrast levels are accurately rendered. There is a considerable amount of edge enhancement and some shimmering of fine details. No pixelization though. The soundtrack is 5.1 and adequately rendered. The extras include a very self-congratulatory featurette in which Hayne's explains how he did Douglas Sirk one better. Like Attenborough's remake of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; or Van Sant's shot for shot remake of &quot;Psycho&quot; - it simply can't be done!

Gorgues hue palettes of synapse-singing orange and red permeate every precisely mounted frame, to say nothing of the amount of fifties mise-en-scene, costume and orchestral detail. Fans of affectionate fifties American melodrama (are there any out there?) will relish in the abundant references to Douglas Sirk's films (especially 'All that heaven allows'), and it is impossible not to smile when this film so subtly and subversively makes use of fifties editing staples (love those dissolves).Julianne Moore plays the put upon upper middle class housewife, Dennis Quaid her closet homosexual husband and Dennis Haysbert plays the families' landscaper whom Moore befriends with disasterous consequences (social ostracism from her nattering social aquintances and the same for him from his community). All the topics at hand- homosexuality, interracial love, the oppression of women, all enveloped in the staples of womens pictures of the period (hard drinking, malice, home-wrecking and tearful sacrifice) are handled with the utmost, most straight-faced care by Haynes, not allowing any type of post-modern ('oh really, how quaint!) referents for the audience to titter knowingly at.In fact, the whole project has been pulled off with such aplomb that one feels a little guilty at having to undermine the work , but.....As has been the case with other straight faced re-interpretations (such as the much maligned Gus Van Sant remake of 'Psycho'), the whole film and its contents seem stilted, mannered and aloof. This was certainly the desired effect, and the form/style suits the content perfectly. The film tries to debunk the myths of domestic melodrama's, adding a deeper layer of sexual/ relational meaning unmentionable at the time. Sure. The problem is that this is the only thing the film even tries to achieve. It is a mere novelty, a subjunctive 'what if'. I'm sure that most people are willing to realize that instances of homosexuality, interracial romance, etc did occur in the fifties, that it more often than not ruined careers and social heirarchies and set tongues a wagging, or was simply denied, blanketed or, indeed, remained unmentioned. This is no major epiphany.After a while, the ingeniousness of the (single) idea wears off and all that is left is the films leaden pacing, grating sappiness and the collective symbolism of a fifties melodramas, with all loose ends tied up unambiguously (which is necessary to remain true to form, granted). The result is a resounding 'so what'?Still, this film is a rare beast indeed: a thoughtful, languid, self-reflexively contemplative film made by a Hollywood studio in 2003. A perfect antidote to the sturm and drang of the latest wave of latex-infused CG superhero piffle thrust at audiences at any and every opportunity.

After seeing the DVD version of the movie, I am sure that no one would object that it is quite an ambitious which is determined to deal with two unspeakable and sensitive subjects in the 60s - Racism and Homosexuality. The movie starts with a big suspense when Frank Whitaker was confused about his own sexual orientation. Then, the plot is strengthened by certain black issues and the narrow-mindedness of the people in a small town. In order to perform as a archetypal wife, Cathy Whitaker (starred by the charming Julianne Moore) puts up with rumours and gossips by the people in the neighbourhood. She could hardly liberate herself from both the racial stereotypes and the interruption of her marriage owing to her husband's coming-out. In the movie, the racial issue is well-plotted, with a beginning and an end. However, I am slightly disappointed that homosexuality is not that confronted bravely and it is left a bit dangling somewhere in the story, seemingly unfinished.

I was lucky to see it in a grand old theater with a huge chandelier and multi-tiered seating so I gladly sat all the way in the back to absorb the grandeur of both the setting and the film.I really do like Julianne Moore as a actress.  What I like most about her is that she often seems if not guileless than a little unaware of the entirety of whats going on as a character with most films.  Here she really plays with what a wife is aware of and what she isn't.  Dennis Quaid also has a nice performance as a man seething with a lot of secrets and anger.  I think its simplistic to make this about his character's homosexuality or even his wife's daliance with an interracial love affair, it's about the seduction of the ""taboo"" and the vim it interjects into their lives.For her it is a Black man and for him, it is breaking one lifestyle to choose another.  Using 1950's as a backdrop of repression and also a controlling force that boxes all of these characters in.  Its inspired to use a timeframe as the opposing force but it's also a way of adding texture to this film visually.  The women's fashions, the suburban settings, the thoughtframe even down to a little boy putting his feet in a pool and all the white people fleeing because he's black.  The work here on race is stronger than the pieces on sexuality because there is a clear cut yes or no, to Quaid's character and his sexuality.  Either he will stay married and have secret daliance or he will come out, to at least his wife and himself, and leave her for a man.  The movie loses one star from me because it can't quite pierce the sexuality taboo as well as it does the race one.Julianne Moore's character is castigated and vilified by those closest to her in friendship and even at one point her husband, in a true double standard moment, because of her friendship with the black gardner.  The fact that she pushes further and further, goes with the man to an all black club and receives the same treatment from black as eventually she receives from white.  The super part is the observation of what it must be like to be a Black man going to a museum opening in a town full of white people, the museum full of white people.  That Moore's character makes that empathic observation is what makes this movie stellar.  And then the reverse when she goes to an all Black club that amongst Black people, shocked and dismayed and frightened at her presence, is both observed by her, at first in a feeling of being used and then as a silent agreement of mutual defiance.The fact that Quaid's secret relationship isn't explored as much also bespeaks to the yes or no of sexuality verses race.  Either he is or he isn't.  He will or he won't.  And eventually he does, but when he breaks down and tells his wife, the strongest part of his performance is his admittance of having never been in honest love before and experiencing that and how torn he is.  Since this happens off camera after a brief scene of attraction between him and another says that the film chooses the stronger storyline of race.Moore's character eventually sees that as Dennis Haysberry the man she loves, is leaving after a racial attack on his daughter, she could possibly, now single, explore a relationship with him.  But Haysberry is wiser about the world than she is, he knows that its the time, the 1950's that is truly keeping them apart, not convention or lack of possibility.Though it may on the surface seem like a sad movie initially I think that it sings of rdemption of one's truest self through exploration of the taboo that both desire.  Going to say good-bye to HAysberry at the train station is bittersweet but I got the feeling that Moore's character has possibility, that she's learned from her husband that when you find what it is that truly gives you passion, you have to go after it.I thought to myself a lot during the film that she was trapped because she was expected to take care of her children and the film bears this out.  Its also speaking to the ability for men to 180 degrees turn around in their desires but that women of that time were locked into the roles they'd played out.Moore doesn't have a traditional breakdown scene because this is all played against the milieu of an older movie framework, language, style, mood so she has melodrama but not the raw emotinal rending one expects from Moore, but here it fits.Four stars because her relationship is so well examined and Quaid's isn't as deeply.  ...Julianne Moore deserves an Oscar, for something, for all of her work and Dennis Quaid whose face looks older still had the charisma and form of someone willing to take risks with himself.  There's a nice balance in actors like him who are willing to work at being great actors, regardless of what the perception of them may be.  That kind of courage is what makes great films and artists and work.",4,Terrific Film,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,4900,"['really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'was', 'lucky', 'see', 'grand', 'old', 'theater', 'huge', 'chandelier', 'multi-tiered', 'seating', 'gladly', 'sat', 'way', 'back', 'absorb', 'grandeur', 'setting', 'film.I', 'really', 'do', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'actress', 'What', 'like', 'most', 'often', 'not', 'guileless', 'little', 'unaware', 'entirety', 'whats', 'going', 'character', 'most', 'films', 'Here', 'really', 'what', 'wife', 'aware', 'what', ""n't"", 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'also', 'nice', 'performance', 'man', 'seething', 'lot', 'secrets', 'anger', 'think', 'simplistic', 'make', 'character', 'homosexuality', 'even', 'wife', 'daliance', 'interracial', 'love', 'affair', 'seduction', 'taboo', 'vim', 'lives.For', 'Black', 'man', 'breaking', 'one', 'lifestyle', 'choose', 'Using', '1950', 'backdrop', 'repression', 'also', 'controlling', 'force', 'characters', 'inspired', 'use', 'timeframe', 'opposing', 'force', 'also', 'way', 'adding', 'texture', 'film', 'visually', 'women', 'fashions', 'suburban', 'settings', 'thoughtframe', 'even', 'down', 'little', 'boy', 'putting', 'feet', 'pool', 'white', 'people', 'fleeing', 'black', 'work', 'here', 'race', 'stronger', 'pieces', 'sexuality', 'clear', 'cut', 'yes', 'Quaid', 'character', 'sexuality', 'will', 'stay', 'married', 'have', 'secret', 'daliance', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'least', 'wife', 'leave', 'man', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pierce', 'sexuality', 'taboo', 'as', 'well', 'race', 'Moore', 'character', 'castigated', 'vilified', 'closest', 'friendship', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'husband', 'true', 'double', 'standard', 'moment', 'friendship', 'black', 'gardner', 'fact', 'further', 'further', 'man', 'black', 'club', 'same', 'treatment', 'black', 'eventually', 'white', 'super', 'part', 'observation', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'Black', 'man', 'going', 'museum', 'opening', 'town', 'full', 'white', 'people', 'museum', 'full', 'white', 'people', 'Moore', 'character', 'empathic', 'observation', 'what', 'movie', 'stellar', 'then', 'reverse', 'when', 'Black', 'club', 'Black', 'people', 'shocked', 'dismayed', 'frightened', 'presence', 'observed', 'first', 'feeling', 'being', 'used', 'then', 'silent', 'agreement', 'mutual', 'defiance.The', 'fact', 'Quaid', 'secret', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'explored', 'much', 'also', 'yes', 'sexuality', 'verses', 'race', ""n't"", 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'when', 'down', 'tells', 'wife', 'strongest', 'part', 'performance', 'admittance', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'honest', 'love', 'experiencing', 'how', 'torn', 'off', 'camera', 'brief', 'scene', 'attraction', 'film', 'stronger', 'storyline', 'race.Moore', 'character', 'eventually', 'Dennis', 'Haysberry', 'man', 'leaving', 'racial', 'attack', 'daughter', 'could', 'possibly', 'now', 'single', 'explore', 'relationship', 'Haysberry', 'wiser', 'world', 'time', '1950', 'truly', 'keeping', 'apart', 'not', 'convention', 'lack', 'may', 'surface', 'seem', 'sad', 'movie', 'initially', 'think', 'rdemption', 'one', 'truest', 'self', 'exploration', 'taboo', 'desire', 'Going', 'say', 'good-bye', 'HAysberry', 'train', 'station', 'bittersweet', 'got', 'feeling', 'Moore', 'character', 'possibility', 'learned', 'husband', 'when', 'find', 'what', 'truly', 'passion', 'have', 'go', 'it.I', 'thought', 'myself', 'lot', 'film', 'was', 'trapped', 'was', 'expected', 'take', 'care', 'children', 'film', 'out', 'also', 'speaking', 'ability', 'men', '180', 'degrees', 'turn', 'around', 'desires', 'women', 'time', 'were', 'locked', 'roles', ""'d"", 'played', 'out.Moore', ""n't"", 'have', 'traditional', 'breakdown', 'scene', 'played', 'milieu', 'older', 'movie', 'framework', 'language', 'style', 'mood', 'so', 'melodrama', 'not', 'raw', 'emotinal', 'rending', 'one', 'Moore', 'here', 'fits.Four', 'stars', 'relationship', 'so', 'well', 'examined', 'Quaid', ""n't"", 'as', 'deeply', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Oscar', 'something', 'work', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'face', 'older', 'still', 'had', 'charisma', 'form', 'someone', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'nice', 'balance', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'work', 'being', 'great', 'actors', 'regardless', 'what', 'perception', 'may', 'be', 'kind', 'courage', 'what', 'great', 'films', 'artists', 'work']",N/A

Forget about the spoilers, the film does not have any or much of plot which can be explained in as few words as - repressed homosexual family man (Denis Quaid virtually playing a depressed Harrison Ford!) causes problems in the home which eventually lead to his wife (Julianne Moore) seeking an intimate relationship with her negro gardener in a very talkative and conservative 1950s.What a bore it eventually turns out to be. Do not get me wrong, if you liked films like ""Road to Perdition"" which dish out sentimentality for starters, main course and dessert then this film will be the meal of your day.  The only thing that saves this movie is the performances of the cast but aside from this it stinks to high heaven. Even the 50s credits and overall feel does not save it from being dull, uneventful and sometimes completely motionless. At its core this is a lifeless film with its few moments that work wonders, but these rare situations begin with a hit, hit, hit only to become of domino effect of miss, miss, miss and miss again.There is so much wasted in this movie. For instance there is a wonderful scene where Quaid goes to visit a psychiatrist to help him with his problems, an unbelievably fascinating scene.... but that is the last you see of that again.You will probably be suckered into this movie by hearing that it is a tribute to the 50s movie era. Wrong - if this film was made in the 50s it may have got some acclaim, standing behind the ranks of movies like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", but its tribute values fly out the door when the film just seems to hang in parts like a painting that has just tilted to one side. There is very little here worth a damn except for the performances but even Moore, acting her brainless characters heart out, can not stop this viewer from smashing onto the ground face first from the couch.

Her own world just seems to be shattered and she tries desperately to recover her husband Frank (Dennis Quaid) from homosexual back to heterosexual. On the other sides, there is a rumor state that she has an affair with his family gardener Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert). Other than that, this movie was all about racism on 50's, etiquette, social events and an overall desire to keep up with the Joneses.I will not give away the whole story and the ending. If you want to know what happened in the movie, please watch it yourself, and I highly recommend it.The acting of this movie was superb and fabulous.

603503,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00005JLQH,Paul McGrath,"[22, 44]","The problem with this movie, like so many other Hollywood movies these days, is that instead of attempting to imitate life, it attempts to create a perception of life, in this case, as it existed in 1950's America.  A fictional account of fiction, as it were.  It is therefore robbed of any potential statement it may have had to make about  its subjects--homosexuality, racism, and to a lesser degree, alcoholism--because nothing in it really resembles the way life was in this time and this place.The first perception is that 1950's suburban America was a dreamland--a heaven--of dreamy, lush landscapes;  beautiful, large homes;  colorful, brightly painted automobiles;  and perfectly coifed hair and clothing.  Every camera angle is shot at eye level, so there are lavish, abundant, autumnal colors in every shot.  A gentle sun shines.  Flower petals cover the sidewalks and lawns.  A regular paradise.  But is this to be believed?  Was upper-middle class life in the fifties really this opulent?  Uhhh, no.  Of course not.  What the filmmakers have created is a fantasy land, and one which we realize almost immediately they are going to attack.The second perception is that everybody in the United States at this time was an unabashed racist.  But this, we know, is not true either.  The film very carefully shows us how upset the neighbors of Ms. Moore's character are at her relationship with the black gardener.  But the reality is, most Americans in her social class--particularly in the north-east--were much more progressive.  With few exceptions, they would have at the very least given lip service to black equality--if perhaps they did not act on it--but they would never have openly spoken against it.  To do so would be to risk being socially ostracized;  to be known as a bigot, or, God forbid, a Republican.  It just didn't happen this way.And then there is the Moore character's relationship with the gardener.  She goes with him one afternoon to a mostly segregated cocktail lounge, has a drink with him, and dances with him.  This is shown so that we can see what effect this is going to have on her backward neighbors.  But this is also not reality.  She is a socially prominent housewife in an affluent suburb.  There is no way she would go anywhere with her gardener--be he black, Hispanic, Japanese, or even white--because not only is he someone who is so obviously beneath her class, but also because of the potential appearance of infidelity.  The film blithely glosses over this, as it so desperately needs a foil to show how restrictive society was.  But it's a pretty heavy-handed point if you have to resort to these tactics to make it.The homosexual angle is handled a little better because, after all, society in the fifties truly attempted to suppress any desire for or even thought of it.  But the movie stumbles here also because it really doesn't know what it wants to say.  Yes, we see Mr. Husband ask his wife for a divorce so that he can be with Mr. Boyfriend.  But is this the ""heaven,"" that the movie purports to show the fifties as being so far from?  With a broken family left behind?  With a smirking boyfriend who may or may not really like him?  In a tawdry-looking hotel with a neat scotch in his hand?  Of course, moral ambiguity is often a desirable trait in film or fiction, but as this movie so obviously has an agenda, is it not fair to ask, what is the point?As to be expected in a film like this--in which the actors are asked to play caricatures instead of real human beings--the acting is horrible.  Ms. Moore is a one-dimensional Barbie doll, smiling chirpily and clueless, just as the filmmakers would like you to believe a fifties' mother was.  Mr. Quaid's performance is also stale, as it must be;  first he's the businessman Dad, then the anguished homosexual.  It is done by the numbers, with no freshness or originality.  None of the others are worth mentioning.Perhaps what is most irritating about this film is that it pretends that it is showing us something that we haven't, perhaps, considered before.  Are they serious?  Racism in America?  The suppression of homosexuality?  The stifling effect of suburbia?  These themes have been aired out zillions of times, in fact, to a large degree, in the fifties themselves.  Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, To Kill a Mockingbird, Raisin in the Sun, The Lost Weekend,  Days of Wine and Roses, Rebel Without a Cause;  do I really have to go on?This is not a serious movie.  It is a silly movie.  It is a silly movie made by silly people with only a rudimentary and superficial understanding of our complex society and the spiritual, economic, social and historic forces which shaped it.  As its title suggests, it was apparently made for anybody dense enough to believe that America in the fifties was actually like heaven.  If anybody in the world is truly that vapid, then this movie will almost certainly appeal to them.",1,It's Been Done,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,4926,"['problem', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'days', 'instead', 'attempting', 'imitate', 'life', 'create', 'perception', 'life', 'case', 'existed', '1950', 'America', 'A', 'fictional', 'account', 'fiction', 'were', 'therefore', 'robbed', 'potential', 'statement', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'subjects', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'lesser', 'degree', 'alcoholism', 'nothing', 'really', 'way', 'life', 'was', 'time', 'place.The', 'first', 'perception', '1950', 'suburban', 'America', 'was', 'dreamland', 'heaven', 'dreamy', 'lush', 'landscapes', 'beautiful', 'large', 'homes', 'colorful', 'brightly', 'painted', 'automobiles', 'perfectly', 'coifed', 'hair', 'clothing', 'Every', 'camera', 'angle', 'shot', 'eye', 'level', 'are', 'lavish', 'abundant', 'autumnal', 'colors', 'shot', 'gentle', 'sun', 'shines', 'Flower', 'petals', 'cover', 'sidewalks', 'lawns', 'regular', 'paradise', 'be', 'believed', 'Was', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'life', 'fifties', 'really', 'opulent', 'Uhhh', 'course', 'not', 'What', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'created', 'fantasy', 'land', 'one', 'realize', 'almost', 'immediately', 'are', 'going', 'attack.The', 'second', 'perception', 'everybody', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'was', 'unabashed', 'racist', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'either', 'film', 'very', 'carefully', 'how', 'upset', 'neighbors', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'character', 'are', 'relationship', 'black', 'gardener', 'reality', 'most', 'Americans', 'social', 'class', 'particularly', 'north-east', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'progressive', 'few', 'exceptions', 'would', 'have', 'very', 'least', 'given', 'lip', 'service', 'black', 'equality', 'perhaps', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'openly', 'spoken', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'risk', 'being', 'socially', 'ostracized', 'be', 'known', 'bigot', 'God', 'forbid', 'Republican', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way.And', 'then', 'Moore', 'character', 'relationship', 'gardener', 'one', 'afternoon', 'mostly', 'segregated', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'drink', 'dances', 'shown', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'effect', 'going', 'have', 'backward', 'neighbors', 'also', 'not', 'reality', 'socially', 'prominent', 'housewife', 'affluent', 'suburb', 'way', 'would', 'go', 'anywhere', 'gardener', 'be', 'black', 'Hispanic', 'Japanese', 'even', 'white', 'not', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'obviously', 'class', 'also', 'potential', 'appearance', 'infidelity', 'film', 'blithely', 'so', 'desperately', 'foil', 'show', 'how', 'restrictive', 'society', 'was', 'pretty', 'heavy-handed', 'point', 'have', 'resort', 'tactics', 'make', 'it.The', 'homosexual', 'angle', 'handled', 'little', 'better', 'society', 'fifties', 'truly', 'attempted', 'suppress', 'desire', 'even', 'thought', 'movie', 'stumbles', 'here', 'also', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'Yes', 'see', 'Mr', 'Husband', 'ask', 'wife', 'divorce', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Boyfriend', 'heaven', 'movie', 'show', 'fifties', 'being', 'so', 'far', 'broken', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'smirking', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'tawdry-looking', 'hotel', 'neat', 'scotch', 'hand', 'course', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'often', 'desirable', 'trait', 'film', 'fiction', 'movie', 'so', 'obviously', 'agenda', 'not', 'fair', 'ask', 'what', 'point', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'asked', 'play', 'caricatures', 'instead', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'acting', 'horrible', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'one-dimensional', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'smiling', 'chirpily', 'clueless', 'just', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'fifties', 'mother', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'also', 'stale', 'must', 'be', 'first', 'businessman', 'Dad', 'then', 'anguished', 'homosexual', 'done', 'numbers', 'freshness', 'originality', 'None', 'others', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning.Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'irritating', 'film', 'showing', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'considered', 'Are', 'serious', 'Racism', 'America', 'suppression', 'homosexuality', 'stifling', 'effect', 'suburbia', 'themes', 'have', 'been', 'aired', 'out', 'zillions', 'times', 'fact', 'large', 'degree', 'fifties', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'not', 'serious', 'movie', 'silly', 'movie', 'silly', 'movie', 'made', 'silly', 'people', 'only', 'rudimentary', 'superficial', 'understanding', 'complex', 'society', 'spiritual', 'economic', 'social', 'historic', 'forces', 'shaped', 'title', 'was', 'apparently', 'made', 'anybody', 'dense', 'enough', 'believe', 'America', 'fifties', 'was', 'actually', 'like', 'heaven', 'anybody', 'world', 'truly', 'vapid', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'appeal']",N/A

Well, this devastating, and penetrating, oeuvre d'art rips apart the lies, misconceptions, and half-truths, and reveals America in the 50's for what it truly was: misogynistic, homophobic, and racist.WATCH as the achingly beautiful Julianne Moore struggles to maintain her composure (and coif) as she catches her husband KISSING another MAN!PUZZLE over Dennis Quaid CRACKING UP over losing his family and job because of DARK DESIRES!LAUGH OUT LOUD as Dennis Haysbert (the, uhh, love interest) slow dances with Julianne Moore, in the middle of a sunny afternoon, at a COLORED SPEAK-EASY!SIGH as the NASTY neighbors SPREAD GOSSIP!All of this set to a 50's STYLE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, filmed to look like a 50's STYLE MOVIE!!  The irony of it all!  Boy, just imagine if they actually made movies like this back in the fifties - by now, we'd all be cross-dressing, vegetarian, collective farmers, gulping down anti-depressants like M &amp; M's and longing for someone, anyone, to distract us from gazing at our own inch-deep navels.More than likely, though, if they REALLY had made movies like this back in the fifties, by now anyone with one-quarter of a spine (or more) would be in re-education camps (a/k/a Gulags) being forced to learn about cultural 'heros' like Che, Fidel, and everyone's favorite Comrade, Papa Joe. Sitting through this &quot;IMPORTANT&quot; film can't be all that different (but the films at the Gulag probably have better pacing).",2,"Oh, the Humanity!",1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,1799,"['Life', '50', ""n't"", 'chocolate', 'covered', 'cherry', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'sirree', 'Bob', 'fact', 'corny', 'movies', '50', 'barely', 'put', 'scratch', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'veneer', 'see', 'back', 'then', 'issues', 'racism', 'homosexuality', 'misogyny', 'were', 'big', 'no-nos', 'meaning', 'could', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'such', 'things', 'polite', 'company', 'OR', 'movies', 'Well', 'devastating', 'penetrating', 'oeuvre', ""d'art"", 'rips', 'apart', 'lies', 'misconceptions', 'half-truths', 'reveals', 'America', '50', 'what', 'truly', 'was', 'misogynistic', 'homophobic', 'racist.WATCH', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'maintain', 'composure', 'coif', 'husband', 'KISSING', 'MAN', 'PUZZLE', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'CRACKING', 'UP', 'losing', 'family', 'job', 'DARK', 'DESIRES', 'LAUGH', 'OUT', 'LOUD', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'uhh', 'love', 'interest', 'slow', 'dances', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'middle', 'sunny', 'afternoon', 'COLORED', 'SPEAK-EASY', 'SIGH', 'NASTY', 'neighbors', 'SPREAD', 'GOSSIP', 'set', '50', 'STYLE', 'MOVIE', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'filmed', 'look', '50', 'STYLE', 'MOVIE', 'irony', 'Boy', 'just', 'imagine', 'actually', 'made', 'movies', 'back', 'fifties', 'now', ""'d"", 'be', 'cross-dressing', 'vegetarian', 'collective', 'farmers', 'gulping', 'down', 'anti-depressants', 'M', 'amp', 'M', 'longing', 'someone', 'anyone', 'distract', 'gazing', 'own', 'inch-deep', 'navels.More', 'likely', 'though', 'REALLY', 'had', 'made', 'movies', 'back', 'fifties', 'now', 'anyone', 'one-quarter', 'spine', 'more', 'would', 'be', 're-education', 'camps', 'Gulags', 'being', 'forced', 'learn', 'cultural', ""'heros"", 'Che', 'Fidel', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Comrade', 'Papa', 'Joe', 'Sitting', 'quot', 'IMPORTANT', 'quot', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'different', 'films', 'Gulag', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'pacing']",N/A
603506,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JLQH,"""qmlhcb""","[0, 0]","""Far From Heaven"" is a surprisingly original form of drama. It tells the story of family secrets, acceptance and love stylistically wrapped up in the techniques of 1950's films.The story on its own would be enough to make this a wonderful film, but in telling the story of a family in the 1950s at a confusing time (The husband realizes he is gay, and the wife seeks comfort from her black gardener), it captures the essence of older films to help display the older views on homosexuality and interracial relationships. Every detail of this film is like it's counterparts in 1950's melodrama. The old fashioned acting styles are note perfect for both Julienne Moore and Dennis Quaid, the music is wonderfully recreated, the set designs constructed in the same fashion, even the opening title sequence and end credits look authentic. But most importantly, it all worked perfectly with the story.Lovers of 1950's melodrama will eat this film up, and anyone who can appreciate the guts and talent it took to recreate it so authentically will find much to love. But the story is strong enough on its own to not even need it. Sometimes we forget how harsh mainstream America's views were on some subjects. Sure widespread views homosexuality are still not yet where they should be, but racism and interracial relationships are leagues ahead of where they were 50 years ago.It's too bad this film wasn't nominated for best picture rather then the enjoyable but greatly flawed Gangs of New York.

603507,A1S3IEVZI29T7H,B00005JLQH,"Raider Jack ""Jackie D Gray-Romeyn""","[0, 1]","This movie evokes memories of the grand melodramams that Lana Turner, Susan Hayward, Bette Davis, Anne Baxter (to name a few) generally had a field day with in the 50s.  Reduced to the sexist and unfair misnomer of ""women's movies"" they are classic tear-jerker fare.The appeal of this movie lies in its presentation of two issues that remain quite powerful today:  racism and sexual repression.  This gives one a glimpse of how these two subjects may have been handled together via this genre in the 50s.There is absolutely no question about the performances.  Julianne Moore is simply exquisite as the tortured Cathy whose whole world eventually crumbles before her eyes.  Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job but I suspect this is probably his bravest role as opposed to his strongest performance.  Dennis Haysbert is, as usual, quite good.  His performance is perfectly nuanced and perfectly predictable.This movie however, cries out for a spoof from Carol Burnett.  She could have a field day spoofing the conflicted soul of the quintessenital white woman whose life is crumbling around her. Actually, I think the movie is just hysterical.  There was one scene where Cathy spies an unknown black man (Dennis Haysbert, the gardener)walking in her garden.  She is about to be interviewed for the society page and the interviewer sees him too and both women look as if they have seen Bigfoot or something.  And for those of you who think that it was rare for a college-educated black man in the 50s to be working as a gardener, you need to get a grip.  That was infinitely more common that you would care to think.  Kudos to the production/costume designers - this movie totally captures the texture and mood of the times.This movie stays true to the formula of the 50s melodarams with the traditional wordless goodbyes complete with white gloves, tears, loaded looks, and smashing cymbals in the background for maximum effect all inteneded to give you the distinct impression that while no clear solutions are available, at least we are making steps to change society as a whole.

603511,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JLQH,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[9, 15]","Julianne Moore is one of a very small handful of contemporary actresses whose presence onscreen harkens back to the glory days of Movie Stardom - women like Lana Turner, Veronica Lake, Joan Crawford - and her palpable glamour and undeniable screen presence are a hugely welcome change from the bland bleatings of actresses like Gwyneth, Halle, et al. She's a hugely talented actress, too - in pictures like 'Magnolia' and the sublime 'The Hours' she shows that she's so much more than a pretty face.So why, then, does 'Far from Heaven' fail to create any sort of sympathy for her as a controversy-plagued, love-lorn housewife?Starring Moore as Cathy Whitaker, the film pairs her with Denis Quaid as her wayward, duplicitous husband Frank, and the enormously charismatic Dennis Haysbert as Raymond Deagan, her black gardener with whom Cathy has a brief relationship. Cathy, upon discovering her husband's secret homosexuality, does everything in her power to attempt to reclaim her home life, but fails, and finds solice in the arms of Deagan.A good premise for a movie, with an excellent cast - Quaid, back from the dead and on top form, gives a compelling performance as a man coming to terms with himself - and Haysbert has a screen presence and a benign charisma that few of his contemporaries can equal. Moore, as I've mentioned, is luminous and quaint, without ever once being cloying or sentimental.Direction is lovely, with Todd Haynes' retro-fantastic vibe pervading the whole picture, giving an enormous sense of 'The Lucy Show' gone awry.And that's the problem with 'Far From Heaven'.The total lack of contrast between veneer and truth makes for some very unbelievable moments. In a time when seggregation was rampant and sexuality was something dirty, why should Cathy remain so relatively placid and calm when her husband is gay? Why should Raymond Deagan take a white woman to dance at a black dancehall? Moore as Cathy has rarely displayed such a poor sense of feeling for her character, and while she gives a fine performance to match the scenery, she doesn't really touch on the reality of her situation.That's the problem. The premise of the picture is compelling, the ensemble cast are highly talented and the directorial talents of Haynes are top-notch, but the whole movie lacks a sense of the real, the believable, that very soon one begins to wonder exactly what Haynes is up to.Visually compelling, and in places, great, on the whole, 'Far From Heaven' is a disappointment that really could have been a Classic.

603512,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JLQH,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[2, 3]","I've never been disappointed by a Julianne Moore performance, but I have also never been as impressed as I was with her performance in &quot;Far From Heaven.&quot; For this film, she turns in a remarkably restrained and subtle piece of acting, one that puts me in mind of Emma Thompson's excellent work in &quot;The Remains of the Day.&quot;Moore plays homemaker Cathy Whitaker, mother to 2 children and wife to Frank Whitaker (played by Dennis Quaid). The setting is the 1950's in Connecticut. Racial tensions are an undercurrent to the entire film, but the main subject is Cathy herself, and how she deals with growing difficulties both in her marriage and outside of it.Prevalent in the film, almost a character in itself, is the sense of the 1950's. As the film begins, the Whitakers have an almost idyllic quality, like the Cleavers from &quot;Leave it to Beaver.&quot; As the story goes on, though, the perfect facade begins to crumble, and we see some very real problems under the surface. It is done skillfully, and seems to be indicative of the '50's in general, this sense of a perfect mask, hiding any number of problems.Another excellent performance is found in Dennis Haysbert, as Raymond Deagan, the Whitakers' African-American gardener. As Cathy struggles with the difficulties in her marriage and in her life, she develops a bond with Raymond, a bond which makes things tragically worse for her in the racially-restrictive atmosphere of the 1950's.The way the story progresses makes it clear that Cathy is not a racist, but her circumstances force her into considering racial motivations for some of her decisions later in the film. The real tragedy in &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; is actually the tragedy of America in the 1950's -- there were many who realized that racial equality was important, but the society at large made it almost impossible for them to act on their beliefs.Perhaps my only complaint of the film is that it tries to do a little bit too much. The story of Cathy and her internal conflicts would have been good enough, but late in the film other conflicts are introduced for Raymond and for Frank which do more to distract from Cathy's story than adding to it. It's not out of the realm of possibility for these conflicts to happen, but it's definitely a stretch, and it is at these points when the film loses a bit of focus.Nevertheless, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; is a film filled with wonderfully subtle performances, and expresses the feel of America in the 1950's very well. Fifties America was a lovely shell of peace and prosperity, but unfortunately that shell was fragile, and masked a multitude of sins and conflicts for those who lived through them. &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; portrays both the shell and the conflicts beneath it almost perfectly, and reveals a great deal about the time.  It is a film, and a subject, worthy of attention.",4,Nuanced performances reflect a complex time,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,2890,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'have', 'also', 'never', 'been', 'as', 'impressed', 'was', 'performance', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven.', 'quot', 'film', 'remarkably', 'restrained', 'subtle', 'piece', 'acting', 'one', 'mind', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'excellent', 'work', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day.', 'quot', 'Moore', 'homemaker', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'mother', '2', 'children', 'wife', 'Frank', 'Whitaker', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'setting', '1950', 'Connecticut', 'Racial', 'tensions', 'are', 'undercurrent', 'entire', 'film', 'main', 'subject', 'Cathy', 'how', 'growing', 'difficulties', 'marriage', 'it.Prevalent', 'film', 'almost', 'character', 'sense', '1950', 'film', 'Whitakers', 'have', 'almost', 'idyllic', 'quality', 'Cleavers', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Beaver.', 'quot', 'story', 'perfect', 'facade', 'crumble', 'see', 'very', 'real', 'problems', 'surface', 'done', 'skillfully', 'be', 'indicative', ""'50"", 'general', 'sense', 'perfect', 'mask', 'hiding', 'number', 'problems.Another', 'excellent', 'performance', 'found', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'Whitakers', 'African-American', 'gardener', 'Cathy', 'struggles', 'difficulties', 'marriage', 'life', 'bond', 'Raymond', 'bond', 'things', 'tragically', 'worse', 'racially-restrictive', 'atmosphere', ""1950's.The"", 'way', 'story', 'clear', 'Cathy', 'not', 'racist', 'circumstances', 'force', 'considering', 'racial', 'motivations', 'decisions', 'later', 'film', 'real', 'tragedy', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'actually', 'tragedy', 'America', '1950', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'realized', 'racial', 'equality', 'was', 'important', 'society', 'large', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible', 'act', 'beliefs.Perhaps', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'Cathy', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'enough', 'late', 'film', 'other', 'conflicts', 'are', 'introduced', 'Raymond', 'Frank', 'do', 'more', 'distract', 'Cathy', 'story', 'adding', 'not', 'realm', 'possibility', 'conflicts', 'happen', 'definitely', 'stretch', 'points', 'when', 'film', 'bit', 'focus.Nevertheless', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'film', 'filled', 'wonderfully', 'subtle', 'performances', 'feel', 'America', '1950', 'very', 'well', 'Fifties', 'America', 'was', 'lovely', 'shell', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'unfortunately', 'shell', 'was', 'fragile', 'masked', 'multitude', 'sins', 'conflicts', 'who', 'lived', 'quot', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'shell', 'conflicts', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'film', 'subject', 'worthy', 'attention']",N/A

But i also remember the hard times he went through when he broke up with his wife.  (not actually because of me but because he realized that he was gay and got married for all the wrong reasons.) The movie and story and the wonderful settings of the mid-1950's was all soul sturring.  Geeee's,,,,i remember my mom being dressed like that and still remember our furniture.  In that respect it was a wonderful walk in the past.  The hardest part and most heart breaking of the whole film is the ""wife.""  Man,,,,,my heart went out to her.  Pretty much rejected twice!  I wonder if the movie didn't end at the train station what would become of her.All in all this is a wonderful film.

603514,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLQH,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 5]","Far from Heaven (Todd Haynes, 2002)The movies that have found their way onto my Best of 2002 list have no way of being compared, really. It&#65533;s impossible to take, for example, The Ring, Rabbit-Proof Fence, and Far from Heaven and compare them in any meaningful way. Ranking these ten is going to be the toughest of jobs. Seeing this movie made it that much more difficult, because in many years, Far from Heaven would have topped the list without a second thought.Far from Heaven is Todd Haynes&#65533; homage to the weepies of the 1950s, and anyone who&#65533;s seen Imitation of Life or any of its cohorts will find a good deal of familiarity in here. The central characters are the Whitakers, Cathy (Julianne Moore), Frank (Dennis Quaid), and their children. Cathy and Frank are considered by the residents of their Connecticut suburb to be the perfect couple, so much so that the local weekly paper wants to do a profile on them.All the usual trappings of a film&#65533;the acting, the cinematography, the pace, etc.&#65533;succeed, so there&#65533;s no use spending time on them here. What makes Far from Heaven stand out from the pack is the way Haynes conveys the attitudes of both fifties film and fifties life as counterpoints, and injects twenty-first century pacing into them. The first half-hour of the movie is spent setting up the family secrets, but instead of the leisurely pace one would expect from a Douglas Sirk film, Haynes sets us on edge from the get go with foreshadowing. We are never allowed to be lulled into that fifties sense of security that coddles, and seems to overwhelm, the characters. It&#65533;s as if Haynes is sitting in the seat next to us chuckling at the navet&eacute; of his characters.The aforementioned counterpoint is best shown by the treatments of the two taboos the characters break. (These aren&#65533;t spoilers; if you&#65533;ve seen trailers for the film, you know all this already.) Frank is a closet homosexual who, by lucky coincidence, is drawn into the gay underground. When Cathy finds out, she ends up confiding in the family&#65533;s new gardener, Raymond (Dennis Haysbert), who took over the family gardening business after the death of his father. Cathy soon finds out there is a lot more to Raymond than meets the eye, and the two find themselves falling in love.While one would expect the double standard one actually gets here (Frank&#65533;s behavior is suspected, but not known, and somewhat tolerated; Cathy&#65533;s causes the destruction of the fragile veneer not only in the family, but in the whole town), the subtle brilliance of the thing is in Haynes&#65533; treatment of the intertwining love stories. Cathy and Raymond get the Sirkian swelling violins, the long glances, the panoramic shots. Everything about the movie conveys, subtly, that Cathy and Raymond are right and the rest of the world is wrong. Frank&#65533;s affairs, on the other hand, are filmed furtively, in half-light and hurried cut-scenes. His attempts at being &#65533;cured&#65533; (after Cathy discovers his secret) are used in the film for humor value more than anything else. The effect becomes almost savage, and is a chilling underlining of the idea that while interracial relationships could be looked upon with sympathy in Hollywood back in the day, homosexuality was not to be tolerated. It is a deeply distressing undertone in the movie, and a dead accurate one.Far from Heaven is a nostalgia trip on crack, what Nick at Nite might be if framed by Martin Scorsese remakes of the original shows. It is never less than compelling, brilliant from beginning to end, and easily one of the best films of 2002. **** ",5,Easily one of the best movies of 2002.,1052092800,"05 5, 2003",2003,3672,"['Far', 'Heaven', 'Todd', 'Haynes', '2002', 'movies', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'Best', '2002', 'list', 'have', 'way', 'being', 'compared', 'really', '65533', 'impossible', 'take', 'example', 'Ring', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'compare', 'meaningful', 'way', 'Ranking', 'ten', 'going', 'be', 'toughest', 'jobs', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'many', 'years', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'would', 'have', 'topped', 'list', 'second', 'thought.Far', 'Heaven', 'Todd', 'Haynes', '65533', 'homage', 'weepies', '1950s', 'anyone', 'who', '65533', 's', 'seen', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'cohorts', 'will', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'familiarity', 'here', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'Whitakers', 'Cathy', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'children', 'Cathy', 'Frank', 'are', 'considered', 'residents', 'Connecticut', 'suburb', 'be', 'perfect', 'couple', 'so', 'much', 'local', 'weekly', 'paper', 'do', 'profile', 'usual', 'trappings', 'film', '65533', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'pace', 'etc.', '65533', 'succeed', '65533', 's', 'use', 'spending', 'time', 'here', 'What', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'stand', 'out', 'pack', 'way', 'Haynes', 'attitudes', 'fifties', 'film', 'fifties', 'life', 'counterpoints', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'pacing', 'first', 'half-hour', 'movie', 'spent', 'setting', 'up', 'family', 'secrets', 'instead', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'film', 'Haynes', 'edge', 'get', 'go', 'foreshadowing', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'be', 'lulled', 'sense', 'security', 'overwhelm', 'characters', '65533', 'Haynes', 'sitting', 'seat', 'next', 'chuckling', 'navet', 'eacute', 'characters.The', 'aforementioned', 'counterpoint', 'best', 'shown', 'treatments', 'two', 'taboos', 'characters', 'break', 'aren', '65533', 't', 'spoilers', '65533', 've', 'seen', 'trailers', 'film', 'know', 'already', 'Frank', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'who', 'lucky', 'coincidence', 'drawn', 'gay', 'underground', 'When', 'Cathy', 'out', 'up', 'confiding', 'family', '65533', 's', 'new', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'family', 'gardening', 'business', 'death', 'father', 'Cathy', 'soon', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'Raymond', 'eye', 'two', 'find', 'falling', 'love.While', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'double', 'standard', 'one', 'actually', 'here', 'Frank', '65533', 's', 'behavior', 'suspected', 'not', 'known', 'somewhat', 'tolerated', 'Cathy', '65533', 's', 'destruction', 'fragile', 'veneer', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'whole', 'town', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'thing', 'Haynes', '65533', 'treatment', 'intertwining', 'love', 'stories', 'Cathy', 'Raymond', 'get', 'Sirkian', 'swelling', 'violins', 'long', 'glances', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'Everything', 'movie', 'conveys', 'subtly', 'Cathy', 'Raymond', 'are', 'right', 'rest', 'world', 'wrong', 'Frank', '65533', 's', 'affairs', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'filmed', 'furtively', 'half-light', 'hurried', 'cut-scenes', 'attempts', 'being', '65533', 'cured', '65533', 'Cathy', 'secret', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'humor', 'value', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'effect', 'almost', 'savage', 'chilling', 'underlining', 'idea', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'could', 'be', 'looked', 'sympathy', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'day', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'tolerated', 'deeply', 'distressing', 'undertone', 'movie', 'dead', 'accurate', 'one.Far', 'Heaven', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'crack', 'what', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'might', 'be', 'framed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'remakes', 'original', 'shows', 'never', 'less', 'compelling', 'brilliant', 'beginning', 'end', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2002', '****']",N/A

Set in 1950's Connecticut, this film follows a rather streamlined, cookie cutter plotline.  However what makes this movie worth watching are its strong performances by Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert along with deliciously crafted cinematography.  It takes a conventional story and brings it vividly to life with a precise display of colors, genuine wardrobe, and authentic environments.  There is a familiar scent of Hollywood detectable throughout the film, though all other aspects of the movie strengthen its appeal.  The story follows the plight of a well-to-do housewife (Moore) in conservative era Connecticut.  Her seemingly story book existence is challenged when she learns of her husband's (Dennis Quaid) homosexual indiscretions and she takes solace in the confidence of her new acquaintance and gardener (Haysbert) who happens to be black.  In this time frame her interracial fraternization, as innocent as it may have been, tarnishes her reputation as the idyllic housewife.  The major issues addressed are amplified by the time frame in which they're set.  One aspect in particular the movie excels at is recreating the acting element of 50's cinema.  The performances are both compelling and genuine and the movie, while slow moving at times, in its entirety is certainly worth watching and wholly enjoyable.",3,Beautiful Cinematography Rescues Hackneyed Story Line,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,1433,"['Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'aims', 'display', 'confront', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'era', 'where', 'were', 'anything', 'Set', '1950', 'Connecticut', 'film', 'rather', 'streamlined', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'plotline', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'watching', 'are', 'strong', 'performances', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'deliciously', 'crafted', 'cinematography', 'conventional', 'story', 'vividly', 'life', 'precise', 'display', 'colors', 'genuine', 'wardrobe', 'authentic', 'environments', 'familiar', 'scent', 'Hollywood', 'detectable', 'film', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'appeal', 'story', 'plight', 'well-to-do', 'housewife', 'Moore', 'conservative', 'era', 'Connecticut', 'seemingly', 'story', 'book', 'existence', 'challenged', 'when', 'husband', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'homosexual', 'indiscretions', 'solace', 'confidence', 'new', 'acquaintance', 'gardener', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'be', 'black', 'time', 'interracial', 'fraternization', 'as', 'innocent', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reputation', 'idyllic', 'housewife', 'major', 'issues', 'addressed', 'are', 'amplified', 'time', 'frame', ""'re"", 'set', 'One', 'aspect', 'particular', 'movie', 'excels', 'recreating', 'acting', 'element', '50', 'cinema', 'performances', 'are', 'compelling', 'genuine', 'movie', 'slow', 'moving', 'times', 'entirety', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'wholly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Although she received an Oscar nomination for her part in this film, she sadly lost to Nicole Kidman.  My wife and I watched about half of the picture before she finally asked the question that I had in my mind-why wasn't Dennis Quaid nominated for an Oscar for this movie?Todd Haynes' obsession with 50s melodramas shows in just about every aspect of this story of a picture perfect 50s marriage crumbling apart because of the husband's homosexual urges and the wife's interest in a black gardener (played by the always excellent Dennis Haysbert).  The attention to detail, the music, the costumes, the camera angles, the cinematography - are all very reminiscent of the kind of movies my mom used to watch.  Personally, I thought the pacing of this movie was much too languid for my tastes, but that's the way they did 'em back then.  While I wouldn't go so far as to call Far from Heaven a ""chick flick"", it's not one that will likely register with men.  The reason anyone, male or female, should watch this picture is the standout performance delivered by Quaid.  Don't get me wrong, Julianne Moore was good.

Yes, it seems too perfect when the vividly colorful fall leaves on the trees match what everyone is wearing, but that's part of the deal here--it's a *picture* of perfection that exists only as an image (pay close attention to the opening and closing scenes). The more perfect the image, the larger the gap between the image and the reality, and the more dramatic the impact when the perfect image begins to crumble.At the start of the film, I had a hard time adapting to the ""too perfect"" language--all the gee golly goodness of the 1950s is really taken to the hilt. It came THIS close to being laughable. Before long, though, I found myself not watching a movie about the 50s but living a story in the 50s. Haynes makes it real--from the clothes and cars to the language and social mores of the day. It was a time when homosexuality was a psychiatric condition to be ""cured"" and when an inter-racial couple faced open hatred or at least villification from both communities. It was a hard time to be anything other than what society expected you to be and that, to me, is at the heart of this story.Highly recommended...a film that will have you thinking after you leave the theatre...a wonderful gift to any movie lover!",4,"Highly stylized, visually lush and superbly acted drama!",1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,1297,"['one', 'most', 'aesthetically', 'beautiful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Yes', 'too', 'perfect', 'when', 'vividly', 'colorful', 'fall', 'trees', 'match', 'what', 'everyone', 'wearing', 'part', 'deal', 'here', '*picture*', 'perfection', 'only', 'image', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'more', 'perfect', 'image', 'larger', 'gap', 'image', 'reality', 'more', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'when', 'perfect', 'image', 'crumble.At', 'start', 'film', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'adapting', 'too', 'perfect', 'language', 'gee', 'golly', 'goodness', '1950s', 'really', 'taken', 'hilt', 'came', 'THIS', 'close', 'being', 'laughable', 'long', 'found', 'not', 'watching', 'movie', '50s', 'living', 'story', '50s', 'Haynes', 'real', 'clothes', 'cars', 'language', 'social', 'mores', 'day', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'psychiatric', 'condition', 'be', 'cured', 'when', 'inter-racial', 'couple', 'faced', 'open', 'hatred', 'least', 'villification', 'communities', 'was', 'hard', 'time', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'society', 'expected', 'be', 'heart', 'story.Highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'leave', 'theatre', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'movie', 'lover']",N/A

Everything is clean and new in Hartford Connecticut during the late 1950's; the cars--even the dark alleys.  Cathy played by the incandescent Julianne Moore, is the perfect hostess, housewife and mother.  Her husband, played by a wiry, edgy Dennis Quaid is the perfect father and successful businessman.  Their gardener, Deagan, played by Dennis Haysbert, is squeaky clean as well, always wearing brand new clothes even though he just came out of the garden.Civil rights issues are obliquely referred to as a distant problem occurring in other towns.  Yet Cathy and her husband are both touched by passion that violates the expectations of small town 1950's society.  When they cross the line, violence is threatened.  Those who cross the line are firmly put in their place or shunned.This movie makes the point that the serene beauty of this time is achieved at cost of loss of awareness and passion.  The double life that must be lived by those who have longings for something other than the mainstream is hinted at by the movie marquee that advertises ""The Three Faces of Eve"".This film is beautiful and passionate with a wonderful attention to detail.  The flamboyant ultra-feminine clothing of the women and the brilliantly painted rooms and cars create a nostalgic mood that is contrasted by emotional tone of frustration and lonely despair.  The autumn leaves in every scene hint at the death of this rigid patriarchal culture that oppressed minorities, women and children and sublimated all feeling in order to present an orderly, conformist appearance.

603525,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00005JLQH,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Usually ""cleverness,"" when perceived in a work of art, short-circuits our capacity to be moved by it -- usually, cleverness implies the self-conscious application of a ""style,"" and to the extent that the style impinges on our awareness, we are less likely to be moved, or even much engaged, by the human ""content.""  Todd Haynes, the director of ""Far from Heaven,"" refuses to believe that we can't have it both ways, and in the most ""meta"" moment in the movie, he has two characters discuss the emotional content of abstract art (they are looking at a Miro), and one character insists that the abstraction if anything enables a more direct access to something basic and emotional and human.  As a general principle, one might want to raise a question or two about that.  The movie, however, isn't really very like a Miro -- its style is that of a 1950s romantic drama like ""All that Heaven Allows,"" and its texture is of a heightened realism of presentation, and the heightening (in terms of color palette, camera angles, set design, costuming) is something that doesn't escape our notice, but it doesn't get in the way of our emotional engagement with the predicaments of the characters.That it doesn't is a testimony to the actors -- Julianne Moore is superb as Cathleen Whitaker, who has to deal with learning that her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid) is attracted sexually to men -- something that distresses him and that he has tried to hide to preserve the ""perfect family"" image that all the Whitakers' friends and neighbors believe them to represent.  Dennis Quaid, often shot in darkness or near darkness is absolutely splendid as the tortured Frank.  When I use words like ""superb"" and ""splendid,"" I am responding to performances that not only are a matter of representing characters: the actors here are also acting the part of 1950s actors playing the characters  -- they give themselves totally and without irony to Haynes's project, which is to make his audience respond through a style to a human truth, even when that style, in 2002, can't help but be seen as ""retro.""  Quaid, Moore, and Dennis Haysbert (as Raymond Deagan, the widowed black gardener to whom Cathleen in her confusion and sorrow is drawn) have the power to draw us in, even as we recognize a style of acting (and a restraint in what is shown and told) that is long out-of-date.  Haynes believes that that style WORKED, that any style can work, if it is employed with directness and attention to detail, and backed by a good script (in a complementary style, of course).  Elmer Bernstein's score, and even the design of the titles, are just two small examples of Haynes's attention to detail.The truth that Haynes is after is emotional -- the pain, confusion, self-doubt, and frustration that occur when lines are crossed in any society.  Here, the society is 1957 upper-middle-class Connecticut, and the lines have to do with sexual orientation and race relations.  The conventions of this style do not give us any insight into racial or sexual issues -- they have to do with the fact that confusion, pain, etc., are tied up with the extent to which our vision of ourselves is connected to our consciousness of how our class or group sees us and whether or not we measure up to their standards.  In 1957 in the US, homosexuality is agreed to be deviant and disgusting, and Frank, although he leaves Cathleen for a man, is not a free and happy spirit at the end.  Likewise, a white woman's attraction to a black man is likewise deviant, but Cathleen and Deagan don't get a chance to progress far enough in their relationship after it becomes public knowledge (which Frank's sexual life never does).  The pathos of the final scene is not exactly of lovers sundered but of chances missed, not willfully, but because there are children involved.  Raymond's business is ruined in Connecticut, and he has a daughter to bring up.  In the final scene he boards a train for a new life in Baltimore, and all Cathleen can do is exchange with him a final silent wave.  It sounds sentimental, and it is -- but it's played superbly straight, and we believe it.",5,clever and moving,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,4125,"['Usually', 'cleverness', 'when', 'perceived', 'work', 'art', 'short-circuits', 'capacity', 'be', 'moved', 'usually', 'cleverness', 'self-conscious', 'application', 'style', 'extent', 'style', 'awareness', 'are', 'less', 'likely', 'be', 'moved', 'even', 'much', 'engaged', 'human', 'content', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'director', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways', 'most', 'meta', 'moment', 'movie', 'two', 'characters', 'discuss', 'emotional', 'content', 'abstract', 'art', 'are', 'looking', 'Miro', 'one', 'character', 'abstraction', 'anything', 'more', 'direct', 'access', 'something', 'basic', 'emotional', 'human', 'general', 'principle', 'one', 'might', 'want', 'raise', 'question', 'two', 'movie', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'Miro', 'style', '1950s', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'texture', 'heightened', 'realism', 'presentation', 'heightening', 'terms', 'color', 'palette', 'camera', 'angles', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'something', ""n't"", 'escape', 'notice', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'emotional', 'engagement', 'predicaments', 'characters.That', ""n't"", 'testimony', 'actors', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'superb', 'Cathleen', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'deal', 'learning', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'attracted', 'sexually', 'men', 'something', 'tried', 'hide', 'preserve', 'perfect', 'family', 'image', 'Whitakers', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'believe', 'represent', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'often', 'shot', 'darkness', 'darkness', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'tortured', 'Frank', 'When', 'use', 'words', 'superb', 'splendid', 'am', 'responding', 'performances', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'matter', 'representing', 'characters', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'acting', 'part', '1950s', 'actors', 'playing', 'characters', 'give', 'totally', 'irony', 'Haynes', 'project', 'make', 'audience', 'respond', 'style', 'human', 'truth', 'even', 'when', 'style', '2002', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'seen', 'retro', 'Quaid', 'Moore', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'widowed', 'black', 'gardener', 'whom', 'Cathleen', 'confusion', 'sorrow', 'drawn', 'have', 'power', 'draw', 'even', 'recognize', 'style', 'acting', 'restraint', 'what', 'shown', 'told', 'long', 'out-of-date', 'Haynes', 'style', 'WORKED', 'style', 'can', 'work', 'employed', 'directness', 'attention', 'detail', 'backed', 'good', 'script', 'complementary', 'style', 'course', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'even', 'design', 'titles', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'small', 'examples', 'Haynes', 'attention', 'detail.The', 'truth', 'Haynes', 'emotional', 'pain', 'confusion', 'self-doubt', 'frustration', 'occur', 'when', 'lines', 'are', 'crossed', 'society', 'Here', 'society', '1957', 'upper-middle-class', 'Connecticut', 'lines', 'have', 'do', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'race', 'relations', 'conventions', 'style', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'insight', 'racial', 'sexual', 'issues', 'have', 'do', 'fact', 'confusion', 'pain', 'etc.', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'extent', 'vision', 'ourselves', 'connected', 'consciousness', 'how', 'class', 'group', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'standards', '1957', 'US', 'homosexuality', 'agreed', 'be', 'deviant', 'disgusting', 'Frank', 'Cathleen', 'man', 'not', 'free', 'happy', 'spirit', 'end', 'Likewise', 'white', 'woman', 'attraction', 'black', 'man', 'likewise', 'deviant', 'Cathleen', 'Deagan', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'progress', 'far', 'enough', 'relationship', 'public', 'knowledge', 'Frank', 'sexual', 'life', 'never', 'pathos', 'final', 'scene', 'not', 'exactly', 'lovers', 'sundered', 'chances', 'missed', 'not', 'willfully', 'are', 'children', 'involved', 'Raymond', 'business', 'ruined', 'Connecticut', 'daughter', 'bring', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'train', 'new', 'life', 'Baltimore', 'Cathleen', 'can', 'do', 'exchange', 'final', 'silent', 'wave', 'sentimental', 'played', 'superbly', 'straight', 'believe']",N/A

Nemeth,"[14, 29]","The natural audience for a skillfully photographed indulgence of this sort is most likely persons who've spent too many years in film schools, since it's probable only they, if anybody, would be willing to ignore the disabling degree to which this film smells of the shop. It's at heart a pastiche of precisely that sort of outdated stuff still taught at places within the academy as ""cutting edge,"" its aesthetic straight out of now conformist 60's Cahiers du Cinema dogmatism - a film, according to which, should bear its director's mark; matters of style are all, and the story, even if campily inconsequential, is no detraction from what's really valuable to the with-it cineaste. From this viewpoint a genius like William Wyler comes to be denigrated since none of his films, as he proudly pointed out, shows a repetitive stylistic hand, whereas a mediocrity such as Douglas Sirk may be lauded to the skies since overly lush photography and cryptic, if inconsequential, visual metaphors for decoding are rife in all his works. Todd Haynes adds insult to injury in ""Far From Heaven"", an unnecessary homage to the laughably overrated Sirk.  The lush photography and lavish musical scores of 50's melodrama Haynes reproduces with an obsequious fidelity, though he is original in adding one unfortunate element - the invitation to a contemporary audience to congratulate itself of how far its come from supposed 50's benightedness in matters of race and sex.If the film has any saving grace, it's in the lead performances.  Both Moore and Quaid do commendable work, though it should be noted that their roles are so limited in depth that not very much is demanded of either.  Despite the ravings of so many critics, it's worthwhile to remember that Moore, for instance, is not acting Hedda Gabler here, much less Phaedra.  What she's playing is just a precursor of a Jane Fonda conversion heroine.  She has an initial inkling that racism is bad, and with experience she finds it indeed to be so!  Moreover, Norma Desmond's famous complaint that actors nowadays lack faces for the screen could with perfect justice fit Moore in this role.  She is photographed either in a full Betty Crocker rictus or with her shadowy face averted from the camera.In no case is hers one of the great performances in screen history, though I would not be surprised if the bandwagon effect leads to her winning all of the increasing number of awards film actors are on the receiving end of these days.",2,"""Already Stale Postmodernism""",1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,2482,"['natural', 'audience', 'skillfully', 'photographed', 'indulgence', 'sort', 'most', 'likely', 'persons', 'who', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'film', 'schools', 'probable', 'only', 'anybody', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'ignore', 'disabling', 'degree', 'film', 'shop', 'heart', 'pastiche', 'precisely', 'sort', 'outdated', 'stuff', 'still', 'taught', 'places', 'academy', 'cutting', 'edge', 'aesthetic', 'straight', 'now', 'conformist', '60', 'Cahiers', 'du', 'Cinema', 'dogmatism', 'film', 'according', 'should', 'bear', 'director', 'mark', 'matters', 'style', 'are', 'story', 'even', 'campily', 'inconsequential', 'detraction', 'what', 'really', 'valuable', 'with-it', 'cineaste', 'viewpoint', 'genius', 'William', 'Wyler', 'be', 'denigrated', 'none', 'films', 'proudly', 'pointed', 'out', 'repetitive', 'stylistic', 'hand', 'mediocrity', 'such', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'may', 'be', 'lauded', 'skies', 'overly', 'lush', 'photography', 'cryptic', 'inconsequential', 'visual', 'metaphors', 'decoding', 'are', 'rife', 'works', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'insult', 'injury', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'unnecessary', 'homage', 'laughably', 'overrated', 'Sirk', 'lush', 'photography', 'lavish', 'musical', 'scores', '50', 'melodrama', 'Haynes', 'reproduces', 'obsequious', 'fidelity', 'original', 'adding', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'element', 'invitation', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'congratulate', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'supposed', '50', 'benightedness', 'matters', 'race', 'sex.If', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'lead', 'performances', 'Moore', 'Quaid', 'do', 'commendable', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'roles', 'are', 'so', 'limited', 'depth', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'demanded', 'ravings', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'worthwhile', 'remember', 'Moore', 'instance', 'not', 'acting', 'Hedda', 'Gabler', 'here', 'much', 'less', 'Phaedra', 'What', 'playing', 'just', 'precursor', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'conversion', 'heroine', 'initial', 'inkling', 'racism', 'bad', 'experience', 'indeed', 'be', 'so', 'Moreover', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'famous', 'complaint', 'actors', 'nowadays', 'lack', 'screen', 'could', 'perfect', 'justice', 'fit', 'Moore', 'role', 'photographed', 'either', 'full', 'Betty', 'Crocker', 'rictus', 'shadowy', 'face', 'averted', 'camera.In', 'case', 'hers', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'screen', 'history', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'bandwagon', 'effect', 'winning', 'increasing', 'number', 'awards', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'receiving', 'end', 'days']",N/A

Haynes' highly economical screenplay neatly articulates three key arenas of prejudice: race, gender and sexual preference. And at the heart of this film are three great performances. Julianne Moore is sublime as the confused but brave Cathy Whitaker.  Dennis Haysbert is wonderful as Raymond Deagan, striking just the right balance between subservience and dignity. But highest praise must go to Dennis Quaid's rendering of the sexually-tortured Frank Whitaker, teetering between acceptance, self-loathing and violent self-destruction.  He was unbelievably passed over in the Supporting Actor Oscar nominations. His performance clearly outshines John C. Reilly's almost embarrassing turn in ""Chicago"" and Paul Newman's trifling role in ""Road to Perdition"", and is at least on par with the other nominees.  I don't understand the Academy's reasoning anymore. (Or perhaps the producers are to blame.  Did they simply want to spend their promotional budget pushing the film in more coveted categories?)  Whatever the case, the Academy certainly got it right when nominating Edward Lachman for his cinematography.  The deliberately Technicolored style which revives our latent memories of Douglas Sirk's melodramas is an extremely clever choice. The artificiality of the visuals plays against the palpable suffering of the characters. This is a risk, because for some viewers it might undermine the seriousness of what Haynes is trying to say.

However, this housewife's idealic life becomes destroyed when she finds out her husband is a closet homosexual.The performances in this film are flawless and Dennis Quaid does a superb job playing the husband leading a double life. After watching the movie the viewer gets a glimpse as to what gay men actually went through in the 1950's, with leading two separate lives, the married one and the gay lifestyle that they want so much to live.Julianne Moore would receive an Oscar nomiantion for Best Actress for her role in ""Far From Heaven"" and the movie was a hit at the boxoffice.

The cinematography, costumes, dialogue, furniture, and colors recall the 1950s so uncannily it's downright frightening. Even the dramatic score from the legendary Elmer Bernstein recalls that era. But ""Far From Heaven"" is no movie of style over substance. It's a heartbreakingly effective tale of a Connecticut family whose white-picket-fence ideals are shot to the ground by a series of dramatic events. Julianne Moore gives the performance Oscar fantasies are made of as Cathy Whitaker, the good-natured and dutiful mother and husband of a successful TV executive (an emotional Dennis Quaid). Cathy's comfort zone gets rocked to the core when she catches Frank smooching another guy. As any wife would, she's crushed but remains optimistic that Frank will ""beat this thing"" that makes him ""despicable."" But loneliness gets the better of her and she befriends a mild-mannered Black neighbor (dynamite work from Dennis Haysbert), and soon their friendship becomes the object of vicious town gossip. I'll refrain from revealing anything more, but ""Far From Heaven"" had me hooked from the word go. We all know that racism existed in the 1950's (and, sadly, it still does today), and we all know that interracial relationships were frowned upon in that era (as they still are today). But what peaked my interest is how this film, set in 1957, handled homosexuality in a period that pre-dated Stonewall and the concept of gay rights. And the witty screenplay dodges cliches, avoids predictability, and draws us closer to the characters and their pain. Director Haynes never strives for irony (though the temptation is there) and he tells the story similar to the way it probably would have been told in the 1950s. So, pay no attention to the 3, 2, and 1 star reviews that appear here.

After seeing this movie, I can see that the director and production designer was NOT trying to make this appear in any way to be Hartford, but to you as it as a kind of cover for a general setting typical of unrealistic, totaly set produced films of the 1940s and 1950s that this picture tended to emulate.  No one from Hartford in this era would think of it as Hartford, the vegitation is different, it was obviously filmed in a much smaller town, the husband was depicted as working in the television industry which does not or did not exist in Hartford then or now, while Hartford was the center of world aircraft component production then, a typewriter production center, and the ""Insurance Capital of the World,"" in the 1940s and 1950s.None of the people in the film talk like people in Hartford or even Connecticut speak. The georgraphy of segregation is just so different from what we see.But I think the idea is to make a movie that is not actively realistic, a movie whose environment is choked, stranguled trapped the way the protagonists in this movie are. They're trapped by things that remain problems: sexual repression, homophobia, racism, the oppressiveness of this society's fiction of marriage, class prejudice etc.  However, in the time these problems were incalculably major and massive. They could only be depicted in the kind of noir neverworld where the score communicates depths of emotion and crisis that the times have no words for the characters to express.",3,"Not Connecticut, not Hartford, Not Today, thank goodness",1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,1657,"['saw', 'movie', 'friends', 'who', 'write', 'print', 'reviews', 'wanted', 'take', 'was', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'Hartford', '1950s', 'place', 'time', 'lived', 'there', 'seeing', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'production', 'designer', 'was', 'NOT', 'trying', 'make', 'appear', 'way', 'be', 'Hartford', 'kind', 'cover', 'general', 'setting', 'typical', 'unrealistic', 'totaly', 'set', 'produced', 'films', '1940s', '1950s', 'picture', 'tended', 'emulate', 'one', 'Hartford', 'era', 'would', 'think', 'Hartford', 'vegitation', 'different', 'was', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'much', 'smaller', 'town', 'husband', 'was', 'depicted', 'working', 'television', 'industry', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Hartford', 'then', 'now', 'Hartford', 'was', 'center', 'world', 'aircraft', 'component', 'production', 'then', 'typewriter', 'production', 'center', 'Insurance', 'Capital', 'World', '1940s', '1950s.None', 'people', 'film', 'talk', 'people', 'Hartford', 'even', 'Connecticut', 'speak', 'georgraphy', 'segregation', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'what', 'see.But', 'think', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'actively', 'realistic', 'movie', 'environment', 'choked', 'stranguled', 'trapped', 'way', 'protagonists', 'movie', 'are', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'things', 'remain', 'problems', 'sexual', 'repression', 'homophobia', 'racism', 'oppressiveness', 'society', 'fiction', 'marriage', 'class', 'prejudice', 'etc', 'However', 'time', 'problems', 'were', 'incalculably', 'major', 'massive', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'depicted', 'kind', 'noir', 'neverworld', 'where', 'score', 'depths', 'emotion', 'crisis', 'times', 'have', 'words', 'characters', 'express']",N/A

The Buick station wagon, georgeous New England autumn, welldressed and polite suburbanites are all true to the period and the locale of Hartford , CT., as I remember so vividly having spent my chldhood growing up in a Hartford suburb in that decade. And as the title implies, our memories are different from the complex reality of a time when race and homosexuality seldom openly intruded into life for the majority of the white middle class and yet for many it was indeed far from the heaven of their memories.The movie is technically superb, and tells it story at the leisurely pace of the films of that period while tackling topics directors such as Douglas Sirk (whose ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS is the model for this film) could not touch at that time. Dennis Quaid is excellent as the corporate man of the period struggling with his sexual orientation; Julianne Moore is wonderful as the proper suburban wife and mother; and Dennis Haysbert plays the role of the ""Negro"" gardener who befriends her during her difficulties and cause them to both discover that the cost of breaking the unwritten code of that period was much higher than they had understood.While I was glad that I saw the film, in the end it did not move me and I left admiring its artistry but disappointed. I can understand how other reviewers found it powerful in its examination of the hidden bigotry of the period, but I found it slow, it's message a little too obvious, and the ending very depressing with only despair offered the moviegoer. Even at the time portrayed by this film, most suburban whites, even if prejudiced, were aware that life was from far perfect even while believing in the American dream. And just a final historical note, as the credits reveal, the movie was not actually made in Hartford, the train station looks like an idyllic suburb at the time Hartford was a vibant city (which did have a meaningful black population).",3,A beautifully made & very depressing recreation of the '50's,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,2036,"['director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'wonderful', 'job', 'recreating', 'mood', 'film', 'style', ""'50"", 'FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'Buick', 'station', 'wagon', 'georgeous', 'New', 'England', 'autumn', 'welldressed', 'polite', 'suburbanites', 'are', 'true', 'period', 'locale', 'Hartford', 'CT.', 'remember', 'so', 'vividly', 'having', 'spent', 'chldhood', 'growing', 'up', 'Hartford', 'suburb', 'decade', 'title', 'implies', 'memories', 'are', 'different', 'complex', 'reality', 'time', 'when', 'race', 'homosexuality', 'seldom', 'openly', 'intruded', 'life', 'majority', 'white', 'middle', 'class', 'yet', 'many', 'was', 'indeed', 'far', 'heaven', 'memories.The', 'movie', 'technically', 'superb', 'story', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'films', 'period', 'tackling', 'topics', 'directors', 'such', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'THAT', 'HEAVEN', 'ALLOWS', 'model', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'touch', 'time', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'excellent', 'corporate', 'man', 'period', 'struggling', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wonderful', 'proper', 'suburban', 'wife', 'mother', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'role', 'Negro', 'gardener', 'who', 'difficulties', 'cause', 'discover', 'cost', 'breaking', 'unwritten', 'code', 'period', 'was', 'much', 'higher', 'had', 'understood.While', 'was', 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'left', 'admiring', 'artistry', 'disappointed', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'powerful', 'examination', 'hidden', 'bigotry', 'period', 'found', 'slow', 'message', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'ending', 'very', 'depressing', 'only', 'despair', 'offered', 'moviegoer', 'Even', 'time', 'portrayed', 'film', 'most', 'suburban', 'whites', 'even', 'prejudiced', 'were', 'aware', 'life', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'even', 'believing', 'American', 'dream', 'just', 'final', 'historical', 'note', 'credits', 'reveal', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'made', 'Hartford', 'train', 'station', 'idyllic', 'suburb', 'time', 'Hartford', 'was', 'vibant', 'city', 'did', 'have', 'meaningful', 'black', 'population']",N/A

What if it was the 1950's and you find out your husband is a homosexual? Dennis Quaid is said husband and Julianne Moore is the perfect housewife, trying to stabilize an unspeakable situation. It may seem stereotypical, and in some regards, it is, but this is a solid film with wonderful performances that should not be missed.The plot is simple. Julianne Moore's character catches her husband in act of unfaithfulness, and not just that, but with another man-at work. She doesn't freak out too much. Quad's character promises to get help, and she smiles and says thank you. Throughout the film, she attempts to put on a happy face. Her character is very popular-she has many good-standing friends, she have 2 children, a gorgeous house-basically, everything anyone could ever want.Her fascade soon starts to crumble, especially when she becomes friends with her gardener, who happens to be black. People stare, gossip and worse, when the two are seen going into a diner together, her husband finds out, and in an extremeley hypocritical fashion, begins slamming her for threatening their family's reputation. She never retaliates, trying to keep the peace, no matter that her husband is the one threatening their reputation by having an affair with another man. Things calm down and everything seems dandy again.The film goes through some up and downs, all the while anchored by Julianne Moore's brilliant performance. In fact, I have never seen her act better, or look better, for that matter. Again, she may come off as a tad stereotypical, but I don't think it's stretching the truth that much, especially for that time and location.The ending is a tad unresolved, but I felt satisfied, in a way. I don't think it could have ended any other way. I thought the director did a fantastic job, not just with the script and plot, but with the look and feel of the film. It looks ridiculously authentic, from the clothing, to the cars and props and even the start and end credits looked genuine. This is certainly one of the prettiest films I've seen that takes place in that particular era. It made it that more impressive and authentic.I do recommend this to anyone who loves a good melodrama. It is not graphic by any means so I really think it would appeal to a wide variety of different people.

There is the closeted gay husband who is forced to undergo psychiatric treatment in order to cure his ""illness"" and the interracial friendship that creates such scandal. And nobody ever gets angry (Julianne Moore's character still calls her husband ""dear"" even after he's hit her)! The way the movie is filmed is worthy of note as well. An emphasis is given to soft colours and hues, as if it were all something out of a women's magazine from the period. The one glaring note in it is the portrayal of the children, particularly the requisite boy and girl of Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid's family. They are little more than caricatures, fresh from a Norman Rockwell painting, saying things such as ""Aw shucks!"" and ""Yes sir.""

I feel that with The Pianist, it is more of a ""one time see"" and that Far From Heaven is something that you want to buy and watch maybe once a month if you like it.  That statement brings me into my next issue.Most people, I think, will not like this movie that much.  It takes a certain perspective, I think, to be able to enjoy this movie.  A lot of people I know would stray away from it for its depressing subject matter, but that was the what made this movie.  This movie was supposed to look pleasent on the outside, but there is so much devastation within that it shocks you and makes you see the real depth.  The synopsis even explains this point.  A perfect 50's family (stay-at-home mom, a boy and a girl, and of course, the big executive dad)is torn apart by homosexuality and scandal.  Julianne Moore's character is what helps hold everything together...in the mean time.The cast was wondeful.  Dennis Quaid deserved an Oscar nomination and possible win for his best performance as Mr. Whitaker, an advertising executive.  He brings his family to the top, but his feelings threaten to tear it back down, and his emotion and cripling suffocation are evident through his movements, through every thing he does.  This was Quaid's shining morning.  Julianne Moore plays Mrs. Whitaker and her internal devastation is well-portrayed by Moore, whose best performance is this movie.  She did recieve an Oscar nomination, and an apparant close win.  She would be the first reason to see this movie.  Patricia Clarkson also deserved an Oscar nomination who plays Moore's possibly-could-be-less-than-a best friend (if that makes sense).  Dennis Haysbert plays his role as Moore's gardener well, but not to an amazing extent.One thing I noticed about the filming of this movie was how the colors changed.  The movie went into a sequence of hills and valleys.  There were high points and low points.  During every high point, there were bright colors and everything seemed pleasent.  But when the low points arrived, the lights seemed to fade and the colors seemed to darken.  I think this, among many other reasons, should have influenced the Acadamy's nomination choices for Best Picture.Bottom Line: Should have been nominated for Best Picture over The Pianist for its outstanding cinematography, story, direction and, of course, acting.

603542,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00005JLQH,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 1]","How does one ""rationally"" review a motion picture whose raison d'tre is to faithfully mimic the style of a nearly half-century-old film genre? It's hard to respond to ""Far From Heaven"" on its own terms when you're constantly reminded -- often in ""weird"" ways -- of its connection to the films it's trying to reproduce.""Far From Heaven"" borrows most heavily from Douglas Sirk's ""All that Heaven Allows,"" which, with its romantic pairing of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson, is more than a little weird to begin with. * Both films feature a gardener, played by a heterosexual black actor in ""Far"" and a homosexual white actor in ""All."" But ""Far"" has a visibly homosexual character who'd played by a heterosexual actor, and... You get the idea.When you're so aware of the borrowings -- and how they're consciously used in ways that allow the films to ""comment"" on each other -- you feel you're watching someone assemble LEGOs, rather than viewing a dramatically meaningful story.Haynes' attempt to pay an honest tribute to Douglas Sirk, without irony, satire, camp, or archness, is not completely successful. There are several slips. Elmer Bernstein's ""main theme"" comes so close to conscious parody that I broke out laughing when it played under the titles. There's another laugh-provoking moment when the view through the rear window of Cathy's car is provided by rear projection!The principal failing of ""Far From Heaven"" is that it doesn't expand the genre. Merely including homosexuality in the mix of social issues isn't enough. The film treats homosexuality as if would have been treated -- had such a thing been possible -- in the '50s. Frank Whitaker comes off as an emotionally unbalanced freak who cannot control his ""perversion.""This is especially noticeable when Frank admits to Cathy that he's fallen in love with someone else. Rather than telling her in a calm, ""manly"" fashion, he blubbers all over the place, showing that he hasn't made any progress in understanding himself. And when he adds ""I've never felt this way before"" -- implying that his affection for another man is ""real"" in a way his feeling for Cathy never was - it's unconvincing, because we haven't _seen_ what lead up to this point.If you're going to ""break"" the genre and show something that couldn't have been shown 50 years ago, why show only part of it? The nearly exclusive focus on Cathy and Raymond unbalances ""Far From Heaven."" We don't fully experience what Frank is going through. He's little more than a caricature of the Eisenhower-era view of self-tortured homos. Unlike Cathy and Raymond, Frank does not visibly change.In a film that's ""about"" how people are made to suffer when they step over the social boundaries of their era, ""Far From Heaven"" is needlessly cautious in its treatment of Frank and his ""problem."" Haynes has a gift for writing brief, verbally terse scenes that clearly convey the characters' thoughts and emotions. He has time to show Frank cruising and (implicitly) having sex with a teenager while on vacation with Cathy. Adding another five minutes, with Frank meeting and falling in love with someone worthy of his affection, would have added dramatic balance, as well as ""pushing"" the genre by showing something that Sirk was never able to directly reveal. Providing an implicitly ""happy"" ending for Frank (while Cathy continues in her solitude) would have made an ironic comment on the ""glossy melodrama"" genre and the mores of its era.""Far From Heaven"" is, unfortunately, a genre film in which the genre is itself the subject. It is reminiscent of the Coen brothers' weaker efforts.* It's a good thing the Production Code prohibited anything even remotely resembling a ""sex scene.""

603544,A1OAJIRS05LWB,B00005JLQH,Zach Pajak,"[12, 15]","Both sagacious and poignant, this homage to Douglas Sirk's film noir/women movies of the 1950's delivers an emotionally-powerful story both successfully and allegorically.  The filmmaking and subject matter of Far from Heaven are expertly displayed in the exact, old-fashioned style as Sirk's movies, while being a stylish film with a relevant, perceptive message.  Sirk's films were about postcard-perfect lives with dark and very human underlying secrets.  Far from Heaven is the exact same type of movie, but one that is capable of transcending the cinematic melodramas of the 50's.Taking place in Connecticut of the late 1950's, Far from Heaven centers around a female protagonist named Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore).  Cathy is introduced to us as a perfectly polished, ideal housewife of the 1950's.  She is well respected by her peers, well groomed, and loves her family.  However, her life begins to shatter once she discovers that her husband Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a homosexual who has casual affairs with men that he meets on the street and in back-alley gay bars.  Frank himself doesn't approve of his behavior, and he and Cathy come to the conclusion that he should see a psychiatrist by the name of Dr. Bowman (James Rebhorn).Cathy finds escape from her life's imperfections by socializing with her gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert).  Raymond is a charming, handsome, and intelligent black man who has a passion for seeing color, or more specifically, whatever is on the surface of things.  Cathy wishes to continue her relationship with the loving Raymond, but finds that difficult when her gossipy, bigot peers begin to think that she and Raymond are having a sexual affair.  Cathy's life becomes excruciating, as her friends and neighbors of the racist area in which she lives discover more and more truth to what seemed to be a paradise-esque lifestyle in which she lived.Far from Heaven is the ultimate antipode to the other great period movie of 2002, Chicago.  Rob Marshall's musical Chicago was entertaining, bold, brassy, and the sort of film that people see to simply have a fun time (and, of course, there's nothing wrong with that).  Far from Heaven, on the other hand, is a solemn film that is message-laden and abstemious.  It is a thinking-person's masterpiece.The performances of Moore, Quaid, and Haysbert are all masterfully delivered.  The way in which Moore displays the character of Cathy makes her performance one of the year's best.  She is able to let the audience know that the kind-hearted Cathy is actually masking her troubles with her faade that everything is perfect and in control without stating so.  Quaid, who normally plays characters of great masculinity, is astonishing as the homosexual Frank.  He is convincing, and is able to show the character's inability to mend his problems while instead bottling them up inside to the point of unbearable angst with great skill.  Haysbert is charismatic as Raymond, and does not try to make the character a hero but instead succeeds in making him a symbol of discovering the true colors of people's lives (perhaps the ""Deagan"" of his name symbolizes his ""digging in"" of Cathy's actual feelings).The filmmaking of the movie is exquisite.  Sandy Powell's authentic costume design, Mark Friedberg's sumptuous production design, Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score, and Edward Lachman's gorgeous cinematography all capture the cinematic feel of 1950's films, and the overall feel of the movie's messages with proficiency.  In fact, the A-list collaborators also showcase color to the point where they seem to understand that this movie about how we must express feelings that we actually wish to hide must itself be textured with rich color and an aura of expression.Todd Haynes, who directed and wrote the screenplay to Far from Heaven, is certainly one of the most promising directors of our time.  Haynes handled everything about this movie with great ability and maturity.  Not once did Haynes dilute the themes of homoeroticism to an exploitative degree, nor did he ever become sanctimonious in stating the film's messages.  Haynes told the movie in a stylistically old-fashioned manner of storytelling, and meritoriously so.The film, although it takes place in the 1950's, is quite relevant to the society of the present day.  Not everyone will enjoy the often-depressing tone of the film, but they will admire its depth and wisdom.  It's the sort of movie that you watch to contemplate afterward, and this film will have anyone thinking about it once they are finished watching it.",5,A solemn triumph of sagacity and artistic filmmaking,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,4585,"['sagacious', 'poignant', 'homage', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'film', 'noir/women', 'movies', '1950', 'delivers', 'emotionally-powerful', 'story', 'successfully', 'allegorically', 'filmmaking', 'subject', 'matter', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'are', 'expertly', 'displayed', 'exact', 'old-fashioned', 'style', 'Sirk', 'movies', 'being', 'stylish', 'film', 'relevant', 'perceptive', 'message', 'Sirk', 'films', 'were', 'postcard-perfect', 'lives', 'dark', 'very', 'human', 'underlying', 'secrets', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'exact', 'same', 'type', 'movie', 'one', 'capable', 'transcending', 'cinematic', 'melodramas', ""50's.Taking"", 'place', 'Connecticut', 'late', '1950', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'centers', 'female', 'protagonist', 'named', 'Cathy', 'Whitaker', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Cathy', 'introduced', 'perfectly', 'polished', 'ideal', 'housewife', '1950', 'well', 'respected', 'peers', 'well', 'groomed', 'family', 'However', 'life', 'shatter', 'once', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'homosexual', 'who', 'casual', 'affairs', 'men', 'street', 'back-alley', 'gay', 'bars', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'approve', 'behavior', 'Cathy', 'come', 'conclusion', 'should', 'see', 'psychiatrist', 'name', 'Dr', 'Bowman', 'James', 'Rebhorn', '.Cathy', 'escape', 'life', 'imperfections', 'socializing', 'gardener', 'Raymond', 'Deagan', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Raymond', 'charming', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'passion', 'seeing', 'color', 'more', 'specifically', 'surface', 'things', 'Cathy', 'wishes', 'continue', 'relationship', 'loving', 'Raymond', 'difficult', 'when', 'gossipy', 'bigot', 'peers', 'begin', 'think', 'Raymond', 'are', 'having', 'sexual', 'affair', 'Cathy', 'life', 'excruciating', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'racist', 'area', 'discover', 'more', 'more', 'truth', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'paradise-esque', 'lifestyle', 'Heaven', 'ultimate', 'antipode', 'other', 'great', 'period', 'movie', '2002', 'Chicago', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'musical', 'Chicago', 'was', 'entertaining', 'bold', 'brassy', 'sort', 'film', 'people', 'see', 'simply', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'course', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'other', 'hand', 'solemn', 'film', 'message-laden', 'abstemious', 'thinking-person', 'masterpiece.The', 'performances', 'Moore', 'Quaid', 'Haysbert', 'are', 'masterfully', 'delivered', 'way', 'Moore', 'character', 'Cathy', 'performance', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'able', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'kind-hearted', 'Cathy', 'actually', 'masking', 'troubles', 'faade', 'everything', 'perfect', 'control', 'stating', 'so', 'Quaid', 'who', 'normally', 'characters', 'great', 'masculinity', 'astonishing', 'homosexual', 'Frank', 'convincing', 'able', 'show', 'character', 'inability', 'mend', 'problems', 'instead', 'bottling', 'up', 'inside', 'point', 'unbearable', 'angst', 'great', 'skill', 'Haysbert', 'charismatic', 'Raymond', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'character', 'hero', 'instead', 'making', 'symbol', 'discovering', 'true', 'colors', 'people', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'Deagan', 'name', 'digging', 'Cathy', 'actual', 'feelings', '.The', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'exquisite', 'Sandy', 'Powell', 'authentic', 'costume', 'design', 'Mark', 'Friedberg', 'sumptuous', 'production', 'design', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Edward', 'Lachman', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'capture', 'cinematic', 'feel', '1950', 'films', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'messages', 'proficiency', 'fact', 'A-list', 'collaborators', 'also', 'showcase', 'color', 'point', 'where', 'seem', 'understand', 'movie', 'how', 'must', 'express', 'feelings', 'actually', 'wish', 'hide', 'must', 'be', 'textured', 'rich', 'color', 'aura', 'expression.Todd', 'Haynes', 'who', 'directed', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'directors', 'time', 'Haynes', 'handled', 'everything', 'movie', 'great', 'ability', 'maturity', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'Haynes', 'dilute', 'themes', 'homoeroticism', 'exploitative', 'degree', 'did', 'ever', 'become', 'sanctimonious', 'stating', 'film', 'messages', 'Haynes', 'told', 'movie', 'stylistically', 'old-fashioned', 'manner', 'storytelling', 'meritoriously', 'so.The', 'film', 'place', '1950', 'quite', 'relevant', 'society', 'present', 'day', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'often-depressing', 'tone', 'film', 'will', 'admire', 'depth', 'wisdom', 'sort', 'movie', 'watch', 'contemplate', 'afterward', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'once', 'are', 'finished', 'watching']",N/A
