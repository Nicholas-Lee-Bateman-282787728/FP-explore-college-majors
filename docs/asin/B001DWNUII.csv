1183441,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001DWNUII,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","The gang's all here for this very funny 2008 Christmas special filmed at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - Walter, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Bubba J, Peanut, Jose the Jalape&ntilde;o on a Stick, and of course Jeff Dunham himself.  It goes without saying that you're going to be very entertained by Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special.  There will be more jokes than you can throw a jalape&ntilde;o on a stick at, comic banter that only the most talented of ventriloquists would even attempt to pull off, a reading of - with commentary by Peanut -The Night Before Christmas, and a couple of great Christmas songs.  I must admit the show wasn't quite as funny as I expected, but I think this has a lot to do with the fact that I was already quite familiar with all of Dunham's characters.Dunham opens the show with a monologue of about ten or eleven minutes.  It's a little strange to see him without a puppet, but he does prove that he can be funny on his own - albeit not as funny as he is with his special friends.  Fan favorites Walter and Achmed the Dead Terrorist get the most time on stage.  Dunham has only limited success in getting the curmudgeonly Walter into the Christmas spirit, but Achmed ends up entertaining all of us infidels with a great Jingle Bells parody called Jingle Bombs.  Next up, and straight from the trailer park, is Bubba J, who gives Achmed quite a run for his money with his own Christmas classic, Roadkill Christmas.  Of course, you can't have a Jeff Dunham show without Peanut there to liven things up, and then Jose the Jalape&ntilde;o on a Stick joins both Jeff and Peanut onstage.  The comedy does get a little risqu&eacute; at times and, of course, the politically correct crowd out there will cry and moan about Dunham's ""culturally insensitive"" jokes, oblivious to the fact that Dunham is an equal opportunity offender who is happy to poke fun at just about any group out there.  Personally, I say more power to him, but I think it is important to note that this comedy special isn't really something that most parents will want their younger children watching.I do have a couple of minor issues with this special, however.  First and foremost, I was surprised and disappointed to hear some words beeped out - a few of which probably wouldn't even be beeped out on Comedy Central.  This isn't a children's video, so I see no point in allowing a censor to get his grubby hands on this product before it was released.  That brings me to the editing of this video in general, which appears to have been done by a fourth grader.  The first half of this video features two of the clumsiest and most sloppy edits I've ever seen.  It's like someone cut out a chunk of the film and just taped the two sides back together.  Fortunately, these problems don't come close to putting a dent in the fun unleashed by Dunham and the gang in this Christmas special.  Unless you lie awake at night worrying about the hurt feelings of mad terrorists who want to kill you, you're going to love Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special.",4,It may not be politically correct but it sure is funny,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,3078,"['gang', 'here', 'very', 'funny', '2008', 'Christmas', 'special', 'filmed', 'Pabst', 'Theater', 'Milwaukee', 'Wisconsin', 'Walter', 'Achmed', 'Dead', 'Terrorist', 'Bubba', 'J', 'Peanut', 'Jose', 'Jalape', 'ntilde', 'o', 'Stick', 'course', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'saying', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'entertained', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'Very', 'Special', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'jokes', 'can', 'throw', 'jalape', 'ntilde', 'o', 'stick', 'comic', 'banter', 'only', 'most', 'talented', 'ventriloquists', 'would', 'even', 'attempt', 'pull', 'off', 'reading', 'commentary', 'Peanut', '-The', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'couple', 'great', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'must', 'admit', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'expected', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'was', 'already', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Dunham', 'characters.Dunham', 'show', 'monologue', 'about', 'ten', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'little', 'strange', 'see', 'puppet', 'prove', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'own', 'albeit', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'special', 'friends', 'Fan', 'Walter', 'Achmed', 'Dead', 'Terrorist', 'get', 'most', 'time', 'stage', 'Dunham', 'only', 'limited', 'success', 'getting', 'curmudgeonly', 'Walter', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'Achmed', 'up', 'entertaining', 'infidels', 'great', 'Jingle', 'Bells', 'parody', 'called', 'Jingle', 'Bombs', 'Next', 'up', 'straight', 'trailer', 'park', 'Bubba', 'J', 'who', 'Achmed', 'quite', 'run', 'money', 'own', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'Roadkill', 'Christmas', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'show', 'Peanut', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'then', 'Jose', 'Jalape', 'ntilde', 'o', 'Stick', 'Jeff', 'Peanut', 'onstage', 'comedy', 'get', 'little', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'times', 'course', 'politically', 'correct', 'crowd', 'there', 'will', 'cry', 'moan', 'Dunham', 'culturally', 'insensitive', 'jokes', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'Dunham', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'offender', 'who', 'happy', 'poke', 'fun', 'just', 'group', 'there', 'Personally', 'say', 'more', 'power', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'comedy', 'special', ""n't"", 'really', 'something', 'most', 'parents', 'will', 'want', 'younger', 'children', 'watching.I', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'minor', 'issues', 'special', 'however', 'First', 'foremost', 'was', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'words', 'beeped', 'out', 'few', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'beeped', 'out', 'Comedy', 'Central', ""n't"", 'children', 'video', 'so', 'see', 'point', 'allowing', 'censor', 'get', 'grubby', 'hands', 'product', 'was', 'released', 'editing', 'video', 'general', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'fourth', 'grader', 'first', 'half', 'video', 'two', 'clumsiest', 'most', 'sloppy', 'edits', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'someone', 'cut', 'out', 'chunk', 'film', 'just', 'taped', 'two', 'sides', 'back', 'together', 'Fortunately', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'putting', 'dent', 'fun', 'unleashed', 'Dunham', 'gang', 'Christmas', 'special', 'lie', 'awake', 'night', 'worrying', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'mad', 'terrorists', 'who', 'want', 'kill', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'Very', 'Special', 'Christmas', 'Special']",Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special

Most of the special features are short, but funny. One of the special features allows you to go directly to which ever character, in the routine, you want to see (kind of like a chapter selection). There are a few, some might consider, cons to this DVD. 1) Some of the cussing is bleeped out, while other words that are just as bad, are not, 2) there is a lot of sex type jokes or sexual orientated jokes that are definitely not for children and 3) I guess depending on your humor and your own comfort level of sexual orientation ... there are several gay jokes of which some people may find offensive.Overall, it is typical Jeff Dunham adult humor with a Christmas theme, of which often gets side-tracked. I would like to have given this 5 stars for the humor, but I had to take off one star due to the adult humor mixed with Christmas, without a parental advisory for children.",4,"Very funny, but not for children",1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,1009,"['usual', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'hilarious', 'Walter', 'Achmed', 'Bubba', 'J.', 'Peanut/Jose', 'Jalapeno', 'are', 'featured', 'stand-up', 'episode', 'Most', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'short', 'funny', 'One', 'special', 'features', 'go', 'directly', 'ever', 'character', 'routine', 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'chapter', 'selection', 'are', 'few', 'might', 'consider', 'cons', 'DVD', '1', 'cussing', 'bleeped', 'out', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'are', 'not', '2', 'lot', 'sex', 'type', 'jokes', 'sexual', 'orientated', 'jokes', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', '3', 'guess', 'depending', 'humor', 'own', 'comfort', 'level', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'are', 'several', 'gay', 'jokes', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'offensive.Overall', 'typical', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'adult', 'humor', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'often', 'side-tracked', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'humor', 'had', 'take', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'due', 'adult', 'humor', 'mixed', 'Christmas', 'parental', 'advisory', 'children']",Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special
