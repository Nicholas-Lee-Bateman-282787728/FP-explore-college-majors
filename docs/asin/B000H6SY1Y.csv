1010758,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000H6SY1Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[38, 39]","It's hard to believe it's been a dozen years since James Lipton started his seminal interview series on the Bravo cable network, ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" but it has proven to be one of the more substantive entries in the talk show genre. With one guest per show, the focus has always been on the professional dimension, specifically on the craft of acting as experienced by the subject. Recently, in an obvious attempt to attract broader audiences, Lipton has been recruiting younger, relatively unproven talents with meager track records, and the results have been less than revelatory. Fortunately, this three-disc DVD set shows how good the show can be when the subject has already reached legendary status.Four figures, all past their sixtieth birthdays and all prominent film stars who have worn multiple hats over the past half-century, are spotlighted here - Paul Newman from 1994, Barbra Streisand and Clint Eastwood from 2003 and Robert Redford from 2004. As proven clearly with these interviews, Lipton has been amazingly consistent with each show beginning with the sometimes mind-numbing depth of research he gathers in preparation, i.e., his voluminous stack of blue index cards. He starts the conversation by probing the guest about his or her origins and tracking them chronologically through personal and professional milestones and achievements. The difference between Lipton and other talk show hosts is that he does not dwell on tabloid gossip or personal expos&eacute;s but rather draws out what it took for the actor to achieve certain noteworthy performances or accomplishments.Each star reveals quite a bit of his or her creative process along the way, and much of the credit for the disclosures has to be given to Lipton. Even though he can come across as a pompous sycophant, he compensates by eliciting truly fascinating responses from his subjects. As the first guest of the series and the only one of the four who is an actual Actors Studio alumnus, Newman is inevitably the most fluent when discussing acting techniques and characteristically the most modest about his talents. Both Redford and Eastwood get more animated talking about their roles as filmmakers than actors, though both share generous amounts of information about their years of struggle.Unsurprisingly, the Streisand interview is the most wide-ranging since a particularly worshipful Lipton and she discuss her singing career and politics as much as her acting and filmmaking ventures. Of course, all four are subjected to the familiar Bernard Pivot questionnaire, which yields some insightful responses despite its veneer of pretense, and this is followed by a more open-ended Q&A; with the drama school students. The 2006 DVD set includes Lipton's erudite introductions to each interview. Except for Streisand, there are also excised moments included as a bonus feature for each of the subjects called ""Great Moments That Didn't Make the Cut"". The footage is marginally entertaining, but the edits were wisely made for the most part.",5,Fascinating Glimpses into the Careers and Creative Processes of Four Legends,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,3035,"['hard', 'believe', 'been', 'dozen', 'years', 'James', 'Lipton', 'started', 'seminal', 'interview', 'series', 'Bravo', 'cable', 'network', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'proven', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'substantive', 'entries', 'talk', 'show', 'genre', 'one', 'guest', 'show', 'focus', 'always', 'been', 'professional', 'dimension', 'specifically', 'craft', 'acting', 'experienced', 'subject', 'Recently', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'attract', 'broader', 'audiences', 'Lipton', 'been', 'recruiting', 'younger', 'relatively', 'unproven', 'talents', 'meager', 'track', 'records', 'results', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'revelatory', 'Fortunately', 'three-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'subject', 'already', 'reached', 'legendary', 'status.Four', 'figures', 'past', 'sixtieth', 'birthdays', 'prominent', 'film', 'stars', 'who', 'have', 'worn', 'multiple', 'hats', 'past', 'half-century', 'are', 'spotlighted', 'here', 'Paul', 'Newman', '1994', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '2003', 'Robert', 'Redford', '2004', 'proven', 'clearly', 'interviews', 'Lipton', 'been', 'amazingly', 'consistent', 'show', 'beginning', 'sometimes', 'mind-numbing', 'depth', 'research', 'preparation', 'i.e.', 'voluminous', 'stack', 'blue', 'index', 'cards', 'conversation', 'probing', 'guest', 'origins', 'tracking', 'chronologically', 'personal', 'professional', 'milestones', 'achievements', 'difference', 'Lipton', 'other', 'talk', 'show', 'not', 'dwell', 'tabloid', 'gossip', 'personal', 'expos', 'eacute', 'rather', 'out', 'what', 'took', 'actor', 'achieve', 'certain', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'accomplishments.Each', 'star', 'reveals', 'quite', 'bit', 'creative', 'process', 'way', 'much', 'credit', 'disclosures', 'be', 'given', 'Lipton', 'Even', 'can', 'come', 'pompous', 'sycophant', 'eliciting', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'responses', 'subjects', 'first', 'guest', 'series', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'who', 'actual', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'alumnus', 'Newman', 'inevitably', 'most', 'fluent', 'when', 'discussing', 'acting', 'techniques', 'characteristically', 'most', 'modest', 'talents', 'Redford', 'Eastwood', 'get', 'more', 'animated', 'talking', 'roles', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'share', 'generous', 'amounts', 'information', 'years', 'struggle.Unsurprisingly', 'Streisand', 'interview', 'most', 'wide-ranging', 'particularly', 'worshipful', 'Lipton', 'singing', 'career', 'politics', 'as', 'much', 'acting', 'filmmaking', 'ventures', 'course', 'four', 'are', 'subjected', 'familiar', 'Bernard', 'Pivot', 'questionnaire', 'insightful', 'responses', 'veneer', 'pretense', 'followed', 'more', 'open-ended', 'Q', 'A', 'drama', 'school', 'students', '2006', 'DVD', 'set', 'Lipton', 'erudite', 'introductions', 'interview', 'Streisand', 'are', 'also', 'excised', 'moments', 'included', 'bonus', 'feature', 'subjects', 'called', 'Great', 'Moments', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Cut', 'footage', 'marginally', 'entertaining', 'edits', 'were', 'wisely', 'made', 'most', 'part']",Inside The Actors Studio - Icons: Paul Newman / Robert Redford / Barbra Streisand / Clint Eastwood

They have interesting things to say and don't talk about themselves, themselves, themselves, themselves!The same can not be said for Ms. Striesand, however. Me, me, me, I, I, I, I, look at me, hear me, listen to me, watch ME ME ME. It's kinda sickening.Consider the masters and the geniuses that have collaborated with Ms. Striesand. Do they get any mention? Any credit? Any thanks? I would have LOVED to hear about James Wong Howe, or Paul Williams, or any one of the dozens of creative geniuses who made her look so much better than she actually is. Bot no. She apparently gets off on presenting her ""career"" as something she achieved all by herself!NOT>And I almost fell out of my chair at the end when Lipton asks the ""Five Questions."" When he asks her what job she would like to do LEAST, she says ""Be a podiatrist. Working with people's feet? ICKKKK!""Did she REALLY do that? Did she REALLY alienate and offend every decent, worthwhile, necessary,vitally important,hard-working and tax-paying American foot doctor in her fan-base?????I was MORTIFIED. My podiatrist is a GODSEND. I would buy his albums over Striesand's any day. If he recorded. But he doesn't. He's too busy helping people.
