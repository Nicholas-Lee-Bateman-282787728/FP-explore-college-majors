Is that why Olivia de Havilland (her sister in real life) couldn't stand her? Joan does a lot of hair touching and has an endearing if ludicrous habit of smiling broadly when having just deceived someone. Her fat sour aging old uncle can see right through her and is horrible to her. She takes a lot of negativity from other people  in her stride to the point that while we know she is ""born to be bad"" she's also quite appealing. She snitches people's boyfriends and sleeps around and manipulates everyone and everything. Not surprsing given how boring are the other characters around her. Stay and watch the alternative ending (dvd) which is a scream (waking up in hospital from a suicide attempt she immediately ties to seduce the wealthy doctor hovering over her).Lots of fun and Joan is very good indeed.",4,Stop Smiling About It,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,954,"['enjoyable', 'slightly', 'camp', 'flick', 'naughty', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'infiltrating', 'polite', 'society', 'lying', 'cheating', 'deceiving', 'get', 'ahead', 'why', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'sister', 'real', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Joan', 'lot', 'hair', 'touching', 'endearing', 'ludicrous', 'habit', 'smiling', 'broadly', 'when', 'having', 'just', 'deceived', 'someone', 'fat', 'sour', 'aging', 'old', 'uncle', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'horrible', 'lot', 'negativity', 'other', 'people', 'stride', 'point', 'know', 'born', 'be', 'bad', 'also', 'quite', 'appealing', 'people', 'boyfriends', 'sleeps', 'everyone', 'everything', 'Not', 'surprsing', 'given', 'how', 'boring', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'Stay', 'watch', 'alternative', 'ending', 'dvd', 'scream', 'waking', 'up', 'hospital', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'immediately', 'seduce', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'hovering', '.Lots', 'fun', 'Joan', 'very', 'good', 'indeed']",N/A
272079,A1NYNVYDEZEQNL,6301913914,"Charles Reichenthal ""churei""","[3, 3]","BORN TO BE BAD remains a solid Nicholas Ray work, although its plot is a bit of a shambles.  Nonetheless, its look at the theater and arts worlds rings with a good deal of truth, especially re the 'user' of other people at any cost.  Ray has indicated that Joan Leslie was the one cast member who listened to his ideas and was eager to bring justice to what could have been a stereotypical part.  And Leslie is the best in the film.  Mel Ferrer surprises, too, with his role as an artist (sexual orientation in question).  Fontaine, of course, provides a fine job as a scheming beauty (whose movements should be obvious to all).  Robert Ryan and Zachery Scott do well with less-defined roles.  This film is one of solid workmanship that overrides its deficiencies in plot motivations.

272080,A23UB49EG29MVT,6301913914,Commenter77,"[0, 0]","Enjoying this anew lately. I had to see Joan Fontaine play a villainess ... What would that be like? I thought her portrayal was pretty realistic in that she showed deliberation in her machinations, but also a caught-off-guard response when her stratagems blew up. It's where this character is. It appears this is this girl's first time out or close to it. She seems to be a little too carefully brought up, as the expression goes. It looked more like she was under a tight leash. The uncle was always dour toward her and somewhat suspicious. The aunt is hovering and condescending. She almost reminds her to drink a nice glass of warm milk before bed. This is a grown girl. Perhaps she had a history of manipulative behavior and they were exercising precautions for that reason. But, perhaps they were over-protective and controlling. She really seemed to be someone let out of a cage. Perhaps she had been so hemmed in, she felt she had to grab what was around her and quick if she were to have anything for herself. Maybe it was not so much a case of being born to be bad, but inadvertently bred to be, through suffocation. Whatever it was, she was very ill adapted for life.This is a strong cast. Maybe it was the character, but I liked Mel Ferrer in this very much, while not liking him anywhere else. Maybe he does laid back better than aggressive, and didn't get a lot of chances to do that. Joan Leslie was very pretty and natural, convincing, especially in the earlier part. Her make-up with Scott seemed a little pat, but maybe that's the fault of the script or direction. Zachary Scott (Curtis) seems also to do mellow well and is convincing early on. His assertive scenes later on seemed overdone. Nick (Robert Ryan) seems a bit quixotic in that he's just hard to get along with at first, gets himself reeled in, but really does a whiplash in the final scene with Christabel. I guess that was righteous indignation, but it seemed too sharp a turn. You wonder how little Miss Chris would have fared had they gotten together. Somehow, you can't picture her getting away with the stuff she pulled on Curtis. Nick was a lot quicker on the intake.I think Fontaine did well depicting this young girl at the beginning stage of a downward spiral. It's a girl attempting to play the game of what is expected from a milk and water miss and grasping for what she can get at the same time. There's continual tension in that double booking, and Ms. Fontaine reflects that throughout. Christabel moves too fast at times, slips up and shows her hand. Then she scrambles to right herself, usually too late.  She's learning as she goes. Seeing her about to drive away at the end, you get the clear picture that, with the restraints of relatives and reputation gone, she's set to cut her losses and go on from there.  And, it will be a new and tighter game. It will no longer be necessary to play the young girl who arrived on the ""wrong night.""Found this very interesting overall and with respect to various of the seasoned players.  Hopefully this will come around to DVD.

272082,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301913914,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""Born to be Bad"" is a RKO black and white melodrama based on the 1928 Anne Parrish novel ""All Kneeling"". It was directed by Nicholas Ray and produced while Howard Hughes was the head of RKO.Note - There is a 1934 ""Born to be Bad"" film starring Loretta Young and Cary Grant, but it is a very different film.Joan Fontaine (1917) plays the girl who was born to be bad. Of course at age 33, she is a little too old to be playing a ""girl"" so despite her acting ability, she never really fits the bill. Fontaine is the younger sister of film great Olivia de Havilland and was a star in her own right. Fontaine was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won for ""Suspicion"" (1941) - the only actor to ever win an Oscar in a Hitchcock film. She worked with Hitch the previous year in his American debut, ""Rebecca"", and among her other notable films were ""The Constant Nymph"" (1943), ""Jane Eyre"" (1944), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Island in the Sun"" (1957).Rugged Robert Ryan (1909-73) plays an aspiring author. Ryan made nearly 100 films between 1940 and 1973. In his early years he often played a villain especially in film noir dramas (""Crossfire"", ""The Set Up""), then transitioned into the tough guy with a good heart role (""On Dangerous Ground"").  My personal favorite Ryan role is Deke Thornton in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).FWIW - Ray insisted on Ryan for this part and this was the first of 5 films they made together.Handsome Zachary Scott (1914-65) often played a scoundrel in films like ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) and ""Shadow on the Wall"" (1950), often paired with Ann Sothern, Nancy Davis, or Joan Crawford. In this one he plays a wealthy man who is the object of Fontaine's greed. To my taste, Scott was always better as a villain.FWIW - many believe that the pencil moustache on Scott and his love of flying was director Ray's way to mock RKO head Howard Hughes who was having a romance with Fontaine.Adorable Joan Leslie (1925) plays Scott's fianc&eacute;. She's best known as Cagney's wife from the Oscar winning ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942) and as the crippled girl from ""High Sierra"" (1941). Both these films were nearly a decade earlier, and fans of Leslie will enjoy how much she matured in that time, yet still retained her great acting skills.Mel Ferrer (1917-2008) plays a gay artist. He appeared in more than 100 films, the most famous of which were ""War and Peace"" (1956) and ""Scaramouche"" (1952). He also worked as a director (""Green Mansions"") and producer (""Wait Until Dark"", ""El Greco"") and preferred behind the camera work to acting. I've never been a fan of Ferrer and there's nothing here to make me change my mind.Director Nicholas Ray (1911-79) is best known for ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1956) for which he received an Oscar nomination (winner Delbert Mann for ""Marty""). He also received a Cannes Film Festival nomination for ""The Savage Innocents"" (1960) and Venice Film Festival nominations for ""Bitter Victory"" (1957) and ""Bigger than Life"" (1956). My absolute favorite Ray film is the western ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954). Ray favored youth and rebels (Ben Cooper in ""Johnny Guitar"", James Dean in ""Rebel without a Cause"") so Fontaine's character fits the bill.Much like the battle between the good and evil women in ""Johnny Guitar"", ""Born to be Bad"" focuses on the differences between the career oriented Leslie and the husband seeking Fontaine. There is also some similarity with ""All About Eve"" where Bette Davis is pitted against Anne Baxter. Dueling women were also prominent plot points in ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""Rebecca"" (1940), ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" (1962), ""Alien"" (1979), ""Kill Bill"" (2003), and ""Hanna"" (2011).The NY Times said the film ""is so overheated at times that it threatens to lapse into self-parody; though this never happens...""1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"".Bottom line - battling women is always a good idea, but the casting in this film lessens the value. Look how much better Bette Davis and Anne Baxter were that same year in ""All About Eve"".",2,"""About as helpless as a wildcat""",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,4422,"['Born', 'be', 'Bad', 'RKO', 'black', 'white', 'melodrama', 'based', '1928', 'Anne', 'Parrish', 'Kneeling', 'was', 'directed', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'produced', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'was', 'head', 'RKO.Note', '1934', 'Born', 'be', 'Bad', 'film', 'starring', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'very', 'different', 'film.Joan', 'Fontaine', '1917', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'bad', 'course', 'age', '33', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'girl', 'so', 'acting', 'ability', 'never', 'really', 'bill', 'Fontaine', 'younger', 'sister', 'film', 'great', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'was', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'Fontaine', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '3', 'times', 'won', 'Suspicion', '1941', 'only', 'actor', 'ever', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'worked', 'Hitch', 'previous', 'year', 'American', 'debut', 'Rebecca', 'other', 'notable', 'films', 'were', 'Constant', 'Nymph', '1943', 'Jane', 'Eyre', '1944', 'Ivanhoe', '1952', 'Island', 'Sun', '1957', '.Rugged', 'Robert', 'Ryan', '1909-73', 'aspiring', 'author', 'Ryan', 'made', 'nearly', '100', 'films', '1940', '1973', 'early', 'years', 'often', 'played', 'villain', 'especially', 'film', 'noir', 'dramas', 'Crossfire', 'Set', 'Up', 'then', 'transitioned', 'tough', 'guy', 'good', 'heart', 'role', 'Dangerous', 'Ground', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Ryan', 'role', 'Deke', 'Thornton', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', '.FWIW', 'Ray', 'insisted', 'Ryan', 'part', 'was', 'first', '5', 'films', 'made', 'together.Handsome', 'Zachary', 'Scott', '1914-65', 'often', 'played', 'scoundrel', 'films', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', '1945', 'Shadow', 'Wall', '1950', 'often', 'paired', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'Nancy', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'one', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'object', 'Fontaine', 'greed', 'taste', 'Scott', 'was', 'always', 'better', 'villain.FWIW', 'many', 'believe', 'pencil', 'moustache', 'Scott', 'love', 'flying', 'was', 'director', 'Ray', 'way', 'mock', 'RKO', 'head', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'romance', 'Fontaine.Adorable', 'Joan', 'Leslie', '1925', 'Scott', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'best', 'known', 'Cagney', 'wife', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', '1942', 'crippled', 'girl', 'High', 'Sierra', '1941', 'films', 'were', 'nearly', 'decade', 'earlier', 'fans', 'Leslie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'how', 'much', 'matured', 'time', 'yet', 'still', 'retained', 'great', 'acting', 'skills.Mel', 'Ferrer', '1917-2008', 'gay', 'artist', 'appeared', 'more', '100', 'films', 'most', 'famous', 'were', 'War', 'Peace', '1956', 'Scaramouche', '1952', 'also', 'worked', 'director', 'Green', 'Mansions', 'producer', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'El', 'Greco', 'preferred', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Ferrer', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'change', 'mind.Director', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', '1911-79', 'best', 'known', 'Rebel', 'Cause', '1956', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'winner', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'Marty', 'also', 'received', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'nomination', 'Savage', 'Innocents', '1960', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'nominations', 'Bitter', 'Victory', '1957', 'Bigger', 'Life', '1956', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Ray', 'film', 'western', 'Johnny', 'Guitar', '1954', 'Ray', 'favored', 'youth', 'rebels', 'Ben', 'Cooper', 'Johnny', 'Guitar', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'so', 'Fontaine', 'character', 'bill.Much', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'women', 'Johnny', 'Guitar', 'Born', 'be', 'Bad', 'differences', 'career', 'oriented', 'Leslie', 'husband', 'seeking', 'Fontaine', 'also', 'similarity', 'Eve', 'where', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'pitted', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'Dueling', 'women', 'were', 'also', 'prominent', 'plot', 'points', 'Gone', 'Wind', '1939', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '1939', 'Rebecca', '1940', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', '1962', 'Alien', '1979', 'Kill', 'Bill', '2003', 'Hanna', '2011', '.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'said', 'film', 'so', 'overheated', 'times', 'lapse', 'self-parody', 'never', '1950', 'was', 'good', 'year', 'films', 'Oscars', 'Eve', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Cyrano', 'Actor', 'Born', 'yesterday', 'Actress', 'top', 'grossers', 'included', 'Cinderella', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'Annie', 'Get', 'Gun', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Other', 'notable', 'films', 'released', '1950', 'were', 'Asphalt', 'Jungle', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Glass', 'Menagerie', 'Rashomon', 'Third', 'Man', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', '.Bottom', 'line', 'battling', 'women', 'always', 'good', 'idea', 'casting', 'film', 'value', 'Look', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'were', 'same', 'year', 'Eve']",N/A

272084,AL0C7WML6GMEA,6301913914,"F. Jarlett ""Movie Maniac""","[12, 12]","I have noticed that most reviews of Nicholas Ray's works usually don't mention this film.  Perhaps people expect and want a film that shows Ray's distinctive style of film making. Screenplay is well written, acting very good, direction as usual competent Ray. Ryan able to successfully interpret the writer role. His scenes with Fontaine project the requisite sexual chemistry to make their interactions fascinating. One wonders whether they had something going on behind the scenes.The drama is not as intense as it could have been, but the story is nevertheless engrossing. Fontaine's portrayal of the venal central character was subtle enough to make her scenes more interesting than they could have been in the hands of another actress. Some reviewers have stated that the story wasn't convincing because nobody in real life could ever be bamboozled by Fontaine's character. I beg to differ, because I have met a number of people in my day who were narcissistic in the same manner. The various characters' reactions to Fontaine's character were entirely logical to me.The only unfortunate fact about the film is that the ending was recut to reflect a less depressing conclusion. The whole bit about Zachary Scott coming to his senses by flying his plane seems to reflect Howard Hughes' meddlesome habit of ordering films to be endlessly recut. There were a number of Robert Ryan films done at RKO that suffered a similar fate in the editing room.I have Born To Be Bad on laserdisc, and the picture is quite clear. If anyone wants a better picture than the VHS, their only choice is a laserdisc. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for someone to decide to put it on DVD.

Forstadt,"[2, 8]","BORN TO BE BAD is a flawed movie about orphaned young woman Christabel Caine (Joan Fontaine) who comes to stay with rich cousin Curtis Carey (Zachary Scott) and manages to break up his engagement through feigned sweetness while engaging in an affair with promising writer Nick Bradley (Robert Ryan). Eventually, Christabel drops Nick and opportunistically marries the newly-available Curtis. It all seems too easy. Apparently, she really loves Nick, but loves money more. Or something like that. As much as I love Joan Fontaine, I had a hard time with this soap opera of a movie for many reasons.For one thing, Nick is so intolerably smug and arrogant that the part almost seems to be played for laughs by Ryan with lines like, ""Have I told you lately how much you love me?"" What could anybody possibly see in this guy? Christabel Caine herself is played too sweetly, and it is hard to imagine her as the scheming gold-digger, even though we know she is. Mel Ferrer plays a painter who smirks a lot, but doesn't really add any value to the picture. At least the movie seems to have gotten enough notice to be believably spoofed by Carol Burnett as ""Raised to be Rotten,"" but I think that it parodies itself effectively enough without Burnett's help. The fact that Howard Hughes meddled significantly in the production of this movie goes a long way toward explaining what went wrong with the picture. Director Nicholas Ray (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE) can justifiably claim a mulligan with this picture. The rest of his career is noteworthy.To her credit, Fontaine later claimed that ""the only acceptable part of the film was my wardrobe."" It is not her worst film (MAID'S NIGHT OUT has that honor in my book), but neither is it a very worthwhile movie to see unless you are a die-hard Fontaine fan.Jeremy W.

272090,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6301913914,Only-A-Child,"[9, 9]","Director Nicholas Ray managed to take his revenge on RKO's Howard Hughes with this real life ""Citizen Kane"". Hughes was obsessively pursuing Joan Fontaine whose post WWII career was going nowhere. Like Hearst's intervention in Marion Davies' career, Hughes got Fontaine the lead in Ray's ""Born To Be Bad"" and then meddled in the production to insure that the film became a promotional vehicle for her.Whatever Ray may have thought of this it was not a complete disaster. Although the 32 year-old Fontaine is not credible in the role of a young business school student, if you suspend disbelief about the age factor, her performance is the equal of Anne Baxter's in ""All About Eve"". The same thing could be said of Davies; while her career was mismanaged by Hearst's inappropriate casting, her talent was still able to shine through.Although not give final cut, Ray somehow was able to turn ""Born To Be Bad"" into a self- parodying melodrama that reflected much of the Hughes-Fontaine relationship. Even making Fontaine's mark (wealthy Curtis Carey-played by Zachary Scott) into a Hughes look- alike, complete with pencil mustashe and a passion for flying.Unlike Orsen Welles, Ray made a lot of women's pictures, a quality ""Citizen Kane"" does not share with ""Born To Be Bad"". Fontaine plays master manipulator Christabel Caine (not Kane), not quite a sociopath but a woman with little sign of a conscience. Unlike most of these women's pictures, it is the men who she has trouble fooling with her innocent act. Cunning gay artist Gobby (Mel Ferrer)) finds her a kindred spirit and novelist Nick (Robert Ryan) is turned on by her greed and lack of moral/ethical boundaries.Ray has Fontaine play the character in a nice self-parodying style that actually makes her somewhat sympathetic to the viewer, at least for those who can take a guilty pleasure watching her turn on the charm. Unlike her sister, the eternally earthy Olivia deHavilland, age made Fontaine brittle and well suited to villainess roles. With cute little smiles and feigned reaction shots Fontaine keeps the film vicious for its entire length.Like Ray's ""Johnny Guitar"", this is a film about two women, one good and one bad (there is no subtlety), who vie for the same man. It is a battle of Joans, as Donna is played by gorgeous Joan Leslie (""Sgt. York""). Donna is a publishing house editor, postwar America was still adjusting to the vocational progress women had made during the war. But the evil Christabel explicitly rejects career opportunities (one can't imagine her contributing to the war effort) in favor of setting herself up for life by landing a rich husband she can set up for a lucrative divorce settlement.Leslie and Ferrer are especially good in the film. Leslie gives the only restrained performance, which is more powerful because it contrasts so sharply with the overplayed performances Ray gets from the rest of his cast.Then again, what do I know?
