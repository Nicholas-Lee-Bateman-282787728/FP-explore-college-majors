308119,A3VO8PWBGPYXIS,6302331161,Dean A. Bengen,"[4, 5]","This DVD at $17 plus was a little pricey for a 1988 film, but compared to many cheap BD that offer a picture no better than their DVD counterparts, this is a vast improvement over the films VHS version. Switching Channels DVD has no extras, in fact it does not even have a menu, just a great picture.As for the film, all three actors Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds,and Christopher Reeve were just starting to turn the corner on their acting careers and beginning their downward slope. Kathleen Turner would be diagnosed with rhematoid arthritis in 92, Burt would suffer PR problems with his breakup with Loni in 93, and Christopher Reeve would suffer his riding accident in 95.But for this film in 1988, all three actors were in top form in their performances.The result is a very entertaining comedy that fans of these stars should not miss.",5,Picture resolution of this DVD approaches Blueray quality.,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,842,"['DVD', '17', 'was', 'little', 'pricey', '1988', 'film', 'compared', 'many', 'cheap', 'BD', 'offer', 'picture', 'no', 'better', 'DVD', 'counterparts', 'vast', 'improvement', 'films', 'VHS', 'version', 'Switching', 'Channels', 'DVD', 'extras', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'menu', 'just', 'great', 'picture.As', 'film', 'three', 'actors', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'were', 'just', 'starting', 'turn', 'corner', 'acting', 'careers', 'beginning', 'downward', 'slope', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'would', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'rhematoid', 'arthritis', '92', 'Burt', 'would', 'suffer', 'PR', 'problems', 'breakup', 'Loni', '93', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'would', 'suffer', 'riding', 'accident', '95.But', 'film', '1988', 'three', 'actors', 'were', 'top', 'form', 'performances.The', 'result', 'very', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'fans', 'stars', 'should', 'not', 'miss']",N/A

308123,A1X1DGT3R69J3W,6302331161,"K. Nesler ""Hopeless Romantic""","[3, 10]","A dry, tired remake of ""His Girl Friday"".  Burt Reynolds, who I kind of like, just can't take the place of Cary Grant.  Actually, there are few who could take Grant's place.  The story line of this movie depends on fast paced dialog to keep it moving and funny.  I'm sorry, but I didn't think Burt Reynolds and Kathlene Turner pulled this off the same way Cary Grant and Roseland Russel could.  And, as much as I like Christopher Reeves he just wasn't a match for Randolph Scott.  Maybe if you haven't seen the original, you might enjoy this, maybe.  My advice is don't waste your time on this one and watch ""His Girl Friday"" instead.  By the way, I think Hugh Grant could have pulled off this movie in place of Cary Grant.  Hugh is able to maintain fast paced and very funny dialog.  Watch ""Two Weeks Notice"" if you want to see Hugh Grant in action.Also, if you want a good ""screwball comedy"" in the same vain as some of Cary Grant's work, try ""What's up Doc"".  Ryan O'Neal actually studied Cary Grant's work before he did the part in the movie.  You can really see that O'Neal tried to emulate Grant's style.  O'Neal asked Grant for his advice on being funny and Cary said, in that wonderful Cary voice of his, ""Wear silk underwear.""",2,I couldn't finish it.,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,1235,"['dry', 'tired', 'remake', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'kind', 'like', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Actually', 'are', 'few', 'who', 'could', 'take', 'Grant', 'place', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'dialog', 'keep', 'moving', 'funny', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Kathlene', 'Turner', 'pulled', 'off', 'same', 'way', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Roseland', 'Russel', 'could', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'match', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'might', 'enjoy', 'maybe', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'one', 'watch', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'instead', 'way', 'think', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'movie', 'place', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Hugh', 'able', 'maintain', 'fast', 'paced', 'very', 'funny', 'dialog', 'Watch', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'want', 'see', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'action.Also', 'want', 'good', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'same', 'vain', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'work', 'try', 'What', 'up', 'Doc', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'actually', 'studied', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'work', 'did', 'part', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'see', ""O'Neal"", 'tried', 'emulate', 'Grant', 'style', ""O'Neal"", 'asked', 'Grant', 'advice', 'being', 'funny', 'Cary', 'said', 'wonderful', 'Cary', 'voice', 'Wear', 'silk', 'underwear']",N/A

This is a highly enjoyable and entertaining remake of His Girl Friday and The Front Page.  Ted Kotcheff (First Blood:Rambo, Whose Killing the Great Chefs of Europe-also one of the producers of Law and Order Special Victims Unit) directs with terrific pacing and a wonderfully likeable cast that includes Henry Gibson, Kathleen Turner(giving one of her absolute best performances-which is saying quite a lot), Christopher Reeve in a brilliant and over the top comedic turn, Burt Reynolds (charming as usual) and Ned Beatty who basically steals the show from everyone in every single scene he is in.

I purchased this product a few days ago and got it in the mail (and despite what amazon's listing says, it IS in widescreen.) However the film has been broadcast in high definition on various movie channels over the past year or so and having to watch it in standard definition is definitely a step back especially when it looks like Sony has done little to clean up the film and make it look a little better. Picture quality on DVD is rather lackluster but just to have it in widescreen on DVD is a good thing. I just wish Sony would follow Warner Brothers lead and produce Blu-Ray discs on demand as well. I'm happy to finally own ""Switching Channels"" on DVD but I'm definitely keeping my HD recording of the movie on my DVR.

Kathleen Turner has a wonderful comedic sense and is as fast and funny as Rosalind Russell (maybe more so), while managing to be glamorous and sexy at the same time. Burt Reynolds, whose career was built on his relaxed, dry humor and engaging presence, is perfect here, as the harried news director still in love with Turner, his ace reporter and ex-wife. Christopher Reeve, who did relatively few comedic roles, is more of the straight man, but his self-satisfied business tycoon is a great foil to the other two. Henry Gibson, of all people, plays the milquetoasty murderer you can't bring yourself to condemn; and the rest of the cast, including a slimy Ned Beatty but otherwise mostly unknown, is hilarious and never miss a beat. The script is a jewel; the directing, editing and music are all fine; and though this has never come out on DVD, it's worth tracking down on VHS for the pure enjoyment of it.
