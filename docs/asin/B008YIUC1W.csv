1578729,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008YIUC1W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 16]","The period piece ""Bomb Girls"" basically presents itself as an upscale soap opera that revolves around a munitions plant in Canada. Making bombs for the front lines of WWII, the factory is staffed primarily by women. As most young men are overseas, the show is presented largely (if not entirely) from the female perspective. The drama assembles a handful of leading characters to highlight how women from all walks of life pulled together to be a vital part of the war effort. As you might expect, messages of patriotism, duty, sisterhood and empowerment abound in this well executed series. But make no mistake, this isn't particularly high brow stuff. It succeeds with soapy excess which includes illicit affairs, cunning rivalries, and plenty of personal scandal. While well-meaning, the program plots are laden with every possible cliche that you would expect from a romantic period drama. But in this case, I'm not sure that it matters. Due to the historical component, the show feels different from traditional television fare and is sold by a likable cast led by the invaluable (and never better) Meg Tilly. The show reminds me of one of my favorites from the early nineties, ""Homefront"" (set in the post-war era with the men coming home), which lamentably is still not available on DVD.Who are the four principle Bomb Girls? Tilly plays the steely floor matron, Lorna. Steadfast and sure, she maintains a complex relationship with a wounded husband (Peter Outerbridge) while trying to hold things together at work. Her major source of conflict comes in the person of Marco Moretti (Antonio Cupo), an Italian descendent working at her side whom she initially mistrusts. Jodi Balfour plays the upscale Gladys. Although destined for a perfect and privileged life with an ideal husband, she wants to be more useful. Her work at the factory will open her eyes in countless ways AND threaten the very security she has established in her home life. Ali Liebert is the tough and no-nonsense Betty. A spokeswomen and figurehead for the women's work movement, she is constricted by this idealization of her image. Living life in the closet, she develops an unrequited crush on a new co-worker. And Charlotte Hegele is newbie Kate. Kate is on the run from an abusive family life and is experiencing all that the world has to offer. For my taste, the Kate story threads were among the weakest and least believable.Although ""Bomb Girls"" premiered as a limited series with only six episodes, it was popular enough to be picked up for a second season before coming to its conclusion. As I've mentioned, the cast in ""Bomb Girls"" is one of its strongest assets. In Season One, Balfour takes center stage throughout and we learn about the new environment largely through her eyes. As such, she maintains a heavy burden that she pulls off well. Anastasia Phillips (Vera) also scores in one of the more dramatic story lines. I didn't initially like her character, but she faces a life altering crisis that provides her a great opportunity to shine. But, for me, Tilly steals the show as uptight Lorna. Winner of the Best Actress prize from the Canadian Screen Awards, Tilly has one of the most tightly balanced roles. Tough as nails, but yearning inside, she is a mass of contradictions as she tries to be everything to everybody. Equal parts frustrating and inspiring, it is the show's most complex role and most adept performance. Unlike some, I don't necessarily think that ""Bomb Girls"" is absolutely terrific. Some plot threads were underdeveloped, some over-the-top. But with great sets, costuming, production design and period detail (as well as good performances), it's an easy recommendation as something different.

It is important that women and young women watch this. It takes you on a journey-a real journey- of how women came together to run this country,work men's job while they were at war, and become independant. It shows us how we became independant from men. They made their own money, they worked, smoked, drank, dance, and stuck together. They held their heads high and were strong inside and out. I have heard they are not showing this in the states anymore or only online and this disapoint and upsets me very bad. I hate when Networks cancel great shows but, keep stupid, unimportant, and meaningless shows still on the air.

1578731,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B008YIUC1W,Lola's Mom,"[5, 7]","Lots of stuff going on in this TV show based on the life of women during WWII, more specifically bomb girls, women who worked in a bomb factory. Season one consists of 6 episodes.Glady's. Can't say I was overly fond of the star: a rich girl ""slumming"" it, in the beginning anyway. She thinks aiding the war effort consists of lifting her skirts for a total stranger of a solider in a dark alley. The first episode I wasn't impressed at all. She gradually begins to improve, but I sensed there may be trouble for her actions later down the road. By the end of the season, however, she was one of my favorite characters.The rest of the cast:Betty. She's the toughest bomb worker of them all and a lesbian in a world not ready for them. I felt her anger when she was misepresented in a movie.Kate. A former preacher's daughter on the run with an obsession with singing. A HUGE disappointment in the end. HUGE.Lorna. The ""crew chief"" who is married to a man crippled from the Great War and experiencing some frustrations because it. She loathes the Italian worker, Marco, with a passion, and for great reason. (I thought he was a dick, but my stepmum thinks he is hot. He's also one of those characters you like better in the end than the beginning. There are a few layers to him.)Vera: Is distracted by the flirtatious Marco and gets her scalp torn off her head. As morbid as this sounds, her story is so far my favorite. I can't wait to see how she overcomes this  handicap of hers.There's bad news received, deaths, fake letters, a thief, someone gets the clap, there's turning on one's friends, potential rapists... and lots of sexual harassment on the job. I love how the show shows how uncomfortable men's harassment can make women and the distraction leads to accidents. And of course, anytime something goes wrong, like a bad bomb, they blame the women.As I said, not overly fond of the rich girl at first, but the rest of the women really sucked me into their lives and I found the factory bits though frustrating to watch at times as the men anger me, fascinating. I found myself watching them make the bombs instead of paying attention to their conversations at times.I'm looking forward to more of this show.",4,I Want More,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2216,"['Lots', 'stuff', 'going', 'TV', 'show', 'based', 'life', 'women', 'WWII', 'more', 'specifically', 'bomb', 'girls', 'women', 'who', 'worked', 'bomb', 'factory', 'Season', 'one', '6', 'episodes.Glady', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'overly', 'fond', 'star', 'rich', 'girl', 'slumming', 'beginning', 'anyway', 'aiding', 'war', 'effort', 'lifting', 'skirts', 'total', 'stranger', 'solider', 'dark', 'alley', 'first', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'gradually', 'improve', 'sensed', 'may', 'be', 'trouble', 'actions', 'later', 'road', 'end', 'season', 'however', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Betty', 'toughest', 'bomb', 'worker', 'lesbian', 'world', 'not', 'ready', 'felt', 'anger', 'when', 'was', 'misepresented', 'movie.Kate', 'former', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'run', 'obsession', 'singing', 'HUGE', 'disappointment', 'end', 'HUGE.Lorna', 'crew', 'chief', 'who', 'married', 'man', 'crippled', 'Great', 'War', 'experiencing', 'frustrations', 'Italian', 'worker', 'Marco', 'passion', 'great', 'reason', 'thought', 'was', 'dick', 'stepmum', 'thinks', 'hot', 'also', 'one', 'characters', 'like', 'better', 'end', 'beginning', 'are', 'few', 'layers', 'Vera', 'Is', 'distracted', 'flirtatious', 'Marco', 'scalp', 'torn', 'head', 'As', 'morbid', 'story', 'so', 'far', 'favorite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'handicap', 'hers.There', 'bad', 'news', 'received', 'deaths', 'fake', 'letters', 'thief', 'someone', 'clap', 'turning', 'one', 'friends', 'potential', 'rapists', 'lots', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'job', 'love', 'how', 'show', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'men', 'harassment', 'can', 'make', 'women', 'distraction', 'accidents', 'course', 'anytime', 'something', 'wrong', 'bad', 'bomb', 'blame', 'women.As', 'said', 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'rich', 'girl', 'first', 'rest', 'women', 'really', 'sucked', 'lives', 'found', 'factory', 'bits', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'times', 'men', 'fascinating', 'found', 'watching', 'make', 'bombs', 'instead', 'paying', 'attention', 'conversations', 'times.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'show']","Bomb Girls // Same War,Different Battles Season 1"
