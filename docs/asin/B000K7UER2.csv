1031501,A3158L7KH1RVSB,B000K7UER2,"Charity Stone ""anime adult""","[0, 0]",This is a slice of life anime. No special powers or demons in this. Just a bunch of air fighter pilots trying to survive. The main character ( spoiler alert ) is tricked into signing a three year contract to fight in a war. This is how he keeps going no matter what to get back to the girl of his dreams. Excellent animation and a killer opening track. If you like Top Gun type shows this is the anime for you.,5,air fighting action,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,410,"['slice', 'life', 'anime', 'special', 'powers', 'demons', 'Just', 'bunch', 'air', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'trying', 'survive', 'main', 'character', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'tricked', 'signing', 'three', 'year', 'contract', 'fight', 'war', 'how', 'going', 'matter', 'what', 'get', 'back', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Excellent', 'animation', 'killer', 'opening', 'track', 'like', 'Top', 'Gun', 'type', 'anime']",N/A
1031502,AJCTGKPXYG8DY,B000K7UER2,James Seger,"[0, 0]","This series marks the second animated adaptation of Kouru Shintani's fighter pilot manga epic, Area 88.Shin Kazama, an orphan, was on track to fulfill his lifelong dream of being a commercial pilot. As the story starts, he is serving a three-year contract as a mercenary fighter pilot at Area 88, an air base in the middle of the desert. How he wound up there is revealed over the course of the series.Each dangerous mission brings him closer to the $1.5 million required to terminate the contract and buy his freedom, but also changes his soul. The series does a very good job of covering that ground. It excels at (you could say wallows in) the angst-y, emotional drama that made Area 88 a favorite of mine back when the manga was being released in the U.S. The over the top melodrama could be too much for some (check out the poems used as previews for the next episode), but I loved it.The animation is nicely done and I liked the story selection. The planes and air battles are all CG rendered and they look good, but I think they lose some of the character that the earlier, hand animated series had.The characters are mostly true to their presentations in the manga and earlier series. As a plus to viewers watching the series in English, ADV used the same voice actors in the earlier series as they did in this one. If you watch both, the characters maintain their voices.They've taken a minor character from the manga, Shinjo `Rocky' Makoto (a photographer) and used him as the focus of this series. I can see why they did, as it helps introduce viewers to the base and characters. But it also makes Shin sort of a supporting actor in his own story.I do wish they had translated the kingdom as Asran instead of Aslan (in Japan, the `L' and the `R' character are the same). I've seen the kingdom translated as Asran (in the manga), Aslan (in the English versions of the animation) and as Alsran/Arslan (on the Wikipedia entry and around the internet). I think of Aslan as the lion from the Narnia stories. In my mind, Asran sounds more like a Middle Eastern country. Also, when they show the contract in the series it clearly showed `Asuran'.Lastly, this series ending just isn't as powerful as the earlier series was. It has an ending that is satisfying enough. But it lacks punch. I wonder if they were leaving the door open for a second season?This version of Area 88 is a step down from thethree part seriesmade in the `80's. If you were only going to choose one, I would say go with that. But this series is still Area 88, so it's still worth watching.",4,"Area 88, co-starring Shin Kazama",1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2565,"['series', 'second', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Kouru', 'Shintani', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'manga', 'epic', 'Area', '88.Shin', 'Kazama', 'orphan', 'was', 'track', 'fulfill', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'being', 'commercial', 'pilot', 'story', 'serving', 'three-year', 'contract', 'mercenary', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'Area', '88', 'air', 'base', 'middle', 'desert', 'How', 'wound', 'up', 'revealed', 'course', 'series.Each', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'closer', '1.5', 'million', 'required', 'terminate', 'contract', 'buy', 'freedom', 'also', 'soul', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'ground', 'could', 'say', 'wallows', 'angst-y', 'emotional', 'drama', 'made', 'Area', '88', 'favorite', 'mine', 'back', 'when', 'manga', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'U.S', 'top', 'melodrama', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'check', 'out', 'poems', 'used', 'previews', 'next', 'episode', 'loved', 'it.The', 'animation', 'nicely', 'done', 'liked', 'story', 'selection', 'planes', 'air', 'battles', 'are', 'CG', 'rendered', 'look', 'good', 'think', 'lose', 'character', 'earlier', 'hand', 'animated', 'series', 'had.The', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'true', 'presentations', 'manga', 'earlier', 'series', 'plus', 'viewers', 'watching', 'series', 'English', 'ADV', 'used', 'same', 'voice', 'actors', 'earlier', 'series', 'did', 'one', 'watch', 'characters', 'maintain', 'voices.They', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'minor', 'character', 'manga', 'Shinjo', 'Rocky', 'Makoto', 'photographer', 'used', 'focus', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'introduce', 'viewers', 'base', 'characters', 'also', 'Shin', 'sort', 'supporting', 'actor', 'own', 'story.I', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'translated', 'kingdom', 'Asran', 'instead', 'Aslan', 'Japan', 'L', 'R', 'character', 'are', 'same', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kingdom', 'translated', 'Asran', 'manga', 'Aslan', 'English', 'versions', 'animation', 'Alsran/Arslan', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 'internet', 'think', 'Aslan', 'lion', 'Narnia', 'stories', 'mind', 'Asran', 'more', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'Also', 'when', 'show', 'contract', 'series', 'clearly', 'showed', ""Asuran'.Lastly"", 'series', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'powerful', 'earlier', 'series', 'was', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'punch', 'wonder', 'were', 'leaving', 'door', 'open', 'second', 'season', 'version', 'Area', '88', 'step', 'down', 'thethree', 'part', 'seriesmade', '80', 'were', 'only', 'going', 'choose', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'series', 'still', 'Area', '88', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

This is a really well made anime about a pilot flying for a mercenary unit in the kingdom of Aslan(Turkish for Lion).  You fly with the Pilot Shin Kazama as he tries to earn enough money to buy his way out of the mercenary air force that he was duped into sighning by a childhood rival. In case many of you don't know; they made a shooter game out of this; U.N. Sqaudron for Snes. I am a huge fan of air combat games! My current favorites are the Ace Comabt series on PS2.

The air combat was well done. The characters? A bit stiff. The storyline? Can't go wrong with the lost love plot, but it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.Area 88 isn't something I'm interested in watching again -- a bit boring all around, and not something that would entice me to watch again. I also wouldn't pay the $40 price for the set; the pricing should be more towards $30.The DVD's are an okay anime offering, with a classic storyline and modern military fighters.

1031505,A2A3PV7XG6ZGM5,B000K7UER2,Michael Harmon,"[3, 6]","First of all I never watched the previous OVA series so this review is not tainted in anyway. This series packs a big bang for your buck. The animation style is pretty darn good in my oppinion and the CG mixes well with it. The air battles are superb and the music really gets you going. I liked the characters for what they were as this was a short 12 episode series. And for a fun short series it really mixed the story up with some serious episodes to boot. The reason this doesnt receive a 5 star rating however is because the beginning really doesnt set up what the series is all about. As you watch the series though, the story does unfold but there is a lingering feeling after the first episode of what is the show really about. The other reason for 4 not 5 stars is the ending. I thought it could have been closed up better, although it still works, its more of an ""artsy"" independent film ending. Anyway this show was great and ADV as always brings a great dub. I just finished it for a second time and I know I will watch it again. Review OverOh yeah, other reviewers have said the original Area 88 from the 80s is better, I saw a trailer for it and Im not gonna go back and watch it with its dated animation when this 2005 edition is totally updated and longer in length. I find when people like an older edition over the new its because its what they watched when they were kids and it pulls them back to there childhood. If you havent watched either I would start with this one first.

1031506,AHF97M45JFCB,B000K7UER2,ONENEO,"[6, 6]","Area 88 for those who have yet to experience it in any of its many incarnations is a recent remake of a three-episode 1985 series of the same name, which was itself based on an earlier manga series.  Like many, you're probably wondering what about the premise warrants so much attention.  The answer, in its simplest form, is that it presents a clean, tightly focused tale about a pilot betrayed over a woman and the results of this life-changing twist of fate.Yes there's enough of a story here to keep the plot moving smoothly along but at its core, Area 88 is an action show that borrows some from some of the more memorable moments in big budget films such as Top Gun and Behind Enemy Lines.As a bit of a fighter aircraft buff myself, I was quite enthralled with the accurate aircraft specs/ renditions featured in the program but make no mistake, fighter plane knowledge isn't a requisite for enjoying the viewing experience.The story is technically told through the eyes of a photographer who arrives to the mercenary Middle Eastern air base on a bit of an ulterior motive mission again involving the betrayal mentioned above.  I'll refrain from diving too deeply into the plot as most of the fun in the series is following along as the story-layers are unraveled like a proverbial onion.If you've read along this far in the review, hopefully the reason for revisiting this franchise as often as has been done is becoming clearer.  The core of the show involves aerial combat scenes and a near constant dose of sheer dog fighting goodness.  While advances in animation technology/ computer generated imaging benefit the industry as a whole, there is certainly ample opportunity to show off just how far things have come in Area 88.Thanks to computer rendering, a great amount of detail has gone into the planes models, their weapons, and the explosions/ crash sequences.  The sounds are especially noteworthy as well, almost offsetting the slightly out of place techno score.ADV Films deserves credit for assembling a voice cast worthy of the Japanese source material.  The English dub is just about flawless in dynamics and believability.Complaints are very few.  In fact the most common seem to be the desire to continue onward with a plot that ends fairly abruptly.  Twelve 23-minute episodes are all we're given to begin, develop and conclude the tale.  The concept of a full 26-episode run really boggles the mind with what could have potentially been accomplished in terms of character development.  As it stands the story is short, sweet, and loaded with action.  Viewers who enjoy anime for its methodic building and emphasis on human emotions first and foremost may want to skip Area 88 but everyone else should do themselves a favor by giving the show a try.Area 88 is available in a Complete Collection (3-disc) set and sold separately across 4 volumes (each containing three episodes).  Be cautious when purchasing should you decide to go for the 2008 rendition of the show as the original OVA series from 1985 (from US Manga Corps) often occupies the same shelf space and looks similar in terms of the cover art.",4,Worthy Remake Of A Classic Anime OVA,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,3131,"['88', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'many', 'incarnations', 'recent', 'remake', 'three-episode', '1985', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'based', 'earlier', 'manga', 'series', 'many', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'what', 'premise', 'warrants', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'answer', 'simplest', 'form', 'clean', 'tightly', 'focused', 'tale', 'pilot', 'betrayed', 'woman', 'results', 'life-changing', 'twist', 'fate.Yes', 'enough', 'story', 'here', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'smoothly', 'along', 'core', 'Area', '88', 'action', 'show', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'such', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines.As', 'bit', 'fighter', 'aircraft', 'buff', 'was', 'quite', 'enthralled', 'accurate', 'aircraft', 'specs/', 'renditions', 'featured', 'program', 'make', 'mistake', 'fighter', 'plane', 'knowledge', ""n't"", 'requisite', 'enjoying', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'story', 'technically', 'told', 'eyes', 'photographer', 'who', 'mercenary', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'air', 'base', 'bit', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'mission', 'again', 'involving', 'betrayal', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'refrain', 'diving', 'too', 'deeply', 'plot', 'most', 'fun', 'series', 'following', 'along', 'story-layers', 'are', 'unraveled', 'proverbial', 'onion.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'far', 'review', 'hopefully', 'reason', 'revisiting', 'franchise', 'as', 'often', 'been', 'done', 'becoming', 'clearer', 'core', 'show', 'aerial', 'combat', 'scenes', 'near', 'constant', 'dose', 'sheer', 'dog', 'fighting', 'goodness', 'advances', 'animation', 'technology/', 'computer', 'generated', 'imaging', 'benefit', 'industry', 'whole', 'certainly', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'Area', '88.Thanks', 'computer', 'rendering', 'great', 'amount', 'detail', 'gone', 'planes', 'models', 'weapons', 'explosions/', 'crash', 'sequences', 'sounds', 'are', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'offsetting', 'slightly', 'place', 'techno', 'score.ADV', 'Films', 'credit', 'assembling', 'voice', 'cast', 'worthy', 'Japanese', 'source', 'material', 'English', 'dub', 'just', 'about', 'flawless', 'dynamics', 'believability.Complaints', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'fact', 'most', 'common', 'seem', 'be', 'desire', 'continue', 'onward', 'plot', 'fairly', 'abruptly', 'Twelve', '23-minute', 'episodes', 'are', ""'re"", 'given', 'begin', 'develop', 'conclude', 'tale', 'concept', 'full', '26-episode', 'run', 'really', 'mind', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'been', 'accomplished', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'short', 'sweet', 'loaded', 'action', 'Viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'methodic', 'building', 'emphasis', 'human', 'emotions', 'first', 'foremost', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'Area', '88', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'do', 'favor', 'giving', 'show', 'try.Area', '88', 'available', 'Complete', 'Collection', '3-disc', 'set', 'sold', 'separately', '4', 'volumes', 'containing', 'three', 'episodes', 'Be', 'cautious', 'when', 'purchasing', 'should', 'decide', 'go', '2008', 'rendition', 'show', 'original', 'OVA', 'series', '1985', 'US', 'Manga', 'Corps', 'often', 'same', 'shelf', 'space', 'similar', 'terms', 'cover', 'art']",N/A
