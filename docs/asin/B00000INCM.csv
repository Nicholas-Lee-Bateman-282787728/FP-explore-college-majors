504061,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B00000INCM,Cowboy Buddha,"[12, 12]","A very enjoyable minor movie musical. I do not intend to do a full review  - instead I would like to make a few comments.First, contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, the clever lyricist who wrote ""I'll take Manhattan/The Bronx and Staten...Island"" was not Sammy Cahn but Lorenz Hart (in the early days of his collaboration with Richard Rodgers).""Two Tickets To Broadway"" is interesting as it contains a rare screen performance by the vaudeville comedy duo Smith & Dale. While they are reasonably humorous, their interest to modern viewers would be that they were the act that Neil Simon based his Sunshine Boys on - a comedy team who worked well together but actually hated each other offstage.Finally, I'm not sure I go along with the description of Tony Martin as ""bland"". In real life, he married Cyd Charisse and stayed married to her for many years.

504063,A23XVF23C7BHP0,B00000INCM,"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[12, 13]","With a story by Sammy Cahn, this is a typical story of a small town girl going to Broadway to make it big. Initially she gets ripped off by a lovable rogue agent, played with great comedy by Eddie Bracken. Janet Leigh's character teams up with aspiring singer Dan and the crux of the movie is whether they will get their big break and whether (of course) they will fall in love!Unlike many of its contemporaries, this musical features none of the huge stars of the day such as Howard Keel or Doris Day, but what must have been considered a second rank of musical performers. To give you an idea, the guest star is not Bing but Bob Crosby! That said, Janet Leigh (who would later become a much bigger name) acquits herself well in the singing and dancing, and as we know, she's a fine actress. Tony Martin is so-so as the leading man, but has a fine baritone and can dance reasonably well.The stand out song is I'll Take Manhattan with that classic Cahn rhyming of Manhattan with 'the Bronx & Staten...island'.The colourful costumes the girls wear in the Busby Berkeley choreographed dance make this a first rate number.",4,Good show - excellent song and dance numbers,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,1119,"['story', 'Sammy', 'Cahn', 'typical', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'going', 'Broadway', 'make', 'big', 'Initially', 'ripped', 'off', 'lovable', 'rogue', 'agent', 'played', 'great', 'comedy', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'character', 'teams', 'up', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Dan', 'crux', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'big', 'break', 'course', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'musical', 'none', 'huge', 'stars', 'day', 'such', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Doris', 'Day', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'second', 'rank', 'musical', 'performers', 'give', 'idea', 'guest', 'star', 'not', 'Bing', 'Bob', 'Crosby', 'said', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'much', 'bigger', 'name', 'well', 'singing', 'dancing', 'know', 'fine', 'actress', 'Tony', 'Martin', 'so-so', 'leading', 'man', 'fine', 'baritone', 'can', 'dance', 'reasonably', 'well.The', 'stand', 'song', ""'ll"", 'Take', 'Manhattan', 'classic', 'Cahn', 'rhyming', 'Manhattan', ""'the"", 'Bronx', 'Staten', ""island'.The"", 'colourful', 'girls', 'wear', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'make', 'first', 'rate', 'number']",Two Tickets to Broadway VHS

504065,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00000INCM,steve_manassas,"[0, 0]","This 1951 musical, a tribute to the early days of TV, was co-produced by Howard Hughes for RKO Pictures.  It features many selections from The Great American Songbook, by various composers (Rodgers and Hart, Jule Styne, and Sammy Cahn, among others).  Tony Martin, better known to some as Mr. Cyd Charisse, is the leading man and has an excellent voice; his hit ""There's No Tomorrow,"" which is featured in the movie, is based on the Neapolitan song ""O Sole Mio,"" and inspired Elvis Presley to record his own version, in 1960, called ""It's Now Or Never.""  Janet Leigh, the leading lady, is a surprisingly good singer and dancer; Jamie Lee and Kelly Curtis' mom was a very versatile actress, and more than just the shower murder victim inPsycho (Collector's Edition).The other major players in the movie are bandleader Bob Crosby, who does an hilarious number where he pokes fun at brother Bing; Gloria DeHaven, Barbara Lawrence, vaudeville comics Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who play bickering deli owners; comedian Eddie Bracken, and, of course, Ann Miller, who does one of her terrific tap routines to ""The Worry Bird.""  Busby Berkeley, genius that he is, choreographed that number, and all of the dances in the movie.Although Annie was loaned out from MGM, this movie marked her return to RKO, the studio where she began her movie career, in 1937, at age 14 (though she lied about her age, and pretended that she was 16).Overall, while not perfect, this is a very entertaining Technicolor movie musical.",4,A very good movie musical about the early days of TV,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1505,"['1951', 'musical', 'tribute', 'early', 'days', 'TV', 'was', 'co-produced', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'RKO', 'Pictures', 'many', 'selections', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'various', 'composers', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'Jule', 'Styne', 'Sammy', 'Cahn', 'others', 'Tony', 'Martin', 'better', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'leading', 'man', 'excellent', 'voice', 'hit', 'Tomorrow', 'featured', 'movie', 'based', 'Neapolitan', 'song', 'O', 'Sole', 'Mio', 'inspired', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'record', 'own', 'version', '1960', 'called', 'Now', 'Or', 'Never', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'leading', 'lady', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'singer', 'dancer', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Kelly', 'Curtis', 'mom', 'was', 'very', 'versatile', 'actress', 'more', 'just', 'shower', 'murder', 'victim', 'inPsycho', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'other', 'major', 'players', 'movie', 'are', 'bandleader', 'Bob', 'Crosby', 'who', 'hilarious', 'number', 'where', 'fun', 'brother', 'Bing', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'vaudeville', 'comics', 'Joe', 'Smith', 'Charles', 'Dale', 'who', 'play', 'bickering', 'deli', 'owners', 'comedian', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'course', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'who', 'one', 'terrific', 'tap', 'routines', 'Worry', 'Bird', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'genius', 'choreographed', 'number', 'dances', 'movie.Although', 'Annie', 'was', 'loaned', 'out', 'MGM', 'movie', 'marked', 'return', 'RKO', 'studio', 'where', 'began', 'movie', 'career', '1937', 'age', '14', 'lied', 'age', 'pretended', 'was', '16', '.Overall', 'not', 'perfect', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Technicolor', 'movie', 'musical']",Two Tickets to Broadway VHS
