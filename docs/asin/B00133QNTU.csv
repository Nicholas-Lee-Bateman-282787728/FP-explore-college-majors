Alice Faye is the girl next door with a lovely contralto voice and an overbearing soon-to-be mother-in-law.When young Ching-Ching meets Uncle Tommy, he is impressed by her youthful innocence and aged wisdom (the result of living in a remote Chinese village for most of her life).  She accidentally stows away on his luxury liner and bumps into Susan.  After a few comical misunderstandings, a lovely song and moonlight kiss, Ching-Ching delivers an amusing rendition of imitations (including Al Jolson) and helps to further snarl things up for her two new friends.  Her final act as a curly-topped cupid is to allow the divorce court judge to tell her what to say so that Tommy and Susan will have to admit that they want a happy ending as much as we do.Arthur Treacher delivers a typically delightful performance as the slightly bewildered but striving to please butler.P.S.

The list of movies in the Editorial Review section looked like an exhaustive list, so I did not actually count the titles to be sure there were 18 listed.  Since Stowaway was not listed in the review, I ordered it as a separate DVD.  When the Little Darling Collection and Stowaway arrived together in the mail, I was disappointed to realize that Stowaway was already in the collection.  The Editorial Review had listed only 14 titles, and omitted four:  Stowaway, Susannah of the Mounties, Wee Willie Winkie, and Young People.  So, be advised that the Editorial Review is not an exhaustive list -- and don't double-order as I did.  * But, Stowaway is a wonderful story and still relevant today.  There are still people, like Robert Young's character, who lead meaningless, self-centered lives, simply partying.  When American Playboy Tommy Randall met the adorable orphaned child Ching-Ching, he was concerned about her well-being.

Her real name is Barbara Stewart, but she's called Ching-Ching by the natives. She lives with the older missionary couple, Mr. and Mrs. Crookshank, who took her in when her parents died. When bandits are approaching the town and most of the people are running away, Mr. Crookshank refuses to go. He considers it his duty to try to preach to the bandits. Afraid for her life, the Chinese neighbor spirits her away to Shanghai in a boat, complete with her little dog and a small bag of coins. The coins are stolen from her by the boatman so he can gamble, and she takes her dog and goes looking for food.Of course she runs into a wealthy American playboy, played by Robert Young. He kept her with him as an interpreter (she speaks both English and Chinese, of course), and has her wait in his car while he goes into a bar to see his friends. When it starts to rain, she crawls into the rumble seat and closes the lid. Tommy the playboy assumes she has run away from him, and has his car loaded onto the cruise ship he was scheduled to take. Indeed, it might be inferred that he owned the ship, the way the captain treats him.OK, that's the set-up. I guess you could say Ching-Ching was Shanghaied, but due to her own action.

As a departure from the other releases in this series, there is NO colorized version to choose from.

When the two adults meet in divorce court, it's up to Ching-Ching to keep them together. Quite a few memorable songs (Faye & Temple on ""Goodnight My Love"" & Temple imitating Ginger Rogers & Al Jolson in ""You've Gotta' S.M.I.L.E.""). Faye really shines in this movie, which would be the last time Temple & Faye were paired together, as Faye was already a star in her own right by this time. Features the original black and white film in its original theatrical aspect ratio with English Stereo and English and Spanish Mono and includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 85 minutes.Warning for parents: surprisingly, there are some adult situations in this movie, such as divorce, Alice Faye's character being engaged yet flirting with Young, and Robert Young's philandering playboy character (who asks for his checkbook to ""buy off"" yet another girl who produces a child!).

1140272,A37S3ACL57LN62,B00133QNTU,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[1, 1]","A little girl orphaned by her missionary parents, Barbara (Shirley Temple), or ""Ching Ching"" as she likes to be called, is a bright-eyed youngster in a scary world. In spite of her guardian's wishes, she is smuggled aboard a boat to avoid certain death. She is robbed, but she soon finds her way to a wealthy American playboy who she dons Uncle Tommy (Robert Young). Tommy takes care of her for a while, but she gets lost and ends up a stowaway aboard a ship carrying both Uncle Tommy and the beautiful Susan Parker (Alice Faye). Susan is engaged, but Ching Ching does her best to get them together.For the most part, this is a sweet, run-of-the-mill light romance. The love story isn't especially exciting or unique, but it serves its purpose to move the story along. Shirley Temple is certainly the main attraction and she gets many moments to shine. Unfortunately, there are a few moments where her interactions with the adults are too sweet and overly done. For example, when little Ching Ching jokes with Tommy in his car outside of the bar, she says something lame and they laugh loudly together, and the scene feels very forced. These bits make the movie feel like a kid's movie, but thankfully there are very few moments like this.",4,"Enjoyable, Light Fare",1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1239,"['little', 'girl', 'orphaned', 'missionary', 'parents', 'Barbara', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Ching', 'Ching', 'be', 'called', 'bright-eyed', 'youngster', 'scary', 'world', 'spite', 'guardian', 'wishes', 'smuggled', 'boat', 'avoid', 'certain', 'death', 'robbed', 'soon', 'way', 'wealthy', 'American', 'playboy', 'who', 'Uncle', 'Tommy', 'Robert', 'Young', 'Tommy', 'care', 'while', 'lost', 'up', 'stowaway', 'ship', 'carrying', 'Uncle', 'Tommy', 'beautiful', 'Susan', 'Parker', 'Alice', 'Faye', 'Susan', 'engaged', 'Ching', 'Ching', 'best', 'get', 'together.For', 'most', 'part', 'sweet', 'run-of-the-mill', 'light', 'romance', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'especially', 'exciting', 'unique', 'purpose', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'certainly', 'main', 'attraction', 'many', 'moments', 'shine', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'interactions', 'adults', 'are', 'too', 'sweet', 'overly', 'done', 'example', 'when', 'little', 'Ching', 'Ching', 'jokes', 'Tommy', 'car', 'bar', 'something', 'lame', 'laugh', 'loudly', 'together', 'scene', 'feels', 'very', 'forced', 'bits', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'kid', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'moments']",N/A
