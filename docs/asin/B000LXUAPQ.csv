1041906,AB4F6UHL20U95,B000LXUAPQ,Anne Rice,"[14, 19]","Brilliant and innovative directing.  Superb cinematography.  Magnificent acting and script.  Unique portrait of Saint Francis, capturing his mysticism and his inevitable aloneness among those who cannot understand mystics but only admire them and be inspired by them.  Production values were very simply fabulous.  The scenes between Francis and the Pope are masterly and unforgettable.  Highly recommended.  You come away wanting to know more about this giant of a saint so revered by Catholics and Protestants alike.  A true portrait of a man on fire with the love of God, and the love of God's creation.  The film manages to capture the sheer rapture of Francis as he is transformed by his ever deepening understanding of his vocation.  ---  The portrayal of Clare is sensitive and beautiful, but may not be entirely historically accurate.  But this really doesn't matter.  The film offers an experience of Francis that is priceless.",5,Superb Portrait of An Incomparable Saint,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,936,"['Brilliant', 'innovative', 'directing', 'Superb', 'cinematography', 'Magnificent', 'acting', 'script', 'Unique', 'portrait', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'capturing', 'mysticism', 'inevitable', 'aloneness', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'mystics', 'only', 'admire', 'be', 'inspired', 'Production', 'values', 'were', 'very', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'scenes', 'Francis', 'Pope', 'are', 'masterly', 'unforgettable', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'come', 'away', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'giant', 'saint', 'so', 'revered', 'Catholics', 'Protestants', 'alike', 'true', 'portrait', 'man', 'fire', 'love', 'God', 'love', 'God', 'creation', 'film', 'capture', 'sheer', 'rapture', 'Francis', 'transformed', 'ever', 'deepening', 'understanding', 'vocation', 'portrayal', 'Clare', 'sensitive', 'beautiful', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'experience', 'Francis', 'priceless']",Saint Francis
1041907,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B000LXUAPQ,K. Ostrowski,"[12, 13]","Having already seen Claire and Francis, and been disappointed with its tendency to avoid and ignore the miracles of Francis (though it pleased me in most other respects,) I decided to try out this film, and was honestly shocked when it made virtually all of the same mistakes, and more besides.One scene with birds is shown, but aside from that, there are no miraculous occurrances in this film, or at least, nothing that a skeptic wouldn't be able to logic away.  That was the first problem that struck me, although it was more because I'd noticed it in Clare and Francis than for any other reason.  In retrospect, the film had a lot of other issues as well.Aside from the painful lack of any on-screen visions or healings, and only a brief view of the stigmata, the film has a tendency to overword everything.  Statements that should be quick and easy are instead drawn out and bizarre, giving enormous opportunities for the actors to ham it up.  Worse yet, what they have to say hardly ever focuses on God, or on the way of God directly, and comes across more as pseudo-religious and psychological garbage than any kind of real people's problems.Francis himself is frequently depicted as being utterly insane, and even when he starts to get respect from Rome, this doesn't really diminish.  The actor who plays him makes every effort to make the man seem unnaturally euphoric and obsessive, as if he were continually either high or angsting throughout his entire ministry.Seemingly trying to compensate for this, the film takes great pains to depict great pains.  It's on pain, first and foremost, that this film fixates, and the cinematography goes to a lot of trouble to focus on that element; with rampant grays and browns; refusing to dip into a single shade of blue or green once the main part of the film is underway.  One gets the impression that the director was agonizing, and wanted the viewers to, but although the art direction agonizes, and the characters sometimes do, we are hardly ever shown what they're agonizing over; what was so terrible that they suffered that much?I loved the Passion of the Christ, because I understand pain, and the pain of Jesus was perfectly believably portrayed, and quite understandable.  This film didn't manage that.  One is left with the impression that its characters are merely angsting for insignificant reasons, compared to what they've put up with already.I think that the mood of this film was making some attempt to make the character seem tortured, like Padre Pio did, without actually giving the character an antagonist to torture him, but regardless, it came across as feeling very phony.Due, in part, to the cinematography, and in part to the lack of miracles, and of course, in part to the lack of charisma that the character was given in the script, I'm afraid that Francis didn't really stand out from the other characters at all.  I didn't find anything human, religious or inspiring about this film at all.  If you want to see this movie, don't.  Watch Clare and Francis instead.  It's not perfect, but it does everything that this movie does, except that it gets it right.  If I can find a better film about Saint Francis than Clare and Francis, I'll be sure to tell everyone I know, but this ain't it.",2,Which one of these guys was supposed to be Francis again?,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3270,"['Having', 'already', 'seen', 'Claire', 'Francis', 'been', 'disappointed', 'tendency', 'avoid', 'ignore', 'miracles', 'Francis', 'pleased', 'most', 'other', 'respects', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'honestly', 'shocked', 'when', 'made', 'virtually', 'same', 'mistakes', 'more', 'besides.One', 'scene', 'birds', 'shown', 'aside', 'are', 'miraculous', 'occurrances', 'film', 'least', 'nothing', 'skeptic', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'logic', 'away', 'was', 'first', 'problem', 'struck', 'was', 'more', ""'d"", 'noticed', 'Clare', 'Francis', 'other', 'reason', 'retrospect', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'other', 'issues', 'well.Aside', 'painful', 'lack', 'on-screen', 'visions', 'healings', 'only', 'brief', 'view', 'stigmata', 'film', 'tendency', 'overword', 'everything', 'Statements', 'should', 'be', 'quick', 'easy', 'are', 'instead', 'drawn', 'out', 'bizarre', 'giving', 'enormous', 'opportunities', 'actors', 'ham', 'up', 'Worse', 'yet', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'hardly', 'ever', 'God', 'way', 'God', 'directly', 'across', 'more', 'pseudo-religious', 'psychological', 'garbage', 'kind', 'real', 'people', 'problems.Francis', 'frequently', 'depicted', 'being', 'utterly', 'insane', 'even', 'when', 'get', 'respect', 'Rome', ""n't"", 'really', 'diminish', 'actor', 'who', 'effort', 'make', 'man', 'seem', 'unnaturally', 'euphoric', 'obsessive', 'were', 'continually', 'either', 'high', 'angsting', 'entire', 'ministry.Seemingly', 'trying', 'compensate', 'film', 'great', 'pains', 'depict', 'great', 'pains', 'pain', 'first', 'foremost', 'film', 'cinematography', 'lot', 'trouble', 'focus', 'element', 'rampant', 'grays', 'browns', 'refusing', 'dip', 'single', 'shade', 'blue', 'green', 'once', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'underway', 'One', 'impression', 'director', 'was', 'agonizing', 'wanted', 'viewers', 'art', 'direction', 'agonizes', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'do', 'are', 'hardly', 'ever', 'shown', 'what', ""'re"", 'agonizing', 'over', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'suffered', 'much', 'loved', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'understand', 'pain', 'pain', 'Jesus', 'was', 'perfectly', 'believably', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'understandable', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'One', 'left', 'impression', 'characters', 'are', 'merely', 'angsting', 'insignificant', 'reasons', 'compared', 'what', ""'ve"", 'put', 'up', 'already.I', 'think', 'mood', 'film', 'was', 'making', 'attempt', 'make', 'character', 'seem', 'tortured', 'Padre', 'Pio', 'did', 'actually', 'giving', 'character', 'antagonist', 'torture', 'regardless', 'came', 'feeling', 'very', 'phony.Due', 'part', 'cinematography', 'part', 'lack', 'miracles', 'course', 'part', 'lack', 'charisma', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'script', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Francis', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'human', 'religious', 'inspiring', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'Watch', 'Clare', 'Francis', 'instead', 'not', 'perfect', 'everything', 'movie', 'right', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'film', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'Clare', 'Francis', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'tell', 'everyone', 'know', 'ai', ""n't""]",Saint Francis

In the process, I have learned much about saints with which I was completely unfamiliar (St. Rita, St. Anthony of Padua) and been inspired anew by saints I already loved (Padre Piu). Unfortunately, this one was more disappointing than inspirational, as it seemed to take many liberties with the story of St. Francis (at least, as I have understood it), and while I know St. Francis did at many times strike his contemporaries as merely insane, that should not be the impression one gains from a spiritual biography! Too often here, Raoul Bova as Francis seemed merely over-the-top mad, possessed by an imbalance in his brain chemicals rather then inspired by God. There is a great deal of panting, thrashing in agony, and groaning - and considerably less of the contageous joy that must have been present for his message to spread as it did. There are occasional beautiful moments, so it's worth a look, but I feel I'm still waiting for a great St. Francis film (though compared to this, ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" looks pretty good and also has that wonderful confrontation with the Pope!).",2,Not the Best from Ignatius Press,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1299,"['was', 'thrilled', 'discovered', 'many', 'high-quality', 'inspirational', 'films', 'saints', 'lives', 'made', 'Italy', 'published', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'as', 'quickly', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'process', 'have', 'learned', 'much', 'saints', 'was', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'St.', 'Rita', 'St.', 'Anthony', 'Padua', 'been', 'inspired', 'anew', 'saints', 'already', 'loved', 'Padre', 'Piu', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'disappointing', 'inspirational', 'seemed', 'take', 'many', 'liberties', 'story', 'St.', 'Francis', 'least', 'have', 'understood', 'know', 'St.', 'Francis', 'did', 'many', 'times', 'strike', 'contemporaries', 'merely', 'insane', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'impression', 'one', 'gains', 'spiritual', 'biography', 'Too', 'often', 'here', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'Francis', 'seemed', 'merely', 'over-the-top', 'mad', 'possessed', 'imbalance', 'brain', 'chemicals', 'rather', 'then', 'inspired', 'God', 'great', 'deal', 'panting', 'thrashing', 'agony', 'groaning', 'considerably', 'less', 'contageous', 'joy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'message', 'spread', 'did', 'are', 'occasional', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'look', 'feel', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'great', 'St.', 'Francis', 'film', 'compared', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'wonderful', 'confrontation', 'Pope']",Saint Francis
1041909,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B000LXUAPQ,Thomas Zabiega,"[33, 40]","Ignatius Press has released onto the American market several brilliant Italian films about Catholic saints (St. Anthony of Padua, St. Rita, etc.), but this is not one of them.  Although Raoul Bova is a wonderful actor (please see him in ""Karol: The Man who Became Pope""), he is not that great in this movie.  The movie is way too artsy and drags on forever.  It is an inaccurate portrayal of Saint Francis and shows him as some sort of leftist revolutionary turned religious.  It has a false premise of Saint Francis becoming religious after spending time in jail where people are tortured to death for reading the Bible.  Therefore the film promotes Protestant propaganda that the Catholic Church withheld the Bible from the common people (in fact the Bible was read at every Mass and most people could not read--so they obtained their knowledge of the Bible from hearing these readings at Mass.  The Bible was also translated into every major European language and approved by the Pope centuries before the Reformation).  It also shows the false idea that poor people were not allowed to enter the church for Mass--which is a complete falsehood.  Saint Ignatius Press should not be promoting this film, as it is not orthodox Catholic and promotes false stories about this humble Catholic saint.  Not to mention that it is completely boring.",2,Not a great movie,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1342,"['Ignatius', 'Press', 'released', 'American', 'market', 'several', 'brilliant', 'Italian', 'films', 'Catholic', 'saints', 'St.', 'Anthony', 'Padua', 'St.', 'Rita', 'etc', 'not', 'one', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'please', 'see', 'Karol', 'Man', 'who', 'Became', 'Pope', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'artsy', 'drags', 'forever', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'sort', 'leftist', 'revolutionary', 'turned', 'religious', 'false', 'premise', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'becoming', 'religious', 'spending', 'time', 'jail', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'tortured', 'death', 'reading', 'Bible', 'film', 'Protestant', 'propaganda', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'withheld', 'Bible', 'common', 'people', 'fact', 'Bible', 'was', 'read', 'Mass', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'read', 'obtained', 'knowledge', 'Bible', 'hearing', 'readings', 'Mass', 'Bible', 'was', 'also', 'translated', 'major', 'European', 'language', 'approved', 'Pope', 'centuries', 'Reformation', 'also', 'false', 'idea', 'poor', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'enter', 'church', 'Mass', 'complete', 'falsehood', 'Saint', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'promoting', 'film', 'not', 'orthodox', 'Catholic', 'false', 'stories', 'humble', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'Not', 'mention', 'completely', 'boring']",Saint Francis
1041910,A3TYF16HATHDHK,B000LXUAPQ,Timothy,"[0, 1]","We have had this film for over a year now. If we would have read the other reviews listed we may not have gotten it. Thatwould have been a mistake. This is a very good rendition of the Saint: Giovanni Francesco di Bernardone. With other filmson this beloved Saint such as: Brother Sun, Sister Moon, Claire and Francis, and such; this film does depict his loss ofvision, the wounds of Christ he bore on his body, and the illness which ended his life. There are so many things that couldbe added which happened to him, that it could get really long and overdone. This one has the right amount of happenings.They could have made the wolf scene, which occurred at Gubbio, more like what actually took place. At least the wolf isincluded in this filmed version. Any time you are going to try and create a production true-to-life, there are going to beoffsets. You cannot get everything onto the screen, but you can do what you can do. This is one of our favourites on the lifeof Saint Francis. Though we did not order this online, for we did not have internet at that time in 2009, we thought wewould say something about it. If you like Saint Francis really well, whether you know little, much or nothing about him, tryout this film. It is more accurate than some.

1041911,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000LXUAPQ,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This three-hour Italian miniseries on St. Francis of Assisi, broken into two parts on one DVD with credits in between, is the best film I've ever seen on perhaps the most popular Catholic saint in history. Played by Raoul Bova as a live wire whose inner freedom makes him appear crazy to others, the Franciscan founder emerges here in all of his holiness and personal charisma. Forget Mickey Rourke's 1989 turn as Francis, the Italian &#34;Clare and Francis&#34; film, the Rossellini &#34;Flowers of St. Francis,&#34; the hippy-dippy &#34;Brother Sun Sister Moon&#34; of Zeffirelli, and the stolid 1961 &#34;St. Francis&#34; with Dolores Hart as Clare. This 2003 film with English subtitles is the one to get.I'm surprised at many of the negative reviews on Amazon, but many of them criticize this movie for being deficient in the miracles and other particular details of Francis's life, rather than for any artistic limitations. It's a big, handsome, well-financed movie that looks good and is acted exceptionally well. What makes this film great, though, is its persuasively sincere portrayal of the staple moments in the life of Francis that are always included in movies on his life. The 15-minute sequence of Francis giving away his father's things to the poor, and of his being hauled before the bishop by his enraged father Pietro in the town square, is the most brilliant of all the versions of this famous story. The dialogue and wild behavior of a young man who has found God in the poor are believably portrayed here, not hokey as in other film versions.The film is insightful in showing how St. Francis's idealistic movement grew quickly among wealthy young Italians as a way of embracing God's love in rebellion against the worldliness of their parents, while also showing the limits of this idealism as Francis gives his followers an almost impossible standard of poverty to follow. Standout sequences here include Clare's running away from home to join Francis, who tonsures her (haircut indicating religious consecration) on a rock in the woods as her father closes in on her trail. After his startling conversion experience in a wartime Italian prison, Bova plays Francis in these scenes as a force of nature whom wealthy young people in medieval Italy would believably follow into voluntary poverty -- including his friend Bernardo, whose clumsy attempt to imitate Francis in giving away his own wealth is both funny and sincere.As a nod to the legends of this saint, the wolf of Gubbio even makes an appearance, walking up to Francis in his church in a powerfully mystical scene. The later scenes of Francis before the pope and the death of Francis are beautifully done, milking more drama out of the material than similar scenes in films like &#34;Clare and Francis.&#34; The French actress who plays Clare is particularly good, giving a compassionate world-weary tone to the young saint rather than the smiling schoolgirl depicted in other films. It's not overtly a feminist interpretation, but one gets the sense that this Clare recognizes in Francis a kindred spirit of genius, as she likewise makes an informed decision to reject the money-grubbing materialism that surround her in 12th century Italy.&#34;Saint Francis&#34; is definitely the best film I've ever seen on St. Francis of Assisi, the Franciscan saint who inspired the name of Pope Francis, the Jesuit pontiff. Its theme of compassion for the poor and suffering has a contemporary feel that puts this film strongly in the spiritual camp of our current pope. Ignore the poor reviews from nitpicking Catholics who fault the film for not covering every base: This film nails the spirit of Francis, if not all the literal details of his life, and I highly recommend it as a very moving video that is exceptionally high in its spiritual and technical quality..",5,Beautiful film on St. Francis of Assisi tops all others,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,3842,"['three-hour', 'Italian', 'miniseries', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'broken', 'two', 'parts', 'one', 'DVD', 'credits', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'most', 'popular', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'history', 'Played', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'live', 'wire', 'inner', 'freedom', 'appear', 'crazy', 'others', 'Franciscan', 'founder', 'here', 'holiness', 'personal', 'charisma', 'Forget', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', '1989', 'turn', 'Francis', 'Italian', '34', 'Clare', 'Francis', '34', 'film', 'Rossellini', '34', 'Flowers', 'St.', 'Francis', '34', 'hippy-dippy', '34', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', '34', 'Zeffirelli', 'stolid', '1961', '34', 'St.', 'Francis', '34', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'Clare', '2003', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'get.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'many', 'criticize', 'movie', 'being', 'deficient', 'miracles', 'other', 'particular', 'details', 'Francis', 'life', 'rather', 'artistic', 'limitations', 'big', 'handsome', 'well-financed', 'movie', 'good', 'acted', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'What', 'film', 'great', 'though', 'persuasively', 'sincere', 'portrayal', 'staple', 'moments', 'life', 'Francis', 'are', 'always', 'included', 'movies', 'life', '15-minute', 'sequence', 'Francis', 'giving', 'away', 'father', 'things', 'poor', 'being', 'hauled', 'bishop', 'enraged', 'father', 'Pietro', 'town', 'square', 'most', 'brilliant', 'versions', 'famous', 'story', 'dialogue', 'wild', 'behavior', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'God', 'poor', 'are', 'believably', 'portrayed', 'here', 'not', 'hokey', 'other', 'film', 'versions.The', 'film', 'insightful', 'showing', 'how', 'St.', 'Francis', 'idealistic', 'movement', 'grew', 'quickly', 'wealthy', 'young', 'Italians', 'way', 'embracing', 'God', 'love', 'rebellion', 'worldliness', 'parents', 'also', 'showing', 'limits', 'idealism', 'Francis', 'followers', 'almost', 'impossible', 'standard', 'poverty', 'follow', 'Standout', 'sequences', 'here', 'include', 'Clare', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'join', 'Francis', 'who', 'haircut', 'indicating', 'religious', 'consecration', 'rock', 'woods', 'father', 'closes', 'trail', 'startling', 'conversion', 'experience', 'wartime', 'Italian', 'prison', 'Bova', 'Francis', 'scenes', 'force', 'nature', 'whom', 'wealthy', 'young', 'people', 'medieval', 'Italy', 'would', 'believably', 'follow', 'voluntary', 'poverty', 'including', 'friend', 'Bernardo', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'imitate', 'Francis', 'giving', 'away', 'own', 'wealth', 'funny', 'sincere.As', 'nod', 'legends', 'saint', 'wolf', 'Gubbio', 'even', 'appearance', 'walking', 'up', 'Francis', 'church', 'powerfully', 'mystical', 'scene', 'later', 'scenes', 'Francis', 'pope', 'death', 'Francis', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'milking', 'more', 'drama', 'material', 'similar', 'scenes', 'films', '34', 'Clare', 'Francis.', '34', 'French', 'actress', 'who', 'Clare', 'particularly', 'good', 'giving', 'compassionate', 'world-weary', 'tone', 'young', 'saint', 'rather', 'smiling', 'schoolgirl', 'depicted', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'overtly', 'feminist', 'interpretation', 'one', 'sense', 'Clare', 'Francis', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'genius', 'likewise', 'informed', 'decision', 'reject', 'money-grubbing', 'materialism', 'surround', '12th', 'century', 'Italy.', '34', 'Saint', 'Francis', '34', 'definitely', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'Franciscan', 'saint', 'who', 'inspired', 'name', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'Jesuit', 'pontiff', 'theme', 'compassion', 'poor', 'suffering', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'film', 'strongly', 'spiritual', 'camp', 'current', 'pope', 'poor', 'reviews', 'nitpicking', 'Catholics', 'who', 'fault', 'film', 'not', 'covering', 'base', 'film', 'spirit', 'Francis', 'not', 'literal', 'details', 'life', 'highly', 'recommend', 'very', 'moving', 'video', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'spiritual', 'technical', 'quality..']",Saint Francis
