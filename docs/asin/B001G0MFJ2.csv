Why did they raise all these issues that went unresolved?  What was with the lady who owed Julius $25, did she pay him back?  What was with the weird guy at the diner bar (I thought he was going to kill Julius)?  Why were they singing that song in the diner?  [Note: apparently this was a Sopranos reference, but it was still weird and unsettling]  Can't we even get one Apollo comedy show so we can see how Chris the kid turned into Chris Rock?Oh, one other thing about this season is that the racist lady teacher with a case of jungle fever was back (as the principal of his high school), but she's not funny anymore... not that ""funny"" was ever quite the word for it, it was always way too uncomfortable to be quite funny.  The actress just isn't into it anymore, maybe she feels squicky (although why now, after a full 3 seasons, I don't know!), and it's just not funny - in that awful I'm going to hell for laughing way - anymore.  The new history teacher/football coach picks up the slack, but with the jerk maneuver he pulls in the last episode, he went from being my favorite new character to being irrevocably a piss-ant.Loved the whole show, all 4 seasons of it, and every single episode... until the last one.

It ended like a Spike Lee movie. Weird.THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:After being forced to repeat the 10th grade for tardiness (who does that?) Chris decides to get his GED. Rochelle opens the results, Chris asks, ""What does it say?"" and that's it. Fade to black. Theme Song. Credits. HUH?We don't know what happened to Chris. We don't know if the lady Julius loaned $25 to ever paid him back. We don't know why the suspicious looking guy was in the restaurant. And we don't know why such a great show with such excellent writers would end a show with no closure. Were they hoping for a 5th season? Now that would make sense. That's the only sense I can make out of such an awful ending to this amazing show.I still recommend purchasing it. The rest of the episodes are on point, funny as ever! This is one show that did not lose something over the years. Every season is funny and well worth the purchase.
