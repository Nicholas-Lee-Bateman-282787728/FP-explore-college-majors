We viewed this movie on our movie night, as we have movie night, game night, devotion night etc..This movie shows how humans can lose sight, and think that they are the ones running things. So many people do think that they have the control. This movie shows that in so many ways. This movie also shows what happens when you are not in your right position.We liked the christian values that were in this movie, as faith based movies are finally getting the attention they deserve. We viewed this movie with our family and it was clean fun.I read one review that talks about the club scene, how ever when we viewed the movie we did not see anything that was inappropriate. For us we are glad that the scene was shown because many christian do back slide, it only showed the truth.. You have church members that are up in the club and in the pews on Sunday morning.  And if the truth hurts, then maybe it should, so that people can begin to be healed and delivered after seeing this movie.Why should you continue to hide behind the mask of being the perfect church going person, christian, believer, etc.. Be truthful if you need help then get help from wise counsel, Godly counsel. Don't condemn this movie for showing reality. There is noting wrong with showing a person who really wants to live what they sing and preach about.. Lets get real and take off the fake skin, mask and fake church personality. Lets live right Monday through Sunday 24 hours a day and 365 days every year. Lets not judge others, lets use this movie as a tool to win souls and deliver souls.This movie just shows what goes on behind the scenes in ministry and how much of a challenge ministry is. This movie exposes the crooks, the Bishops who become lovers of themselves and lose focus of the Lord.This movie shows the labor pains of trying to birth music ministry, churches, etc. The songs in this movie are breath taking. The characters did a wonderful job.  This movie also shows forgiveness and how important it is, unconditional love, and real friendship, determination, and repentance.This movie also shows what happens when you are not in God's will and what can happen when you turn from your wicked ways. This movie shows the importance of family and how unity is Blessed.. This movie also shows what happens when you stand in faith and never give up, and when you praise and worship.As for the Haddon's, I have been following their music for years and love them both. We even have another DVD of them with voices of unity. They are awesome and have such anointing.  Thank God for this movie and the Gospel Greats who took part in this movie. This was and is a blessing. This will make a great gift for Christmas and just because.. This will make a great tool for many different ministries, etc.Hope to see more movies like this. Keep up the good work and keep sending the word of God out through film..Another great movie to view is A Good Man Is Hard To Find. Bishop Noel Jones is featured in this film. You will not be disappointed.Happy viewing!

1347454,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B003JHXS1O,Katrina L. Burchett,"[34, 35]","God opens a door and Dwight Hawkins' (Deitrick Haddon) eyes are opened. He wants something different in life; no more shackin' up, no more premarital sex. He wants to be a better man and he wants to use the gift God gave him. Dwight Hawkins is anointed to sing. Bishop Wright recognizes his gift and makes him Minister of Music of the church. Things are going along as well as can be expected, but then Dwight suffers a loss. He begins to struggle with his faith and makes bad choices. This gives the Bishop, who is jealous of Dwight's standing in the church by this time, just the ammunition he needs to get rid of him. Dwight works hard to get back on track for the Lord, but the word of his bad actions had spread, making his efforts seem worthless. But there is someone who still believes in him, so he isn't down for long.I have two of Deitrick Haddon's' albums (Lost and Found/Crossroads) and I really enjoy listening to his modern gospel music. This is the reason why I purchased this DVD, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I'm sorry to say that some of the acting was over the top (not all, just some), but I'm glad to say that I am not referring to Deitrick's acting skills. He is a natural!! His performance and all of the music were what I liked about this movie; I was glad to see there were two music videos in the special features I could enjoy.What didn't I like? The movie jumps around and some scenes seem incomplete or unexplained. And, I guess it was supposed to be for effect, but sometimes the camera would come in and out of focus and that happened too much, as well as too many close ups in certain parts. Blessed & Cursed is described as a modern twist on the biblical tale of David and Saul, but the plot wasn't clear.
