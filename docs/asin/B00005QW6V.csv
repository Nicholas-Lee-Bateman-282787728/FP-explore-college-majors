You have to remember to take it as entertainment, not as education, and not expect it to be perfect. Tombstone and Young Guns were possibly prettier and more accurate as to location (Young Guns was at least partially filmed in New Mexico, the state where Billy the Kid did operate, while American Outlaws, set mostly in Missouri, was filmed in Texas)but this movie is not really too bad. It stretches history to the breaking point in several places and has characters doing things the real persons likely never did but it is obviously meant to be for fun, and the younger viewing market. Unlike some I do not happen to think that John Wayne was so great, Clint Eastwood was better, these younger guys do just fine and as for historical accuracy I believe American Outlaws is as good as most westerns in about every way.",3,"Light escapist fun, don't take it to be historical fact",1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,929,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'have', 'remember', 'take', 'entertainment', 'not', 'education', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'perfect', 'Tombstone', 'Young', 'Guns', 'were', 'possibly', 'prettier', 'more', 'accurate', 'location', 'Young', 'Guns', 'was', 'least', 'partially', 'filmed', 'New', 'Mexico', 'state', 'where', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'did', 'operate', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'set', 'mostly', 'Missouri', 'was', 'filmed', 'Texas', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'history', 'breaking', 'point', 'several', 'places', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'real', 'persons', 'likely', 'never', 'did', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'younger', 'viewing', 'market', 'do', 'not', 'happen', 'think', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'better', 'younger', 'guys', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'believe', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'westerns', 'about', 'way']",N/A

This film is hardly as much fun as `The Newton Boys', but it has a similar vibe.  I love Colin Farrell (such an underrated actor, if not an overrated celebrity) but his performance here has no real depth.  He is just smitten with the camera (as it is with him) and so he delivers a charismatic portrayal of Jesse James that didn't win him any accolades but did win him legions of teenage fans.  The entire cast of rising Youngblood's (none of which made lasting careers outside of Farrell unless you count Larter's television resurgence) handles the mediocre material with charm, so they help lighten the mood and make the film tolerable.  That said, if you are looking for a historically accurate (or even just historically authentic) telling of the Wild West then I'd stay far away from this one.  If you just want a bright and semi-exciting teen flick then this may be what you are looking for.  Scott Caan is always a reliable `side man', and he easily manages `Best-in-Show' mentions here.  That isn't saying a whole lot, but I like him so what can I say.

After watching AMERICAN OUTLAWS, it made me wonder if the producers even researched the James/Younger Gang?  Did they visit their local library?  Did they interview any of the existing family members to come up with some cool antidotes?  Or did they just decide it was time for a western.  Then they sat in their carpeted Hollywood offices, threw together a cliche' riddled script in a couple of weeks, gathered up a handful of young good-looking newcomers and went to work.

But without the cracklin' William Goldman script and the Newman/Redford star power, all is futile.  Scott Caan's performance is as expressive as a thick slice of white bread and maybe half as flavourful.  Farrell is charming at spots, but this screen version of Jesse James is so bland, so wholesomely American hero-like, that there's no emotional attachment to be found (discredit once again to the embarrassingly simplistic script).  Larter is one of the most beautiful actresses her age and her feistiness and sex appeal are terrific (witness her small part in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and, more prominently, Final Destination), but she fits into this Western setting as oil fits in water.  And to director Les Mayfield:  How about giving our &quot;hero&quot; a hard time once in a while?  When somebody gets shot in this movie, they either recover within two sequences (generally about a minute's screen time), or die peacefully.  When Jesse James is captured, they give him such an easy time it's a wonder why they bother.I made it through most of this movie without having to use the search function on my DVD player, so I guess there's a vague sense of interest there.

In this version of the Jesse James story, the gang, led by Colin Farrell as Jesse James and Scott Caan as Cole Younger resorts to bank and train robbery when the railroad seeks to buy up their families' farms for a pittance.  The James-Younger Gang is portrayed as 19th century merrymen who prefer to avoid murder when possible and who donate a portion of their proceeds back to the communities.  The long list of murders attributed to the gang is downplayed.The movie combines some creative escapes and rescues and some excellent equestrian scenes with a good mix of humor.  Wanted posters provide a continuing source of laughs as early robbery victims fail to recognize the boys from their poorly drawn posters, and later, one of the Younger brothers tries to stand out more during a robbery so that people will remember what he looks like because he's frustrated by the poor likeness that appears on his wanted poster.  Kathy Bates as the Ma James makes some very funny comments about being proud of her boys for being good Christians and killing Yankees.Authenticity, however, has gone out the window in many areas: costuming, historical accuracy, dialogue, music.  Although James didn't marry his sweetheart Zee Mimms until 1874, in ""American Outlaws"" James appears to leave the gang to marry not so many years after the Civil War....The costuming for Mimms (Ali Larter) is glaringly awful.  Although she would look great in accurate period clothes and hairstyles, the film makers seemed to opt for attire from the nearest country-western shop--perhaps to maximize her ""hot babe"" appeal.  Other characters, such as Bates, get more authentic costumes.The music also seemed to be selected to appear to teens and twentysomethings rather than to reflect an accurate 1860s sound.  This musical direction struck me as ironic considering that ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou"" has renewed interest in traditional bluegrass music, which has its roots in the era featured in ""American Outlaws,"" and the 19th century song ""Minstral Boy"" has been heard recently in ""Black Hawk Down"" and on commercials.As for dialogue, although the James gang doesn't run around addressing each other as ""Hey, Dude,"" the language still sounds too modern for the period.So, overall, great action and funny moments throughout make this an entertaining but inauthentic movie.Note: This review does not refer to the DVD.

But give the guy credit:  he does a very good job, although not up to par to some of his other work (Recruit, Hart's War, Tigerland).  Obviously not a fact-based work, AMERICAN OUTLAWS, under the astute direction of Les Mayfield, nonetheless is an entertaining western, filled with anachronistic dialogue and music, but also filled with heart, humor and adventure in mind.  In this version, Jesse and his brother Frank (well envisioned by Gabriel Macht) and his cousins, the Youngers (Scott Caan, Will McCormack and Gregory Smith) are fighting in the Civil War where we get to see Frank's expert shooting and Jesse's wildass courage and outright idiocy!  The war is now over so everyone returns home to find that the railroad companies are forcing farmers to sell them their land.  Kathy Bates in a brief but memorable turn plays the James mother, and when she is killed by Pinkerton detectives, the boys take matters into their own.Wayfield plays the gang as a Robin Hood, with typical jealousy on the part of Caan's Cole Younger.  Timothy Dalton as Pinkerton seems James Bondish in his delivery and Harris Yulin pumps up the ham to play the dastardly railroad owner.All in all, the film is as entertaining as it needs to be and even though Jesse and gang are almost beatified, they still have a little of that bad boy in them to make it believable, even though it's not!!!",4,COLIN GOES WEST,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,1473,"['incredibly', 'gifted', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'one', 'Irishman', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'James', 'give', 'guy', 'credit', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'par', 'other', 'work', 'Recruit', 'Hart', 'War', 'Tigerland', 'Obviously', 'not', 'fact-based', 'work', 'AMERICAN', 'OUTLAWS', 'astute', 'direction', 'Les', 'Mayfield', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining', 'western', 'filled', 'anachronistic', 'dialogue', 'music', 'also', 'filled', 'heart', 'humor', 'adventure', 'mind', 'version', 'Jesse', 'brother', 'Frank', 'well', 'envisioned', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'cousins', 'Youngers', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Will', 'McCormack', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'are', 'fighting', 'Civil', 'War', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'Frank', 'expert', 'shooting', 'Jesse', 'wildass', 'courage', 'outright', 'idiocy', 'war', 'now', 'so', 'everyone', 'home', 'find', 'railroad', 'companies', 'are', 'forcing', 'farmers', 'sell', 'land', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'brief', 'memorable', 'turn', 'James', 'mother', 'when', 'killed', 'Pinkerton', 'detectives', 'boys', 'take', 'matters', 'own.Wayfield', 'gang', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'typical', 'jealousy', 'part', 'Caan', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Pinkerton', 'James', 'Bondish', 'delivery', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'up', 'ham', 'play', 'dastardly', 'railroad', 'owner.All', 'film', 'as', 'entertaining', 'be', 'even', 'Jesse', 'gang', 'are', 'almost', 'beatified', 'still', 'have', 'little', 'bad', 'boy', 'make', 'believable', 'even', 'not']",N/A

This movie is nothing more than a vapid action cliche built around the newest group of fresh faces in Hollywood. It is an atrocity to the genre of the Western, and offers no historical value whatsoever.I am a big action movie fan. But it takes a little more than a piece of fluff like this to gain my attention. In the short amount I watched, I could tell the direction it was headed. The youngest of the Younger brothers twirling his gun around and behind his back and re-holstering it to prove he was old enough to fight the government agents come to rob his family of it's land is just one example of the lame quality of this movie.I grew up in the day when the Western still had some clout. Clint Eastwood is my idea of the perfect Western hero, right along with his protrayal in A Fistful Of Dollars. That is the standard to which I hold all Westerns I watch, and this one doesn't even come close.Some action fans might enjoy this movie, but it's sad that the Western has degenerated to this.

Even though this is essentially a revenge story, it does not carry the weight of, say, Dostoevsky. What it does accomplish, however, is to make the inner child within all of us want to be cowboys. American Outlaws captures the spirit of the dime novel to bring you yet another interpretation of the Jesse James story. All the outlaws are good, the people they fight are bad, and all the showdowns feature more action and gunplay than you can shake a stick at. It is not blood-and-guts gunplay, but more what you'd see from Frontier Town at Disney World. What definately caught me by surprise was the adherence to the way guns were in the Old West. Sure, there's the occasional &quot;No way&quot; shot, but most of the action has one man walking among many guns blazing because the others can't react fast enough because of surprise or shock. You could do that in the Old West because revolvers were primitive enough that the best shots were close up and calm. If you did the unexpected, the other guy was much less likely to hit you. The only real I almost wish this was a PG movie so that more kids would see it, but I think the studios felt they'd make more as a teen movie than as a family flick.

676245,A1P9QCU33WQQED,B00005QW6V,Sandra Robertson,"[5, 5]","I must immediately say that this film is a whole lot of fun. The actors are young, cute, talented, and obviously having a great time. Colin Farrell and Gabriel Macht have clearly captured the spirit of the James brothers; Scott Caan has his father's looks, charm and very good handle on the boldness and ruthlessness of Cole Younger; Will McCormack is a scene-stealing comic, and Ali Larter is--well, she's very pretty. The show is helped out immeasurably by veterans Timothy Dalton and Kathy Bates. (Bates would have been an even more natural choice for the James boys' mother if the part had been written closer to history, which it wasn't.) There are some wonderful action/adventure Indiana Jones-y stunts and the pace of the film is brisk. It's a Saturday afternoon kind of movie--fun, good-looking,and not mentally taxing.My problem was that I bought the film to give me some insight into the history of the James Gang, and if you are looking for reality, this isn't it. It's a combination of half-truth, made-up-out-of-whole-cloth falsehood, and so many anachronisms we lost count. Anachronisms can be charming--as ""A Knight's Tale"" illustrates so well-- and part of the movie's charm is the 21st century Saved-by-the-Bell language that these kids bring to their roles as famous desperadoes. If you know anything about the James Gang, the Civil War, or the history of western expansion, parts of this movie will drive you crazy. A partial list:1. The opening scene takes place during the last days of the Civil War with Frank James taking out a Gatling Gun with his sharpshooter's Winchester rifle, a' la' Sergeant York. Gatling guns were not used in the Civil War (except as a test case), and Frank's Winchester is an 1880's invention.2. Cole Younger was never about to be hanged by Federals and so the James boys didn't free him from the gallows, but it IS a great scene to watch.3. Most of the climactic scenes involve Jesse's escape from captivity. Jesse James was never captured. He was shot in the back of the head at his home by a former gang member for reward money.4. Mrs. James (her name was Zerelda Samuel) was not killed by the Pinkerton Raid. She lost an arm but lived well into old age. However, not mentioned by the movie was that her 8-year-old son Archie Samuel, the James boys' half-brother, was killed in the raid.5. Jim Younger wasn't shot dead as a teenager after some bank job--he killed himself in his 50's after he was paroled from prison.6. Pinkerton never saw the James Boys in person, but directed the hunt for them from Chicago.7. In the film, Nathaniel Arcand brings ethnic diversity to the Gang as ""Commanche Tom,"" but I can't find a record of anyone named Tom in the James Gang and no one who was obviously Native American. I think his role was just a token; if you have ""cowboys"" you have to have an ""Indian"" too.8. Ali Larter was just precious, but her loose flowing Breck-girl hair and Gap-style gauzy clothing were anachronistic. And the idea the she led a raid to free (the never-imprisoned-in-the-first-place) Jesse, guns blazing, is totally out of character for her or most women of the age. The directors DID manage to present ""ladies of the evening"" as something less than Hollywood-beautiful, which is probably closer to the truth, however.Enjoy this film. It is meant to be enjoyed.

The movie is pure legend, with not a shred of history allowed to intrude. I liked it. It worked because they didn't try to play it too seriously. This was the flaw in the Rob Lowe/Bill Paxton movie &quot;Frank and Jesse&quot;--they tried to make us take their hopeless mangling of history seriously.&quot;American Outlaws&quot; played it for fun, adventure, and legend. It covers only a single year time span during which time they seem to have robbed every bank in Missouri. Busy boys. The gang was also a sensitive, nurturing gang to the lesser-known members (funny scene).I can't possibly list all the diversions from actual history they made as they barely ever drifted even close to reality. Cole Younger would have hated the movie--they had him portrayed as the dumb guy. Frank was the smart one, and Jesse, of course, was the cute, dangerous one. The Irish guy who played Jesse did a good job. He didn't sound like he was trying to overcome an Irish accent, did a good, flat American, but he didn't really sound like anyone from Missouri either. He almost miraculously managed to always have that ever-so-manly two-day growth of beard ala Miami Vice.The setting was the film's biggest weakness--it looked much more like California than Missouri. Way too brown and dry, wrong kinds of trees. The town of Liberty looked like a generic Hollywood western town set, not at all right.So, I recommend &quot;American Outlaws&quot; as a fun action movie, _not_ as history. They did use the perils to returning Rebels pretty well at first but soon lost that to the whole purely fictional railroad plotline.

(If you are interested in other Jesse James film, see &quot;The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid.)  After the Civil War, Jesse, his brother Frank (Gabriel Macht) and Cole Younger (Scott Caan) formed a group to attack the railroad company which, according to the film, relentlessly buys up the land of the farmers (two dollars for one acre).  Some say Jesse and Cole are American heroes.The film is right in giving us simple settting, ignoring some historical truths; but the film also ignores our reaction to countless actions that lead us nowhere in particular, like the script of 1994 Drew Barrymore film &quot;Bad Girls.&quot;  (Well, the poster was good.)  The railroad company led by Harris Yulin and Terry O'Quinn is jsut a bunch of risible, one-dimentional, old-fashioned villains who are there to be despised.  Even Timothy Dalton who plays Allan Pinkerton looks theatrical, not because of his acting, but because of the character's illogical response.  You expect from Pinkerton some smart scheme to catch the group.  No.  His 'plan' is little better than the one found in hackneyed TV episode of some detective drama.But what is most disappointing is the acting of the cast.  Collin Farrell doesn't seem to be interested in the role, nor other actors except very few (I mean hot shot Gregory Smith and humorous Will McCormack).  You cannot distinguish one from another, and if one of them is gunned down, it is shown in a most balnd way so that we don't care.  Probably that has something to do with the hot climate of Texas where the film was shot.  But in &quot;Tigerland&quot; in which humid air is easily felt, Colin Farrell was fantastic.  Here he is not.Two actresses appear: Ali Larter as Jesse's love Zee Mimms (who really married Jesse), and Kathy Bates as Jesse's mother (who really didn't meet the same fate as the film shows).  And I don't know why they should be here, giving awful dialogues, doing just unmemorable roles.  And you know it's Kathy Bates; it is amazing that she is unmemorable and gives awful dialogues.What you see in this movie is just another fast-paced, action-packed Hollywood movie about guns and explosions.  The film never stops, thanks to the director Les Mayfield (&quot;Flubber&quot; and &quot;Blue Streak&quot;), and like these films he doesn't show any originality.

And I find the situation AWKWARD when the cavalry are about to pursue the retreating Yankee forces and run straight into a long line of haggard Confederate troops. The dialogue goes like this:COLE: What are you fellas doing? There's more Yankees back there!CONFEDERATE SOLDIER: The war's over, son. General Lee surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.BOB YOUNGER: Well, somebody better tell the damn Yankees!That scene put kind of a twist on things, which incites the James and Cole brothers to go home back to Missouri, where they find a new threat hanging over their lives--railroad detectives trying to force farmers off their land and raising hell for anyone who refuses their offer of $2 an acre. Jesse James soon decides to declare a personal war on the railroad, hurting them most by simply robbing them of their financial assets.Other critics harangue this film for it's ""lack of historical accuracy."" Well, if you want to see historical accuracy, go and watch the movie, ""The Life of Jesse James."" This movie never said ""Based on a True Story"" but simply revolves around the first daytime bank robberies in U.S. history, whether or not the scenes are true. 50 percent of the things in this movie may have never happened, but it still makes for a good movie. My favorite scene is when some of the gang members are guarding the bank from the outside, and trying to protect themselves from the cane of a bitter, indignant old man who wants to go to the bank.OLD MAN: There ain't no gol-durned bank holiday!INDIAN SCOUT: Sir, you're right about that.OLD MAN: Well, why can't I go in there?INDIAN SCOUT: On account on that we're uh...robbing it.OLD MAN: Oh!

676252,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B00005QW6V,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[0, 1]","As westerns go, ""American Outlaws"" amounts to an above-average horse opera that knows when to giddy-yap and when to giddy-up. Les Mayfield, who directed ""Flubber"" and ""Blue Streak,"" stages several exhilarating but bloodless gunfights that owe their epic grandeur to Hong Kong action maestro John Woo of ""Face/Off"" fame as much as traditional cowboy classics like Clint Eastwood's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" While this blatantly romanticized account of the notorious Jesse James-Cole Younger gang lacks the authenticity of either ""The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid"" (1972) or ""The Long Riders"" (1980), Mayfield keeps the action going at a gallop. Moreover, scenarists Roderick Taylor and John Rogers have juggled the chronology of events to heighten dramatic impact. Clearly, ""American Outlaws"" duplicates the surefire ""Young Guns"" formula, portraying Jesse as a saintly Robin Hood bandit. While Irish heartthrob Colin Farrell resembles actor Tyrone Power, who starred as Jesse James in the prototypical 1939 Technicolor version of ""Jesse James,"" he looks nothing like the real-life Jesse Woodson James. Nevertheless,western aficionados should applaud the way that Mayfield has kept the conventions of the genre intact while adding enough fresh touches to enhance this superficial but stimulating shoot'em-up.""American Outlaws"" covers the early years of James-Younger gang. The upbeat Taylor & Rogers script doesn't depict the tragic demise Jesse met at the hands of the double-crossing sidewinder who bushwhacked him for the bounty. This flavorful variation unfolds as the Civil War concludes. Federal troops have pinned down Frank James (Gabriel Macht of ""Simply Irresistible""), Cole Younger (Scott Caan of ""Varsity Blues""), and Bob Younger (Gregory Smith of ""Boiler Room"") with cannon fire when Jesse (Colin Farrell of ""Tigerland"") rides to their rescue. Mayfield establishes Jesse's hell-bent-for-leather audacity when our impetuous protagonist launches a fearless charge against an army of Yankees. Farrell imitates John Wayne in ""True Grit"" as he rides full-tilt into battle, blazing away with two six-shooters while he keeps his horses' reins clenched between his teeth.After surviving this fracas, our heroes return to Missouri to resume farming. Along come villainous railroad baron Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin of ""Rush Hour 2"") and henchman Rollin Parker (Terry O'Quinn of ""The Stepfather"") who are stealing property at two dollars-per-acre. When they approach Ma James (Kathy Bates of ""Misery""), she wants her sons to gun them down. Frank convinces Ma to hold off. Rains' chief troubleshooter, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton of ""License to Kill""), warns them that was Rains' only offer. Parker retaliates after the James refuse to sell and sends his ruffians to dynamite their farm. Ma James dies in the explosion, and Jesse and Frank saddle up with the Youngers to wreck vengeance on the railroad.While ""American Outlaws"" doesn't qualify as a classic, this better-than-average sagebrusher provides a glimpse of the old West we haven't seen in many moons. As Jesse's stalwart wife Zee Mimms, Ali Larter of ""Final Destination"" has a way with stopping trains dead in their tracks. A crackerjack supporting cast, especially Dalton as Pinkerton, makes ""American Outlaws"" fun to watch.",3,An above-average horse opera that knows when to giddy-yap and when to giddy-up,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,3294,"['westerns', 'go', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'amounts', 'above-average', 'horse', 'opera', 'when', 'giddy-yap', 'when', 'giddy-up', 'Les', 'Mayfield', 'who', 'directed', 'Flubber', 'Blue', 'Streak', 'several', 'exhilarating', 'bloodless', 'gunfights', 'owe', 'epic', 'grandeur', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'maestro', 'John', 'Woo', 'Face/Off', 'fame', 'as', 'much', 'traditional', 'cowboy', 'classics', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'blatantly', 'romanticized', 'account', 'notorious', 'Jesse', 'James-Cole', 'Younger', 'gang', 'authenticity', 'Great', 'Northfield', 'Minnesota', 'Raid', '1972', 'Long', 'Riders', '1980', 'Mayfield', 'action', 'going', 'gallop', 'Moreover', 'scenarists', 'Roderick', 'Taylor', 'John', 'Rogers', 'have', 'juggled', 'chronology', 'events', 'heighten', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Clearly', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'surefire', 'Young', 'Guns', 'formula', 'portraying', 'Jesse', 'saintly', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'bandit', 'Irish', 'heartthrob', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'actor', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'who', 'starred', 'Jesse', 'James', 'prototypical', '1939', 'Technicolor', 'version', 'Jesse', 'James', 'nothing', 'real-life', 'Jesse', 'Woodson', 'James', 'Nevertheless', 'western', 'aficionados', 'should', 'applaud', 'way', 'Mayfield', 'kept', 'conventions', 'genre', 'intact', 'adding', 'enough', 'fresh', 'touches', 'enhance', 'superficial', 'stimulating', ""shoot'em-up"", 'American', 'Outlaws', 'early', 'years', 'James-Younger', 'gang', 'upbeat', 'Taylor', 'Rogers', 'script', ""n't"", 'depict', 'tragic', 'demise', 'Jesse', 'met', 'hands', 'double-crossing', 'sidewinder', 'who', 'bushwhacked', 'bounty', 'flavorful', 'variation', 'unfolds', 'Civil', 'War', 'concludes', 'Federal', 'troops', 'have', 'pinned', 'down', 'Frank', 'James', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Simply', 'Irresistible', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'Bob', 'Younger', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'cannon', 'fire', 'when', 'Jesse', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Tigerland', 'rescue', 'Mayfield', 'Jesse', 'hell-bent-for-leather', 'audacity', 'when', 'impetuous', 'protagonist', 'fearless', 'charge', 'army', 'Yankees', 'Farrell', 'John', 'Wayne', 'True', 'Grit', 'full-tilt', 'battle', 'blazing', 'away', 'two', 'six-shooters', 'horses', 'reins', 'clenched', 'teeth.After', 'surviving', 'fracas', 'heroes', 'return', 'Missouri', 'resume', 'farming', 'come', 'villainous', 'railroad', 'baron', 'Thaddeus', 'Rains', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Rush', '2', 'henchman', 'Rollin', 'Parker', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Stepfather', 'who', 'are', 'stealing', 'property', 'two', 'dollars-per-acre', 'When', 'approach', 'Ma', 'James', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Misery', 'sons', 'gun', 'down', 'Frank', 'Ma', 'hold', 'off', 'Rains', 'chief', 'troubleshooter', 'Allan', 'Pinkerton', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'License', 'Kill', 'was', 'Rains', 'only', 'offer', 'Parker', 'James', 'refuse', 'sell', 'sends', 'ruffians', 'dynamite', 'farm', 'Ma', 'James', 'explosion', 'Jesse', 'Frank', 'saddle', 'up', 'Youngers', 'wreck', 'vengeance', 'railroad.While', 'American', 'Outlaws', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'classic', 'better-than-average', 'sagebrusher', 'glimpse', 'old', 'West', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'moons', 'Jesse', 'stalwart', 'wife', 'Zee', 'Mimms', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Final', 'Destination', 'way', 'stopping', 'trains', 'dead', 'tracks', 'crackerjack', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Dalton', 'Pinkerton', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

676255,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005QW6V,Westley,"[4, 6]","I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Colin Farrel, and he does a decent job playing Jesse James, even if he does occasionally lapse into his thick Irish brogue.  However, I was very disappointed in the movie as a whole.  Jesse and his older brother Frank, join forces with three of the Younger brothers to fight against the railroad that is taking over farms in their native Missouri.  After their farm is raided and their mother (played very broadly by Kathy Bates) is killed, they go on a rampage of bank robberies, stealing from the railroad to shut it down.  The young actors are likeable enough in their roles, but the dialogue is not realistic at all and relies too heavily on weak humor during the bank robberies.  I admitedly chuckled a few times, but more often groaned at the lack of realism.  The gunfights are mildly interesting but again are too unrealistic.  Finally, the beautiful Ali Larter is completely wrong as Jesse's love interest.  She is much too comtemporary and seems lost in her role.  A shame that all this talent is wasted.  Fans of Colin Farrel would be better off getting ""Tigerland"" and western fans should check out ""The Wild Bunch,"" which has some of the same elements as ""American Outlaws.""",1,Completely unrealistic western,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,1225,"['saw', 'movie', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'James', 'even', 'occasionally', 'lapse', 'thick', 'Irish', 'brogue', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'whole', 'Jesse', 'older', 'brother', 'Frank', 'join', 'forces', 'three', 'Younger', 'brothers', 'fight', 'railroad', 'taking', 'over', 'farms', 'native', 'Missouri', 'farm', 'raided', 'mother', 'played', 'very', 'broadly', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'killed', 'go', 'rampage', 'bank', 'robberies', 'stealing', 'railroad', 'shut', 'down', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'likeable', 'enough', 'roles', 'dialogue', 'not', 'realistic', 'relies', 'too', 'heavily', 'weak', 'humor', 'bank', 'robberies', 'admitedly', 'chuckled', 'few', 'times', 'more', 'often', 'groaned', 'lack', 'realism', 'gunfights', 'are', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'again', 'are', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'Finally', 'beautiful', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Jesse', 'love', 'interest', 'much', 'too', 'comtemporary', 'lost', 'role', 'shame', 'talent', 'wasted', 'Fans', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'Tigerland', 'western', 'fans', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'same', 'elements', 'American', 'Outlaws']",N/A
676256,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005QW6V,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released in 2001, ""American Outlaws"" is yet another rendition of Jesse James, Cole Younger and their Gang. This one focuses on the end of the Civil War and the first year or so of the gang's activities (which lasted a whole decade in reality, from 1866-76).""American Outlaws"" is highlighted by a great cast with great chemistry, including Colin Farrell as Jesse, Scott Caan (aka 'Danno') as Cole, the beautiful Ali Larter as Zee, Jesse's girlfriend/wife, and Timothy Dalton as the lead Pinkerton. The film plays it fairly serious accented by a fun, joie de vivre spirit, sorta like Indiana Jones in the wild West. This is the exact opposite of the grim ""The Long Riders"" from 1980 (which is arguably the best film about the James-Younger Gang). Anyway, You can tell the cast had a blast during filming.As far as historical accuracy goes, well, there was a group of outlaws in Missouri called the James-Younger Gang and they did ride horses, other than that the historicity is pretty butchered. See ""The Long Riders"" for a more austere and accurate version of the tale.BOTTOM LINE: Even though ""American Outlaws"" loses points for inaccuracies and implausibilities, it scores high in overall entertainment value. It's a turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast kind of Western. The movie performed poorly at the box office in 2001 and Roger Ebert gave it a scathing review. Ebert compared it to 1972's ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid,"" which he praised. This was strange because that film wasn't exactly realistic either; in fact, it's a veritable parody or black comedy. These movies shouldn't be compared in the first place since ""American Outlaws"" details the gang's first year in action and ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" the gang's final bank robbery, a whole decade later. Furthermore, the two films are expressly opposite in tone: ""American Outlaws"" makes the wild West fun and larger-than-life while the other film de-glamorizes it, making it profane, ugly and idiotic. In any event, ""American Outlaws"" is seriously rollicking Western lore worthy of one's video library.The film was shot in Central-East Texas (great locations, by the way) and runs a short-but-sweet 94 minutes.GRADE: B",4,"""Young Guns"" for the new millennium",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,2200,"['Released', '2001', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'yet', 'rendition', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Cole', 'Younger', 'Gang', 'one', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'first', 'year', 'so', 'gang', 'activities', 'lasted', 'whole', 'decade', 'reality', '1866-76', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'highlighted', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'chemistry', 'including', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jesse', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'aka', ""'Danno"", 'Cole', 'beautiful', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Zee', 'Jesse', 'girlfriend/wife', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'lead', 'Pinkerton', 'film', 'fairly', 'serious', 'accented', 'fun', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'spirit', 'sorta', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'wild', 'West', 'exact', 'opposite', 'grim', 'Long', 'Riders', '1980', 'arguably', 'best', 'film', 'James-Younger', 'Gang', 'Anyway', 'can', 'tell', 'cast', 'had', 'blast', 'filming.As', 'far', 'as', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'well', 'was', 'group', 'outlaws', 'Missouri', 'called', 'James-Younger', 'Gang', 'did', 'ride', 'horses', 'other', 'historicity', 'pretty', 'butchered', 'See', 'Long', 'Riders', 'more', 'austere', 'accurate', 'version', 'tale.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Even', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'points', 'inaccuracies', 'implausibilities', 'high', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'value', 'turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast', 'kind', 'Western', 'movie', 'performed', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', '2001', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'scathing', 'review', 'Ebert', 'compared', '1972', 'Great', 'Northfield', 'Minnesota', 'Raid', 'praised', 'was', 'strange', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'realistic', 'either', 'fact', 'veritable', 'parody', 'black', 'comedy', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'first', 'place', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'details', 'gang', 'first', 'year', 'action', 'Great', 'Northfield', 'Minnesota', 'Raid', 'gang', 'final', 'bank', 'robbery', 'whole', 'decade', 'later', 'Furthermore', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'expressly', 'opposite', 'tone', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'wild', 'West', 'fun', 'larger-than-life', 'other', 'film', 'de-glamorizes', 'making', 'profane', 'ugly', 'idiotic', 'event', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'seriously', 'rollicking', 'Western', 'lore', 'worthy', 'one', 'video', 'library.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Central-East', 'Texas', 'great', 'locations', 'way', 'short-but-sweet', '94', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
