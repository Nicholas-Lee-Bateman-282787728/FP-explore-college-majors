Still, given the material and the approach of the movie, Christian Slater (Lucky), Patrick Dempsey (Lansky), Richard Grieco (Siegel), and Costas Mandylor (Costello) are good in their roles.  Two really nicely done performances are Michael  Gambon as the vicious boss of all bosses, Don Faranzano and Anthony Quinn as his rival Don Masseria.Since this is a movie about Depression / Prohibition era gangsters you would expect some violence, sex, and other immorality and the movie does provide them, but not in as extreme a way as more recent movies.  I am not claiming this is a virtue or an excuse, just letting you know what is in this film.The story takes us from the four gangsters as kids and seeing their lives in their ethnic neighborhoods and seeing their parents struggle under the heels of the Black Hand, corrupt politicians, and paid off police.  Instead of deciding to fight against this and clean up the system, they decide to become a part of it and carve out their own niche on their path to money, power, and the carnal life.  The movie ends with their finally achieving the top rung of the mobster career path as still relatively young men.This is an ok movie and if you are into this sort of thing you might enjoy this.

764847,A284WUQS94AQ7A,B0000AMJEK,"Geri ""Birdie""","[2, 3]","I was surprised at how much I liked this movie!It is a story of 4 childhood friends that became the most infamous gangsters of the 20th century.  The partners are Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano (Christian Slater), Meyer Lansky (Patrick Dempsey), Bugsy Siegel (Richard Grieco) and Frank Costello (Costas Mandylor). These enterprising young men wanted to make some money during prohibition and made deals with Mafia bosses (Anthony Quinn & Michael Gambon) to move their product. The movie shows the pitfalls of dealing with the Mafia and what these 4 friends (they remained close until they died) did to survive, all the while getting deeply involved in the gang itself.  This film made you sympathize with the four young gansters rather than hate them for killings they did. We got a good glimspe of life on the mean streets of New York during the 1920s.This movie also holds a special place for me.  My sister and I owned a flower shop in LA in the early 1990s.  We knew the Property Master on this film and he hired our shop to do all the flowers---especially in the wedding scene.  We had to research wedding flowers in the 1920s and it was hard to find information on this then.  We originally used real flowers, but Anthony Quinn, kept wrecking his boutonnier.  We then had to recreate (exactly) all arrangements using silk flowers.  What a chore that was for the shop to do, but the money we made was great---no complaints!I never saw the movie until now.  While setting up the flowers, I got to see it being filmed, so I remember bits and pieces. I was surprised at how good this story and movie really is.  If you liked the Godfather series, you'll like this film.  This is not as good of a film, in my opinion, as the original Godfather, but well worth viewing.

Some biographical information on the real figures would have been great, some making of of the movie information could have been included, but instead there's nothing.If you like the movie, this might not be a bad purchase, but it seems underwhelming to me.",3,"Good movie, ok video quality, lacking in extras",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,1348,"['missed', 'forgot', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1991', 'grabbed', 'HD', 'DVD', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'it.Other', 'movies', 'have', 'spotlighted', 'characters', ""'based"", 'stories', 'movie', 'including', 'Bugsy', 'etc.', 'movie', 'ventures', 'origins', 'bigger', 'figures', 'organized', 'crime', 'early', '1900', 'also', 'noted', 'comments', 'clipped', 'Amazon', 'excuse', 'put', '4', 'hot', 'young', 'actors', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'roles.The', 'movie', 'ok', 'story', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'HD', 'DVD', 'not', 'live', 'up', ""'look"", 'sound', 'perfect', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'image', 'disturbed', 'noise', 'dirt', 'field', 'focus', 'Not', 'horribly', 'distracting', 'there', 'be', 'seen', 'times.Sound', 'levels', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'problems', 'getting', 'too', 'loud', 'too', 'quiet', 'feature', 'discs', 'definitely', 'frustrate', '.Extras', 'are', 'basically', 'non-existent', 'release', 'biographical', 'information', 'real', 'figures', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'making', 'movie', 'information', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'instead', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'purchase', 'underwhelming']",N/A

It was ok, as mob movies go, but the difference between this and a movie like ""Goodfellas"" is like little league vs Major League baseball.I saw the potential for a very good or even a great movie, if it had been handled better.  This movie was based off of the factual creation of American Cosa Nostra as we know and love it.  The formation of the Five Families.  The creation of the Commission.  The rise to power of Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel.  If handled right, this could have been another Godfather.But it wasn't.  Miscasting, for one.  And I mostly mean Christian Slater.  He could not pull off the role, struggle as he might.  Christian, could you have at least tried to do a Sicilian accent?  Just a hint of one?  No?  Ok, how about convincing emotions?  A bit of character?  No?When I started watching the movie, I was prepared for pain at the portrayal of Meyer Lansky by that kid who was in all of those late 80's-early 90's screwy romantic comedies.  But I was actually pleasantly surprised.  The kid was actually trying, and it showed.  Christian--take notes!Anyway, I'm watching this movie, as I said, and watching a good movie try to emerge from a mediocre one, and I was struck by two magic words that could have made this a movie to remember, especially considering the source material.Those two words?  Martin Scorsese.'nuff said?  The Martin Scorsese treatment + better casting = a movie for the ages.Well, hopefully someday Hollywood will do this real-life mob story *right*.  Until then, watch ""Mobsters"" with low expectations and you should be able to deal with it.",3,Well...it could have been better...,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1686,"['saw', 'cable', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'kind', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'mob', 'movies', 'go', 'difference', 'movie', 'Goodfellas', 'like', 'little', 'league', 'vs', 'Major', 'League', 'baseball.I', 'saw', 'potential', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'factual', 'creation', 'American', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', 'know', 'love', 'formation', 'Five', 'Families', 'creation', 'Commission', 'rise', 'power', 'Lucky', 'Luciano', 'Meyer', 'Lansky', 'Bugsy', 'Siegel', 'handled', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Godfather.But', 'was', ""n't"", 'Miscasting', 'one', 'mostly', 'mean', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'could', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'struggle', 'might', 'Christian', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'do', 'Sicilian', 'accent', 'Just', 'hint', 'one', 'Ok', 'how', 'convincing', 'emotions', 'bit', 'character', 'No', 'When', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'prepared', 'pain', 'portrayal', 'Meyer', 'Lansky', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'late', ""80's-early"", '90', 'screwy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'was', 'actually', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'kid', 'was', 'actually', 'trying', 'showed', 'Christian', 'take', 'notes', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'said', 'watching', 'good', 'movie', 'try', 'emerge', 'mediocre', 'one', 'was', 'struck', 'two', 'magic', 'words', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'remember', 'especially', 'considering', 'source', 'material.Those', 'two', 'words', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'said', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'treatment', '+', 'better', 'casting', '=', 'movie', 'ages.Well', 'hopefully', 'someday', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'do', 'real-life', 'mob', 'story', '*right*', 'then', 'watch', 'Mobsters', 'low', 'expectations', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'deal']",N/A

As their crime empire expands, they have to deal with many problems, including their own differing opinions on how to run their business, the local Godfather, and the psychotic Mad Dog Coll. This movie felt very rushed and it seems the producers were more interested in the action rather than story which is interesting on its own. ""Mobsters"" as a movie captures the ambiance of New York during prohibition very well. Christian Slater as Lucky Luciano, does very well with the part. Richard Grieco as Bugsy Siegel is very good, you can see the genesis of Warren Beatty's character when he played Siegel in his movie, Bugsy.
