863094,APDMVBRLIBCZV,B00068NVLQ,"Add 'em Up At The Movies ""Adam""","[5, 5]","I am a big fan of anthology series (""The Twilight Zone"", ""Tales From The Crypt"", ""Amazing Stories"", ""The Outer Limits"", ""Tales From The Darkside""), so the 1985 Twilight Zone was something I was interested in seeing. Since I was born in 1986, of course I couldn't watch the series when it aired on CBS. I also never caught it on re-runs like I have every original Twilight Zone episode from 1959 through the early 60's. When I saw it available on dvd, I thought I would buy it to check it out; and I really enojoyed it. One thing I liked right away is that these are hour-long episodes with two or three stories in them. Whether or not I liked every story, I did appreciate the structure of the series. I also liked the theme by the Grateful Dead. As a viewer looking back on something I missed when it aired, of course I viewed it as very nostaligic. Recognizing many actors and actresses who are stars today, whereas if I were watching it back in 1985, I wouldn't know them from Adam because they were either just beginning their careers or not well-known at the time.To save on space, I will only comment on the first story, which happens to be one of the best of the 1985 series in my opinion....""Shatterday"" Starring Bruce Willis / Directed by Wes CravenOne of the best episodes of this series. A then unknown Bruce Willis stars as Peter Jay Novins, a man who accidentally dials his own phone number and it's picked up by, to his surprise, Peter Jay Novins. It's an original twist on a classic Twilight Zone episode titled ""Mirror Image"" with Vera Miles as a woman waiting in a train station who encounters her own mirror image trying to take her life over. In ""Shatterday"", however, there is much more reason behind it and character depth that it makes it less scary as ""Mirror Image"" because in ""Mirror Image"", it was not explained why her other self wanted to take over her life so it was more mysterious and, therefore, scary. ""Shatterday"" is more psychologically haunting as it is a character study of a man who fully realizes why this is happening it him. It makes you stop and think about the things you do and how it can effect others as well as yourself. It is a lesson in life and how we live it with sometimes the harshest consequences. Modern master of horror Wes Craven does a masterful job of directing, and Bruce Willis' performance(s) in this episode is some of his best work.Other four star stories from the series that I put right next to ""Shatterday"" are ""Word Play"" with Robert Klein & Annie Potts, ""Examination Day"", ""A Message From Charity"", ""The Burning Man"" (very terrifying) with Roberts Blossom, ""Dealer's Choice"" with Morgan Freeman, Garrett Morris, M. Emmett Walsh, Barney Martin & Dan Heydaya (all great character actors), ""One Life Furnished In Early Poverty"" with Peter Riegert, ""Her Pilgrim Soul"", ""A Small Talent For War"" with John Glover, ""Need To Know"" with William Petersen & Frances McDormand, ""Shadow Play"" with Peter Coyote, ""Quarentine"", ""Dead Woman's Shoes"" with Helen Mirren & Jeffrey Tambor, ""Dead Run"" with Steve Railsback, ""The Library"" with Lori Petty.Some of the other stories are good, but the stories that I don't like very much whether they were boring in a non-forgiving way or they were just plain stupid are ""The Elevator"", ""Devil's Alphabet"", ""Tooth Or Consequences"", ""Grace Note"", ""Ye Gods"", ""The Little People Of Killany Woods"", ""The Last Defender Of Camelot"". Even the stories I didn't like were interesting to watch... but only once.In the end, ""The Twilight Zone (1985)"" is not the best but still a very entertaining and superior anthology series that is a must-own on dvd.",5,The Twilight  Zone (1985) is not the best but still a very entertaining and superior anthology series,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,3636,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'anthology', 'series', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Tales', 'Darkside', '1985', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'was', 'born', '1986', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'CBS', 'also', 'never', 'caught', 're-runs', 'have', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', '1959', 'early', '60', 'When', 'saw', 'available', 'dvd', 'thought', 'would', 'buy', 'check', 'out', 'really', 'enojoyed', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'right', 'away', 'are', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'two', 'three', 'stories', 'not', 'liked', 'story', 'did', 'appreciate', 'structure', 'series', 'also', 'liked', 'theme', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'viewer', 'looking', 'back', 'something', 'missed', 'when', 'aired', 'course', 'viewed', 'very', 'nostaligic', 'Recognizing', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'are', 'stars', 'today', 'were', 'watching', 'back', '1985', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Adam', 'were', 'either', 'just', 'beginning', 'careers', 'not', 'well-known', 'time.To', 'save', 'space', 'will', 'only', 'comment', 'first', 'story', 'be', 'one', 'best', '1985', 'series', 'opinion', 'Shatterday', 'Starring', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '/', 'Directed', 'Wes', 'CravenOne', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'then', 'unknown', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Peter', 'Jay', 'Novins', 'man', 'who', 'accidentally', 'own', 'phone', 'number', 'picked', 'up', 'surprise', 'Peter', 'Jay', 'Novins', 'original', 'twist', 'classic', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'titled', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'woman', 'waiting', 'train', 'station', 'who', 'own', 'mirror', 'image', 'trying', 'take', 'life', 'Shatterday', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'reason', 'character', 'depth', 'less', 'scary', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'why', 'other', 'self', 'wanted', 'take', 'over', 'life', 'was', 'more', 'mysterious', 'therefore', 'scary', 'Shatterday', 'more', 'psychologically', 'haunting', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'fully', 'why', 'happening', 'stop', 'think', 'things', 'do', 'how', 'can', 'effect', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'lesson', 'life', 'how', 'live', 'sometimes', 'harshest', 'consequences', 'Modern', 'master', 'horror', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'masterful', 'job', 'directing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'performance', 'episode', 'best', 'work.Other', 'four', 'star', 'stories', 'series', 'put', 'right', 'next', 'Shatterday', 'are', 'Word', 'Play', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'Examination', 'Day', 'Message', 'Charity', 'Burning', 'Man', 'very', 'terrifying', 'Roberts', 'Blossom', 'Dealer', 'Choice', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'Barney', 'Martin', 'Dan', 'Heydaya', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'One', 'Life', 'Furnished', 'Early', 'Poverty', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'Pilgrim', 'Soul', 'Small', 'Talent', 'War', 'John', 'Glover', 'Need', 'Know', 'William', 'Petersen', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Shadow', 'Play', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'Quarentine', 'Dead', 'Woman', 'Shoes', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Dead', 'Run', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'Library', 'Lori', 'Petty.Some', 'other', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'were', 'boring', 'non-forgiving', 'way', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'are', 'Elevator', 'Devil', 'Alphabet', 'Or', 'Consequences', 'Grace', 'Note', 'Ye', 'Gods', 'Little', 'People', 'Killany', 'Woods', 'Last', 'Defender', 'Camelot', 'Even', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'interesting', 'watch', 'only', 'end', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '1985', 'not', 'best', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'superior', 'anthology', 'series', 'must-own', 'dvd']",The Twilight Zone: Season 1

The Twilight zone in it's original guise was without a doubt the single most important television series ever, it spawned countless imitations and innovations in story telling and episodes plots were used hundreds of times in movies and tv programmes, even to this day some producer or writer somewhere is pinching an idea from it's incredible back catalogue.Anyway Back to it's 1985/86 incarnation and what you have on offer are some great (Nightcrawlers, the Shadow man, A Matter of Minutes) some not so great (Teachers aide, tooth and consequences, the Beacon) some scary (Gramma, Burning man) some ridiculous (Ye Gods, Wish bank, Red Snow) and some just downright funny (Cold reading, Monsters, i of Newton) but every episode has something to recommend about it even the rubbish ones. It also contains a raritie in the form of a remade episode that actually out shines it's original guise in the classic 'Night of the Meek'. Well worth a day or two of your time and obviously in awe of it's reputation, these episodes are a little short on budget but are ample in heart.The quality of the dvd transfer is extremely poor though so don't expect more.

863100,AGEJE3WH26UBR,B00068NVLQ,BOB,"[6, 13]","The stunning assemblage of writing, acting and directorial dignitaries for the first season of this series has never since been matched on American television.  It is lamentable, therefore, that the sum total from this talented group is far less noteworthy than the individual pedigrees of the participants.Of the 59 ""stories"" contained on these six discs, only three are truly worth being referred to as ""outstanding"": Harlan Ellison's ""Paladin Of The Lost Hour"" (winner of both the Writers Guild Of America & Hugo Awards in 1986), Alan Brennert's ""Her Pilgrim Soul"", and Brennert's adaption of Ellison's ""Shatterday"".  These stories not only stand the test of time, but are eminently worthy of repeated viewings.  Two other stories, an adaption of Roger Zelazny's ""The Last Defender Of Camelot"", and Brennert's inspired eight-minute comedy ""I Of Newton"" deserve mention.  Of the remaining stories, there are a few which may please once, but probably will not bear repetition.I remember looking forward to each original broadcast.  The five stories I listed above were so good that I kept tuning in week after week, always with the best of hopes.  However, I also remember being mostly disappointed at the end of each episode.An integral component of the emotional power of the original series was the stark black-and-white film photography.  Although Brennert himself has stepped in to clarify the issue of the video quality of this set (see his review above), it doesn't belay the fact that the color film-to-video presentation is harsh-looking and the special effects painfully amateurish and distracting.I would strongly suggest to anyone considering purchasing this set to first rent the discs from NetFlix or Blockbuster.  Then you can decide if the cost of the set, versus the reality of whether you will truly view it repeatedly, is really worth the investment.The five stories I mentioned above (located on discs 1, 3 & 6) certainly deserve repeated future viewings.  However, they'll always be available thru on-line rental outlets when you get the urge to see them.",2,TO PURCHASE? TO RENT?

But I can tell you, the picture is not that bad. Hey come on, Bruce Willis has no more hair now. People said that the picture was bad. They haven't seen the picture quality from the Sex and the City or the ST'TNG set. Those are REALLY BAD. But no, not this Twilight Zone. It is pretty good; not great but not bad either. Not everybody likes George Lucas who has that kind of resources to re-master the old stuffs to make them look brand new. But of course, I wouldn't mind to have someone who spend couple years to clean up the picture.There is an insert in the box. The insert is pretty good. It has the brief descriptions on each of the episodes and some screenshots. This really help me to find my favorite episondes. However, there is no way to skip to the actual epsiode within the ""eqsiode"" except to use the fast forward button. If I remember correctly, the last time I have to do something like this is with  my VCR.Sound quality is pretty good.  But again, these things are not really important. We are watching the Twilight Zone here. What we are really looking forward to is the story, and the writting, and the dialog.The box is ok. But I really hate this kind of DVD holder. It is kind difficult to get the disc out. I have to push the button in the middle and ""force"" the disc out.  I personally like the one that you push the button in the middle and the disc just pop it right out by itself.One more thing I like is that there is NO more of those stupid useless fancy computer animiated menu or transition thing.

863104,A3R91AXWLU19N8,B00068NVLQ,DCGUY,"[2, 2]","This is the DVD set of the first season for the ""new"" Twilight Zone season that aired during 1985-86.  The distinctive stories of the original series has carried over to the new series with many stories penned by many well known science fiction writers.  The video quality appears similar to how I saw the series on TV back in the 1980s (on a High Definition televison, there is no crisp clear picture and sound).  As another reviewer has mentioned, the TV series video archives material only consisted of old videotapes and no film negatives and the video transfer quality was limited.  However, this DVD is still very nicely packaged that consists of an episode summary brochure and each of the six DVDs are on a separate plastic page holder which provides an excellent protection to each DVD.  Two episodes of what I consider to be among the best of this series are in this set - ""A Message from Charity"" (episode 6) and ""Her Pilgrim Soul"" (episode 12).

863105,AAOT8ZNO94H0V,B00068NVLQ,Dean Anderson,"[10, 10]","Let's look at this package in its entirety.You get the full first season of ""The Twilight Zone,"" 1985 vintage, on six discs. You have to know that three shows of this type debuted in the same season: NBC's ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" ""Amazing Stories"" from Steven Speilberg, and this one. Note: you aren't seeing DVD collections of those other two.The quality of the film to DVD transfer might suffer a bit on a plasma screen or HD quality viewer, but there is no issue with the look of the episodes presented here. They are fine and you shouldn't think otherwise.The episodes are great to see years later, with such people as Lost's Terry O'Quinn, Without A Trace's Anthony La Paglia or Alias's Victor Garber doing roles in the anthology series very early in their careers, in addition to such heavyweights as Danny Kaye, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and a bunch more adding their star power to it.The stories themselves are very watchable and are, for the most part, worthy of Rod Serling's vision. There are some incredible gems in the collection but there are admittedly a few clunkers in the mix as well. But you could say the same about the original series! The lesser stories here shouldn't prevent you from getting this set, because the good far outweigh the bad.The navigation around the discs could be better. If you are just watching the eps in order, you won't notice anything. But if you want to move around, you're in trouble. You can't skip the opening title sequence of the episodes; you have to fast forward past it. And you can't skip to the various segments within any story in an episode (assuming the story takes more than one segment). That is unfortunate.The extras should also be mentioned here. I have a problem with commentary tracks generally, in that the people involved frequently are seeing the scenes for the first time since they were made, and because of that, the comments are frequently unfocused or rambling. Unfortunately, that's something of the case here. Granted, you get Writer/Director Wes Craven, Exec Producer Phil DeGuere and a host of the creatives involved in the production of the programs. And you get commentary tracks on a surpising number of the eps.They do provide you with some info on those audio tracks, but frequently it's more like old home week, and sometimes their talks come off like ""shoot the bull"" reunions rather than a real examination of the process or analysis of the stories.The commentary tracks are better than nothing, but ideally, they should be separate discussions after the principals have viewed the eps. I found that tracks where it is just one commentator speaking were better because there was more focus there.To their credit, they do give us 14 minutes of Wes Craven on camera in an office setting to talk about many aspects of the show, so that's a touch of what fans would really like and appreciate.Overall, the project is fascinating though and is very worth adding to your collection, whether you remember it from its original broadcasts, caught it in syndicated reruns or if you've never seen it before.Recommended.",4,Zone Out In A Big Way!,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,3104,"['Let', 'look', 'package', 'entirety.You', 'get', 'full', 'first', 'season', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '1985', 'vintage', 'six', 'discs', 'have', 'know', 'three', 'shows', 'type', 'debuted', 'same', 'season', 'NBC', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'one', 'Note', 'are', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'DVD', 'collections', 'other', 'two.The', 'quality', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'might', 'suffer', 'bit', 'plasma', 'screen', 'HD', 'quality', 'viewer', 'issue', 'look', 'episodes', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'fine', 'should', ""n't"", 'think', 'otherwise.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'see', 'years', 'later', 'such', 'people', 'Lost', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Trace', 'Anthony', 'La', 'Paglia', 'Alias', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'doing', 'roles', 'anthology', 'series', 'very', 'early', 'careers', 'addition', 'such', 'heavyweights', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'bunch', 'more', 'adding', 'star', 'power', 'it.The', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'watchable', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'worthy', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'vision', 'are', 'incredible', 'gems', 'collection', 'are', 'admittedly', 'few', 'clunkers', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'original', 'series', 'lesser', 'stories', 'here', 'should', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'getting', 'set', 'good', 'far', 'outweigh', 'bad.The', 'navigation', 'discs', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'are', 'just', 'watching', 'eps', 'order', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'want', 'move', 'around', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'episodes', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'various', 'segments', 'story', 'episode', 'assuming', 'story', 'more', 'one', 'segment', 'unfortunate.The', 'extras', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'mentioned', 'here', 'have', 'problem', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'generally', 'people', 'involved', 'frequently', 'are', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'first', 'time', 'were', 'made', 'comments', 'are', 'frequently', 'unfocused', 'rambling', 'Unfortunately', 'something', 'case', 'here', 'Granted', 'get', 'Writer/Director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Exec', 'Producer', 'Phil', 'DeGuere', 'host', 'creatives', 'involved', 'production', 'programs', 'get', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'surpising', 'number', 'eps.They', 'do', 'provide', 'info', 'audio', 'tracks', 'frequently', 'more', 'old', 'home', 'week', 'sometimes', 'talks', 'come', 'shoot', 'bull', 'reunions', 'rather', 'real', 'examination', 'process', 'analysis', 'stories.The', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'better', 'nothing', 'ideally', 'should', 'be', 'separate', 'discussions', 'principals', 'have', 'viewed', 'eps', 'found', 'tracks', 'where', 'just', 'one', 'commentator', 'speaking', 'were', 'better', 'was', 'more', 'focus', 'credit', 'do', 'give', '14', 'minutes', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'camera', 'office', 'setting', 'talk', 'many', 'aspects', 'show', 'touch', 'what', 'fans', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'appreciate.Overall', 'project', 'fascinating', 'very', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'remember', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'caught', 'syndicated', 'reruns', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Recommended']",The Twilight Zone: Season 1

My favorites then are the same as now, but I have discovered a few extra.They range from a couple of minutes to a half hour per episode. You never know what you are going to get. I wish there was a run-time for each story within, but beggars can't be choosers.""Wordplay"" is about a man who has to learn very complex vocabulary for his work, and all of a sudden, certain words in the English language make no sense to him. Eventually, he can't understand anything at all and his child is sick and needs to be taken somewhere, although he doesn't know the name of it.""Examination Day"" is about a 12 year old boy in the future who is about to take a test that is given to all 12 year olds. They will then decide what will become of his future. Some do not have a future after the test is graded.One of my very favorites is ""A message from Charity."" Somehow, teenaged boy in the present time comes in contact with a teenaged girl in Puritan New England. They cannot see each other, only hear the words that are being spoken. A mistake is made and her life is in jeopardy, all because of him.""A Matter of Minutes"" is about a couple who somehow gets stuck between minutes of time. They find out that every single minute is torn down and remade to look exactly like the last. This reminds you of those times where you thought you left something in that spot, only it's not there anymore.""Button Button"" is about a couple who is desperate for money. They are given a gift. A box with one button in it. If you push the button, you will receive 200,000 dollars. But, someone will die. To push or not to push?""Little Boy Lost"" is about a woman who gets an overseas photography assignment and has to make a decision between that and staying with her loving boyfriend who desperately wants to have a baby with her. She goes on a local job and meets a boy in the park who looks strangely like he could be her son.I still have not seen all of the stories. (There are 59 in all) and some are based on stories by famous writers like Sydney Sheldon, Stephen King, and Ray Bradbury. Some are directed by well-known directors like Wes Craven. The stories have an element of the unexpected and strange, which is what makes them so enjoyable.Of course, as some others have said, the quality on each are not perfect, it ranges from okay to pretty good.

Wurzelbacher,"[11, 11]","It is indeed rare that a remake of a classic television series could be considered a gem in my eyes, especially a remake of such a spectacular series as the original ""The Twilight Zone"". But this 1980s remake makes the grade.The most important aspect of any great series is good writing. The original series had that. This remake also has excellent writers. I was pleasantly surprised when I began watching these stories. Right away I was taken back by how fun and original it was to watch Bruce Willis talking to himself in SHATTERDAY, Melinda Dillon yearning for silence in LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET, Robert Klein listening to his wife call lunch DINOSAUR, or Meg Foster realizing that her perfect world was just an illusion. And that's just part of the first disk.I have to agree that I was disappointed in the quality of the shows. They are very grainy compared to what we are used to seeing on DVDs. But I can overlook that after seeing how well this remake is done. Mr. Serling himself would probably be pleased (more than he was in NIGHT GALLERY).This DVD set is a bit pricey but the biggest disappointment would probably be the video quality as a whole. But, as I stated previously, it can be overlooked as you watch this outstanding series.One last point is that I am a big fan of TZ. I have many books with the original short stories or original scripts. I also have a book with several of these stories from this remake. It is great fun to go back to the stories and read them after watching them on this DVD set. The producers, actors, and directors did an outstanding job staging these timeless tales of drama and suspense.It's well worth purchasing.

This DVD set is a compilation of that period of excellent short-storytelling, with all of its twists and fantasy/sci-fi drama.Some notable stories include ""A Message from Charity"" (my favorite episode), ""Misfortune Cookie"" - a tale about a harsh food critic who goes to a Chinese restaurant that gives magical fortune cookies, and ""Dealer's Choice"" - the episode starring Morgan Freeman who plays a deck of cards with his buddies and the devil.""A Message from Charity"" is about a guy from 1985 (Robert Duncan Mcneill) who has a telepathic link across time with a Puritan girl (Kerry Noonan). He's a geeky academic who hasn't found any friends yet in school while she is a smart farm girl who hasn't seen or read much outside of the Bible and Shakespeare. This is where their friendship begins to develop. She can see and even taste through his senses - allowing her to experience modern day marvels such as tv, ice cream, flying, and libraries. Upon speaking of her images to a friend, she gets into serious trouble and is accused of witchcraft and it's all his fault, though Charity blames herself for lack of discretion during this period of fanatical superstition. The rest gets pretty interesting and emotional, especially with the romantic tone of the music.. might even bring out a tear or two towards the end.

The reviewer masquerading as Alan Brenner (TZ writer/producer) said that ""the 1985-87 Twilight Zone was shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then transferred to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects--everything was done on video. (We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this.)""Well Mr. Brennert that's all well and good but as the title of MY far more apt review says, who cares, crap is crap. That film-to-video excuse you're feeding us like candy sounds great and all, but if you ask me the truth of the matter is that all that really happened back then was that a bunch of cheap people wanted to save a few bucks on high quality film/video sources which were clearly available at the time.

863115,A1JVM5ZPGPF48R,B00068NVLQ,"Joe Clark ""Joker""","[10, 12]","After a year and a half of waiting, I finally had the opportunity to veiw CBS's The New Twilight Zone on DVD. I think the quality of it can be veiwed based on what you want to see. If you are a big Serling fan and beleive in the original Twilight Zone format, you might not find this series very appealing. It does not exactly follow all the rules the original TZ and UPN's TZ followed. For example, most TZ episodes consist of either a 30 minute episode OR a one hour episode. The lengths of the stories on each of these vary. Each episode is one hour but the stories can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as the entire hour. They also don't always have to come with both opening and closing narrations. And for the record. does anyone know who was narrating it, the narrator remained uncredited. The thing that I found most disapointing was the introduction to each episode. It doesn't really seem like the opening of a TV show at all until you hear the original do-do-do-do's of the original TZ theme.However, if you have a free spirit in science fiction, this can easily become your favorite DVD box set. I found the writing to be exceptional. To my very pleasent surprise, a good number of the episodes were directed by Wes Craven (director of Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream,and Last House on the Left). There is also a short documentary with Wes on the final disc. The pilot stars Bruce Willis (as a man who accidently dials his home phone number and gets an answer from his alter ego) and Melinda Dillon (who digs up a small sundial in her garden that gives her the power to freeze time). The different lengths of the shories made this series unique. It was refreshing to watch short epidoes such as Examination Day, The Uncle Devil Show and Children's Zoo. The series also includes remakes of original TZ episodes like Shadow Play, Night of the Meek and Dead Man's Shoes (renamed Dead Woman's Shoes). If you have a passion for short science fiction stories, this DVD is for you. And to all fan's of the original series, I hope you aren't disapointed.",3,Breaking the Rules of The Twilight Zone,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,2061,"['year', 'half', 'waiting', 'finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'veiw', 'CBS', 'New', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'DVD', 'think', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'veiwed', 'based', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'big', 'Serling', 'fan', 'beleive', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'format', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'series', 'very', 'appealing', 'not', 'exactly', 'follow', 'rules', 'original', 'TZ', 'UPN', 'TZ', 'followed', 'example', 'most', 'TZ', 'consist', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'lengths', 'stories', 'vary', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'short', '5', 'minutes', 'as', 'long', 'entire', 'hour', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'come', 'opening', 'closing', 'narrations', 'record', 'anyone', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'narrating', 'narrator', 'remained', 'uncredited', 'thing', 'found', 'most', 'disapointing', 'was', 'introduction', 'episode', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'opening', 'TV', 'show', 'hear', 'original', 'do-do-do-do', 'original', 'TZ', 'theme.However', 'have', 'free', 'spirit', 'science', 'fiction', 'can', 'easily', 'become', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'found', 'writing', 'be', 'exceptional', 'very', 'pleasent', 'surprise', 'good', 'number', 'episodes', 'were', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'director', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'also', 'short', 'documentary', 'Wes', 'final', 'disc', 'pilot', 'stars', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'man', 'who', 'accidently', 'home', 'phone', 'number', 'answer', 'alter', 'ego', 'Melinda', 'Dillon', 'who', 'up', 'small', 'sundial', 'garden', 'power', 'freeze', 'time', 'different', 'lengths', 'shories', 'made', 'series', 'unique', 'was', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'short', 'epidoes', 'such', 'Examination', 'Day', 'Uncle', 'Devil', 'Show', 'Children', 'Zoo', 'series', 'also', 'remakes', 'original', 'TZ', 'episodes', 'Shadow', 'Play', 'Night', 'Meek', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'renamed', 'Dead', 'Woman', 'Shoes', 'have', 'passion', 'short', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'DVD', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'hope', 'are', ""n't"", 'disapointed']",The Twilight Zone: Season 1

This was the sequel to the classic Rod Serling series and featured some great stories that were very well written. It has all sorts of stories-science fiction,romance,horror,comedy,satire,fantasy stories and is an outstanding series. The opening titles include a one second animation of Rod Serling as a salute to the original creator.The Twilight Zone 1985 Season One DVD set has 24 one hour episodes with 59 stories.It is unique in that the stories vary from 10 minutes to 45 minutes and it is the only series that I have seen that did this.This series had scripts and stories from some of the best writers around-people like Richard Matheson,Steven King,Harlan Ellison,Arthur C Clarke,Ray Bradbury and Alan Brennert.It has scripts adapted from many published quality stories.This TZ series also had some top movie directors like William Friedkin,Wes Craven,Joe Dante and Jeannot Szwarc.The William Friedkin directed episode ""Nightcrawlers"" was described by one CBS television executive as ""the most intense television he had ever seen"",a very atmospheric episode with brilliant direction.The series starts with the episode ""Shatterday"" which features Bruce Willis in his television debut. Fans with good memories will note that when answering the phone,Bruce says ""is that crazy Willy"",a line that he repeated in the movie ""Armegeddon"".The episode ""Paladin Of The Lost Hour"" features the great classic movie star Danny Kaye in his final performance,and a great acting performance it is. Morgan Freeman also stars in an episode about a men's card game that gets a visit from the devil.Other actors include Oscar winner Martin Landau,Peter Coyote,William Peterson,Elliot Gould and Ben Cross.There is an in joke in one episode,called ""Devils Alphabet"",where Ben Cross(star of the movie Chariots Of Fire)chases a horse drawn coach that is on fire. Obviously,the writers have a sense of humour.This first season also features such actresses as Melinda Dillon(Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind)Dee Wallace Stone(ET),Jenny Agutter(Logans Run),Helen Mirren,Victoria Tennant and Pam Dawber(Mork and Mindy). There are also many Star Trek actors in these Twilight Zone episodes-Jonathon Frakes,Brent Spiner,John de Lancie(from ST:The Next Generation),Andrew Robinson(ST:DS9)and Robert Duncan McNeil(ST:Voyager). Andrew Robinson plays President Kennedy in an eccellent episode called ""Profile In Silver"" which is about a time traveller going back in time to document and film the assassination.This set is in stereo and has 12 commentaries,an interview with director Wes Craven and a photo gallery.

At last, at last, I can retire my ancient Betamax tapings from the TV broadcasts! (Which is a piece of luck, since my Sony Betamax is fading, can't be repaired anymore, and the tapes themselves are showing their age.) I didn't  remember that this revival of the Twilight Zone franchise spanned more than one season, but I will certainly buy any followup to this release, which seems to include many of the favorites I was able to capture on tape all those years ago. (I have since been informed that ""The Toys of Caliban"", a gripping, moving classic, features on Season 2, due for release in June 2005)Unlike later attempts to cash in on the TZ name (beware of the Canadian-produced episodes), this original sequel series holds up to the classic series, and Rod Serling would have been proud of it. There is a tremendous mix of solid scripting and careful performances from a wide range of fine writers and actors; the stories themselves range from the utterly creepy and macabre to the whimsical and fantastical -- pretty much like the original series. There's something for all tastes. And after watching the shows on the first disc alone, I am struck by how poignant many of these are; there's a sad lyricism in the best of these that is incredible for TV programming, of this or any other time.If you are a fan of speculative short fiction, you will appreciate this set. Many thanks to the great Alan Brennert for his review clarifying the matter of picture quality for these DVDs.

I have yet to watch the whole of the series, which I do in fact now own, but from everthing I have seen thus far, the major difference between the original Rod Serling Twilight Zone and even the more recent series from 2000 and this one is that the other two had a host to speak of. Someone to step in-the show was moving along as the events  unfolded but soon enough, from out of nowhere or even perhaps from out of the faceless crowd, the host would appear. Someone to, with an authoratitive hand point out the cast of characters in the play unfolding before us. That is what had always set those series aside. With this particular series though, the Twilight Zone of the 80's, you just don't so far seem to have that. Oh, to be sure it is a good show, really it is, but honestly, twilight zone at this point seems almost tacked on. It could just as well been 'Tales from the Dark Side.' Which in many ways, really is what it feels more like. If anyhthing, some faceless voice is heard from aside to tell you a bit about what happens or to wrap things up, it just doesn't hold the same appeal that made the other two Twilight Zone shows really stand out. I still like is though so far.My only real complaint is trivial at best, the packaging. The disks are held in a series of stacking clear pleastic trays that are bound together by a blue strip of tape, I mean, it works, yes, but if it should tear or something, they would just stack.

I think it is the worst that I have seen on any TV show on DVD.  However, another post on here explains the reason behind the bad quality.  I know that video doesn't hold up well (look at the original TZ episodes shot in video).  But what I do not understand is that All in the Family was shot on video and although it doesn't look great, it looks and sounds much better than this show.  Just curious about why that is.  I can take the grain and the fuzz in the video, but the biggest problem I have is that there are these ""flashes"" that happen after some scene changes (noticed it in the 2nd story of the the first episode).  It usually happens right after a scene change.  I have no idea if this is on all of them, just my set, or if it is my DVD player.The audio is also pretty bad.  I can scarcely make out what is being said.However, I am not whining about these problems.  I would rather have this set and all of its problems than to not have it at all.

863136,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00068NVLQ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[21, 21]","I was really excited to hear that the 1980's version of ""The Twilight Zone"" was coming to DVD. So much so that I didn't read any reviews on it but just ordered it. I remember watching the show living in Los Angeles and reading scripts for Dino DeLaurentiis. It was one of the few shows I looked forward to as a break from digging through the slush pile of movie scripts. With Harlan Ellison (a winner of numerous awards for his fantasy and criticism), Alan Brennert, Rockne O'Bannon (""Farscape""), Phil DeGuere (""Simon and Simon""), James Crocker and other outstanding writers and directors on board, how it could not be a great show?When I watched the first disc I thought the picture quality was acceptable but not as stellar as it could have been. As I jumped around to some of my favorite episodes I was very disappointed to see image quality that suggested it was duped from the original CBS 1 inch VHS cassettes used to broadcast the show. It turns out that the series was the first exclusively edited with effects added on video (much like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). The masters have begun to deteriorate over time so there's been some natural loss of picture quality over time. It seems Image did the best with what they had to work with (which would also explain why, for example, the soundtrack is sometimes in stereo and sometimes in mono. Evidently not all of them were presented that way although I seem to recall them all being presented in stereo).The extras are glorious. We get numerous audio commentaries from writers Alan Brennart, Harlan Ellison, Executive Producer/director/writer Phil DeGuere, Wes Craven and many others that give insight into the production process for the new series. Ellison is both blunt with his criticism and generous with his praise for the episodes he discusses (including ""Shatterday"" which Brennart actually adapted for the show). Ellison gives a great blow-by-blow account of the difficult filming of ""Paladin of the Lost Hour"". The director did such a poor job of shooting the episode (which explains the ""Alan Smithee"" credit) that Ellison, Phil DeGuere and Story Editor/writer Rockne O'Bannon all took a crack at reediting it to make it ""work"". All the commentaries are informative but Ellison's bluntness is, as usual,refreshing.The 15 minute interview with Wes Craven is also quite enlightening in terms of the expectations of CBS (they weren't met which is why the network cancelled the show after the second season and then farmed it out to a Canadian production company to complete the presold syndication package). The good news is that it appears that most of these episodes are uncut and as originally presented. There's also a picture gallery included.The packaging is very good with the DVDs bound in a ""book"" style similar to ""Babylon 5"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"". There's a booklet that gives a brief plot description of each episode, the writer & director and key cast members. The booklet also mentions which ones have audio commentary. Overall, an outstanding season hampered by the poor condition of the masters, this edition of ""The Twilight Zone"" captured much of the spirit of Serling's original show with outstanding scripts by James Crocker, Harlan Ellison, Alan Brennert, Rockne O'Bannon and others. With sharp direction by Wes Craven, Martha Cooldige, Tommy Lee Wallace, B.L. Norton and William Friedkin, the ""Zone"" should have taken off. Unfortunately, the Friday time slot and decreased interest from CBS over time doomed the show.A suggestion to Image is that on future editions to mention that these are taken from the original source tapes and that the picture has deteriorated over time. That would avoid any unrealistic expectations and allow fans of the series to pick up the show for their collection. Regardless, I'm delighted that the show is finally available as this was my favorite era of ""The Twilight Zone"".",5,"Great series, image quality has deteroriated over time",1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3912,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'hear', '1980', 'version', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'was', 'coming', 'DVD', 'So', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'just', 'ordered', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'reading', 'scripts', 'Dino', 'DeLaurentiis', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'looked', 'forward', 'break', 'digging', 'slush', 'pile', 'movie', 'scripts', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'winner', 'numerous', 'awards', 'fantasy', 'criticism', 'Alan', 'Brennert', 'Rockne', ""O'Bannon"", 'Farscape', 'Phil', 'DeGuere', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'James', 'Crocker', 'other', 'outstanding', 'writers', 'directors', 'board', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'show', 'When', 'watched', 'first', 'disc', 'thought', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'acceptable', 'not', 'as', 'stellar', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'jumped', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'see', 'image', 'quality', 'suggested', 'was', 'duped', 'original', 'CBS', '1', 'inch', 'VHS', 'used', 'broadcast', 'show', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'exclusively', 'edited', 'effects', 'added', 'video', 'much', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'masters', 'have', 'begun', 'deteriorate', 'over', 'time', 'been', 'natural', 'loss', 'picture', 'quality', 'time', 'Image', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'would', 'also', 'explain', 'why', 'example', 'soundtrack', 'sometimes', 'stereo', 'sometimes', 'mono', 'Evidently', 'not', 'were', 'presented', 'way', 'seem', 'recall', 'being', 'presented', 'stereo', '.The', 'extras', 'are', 'glorious', 'get', 'numerous', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'writers', 'Alan', 'Brennart', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Executive', 'Producer/director/writer', 'Phil', 'DeGuere', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'many', 'others', 'give', 'insight', 'production', 'process', 'new', 'series', 'Ellison', 'blunt', 'criticism', 'generous', 'praise', 'episodes', 'including', 'Shatterday', 'Brennart', 'actually', 'adapted', 'show', 'Ellison', 'great', 'blow-by-blow', 'account', 'difficult', 'filming', 'Paladin', 'Lost', 'Hour', 'director', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'shooting', 'episode', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'credit', 'Ellison', 'Phil', 'DeGuere', 'Story', 'Editor/writer', 'Rockne', ""O'Bannon"", 'took', 'crack', 'reediting', 'make', 'work', 'commentaries', 'are', 'informative', 'Ellison', 'bluntness', 'usual', 'refreshing.The', '15', 'minute', 'interview', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'also', 'quite', 'enlightening', 'terms', 'expectations', 'CBS', 'were', ""n't"", 'met', 'why', 'network', 'cancelled', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'then', 'farmed', 'out', 'Canadian', 'production', 'company', 'complete', 'presold', 'syndication', 'package', 'good', 'news', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncut', 'originally', 'presented', 'also', 'picture', 'gallery', 'included.The', 'packaging', 'very', 'good', 'DVDs', 'bound', 'book', 'style', 'similar', 'Babylon', '5', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'booklet', 'brief', 'plot', 'description', 'episode', 'writer', 'director', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'booklet', 'also', 'mentions', 'ones', 'have', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Overall', 'outstanding', 'season', 'hampered', 'poor', 'condition', 'masters', 'edition', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'captured', 'much', 'spirit', 'Serling', 'original', 'show', 'outstanding', 'scripts', 'James', 'Crocker', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Alan', 'Brennert', 'Rockne', ""O'Bannon"", 'others', 'sharp', 'direction', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Martha', 'Cooldige', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'B.L', 'Norton', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Zone', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'Unfortunately', 'Friday', 'time', 'slot', 'decreased', 'interest', 'CBS', 'time', 'doomed', 'show.A', 'suggestion', 'Image', 'future', 'editions', 'mention', 'are', 'taken', 'original', 'source', 'tapes', 'picture', 'deteriorated', 'time', 'would', 'avoid', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'allow', 'fans', 'series', 'pick', 'up', 'show', 'collection', 'Regardless', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'show', 'finally', 'available', 'was', 'favorite', 'era', 'Twilight', 'Zone']",The Twilight Zone: Season 1
