1096295,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000USSHZW,AIROLF,"[0, 1]","A fascinating and unique documentary about twins, one gay and one a transgendered. The hardships that both of them have to go through in dealing with life and with developing romantic relationships and friendships with their family and among themselves are worth watching. This movie makes a heterosexual person who is happy in her skin realize how good she has it and how confusing and difficult it is for someone who isn't in today's society. It's impossible to imagine how much harder it must be for a twin, one of a whole to deal with the entire issue. This movie is an interesting study into one's family struggle and the coming of realization that they are a family and the only thing that matters is that they must stick together through better or worse.",3,Compelling and unique,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,761,"['fascinating', 'unique', 'documentary', 'twins', 'one', 'gay', 'one', 'transgendered', 'hardships', 'have', 'go', 'dealing', 'life', 'developing', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'family', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'heterosexual', 'person', 'who', 'happy', 'skin', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'how', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'today', 'society', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'harder', 'must', 'be', 'twin', 'one', 'whole', 'deal', 'entire', 'issue', 'movie', 'interesting', 'study', 'one', 'family', 'struggle', 'coming', 'realization', 'are', 'family', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'must', 'stick', 'together', 'better', 'worse']",Red Without Blue

I ordered it from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed it again.

1096297,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000USSHZW,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[4, 4]","""Red Without Blue"" is a powerful documentary about twins--one is a gay man, the other is transitioning to womanhood. Mark and Alex were incredibly close as children. They had the bond of twins,and still do. Mark faces Alex's transition to Claire with difficulty. He has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that his beloved brother is becoming his sister. There's beautiful music from Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons (Hegarty deems himself transsexual, though he never has had surgery)-The Crying Light,I am a Bird Now,andAntony and the Johnsons. Antony's unearthly, ethereal singing accompanies the documentary. He powerfully sings, ""Today I am a boy, one day I will be a beautiful woman.""""Red without Blue"" also faces darker subjects such as drug addiction and suicide attempts. The twins' parents divorced when they were young. Their mother now lives with another woman who shares her bed, considers her a great friend--but refuses to call herself a lesbian.

1096298,A2HOLM5I1ARX9J,B000USSHZW,"Carol C. ""ccjello""","[2, 3]","This is an oddly fascinating and thought-provoking film that I keep thinking about.  It is about identical twin boys who have an idyllic early childhood in Montana, recognize their homosexuality, grow apart, become rebellious drug abusers as teenagers, attempt a joint suicide, are shipped off to separate boarding schools and denied contact with one another, and later reunite.  As young adults, one of the twins identifies as transgendered, which the other twin reads as a personal rejection, but later comes to understand and support.  The film culminates with Clare's surgery and emergence as a more confident woman, and shows Clare's acceptance as a woman by both her twin and by her parents.  Meanwhile, Mark struggles with finding a positive romantic relationship and preserving that relationship, once found.Okay, that's a lot to pack into one movie, but it never seems over the top, preachy, or overdone.  The characters are all very real -- revealing their frustrations, anger, and vulnerability, as well as their tender sides.  In the beginning, Clare comes across as whiny and self-pitying.  Her twin, Mark, comes across as resentful and a tad self-centered.  Their mother comes across as frustrated and not-wholly-accepting of her son & daughter.  As the characters reveal more of themselves, they all become much more likeable and real.  Clare, in particular, is much more attractive as a person once she settles into her womanhood and Mark is much more likeable once he has accepted Clare as she is.Clare and Mark must be very bright and very talented and somewhat well-off, as they don't appear to face financial struggles (Clare goes to Sarah Lawrence and takes a cab to school each day.  Mark is in art school.)The film is very ""real"" and very ""intimate"" for lack of a better description.  It doesn't appear to be contrived or staged, and much of the camera work is done by Mark & Clare.  It gives you a behind the scenes look at their relationship, their struggles with family and parents and friends, and their personal struggles.  By the end of the film, I found both of the main characters to be intriguing and likeable, and the film leaves me wanting to know more about them and hoping that they find success and happiness in life.",5,absolutely fascinating and thought-provoking,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2254,"['oddly', 'fascinating', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'keep', 'thinking', 'about', 'identical', 'twin', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'idyllic', 'early', 'childhood', 'Montana', 'recognize', 'homosexuality', 'grow', 'apart', 'become', 'rebellious', 'drug', 'abusers', 'teenagers', 'attempt', 'joint', 'suicide', 'are', 'shipped', 'separate', 'boarding', 'schools', 'denied', 'contact', 'one', 'later', 'reunite', 'young', 'adults', 'one', 'twins', 'identifies', 'transgendered', 'other', 'twin', 'reads', 'personal', 'rejection', 'later', 'understand', 'support', 'film', 'Clare', 'surgery', 'emergence', 'more', 'confident', 'woman', 'Clare', 'acceptance', 'woman', 'twin', 'parents', 'Meanwhile', 'Mark', 'finding', 'positive', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'preserving', 'relationship', 'once', 'found.Okay', 'lot', 'pack', 'one', 'movie', 'never', 'top', 'preachy', 'overdone', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'revealing', 'frustrations', 'anger', 'vulnerability', 'as', 'well', 'tender', 'sides', 'beginning', 'Clare', 'whiny', 'self-pitying', 'twin', 'Mark', 'resentful', 'tad', 'self-centered', 'mother', 'frustrated', 'not-wholly-accepting', 'son', 'daughter', 'characters', 'reveal', 'more', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'real', 'Clare', 'particular', 'much', 'more', 'attractive', 'person', 'womanhood', 'Mark', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'once', 'accepted', 'Clare', 'is.Clare', 'Mark', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'bright', 'very', 'talented', 'somewhat', 'well-off', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'face', 'financial', 'struggles', 'Clare', 'Sarah', 'Lawrence', 'cab', 'school', 'day', 'Mark', 'art', 'school', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'intimate', 'lack', 'better', 'description', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'contrived', 'staged', 'much', 'camera', 'work', 'done', 'Mark', 'Clare', 'scenes', 'look', 'relationship', 'struggles', 'family', 'parents', 'friends', 'personal', 'struggles', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'main', 'characters', 'be', 'intriguing', 'likeable', 'film', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'hoping', 'find', 'success', 'happiness', 'life']",Red Without Blue
1096299,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000USSHZW,Jeffery Mingo,"[12, 25]","This documentary focuses on a set of male twins of which one is a gay man and one is a transgendered person.  It offers a very unique situation, but it's the precise rarity of the situation that may distance audiences.  Many viewers may leave this thinking, ""Gee!  I guess my family and I don't have it as badly as I thought.""  I just don't know how many families have both gays and transwomen in them simultaneously.  To the work's credit, the family members evolve and have dynamic changes.David Leavitt has written books on families in which more than one person is gay.  The book ""Mama's Boy"" discusses a divorced mother whose son comes out.  ""Transamerica"" looks at how a transwoman interacts with family members.  Still, I am very concerned that this documentary has no universal themes.  After you see that there's a family much, much different than the 1950s model, then what does the audience do?  One can think, ""That was eye-opening, but now what?""  The work records some of the family's blabbing.  No one says, ""Uhm.  Well.  But."" Still, it sure did feel like it.I hated the way socioeconomic class is left out of the picture.  This family lived in Montana.  How were the son and new daughter able to afford moving to either coast?  Many transpeople have difficulties paying for the desired surgeries.  The cost of that barely comes up at all.  These twins dropped out of high school, how did they get into college and why was there no talk of needing financial aid?  The Brandon Teena tragedy illustrates how not all transpeople have the luxury to move to tolerant cities.  Race is erased here too.  The son gets an Asian or Eurasian boyfriend and the interracial component of their coupling never comes up.  Being male aside, what do the son's relatives think of him dating a man of color?  This family is from Montana, a generally homogenous state very unlike the diverse California.",2,The Specific vs. the General,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,1898,"['documentary', 'focuses', 'set', 'male', 'twins', 'one', 'gay', 'man', 'one', 'transgendered', 'person', 'very', 'unique', 'situation', 'precise', 'rarity', 'situation', 'may', 'distance', 'audiences', 'Many', 'viewers', 'may', 'leave', 'thinking', 'Gee', 'guess', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'badly', 'thought', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'families', 'have', 'gays', 'transwomen', 'simultaneously', 'work', 'credit', 'family', 'members', 'evolve', 'have', 'dynamic', 'changes.David', 'Leavitt', 'written', 'books', 'families', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'gay', 'book', 'Mama', 'Boy', 'divorced', 'mother', 'son', 'out', 'Transamerica', 'how', 'transwoman', 'interacts', 'family', 'members', 'Still', 'am', 'very', 'concerned', 'documentary', 'universal', 'themes', 'see', 'family', 'much', 'much', 'different', '1950s', 'model', 'then', 'what', 'audience', 'do', 'One', 'can', 'think', 'was', 'eye-opening', 'now', 'what', 'work', 'records', 'family', 'blabbing', 'one', 'Uhm', 'Well', 'Still', 'sure', 'did', 'feel', 'it.I', 'hated', 'way', 'socioeconomic', 'class', 'left', 'picture', 'family', 'lived', 'Montana', 'How', 'were', 'son', 'new', 'daughter', 'able', 'afford', 'moving', 'coast', 'Many', 'transpeople', 'have', 'difficulties', 'paying', 'desired', 'surgeries', 'cost', 'barely', 'up', 'twins', 'dropped', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'college', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'talk', 'needing', 'financial', 'aid', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'tragedy', 'how', 'not', 'transpeople', 'have', 'luxury', 'move', 'tolerant', 'cities', 'Race', 'erased', 'here', 'too', 'son', 'Asian', 'Eurasian', 'boyfriend', 'interracial', 'component', 'coupling', 'never', 'up', 'Being', 'male', 'aside', 'what', 'do', 'son', 'relatives', 'think', 'dating', 'man', 'color', 'family', 'Montana', 'generally', 'homogenous', 'state', 'very', 'diverse', 'California']",Red Without Blue
1096300,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000USSHZW,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","""Red Without Blue"" pulls no punches; and I admire that--it grabbed my attention immediately and it never let go until the movie's end. The film is about a seemingly happy family that upon closer inspection and especially through the eyes and story-telling of inseparable identical twins Mark and Alex Farley, disintegrates to the point where the parents divorce, the teens use hard drugs and try to kill themselves and the mother ignores her responsibilities to the point where the twins have to be separated and sent to different boarding schools for troubled youth for two full years.But this is also a poignant, memorable film about identity; and that is what makes it all so fascinating. Alex decides he wants to live life as a woman and his transition from male to female is candid without being preachy or melodramatic. Alex now goes by Clair and it's amazing to see Clair develop into a beautiful young woman with a true sense of confidence. As for Mark, he breaks away from his old identity; he now wants to be called Oliver and establishes a loving relationship with another young man named David. Mark also has the luxury of being able to travel to Prague to study art further while David teaches English in Paris.The parents change, too. Scott and Jennie Farley divorce and Jennie's later relationships with Tim and subsequently Jennifer Jordan are both quite consuming. Nevertheless, I got the strong sense that both parents came to know their children better after Mark evolves into Oliver who is a fine young artist and Clair goes to Sarah Lawrence College. The rest of what happens to both Mark and Clair is best left out here so that you'll have something to look for when  you watch this film!Some will say that the film makes little or no mention of their financial status, or how Oliver's family reacts to him dating and then living with David who is Asian. True, the documentary could have addressed these topics--and more--but the film is so jam packed with details of their raw emotions and incredible, true life stories that to tackle those issues could have been a distraction from the major issues of a family in crisis, individual identities, relationships and people evolving to become happier and much better adjusted individuals.The DVD comes with deleted scenes and commentary from the filmmakers. There are other extras as well.I would highly recommend this film for persons interested in human identity and sexuality with an emphasis on gay and lesbian issues; and anyone studying the issues of transgendered people will find this thought-provoking as well.",5,"poignant, honest and memorable",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2589,"['Red', 'Blue', 'punches', 'admire', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'immediately', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'movie', 'end', 'film', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'family', 'closer', 'inspection', 'especially', 'eyes', 'story-telling', 'inseparable', 'identical', 'twins', 'Mark', 'Alex', 'Farley', 'point', 'where', 'parents', 'divorce', 'teens', 'use', 'hard', 'drugs', 'try', 'kill', 'mother', 'responsibilities', 'point', 'where', 'twins', 'have', 'be', 'separated', 'sent', 'different', 'boarding', 'schools', 'troubled', 'youth', 'two', 'full', 'years.But', 'also', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'film', 'identity', 'what', 'so', 'fascinating', 'Alex', 'live', 'life', 'woman', 'transition', 'male', 'female', 'candid', 'being', 'preachy', 'melodramatic', 'Alex', 'now', 'Clair', 'amazing', 'see', 'Clair', 'develop', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'true', 'sense', 'confidence', 'Mark', 'away', 'old', 'identity', 'now', 'be', 'called', 'Oliver', 'loving', 'relationship', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'David', 'Mark', 'also', 'luxury', 'being', 'able', 'travel', 'Prague', 'study', 'art', 'further', 'David', 'teaches', 'English', 'Paris.The', 'parents', 'change', 'too', 'Scott', 'Jennie', 'Farley', 'divorce', 'Jennie', 'later', 'relationships', 'Tim', 'subsequently', 'Jennifer', 'Jordan', 'are', 'quite', 'consuming', 'Nevertheless', 'got', 'strong', 'sense', 'parents', 'came', 'know', 'children', 'better', 'Mark', 'Oliver', 'who', 'fine', 'young', 'artist', 'Clair', 'Sarah', 'Lawrence', 'College', 'rest', 'what', 'Mark', 'Clair', 'best', 'left', 'out', 'here', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'something', 'look', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'little', 'mention', 'financial', 'status', 'how', 'Oliver', 'family', 'dating', 'then', 'living', 'David', 'who', 'Asian', 'True', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'addressed', 'topics', 'more', 'film', 'so', 'jam', 'packed', 'details', 'raw', 'emotions', 'incredible', 'true', 'life', 'stories', 'tackle', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'distraction', 'major', 'issues', 'family', 'crisis', 'individual', 'identities', 'relationships', 'people', 'evolving', 'become', 'happier', 'much', 'better', 'adjusted', 'individuals.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'other', 'extras', 'well.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'persons', 'interested', 'human', 'identity', 'sexuality', 'emphasis', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'issues', 'anyone', 'studying', 'issues', 'transgendered', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'thought-provoking', 'as', 'well']",Red Without Blue
