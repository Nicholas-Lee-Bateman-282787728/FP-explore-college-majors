375276,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303451454,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/14Rate: 35/14: Boy, Julie Walters in Educating Rita is as comparable as fingernails on a chalkboard. She is very annoying, ingratiating, and plain unlikeable. Rita is, sadly to say, a dime a dozen when it comes to academics, and they never succeed because of their ADD which causes them to be unorganized in so many ways. In short, Rita is not college material. I used to teach physics, and I had a student just like Rita: artistic, witty, idealistic, and, above all, talkative. However, she failed the class every quarter because she was, quite frankly, unfit for academics. And I found her a terrible bore because she had no depth about herself--too many superficial layers with no substance within. On the other hand, Michael Caine is excellent, but I wish he had a better co-star and obviously a better material to work with. Educating Rita is best viewed as College Myth 101. I've been to a lot of colleges and universities, so I desperately for once want to see students lounging on the lawn and either studying or talking about academics. Please...just once. And I desperately want to see a collegiate lecture where everybody is totally engaged and having a lively discourse about whatever the subject is on hand because that never happens either. Oh yes...pretty please...I want to see for once that a freshman student has the privilege of having weekly 1-to-1 lessons with an actual professor as that never happens because the professor's time is way too valuable to waste on such an activity unless the student is shelling tens of thousands of dollars per semester for this. All in all, Educating Rita...nice try, but I don't think so.

Although labeled a romantic comedy I think that this movie is in a class by itself and defies categorization.  I have a definite academic bent and this Oscar nominated, Lewis Gilbert directed, 1983 film still strikes a deep chord though I've watched it over and over.Frank(Michael Caine), a divorced and bored-with-life alcoholic professor, just ""happens"" to be assigned as a personal tutor for the lovely vibrant working-class Rita(Julie Walters).Rita shoots straight from the hip and is so lovely and full of life that she won't take no from Frank and thus starts her subtle metamorphosis from ""uneducated"" to ""educated"".  However, in her process of transition Frank finds that he has created a monster, from his point of view(he refers to Shelley's Frankenstein), as Rita takes on the groomed academic veneer that she so desperately covets and Frank so openly despises.During Rita's ""education"" a love subtly grows between the two and always lurks just below the surface.  Rita is a ""looker"" and her natural beauty coupled with her delightful frankness sparks a constant longing inside of Frank.This DVD begs the question...just what is real education?  Is it the simple mouthing of academic platitudes from a learned and cultivated rote or is it lighting the spark of investigation inside of someone so that they may excel in life, and love?

More than anything she wants to learn, not to put herself above family and friends, but from a desire to know, to see what else there is in the world that she can do and be.Unfortunately, everyone in her life finds the evolving Rita not to their liking, especially her husband.Working and studying and coping with a husband who demands children are not easy for Rita.  Things get particularly tense when the husband finds that she has been taking birth control pills behind his back.  He burns her books (gifts from her tutor, Frank, played by Michael Caine) and her essay and forces her to decide if it's worth the effort after all.  Not wanting to be trapped in a life in which she has never felt that she belongs, she pursues her studies, becoming more alienated in the process.  Only Frank encourages her, in spite of his nearly constant alcoholic haze, and she finds her place among other students and while reading great literature, sometimes with her own quirky interpretations.Even there, however, she doesn't quite fit in.

Julie Walters plays a sassy, street-smart, working-class heroine who is desperate to better herself though has obstacles thrown in her path as her husband fails to share Walters gutsy enthusiasm in making a better life for herself. Michael Caine turns up in one of his greatest roles yet as the drunken teacher who quickly succumbs to Walters down-to-earth charms. There is great feeling between Caine and Walters and both seemingly play off each other. Walters gets to deliver the funniest lines with her sharp, witty outlook on life though is given ample opportunity to display her true powerful range of acting abilities as does Caine. Both put in concentrated performances and approach their roles perfectly. They are given noble support from some fine British actors/esses such as Michael Williams as Brian who is secretly having a sordid affair with Caines wife and Maureen Lipman as the loveably eccentric Trish who's performance is vastly effective.

I watched in deep somber as Micheal Caine formed a woman out of stone.  This is a film closely related to the Pygmalion (sp?) story.  I have learned that fact from a teacher at the college I now attend.  I was once like Rita...common, confused, complacent in the ordinary ways of my limited existence, but my intelligence and desire to refine it slowly bubbled to the top.  This movie is an inspiration to anyone who loves to learn, and to anyone who loves to live.  And it's a beautiful depiction of the life we all find as we venture away from our common surroundings into a world filled with geniuses, charlatans, drunks, dreamers, and institutionalized philistines.  I also love the way Dr. Bryant is influenced and inspired by his pupil, Rita....he moves past his mid life crisis with help from a person who is attempting to overcome the urge to have an early one.  Rita's vibrant and positive attitude drives Dr. Bryant to explore his bottomless pit of despair and alcoholism deeper than ever before(he cannot handle the fact that life is leaving him behind). After he reaches the bottom, (and is looked down upon harshly by his colleages) he receives a new chance to start a bright life in Australia....he too eventually moves past the common complacency he had sunk into.

375298,A17BUUBOU0598B,6303451454,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","Educating Ritais a funny and enjoyable movie that is difficult to classify. On the one hand, this is definitely light-hearted fare that tries not to take anything too seriously. Yet on the other hand, this is really good! I am not sure if one could call this a masterpiece per se.  But if it isn't a masterpiece it's pretty darned close to one. This is the most fun movie I've seen in a long time.The CastThe cast members of this movie deserve special mention because they really are the difference maker.  Michael Caine is very good as the professor, which is not surprising considering his track record.But Julie Walters as Rita steals every scene.  Her boisterous personality is endearing and amusing. It is a perfect complement to his mostly conventional performance.  It's even more impressive considering her prior experience was mostly in the theatre.  Indeed, that year she was nominated for the BAFTA award for ""Most Outstanding Newcomer To Film.""I have also seen other films with Julie Walters where she doesn't have *the accent.* Her cockney accent in this film is almost a character in and of itself.  It's very effective in creating a sense of her character as a free-spirited and salt-of-the-earth personality.  And it also makes some of her simple lines very funny.Incidentally, in 1984 this pair were each nominated for best actor and best actress awards by the Academy.  While neither won the Oscar, they each won the respective Golden Globe and BAFTA awards.  Of course, it would have been quite a coup to win the Oscar in that year, since they were each up against Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine for their incredible performances inTerms of Endearment, another great picture.  I am glad I didn't have to cast the vote in that year, considering what a difficult choice it would have been to make.Even if the entire cast consisted of those two alone, this would be an award worthy performance.  But the additional supporting cast is also good, though they can't stand out from the shadows of those two.The Story and the ScriptSpeaking of awards, Willy Russell was also nominated for Best Screenplay, Adaptation.  Once again,Terms of Endearmenttook the Oscar in that category but ""Educating Rita"" was nominated by every significant awards organization.While I won't comment on the worth of the adaptation versus the original, the script does follow that common formula ofPygmalion, where a woman is taken under the wing of a man in the attempt to ""civilize"" her.  Yet in his role as teacher, Caine's character is quickly bested by Rita.  It appears that he is the one who has much to learn from her.Most of the beauty in the screenwriting is found in the sharp and witty dialogue shared by this pair.  The writing is indeed intimate and effective.  I often found myself laughing unexpectedly.While the plot itself must to a degree be described as ""predictable,"" the artful way the story is developed is definitely the hallmark of good writing and direction.ConclusionThis film is a beautiful and funny statement on life and personal growth.  The dialogue will make you laugh, the performances will leave you in awe and the total result will make you want to watch this one again and again.  I highly recommend this movie for all those who haven't seen it yet.Enjoy!",4,Rita As Student And Teacher,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,3286,"['Educating', 'Ritais', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'difficult', 'classify', 'one', 'hand', 'definitely', 'light-hearted', 'fare', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'too', 'seriously', 'other', 'hand', 'really', 'good', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'se', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'pretty', 'darned', 'close', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'CastThe', 'cast', 'members', 'movie', 'deserve', 'special', 'mention', 'really', 'are', 'difference', 'maker', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'very', 'good', 'professor', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'track', 'record.But', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Rita', 'steals', 'scene', 'boisterous', 'personality', 'endearing', 'amusing', 'perfect', 'complement', 'mostly', 'conventional', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'considering', 'prior', 'experience', 'was', 'mostly', 'theatre', 'Indeed', 'year', 'was', 'nominated', 'BAFTA', 'award', 'Most', 'Outstanding', 'Newcomer', 'Film', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', '*the', 'accent', '*', 'Her', 'cockney', 'accent', 'film', 'almost', 'character', 'very', 'effective', 'creating', 'sense', 'character', 'free-spirited', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'personality', 'also', 'simple', 'lines', 'very', 'funny.Incidentally', '1984', 'pair', 'were', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'actress', 'awards', 'Academy', 'won', 'Oscar', 'won', 'respective', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'BAFTA', 'awards', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'coup', 'win', 'Oscar', 'year', 'were', 'up', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'incredible', 'performances', 'inTerms', 'Endearment', 'great', 'picture', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cast', 'vote', 'year', 'considering', 'what', 'difficult', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'make.Even', 'entire', 'cast', 'consisted', 'two', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'additional', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'shadows', 'two.The', 'Story', 'ScriptSpeaking', 'awards', 'Willy', 'Russell', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Adaptation', 'Once', 'again', 'Terms', 'Endearmenttook', 'Oscar', 'category', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'was', 'nominated', 'significant', 'awards', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'worth', 'adaptation', 'original', 'script', 'follow', 'common', 'formula', 'ofPygmalion', 'where', 'woman', 'taken', 'wing', 'man', 'attempt', 'civilize', 'role', 'teacher', 'Caine', 'character', 'quickly', 'bested', 'Rita', 'one', 'who', 'much', 'learn', 'her.Most', 'beauty', 'screenwriting', 'found', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'shared', 'pair', 'writing', 'indeed', 'intimate', 'effective', 'often', 'found', 'laughing', 'plot', 'must', 'degree', 'be', 'described', 'predictable', 'artful', 'way', 'story', 'developed', 'definitely', 'hallmark', 'good', 'writing', 'direction.ConclusionThis', 'film', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'statement', 'life', 'personal', 'growth', 'dialogue', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'performances', 'will', 'leave', 'awe', 'total', 'result', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet.Enjoy']",N/A

375302,A376UHS8GODI8W,6303451454,Patrick Selitrenny,"[2, 2]","This is a very enjoyable comedy and Michael Caine has an odd presence here.What happens when a working class ""babe"" decides to go back to school and make a culture for herself and meets a disillusioned and highly drunk literature professor, meant to tutor her in this endeavor?This is just the premise of this little comedy.What else is there? Well, the fact that two worlds, at the opposite to each other start to merge through two completely different people.Like Tom and Jerry, Tweety and Sylvester, this is truly a Cat and Mouse game.But who is the cat and who, the mouse?Even better would be the comparison with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.What's up Doc?For American audiences it may be a bit difficult to understand, since Julie Walters plays in a rather tight British local accent, but the storyline is so well written, that the action alone flaws smoothly and is very understandable.Earlier, I said that Michael Caine plays an odd role. What I mean by that, is that until this picture was shot, he had always played ordinary people, such like in ""Alfie"", ""Get Carter"", ""The Italian Job"" etc.In this one he was making a leap forward, in quality and in skills.By the way, he plays a wonderful ""sober"" drunk.The entire story is a close parallel to ""Pygmalion"" by George Bernard Shaw. The only difference is that it was quite updated, and while Professor Henry Higgins, would never truly mingle and socialize with members of the working class (it wouldn't even cross his mind to abase himself in doing so), our modern Henry Higgins does it.But not enough. While Eliza Dolittle in Pygmalion, ""serves and adores"" the Professor, the modern version is far more pragmatic and while she too admires the Professor, she quickly realizes that he is just a wreck and needs a touch of reality in his life.The entire picture is a delight, with bitter-sweet moments at times, but very hilarious moments throughout.The transfer in High Definition restores the picture to its original splendor, which even in theaters was never that brilliant. The sound is nothing special, being in plain two-channel Mono, but the dialogues are clear, and since the lines in such a picture are the most important element, this is fair enough.If you want to watch a true odd couple in action, then Michael Caine and Julie Walters are the couple you want.I can truly recommend it.

Michael Caine is, well, Michael Caine, playing a role here that could have been written for him.  The other characters are also well cast, even though they have relatively little screen time.  The movie does have something of the feel of a stage play, but the director keeps it from feeling claustrophobic by inserting some beautiful outdoor sequences that fit well with the story and also open things up a bit.  The soundtrack is really the only thing about the film that seems dated;  all of the music is done with s synthesizer, which at the time of the film's release was probably considered quite trendy, but now just sounds sort of cheesy.  However, once you get used to it, you forget about it and it does not interfere with enjoying the film.The video transfer is simply not up to today's standards, with a washed-out image that I do not recall noticing even when I watched it on HBO years ago. It looks to me as if nothing at all was done to clean the image up before the transfer was made.There are no extras at all, which is unfortunate.

375308,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6303451454,Shashank Tripathi,"[19, 19]","""Educating Rita"", directed by Lewis Gilbert, is an overlooked gem of a film. Based on a London stage play, ""Educating Rita"" (a copy of which is sold by Amazon.co.uk for those who are interested) is the story of a 27-year old middle class London hairdresser/housewife (Julie Walters, in a convincing, touching performance) who, before having children, would like very much to learn about herself. Much to the annoyance of her husband, she enrolls in an ""open university"" literature course to begin her journey (open university is the British term for college night courses). Assigned as her tutor is Frank (Michael Caine, in his deservedly award-winning role), an older literature professor who suffers from low self esteem and has his own relationship problems.But no, this movie is not what you would ""typically"" expect that storyline to be like. The feel of the movie is very play like -- fans of Glengarry or Death of a Salesman or movies of such ilk would immediately identify.Had this film been made in the glam throes of Hollywood, Rita and Frank would have hit the sack within two scenes of meeting each other (and it would have been graphic, of course), then realized they were in love, followed by the inevitable obstacle to their relationship (probably a misunderstanding or rival for affections), finally ending up with them overcoming all. Every character and plot point would have been telegraphed well in advance. ""Educating Rita"" does none of this. There are no graphic sex scenes (or any sex scenes for that matter), no grand pronouncements of love, no cliche cliffhangers or deaths in icy seas. Instead, the story portrays Rita and Frank in a very realistic, human manner. As the story unfolds, we watch as they grow as individuals which causes their friendship to become richer. There are turns to the plot which are unexpected. I will not divulge what the end result is, as it is very unconventional and is sure to bring a lump to the throat of any romantic.Quite simply, ""Educating Rita"" is a very overlooked excellent character study framed by a wonderful story.
