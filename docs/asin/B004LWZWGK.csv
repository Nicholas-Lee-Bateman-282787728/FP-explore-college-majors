1418671,A2RFK1JEOAUQMB,B004LWZWGK,"Aaron Mills "".""","[4, 11]","Batman Begins & The Dark Knight were good for what they are. However, the Dark Knight Rises is dull & dumb movie to watch with it's collection of plot holes & bad directing decisions. It left me with many unanswered questions seen below?What's with all the horrible sound quality? Sometimes, this film is louder than most anyone can possible be. Sometimes, this film is so low that your own thoughts seem to sound louder than this film.What Happened to the Joker?Why did the director think this was a good idea to make Batman basically handy capped (...seriously)? Batman has trouble fighting because of an apparent bad leg (possibly an injury from fighting the Joker in the last film). Even with a new robotic brace helps Batman move his leg, Batman still has trouble doing much anything in general. Bruce also looks like he didn't aged at all after the last film, but the plot description for this film says that this movie (The Dark Knight Rises) is apparently set 8 years after the last Batman movie (the first Dark Knight) that Batman is kicking so much butt in.Why is the fighting of this movie so bad & almost non-existent in general?Why was Bruce (Batman) and Selina's (CatWoman's) love so randomly and quickly formed?Why didn't they ever call Selina Kyle, &#34;CatWoman?&#34;Why doesn't Bane take the Venom drug or anything like it to gain superhuman strength (and therefore has no real powers)?Why is Bane have a new big weak spot  (His own entire head)? Bane's mask holds together much of his head which prevents Bane from otherwise feeling much extreme pain and possibly dying. Destroying the mask means destroying Bane.Why does Bane talk with that rediculous voice? Truthfully, Bane's silly voice takes away from Bane's sense of being scary or dangerous. Bane talks like an old dork trying to badly sound like Sean Connery doing German accent and failing at the impression. Also, Bane is lame next to the Joker of this series (R.I.P. Heath Ledger).Why is Robin a cop named Blake?How does Blake figure out Batman's identity at all?Why doesn't Blake become Robin in the middle or throughout the movie?What's with all the tacked-on orphan stuff?Why is Bruce's place turned into an orphanage?Also, is the director trying to say that Robin is going to replace Batman entirely as the hero of Gotham with this movie's ending?Why did Bruce change his mind about not wanting to have any partners (like Catwoman & Blake aka Robin)?Why did I waste 2 hours & 44 minutes of my life watching this slow & crappy movie?What Happened? This movies seems to be made by a different studio. That may have something to do with it, but Christopher Nolan still directed all 3 films (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight & this film, The Dark Knight Rises).In any case, The Dark Knight Rises was a horrible Batman movie. It's plot is basically a very lacking & poorly written version of the plot from the Batman game, Arkham City (available for PlayStation 3 and X-Box 360). It's full of plot holes & is just annoying to watch.Get the first 2 Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan. Don't even waste you time with the third film.

nothing less than the second coming wont do.thats what happened here.there were a lot of unexplained things too.i had more questions than answers by the end of the movie.another thing that always gets under my skin is when super hero movies dont follow the comic books.and,lets face it,they hardly ever do.this movie had a number of mistakes.and there were a few things that were hard to believe.i mean i realize this is a fantasy movie but still.some of the special effects werent very special.banes voice sounded creepy and was kind of high for a steroid  monster.now onto the good stuff.there was some better than average action.the cat woman finaly got to kick some tail after being in 3 movies.lucius fox got to stay on.there were parts of the story that were epic in scope.the new bane was interesting as compared to the old one.the new cat woman was as well.lets compare.this is the 8th batman movie.i'd say its better than the one from the 60's as its not so silly.i did not like it better than the tim burton ""batman"" movie from 1989 with jack nicholson as the joker.it was comparable to ""batman returns"" but i think this new one edges it out due to better tech.but i like the michelle phieffer cat woman better.sexier and crazy.then there was ""batman forever"".i loved the riddler in this one but 2 face was mildly interesting and robin was a little punk.so ""rise"" beats that one out too.that was the tim burton trilogy.then there  was ""batman and robin"".it was really ,really silly.there were bad puns throughout and george clooney was not a very good batman.batgirl,while hot,was  crabby all the time.so ""rise' beats it too.then we get up to the current trilogy.the other 2,especialy ""dark knight"" beat this one,hands down.so ,out of 8,i like this movie 4th best.i definately recommend this movie to batman and super hero fans.and i would go see it if i were simply an action or sci fi guy also.heck,theres even a bit of drama and romance too.its

1418681,A1NMHU4RJZO1GW,B004LWZWGK,A. Hollett,"[15, 49]","Let me begin by saying this movie had some very big cinimatic shoes to fill after following The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight Rises isn't worthy to even polish the shoes of its predecessor. Be aware, this review contains spoliers.So, TDKR takes place 8 years after the conclusion of TDK, and apparently Bruce Wayne/Batman has become one of the wimpiest crime fighters in the DC universe. First of all, the Batman that all the fans throughout the history of the mythos know that Batman never quits, ever. Yet, because Harvey Dent died, his wanna-be girlfriend died, and Batman needs to be viewed as the bad guy to preserve Harvey's image, he quits. I was actually expecting that Batman would still be at work fighting crime from within the shadows and avoiding being caught by a police force that had been turned against him. Nope, Batman just wussed out like a child and quit. We as the audience are made to believe that the events of TDK and the ""Harvey Dent Law"", which incidently is never actually explained, have brought about a new age of peace and prosperity in Gotham. Now, I actually have no problem with this concept. It's actually nice to hear that the work Harvey Dent, James Gordon, and Batman paid off and that things are going right in Gotham. The problem I have is that instead of taking this positive turn of events and utilizing it to do great things with his company, Bruce Wayne pretty much dumps everything he has into an energy product that he's so sure will be weaponized he has placed it under the Gotham river with a flooding emergency protocol. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie, not about the dangers the people and the city faces, but the fact that this is such a wide and horrible departure from the Batman mythos that I honestly don't see how the film company can call this a Batman movie with a straight face. As many others have said, Batman himself (not Bruce Wayne) is only in the movie for maybe 25 minutes. You can't make an ""epic"" about a superhero and not have said superhero being in the majority of the film. There are also huge plot holes and completely unexplained events that seem to just been thrown in just for dramatic effect without a care about whether or not they actually belonged in the plot or story.Let's start with the ""star"" himself, Batman/Bruce Wayne. First of all, why is this man suddenly a cripple when in the previous two movies there was no indication of such severe injury? He supposedly retired immediately after the closing of TDK, so how did he become so injured the man could barely walk? Next, let's examine the fact that Batman as presented by Christopher Nolon in no way seemed to ever represent Batman in all of the wide and varied mythos of the culture. I will freely admit that I was never a fan of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, particularly Batman, and it's possible that his ability to embrace the character had something to do with this, particularly his choice of voice when in the Batman persona. Whatever the reasons, from Batman Begins all the way through The Dark Knight Rises, not once did I see more than the barest glimpse of what Batman truly is. In every version of him, save for Christopher Nolan's series, Batman has been presented as someone who is highly intelligent, physically superior, and a very skilled investigator. Indeed, Batman himself in all other forms of media is said to possess genius-level intelligence, is a master of subterfuge/espionage, is a master of multiple fighting styles, and has an investigative skill-set that would leave all three CSI shows choking on dust even if they all joined forces. Not once did I see this in any of Nolan's movies. Oh sure, he did a tiny bit of ballistics in TDK, but that was it. His fighting in Nolan's movies was utterly pathetic. Batman is supposed to be an extremely strong and acrobatic fighter who has mastered numerous martial arts, yet all he seems to really do in Nolan's movies is box with an occasional kick thrown in. I can appreciate that the man is wearing armor, but make some adjustments to it to allow for a more fluid fighting style. From the scenes in the beginning of Batman Begins, it's clear that Bale has the physicallity for martial arts, but never presents that when wearing the costume. He was also never presented as utilizing his various tools during combat. Batman's fighting style often incorperated use of various weapons such as the batarang, smoke pellets, caltrops, grapple lines, etc., yet we never see that really in any movie. There's a great deal more, but I'll move on to other aspects of this movie.There is a great deal of problems with this movie other than Batman himself, so I'll try to limit my comments to the really bad ones. First of all, let's look at the idiocy of those in positions of authority with the GPD. In what alternate universe would any police commander or commissioner think that it's a good idea to send practically every single police officer into the sewers to look for a bad guy? This decision had me practically shedding tears for Gary Oldman. In the first two movies, he gave the character of James Gordon a strong, intelligent persona with a good head on his shoulders and a damn fine police officer/comissioner. Whoever the writer for TDKR were, they and Nolan took that image and flushed it down the toilet to be replaced by some completely clueless character that seemed to have absolutely no clue what it mean to run a police force. Second of all, with the demise of Bruce Wayne via the theft of his fingerprints and the subsequent use of them to tank his company via the stock exchange that, gasp, Bane just coincidently exploded into that very day. And we as the audience are expected to believe that such events wouldn't just flat out shut the stock exchange down and such a shocking use of the exchange wouldn't be investigated? Oh yes, and let's not forget that the event that perpetrated this outrageous event, the theft of the fingerprints by Selina Kyle, was essentially ignored despite the fact that Bruce Wayne knew that his prints had been stolen. Batman is the kind of character that he has backups for backups and backups for those backups and so on. TDKR truly dumbed him down. Now let's examine the whole blowing up of the city by Bane. So, Bane sets off a series of massive explosions in the city, destroys all by one access out of the city, and declares that Gotham should be taken back by the people. So we are supposed to believe that regular people would, in a matter of moments, suddenly become violent outlaws that turn against the rich. People here have remarked on hiw this was clearly an omage to Occupy Wall Street and I can't disagree with that. What bothers me is that Nolan decided that an entire city population would happily do as Bane suggested, even after the man just BLEW UP THEIR CITY! Yes, this makes perfect sense to me, what sane person wouldn't eagerly follow advice of anarchy from a madman who just blew up their home without a care about the thousands of people he just killed.On a side note, people have been blasting the movie for the 5-6 month length of time when the bomb degraded and Batman was in that prison. Honestly, I see what the movie people were trying to do with this part of the story. The concept was that Bruce Wayne would be stuck in that prison and that he would be helpless to do anything other than watch his city fall into decline and anarchy on the television before the nuke finally wiped the entire city from the map. It was supposed to be torture for Bruce, seeing his city and home fall into such a state of hell before being destroyed and knowing there was absolutely nothing he could do to prevent it.Let's skip ahead to one of the worst endings for Batman ever. Once again, we're supposed to believe that his commitment to being Batman was so weak that he was perfectly happy faking his own death and moving to Europe to live happily every after with Selina Kyle while bequeathing his batcave to some rookie cop with a stupid Robin tie-in to take up the mantle? All this does is cheapen Bruce Wayne/Batman's commitment to protect his city and its people. In the end, with this movie, it seems like he doesn't even care anymore. You think after all of the insanity that the city just went through there wouldn't be a need for Batman in rebuilding it?Like I said, there is a tremendous amount of things that went horribly wrong with this movie, and many people have already discussed them, so I'll leave them be. I will conclude by saying, as a great fan of Batman in various media forms, I thought this movie was utterly horrible and quite frankly a grevious insult to the Batman mythos that can never be

It has a few moments of interest but otherwise demonstrates how a film maker believes that the bloviating dialogue of secondary characters can carry a movie. I've already taken the chore on, but if one wants to sit back and watch nearly the entire Batman cast fill in non action actions scenes talking repeatedly about ""the bomb"" and what it can do, and how it will hurt people, have at it. Would you watch this film again and again? Obviously many will (and have), but I have to wonder if it is just false praise because of the affinity we have for the Batman character. This is a boring movie, period. Sure there are action scenes but they are not well presented, and I could care less about them without a cohesive and thrill inducing story.Catwomen who's name we are to secretly know through pure inference was sexy looking but dull. Her mask was bogus and added nothing to the character. Again with sequence after sequence of cut/chop fight shots that I've seen adinfinitum (even much better) in low budget martial arts films. This was a disappointing Catwomen who I'm sure advocates of the film will say was unique and introspective. Uh, no, I was just waiting for her to ""come alive"". I like live action comic book characters, not costume rote lined bores.When it comes to Bane, he definitely projected awesome terror but his words dragged on. In addition, many liberties can be taken with comic book characters but Batman recovered way too fast from his injuries, especially a near broken spine.I think this film like the second Nolan Batman film  relied heavily on empty chitter -chatter. Words that ended up meaning nothing and scenes that labored on to no exciting purpose. It's great to see one of my favorite DC superheroes taking it to the criminals with a cool costume and bat-weaponry, it's a shame you must endure an act of drudgery to get to the few decent scenes of a big screen Batman. The Dark Knight Rises is a failure.

The acting is good, but the cat-woman character seems random and probably could have been written out of the script, or at least her story could have been expanded so it has a point.

It worked well as a book-end to the trilogy. It felt forced.The performances were excellent. Anne Hathaway as Selena the Cat Woman. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake, Michael Caine, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman and so on.The last 30 minutes were just fantastic, worth the previous two-plus hour wait. Better than the Batman Begins but fell short of Heath Ledger's Dark Knight (could that movie been as good without him?).Overall I think it suffered from being too grandiose by trying to do too much. The multiple acts didn't click together as they did in The Dark Knight. The suspension of disbelief was less ""suspended"" than utterly confounded ... how did Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) go from emaciated cripple to muscle-bound butt-kicker in one day?&lt;And the finale, while enjoyable, had so many twists and conveniences it would have made my head spin if I wasn't enjoying it so much.To be fair, I think the best way to judge The Dark Knight Rises is as an attempt to close an epic story-line with a focus on continuity between the three films, reinforcing Nolan's conflicting ""hopeful nihilism"" philosophy.

1418724,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B004LWZWGK,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[3, 5]","It has been eight years since the Batman took the wrap for the murder of District Attorney Harvey Dent. Eight years since the last time the Dark Knight was spotted in Gotham. The streets are safe, the police are receiving praise for doing a good job--except Commissioner James Gordon knows it's all based on a lie. About to come clean of what really happened that fateful night, Gotham is suddenly thrown into chaos at the hands of a mastermind, muscle-loaded criminal named Bane. With the city about to fall, the Batman must return to restore order to his beloved city otherwise it will fall into the hands of a sadistic genius bent on its destruction. To complicate matters, a mysterious female cat burglar is working out an agenda of her own and her endgame is tied into the legacy of Bruce Wayne.Will Batman rise from the shadows to defeat evil once more, or has he had his day and should have stayed in the dark?Saw the midnight screening of this gem before it hit theatres all over the world. This movie is epic on a scale that is hard to fit into a simple review, especially since I don't want to give away any key plot points and/or spoilers.The Dark Knight Rises picks up immediately after The Dark Knight storyline-wise, and eight years later in movie-time. Running throughout the whole flick are threads from Batman Begins and Dark Knight, plotlines that reach their ultimate climax in what I have to say is one of the best endings to a trilogy I've ever seen. It's on par with, third-movie-wise, Return of the Jedi and Return of the King. All comes to a head as we're led down a deep tunnel into who Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) truly is and what being Batman has done to him. Glimpses of his scarred psyche were hinted at in the previous two movies, but really get hit home in an emotional and powerful way throughout this final installment.Batman himself also shines as he gets to show off his physical skill against a villain that can truly stand toe-to-toe with him, something we never saw in the previous two films. The battle with Bane (Tom Hardy) is realistic, strongly-delivered, and one where this reviewer felt the punches thrown as if it was happening to him. Yeah, it was that good of a fight.The other Bat-flicks struggled with having two villains in the same movie. To be honest, I never thought I'd see the day where a superhero movie would have more than one villain and be just as good of a movie as if it had just one. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is the best rendition of the character I've seen on screen, both in movies and on TV. She had to play multiple roles given her identity as a thief and work her deception in such a way that a lot of the time we weren't sure who's side she was on. I'm an Anne Hathaway fan, but this movie easily contains her best career performance to date.Bane was a crazy good villain, a kind of cross between Joker--intelligence-wise--and Ra's Al Ghul--combat-wise--of the previous two movies. Especially since most of his face was covered with a mask throughout the whole flick, Tom Hardy had to act with his eyes in such a way as to deliver a performance as if he wasn't wearing a mask at all. It was something he did in spades. Bane was one of those on-screen villains that you were afraid of because he's that smart and that powerful and that sadistic.Gary Oldman did an amazing job, as usual, as Jim Gordon, and Sir Michael Caine nailed it once again as Alfred. In fact, I'd be shocked if Sir Michael didn't get an Oscar nomination for his emotional portrayal of a hard-headed vigilante's butler.It'd be so easy to give away several key plot points in this review, but I'm keeping it vague on purpose because you simply need to see this movie for yourself. You might think you have it figured out, but you'd be wrong, my friend.All dangling story threads from the previous two movies are resolved, the SFX did its job but the movie didn't rely on it, and The Dark Knight Rises had one of the best movie endings in history, to me, one equal to the incredibly-satisfying ending of The Shawshank Redemption.Hats off to director Christopher Nolan and crew for the amazing stories and respect they delivered to Bat-fans everywhere throughout the entire Dark Knight Trilogy.Good watch Batman.

Christopher Nolan concludes the trilogy with perfect thoroughness and yet makes you think at what you had just seen after you've left the theater. Nolan throws curve balls galore throughout this film, and I actually gasped in awe and excitement at a few particular moments that would be blasphemy if I told you.Taking place 8 years since the events in ""The Dark Knight."" Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)is a broken recluse, taken care of by maids and hobbling along on his cane, he has put the Batman behind. Until Bane arrives(Tom Hardy),with an army and as the current leader of ""The League Of Shadows"" to finish what Ra's Al Ghul(Liam Neeson)failed to do in ""Batman Begins.""Bane is a monstrous brute, a man born in the darkness and destined to burn Gotham to the ground, releasing all criminals from Blackgate Prison and trapping the city's police force underground. But where is Batman?After an epic battle between Batman and Bane, Bruce ends up defeated and placed in the bowels of a Ukrainian underground prison, body broken, while Gotham citizens are unprotected by the anarchy and under the watch of Bane.Will Bruce ""rise"" one last time, and will ""Catwoman""(Anne Hathoway)quit her clepto ways and help Batman? And who is this Lt.Blake(Joseph-Gordan Levitt)and why does he know Bruce so well?Solid performances from everyone, and surprisingly Tom Hardy himself, who played Bane. His face is never seen, but his eyes and menacing tone made me shiver. The new ""Bat"" toy is pretty damn sweet. Of course Anne looked stunning as Catwoman, but I wish she had more screen time.As always, Nolan doesn't just make superhero action movies, he makes films. Lots of emotion in this film, which even had, IMO, an ""Inception"" like ending, making you wonder, Is that? That's Not? Could it be?  And that is the splendor of a Nolan film. Easily the best superhero movie ever, which was ""The Avengers"" until now.Nathan Cranes(Cillian Murphy) appearance as a judge of the citizens was a perfect addition to the insanity of the character and the situation. Very humorous and dark, it reminded me of Frank Millers Batman.And thank you Christopher Nolan and everyone involved in the making of the greatest hero trilogy of all time.

Martin,"[0, 0]","The Dark Knight Rises marks the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's ambitious and compelling Dark Knight Trilogy and it delivers the goods as a complex and troubling examinaton of conflicted heroes, corrupt legal and political systems and societal breakdown.  That it is able to accomplish this in the guise of an entertaining summer action flick is all the more remarkable.  Some have felt let down by this final installment and comparisons to its predecessor have been inevitable, but Rises is its own film.  It is as different from The Dark Knight as Knight was from Batman Begins.  Yet it ultimately ties in beautifully to the overall themes of the trilogy as a whole and is as much a part of the other films as it is a separate and uinque entity.Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham is enjoying an unprecedented era of low crime rates and prosperity.  The death of Harvey Dent galvanized politicians, lawmakers and citizens and paved the way for passage of The Dent Act which gave lawmakers added heft in the war on crime.  Yet Gotham's new found security is based on a lie that has nearly consumed the souls of the men who carry it.  Commissioner Gordon struggles with whether or not to finally reveal the truth to the people about who Dent really was.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has secluded himself in Wayne Manor to nurse his physical and psychological wounds.Wayne is drawn out of the shadows after an encounter with Selena Kyle, a jewel thief who is trying to swipe a pearl necklace from his safe.  Selena draws Wayne out into the open again and ultimately into the clutches of Bane, a beefy brawler who is building an army below the city streets.  Bane is determined to bring Gotham to its collective knees and Wayne is an integral part of his end game.  Bane has been compared to Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight, but that's a bit unfair.  Bane is no Joker, to be certain, but he's not supposed to be.  The Joker was an unhinged mad man who wanted to wreak as much havoc as possible while Bane has a more focused plan and is a bigger picture type of villian.I won't go into too much detail about the events that unfold as Bane works to destroy Batman and his beloved city since that information is so vital to the overall viewing experience.  Just know that TDKR is full of breathtaking action, amazing set pieces, social and political commentary and most importantly, hope.  The hope that heores can come from anywhere and be anyone and the hope that no civilization is beyond saving, and no individual is beyond redemption.

1418769,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B004LWZWGK,Brian Driver,"[4, 7]",".AS ALWAYS, NO SPOILERS HERE:How difficult must it have been for Christopher Nolan to have put together this movie?  With such lofty hopes (and $$) placed upon his shoulders, such fan expectations?  And then, to have had the terrible tragedy attached to its premiere...""The Dark Knight Rises"" really had a mountain to climb in order to even come close to pleasing the general public.And, the verdict?Here it is: ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is absolutely amazing.  I loved this movie, and consider it a remarkable achievement.  Sure...there were a few faults with it (and I'll address them in a few paragraphs) but all in all Nolan has provided us with not only a great adventure and a dramatically compelling storyline, but also a fitting ending to Nolan's trilogy.  It is a graphic novel with real gravitas, a fully considered finale to a sweeping epic.And DON'T WORRY, I will NOT include any spoilers as I discuss it.First of all: you should know what kind of movie you're going to see.  For those about to leave home to plop themselves down in a (hopefully) comfortable movie theater, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not ""The Avengers""...for good reason.  While the latter film is all action, action, action from the get-go, ""TDKR"" is much more drama-oriented.I've heard some complaints from people who said it was too slow, or too long, and this equated to boredom.  However, I think they simply didn't realize that Christopher Nolan is a serious director, and wanted to tell a ""real"" and serious story, not just create a typical pop comic strip in film format.  This is not to knock ""The Avengers""--I think it's one terrific movie, one of the best I've seen in recent years.  Of its type.The beauty of ""TDKR"" and its predecessors is that Nolan and his brother Jonathan have created a three-story arc that sets a tale into motion, full of backstory and motivation, progresses that narrative through an exciting and sweeping character-driven tale that questions not only the ethics and morality of a single, powerful law officer, but then examines what outcome such an iconic man might expect.IF HE WERE REAL, in other words, what toll would crime-fighting take upon such a figurehead, especially given the motivations of those who chose to battle him, and how might a man of Batman's stature hope to conclude such an occupation""?  He couldn't expect to go on forever--so how might his story be resolved?In other words, this is not your grand-daddy's Batman who just went on forever, dispatching foes by the end of every comic book.  Nor is this even the movie begun under Tim Burton's initially competent hand, unfortunately fizzling out and all but sent to the death chamber under the inept Joel Schumacher (""Batman Beyond"").No, ""TDKR"" is a real and plausible third and final chapter for this particular Batman legend --and please note that I am leaving the ending completely open to all possibilities.  I am only saying that Nolan is done; he is not coming back and he has fashioned his film in this manner.Okay: ""TDKR"" is not a perfect movie, as there were some rough edges in the story-telling.  For one thing, the time scale seemed off as the story progressed from Bane's takeover of Gotham City and neared its end...you weren't prepped as to when weeks between scenes switched into hours and then into minutes.  And certain developments weren't clear, either: where was Batman placed after his first entanglement with Bane?  And in this post-revolution city, which police officers were imprisoned and which weren't--and how did those who weren't stay out of the jailors' reach?Some of these questions will probably be resolved for me upon further viewings...and I do plan to see this film over and over again.  As with other really good movies, one can expect to see deeper and deeper levels every time they watch.  Christopher Nolan is one of those directors, and he populates his movies with all sorts of important dramatic planes that bear up to more intense scrutiny, allowing the movie to evolve from one viewing to another.As one might be able to tell from this review, I am a huge fan of Nolan's, and have followed him from his beginning in, well, ""Following,"" as atypical a movie as one might find, perhaps with the exception of ""Memento,"" his next one, which is told in reverse order.  In and around the Batman tales, he has also directed ""Insomnia,"" ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception,"" which are no slouches as films, either.  (Incidentally, he and screenwriter David S. Goyer are the writers of the next ""Superman"" movie, due out next year.)I hope this year Nolan's ""TDKR"" is recognized by the Academy as one of the best movies of the year--it was an injustice that"" The Dark Knight"" was not.  Whether a really great film started from a more entertaining genre like a graphic novel should not count against it--""A History of Violence,"" ""V for Vendetta, "" ""Road to Perdition"" and ""American Splendor"" are all landmark films deserving of serious consideration on their own.After all, Mark Twain and Charles Dickens were serialized in newpapers each week.

How do you make a Batman where ""The Batman"" (yes, apparently The Superman and The Spider-Man insisted on The The) is not in it as much as Commissioner Sid Vicious's '70s moustache or J. Gordon Levitation channeling his older alter Bruce Willis ego from Looper? Don't even get me started on McBane whose voice we finally nailed down as Marvin The Martian underwater after thinking at first he sounded like a Hungarian meets Dutch Goldmember of Austin Powers fame. Then again we spent half the movie trying to figure out how he ate. Did he get everything blended up and suck it through a straw?Speaking of voice work, what was up with Christian Bale when he put on the Batsuit deciding to adopt a Tom Waits meets Michael Keaton's voice from an earlier Batman? Or how about The Bathead's big fight scene with Darth Bane Vader where he decides it's a good idea to headbutt a guy with a huge chunk of metal attached right down the middle of his skull? Let alone The Batdude takes about six straight punches to the head and not a single drop of blood pours out. Is his head made out of the same material as his titanium suit?The story is so tired and old--madman holds city hostage with nuclear device (which apparently you can just fly out to the horizon and explode and not a drop of radiation will hit Pittsburgh...oops, Gotham). What's laughable are even more numerous preposterous scenes. Bad guys down in the sewer. OK, all you SWAT guys in full combat gear, let Commissioner Moustache go down first in a business suit and allow him to be captured by the bad guys. Good plan.Then while the commissioner (let me repeat that--the very top guy in the police force) is in a hospital bed, there appears to be zero police personnel posted in the hospital let alone on his floor or by the doors to protect him.Apparently because they were paying the actors so much money there was no budget for lighting either as it's more like the Dark ""Night"" Doesn't Rise. Plus we get gratuitous Liam ""Quickly! There's no time!"" Neeson, Morgan ""Driving Miss"" Freeman and even Matthew ""Birdy"" Modine (who deserved an Oscar for his excellent walkie-talkie work). But it's when Cillian Murphy and Marion By Cottiyard show up to join J. Gordon Liddy in this movie, I got the feeling director Christopher Nolan must've filmed Inception and this movie at the same time to save money.Did I mention how extremely slow the whole thing plods along? Even the special effects are ruined by too much talking and explanation after they're done.What will really make you laugh is how the police force decide to form one mass formation and charge both into a tunnel and later in the movie at the bad guys down a single street. It was like military tactics had not advanced an inch from the Civil War.The extras...well, after two hours and 40+ minutes of this nonsense, I was done.

Yes, Heath Ledger is dead and it would have been a mistake to try and replace him, but to decide you've had a charismatic villain in the previous film so it's time to go with a plodding boring one in Bane for the second is stupid. Everything that made ""The Dark Knight"" interesting is lacking here. And thanks for deciding to make Bane's voice so hard to understand. It's just like in the comics...no, wait, it's not anything like the comics. It's just a stupid plot contrivance to be artsy. Oh, and the whole ""rich people are evil"" plot point was unnecessary.3. The sudden introduction of a major character for convenience's sake. Remember in the third Lord of the Rings movie where Sam picks up Frodo and carries him the final steps to Mordor? Now imagine if we'd never heard of Sam before the third film, and suddenly he has more screen time than Frodo. Nolan decides to conveniently take Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, and even Batman out of the film through one circumstance or another and put all the focus on a brand new set of characters we don't know or care about. Yes, Blake was an interesting character...but he should have been in all three films if he was going to be that important. And if you haven't figured out who he really is within the first 15 minutes of the movie you aren't trying.4. The plot. Trying to combine ""The Dark Knight Returns"", ""Knightfall"", and ""No Man's Land"" into one film seemed too grand...and it was. He should have taken something like ""The Long Halloween"" or even just ONE of his three choices and made it a movie.The only plus in this is Catwoman. Anne lights up the screen when she's there with the missing action and charisma we get from absolutely no one else. She needed Blake's screen time though.All in all, I was incredibly disappointed. Yes, I understand the whole thing was ""Batman is human""...but why in the world did Nolan decide the way to end his trilogy was to make it this horribly plodding film that should have had at least 30 minutes cut out of it. I'm sorry to see DC's movie franchise falter like this after Green Lantern. They just can't catch a break.If Nolan comes back for another Batman film, I'll give him another chance and definitely watch it.

1418805,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B004LWZWGK,Chris Kennison,"[9, 18]","Much must be explained about why Christopher Nolan, who put together a trilogy of the most celebrated Batman movies of all time, would say that this one, ""Dark Knight Rises"", would be the last. It is most likely because he is now producing the upcoming ""Superman"" series as well, or maybe it's the typical Hollywood excuse of, ""I'm more than just Batman. I want to be more than just this."" Whatever the reason, it's a shame. Apparently, fans showing up in drones and giddy with glee isn't good enough for some.For the third and final outing, the anticipation may be better than the movie. It has a lot to follow up on after the second movie. ""Dark Knight"" blew up beyond recognition behind a posthumous Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger. With a larger than life storyline and some characters existing only to make small stories come to life, Nolan has a lot on his table and was trying to make a gigantic splash for his last trip to Gotham.The entire trilogy, beginning with ""Batman Begins"" has always been more about the man behind the mask than the man wearing the mask. ""Dark Knight Rises"" is no exception. Why does he do what he does? Why is he so special, other than the costume he wears that most of us would get laughed at wearing? Nolan answers all the questions and that may be part of the problem. For most of the movie, it seemed he was trying to cram every Batman apologue into his final hours before he left it. At one point, we know that Gotham's fate is on a timer, yet Batman stops to kiss the girl and reveal childhood secrets to Commissioner Gordon before taking off.Batman has been around since before World War 2 and many have taken liberties with the back-story and characters since. Nolan is no exception. Forget everything you've seen in the past or your expectations of what the villains Bane or Catwoman should be. I found the liberties taken here, were good ones, although Anne Hathway's Catwoman was way too interesting to be way so underused. Along that same line, there are many surprises that you won't see coming.You really can see the wheel of fortune of story-lines fluttering by in the first half of the movie as scenes jump from story to story. All of the story-lines come to form eventually and mostly begin to flow better toward the middle. Yet, like ""Batman Begins"" and pretty much every other Hollywood superhero movie, you have to wait for Bruce Wayne to rise to the occasion as he battles with demons and sits in a hole for most of the movie. I'm starting to think that this is a superhero movie tactic to save money on budget costs and shoot just enough action to make a great trailer and get money carrying patrons fired up.As a Batman fan, I'm not sure if I'm disappointed that I know that there is no more future to Nolan's Batman universe, or if the final trip there was less than I expected and I'M GLAD IT'S OVER. ""Dark Knight"" managed to be Dark and fun, ""Dark Knight Rises"", did not. We waited for most of the movie in ""Dark Knight Begins"" to get a taste of Batman and you get to do that again for the grand finale. For a Batman trilogy finale, I wanted Batman and he sat in a hole.

It will be really hard to explain how great the film is without spoiling one or two of the surprises so if the review seems incomplete, you might want to see the film; it is most definitely worth seeing. The third and likely final installment in Nolan's Batman film series focuses more on Batman and his lifelong struggles than anything else. From the beginning of Batman Begins, Batman has been struggling to find himself as a person due to the loss of his parents and strong desire to find justice when no justice seems possible. That is why the Batman/Bruce Wayne in this third movie struggles to live when being Batman is nearly impossible due to age and Gotham only reminds him of the loss of his family and Rachel. The movie is heavily grounded in action and the movie is paced so that we get occasional action throughout followed by a long and intense battle sequence at the end. The action is exceptionally paced and executed, keeping you so gripped that you easily let the film grab your entire attention and move you wherever it pleases. The acting is what you would expect from so many high quality actors: nothing short of fantastic. The story starts slow, but moves more quickly as the time wears on, but never falters or misses a spot to shine; the script and storyline are truly as good as Nolan said it would be. I don't feel like I can critique much further without spoiling something so I will leave you with this: the movie definitely goes all the way back to complete the entire trilogy and gives a true sense of closure for the legacy of Batman.

1418829,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZWGK,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","As soon as ""The Dark Knight Rises"" begins, you're practically guaranteed to have goosebumps. The opening scene is hair-raising; it's exciting, it's blood-pumping, it gives you an idea of what to expect over the next two hours and forty four minutes. You're practically tossed around, choked out, and physically manhandled by Bane nearly every moment he's on-screen. No, he's not as big as he was in the comics but he's still pretty freaking big. Tom Hardy is sensational. His eyes are so expressive, angry, and cold. Even though his actions will probably be the first thing you remember about the character, his eyes will practically haunt you during his performance.The entire cast is really phenomenal though. Christian Bale is still a solid Bruce Wayne/Batman, but it certainly seems as though he's more of a foundation for the rest of the cast to be greater than he is. Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Selina Kyle. Her being cast in the role seemed a bit underwhelming at first, but she surprises you. She makes the Catwoman character her own; she's intelligent, sexy, always has something quick-witted to say, and you figure out just enough about her to want her to be around more often than she is.The direction the Alfred character goes in is really interesting. He just wants what's best for Bruce, but does something that is easily the most difficult decision of his entire life. Michael Caine is extraordinary. He plays the father figure so perfectly. Gary Oldman shines, as well. Oldman is pretty great in every role he has anyway, but this is the first time in one of the Batman films where he's had to defend his actions. Oldman is so absorbing and enticing whenever he loses his cool or gets angry in a film. Newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deserves some recognition. Constantly called a hothead by his superior, Jim Gordon takes him under his wing. The John Blake character is so passionate about what he thinks is right and what he thinks Batman should be doing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job portraying that.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the film is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. There's enough familiarity in the soundtrack to trigger nostalgic moments from the two previous films, but it adds something raw and visceral during the chants and during anything that plays in the background when Bane is on screen. A song like ""The Fire Rises"" is haunting in a way and the music is so sharp; it cuts to your very bones. Pounding drums, horns that seem to bide their time and start low and then scream when you least expect it, and strings played so vigorously that you expect to hear them snap and break at some point. Meanwhile, the slower songs like ""Mind If I Cut In"" rely on something like a simple piano arrangement but also seem kind of playful at the same time to adhere to Selina Kyle.There are certain things in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" that make it really solid and one of the best third installments of any franchise, if not the best; the main one being the last twenty minutes or so. The conclusion is spectacular and it seems like Christopher Nolan built this entire near-three-hour spectacle around these key moments. It is near perfect and satisfying in almost every way.The other thing is how Nolan was able to bring so much back from not only ""The Dark Knight,"" but also ""Batman Begins"" and makes this feel that much more conclusive. Characters you remember are mentioned, Bruce's childhood is brought up on more than one occasion, and the whole movie is just littered with references and throwbacks to what this franchise has already accomplished. It feels like everything comes full circle and that this chapter of Batman is indeed over.Everything in between the jaw-dropping opening and the amazing conclusion feels so familiar though. There are new characters while old ones are taken down new paths and the destruction being done to Gotham is on the biggest scale this universe has ever seen, but if it wasn't for the well-written screenplay it would feel a bit repetitive. As you play the movie over in your head after it ends (and you will, more than once), you begin to see things and wonder why they weren't expanded on.One of them being that Selina Kyle is terrified of Bane. She's obviously familiar with what he's done in the past or had some sort of run-in with him. Their past is never really fully explained and the two characters don't really have any screen time together. Then there's the obvious nitpick of not being fully able to understand Bane at all times. It'll just give you an excuse to see it again, honestly.""The Dark Knight Rises"" is final in the best of ways. It is overflowing with explosive action, features passionate performances from every part of the cast, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't quite reach that status. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is really quite good and even great at times, but doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did.",4,A jaw-dropping and explosive finale,1342742400,"07 20,

1418832,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B004LWZWGK,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 7]","Director Christopher Nolan helped legitimize the comic book hero Batman, as grounded in the real world in Batman Begins and its landmark sequel, The Dark Knight.  Many trilogies fail to maintain the promise of the superior sequel (Spiderman II, The Godfather Part II, and Road Warrior), but in rare cases, there have been great third acts like Toy Story 3, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, and now The Dark Knight Rises.  Though it fails to surpass its predecessor, as an ambitious film with grand designs and elaborate themes, it mostly succeeds.Several years after the events of The Dark Knight, the legacy of Harvey Dent lives on as crime has been stifled in Gotham City and the wealthy and elite hold sway.  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a hobbled recluse whose masked hero, Batman, has been hunted and banished under false pretenses.  Gotham is pristine and ready for a new age, and relics like Batman and even Commissioner Gordon are not needed anymore and obsolete.  A mysterious masked villain named Bane (Thomas Hardy) begins a calculated reign of terror which paralyzes the city.  But what is his motive and what does this have to do with Batman? As Gordon (Gary Oldman) pleads for the return of the caped crusader and the city cries out for salvation, Batman must overcome a very powerful Bane to save the city.  He is aided by his servant Alfred (Michael Caine), technical wizard Lucius (Morgan Freeman), and a young cop, John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and bedazzled by two mysterious women, Selina (Anne Hathaway) and Miranda (Marion Cottilard).  But first, Bruce Wayne must return from the abyss to confront his past and battle for Gotham City's future.The briskly paced 2 hour 45 minute film is always engaging with memorable moments.  The opening sequence is a marvelous midair hijack right out of a Bond film. (Come to think of it, Nolan's got the Bond thing down as in the snowy climax of Inception.)  A scene where a doctor gives Wayne failing marks in his physical is amusing.  The climactic action between the forces of good and evil recalls the finale to Metropolis and the face off of its protagonist and antagonist are right out of Enter the Dragon.Nolan likes intricate puzzles; witness Momento and Inception.  He takes previous storylines including the convoluted ending of The Dark Knight and serves some nice twists here.  The film is a cleverly built trap, and Batman's fall from grace is a rapid decent into the depths of hopelessness and despair. To be great again, he has to literally and figuratively climb his way back; in a sense, the fates of the masked avenger and Gotham City are linked.The film is able to explore some interesting relationships both past and present, and duality of key characters is a recurring theme. For Wayne, Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are fatherly figures through his orphaned childhood and adult life.  Selina and Miranda are women with different backgrounds and agendas.  Blake, the idealistic, honest cop shares a common bond with Wayne.  Even Batman, the tortured, self sacrificing hero has a counterpart in Bane, the ultimate, super terrorist, who is intelligent, cunning, and ruthless.With so many characters, it is remarkable how Nolan and screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan are able to weave together storylines featuring each role prominently.  In particular, the paradoxical Selina is a `cat burglar' and a survivor who has to learn how to trust another person.  Her interaction with Wayne always intrigues as they play out a kind of dance, and we wonder her true motives.  She is a kind of outsider and observer of the events that will determine the fate of Gotham City.The film boldly tackles major themes adding layer upon layer.  It's about past sins and morality: the great deception over Harvey Dent for the greater good presents risks and has severe consequences here.  Amid complacency there is class warfare: as Bane incites the masses and bolsters his numbers, the city faces a dichotomy of the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie.  The film also tests the concept of trust and faith: sometimes the ones we trust betray us while others may surprise us with their loyalty.There are minor missteps e.g. immaculate streets when the city's infrastructure is at a standstill.  A brief moment at a cafe at film's end reveals a bit too much of a truth when subtle reactions could have sufficed.  The film's tone is dark, angst filled with rare moments of humor. That's not a knock on the film but don't go expecting Avengers type of laughs.  There's also an amusing cameo in the role of President and a macabre return of a key villain.Hans Zimmer's minimalist pulse keeps the mood humming along.  Visuals are technically outstanding with minimal use of computer generated effects, and this is where it deviates from the more colorful, super heroes of The Avengers and X Men.  Here we have a hero and backdrop that is set in a believable world which heightens realism and credibility.Brimming with ideas as it challenges us in ways most action films movies don't, The Dark Knight Rises is a strong conclusion to the trilogy.  A deeply allegorical film that demands repeated viewings to truly appreciate its intricacies, it dares to bend and reinvent the mythology of the caped crusader, and although it doesn't quite trump The Dark Knight, which set the bar impossibly high, its vision at times carries its audience to wonderful, lofty heights.",4,Nolan's Grand Finale in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (or How Batman Got His Groove

1418849,AFVO1TRRZAYYF,B004LWZWGK,DarkKnight,"[8, 18]","Yes, the movie was good, but it wasn't great. It was about on the same level of Batman Begins, but that was already done. Then there was the Dark Knight, which was a step up from Batman Begins. This final film is then a step down. An ""ending"" should always be a step above the last. So, the movie kind of disappoints. Perhaps it was because I watched the whole trilogy at once, or that it was late and I was kind of tired and hungry, but I'm not surprised. Christopher Nolan himself has said the problem with movie franchises is that the first films are almost always better. In this case, the second one is the best.SPOILERS AHEADI'm just going to jump right into it. How can this be an end when that would totally contradict the first movie? Batman isn't a man. He's a symbol, an ideal, not flesh and blood. Men can die. Men will die. But Batman will always live on as a beacon of hope for the oppressed and a nightmare of fear for those without decency. And the actual ending to this final film? Yes, Bruce Wayne ""dies"", but so does Selina Kyle as she obviously wiped her record clean or even from existence. So, legally, they're dead, or at least one is and the other no longer exists, but physically speaking, they're alive and well and seem to be together romantically. Batman's not dead as Robin John Blake (his full name) has inherited the batcave and will obviously assume the mantle, even though he hasn't been as highly trained like Bruce. So, right there, you can already make a fourth Batman film and even a spinoff 'Midnight in Florence' romantic film about two lovers, no past, many secrets, questionable source of income, and much more. As for Bane, he truly is a student of Ras Al Ghul as in I felt like I just watched a longer version of Batman Begins. I mean, statistically, he should be the scariest foe of all the movies as he killed the highest number of innocent people and destroyed the most property, but he never came off as menacing as the Joker. And it was hard to understand what he said sometimes with his Darth Vader meets Sean Connery voice. And how could Bruce Wayne not figure out he had Talia Al Ghul in his presence? It's supposed to be realistic. Am I supposed to believe Bruce Wayne doesn't do background checks on his business associates? And he also slept with her. He only kissed Rachel and he technically stalked her in the first two movies. He found out everything he could about Selina Kyle before kissing her. But if he sleeps with a woman, he wont even google her? That's just nonsensical. The movie was disappointing. I figured the whole thing out before the 40 minute mark. The Dark Knight was way better. That movie blew me away. The only things that surprised me in this movie was that Alfred left Bruce Wayne which, to me, came out of nowhere, Wayne Enterprises was bankrupt (before Bane even showed up), and that someone would actually name their son Robin. I see why John Blake never said that name once throughout the whole movie. I guess I should review Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Not going to lie, better than I thought it would be, but still forgettable. She did well as Selina Kyle, but her Catwoman wasn't very good. It just didn't seem natural. I could buy her girl next door turned femme fatale, but the tights just seemed too far for her acting range. That reminds me, Bane's death sucked too. He should've died in an explosion, preferably with the Wayne tech built device threatening the city like Ras Al Ghul before him. That gives me an idea for a better ending. Tragic, but better.

The Dark Knight Rises is no different.As the final chapter in a 3 act movement, this movie was bound to be a bit of a let down after the The Dark Knight.  It would probably be impossible to top Heath Ledger as Joker and the intensity of that movie.  For that matter, I don't think that Nolan tried.  I think he just went about his work.  In that way, the choice of Bane was the villain is fantastic.  If you watch this movie and aren't creeped out by Bane, I am not sure what's wrong with you.Bane is an unbelievable villain.  He embodies evil and yet Nolan finds way to humanize him and also to show how psychotic he really is.As for the story of the Selina Kyle, Anne Hathaway does a nice job of filling a role that is a tough one in the Nolan universe just because Kyle is a much stronger character than any other woman has been in this trilogy.  Does she fit what the traditional comic book fan would say is Catwoman?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  In the context of the Nolan Batman universe, she is a good fit and she adds a bit of continuity to the story between Batman and Bane.The big question of any series is whether or not the main character evolves over the course of the story.  In the case of Bruce Wayne/Batman, he would have to or he would be dead.  I guess the big question for anyone watching the movie is did Wayne change enough?  Did Wayne find peace?In total, I was probably predetermined to like this Batman movie.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it a good ending for the series?  Yes.  Should you watch it?

1418878,A8U2QBRPF0CAB,B004LWZWGK,"D. Miller ""Derek Fawaz""","[4, 9]","Many have said ""The Dark Knight"" is the strongest entry in Christopher Nolan's Batman Story starring Christian Bale.  It is a strong film that cemented Nolan as a master at directing bigger pictures.  However, as many times as I have seen TDK I always walk away feeling there is still something important missing in the film.  The only part of the film that worked beautifully was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker.  Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne that was handled with care in ""Batman Begins,"" was greatly overshadowed in the overall story of TDK, despite the intensity of his acting in the suit.  The story as a result was just focused on its commentary of control versus chaos placing the growth of its hero in the background.  In the end I felt Chris Nolan and his crew could do even better and that the second film was a prelude to greatness.I am not giving away any spoilers, since this is a film best seen knowing as little about the story as possible.In ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Nolan and his crew more than made up for any of the shortcomings of the second film.  Nolan, his brother Jonathan, and David S. Goyer returned the focus of their story to what gave it its initial strength:  the main hero.  Christian Bale gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne as a recovering, but very wounded individual whose life as Batman has physically and mentally drained him of living a balanced life after eight years of retirement.  Bale manages to convey more emotion in his face, body, and voice than he did in the previous two chapters, taking Bruce Wayne beyond the boundaries of a superhero to portraying him as a fragile man fighting to purge Gotham of the remaining threats to give the people of his city the living environment they deserve.One aspect I loved about Bruce Wayne's character in The Dark Knight Rises that was excluded in The Dark Knight was that we got to see more of Bale's performance without the bat suit.  After seeing Bale's reinvention of the character in Batman Begins I grew to care more about the man underneath the mask.  He is an awesome actor and it was tiring to see the majority of Bale's acting in the suit for the second film.  In The Dark Knight Rises Nolan conveys the heart in his story of Bruce Wayne by keeping him unmasked.While focusing his final chapter on Bruce Wayne's character arc, Nolan still manages to create an enthralling equation with his rich ensemble cast, both with new and returning characters.  Bale shares some of his strongest screen time with every actor in the film and vice versa.  Michael Caine is magnificent as Bruce's butler, Alfred who performs the character with an aching father love towards the hero that is difficult to look away from.  Gary Oldman portrays Commissioner James Gordon as a man more desperate to maintain his humanity after everything that has happened in Gotham City.  Then there is Joseph Gordon Levitt as Detective John Blake who is a great supporting character who serves as a bridge for Bruce Wayne and Gordon to unite again for their mission.  As Lucius Fox, Wayne's weapons engineer, Morgan Freeman portrays the character with more of the comic warmth and resourcefulness that has made his supporting role special.  Another character who turns out to be a surprise is Matthew Modine as Deputy Commissioner Foley who develops from an arrogant cop to a selfless figure of the law, willing to lay down his life to protect the city.  Every character in the film has an important purpose in Wayne's story as they are inspired, or influenced to combat the conflict in his journey.While not as captivating as Ledger's Joker, Tom Hardy still creates a powerful portrayal of Bane that brings a different kind of threat to the City that is complex and intelligent for Wayne to return in the bat suit.  Half of Hardy's face is covered in a mask throughout the film, but the viewer easily forgets that he has one due to the amount of attention he utilizes in his forehead, eyes, and voice.  Bane ultimately serves as the worst case scenario in Nolan's story, if everything the characters worked for was undone.  He is a villain with a physicality and brain that pushes Wayne's motivation as a hero to the test.  If the filmmakers had gone with a villain similar to the Joker, it would have decreased the film's strength and would have been a redundant mess.A massive plus in this film that was lacking in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was the love interest for Bruce Wayne.  It was a very wise choice for Nolan to retire Rachel Dawes from the series.  She was a character bloated with attitude, sarcasm, and rarely unsupportive towards Bruce.  It was difficult to see how a love relationship began between them in the first place besides sharing a childhood together.  In The Dark Knight Rises there is the beautiful Anne Hathaway as the iconic Selina Kyle/Catwoman and the equally hypnotizing Marion Cotillard as Wayne board member, Miranda Tate.  Both women are sexy and desirable who share wonderful chemistry with Bale.  At the same time Cotillard and Hathaway brighten their characters with a humanity that makes them both feel genuine, as if they could exist in our reality.  In the main character's story Selina and Miranda are essential as Wayne begins to grow interested in both of them for their own special traits.  As opposed to Rachel Dawes, Selina and Miranda are women who are reflections, or equals to Bruce himself.  Selina is a ""Robin Hood"" type who admires Bruce for his lack of selfishness and Miranda for his dedication in upholding his family's company.Wally Pfister's cinematography for the film is nothing less than extraordinary.  The footage looks exceptionally beautiful for being such a dark film.  Whether shot in an ancient prison or in the snow at night, or day in the city, every frame manages to capture your senses and never let you go.  Nolan and Pfister maintain the reality of the Gotham they've developed for the previous films and at the same time create a beautiful atmosphere of dark contrast with bright color to bring life into the dying city.  The scope of Gotham City and the world around it has been increased due to the fact that Nolan decided to shoot the film in New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, london, and Jodhpur, India.  As a result the film has the feeling of a grand epic that helps breath life into the character of Bruce Wayne expanding on the motivational freedom of the lead characters.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for The Dark Knight Rises is the most powerful and heartfelt of the trilogy. Zimmer brings the urbanized tone from the previous films while mixing fresh tracks of operatic noir with beautiful tones of calm closure for the characters' story.  The chant ""Deshi Basara"" (Moroccan Arabic for ""Rise up"") that Zimmer composed with his chorus and the voices he collected on UJAM gives the viewer an inspirational jolt in bringing Bruce's destiny full circle.Christopher Nolan brings his best skills as a writer and director in The Dark Knight Rises.  It is the best film about Bruce Wayne/Batman and an appropriate conclusion to one of the most epic trilogies in cinematic history.  As opposed to most third entries in popular trilogies (The Matrix Revolutions, The Godfather Part III, Spider-Man 3), this one looks and feels as if the filmmakers took their time to get everything just right.  It is a different kind of superhero film unmatchable that at 164 minutes never has a dull, or flat moment and the viewer will forget about the time that is passing by outside the theater.  Nolan has completed a near perfect story as a result of The Dark Knight Rises with careful storytelling and passionate performances from every actor in the cast.",5,The best film in Christopher

It was viewed on a home theater PC with Radeon 6570 and total media theater dts-HD MA bitstream passthrough capable via Onkyo receiver to Plasma TV. Picture quality was amazing, even the night scenes with city scapes shone through, truly reference quality. One point that I found slightly distracting is the periodic change in aspect ratio. Movie starts with 1.78(full screen) then switches to 2.40 (black bars present) and this is repeated throughout the movie. I wish they'd stayed with 1.78 which apparently used an Imax camera as I found it to be more immersive. Sound is incredible, Banes voice and even Batman's gruff voice came through clearly and the explosions and the whirl of the Bat were unreal.Finally Ultraviolet is a ripoff. You're forced to sign up with them and after going through hoops you're finally allowed to download a standard definition movie that cannot be played by windows media player or windows media center but only with a rudimentary flixster program that can't even fast forward or advance to the next scene.I'd like to ask the Movie studios why would I want a SD copy of a High definition movie? You've already forced me into buying an unwanted DVD with this combo. I want a high definiton copy that I can stream as I did with Inception. This is the last UV copy I'll be purchasing, if the digital copy cannot be played by media player or isn't high definition I will only purchase Blu rays even if I have to do without the special features (yes, another nice trick Hollywood).My final rating is 4.5 stars for Movie, 5 stars for blu ray and 0 stars for Ultraviolet.",3,Great Movie and reference Blu Ray but Ultraviolet is sorely lacking,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1829,"['movie', 'review', 'nutshell', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'villains', 'who', 'terrorizes', '1', '%', 'whom', 'are', 'saved', 'former', 'one', 'percenter.Now', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'reviews', 'was', 'viewed', 'home', 'theater', 'PC', 'Radeon', '6570', 'total', 'media', 'theater', 'dts-HD', 'MA', 'bitstream', 'passthrough', 'capable', 'Onkyo', 'receiver', 'Plasma', 'TV', 'Picture', 'quality', 'was', 'amazing', 'even', 'night', 'scenes', 'city', 'scapes', 'shone', 'truly', 'reference', 'quality', 'One', 'point', 'found', 'slightly', 'distracting', 'periodic', 'change', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Movie', '1.78', 'full', 'screen', 'then', '2.40', 'black', 'bars', 'present', 'repeated', 'movie', 'wish', ""'d"", 'stayed', '1.78', 'apparently', 'used', 'Imax', 'camera', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'immersive', 'Sound', 'incredible', 'Banes', 'voice', 'even', 'Batman', 'gruff', 'voice', 'came', 'clearly', 'explosions', 'whirl', 'Bat', 'were', 'unreal.Finally', 'Ultraviolet', 'ripoff', ""'re"", 'forced', 'sign', 'up', 'going', 'hoops', ""'re"", 'finally', 'allowed', 'download', 'standard', 'definition', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'windows', 'media', 'player', 'windows', 'media', 'center', 'only', 'rudimentary', 'flixster', 'program', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'fast', 'forward', 'advance', 'next', 'scene.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'ask', 'Movie', 'studios', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'SD', 'copy', 'High', 'definition', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'forced', 'buying', 'unwanted', 'DVD', 'combo', 'want', 'high', 'definiton', 'copy', 'can', 'stream', 'did', 'Inception', 'last', 'UV', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'purchasing', 'digital', 'copy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'media', 'player', ""n't"", 'high', 'definition', 'will', 'only', 'purchase', 'Blu', 'rays', 'even', 'have', 'do', 'special', 'features', 'yes', 'nice', 'trick', 'Hollywood', '.My', 'final', 'rating', '4.5', 'stars', 'Movie', '5', 'stars', 'blu', 'ray', '0', 'stars', 'Ultraviolet']",The Dark Knight Rises

1418889,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B004LWZWGK,drqshadow,"[2, 4]","A perfect fit alongside Christopher Nolan's preceding Batman films, with no single chapter standing clearly above the others. Where The Dark Knight played up the conundrum of Bruce Wayne as a public mask for Batman, this installment flips the script and focuses more intently on a well-rounded civilian identity at the expense of Wayne's more notorious alter-ego. That shifted focus fits snugly alongside the presence of a more grounded, topical-tinged foil in Bane, whose grand plans aren't all that different from those of his two predecessors, but reverberate in the modern social atmosphere. The strict black-and-white nature of the very real debate at the core of Bane's scheme is my sole disappointment, really, as the shades of gray I so appreciated in the first two episodes have been subtly brushed aside. Tom Hardy performs admirably in full pantomime as the big bad, with Anne Hathaway playing a fine Catwoman (though the role seems inessential for the majority of the film), but it's Michael Caine who steals the show in a very brief, emotional final turn as Wayne's infamous butler Alfred. Although he enjoys only five minutes of screen time, when the curtain falls it's his vivid performance you'll most remember. A brilliant, daring, explosive climax that expertly puts the lid on one of modern film's finest action/adventure trilogies, it surprised and impressed me from the very first word.",5,A Breathtaking Climax to Comics' Best-Translated Property,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,1407,"['perfect', 'fit', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'preceding', 'Batman', 'films', 'single', 'chapter', 'standing', 'clearly', 'others', 'Where', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'played', 'up', 'conundrum', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'public', 'mask', 'Batman', 'installment', 'script', 'more', 'intently', 'well-rounded', 'civilian', 'identity', 'expense', 'Wayne', 'more', 'notorious', 'alter-ego', 'shifted', 'focus', 'fits', 'snugly', 'presence', 'more', 'grounded', 'topical-tinged', 'foil', 'Bane', 'grand', 'plans', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'different', 'two', 'predecessors', 'reverberate', 'modern', 'social', 'atmosphere', 'strict', 'black-and-white', 'nature', 'very', 'real', 'debate', 'core', 'Bane', 'scheme', 'sole', 'disappointment', 'really', 'shades', 'gray', 'so', 'appreciated', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'subtly', 'brushed', 'aside', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'admirably', 'full', 'pantomime', 'big', 'bad', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'playing', 'fine', 'Catwoman', 'role', 'inessential', 'majority', 'film', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'show', 'very', 'brief', 'emotional', 'final', 'turn', 'Wayne', 'infamous', 'butler', 'Alfred', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'curtain', 'vivid', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'most', 'remember', 'brilliant', 'daring', 'explosive', 'climax', 'expertly', 'lid', 'one', 'modern', 'film', 'finest', 'action/adventure', 'trilogies', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'very', 'first', 'word']",The Dark Knight Rises
1418890,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B004LWZWGK,dylan21484nj,"[0, 1]","It's been eight years since Batman rode away into the night, taking the blame for the deceased Harvey Dent's murders so Dent may remain the inspirational symbol Gotham City needs to pull itself out of the thralls of crime and corruption. Bruce Wayne has hung up the cape and cowl, ceased development on a clean-energy fusion device his company, Wayne Enterprises, has been researching, and has become a Howard Hughes-like recluse, nursing a crippled knee from his last encounter with Dent and a broken heart over the loss of his potential love interest, Rachel Dawes. Gotham uses Harvey's memory to pass the Dent Act, legislation that has kept the gangsters and mob thugs that Dent imprisoned indefinitely. Crime is at an all-time low. It seems that Batman has won and is no longer needed.But a fire rises. The emergence of professional cat burglar *hint hint* Selina Kyle heralds the arrival of Bane, a masked, muscled mercenary with ties to Bruce's past with the League of Shadows. Bane is amassing an army in the subway tunnels beneath Gotham and plans to hold the city hostage using the nuclear core of Wayne's fusion device. So Bruce must come out of retirement, rev up the Batpod once again, and take on Bane to save the city from total decimation.Like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises borrows elements of seminal Batman works from the past. The Dark Knight Returns (in which an aging Bruce Wayne returns to a life a crimefighting after quitting due to a personal tragedy), Batman: Knightfall (where Bane ""breaks the Bat,"" thoroughly defeating Batman and leaving him paralyzed from a broken spine), and Batman: No Man's Land (where a major disaster ravages Gotham, leaving it cut off from the rest of the world and ruled by gang warfare) all lend story points to Rises. Nolan and collaborator David Goyer mix these elements into a single story, trying to throw as much adversity at the Caped Crusader as possible, since it was fairly clear that this would be the final installment of a trilogy.And you can sorta tell that Nolan is getting tired of the Batman world, like he doesn't have much else to say about it. So it's probably good that he ended with this film instead of milking the story for cash and resulting in an embarassment of Batman & Robin proportions. What's odd is that it seems that he's constrained himself with his ""gritty, realistic"" approach to this franchise that many attempts to stretch the boundaries of believability or make leaps of logic seem like an affront to his own storytelling style. Bane's attempt to essentially use identity fraud to bankrupt Bruce Wayne seems like an easy fix that could be straightened out rather quickly in reality, and how a broke Bruce Wayne manages to find his way back to Gotham after being imprisoned on the other side of the planet seems highly contrived, though many have used the ""Because he's Batman!"" excuse to fall back on. Heck, with modern airline security, how does a guy like Bane get in and out of the country to deposit Bruce in an Asian prison without any red flags going up? A supporting character manages to figure out that Bruce Wayne is Batman after only meeting Bruce years ago and without using much deducting skill or reasoning, yet no police detectives or even Comissioner Gordon himself can figure it out? I mean, the fact that Bruce and Batman show up in Gotham and then disappear from public life at the same time, not to mention that few people other than Bruce Wayne can afford the kind of tech that Batman uses should be an obvious giveaway. There are plenty more inconsistencies that glare at you as you watch this, and you wonder how the writer/director of a film with such a tight narrative as Inception can allow himself to make a film with so many holes in it.Tom Hardy's Bane is an imposing enough villain, but his master plan for Gotham isn't a very strong one. Spoilers follow, so be warned. Bane's plan is to use a nuclear bomb to hold the city hostage, and portrays himself as a revolutionary figure trying to start an uprising against Gotham's rich and corrupt while the rest of Gotham's citizens desperately struggle against each other to survive. However, the bomb is going to detonate on its own after five months, so why bother waiting that long and just detonate it anyway if your ultimate goal is to destroy the city no matter what? To watch a city that has been given false hope slowly destroy itself? Why bother with that when the bomb will still go off? It feels some contrived and overly complicated.Also, for a Batman movie, there isn't much of Batman in it. As stated earlier, Bruce gave up being Batman for years, so the film picks up with Wayne as a recluse, and it takes some time before he puts the cape back on again. And when he does cape up, he shows up for roughly two or three scenes before he's taken out of commission once again for most of the film's midsection until the finale. This might have been necessary to generate a conflict big enough to seem too much for Batman and his allies to overcome, but they spent much of Batman Begins building up Bruce's evolution into Batman that you'd think we'd at least get to see more Batman now.On the bright side, you have to admit that Nolan has guts for giving the audience a definitive end to a superhero franchise. Franchises like these tend to keep going until there's a revolving door of creators, the same roles have been recast numerous times to maintain the eternal youth of the main characters, and all creativity peters out as the films settle into formula until all lucrative profit dissipates. And now that this franchise has started the trend of ""reboots"" as a way to renew tired franchises, it's as if Nolan is cinematically conceding that even though the people who make them will get old and die, these characters and stories will keep going on forever. He's getting out on his own terms, ending the story his way, and readily handing over the Batman story to whoever will take it on next. Even the plot admits this, as it continues with the notion that Batman is an idea, a symbol. Batman is more than the man behind the mask. That man will get old and die, but Batman will live on as long as someone else takes up the mantle. So as Bruce Wayne passes on the cape and cowl, Christopher Nolan is handing over the keys to the Batcave to the next filmmaker to take over the legend of the Batman.There are a number of extras that discuss the film's characters and themes, but the best is the 10-minute Batmobile documentary. It explores all the iterations of Batman's most famous piece of tech and what it has meant to people over the years, and showcases the first time all the real Batmobiles, from the Adam West 60's series all the way to the Dark Knight Trilogy's Tumbler, have been collected in one place. At one point, the Tumbler is taken to a children's hospital, and you never thought you'd get misty-eyed watching a documentary about the Batmobile until now.

It came with dts-hd, the best sound for movies in my personal opinion... The blasts, fights, environmental sounds really make you feel close to the action... As if you were in Gotham city during the whole movie... The soundtrack is also great.... It follows the previews movies style, making you vibrate along with the story... It dictates the ""mood"" so well I just couldn't imagine any other soundtrack for this movie.

The movies runs smooth and the image is so great you can't take your eyes off the screen... You don't even want to blink, afraid to miss something...The plot: Nolan made a really great work with this movie. It has tons of fast-paced action, it has despair, it has hope, it also has emotions.... These are so well mixed up along the story you just can't wish it was better.... Of course there are some differences between comics and this movie adaptation, but its a great movie.I got many surprises during the movie... The story comes filled with revelations and surprises.... During the movie, there are so many revelations that almost everyone would probably say; "" oh my... I just didn't see that coming..."" The movie is a piece of art....

Unlike the continuity of the comics, the movie Batman disappears from the public and Robin makes an appearance at the end of the movie.  It opens up this 3rd movie for a 4th movie but it is unknown if there will be #4 of the Christopher Nolen Trilogy.  The action and the effects were exemplary and the script was literate. The movie had a film noir - a perhaps too dark quality - but it was still very entertaining.  The character Bane was similar to the comic book counterpart.

1418900,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LWZWGK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 5]","THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (Dir. Chris Nolan, 2012, 1,645 - OOPS, 165 minutes) was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and in an unusual step for me I say up front: don't waste a moment on this waste of time.As you probably know, Bruce Wayne has been hiding in the east wing of his mansion for 7 or 8 years. I notice fans have trouble with Wayne's physical condition so let me illuminate what you all clearly missed: Wayne went into tired seclusion after YEARS of playing Batman, and he did so after Gotham was more or less finished with him too. Recall, Batman took the blame for the death of Dent, when it was actually Gordon's fault. Note also Gordon is commissioner. You think they just give that rank away like a lollypop? Hence Gordon is no longer a lieutenant, and Wayne's all beat to hell.It did not happen overnight, or in 8 years, dummies! It appears it is closer to a total period of 15 years. Now, I can see the confusion here since the last Batman film was very careless about Dent, his fate and the timeline. But then ... the message with this film is obvious: Who cares!So ... to resume, a spaz called ""Bane"" (or is it ""Bain""? - played by Tom Hardy) lets himself loose on Gotham, trying to finish what they started in the original Chris Nolan film. I can only add that I wish the rest were history.Joseph Gordon-Levitt appears here as Officer Blake, who will obviously be Robin in the next mess of films they make - so don't believe Ebert or whoever it was who said Batman is gone and retired.I enjoyed the first Nolan film a great deal. Even if Christian Bale did impersonate Michael Keaton a little too much, and Nolan certainly took heavily from Tim Burton. This film, with the impossibly unbeatable Bane and his damned irritating voice (like the pope suffering from asthma and at least an octave higher), has virtually no Batman scenes and the ones it has are tiresome.This introduces Catwoman (the ever-annoying Anne Hathaway), or at least I assumed that's who she was - they never gave her a name aside from Selena, which is Catwoman's real name. It has to be admitted that in this role Hathaway was not bad. Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry didn't manage to do this role very well at all, but then Hathaway undoubtedly had a good stunt double.Gary Oldman and Michael Caine make cameo appearances which through seemingly clever editing appear more substantial than they actually are. What sort of director has greats like Caine and Oldman, then cuts them down to about three minutes of screen time each? Oh well. Obviously everyone's really tired at this point, so I can't blame them.I can only blame the studio for releasing this otherwise unedited mess. The right thing to do would have been to leave it at the 2nd film - which then leaves a door open for another REAL Batman sequel.And this sure ain't no Batman movie.",2,Bat guano - and few bats in sight,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2843,"['DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'RISES', 'Dir', 'Chris', 'Nolan', '2012', '1,645', 'OOPS', '165', 'minutes', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'unusual', 'step', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'moment', 'waste', 'time.As', 'probably', 'know', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'been', 'hiding', 'east', 'wing', 'mansion', '7', '8', 'years', 'notice', 'fans', 'have', 'trouble', 'Wayne', 'physical', 'condition', 'so', 'let', 'illuminate', 'what', 'clearly', 'missed', 'Wayne', 'went', 'tired', 'seclusion', 'YEARS', 'playing', 'Batman', 'did', 'so', 'Gotham', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'finished', 'too', 'Recall', 'Batman', 'took', 'blame', 'death', 'Dent', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'Gordon', 'fault', 'Note', 'also', 'Gordon', 'commissioner', 'think', 'just', 'give', 'rank', 'away', 'lollypop', 'Hence', 'Gordon', 'no', 'longer', 'lieutenant', 'Wayne', 'beat', 'hell.It', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'overnight', '8', 'years', 'closer', 'total', 'period', '15', 'years', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'confusion', 'here', 'last', 'Batman', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'careless', 'Dent', 'fate', 'timeline', 'then', 'message', 'film', 'obvious', 'Who', 'So', 'resume', 'spaz', 'called', 'Bane', 'Bain', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'loose', 'Gotham', 'trying', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'original', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'wish', 'rest', 'were', 'history.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'here', 'Officer', 'Blake', 'who', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'Robin', 'next', 'mess', 'films', 'make', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ebert', 'whoever', 'was', 'who', 'said', 'Batman', 'gone', 'retired.I', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Nolan', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'Even', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'did', 'impersonate', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Nolan', 'certainly', 'took', 'heavily', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'impossibly', 'unbeatable', 'Bane', 'damned', 'irritating', 'voice', 'pope', 'suffering', 'asthma', 'least', 'octave', 'higher', 'virtually', 'Batman', 'scenes', 'ones', 'are', 'tiresome.This', 'introduces', 'Catwoman', 'ever-annoying', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'least', 'assumed', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'gave', 'name', 'aside', 'Selena', 'Catwoman', 'real', 'name', 'be', 'admitted', 'role', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'do', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'then', 'Hathaway', 'undoubtedly', 'had', 'good', 'stunt', 'double.Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'seemingly', 'clever', 'editing', 'appear', 'more', 'substantial', 'actually', 'are', 'What', 'sort', 'director', 'greats', 'Caine', 'Oldman', 'then', 'down', 'three', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Oh', 'well', 'Obviously', 'everyone', 'really', 'tired', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'them.I', 'can', 'only', 'blame', 'studio', 'releasing', 'otherwise', 'unedited', 'mess', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'leave', '2nd', 'film', 'then', 'door', 'open', 'REAL', 'Batman', 'sure', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Batman', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Rises

While the plot is to save the City of Gotham, as always, the stories are in the whys of the motivations behind the well-developed characters' actions.  This is the great common approach to the storytelling in both Lincoln and the Dark Knight Rises. And it makes a very strong storytelling, indeed.The Dark Knight Rises starts off with evil's physical personification as stereotyped in many minds: a big burly man with a mask over his face. But we, the audience, have come to know what extreme evil might really look like: from sweet-faced medical students to twenty-something young men from affluent suburbs of America. The story goes on showing the transformation of ordinary honest working people to become extraordinary, neither by following what they are told to do, nor waiting to be told what to do--but doing what they think is the right thing to do by understanding the greater intentions that truly matter.As for the Oscars, my vote for the best picture of 2012 would be this one, The Dark Knight Rises.

No, it doesn't state on the box that it does, I'd just assumed this set would have everything the single dvd has.Disc 2 : Batmobile Featurette (really cool) and Ending the Knight Featurette (not watched yet). Box says ""and more"" which I thought would be the Bruce Wayne featurette. There is no ""and more"". Well, at least we get two (and maybe the best) featurettes from the blu-ray, and don't have to convert from our standard definition format. Of course they could've add more for the price of this 2-Disc (which is more like a bonus disc), but It's still great to have a 2-Disc edition of this movie available for others like me who don't own (or want) blu-ray players, but still want the special features which I feel should be available in standard format anyway.Update: The Blockbuster rental copy of The Dark Knight Rises does NOT have the Bruce Wayne Featurette that's included on the retail version. So It's just like the one manufactured by money grubbing Warner Bros. for the 2-Disc edition except it has a gray color insteady of the black found on the 2-disc, and Trilogy sets. Note: The Dark Knight Rises included in the standard definition Trilogy set DOES have the Bruce Wayne Featurette, but none of the other films have any. The box says it includes bonus content from all three films, which is actually just a booklet and one featurette, a detail that could've helped alot of their customers who were looking for the movie or set best for them.

From the moment I saw it, it became my favorite comic book movie of all time.  The cast is great and the action never lets up.  The final hour is almost non-stop suspense and action with that great music continuously driving it along.  Bale, Caine and Oldman are predictably great and Anne Hathaway looks fantastic and steals every scene as the best Catwoman ever.I have to laugh whenever I read that this film is a great letdown after The Dark Knight.  I hate to say anything in bad taste but I believe that The Dark Knight only became a classic only as a result of Heath Ledger's OD.  There was so much about that film that I did not buy.  The bit with the two ferries was the worst.  Does anyone really believe that a ferry of criminals, enemies of society, would not have blown up the ferry of Gotham's working stiffs, given the chance, to save themselves?  Yet no one finds this implausible?  The action scene with Batman fighting the SWAT cops to prevent them from killing the doctors tied up with Joker masks was totally convoluted.  Did anyone find the conclusion with Batman on the run from the death of Harvey Dent satisfying?  (Yes, I know that that ending leads into the plot of the new film, but did you really find that ending satisfying when you first saw it?)  The Dark Knight Rises does leave one with a satisfying feeling upon leaving the theater.  As stated, it is my favorite of the Dark Knight Trilogy. (I prefer Batman Begins to the Dark Knight as well.)There are so many other great things about this film.  The high shot of the hundreds of Gotham City cops running down Wall Street to confront Bane's thugs never fails to be breathtaking.  I love the fact that so little CGI was used in this scene: just hundreds of extras and stuntmen.I also love the scene of that little boy singing The Star Spangled Banner as Bane and his thugs infiltrate the football stadium to begin their destruction.

The story has a familiar feel to it, full of action - villain vs. hero, but it was surrounded by such a huge group of superb actors that it was meant to succeed. With the addition of Anne Hathaway as the cat woman (though not directly referred to in the film), Tom Hardy who so valiantly plays the villain (or is he?), Marion Cotillard who is so mesmerizing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt it breathed new life into what could have been a so-so conclusion to a trilogy of crime fighting.Nearly three hours in length I found it neither slow, boring nor over the top as some comic book hero movies can be. The story gives us a dose of history, some truth from the two previous films and what seems to be an offering of the future.

1418937,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B004LWZWGK,G. Denick,"[1, 2]","I thoroughly enjoyed all three of Nolan's Batman movies, though ""Batman Begins"" was my favorite- I simply enjoyed the concept of Bruce Wayne's training in a fortress of disciplined ninjas, as well as the unconventional, relatively unknown villains of Ras al Ghoul and Scarecrow. However, ""The Dark Knight"" was awesome (just not my favorite), and this third film does a fine job of completing Nolan's venture into Batman's world.I was actually putting off watching this movie, because I didn't want to commit three hours. But once I finally began it, I was sucked in, just as I have been with all of Nolan's movies. He sure knows how to open... the initial scene is quite breathtaking, and I have been continually impressed with how this series has introduced inventive, complex stunts that have never been seen before. Also, it must be mentioned- watching this on a big screen makes a huge difference!While I was initially skeptical of the length of this movie, the pacing is done so well that I didn't notice the exorbitant length of time that it ran for. For the most part, the acting is top notch (though Batman's combat seemed a little too telegraphed and slow this time around- perhaps because he's been out of the game for so long). The story was well told, and parts of it strongly reminded me of Nolan's presentation in ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"", which was pretty cool. He has a unique take on cinematography that nobody else has been able to duplicate, and his movies are a pleasure to watch- ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is no exception.",5,"Not my favorite Batman movie, but an incredible ride by any measure",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1545,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'favorite-', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'concept', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'training', 'fortress', 'disciplined', 'ninjas', 'as', 'well', 'unconventional', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'villains', 'Ras', 'al', 'Ghoul', 'Scarecrow', 'However', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'awesome', 'just', 'not', 'favorite', 'third', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'completing', 'Nolan', 'venture', 'Batman', 'world.I', 'was', 'actually', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'commit', 'three', 'hours', 'once', 'finally', 'began', 'was', 'sucked', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'Nolan', 'movies', 'sure', 'how', 'open', 'initial', 'scene', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'have', 'been', 'continually', 'impressed', 'how', 'series', 'introduced', 'inventive', 'complex', 'stunts', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'Also', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned-', 'watching', 'big', 'screen', 'huge', 'difference', 'was', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'length', 'movie', 'pacing', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'exorbitant', 'length', 'time', 'ran', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Batman', 'combat', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'telegraphed', 'slow', 'time', 'around-', 'perhaps', 'been', 'game', 'so', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'told', 'parts', 'strongly', 'reminded', 'Nolan', 'presentation', 'Memento', 'Prestige', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'unique', 'take', 'cinematography', 'nobody', 'else', 'been', 'able', 'duplicate', 'movies', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch-', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'exception']",The Dark Knight Rises

1418940,AOKS5JEGN6G,B004LWZWGK,genocidal_maniac,"[0, 1]","To start off, you're not going to get a Dark Knight with this movie. Which is a good thing. We've already seen Dark Knight, and it is spectacular.What you get, really, is an epilogue.This is the Godfather 3 of the batman movies.Batman Begins deals with the formation of the hero, just like Godfather 1 does. You see him struggle, his growing pains, him rising to meet challenges.Dark Knight shows Batman at the height of his powers. When he single-handedly disrupts the drug deal, that's in many ways like Michael Corleone demonstrating his power by saying, ""my offer is this: nothing, not even the fee for the license.""Now, when you are in the prime of life, things move fast. You make decisions, often out of arrogance, often without full information. In the 2nd of the series, the decision that Batman makes is to create a lie of a heroic Dent so that the criminals would stay behind bars. The decision that Michael makes is to kill Fredo.So now we arrive at the 3rd movie. Here we see them grappling with their decisions. Michael Corleone is wracked with guilt from killing his brother. He is saddened by the loss of his relationship with Kay. Batman is crippled due to the injuries sustained in Dark Knight. He mourns Rachel. He and Gordon are finding it harder and harder to sustain the lie of the heroic Dent.But the world doesn't stay still. New, younger and talented players enter the scene. Catwoman and Andy Garcia's character.Like Godfather 3, there's something missing from Dark Knight Rises. It doesn't have anywhere near the intensity of Dark Knight. The storyline meanders. The dialogue is missing a lot of its poetic elegance. There are a lot of ideas stuffed into here, and it's a bit much to digest. The actors too seem to have this smirking, ""look, I'm in a Batman movie"" attitude to them. Everything seems just a little bit slower in here.My biggest annoyance with the film actually is the new ""batwing.""The Tumbler is part of what made the first two films so effective. The Tumbler is a real car that can travel at 110 MPH. So in everything the Tumbler does, it's like an embodiment of the inspiration behind Nolan's take on Batman. It is where the rubber meets the road. It's all improbably, but not impossible. When you watch the Tumbler roar around, it's thrilling because it's real.The Batwing is impossible. It is clearly CGI. It cannot fly in real life. The aerodynamic shape of the thing, and the size of the thrusting fan, make this thing impossible to fly. you could say that the CGI Batwing is an embodiment of the Dark Knight Rises. It is a loss of creative discipline, as you see Nolan breaking many of his self-imposed rules, such as no Robin. At the same time, the Batwing...does have more capabilities than the Tumbler. It can literally soar higher. And so Dark Knight Rises is the grandest of the 3 films.The first two films are in my opinion better films.

Stealing a prisoner off an airplane. Batman miraculously recovers after barely being able to walk because his body is so worn out from crime fighting. The story line actually would have been better if it stayed with the storyline of the comic book it was based on. The Batman would have been older but still strong, with the kind of aches that come with the territory of aging. Instead we get Christian Bale, slumped over, with a goatee, as a virtual cripple. The bad guy was completely boring and unintelligible until the end of the film, which is where all the bombs are finally dropped.

He never calls it in; he inhabits his roles as if he really is that person.All that said, in my humble opinion, this is the best Batman movie ever made.  The acting, the script, the casting, the CGI, cinemetography, sets, music, everything is absolutely flawless.  It's obvious from the first frame to the last that the utmost care went into getting this movie perfect.  Other reviewers have outlined the story, and even given some spoilers, so no need for me to tell you what it's about.  What you do need to know is that:  It's full of heartstopping, edge-of-your-seat, exciting action; it's got a great story with an evil bad guy, Bane;  it's touching and emotional, with a final resolution that brought tears to my eyes.I saw The Dark Knight Rises in the theater with my Grandson and Son in Law; bought the DVD as soon as it was available and have watched it several times since then (4? 5?) and each time I've gotten something new from it.  It's a story of redemption, renewal, and resolution.  It's a story of extreme determination to overcome, and of finding the strength and will to heal, and get up to fight another battle and then giving it all you've got, and doing it again until you do overcome the evil.  We so need a Batman.  We need heroes who will, no matter the cost, keep fighting until the bad man is no more.  That's what The Dark Knight Rises is about.And it's our last Christian Bale Batman movie.  It's a fitting coda to his run.",5,10 stars!,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,2152,"['OK', 'confessions', 'first', 'First', ""'m"", 'total', 'Batman', 'fan', 'superhero', 'topnotch', 'just', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'evil', 'own', 'power', 'special', 'superhuman', 'attributes', 'Well', 'yeah', 'have', 'really', 'cool', 'toys', 'only', 'Batman', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'one', 'Clooney', 'guy', 'puhleeze', 'Second', 'confession', 'think', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'seriously', 'hot', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'top', '5', 'actors', 'today', 'DeNiro', 'Hackman', 'Neeson', 'Pacino', 'From', 'silly', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'Prestige', 'Machinist', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'Bale', 'movie', 'going', 'give', 'everything', 'got', 'never', 'roles', 'really', 'person.All', 'said', 'humble', 'opinion', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'acting', 'script', 'casting', 'CGI', 'cinemetography', 'sets', 'music', 'everything', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'obvious', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'utmost', 'care', 'went', 'getting', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'outlined', 'story', 'even', 'given', 'spoilers', 'need', 'tell', 'what', 'about', 'What', 'do', 'need', 'know', 'full', 'heartstopping', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'exciting', 'action', 'got', 'great', 'story', 'evil', 'bad', 'guy', 'Bane', 'touching', 'emotional', 'final', 'resolution', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes.I', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'theater', 'Grandson', 'Son', 'Law', 'bought', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'then', '4', '5', 'time', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'something', 'new', 'story', 'redemption', 'renewal', 'resolution', 'story', 'extreme', 'determination', 'overcome', 'finding', 'strength', 'will', 'heal', 'get', 'up', 'fight', 'battle', 'then', 'giving', ""'ve"", 'got', 'doing', 'again', 'do', 'overcome', 'evil', 'so', 'need', 'Batman', 'need', 'heroes', 'who', 'will', 'matter', 'cost', 'keep', 'fighting', 'bad', 'man', 'more', 'what', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'last', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'movie', 'fitting', 'coda', 'run']",The Dark Knight Rises

Those films were kids comics, with bombastic sets, funny set pieces, and ridiculous characters that adults could also enjoy.Don't get me wrong, I love the Nolan ones; unfortunately, Kids will hate the Nolan ones! This is a problem.Now, the first Christopher Nolan Batman was, off course, excellent; but the second on got too stupid. That one, the one with The Joker, tried the be so real, like the realism in the HBO series, The Wire; with gangs and scary black guys. In that Joker instalment, there was even a big black gangster with a Detroit accent that was obviously inspired by The Wire. However, in real life, a guy with a painted Joker face would get his brains blown out of his cranium, no doubt, they would do that thing right! People shoot you in the face in gang-land, you see, especially if you wear face paint and plastic trousers, and Nolan's Batman is full of plastic trousers and gangsters and geezers who would kill you in a second if you crossed them. Realism demands guns and blood!This is the problem with these films. If your gonna go all veritas and post-modern then you have to go the whole hog. You can't have the evil one beating up a load of pigs and the pigs not shooting you in the face, you see. Where is the comical imagination?These films try too be too realistic and this is why the critics get all hot and wet over them, like silly girls. In this third instalment there is even loads of Ayn Rand philosophy, like the kids will understand that one and Michael Cains character is no longer a butler, but instead, Michael Cain is now a father figure to Bruce Wayne, with plenty of 'I fear for your safety Bruce' and 'I'm there to pick up the pieces Bruce'. This has the unfortunate effect of turning the Michael Cain character into Bruce Wayne's gay lover. Really, watch the film to see for your self!Also, for a film that is trying to be gangster-wild, there is no swearing in the Nolan films, just like in the old A Team series, no one really gets killed and there is no blood, like in the old A Team series.It is still a good film mind, and the cat woman character is great and the other woman is also great!

The Commissioner's anti-crime Dent Act has put a serious crimp on organized crime. It's been eight years since the Batman was last seen, eight years since he was accused of murdering Harvey Dent and the Commissioner allowed the lie in order to serve the greater good. Except there is no dearth of cowardly, superstitious lots. On the rooftops of Gotham and in the secret dens of the priveleged, an elusive cat burglar begins to prowl. And, compelled by a terrifying agenda, the zealot Bane begins to exert his insidious influence over Gotham City. It's been eight years since the Batman deemed his work done. But today his city is once more threatened. Retirement's over-rated.Never mind that one dude snoring away in the corner of the movie theater late Sunday night. Everyone else walked away fairly impressed. Christopher Nolan has done a wonder. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES caps off one of the best ever cinematic trilogies. Put it right up there with the original Star Wars trilogy and the Lord of the Rings and the Indiana Jones and Toy Story franchises. Is it perfect? No. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is a tour-de-force but with a few flaws, a masterpiece with scuff marks. It's still unmissable.Eight years after the horrific climax of THE DARK KNIGHT, we catch up with a hobbled Bruce Wayne. Wracked with guilt over his inability to save Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, Bruce has abandoned the Bat suit. Once regarded as Gotham's favorite son, Bruce has become an eccentric recluse, his wealth steadily seeping away. This allows Michael Caine's faithful butler Alfred to deliver several emotional motivational speeches. And maybe one of them finally resonates with Bruce. He straps on a brace on his busted leg and steps out. Whispers of a monster named Bane circulate, and Bruce, who had shied away from his base of operations, ventures down to the Batcave. Good thing he'd long ago installed an advanced copy of Windows 2010, because, even after eight years of neglect, the Batcave's computer system is still cutting edge stuff.Okay, plot SPOILER in the last sentence of this next paragraph.Nolan applies elements of BATMAN: YEAR ONE, KNIGHTFALL, and NO MAN'S LAND to his narrative; longtime Batman readers can draw certain plot points from that. This film's scope is amazing. Nolan takes advantage of his near three-hours-long running time to tell a story that is rich and sprawling and occasionally breathtaking, never mind that the staff of JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine are probably rolling their eyes at how rapidly Bruce resolves his grievous medical ailments in such a constrained timeline. Unless, of course, you really can remedy a broken back just by pushing a protruding vertebra back into the spine.Nolan is masterful with the technical bits, from cinematography to sound to score to use of the color palette to help establish mood. We're watching a great director at the height of his powers. Let's enjoy this guy. The acting performances, as expected, are across-the-board superb. There were doubts going in about Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, but remember that people also scoffed when Heath Ledger was cast as the Joker. Hathaway pulls it off. She makes a convincing Catwoman, although no one ever calls her that in the film. I like her character arc, although it's an obvious one. She lends depth to the role, serves as a fantastic foil for Batman. I love Selina's quicksilver personality shifts and that she's razor sharp with her delivery, and that she comes across as equally playful but dangerous. Hathaway's is miles ahead of Halle Berry and Michelle Pfeiffer's interpretations. Hells, she may even be the film's breakout character, although Joseph Gordon-Levitt's resourceful rookie cop also effortlessly commands the screen.In the excessive neck snapping portion of the discussion, I predict that Tom Hardy's ominous big bad will be the most slighted performance. But Hardy exudes presence, and, contrary to the early trailer, I understood most of his dialogue. But why did Bane have to go out with a whimper? He deserved a bigger finish.THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't as good as THE DARK KNIGHT. How could it be? As solid as this cast is, no one reaches the sublime heights of Ledger's Joker. But this is a deserving finale that, judged on its own merits, achieves its own measure of brilliance. Nolan had ""epic"" in mind when he closed the books on his franchise. His Batman is traumatized and gets put thru several kinds of hell. Even Frank Miller wants to give him a hug.There are scenes heavy on exposition, yeah, but only rarely did I feel they were slow. There are at least three twists in the third act, one of which we see coming from jump. But never mind. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES meets expectations but doesn't exceed them. Predictably, it combs the darker psychology of the superhero. It's even a bit of a social commentary. It is brooding. It is epic. Its scale is ambitious. It builds its hero into a grand mythic figure. It's not as ""fun"" or bright as THE AVENGERS, but it's as equally rewarding and, at times, goosebumpy. Okay, Christian Bale's harsh Batman voice still aggravates.Stay for the post-credits scene in which the Batman is in a diner eating shawarma.No, don't do that.",4,an honorable finish to one of the

Christopher Nolan is great as Batman in my opinion, as is Tom Hardy as Bane...I thought he did exceptional.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is always cool too, and Gary Oldman, also, is a fantastic Jim Gordon...he is without a doubt one of my favorite actors!As far as the plot line and everything, I won't go into too much detail about it, but I thought it was really well done and succeeded in being a great ""possible"" ending for this series of movies.  Again, there is speculation out there about whether or not there will be more movies, what with Joseph Gordon Levitt's character hinted at becoming Robin and the whole idea behind a possible move towards a Justice League movie and whatnot.  Who's to say?  Time will tell.The action scenes in the movie were very well done and just super epic!  There is a fun twist at the end of the movie too, when a particular character comes into light, and those who are familiar with the character whether from comics or playing the Arkham games, you'll be like ""Oh whoa...that person!""

1418980,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B004LWZWGK,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[13, 249]","The three main problems with this film and the rest of the series are 1. it is an awful adaption of Batman in which the people in charge of these films obviously did not like the comic books and it is highly doubtful that they actually read the comic books 2. live action comic book films do not work because human beings and physics cannot perform actions that are depicted in the comic books, and 3. the animated films being released by DC Universe Animated Original Movies company make this Batman series and other live action films look very boring.I do not understand the praise for Christopher Nolan because he is not that good of a director for this series. He does not film shots correctly. Two examples of poor filming are when Bruce's parents are killed in the first film and when Two Face would flip his coin. During the murder of Bruce's parents, filming should have made the robber appear to tower over Bruce and use an upward angle aimed at the robber. The scene should have ended with Bruce kneeling in-between his dead parents looking down at the street. As Two Face flips his coin, the camera should have done a close up shot of the coin flying through the air and landing on Two Face's palm. None of these techniques were done. Also, this Batman series and the rest of the live action films do not film enough shots that mimic comic book story panels and comic book angles. The closest live action film to have down this is the Matrix and that has been almost 15 years ago.The adaptation of these films are horrible because it focuses way too much on the mob as villains. This in turn has caused writers to strip down very important Batman villains and produce villains who are no longer what was portrayed in the comic books. The writers also give far too much background on Batman and give way too little background information on the villains and their motives. This happened with Scarecrow, it is going to happen with Bane, and it is clear it will occur with future villains this series brings forth. Scarecrow should not have been some whipping boy and he should have been the main villain in the first film. Bane should be Latino, buff, very smart, and he would require a trilogy where each film is close to 3 hrs with non-stop action. These facts are clear to anyone who has actually read Batman but it is clear that a majority of this series' viewers have not read Batman. They do not realize that this series is not really Batman, but an evil mob series with characters who have the same names of characters from Batman who sometimes show some sort of physical characteristics of Batman characters. But this series is not Batman.Since this film is live action, it dramatically falls short of Batman's full potential. Human beings and natural physics do not allow the proper display of the Batman world. It then requires way too much computer generation that is very easy to spot and the use of way too much talking that slows down the story and produces a film that is way too long. I do not understand why film makers do not just computer generate the whole film and make it look as life like as possible. Then the action scenes and film shots could properly display what is depicted in the comic books.The only films that are currently giving DC characters their proper justice are the PG-13 animated films that are being released directly to DVD by the film company: DC Universe Animated Original Movies.What makes DC Universe Animated Original Movies so good is the fact that they are being made by true fans of comic books. Those film makers obviously have read more than ten issues of the comic books, and so they adapt the films that correctly follow the mythology from the comic books. What is then produced is a PG-13, 90 min animated film, and that film is non-stop action voiced by amazing voice actors who bring to life comic book characters who are ripped straight from the pages of a comic book.

1418986,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004LWZWGK,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[10, 16]","Batman. Rarely is there a character that can inspire so much love and ire at the same time in the cinematic world. The more extremist cross-section of fans view co-writer/director Christopher Nolan's BATMAN films as ""too real"" and ""too boring"". Some of the critics reviewing this film feel this film, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES which is Nolan's finale to his epic DARK KNIGHT trilogy, is ""too unrealistic"" or ""too cartoony"" because of his brilliant and more realistic takes on the Batman mythology in the two previous films BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT. Basically, everybody wants their cake and eat it too with these films. However, if you truly look at this film for what it is and not what you think it should be or what you want it to be, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is still an excellent film and a perfect cap on the end of Nolan's BATMAN trilogy. It's also worth knowing that as you read this review, you will probably notice that I am something of a fan of Batman, not only these films, but the comics as well.The film opens with almost a similar epilogue to THE DARK KNIGHT, with Commisioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) espousing the virtues of Harvey Dent, who tragically had succumbed to grief and madness by the end of THE DARK KNIGHT and the murders he committed while in that state were covered up by Gordon and Batman (Christian Bale) in order to make sure that Harvey's reputation remained as pure as he was believed to be. This opening begins just one of the themes that this film will deal with throughout. Once that opening ends, we find that it has been eight years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT. Bruce Wayne, devastated by the death of his life-long love Rachel Dawes and hunted by the Gotham Police since he (as Batman) took the fall for the murders Harvey committed as well as Harvey's death, has become a recluse and is no longer Batman. Gotham is apparently cleaner than ever because of the systematic removal of organized crime and imprisonment of over a thousand offenders due to a municipal law called The Dent Act. There is still discontent amongst the populace and that is represented partially in the daring and sultry cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). She represents some of the downtrodden of Gotham who feel that people like Wayne have far too much when so many more have so little. It is also represented in Officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an idealistic young police officer and an orphan like Wayne himself who sees behind the veil of lies perpetrated by Gordon, but with a different perspective than one might originally think. And most surprisingly, it is represented in Alfred (Michael Caine), who has been Bruce's most loyal confidante over the years as well as his father figure who sees no future for Bruce as Batman other than death. Unfortunately for everyone involved, a new villain comes to town in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a masked steel-eyed hulking predator with a mind for war and a desire for destruction. Wayne, finding some new purpose not only due to a specific crime perpetrated by Kyle (who, while costumed similarly to the comic character of Catwoman, is never referred to as such in this film) but also in the form of Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a woman who represents hope for Gotham in the assistance of funding a fusion-powered renewable energy prototype and also as a potential love interest, once again dons the cape and cowl to fight the chaos that Bane seems to be trying to bring to Gotham. In a brutal fight between the two, Batman comes out very badly on the losing side and is cast out of Gotham into an underground prison in a distant land; the very prison Bane was born into, as we find ties into BATMAN BEGINS with the more we learn of our new villain and how he knows Batman's true identity. Upon returning to Gotham, Bane begins his ""liberation"" of Gotham as we see a terrifying display of city-wide destruction that separates Gotham from the rest of the world and the same device Wayne Industries planned for Gotham's salvation has been retro-fitted for its destruction. Meanwhile, Bruce has to watch as Bane holds kangaroo courts for Gotham's priviledged and its protectors which ultimately leads to execution or exile across its frozen river, and as he watches, he begins to feel the fire rising within himself once again as Gotham's race against time is coming to a close.It's obvious that Nolan (and his co-writer brother Jonathan) found inspiration in two, maybe three very important works of the Batman comic mythology; the most obvious being KNIGHTFALL, which was when we first were introduced to Bane and his epic battle with Batman; also NO MAN'S LAND, where Gotham has been deemed an isolated island city-state of sorts; and somewhat with Ed Brubaker and Darwyn Cooke's reinvigorating of CATWOMAN, where she was still a femme fatale jewel thief, but also was a guardian for those that were considered expendable by Gotham society. All of these elements are on display here, and done in a far superior and more emotionally-charged way than what was in the comics (perhaps with the exception of the Brubaker/Cooke work on CATWOMAN, which was brilliant).I have to admit, despite the brilliant, genre-defining work Nolan had done previously with Batman, I was a little less than enthused to see Bane as the villain of the film when it was announced. He was someone I felt originally that was a bit of a one-trick pony; a new character created solely for the purpose of upsetting the status quo. As years went by, Bane had been given more of a back-story with more motivation and some of that characterization is brought to vivid life here by Nolan's storytelling and Tom Hardy's hypnotic performance. Bane's face is covered by that strange but purposeful mask during almost the entire film, but Hardy, having done incredibly charismatic and brutal work previously in films like BRONSON, INCEPTION and WARRIOR, brings a swagger, attitude and cruelty to Bane simply through his eyes and his body language. The addition of Selina Kyle to Nolan's universe also seemed equally fitting as someone who always SEEMS to be looking out for Number One, but ends up as having something of the proverbial heart of gold. Hathaway, who has been impressing since her work in more dramatic work in films like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and RACHEL GETTING MARRIED but has been primarily a staple of rom-com work with films like LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and BRIDE WARS, is on equal footing with the rest of the cast here. She brings a necessary dynamic with Batman/Bruce Wayne and moments of brightness and humor in this almost unrelentingly bleak film, but don't expect purring. Gordon-Levitt continues his run of tremendous performances he's been turning in since his revelatory performance in BRICK through THE LOOKOUT, (500) DAYS OF SUMMER, INCEPTION and 50/50, proving that he is rapidly becoming one of the great actors of his generation. Other Bat-verse newcomer Marion Cotillard sadly doesn't have as much to do here as an actress of her caliber should, at least not until the third act. It does seem like while Nolan was doing INCEPTION, he just asked if a lot of his actors would be willing to make this film too; hence Hardy, Gordon-Levitt, and Cotillard.As far as the returning actors are concerned, Oldman continues to redefine his place in these films. He is, at least in part, the conscience of Batman, but in this film, there's a very deep weariness he evokes because he's partially corrupted himself in order to serve ""the greater good"". Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, and has some strong moments, but there's not many moments here for him to sink his teeth into. Caine rounds out this trinity of Bruce Wayne/Batman's most trusted friends, and gives a more raw and emotional Alfred than we've seen in the past. He is much less the wisecracking and wisened Merlin to Bruce's King Arthur, but is the voice of regret. He doesn't see Batman as a failure, but he loves Bruce too much to let him continue on with that life. But the film ultimately belongs to Bale. This is the most emotional and most complex Bruce Wayne/Batman we've seen yet, and he brings him to very vivid life in this film. At the film's opening, he's bearded and gaunt-looking. He's become so much more damaged from the result of the last film that he feels he's lost everyone he loves and believes could give him a normal life. As stated in THE DARK KNIGHT, he doesn't want to be Batman for his whole life, but for better or worse, it's part of who he is.The film as a whole is a tremendous achievement thematically, dealing with a lot of things you don't see in a big-budget summer release: things like economic disparity (keep in mind, though; this film was in production before the whole ""Occupy"" movement began, but because of the economic crises in Europe and the U.S., it was definitely something worth approaching) the corrosive nature of the truth and the fall of a city from without and within.The film is also, and not unusual to expect of Nolan, a technical marvel. From the incredible skyjack opening sequence to the city beneath Gotham to the hellish decimation of the city to the desolation that follows and pretty much every frame of the third act, it's all incredible to watch and breath-taking to behold. The action to this film is also far more visceral than anything that the Batman films have presented in the past. In the two major confrontations of the film between Batman and Bane, every blow is felt (some much more so than others), and the fight choreography is more of a street brawl rather than a MATRIX-esque gravity-defiant martial arts melee, but there is one scene with Batman and Catwoman taking on a gang of thugs that is much more graceful in its choreography. The effects work is particularly effective on the practical side of things. Very few moments feel like they needed to be CG'd, but the moments of the destruction of the football field and surrounding areas, and all the sequences involving The Bat, an airborne version of the Tumbler, are pure gold.But there are problems too. The first significant problem is us as the audience and Nolan as the director of a Batman film post-THE DARK KNIGHT, which I firmly believe is the best film of the last decade. I saw the entire marathon showing at a local theater and found how amazingly simple it was to sit through THE DARK KNIGHT after seeing it a few times in the theater before and countless times on Blu-Ray and TV. We have the expectation of seeing something better than THE DARK KNIGHT and it simply isn't going to happen. Just as we hoped each subsequent film in every popular trilogy or series of films would improve (of which there are several examples in genre filmmaking), it rarely ever happens. You will never get another Heath Ledger as The Joker. We expect more than we get, and that's on us too. Another problem is that there is a LOT of story here. You have several different tales being told with several different characters and several different themes, and certain sacrifices are made in order to tell those stories, usually at the cost of character and honest dialogue. There are times where it does feel that there's almost too much story for just one film......but I can't truly fault a film for being TOO ambitious when there are so many films out there that are just floating along with just the ambition to make good money. Nolan fills the screen to a point that is evocative of a film of the silent era. There very rarely even needs to be dialogue; you can tell so easily what's going on just by looking and watching and that's a huge testament to Nolan's abilities as a storyteller and the actors and how superbly they play their roles. But if this were a silent film, you might miss out on the dangerously percussive score by Hans Zimmer, who is sadly without his former Bat-film musical collaborator James Newton-Howard, but there's still everything you need from this films' score and more. It's not nearly as quiet and unnerving as the score for THE DARK KNIGHT, but this is a film of a much grander scale. And that brings us to the word for this film: EPIC. The Dark Knight Trilogy has been an epic of storytelling; It gives us the beginning, middle, and end (?) of the tale of The Batman, and all of the films reflect the character at moments in his life that are natural in this cinematic universe Nolan has created. And as with any three-act structured story, it's only logical that the third act be the climax of the tale, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is that climax. It's bigger than either of the previous films, it has a wider scope on screen and in storytelling, it's more exciting and there's much more at stake here. This is a finale of a trilogy, and anything goes. Lives will be very possibly be lost. Even the hero of our trilogy isn't safe, and that makes the stakes higher than the previous films; Nolan is a smart enough filmmaker to make you afraid of the ending.And yes, the final act of this film more closely resembles something out of a Batman comic book than just about any moment of any of the previous films. It is no-holds-barred. Nuclear annihilation is imminient. The entirety of Gotham is trapped on its island. Only a few stand between Bane and the total obliteration of Gotham City. Who will live? Who will die? And most importantly, will I as an audience member leave the theater satisfied that this epic has come to a conclusion?Now be warned: This is not THE AVENGERS. The levels of sheer glee that you may have felt during that film will not be omnipresent in this film, but there will be moments that you will want to stand up and cheer. And there will be moments that will devastate you.After waxing linguistical about this film, these three points are ultimately all you need to know:A: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is very much a Christopher Nolan Batman film.B: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is THE finale to Christopher Nolan's Batman films.C: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the perhaps greatest final chapter in a trilogy of films ever.",5,"While not a

1418997,A96HX2NEJTG5A,B004LWZWGK,Jay,"[2, 4]","Let me begin by saying I am a devoted Batman fan.  I know the material, the games, the gadgetry, etc.  So if my review comes off a bit too harsh or perhaps too critical, it is only because this is one character I notice when something isn't done right.  That being said, let's begin...This is by far an excellent movie.  All of the elements that make an epic concluding tale are present; definately on the level of the second installment.  This movie will, and by no means is this an understatement, literally have you watching anxiously until the very end.  But like any movie, there are some plot holes, in this case not major, and in no way will they take away from the overall plot or film itself.One - Bane's voice.  Really, Bane in general, let's get down to the foundation.  Bane by way of the comics is a foreigner, some say spanish, some say brazilian, doesn't matter, just either way he's not a white guy.  I'm not racist nor do I intend to come off that way, but I personally feel in cases like this, when it's clear that you have a non-american character, and you can easily get one, Hollywood cheaps out and just throws the role to a white guy.  Tim Hardy-excellent actor.  And as Bane, convincingly terrifying.  But the accent just wasn't there.  I mean honestly, it sounded more like ""Jack Ryan, you've just boarded the Red October!""....Sean Connery.  And the muzzle only made it worse on the ears.  So now you have a British accent that's drowned out by the latest facewear from the SPCA.  So by far, I recommend SUBTITLES ON when watching.Two - Catwoman, rather, a feminine cat burglar as I believe she's described in the film.  Anne Hathaway was an okay addition to the cast.  Would I have casted her as Catw...*ahem* a female cat burglar? No.  Selina Kyle is among the sexier, perhaps among the sexiest characters in the DC universe.  I apologize if I sound sexist ladies, but that being considered, I don't see Anne Hathaway as a sexy woman.  I see her as, the girl who had it rough in Devil Wears Prada, or the innocent little princess, but not as a sex symbol.  Not that that is all Catwoman is about, but it is what you expect considering her character.  Her perfomance was okay, just not sexy.  And I don't feel it was just for her to. . . I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen the movie.  But let me just say that was Batman's place to take care of....""that situation"".  And the overly long kiss at the end?  That was just bad timing.Three - No mention whatsoever is made of Joker.  Not even the tiniest reference.  And this point may be unimportant at all, but for the damage he did to the city and to Bruce's pshyche, they could have at least said something about, I don't know, ""Glad they managed to keep him in Arkham all this time"", or something like that to let the audience know he didn't just stay hanging upside down indefinately.  Also, Bruce Wayne's magical brace?  Come on.Four - Last and final point, and this one is a spoiler alert so don't read ahead if you can't handle it.  But the character of Robin John Blake was a bit stretched.  You were able to deduce Batman's identity by the way he came into an orphanage?  Riiiight.  And in the event that the saga continues, Robin is a sidekick character, thus the Batman and Robin series.  Where could you go with him?  I'll tell you where, Nightwing, or even better, a Batman Beyond.  But now I'm trailing off topic.Other than the above, I have no gripe against the movie whatsoever.  The movie is simply epic.  Inspiring at times, tragic in others, but surprising throughout.  Especially that one big one.  Ultimately, I will be adding this to my collection the day it comes out, and I suggest that you do the same.  You will not be dissappointed.",4,FOUR STARS FOR FOUR REASONS,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,3759,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'am', 'devoted', 'Batman', 'fan', 'know', 'material', 'games', 'gadgetry', 'etc', 'So', 'review', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'perhaps', 'too', 'critical', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'notice', 'when', 'something', ""n't"", 'done', 'right', 'being', 'said', 'let', 'begin', 'far', 'excellent', 'movie', 'elements', 'make', 'epic', 'concluding', 'tale', 'are', 'present', 'definately', 'level', 'second', 'installment', 'movie', 'will', 'means', 'understatement', 'literally', 'have', 'watching', 'anxiously', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'case', 'not', 'major', 'way', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'plot', 'film', 'itself.One', 'Bane', 'voice', 'Really', 'Bane', 'general', 'let', 'get', 'down', 'foundation', 'Bane', 'way', 'comics', 'foreigner', 'say', 'spanish', 'say', 'brazilian', ""n't"", 'matter', 'just', 'way', 'not', 'white', 'guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'racist', 'do', 'intend', 'come', 'off', 'way', 'personally', 'feel', 'cases', 'when', 'clear', 'have', 'non-american', 'character', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'just', 'role', 'white', 'guy', 'Tim', 'Hardy-excellent', 'actor', 'Bane', 'convincingly', 'terrifying', 'accent', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'mean', 'honestly', 'sounded', 'more', 'Jack', 'Ryan', ""'ve"", 'just', 'boarded', 'Red', 'October', '.Sean', 'Connery', 'muzzle', 'only', 'made', 'worse', 'ears', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'British', 'accent', 'drowned', 'out', 'latest', 'facewear', 'SPCA', 'So', 'far', 'recommend', 'SUBTITLES', 'ON', 'when', 'watching.Two', 'Catwoman', 'rather', 'feminine', 'cat', 'burglar', 'believe', 'described', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'okay', 'addition', 'cast', 'Would', 'have', 'casted', 'Catw', 'female', 'cat', 'burglar', 'No', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'sexier', 'perhaps', 'sexiest', 'characters', 'DC', 'universe', 'apologize', 'sound', 'sexist', 'ladies', 'being', 'considered', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'sexy', 'woman', 'see', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'rough', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'innocent', 'little', 'princess', 'not', 'sex', 'symbol', 'Not', 'Catwoman', 'about', 'what', 'expect', 'considering', 'character', 'perfomance', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'not', 'sexy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'Batman', 'place', 'take', 'care', 'situation', 'overly', 'long', 'kiss', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'timing.Three', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'made', 'Joker', 'Not', 'even', 'tiniest', 'reference', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'unimportant', 'damage', 'did', 'city', 'Bruce', 'pshyche', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'said', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Glad', 'managed', 'keep', 'Arkham', 'time', 'something', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'stay', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'indefinately', 'Also', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'magical', 'brace', 'Come', 'on.Four', 'Last', 'final', 'point', 'one', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'ahead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'character', 'Robin', 'John', 'Blake', 'was', 'bit', 'stretched', 'were', 'able', 'deduce', 'Batman', 'identity', 'way', 'came', 'orphanage', 'Riiiight', 'event', 'saga', 'Robin', 'sidekick', 'character', 'thus', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'series', 'Where', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'where', 'Nightwing', 'even', 'better', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'now', ""'m"", 'trailing', 'off', 'topic.Other', 'above', 'have', 'gripe', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'simply', 'epic', 'Inspiring', 'times', 'tragic', 'others', 'surprising', 'Especially', 'one', 'big', 'one', 'Ultimately', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'collection', 'day', 'out', 'suggest', 'do', 'same', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissappointed']",The Dark Knight Rises

Yikes, that's awful.) The plot twist, where we find out Bane isn't even the main villain, was quite possibly the worst thing Nolan could've done to us. It made little sense and felt completely unnecessary.The plot holes and continuity errors are very noticeable: the sudden shift from day to night after the Wall Street heist took me out of the movie for a few minutes, and why did Bane take Gotham City hostage for THREE MONTHS? Obviously it was so Bruce could have enough time to return, but Bane didn't think he would. It was a lazy plot device by the filmmakers. Everyone keeps praising Anne Hathaway for her performance as Catwoman, but I can't help wonder what was so special. She practically whispered every line in the movie and that's it.I've never liked Nolan's disrespectful approach to the material, refusing to use some of the best villains just because they're silly, never referring to Catwoman AS Catwoman, changing the Batmobile to some dumb, ugly tank. He nearly ruined Batman for me, especially with this sad last film and its cliched nuclear-bomb finale.

It gets a lot of flak because it had the tough task of following up The Dark Knight and Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker but this movie is a classic that will grow on people over time and stands on it's own two feet. It's really a first for Superhero films since it gives a definitive ending for THIS version of Batman which some fans may not have liked.Christian Bale is outstanding as usual but Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy both kill it as Catwoman and Bane. Hardy is the first Batman film villain to ever be a true equal to Batman in terms of physicality and mental skill. I know some people complained about being able to understand what Hardy was saying but I had no problem and I think if you just LISTEN and have the volume properly set you'll have no problem either. Hathaway IS Catwoman, hot as Hell and extremely tough and believably bad ass at the right moments. When she rides the Batpod there's no doubt that she got in insanely great shape for this role.

Batman may be outmatched this time though and needs the help of resourceful cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). As well as Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a promising young cop who's one of the only who believes Batman didn't kill Harvey Dent.The plot is much deeper than I make it sound but it's hard to get into more without giving too much away. Does the film live up to all the hype though ? Yes, since it is from Christopher Nolan and there is plenty of excitement and twists but Dark Knight was still better since this one is much slower. The strongest things about this one is the Batman and Catwoman scenes and Tom Hardy's intimidating and scary performance as Bane.However, despite being a really good film,  everything isn't wrapped up in one great package, 3 films isn't enough when so many villains were yet to be seen in Nolan's Batman films and there's so much more that could be explored, even the ending made me want more and when I say more, I don't mean a reboot.

Ledger was great...but not as &#34;Joker&#34; as he could have been (that's the fault of the writing).The Dark Knight Rises....What the HELL happened??? This movie is the epitome of a train wreck. It is poorly written and leaves gaping holes in a plotline that had become far to convoluted to begin with. It is mired in socio-economic platitudes (Occupy Gotham anyone??), has well known characters in Batman lore that are light years apart from their source material (not in a good way), and has little to no redeeming qualities that made &#34;Begins&#34; SUCH a great Batman film. While I understand and respect Nolan's desire to make Batman less &#34;comic book&#34; and more &#34;realistic&#34;, the realism has gone into the realm of the absurd, and for all the wrong reasons. An earlier one-star rating here did a much better job than I could in pointing out the glaring plot holes, but even with their laundry list..there's even MORE than was noted.I am a film buff. I am also a comic book fan. I understand fully the differences that are somewhat necessary to bring a comic book character successfully to the cinema. Naturally, a non-comic reading audience must be reached for it to be truly successful. However...As absurd and fantastical as a film like &#34;The Avengers&#34; was, it hit it out of the park!! Why? Because these are COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS. Nolan has taken this far too seriously as if to make some kind of statement, although I can't figure out what that statement is other than &#34;Um....I think I let this plotline get away from me, so let's just shoot it and put it out while my fanboys are STILL fanboys.&#34; There is nothing in this film that is even mildly true to the source material. This is NOT Batman by any stretch of the imagination. There isn't a likable character in the entire film (with the exception of Gary Oldman's brilliant Jim Gordon...the ONE character that is dead-on to the source material).All in all, it almost made me miss Joel Schumacher.

This movie is not only incredibly stupid but in all honesty, it does not feel like a movie. It feels like you're watching a series of small clips who seem to follow one another. The sequence of the movie is extremely poor and the watching experience is not smooth. Clips are just randomly thrown at you from all corners.One of my biggest problem with this movie was the dialog, none of the characters seem to talk like actual people. For goodness-sake, NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. Their conversations are incredibly abstract, unnecessarily deep, and cloudy. Each of the characters have a lot going on but none of it are things you care about. Whoever wrote the script of this movie needs to be fired asap.What's worst are the moral hazards supported within this film:1) According to cat-woman, its perfectly ok to steal from those who have more. Not taking into account that those who have wealth worked for it, and those who are poor don't produce much. Being poor is not an excuse to steal, it shows you are too lazy and impatient to acquire things the correct way so you resolve to robbing others for what they have worked for.2) The movie is socialist by nature. For it demonizes the wealthy as if they are rich at the expense of the poor. People are not rich by accident, one gets rich through smarts, efforts, and sacrifices that the poor refuse to do. No one gets rich by demand, the rich earned their wealth. To demonize rich people is a bad lesson to teach our young.3) Even though cat-woman is a low life untrustworthy thief, batman is into her and begs for her cooperation. (What kind of hero is that?)4) Bruce Wayne gets angry at Alfred (the man who cared for him his whole life) because he hid a love letter from a woman who clearly rejected him. That is totally not OK and ungrateful.5) The movie legitimizes that without a police force, poor people are barbarians who sentence the wealthy to death simply because of what they have. That is very condescending towards the poor.The list of moral hazards in this movie are endless but I rather not continue. The conclusion is that this movie subliminally teaches the public a very wrong and destructive concept of reality. Most Poor people are not barbaric savages waiting to jump on the rich the moment they get a chance, and most rich people are not snobby obnoxious individuals stomping on the poor to acquire and maintain wealth. In fact, the rich individuals are often the most productive and provide a wide array of benefits to the poor. Outside the moral hazards, there is very little intelligence behind this movie. In other words, the movie is plain dumb and stupid. It's a shame to see mainstream entertainment come down to this level.

Huge Batman fan here, but not an invested comic nerd who can't accept certain liberty taken upon the comic book mythos. Sigh. I despised this movie deep in my gut. For the record, I never brought Christen Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. His Bat voice was just annoying, and I loathed the costume. Loathed it.  Nevertheless, let me just talk about this movie. In a nut shell, it's boring, over long, pretentious, and has no internal logic. Yes, even in a comic book / sf world, you need an internal logic. Especially when Nolan goes on record stating this is a ""Batman in a real world"". This nonsensicalness is accepted because the false deity Nolan made it. Take off the ruby glasses people. Spoiler Alert>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>So Bane breaks Batman's back. Brings him half way around the world, and puts him in some underground prison. A montage of sit-ups, and with the help some eastern yoga guru, his back is fixed. Wow, all that was missing was the playing of ""Eye of the Tiger"". He then climbs out of the hole, (with a rope sitting on top, while the prisoners cheer him on) and heads back to Gotham. Meanwhile some cop who is standing in for the the Robin character, is taking down the bad guys by himself. The MacGuffin in the movie, is some computer program thing which can wipe one's history. Though the infrastructure of city is destroyed, so this program would be useless.Batman, who is supposed to be the world greatest detective, not only allows all this chaos to happen, gets duped by Catwoman, at least three times, and by Bane and by Ra's al Ghul's daughter. On his return fight with Bane, he engages him in hand to hand combat again, the same tactic which got his back broken the first time. Now logic would say, that Punch for Punch, Bane is stronger than Batman, so has the world's greast detective you think he would find another method to take him down. Sigh. It just gets sillier.

1419047,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004LWZWGK,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 6]","***This review contains spoilers***The title of this review paraphrases the question an exasperated Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) levels against Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) in ""The Avengers"".  Without hesitation, Stark coolly answers that he is an industrialist, billionaire, playboy, inventor, etc.  Of course, you could ask the same question of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) throughout the Dark Knight trilogy, especially the second sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (hereafter ""DK Rises') and essentially get the same answer, albeit without Stark's smug insouciance.  But is that all there is to Batman/Wayne - just the Gotham legend?  What about the man himself?  Who is he?  To my amazement, among all the Bondian plotting, intricate intrigue, nihilistic villainy, and apocalyptic despair, ""DK Rises"" manages to take a deeper peek into Wayne's soul than any other Batman medium and painfully extract more of his true, human essence.Unquestionably, the Batman character is a remarkable legend and symbol - resourceful, agile, nimble-witted, incisive, daring, and persistent.  But, in my opinion, for many of us, the non-superpowered Batman ironically suffered from Superman's impediment - he was too good.  Independently wealthy, and seemingly free from mere mortals' mundane concerns, Batman had the time to employ an almost endless panoply of weapons, gimmicks, and devices to indulge his ""favorite pastime"" - foil all his hapless enemies, even the most grotesque ones.  Batman was so charismatic that he inspired even his most implacable foes to ""play by the rules"" and defeat Batman fair and square.  True, he suffered the trauma of seeing his parents killed by hoodlums, but for a long time that was treated as just the catalyst for his transformation to Batman.  Except for that, Batman/Wayne led a charmed, cocooned, almost-bland life.  Wow, what a near-perfect presence Batman is, and how ""perfectly"" boring!Subtly, ""DK Rises"" evokes the inspirational aura of Batman by keeping him (for at least the first 40% of the movie) as a morale-boosting, if hidden, ideal for the citizens of Gotham, even if he was (wrongfully) implicated in District Attorney Harvey Dent's death.  But gradually, we see the frail, almost decrepit shut-in within the Wayne Manor fortress, doted upon by faithful, paternal manservant Alfred (Michael Caine).  Quite logically and understandably, Alfred has so far persuaded the aged Wayne to give up the Bat-madness and lead a more conventional, comfortable life.  But Bane (Tom Hardy), a cross between Hannibal Lecter, Marvel Comics' Juggernaut, and a WWF refugee, arrives in Gotham to insidiously lull and encourage the proletariat masses to oust their 1% bourgeois oppressors, then traitorously blow them up with a nuclear device almost no one can disarm. Before that, he must humiliate and crush Batman, first the spirit then the body.In a perverse way, in ""DK Rises"" it was gratifying to see Batman/Wayne at the nadir of his fortunes and clawing his way back. Incrementally throughout ""DK Rises"" he loses just about everything - his precarious health, an initial, punishing tussle with Bane, his vast financial resources, his palatial home, and even his freedom as the battered ex-tycoon is flung into a cruel abyss with other wretches in a nameless wasteland.  As we find out, it was the same abyss the orphaned doppleganger Bane inhabited until he finally crawled out.  The abyss is cruel not only because of its depth, but also because it offers a tantalizing, Sisyphean route to freedom.  If you can scale the walls and make a dangerous leap to a ledge near the top, you are free.  If not, back you go, alive because ropes support you but demoralized.  Wayne has no Batsuit, no nothing.  Does HE HIMSELF, the man, have what it takes to escape and return to Gotham to save it. (SPOILER: After many agonizing trials and ""Rocky""-style regimens, Wayne does escape that hell and return.)Besides the personal physical strength, it was also gratifying to see Wayne's humanity come to the fore.  We learn that he fights crime not simply out of an emotional vendetta or to fill the empty time.  The orphaned Wayne has always cared for the downtrodden - especially other orphans.  He sees to it that the orphanage he has self-pityingly neglected for so long gets renewed funding.  Personally, he listens to and aids fellow orphans -the upstanding, principled detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and morally ambiguous catburglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway)- in their individual crusades to be better, caring people and help turn the tide against Bane.  He does so with his words and by the example he sets.  In a second slugfest, the rejuvenated Batman floors Bane, but (SECOND MAJOR SPOILER) finds he is not the primary mastermind. The true instigator of the Gotham siege reveals that the nuclear device cannot truly be disarmed.  Gotham is doomed.  Batman hooks the device to his revamped Bat flier and soars out to Gotham harbor where the device detonates harmlessly, except for Batman/Wayne (maybe).  The device had a 6-mile radius of destruction.  Batman/Wayne could not have ejected beyond that in time.  Could he?  Batman/Wayne was certainly self-sacrificing, but is he a martyr?Whatever the outcome, within the senses-pounding, absorbing action, drama, and suspense of this ambitious near-epic, I think ""DK Rises"" proves that Bruce Wayne a complex, admirable, inimitable guy who doesn't need a suit to be a hero.(P.S.:  Again, perversely and paradoxically, I hope Batman/Wayne did not survive the explosion.  If he does, I think it will diminish the magnitude of his compassionate martyrdom and reinforce the old ""perfect"" Batman cliche.  I hope the corruption-weary Mr. Blake, a worthy successor, legitimately assumes the Bat-mantle and continues Bruce Wayne's legacy - as Batman, not as Robin, please (though I like Robin))(P.P.S.: I was somewhat disappointed that the menacing, mellifluous, and articulate Bane was somewhat reduced to ""second banana"" status in that ""real mastermind"" twist - just another muscular mercenary.  Can't a villain be super-smart, super-strong, AND a leader?)(P.P.P.S.: See this movie in IMAX if you can.  It will literally rock you!)",4,"Without the Suit, What are You?",1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,6241,"['***This', 'review', 'spoilers***The', 'title', 'review', 'question', 'exasperated', 'Captain',

1419048,A2BEPH0GY8531W,B004LWZWGK,"John R. Dizon ""John Reinhard Dizon""","[0, 0]","It was exceedingly difficult not to call this review ""Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time"", even though as of this writing it unquestionably is. Its predecessor in every way, The Dark Knight, held the title all the way up until the final scene of the final movie of the Batman Trilogy. It was there that Christopher Nolan crossed the line, took us to where no superhero movie director dared go. Doubtlessly there will be a slew of imitators after this, but we will forever remember this flick for Nolan having said ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""This one picks up where we least expected it, and psyched us out every scene thereafter. Bruce Wayne (Academy Award winner Christian Bale) is at the end of his athletic career as the Caped Crusader, with brain, liver and ligament damage after just a couple of years of Batmobiling. He finds himself the victim of an identity scam by Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway), aka Catwoman, who trades Wayne's stolen fingerprints for a bogus criminal record expunction. Bruce's prints are used by corporate raider John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) who usurps control of Wayne Enterprises, backed by the mercenary force of an ex-League of Shadows assassin called Bane (Tom Hardy). Both Bruce and wealthy philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) suspect Daggett's ambitions to extend far beyond the Wayne empire. They are proven correct as Bane cripples and imprisons Batman en route to taking Gotham City hostage under threat of a nuclear weapon. Batman manages to overcome Bane with the help of Catwoman (who does a face turn after nearly helping to end Batman's career), and Batman saves the day...well, unless you've been living in Iran, you know how this went down.This flick begins and ends with Bruce Wayne's death wish, knowing that Batman's luck will one day run out. Alfred (Michael Caine) knows it is coming, and resigns as Bruce's butler in anticipation of an imminent no-win scenario. Bruce loses his fortune, wrecks his body and nearly loses his life in a remote prison fortress, but forges ahead in search of that final blaze of glory. We heard the rumors but couldn't believe it, and even director Nolan leaves us some fantastic `what if' strands of hope in the final reel. Not happening, people. With four seconds to detonation, only Superman and the Incredible Hulk (and maybe the Philadelphia Flyers) survive a nuclear explosion.Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was an incredible stroke of genius by Nolan, who (it was rumored) nearly train-wrecked the series by bringing in Eddie Murphy as the Riddler. Catwoman (who was already flushed down the toilet by Halle Berry) promised to be as dismal a character as Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy, but Anne Hathaway made the save with the best female  performance in the genre since Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. Never once did she seem hokey or contrived, and her romantic interest in Batman went head-to-head with Nicole Kidman's unforgettable job in Batman Forever. As for sex appeal and the credibility of her fight scenes, Hathaway's performance is second to none.Granted, Bane was no match for the Joker, but Tom Hardy's swaggering, supremely confident arch-villain was superlative nonetheless. His soulless, unblinking determination put him in a Terminator class of mindless automaton self-programmed for one purpose: the mutual assured destruction of himself, Batman and Gotham City. Even though Bane was not the ultimate anarchist that the Joker was, his suicidal imperative resonated even more with the 21st century terrorist than the Clown Prince himself.

I liked ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" despite their numerous flaws.  But ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was almost ALL flaws.  It was clear to me that Nolan was coasting on his successes and didn't put any real work into this film, especially the script.A lot of people really like this film, but I can't help wondering if many of them aren't simply predisposed to liking it simply because it exists:  they are so happy to get another Batman film that they have lost their ability to be objectively critical of a flawed film.  But your mileage may vary, I suppose.  A lot of people liked ""Lost"" and that show was total garbage, so there's no accounting for taste, I guess.I can't recommend this movie, despite the nice Blu-ray presentation and a few nifty extras.  If this movie didn't have Batman in it, more people would see it for the lame piece of work it is.

The pacing was well balanced given the multitude of characters and the plot evolved nicely (although you really had to recall the first two movies for it all to fit together). The acting was fantastic for the most part and I was blown away by Hathaway's Catwoman in particular. (Anyone who says Hathaway's acting here is terrible is saying that based purely on not liking Anne Hathaway.) But at the point Bane takes control of Gotham, the movie REALLY drags. Instead of focusing on Bruce Wayne in prison, the focus is on the siege. Sadly, it's also at this point in the movie that Bane becomes uninteresting. So, 30 minutes could have been cut out of the movie here. During the siege we also see more of a focus on 'Robin' whose backstory is so reinvented, it's not even Robin anymore. As much as I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his role in this movie wasn't necessary especially when you consider there isn't going to be another Nolan Batman movie. I also didn't like the twist involving Raz Al Ghaul's descendent which felt like a last-minute, desperate attempt to surprise the audience. Bane should have been the sole agent of vengeance, as he was in the comics. Finally, how the HECK did Batman fly the bomb more than 6 miles out of the city in less than a minute? Sigh, flashes of the 1966 Batman movie. Like The Dark Knight before it, TDKR suffers from trying to do too much. At least Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow had a good cameo.

1419055,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B004LWZWGK,Joker,"[6, 12]","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...I'm fresh from the theater, having just seen The Dark Knight Rises.  For me, it's the second best movie of the three Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  These Batman movies courtesy of director Christopher Nolan are gritty, realistic, and have the feel of cop dramas, and The Dark Knight Rises is no exception.  This has both its positives and negatives, as I feel that these movies have little or no hint of being comic book movies, but at the same time, they are a new ""realistic"" take on the Batman character and the villains, so it's refreshing, I guess.  I'll put it this way - I like the Tim Burton movies the best, when when I'm in the mood for a more serious take on Batman, I'll reach for one of the Nolan movies.  This movie (as well as the others in the series) is heavy on violence.  This movie, I feel, is by far the darkest of the three in terms of atmosphere, grittiness, and violence.Anne Hathaway?THE.  BEST.  CATWOMAN.  EVER.She was superb as Catwoman.  Her looks, her attitude, her wardrobes, everything was great.  She totally kicked major you know what.  When it was announced in early 2011 that she received the role of Catwoman, the general public just said, ""What?  I can't see her as Catwoman"".  People couldn't see her playing Catwoman for the lamest reasons, such as the fact that she's been in comedies over the years.  Just because she's been in comedies over the years doesn't mean she can't play a serious role.  What people fail to realize is that Anne Hathaway's occupation is ACTRESS.  Actors are paid to ACT.  What does that mean?  Very simply, it means that the person should be capable of playing all kinds of different roles, in other words, be versatile.  Johnny Depp is a good example of this.  So many people seem to have a problem separating what an actor has done in the past with what they're currently doing.  It's a shame.  There is one scene in this Batman movie where Selina Kyle (Catwoman) is wearing a wardrobe that is strikingly similar to what Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) wore in Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961).  It has been known for many years that many people view Anne Hathaway as a modern day Audrey Hepburn, so I personally feel that director Christopher Nolan gave a tip of the hat to Audrey Hepburn through Anne Hathaway.  Her catsuit, I feel, was a tip of the hat to catwomen Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt from the 1960s Batman TV series on ABC Television and to Lee Meriwether, who played Catwoman in Batman: The Movie (1966).  I added one star to my rating of this movie simply because of Anne Hathaway alone.  Anne Hathaway has received praise for her role as Catwoman and has silenced her critics and doubters with her great performance.  Back in 2007, when the general public learned that Heath Ledger would be playing The Joker, people did the same thing they did when it came to Anne Hathaway - ""What?""  Then when the movie came out, people were blown away by Ledger's performance.  Personally, when it comes to live action Jokers, Heath Ledger is my least favorite between Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger.  My favorite is Romero.  However, I do give Ledger respect for his performance in The Dark Knight (2008).  When the public learned that Michael Keaton would be playing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1989 movie ""Batman"", people couldn't see him playing these roles and they threw a fit.  Then when the movie came out everybody shut up.  I don't know, people always seem to count chickens before they hatch.  People always seem to write somebody off early even before the person has a chance to prove his/herself.Tom Hardy did a great job as Bane.  I agree with a lot of other reviewers that a lot of the time it was hard to understand what he was saying with his electronically altered voice.  Other than that, his character delivered.  Christian Bale gave his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were good as usual.  Michael Caine was great as Alfred, as he was in the other movies.The musical score by Hans Zimmer is a big improvement over the two previous movies, especially when I compare it to the score of The Dark Knight.  The music isn't as repetitive as the music in The Dark Knight.  It is more epic and emotional as well.The overall story in this movie is on a much deeper level, more emotional, and with quite an ending, something I won't reveal in this review.  There are plots holes galore throughout the movie, but then again all three of Nolan's Batman movies have plot holes.  Also, there are things that don't make sense.  In the trilogy, Nolan made a lot of unusual changes to the whole Batman experience when it comes to the characterizations of Bruce Wayne, Batman, Alfred, The Joker, The Catwoman, etc.  A lot of the changes that were made have been hard for me and a lot of people to accept, at least initially.  I guess the best way to deal with it is that you just have to accept these changes and shift gears in your mind and tell yourself that these are Christopher Nolan movies and not comic book based movies.  I'll tell you one thing - if Bob Kane was still around he wouldn't like what Nolan did to the whole Batman universe he created.One thing that so many people complain about is the fact that Batman is fighting crime during daylight hours.  Gee, I didn't know that every crime out there takes place at night.  Batman is a crime fighter that answers the call no matter what time of day it is.  Let's see, Bane is up to his evil deeds during the day, but because Batman is a ""bat"" so to speak, bats are nocturnal, so Batman should only come out at night to fight crime.  A lot of people (especially the young people of today) have this same ""fighting crime in daylight"" gripe when it comes to the 1960s TV series.  How lame.  Where's common sense?If you want to see an interesting conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, then see The Dark Knight Rises.  This movie ranks second in my rankings behind Batman Begins (2005).  The Dark Knight (2008) is my least favorite.",4,The second best of Nolan's trilogy,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,6143,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'want',

I have been since the animated series blew my mind into a million pieces of awesome. I've also read comics, watched all of the animated movies featuring Batman, so to sum it all up for you, I know my Batman. This entire series was perfect. Executed like a swordsman. This last installment was not on par with the other two in my opinion in terms of combat choreography, but that is the only downfall to this movie. The story, actors and characters in this movie were spectacular! A easy ten out of ten for me. In this movie, you see a Batman that isn't as sharp as he use to be. You can tell in the way he fights that he is sloppy, sluggish and worn down but as always, Batman's never say die determination makes him surpass most brawlers, even in the expert level. Also Batman faces Bane, someone who is by far physically superior (but let me note that if Batman was in his prime, he would have beaten Bane easily) yet Batman through will and determination beat a terrorist with the skill and power to break him. Such intensity and obvious difference in this match-up made this movie so intense. To me it illustrates the struggle of life. Not just this movie, but the version of Batman that Chris Nolan brought to cinema. This movie series is about a man who says "" I will make a difference in this world, and nothing will stop me.""

Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and I love the cast, they were all great too. There was a lot of surprises that took place. I won't go into detail, for those of you who haven't seen it, but trust me it is worth it.I enjoyed this movie more than I did the other superhero movies this summer. The Dark Knight Rises was a masterpiece and Oscar worthy, compared to the superhero movies that were released this year, I am very impressed with The Dark Knight Rises.Anyways the fact that this has Blu-Ray, DVD and UltraViolet was enough to make me wanna own this version of The Dark Knight Rises. Don't listen to the reviewers that are complaining about UltraViolet, it's not as bad as they make it out to be. They're most likely iTune users, which I'm sure they can download their copy via iTunes, hence why it's not included in this package. That's the way they get their music, right? I myself prefer physical copies over digital, which is why all my CD's and DVD's are official store bought copies, but I love that the digital copy is included.Bottom line is that if you haven't seen this yet, but loved the first two movies, get it.

1419070,A1IIMZRF7G2JT7,B004LWZWGK,J.P Williams,"[1, 3]","After 4 Long years since Christopher Nolan once again broke ground with ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), I was somewhat disappointed with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012). While the acting from all the major and minor players is excellent, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was without dispute the best part of the film (I would have like the film to be more about her, Bruce and their relationship) and the action and vehicle pursuit sequences are better than ever, as well as a rousing performance from Tom Hardy as Bane, this film just didn't quite cut it for me. Too many problems with the narrative,(such as plot holes, and ridiculous plot points), the Miranda Tate subplot, The lack of music in certain places, in  and even the film's opening premise were all low points for this movie. I'm not saying that Nolan's ""Rises"" was a bad film, just one that could have been a lot better in the long run.The Opening Premise:The whole ""its been eight years since Harvey Dent died"" and ""Bruce has become a crippled recluse"" premise was in my opinion: Bad for business! Here's why: The main reason(to me) that Batman/Bruce Wayne has endured for 75+ years is the fact that as a character, he continues his crusade, regardless of the personal cost that comes from his actions. The start of film is upsetting to me as a ""Bat-Fan"". I paid to see Batman, not Bruce moping around Wayne Manor in silence, simply because he lost his girlfriend (who really was going to marry Harvey in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008)) and give up! It goes completely against his character, and if he is so crippled, than how was he able to fight bane at the end of the film? or even at all? With a ""magic knee brace""? (I know he re-trained himself, and ""learned how to be Batman"" again, this time just in a different location)Miranda Tate Subplot:I get that Miranda is an attractive, successful businesswoman (Marion Cotillard is absolutely gorgeous, obviously) but still why would she go out of her way to help and support Wayne and his police cohorts, only to backstab him at the end? (The Talia Al Ghul ""twist for twist sake"" wasn't handled too well, comic book fans like myself saw it even before the film premiered in theaters) and why didn't Bruce Wayne himself see that Tate was a member of the League of Shadows? He recognized that ""mark"" on her back in that scene when he is sleeping with her at his mansion? Right? It made no sense to me at all: Bruce is a highly trained ninja-like combatant with a brilliant mind, and he doesn't know that Miranda is a trained killer and strategist? Why is she suddenly the ""main"" villain, when Bane was running the show since the opening shot?TOO MANY PLOT HOLES!!!!(I'll just name a few)There are too many in this film to name in a single review!Bane just brings Wayne all the way to a pit prison just to taunt him and fly back to gotham? Why?How in the world does Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham all the way from another part of the world? (I know he's Batman, but he is supposed to be in ""Our world"") It just doesn't make sense!Alfred breaks up with Bruce and his crusade simply because he's going too far and completely disappears for about two-thirds of the movie? (despite another round of great performances from Caine and Bale respectively)Where did Alfred go? What was he doing while Bruce was trying to stop Bane and the Nuclear Bomb?What was the point of John Daggett? Why was he even in Gotham in the first place? If he hated Wayne so much, why didn't he just move to another city? Like Miami, New York, or even Las Vegas?How did the old prisoner medic manage to snap Bruce's back in place?Several of Bruce's attempts to climb out of the Pit alone would have killed him!How did Bane become so strong? What gives him his strength in the film, and how is he able to find Fox's armory despite it being ""off the books""? How did Bane find out where Wayne Enterprises or even Applied Sciences were? How did he know about the Wayne Enterprises Board, or even who Lucius Fox is?Hans Zimmer's score (despite the absence of James Newton Howard) is great, but why is it missing during both Batman and Bane fights (which in my view) would have added more emotional impact to both scenes? (especially the one in the sewers, where Batman gets his back broken)Overall, Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is still a good film. Gary Oldman gives a solid performance (being the best actor doing the best job in these films) as Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake was a stand out in the film (Blake seems to be more of the lead protagonist than even Batman is) My favorite scene is still when Bane kills Daggett and it sounds like he's getting tickled off screen! Priceless! I also loved the ""Bat"", and its flying sequences through the streets of Gotham. thoroughly enjoyed Bane blowing up Rogues Stadium and Hines Ward running away from all those explosions!  This would have made an even better opening, and given the audience with a real sense of what Bane is capable of; and why he is such a threat to Gotham. I Still can't get over Anne Hathaway as Catwoman! Her character was more in line with comics! She played Selina with a noticeable sense of style and sex appeal. Christian Bale is more than serviceable as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and he packs more of an emotional weight to his performance(with his Bat-Growl intact).  Finally, Tom Hardy's ""Bane"" was more in line with the graphic novels of the 90s, like ""Knightfall"" and ""Vengeance of Bane"". Bane isn't just a brute, but a master strategist, the kind of strongman that could also beat you in a chess match. The show trials were great! ""Exile, or Death?""  It should be noted: this is my final Batman film review.  I hope you fellow Amazon customers enjoyed my reviews, as much as I liked composing them.3 Out of 5 Stars.This film is still mildly entertaining. Watch when you get bored, or when you need an escape from a bad day at work.",3,"A decent, yet underwhelming film at times",1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,5886,"['4', 'Long', 'years', 'Christopher',

1419071,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B004LWZWGK,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It's hard for me to pinpoint the exact word to describe this film, so I'll stick with disappointing. After a year of teaser trailers and posters perhaps the film reached an unreachable level of hype. Maybe The Dark Knight set the standards too high on what this series could be, either way the final film in the trilogy is a let down.From the start Christopher Nolan put himself in a tight situation by choosing Bane as the villain. There isn't much to Bane and Nolan's version doesn't add anything special. Top that off with a muzzle that makes some of his sentences impossible to understand and you're left with a very boring character who seems to contradict himself with what his main goal is. Considering what he had to work with Tom Hardy's performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't groundbreaking either.Next we have Ms. Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway. Out of everything I read leading up to this release it was this character that people were most worried about. Many felt like Hathaway didn't have what it takes to pull off a sassy character like Catwoman, I think it's safe to say that she proved them wrong. Not only did she give a hell of a performance, but she looked damn good in that outfit.Then you have the most unexpected performance out of the whole cast from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This man is making his mark in the film industry and deserves every ounce of fame he gets from it. I wasn't expecting his character to have such a major role in the film, but his character John Blake was really something else. In short he's the only cop with a brain among thousands of others who probably can't spell their own name. Which, in my eyes, is a good reflection of the law enforcement in the real world. For every good cop there's a thousand worthless one's.The problem with Rises is not the acting, but the story. ""Batman Begins"" set the standard on what a Batman movie should be. Dark and gritty. Time and time again the Batman films tried too hard to be lighthearted and that's what stopped them from being great. Then they took everything that worked with Begins, improved it, and made ""The Dark Knight"". Every aspect of the film was improved on: the story, the villains, the plot twists, everything left you breathless. I can't tell you how many times I thought The Dark Knight ended only to be caught off guard by the excellent writing. That's all absent in this film.The thing is, instead of sticking with the formula that worked, they tried to go above and beyond that. That's why the story was so terrible, it was forced to try and replicate the complexity of The Dark Knight. They threw in plot twists alright, but they were all pointless. There was numerous times where I just found myself bored and I started looking around the room at random objects.They then proceed to add so many insignificant characters that I don't care about, and you shouldn't care about, and tried to make them into some complex piece of the story. Miranda Tate was, to put it bluntly, f***ing pointless. Realizing her insignificance they try to weave some deep story with her and Bane and it just winds up being a snore fest. Leaving us with an ending that felt forced because it was the last Batman film for Nolan. And don't even get me started on the Batwing... oops, I'm sorry, ""The Bat.""Overall Score: 6/10 - Had this been a standalone Batman title, I probably would've enjoyed it more. However, Nolan set standards for his Batman films, standards he wasn't able to meet. Having this be my most anticipated film of the year, only to be left with this... it saddens me. It's clear that Nolan was trying to top all the big sales that The Dark Knight reached, and it winds up being his downfall. A poor choice of a villain, and the small amount of screen time Batman actually received... I'm just at a loss for words at this point.",3,6/10 - A disappointing conclusion to what could have been an amazing trilogy,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,3884,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'exact', 'word', 'describe', 'film', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'disappointing', 'year', 'teaser', 'trailers', 'posters', 'perhaps', 'film', 'reached', 'unreachable', 'level', 'hype', 'Maybe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'set', 'standards', 'too', 'high', 'what', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'final', 'film', 'trilogy', 'let', 'start', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'put', 'tight', 'situation', 'choosing', 'Bane', 'villain', ""n't"", 'much', 'Bane', 'Nolan', 'version', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'special', 'Top', 'off', 'muzzle', 'sentences', 'impossible', 'understand', ""'re"", 'left', 'very', 'boring', 'character', 'who', 'contradict', 'what', 'main', 'goal', 'Considering', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'have', 'Ms.', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'played', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Out', 'everything', 'read', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'was', 'character', 'people', 'were', 'most', 'worried', 'Many', 'felt', 'like', 'Hathaway', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'pull', 'off', 'sassy', 'character', 'Catwoman', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'proved', 'wrong', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'give', 'hell', 'performance', 'looked', 'damn', 'good', 'outfit.Then', 'have', 'most', 'unexpected', 'performance', 'whole', 'cast', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'man', 'making', 'mark', 'film', 'industry', 'ounce', 'fame', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'character', 'have', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'character', 'John', 'Blake', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'short', 'only', 'cop', 'brain', 'thousands', 'others', 'who', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'own', 'name', 'Which', 'eyes', 'good', 'reflection', 'law', 'enforcement', 'real', 'world', 'good', 'cop', 'thousand', 'worthless', ""one's.The"", 'problem', 'Rises', 'not', 'acting', 'story', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'set', 'standard', 'what', 'Batman', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Dark', 'gritty', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'Batman', 'films', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'what', 'stopped', 'being', 'great', 'Then', 'took', 'everything', 'worked', 'Begins', 'improved', 'made', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'improved', 'story', 'villains', 'plot', 'twists', 'everything', 'left', 'breathless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'thought', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'ended', 'only', 'be', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'excellent', 'writing', 'absent', 'film.The', 'thing', 'instead', 'sticking', 'formula', 'worked', 'tried', 'go', 'why', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'was', 'forced', 'try', 'replicate', 'complexity', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'threw', 'plot', 'twists', 'alright', 'were', 'pointless', 'was', 'numerous', 'times', 'where', 'just', 'found', 'bored', 'started', 'looking', 'room', 'random', 'objects.They', 'then', 'proceed', 'add', 'so', 'many', 'insignificant', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'should', ""n't"", 'care', 'tried', 'make', 'complex', 'piece', 'story', 'Miranda', 'Tate', 'was', 'put', 'bluntly', 'f***ing', 'pointless', 'Realizing', 'insignificance', 'try', 'weave', 'deep', 'story', 'Bane', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'snore', 'fest', 'Leaving', 'ending', 'felt', 'forced', 'was', 'last', 'Batman', 'film', 'Nolan', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Batwing', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Bat', 'Overall', 'Score', '6/10', 'Had', 'been', 'standalone', 'Batman', 'title', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'more', 'However', 'Nolan', 'set', 'standards', 'Batman', 'films', 'standards', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'meet', 'Having', 'be', 'most', 'anticipated', 'film', 'year', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'clear', 'Nolan', 'was', 'trying', 'top', 'big', 'sales', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'reached', 'up', 'being', 'downfall', 'poor', 'choice', 'villain', 'small', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Batman', 'actually', 'received', ""'m"", 'just', 'loss', 'words', 'point']",The Dark Knight Rises

But my husband wanted to watch it, and so, here I am. What I loved about this movie was the story of humility and redemption played out so seamlessly from the last movie, The Dark Knight, you'd almost never know there were four years between filming them. Christian Bale was, for once, restrained and excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Until this movie, he just didn't do it right for me. But his fall from grace and resulting brokenness (literally) was some of his best acting.I loved Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman. She played her just right, not overly sexy, more scrappy and pulled in two directions - will she be the bad guy, or will she end up showing she can be redeemed? Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as Miranda, good friend of Bruce Wayne and supporter of Batman. I did not recognize one of my faves, Tom Hardy as evil as it gets, Bane, what an amazing performance from this gifted actor. And where were the Oscar people when this movie came out? Just shows how divided and out of touch Hollywood has become with us regular people in recent years. This movie deserved recognition!I won't put any spoilers in here, but let me just say how much I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the loyal cop, Blake. As always, Michael Caine turned in a difficult performance with his usual brilliance as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as well as Commissioner Gordon. Simply superb performances all around. But it was the story that was the hero in this movie. It could have followed a safer path, but chose a very difficult one, one instead. And for that, I gave this movie 5 stars.The franchise is successfully rebooted in a spectacular way (cue the fireworks) and I now am looking forward to the next movie, if there is one (not in the know all things Batman movies).

I especially disliked Christopher Nolan's &#34;Batman Begins&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34; But oddly, I liked this movie and it's mostly because of Anne Hathaway.The Dark Knight Rises is dark and while it tries to be complex, it comes across as bombastic instead. Batman has stumbled and when the movie starts, he's a hermit. And the movie's central theme is about him coming back to himself. But the movie takes great leaps on his way back. As much as I want to love Batman, Nolan's character continues to make me feel ho hum about him.The saving grace of the film is two things. One is Anne Hathaway. I'm usually indifferent to her in that I won't go out of my way to watch her films but won't avoid them either. For the first time, though, she became interesting. Her Catwoman is very dark and she hits the mark with her characterization, much to my surprise. She just might be the best Catwoman with a combination of flip, funny, and sexy. She's also has a hidden vulnerability that just peeks out on the film enough to let you know there's more to her.The second saving grace of the film is the expected ending.

1419120,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B004LWZWGK,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[2, 5]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act.But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.The cast led by Christian Bale (as Bruce Wayne / Batman), Michael Caine (as Alfred), Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Jim Gordon), Anne Hathaway (as Selina Kyle / Catwoman), Tom Hardy (as Bane), Marion Cotillard (as Miranda Tate), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as John Blake) & Morgan Freeman (as Lucius Fox) is brilliant. The directing by Christopher Nolan (who also produced) is brilliant. The story (based on Bob Kane's comic books) by Nolan & David S. Goyer & the screenplay by Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, is brilliant.The music by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is brilliant. The film editing by Lee Smith is brilliant. The casting by John Papsidera is brilliant. The production design by Nathan Crowley & Kevin Kavanaugh is brilliant. The art direction by Toby Britton, Kate Grimble, Zack Grobler, James Hambidge, Naaman Marshall, Jonathan Kevin Ong, Tom Still, Gerald Sullivan, Su Whitaker, Dean Wolcott & Robert Woodruff is brilliant.

Jones, Jason McDonough, Zach Selter, Randy Severino, Matt Stonish, Marisa Umsawasdi, Michael Vojvoda, John Warner, James Whelan, Robert Greenfield & Chris Withrow, set designs by Jason Kolowski & Emily Kwong is brilliant. The costume design by Lindy Hemming is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Tom Struthers, Sy Hollands, George Cottle & Monique Allen, fights arranged by Buster Reeves is brilliant.

Commissioner James Gordon has cleaned up the streets but framed Batman for the murder of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne/Batman went into hiding in Wayne Manor and becomes a recluse. Selina Kyle/Catwoman robs his safe- steals his mother's pearls and he chases after her. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman was more believable than Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry's portrayals in Batman Returns and Catwoman. Selina Kyle winds up working with Bane (the new villain in Gotham City) and lures Batman into a trap. Bane beats the crap out of Batman and breaks the ""hero"". Of course, Batman has to have a girlfriend, none other than what turns out to be a new bad guy, Miranda, who takes over Wayne Enterprises and turns the nuclear reactor supposed to provide clean energy to the world, into a nuclear bomb. Fight scenes later and dramatic interludes lead to the conclusion, which was open-ended. At least this trilogy didn't end the way the writers of LOST decided to end their series- lame.Chris Nolan is at his best with this one. The story makes sense for a simple girl such as myself (having never read a single Batman series comic book) to understand. Also entertaining. Bane made sense in this story, unlike in Batman Forever. What the f was that?! At least in this version, Bane wears the mask because his face was torn apart trying to save Miranda.

Don't get me wrong, it has some great scenes like the first face-off between Bane and Batman, how Brcue Wayne eventually climbs out of the pit.

1419141,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B004LWZWGK,Leonard,"[5, 13]","I saw Dark Knight Rises at the movies (twice) and on a bootleg DVD. I had to watch it 3 times to fully understand what was happening. Overall, it was a disappointment, but it wasn't the worst Batman movie (Batman and Robin still has that dubious distinction). It wasn't even the worst comic book movie of the summer of 2012 (Amazing Spider-Man).At 2 hours and 45 minutes, the movie was way too long. I nearly fell asleep watching it. It could've been condensed to 2 hours. Batman's voice sounded hoarse, like he needed lozenges. Bane's voice sounded even more ridiculous-it was a cross between Darth Vader and a James Bond villain. Bane was also too small- he wasn't much taller than Catwoman.Alfred was annoying throughout the entire movie. We get it- he doesn't approve of Bruce being Batman. He said the same crap in the first Nolan movie. As for Bane, his plot to destroy Gotham was similar to Ra's Al Ghul's plot in the first movie. I wish they were more consistent with Bane's comic book character.SPOILERAfter Bane pummeled Batman during their first confrontation, he tossed him into the pit. Bane didn't kill Batman because Batman didn't fear death. He feared being left in the pit while Bane destroyed Gotham. The pit was set up in a way where a person who wanted to escape had hope of escaping, but ultimately couldn't. In the pit, Batman randomly met some old philosopher dude. Batman's back had been broken by Bane, but after the old man punched the vertebrae back in place, he magically healed (even for a comic book movie, this was ridiculous). Batman then did some push-ups and sit-ups and was suddenly strong enough to fight Bane.During the final confrontation on Wall Street, the cops and Bane's minions were fighting each other like gladiators. Batman was winning his second battle with Bane when Miranda plunged a knife into him (which for some inexplicable reason didn't kill him). She then revealed that she was Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia and that Bane was her protector when she was a child. Catwoman, who had been a morally ambiguous character, helped Batman by shooting at Bane. Batman then used the Batjet to dispose of the bomb over an ocean. He then faked his death and donated Wayne Manor to some orphans. He was last seen in France. Alfred saw him and acknowledged, but didn't say anything to him. Batman deciding to retire and move to Europe is inconsistent with his character.I'm not the type of person who complains just for the sake of complaining. Many people complained about John Blake/Robin's character, but I found him to be interesting (though he definitely had too much screen time). This movie didn't live up to the hype, but it wasn't garbage.

A departure from the standard superhero dynamic - capping a dark tale of revolution, revenge and redemption.The story opens eight years after 'The Dark Knight'. After so much physical abuse, Bruce Wayne's body is completely shattered. No longer able to become the cape crusader, he's now a recluse who is never seen in public. And having accepted blame in the death of former district attorney Harvey Dent, his alter ego is branded a murderer and public menace, burying the truth about Two-Face to save the reputation and honor of a seemingly good man.Life, such as it is, goes on.Gotham without The Batman still trundles along; crime barely held in check by an increasingly overextended police force. Suddenly a new villain appears. However, unlike most of Batman's gallery of baddies - this one is more than just a linear plain vanilla thug or emotionally damaged lunatic. He's a man on a mission. The question is what mission? And most importantly, why does it require Bruce himself, not The Batman, to be humiliated and broken?Echos of Ra's al Ghul.Bearing the scars of imprisonment and deep social damage enters Bane. And his goal is nothing less than challenging the notion that a ""great"" city like Gotham is nothing more than a societal fac&aacute;de - that the true nature of humanity is one of selfishness and brutal opportunism; that nobility, charity and sacrifice are artificial self-serving constructs.Bane and his supporters are going to reveal the fraudlent mask of civility by tearing it off its collective populace.'Rises' spins off of a convoluted and overly lengthy tale, and despite some visually jarring edits and minor elements of melodrama which rang false, Nolan ultimately delivers a satisfying film. One that I suspect fulfills and defines the superhero genre for a modern, more cynical world. By crafting a tale which delves into the heart of heroism and the people whom are recipients of such, the potential to find the hero in oneself and in others becomes a powerful coda for Nolan and Bale's triumvirate of celluloid work.No costumes, no training. Good people standing up to evil. As simple as that.Finally, does anyone still curse the name Joel Schumacher? When I look back and see the immense accomplishment of the Nolan/Bale vision of The Dark Knight, I can't help but hope in a brighter future for all comic book sourced productions.Personal Note:I would be remiss not to express a minor disappointment that Nolan didn't choose to go with the canon approved Lucha Libre form of Bane.Although I haven't read a comic book in nearly three decades, I've been a huge fan of DC Animated for many years. And that interpretation has been a favorite. I so desperately wanted to see the character as depicted in the incredibly enjoyable ""Knight Time"" or ""Over The Edge"".Again, I wasn't unhappy with Nolan's choice of movie direction.

The movie is good, there are moments where you will be shock and amazed.For me what ruin the movie a bit was almost all the scenes and the interaction between the characters was rushed. You barely see Batman fight in hand to hand combat in the movie. He spends the majority of his time in some type of vechicle and you barely see him in the movie too because the main focus is on Bane.When it comes to Alfred I always thought of him as someone who would stand by Bruce's side no matter what. Not in this movie though.They didn't need a romantic interest, Rachel already filled that spot and now that she's dead there's no purpose for Bruce to suddenly fall in love with someone in one day i.e. Talia.I wanted the movie to end with Batman saving the day and being recognize as a hero to Gotham (being alive) and him standing on top of a tall building watching over the city. Batman does saved the day and he is seen as a hero to Gotham but he has to fake his death in order to do that and that sucks.

But the acting and the characterizations around the bad story were often well done. When the film was successful, it was successful in spite of itself.As far as the story goes, a bunch of one-dimensional villians organize a conspiracy of breathtaking nonsense. None of their motivations make any sense at all. None of their plans really seem to have much purpose either. For the most part, the plans simply exist to create a contrived situation where the forces outside the city that would intervene in such a situation cannot intervene. Nolan's three films have all had the problem that most of the leading antagonists are insane nihlists. This one is no exception. Given the material, I give films like this a degree of latitude in terms of story. But the main plot in this film just crossed way over the line.But on the other side of the coin, we are presented with an excellent characterization of a man in a state of mental, spiritual and physical decline. A fighter who is past his prime and has to start solving problems in other ways. He has to recognize his own limits. He has to move on. Everyone mostly tells him this but he doesn't listen. We get the literal fall of the man and then his reconstruction. All mostly well done with the exception of having him come back physically brawling toward the end as if nothing had changed. In my opinion, he needed to evolve to a point where he was outsmarting people rather than trading stand-up punches with them but it never happened. But still all-in-all good drama within the otherwise ordinary action film.I liked the twists in the story. I'm not going to spoil them, but they did a good job with things often not being what they seemed.Anne Hathaway turned in an excellent performance as well. It was another character along the lines of reaching a dead end (in this case a criminal career) and having to change but resisting it. Her character was played smart (mostly) with understandable motivations.Gary Oldman (as usual) also put in a good performance. He played a sympathetic fanatic which isn't easy. And bringing back Cillian Murphy as the ""judge"" was a nice touch though they didn't really seem to point it out to the audience.Nolan also deserves credit for carrying his three films on the character to a satisfactory and I hope final conclusion.

1419170,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B004LWZWGK,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 4]","The level of anticipation and hope surrounding this movie has been beyond the pale. Already, backlash against negative reviews from fans who haven't even seen it has caused major changes over at Rotten Tomatoes, and by now everyone's heard of the horrific events at Colorado. Even in Seoul, I witnessed yelling fights, crying, and at least one person telling his friends, in all seriousness, that he didn't want to hear anymore joking about the film since ""this was something they should take seriously.""The story of Batman is one that lends itself to grimness, that much is true, and this latest installment is no exception. In fact, it is arguably the darkest of the trilogy, all of Batman's ""rising"" notwithstanding. The film picks up eight years after the second. Batman hasn't been seen since the death of Harvey Dent, both Bruce Wayne and his businesses are noticeably crippled, and although Gotham City seems to be experiencing a (relatively) strong era of peace, it is based on a lie that Commissioner Gordon can barely bring himself to tell over and over again at public functions.Enter: Bane, a beefed up anarchist with an intelligence that's probably on par with his max bench press. Bane's troubling influence begins causing serious challenges that Bruce Wayne feels compelled to rise to meet, and along the way he encounters some of the same old faces (Fox and Alfred), as well as a few new ones (a brash young cop named Blake, an equally brash & young cat burglar named Selina, and a beautiful energy investor named Miranda). Our hero doesn't rise as smoothly as one might hope, though. His corporate enterprise is on the verge of collapse, and he must contend not only with Bane but also with a public that has long-since scapegoated him. He's beset on all sides, and the clashes -- emotional, spiritual, financial, and physical -- begin to overlap in a slapdash, nearly exhausting way. Viewers hoping that the movie will provide a sort of moral rifle scope will be disappointed, and why not? When a building collapses, it is impossible to trace the path of every crack that appears in its foundation, and when the movie hits its grim, second act finale, the only thing that's really clear is that things are about as bad as they can possibly get.There's no sense in giving away where things go from there, although I will say that the movie starts to hone back in on what really gives the Batman ethos most of its juice: the conflict you get when revenge pretends to be justice, when a would-be-noble-savior finds his greatest motivation out of hate and fear, and whether or not a world is worth saving when it seems perfectly willing to sacrifice itself for a present and momentary safety. In spite of the film's sprawling script and wild-n-wooly plotting, the end result is crisp, clever, and satisfying (without succumbing too much to the Traditional Happy Ending).It's too bad, however, that so much is lost in translation. Give the film a good post-viewing musing (or watch it a second and third time), and serious flaws can be seen in quite a few places, most notably Bane and his story arc. I've since had Batman-philes tell me that all of these supposed plot holes are ably explained by the comic books, but people have got to start realizing that adaptations of books are not supplements to those books. They are (or should be) self-contained. If I have to go read a book just to understand that book's movie, then the movie has failed. Likewise, there are some serious fudges in a few of the film's timelines (let's just say that, on more than one occasion, the film pretends like some things -- even small things, like landing/boarding/taking off in a plane -- take far less time than they really do).Ultimately, the film suffers (if not mildly) from a common Third Movie Flaw, which is the attempt to spread the audience's sympathies over far too many characters. Instead of providing rich and compelling conclusions to the tales of two or three people, we are asked to empathize with something like over half a dozen completely different people. There's just not enough butter for the size of the bread that this film holds out, and as a result, the movie lingers on people you don't care about (Modine's Police Chief Foley) and gives unforgivably short shrift to major names (Bane's story is dismissed so cavalierly that it plays like visual whiplash).Overall, I would call it a satisfying film, but its own pomp is meant to inflate too much more than it should (this is even evident in the Hans Zimmer score, which is so over-the-top in places that it seems to be mocking the emotions that it is meant to impel). No doubt many will find it a bit sloppy and hard to follow, and others might feel like, in spite of its 150 minute run time, the movie is oddly insubstantial. Then again, maybe Nolan was just trying to put as much in as he could for his coup de grace, and I don't fault him for that. The end result is certainly worthy of its placement in the Nolan/Batman oeuvre, even if it feels like Batman only rises long enough to have time to wave goodbye.",4,Batman Rises Long Enough To Wave

Unlike Dark Knight, I get Ultraviolet or nothing. I'm not going to be sucked down into the debate pit about which format is better. I prefer iTunes but others might like the new Ultraviolet. This disk is part of a flotilla of titles that have been Ultraviolet only - just to avoid a small iTunes charge. And with the exception of Deathly Hallows, the studios have been unwilling to trade leaving me with a format I can't use. I prefer supporting the entertainment business through many Blu-ray purchases but the studios should know that limiting options only encourages more people to torrent sites which is bad for everyone.

This one, Dark Night Rises is perhaps the best one. In all the movies there is always New gadgets, New vehicles, and there is always ""The Hotties"". I think this one was superior to the others, in that the Batman is vulnerable in ways as never before...Oh sure, The Batman is always taking a licking, but this time he couldn't just go to his bat belt, or Robin, or BatGirl his bat friends, before, he always came out on top. But in this latest one, Batman (and Christian Bale is my favorite at the role) has practically given up after the death of his beloved in the last movie...for the first time, Batman can't just grab a gadget or dramatically fly away, this time he is nearly beaten by himself...great stuff! I loved it! I loved the characters as well. Jane Hathaway fills in the best role of HOT-TEE! As well as being the mysterious Cat Burgler/ Woman Ever!  You have to watch it at least three times to catch all the good stuff going on off centre. Bale is always good in anything he plays in, and Morgan Freeman...?  How old IS that guy!? But he, too,  always plays a good character. He's like everybody's ideal president, grandpa or something, even made a great God in Bruce Almighty!

1419210,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B004LWZWGK,Micheal Hunt,"[5, 15]","When I first caught a glance at the trailer for this film, I thought to myself, ""Why the heck is the Batmobile flying?... this movie is going to be terrible"" but then I caught the next trailer of Bane blowing up a football field and I thought, ""It might be OK after-all""? Flying from Bali to Australia, I had 5 hours to kill, and we had hired an Ipad to watch movies on, and this movie was the one I was looking forward to the most... I dunno, maybe I expected it to be a major blockbuster just as good as the first two Batman movies of this directors imagination, but third time turns out to not be a charm for everyone.The Dark Knight Rises or Batman 3 doesn't start off too well as Bane and his men hijack a plain to kidnap a nuclear physicist. The scene is ok, but doesn't create a mind blowing beginning to a movie. The background scenery was nice, the idea was there, but it felt rather too unrealistic to be possible to happen in the real world, and what made it worse was no more action comes along in the movie for quite some time from then. The plot of this movie takes place 8 years after the last movie. Bruce Wayne has hung up the Bat Cow and retired into his own misery. Which makes me wonder if spin offs of Bat Girl are going to be the next set of movies to come along of what happened in that 8 year gap? Anyway, Bane comes to Gothom City and tears up the joint, forcing Batman to get back into shape and hit the town again. Bane uncovers an unused speech from Commissioner Gordon that reveals the truth about Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent and exposes it to the city during his ""blow up the town"" campaign. The kid from ""3rd Rock from The Sun"" is a hot headed police officer who idolizes Batman and knows who he is... no big secret by now even if you haven't seen the movie, but heard people talking about who he will be most likely playing in the future spin off. Also Catwoman joins the adventure, and tho some people have dismissed her as not being hot enough to play Cat Woman, I did like the fact that she is a cat burglar, and thats how she adopts the name... and that's about the only decent idea I think this movie had.Batman calls upon Morgan Freeman once again to show him some nifty gadgets the army made a prototype of, but never used, even tho they work so perfectly! This time Batman has a flying machine that has enough firepower to take out a Tumbler! 3 or 4 to be precise! Holy Cow Batman, i'd slap Morgan Freeman around for not showing you that thing sooner! Like I said before, it looked stupid to me in the trailers, but when you realize this flying vehicle may be slightly plausible on the way it operates as a hover copter sort of vehicle, you can suspend belief for a moment and accept it, but then when Hollyweed get there dirty little paws on it and say, ""Lets have it act like a jet plane with enough firepower to blow roofs off of buildings"" well, yeah... you're pushing it too far and trying to hard to make a kids movie more than a teen or adult action flick.What Bane does to the City and the speeches he gives are just... I wish I could swear on here to express my utter disgust in just how embarrassing it must have been for all the actors and crew of this movie to see the final results. Bane's speeches and voice is just eff in g terrible. Catwoman was a pretty disappointing role too. It wasn't her look or acting, infact I liked that the look was more like the 1960's Catwomen of Lee Meridith, Ertha Kitt and Julie Newmar (however you spell their names). But it was the script she was given that failed to satisfy fans. Especially the ending.Any fans of Stargate excited to hear that Christopher Judge makes an appearance (Teal'c), expect to be VERY disappointed in the 12 seconds he is on screen. Obi Whan Kenobi stops by for a flashback, and The Scarecrow has a brief moment or two for some comic relief. The rest is filled with a story that could have been so much better than the over the top rubbish that was filmed and exposed here in Dark Knight Rises Eventually.Overall, the weakest of the trilogy. Too much talking and boring dialog, stupid speeches and not much excitement. This bat has flown high, gotten tired, stopped flapping, gone into a noise dive and crashed pretty hard into the ground... oh, and ""trilogy?""... nah, I expect Penguin and Riddler will be next, gotta help set up Robin and Batgirl for the spin off's, probably even set up Huntress and make 6 spin off movies, then combine them all for one big Bat Marathon of Super Bat Avengers taking on all the bad guys that aren't dead yet.

1419216,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B004LWZWGK,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Any Batman fan knows what the state the of the franchise was (movie wise) after Batman and Robin. Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Dark Knight rises not only brought it back from the dead, it outdid Tim Burton's movies (both of which were very good). What Nolan did best was never treated the story as strictly a superhero or action movie, and as such did not take many of the easy shortcuts (see the Transformers movies) that many of those movies can take.While I do not think that any character in this movie came close to being as good as what Heath Ledger did with the Joker in Dark Knight, I do think all the actors played their characters well, and they were all well written. I did not have as big an issue with Bane's voice as some. Granted I found I could understand him better seeing it the second time than the first. I also think they did a great job of tying in the other movies (especially Batman Begins) to this one whether through flashbacks or bringing back some of the other characters. I also thought Anne Hathaway did a very good job as Catwoman. She definitely played the ""out for herself"" role well, and balanced the kind of good, kind of bad that the character called for.My only issue with the movie is that there were a couple editing spots where Batman would have literally had to have been two places at once. When he saves Gordon after the ""trial"" and then saves Blake moments later is the big one. Nor is it ever explained how Bruce gets back to Gotham City after he escapes from the prison, which given what happens earlier in the film should have been no easy feat.That said, I think they did a good job tying up Christian Bale's part of the story. The ending certainly left the possibility of future movies open, and I am sure the studio wants to do more of them. Hopefully if and when that decision is made whomever is put in charge will follow Nolan's approach and focus on quality acting and writing, and blend elements of realism into it when possible.

Never been more glad that I saw a movie in the theater.  There was an interview with Christopher Nolan a year before this movie opened.  He asked ""how many good third parts to a trilogy can you name?""  He went on to talk a little about ""Return of the Jedi"".  I think he studied the heck out of that movie and the Star Wars trilogy in general.  And he learned a good lesson.  I think he saw the trick with the structure.  ""Jedi"" is really nothing more than the plot of the first Star Wars (Episode 4) rehashed, only done on a much larger scale with better effects sequences.  ""Rises"" is identical in overall structure and basic plot as ""Begins"" -- right down to a mirror surprise ""reveal"" just before the climax.  But here's the trick: no way is ""Jedi"" as good a movie as ""Episode 4"".  ""Rises"" is not only every bit as good as ""Batman Begins"", but in many ways it's better.Two things stood in the way of my loving the second installment: 1) as good as Heath Ledger was, that was not the Joker as I think of him -- sure he was menacing, but there wasn't a joking bone in that performance -- and funny can (and should in his case) be scary too; and 2) there's not one rousing sequence in the entire movie -- yeah, bring on the seriousness... but this is Batman -- shouldn't I have a little bit of fun watching it?I found everything about Nolan's adaptation of Bane to be utterly frightening.  The effects are nearly flawless in sequences that are among the most rousing I've seen in a long while.  And on top of that, I had originally felt the title to be one of the weakest I'd heard in years.  It seemed like a cop-out.  Why not just call it ""Batman Rises"" to tie the trilogy together?  It seemed as though it was a lazy marketing ploy to cash-in on the tremendous success of ""The Dark Knight"".  Okay... so, I was wrong.  By the end, not only had Nolan made perfect sense of his title, but even improved my opinion of the previous installment.The quality of the transfer is excellent, and this is one of those special blu-ray discs -- in that the sound is something special.

1419223,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004LWZWGK,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[5, 9]","I've spent a lot of time mulling this picture over as I wanted to check several Batman graphic novel references before reviewing (see TRIVIA & SPOILER section below).For starters this trilogy this does not disappoint and it's an awesome and indelible finish to arguably the best Batman movie series ever. Yeah, I enjoyed the Michael Keaton/Tim Burton take on Batman but the quality dropped each movie thereafter to the point in which it was as ridiculous as the old and goofy Adam West TV series (you can watch them on the Web or syndicated TV). It wasn't worth watching by the third installment but I digress.So it's 8 years later and crime seems to have diminished in Gotham but Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale once more) is in isolation (still on a cane per his injuries in the previous picture) and in emotional mourning for the loss of his alter ego. But if that was it, well, we wouldn't have much of a story so a new supervillain, Bane, shows up and at a later point captures Detective Gordon (who is carrying a guilt ridden note over the cover up in the previous film) and begins a devious plan which will call up The Bat once more.Meanwhile, Wayne's emotional mourning is reflected in his outside world with Wayne Enterprises close to bankruptcy as it tries to develop a fusion reactor. Then, Bane strikes and puts Gotham into nuclear peril and nobody is just walking away from it.What follows is Bruce Wayne's voyage from broken man to the Batman most of knew and loved in the first picture. This is more of a mental journey than one of physicality.In fact, even though this tale focuses more on Bruce Wayne than Batman it also gives scenes to the supporting cast and their inner turmoils. Selina Kyle a la Catwoman is played by Anne Hathaway who does an impressive job of switching personalities on the spot as needed. Alfred Pennyworth plays the loyal and only remaining ""family member"" to Bruce Wayne and is emoted by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is back as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is Gordon and Tom Hardy plays Bane (who felt subdued compared to the Ledger take on Joker).Yes, that was  Cillian Murphy playing the unmasked Scarecrow (did you see the bits of straw in his hair?) who was one of the death judges. Matthew Modine has a small role but does a credible job as Foley who in the end makes the right heroic decision. I would surmise that the Talia character (played by Marion Cotillard) was perhaps the least engaging of the bunch. I should mention that Blake, an up and coming detective, is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.I have something to say about the thematic elements but I am going to put it down in spoilers as my information is a minor spoiler. You can probably read it without being spoiled by the movie and it might even give you a better perspective but I can see a few ""sensitive"" types whining.Overall, this is Sterling Silver quality and therefore tremendously satisfying for a trilogy well concluded (I already said it but wanted to hammer it in again). I'm very pleased that this graphic novel based character was executed as a serious work and done exceptionally well. Now, I can point non graphic novel readers to it just like I point non fantasy readers to LORD OF THE RINGS or GAME OF THRONES.SOME TRIVIA PIECES (Wiki and IMDB sources): the Batman suit consisted of over 110 separate pieces and several had to be remade during production. Cinematography was intended as raw and gritty. The Batman cowl was sculpted from Bale's face. Bale is the first actor to portray Bruce Wayne in three Batman films. Jessica Biel and Keira Knightley both came close to playing Catwoman. Almost 10,000 extras were used at the stadium scene.Christopher Nolan said that this film's theme deals with ""Pain"". For Batman Begins, it was on ""Fear"", while The Dark Knight deals on ""Chaos"".  According to producer Emma Thomas, the filmmakers elected to shoot the film in Pittsburgh to emphasize Gotham's immense size and scope and because ""they literally shot every inch"" in Chicago, where the previous two films were shot.  Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy. Cotillard started filming two months after giving birth.  According to costume designer Lindy Hemming, she took two years to design Bane's coat; it was inspired by a Swedish army jacket and a French Revolution frock coat, to make Bane look equally dictatorial and revolutionary, ""like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together as he passed through some very remote places.""  Bane's theme is a chant which features the term ""deshi basara"", which is Moroccan for the word ""rise"".When Selina Kyle disappears from a rooftop, Batman's remark ""So that's what that feels like"" is lifted directly from the DC graphic novel ""Kingdom Come"". Even the circumstance is similar, except it was with Superman.  In the film there are a total of four Oscar winners: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, and four Oscar nominees: Anne Hathaway, Gary Oldman, Tom Conti, Liam Neeson.  Bruce Wayne's doctor visit in which the doctor lists off all the degenerative injuries to his body (lack of cartilage, scar tissue, etc.) and the use of a mechanical knee brace both are reminiscent of Kingdom Come, where an older Bruce Wayne requires the use of an exoskeleton to move due to years of physical wear and tear on his body.Each movie from the Dark Knight trilogy is 12 minutes longer than the previous one (Batman Begins is 140 minutes, The Dark Knight 152 and The Dark Knight Rises 164).  The Lazarus Pit/Bane's prison scenes were shot in the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan. (India). In the comics, Batman visited India to learn how to control his pain.  Though the fate of the Joker is never revealed in the film, the novelization does mention his whereabouts in passing: he is the lone resident of the newly-rebuilt Arkham Asylum, held in solitary confinement and thus has no one to ""play with"" as ultimate punishment for his crimes.  Although used to soften a landing, this is the first movie in the Batman ""Nolanverse"" where the cape isn't used to glide.  Patrick Leahy:  US Senator from Vermont cameos in the movie as a Wayne Enterprises Board Member. Leahy, a fan of Batman, previously cameoed in The Dark Knight and Batman and Robin.The budget for this film after tax credits was $230M and so far it has made ONE BILLION at the Box office.CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; ACTION SCENES/SCOPE: A to A plus ; THEMES/BATMAN FOCUSES: A minus to A ; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2012 (at the movie theater); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.SPOILERS/THE MOVIE: As pointed out by ""Filmkiller"" and a few other movie reviewers the whole trilogy deconstructs the role of a hero and challenges the typical belief that we must rely on one heroic person or a group to save us. In the second film the incident between the two boats demonstrated the people of Gotham becoming the heroes of this trilogy as well (remember when both boats refused to blow each other up and mucked up the Joker's plans?).However, the cover up at the end of the second film demonstrated Batman and Gordon were willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they felt the people of Gotham could not handle it and arguably that sometimes people need to be lied to so that their hopes are kept up.But then in the final movie of the trilogy you see Alfred telling the truth to Bruce Wayne about Rachel choosing another man over her and that Wayne is going to die if he keeps at being Batman.The high casualty rate for the police of Gotham as well as many other people arguably made this the darkest of the three Batman movies. That said, the police of Gotham (which includes a doomed Foley played by Modine) step up and deal with taking their city back.I would argue that Wayne trusting Selina and then forgiving her and having a relationship with her is arguably not true to the graphic novels but I suppose you could argue this was the early Batman who was not so cynical and suspicious.SPOILERS/THE GRAPHIC NOVELS (several of these are my own ideas and then further down are from IMDB.COM)Christian Bale has stated that he would not play Batman if Robin appeared anywhere in the trilogy. Christopher Nolan agreed not to include Robin as it would undermine the dark tone of his series. At the end of the film, Detective John Blake's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) legal name is revealed to be ""Robin"", and he quits the police force and is shown to enter the Batcave by following the instructions presumably left by Bruce Wayne in his will.In the graphic novels just like the movie Bane really did break Batman's back. In the graphic novels another person took on the Batman mantle while Bruce Wayne recoveredGotham Occupied similar to ""No Man's Land"" when villains became judges to execute people and the law went into hiding, which included Gordon.Catwoman and Batman didn't really have a serious relationship as far as I could tell but it wouldn't surprise me if some alternate universe DC take did something with that romance. The biggest issue in the graphic novels is that Wayne simply didn't trust Catwoman and she rarely proved herself as more than a temporary ally.Robin had an unusual intro which makes me think that actor might be carrying the series forward as Nightwing (the superhero name the first Robin took after he left Batman).In the graphic novels Talia and Wayne had a child named Damian (who would become one of the Robins later) and Wayne at one point has mixed allegiances. In this film Talia is more of the bait and switch element.In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic as he is in chronic pain. (IMDB)The filmmakers cite the ""Batman"" comics 'The Dark Knight Returns' (an aged Batman operates in a future Gotham), 'Knightfall' (Bane pushes Batman physically and mentally, causing him to burn out) and 'No Man's Land' (Gotham descends into gangland territory and are cut off from the rest of the US) as major influences on the film.  (IMDB)When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time after the stock exchange robbery an older policeman tells his younger partner to ""sit back, you're in for a show"". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""  During the fight between Bane and Batman in the sewers, Bane lifts Batman above his head and drops him across his knee. This is a direct parallel to the first fight between Batman and Bane from the comics where Bane broke Batman's back during the ""Knightfall"" story line.  (IMDB)At the end of the movie when Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is exploring the Batcave, his black jacket has a blue stripe that dips in the middle on the back of it. This is very reminiscent to the character Nightwing, who the first Robin eventually became.  (IMDB)In addition to the numerous elements from the ""Knightfall,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" and ""No Man's Land"" storylines, the film also borrows from the ""Legacy"" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra's Al Ghul's successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.  (IMDB)The villainous character portrayed by Liam Neeson Ra's Al Ghul, who died by the end of the first movie, makes an appearance before Bruce Wayne's eyes, claiming to be immortal the whole time, only to be revealed as a hallucination. This is a reference to Ra's Al Ghul's comic book counterpart in which the character IS immortal by the use of Lazarus Pits.  (IMDB)In all three Nolan Batman films, the spiked gauntlets on Batman's arms prove essential in defeating the main villain. They shatter Ra's Al Ghul's sword in Batman Begins, disarm the Joker in The Dark Knight and damage Bane's mask in The Dark Knight Rises.

1419229,A1845IJB63D5H7,B004LWZWGK,"Mohamed F. El-Hewie ""Mohamed F. El-Hewie""","[0, 9]","Even on Monday evening, the movie theater dedicated six overlapping shows of Dark Knight Rises, all of which remained occupied, even the late night shows. Many viewers appeared to have gone to the theater for the first time judged by people standing in the hallways during the show unaware that their actions were unusual and disruptive. Others kept giggling for the slightest funny clips which do not usually attract people's attention. Soon, it became clear that the movie played wisely on avoiding nasty contents, profanity, drugs, smoking, and sex, and thus attracted the widest segments of society. Even old grandpa and mamma showed up in such crowded shows.The theme of good versus evil continued throughout the two and half hour duration of the movie, with paradoxical scenarios where corrupt government officials succeeded in getting away with evil conducts by deception and conspiracy while the good evil failed through its vigilante plots and radical view on curing governmental corruption. Bane's Gotham's reckoning plot amplified a narrow spot of the dark mind of Osama Bin Ladin in a high tech action show. Apparently, the League of Shadows played on individual physical skills without the coherent organization of believers. Bane was ruthless mercenary who frightened his closest associates except sole woman whom he protected. Thus, the story of the movie diverted entirely into superficial physical action of a giant muscular man without attempting to establish his base beliefs or support of believers.The early part of the movie was not well-thought. The episode of hijacking a CIA airplane over Pakistan entailed very boring and silly dialogues. Three masked people were allowed on the airplane without proper identification, then they confronted with a sleazy CIA agent who acted foolishly conducting unintelligent conversation. ""Was getting caught part of your plan?"", ""congratulation, you got caught"", ""are you a big guy?"", ""if I pull this mask .."", were few dumb statements made by the CIA agent.Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)would show up soon after Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway)sneaks to his private reclusive room and steals his mother's pearls. Anne Hathaway was truly a lousy fit in the movie with her deformed chest cage and hunched back which preclude her from performing the acrobatic actions of her role as Selina Kyle. The repeated fabrication of Selina Kyle's actions by cheat clips rendered her a liability to the movie.In contrast, Bruce Wayne  was the main character which kept the atmosphere serene,reasonable, and engaging. Aside from Bruce Wayne's docile and eloquent character, his role as the Batman was removed as much as possible from extreme fictional depiction into a reasonable character bent of concealing his identity rather than wearing the Batman mask and suit to breach gravity or violate the laws of physics. Batman, here, was a freedom fighter or vigilante utilizing high tech gadgets in advancing justice in the face of corrupt incompetent government.Flying away with a fusion neutron bomb, for the sake of saving the civilian population from nuclear annihilation was tried before in Indian movies, where the hero rushes for the energized bomb and attempts to removed it to the open sea before its detonation. In this American movie, the Batman and masked underground warlord might appeal to the mindset of the American viewers bent on glorifying impressive physical outlooks rather than the quality of the character. But, Bruce Wayne was however a great character despite his funny mask. He always forgives, remains focused, rises above trivial distractions.Alfred (Michael Caine)was a disastrous choice with ineligible accent, incomplete pronunciation compared to Fox (Morgan Freeman), who has the same age as Alfred. In such impressive movie, Alfred could have been better performed by a more competent actor, who could deliver legible sentences without distracting the viewers with jargon utterances.Miranda (Marion Cotillard)was as impressive as she was in InceptionInceptionwith her eloquent performance and belief in her role in the scenario. Marion's average facial outlook was empowered by her mastery of words, logic, and articulation. Her revealing of Bane's role as her protector was a poor move on the part of the moviemaker. The recitation my Miranda of her relationship with Bane offered the viewer a documentary rather than letting the viewer guess the hidden motives of the characters.The collection of wise and well structured statements added another depth to the movie. ""Structure becomes shackles"", ""boy born in hell, man of privilege"", ""no despair should exist without hope"", ""the slow knife that gets deeper between the bones"", ""fight harder than possible, longer than possible, without the grip of fear, like the boy did"",  .. and few other lasting statements that stretched the unseen depth of the scenarios.The shocking emptiness of the Billionaire's mansion, with Alfred quitting, everyone else dead, except Bruce Wayne, gave the viewers the real perspectives of the true life-style of the rich and large, that struggle with different stresses than common people perceive them to be.The issue of inserting incorrect and naive ideas in a fiction movie should not be overlooked. Here, the underground warlord kidnaps a Soviet Nuclear Physicist on the assumption that the scientist could operate the fusion reactor of Wayne Foundation into a fusion bomb. Further, the warlord; Bane, claims to have calculated the decay time of the nuclear core when taken out of the reactor. Such fo0lish depiction of nuclear technology was a low point in the movie, as the nuclear reactor is not as simple as an automobile or the physicist as crude as an auto-mechanic disassembling car parts.Mohamed F.

1419230,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004LWZWGK,M. Oleson,"[2, 5]","There may be spoilers...Spoiler number 1:  Bruce Wayne is Batman.After Batman's (Christian Bale) exile as a perceived criminal and murderer of Harvey Dent, Gotham City becomes a relatively safe and peaceful city.  Some of the credit goes to the illusion that Dent was a hero whose legacy included a new law which cracks down on organized crime.  Many of the familiar characters return including Gary Oldman as now Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred.  During this tranquil period of time, the city's underground (literally) is teaming with bad guys, led by a raging bull named Bane (a partially masked Tom Hardy).Bane has captured a device created by billionaire scientist/philantropist/environmentalist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) and owned by the Wayne Corporation.  It was developed to help with a cleaner environment but Bruce Wayne mothballed the project as too dangerous given its potential as a nuclear weapon.  Bane provides a demonstration for Gotham's population on a televised football game, showing the device's destructive powers during the game.  Cool CGI which I'm sure most have seen in trailers.Bruce Wayne has become a recluse given Batman's renegade credentials and the death of Rachel.  After Bane and his gang manage to wipe away Wayne's already diminished wealth, Batman rises once again.  In a one-on-one confrontation with Bane, the Bat man finally meets his match.  Imprisoned in a far off gulag, Wayne must once again not only rehabilitate physically but mentally, before his ultimate return.He is aided by a young policeman (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) whose honesty and enthusiasm catch the attention of both Wayne and Commissioner Gordon.  John Blake (Gordon-Levitt) provides much of the intelligence and courage needed in the film and Gordon-Levitt is excellent in the role.  Wayne/Batman also manages to enlist a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) in the final battle.  Hathaway manages to steal almost every scene she's in and that goes beyond her Catwoman suit.  There are some other wonderful performances.  Christian Bale gets to show a broken side of the Wayne/Batman character.  He's failed and he's lost his true love and struggles to get it together.  Michael Caine's Alfred gets some of his best scenes in the trilogy as he tries to guide and motivate Wayne.  In addition to some tense, exciting scenes filmgoers are treated to a couple big surprises.

The Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy comes full circle by the end of it and it easily holds up with The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and is more epic in scope than both.This is Christian Bales best outing as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He just feels more central to the story and he gets to show more of his acting chops here. Anne Hathaway turned in a performance I didn't know she had in her as Catwoman and Tom Hardy was as physically scary as any villain in the series. While Heath's Joker will always be the best in terms of performance, you fear for Batman's life when Bane is around. For the record I understood about 85% of what Bane said, so the rest will have to wait for Blu-ray subtitles. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (given the hardest job with some heavy emotional scenes) and a great new addition in Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out another stellar cast.The fight and action scenes are grounded in reality for the most part and very little CGI is used, which is always a plus.Hans Zimmer nails another loud and powerful music score.I saw this in IMAX and it was well worth it. About 40% or so was shot with those really expensive cameras and those scenes are pure eye candy.More than half of my sold out theater clapped at the end. The Avengers got maybe a dozen or so. I loved both films, but I think only one will last the test of time. I'm sure I'll be seeing TDKR at least one or two more times before it leaves theaters.

1419233,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B004LWZWGK,Monsieur Valentine,"[44, 140]","I need to re-evaluate everything because right now I'm gobsmacked by all the raving reviews. In some ways I feel like a villain. Ive become bitter and cynical about society today in the same vain as every batman villain to ever  grace us with their presence. People need to wake up!! What is everyone talking about!?! Seeing dark knight's stock rise the way it has... I ve got to interject.No Way. I'm pretty sure I saw what appeared to be a very cumbersome movie. Christopher Nolan really struggled with this one. The structure of the story was poorly derived. He had no handle on the momentum of the film. Right from the beginning with the first scene it felt like the drama was unfolding on a hot air balloon for some reason. It was unengaging and sporadically paced. And this problem extended right to the end of the movie. What a mish mash of action scenes, subplots, and story arcs. Directed with such poor direction.And in between all the mumbo jumbo deep sentiment (mostly from Alfred... Get a grip old man) we are entertained with one liners ""it's not a car"", and silly action scenes with police marching right into the line of fire like it was 1917 again. Or how about the mammoth cliffhanger ending for bane. I mean, batman goes to the pits of eternal hell trying to compete body blow for body blow With this incomprehensible turtle and all it took was a Shotgun blast to the stomach from catwoman. What a gripping conclusion! Even less satisfying was the twist, that someone else was behind all this. How on earth this Woman, born in prison, became a derivative of complete evilness... We will never quite grasp. And this so in turn really highlights what I'm trying to say. How does a 2.5 hour movie not have time to really make this a believable character twist? Why does this momentous occasion feel so rushed?Every momentous occasion feels so underwhelming, meanwhile we get long drawn out scenes of dialogue between characters that we care little about and story arcs that make this film so tedious to watch. I can't even recall when Bruce Wayne finally dons the suit. As a ridiculous example I was watching the latest Rambo film on cable today and I was stunned how well Sylvester Stallone got it right in comparison. 350 people get torn apart in that film but I distinctly remember the moment Rambo awakens from reclusion (on that boat). His veins pop out and his teeth clench POW! What a scene! His back! It was so well weighted... Dark knight rises? When? Oh that's right when he gets his vertebrae shoved back in his spine and does a few push ups.  What was it? He has to feel the pain of being born in prison to climb out. Took him all of 2 minutes in the movie. The pacing is sooo bad. Meanwhile a conversation between two irrelevant characters in the first half of the film would carry on for much longer.The villain was not a strong enough menace and I'm tired of the same one dimensional Pursuit to reign destruction on Gotham city. How many times does Gotham city need to dodge apocalyptic catastrophe? why can't a bunch of well paid writers come up with something more meaningful a third time round. I'm so confused how people don't see how this seemingly lost Wayne character finding his mojo again is not just a rehash from the first movie.Nothing worked for me. But then here you go. Apparently it worked for everyone else.",1,Spoilers.

1419240,ATOJ2NS4OBQSX,B004LWZWGK,movielover,"[2, 5]",Ok let's get something straight. Yes this is a spectacular film but is it perfect? Definately not. If I look at this from an audience members point of view then yes it does have some plot holes but it's still pretty damn awesome. From a comic book nerds point of view though the problems are easier to see.Where's Bane's venom or better yet his South American origin? Yes I understand that the venom may have been omitted due to the film being more realistic but I'm sure that there is some form of steroid that has at least similarities to venom. Any form of steroid would've been good actually since it would make him more powerful then before. Another problem was his mask. I WAS DEFINITELY NOT FEELING IT. It wasn't that I couldn't understand him in fact I understood him pretty well. My problem was that it was so different from his comic mask that it almost felt like a different character.

1419259,A1OMAFMY0GGAM1,B004LWZWGK,Nathan B. Blake,"[5, 8]","With The Dark Knight Rises, director Christopher Nolan makes it official: his Batman trilogy is not only the most satisfying Batman film series yet, but perhaps the best trilogy ever filmed. There is no deterioration in the quality of these films from ""Begins"" to ""Rises"", although I will admit that the second installment is still the best. Usually, by the time a third installment is released (The Godfather part III), the franchise collapses under pressure to top the predecessors. Even Return of the Jedi had to include those irritating ewoks!Nolan even manages to pull off (for the second time in a row) a two villan film, which is usually disaster. What's different about it here is almost a reversal of his two villan strategy for The Dark Knight. Harvey Dent was introduced as a symbol of hope and was turned into a villan. (Spoiler alert from here on) In ""Rises"", Selina Kyle travels that road in reverse.Many have claimed to have difficulty understanding Bane's dialogue through the mask. I don't share this issue with them. A couple lines were hard to hear, but that happens with most characters in any film, depending on the score and other sound effects. Overall, Bane's voice is clear and Tom Hardy gives the character a vocal variety that is almost charming and not the cliched booming deep voice of masked comic book villans.Then there's Joseph-Gordon Levitt, who compliments Batman as the everyday example of a superhero. It's risky to make a comic book film where your main charatcer's alter ego is absent for forty five minutes or longer, but Levitt's Officer John Blake is perfectly set up early on to fill Batman's shoes during the film's second act.One problem I have with the film is its occasional sloppy editing. An example of carelessness is when Selina Kyle drive across Gotham on the Batpod near the film's climax. The streets are abandoned and there isn't any traffic. It is pre-dawn when she leaves, yet by the time she arrives at her destination, the sun is shining as if it were seven or eight a.m.!That said, the editing and cinematography actually show improvement when it comes to the fight scenes. Gone are the frenzied close ups of hand to hand (and foot to trunk) combat from the previous two films. Here the audience is allowed, or should I say dared, to take in the full spectrum of each blow. For all the stunning visual effects in this film, from batpods to a jet simply called ""the bat"", to bike chases and massive, stadium crumbling explosions, the most impressive and jarring moments in the film are the brutal fist fights between Bane and Batman, the first (and best) of which is presented without any score. Kudos to Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer for knowing music could not add anything to that scene; perhaps only cheapen it.As I write this review the film is still playing nationwide, and my advice is if you haven't seen it im IMAX yet, do so. I've seen it in IMAX three times; perhaps I've gotten my fill, but who knows?

Knight' so I did not know if they could really top 'The Dark Knight', and I wasn't expecting them to, and they did not, BUT don't let that deter from this excellent finale, because this film is really really good, and I was not let down at all, infact, this is my 2nd favorite in the series, falling right behind the mighty 'The Dark Knight'.Now I don't want to play spoiler for people who haven't seen it yet, but I will comment on the cast and crew, now at first when I heard Anne Hathaway would play 'Catwoman' I wasn't sure that this was the role for her, but man oh man, did she surprise me, she plays the part like she should have, because Catwoman should be sleek and sexy, and sassy, and she sure is, this could be the role that propells her to better film roles in the future, she has the ability, Tom Hardy as Batmans nemesis 'Bane' and he really shines, he looks menacing, and the tone of his voice is just perfect, dark and fits the role to a T, and I was delighted to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as I've come to think of him as an excellent character actor, 'Inception' really made me take notice of him, and him and Christopher Nolan seem to work well off each other, and of course Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, and I always thought he did a great job with this role, normally he'd play the bad guy, which he's very good at as well, but this role is perfect for him, and of course you have good ole Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, and watching Morgan Freeman act just never gets old, and the old man still has it, and to my delight, Cillian Murphy reprises his role as 'Scarecrow' and although he's not in it much, but I really like this guy, after first seeing him in 'Batman Begins' and then 'Inception' another excellent character actor, so that should tell you the acting in this movie is superb, and everyone knows Christian Bale is just phenomenal as Batman, and that does not change this time around either, you can tell he loved playing this role.And of course the masterful Christopher Nolan does another fantastic job directing this epic, he has made it into my list of favorite directors with this series and 'Inception', and I like that he keeps his movies serious and not filled with stupid comedy like a lot of movies today, he keeps it serious and dark, and he really knows how to get the best out of his cast and crew.And boy does this movie look fantastic on blu ray, especially the shots of Gotham City, just like 'The Dark Knight', the buildings and skyscrapers just jump off the screen, the extras are a BIT lacking, but you do get an excellent documentary about the history of the mighty Batmobile, and you get an in depth making of too, and it's really good, I'm sure this will be re-released eventually with more extras, because I think they are planning on releasing a new box set next year, so I'm sure we'll have some new extras with that, but this will definetly do for now.Excellent movie, excellent end to the series, did not

1419299,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B004LWZWGK,P. Hardy,"[17, 27]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" is still fresh in my mind and thus opinion is subject to change with the course of time. That aside, it was an alright movie. Performances were strong, with the exception of one or two, and action sequences were exciting. I also love the fact that its connects more with ""Batman Begins"" than it does ""The Dark Knight"" in regards to its overall narrative.One of the biggest trouble spots for me was the film's score. I kept wondering why it felt relatively unbalanced or unlike the previous two and lo-and-behold, now I know why. James Newton Howard's contributions was missing from it (I think the only theme I liked in the film was Catwoman's; it was exactly the kind of music you'd imagine to play in the background while a cat is slinking around). It was all Hans Zimmer.It took a while to realize why Bruce was walking around with a cane, let alone a recluse in his own house. The general disconnect between this film and the Dark Knight was pretty big outside of knowing where it was coming from --- Harvey Dent's death and it's repercussions. I like the fact that his physical deterioration may have stemmed from that fall he suffered from TDK or the general abuse his body underwent before he decided to up and quit. However, in regards to this plot, I'm not sure why they decided to go with the downtrodden recluse instead of having Batman continue to fight the ""good fight"" as a wanted vigilante (I seriously expected them to handle this in the same way did in ""Batman: Mask of Phantasm""); its literally the impression ""The Dark Knight"" gives you with its finale. What made him give up, what made him (or Gordon) think the death of Harvey Dent would have such an impact on the people that it would force the city to pull itself off its own ass and do something about the crime?Which brings me to another one of the biggest things that bugged me about this film: the ""Harvey Dent Day"" and the ""Dent Act"" just reeked of a narrative gloss-over. There's telling your audience that the death of a man driven mad has done some kind of good for the city, then there's what they did. The eight year gap didn't help matters either. There was all this talk how the ""Dent Act"" helped clean up the streets, gave the police ""teeth"" (because that's always a good idea) and how Gotham City was in sitting idle in a time of peace, but honestly there was nothing to even speak of this in the film outside of all the mention it gets. All it reminded me of were scenes from the previous films wherein criminals weren't attacking or stealing in order to showcase Batman's beat-em-up style. But then, ""Batman Begins"" did a better job of showcasing a corrupt and troubled Gotham streets than the efforts TDK and TDKR did combined. ""Harvey Dent Day"" (its silly name aside) just made me feel a little ill inside, primarily because, I as a viewer knew the truth about what happened and it just seemed incredibly wrong that they were idolizing Harvey Dent like the second-coming for Gotham city. Especially as a means to maintain morale within the city which later, as one character points out when the ruse is revealed, doesn't count for much in the end.The movie doesn't really deliver on the hand-to-hand fight choreography like I hoped. It's the same close-up-cut-quick-paced editing that is clearly meant to hide and not illuminate the action sequence your watching unfold before your eyes. I thought it was the sloppiest with Catwoman when she faced multiple opponents. The chase sequences, however, at least never failed to be on point with the choreographed delivery and flow of vehicular and armament slaughter. I've always been of the mind that chase sequences involving vehicles has been Nolan's strongest point in regard to action sequences.Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle is something of a hit and miss. On one half she captured the ferocity and unapologetic side of Kyle nicely (she kinda reminded me of Eliza Dushku's performance in ""Batman Year One""), even if she jarred me with how quickly she switched between dominant and whatever submissive role she was playing to worm her way through particular situations. (And, yes, there was undoubtedly the part of me that was looking for that aged and silky Selina Kyle from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" who played with her cat, Isis.) And yes, her costume works better in motion than it does frozen in a picture. I also love that her goggles play on the cat ears, that was a nice touch. On the other, you had Anne portraying what was basically a unrealized character playing second fiddle to Batman and complicating things for him plot-wise when necessary. She was intriguing, but there was nothing about her that made me even think for one second ""why should I care about her?"" And this, I think, is a pattern you see a lot in Nolan's female characters in his Batman films.All of them serve a particular character archetype, but none of them ever actually become fully realized as characters or personalities (either because of their short-lived lives or misrecasting). It was largely the same with Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul. Instead of giving you a reason to care about her in the same way they did with ""Henri Ducard"", she was a brief love interest for Bruce Wayne (a relationship that is defined by nothing and ends as nothing) and a woman he once did with business with for the sake of a Greener tomorrow. Her entire backstory is the definition of ""sacrificed for the surprise"" even if I knew who she was from the get go. Juno Temple was just a waste of screentime and talent. Why was she even there when her role could've been filled by any old character actor, especially since the character is not even named Holly Robinson?Tom Hardy as ""Bane"" was another weak point in the film. This guy did not embody anything that I even found remotely interesting or compelling about Bane (either in the comics, the DCAU or even Young Justice). He had none of his gravitas, personality or physical presence. He was big white thug who liked to tug on his lapels and turned out to be Talia's ""gentle giant"" friend from her childhood days in the metaphorical embodiment of the Lazarus Pit. I had no problems understanding him, but whenever he spoke all I heard was a mixture of Sam the Eagle and Master Roshi. I could never take him seriously at all. The his part in the ""Knightfall"" aspect of this film was disappointingly weak when it didn't concern Blake and that was more of a nod-and-a-wink than anything.I love the that the story decided to focus more on Bruce as a character outside of Batman and how he muddled through his non-life in a ""post-retirement"" era. Christian Bale gives a great performance here as a aimless and heartbroken man, but the biggest problem was that he was competing with the likes of Officer John Blake. While I sympathized with Bruce's plight, I found myself wanting to go back to Blake and his escapades more than I wanted to see Batman pull himself out of retirement, injury and deal the repercussions of his personal life crumbling down around him (thanks to a thief and the truth about Rachel finally revealed by Alfred). He almost seemed to become unnecessary in his own film, everything happening around him or being told to him was decidedly more interesting.John Blake does indeed come off as a mixture of the three prominent Robins (Grayson, Todd and Drake), but struck me more as a Nightwing/Dick Grayson persona, especially given the that the character is a bloody cop in almost the same position as Dick was during the 1998-2000 run of ""Nightwing"". The explanation behind as to why/how he knew Bruce was Batman was a little sloppy, especially since the film seemed to give me the impression almost everyone who mattered seemed to know that Bruce = Batman (heck, I thought, with the way Blake was talking, Gordon already knew before the end of the film). Nonetheless, I could buy it given his and Bruce's circumstances. Blake almost has nothing to do besides chase vapor trails left behind by the villains or Batman, but I love the fact that he was probably one of the few proactive protagonists in the film besides Bruce himself. (While Gary Oldman gives the usual great performance, Commissioner Gordon is criminally underused and almost forgotten about until the semi-end of the film.) The only thing that bugged me was the fact that he had to put on a suit to play detective. All I could think of was ""Inception"" when I saw him the threads. I seriously preferred him wearing the Blue Uniform, but it hardly prevents Levitt from excelling with a really great performance.Other strong performances stem from Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine as the wizened Lucius Fox and Alfred Pennyworth, with the latter's only detraction being that he was crying or tearing up in every other scene. I get that he's supposed to be convey his heartbreak and concern for Bruce, the boy he's raised for God-knows-how-long, but I dunno. I kinda expected him to use the same steady emotion he did in ""Begins"" and ""Dark Knight"", but I guess this was just was the character's breaking point and man did I want to hug him at the end.Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was a enjoyable film. It does its best to conclude up storylines that began in the first or second film and the end, I think, wraps up things up nicely even if was telegraphed from a mile away. I like the idea of a Bruce Wayne being able to pull himself away from the shadow of Batman, even if he is ultimately burdening the shoulders of another (no matter how willing they may be to carry it in the end). That, I think, was the only ""Knightfall"" element they got right and did it in a way that respected both Bruce and ""Robin"". Narratively, I appreciate the fact that it acknowledges and hinges itself more on ""Batman Begins"" instead of relying entirely on ""The Dark Knight"" like I would expect a threequel to do. If it weren't for the Harvey Dent storyline, I believe you could watch the first film and jump straight into the third without trouble. However, it makes the mistake of repeating the same climax in its finale (where it worked in the first film, it's just makes me wish they'd done something different with it's finale). The sacrifice of Selina, Talia and Bane's characters leaves me extremely disappointed as well.",3,"""THERE'S A CAT ABOUT TOWN AND SHE'S NOT HAPPY."" - THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012,

I won't spoil any of the movie's plot and will only say that almost everything seems to work perfectly: the characters, the plot, action, the sets. The only thing that seemed a tad off to me was the pacing, which seemed a bit slow at times. This movie doesn't quite pack the same wallop as the The Dark Knight but it is still one of the best movies of the year and one of the best comic book based movies of all time.The PQ is near perfect, the 1.78:1 Imax scenes are sheer perfection and the traditional 2.40:1 scenes are really great. The AQ is just perfect, every bit of dialogue is audible and the sound effects and music are all crystal clear. Most importantly is that the audio never needs to be adjusted! The special features are good: we get some nice production documentaries and HD trailers (which I think are always great to have). The lack of an iTunes copy is unfortunate but the UV digital copy serves well enough.The BestBuy steel book is quite nice. My copy came delivered to my house day one without any scratches or imperfections. It is not the typical glossy steel book that will scratch easily for those that worry about that. The cover art, with Batman's broken mask in the rain, is very well done. The two blu-ray discs and one DVD are housed sturdily inside.All in all, a very solid package, especially for those that have the first two steel book entries in this great trilogy.",5,BestBuy Steelbook: Great Blu-ray Package for an Epic Conclusion to One of the Greatest Trilogies,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,1483,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'was', 'great', 'end', 'one', 'greatest', 'trilogies', 'ever', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'plot', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'almost', 'everything', 'work', 'perfectly', 'characters', 'plot', 'action', 'sets', 'only', 'thing', 'seemed', 'tad', 'was', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'same', 'wallop', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'movies', 'time.The', 'PQ', 'perfect', '1.78:1', 'Imax', 'scenes', 'are', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'traditional', '2.40:1', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'AQ', 'just', 'perfect', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'audible', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Most', 'importantly', 'audio', 'never', 'be', 'adjusted', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'get', 'nice', 'production', 'documentaries', 'HD', 'trailers', 'think', 'are', 'always', 'great', 'have', 'lack', 'iTunes', 'copy', 'unfortunate', 'UV', 'digital', 'copy', 'serves', 'well', 'enough.The', 'BestBuy', 'steel', 'book', 'quite', 'nice', 'copy', 'came', 'delivered', 'house', 'day', 'one', 'scratches', 'imperfections', 'not', 'typical', 'glossy', 'steel', 'book', 'will', 'scratch', 'easily', 'worry', 'cover', 'art', 'Batman', 'broken', 'mask', 'rain', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'two', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'one', 'DVD', 'are', 'housed', 'sturdily', 'inside.All', 'very', 'solid', 'package', 'especially', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'steel', 'book', 'entries', 'great', 'trilogy']",The Dark Knight Rises

It is a respectful conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, and wraps things up neatly, but it is less than satisfying for us old-school comic geeks.If you have not seen this film, stop reading now because I'm about to reveal some spoilers.You've been warned.If you still want to read on, let's continue.Bane's character is almost unrecognizable compared to his comic-book character, and it's hard to believe that Alfred would ever desert his charge under any circumstances, but it helps the story to highlight that doing the right thing is always important, even if no one is watching, and even if those whose opinions are important to you disapprove of what you are doing.All (or at least most) of us old-school comic geeks also disapprove of Bruce Wayne's &#34;retirement&#34; of his alter-ego at the end, seemingly to never return.  Much the same as Alfred's abandonment of his duty, it's hard to believe that Bruce would ever abandon Gotham, especially since it's cost him everything, literally.  One would think that his celebrity and some diligent effort would reveal the fraud that stripped him of his fortune and restore it to him so he could continue to be the night watchman of Gotham.I won't comment on the Robin thing, except to say that it shouldn't have been included in this film.All in all, I consider this trilogy more of an &#34;alternate universe&#34; Batman story, and that the Bat we've known and loved all these years is still watching over Gotham and the entire world as part of the Justice League.I will conclude by saying that the Christopher Nolan trilogy still beats any Batman movie or series ever made, and Christian Bale is a better Bat than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney and Adam West.",5,Don't miss this film,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1833,"['First', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'story', 'line', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'beginning', 'respectful', 'conclusion', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy', 'wraps', 'things', 'up', 'neatly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'old-school', 'comic', 'geeks.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', ""'m"", 'reveal', 'spoilers.You', ""'ve"", 'been', 'still', 'want', 'read', 'let', 'continue.Bane', 'character', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'compared', 'comic-book', 'character', 'hard', 'believe', 'Alfred', 'would', 'ever', 'desert', 'charge', 'circumstances', 'story', 'highlight', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'always', 'important', 'even', 'one', 'watching', 'even', 'opinions', 'are', 'important', 'disapprove', 'what', 'are', 'doing.All', 'least', 'most', 'old-school', 'comic', 'geeks', 'also', 'disapprove', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', '34', 'retirement', '34', 'alter-ego', 'end', 'seemingly', 'never', 'return', 'same', 'Alfred', 'abandonment', 'duty', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bruce', 'would', 'ever', 'abandon', 'Gotham', 'especially', 'cost', 'everything', 'literally', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'celebrity', 'diligent', 'effort', 'would', 'reveal', 'fraud', 'stripped', 'fortune', 'restore', 'so', 'could', 'continue', 'be', 'night', 'watchman', 'Gotham.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Robin', 'thing', 'say', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film.All', 'consider', 'trilogy', 'more', '34', 'alternate', 'universe', '34', 'Batman', 'story', 'Bat', ""'ve"", 'known', 'loved', 'years', 'still', 'watching', 'Gotham', 'entire', 'world', 'part', 'Justice', 'League.I', 'will', 'conclude', 'saying', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'trilogy', 'still', 'Batman', 'movie', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'better', 'Bat', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Adam', 'West']",The Dark Knight Rises
1419320,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B004LWZWGK,Ray-Review,"[2, 4]","I loved this movie. This was a great way to end the great Dark Knight Trilogy. I have to give it up to Christopher Nolan because he single handedly (figuratively speaking of course) proved to all cinema fanatics and critics that creating a great superhero trilogy is possible, if handled with care. What I loved about The Dark Knight Rises is that it tied in all 3 movies together pretty damn well. Some sequels to movies tend to abandon the storylines of the previous film to some extent, but Nolan was able to mesh Batman Begins and The Dark Knight into this new film well enough that it never seemed too forced or irrelevant. The actors for this particular film were chosen perfectly in my opinion; Anne Hathway played an incredibly sexy Catwoman and arguably the best Catwoman ever captured on film, Tom Hardy as Bane was an excellent choice for his strong body and great acting as well, although the voice acting/voice dub has been harshly criticized for it's sound clarity. Joseph Gordan Levitt's character was a personal favorite of mines and his character winded up being significant to story which was a relief.I'm not going to spoil anything about the film, but in it's long running time of 160 minutes, I was surprised to find myself wanting more. To be honest I wouldn't mind if the film was 3 hours long or maybe even a bit longer than that; in fact it should've been because some segments of the movie felt a bit rushed especially the dialogue. However the plot, actors, action and cinematagraphy is some of the best I've seen in 2012 thus far. The only sad part about this movie is that this is indeed the last Dark Knight movie Nolan will be creating, bringing the great trilogy to a sealed close. But all good things must end and this a wonderful way to go out. Fans will always wonder how it could've ended if the late Heath Ledger (The Joker) was still alive, but under the circumstances I don't think Christopher Nolan could've done any better. Buy this movie, and buy the entire trilogy if you haven't seen it, it's worth every penny and every minute of your time.

First, the story was all over the place, certain events that took place weren't believable, the very strong storytelling which made the first two films so good, because they carried a sense of realism, a realism that made you believe that what was happening was real, or could happen. For instance; Bruce Wayne, according to the comic book, is suppose to be a man past his prime. They attempted to exemplify this in the film, I suppose that's what the few gray strands found on Bruce Wayne's head was about? Whatever! Also, Batman suffers a back injury that left him unable to stand, how is it he was able to have his back ""repaired"", afterwards, do a few sit-ups and push-ups, and then all of a sudden he climbs out of a possibly 50ft. pit, and now he's ready to get back into the fight? Whatever! The entire story was all over the place, the story/movie felt crammed, as if it should have been cut into two films like a Part I & II (like the comic book-duhh!).After I had watched the movie, I began thinking to myself, ""is this it, tell me this isn't it!"" I felt let down by the movie. I'm not implying that the movie is horrible, but for it to be that last one, the director and producers went out on a soft note. I don't care to watch the movie again as I love watching the first two, I don't want to buy it on Blueray, I don't even care to watch it if it just so happens to be on my cable lineup for the evening. The bottom line is this, there isn't anything spectacular about this latest Batman film.

1419327,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B004LWZWGK,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[4, 9]","I intend here to delve into the film and discuss it on more than a superficial level. While I want to respect that many may not have seen it yet, and won't reveal what I deem to be major spoilers regarding the much discussed fate of Batman, my goal here is to discuss it on a level that will inevitably cause spoilers pertaining to the film and even its third act revelations (at least if you haven't read the comics), so be forewarned and avoid this review if you must. For those who have seen the film and may have come to this page, like myself, wondering what others thought, please read on and let me know your thoughts in the comments section.I have now seen the film three times, once in the Dark Knight Marathon after having viewed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The Second time was after having had some time to reflect upon the first viewing. Before the third time I went back and watched Begins and Dark Knight once again to see what weight they may have gained with knowledge of how the trilogy now ends. SO now to the review of Rises... which begins with how it fits into the overall trilogy.The Dark Knight Rises is a genius film in that it not only completes a trilogy it gives the previous two films greater meaning and provides characters and scenes in the earlier films with even more depth and levels. The plot goes back and provides new context that adds enjoyment and helps the trilogy feel more cohesive. This is especially true regarding Batman Begins, specifically  a scene that occurs at about the twenty minute mark of that film. Ra's Al Ghul is expanded upon and his discussion of his lost love now carries heavier emotional impact. Also, a revelation about what Alfred was up to during Bruce's early travels around the world before becoming Batman also helps add more emotion and new meaning to Alfred's conversations with Bruce throughout the first third of Begins, and even to conversations they share in Dark Knight. It is amazing that Nolan grew as a filmmaker during the trilogy and crafted a final film that rose above where he began, but even more amazing that he took the time to craft a finale that makes the entire trilogy stronger, especially the first installment. Scenes that were clearly crafted on their own initially now seem like they were crafted with this final installment and the trilogy as a whole in mind.The Dark Knight, especially its final scenes with Two-face, Gordon and Batman are given a greater weight because Rises shows us the results of their decisions and gives us deeper understanding of what Gordon was thinking during those moments. What the film relies on from the Dark Knight, aside from Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent, is the grittiness based in our reality. Begins had elements of this but Dark Knight pushed the parallels between Gotham and our world even further. Heavier real world issues were seeded throughout that film and that continues perfectly and seemlessly in Rises (financial strife, terrorism, disillusionment with social structures, etc.). The sheer ferocity and insanity of Bane is clearly only made possible by the astounding portrayal of the Joker. The fight, shown in many trailers, where Bane first fights Batman in the sewers is frighteningly real and has been primed by the realistic hostage tapes and menace produced by the Joker. Dark Knight clearly prepared us for Dark Knight Rises, but oddly the film seems to relate more strongly back to Batman Begins in that it provides a more emotional connection. Overall though the trilogy as a whole feels completed by this entry, and though Dark Knight will always stand out as the most provocative (it was so unexpected and something we were so unaccustomed to), in an entirely different sense Rises also stands out as something unique and compelling.How does Rises stand as a film on its own? Most people seem to be speaking in favor of it. I obviously agree with them. A few people have expressed not enjoying it and have been received very poorly for doing so, I just want to say regarding that, let's respect that each individual is entitled to their opinion. I can actually appreciate their stance as my first viewing was more of an enjoyment and my love and admiration for the film only came through repeated viewings I had planned ahead of my first viewing, despite the dismay it caused my wallet. Dark Knight Rises has many levels when paired up with the previous two movies, but it also has many levels contained within itself. There was a lot to take in and I admittedly had to process it and put it into the proper intended context. There are a slew of new characters, there are huge time jumps, there is not a great deal of time devoted to characters we already know and there are several plot revelations saved for the third act.Ultimately the thing to keep in mind when watching Rises is 'A Tale of Two Cities'. The story begins here and it really is the best of times, it really is the worst of times. The entire film is based strongly on themes found notably in the classic Dickens tale. Nolan's love for the motif of doubles/dualities throughout the franchise never plays more strongly than it does here. For example, Bane breaks Batman after a crushing blow to the forehead of his mask. Batman later deals crushing blows to Bane by wailing on his mask. Both men only became known for putting on masks. Gordon is a jaded cop who got his hands dirty, Blake is an idealistic squeaky clean cop, Miranda Tate and Selina Kyle also play opposites in their positions relating to Bruce Wayne. Even the film's ending has a quote from Dicken's classic and I think it speaks volumes not only regarding the themes of the film but to the ending and the dualities I believe to be found in it. It is this kind of writing, courtesy of the Nolans and Goyer, that I believe finds the film ""being received... ...in the superlative degree of comparison only"".The obvious things are all done with the craft and capability one expects from Nolan's team. The directing is great in that is follows traditional patterns but breaks them at key moments for planned effect (the dropping out of any score during a Batman and Bane brawl makes the hits that much more painful for example). The music plays with themes from the previous films but Zimmer pushes it to a wonderfully operatic crescendo here. The acting is the best of any summer blockbuster (Freeman, Oldman and Caine deliver as alwas) and Bale seems most markedly improved (he's given arguably heavier material to work with here than in Dark Knight and has notably won an Oscar since then). All the newcomers (Hardy, Cotilliard, JGL and Hathaway) fit into the series better than anyone portraying Rachel Dawes ever did (sorry but I couldn't believe Holmes or Gyllenhaal in Nolan's universe). The writing is, as noted above, layered and well done if not slightly compacted due to so much happening.Some weaknesses, a proper review should discuss the good and the bad and the film does have some issues, at least for me. The villains (Bane and [as most fans guessed early on] Talia) were well crafted by the writers and actors, but their final scenes felt somewhat anti-climatic to me. This may just be due to the fact that they weren't traditional in the Hollywood sense. Bane is sent off ultimately, after an earlier defeat, rather quickly with a joke (though a successful one) made at his expense. Talia makes her exit rather quickly without a direct confrontation and without much of a fight, it is troubling in the sense that she only gets one monologue after her big reveal and then is gone. She is given greater depth by a revelation regarding her childhood but her plan is never really presented in context of her desires other than the classic desire for revenge. She also never seems as strong as her provided origin would have us believe she is. Another annoyance is a character's death by car crash (despite every other character seemingly surviving similar or worse crashes during the trilogy, Joker survived a semi flipping over for example).Another potential weakness, from my view at least, was that though Gotham was seen falling into despair and decay, there was actually quite little seen of its citizens coping with the horrors inflicted by Bane and the League of Shadows. The majority of the citizens reactions seem to be done in one montage at the beginning of the occupation. Other than their faces during this montage and earlier at the football stadium we are left to guess what life for the everyday citizen in the occupied Gotham is like. That said we do see how the cops and Wayne executives are surviving and a nice reaction shot of Selina Kyle watching the initial looting does provide a great deal of weight and context. Still, seeing more of the everyday men and women trying to cope or survive would have added more weight to Batman's eventual attempts to save them all, it can almost feel like he will only be saving the main characters because few others are seen in the city.The last big question in my mind, how does everyone seem to know when the bomb will go off? Sure Lucious tells Gordon, Blake and the cops, but Bruce Wayne arrives in Gotham not having spoken to any of them and he already knows when the bomb will go off too. Then Talia always seems to know the exact minute count despite not having even looked at a watch. To a similar but greater point, how does Bruce get back to Gotham, get back into the city when its cordoned off so well and find Selina all luckily on the day before the bomb goes off? Great timing but no indication that he's planned any of it. It's all very coincidental and glossed over, some quick nods to how it all came together would've been appreciated. Further his plan in the finale is still somewhat murky to me, he gathers the police force for the huge wall street battle royale but why didn't he try using The Bat to fly in blasting away and take Bane personally, or using his stealth for that matter, there are many reasons he probably does this (can't take on an entire army at once) but he never explicitly states any and no one questions him.Debatable weak spots aside, the strongest part of the film overall upon repeat viewings is indeed the ending. What upon initial viewing seems to be a somewhat cathartic and happy ending reveals itself to be a multi-layered and ambiguous one. It is an ending that merits endless deciphering and inspires questioning while provoking thought. I won't put any spoilers in this regard as I don't want to risk anyone accidentally reading it, but I would like to discuss further with any willing participants in the comments or a discussion thread. A crucial scene at the end of the film and a few quick scenes as well as one crucial shot during the final climax all leave room for interpretation to various possible outcomes. Initially I went with the masses and believed Nolan had provided a more traditional and cathartic ending, but upon repeat viewings I think the ending is meant to be ambiguous, just as Inception was. Personally I am drawn to the darker more traditionally Nolan ending. What makes it so genius though is that fans/viewers can seemingly have it either way. Happy ending for all, or a more somber ending with seeds of hope for the future.That the ending can be interpreted so differently is a testament to the time, effort and genius Nolan and his team put into making this film worthy of the trilogy. I believe it is.This was not the film that we deserved, but its the one we needed right now. This is a far, far better 'superhero' interpretation than has ever been done. This is a far, far better trilogy than we have ever known. I want to thank you Nolan, even though you'd say we never have to, for producing/creating smart, big budget films that don't condescend to the viewer. Hopefully you've started something...",5,Rises above the hype to become something else entirely...,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,11860,"['intend', 'here', 'delve', 'film', 'discuss', 'more',

1419329,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004LWZWGK,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 4]","It's been 4 years since The Dark Knight came out, and while only time will tell if this movie will live up to the ridiculously high standards set by fans of the franchise, one thing that is indeed for Sure is that The Dark Knight Rises is seriously awesome. A long time fan of Batman, I haven't missed a single opening day of Btman, and last night I decided not to break that tradition. The minute the tickets went on sale a month ago, I frantically pulled out my Blackberry and opened the cineplex app, frantically hitting the ""reload"" button nonstop and finally got ahold of IMAX midnight premiere tickets, and while the wait for the midnight show was long and torturous, it was worth every single hour of the wait.Now I consider myself to be a rare breed, one of the few who prefer Batman Begins to The Dark Knight. Don't get me wrong, I love The Dark Knight to pieces, but it's always been about the comic book feel and how Batman and Bruce Wayne continue their inner battle against himself for me. I mean, while I love TDK, there's too much Bruce Wayne for me, and it's more of a Christopher Nolan action thriller than Batman. So I hoped that TDKR would deliver... in short, it did.Eight years have passed since Batman took the blame for Harvey Dent's horrible crimes. Bruce Wayne is disgraced, shamed, and living in reclusion, with exceptionally poor health. Since Harvey Dent died, an Anti-crime act named after his belief in cleaning up the streets has been put in place, and a Harvey Dent day has been put in place to honor his beliefs.  However, that can't last; a sexy but mysterious jewel thief named Selina Kyle, with feline tendencies, has been wreaking havoc in Gotham and even worse, a terrorist named Bane has arrived in Gotham, and has an underground army who are planning a tyrannical nightmare of a plan that will turn Gotham into gangland territory. This means Bruce Wayne has to come out ofnhiding and return as Gotham's caped crusader for once and for all!Man, I couldn't have asked for a better finale to the series. This film pulls the blockbuster out of its comfort zone and gives us something that feels so intimate, yet so grand scale. The action is big, epic, and bombastic, yet the drama is intimate, up close and personal. And another part that made it so great: comic book Batman is back! While the dark and grim tone is still there, the tongue in cheek, quirky comic book feel is inthe air, specifically during Batman and Catwoman's scenes. Mind you, Heath Ledger's Joker isn't around, and Bane is the villain but up to 11 with the brutality and minus the wit and comic charm, so we're relying on Catwoman for those sparks of verbal wit, and it does work... Way better than it should, even! And the villain. Bane. He is one scary mofo. He can snap someone's spine in half like a lobster without even any effort. The mask he wears is terrifying and as a result, your heart fills with fear and dread every time he shows up.Another reason to see this movie is the IMAX cinematography. It's an ultimate sin to miss this in IMAX. 72 minutes of the movie were shot with IMAX cameras, and it helps enhance it much more. They're not just for big set pieces like TDK, they help enhance the narrative of the film. Without a doubt the most interesting use of the IMAX cameras is the fight scene in the sewer between Bane and Batman. No music, violent and brutal, and a few shots where Bane's all, terrifying image fills the 8 story screen just make for one of the most memorable scenes in recent memory.Never has Batman been done this much justice, and thank Nolan for finally getting Batman exactly right. I felt like a kid during several scenes, like Bat riding his batpod through the tunnel, the Batjet scenes, well practically the whole film,  and overall I was overwhelmed with that childlike happiness and joy- the batman I always wanted to see had finally unfolded before my eyes.Do not miss this film...

While it gave us the introduction of the characters of CatWoman and Bane neither of the characters background storylines made them the entertaining characters they are in the comic book series as a major change in their history was done in this movie. Also the actor and actress who were picked for these roles felt spectacular playing them either and seemed pretty subpar especially when you line them up to Liam Neeson or Heath Ledger(R.I.P.) in their iconic Batman character roles.  The movies story felt to rushed like the director/producers/Warner Brothers just wanted to release this as quickly as possible for the summer crowd.  Don't get me wrong the action and effects are spectacular and probably the biggest three stars that at least make you watch the movie from start to finish are Christian Bale,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman which is a little sad as with the exception of Bale as Batman you don't really care if you miss any screen time that has the two other earlier mentioned Batman nemsis/ally characters which the movie company gave so much PR about.

J Rey,"[0, 0]","Director Christopher Nolan delivers a most satisfying conclusion to his critically acclaimed superhero saga with the highly anticipated blockbuster sequel The Dark Knight Rises. It's been eight years since the death of DA Harvey Dent and billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a broken recluse, abandoning his crusade against crime and corruption as the vigilante known as Batman. When the masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne knows that the Batman is needed, but to stop Bane's nefarious plan to destroy Gotham City he forms an uneasy alliance with the skilled cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). The Dark Knight Rises not only ranks as one of the best movies of 2012, but is also one of the finest superhero movies to hit the big screen. This thrilling cinematic spectacle is worthy follow-up to its acclaimed predecessor The Dark Knight, featuring an intricate storyline, solid performances, skillful direction and first-rate action sequences. The cast also includes Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.Warner Brothers knows how to give its blockbusters a solid Blu-Ray presentation, and this 2-disc edition will surely standout with repeat viewings. The Dark Knight Rises is presented in 2.40:1 and 1.78:1 (IMAX sequences) aspect ratios. The picture quality is certainly striking with notable detail and rich colors. Its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track delivers that home theater experience that you've come to expect from most big screen summer movie. The 2-disc edition comes with an abundance of behind-the-scenes featurettes that deeply explore many of key elements of the film's production.

I am the biggest Batman fan ever. Been a fan since 1974 when I was 2 years old and I loved the movie. Sure I'd love to see more of the Batman I grew up loving, but when you have a film maker like Chris Nolan he is going to kind of do his own thing. He still stayed well within many of the Batman mythos. Some people talk about the plot holes and while there are a couple minor small plot holes, the are nowhere near as big as some may have you believe. eNone are any bigger than you'll see in some of the best movies ever made. Seriously people, plot holes are everywhere in films if you'r looking hard enough. But I don't bother with such things because I am usually to busy trying enjoy a film, not act like a I am so much smarter than everyone else because I spotted a couple little plot holes. They of course never point out these holes because most of them don't exist. I think that most of these people just weren't bright enough or interested to keep track of what what going on. The ending of the movie is visceral and emotional. Of the ending doesn't follow the comic book Batman because there is no ending in the Batman comic books and there never will be. Comic book hero's are perpetually between 27-35 years old. For what it is it's a nice tidy ending to Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy.

This Batman hobbles around for nearly the entire film. He's slow, dim, unexciting in every way. Dull as Dishwater.BANE: What a backstory - NOT.

No. He wants to kill everyone in New York City - err - Gotham. And kill himself in the process. Sure.Now right off the bat I can think of at least two American hellholes, that if Bane targeted them, I might be cheering him on. But NYC ? Again ?And how come no one ever targets Bane's lame mask ? Does it ever occur to Batman that if he tears it off, Bane dies ? Oh wait, Batman can't deliverately kill anyone. Sigh.

Music and sound effects become increasingly tumultuous.The total effect transudes into the GROTESQUE. A culture cannot evolve without honest,powerful storytelling.

We continually see a ""woe is me"" weak and broken down Bruce Wayne.  He has completely lost the spirit that made him so captivating in the other films.  I understand the loss of both Rachel and Harvey took their toll, but there wasn't much in DKR to make you care about Bruce and his mission.  By the way, what -is- his mission in this film?----Anne Hathaway does a good job with what she was given.  She has a lot of spirit, although her purpose isn't all together clear.  Either the picture was dark or there was lots of poor set lighting because there weren't many opportunities to get a clear look at the ""controversial"" cat woman suit.  Doesn't matter though.

I saw it in the theater after it was first released but waited to review it here until I got and watched the Blu-Ray, like you're supposed to.  (This section is for product reviews, not movie reviews)To me, Christopher Nolan's Batman films are the best.  Tim Burton's Batman showed us that comic movies could be serious, but then the series went downhill in the sequels.  Nolan took us back to the beginning in Batman Begins, gave us a nice middle with The Dark Knight, and ends things nicely with this film.  The story is very good, it tells the tale of an aging Bruce Wayne living with the physical and mental consequences of his life as Batman in a city where Batman is no longer necessary.  However, that all changes when Bane comes to town and then Bruce must once more put on the bat suit and face the one enemy who is at least his physical match, if not more. The acting is great, what you expect from the actors involved.  The characters are believable and the film has a very realistic look to it because most of it is real.  Unlike a lot of movies being made today, this film uses CGI only when there's no other way to make something happen.  However, 90 to 95 percent of what you see is stuff that they actually filmed.  To me, that makes the film even better.The Blu-Ray is a very nice product.  The film is in the highest quality and is on its own disc.  The only thing I don't like is that, when you hit stop, you can't resume the film.  Also, there is no bookmark function.  So, if you turn off your player, you lose where you are in the film.  The film also has long chapters, there are only 17 chapter on a 2 hour 44 minute film.  I expected more from a 2012 Blu-Ray.  But, those are my only complaints and they're minor.  The special features disc is nice, there are a lot of good things on there.  I especially like the documentary on the Batmobiles.  The DVD copy was unnecessary to me.  I'm single, I have 1 TV and I have my Blu-Ray player hooked up to it, so there's no point in me ever watching the DVD.  But, I couldn't buy the Blu-Ray without it.  So, I gave the DVD to my parents.

1419378,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B004LWZWGK,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[0, 0]","The simple question brings a complex answer here.The question with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is obvious--is it as good as ""The Dark Knight""??!?The answer is ""No""--but that is an answer that has to be considered in context.  ""The Dark Knight"" is arguably The Best Superhero Movie Ever; clearly is at or near the top of anyone's list in the genre.  It also is one of the best movies made in the first decade of the 21st century.But when considered with movie series that have gone into two to three sequels, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a high-quality effort; very much a worthy third act in Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's story of Bruce Wayne.  Take into account some of the recent ""third chapters"" we've seen--X-Men 3, Spider-Man 3, The Bourne Ultimatium; Superman 3 from the '80s, Rush Hour 3, Batman Forever from the Burton/Shoemaker set...TDKR sets itself above these movies because it follows the continuity of the first two movies--the path that the Nolans followed, their vision of Bruce and Gotham--and gave it a full and completed story.Chris and Jonathan have been very good in combining parts and pieces of the great Batman stories of the last 25 years in this series.  Obviously, much of their vision of Wayne has been based on Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" throughout the trilogy; and there were strong elements of ""The Killing Joke"" in TDK as well as harbingers of the ""No Man's Land"" series from 1999.  TDKR--obviously--draws from both ""Knightfall"" and allows a reimaging of ""No Man's Land"" to come to fruition.  It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the Nolans REALLY liked the ""No Man's Land"" scenario.But just as obviously, Chris and Jon also took great care with their imaging of The League of Shadows--in their real-world vision of The Bat, The League seems the perfect and best antagonist to this vision.  Tom Hardy's Bane, in turn, fits brilliantly.  Hardy captures much of what the character was when he was introduced--highly intelligent, uncompromisingly vicious.  Again, much credit goes to the Nolans, who have a capacity for getting actors who will physically mold themselves.  Christian Bale worked himself into good shape for all these movies.  Hardy becomes a powerful, intimidating presence as Bane; though his mask (The positive for the Blu-Ray/DVD set is that Hardy's lines--at times, unintelligible in the theater--were cleaned up for the disc release...) serves a different purpose than in the original story.  It's a great performance from Hardy, who has to do so much of it just with his eyes.This movie allows for the actors that Chris and Jon rely on for good performances to step up--Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake, the young Gotham police officer who knows who Bruce Wayne is/was and brings him back into the game; Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate (""I'm sorry, but what was her name again...??!?""), and again, Hardy.Bale's final turn as Bruce Wayne...is morose at first, with Bruce having become Howard Hughes in the aftermath of the Joker and Harvey Dent.  As I've said over the years, Chris and Jonathan see Bruce Wayne more as a person with multiple personas more than a person with a secret identity; and what Christian captures early is how not letting the Batman out has affected him.  Christian has been solid in his interpretation thoughout the trilogy.  What brings Bale's Wayne back to ""The Game"" are Gordon-Levitt's Blake--explaining what he knows about Bruce, how he knows, and the sudden direness of the situation; AND...Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle.I cannot emphasize enough that Hathaway just kills it.  She brilliantly captures the modern-day Selina; sharp-tongued, skilled high-end jewel thief, top-end martial artist, protector of her neighborhood...and just drop-dead gorgeous, especially in her catsuit.  Kudos to the Nolans for the cat-eared goggles for Selina.  In interviews after the completion and release of the movie, Hathaway has wistfully talked about Selina, quietly imploring the Nolans to revisit her at some point.  Here's an open hope that the Nolans DO find a path back to her.Michael Caine's Alfred seems full of regrets here, and does not get as much screen time as in the first two.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is still the sly and intelligent inventor.  Gary Oldman has had a wonderful grip on Jim Gordon throughout.Again--""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not on the level of its magnificent predecessor.  But it is a very, very good film; and a great completion to The Nolan Dark Knight Trilogy.Plus, it does leave some crumbs out there to lead to a new storyline.  So, bravo to Christopher and Jonathan; Christian, Michael, Gary, Morgan, Liam Neeson, Anne, JG-L, Tom, Marion...well done.Highly recommended.",5,The Dark Knight Rises--A Solid Completion To The Nolan Trilogy,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,4692,"['simple', 'question', 'complex', 'answer', 'here.The', 'question', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'obvious', 'as', 'good', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'answer', 'No', 'answer', 'be', 'considered', 'context', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'arguably', 'Best', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'Ever', 'clearly', 'top', 'anyone', 'list', 'genre', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'made', 'first', 'decade', '21st', 'century.But', 'when', 'considered', 'movie', 'series', 'have', 'gone', 'two', 'three', 'sequels', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'high-quality', 'effort', 'very', 'much', 'worthy', 'third', 'act', 'Christopher', 'Jonathan', 'Nolan', 'story', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Take', 'account', 'recent', 'third', 'chapters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'X-Men', '3', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatium', 'Superman', '3', ""'80s"", 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Burton/Shoemaker', 'set', 'TDKR', 'movies', 'continuity', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'path', 'Nolans', 'followed', 'vision', 'Bruce', 'Gotham', 'gave', 'full', 'completed', 'story.Chris', 'Jonathan', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'combining', 'parts', 'pieces', 'great', 'Batman', 'stories', 'last', '25', 'years', 'series', 'Obviously', 'much', 'vision', 'Wayne', 'been', 'based', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'trilogy', 'were', 'strong', 'elements', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'TDK', 'as', 'well', 'harbingers', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'series', '1999', 'TDKR', 'obviously', 'draws', 'Knightfall', 'reimaging', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'come', 'fruition', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'stretch', 'say', 'Nolans', 'REALLY', 'liked', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'scenario.But', 'just', 'obviously', 'Chris', 'Jon', 'also', 'took', 'great', 'care', 'imaging', 'League', 'Shadows', 'real-world', 'vision', 'Bat', 'League', 'perfect', 'best', 'antagonist', 'vision', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bane', 'turn', 'brilliantly', 'Hardy', 'much', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'introduced', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'uncompromisingly', 'vicious', 'Again', 'much', 'credit', 'Nolans', 'who', 'have', 'capacity', 'getting', 'actors', 'who', 'will', 'physically', 'mold', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'worked', 'good', 'shape', 'movies', 'Hardy', 'powerful', 'intimidating', 'presence', 'Bane', 'mask', 'positive', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'set', 'Hardy', 'lines', 'times', 'unintelligible', 'theater', 'were', 'cleaned', 'up', 'disc', 'release', 'different', 'purpose', 'original', 'story', 'great', 'performance', 'Hardy', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'eyes.This', 'movie', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Jon', 'rely', 'good', 'performances', 'step', 'up', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'John', 'Blake', 'young', 'Gotham', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'is/was', 'back', 'game', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Miranda', 'Tate', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'what', 'was', 'name', 'again', 'again', 'Hardy.Bale', 'final', 'turn', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'morose', 'first', 'Bruce', 'having', 'become', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'aftermath', 'Joker', 'Harvey', 'Dent', ""'ve"", 'said', 'years', 'Chris', 'Jonathan', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'more', 'person', 'multiple', 'personas', 'more', 'person', 'secret', 'identity', 'what', 'Christian', 'early', 'how', 'not', 'letting', 'Batman', 'out', 'affected', 'Christian', 'been', 'solid', 'interpretation', 'trilogy', 'What', 'Bale', 'Wayne', 'back', 'Game', 'are', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Blake', 'explaining', 'what', 'Bruce', 'how', 'sudden', 'direness', 'situation', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Selina', 'Kyle.I', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'Hathaway', 'just', 'brilliantly', 'modern-day', 'Selina', 'sharp-tongued', 'skilled', 'high-end', 'jewel', 'thief', 'top-end', 'martial', 'artist', 'protector', 'neighborhood', 'just', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'especially', 'catsuit', 'Kudos', 'Nolans', 'cat-eared', 'goggles', 'Selina', 'interviews', 'completion', 'release', 'movie', 'Hathaway', 'wistfully', 'talked', 'Selina', 'quietly', 'imploring', 'Nolans', 'revisit', 'point', 'Here', 'open', 'hope', 'Nolans', 'DO', 'find', 'path', 'back', 'her.Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'full', 'regrets', 'here', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'first', 'two', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'still', 'sly', 'intelligent', 'inventor', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'had', 'wonderful', 'grip', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'throughout.Again', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'not', 'level', 'magnificent', 'predecessor', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'completion', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy.Plus', 'leave', 'crumbs', 'out', 'there', 'lead', 'new', 'storyline', 'So', 'bravo', 'Christopher', 'Jonathan', 'Christian', 'Michael', 'Gary', 'Morgan', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Anne', 'JG-L', 'Tom', 'Marion', 'well', 'done.Highly', 'recommended']",The Dark Knight Rises

1419389,A324FSNJAF544D,B004LWZWGK,S. Hasse,"[1, 2]","How I rank it, it's better than Batman Begins  but not as amazing as The Dark Knight (but close). However, this is the best ending to a trilogy I think I have ever witnessed in my entire life. What a wonderful movie this is, I saw it 5 times and counting. I will admit I was iffy on how i felt the first time I saw it but after more views I grew to appreciate it. While it doesn't have the perfection that the flawless Dark Knight has, it still suffices and is one of the most powerful films I think I have seen recently. It has such a great ending, very emotional.I am going to make this review short because I do not want to tell too much, it's a movie that I would never forgive myself if I provided any spoilers. First off, the movie does begin 8 years after the Dark Knight, Batman has been a fugitive and therefore missing. Bruce Wayne is beaten up and can barely walk because of all the beatings he took as Batman. He then learns of a man named Bane who is plotting to terrorize Gotham, one of the things that pushes him to put on the Batsuit again. In the film it's about him rising from his fall. I am not giving anymore details on the plot because again, I am not giving you, the reader any spoilers. I can't do it, it's simply the movie that needs to be witnessed and experienced. The movie is intense, Bane is a frightening villain, probably the scariest villain I have seen on the screen. He gave me chills throughout, he unlike, the Joker has an agenda and it's a sinister one.Anyone who has ever read the comics would catch that it's a lot like the story, ""Knightfall"" and ""No Man's Land"" which are two stories that must be read by the way. The movie is loaded with amazing performances, I did mention Bane, Tom Hardy who gives a great, eerie performance. Anne Hathaway is another who stood out. Many whined before seeing it that she wasn't fit for Catwoman, funny, Anne looks like Salina Kyle and acts like her too. Anyone who criticizes her is simply wrong and should probably read a comic for a change. She had that role down to a T. She was sexy and mysterious like she should be. Another great performance that stood out is Michael Caine as Alfred. He was always good, however, he had to give his all in this role it was a performance that really stuck out. These are just a few examples that I can give out.This movie is a prime example on why I hold Christopher Nolan on a pedestal. He can take a big idea and make it practical he doesn't need to go heavy on the CGI to make his films look visually amazing. He proved it many times with Inception, the flawless Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He is without question the greatest filmmaker in this new generation of filmmakers, he and Darren Aronofsky can do no wrong at this point. Nolan is the filmmaker that I hope to be one day. I hope to be able to do what he does. I have seen every Christopher Nolan movie now, he has made nothing but great movies, it's almost as if he's never seen a bad movie nor knows how to make one. All his movies have perfection all over them it's insane how good he is. He's made enough to prove himself if you ask me.I have sang too much praise for The Dark Knight Rises, I will admit the movie does have some flaws here and there, one of them is I felt they needed to develop the character Catwoman a little more and serve her more of a purpose. That's just one, there are some plot holes in it but they're mild plot holes and I will admit there were times I could not understand what the characters were saying. Bane and Jim Gordon were two that I had a difficult time making out what they were saying that needed some work. It was a problem I had with them but it did not stop me from loving the movie. I can go on and on.Christopher Nolan has made the perfect trilogy. The best I have seen since the original Star Wars trilogy. He has proved himself yet again that he is here to stay and is one of the best there is at this time, I love his Batman movies but also his other movies. I can't wait to see what else he has in line for us to watch. I look forward to seeing more works from him and I look forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises yet again.

And it is a Batman movie in which Batman himself rarely appears. It seems to me Chirstopher Nolan wanted to put too many storylines into this movie, it became a mess. There are things I liked about this movie... but when I left the theater I didn't have the same feeling as the previous films. I walk out of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight ready to turn right around and watch them again, Dark Knight left me a little flat. I lot of the movie focused on what the police were doing. This is a Batman movie I want to see Batman for more 20 minutes out of a nearly 3 hour movie. It should have been called Bruce Wayne Rises, it would have made more sense. Of course this movie is well acted and produced.... Directing??? I think Chirstopher Nolan tryed to payoff too many storylines. Visually amazing as always and the effects and the IMAX flimed stuff were beautiful. I'm a huge Comic book fan and I love that Hollywood has discovered Comics as a source for these amazing stories. But as we've seen with Superman Return, Green Lantern, The Fantastic Four and others that a rabid nerd following doesn't mean a success.

1419410,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B004LWZWGK,Steven Hancock,"[2, 5]","In 2005, filmmaker Christopher Nolan gave the Batman film franchise, which had stagnated with the dreadful ""Batman & Robin,"" a powerful rejuvenation with ""Batman Begins,"" a darker, more psychological take on the character that delved into how Bruce Wayne, the son of a slain billionaire and his wife, becomes a fearsome, cloaked hero known as the Batman. Thanks to Nolan's powerful direction, a brilliant script from Nolan and David S. Goyer, and terrific performances from a cast that included Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, ""Batman Begins"" restored faith in the franchise. This was followed in 2008 by ""The Dark Knight,"" which pits Batman against the Joker and his plans to bring anarchy to Gotham City. This film became a box office phenomenon, and won a posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger for his brilliant, and downright creepy performance as the Joker. With these successes behind them, Nolan and the team decided that, instead of dragging the franchise out indefinitely, they would close their version of the Batman story down with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" With high expectations set from two brilliant films, Nolan and his brother Jonathan came up with a brilliant, epic, and emotional story to bring their version of Batman and Gotham City to a powerful conclusion.Like ""The Dark Knight"" before it, the film actually defies the expectations of the viewer, but in a brilliant way. When watching the film, one expects that our hero, with help from others, would successfully end the plans of the villain to take over Gotham, preventing any destruction to the city. Instead, Nolan decided to go against the more traditional route. Here, we see Bane, the main villain of the piece, severely injure our hero, and take him to a prison deemed escape-proof on the other side of the globe to rot, allowing Bane and his army of mercenaries to succeed in the plans to take over Gotham City, and create a ""police state"" with martial law, where the villains control everything, and it is up to a band of ""resistance fighters"" to figure out how to stop Bane. Wayne realizes he must overcome his injuries and fears to escape from the prison, and return to Gotham to stop Bane and his plans to wipe out the city with a Hydrogen Bomb. Wayne also realizes that he might have to give his own life to save his city.At 165 minutes, the film's first hour is somewhat slow, but picks up when Wayne, having been in self-exile for eight years after taking the rap for Harvey Dent's crimes, once again dons the Batman suit to face his toughest enemy. Here, the story kicks into high gear, and leaves viewers on the edge of their seats for the remaining 105-or-so minutes of the film. Nolan's vision to bring grandeur back to the cinemas is clearly evident, as he has crafted a truly epic film, but never forgets the heart of the story, as we see the story of the Dark Knight come full circle, as he faces his greatest test, and must overcome tremendous odds to defeat the enemy. Christian Bale proves once and for all that he owns the dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, giving everything he has to make his final performance in the role truly memorable. Tom Hardy is very good as Bane, despite a tendency to be incomprehensible due to his mask (Which I think was a deliberate choice by Nolan, which makes him more menacing by not knowing what he is saying all the time). Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman also shine in their final performances as Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Lucius Fox. Newcomers, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, and Marion Cotillard also give inspired, solid performances. A welcomed cameo by Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul is also great.Once again, Nolan shows his strong craftsman as a filmmaker, crafting a film that mixes the Comic Book film, war epic and tragedy together in an intense, action-packed film that will leave fans of the trilogy pleased with the outcome. It's not quite as good as the previous film, and it doesn't top ""The Avengers"" as the greatest comic-book film of 2012 (or ever, for that matter), but it definitely ranks with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" as one of the best trilogy-cappers of all time. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes with my highest recommendation to Batman fans, and those who love great films!Grade: A+",5,A FITTING END TO CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S DARK KNIGHT SAGA (Spoilers Involved)!,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,4343,"['2005', 'filmmaker', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'gave', 'Batman', 'film', 'franchise', 'had', 'stagnated', 'dreadful', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'powerful', 'rejuvenation', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'darker', 'more', 'psychological', 'take', 'character', 'delved', 'how', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'son', 'slain', 'billionaire', 'wife', 'fearsome', 'cloaked', 'hero', 'known', 'Batman', 'Thanks', 'Nolan', 'powerful', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'script', 'Nolan', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'terrific', 'performances', 'cast', 'included', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'restored', 'faith', 'franchise', 'was', 'followed', '2008', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'plans', 'bring', 'anarchy', 'Gotham', 'City', 'film', 'became', 'box', 'office', 'phenomenon', 'won', 'posthumous', 'Oscar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'brilliant', 'downright', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Joker', 'successes', 'Nolan', 'team', 'decided', 'instead', 'dragging', 'franchise', 'out', 'indefinitely', 'would', 'close', 'version', 'Batman', 'story', 'down', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'high', 'expectations', 'set', 'two', 'brilliant', 'films', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'came', 'up', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'emotional', 'story', 'bring', 'version', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'City', 'powerful', 'conclusion.Like', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'actually', 'expectations', 'viewer', 'brilliant', 'way', 'When', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'hero', 'help', 'others', 'would', 'successfully', 'end', 'plans', 'villain', 'take', 'over', 'Gotham', 'preventing', 'destruction', 'city', 'Instead', 'Nolan', 'decided', 'go', 'more', 'traditional', 'route', 'Here', 'see', 'Bane', 'main', 'villain', 'piece', 'severely', 'injure', 'hero', 'take', 'prison', 'deemed', 'escape-proof', 'other', 'side', 'globe', 'rot', 'allowing', 'Bane', 'army', 'mercenaries', 'succeed', 'plans', 'take', 'over', 'Gotham', 'City', 'create', 'police', 'state', 'martial', 'law', 'where', 'villains', 'control', 'everything', 'up', 'band', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stop', 'Bane', 'Wayne', 'must', 'overcome', 'injuries', 'fears', 'escape', 'prison', 'return', 'Gotham', 'stop', 'Bane', 'plans', 'wipe', 'out', 'city', 'Hydrogen', 'Bomb', 'Wayne', 'also', 'might', 'have', 'give', 'own', 'life', 'save', 'city.At', '165', 'minutes', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'up', 'when', 'Wayne', 'having', 'been', 'self-exile', 'eight', 'years', 'taking', 'rap', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'crimes', 'once', 'again', 'Batman', 'suit', 'face', 'toughest', 'enemy', 'Here', 'story', 'high', 'gear', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'remaining', '105-or-so', 'minutes', 'film', 'Nolan', 'vision', 'bring', 'grandeur', 'back', 'cinemas', 'clearly', 'evident', 'crafted', 'truly', 'epic', 'film', 'never', 'heart', 'story', 'see', 'story', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'greatest', 'test', 'must', 'overcome', 'tremendous', 'odds', 'defeat', 'enemy', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'once', 'dual', 'role', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'giving', 'everything', 'make', 'final', 'performance', 'role', 'truly', 'memorable', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'very', 'good', 'Bane', 'tendency', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'due', 'mask', 'Which', 'think', 'was', 'deliberate', 'choice', 'Nolan', 'more', 'menacing', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'saying', 'time', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'also', 'shine', 'final', 'performances', 'Alfred', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Newcomers', 'such', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'also', 'give', 'inspired', 'solid', 'performances', 'welcomed', 'cameo', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'also', 'great.Once', 'again', 'Nolan', 'strong', 'craftsman', 'filmmaker', 'crafting', 'film', 'Comic', 'Book', 'film', 'war', 'epic', 'tragedy', 'together', 'intense', 'action-packed', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'trilogy', 'pleased', 'outcome', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'film', ""n't"", 'top', 'Avengers', 'greatest', 'comic-book', 'film', '2012', 'ever', 'matter', 'definitely', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'one', 'best', 'trilogy-cappers', 'time', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'Batman', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'films', 'Grade', 'A+']",The Dark Knight Rises

It is also certainly the worst of the three, behind the average Batman Begins and the fantastic The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises is about the idea that determination leads to triumph over evil. It tries to demonstrate this idea with the main external plot of Save Gotham. This plot is supported by two others. The first is Batman's redemption and Reputation and the second is Catwoman's internal moral compass.The problem for me was that I can find no more than one significant turning point on each of these three plots. On the main plot. Bane goes from triumph to triumph as he enslaves Gotham with no disruption until the end. Similarly, on the Batman Reputation front, it is in the trash until he saves the city at the end. Finally, Catwoman is morally corrupt and betrays Batman ... until the end when she and the whole story turns around on one blazing action packed sequence. Somehow these few dramatic bits are supposed to fill a 2+ hour story. They don't. And the pictorial depiction of Bane's triumph is boring, boring, and boring.

1419415,A26MJME9IBNETY,B004LWZWGK,StrangePegs,"[1, 3]","Nolan Again Impresses......with his ability to obfuscate.I do realize that I'm going to be in the vast minority with my stance on The Dark Knight Rises, but I'm used to that, so I'm just going to go with it.I have one thing to say for Christopher Nolan: he's a magician when it comes to making movies. I mean that in a very literal sense. He uses flashy action to distract us from the holes he leaves behind in the story. We can't see them, because we're too busy looking in the other direction.Or maybe it's just that Marvel has set the bar so high with their string of excellent adaptions that I'm just no longer satisfied with interpretations. Maybe if it was more explicit that these are interpretations, I'd be happier. DC/Warner Brothers could just slap their Elseworlds label on  these things, and I might be more accepting of them. As it is, though, there are so many things that aren't Batman in these movies that I have a hard time dealing with it. Like in Burton's Batman when Alfred brings Vicki Vale down into the Batcave. What?Unfortunately, Nolan has plenty of those moments himself. Like in Batman Begins when Wayne allows Lucius Fox to know that he's Batman. Whereas that was almost acceptable in that movie, those inconsistencies with the source material have continued to snowball to the point that by the time we get to Rises, I can't accept them. I mean, by the end of The Dark Knight Rises half of everyone knows that Wayne is Batman. And we're just supposed to believe that some random cop walks up to Wayne and just knows? Seriously. I get that Nolan needs that for his story, but, give me a break, he knew because he saw it in Wayne's face? At least Tim Drake did the research to figure out that Wayne is Batman. And I don't want to give spoilers, but having his actual name be Robin? It just makes me cringe.However, the big issue for me, the thing that set the big disconnect for me, is that we're supposed to believe that this is 8 years later. That Bruce Wayne just quit being Batman and went into seclusion. I get that Nolan is trying to give us a sense of Miller's Dark Knight comics in which Batman had quit and was in seclusion, but that was because he got old. He even gives us a cane like Wayne uses in Batman Beyond, but, again, in those he got old; Nolan wants us to believe that Wayne just quit. I can't buy it. I absolutely can not buy it.This is where I understand the difference between me, someone that grew up reading Batman comics and was heavily invested in Batman lore for...well, longer than I should have been, and the vast majority of people out there that don't have that same investment. These details aren't important to them. I get that. I also get that I am not really the target audience for the movie. I was the target audience for Batman Begins, because that one was more focused on the fans of the comic, but these last two, after hooking everyone in, have been focused on the general consumer.Even so, the idea with Nolan's Batman is that he is set in the &#34;real world,&#34; and, as such, I still can not accept this 8 year hiatus. He wants us to buy into too many unrealistic ideas:1. After 8 years of no Batman, people are still talking about him. Give me a break. Culturally, we barely hold onto anything for 8 days, and Nolan expects us to believe that people are still saying, after 8 years, &#34;is he coming back?&#34; Not to mention the fact that he has kids, like 10-year-old kids, talking about Batman as if he's a reality to them. Or was a reality to them. Yes, all of this bothers me, because none of it's how the real world works.If he'd made it a year after the events of Dark Knight, maybe even two, it would have been plausible.2. There's a Harvey Dent Day and people care about it. See point 1. No one would care after 8 years. Well, they wouldn't care beyond the fact that it was a day off from work. And it's not clear that they, the common people, do get a day off from work.3. After 8 years, Wayne just puts the suit back on, and it's like he never quit. There are so many problems with this:There is an implication, a strong implication, that Wayne has been doing nothing to &#34;stay in shape&#34; during his seclusion (except, maybe, shooting some arrows). He's just been sulking about. Bodies deteriorate pretty quickly. After just a few months, he would have lost his edge and begun losing muscle mass. After a year, it would have taken considerable training to be able to get back into shape. After 8 years?Aside from the staying in shape aspect of it, Wayne has definitely not been sparring or doing any kind of combat training in those 8 years. As an example of what not sparring can do, you can look at the Foreman/Ali championship fight. Foreman was unable to spar for the entire month leading up to the bout due to an eye injury, and just that one month of not training threw his fighting off so much that he couldn't compete. (Ali won and refused to ever allow Foreman a re-match.)On top of all the not staying in shape and not sparring, Wayne has suffered some sort of debilitating injury that has caused him to need a cane to walk. His body is in bad shape. No, it's in horrible shape. So... 8 years of lounging in seclusion and he can't even walk under his own power, but we're supposed to believe that a high tech knee brace returns him to fighting form? Are you kidding me?While it is true that Alfred voiced concern over these issues, it was given in the sense that it would be a &#34;bad idea&#34; to get back into costume. In truth, it would have been an impossibility. Not to put the costume back on but certainly impossible to be Batman again just like that.If Nolan wants us to believe that this is a Batman that could be in the real world, he needs to keep him in the real world. And don't get me started on the &#34;fusion bomb,&#34; because all of that was just bad science. I'll buy into Wayne creating a fusion reactor, but not turning it into a &#34;time bomb&#34; in the way it was done in the movie. They're equating it to a meltdown in a nuclear reactor, and those things just don't happen on a schedule. Not to mention the last minute save after 5 months. It just doesn't get more cliche than that.Nolan also uses sleight-of-hand to hide facts from us. I don't have an issue with this in a general sense, but it takes away from the enjoyment of watching it again. He did this very successfully in The Prestige, because, in that one, he gave us the clues to figure out what was going on so that when the reveal happened it was your own fault for not figuring it out. I like that kind of cleverness, and doing it that way does make for good repeat viewing, because you can go back and see where the clues were that you missed (like in The Sixth Sense). I dislike, though, when not only is the information hidden but the fact that there is information hidden is hidden. Of course, then, when you do see that coming because you have more lore than the average viewer, there's no surprise, so that twist didn't throw me at all, and that made the viewing experience... less than it could have been.Having said all of that, don't take it that I'm saying that it's a bad movie. It's not. It's a good movie, and I'm glad I saw it in the theater. The acting is good (Oldman is still great as Gordon, Hathaway was good, Gordon-Levitt is quite good), and the action and fight sequences are spectacular. But the movie, if you look beyond those things, is not great",2,Obfuscation,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,7467,"['Nolan', 'Again', 'Impresses', 'ability', 'obfuscate.I', 'do', 'realize', ""'m"",

It was supposed to continue directly from The Dark Knight and end with a grand showdown between Batman and The Joker but sadly this did not happen. Having said that, this movie is spectacular. For many reasons. However, I am going to cite some negatives for a moment, as I feel not enough people have acknowledged these issues. This movie is seriously loaded with plot holes and insane leaps in logic, some I still can't quite get over. I won't get into specifics just in case there a few hermits out there who never made it to the theater to see this (seriously, what's wrong with you?) and also because they're very obvious once you see the film but needless to say, there are many a ridiculous moment in this movie. That's not to say you can't overlook them and still enjoy it. I did. Millions of others did too. I absolutely love this movie. One of my all time favorites. The good significantly outweighs the bad. I can't help but wonder/wish though, what it would have been like if Heath Ledger hadn't died. Think of how THAT movie would have been. *Sigh* Oh well. No sense in dwelling on things like that.

1419430,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B004LWZWGK,T. Bollinger,"[1, 3]","The major summer showdown for 2012 was of course the comic book movie grudge match between DC Comic's/Warner Brothers' `The Dark Knight Rises,' the final entry in writer-director Christopher Nolan's enormously popular Dark Knight Trilogy, and the incredibly ambitious superhero all-star team-up by Marvel Studios and Walt Disney, `The Avengers,' which had been preceded by a four year buildup following the surprise success of 2008&#8242;s `Iron Man,' in which Marvel released four additional films (`The Incredible Hulk' [2008], `Iron Man 2&#8242; [2010], `Thor' [2011], `Captain America: The First Avenger' [2011]), one for each its main superheroes in the Marvel team. While assuredly hundreds of millions of moviegoers were exhausted from a good decade's worth of cinemas supersaturated with superhero movies, starting with Sam Raimi's `Spider-Man' all the way back in 2002, hundreds of millions more eagerly anticipated the super-hyped box office competition between the oldest rivalry in American graphic novel/comic book history. It was Marvel vs. DC yet again, and hopefully this battle between the two would force Hollywood to bite the bullet and actually work for our dollars this time. Hopefully.To put things in perspective, Nolan's TDKR was the heavy favorite in the heavyweight-superhero-movie-showdown of last year, as it had far less to prove than its Marvel opponent, and expectations for the final, voice-garbled installment of the Caped Crusader's best film series were conveniently toned down ever since the death of Heath Ledger in 2008. Everybody knew that Ledger's Joker, unquestionably the standard of the most famous Batman villain, as well as simply one of the best film villains of all time, was going to be a one-time thing. We all hated the situation, but we had to accept it. If anything, expectations for the final chapter in Nolan's series seemed pretty subdued, despite us all knowing that we were gonna see how it turned out regardless. Really, it was quite a great situation for DC Comics and Warner Bros., as they knew people would pack theatres no matter what, given the massive hype that the series had accumulated during its seven-year run, and nobody was expecting another Ledger performance, because Ledger was dead. So in any case, `The Dark Knight Rises, seemed like it was poised to be yet another smash hit for Warner Bros. and DC. But exactly how good was it?To put it bluntly, TDKR is not only the weakest film in Nolan's Bat Trilogy, it's also the least impressive film Nolan has made yet. Now given the guy's commendable consistency in producing quality blockbusters and thought-provoking dramas, that isn't much of a mark against him. `Rises' is still a better-than-average movie, an entertaining blockbuster behemoth, and of course, leagues ahead of anything Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher has done for the Caped Crusader on film. I mean, how can anyone argue that latter point, especially? TDKR is still a good film, and Nolan has done more for Bruce Wayne, Alfred, the Joker, Gotham, and Batman on the big screen than anyone else in the movie industry has by far. With that said, to say that `Rises' feels anywhere near as emotionally powerful and well-designed as either `Batman Begins' (2005) or `The Dark Knight' makes no sense to me, because it simply isn't. Quite frankly, it feels poorly realized and its narrative feels lazily executed compared to the two previous films in the series.The biggest problem with Nolan's final Dark Knight chapter is that its story is poorly developed and is by far the most nonsensical of the trilogy. The film's plot is also the largest in scale and the most ambitious of the three, which explains the  screenplay's inconsistent execution to a large extent. In its obnoxious 165 minute length, `Rises' fails to describe a single, well focused narrative, as its sprawling cast of characters and cliched doomsday conflict continually weigh down the much anticipated conclusion to Nolan's tale. Even `Batman Begins's odd, combined ""double plot""-origin story was more straightforward and effective than this.TDKR heavily stumbles in trying to continue the trilogy's theme of telling a story ""about a city,"" the city of course being Gotham itself. The series has striven (mostly successfully) to illustrate very Dickensian themes of justice vs. revenge, love vs. hatred, and order vs. chaos. In `Rises,' the Dickensian allusions spike at an all-time high in obviousness with Anne Hathaway ominously warning Christian Bale of a ""storm coming"" for the rich who have lived large on borrowed time,  Tom Hardy bellowing speeches of wokring class revolution, giving Gotham ""back to the people,"" (extremely brief) depictions of street riots and mob-run tribunals of the over-privileged rich, and even a reading of the final poignant lines of `A Tale of Two Cities' by Gary Oldman. The story is at its strongest when it is sticking to these Dickensian allusions, because Nolan's trilogy, like Dickens' `Two Cities,' tells the story of a community as a whole (or in the classic novel's case, two communities, London and Paris).Where `Rises' runs into problems is that it doesn't go much beyond those few minutes (at longest) of a single riot and a couple scenes of mob law in terms of portraying the story as that of the city of Gotham. While `Begins' obviously focused a lot on the Gotham projects (the Narrows) and the grim consequences of organized crime on a large scale, and TDK illustrated lots of public outcries for Batman to reveal himself in light of the Joker killings, as well as the best personification of the city's ""spirit"" in the ferry crisis, `Rises' has no community representation anywhere near as significant or sublime as either of its predecessors. Instead, TDKR spends much of its bloated, poorly paced running time introducing dull, uninteresting, unnecessary supporting characters in the forms of handsome heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine. All three of these roles are tedious and their purposes, repetitive. All of them are totally unnecessary.Basically, the movie's attempt to conclude the trilogy's ""story of Gotham city"" feels half-baked because it hardly bothers to establish any emotional connection between the viewer and the city's people, and spends way too much time fleshing out uninteresting side characters we don't care about. All the screen-time devoted to Gordon-Levitt's, Cotillard's, and Modine's characters could have and should have been allotted to adequately flesh out the story of Gotham City, a theme which is frequently and annoyingly teased yet never fully realized in this movie. The ultimate point of this series, or so I thought, was to tell a tale of Gotham from the perspective of its favorite son, not shoving in as many members of the cast from `Inception' (2010) as possible.Another large missed opportunity in the first act of the film is that much of the social inequality that Bane and Selina Kyle despise is never fully fleshed out or illustrated much at all. We hear that the Dent policies have helped stunt organized crime, but we see little of the evils committed by the white collar criminals, such as John Daggett and Philip Stryver, in their wake (why not try and insert a minor Batman villain in these roles, by the way?), and how ""the system"" abuses those without wealth and power. Part of what made `A Tale of Two Cities' so powerful was that it made both opposing groups of the social revolution feel human, because each were written as deep, multi-layered communities who each had a chance to assume power, and who each abused that power. Since we never see or feel much of the wealthy's white collar crimes against the lower classes, Bane's calls for social revolution and the subsequent riots and tribunals feel unwarranted and unrealistic. There is little emotional impact from any of these brief scenes, neither disturbing shock and horror nor grim satisfaction.What's worse, even when story isn't half-assing the city narrative or establishing a meaningless affair between Bale and Cotillard, it has Batman crating around a comical doomsday device in the Bat(wing) when the series supposedly prides itself on ""gritty, grounded realism."" The whole ""blow-the-city-up-with-a-bomb"" plot device took away from the heart of a story that should have been about an ideological war between Bane and Batman, because that's how the entire first half of the film was (weakly) built up -- it fitted in with rest of the series, and most importantly would have kept the tone of the film singular, tight, focused, and more emotionally powerful. We've seen the doomsday conflict play out a million times before, and it's not executed well here at all. Did we really need that in a Dark Knight movie?What is more, some of the most interesting and important supporting characters from the series' previous iterations are reduced to glorified cameo roles and/or serve no purpose in the overall story either. Morgan Freeman shows up very briefly to dump off a ""slick"" knockoff of the cheesy Batwing from `Batman Forever' (1995) (cleverly named ""The Bat"") to Christian Bale before promptly vanishing, Gary Oldman spends half the film in a hospital bed and then spends the remaining half receiving lip from Gordon-Levitt (shame on you, Nolan), and even Michael Caine's Alfred leaves barely 45 minutes into the movie after sloppily revealing the best deception of the entire previous sequel. Caine returns of course in the penultimate epilogue scene so that we can see Bruce Wayne's ""grave sacrifice"" in an overly sentimental happy ending, so I guess there's that.Those are my biggest complaints about TDKR. They don't ruin the movie so much as they just bring it down a couple of big notches. It's just simply not up to par with rest of the series by a long shot...and speaking of those other two movies, what the hell is up with the whole Harvey Dent/Two-Face fiasco WITH NO JOKER? I kid you not, the death of Dent and the matter of his covered-up rampage loom large over this confused narrative, yet the entire context and cause of Dent's fall is never mentioned, namely the fact that he was a direct product of the Joker's terrorizing of Gotham. No big deal, whatever. Nolan and Co's obvious insecurity with unknowing exactly how to deal with Ledger's death really sticks out in `Rises,' which seems highly unnecessary, as I find it hard to believe that Heath's ghost would somehow emerge from the abyss to haunt everybody if his legacy were somehow ""disrespected"" by uttering his most famous character's name and acknowledging his massive presence in the series in its final installment. Really, why could they not talk about the fallout of the Joker, perhaps all the while keeping him locked up in Arkham the whole time off camera? Did the Nolan brothers and David S. Goyer not know how to write the story without Bane releasing all the prisoners of the Asylum? Really? Oh wait, that was Blackgate Prison...Come on, guys, either go the whole nine yards and just admit that the previous movie (the best and most important of the series) actually happened, or write a complete standalone entry to conclude your story of the city of Gotham. One or the other!These are the main problems with `Rises,' not the trivial, minute nitpickings. The real ""nitpickings"" are the boring, lazily choreographed Bane vs. Batman fistfights, the excessively family -friendly PG-13 bullets, and Batman's magical ability to suddenly dispatch the same man who broke his broke his freaking back the last time they fought with relative ease. Was making a brief, Rocky-style combat training montage (perhaps in that ""hellish"" prison) in order to explain Batman's sudden jump in punching proficiency really too much to ask for?Dark Knight RisesDon't get me wrong -- despite all this bitching, TDKR was still a better than average film quite easily, as it's protagonist had a decent (if cheesy and unrealistic) arc, the acting was good from everybody, especially Hardy, and the set pieces, while unnecessarily long and surprisingly cheesy, were exciting enough to keep the movie's pacing afloat for enough of the film to be enjoyable. The score was yet again a big positive for the trilogy, utilizing the powerful ""Rise"" chants to great effect. If this review has made it seem like I hate `Rises,' I apologize because I still like the movie and thought it miles above any of the previous embarrassments by Burton, and especially Schumacher, yet TDKR was nowhere near the standards set by `Begins' and especially TDK, and it was not a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy by any means. I still had fun watching the movie, but the tone of this review is that of disappointment because I was honestly disappointed after seeing TDKR, and for good reason. It just didn't live up the hype.In other words, TDKR is a good film, but not a great film at all. It's handling of the primary themes and tone of The Dark Trilogy, mainly inspired by the French Revolution-themed `A Tale of Two Cities' by Charles Dickens, were lazy, halfhearted, and only partially realized at best. The film's cast, scope, and scale gets way too big for the story's own good, and the movie suffers as a whole because of that.I am more than proud of Nolan's work on this trilogy -- a trilogy that was crafted by his leadership above all else, and a trilogy that returned the iconic superhero of Batman to fine form and to cultural relevancy once again. He did a great job with `Begins' and TDK, but this last installment, not so much. Nolan and crew certainly didn't strike out in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded, but they definitely didn't end the game with a walk-off grand slam either.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 6/10+ Great performances from the whole cast, even though most of the roles were unneeded. Tom Hardy is particularly effective as the physically intimidating Bane, garbled voice and all, who is a welcome change of pace as a villain who finally poses a physical (as well as psychological and ideological) threat to Batman -- at least for one fight, anyway. Nolan once again proved me wrong for doubting his casting of his film's antagonist.+ The action set pieces are still fun to watch despite the lackluster choreography and over-the-top visuals. Hans Zimmer's emotionally resonant score delivers once again.- The film's story fails to deliver the emotional impact of its predecessors due to shifting the focus from the city and Bruce Wayne's mission to a bunch of pointless minor characters. Freeman, Oldman, and Caine are all criminally underused. Nobody seems to know how to deal with Ledger's absence, and it shows.- The presence of cheesy, over-the-top visuals like the IT'SNOTABATWINGOK??? and the comical ""atomic bomb"" feel bizarrely out of place in this film. Furthermore, while the Nolan has finally shown that he can shoot fistfights (mostly) free of super-fast-cut/quick edit shots, the violence in this movie feels quaint, tame, and downright boring. So much for gritty realism.? `Batman Begins': WHERE WERE THE OTHER DRUGS GOING????!!!!! `The Dark Knight': WHERE ARE THEY????!!!!! `The Dark Knight Rises': WHERE'S THE TRIGGER????!!!! Jesus Christ Batman, the next thing you know, you'll be screaming at people about where you left your car keys.? Anyone else think that this movie predicted, albeit clumsily, the Occupy Wall Street movement (the screenplay was finished roughly a year before the movement began)?",3,Missed the Mark,1376352000,"08

We witness all the cliches, one dimensional characters and plot predictability stuffed into a barely coherent story line.The trend of a pseudo-heroine character more aggravating than she's worth to the plot has long been a Hollywood staple.  The audience is subjected to her most nefarious deeds only to be forgiven by and eventually falling in love with the hero. In this regard the strange looking Ms. Hathaway does not disappoint. She has finally found a role that is actually more annoying than she is. At one point Hathaway's villainy surpasses that of Bane's, and three quarters into the movie one cannot help but hope that someone, anyone goes ahead and triggers the nuke ridding us of her odious character once and for all. Alas, wishful thinking- we must endure her presence till the very end.To reward us (or perhaps make amends) for the time wasted on this movie, the writers include a rather pathetic variation on the ""Luke, I am your father"" bombshell.

1419441,ADQTL3OLAR2XY,B004LWZWGK,Thanos of Titan,"[58, 155]","I have seen most of Christopher Nolan's films and liked them and I have been a Batman fan since the Early 80's. I understand many people liked this film, please do not jump all over me, this is just my opinion. I was so excited for this movie in the theater at midnight as it was about to start and by the end of the film I was only frustrated and angry. After having led up to this film so well, I feel Christopher Nolan had just lost interest in the Batman character and was obligated to make this film. So much of it was like Nolan was trying to entertain himself while compromising the Batman character all along. Here's my issues:1.) Too much focus on Bane who was uninteresting and not enough Batman screen time.2.) No Background on Catwoman. Just appears, and then retreats with Batman at the end. Why should we care about this character?3.) The Character of Batman would never A.) Give up Crime fighting for 8 years (even if he had to stop petty crimes. It is who he is!) or B.) Retire from being Batman. Not in the characters nature.4.) I hate the whole time you think you are learning about Bane, then it turns out you don't know much about him, but you do know the entire story of Talia who is in the film for a whole 10 minutes.5.) No payback. Batman never really overcomes his villains. They whup the hell out of him and he still gets pummeled at the end landing one or two lucky shots. Batman should have done better against Bane in the first fight, even though he hadn't been crime fighting for a while, his instincts, past training should have helped him out more. Bane was practically invincible. Nolan's method was all Shock value for the first fight and that equals lazy filmmaking. It was disrespectful to the Batman character. Made him look like a loser.6.) Batman had absolutely no detective skills in the whole series. This series did a poor job of showing Bruce's intelligence. All brawn and no brains. Untrue to the character of Batman. He is a scientist/genius/detective before a fighter.7.) Ridiculous death for Bane. So anti-climatic. Disrespectful to the character.8.) Bruce received no training in the prison that would make him come back and beat Bane. Also, back injuries do not heal that fast.9.) Bane tells Bruce to experience ""The Hell"" he grew up in. The prison was actually pretty nice, with a few helpful and friendly inmates.10.) Cheesy Cliche ending. I did not think Nolan was capable of such a predictable ending.11.) John Blake Character was great until the cheesy Robin comment. Why even Bother? Then Robin is going to be Batman? Confusing.I could go on, but ultimately I just felt Nolan took too many liberties with the characters. Even If I tried to view this as a Nolan film first, it was just a poorly written messy story will no sense of flow or direction. The first Christopher Nolan film I haven't liked...it's too bad it had to be a Batman film too.UPDATE: Judging by some of the comments I think some people have the impression that I didn't understand the film...let me clarify. I think, many people like myself understand what Nolan was trying to do, they just don't like it. It's not that I didn't understand the movie...it's that I understood it and was unhappy with it's direction. I don't want a ""Nolan Universe"" Batman. I want Batman...a representation of the character I have grown up with. Batman has always changed and evolved, and I like that about the character, but I DO NOT like when some pompous director comes along and changes the core elements of one of my favorite characters.ALSO for the many comments claiming I should read ""The Dark Knight Returns"" by Frank Miller...Not only have I read it but I have a collector's edition hardcover version of it. There is no comparison here. Frank Miller wrote a great story which is also a stand alone book not to be considered cannon in Batman's history. It is an alternate take on Batman. Read the comments from Miller himself who has done this often with comic characters. Miller can take liberties because he wrote a great story. Nolan did not, so his liberties have become flaws and a lazy script because he could not close up that trilogy in a proper way without Heath Ledger's Joker.",1,Bad for a Batman Film...Even Worse For a Nolan Film.,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,4201,"['have', 'seen', 'most', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'films', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'Batman', 'fan', 'Early', '80', 'understand', 'many', 'people', 'liked', 'film', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'jump', 'just', 'opinion', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'movie', 'theater', 'midnight', 'was', 'about', 'start', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'having', 'led', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'feel', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'interest', 'Batman', 'character', 'was', 'obligated', 'make', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'Nolan', 'was', 'trying', 'entertain', 'compromising', 'Batman', 'character', 'all', 'along', 'Here', 'issues:1', 'Too', 'much', 'focus', 'Bane', 'who', 'was', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'enough', 'Batman', 'screen', 'time.2', 'Background', 'Catwoman', 'Just', 'then', 'retreats', 'Batman', 'end', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'character', '3', 'Character', 'Batman', 'would', 'never', 'A', 'Give', 'up', 'Crime', 'fighting', '8', 'years', 'even', 'had', 'stop', 'petty', 'crimes', 'who', 'B', 'Retire', 'being', 'Batman', 'Not', 'characters', 'nature.4', 'hate', 'whole', 'time', 'think', 'are', 'learning', 'Bane', 'then', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'do', 'know', 'entire', 'story', 'Talia', 'who', 'film', 'whole', '10', 'minutes.5', 'payback', 'Batman', 'never', 'really', 'villains', 'whup', 'hell', 'still', 'pummeled', 'end', 'landing', 'one', 'two', 'lucky', 'shots', 'Batman', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Bane', 'first', 'fight', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'crime', 'fighting', 'while', 'instincts', 'training', 'should', 'have', 'helped', 'out', 'more', 'Bane', 'was', 'practically', 'invincible', 'Nolan', 'method', 'was', 'Shock', 'value', 'first', 'fight', 'equals', 'lazy', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'disrespectful', 'Batman', 'character', 'Made', 'look', 'loser.6', 'Batman', 'had', 'absolutely', 'detective', 'skills', 'whole', 'series', 'series', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'showing', 'Bruce', 'intelligence', 'brawn', 'brains', 'Untrue', 'character', 'Batman', 'scientist/genius/detective', 'fighter.7', 'Ridiculous', 'death', 'Bane', 'So', 'anti-climatic', 'Disrespectful', 'character.8', 'Bruce', 'received', 'training', 'prison', 'would', 'make', 'come', 'back', 'beat', 'Bane', 'Also', 'back', 'injuries', 'do', 'not', 'heal', 'fast.9', 'Bane', 'Bruce', 'experience', 'Hell', 'grew', 'up', 'prison', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'nice', 'few', 'helpful', 'friendly', 'inmates.10', 'Cheesy', 'Cliche', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Nolan', 'was', 'capable', 'such', 'predictable', 'ending.11', 'John', 'Blake', 'Character', 'was', 'great', 'cheesy', 'Robin', 'comment', 'Why', 'even', 'Bother', 'Then', 'Robin', 'going', 'be', 'Batman', 'Confusing.I', 'could', 'go', 'ultimately', 'just', 'felt', 'Nolan', 'took', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'characters', 'Even', 'tried', 'view', 'Nolan', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'messy', 'story', 'will', 'sense', 'flow', 'direction', 'first', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'too', 'bad', 'had', 'be', 'Batman', 'film', 'too.UPDATE', 'Judging', 'comments', 'think', 'people', 'have', 'impression', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'let', 'clarify', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'understand', 'what', 'Nolan', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie', 'understood', 'was', 'unhappy', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Nolan', 'Universe', 'Batman', 'want', 'Batman', 'representation', 'character', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'Batman', 'always', 'changed', 'evolved', 'like', 'character', 'DO', 'NOT', 'like', 'when', 'pompous', 'director', 'along', 'core', 'elements', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters.ALSO', 'many', 'comments', 'claiming', 'should', 'read', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'read', 'have', 'collector', 'edition', 'hardcover', 'version', 'comparison', 'here', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'wrote', 'great', 'story', 'also', 'stand', 'alone', 'book', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'cannon', 'Batman', 'history', 'alternate', 'take', 'Batman', 'Read', 'comments', 'Miller', 'who', 'done', 'often', 'comic', 'characters', 'Miller', 'can', 'take', 'liberties', 'wrote', 'great', 'story', 'Nolan', 'did', 'not', 'liberties', 'have', 'become', 'flaws', 'lazy', 'script', 'could', 'not', 'close', 'up', 'trilogy', 'proper', 'way', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker']",The Dark Knight Rises

You have to calm down and look at what you have here- Not only the Blu-Ray for your 1080p TV needs but the standard definition DVD as well to go with the code. First let me say I am an iPhone & iPad owner but one thing we have to keep in mind is that not everybody has one or either of these devices. Typical of Apple users, we think we are the only people in existence that are on the right side when Apple is one of the biggest companies that limit our usage in one way or another other. Not only can you stream the Ultraviolet copy on the Apple devices, you can download each one to put on whatever you device you have. Sure, it takes a little longer (about 15 minutes) but it can be done, I have done it. Next- Read the package or product description. It says Ultraviolet Digital Copy not Digital Copy. In my eyes, the straight digital copy is almost useless to me and about 75% of the planet. If you have a smart TV or set top streaming box or a Google TV then you should have access to Vudu or Flixster or any of the other services that are UV compatible. I can access my account from ANYBODY's TV or box and watch a UV title and you are complaining that you can't watch this on a 9.7"" screen? Give me a break, hardly anybody watches a film on a screen that small so much that they are fighting for its existence against a superior format. All that you folks are succeeding in doing here is actually reducing the rating level on the FILM ITSELF, not what is inside the case! Out of the (at this time) 46 negative reviews, most are only about the digital copy. Maybe do a little research first, not just on the item you are buying but also on a newer format that you don't understand instead of ripping on it because it threatens your 10"" screens. We don't like what we don't understand therefore we will not embrace it, such as the case here.  I hated UV, hated it!  Until I actually read what it was, what it was capable of and who was backing it. When the big 4 studios and a bunch of the others are behind it then we can assume this may be around for a while, it could very well be the whole future of home video. I am not only buying UV titles but also titles from retailers like Amazon that are strictly in the cloud. This isn't for everyone by any stretch but it will be once ISP's get put in their place & the cost per film gets reduced more, which has been the case lately. If you are an iWhatever user then buy your films from iTunes, simple as that. If you have an Apple TV box you can watch them on an actual screen where you don't need to squint to catch the finer details.  I don't just own an iPad & and iPhone, I own a Kindle Fire HD, Apple TV box, Nexus 7 tablet, Roku box and a few other devices that have given me the opportunity to try all formats and in my opinion, this is the best route right now. They are giving us the best of both worlds, physical & digital. I thank those who took the time to read this and do not take what I am saying here the wrong way, just use a different forum. Best way to rail against something new is to not buy it. Though I think once you give it a try you will come to like it's convenience. Or not, but give it a try first. Adapt or die as they say.

1419445,A3QK8LDWVJHI7D,B004LWZWGK,TheoStix,"[1, 2]","(Note: This review contains excerpts from my IMDB review and new thoughts on the Blu-Ray release)Directed and Co-Written by Nolan (With his brother Johnathan and fellow screenwriter David S. Goyer), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is as good a follow-up to the previous film as possible.Eight years after the previous film, Bruce Wayne, troubled by the death of Rachel and forced to retire the Batman persona, has become a sort of self-isolated hermit living in his rebuilt mansion. However, a chance encounter with a skillful and gorgeous burglar named Selina Kyle, as well as the emergence of a violent and diabolical new villain called ""Bane"", force him out of retirement, as he resumes the role of the caped crusader.  At the same time, an idealistic and good-hearted cop named John Blake works with Comissioner Gordon to piece together what is happening.After many twists and turns, the stage is set for the final battle for Gotham's soul. And it is an incredible, memorable and fitting conclusion.The film isn't perfect.  The first half-hour or so is a wee-bit sloppy at times, and things don't quite ""gel together"" and make sense until later in the movie.  This is also a simpler story than the prior film and a bit more formula-driven, which might put-off some fans.But everything else was magnificent.  The acting is uniformly fantastic, the action is the best in the series, the story and character development is very solid, and all-in-all, it's a great conclusion to the series.So, for me, the film is about a 4.5 out of 5.  Not quite as perfect as the last film, but darned good.The Blu-Ray is decent for the most part, but didn't impress me as much as the previous film.  I'm not even going to address the whole digital-copy mess that so many other people have already complained about.The picture quality is fantastic.  The film automatically changes aspect-ratios to accomdate for scenes shot in IMAX (some scenes shot on 35mm have ""black bars"", whereas other scenes on the taller and wider IMAX format fill up the entire screen without black bars), which is a bit distracting at first, but allows us to get a good replica of the IMAX image.  The film looks great on Blu-Ray, and in particular, the IMAX scenes are gorgeous and have exquisite detail that DVD just won't give you.  (Sorry DVD crowd, but I've given up on that format, Blu-Ray's the way to go)  The sound quality is great, although the 5.1 audio mix sounded funny coming out of my TV's speakers.  (Dialog was occasionally over-powered by music and sound in a way that I didn't experience in theaters)  But it might have just been my TV.The special features are decent, but didn't impress me as much as the last film's Blu-Ray release.  There's about an hour (maybe an hour and a half) of Behind-the-Scenes featurettes, which are interesting and informative.  But for whatever reason, even though the last two movies had an option to play them along with the movie (in a way that the movie would transition into the featurettes, before resuming after), this one puts them on a seperate disc.  It felt inconsistant.There is also a very cool hour-long documentary on the history of the Batmobile that is the highlight of this release.But other than that, there's only really a trailer/promotional art gallery, and it felt kind of anti climactic.But all-in-all, it's a solid set of features, and I'd give the Blu-Ray a solid 4.5 out of 5.So, all-in-all, this is deffinitely a Blu-ray set to buy!  I'd highly recommend it.",5,Great Movie (4.5/5) and Decent Blu-Ray Release (4.5/5)...

1419463,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B004LWZWGK,Tom Birkenstock,"[6, 10]","By now even those who dislike Christopher Nolan's Batman triptych have been so beaten into submission that, in lieu of screaming ""uncle,"" they have conceded that the trio of films serve as a sort of repository of all of the anxieties running through the first decade or so of the new millennium.  They may disagree about the quality of the films themselves, but after seven years everyone agrees that these movies have established themselves as important cultural artifacts.  In particular, I've enjoyed that Nolan has somehow managed to hoist his personal vision of the world in front of millions and it has still connected with large swaths of audiences.  The blockbuster as personal missive approach to filmmaking has become increasingly rare, because either the audience or the studio have rejected those directors (see: Lee's Hulk, Singer's Superman Returns, and Raimi's Spiderman series).  These days it seems as if Nolan is one of a few directors with the clout to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his own personal vision.So where does The Dark Knight Rises, the epic finale square with its predecessors?  Does it consistently meld its fantastical premise with a real world aesthetic like Begins?  Does it successfully tangle with questions of ethics like the sequel?  Well, not exactly.  At two hours and forty-five minutes, the film is unwieldy (how could it not be).  But it still manages to stick its landing, providing a satisfying and logical conclusion to one of the most distinct movie series of the last ten years.The Dark Knight Rises plays out like a dialectic of the first two films, stringing along the two main threads of the previous installments - the League of Shadow's terrorist attack and the moral fall and death of Harvey Dent - and combining them.  Because the people of Gotham still believe in Harvey Dent's martyrdom, the lie concocted by Batman and Gordon at the end of The Dark Knight, they have come together and passed something called the ""Dent Act,"" which has helped clear the streets of criminals.  It isn't exactly clear what was in the Dent act, but apparently it was controversial enough for some politicians to push for repeal.  The dramatic cut in crime has formed a city that no longer needs Batman as its protector, and Bruce Wayne hasn't worn the cape and cowl since the end of the second film, eight years ago in movie time.  After a stunningly shot jail break in mid air, the film opens with a large gala at the Wayne mansion, but Wayne himself is absent, leading one party-goer to suggest that he may be growing out his finger nails and filling jars with urine in solidarity with Howard Hughes.During the gala one of the maids, suspiciously played by the headlining starlet Anne Hathaway, makes her way into a largely abandoned wing of Wayne manor.  Of course, Hathaway is playing Selina Kyle, better known as Catwoman (although that name is never used).  And after a confrontation with her reclusive host, she slips out with some pearls and copies of Bruce Wayne's finger prints.  The pearls are for her while the fingerprints are for a mysterious new player in Gotham who happen to be a front for the League of Shadow, the same terrorist organization that trained Bruce Wayne and then later attempted to destroy Gotham in the first film.Like a lot of people, I was skeptical of Hathaway's ability to play Catwoman.  She has a tendency to find roles that take advantage of her mostly chipper attitude, and I wasn't sure she would be able to convincingly beat up guys twice her size on screen.  Luckily, my skepticism was misplaced.  Hathaway is easily one of the best elements of the movie.  Most of Nolan's Batman films are shrouded in a decidedly pessimistic view of humanity, an element that is both refreshing in a blockbuster but also, at times, oppressive.  Hathaway provides a respite from the heavier aspects of Rises because she's one of the few characters who seems to actually enjoy herself from time to time.  When she first stumbles upon Wayne during her burglary she starts by playing innocent, but when he calls her out on her lying Hathaway's entire demeanor shifts, from the way she speaks to how she holds herself.  Throughout the film Hathaway plays Selina Kyle as mercurial, and we never really know which side she's on or whether or not she has gained or lost the upper hand.The central antagonist, however, is Bane, the new leader of the League of Shadows.  Rumors about Bane suggest that he comes from a prison pit in one of the more brutal corners of the world.  It is nearly impossible for any prisoner to scale this pit and gain his freedom, and although many of tried, Bane is the only one who has made it out alive.  Bane's approach to leading the League of Shadows is different from Ra's al Ghul's.  Where Ra's obscured the violence of the terrorist group through reasonable sounding rhetoric and Liam Neesom's proper British accent, Bane himself appears to be brutality incarnate.  Without hesitation he guns civilians down but seems to prefer killing people with his bare hands.His followers also have a religious-like devotion, dutifully sacrificing their lives upon a simple request, which Bane makes in the same perfunctory manner that a boss might when asking for a TPS report.  But it's not exactly clear why Bane himself garners such allegiance from his acolytes beyond the mythology surrounding his emergence from the pit.  Tom Hardy, who has put in some great performances in his career, is constrained by a mouth piece that not only serves to obscure his facial expressions, but also distorts his voice, which ends up sounding like Sean Connery with laryngitis.  The end result can look menacing in a fight, but when Hardy has dialogue to deliver, his tools as an actor are hobbled.  This is no more apparent than when Bane gives an impassioned speech to Gotham's downtrodden, but the audience can't even see his mouth move, and his vocal range is electronically suppressed.Bane's goal is not only to break Batman but also to hold Gotham hostage, cutting it off from the outside world and allowing the city residents to turn on each other.  After a vicious battle against Batman where Bane methodically dismantles his opponent, the League of Shadows proceeds to blow up any egress from the city and arm a nuclear weapon, which they are prepared to detonate if the U.S. military takes action against them.  The sequence is impressive in the way that it manages to make the stakes suitably and improbably high, a difficult task coming off of the threat of the Joker.  While Batman is trapped in the same prison that once held Bane, the citizens of Gotham plot to bring down the League of Shadows.Bane's ideology and the film itself are peppered with pseudo-populist sentiment about inequality and class.  Selina Kyle, who has had to scramble to survive her entire life, resents Wayne and his high society peers.  And when Bane has finally cut Gotham off from the outside world his first move is to release all of the prisoners from jail.  Unfortunately, the film's handling of class issues is muddle at best and downright moronic at worst.  After Bane releases Gotham's prisoners, waves of the resentful underclass spread out over Gotham smashing the homes of the city's economic elite.  But it's unclear if all of this terror is a part of some Marxist dialectic, or if they're just angry prisoners.  The film suggests that the Dent Act, which is vaguely defined, has prevented parole for many of the prisoners and has in turn stoked much of their anger.  But later, these criminals form a twisted version of the judicial system in a kangaroo court headed up by none other than Dr. Crane a.k.a. the Scarecrow.  We're supposed to be incensed by a court whose sole purpose is to sentence its subjects because the verdict of guilty has already been determined, but we're not asked to question whether the Dent Act affected potentially reformed convicts who may have lingered in jail for years, or wonder about the potential for false conviction present in most attempts to create a tougher, more rigid judicial system.All of Nolan's philosophizing has the bong scented whiff of a dorm room soliloquy.  In the previous films the ethical and moral questions were wonderful thought puzzles buried within exciting action movies, but here the very premise of these concerns fall apart the moment you think about them.  The obvious contemporary parallel to the film's class anger is the Occupy Wall Street movement and the 2008 financial crash.  But is the inclination to open prison doors and suspend the right to a fair trial really all that similar to increasing the top tax bracket by three percent and reinstituting economic safety guards put in place after the Great Depression, like the Glass-Steagall Act?  Nolan himself has distanced the film from real world events and claims that much of it is based off of the Charles Dickens classic A Tale of Two Cities.  And at times it seems as if Chris and his brother Jonathan want to be writing novels instead of making movies (which would explain the incredible amount of exposition that at times bogs down their plots).  But this doesn't necessarily solve the problem that, unlike much of Dickens's work, the moral quandaries found in this film are not well thought out.But despite all of this, I enjoyed the film.  When it started to wobble, and it does from time to time, the movie got a boost from the emotional resonance that carried over from the first two movies.  Nolan does not treat this Batman series as a movie studio franchise, a fungible property that can be turned out by any number of studio approved directors.  If anything The Dark Knight Rises puts a cap on the series, and anyone would be hard pressed to awkwardly continue Nolan's story except for Nolan himself (and my guess is that he will be out of the Batman business for some time).  This is a situation where the studio should wait a decade or so, give the audience some distance from Nolan's vision of Batman, and then completely reinvent the character with a young and hungry director.  Whether you loved Nolan's movies or hated them, you must admit that the character has so clearly become his in the public eye that it will take some time before anyone will accept a Batman film that isn't helmed by Nolan.  Rises may not reach the heights of its predecessors, but its surprisingly moving denouement proves that it is possible to spin fully realized characters out of a world of superheroes.",3,Batman Versus

1419469,A185QFJRTB5W93,B004LWZWGK,"TrailsEndWild ""Writer/Researcher""","[0, 3]","(Spoiler Warning) Not exactly sure why this is such a highly regarded movie.  It has to be the absolutely weakest in the Nolan franchise.  Like it or not, Bane is one dimensional.  Having read the original debut of Bane in the comics when he first appeared, I have to say not much has changed with Nolan's interpretation.  At least back then he had a little depth, but was never supposed to be a brain surgeon.  I do not understand why one would give someone who is supposed to be a drug-raged brute such a calm and distinguished voice.  In actuality, the voice was the only thing I liked bout the character at all.  Further, Bane is made out to be some evil genius who seems to have absolute control over everyone around him, yet he is ""fatally"" taken out with one shot from the Bat-Pod...Really?  That is how you defeat the villain who just spent the entire movie breaking Batman?  Bane = plain boring, 'nuff said.  Next there is Catwoman.  She added nothing to this movie, should never have been in this movie, and is the least interesting of Batman's rogues gallery.  Oh, but that's right, we have to put a pretty girl in a tight outfit into the film for the 13 year old male fans.  Oh joy, Nolan finally introduced us to his interpretation of Robin!  Anyone who didn't see that coming from Blake's first appearance is just an idiot.  I can't stand Robin and despise the very concept of Robin, however, it would have been cool to see him in a pseudo-Nightwing role.  Lastly, Alfred and Fox were way under-utilized.  Genius actors set by the wayside.  Sad.  Oh, did I forget to mention Batman?  That is probably good since he was hardly in this film at all.  That is actually a plus, because Bale plays a much better Bruce Wayne than a Batman.  He is far more intriguing as Wayne and perhaps this is the only thing this film gets right.  It focuses on Bruce Wayne, and tries to move past ""Batman.""  It is because of that modicum of depth that the film earns two stars instead of none.

1419471,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B004LWZWGK,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[9, 14]","Christopher Nolan faced a seemingly insurmountable uphill battle with The Dark Knight Rises. Ignoring for a moment our sky high expectations, The Dark Knight trilogy faced the deadly ""third movie"" curse, which has sunk so many otherwise great franchises. In the crowded superhero landscape, where The Avengers can make over $1B in just a couple of months, Nolan's movies are in such a unique, singular place that they don't have to compete with Marvel and their shared universe. His biggest competition is with his own, well-established greatness that has sent our hopes for the finale soaring.With those expectations comes the realization that ""sticking the landing"" is the hardest part of every trilogy, but if there's anyone who could shatter that trend it would be Nolan. While it was clear that he was still finding his footing with Batman Begins, Nolan's confident clarity of vision took hold in The Dark Knight, and sharpened to laser precision in The Dark Knight Rises. We've never seen an epic hero's journey quite like this before. The Dark Knight trilogy breaks beyond the confines of the traditional superhero movie into something unrecognizable; thrilling in the way you know something truly special is unfolding right before your eyes. For good reason, many will enter into this film thinking Nolan could never best the spectacular heights of The Dark Knight, but those people will exit The Dark Knight Rises with their minds blown and a totally new outlook.It's best to look at The Dark Knight trilogy as one complete story, and in that sense the events of the previous film hang heavy over Gotham City. Nolan's movies have always been about legacy, and in this case the legacy of two men continues to loom: the Joker, and District Attorney Harvey Dent. It's now eight years since Batman willingly took the blame for Dent's crimes, saving Gotham from learning the truth of his crashing fall from grace. In the wake of the Joker's rampage, new laws have been enacted that have essentially cleaned the crime-ridden city up, with Batman not having been seen in years. Looking more world weary than ever, Commissioner Jim Gordon(Gary Oldman) knows the truth. That the peace is just a mirage, built on a mountain of lies and deception.Others see Gotham's peace in a different light. The city's wealthy have only grown more insulated over the years, the wealth disparity widening as the poor continue to struggle. There may not be people dying in the streets anymore, but Gotham's corruption continues to eat away at it from the inside, and certain parties are looking to exploit the plight of the downtrodden to their advantage.  Yeah, this is Nolan's most overtly political film yet, shining a spotlight on much of the anger that festers in today's society, where the rich get all the breaks and the poor just....break. Bane(Tom Hardy), a masked, hulking figure seeks to harness that rage against the top 1%, and burn Gotham City to ashes.Where's Bruce Wayne during all this? Holed up in his study like Howard Hughes(minus the urine jars), more of a myth than an actual man at this point. Broken down and beaten both physically and emotionally, he's a shadow of his former self. The indomitable will that seemed to radiate from him at all times is gone, leaving only a shell. It's only when his home is broken in to by a sleek and sexy cat burglar named Selina Kyle(Anne Hathaway), that he begins to feel inklings of the old curiosity again. That detective spirit starts to emerge as he checks into her background, discovering that his old enemies, the League of Shadows, may be alive and well and in Gotham City.Rare is the film that can take you on a roller coaster of emotions quite the way The Dark Knight Rises does, and it's safe to say you'll probably cry a couple of times, while also feeling the exhilaration of Nolan's epic direction. The film has a larger than life scope from the very beginning, kicking off with a breathtaking aerial hijacking that puts the latest Mission: Impossible to shame. Batman's conscience, the heart and soul of the Caped Crusader, has always been his loyal butler and caretaker, Alfred(Michael Caine), but this story sees them reaching a heartbreaking impasse. It's the natural evolution of their relationship, and watching it unfold is probably the toughest part of the film, even worse than watching Batman get beaten to a bloody pulp.And get beaten like a dog Batman surely does. Bane poses a threat the likes of which Batman has never seen. The Scarecrow was merely a psychological threat, while the Joker was lunatic id run amok. Bane is as coolly confident and unafraid as Batman ever was, and is superior in every way physically. More than that, he's equipped with a similar fanatical purity of his beliefs, which strengthens him and inspires others to die for his cause. Batman's visage, created to inspire fear in his enemies, has also become a rallying point of sorts, most notable to Thomas Blake(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an altruistic cop who joins the fight to save Gotham. Miranda Tate(Marion Cotillard), inspired by Bruce Wayne's philanthropic notions, seeks to join him in a secret energy project that has gained Bane's unwanted attention.Bale's performance as Batman has always bothered me in that it never quite measures up to that of his co-stars. He was woefully overmatched by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, to the point where that film felt smaller when the Joker wasn't on screen. Here, Bale gives what I think is his best turn of the series yet, portraying Bruce Wayne as a guy who is still bound by his family legacy. He's still endeavoring to measure up to his father. Despite all the suits and weapons and fancy vehicles, Bruce Wayne is still the kid who stood helplessly by while his parents were murdered. Those who saw Tom Hardy in the MMA flick, Warrior, know the terrifying volatility he can bring, and he does much the same here. Only what makes Bane even scarier is his nonchalant attitude, and the fact you can only understand about half of what he's saying.  Hathaway doesn't get enough to work with to surpass Michelle Pfeiffer's iconic performance as Catwoman, but she's got the sultry and conflicted character down to a tee. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Marion Cotillard are all typically outstanding, but I think people will be mostly surprised by how well Joseph Gordon-Levitt steps into the big leagues here.Clocking in at roughly 2 hours and 45 minutes, you never feel for a second that the film is dragging along or being padded out to fill time. Every scene that Nolan leaves in is essential, even as he diverts some of his attention to the subplots of the supporting characters. Every one has their natural arc, fully realized and having a major impact on the final battle. Nolan ups the ante in just about every respect, ramping up the stakes to an incredible degree, and plunging Batman into the depths of despair. There's no need to be a comic book fan to understand the redemptive quest Batman faces, or to appreciate the numerous other themes Nolan has seamlessly weaved into the story. It's always been about what drives the man in the suit, not how the suit drives the man.As the bittersweet final minutes began to creep up, it was impossible not to start thinking about the legacy Christopher Nolan is leaving behind.  Nobody has left their stamp on a character quite like this. Certainly not Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher and their candy colored circus versions. Nolan has taken one of the most iconic characters in pop culture history, and totally redefined him in a way that nobody will be able to touch it. Certainly, others will try, but it will be a long time from now in order to escape from Nolan's shadow.  In the most simple terms, Christopher Nolan has crafted the best Batman story ever told.",5,"An epic, masterrful conclusion to the greatest Batman story ever told",1342569600,"07 18,

Obviously it's a matter of opinion, but if you like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight I think you'll love this move. The film is a masterpiece of cinematography, and in a similar way to Lord of the Rings depicts an epic story on an epic scale. I think it's hard for people to accept this movie as rivaling the second because it would almost be sacrilege to feel they were somehow diminishing Ledger's Joker by putting it on an equal plane. Bane as the main villain in Rises is as unforgettable a character as the Joker in his own right, evoking both hatred and a sense of compassion for him, and really paying homage to The Dark Knight by creating a truly worthy end to the series. Nothing will ever take away the perfect performance of Ledger as the Joker, but every character in all of these films was acted to perfection, and that includes this movie. The whole rebooted Christopher Nolan franchise took Batman to a new level, and finally did justice to the comic and the intended portrayal of the world of Batman. If nothing else rent it, but if you are a fan it should be added to the collection. And if you like video games, start with Arkham Asylum which continues in it's own right what the films started.UPDATE: In reading many of the bad reviews, I have come to realize that most of the them took 10 to 20 seconds to give this movie a terrible rating/review out of boredom a.k.a. attention deficit disorder. If you have an attention span and like the previous movies, you'll probably be able to sit through this too, and actually enjoy it. It has a plot, and requires some thinking and attention to detail.

1419488,A3O3Z5GBU9DH1O,B004LWZWGK,W. A. H.,"[24, 49]","******SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!*******I saw the movie in the theaters, and I thought it was slow, plodding, and all over the place. BUT, I had gone to the ""Marathon"" showing, so we're talking sitting in a theater for 5 1/2 hours watching the first two before even getting to this one.So, I thought maybe I was just movie'd out and tired.So, I rented it last night to give it a fair shake.Didn't help.First off, this movie broke the two rules that have killed every superhero movie I've ever seen, especially for a finale:1. Don't introduce new characters that you have to spend all this time on to give a backstory.2. Never have two enemies for the hero to fight in one movie, because you end up giving each character getting a half-assed story, because once again, both characters need a backstory.The movie starts with Gotham already cleaned up and crime-free.Why take it so far down the road?The title The Dark Knight Rises implied, to me, at least, that Batman, now hunted for killing Harvey Dent would return to save Gotham and finally be hailed by its people as their protector.Nope.Instead of Bane staying what he was in the comic books-a drug kingpin-they make him a merc. They give him a mask, which makes him sound like the love-child of Sean Connery and Darth Vader, who possibly suffered a severe concussion at birth, making him hard to hear sometimes.Then we get Catwoman, whose character does nothing but drag this thing out to almost a whopping 3 hours.SCHINDLER'S LIST WAS THREEE HOURS!BATMAN IS NOT SCHINDLER'S LIST!Bane and Batman finally have a fight, and, of course, Batman never attempts to rip this pain-killing mask off his face. No, Bane, instead breaks his back a-la DC's Broken Bat.So, now, after enduring Catwoman's needless presence, Bane's long-winded diatribes, we have to sit and watch Bruce get out of a hole while learning life lessons from his fellow hole-dwellers. It's like Disney only with ruptured discs And Bruce does try to get out of that hole. Try, after try, after try.Meanwhile, Bane is in Gotham, took it over. Spouts, ""People of Gotham, the city is yours. You're free!"" And they are free, unless you count the fusion device he'll explode if they try to leave.You've got the intrepid young cop, who magically knows Bruce is Batman, because he looked into his eyes. Kinda like the way George Bush looked into Putin's eyes and knew he was an okay guy.And guess what?He's Robin!What?You've got Daggett in there, you've got the Scarecrow in there, you've got Matthew Modine in there for no other reason than I guess he knows Chris Nolan, Jim Gordon has the pleasure of having his reputation ruined, Alfred gets kicked out because Bruce is all Emo now, and at the end you get . . . wait for it . . . TALIA!Why?Because you can't have a stew without carrots!Let's just chuck 'em all in there for the last big bang!But what happened to the Fusion Bomb?Batman flies in and grabs it with his Bat Plane and carries it out over Gotham Bay and it explodes!He saved Gotham!He also irradiated the water supply, but that's beside the point.The whole movie looked like a mash-up of two, maybe three scripts, thrown together to make something so dull and stupid, it was excruciating.And, must've been an ego thing, at the end, we see Bruce in an outdoor bistro with Selena after faking his own death, ready to live the quiet life.So, I walked into this movie expecting to see The Dark Knight Rises . . .And what I got was The Dark Knight Retires.",1,This Movie Started Out Slow And Ended A Mess,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,3473,"['******SPOILER', 'WARNING', '*******I', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'plodding', 'place', 'BUT', 'had', 'gone', 'Marathon', 'showing', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sitting', 'theater', '5', '1/2', 'hours', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'even', 'getting', 'one.So', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'movie', ""'d"", 'out', 'tired.So', 'rented', 'last', 'night', 'give', 'fair', 'shake.Did', ""n't"", 'help.First', 'off', 'movie', 'broke', 'two', 'rules', 'have', 'killed', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'especially', 'finale:1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'have', 'spend', 'time', 'give', 'backstory.2', 'Never', 'have', 'two', 'enemies', 'hero', 'fight', 'one', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'character', 'getting', 'half-assed', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'characters', 'need', 'backstory.The', 'movie', 'Gotham', 'already', 'cleaned', 'up', 'crime-free.Why', 'take', 'so', 'far', 'down', 'road', 'title', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'implied', 'least', 'Batman', 'now', 'hunted', 'killing', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'would', 'return', 'save', 'Gotham', 'finally', 'be', 'hailed', 'people', 'protector.Nope.Instead', 'Bane', 'staying', 'what', 'was', 'comic', 'books-a', 'drug', 'kingpin-they', 'make', 'merc', 'give', 'mask', 'sound', 'love-child', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'who', 'possibly', 'suffered', 'severe', 'concussion', 'birth', 'making', 'hard', 'hear', 'sometimes.Then', 'get', 'Catwoman', 'character', 'nothing', 'drag', 'thing', 'out', 'almost', 'whopping', '3', 'hours.SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'WAS', 'THREEE', 'HOURS', 'BATMAN', 'NOT', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'Bane', 'Batman', 'finally', 'have', 'fight', 'course', 'Batman', 'never', 'rip', 'pain-killing', 'mask', 'face', 'No', 'Bane', 'instead', 'breaks', 'back', 'a-la', 'DC', 'Broken', 'Bat.So', 'now', 'enduring', 'Catwoman', 'needless', 'presence', 'Bane', 'long-winded', 'diatribes', 'have', 'sit', 'watch', 'Bruce', 'get', 'hole', 'learning', 'life', 'lessons', 'fellow', 'hole-dwellers', 'Disney', 'only', 'ruptured', 'discs', 'Bruce', 'try', 'get', 'hole', 'Try', 'try', 'try.Meanwhile', 'Bane', 'Gotham', 'took', 'over', 'Spouts', 'People', 'Gotham', 'city', 'yours', ""'re"", 'free', 'are', 'free', 'count', 'fusion', 'device', ""'ll"", 'explode', 'try', 'leave.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'intrepid', 'young', 'cop', 'who', 'magically', 'Bruce', 'Batman', 'looked', 'eyes', 'Kinda', 'way', 'George', 'Bush', 'looked', 'Putin', 'eyes', 'knew', 'was', 'okay', 'guy.And', 'guess', 'what', 'Robin', 'What', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Daggett', 'there', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Scarecrow', 'there', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'other', 'reason', 'guess', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'pleasure', 'having', 'reputation', 'ruined', 'Alfred', 'kicked', 'out', 'Bruce', 'Emo', 'now', 'end', 'get', 'wait', 'TALIA', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'stew', 'carrots', 'Let', 'just', 'chuck', 'last', 'big', 'bang', 'what', 'happened', 'Fusion', 'Bomb', 'Batman', 'grabs', 'Bat', 'Plane', 'out', 'Gotham', 'Bay', 'saved', 'Gotham', 'also', 'irradiated', 'water', 'supply', 'point.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'looked', 'mash-up', 'two', 'maybe', 'three', 'scripts', 'thrown', 'together', 'make', 'something', 'so', 'dull', 'stupid', 'was', 'excruciating.And', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ego', 'thing', 'end', 'see', 'Bruce', 'outdoor', 'bistro', 'Selena', 'faking', 'own', 'death', 'ready', 'live', 'quiet', 'life.So', 'walked', 'movie', 'expecting', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', '.And', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Retires']",The Dark Knight Rises

In this concluding volume, we are introduced to the masked terrorist Bane, as he covertly subverts a CIA plane and swiftly proceeds to exterminate the crew. His physical prowess is matched only by his talents for cruelty and breaking people in mind and spirit.Cut to Gotham, where Commissioner Gordon gives a speech on the eighth anniversary of Harvey Dent's death. Not only is it now a public holiday, but it made possible the passage of legislation that empowered the police to round up a thousand members of organised crime. The war on crime appears to be won (with their next task, according to a young officer by the name of Blake, being chasing up overdue library books). Power-hungry politicians predict Gordon's early retirement, courtesy of the mayor. After all, who needs heroes in a time of universal peace? A week is a long time in politics, and eight years is an even longer time for Bruce Wayne, who has become disheveled, disillusioned and jaded. The loss of Rachel Dawes has turned him into a cripple with a goatee.There is action, romance and black humour aplenty (Johnathan Crane makes a brief appearance in the movie's latter half). While there are a few elements in common with The Dark Knight, these do not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film. Plotwise, everything comes full circle, character development is wrapped up very nicely, and there is little more that one could ask from a summer blockbuster. Although clocking in at 2 hours and forty minutes (before credits), nothing feels padded out.Unexpected twists abound, but without giving too much away, The Dark Knight Rises boldly goes where no other Batman film has gone before.

In ""Dark Knight Rises"", another Nolan masterpiece, the genius director does exactly that.For a basic plot summary, ""Dark Knight Rises"" sees Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), now a sort of shut-in hermit, retired from the role of Batman as Gotham City has rallied around the Harvey Dent myth in order to clean up its streets.  When jewel thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) breaks into Wayne Manor and steals a family heirloom, however, Bruce is curious enough to pursue her.  Along the way, Bruce stumbles into a new plot from the League of Shadows, now led by the seemingly unstoppable Bane (Tom Hardy), and realizes that Batman must return.  However, the transition back to the Caped Crusader, as predicted by butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and ""gadget guy"" Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), is not as easy as it seems.This is one of those movies where not a single scene or character emotion is wasted.  It runs for two hours and 45 minutes, but it seems like nothing due to the fact that the narrative is practically seamless in the way that it holds the viewing interest.  This is accomplished in a variety of different ways, including...-A storyline that is the natural continuation (and ending) of the Nolan/Bale Batman trilogy.  Each movie (""Begins"", ""Knight"", & ""Rises"") are stand-alone achievements in their own right, yet they are also part of a coherent whole that is ended by this chapter.-Characters so compelling that they almost seem real.  In a stroke of genius, Nolan takes the new villain-Bane-and, in his own way, makes him just as interesting as Heath Ledger's Joker (quite an arduous task if you've seen ""Dark Knight"").  You known the character development is spot-on when you start actually feeling a bit frightened of a certain character, as I did on numerous occasions regarding Bane.  He is that visceral of a presence.  Hathaway's Kyle/Catwoman also provides a strong (if perhaps at times rushed) presence to the film, as she is the one who truly draws Bruce Wayne back into social society once again.-The soundtrack and cinematography complement each other perfectly.  You don't see much see or hear as FEEL the chant from Bane's underground prison, or the roar of the Batpod as it motors down Gotham's streets.-The actual ending scene(s) themselves, which (while I won't give them away here) are perhaps the most perfect way I have ever seen a director end such a large and expansive franchise.  Nolan's ""Batman mythology"" is complete, yet the story continues (if that makes any sense).Simply put, ""Dark Knight Rises"" is one of the overall finest films ever produced, considering the scale of what it had to accomplish and the expectations it was living up to.  Rarely has such a movie been made that has absolutely everything and can appeal to such a large audience (plus being based on a fictional superhero to boot!).

To be completely honest I did think that the Dark Knight was a little bit overrated, I enjoyed it, but it was not as good as everyone made it out to be.

This tale is more cerebral.  Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city.  It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic.  There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys.  The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing.  I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale.  The acting is great.  The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman.  Give him a lozenge.  I want to see Batman kicking butt.  This film had too little of that.  As I said, Batman was a dud in this film.  Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities.  It is worth a watch, but do not expect anything supremely entertaining.  It has some thrills, but nothing like the previous two movies.",3,Eh.  Meh.  Neh.
