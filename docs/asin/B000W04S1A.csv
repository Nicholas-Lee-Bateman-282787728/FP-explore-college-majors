After the first 3 minutes I wanted to turn it off because I had no idea what was going on, or who the characters were. There is a home break-in (lead by a former LAPD detective). All the people are killed except for one thief(Danny played by A.J. Buckley) and one man(Finn played by Yul Vazquez). They are placed in separate ""boxes"" and asked to make statements, which are extremely conflicting. Early on we find out there is a girl who used the name Sasha (M&iacute;a Maestro). She would scam rich men. There is some money involved, but no one talks too much about it. As the interrogators poke holes in their statements, their story changes. These we see as flashbacks. (Much of the movie is a flashback, but it works well.) I felt like I was watching ""12 Angry Men"" where I knew I would end up opposite from where I started.Gabrielle Union plays a tough savvy interrogator who is not afraid to intimidate or drop the f-bomb. Well cast. Well acted. Well written. Well directed. This is what indie films should be. That is Michael Matthias and not Vin Diesel. Also stars Anjelah Nicole Johnson, former Oakland Raider Cheerleader.Frequent f-bombs, very brief nudity (uncredited silicon blonde walking out of pool).",5,Brilliantly Done,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,1256,"['box', 'refers', 'interrogation', 'room', 'first', '3', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'turn', 'off', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'who', 'characters', 'were', 'home', 'break-in', 'lead', 'former', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'one', 'thief', 'Danny', 'played', 'A.J', 'Buckley', 'one', 'man', 'Finn', 'played', 'Yul', 'Vazquez', 'are', 'placed', 'separate', 'boxes', 'asked', 'make', 'statements', 'are', 'extremely', 'conflicting', 'Early', 'find', 'out', 'there', 'girl', 'who', 'used', 'name', 'Sasha', 'M', 'iacute', 'Maestro', 'would', 'scam', 'rich', 'men', 'money', 'involved', 'one', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'interrogators', 'poke', 'holes', 'statements', 'story', 'changes', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'Much', 'movie', 'flashback', 'well', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'where', 'knew', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'opposite', 'where', 'started.Gabrielle', 'Union', 'tough', 'savvy', 'interrogator', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'intimidate', 'drop', 'f-bomb', 'Well', 'cast', 'Well', 'acted', 'Well', 'written', 'Well', 'directed', 'what', 'indie', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'Michael', 'Matthias', 'not', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Also', 'Anjelah', 'Nicole', 'Johnson', 'former', 'Oakland', 'Raider', 'Cheerleader.Frequent', 'f-bombs', 'very', 'brief', 'nudity', 'uncredited', 'silicon', 'blonde', 'walking', 'pool']",N/A
