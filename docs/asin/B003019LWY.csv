1314740,A1RZ8PKX49BCEE,B003019LWY,Charlie Gee,"[2, 3]","I bought this DVD as a gift for my mother who is a big Celtic Thunder fan.  Even she was a bit disappointed with this production, particularly with the time sacrificed to the female singer whose appearance seems to be more of a distraction than an asset.  I also purchased the two previous releases as gifts, and I've watched each of them.  The second DVD release seems more an alternate version of the first rather than a unique production that can stand on its own.  This third release can certainly stand on its own and it does feature some good moments: such as the ""Doo Wacka Doo"", ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" and ""500 Miles"" songs.  The set is impressive, providing the men plenty of room to move around.  The solo performances are good as always, but it is when the five men perform ensemble that the real magic happens.  Their voices together will still impress you.  Missing from this production, though, is the connection with the audience so apparent in the earlier releases.  Here, the way the movie is edited one could get the impression that the singers and the audience were in two different venues.The special feature is good, although the time spent with the old gent in the castle does tend to drag a bit.  What becomes crystal clear from this special feature, however, is that Celtic Thunder also performed a series of songs on a completely different set...and these performances were not included on this DVD.  This might explain why the show appears to end rather abruptly.  Just when it seems they're really getting warmed up, it ends.  Maybe those songs are being saved for a fourth release?  The stage show is not 124 minutes long and does not include the songs ""Amazing Grace"" or ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" as listed in the description.Despite these criticisms, this DVD should still prove worthwhile for Celtic Thunder fans.  The men are talented singers and that in itself provides value.

Whoever produced and choreographed this DVD did a lousy job.  Paul singing Doowackadoo in his usual falsetto just didn't work for me.  He can't do pop tunes no matter how hard he tries and should stick to the romantic ballads he does well.  ""Bad Bad Leroy Brown"" was so badly choreographed with all of them walking around like they had no idea what they were doing and I have no idea who the extra men were.  Damian just kind of walked off the set during this after he'd done ""Standing on the Corner.""  I don't know if they were trying for gangster feeling or what with the black suits and white shirts, but I liked their casual looks much better.  The woman who sang a solo wasn't doing it for me either.  Neil is a good addition to the group and they need him with Paul and Damian leaving the group.  What I do wonder is why the Celtic Thunder Band keeps changing.  Each DVD has a different group of violinists and guitar players.  I think the flute player was in ""The Show"" quit for ""Act II"" and came back for ""Heritage and Entertainment""  I liked the female drummer in ""The Show"" but by Act 2 she was gone and the band seemed to get smaller.  All in all, in my opinion, don't waste your money.  Celtic Thunder tried to go too pop culture and I don't think it worked.

This show is a joy to watch, an upbeat experience rare in today's musical business, and indicates a huge amount of phenominal talent development and growth in production values.  We have loved the ""Fab Five"" from their beginning, and repeatedly watch their prior DVD performances.  This production greatly exceeded our expectations.  The men and boys (!) have reached a new level of professionalism, performance maturity, and vocal development.  The producers have been very wise in the selection of the Special Features materials, because through them we have been allowed to get to know this group as individuals, as human beings, and a bit about their growing up environs. This disc's Special Features REALLY extend that intimacy and familiarity to a new level, increasing our appreciation for each and the challenges they have faced .  The musical selection is very surprising, and certainly more like a deftly crafted compilation of former and contemporary musical hits than an Irish vocal group would be expected to perform.  I must note that the addition of all the male dancers, several female participants, and HUGE set seemed to come at the expense of the informality and closeness of just watching the group perform.  I would suggest that the extras, theatrics, and huge set be toned down to not take away from the performers themselves. A truly stellar performance from Mr. Coulter and the guys which will encourage continued performances of this gifted group.  Though  the speech of several are very hard to understand in person, they have mastered the American pronunciation of the lyrics with great accuracy. Still enjoy hearing the dialect in George's songs, though. BRAVO !

The DVD, ""It's Entertainment"" is brief, but the bonus feature, ""The Story So Far"" made up for that and saved the DVD from being disappointing.The sound in this DVD could have been more clear. It was hard to hear the men's voices above the music. And I do wish I could have heard more individual solos just to hear each one's unique accent. The stunner of it all, however, was this woman walking out,singing, or rather, shouting a western song, ""Just Like Jesse James,"" which left me BEWILDERED and wondering how and why that happened. She was a bad match for Keith, who looked tired in this show, and the young woman for Damian was also a bad match. I was afraid they wouldn't go away.Damian needs to sing more solos that clearly give us the sound of his mature voice. His younger voice was clearly soloed and heard to be outstanding in the first CD and DVD.As for Neil joining them, I think he looks out of place with his piercings and odd beard. I don't see him necessary to the group, unless one is leaving and he is being slowly introduced.I loved the first two CDs, ""Celtic Thunder The Show"" and ""Act Two"" plus that outstanding first DVD, ""The Show.""

I bought it anyhow, because I do not care if they sing ""Ireland"" every day in English, Celtic, and Latin. I love to watch them fellowship with each other, tolerate each other, and give us so much pleasure.Each guy has his own way of reaching the audience. Of course, this could be said of any group, but I find this group's entertainment very lasting. I tire of entertainers rather quickly when watching them perform. Sometimes this spoils the impression of the music. But, I am so pleased to have learned about these guys. Sorry to hear that Paul is leaving. Outstanding voice. Some classic training, for sure. He will be missed. Cute personality.We have practically watched Damian grow up. He has, and still does, appeal to all ages. The guy seems so real and sensible, yet always ready to have fun with the guys and with the audience. I really like him.Ryan is such an exciting singer. I sit and smile when he sings. He is great, and rather reminds me of some of the very good musicals of days gone by. When he is finished, I sometimes stop the music to enjoy his rich delivery.Keith is just precious, or he couldn't get by with some of the corny songs he does on this disc. -Yep, I did like them, Keith. My most favorite are your ballads. Methinks that you have a very serious side, gracefully off-setting your more rambuncious times. One should pay attention when you sing the more serious songs, because it is touching, and no one should miss that. You do know how to tell a story.I cannot wait to hear what George is going to sing. Such subtle charm, and he seems to be the main ingredient! Just my perception. He and Damian affect me much the same way, -that quiet politeness. Yet, one can tell that they have a lot of fun, and can be funny too.Most important: I percieve that these are all good guys. The harmony is kind to the ears. They should do more of that, or at least I think so. Sometimes the girls distract from the main player. I think they should be more subtle, maybe. Exception: The little girl that danced with Damian. No distraction there; Damian was allowed to remain the chief attraction in that clip.In summary, I say: Celtic Thunder should always be the main event, and no outsider should ever take away from their performances. (That's free, guys!)Over all, I have to give this five stars, because overall, I loved it.

Unlike the last DVD which suffered from sloppy camera work, my compliments go out to the video director. The shots are well composed, and they stay on screen long enough for you to see the whole screen. None of that frantic, two seconds per camera glimpse to make you dizzy.

1314780,A16UUVEPRTZ57J,B003019LWY,Sinead de Burca,"[3, 4]","What was Sharon Browne thinking? She took 5 talented men and watered down and misused their individual talents in order to make this cheesy, sell-out show. Not only is there nothing ""Celtic"" about it but there was little in the way of entertainment. The idea, which I've heard expressed, that there is something for everyone in this... from 4 yrs old to 104 yrs old, may be the problem. Trying to please everyone often pleases very few.I am not a Celtic Woman fan, so I was hesitant to even give Celtic Thunder a go. However, after seeing their first show on PBS I was won over! These guys are all talented and in that show their individual talents were put to good use. Unlike Celtic Woman... you can actually leave the room and still know which one of them is on stage performing at any given time! They took some great Celtic songs and, unlike Celtic Woman, actually sang them with feeling and power as they were meant to be sung. Their individual personalities came through, immediately endearing each performer to the audience. Also, the individuals functioned well as a group, blending their voices and appearing to have great fun performing together.However, ""It's Entertainment"" is full of songs that didn't need to be done, lacking in anything Celtic other than one or two songs they've already done, and full of distractions like the embarrassing dance numbers and stage extras, and worst of all... the woman singing ""Just Like Jesse James"" in the middle of the show! It was terrible casting, which made the principle performer in that particular piece, Keith Harkin, look like a fool. And do Celtic Thunder fans really want to listen to a whole musical number by a woman singing a Cher song? It's not what I paid for and it completely took away that important suspension of belief, which allows a person to become involved with what is happening on stage. Also, the addition of a new member, Neil, seems unnecessary. His voice is lovely and he does a beautiful job with one of the few highlights of the show, ""Hallelujah"" , but where in the past each of the 5 original members had their individual style and demographic, the addition of this man is superfluous. The vast majority of the songs throughout this show, with the exception of about 3, are not Celtic, are disjointed, with the guys rarely appearing to be performing as a group, and the musical numbers were, for the most part - cheesy and embarrassing.The original show was simpler and more on point. This show comes across like a blatant sell out and an attempt to cash in on the performers' earlier success at all costs. Unfortunately, if these men, all talented solo performers, allow themselves to be mismanaged like this... they will all go the way of David Cassidy, Bobby Sherman and Donny Osmond, spending the rest of their lives trying to convince people they actually ARE talented singers and musicians - and not just caricatures.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because I cannot fault the performers, they did the best they could with what they were handed. However, if they continue to allow themselves to be exploited in this manner it will be their own fault if there is no life after Celtic Thunder.",2,Bad Bad Bad,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,3184,"['What', 'was', 'Sharon', 'Browne', 'thinking', 'took', '5', 'talented', 'men', 'watered', 'down', 'misused', 'individual', 'talents', 'order', 'make', 'cheesy', 'sell-out', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'nothing', 'Celtic', 'was', 'little', 'way', 'entertainment', 'idea', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'expressed', 'something', 'everyone', '4', 'yrs', 'old', '104', 'yrs', 'old', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'Trying', 'please', 'everyone', 'often', 'very', 'few.I', 'am', 'not', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'fan', 'was', 'hesitant', 'even', 'give', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'go', 'However', 'seeing', 'first', 'show', 'PBS', 'was', 'won', 'over', 'guys', 'are', 'talented', 'show', 'individual', 'talents', 'were', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'can', 'actually', 'leave', 'room', 'still', 'know', 'one', 'stage', 'performing', 'given', 'time', 'took', 'great', 'Celtic', 'songs', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'actually', 'sang', 'feeling', 'power', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'sung', 'individual', 'personalities', 'came', 'immediately', 'endearing', 'performer', 'audience', 'Also', 'individuals', 'functioned', 'well', 'group', 'blending', 'voices', 'appearing', 'have', 'great', 'fun', 'performing', 'together.However', 'Entertainment', 'full', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'done', 'lacking', 'anything', 'Celtic', 'other', 'one', 'two', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'already', 'done', 'full', 'distractions', 'embarrassing', 'dance', 'numbers', 'stage', 'extras', 'worst', 'woman', 'singing', 'Just', 'Jesse', 'James', 'middle', 'show', 'was', 'terrible', 'casting', 'made', 'principle', 'performer', 'particular', 'piece', 'Keith', 'Harkin', 'look', 'fool', 'do', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'fans', 'really', 'want', 'listen', 'whole', 'musical', 'number', 'woman', 'singing', 'Cher', 'song', 'not', 'what', 'paid', 'completely', 'took', 'away', 'important', 'suspension', 'belief', 'person', 'become', 'involved', 'what', 'happening', 'stage', 'Also', 'addition', 'new', 'member', 'Neil', 'unnecessary', 'voice', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'job', 'one', 'few', 'highlights', 'show', 'Hallelujah', 'where', 'past', '5', 'original', 'members', 'had', 'individual', 'style', 'demographic', 'addition', 'man', 'superfluous', 'vast', 'majority', 'songs', 'show', 'exception', '3', 'are', 'not', 'Celtic', 'are', 'disjointed', 'guys', 'rarely', 'appearing', 'be', 'performing', 'group', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'cheesy', 'embarrassing.The', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'simpler', 'more', 'point', 'show', 'blatant', 'sell', 'attempt', 'cash', 'performers', 'earlier', 'success', 'costs', 'Unfortunately', 'men', 'talented', 'solo', 'performers', 'allow', 'be', 'mismanaged', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'Bobby', 'Sherman', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'spending', 'rest', 'lives', 'trying', 'convince', 'people', 'actually', 'ARE', 'talented', 'singers', 'musicians', 'not', 'just', 'caricatures.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'performers', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'were', 'handed', 'However', 'continue', 'allow', 'be', 'exploited', 'manner', 'will', 'be', 'own', 'fault', 'life', 'Celtic', 'Thunder']",N/A
