I take ""The Anna Nicole Show"" as a religious experience, and this DVD is the church of it.  People go on and on about this show, without realizing that ""reality"" has nothing to do with it.  A lot of the gags are set up (as Anna Nicole states on the commentary)--  it's Hollywood baby...ain't nothing real.  It's hard to review the show, if you didn't like it on TV you won't like it here.  Although, the bleep and blurs are eliminated, which makes for a very fabulous Christmas party...

We first see Anna house hunting with Kimmie, Howard &amp; Sugar Pie! It really is a hoot watching her make herself at home in each place they visit. Later we get a visit from hillbilly trash-queen, Cousin Shelly! You'll roll in the floor laughing talking about giving birth to her kid and the doctor not being able to keep his fingers to himself. After punching the OB, Shelly tells the nurse, &quot;what's he gonna sue me for? A food stamp?&quot; Too funny. Not to mention her lines like, &quot;I want to see her! Tell her I LOVE her!&quot; The Halloween Party is fun too. It also just happens to be Kimmie's birthday so Anna buys her a used VW Beetle (wish I had friends like this!) and they celebrate by puking into Howard's Dracula hat. Cousin Shelly later returns for the big Christmas Party with other such greats as Rip Taylor, WWF's Chynna and Margaret Cho attending! Everyone gets drunk and Shelly gets into a fist fight after exclaiming, &quot;well how do I get upstairs?!?&quot; You do not want to miss this.

775264,A1NVO2OVXE09F4,B0000CBXZ7,Caryss Wood-Behan,"[2, 2]","I loved watching this video and was sad to find that I'd finally come to the end of it.  Which is why I then went and downloaded The Anna Nicole Show Season II from [...].  I waited a couple of months to watch it in its entirety, but by then I could no longer watch Anna, Howard and Daniel, since two of the three had passed on by that time.  Sad doesn't describe the feeling, especially after getting to know all of them in such an intimate way  (and this is not too much of an exaggeration).The video is just hilariously, ridiculously funny.  I laughed so hard I really did have tears rolling from my eyes.One of the funniest episodes was Anna going house hunting with Howard and the Realtor.  This is the episode where she opens the fridge in one of the houses she's touring and helps herself to whatever's in there.AND this is the one where she squeezes into the tub in that same house.There's another episode in the Season I set in which Anna, Howard and one of their entourage are at a kinky sex toy shop.  Nothing there is lewd or controversial (e.g., no chains or bondage type ""toys""), just silly, funny odds and ends.  Anna is wildly funny in this particular segment, esp. when she is looking at the various male organs.  You just have to be there and, I promise, if you buy this video you will feel as though you are there with Anna, Howard, Daniel, Kimmy, Frank, and Le Famous Bobby Trendy.  Oh, and how could I forget the one and only Sugar Pie?It gets a little bawdy in certain parts; for instance, the Christmas Party pushes past the line of propriety more than a little bit, but, on balance this compilation of episodes from Season I is worth it as long as you believe that some of it is just Anna being a great actress ---- and that she is.

775276,A3AARE6U3SCZFO,B0000CBXZ7,"Onie Wheeler ""Harkleroade""","[18, 20]","First of all, I am sick and tired of all the slurs regarding Anna's weight gain.  The fact is, she was lovely even when obese and her unique, ditzy style came through in the series.I don't doubt she was on some type of drug and/or alcohol, but I do NOT think Howard K. Stern showed anything but love and protection towards Anna.Unless I am sadly mistaken, I feel that Howard K. Stern is not guilty of anything more than loving Anna to the point he catered to her every wish.I loved the series, but wish the other seasons would be released on DVD.I first became a fan of Anna's when she was a Playboy and Guess model.  She was breathtaking and simply gorgeous.Then I lost track of her until this series began.  At the time, I could not access E! and therefore unfortunately could not watch the series.O.K. -- Anna is vulgar, foul mouthed, probably doped up, and uses bad grammar.  Nobody is perfect, yet Anna let the public see her imperfect side of her in this series. In some episodes she wears little or no makeup and yes, her clothing is unbecoming.After Anna's tragic demise, I bought the Australian edition of ""The Anna Nicole Show"" and found it to be over the top, gaudy, and just plain amusing.The Australian version contains a bonus of Anna after her amazing weight loss, making her first public appearance as a Heatherette model.  If you can and you are a true Anna fan, you will want to purchase the Australian edition.  I bought mine here from Amazon Direct and was fortunate to obtain the Australian edition.Yes, it is heart breaking to watch Anna and Daniel, knowing that both are now gone, but Anna and Daniel will live on, partially due to this DVD set.My favorite episode is ""The Date"" -- it is hilarious to watch the geeky millionare paired with the ditzy blonde.  They have absolutely nothing in common and it is clear that Anna is not taken with Claude.  But poor Claude tries hard -- too hard -- to make an impression on Anna.I also love the over the top, campy Bobby Trendy's appearances.  He even had a special theme that was used when he was a guest on the show. The parody that Howard K. Stern did of Bobby was hilarious.  The wise cracks between Howard and Bobby were funny as well.  Howard made fun of Bobby's pock marked face and Bobby made fun of Howard's nose.I love Kim, her assistant, as well.  It is hilarious when she has a birthday party and gets a new car from Anna.  Although it is difficult to watch her puke all the way home from the Halloween party which must be close to Kimmie's birthday, this edition is still campy and fun.I wonder what became of the darling Sugar Pie.  It was clear that Anna and Sugar Pie loved each other dearly.The critics and some of the reviewers here panned the show, but I am so happy that E! released at least the First Season of the Anna Nicole Show because I, for one, have never placed much stock in the critics' reviews.  I have found that most of the time, the worse the critics' ratings, the more I like the productions.And for those of you who disparage her temporary weight gain, look at YOURSELVES.  I am sick of all the comments made about her being Shamu and Bovine.I think the negative comments made about her weight probably affected her self esteem, therefore exacerbating her drug abuse.In closing, you do have to be a diehard Anna Nicole fan to appreciate this series.  If you hate Anna Nicole or people with weight problems, then steer clear of this series because you will find it too much to take.But if you love Anna Nicole, sit back and enjoy the show!AND PLEASE, E!, RELEASE THE REST OF ANNA'S SHOWS!",5,GREAT SERIES FOR DIEHARD ANNA FANS,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,3591,"['First', 'am', 'sick', 'tired', 'slurs', 'regarding', 'Anna', 'weight', 'gain', 'fact', 'was', 'lovely', 'even', 'when', 'obese', 'unique', 'ditzy', 'style', 'came', 'series.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'was', 'type', 'drug', 'and/or', 'alcohol', 'do', 'NOT', 'think', 'Howard', 'K.', 'Stern', 'showed', 'anything', 'love', 'protection', 'towards', 'Anna.Unless', 'am', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'feel', 'Howard', 'K.', 'Stern', 'not', 'guilty', 'anything', 'more', 'loving', 'Anna', 'point', 'catered', 'wish.I', 'loved', 'series', 'wish', 'other', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'DVD.I', 'first', 'became', 'fan', 'Anna', 'when', 'was', 'Playboy', 'Guess', 'model', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'simply', 'gorgeous.Then', 'lost', 'track', 'series', 'began', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'access', 'E', 'therefore', 'unfortunately', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'series.O.K', 'Anna', 'vulgar', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'probably', 'doped', 'up', 'bad', 'grammar', 'Nobody', 'perfect', 'yet', 'Anna', 'let', 'public', 'see', 'imperfect', 'side', 'series', 'episodes', 'little', 'makeup', 'yes', 'clothing', 'unbecoming.After', 'Anna', 'tragic', 'demise', 'bought', 'Australian', 'edition', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Show', 'found', 'be', 'top', 'gaudy', 'just', 'plain', 'amusing.The', 'Australian', 'version', 'bonus', 'Anna', 'amazing', 'weight', 'loss', 'making', 'first', 'public', 'appearance', 'Heatherette', 'model', 'can', 'are', 'true', 'Anna', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'purchase', 'Australian', 'edition', 'bought', 'mine', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Direct', 'was', 'fortunate', 'obtain', 'Australian', 'edition.Yes', 'heart', 'breaking', 'watch', 'Anna', 'Daniel', 'knowing', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'Anna', 'Daniel', 'will', 'live', 'partially', 'due', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Date', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'geeky', 'millionare', 'paired', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'common', 'clear', 'Anna', 'not', 'taken', 'Claude', 'poor', 'Claude', 'hard', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'impression', 'Anna.I', 'also', 'love', 'top', 'campy', 'Bobby', 'Trendy', 'appearances', 'even', 'had', 'special', 'theme', 'was', 'used', 'when', 'was', 'guest', 'show', 'parody', 'Howard', 'K.', 'Stern', 'did', 'Bobby', 'was', 'hilarious', 'wise', 'cracks', 'Howard', 'Bobby', 'were', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Howard', 'made', 'fun', 'Bobby', 'pock', 'marked', 'face', 'Bobby', 'made', 'fun', 'Howard', 'nose.I', 'love', 'Kim', 'assistant', 'as', 'well', 'hilarious', 'when', 'birthday', 'party', 'new', 'car', 'Anna', 'difficult', 'watch', 'puke', 'way', 'home', 'Halloween', 'party', 'must', 'be', 'close', 'Kimmie', 'birthday', 'edition', 'still', 'campy', 'fun.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'became', 'darling', 'Sugar', 'Pie', 'was', 'clear', 'Anna', 'Sugar', 'Pie', 'loved', 'other', 'dearly.The', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'here', 'panned', 'show', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'E', 'released', 'least', 'First', 'Season', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Show', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'placed', 'much', 'stock', 'critics', 'reviews', 'have', 'found', 'most', 'time', 'worse', 'critics', 'ratings', 'more', 'productions.And', 'who', 'disparage', 'temporary', 'weight', 'gain', 'look', 'YOURSELVES', 'am', 'sick', 'comments', 'made', 'being', 'Shamu', 'Bovine.I', 'think', 'negative', 'comments', 'made', 'weight', 'probably', 'affected', 'self', 'esteem', 'therefore', 'exacerbating', 'drug', 'closing', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'diehard', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'fan', 'appreciate', 'series', 'hate', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'people', 'weight', 'problems', 'then', 'steer', 'clear', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'much', 'take.But', 'love', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'show', 'PLEASE', 'E', 'RELEASE', 'THE', 'REST', 'OF', 'ANNA', 'SHOWS']",The Anna Nicole Show - The First Season

775279,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,B0000CBXZ7,TFR,"[4, 10]","To be fair, this compilation of TV shows about the late Anna Nicole Smith is at least as interesting as ""The Osbornes"", but you'd have to be a fan in order to sit through all of this.  I guess if you saw all of the original broadcasts, then this will probably be a treasure trove of ANS that you can watch over and over again.It's the way that Anna Nicole presents herself as a parody of herself that sets this dvd set apart from all the other video media she was ever involved with.  Some of her antics undoubtedly appeared off-kilter and laughable at the time these episodes were first broadcast. However, knowing that the subject of this series met a very tragic death, the picture is now not very humorous.Comic Dennis Miller said that we enjoy observing celebrity train wrecks because we all have the same feelings and inclinations --- towards debauchery in general. Most of us don't act on our wildest feelings, because we're too afraid of the consequences.However, when we observe someone who does act on these feelings, and then has to pay the resulting price, we can tell ourselves that we were correct in our assumptions. That's why the fascination.What I'd like to know is: Why didn't ANS commission someone to design a proper fitting bra for her? She had more than enough money. Like Elaine Bennis once said about the braless Seinfeld character ""Sue Ellen Mieske"", she was ""out of control... all over the place.""I guess it was her trademark, but why would anyone want to look like someone lugging a pair of water balloons around?  It didn't seem to bother her that she looked like the female equivalent of Rodney Dangerfield in a double knit leisure suit.My suggestion for anyone who wants to remember ANS at her best:  Get a copy of ""The Naked Gun: 33 1/3"", and you can see that she did have other talents that she could have easily utilized. However, that was not the case. Instead, she paid too much attention to the idiot males who were paying too much attention to her.  Oh well.  C'est La Vie.Possibly, this set might offer someone, somewhere, some clue as to what was really going on.  I would rate this dvd set as five stars because all loyal Americans should know about the cultural phenom, Anna Nicole.",5,All loyal Americans take heed!!,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,2224,"['be', 'fair', 'compilation', 'TV', 'shows', 'late', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith', 'least', 'as', 'interesting', 'Osbornes', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'order', 'sit', 'guess', 'saw', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'treasure', 'trove', 'ANS', 'can', 'watch', 'again.It', 'way', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'parody', 'herself', 'dvd', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'video', 'media', 'was', 'ever', 'involved', 'antics', 'undoubtedly', 'appeared', 'off-kilter', 'laughable', 'time', 'episodes', 'were', 'first', 'broadcast', 'However', 'knowing', 'subject', 'series', 'met', 'very', 'tragic', 'death', 'picture', 'now', 'not', 'very', 'humorous.Comic', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'said', 'enjoy', 'observing', 'celebrity', 'train', 'wrecks', 'have', 'same', 'feelings', 'inclinations', 'towards', 'debauchery', 'general', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'wildest', 'feelings', ""'re"", 'too', 'afraid', 'consequences.However', 'when', 'observe', 'someone', 'who', 'act', 'feelings', 'then', 'pay', 'resulting', 'price', 'can', 'tell', 'ourselves', 'were', 'correct', 'assumptions', 'why', 'fascination.What', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'ANS', 'commission', 'someone', 'design', 'proper', 'fitting', 'bra', 'had', 'more', 'enough', 'money', 'Elaine', 'Bennis', 'once', 'said', 'braless', 'Seinfeld', 'character', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Mieske', 'was', 'control', 'place', 'guess', 'was', 'trademark', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'look', 'someone', 'lugging', 'pair', 'water', 'balloons', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'looked', 'female', 'equivalent', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'double', 'knit', 'leisure', 'suit.My', 'suggestion', 'anyone', 'who', 'remember', 'ANS', 'best', 'Get', 'copy', 'Naked', 'Gun', '33', '1/3', 'can', 'see', 'did', 'have', 'other', 'talents', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'utilized', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Instead', 'paid', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'idiot', 'males', 'who', 'were', 'paying', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'Oh', 'well', ""C'est"", 'La', 'Vie.Possibly', 'set', 'might', 'offer', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'would', 'rate', 'dvd', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'loyal', 'Americans', 'should', 'know', 'cultural', 'phenom', 'Anna', 'Nicole']",The Anna Nicole Show - The First Season
