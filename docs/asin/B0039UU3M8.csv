This was some of her best work and shows why we loved her so much.The Amaazon ""manufactured on demand"" DVD is another story. I have 4 different commercial DVD players (and 2 player/recorders), none of them could play this disk at all. Additionally, DVD drives on 2 older computers could not either. 2 of the high-end DVD players that could NOT play it are only 6-12 months old!Only a 1 year old Dell laptop with a DVD player/recorder and a 4 month old Desktop (with a blue-ray DVD player and a DVD player/recorder) could play it.",2,"Loved Movie - Hate Amazon ""manufactured on demand""",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,593,"['Gilda', 'Radner', 'best', 'am', 'so', 'sad', 'longer', 'was', 'best', 'work', 'why', 'loved', 'so', 'much.The', 'Amaazon', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'DVD', 'story', 'have', '4', 'different', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'players', '2', 'player/recorders', 'none', 'could', 'play', 'disk', 'Additionally', 'DVD', '2', 'older', 'computers', 'could', 'not', 'either', '2', 'high-end', 'DVD', 'players', 'could', 'NOT', 'play', 'are', 'only', '6-12', 'months', 'old', 'Only', '1', 'year', 'old', 'Dell', 'laptop', 'DVD', 'player/recorder', '4', 'month', 'old', 'Desktop', 'blue-ray', 'DVD', 'player', 'DVD', 'player/recorder', 'could', 'play']",Gilda Live
