1671505,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00FF9SKQW,C. B Collins Jr.,"[24, 25]","This is an adult film that slowly opens and reveals step by step the layers of life's complexity. So you know already it is not for everyone. It is thoughtful and careful and constructed like a game of chess. I enjoyed it greatly and thought about it often after seeing the film; however for those who want action, they may find this film a bit slow. A young woman attempts suicide and is saved by a teacher of Latin and the classics in a Swiss private college-prep school. He obtains her rain coat by accident and in a pocket is a book by a Portuguese poet and physician, Amadeu de Prado, and the mystery of who is the young woman and why did she try to kill herself expands greatly to begin to explore the life of this young idealistic intellectual physician/poet who resists the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal.Jeremy Irons plays the Classics/Latin teacher Raimund Gregorius who virtually abandons his teaching position to go to Portugal to solve the mystery of the young suicidal woman but also to uncover the life of Prado. The film does a wonderful job of contrasting the passion, danger, intrigue, competition, romance of the life of Prado who died 30 years before the film starts with that of Gregorius, a 57 year old man who has selected to live a life of scholarship rather than passion. Through this exploration of the life of Prado, the life of Gregorius begins to change and grow. In fact, as Gregorius encounters the sister, fellow revolutionists, best friend, and lover of Prado, he not only begins to solve the multiple mysteries of this film but he also begins to lose his own identity and begin to construct a new identity.The life of Prado is fascinating and highly dramatic, but it is revealed in passages and memories however the events of his life are revealed chronologically so the film is never confusing, just mysterious which is an achievement.",5,"Thoughtful, careful film that unfolds gradually",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1872,"['adult', 'film', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'step', 'step', 'layers', 'life', 'complexity', 'know', 'already', 'not', 'everyone', 'thoughtful', 'careful', 'constructed', 'game', 'chess', 'enjoyed', 'greatly', 'thought', 'often', 'seeing', 'film', 'however', 'who', 'want', 'action', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'young', 'woman', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'saved', 'teacher', 'Latin', 'classics', 'Swiss', 'private', 'college-prep', 'school', 'rain', 'coat', 'accident', 'pocket', 'book', 'Portuguese', 'poet', 'physician', 'Amadeu', 'de', 'Prado', 'mystery', 'who', 'young', 'woman', 'why', 'did', 'try', 'kill', 'greatly', 'begin', 'explore', 'life', 'young', 'idealistic', 'intellectual', 'physician/poet', 'who', 'Salazar', 'dictatorship', 'Portugal.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Classics/Latin', 'teacher', 'Raimund', 'Gregorius', 'who', 'virtually', 'teaching', 'position', 'go', 'Portugal', 'solve', 'mystery', 'young', 'suicidal', 'woman', 'also', 'uncover', 'life', 'Prado', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'contrasting', 'passion', 'danger', 'intrigue', 'competition', 'romance', 'life', 'Prado', 'who', 'died', '30', 'years', 'film', 'Gregorius', '57', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'selected', 'live', 'life', 'scholarship', 'rather', 'passion', 'exploration', 'life', 'Prado', 'life', 'Gregorius', 'change', 'grow', 'fact', 'Gregorius', 'sister', 'fellow', 'revolutionists', 'best', 'friend', 'lover', 'Prado', 'not', 'only', 'solve', 'multiple', 'mysteries', 'film', 'also', 'lose', 'own', 'identity', 'begin', 'construct', 'new', 'identity.The', 'life', 'Prado', 'fascinating', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'revealed', 'passages', 'memories', 'however', 'events', 'life', 'are', 'revealed', 'chronologically', 'so', 'film', 'never', 'confusing', 'just', 'mysterious', 'achievement']",Night Train To Lisbon Digital

1671509,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00FF9SKQW,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.This film tells a story, make that two stories, set 4 decades apart.  They are connected of course.  The film is directed by Dane, Bille August, probably best known for ""Pelle the Conqueror"" and ""Les Miserables"" (not the musical).  He tells the tale of Raimund Gregorius (Jeremy Irons), a Swiss literary professor.  On the way to class one morning he rescues a girl about to jump off a bridge.  Before he can inquire about her intent, she departs and leaves behind her raincoat.  In the pocket Raimund discovers a small book written by a Portuguese man named Amadeu (Jack Huston).  As he reads the book he finds the man has a wonderful use of language as he tells of his involvement during the political upheaval surrounding the government's dictatorial rule in the early 1970's.  Raimund decides to catch the next train out of Berne and head to Lisbon, hoping to catch the girl who left the book and/or meet people who knew the now deceased Amadeu.He first encounters Amadeu's sister, Adriana (Charlotte Rampling) who acts as if Amadeu is still alive.  Through a freak accident, Raimund's glasses are broken.  He seeks out an optometrist (Martina Gedeck) whose uncle Joao (Tom Courtenay) just happens to have been friends with Amadeu in those early years.  Mariana (Gedeck) offers to help Raimund and he accepts.  The film essentially tells the story, in flashbacks, that Raimund is seeking.  We're not sure of Raimund's reasons, other than academic interests.  Each character in the film that Raimund interviews has a different actor playing their younger selves.  In addition to the actors named above, the cast includes additional European stars in the key roles (Melanie Laurent, August Diehl, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, Christopher Lee, and others).I was hoping for a bit more intrigue and mystery as the events unfold, but the film is more of a historical telling of the citizen rebellion as seen through the eyes of a few protestors.  Watching requires patience.  Ultimately Raimund's detective work pays off.  So now he must decide whether he must return to Berne and his classes.  It would seem he makes the right decision.

1671510,A10E8BG7ZCGSPF,B00FF9SKQW,Theodoros Natsinas,"[15, 15]","A warning: I have NOT read the book, so this is a straight movie review; no comparisons, no complaints, no issues of fidelity to the original, etc, etc. Also, it is written before the DVD release, based on viewing the film in a cinema.This is NOT a film for everyone. Its pace is slow (something that, personally, I like) and its  plot is `human' (rather than the more or less unrealistic type that seems to be the current trend). It is for someone interested in personal issues, old-fashioned perhaps, moral dilemmas and romantic views of life. If it sounds OK to you, try the film; if not, stay away.If you are still interested, there is yet another aspect to consider. To enjoy the film you have to accept certain improbabilities in the plot. I try not to reveal too much about the plot but I don't think this is a spoiler: how likely is it that a boring older professor would actually climb on a night train and escape to Lisbon on the spur of the moment? Well, if you are OK with this second set of hurdles you are going to enjoy the film!What made the film attractive to me was its pace, the simple without `fireworks' direction, and its reliance on the actors to move the story along rather than on the editing. Also, that it is not too serious, there is comedy in it, there is a mystery to be solved. However, what really won me over was the fact that it actually had people talking, discussing things. Discussions that were not just about who did what; but they were about why did people behave one way or another; why did they do the things they did. The point, of course, being why the main character is doing what he is doing: a night train ride into the professor's mind.",4,Slightly old-fashioned but very satisfying,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1684,"['warning', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'book', 'straight', 'movie', 'review', 'comparisons', 'complaints', 'issues', 'fidelity', 'original', 'etc', 'etc', 'Also', 'written', 'DVD', 'release', 'based', 'viewing', 'film', 'cinema.This', 'NOT', 'film', 'everyone', 'pace', 'slow', 'something', 'personally', 'like', 'plot', 'human', 'rather', 'more', 'less', 'unrealistic', 'type', 'be', 'current', 'trend', 'someone', 'interested', 'personal', 'issues', 'old-fashioned', 'perhaps', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'romantic', 'views', 'life', 'OK', 'try', 'film', 'not', 'stay', 'are', 'still', 'interested', 'yet', 'aspect', 'consider', 'enjoy', 'film', 'have', 'accept', 'certain', 'improbabilities', 'plot', 'try', 'not', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spoiler', 'how', 'likely', 'boring', 'older', 'professor', 'would', 'actually', 'climb', 'night', 'train', 'escape', 'Lisbon', 'spur', 'moment', 'Well', 'are', 'OK', 'second', 'set', 'hurdles', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'film', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'attractive', 'was', 'pace', 'simple', 'fireworks', 'direction', 'reliance', 'actors', 'move', 'story', 'rather', 'editing', 'Also', 'not', 'too', 'serious', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'However', 'what', 'really', 'won', 'over', 'was', 'fact', 'actually', 'had', 'people', 'talking', 'discussing', 'things', 'Discussions', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'why', 'did', 'people', 'behave', 'one', 'way', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'things', 'did', 'point', 'course', 'being', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'night', 'train', 'ride', 'professor', 'mind']",Night Train To Lisbon Digital
