Oh, I love this film and so does everyone to whom I've lent it.Joan Crawford represents the spoiled darling that was France, now ready to join the Resistance and fight for freedom. (Don't worry, those oblivious Nazis actually FETCH HER ENTIRE COUTURE WARDROBE to the modest digs she occupies when they have taken over the lion's share of her house.)The two who take away the film, though, are Henry Daniell and John Carradine, both playing Nazi officers. The former, who has been wounded by the bite of an enemy dog, is in charge of Joan's house when it is commandeered. He is captivated by Joan, who lets him back her up against the wall and KISS HER ON THE LIPS so that John Wayne can make his getaway. John Carradine is the head of the Gestapo in Paris, and he is so sinister, sombre and sexless that you may find yourself fretting that Joan might have a little trouble with him. Don't. She will triumph at the end.My favourite scene is in a nightclub. There is an African-American jazz band playing and the singer is belting out ""I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascals, you!

But neither film deserves its bad reputation.  Indeed in hindsight I find them fully as interesting as any other of Crawford's MGM vehicles, and by no means do they seem cheap or ill-thought-out.Well, it's kind of silly having Crawford playing the richest girl in France, in a movie when everyone else is playing up the French accent so much so that at times you can't understand what they're saying, and meanwhile she, Joan, doesn't even try.  Why should she?  She's Joan Crawford.  The only time she tries to go French is when she carefully pronounces the name of her fiance: ""Row-bear.""  Outside of that, she uses her regular, broad American accent with its weird dips and slurs, the voice we know from a hundred movies.  When the picture begins she's sitting, bored silly, on the dias during some kind of fundraiser honoring those who made the Maginot Line possible in May 1940--the night it broke.  She rushes home to dismiss the modistes who have been waiting for her for two and a half hours, for she is off to Biarritz for a holiday.  Well, by the time she crawls back, having been bombed and brutalized, Paris has fallen to the Nazis and it's a new day of deprivation for the glamorous Michelle de la Beck, and ""Row-bear"" her boyfriend (Philip Dorn) is looking strangely like a collaborator.Michelle's million franc mansion has been commandeered by Vichy forces, and she is told to sleep in this crummy little concierge studio, a room with a door on the street that doesn't lock.  It's filthy, grim, and dangerous, for any Nazi could come in at any time.  She takes a job at the couturiere she used to patronize--sort of a left-wing Coco Chanel, very chic but no threat to Joan in the looks department.  German women are buying up all the gowns in the shop, big heavy Walkure style creatures who look like pigs suckling at a trough.  Then John Wayne (as ""Pat"") escapes from a POW camp and stumbles, sick, nearly hallucinating, into Joan's arms and she has to shield him the Gestapo.  John Wayne looks hot in this movie!  He could put his boots under my divan any old time.  She moves him right into her apartment with only a cursory thought to propriety, it's sort of refreshing.  People in World War II, even Hollywood people, must have thought that they had entered into a new world which would be totally given over to the fight against Fascism, and that all other considerations were secondary to this mission.  Jules Dassin, the director, embodies this pulpy material with real conviction and some wise-ass camera setups--real wit, real grit, and two fantastic, out of this world stars.",5,From Spoiled Mistress To Heroine of the Resistance,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2830,"['conventional', 'wisdom', 'movie', 'followup', 'ABOVE', 'SUSPICION', 'Crawford', 'Europe', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'were', 'deliberately', 'bad', 'features', 'planned', 'moguls', 'force', 'Crawford', 'pictures', 'film', 'bad', 'reputation', 'Indeed', 'hindsight', 'find', 'fully', 'as', 'interesting', 'other', 'Crawford', 'MGM', 'vehicles', 'means', 'do', 'seem', 'cheap', 'ill-thought-out.Well', 'kind', 'silly', 'having', 'Crawford', 'playing', 'richest', 'girl', 'France', 'movie', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'playing', 'up', 'French', 'accent', 'so', 'much', 'that', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'meanwhile', 'Joan', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Why', 'should', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'only', 'time', 'go', 'French', 'when', 'carefully', 'name', 'fiance', 'Row-bear', 'regular', 'broad', 'American', 'accent', 'weird', 'dips', 'slurs', 'voice', 'know', 'hundred', 'movies', 'When', 'picture', 'sitting', 'bored', 'silly', 'dias', 'kind', 'fundraiser', 'honoring', 'who', 'made', 'Maginot', 'Line', 'possible', 'May', '1940', 'night', 'broke', 'home', 'dismiss', 'modistes', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'Biarritz', 'holiday', 'Well', 'time', 'back', 'having', 'been', 'bombed', 'brutalized', 'Paris', 'fallen', 'Nazis', 'new', 'day', 'deprivation', 'glamorous', 'Michelle', 'de', 'la', 'Beck', 'Row-bear', 'boyfriend', 'Philip', 'Dorn', 'looking', 'strangely', 'collaborator.Michelle', 'million', 'franc', 'mansion', 'been', 'commandeered', 'Vichy', 'forces', 'told', 'sleep', 'crummy', 'little', 'concierge', 'studio', 'room', 'door', 'street', ""n't"", 'lock', 'filthy', 'grim', 'dangerous', 'Nazi', 'could', 'come', 'time', 'job', 'couturiere', 'used', 'patronize', 'sort', 'left-wing', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'very', 'chic', 'threat', 'Joan', 'looks', 'department', 'German', 'women', 'are', 'buying', 'up', 'gowns', 'shop', 'big', 'heavy', 'Walkure', 'style', 'creatures', 'who', 'look', 'pigs', 'suckling', 'trough', 'Then', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Pat', 'POW', 'camp', 'stumbles', 'sick', 'nearly', 'hallucinating', 'Joan', 'arms', 'shield', 'Gestapo', 'John', 'Wayne', 'hot', 'movie', 'could', 'put', 'boots', 'divan', 'old', 'time', 'right', 'apartment', 'only', 'cursory', 'thought', 'propriety', 'sort', 'refreshing', 'People', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'had', 'entered', 'new', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'given', 'fight', 'Fascism', 'other', 'considerations', 'were', 'secondary', 'mission', 'Jules', 'Dassin', 'director', 'pulpy', 'material', 'real', 'conviction', 'wise-ass', 'camera', 'setups', 'real', 'wit', 'real', 'grit', 'two', 'fantastic', 'world']",N/A

Rich French woman (Joan Crawford) is madly in love with and engaged to rich French industrialist (Philip Dorn). She is a self indulgent society woman, until the war ravages the France she knew. Now, with France under Nazi occupation, her magnificent mansion in Paris in the hands of the German comquerors, her fiancee seemingly in the thrall of the Nazis, she sees the light and undergoes a change. A fervent patriot, she rejects the Nazis and, in doing so, rejects her fiancee.An injured American RAF pilot (John Wayne) accosts her on the streets of Paris one night and induces a surprised Joan Crawford to help him escape those whom he believes are following him. She does so, but it soon becomes paramount that he leave France. She turns for help to her by now estranged fiancee, whom she has spurned, because she perceived him as having collaborated with the enemy. To her surprise, he agrees to help her.The pilot's departure does not go according to plan, however, and Joan discovers that things are not always what they seem. Though the viewer will probably realize what is going on before Joan does, this does not take away from the enjoyment of what is clearly a war propaganda film.Philip Dorn is wonderful in the part of the rich French industrialist and Joan's fiancee. Joan is, as always, beautifully garbed in exquisite outfits and give an excellent performance. John Wayne is overshadowed by his co-stars and seems somewhat awkward in the part of the American RAF pilot. While the screenplay is somewhat unbelievable, it is an entertaining film, nonetheless.

I simply do not understand the poor mistreatment of Miss Crawford. Is Christina in charge of the releases?? THAT might explain TROG being released before MUCH better fare. Also, I am tired of all the teasing on Amazon about Johnny Guitar. They must have 4 different DVDs pictured and yet NONE are available.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","his is obviously a WW II propaganda film, but it has outstanding production values, thanks to Henry Mankiewicz; excellent work behind the camera by Jules Dassin, some fine acting by some of the best box office draws of the time; and a pretty good story. Joan Crawford, at her most beautiful, is the obvious star and the Dutch actor, Phillip Dorn, the male lead. John Wayne has a featured support role as an American, flying for the British, who's been shot down over France and has escaped from a POW camp. The Duke makes the most of his screen time though and even gets in a few romantic chops w/Crawford. Also look for John Carradine as the head of the Paris Gestapo and Ava Gardner in an uncredited role as one of the shopgirls. Crawford and Dorn play Paris lovers who are engaged to be married, but after Germany defeats France, Dorn appears to have turned traitor. Lot's of twists and turns in this story to keep you interested and the climax will likely surprise you. Propaganda; but not the heavy-handed variety, this is also excellent cinema.

285994,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6301977076,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 2]","By the time Joan Crawford filmed ""Reunion In France"" in the early 1940's her heyday as Hollywood's most popular and highest-paid actress was slowly coming to an end. Joan found it harder and harder to find good scripts and it seemed that MGM, her home for 18 years, was trying to ease her out the door. Crawford stated by this time in Hollywood history the studios were more concerned with getting the careers of younger actresses off the ground, so ""older"" women, like Crawford, were shut out from getting quality material to act in. ""Reunion In France"" is by no means a good film; buy it simply because you love Crawford. The script is week and there is absolutely no chemistry between Joan and her co-star John Wayne. The plot deals with a woman living in Paris who finds her home invaded by the Nazis when they overtake France. She meets John Wayne, falls in love, and that's the end of the movie. It is no surprise that Crawford did one more film for MGM after this called ""Above Suspicion"", another medicore film, then she bought herself out of her contract and went to Warners. Joan Crawford stated; """"Reunion In France""...Oh God...if there is an afterlife and I am punished for my sins they will make me watch this over and over. Take John Wayne out of the saddle and you've got trouble. Wayne and I both went down for the count in this one, not just because of the silly script, but because we were so mismatched"".If your looking for some neat melodramatic films of Joan's from this era purchase ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Possessed"" and ""Sudden Fear""; they make ""Reunion In France"" look like a Sunday afternoon play.",3,"""A Fair Crawford Film""",1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,1618,"['time', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'filmed', 'Reunion', 'France', 'early', '1940', 'heyday', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'popular', 'highest-paid', 'actress', 'was', 'slowly', 'coming', 'end', 'Joan', 'found', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'good', 'scripts', 'seemed', 'MGM', 'home', '18', 'years', 'was', 'trying', 'ease', 'out', 'door', 'Crawford', 'stated', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'studios', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'getting', 'careers', 'younger', 'actresses', 'ground', 'older', 'women', 'Crawford', 'were', 'shut', 'out', 'getting', 'quality', 'material', 'act', 'Reunion', 'France', 'means', 'good', 'film', 'buy', 'simply', 'love', 'Crawford', 'script', 'week', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Joan', 'co-star', 'John', 'Wayne', 'plot', 'deals', 'woman', 'living', 'Paris', 'who', 'home', 'invaded', 'Nazis', 'when', 'overtake', 'France', 'John', 'Wayne', 'love', 'end', 'movie', 'surprise', 'Crawford', 'did', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'MGM', 'called', 'Suspicion', 'medicore', 'film', 'then', 'bought', 'contract', 'went', 'Warners', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'stated', 'Reunion', 'France', 'Oh', 'God', 'afterlife', 'am', 'punished', 'sins', 'will', 'make', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'Take', 'John', 'Wayne', 'saddle', ""'ve"", 'got', 'trouble', 'Wayne', 'went', 'down', 'count', 'one', 'not', 'just', 'silly', 'script', 'were', 'so', 'mismatched', '.If', 'looking', 'neat', 'melodramatic', 'films', 'Joan', 'era', 'purchase', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'Possessed', 'Sudden', 'Fear', 'make', 'Reunion', 'France', 'look', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'play']",N/A
