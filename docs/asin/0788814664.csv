But after seeing it I walked away thinking was that it. There is nothing more.  The film is very slow and drawn out, trying to make the small plot seem bigger. The script is so poor. The dialoge sounds written, it feels worked out. It rarely sounds natural. Which is a huge pity, because the idea is very interesting.  A lower class boy genius and only one man that can really seem to help him. There was so much room to develope and expand the idea. Yet it never really does so.  Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance. Affleck moreso.  There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in. But the movie always seem to lose that connection. Not all the characters were expanded like they could have been.This movie is good, but it could have been great.

81171,AVAHA06K08ZKK,0788814664,Alwyn Lau,"[2, 8]","In Good Will Hunting (the 1997 movie starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Robin Williams) we see a juxtaposition of the academic and institutionally revered with 'street-level' forms of the trivial and repulsive. Maths discussions filled with heavy-weight theories and formulae share center-stage with sleazy sex conversations and crap-talk of the most juvenile level.This reaches a zenith at a Harvard bar when Will Hunting's (the genius abused and abandoned by his parents who's also the pro-an-tagonist of the show, played well by then first-timer Matt Damon) friend, Chuckie (played to perfection by a then similarly unknown Ben Affleck), tried to pass himself off as a Harvard student to chat up girls but got into trouble when a real Harvard boy challenged him. At the very moment when Chuckie would've had to slink away in intellectual humiliation, Will comes in and stunningly blows the other guy away with his page-precise citations of American history, exposing his opponent as a plagiarist who had a long way to go in terms of academic robustness. Will, of course, can't resist slamming the entire American college education system when he mocked the Harvard student for having ""dropped a 150 grand on an education which he could've gotten for 1.50 in late-charges at the public library.""And that's the turning point in the movie. It's not just the place where ""street"" meets ""smart"", it's also where Will meets Skylar, his future girlfriend whose love yet frailty and very human demands force Will to either radically reconsider (with the help of his psychologist, Sean, sensitively portrayed by crazyman Robin Williams) his whole I-don't-give-a-damn philosophy or lose the one person who loves him and desperately wants him to love her.Assuming the movie isn't just about the personal redemption of an orphan who also happens to be a genius, what else is it about? Is the film showing us the kinds of worlds we live in, one reflective of society's best values, another nonsensical and ultimately self-destructive? Or are we being presented with two kinds of serious? Or does the movie claim that human betterment can only be achieved via an immersion in and familiarity with the 'scum' and dregs of society?This last theme - that the mind-blindingly brilliant is often not only indistinguishable from the unhygienically banal but often requires it - has many expressions in the movie. E.g. Will's counselor, Sean, came from a rough neighbourhood and was the only one who could 'reach' Will, with at least three other 'academic' types failing miserably; Gerry, the Maths professor looking for Will, couldn't find him without the help of two janitors; Sean talks about how Will's friends, despite their socio-economic situation, has unflinching loyalty for Will, implying that this virtue is somehow alien to the likes of Gerry; Part of Sean's brilliant monologue to Will in the park includes explaining how the simple act of sitting next to a dying wife makes the difference between knowing about love and knowing what love truly is i.e. Sean's being there trumps all the books Will has and will ever read.The title of the movie itself, 'Good Will Hunting', gives us a paradox in the form of a question, ""What's so good about Will?"" His intellect, whilst undeniably supreme, has served not much use apart from giving him an edge in assault-and-battery cases (in which he defends himself by using cases over a hundred years old). All his reading and arguments have entrenched him even deeper in his social defiance, deep yet hidden self-pity and more than occasional explosions of violence. One could even say that because he was so smart, he could never fail to see why he didn't have to change his life. A critical point of the movie is when Chuckie, completely against expectations, rebukes Will for wasting his talent. Chuckie, despite being far less gifted than Will, profoundly recognises his limits and because of that chides Will for NOT seeing how he has no limits, and how his continued refusal to seek out success represents an insult to people like Chuckie.Of course, one could also see the title 'Good Will Hunting' as the search for goodwill in people's lives and our own. This not only exemplifies Will's (unacknowledged?) quest in the movie, it also points out the surprising places and persons where goodwill can be found: in a grieving psychologist, in foul-mouthed dirt-poor friends and from students nowhere near one's intellectual standards but who love with aching passion.In a word, 'good' was bad, and the 'bad' contains much which can be called good and if we can't see that, then too bad.",3,"The Good, The Bad and How We Need Both",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,4625,"['Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', '1997', 'movie', 'starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck',

81172,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,0788814664,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[9, 12]","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an MIT janitor and mathematical genius with major attachment and abuse reactive disorders (though the film doesn't identify the latter). After Will solves an ""impossible"" math problem Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) chalked on the board outside his classroom, the goodly pedant attends Hunting's latest arraignment for fighting, and convinces a skeptical judge that he can salvage the boy's otherwise futile life.After false starts with several ""master"" psychologists whom Hunting easily outwits, Lambeau approaches Sean McGuire (Robin Williams). Lambeau figures, who better to help the boy than his eclectic former college roommate, like Hunting a tough-skinned ""Southie"" (South Boston native)?Thus begins Hunting's frequent forays into Cambridge to ""study"" with Lambeau and his mathematical colleagues, whom he usually humiliates by solving their toughest problems in the blink of an eye.In one clever scene, Hunting takes his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) and two other Southie sidekicks to a Cambridge bar. Chuckie tries to impress Harvard student Skylar (Minnie Driver). A self-satisfied graduate student prig interrupts, and tries embarrassing Chuck to captivate Skylar. That backfires when Hunting steps in. He has also apparently read and memorized every book ever written. The prig slinks away in shame. As Hunting and friends depart, Skylar approaches and hands him her number.As another reviewer notes, Good Will Hunting is good and original--but where good, is not original and where original, is not good. I'd agree that the film nicely portrays lower class Boston Irish life, and the strange match between a high class orphan (and upper-class) Harvard woman and a brilliant street tough, whose early life was marred by constant physical abuse. The acting in general is very strong, with Robin Williams (as always) at the head of the class.But the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck screenplay, while often fine and riveting, is also at times completely nave. As young actors, before this film gave them their first break, Damon and Affleck bought into ahistorical propaganda and never let go. Thus in one session with McGuire, Hunting again spews forth his mastery of great literature and science, but like an otherwise unread cultist ranks Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky with Shakespeare. Utterly ballsy---and too stupid.If the math is inaccurate, so what. That's not a key point of this film.But it is extremely unfortunate that the movie portrays a sudden breakthrough when Hunting finally gets down to talking to McGuire about the serial beatings he suffered as a child. Everyone even slightly familiar with psychological therapy knows this is genuinely incredible (as in not believable). Genius or not, no patient who experienced such major early life traumas could achieve such complete healing after only a few months of counseling. This might make pleasant fiction. But given the seriousness of the film's central theme, it dangerously suggests the impossible is possible and could give some viewers false hope.--Alyssa A.

It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story.The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the proffesor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neigborhood in south Boston.As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.Filled with great profound dialouges and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotinal experience.

81175,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,0788814664,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","I saw this movie on DVD last month and I must say that I was taken by this warm-hearted picture. It is the film that established Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the mega stars they would one day become.Damon plays Will Hunting, a blue collar kid who was an orphan. He came up hard in Boston and has to struggle to make it in life. He only has his friends and when they get in a scrape with local Italian-American toughs, he finds himself in prison for beating up a cop. A local professor sees Hunting's potential and intercedes with the judge who grudgingly allows for Hunting's parole. However, in order for Hunting to get that parole he must meet with a shrink for therapy. That is where Robin William's character comes in. This was his Oscar winning role.I won't go into any more detail on the plot suffice it to say that this is a picture everyone in the family can and will enjoy. I loved the DVD extras too. Get this dVD and you won't be disappointed. I have made the 349th Five-Star review and it is the 536th overall.A.

81177,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788814664,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","There is an air of clich&eacute;d familiarity that runs through the veins of `Good Will Hunting', but that familiarity never reaches a point of exhaustion.  What I mean to say is that there is enough going for the film that makes up for the lack of original (or even at times `realistic') spark.  The plot is formulistic.  You have a poor orphan who grew up in a rough neighborhood and never committed himself to education, yet he works as a janitor for a prestigious college so that he can listen and learn and when his impressive math IQ is discovered he is immediately pulled at from all angles in a struggle to dominate his genius.  What takes this script to another level though are the marvelous performances that embody the film.  I was really taken aback by everyone in the cast; the emotion and dedication and attention they gave to the spirit and soul of their characters.To me, this film is above all else an acting showcase and I will review it as such.First of all we have Matt Damon.  For a long time I considered Matt to be just another pretty face; an actor who was there because of his chiseled abs and his charming demeanor, but then I saw `The Talented Mr. Ripley' and I realized that this guy is a very talented actor.  Matt has proven again and again that he deserves his garnered fame.  This performance was probably the first real confirmation of his talent.  First of all he co-wrote the script; but that is not is forte.  The script, like I mentioned, is formulistic and clich&eacute;d and really is the weakest facet of the finished product.  Damon's performance on the other hand is one of the strongest.  As Will he really fleshes himself out to the audience.  We see the breakdown of his soul and understand who he is on the inside; the man he is striving to become, fighting to become, but most importantly we see the parts of himself he is afraid he'll lose.  This is such a marvelous performance, one that is truly deserving of the praise and accolades it garnered (bravo to the Oscar nomination) and one that you truly won't forget.Next we have Robin Williams.  I love Robin.  I think that he is one of our greatest comedians working today and he never fails to attack my funny bone.  As a serious actor he is hit or miss with me.  I loved his calm and restrained insanity demonstrated in `One Hour Photo' and `Insomnia'.  On the other hand I loathed the failed attempt at the same he exhibited in `The Final Cut'.  I thought that he was dull and boring in `The Dead Poets Society' yet loved his comforting tone in `Awakenings' (albeit he stood no chance against the force that was DeNiro).  Here I am pleased yet not overwhelmed.  I thought that Williams' performance was touching and sincere, yet it is not outstanding, thus I feel that his Oscar win was a bit of a stretch (personally I felt both Kinnear & Reynolds were more deserving).  As Doctor Sean Maguire he does what he can to make his clich&eacute;d character real and understandable, and there are moments where he really grabs me (one such moment is his adlibbed spiel about his wife's flatulence which I found hilarious yet emotionally resonant to his characters warmth) yet his performance to me is not nearly as memorable as those provided by the remaining cast members.Which brings me to Ben Affleck.  I am not one who believes Affleck is a good actor.  I enjoyed him in a few things, very few things, but here he really reached me.  His character was so natural and believable and even moving.  Maybe that's because he wrote the character for himself, I don't know, but he really nailed this one.  Throughout the film his character takes a backseat to Damon, but he never allows himself to drift into the background completely, and there are moments where he really steals the limelight and shines the brightest.  One scene in particular comes near the end of the film, when he character Chuckie is having his `heart to heart' with Will.  Affleck expresses so much emotional depth here, so much natural and heartfelt warmth and understanding that it serves as one of the most fundamental scenes in the film.  Affleck may never be this good again, but at least he was this good once.Now I am a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard.  I just love the majority of his work.  His performances in the films of Lars von Treir are what initially grabbed me (I just adored his devilish qualities in both `Dogville' and `Breaking the Waves') but time and time again he manages to grip me completely.  Here is no exception.  Skarsgard (who just has the coolest name) has a very limited role as Professor Gerald Lambeau, but his presence is felt throughout the film.  His misplaced arrogance and false sense of concern is prominent and effective and is displayed on the faces of all who come in contact with him.  I just love his methods of delivery and am always compelled to adore him even when his character isn't deserving of adoration (which is more often than not).I'll make a quick note before moving forward that both Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser are effective in their small roles as friends of Will and Chuckie.  Both actors have little to do but both actors have shaped decent careers for themselves since; most notably Affleck who garnered an Oscar nomination last year for his riveting performance as the cowardly killer of one Jesse James.  I have mentioned before that I think Cole Hauser is a better actor than his poor film choices allow, so I'll just leave it at that.  Give him a decent movie already.So the last actor (or should I say actress) that I want to discuss here is Minnie Driver.  Her performance, for me at least, is best in show.  I will say first and foremost that I adore Minnie Driver.  I think that she is an extremely talented actress who just soars in both charm and beauty and charisma and natural grace.  Here is no exception.  As Skylar, Will's love interest, she is a dynamic force, a joyous and lovable portrayal of honest emotion.  I love the way that her character feels real; just watching her interact with Will in childish ways add layers of believability to her character.  She is relatable.  Her final scene with Will breaks my heart into a million pieces every time I see it.  She moves me to action and I think that's why I just can't help but laud this performance above all else in the film.""I love you Skylar.""Every time I watch this movie, especially during that climatic scene, I am compelled to utter those words aloud.""I love you Skylar.""So there you have it; my thoughts on the movie that is `Good Will Hunting'.  As a film itself (that is script wise) it is nothing spectacular, but the many moving performances make this a must see film.  I can somewhat agree with the sentiments that this is an overrated film for it is not as impressive as many films released that same year, but acting wise it is close to the front of the pack (it's hard because 1997 also brought us `L.A. Confidential' which sports some of the best performances of the year as well).  I'll watch this movie again and again just for the brilliance that is Minnie Driver (not to mention Damon) and I'm sure that even if you don't `adore' this film you will find the satisfaction needed within in order for you to justify multiple watches.  One cannot forsake the importance of a solid director, and while Gus Van Sant is somewhat hit or miss with me his direction here is a definite hit, for he drew from his actors exactly what was needed in order to make a simple script shine through its muddled clich&eacute;s.",4,An `okay' script produces a `good' movie thanks to some `great' performances...,1212105600,"05 30,

Robin Williams, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck put on a half A-- performance in this movie about god knows what...and Im not kidding, I really don't know what!?!?  Never at any point in the movie does it tell you exactly what it is that Will is hunting.  It doesn't even take place in the wilderness with the exception of the scene where Sean is calling out Damon on a park bench. There are a few swans swimming in the pond but they can't be hunting those because it is illegal to hunt swans to begin with.  This movie tries to portay Will as some kind of Pimp Daddy by showing his smooth skills while wheeling and dealing Skylar (Mimi Rogers) which for starters doesn't seem like much of a challenge considering I think something was going on with her and the Michael Bolton clone and secondly, I think Will and Sean were gay for each other.  If there was a sequel, it would most likely show Will driving back to Boston in that orange disgrace of a pumpkin (car) in search of his true love Sean.  Of course America could never accept this which is why Good Will Hunting turned out to be a homophobic mess of mixed up plots.  Terrible film, hated it.

81180,A21POY1H479TTP,0788814664,Ante Soda,"[4, 5]","First things first - this must be one of the greatest movies in recent Hollywood history. Like all truly great movies, this one is built multi-dimensionally, with an intelligent large-scale development (global movie structure, several parallel stories between main characters, excellent dialogs in major scenes), while at the same time realizing that beauty lies in the detail (shading of supporting characters and interactions between them, witty dialogs in 'smaller' scenes which are not directly related to the main plot, music which beautifully underlines the plot and the characters). With respect to supporting roles, I can only think of one other movie where they are portrayed with more texture and depth, Heat by M. Mann. In Good Will Hunting there are several different, but connected plots developing at the same time on multiple levels, and it feels like every single one of those plots could make a solid movie on its own. On the highest level there are relationships between Will and his girlfriend, between Will and his best buddy, and Will and his tutor No. 1 (Sean). Then, on the next lower level, we have parallel stories between Will and his tutor No. 2 (Math Prof Gerald), and between Sean and Gerald (actually this one is my favorite sub-plot in the whole movie). Going even further down, you can find small pearls, for example those beautiful sketch roles of Will's two other buddies, Billy and Morgan, or the stereotypical pairing of extrovert math professor with his introvert Russian assistant.What I absolutely love about this movie are the dialogs. There are some heavy artillery dialog scenes: Sean telling Will he doesn't know a first thing about his life as an orphan just because he read Oliver Twist, Sean telling Will it's not about his girlfriend being perfect or him being perfect but it's about being perfect for each other, Skylar asking Will why is he afraid to come with her to California, Chuckie telling Will 'you don't owe it to yourself - you owe it to me', Sean asking Gerald why he's still so f...g afraid of failure, Sean telling Will it's not his fault... And then there are those beautiful 'side-dish' dialogs: Prof. Gerald trying to find Will in the workshop and talking to those two men who basically tell him to piss off, funny 'pickled' kiss between Will and Skylar on their first date, Gerald asking Sean to become a counselor for Will and Sean replying with 'How many shrinks did you go to before me? Barry? Henry? Not Rick!'For lot of people the story is not realistic enough (kid with mind of a genius, knowing everything about everything) and/or too stereotypical (poor kid making it big by listening to his heart). All I can say is: a) the story is not trying to be very realistic, it is also symbolic and abstract, and b) every novel, poem, movie or song in the last five thousand years is basically about same things: love and money. But we still like them because the same old story is (almost) always presented in a different way, there's always a new angle. I mean, the story is ancient, so it's not so much about what the story is about, it's much more about how the story is told. And this story is told in a way that every young person out there, no matter how intelligent or how talented he or she might be, can get inspired to go Good Will Hunting!As I already said - this is a very, very good movie. But it's not 100 percent perfect. And that's a good thing. There's a line near the end of the movie, when Sean is telling Will his counseling is finished and asks him if he would like to see his file. Will asks Sean if he's had any personal experience with child abuse and Sean replies 'yes, my father was an alcoholic, mean f...g drunk.' I think that's a bit too much, I mean, it makes Sean a perfect counselor (his wife dying of cancer, holding his dying friend in Vietnam, smelling the paint in the Sistine Chapel, etc).

81181,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0788814664,Anthony Hinde,"[143, 154]","There were few films in 1997 that enjoyed more publicity than Good Will Hunting. Most of the hype centered on the two tyro actors who penned the screenplay. It seems that they had been friends for years and in between  college obligations, drinking and socialising, they had been toying with a  script on the side. What started out as a rather average comedy, soon  evolved into a sophisticated drama. In fact, it could hardly  avoid getting  better as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck must have received a ton of brutal  criticism from every Hollywood executive that they approached.The  true miracle is not that two actors, unknown for writing, could get a  script accepted in Hollywood but that the script was so good that it put  every other effort for the year in the shade. In my opinion, the motion  picture academy was correct in awarding the Oscar for best screenplay to  Good Will Hunting. Everything about the script suggested writers with a  profound understanding of the human condition; even now I half suspect  there was an element of that old saying about an infinite number of monkeys  on typewriters.For those interested in this Cinderella story  within a movie, you should listen to the director's track on the DVD. It  offers a unique insight into the background of the writing and filming of  Good Will Hunting. It becomes clear from Ben and Matt's reminiscences that  they had a ball during every part of the process. Not only that, they took  advantage of their opportunity, to offer support roles to friends and  family; a situation that rarely occurs outside of independent film.  Surprisingly, one of the best support performances was produced by Casey  Affleck, who is Ben's cousin, (I think).The script took a bit of  a risk by making the main character a super-genius. Not only is it  difficult to portray a person with such talents but it is nearly impossible  to do so while making him likeable. After all, the tall  poppy syndrome is  strongest when it comes to intellect. We can all aspire to wealth and with  plastic surgery, even beauty is not unattainable but the brains you are  born with is the most you're ever going to have. However, Matt Damon proved  me wrong on both counts.Will Hunting was undeniably bright. The  scene in the Harvard bar were he takes on an educational supremacist is  worth watching again and again just for the superb timing that was  employed. Will also manages to win our sympathy despite his I.Q. Not so  much because he acts like &quot;one of the boys&quot; but because we  discover early on that for every blessing he received in the brain  department, he was given a matching curse in his life. An orphan who was  raised by a series of abusing foster parents is unlikely to have much room  left for pride.The catalyst which helps Will break out of his  life is Gerald Lambeau, (Stellan Skarsgrd). He is an award winning  mathematician and professor at MIT where Will works as a janitor. Their  paths cross when Will off-handedly solves a difficult maths problem which  Lambeau had set for his post graduate class. But whilst there relationship  is important, it is little more than a subplot; a segue toward Will's  eventual meeting with Sean Maguire, a psychiatrist played by Robin  Williams.Sean is invited by Lambeau to work with Will. The two  are old friends but even so, Sean was only approached after four other  therapists had been run off by Will's destructive insights and bitter  insults. Sean is a bird of a different feather however. He shares a common  background with Will, and if anything, he has had more pain in his life  than Will may ever see. In a strange way, Sean becomes Will's mother to  Lambeau's role as ambitious father.The film is rich with detail  and is a wonderful medium for the support actors. Ben Affleck's role as  Will's best friend is not as visible as Matt Damon's but he carries it off  with just the right amount of fatalism and aggression. Will's Lady friend  Skylar, is also worth special mention. Minnie Driver takes a seemingly  token &quot;love interest&quot; role and breaths real depth into it.  Without her efforts, Will's final choice would not have rung true and might  have marred the whole film.Good Will Hunting is a tribute to the  dreams of American youth. Both because two young men managed to reach the  pinnacle of their craft on their first outing but more importantly, because  it deals with one young man's struggle to overcome his troublesome past  while reaching out to grasp life, love and happiness. It's touching,  entertaining and at the same time inspirational.",5,Good film crafting,957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,4594,"['were', 'few', 'films', '1997', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'publicity', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Most', 'hype', 'centered', 'two', 'tyro', 'actors', 'who', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'had', 'been', 'friends', 'years', 'college', 'obligations', 'drinking', 'socialising', 'had', 'been', 'toying', 'script', 'side', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'rather', 'average', 'comedy', 'soon', 'evolved', 'sophisticated', 'drama', 'fact', 'could', 'hardly', 'avoid', 'getting', 'better', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'must', 'have', 'received', 'ton', 'brutal', 'criticism', 'Hollywood', 'executive', 'approached.The', 'true', 'miracle', 'not', 'two', 'actors', 'unknown', 'writing', 'could', 'get', 'script', 'accepted', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'put', 'other', 'effort', 'year', 'shade', 'opinion', 'motion', 'picture', 'academy', 'was', 'correct', 'awarding', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Everything', 'script', 'suggested', 'writers', 'profound', 'understanding', 'human', 'condition', 'even', 'now', 'half', 'suspect', 'was', 'element', 'old', 'saying', 'infinite', 'number', 'monkeys', 'typewriters.For', 'interested', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'movie', 'should', 'listen', 'director', 'track', 'DVD', 'unique', 'insight', 'background', 'writing', 'filming', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'clear', 'Ben', 'Matt', 'reminiscences', 'had', 'ball', 'part', 'process', 'Not', 'only', 'took', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'offer', 'support', 'roles', 'friends', 'family', 'situation', 'rarely', 'independent', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'one', 'best', 'support', 'performances', 'was', 'produced', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'who', 'Ben', 'cousin', 'think', '.The', 'script', 'took', 'bit', 'risk', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'super-genius', 'Not', 'only', 'difficult', 'portray', 'person', 'such', 'talents', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'making', 'likeable', 'tall', 'poppy', 'syndrome', 'strongest', 'when', 'intellect', 'can', 'aspire', 'wealth', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'even', 'beauty', 'not', 'unattainable', 'brains', 'are', 'born', 'most', ""'re"", 'ever', 'going', 'have', 'However', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'proved', 'wrong', 'counts.Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'undeniably', 'bright', 'scene', 'Harvard', 'bar', 'were', 'educational', 'supremacist', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'just', 'superb', 'timing', 'was', 'employed', 'Will', 'also', 'win', 'sympathy', 'I.Q', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'quot', 'one', 'boys', 'quot', 'discover', 'early', 'blessing', 'received', 'brain', 'department', 'was', 'given', 'matching', 'curse', 'life', 'orphan', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'series', 'abusing', 'foster', 'parents', 'unlikely', 'have', 'much', 'room', 'left', 'pride.The', 'catalyst', 'Will', 'break', 'life', 'Gerald', 'Lambeau', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'award', 'winning', 'mathematician', 'professor', 'MIT', 'where', 'Will', 'janitor', 'paths', 'cross', 'when', 'Will', 'off-handedly', 'difficult', 'maths', 'problem', 'Lambeau', 'had', 'set', 'post', 'graduate', 'class', 'whilst', 'relationship', 'important', 'little', 'more', 'subplot', 'segue', 'Will', 'eventual', 'meeting', 'Sean', 'Maguire', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams.Sean', 'invited', 'Lambeau', 'work', 'Will', 'two', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'even', 'so', 'Sean', 'was', 'only', 'approached', 'four', 'other', 'therapists', 'had', 'been', 'run', 'off', 'Will', 'destructive', 'insights', 'bitter', 'insults', 'Sean', 'bird', 'different', 'feather', 'however', 'shares', 'common', 'background', 'Will', 'anything', 'had', 'more', 'pain', 'life', 'Will', 'may', 'ever', 'see', 'strange', 'way', 'Sean', 'Will', 'mother', 'Lambeau', 'role', 'ambitious', 'father.The', 'film', 'rich', 'detail', 'wonderful', 'medium', 'support', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'role', 'Will', 'best', 'friend', 'not', 'as', 'visible', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'off', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'fatalism', 'aggression', 'Will', 'Lady', 'friend', 'Skylar', 'also', 'worth', 'special', 'mention', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'seemingly', 'token', 'quot', 'interest', 'quot', 'role', 'breaths', 'real', 'depth', 'efforts', 'Will', 'final', 'choice', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'rung', 'true', 'might', 'have', 'marred', 'whole', 'film.Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'tribute', 'dreams', 'American', 'youth', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'managed', 'reach', 'pinnacle', 'craft', 'first', 'outing', 'more', 'importantly', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'troublesome', 'past', 'reaching', 'out', 'grasp', 'life', 'love', 'happiness', 'touching', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'inspirational']",Good Will Hunting

Because of his experience in making juvenile delinquent films, Gus Van Sant is perfect for Good Will Hunting. I know this because I have seen what he had done in My Own Private Idaho, Drugstore Cowboy, and To Die For. Much of what Will Hunting, played exceptionally by Matt Damon, represents is found through me. I lived my life exactly what was said through the dialogues in Good Will Hunting, and it's completely well-described. What makes Will Hunting so unique is his complex characterization. The psychological side of Good Will Hunting is right on the money. Robin Williams proves once again that he is one of the best actors when it comes to dramas. Don't forget what he did in Awakenings, one of the most beautifully acted and underrated performance of his career, and The Fisher King. Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver did a wonderful job in terms of complementing along with the storyline of Good Will Hunting, and a lot of credit also goes to Stellan Skarsgard. All in all, Good Will Hunting is a phenomenally made film and earns the best picture of 1997 from me. Good Will Hunting is one of the best films I've seen in my life.2/12: When I saw Good Will Hunting the first time, it felt like I was seeing myself in it.

Until recently I couldn't figure out why Will never applied himself in school and go on to college and all, since he's so obviously interested in learning, studying in his spare time as a hobby. Another reviewer wisely pointed out after reading my old review of this flick that Will never outwardly pursued academics because he probably was afraid of being alienated by his circle of friends, none of whom were gifted at all like he was.

He works as a janitor at MIT, and when a math professor puts a major brain-buster math problem on the blackboard outside his classroom, Will supplies the answer anonymously. Nobody in the professor's classroom claims credit for it, so he puts another one on the board and Will solves that one, too. But this time the professor catches him at it.Turns out Will has a long juvenile delinquency record, and is only on that job because his probation officer got it for him. The professor tracks him down and manages to get him released in exchange for two promises: he will do some high-level math work with the professor, and he will see a therapist. After several false starts, the professor's old friend Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) undertakes to be Will's therapist. That's what most of the story is about.Will is a genuine genius, but he tends to see it as more of a burden than a blessing. He is completely self-educated by hanging out in the public library, and apparently has a nearly photographic memory. He's also very awkward with women, hangs out with some very (ahem) working class losers, and seems to have no more ambition than outsmarting anyone who would pin him down. My own diagnosis for him is Asperger's syndrome. But then that's also my own unprofessional diagnosis of myself. And after all, he does have the terrific face and body of Matt Damon.Good movie.

Minnie Driver is also excellent as the love interest drawing Will Hunting toward his beckoning adulthood. She is also the occasion for the single best line in the film; ""You like apples? I got her phone number! How do you like them apples?"" This film works so well on so many levels that it is really a shame that it lost the Oscar for best picture to ""Shakespeare In Love"", for this is a far more powerful, enduring, and worthwhile film experience. if you haven't seen it, I recommend you RUN to the nearest video store and rent it.

I think he would have liked &quot;GoodWill Hunting&quot;, a movie about a young genius floundering away as a janitor at M.I.T.Matt Damon plays the troubled kid, Will Hunting and Ben Afflect (&quot;Chasing Amy&quot;) plays his best friend Chuckie.  (In real life, Affleck and Damon are good friends and co-wrote the screenplay, which won an Oscar and a Golden Globe; Damon was also nominated for Best Actor, although some have suggested that may be undeserved.)  The story focuses on Will.  An abused orphan, the young man solves a difficult mathematical theorem and is soon envied by the professors at M.I.T.  He also has a rap sheet as long as his arm and is released from jail only on the condition he sees a therapist.  After an unsuccessful start with a number of big-name shrinks, he settles in with one he begins to trust (played by Robin Williams).  He also falls for a Harvard pre-med student (well played by Minnie Driver) he meets in a bar.

81195,A30TQET02FLSUX,0788814664,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[27, 31]","Every now and then, a movie comes along that absolutely blows your world apart. It gives you a perspective on life that you never had before. It weasels its way into your psyche, unbeknownst to you, and takes root...becoming a major part of your inner workings. It's like Inception! When I first saw Good Will Hunting (1997) in 1998 when it came out, I had no idea that 13 years later this little indie film written by two wet-behind-the-ear kids from ""Bahh-ston"" would be one of my favorite films of all time. I mean...these two guys, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, are my contemporaries and I was 24 when this movie touched my heart and soul. That's pretty incredible writing from two young guys in their 20s, which won them both Oscars for Best Original Screenplay. Good Will Hunting is firmly planted in my Top 25 films of all time. And I doubt it will ever leave. Especially because the film is as fresh and critical today as it ever was. Repeatedly, over and over, this movie gets to me like so few do.It's a perfect film (5 out of 5 stars) about the inherent flaws and failures that go hand-in-hand with life's greatest successes and achievements. The human condition, especially the condition of being a man, is flopped onto the operating table in Good Will Hunting and surgically dissected into all the psychological bits and quirks that somehow magically come together to create each of our lives. The emotional and intellectual depth present in the script, the acting, the dialogue, and all the details of this film, belies its book cover. If by some odd chance you haven't yet gone on this journey with Will Hunting, then by all means, get into this film now and for many years to come.I watched Good Will Hunting for the umpteenth time tonight, but for the first time in over a year and the first time in HD. Having seen the film in the theater, on VHS, on DVD, and on TV, I know it like the back of my hand. And yet in HD, there were details that were brought to my attention like never before. Textures in the actors faces, colors that were brighter than they've ever been, locations that popped out, and dialog that reminds us all why we enjoyed The Social Network (2010) so much this past year. Director Gus Van Sant has never been better in his cinematic craftsmanship, then with his work on Good Will Hunting. He brings his artistic flare and unique storytelling techniques to a more mainstream presentation than his typical indie fare. It's films like this that make someone's career, or bring it back to life. And it did that for all the major players here. It brought the incredible filmmaking talents of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to the attention of Hollywood, both for acting and writing. It brought Gus Van Sant into the light of mainstream Hollywood directing. It really introduced us to Stellan Skarsgrd, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser, all of whom are well known actors now, who got there talents showcased in this film. And it finally gave Robin Williams his much deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, after being nominated for his incredible work in Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Dead Poets Society (1989).It's hard for me to write about Good Will Hunting because its the kind of complex, intelligent, yet very emotional story that is really best told through film, not writing. I love reading good prose like anyone, but film has a way of bringing that prose to life through its visuals, emotions, and music that our brains just don't create for us in our imaginations quite so viscerally. That being said, I'll do the best I can here! Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a mathematical genius in the form of a young man who was an abused orphan. Hunting has struggled all of his life, moving from foster home to foster home, job to job, and brawl to brawl. But living in South Boston, he's made some extremely close friends...brothers really...played ironically and fortuitously by real life brothers Ben & Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser. It absolutely helps sell the realism of the relationship between these actors that 3 out of 4 of them grew up in Boston together in real life.After Will gets into another fight to defend his tough 'Southie"" reputation, he gets arrested and put in jail. And this time he can't intellectualize his way out of it. But before being arrested, he catches the attention of a math professor at Harvard, played brilliantly by Stellan Skarsgrd. Professor Gerald Lambeau challenges his students to solve a complex math problem that he puts up on a chalkboard. Working as a Janitor at Harvard, Will puts the solution to the math problem on the chalkboard one night while cleaning, and eventually gets discovered by Lambeau, who convinces the Judge to let Will out of jail under his guidance and care. But in return, Will has to attend weekly therapy sessions to address his issues with violence and crime. After going through a string of different types of therapists, Lambeau takes Will to his old college roommate Sean Maguire who happens to be a psychologist and community college instructor from Southie, just like Will. Robin Williams plays Maguire with absolute brilliance, creating a character that challenges, helps and befriends Will. The rest of the movie follows this journey through Will's therapy sessions, his new love relationship with Minnie Driver's ""Skylar"", his weekly ""hang outs"" with his best friends, and his work with Professor Lambeau solving complex math problems. The journey is really all about Will completing his past and starting to discover who he is and what gifts he has.I think the main reason Good Will Hunting has such a strong place in my heart as a film is because of the story of Will. While totally different than my own, it still has the same fundamentals of growing up, finding yourself, getting complete with your childhood and your past, falling in love, and searching for your purpose in life that we all experience....and continue to experience over and over again throughout life. While I'm no math genius, never been to Boston, or been an orphan, I still strongly relate to the emotional and psychological struggles that Will has. Damon and Affleck clearly wrote this story pulling from their own lives to some degree, their own journeys into male adulthood, and brought a realism to the details of the story that makes this relatable to just about anyone. The jokes and stories in Good Will Hunting are absolutely hilarious and still give me a great laugh now, dozens of times later. And the verbal banter between Skarsgrd and Williams, Williams and Damon, Damon and Driver, and amongst the 4 friends/brothers, is simply some of the best dialog ever written and acted. I laugh, I cry, and I escape in to the world of Will Hunting every single time I watch this movie.I've said before that part of how I judge a movie to be a 4 or 5 star film is because of it's longevity and appeal over time. I rarely give a movie that I see for the first time a 4 or 5 star rating. Usually they get 3 or 3.5 stars initially, and then have to earn there way up the ladder through repeated viewings over years. I know that Good Will Hunting was probably a 3.5 or 4 star film to me when I first saw it, not that I was rating films back then like I do now. But over the years, I've connected with Good Will Hunting time and time again. It's one of those movies that I watch once a year, not so much as ""entertainment"" but as a heartfelt psychological escape that puts me ""in touch with the universe"" as I like to call it. It reconnects me, when I need it to, to the universal energy and ""truths"" that we are all continually seeking comfort in. It reminds me that I'm here to live the life I've been given, and not someone else's. Will feels this obligation to his friends to stick around Southie, to work in some blue collar job like the rest of them, to raise a family there and go to ball games with his friends and their eventual families. But Will has talents and genius that don't really fit into that world. And he's pulled in these two opposite directions, one with his head and one with his heart. Who in their life hasn't felt that same struggle at some point? Or goes through it again? And again? I know that I have...and that I continue to periodically. Good Will Hunting reminds me to connect my head and my heart and create a path that wins for both.As I was watching all of the sizzling scenes between Skarsgard and Williams tonight, it dawned on me more clearly than ever how these two characters represent the two opposing, yet complimentary aspects of our human nature: our mind and our heart. Skarsgard, as the Math Professor, represents our intellect, our mind, our voice that's always rattling things off to us in our head. That logical and responsible part of ourselves. Williams, as the Psychologist, represents our heart, our soul, our gut instincts, our feelings. That lover and fighter within us. These two yin-and-yang characters play out so well when separated into these distinct characters, giving us an external view into our own internal battles. I've always known this on a subconscious level, but tonight I became aware of it consciously. Amazing how this film keeps giving me little kernels of insight into myself and into the universe each time I watch it and internalize it.In terms of filmmaking, Good Will Hunting has excellent production design, Oscar level acting by nearly the entire cast, brilliant writing, subtle but incredible cinematography, and masterful directing. It just doesn't get much better than this! The music and score for Good Will Hunting, while subtle like the photography, are perfectly fitted for the mood, emotion, and story of this film. Music Composer Danny Elfman did his best work here, still to this day. What strikes me most about Director of Photography Jean-Yves Escoffier's work here is the stillness he brings to the shots. It's like he's waiting with his camera for something to happen. And it does! He lets the actors, the sets, and the locations do the work, instead of the handheld photography doing the work. I feel like so many current films, like Black Swan (2010) for example, get caught up in handheld photography that makes me feel like we've all got ADD and can't just sit and watch the story unfold, but that we need the camera to ""jiggle"" to remind us somehow that we are like voyeurs peeking into the lives of these characters. I don't need that on every character-driven movie! There's my little rant on the current state of handheld cinematography being so dominant in current films. But my point is that Good Will Hunting, which pre-dates the current popularity of handheld photography, has a more subtle yet powerful way of presenting its visuals to us through the richness of the design of the sets, the locations, the costumes and makeup, and the actors themselves.I look forward to the eventual release of this cinematic masterpiece on Blu-ray, which I would bet comes to fruition this year or next. It will certainly be a film that I upgrade my current DVD collection to include in HD. And hopefully Damon and Affleck will re-team someday to bring us another film of this caliber. As far as I'm concerned, they both have yet to top their performances in Good Will Hunting. But they've come really close with their recent work. Damon with the Bourne Trilogy, and Affleck with The Town (2010).",5,A film that rooted itself in my soul and has never left,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,11391,"['now', 'then', 'movie', 'absolutely',

81197,A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI,0788814664,Book Glutton,"[2, 3]","Begin with the name ""Good Will Hunting"" and you find there are a number of ways it can be unpacked, producing different meaning--all of which can describe the plot of this movie from a different angle. There is certainly ""hunting"" taking place. Matt Damon does the hunting as: Will Hunting. He's the genius who cannot be genius because his inner world needs more basic and primitive securities than this before that aspect of his life can be put into perspective. He therefore remains with what he sees as the ""safe life"" of janitor (at MIT), beer-swiller, and thug--a step from prison--which feed off this inner-storm of rage left to him from childhood. Robin Williams (the psychoanalyst), Ben Affleck (his South Boston best friend) and Minnie Driver (true love--sorely needed & found) each do their part in participating ""in the hunt!""We must start with the given: that we are all looking for happiness. Many times, we are looking in all the wrong places. The condition and struggle we see in Will is something I have not seen described better, and more concisely, than Thomas Keating in his work,The Human Condition: Contemplation and Transformation (Wit Lectures-Harvard Divinity School), excerpted below from pp. 13-14. In these days of sweeping dysfunction in families, this is not uncommon, nor is it hard to recognize:""All of us have been through the process of being born and entering this world with three essential biological needs: security and survival, power and control, affection and esteem. ...these three instinctual needs are all we have with which to build a program for happiness. ... As a result, any object entering into our universe--another person or event--is judged on the basis of whether it can provide us with what we believe or demand happiness to be.""Children who are deprived of security, affection, and control needs develop a desperate drive to find more and more symbols of these basic human needs in their culture. This is called compensation. It can also happen that when experiences in early childhood are unbearable, they are repressed into the unconscious. The body seems to be a kind of warehouse in which all our experiences--the whole of our lives--are recorded....""Here, then, is the beginning of what might be called the addictive process, the need to hide the pain that we suffered in early life and cannot face. We repress it into the unconscious to provide an apparent freedom from the pain or develop compensatory processes to access forms of pleasure that offset the pain we are not yet prepared to face. We are thrust because of circumstances into the position of developing a homemade self that does not conform to reality. Everything entering into the world that makes survival and security, affection and esteem, and power and control our chief pursuits of happiness has to be judged on the basis of one question: Is it good for me? Hence, good and evil are judged not by their objective reality, but by the way we perceive them as fitting into our private universe or not.""We must be able to comprehend Will's universe, how it got constructed, and why. What keeps this universe together, working, and why? If unrecognizable, try to grasp Keating's sketch above as something incredibly real that paralyzes the lives of countless individuals. To see this come alive in a screenplay is quite remarkable. No doubt, Gus Van Sant must be given the credit for his directing the incredible performances we see by the cast. Sit and enter into the anguish and the difficulty facing Will at each step towards discovery and healing. It might take several viewings to achieve the full impact.Lastly, I really hate vulgarity in movies. I find it rarely adds anything. Contrariwise, although the language and some situations may strike as being too offensive, I think in this case, it's a real part of the movie. Bear with it and you will not regret it. See it as part of that for which Will is hunting. Of course, parental discretion is strongly advised and takes precedence over any recommendation of mine.",5,"An On-Screen Step to Unraveling ""The Human Condition""",1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,4049,"['Begin', 'name', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'find', 'are', 'number', 'ways', 'can', 'be', 'unpacked', 'producing', 'different', 'meaning', 'can', 'describe', 'plot', 'movie', 'different', 'angle', 'certainly', 'hunting', 'taking', 'place', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'hunting', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'genius', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'genius', 'inner', 'world', 'more', 'basic', 'primitive', 'securities', 'aspect', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'perspective', 'therefore', 'what', 'safe', 'life', 'janitor', 'MIT', 'beer-swiller', 'thug', 'step', 'prison', 'feed', 'off', 'inner-storm', 'rage', 'left', 'childhood', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'psychoanalyst', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'South', 'Boston', 'best', 'friend', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'true', 'love', 'sorely', 'needed', 'found', 'do', 'part', 'participating', 'hunt', 'must', 'start', 'given', 'are', 'looking', 'happiness', 'Many', 'times', 'are', 'looking', 'wrong', 'places', 'condition', 'struggle', 'see', 'Will', 'something', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'described', 'better', 'more', 'concisely', 'Thomas', 'Keating', 'work', 'Human', 'Condition', 'Contemplation', 'Transformation', 'Wit', 'Lectures-Harvard', 'Divinity', 'School', 'excerpted', 'pp', '13-14', 'days', 'sweeping', 'dysfunction', 'families', 'not', 'uncommon', 'hard', 'recognize', 'have', 'been', 'process', 'being', 'born', 'entering', 'world', 'three', 'essential', 'biological', 'needs', 'security', 'survival', 'power', 'control', 'affection', 'esteem', 'three', 'instinctual', 'needs', 'are', 'have', 'build', 'program', 'happiness', 'result', 'object', 'entering', 'universe', 'person', 'event', 'judged', 'basis', 'can', 'provide', 'what', 'believe', 'demand', 'happiness', 'be', 'Children', 'who', 'are', 'deprived', 'security', 'affection', 'control', 'needs', 'develop', 'desperate', 'drive', 'find', 'more', 'more', 'symbols', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'culture', 'called', 'compensation', 'can', 'also', 'happen', 'when', 'experiences', 'early', 'childhood', 'are', 'unbearable', 'are', 'repressed', 'unconscious', 'body', 'be', 'kind', 'warehouse', 'experiences', 'whole', 'lives', 'are', 'recorded', 'Here', 'then', 'beginning', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'addictive', 'process', 'need', 'hide', 'pain', 'suffered', 'early', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'face', 'repress', 'unconscious', 'provide', 'apparent', 'freedom', 'pain', 'develop', 'compensatory', 'processes', 'access', 'forms', 'pleasure', 'offset', 'pain', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'prepared', 'face', 'are', 'thrust', 'circumstances', 'position', 'developing', 'homemade', 'self', 'not', 'conform', 'reality', 'Everything', 'entering', 'world', 'survival', 'security', 'affection', 'esteem', 'power', 'control', 'chief', 'pursuits', 'happiness', 'be', 'judged', 'basis', 'one', 'question', 'good', 'Hence', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'judged', 'not', 'objective', 'reality', 'way', 'perceive', 'fitting', 'private', 'universe', 'not', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'comprehend', 'Will', 'universe', 'how', 'got', 'constructed', 'why', 'What', 'universe', 'together', 'working', 'why', 'unrecognizable', 'try', 'grasp', 'Keating', 'sketch', 'something', 'incredibly', 'real', 'lives', 'countless', 'individuals', 'see', 'come', 'alive', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'doubt', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'directing', 'incredible', 'performances', 'see', 'cast', 'Sit', 'enter', 'anguish', 'difficulty', 'facing', 'Will', 'step', 'towards', 'discovery', 'healing', 'might', 'take', 'several', 'viewings', 'achieve', 'full', 'impact.Lastly', 'really', 'hate', 'vulgarity', 'movies', 'find', 'rarely', 'anything', 'Contrariwise', 'language', 'situations', 'may', 'strike', 'being', 'too', 'offensive', 'think', 'case', 'real', 'part', 'movie', 'Bear', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'See', 'part', 'Will', 'hunting', 'course', 'parental', 'discretion', 'strongly', 'advised', 'precedence', 'recommendation', 'mine']",Good Will Hunting

Mathematics is one area where prodigies appear so that aspect of the story is plausible. Hunting is working as a janitor at MIT when he rather casually solves a difficult math problem that Professor Gerald Lambeau has posed to his students. Will's past has been a difficult one, as a youth he bounced from foster home to foster home and was abused. He has had several run-ins with the law and so it appears that his mathematical talent will remain untapped.Robin Williams plays a rather unusual psychology professor named Sean Maguire and turned in the best performance in the movie. Despite early setbacks in the counseling relationship between Will and Maguire, Will is able to come to grips with his prodigious talents and troubled past and embarks on what is hopefully a brilliant career. The movie is also about the role of friendship, Ben Affleck plays Will Hunting's boyhood friend that still plays a major role in his life yet understands that the best thing for Will would be for them to part. This realism on the part of the Affleck character and Sean Maguire helps Will to reach an understanding with himself and embark on what should be his true path.Written by the stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, that itself is one of the wonderful true stories of life.

It was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win two: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Williams).  The plot, written by Damon and Affleck, is brilliant.  It wonderfully despicts the dramatic side of recovery while adding some interesting wit in the perfect scenes.  However, the wit never interrupts or overlaps the dramatic events.  Director Gus Van Zant leads the cast and crew to accomplish this masterpiece beautifully.  The chain of events always contain the perfect emotional background that keeps audiences watching closely.  It later becomes more than just a secret math genius recovering from a painful childhood.  The other plots combined with it offers a deeper understanding behind the main plots, namely the therapist's reflecting his wife's death and Will Hunting falling in love.  Such level of drama keeps the intensity intact in the raging scenes.  Unfortunately, Damon and Affleck have yet to release their follow-up screenplay.Matt Damon and Minnie Driver earned an Oscar nomination for their performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  Damon seemed made for that role.  As with Robin Williams, they desplict their character's emotions and turbulances to the fullest, offering audiences a more emotional feel.

81218,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,0788814664,David M. Lovin,"[3, 6]","Good Will Hunting is a great character study.  There is really no plot to speak of, because the characters in the film, all of them, are kind of in limbo.  No one is going anywhere.  In fact, that probably is the story because one of the characters has the ability to go all the way to the top and the fact that he does not care is frustrating to all the other characters in the film.That character is Will Hunting, played expertly by Matt Damon.  He is a janitor at MIT who sees a difficult math problem on a chalkboard outside a lecture hall and solves it as easily as you or I would add a column of numbers together.  The problem had been put there by a professor (Stellan Skarsgard) who challenged his entire class to try to solve it by the end of the semester.Will is a math genius, like Mozart on the piano or Bobby Fischer in chess.  What normal people find impossible in math, he sees with complete ease.  This opening scene at the university lets us see this side of Will before we see his other side- the side including his past and his temperment.  He is a troubled man with a tough past.  He spends his free time drinking with his friends (including real life best friend Ben Affleck, with whom he wrote this script) and getting into fights.  He has made many trips to the local courtrooms.Eventually, Skarsgard gets &quot;custody&quot; of him in exchange for Will not going to jail.  In return, Will will have to attend counseling sessions and work with Skarsgard on mathematical problems.  We are introduced in the course of the film to two other characters who will play critical roles- Robin Williams as a psychiatrist and Minnie Driver who may become a love interest.This is a great performance by Damon, who gives us a complex character full of flaws and tough as nails.  He allows us to watch him soften up as he learns a lot of life's lessons from people who truly care about him.  We realize that this may be the first time in his life where that is the case.  The film is not about any particular story, just a young man who is learning to trust life and the people who love him",4,"Your move, chief",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,2100,"['Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'really', 'plot', 'speak', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'kind', 'limbo', 'one', 'going', 'anywhere', 'fact', 'probably', 'story', 'one', 'characters', 'ability', 'go', 'way', 'top', 'fact', 'not', 'care', 'frustrating', 'other', 'characters', 'film.That', 'character', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'played', 'expertly', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'janitor', 'MIT', 'who', 'difficult', 'math', 'problem', 'chalkboard', 'lecture', 'hall', 'as', 'easily', 'would', 'add', 'column', 'numbers', 'together', 'problem', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'professor', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'challenged', 'entire', 'class', 'try', 'solve', 'end', 'semester.Will', 'math', 'genius', 'Mozart', 'piano', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'chess', 'What', 'normal', 'people', 'find', 'impossible', 'math', 'complete', 'ease', 'opening', 'scene', 'university', 'see', 'side', 'Will', 'see', 'other', 'side-', 'side', 'including', 'past', 'temperment', 'troubled', 'man', 'tough', 'past', 'free', 'time', 'drinking', 'friends', 'including', 'real', 'life', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'whom', 'wrote', 'script', 'getting', 'fights', 'made', 'many', 'trips', 'local', 'courtrooms.Eventually', 'Skarsgard', 'quot', 'custody', 'quot', 'exchange', 'Will', 'not', 'going', 'jail', 'return', 'Will', 'will', 'have', 'attend', 'counseling', 'sessions', 'work', 'Skarsgard', 'mathematical', 'problems', 'are', 'introduced', 'course', 'film', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'play', 'critical', 'roles-', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'psychiatrist', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'may', 'become', 'love', 'interest.This', 'great', 'performance', 'Damon', 'who', 'complex', 'character', 'full', 'flaws', 'tough', 'nails', 'watch', 'soften', 'up', 'lot', 'life', 'lessons', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'care', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'where', 'case', 'film', 'not', 'particular', 'story', 'just', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'learning', 'trust', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'love']",Good Will Hunting

Matt Damon does an outstanding job, as do Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver.The film presents the classic troubled protagonist. Trust me, I've been there, so I appreciate Damon's character. I think the scene near the end of the film where Affleck finally challenges Damon to use his genius it great. Finally, his own brethren lay it on the line, and Damon finally realizes his potential. That's what it's all about.My only complaint is the slightly political undercurrent which lurks throughout the film. The scene where Damon rebuffs the NSA is especially irritating, as though the NSA is just a bunch of mathematicians seeking to screw over African villagers. Trust me, it goes far deeper than that. You all sleep comfortably at night thanks in no small part to the NSA. So unprokovoked attacks on the NSA rub me the wrong way.That aside, the film is still quite good.

81220,A23GFTVIETX7DS,0788814664,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[34, 48]","This quiet drama about what genius means was the surprise hit of 1997, with friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both collaborating on the screenplay and acting.  Damon plays Will Hunting, a troubled, gruff young man who works as a janitor at MIT despite his incredible self-education and intelligence.  When a mathematics professor discovers that Will has solved a complicated problem left on the blackboard, he pursues Will as a potential prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  But Will is not good with authority figures, as his past includes abuse at the hands of his father. When Will lands in jail, however, and the professor manages to obtain his release with the stipulation that Will work on mathematics with him and see a counselor, Will's whole life begins to open up.  As a patient of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will forges a relationship that acts as a catalyst for a new future.Matt Damon does a wonderful job with the title role, although at times he seems a little wooden.  As the therapist with a painful history that Will eventually connects with, Robin Williams turns in one of his less flamboyant performances.  His suffering is palpable, and his need to save Will from himself lends real passion to the film.  Affleck provides solid balance as Will's friend Chuckie, although his performance is less memorable than the other two, more of a function of the role than the actor.  Minnie Driver is charming and believable as Will's new girlfriend Skylar.The screenplay is intelligent and skillfully developed despite some unbelievable facets of the premise, most notably that such a wounded individual, no matter how bright, would have the discipline to teach himself as much as Will knows.  Still, this movie only gets better as it progresses.  The relationship between Will and his therapist is dynamic, poignant, and meaningful.This is a good film to own, as it uncovers additional subtleties on second viewing, as long as you don't mind revisiting emotional angst.  Its feel-good story arc is somewhat predictable, but the dialogue and interactions are not, making this flick surprisingly complex given the young ages of Damon and Affleck when it was made.",4,A drama with emotional depth,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2178,"['quiet', 'drama', 'what', 'genius', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', '1997', 'friends', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'collaborating', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'Damon', 'plays', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'troubled', 'gruff', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'janitor', 'MIT', 'incredible', 'self-education', 'intelligence', 'When', 'mathematics', 'professor', 'discovers', 'Will', 'solved', 'complicated', 'problem', 'left', 'blackboard', 'Will', 'potential', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Will', 'not', 'good', 'authority', 'figures', 'past', 'abuse', 'hands', 'father', 'When', 'Will', 'jail', 'however', 'professor', 'obtain', 'release', 'stipulation', 'Will', 'work', 'mathematics', 'see', 'counselor', 'Will', 'whole', 'life', 'open', 'up', 'patient', 'psychologist', 'Sean', 'Maguire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Will', 'relationship', 'catalyst', 'new', 'future.Matt', 'Damon', 'wonderful', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'times', 'little', 'wooden', 'therapist', 'painful', 'history', 'Will', 'eventually', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'one', 'less', 'flamboyant', 'performances', 'suffering', 'palpable', 'need', 'save', 'Will', 'real', 'passion', 'film', 'Affleck', 'solid', 'balance', 'Will', 'friend', 'Chuckie', 'performance', 'less', 'memorable', 'other', 'two', 'more', 'function', 'role', 'actor', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'charming', 'believable', 'Will', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Skylar.The', 'screenplay', 'intelligent', 'skillfully', 'developed', 'unbelievable', 'facets', 'premise', 'most', 'notably', 'wounded', 'individual', 'matter', 'how', 'bright', 'would', 'have', 'discipline', 'teach', 'as', 'much', 'Will', 'Still', 'movie', 'only', 'better', 'relationship', 'Will', 'therapist', 'dynamic', 'poignant', 'meaningful.This', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'additional', 'subtleties', 'second', 'viewing', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'revisiting', 'emotional', 'angst', 'feel-good', 'story', 'arc', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'interactions', 'are', 'not', 'making', 'flick', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'given', 'young', 'ages', 'Damon', 'Affleck', 'when', 'was', 'made']",Good Will Hunting
81221,A1ZU731IFILMV4,0788814664,"Demonic Kelvin ""Dark""","[6, 7]","Good Will Hunting is one of the best movie I've ever seen and I just can't forget how terrific it is. The story of this movie is extremely well-written and the movie itself is very well-acted by great actors such as Robin William, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and many more. I can really feel the emotions when I was watching the movie because the actors, especially William and Damon have shown remarkable efforts to make their character more appealing through their outstanding performence in the role each of them played.The story relates about an orphan kid, Will Hunting(Matt Damon) who was brought up in foster families and had bitter experience of abusement by his foster fathers during his childhood age. He grew up in a state of being abandoned and therefore, he's always afraid of being rejected by other people. Now, he has grown up with terrible characteristics. He's been charged several times for assault and other crimes. He often goofs around with his friends who happen to be pricks and this made his life looks pathetic.BUT, he's very gifted in academic. This is because he prefers to read in the library. He rather to read on his own  than studying in some unecessary overspending bucks universities(that's what he thinks). His talent in mathematic is noticed by a professor(Prof. Lambeau) in the university where he's working as a janitor. Will managed to solve a mathematical teorem about calculus on a board written by Lambeau where no any other brilliant student could in that university.Lambeau is having hard time finding who's the mystery guy who solved the teorem. He bailed Will from jail(charged on assault) when he finds out that Will is the person. Lambeau wishes to lead Will to the correct path and brighter future of his life and so, he brings Will to meet a few shrinks to give him counselling sessions. Unfortunately, no one managed to handle the wild-charactered Will till he brings him to meet his college friend, Dr. Sean (Robin William)who happen to be a counsellor. Although Will is wild, but Sean be very patient with him because he knows that he will eventually reaches Will's heart of hearts. Finally, he did. Because both of them have quite a similar childhood experience, they managed to communicate with each other and get to talk about their own feeling. At the end, Sean succeeded to enlighten Will's mind and he has changed from a spoiled brat to a rational thinker. He then realized what's important for his life.The ending is sweet where Will is after his love life where he  rejected at first and heading to find his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the relation between Lambeau and Sean which is bitter at first turned out to be better at the end. The ending is very nice and complete for such a movie. If anyone watches this movie carefully and attentionly, they will find a few messages that this movie brings is very EDUCATIONAL and could be taken as lessons for us nowadays.After watching this movie, I feel that Robin William truly deserves his Oscar for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR and Damon and Affleck indeed deserve their Oscar for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY for the movie in 1998. The other elements in this movie such as sounds, musics, cinematography and a few more are also very wonderful. I feel that it's just very very unlucky for this movie to be competing against Titanic(1997) in that year for several Oscar's categories nomination for the winner.

I am surprised anyone would put up with his attitude for even one day. Will Hunting's fatal flaw is that he had a traumatic childhood. Poor baby, do you want your pacifier? And then comes in the annoying, all-knowing, wise guru, Robin Williams, in another usually annoying role (similar to the one in 'Dead Poet's Society). He thinks he can help Will Hunting, but there are many scenes where they just sit there and nothing happens. Even in the scenes where they do talk, its a bunch of nonsense anyway. To me, the character played by Matt Deamon was really implausable.  He seems to be genius in many different areas; not only is he a math genius, he can read books with stunning speed and accuracy.  He can read entire pages just in a manner of seconds.  He is also a master psychologist, he can figure out people's psychological dispositions just by having one converstion with them.  He is also a expert historian.  Did I mention that his character can levitate in the air?  Oh, I'm sorry, he can't do that.

And yes, GOOD WILL HUNTING made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck instant mega-stars (and a much-deserved Oscar for best original screenplay).  And finally, we all know the basic story of GOOD WILL HUNTING:  A Boston bad boy who happens to be a closet genius finally accepts his problematic self only after a series of intense sessions with a damaged therapist who's been through his own inner hell.  Yet as familiar as I am with this incredible movie, I always look forward to watching it again; when you see such a superbly acted, beautifully crafted film (kudos to director Gus Van Sant) that touches so many core emotions as GOOD WILL HUNTING, you can never watch such a film enough.What a cast.  Damon.  Affleck.  Minnie Driver.  Ben's kid brother Casey.  Stellan Skarsgard as the MIT prof who (tries) to mentor young Will Hunting.  Cole Hauser (who rounds out the gang of four Boston rowdies).  And Robin Williams (another much-deserved Oscar).  Playing therapist Sean Maguire, a burned out junior college professor who is Will's last resort to obtain therapy and avoid jail, Williams gives the performance of his career, in my humble opine.  (He's also one hairy beast, but I digress.)  We're used to seeing Williams as an ADD madcap bouncing out of control, but here we see the constant pain of a man in his own turmoil as Williams portrays a very damaged Maguire who has the instinct and recognition to touch the right buttons that finally draw Will out of his facade and talk about what's been a most difficult, painful life.  The ""breakthrough"" moment is spellbinding, culminating in Will's final decision about what to do with his life that will leave a warm smile on your face.

Damon is one of those very few good-looking, youthful male actors who has a credible screen presence and can actually act!  In that way, he might be the antithesis of Keanu Reeves.  Anyway, aside from Damon, we also get Robin Williams in perhaps his greatest mentor role since &quot;Dead Poets Society.&quot;Damon plays a precocious (to say the least) adolescent, Will, who possesses an intellect that is advanced far beyond his modest age.  Williams portrays a psychologist who is trying to steer Damon in the right direction.  As intelligent as our Good Will is, it becomes readily apparent that his emotional state needs help to catch up to his mental prowess.In the meantime, there is an MIT mathematics professor (played by Stellan Skarsgrd) who is a kind of  counter-balance to Williams' character.  Here is a brilliant, accomplished pedagogue who teaches at one of the most prestigious academic institutions on the planet.  He's a man who has earned the Fields Medal (Mathematicians version of the Nobel Prize) and is used to looking at people with an aloof air of superiority.  Enter Will, and all of a sudden he is humbled, realizing that his cerebral aptitude is dwarfed by this youth who seems to have come out of nowhere.  Throughout the movie, the mathematician &amp; the psychologist play this game of tug-of-war, attempting to pull poor Will in two different directions.The scene in the bar where Will shows-up the snobby Harvard sociology student is an absolute all-time classic.  And I mean a classic of ALL movie history.  It is especially hilarious &amp; poignant as all of us have known people like the Harvard snob.  Although the rest of the movie is well-worth seeing, this scene by itself is worth the price of renting (or even buying) this DVD.The one flaw in this movie is that the script is a bit weak @ times.  They seem to rely on the &quot;F&quot; word too much for dramatic effect.  Now, I have no problem with them using the &quot;F&quot; word.  It's just that it gets a bit redundant after the 500th time.

81236,AKZMP6OOE89GV,0788814664,Elite14,"[2, 3]","Good Will Hunting may be the best movie I have ever seen. I have said that for years, and I mean it. It has a great script, brilliant acting (even though Ben Affleck is in it), and great direction. There are few movies that can get by on mostly dialogue alone. Kevin Smith's movies can do that. He was a producer on this movie, by the way. But, most movies that make 100 million are special effects flicks that cost almost that much to make. This movie is different.This is a story about Will Hunting (Matt Damon). He is a genius. In every sense of the word. He knows more about math than most people can imagine. He is only 20 and spends most of his time getting drunk with his buddies and getting into trouble. One day while working as a janitor at a prestigous college, he solves a math problem that the profressor (Stellen Skarsgard) has put on a chalk board in the hallway &amp; is hoping that one of his students can solve it by the end of the semester. Will then solves it while he mopping the hallway. Then the profressor puts up another problem, and while Will is in the middle of solving it, he gets caught. Then he runs off, quits the job, goes &amp; gets drunk with his buddies, gets into a fight, &amp; assaults an officer. That math professor then comes to bail him out, but only on one condition. Will has to work with him on math &amp; he wants will to be his prodigy, in a way. By court order, Will also has to see a pychology professor. And this is where the movie really kicks in.Robin Williams plays the psychology professor. He and Will don't really get along at first, but Will likes him. They eventually end up trusting each other and form a very good friendship. This is where the core of the movie lies. The dialogue between the two is amazing. They bounce &amp; play of each other perfectly. The professor is trying to get Will to open up about his problems he has had and make him a better person. All the while trying to hold the math professor at bay and let Will make up his own mind. Will is a troubled youth. He is a genius and he knows it, but he wastes it and hides behind it. He evetually meets a nice girl (Minnie Driver), but he pushes her away eventually, as well. The only people he doesn't try to push away are his three best friends (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck &amp; Cole Hauser). They don't challenge him, but he likes them around.I was shocked when I watched this and then thought about the fact that Damon &amp; Affleck wrote this movie. I couldn't believe it. And it's clear who is the better actor of the two, as well. Damon shines in his first lead role &amp; this is the movie that got him noticed. Affleck was a no-name at the time and between this &amp; 'Chasing Amy'(Kevin Smith movie) he is now who he is today. Robin Williams recieved a much deserved 'Best Supporting Actor' award for this. He is abosolutely amazing. Basically, when this came out, I wasn't too hyped to go see it. After I saw it the first time, my jaw was on the floor. This is an amazing movie that everyone should take the time to see. It's worth every penny you pay for it and it's a movie you and your girlfriend (or even buddies) can watch.The special features are pretty decent. Most of it came from the laserdisc. You get a commentary track from director Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, &amp; Ben Affleck. There are 11 deleted scenes, a production featurette, trailer, tv commercials, a music video, &amp; some behind the scenes footage. Not bad, but I would have liked a better featurette. Basically if not for the commentary &amp; the deleted scenes, the supplements wouldn't be very good.",5,One of the best films I have ever seen........,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,3613,"['Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'said', 'years', 'mean', 'great', 'script', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'even', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'great', 'direction', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'get', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'was', 'producer', 'movie', 'way', 'most', 'movies', 'make', '100', 'million', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'flicks', 'cost', 'almost', 'that', 'much', 'make', 'movie', 'different.This', 'story', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'genius', 'sense', 'word', 'more', 'math', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'imagine', 'only', '20', 'most', 'time', 'getting', 'drunk', 'buddies', 'getting', 'trouble', 'One', 'day', 'working', 'janitor', 'prestigous', 'college', 'math', 'problem', 'profressor', 'Stellen', 'Skarsgard', 'put', 'chalk', 'board', 'hallway', 'amp', 'hoping', 'one', 'students', 'can', 'solve', 'end', 'semester', 'Will', 'then', 'solves', 'mopping', 'hallway', 'Then', 'profressor', 'up', 'problem', 'Will', 'middle', 'solving', 'caught', 'Then', 'job', 'amp', 'drunk', 'buddies', 'fight', 'amp', 'officer', 'math', 'professor', 'then', 'bail', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'condition', 'Will', 'work', 'math', 'amp', 'will', 'be', 'prodigy', 'way', 'court', 'order', 'Will', 'also', 'see', 'pychology', 'professor', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'in.Robin', 'Williams', 'psychology', 'professor', 'Will', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'along', 'first', 'Will', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'trusting', 'other', 'form', 'very', 'good', 'friendship', 'where', 'core', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'two', 'amazing', 'bounce', 'amp', 'play', 'other', 'perfectly', 'professor', 'trying', 'get', 'Will', 'open', 'up', 'problems', 'had', 'make', 'better', 'person', 'while', 'trying', 'hold', 'math', 'professor', 'bay', 'let', 'Will', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Will', 'troubled', 'youth', 'genius', 'evetually', 'nice', 'girl', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'away', 'eventually', 'well', 'only', 'people', ""n't"", 'try', 'push', 'away', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'amp', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'do', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'around.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'watched', 'then', 'thought', 'fact', 'Damon', 'amp', 'Affleck', 'wrote', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'clear', 'who', 'better', 'actor', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'Damon', 'shines', 'first', 'lead', 'role', 'amp', 'movie', 'got', 'noticed', 'Affleck', 'was', 'no-name', 'time', 'amp', ""'Chasing"", 'Amy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', 'now', 'who', 'today', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'recieved', 'much', 'deserved', ""'Best"", 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'award', 'abosolutely', 'amazing', 'Basically', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'hyped', 'go', 'see', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'jaw', 'was', 'floor', 'amazing', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'worth', 'penny', 'pay', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'buddies', 'can', 'watch.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Most', 'came', 'laserdisc', 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'amp', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'are', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'production', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'tv', 'commercials', 'music', 'video', 'amp', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Not', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'featurette', 'Basically', 'not', 'commentary', 'amp', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'supplements', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'good']",Good Will Hunting

Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a  kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided  him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating  character study of a very complex and dynamic young man.Will is  discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head  of the math department at MIT.  This throws his life into turmoil, as the  mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy.  He also begins seeing a  therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions  and experiences he had been repressing.  The effect this has on him, and  his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing  tale.The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for  which they won an Academy Award (the film was nominated for nine).  Both  were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a  rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.  Damon was outstanding in the  lead.  He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was  phenomenal.  Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he  also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent.  He was able  to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.  Robin  Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best  supporting Oscar.It is hard not to like this film.  Most of the  challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to  overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.  I rated this  film a 9/10.

Considering the brouhaha this film earned from the critics and awards circles, nevermind all the attention young authors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck earned over the saga they underwent to see the film get made, you would think this DVD would be packed with some of that behind-the-scenes stuff.  Not to say the DVD is bare--by no means.  A rare, telling video of Oscar-nominated songwriter, Elliot Smith, singing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; was worth the extra money for the edition.  However, to be a &quot;collector's&quot; incentive item, it doesn't have much more to it.The film itself is clearly transfered, though I would have liked the sound to have been cleaned up a bit.  Some of the bar scenes have just never sounded clear no matter what, and the dialogue gets muddled in the mix.Storywise, if you don't know the tale of the M.I.T. janitor genius wonderboy and his gang of average joe hooligans, then you've had your head in the sand since 1997.  Without getting into it further, I will tell you the story is a moving one, and though heavily peppered with foul language, even younger teens will benefit from seeing the struggle of someone so bright yet so crippled.  Universal truths will be seen widely by all who see the story.This Oscar winning film deserved more on its disc.  A commentary with director Gus Van Zant and the writing duo is included, which sounds like three guys hanging out with a pizza and a six pack--laid back--just like the story.This edition isn't much costlier than the other &quot;regular&quot; version.

It has most of its elements, indeed, still director Gus Van Sant is able to make it work without falling into some easy traps and melodramatic common-places.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, apparently a young loser who hasn`t a bright future ahead of him. Yet, as he soon discovers, Will is in fact a bright, highly gifted youngster with an uncommon talent to maths. The plot is rich enough to showcase his growing process and further development, even if occasional predictable scenes unfold.Van Sant suceeds in delivering an enticing and poignant story about self-discovery, isolation, friendship and communication, yet it seems to gets dangerously close to Hollywood fluff in a couple of moments (just close, as it never becomes truly cutesy or embarassing).The acting also helps a little to make the effort work, since besides Damon it includes convincing performances from Robbin Williams, Minnie Driver and Ben and Casey Affleck. The soundtrack is a plus, too, including Danny Elfman and indie talents like Elliot Smith, the Dandy Warhols or Luscious Jackson.&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a solid, consistent movie worth watching, yet it is far from being a milestone or a work of genius.

81256,A38NMDZZCN1WFP,0788814664,Hume An,"[6, 7]","There have been several great films that focused on the life of one boy genius.  Rushmore, Little Man Tate, and Searching for Bobby Fischer are prime examples.  These three movies did three very important things. First,  each one looked at the child genius with sensitivity, doing an excellent  job of focusing on the tenuous aspects of childhood, while attempting to  fathom and apprehend the child's genius.  Two, the films show that these  geniuses are, foremost, human beings who have the same basic, fundamental  needs all humans have--the need for love, contact, undertanding,  friendship, and intimacy.  And three, they show that ultimately, what makes  a human being special is not how smart, talented, or exceptional he is, but  how he conducts his life in relation to his fellow human beings and how  compassionate and caring he is.  Needless to say, these films are exemplars  of their genre.  And Goodwill Hunting is their peer.Will Hunting is a  genius, not on the order of an MIT student, but on the order of Einstein,  Mozart, Shakespeare.  On the surface, Will comes off as tough, rough, cool.  He is good looking, fast-talking, and seemingly brimming with confidence.  When forced into therapy by court order, Will aviscerates his therapists  with a mixture of brashness, brilliance, and utter lack of respect.  While  being a genius, he is also a miscreant who commits petty thefts and  assaults in his spare time.  He is a strange mix of savant and savage.  Underneath the outward manifestation of his genius, underneath his  rebellious nature and irreverence is a scared kid in need of compassion and  human connection. And that is what Goodwill Hunting is essentially  about--one boy's attempt to make human contact after bearing years of  mental, emotional, and physical abuse.The genius aspect of Will is  almost ancillary, but is important because it allows another important  message to be sent--great intelligence does not designate a person as  great.  This message is sent home in many ways throughout the movie, but is  most aptly illustrated when Will embarrasses a pompous Harvard boy in a  debate. This scene was definitely one of the most gratifying scenes on  film.In sum, Goodwill Hunting is a very good film.  It is funny,  humane, uplifting, and touching.  The acting is very strong, the writing is  very good, and the character of Will is complex, smart, snide, vulnerable,  and highly likable.  If you like films that make you feel excited about  being human, then watch this film.  If you want something a bit more  commercial, watch Titanic.",5,a great film from a line of great films about boy geniuses,955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,2582,"['have', 'been', 'several', 'great', 'films', 'focused', 'life', 'one', 'boy', 'genius', 'Rushmore', 'Little', 'Man', 'Tate', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'three', 'movies', 'did', 'three', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'First', 'one', 'looked', 'child', 'genius', 'sensitivity', 'doing', 'excellent', 'job', 'focusing', 'tenuous', 'aspects', 'childhood', 'attempting', 'fathom', 'apprehend', 'child', 'genius', 'Two', 'films', 'show', 'geniuses', 'are', 'foremost', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'have', 'same', 'basic', 'fundamental', 'humans', 'have', 'need', 'love', 'contact', 'undertanding', 'friendship', 'intimacy', 'three', 'show', 'ultimately', 'what', 'human', 'being', 'special', 'not', 'how', 'smart', 'talented', 'exceptional', 'how', 'life', 'relation', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'how', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'Needless', 'say', 'films', 'are', 'exemplars', 'genre', 'Goodwill', 'Hunting', 'peer.Will', 'Hunting', 'genius', 'not', 'order', 'MIT', 'student', 'order', 'Einstein', 'Mozart', 'Shakespeare', 'surface', 'Will', 'off', 'tough', 'rough', 'cool', 'good', 'looking', 'fast-talking', 'seemingly', 'brimming', 'confidence', 'When', 'forced', 'therapy', 'court', 'order', 'Will', 'therapists', 'mixture', 'brashness', 'brilliance', 'utter', 'lack', 'respect', 'being', 'genius', 'also', 'miscreant', 'who', 'petty', 'thefts', 'assaults', 'spare', 'time', 'strange', 'mix', 'savant', 'savage', 'outward', 'manifestation', 'genius', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'irreverence', 'scared', 'kid', 'need', 'compassion', 'human', 'connection', 'what', 'Goodwill', 'Hunting', 'essentially', 'about', 'one', 'boy', 'attempt', 'make', 'human', 'contact', 'bearing', 'years', 'mental', 'emotional', 'physical', 'abuse.The', 'genius', 'aspect', 'Will', 'almost', 'ancillary', 'important', 'important', 'message', 'be', 'sent', 'great', 'intelligence', 'not', 'designate', 'person', 'great', 'message', 'sent', 'home', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'most', 'aptly', 'illustrated', 'when', 'Will', 'pompous', 'Harvard', 'boy', 'debate', 'scene', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'gratifying', 'scenes', 'film.In', 'sum', 'Goodwill', 'Hunting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'funny', 'humane', 'uplifting', 'touching', 'acting', 'very', 'strong', 'writing', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'Will', 'complex', 'smart', 'snide', 'vulnerable', 'highly', 'likable', 'like', 'films', 'make', 'feel', 'excited', 'being', 'human', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'commercial', 'watch', 'Titanic']",Good Will Hunting

But surprisingly this young duo was able to write a sophisticated script that, with the direction of Gus Van Sant, became an Academy Award winner.  Those awards, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay definitely show the movies strong points.  Unfortunately the acting is a little wooden and awkward at times, but is forgivable.Luckily this movie has great bonus features including my favorite, audio commentary with Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  Also included are 11 deleted scenes with audio commentary, production featurette, and ""Miss Misery"" music video.  In other words this DVD is loaded.Overall, with all the bonus material and sophisticated story this is definitely a great rental.

It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with an I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequencly, when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result?

Davis ""Jeffrey Matthew Davis""","[1, 6]","In case you haven't seen Good Will Hunting (it's OK...I hadn't seen it until 3 weeks ago), it tells the story of a poor Bostonian young man named Will, played by Matt Damon, who has had an incredibly turbulent life and whose social status prevents him from achieving something. Though Will is brilliant and should be attending a school like MIT, he mops its floors instead. After getting into some trouble with the law, a MIT professor who needs Will's help to solve a perplexing mathematical equation takes the young man under his wing and helps Will receive a lighter sentence, providing he goes to a therapist. After seeing many shrinks, Will finally meets with Sean, played by Robin Williams, who eventually guides and befriends the reluctant Will.Good Will Hunting is by far one of the most intelligent, well written films I've seen in a long time and it's quite deserving of its Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Moreover, Robin Williams shines as the psychologist who is struggling to battle his own feelings of loneliness and worthlessness after the passing of his wife, and Damon is incredible as the hard-edged genius at the core of the film. Minnie Driver is also very likable as Will's girlfriend who constantly tries to get him to open up without angering him in the process.Unfortunately, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend Chuckie is downright annoying. He tries to steal each scene he's in by screaming in his thick Boston accent or by stepping on the lines of other actors, but he fails to be compelling or interesting. I think I actually groaned every time he appeared on the screen.

81273,AMI0C2C9QS8U3,0788814664,j.,"[2, 4]","Believe it or not, there was actually a time when the now famed ""Good Will Hunting"" was just the little-movie-that-could.  When it was released in the late 90s, America was under the mighty ""Titanic"" spell, and any actors who weren't named Leonardo or Winslett basically got ignored.  In fact, for what it's worth, the film was not a major blockbuster by anyone's standards.  The director, Gus Van Sant, had somewhat of a cult following (thanks to previous movies such as ""My Own Private Idaho"") but little else. Matt Damon (who plays the lead) and Ben Affleck (who plays his friend) were still Hollywood mid-carders. The only thing the film had going for it on a marketing level was Robin Williams.But low and behold, audiences began to click with it.  Damon and Williams had an on-screen chemistry that rivaled Leo's and Kate's, and the screenplay (written by Damon and Affleck in college) was...well, brilliant (it eventually won an oscar).In case you don't know, the film is about a troubled Boston youth (Damon) who is from the wrong side of town but posesses  a brilliant photographic academic mind.  Damon eventually begins seeing Williams, a therapist, and the story goes from there.  The tone and theme are very academic and carpe-diem, similar to another Robin Williams film, ""Dead Poets Society,"" but with a more gritty edge. It also seems influenced by the classic Peter Schaffer play, Equus (probably a mere coincidence, though) in that the film straddles the theme of the therapist ultimately becoming the patient, and vice versa.The film has achieved somewhat legendary status among college students over the years as THE inspiring story about love, friendship, loyalty, and plunging into the real world. Whatever the case, if it wasn't for this movie, Damon and Affleck would most likely not be where they are today.  It was the oscar that they received that truly made Hollywood open its eyes to the duo.  It's a shame that they both seemed to have possibly peaked as far as creative energy is concerned.

I'm speaking of course about the one and only Good Will Hunting.  Matt Damon is Will Hunting. A janitor at MIT, he is a  man of brains, brawn and misdirection. One day while mopping the floors of  this &quot;bastion of knowledge&quot;, he discovers a contest in which a  student is required to proof a formula of finite mathematics. The story  takes a serious turn when this well- kept- secret of a genius is discovered  by one of the top professors in the university. The trouble with Will, is  that he has no desire to go around boasting  genius as do many of his  counterparts at the university. One day however, Hunting is forced to face  himself, for as he is thrown in jail, his only way out is through the  caring of the professor who discovered him. Now, Will has to make decisions  and think about painful subjects he never dared to face. As a condition of  his release, he must attend therapy in order to satisfy the requests of the  state. This would in the most unlikely way, change his life forever. Meet  Dr. Sean Maguire, a congenial but very direct shrink whom Will is assigned  to fulfill his therapy requirements with. But beyond the psychobabble and  bureaucratic intricacies of the state, the relationship between Hunting and  Maguire is one of pivotal proportions. It turns out Will Hunting and Sean  Maguire are both men holding back many a bottles full of anger and fistfuls  of pain. As the film progresses, the messages of life's challenges and  hurtles become crystal clear. There are more important things in life than  the everyday jumbles of feelings we get caught up in. And the only way to  discover them is to let go and take a chance. This is a genuine film about  release from our personal demons. In the end, Dr. Maguire and Mr. Hunting  help each other tear the other's walls of fear. Take it from me folks,  there is nothing more refreshing than seeing a film about battle-scarred  individuals venting their frustrations on one another in order to rise to a  higher lever of peace. This is a penetrating and lighthearted film which  surprises the viewer with its hilariously touching humor around every  corner. With a script that sounds so naturally spoken by the characters,  you would think this film was more about two ordinary people just sitting  around talking rather than delivering a written and rehearsed dialogue.  With its buffoonery, sensitivity and healing of the mind, Good Will Hunting  reinforces the idea that an uncommon story about an everyday hero is the  best way to evoke an audience response. This film is not only one of the  most effective I have ever seen, but it is one that should let us all know  that the things that are most common among the educated and uneducated  classes is,  we are all people with great capacities and with geniuses  hidden in both of our societies.

It is tight, farly seamless and flows nicely.One repeated criticism is that the movie bends credibility to believe that a genius could be a janitor. Tut tut. Your arrogance is showing.Everyone knows the plot by now so I don't feel I can add anything to the numerous details. What I recall as powerful was that I had never seen Matt Damon before, had never seen Robin Williams straight . . . .  errrrrrr in a straight role, and ditto Ben Afleck.Now I have to jump ahead for a second. I really got into Robert Ludlum and the wonderful tales he wrote in the 70's and 80's. ""Parsifal Mosaic"" has got to be the all-time, best romantic non-stop suspense book I ever read. And sandwiched on either side of books like PM, is the 'Bourne Trilogy.' And I have to tell you, as Jason, I always imagined someone like Damon. For this reviewer, Matt Damon is the perfect lead of the haunted multi lingual, amnesiac-assassin.So I recognize that at a minimum, Gus Van Sant, granted, an exceptional director, knew he had the real thing with Matt Damon and let him 'strut and fret his hour upon the stage.'Credit must also be given for calming Robin Williams down. Someone ought to tell Mr. Williams that by now he's a pretty good actor when he's not doing Henny Youngman.Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot Ben Afleck. There.Scenes? The calculus scene just rocks. Apples?

81301,A1JG9920BAIQTD,0788814664,Lauren,"[4, 5]","This movie is either perfect, or as close as it's possible for a movie to be. The acting is outstanding. The direction is terrific. The script is heartfelt and real. The soundtrack, featuring Elliot Smith, is perfectly suited to the movie. All in all, it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and it's my personal favorite.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor at MIT who harbors a secret genius for mathematics. Rather than bank on his intelligence, he spends most of his time riding around and drinking with his buddies (Ben Affleck, Cole Hauser, and a particularly funny and excellent Casey Affleck). However, his gift is discovered by a professor at the university (Stellan Skarsgard) who bails Will out of jail (in on a count of assault) on the conditions that he start doing math regularly with the professor and that he see a psychiatrist. Enter the psychiatrist, Sean (Robin Williams). To add to the mix, Will meets a Harvard student, Skylar (Minnie Driver) who is possibly the first woman for whom he's ever had real feelings. Over the course of the movie, all of these characters in their own way try to make Will live up to his potential.The movie doesn't have much of a plot other than this -- however, that's fine, because it's meant to be more of a character study and it's a great one. Pretty much every scene is two people sitting down talking to each other -- yet it holds the viewer's interest because the characters are so captivating. Sean and Will's scenes in particular are terrific. Matt Damon and Robin Williams, besides both being fine actors, have a natural chemistry that you just can't fake. Damon and Minnie Driver are also great together (of course, as it's widely known, the two dated during the filming of the movie) and it's my opinion that both were robbed of their Oscars.Ben Affleck shows that spark in this movie which he showed in most of his '90s movies, and he's great in his role -- but even better is his brother Casey. Watch the movie with the audio commentary, and you'll gain so much more appreciation for both the role of Morgan and the actor Casey. The same goes for Stellan Skarsgard. Cole Hauser is good with the few lines he has.All in all, this is a great movie -- beautifully shot, well-written . . . well, I've said it all before.

It's a near pitch-perfect film about believing in yourself and forgiving yourself.What's so great about this movie is that it ignores a lot of the conventions of American filmmaking at the time and focuses more on its characters, who are more introspective and thoughtful than they initially appear, in particular Affleck's Chucky, who's friendship with the title character is both loyal and unquestionable. What's also so wonderful about this film is that it isn't afraid to go where most movies don't, often having its characters say and do things that we all think yet don't act on. It's the smallest details that make this film so much fun to watch.The DVD itself is a great package, with feature length commentaries with the cast and crew, including director Gus van Sant and writer/stars Affleck and Damon (who won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film's script).

81309,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0788814664,magellan,"[4, 6]","I enjoyed this movie about a universal genius whose math talents and overall intelligence are truly stratospheric but who apparently has the social and emotional I.Q. of a senile aardvark with syphilitic paresis of the brain. (Actually, that's an insult to aadvarks who probably don't deserve to be compared to the anti-social and unsympathetic Matt Damon character :-)). We do learn in the movie that some of this excusable and understandable due to the abuse he's suffered at the hands of his father, but the naturally pugnacious Matt Damon character is unable to be civil even to those who have nothing but his best interests in mind, such as the eminent math professor who gets him out of jail, takes him under his wing, and personally tutors him, and the therapist, played by Robin Williams.When a romantic interest is introduced when a beautiful co-ed comes into his life, he manages to be avoid being a complete jerk for at least five minutes of the film. But of course their relationship doesn't work out at first and Will goes back to his old churlish, irresponsible, and wayward behavior, stops meeting with the math professor for advanced math lessons, and so on. Eventually, though, with Robin Williams's help, he comes to the realization that he wants to pursue the relationship with the girl, and leaves town to find her.We don't get to see how this relationship ultimately works out, but the movie ends on a positive note when he and the girl get back together. Perhaps in that sense the movie is an odd variation on the old theme of the good woman who takes in a strong but rough and uncouth man and finally gentles and civilizes him.I thought Damon and Williams were both excellent in their roles, and that overall it was an interesting concept for a movie that worked out pretty well despite the Matt Damon character basically being an almost completely unsympathetic one.By the way, a little academic and perhaps irrelevant footnote here. Despite the stereotype of people with high intelligence often being physically nerdy and socially inept and misfits, this is contradicted by psychological research. A long and detailed study done in the last century by the famous psychologist, Lewis Terman, at Stanford, showed that people with higher I.Q.s are taller, heavier, and better adjusted socially than those less gifted. So maybe you have to be a really off-the-charts Einsteinian brainiac type of genius like the Matt Damon character for that to happen. :-)",4,An old story in a new guise,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2477,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'universal', 'genius', 'math', 'talents', 'overall', 'intelligence', 'are', 'truly', 'stratospheric', 'who', 'apparently', 'social', 'emotional', 'I.Q', 'senile', 'aardvark', 'syphilitic', 'paresis', 'brain', 'Actually', 'insult', 'aadvarks', 'who', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'compared', 'anti-social', 'unsympathetic', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'do', 'learn', 'movie', 'excusable', 'understandable', 'due', 'abuse', 'suffered', 'hands', 'father', 'naturally', 'pugnacious', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'unable', 'be', 'civil', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'best', 'interests', 'mind', 'such', 'eminent', 'math', 'professor', 'who', 'jail', 'wing', 'personally', 'tutors', 'therapist', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams.When', 'romantic', 'interest', 'introduced', 'when', 'beautiful', 'co-ed', 'life', 'be', 'avoid', 'being', 'complete', 'jerk', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'course', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'first', 'Will', 'back', 'old', 'churlish', 'irresponsible', 'wayward', 'behavior', 'meeting', 'math', 'professor', 'advanced', 'math', 'lessons', 'so', 'Eventually', 'though', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'help', 'realization', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'girl', 'town', 'find', 'her.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'ultimately', 'out', 'movie', 'positive', 'note', 'when', 'girl', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Perhaps', 'sense', 'movie', 'odd', 'variation', 'old', 'theme', 'good', 'woman', 'who', 'strong', 'rough', 'uncouth', 'man', 'finally', 'gentles', 'civilizes', 'him.I', 'thought', 'Damon', 'Williams', 'were', 'excellent', 'roles', 'overall', 'was', 'interesting', 'concept', 'movie', 'worked', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'basically', 'being', 'almost', 'completely', 'unsympathetic', 'way', 'little', 'academic', 'perhaps', 'irrelevant', 'footnote', 'here', 'stereotype', 'people', 'high', 'intelligence', 'often', 'being', 'physically', 'nerdy', 'socially', 'inept', 'misfits', 'contradicted', 'psychological', 'research', 'long', 'detailed', 'study', 'done', 'last', 'century', 'famous', 'psychologist', 'Lewis', 'Terman', 'Stanford', 'showed', 'people', 'higher', 'I.Q.s', 'are', 'taller', 'heavier', 'better', 'adjusted', 'socially', 'less', 'gifted', 'So', 'maybe', 'have', 'be', 'really', 'off-the-charts', 'Einsteinian', 'brainiac', 'type', 'genius', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'happen']",Good Will Hunting

81312,A2NC5BMF6QWC5B,0788814664,Mark Laflamme,"[3, 4]","Had a friend once who snickered at my enthusiasm for this movie. The brainless cretin described it a ""chick flick"" and I had to give him a long winded explanation of why he was once more way off the beam.""Goodwill Hunting"" is a classic guy movie about guys who do guy things. Above all other story elements, this is a movie about boyhood friends and the uncompromising loyalty of those friendships. There are scenes here that should make you miss the buddies you turned of age with, those great friends who were there when you had your first drink, chased your first skirt and got into your first bar brawl.Will Hunting is a genius and that becomes the crux of the film. He is a genius, yes. But mostly, he is a young man with the typical frustrations and misgivings that come with the age. He has issues with girls, issues with the law, and issues with his own place in the world.This quickly became one of my all-time favorites because it is a movie with endless depth and substance. The story of the young punk with a criminal record outshining the rest of mathematical minds is compelling from the start. So is the attempt by the bedraggled but committed psychiatrist to reach the boy and the weird friendship that forms between them.South Boston serves as a beautiful and shabby backdrop as Hunting feels himself drifting away from his buddies as his genius gets more attention from the world of universities and prestige he is unfamiliar with. He wants to continue working construction and hanging out in the seedy bars with his friends, rather than have his fluke ability exploited by men with greedy ambitions and concerns over petty things like tenure.Matt Damon is stellar as the streetwise Hunting, an orphan with an attitude. Robin Williams leaves his goofiness behind and plays the aging psychiatrist who was once a tough young man just like the kid he is trying to help. While praising that pair, no one should overlook the talents of Ben Affleck, who was a credible actor before he started landing on the tabloid covers.The relationship between Damon and Affleck is powerful. The latter knows his childhood friend is bound for great things and prods him to achieve in that silent, macho way good friends have.""If you're still here in ten years, I'll kill you. That's not a threat, it's a fact. I'll freakin' kill you,"" Affleck says, as the two take time for a beer during lunch break at work. Because that is how good friends talk to each other when crucial matters are at hand.Watching as Hunting battle with himself as he ponders the idea of flying away from the tough but familiar streets he grew up on is only half the allure of this film.

After all, two young actor punks won Oscars for their screenplay - and considering this is a vanity project in the purest sense (they wrote it to give themselves some great roles), there's a strong urge to analyze the film rather than just watch it.But try to watch it and you'll see how strong it really is. Affleck and Damon have written an intelligent and engaging movie with some exceptionally moving and real moments. Williams is outstanding - few actors could deliver his key lines (and key silences) with the understated conviction he brings. Damon and Affleck, and their buddies, transcend the vanity project tag and really embody their characters. You're with them. You care about them. And so when the movie completes its rather conventional arc, you're happy that everything went pretty much the way you thought it would.Directed with an extremely perceptive and sensitive touch by Gus Van Sant, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; breaks no new ground, but it's not supposed to. It's an effective, simple, engaging character study with sharp performances.

About a shy, yet with an attitude, young man (who as we find out later was abused) who demonstrates his brilliance, but who will not let people get too close.  Ben Affleck (before all of this &quot;Bennifer&quot; nonsense) is good as his buddy, who really wants him to use his &quot;gift&quot;.  With an outstanding performance by Robin Williams (who deserved his award) and Minnie Driver, the lads have put together a funny, poignant, movie; which wasn't &quot;overdone&quot; as some movies might be.  Williams and Damon interact with each other with the right amount of &quot;attitude&quot; as they help each other overcome their fears, hopes, missed opportunities, and dreams.  A better film than I thought it would be.  I'd recommend it.  The downside (for peope offended by language, i.e., profanity, is that there is a lot of it, especially the &quot;F&quot; word).  If one can overlook that, if one's offended [I'm not overly so]; then, this movie speaks to the person inside all of us, as we ask ourselves some basic questions; what do we want out of life, do we have regrets, did we try hard enough to succeed, what does success mean, and so on.

I actually  agree with some of the legitimate criticism that this movie is predictable  and over wound up at the end.  The other criticism about how Will shouldn't  be a genius and that the film is generally &quot;trite&quot; seems like  silly prejudice.Take my perspective... I'm a young writer of screenplays  and saw the silly looking trailers for this movie written by two young  guys.  I was sort of furious on the inside that these two were being lauded  as great and I've never seen a Robin Williams movie that wasn't over  sentimental trash.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[11, 12]","""Good Will Hunting"" was one of the best films in 1997 thanks to a combination of excellent direction, brilliant writing and superb acting to create an engaging drama for the audience to embrace.  Being the first film ever written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, director Gus Van Sant (who also directed ""My Own Private Idaho"" in 1991 and ""To Die For"" in 1995), created a very plausible atmosphere for the unusual story to unfold:A young genius named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) never attended college, but read mathematical, scientific and literary books on his own for many years.  Severely abused as a child in an adoptive home, Will now prefers to exist as a manual laborer living in a condemned house in a dilapidated Boston neighborhood.  While working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) one night, he solves a heretofore unsolvable mathematical problem written on a classroom chalkboard.  The professor who originally transcribed the problem, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd), is shocked to find the problem solved but doesn't know who solved it.  He eventually finds Will, but Will was arrested and jailed for his involvement in a beating while on a night out with his best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), who is a true manual laborer.  Determined to save Will from himself, Gerald enlists the aid of a former friend & college roommate, Sean Maquire (Robin Williams), who now works as a community college psychology teacher, to provide psychological therapy for Will.  To be released from jail, Will agrees to regular counseling sessions with Sean and to work for Gerald.  The initial therapy sessions between Will and Sean are very intense (more so for Sean than for Will, as Will uses his genius to tear into Sean's core and has had a lot of previous psychotherapy experience), but Sean finds ways to work with him.  Complicating matters, a mutual attraction develops between Will and a female MIT student, Skylar (Minnie Driver).Though some that watch this film may be disturbed by the violence depicted when Will relentlessly beats a man, it helps to demonstrate how deeply troubled the character is. Other well acted supporting characters in the film include Morgan O'Mally (played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's younger brother) and Billy McBride (played by Cole Hauser).  Ben Affleck did a good job with his portrayal of Will's friend Chuckie.""Good Will Hunting"" earned Matt Damon and Ben Affleck the Oscar for Best Writing for a Screenplay and Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Other Oscar nominations received include Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Original Music, Best Song, Matt Damon for Best Actor, Minnie Driver for Best Supporting Actress and Gus Van Sant for Best Director.

Unfortunately that talent seems to be going to waste since Will works as a university janitor and spends the rest of his time getting drunk and into fights with his friends.One of the top math professors at the university puts up a math problem that he suspects maybe by the end of the semester, one student can solve.  He is surprised that it is immediately solved by an unknown ""student.""  To try to flush the student out, he and his collegues put together a problem that took them two years to solve.  He then sees the janitor scribbling on the board.  When he yells at the janitor and frightens him away, he is surprised to see that the ""scribble"" is in fact the answer to the problem.  This leads him on a search to find the mysterious janitor.

Ben Affleck is great as his best friend whose one wish is that when he goes to pick Will up at his house is that Will will not be home but instead he will have left to make something of his incredible talent.Robin Williams is excellent as the psychologist who tries to tame Will Hunting and who has to use patience and understanding to change someone who is like an intellectual god compared to him.Minnie Driver is excellent as Will's girlfriend, who loves Will but can never seem to get close enough to him because the main flaw in Will that causes him to be a failure in life is that he fears rejection so he avoids any type of situation that could cause this.",5,Great!,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1760,"['Will', 'Hunting', 'super', 'genious', 'who', 'along', 'maybe', 'few', 'times', 'century', 'Unfortunately', 'talent', 'be', 'going', 'waste', 'Will', 'university', 'janitor', 'rest', 'time', 'getting', 'drunk', 'fights', 'friends.One', 'top', 'math', 'professors', 'university', 'up', 'math', 'problem', 'maybe', 'end', 'semester', 'one', 'student', 'can', 'solve', 'surprised', 'immediately', 'solved', 'unknown', 'student', 'try', 'flush', 'student', 'out', 'collegues', 'put', 'together', 'problem', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'solve', 'then', 'janitor', 'scribbling', 'board', 'When', 'janitor', 'away', 'surprised', 'see', 'scribble', 'fact', 'answer', 'problem', 'search', 'find', 'mysterious', 'janitor', 'When', 'find', 'super', 'genious', 'be', 'tamed.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'Amadeus', 'John', 'Nash', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'great', 'super', 'genious', 'role', 'better', 'one', 'had', 'Rounders', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'great', 'best', 'friend', 'one', 'wish', 'when', 'pick', 'Will', 'up', 'house', 'Will', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'home', 'instead', 'will', 'have', 'left', 'make', 'something', 'incredible', 'talent.Robin', 'Williams', 'excellent', 'psychologist', 'who', 'tame', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'who', 'use', 'patience', 'understanding', 'change', 'someone', 'who', 'intellectual', 'god', 'compared', 'him.Minnie', 'Driver', 'excellent', 'Will', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'Will', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'main', 'flaw', 'Will', 'be', 'failure', 'life', 'rejection', 'type', 'situation', 'could', 'cause']",Good Will Hunting

81327,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0788814664,Mike Stone,"[10, 11]","This is a much more ambitious project than would appear at first glance.  Given the benefit of hindsight, it would seem like a no-brainer to let Ben and Matt try their hands at writing a buddy movie with lots of male bonding and weepy emotion.  But coming from two unknown commodities, it really is a startling achievement.Their script goes down several paths that seasoned scriptwriters don't dare tread, for if they are not done perfectly they tend to collapse like a house of cards on a waterbed.First, we get the working class buddies.  Affleck, his brother Casey, Cole Hauser, and Damon have wonderful and believable chemistry together as a bunch of South Boston wiseguys.  We see them cruising for burgers and chicks, picking fights, and going to work, with a habit of ease obviously built over years and years.  Later on, someone says of Affleck's character's relationship with Damon's: ""Chuckie's family, he'd lie down in...traffic for you.""  The line becomes superfluous, a validation of things we've already seen for ourselves.Second, we get the tortured genius/prodigy.  The credit here must be split in two places.  First, the script takes great pains in its authenticity.  Apparently the theorems that Will solves are as complex as portrayed, and are solved in the appropriate manner.  Most movie portrayals of genius tend to fudge that part of the equation, hoping that the audience is dumb enough to not recognize that the guitar virtuoso is not really playing the song (a problem that I found distracting in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"") or that the great writer's words are not up to snuff (as is the problem in director Van Sant's later film ""Finding Forrester"").  Second, Damon himself does a wonderful job in showing both the ease at which this math comes to him, and the coiled frustration that it burdens him with.Third, we get the mentors.  Stellan Skarsgard, as the mathematician who discovers Will, could have easily settled for being a two-dimensional villain.  But his Prof. Lambeau is believably flawed, and his displaced ambition never becomes cartoonish or unredeemably destructive.  Robin Williams, as the psychologist Will is court-ordered to see, manages nary a moment of his patented over-the-top showmanship.  Rather, his Sean is reserved, anguished, and powerful, but always in very subtle ways.  Williams does his best work portraying Sean's grief, calling it up in a matter-of-fact way until it needs to boil over and lash out to protect itself, as it does in his first scene with Will.  Their relationship ends up strengthening over time, culminating in one final scene of catharsis that if portrayed by lesser actors with a lesser script, would come across as schmaltzy, but here is very real and very moving.Fourth, we get the girl.  I remember when this movie first came out, Minnie Driver's character took a lot of flak for throwing herself so shamelessly at Will, who obviously wasn't capable at giving her anything back.  On looking at the movie again, it is astounding to me that this act of courage could be criticized so.  Her Skylar -- Driver does a wonderful job at portraying her joie de vivre, as well as her self-consciousness -- is set up for life, both in her education and in her finances, so she doesn't really need a hardship case like Will.  And yet she loves him, and repeatedly tells him so, knowing full well that he's not going to say it back.  Sure, for the most part it's borderline masochistic, and she puts herself through a needless amount of torture, but wouldn't an easier road be less satisfying?  And wouldn't a less complex character for boy genius Will to be confronted with just become easy prey?  Yes and yes, I say.These four items, combined with its flair for solid and sometimes flashy dialogue (""How do you like them apples?""), make up a wonderful film.  It makes good on all its promises, and manages to be entertaining, emotional, and assuredly worthwhile.",5,"Deceptively ambitous in concept, near perfect in execution",982627200,"02 20, 2001",2001,3943,"['much', 'more', 'ambitious', 'project', 'would', 'appear', 'first', 'glance', 'Given', 'benefit', 'hindsight', 'would', 'seem', 'no-brainer', 'let', 'Ben', 'Matt', 'try', 'hands', 'writing', 'buddy', 'movie', 'lots', 'male', 'bonding', 'weepy', 'emotion', 'coming', 'two', 'unknown', 'commodities', 'really', 'startling', 'achievement.Their', 'script', 'down', 'several', 'paths', 'seasoned', 'scriptwriters', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'tread', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'perfectly', 'tend', 'collapse', 'house', 'cards', 'waterbed.First', 'get', 'working', 'class', 'buddies', 'Affleck', 'brother', 'Casey', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Damon', 'have', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'together', 'bunch', 'South', 'Boston', 'wiseguys', 'see', 'cruising', 'burgers', 'chicks', 'picking', 'fights', 'going', 'work', 'habit', 'ease', 'obviously', 'built', 'years', 'years', 'Later', 'someone', 'Affleck', 'character', 'relationship', 'Damon', 'Chuckie', 'family', ""'d"", 'lie', 'down', 'traffic', 'line', 'superfluous', 'validation', 'things', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'ourselves.Second', 'get', 'tortured', 'genius/prodigy', 'credit', 'here', 'must', 'be', 'split', 'two', 'places', 'First', 'script', 'great', 'pains', 'authenticity', 'Apparently', 'theorems', 'Will', 'are', 'as', 'complex', 'portrayed', 'are', 'solved', 'appropriate', 'manner', 'Most', 'movie', 'portrayals', 'genius', 'tend', 'fudge', 'part', 'equation', 'hoping', 'audience', 'dumb', 'enough', 'not', 'recognize', 'guitar', 'virtuoso', 'not', 'really', 'playing', 'song', 'problem', 'found', 'distracting', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'great', 'writer', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'snuff', 'problem', 'director', 'Van', 'Sant', 'later', 'film', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'Second', 'Damon', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'ease', 'math', 'coiled', 'frustration', 'with.Third', 'get', 'mentors', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'mathematician', 'who', 'Will', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'settled', 'being', 'two-dimensional', 'villain', 'Prof.', 'Lambeau', 'believably', 'flawed', 'displaced', 'ambition', 'never', 'cartoonish', 'unredeemably', 'destructive', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'psychologist', 'Will', 'court-ordered', 'see', 'nary', 'moment', 'patented', 'over-the-top', 'showmanship', 'Sean', 'reserved', 'anguished', 'powerful', 'always', 'very', 'subtle', 'ways', 'Williams', 'best', 'work', 'portraying', 'Sean', 'grief', 'calling', 'up', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'boil', 'lash', 'out', 'protect', 'first', 'scene', 'Will', 'relationship', 'up', 'strengthening', 'time', 'culminating', 'one', 'final', 'scene', 'catharsis', 'portrayed', 'lesser', 'actors', 'lesser', 'script', 'would', 'come', 'schmaltzy', 'here', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'moving.Fourth', 'get', 'girl', 'remember', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'took', 'lot', 'flak', 'throwing', 'so', 'shamelessly', 'Will', 'who', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'capable', 'giving', 'anything', 'back', 'looking', 'movie', 'again', 'astounding', 'act', 'courage', 'could', 'be', 'criticized', 'so', 'Skylar', 'Driver', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'joie', 'vivre', 'as', 'well', 'self-consciousness', 'set', 'up', 'life', 'education', 'finances', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'hardship', 'case', 'Will', 'yet', 'repeatedly', 'so', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'back', 'Sure', 'most', 'part', 'borderline', 'masochistic', 'needless', 'amount', 'torture', 'would', ""n't"", 'easier', 'road', 'be', 'less', 'satisfying', 'would', ""n't"", 'less', 'complex', 'character', 'boy', 'genius', 'Will', 'be', 'confronted', 'just', 'become', 'easy', 'prey', 'Yes', 'yes', 'say.These', 'four', 'items', 'combined', 'flair', 'solid', 'sometimes', 'flashy', 'dialogue', 'How', 'do', 'like', 'apples', 'make', 'up', 'wonderful', 'film', 'good', 'promises', 'be', 'entertaining', 'emotional', 'assuredly', 'worthwhile']",Good Will Hunting

81331,A1KAR9G699RM56,0788814664,M. Miller,"[3, 3]","Good Will Hunting was a good story about a boy genius, named Will hunting.  Will, played by Matt Damon, knows he's smarter than almost anyone, book smart that is.  Yet when a college professor at Harvard discovers his genius, Will is offish and unwilling to cooperate with others, preferring the simple life with his friends.  After one of many crimes, Will is, under the teacher's supervision, allowed his freedom if he practices math and goes to therapy.  Although the math aspect of the movie is the binding aspect, it is Will's volatile personality that is the true core of the film.  Robin Williams' character, for which he won an Oscar, is one of many psychiatrists.  Yet his tough love helps us see the deeper side of Will Hunting.This entire beautiful tale is part of the superb screenplay.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it, and because of it they won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  This is because the story, along with the richness of the acting, truly enables us to understand Will's character.  We get a glimpse of what it might be like struggling with domestic problems, or growing up a poor kid in south Boston, or just how much deep hurt and aguish can a person have balled up inside them.  The movie is very good, with only the seeming question as when does Robin William's come in, because his part is fairly late in the film.  Yet that is not an issue because the acting throughout this movie is great.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could but since I cannot, and I only round down, it easily achieves a four star rating.",4,Good for those Movie Hunting,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1549,"['Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'boy', 'genius', 'named', 'Will', 'hunting', 'Will', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'smarter', 'almost', 'anyone', 'book', 'smart', 'Yet', 'when', 'college', 'professor', 'Harvard', 'genius', 'Will', 'offish', 'unwilling', 'cooperate', 'others', 'preferring', 'simple', 'life', 'friends', 'one', 'many', 'crimes', 'Will', 'teacher', 'supervision', 'allowed', 'freedom', 'practices', 'math', 'therapy', 'math', 'aspect', 'movie', 'binding', 'aspect', 'Will', 'volatile', 'personality', 'true', 'core', 'film', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'won', 'Oscar', 'one', 'many', 'psychiatrists', 'tough', 'love', 'see', 'deeper', 'side', 'Will', 'Hunting.This', 'entire', 'beautiful', 'tale', 'part', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'wrote', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'story', 'richness', 'acting', 'truly', 'understand', 'Will', 'character', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'struggling', 'domestic', 'problems', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'kid', 'south', 'Boston', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'deep', 'hurt', 'aguish', 'can', 'person', 'have', 'balled', 'up', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'seeming', 'question', 'when', 'Robin', 'William', 'come', 'part', 'fairly', 'late', 'film', 'not', 'issue', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'give', '4.5', 'could', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'round', 'down', 'easily', 'four', 'star', 'rating']",Good Will Hunting

Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 2]","Anyone who remembers Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho or To Die For will remember when Gus Van Sant was hailed as the next big thing on the indie scene.  So is it any surprise that when his first big commercial success met with equal amounts of derision as with praise?  In many ways you can see it from both sides.  Good Will Hunting, scripted by best pals in real life as well as on screen Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is the story of a mathematical genius orphaned caretaker who needs a little professional guidance (or Robin Williams) to put him on the straight path towards happiness.Admitedly the story may make fans of Van Sant's more original work cringe, but there really is something uplifting here.  Matt Damon is perfectly cast as Will Hunting, proving as he did in The Talented Mr. Ripley, that he's much more than just a pretty face.  Robin Williams is good also, being much better in serious roles such as this than in something like Patch Adams.  Minnie Driver is fine, although it's the obvious chemistry between her and her co-star that really interests.  Ben Affleck plays the knockaround good guy of Chasing Amy, the only kind of role in which he seems really comfortable in.What's most surprising about the movie though is that aside from it's sweet and sickly message of 'follow your heart' there is more to it.  One scene in particular, where Williams and Damon face it off in a discussion of real life versus intellectualism is not only well observed but also well acted by both parties.  On top of this, the romance between Damon and Driver is sparky and believable (for obvious reasons), ensuring that you really care when Will's personal demons start impinging on the relationship.  Of course, this is the kind of movie that a lot of people will feel compelled to say that they don't like because on many levels it is a little obvious.  However, that certainly isn't to say that it isn't affecting in its way, and if parts come across as clich&eacute;d then it's a small price to pay for one of the better Hollywood melodramas to come from the 90's.  Unfortunately, Gus Van Sant then managed to go downhill with his pointless remake of Psycho and then his virtual replication of Good Will Hunting, Finding Forrester.  In this way maybe we should view Good Will Hunting as his last standout film.",4,Sentimentalised?  Yes.  Bad?

The movie they wrote is one of the most original to come along in a while.  The movie takes place in Boston and focuses on relationships in the life of Will Hunting (Matt Damon).  Will is a janitor at MIT, but he isn't your ordinary janitor.  Will is actually a math genius.  When a Professor Lambeau (Stellan Stalksgaard) puts an virtual impossible problem on a board in the hallway for his students to work on during the year.  Will figures the problem in a matter of days, Lambeau catches him working on it and finds out who he is.  Will spends his spare time drinking with his buddies including his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck).  They get into a brawl on a basketball court and Will gets thrown in jail.  He has a prior record and is facing time, but Lambeau offers him a chance out if he works with him on math theories.  Will reluctantly agrees, but as part of his probation, he must see a psychiatrist.  Lambeau sends him to his college roommate, Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), who teaches at small Bunker Hill College.  Will is at first distant and dismisses Sean.  He meets a college student, Sklyer (Minnie Driver), in a bar and they start a romance.  Eventual Sean starts to break through to Will as they both have alot in common and Sean isn't after Will's genius.  Will eventually confronts his demons and the movie ends on an interesting note.  All the actors in the film give first rate performances.  Mr. Williams gives the performance of his career and he won the 1997 Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

Not really knowing much about it and unaware of the props it had receiced, I watched it one evening when it came on TV. It was amazing.The movies is about a boy named Will (Matt Damon) who with his friends, drinks, goes in and out of jobs, and tends to get in a fair amount of trouble.

Many viewers are so offended by the profanity that they either did not view the movie or went away angry/offended.  Either they don't believe lowbrow individuals such as the Southies exist, or they wish they keep the hell away from them.  I like movies/art that creates controversy and forces viewers to deal with unresolved personal issues.  GWH is one of these films. Profanity is used to define the world they live in manifesting frustration felt knowing they will be in the ""same"" place 50 years from now!?  Profanity is common among poor people, especially males needing to ""prove something.""  Who doesn't know this?  However, I did not like GWH for the first 1-hour 45-minutes because I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  But the last meeting between Williams and Damon found relevance within me.  To quote the Bible: Iron sharpeneth iron, so does a man the countenance of his friend.  This metaphor uses the analogy of metals rubbing against one another to achieve sharpness like the awakenings in the professor/therapist/patient/best friend. Even viewers are sharpened by GWH, especially those who hated everything about this film.  You can say they were ""rubbed the wrong way,"" and now have to resolve whatever inside them that bristled against this movie, or allow it to fester and continuously cloud objectivity necessary to really enjoy any art. GWH redeems itself by ending predictably by way of a very interesting screenplay associating memorable interpersonal communications that anyone able to finish the movie should find enlightening.  Williams telling Damon ""It's not your fault,"" is appropriate as the key that unlocks the pain that has come to the surface.  Some viewers are bothered by this seemingly trivial approach to psychoanalysis.  But this is the point: after hours/days/months/years of analysis, it is always just one thing (that repetitive clause) among everything else that works finally as a catalyst and constitutes the bridge that allows the patient to cross over into wellness.  In GWH, the screenplay uses this dialog symbolically as a transititional key to define growth and progress.

The most dramatic moments in the film occur when ""baggage"" from Hunting's or McGuire's past is opened up in the present as decisions must be made about the future. The exteriors in and around Boston are lovely, an area in which I lived for many years. There is also a great deal of humor in the script, co-authored by Damon and Ben Affleck who plays Will's closest friend, Chuckie. (They received an Academy Award for best original screenplay.) This film offers several ""feel better"" benefits but for me, its ultimate appeal is based on Damon's performance as a troubled young man who, ""with a little help from his friends,"" can eventually chart a new course for his life.

And surely this essence is present in this movie in form of a beautiful screenplay by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, the precise & very sensitive direction by Gus Van Sant. And last but not the least to mention the heartfelt performances by Matt Damon & Robin Williams.'Good Will Hunting' is about a boy who knows himself much better than anyone else could possibly know,who is a whiz kid in mathematics;but works as a caretaker at MIT often solving  the most complicated problems on the walls of the university. To do so he has his own reasons of not to be away from his friends and of a painful childhood that he has left far behind somewhere but still its presence is not completely washed off. Will's(Matt Damon) genius is discovered by professor Gerald(Stellan Skarsgard)who takes charge of rescuing him from the inhibitions he has built up within himself, with the help of a fellow friend psychiatrist Sean(Robin Williams). This was not at all easy, but with time ticking the reluctance grows into a respect & understanding of a very high stature which doesn't necessarily comprise of big actions, but of little & soft moments. Best friend Chuckie(Ben Affleck) & lover Skylar(Minnie Driver) also play a major role in pushing Will to realise something he already knows and which is well deserved by him.The therapy sessions shown are humorous as well as very touching. The most heart-rending one was when Will finally breaks in front of Sean by repeatedly saying 'Don't mess with me Sean'. This scene will naturally have tears rolling down ur cheeks and a gush of feelings hard to handle.This movie becomes special & different in presenting the statement 'there is nothing wrong in men crying..'.

Honest citizen?  No.I'm surprised this movie is rated so high by film critics and by viewers nationwide despite the amount of holes this movie has in its story.  Not to mention lackluster performances by some of its main characters and the overall story's believability.So we're presented with Will Hunting who is the cleanest cut dropout reject to ever step foot on the streets of Boston I have ever seen.  Umm yeah right.  The hole with Hunting's character is the obvious lack of his childhood background throughout the movie.  He's a genius, but he's had a tough childhood.  There are rarely any references to his childhood and certainly no flashbacks to help the viewer understand him a little better as the movie goes on.  What happened to him?  How did he become a genius?  Robin Williams does a great job of ""guessing"" what happened to Will, but how about going into depth?  Two words:  Character development.  We hardly even know how old he is throughout the movie until his best friend, played by Ben Affleck just miraculously gets a car for him for his 21st birthday.  So where did Ben get this car?  Hmmm.Also, what is the rival between both professors all about?  Vague descriptions of their past, but Williams depicts a down on his luck professor who if you think about closely is pretty much in the same boat as Hunting.  Struggling to cope with a troubled past.....which is??  Yes his wife has passed, but there's more to the professor's psyche.The biggest hole I have a problem with as I mentioned earlier is the genius of Will Hunting.  What makes him this way?  Why can he solve complicated math equations, but is lacking common sense skills and a decent living for himself?  Who taught him as a youth?  Einstein started somewhere, where did Hunting start?Overall, it's a good concept for a film and a great personal story of perseverance through several hardships and society around you.

The screenplay was written by Matt Damon and Ben Afflick.  (Damon and Afflick won an Academy Award for best screenplay.)This movie begins when somewhat snobbish MIT Mathematics Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) decides to put an advanced mathematics problem (in Fourier Analyses) on a hallway chalk board and challenges anyone in his classes to solve it.  The next day the problem is solved but the person who did so does not reveal himself/herself.So the professor decides to post another advanced math problem and this time, the person who solves it is caught in the act.  Who is this math wiz?  It turns out to be the lowly janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) whom the professor learns is from ""the wrong side of the tracks.""  In fact, Will may be going to jail for a crime he committed but the math professor sees to it that this janitor is released into his custody but on the condition that he see a psychotherapist.After going through five therapists, Will meets a therapist named Sean (Robin Williams) that wants to help him even though he does not want to be helped.  Will also meets a university student named Skylar (Minnie Driver) whom he has a relationship with.The movie proceeds by revolving around four components of Will's life:(1) His menial work and his group of friends.  Note that Ben Afflick plays one of his closest friends, Chuckie.(2) His mathematical work with the math professor.(3) His therapy work with the psychotherapist.(4) His relationship with the university student.I thought this movie was going to be boring and predictable.  Surprisingly, it drew me in.  One reason for this is that it's very realistic.  There's talk of such things as Rumanujam (a math genius who died young), Albert Einstein, and the Fields Medal (kind of like the Nobel Prize in mathematics).Beware that there is much profanity in this movie.  I found that it added to the movie's realism.  The movie is also humorous in places.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.I found all the acting superb.  Special kudos must go to Robin Williams who gives an incredibly restrained performance as the psychotherapist.  (Williams won an Academy Award for best supporting actor.)Finally, the DVD (the one released in Dec. 1998) itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras all of which I found interesting.In conclusion, if you want to see a good movie that concentrates on relationships & feelings and deals with an interesting subject, then this movie is a must!!(1998;  2 hr 5 min;  wide screen;  21 scenes;  rated R)+++++",5,Are there unrecognized geniuses among us??,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2911,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', 'idea', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'geniuses', 'are', 'such', 'things', 'poor', 'health', 'not', 'enough', 'money', 'not', 'knowing', 'right', 'people', 'coming', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'circumstances', 'control', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'luck', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'true', 'potential', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ben', 'Afflick', 'Damon', 'Afflick', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'when', 'somewhat', 'snobbish', 'MIT', 'Mathematics', 'Professor', 'Lambeau', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'put', 'advanced', 'mathematics', 'problem', 'Fourier', 'Analyses', 'hallway', 'chalk', 'board', 'anyone', 'classes', 'solve', 'next', 'day', 'problem', 'solved', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'not', 'reveal', 'himself/herself.So', 'professor', 'post', 'advanced', 'math', 'problem', 'time', 'person', 'who', 'caught', 'act', 'Who', 'math', 'wiz', 'out', 'be', 'lowly', 'janitor', 'named', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'whom', 'professor', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'fact', 'Will', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'jail', 'crime', 'committed', 'math', 'professor', 'janitor', 'released', 'custody', 'condition', 'see', 'psychotherapist.After', 'going', 'five', 'therapists', 'Will', 'therapist', 'named', 'Sean', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'help', 'even', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'helped', 'Will', 'also', 'university', 'student', 'named', 'Skylar', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'whom', 'relationship', 'with.The', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'revolving', 'around', 'four', 'components', 'Will', 'life', '1', 'menial', 'work', 'group', 'friends', 'Note', 'Ben', 'Afflick', 'one', 'closest', 'friends', 'Chuckie', '2', 'mathematical', 'work', 'math', 'professor', '3', 'therapy', 'work', 'psychotherapist', '4', 'relationship', 'university', 'student.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'boring', 'predictable', 'Surprisingly', 'drew', 'One', 'reason', 'very', 'realistic', 'talk', 'such', 'things', 'Rumanujam', 'math', 'genius', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'Fields', 'Medal', 'kind', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'mathematics', '.Beware', 'much', 'profanity', 'movie', 'found', 'added', 'movie', 'realism', 'movie', 'also', 'humorous', 'places', 'well', 'background', 'music', 'scene.I', 'found', 'acting', 'superb', 'Special', 'kudos', 'must', 'go', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'incredibly', 'restrained', 'performance', 'psychotherapist', 'Williams', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', 'Dec.', '1998', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'several', 'extras', 'found', 'interesting.In', 'conclusion', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'relationships', 'feelings', 'deals', 'interesting', 'subject', 'then', 'movie', 'must', '1998', '2', 'hr', '5', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '21', 'scenes', 'rated', 'R', '+++++']",Good Will Hunting

As Gus Van Sant's ""Good Will Hunting"" shows, one can dedicate his entire life to mastering an academic discipline . . . only to be one-upped by the janitor. Matt Damon made his cinematic break-through portraying Will Hunting, the MIT janitor who is a master of mathematics but a basket case in the more personal aspects of life. He is the janitor at MIT who catches the eye of Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) who sees the unlimited potential in Hunting even if Hunting himself can't see it. Yet, the trauma of Hunting's life has taken its toll on the boy and Lambeau hopes counseling by his old college roommate, Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) can help undo the psychological damage. Supported by Skylar (Minnie Driver), a Harvard student, and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Hunting begins to make strides and come to grips with his past.""Good Will Hunting"" basically came out of nowhere in 1997 and captured the imagination of the viewing public. It was a reminder that solid films could still be made without $100 million budgets. It was also the film that made both Damon and Affleck household names, won Robin Williams his first Oscar, and gave director Gus Van Sant (of ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""To Die For"" fame) his first major commercial success. It was a straightforward character study fueled by strong individual performances and clever dialogue which emulated films of an earlier era that reveled in its simplicity and not its bombast. ""Good Will Hunting"" will never be mistaken for a Hollywood epic but it still endears as a little cinematic gem from the 1990's.",3,"""What's with everyone saying that I owe it to myself?",1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,1614,"['Genius', 'fleeting', 'thing', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'one', 'can', 'dedicate', 'entire', 'life', 'mastering', 'academic', 'discipline', 'only', 'be', 'one-upped', 'janitor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'made', 'cinematic', 'break-through', 'portraying', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'MIT', 'janitor', 'who', 'master', 'mathematics', 'basket', 'case', 'more', 'personal', 'aspects', 'life', 'janitor', 'MIT', 'who', 'eye', 'Professor', 'Lambeau', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'unlimited', 'potential', 'Hunting', 'even', 'Hunting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'trauma', 'Hunting', 'life', 'taken', 'toll', 'boy', 'Lambeau', 'counseling', 'old', 'college', 'roommate', 'Sean', 'McGuire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'can', 'help', 'undo', 'psychological', 'damage', 'Supported', 'Skylar', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Harvard', 'student', 'best', 'friend', 'Chuckie', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Hunting', 'begins', 'make', 'strides', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'basically', 'came', 'nowhere', '1997', 'captured', 'imagination', 'viewing', 'public', 'was', 'reminder', 'solid', 'films', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'made', '100', 'million', 'budgets', 'was', 'also', 'film', 'made', 'Damon', 'Affleck', 'household', 'names', 'won', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'first', 'Oscar', 'gave', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'Die', 'fame', 'first', 'major', 'commercial', 'success', 'was', 'straightforward', 'character', 'study', 'fueled', 'strong', 'individual', 'performances', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'emulated', 'films', 'earlier', 'era', 'reveled', 'simplicity', 'not', 'bombast', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'still', 'little', 'cinematic', 'gem', '1990']",Good Will Hunting

81392,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,0788814664,Thayer,"[2, 4]","A mathematics professor was forced to track down the mysterious man who solved a mathematics problem that took professionals years to solve. That man turned out to be Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who incidentally works as a janitor in that said university. After being incarcerated for a series of assault charges, professor Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard) took Will under his wing provided that he would work on some mathematics related exercises and that he would undergo therapy every week.Will, the genius that he is, knows how to push the buttons of the therapists assigned to him. He made them all quit until Sean (Robin Williams) came along who knows exactly what Will was doing. Their sessions together gave Will the ability to emotionally articulate the painful past he had that affected his relationship with people.Chuckie (Ben Affleck) is Will's loyal friend, the only person whom he can share at least a little part of what he feels. Skylar (Minnie Driver) is the love interest  significant to Will's ""emotional"" opening up. Will's relationship with the two characters was resonant and poignant. Will and Sean's relationship was the heart of the movie, but the soul lies in the relationship of Will to those two characters.The movie's got an involving and affecting story that is beautifully put into screen by Damon and Affleck's screenplay. It is beautifully paced and shot and all the characters were able to assert their significance in the movie by allowing them to have character defining scenes. Performances were all great. Robin Williams in an understated performance was effective in capturing the ""quiet spunk"" of the character. Minnie Driver was heartbreaking and transcended the `love interest"" label. Stellan Skarsgard also struck some chord as he trains a genius who was intellectually ahead of him. Ben Affleck also provides an effective support that is both showy and honest. Last but not the least, Matt Damon in a career making performance, solidified his way into major star status. He gave the right combination of charm, humor, restrained emoting, and ultimately allowing himself to be vulnerable. Good Will Hunting to Matt Damon is what The Fabulous Baker Boys is to Michelle Pfeiffer and Saturday Night Fever is to John TravoltaTwo beautiful scenes were instrumental to the ending. One was when Chuckie told Will that every time he picks him up in his house he secretly wishes that he'd be gone without any goodbye whatsoever because he hates seeing him wasting his life. Another one was when Sean in one of their sessions told Will the day he realized that he wanted to spend the rest of his life to his now deceased wife. The sentiments of those two scenes were used beautifully in the ending.  The movie wraps up as the end credits rolls with the shot of Will's car in the free way heading somewhere. The ending was understated, powerful, classy, and memorable. A perfect ending to one gem of a movie.Grade: A",5,"""I was actually hoping for a goodnight lay""",1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2943,"['mathematics', 'professor', 'was', 'forced', 'track', 'down', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'solved', 'mathematics', 'problem', 'took', 'professionals', 'years', 'solve', 'man', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'incidentally', 'janitor', 'said', 'university', 'being', 'incarcerated', 'series', 'assault', 'charges', 'professor', 'Lambeau', 'Stellen', 'Skarsgard', 'took', 'Will', 'wing', 'provided', 'would', 'work', 'mathematics', 'related', 'exercises', 'would', 'undergo', 'therapy', 'week.Will', 'genius', 'how', 'push', 'buttons', 'therapists', 'assigned', 'made', 'quit', 'Sean', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'came', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'Will', 'was', 'doing', 'sessions', 'together', 'gave', 'Will', 'ability', 'emotionally', 'articulate', 'painful', 'past', 'had', 'affected', 'relationship', 'people.Chuckie', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Will', 'loyal', 'friend', 'only', 'person', 'whom', 'can', 'share', 'least', 'little', 'part', 'what', 'Skylar', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'love', 'interest', 'significant', 'Will', 'emotional', 'opening', 'up', 'Will', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'resonant', 'poignant', 'Will', 'Sean', 'relationship', 'was', 'heart', 'movie', 'soul', 'relationship', 'Will', 'two', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'got', 'involving', 'affecting', 'story', 'beautifully', 'put', 'screen', 'Damon', 'Affleck', 'screenplay', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'shot', 'characters', 'were', 'able', 'assert', 'significance', 'movie', 'allowing', 'have', 'character', 'defining', 'scenes', 'Performances', 'were', 'great', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'understated', 'performance', 'was', 'effective', 'capturing', 'quiet', 'spunk', 'character', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'transcended', 'love', 'interest', 'label', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'also', 'struck', 'chord', 'genius', 'who', 'was', 'intellectually', 'ahead', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'also', 'effective', 'support', 'showy', 'honest', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'career', 'making', 'performance', 'solidified', 'way', 'major', 'star', 'status', 'gave', 'right', 'combination', 'charm', 'humor', 'restrained', 'emoting', 'ultimately', 'allowing', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'what', 'Fabulous', 'Baker', 'Boys', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'John', 'TravoltaTwo', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'were', 'instrumental', 'ending', 'One', 'was', 'when', 'Chuckie', 'told', 'Will', 'time', 'up', 'house', 'secretly', ""'d"", 'be', 'gone', 'goodbye', 'whatsoever', 'seeing', 'wasting', 'life', 'one', 'was', 'when', 'Sean', 'one', 'sessions', 'told', 'Will', 'day', 'realized', 'wanted', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'now', 'deceased', 'wife', 'sentiments', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'beautifully', 'ending', 'movie', 'up', 'end', 'rolls', 'shot', 'Will', 'car', 'free', 'way', 'heading', 'somewhere', 'ending', 'was', 'understated', 'powerful', 'classy', 'memorable', 'perfect', 'ending', 'one', 'gem', 'movie.Grade']",Good Will Hunting

Talk about your double-entendres for a title?  Now I know better; for the title tells us Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a good man; but a broken one like we all are who live in this imperfect world.Anyway, I wasn't sure whether to see this film when it came out, but having come from a broken home myself, I loved the film once I saw it. Both Damon and Williams carry the plot line well while using their own natural charisma to draw you into their characters.  The camera work in this is also well done. Jean Escoffier did a marvelous job with all the shots.It's a simple plot of a young man, orphaned; brilliant, who is disconnected in some ways from the world, well in need of love and understanding and who keeps himself protected via his brilliant mind.  He's a master wiz with math and is in need of a brilliant intercessor, played by Robin Williams, to help him find his place in the world: Enter in Robin Williams as the psychiatrist.  It's a great film dedicated to character development which I've always been big on, even when I was in my teens and twenties; which I must say is a nice walk away at times from the roller coaster ride thrillers Hollywood likes to put out these days.  So if you love good character development and a good delivery of the human condition; I'd watch this film.Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams do a great job with the acting in this.  In the scene when Matt breaks down and starts to cry, once Williams brings his character to full term and the gestalt takes place between them in terms of Will Huntings greatest fear, tears started to come down my eyes as well when I think back of the broken home I came out of.

81396,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0788814664,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[7, 8]","Director:  Gus Van SantCast:  Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, John Mighton, Rachel Majorowski.Running Time:  126 minutesRated R for strong language, including some sex-related dialogue.The script for ""Good Will Hunting"" is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: two talented young actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain. Every line of dialog, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality. Every scene, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging. Outside of maybe ""Pulp Fiction"", there had not been script this original and absorbing in some time.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an orphan who has been to a number of abusive foster homes. At twenty, he starts working at the prestigious MIT as a caretaker on parole, since he's been involved in several assaults. One day the tough maths question on the board is found solved and the searching of the mystery genius begins. When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) realises it is Will who has solved the difficult tasks, he decides to help him by offering him working on further maths studies and seeing a psychotherapist. Talented and yet highly defensive, Will manages to scare all the shrinks away and eventually Professor Lambeau has to turn to psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his university roommate for help.  Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people. Meanwhile, Will falls in love with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver) but later has to confront his inner uncertainty. In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in ""Dead Poets Society"". Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies, rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues. His performance is not superficial, but nuanced--knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will. Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn. Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.

81397,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,0788814664,Thomas Keneally,"[9, 20]","Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant was hugely sucessful when it came out. It portrayes the life of a poor janitor who is exceptionally talented in mathematics. Matt Damon is emotionally disturbed and tries to push off people coming too close to him. While parts of the movie are OK, there is too much cheesiness in this movie. There are enough mathematicians and logicians lives that are confusing enough as it is. Take the life of Kurt Godel, the Austrian logician. Robin Williams role as the Psychiatryst bringing out Matt Damon was over done. There was no professionalism in the roles. The amount of bad language is also too much for someone connected with such a movie.As I have seen multiple times, Hollywood is terrible at portraying science and scientists. It shows Matt Damon good at Chemistry, Mathematics, History and Economics. Areas nowadays are so advanced that people have trouble keeping up with parts of one area, there is no way anyone can be a novice at multiple areas let alone an expert. As the mathematician Hardy said after seeing Ramanujan's papers, that he was able to spend considerable time only on Hypergeometric series, as it was close to his heart. Also, it shows the lack of understanding of Mathematics too, the great days of theorem proving are gone, nowadays most mathematical research is spent on developing new areas of math or in connecting seemingly unconnected areas of math. One mathematician, Polya, refused to prove existing areas as he wanted to develop his own areas. I would sincerely hope that directors would take more trouble with their research before starting on such movies. The movie shows something about Fields medals but has no clue of the kind of people who win them, which shows how simplistic it is. Overall, I hope that people who makes movies like this and Beautiful Mind do more work before doing such a silly job.",2,"Too cheesy, another Hollywood movie that is silly on Science",1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,1873,"['Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'was', 'hugely', 'sucessful', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'life', 'poor', 'janitor', 'who', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'mathematics', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'tries', 'push', 'off', 'people', 'coming', 'too', 'close', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'OK', 'too', 'much', 'cheesiness', 'movie', 'are', 'enough', 'mathematicians', 'lives', 'are', 'confusing', 'enough', 'Take', 'life', 'Kurt', 'Godel', 'Austrian', 'logician', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'Psychiatryst', 'bringing', 'out', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'professionalism', 'roles', 'amount', 'bad', 'language', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'someone', 'connected', 'movie.As', 'have', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'Hollywood', 'terrible', 'portraying', 'science', 'scientists', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'Chemistry', 'Mathematics', 'History', 'Economics', 'Areas', 'nowadays', 'are', 'so', 'advanced', 'people', 'have', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'parts', 'one', 'area', 'way', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'novice', 'multiple', 'areas', 'let', 'alone', 'expert', 'mathematician', 'Hardy', 'said', 'seeing', 'Ramanujan', 'papers', 'was', 'able', 'spend', 'considerable', 'time', 'only', 'Hypergeometric', 'series', 'was', 'close', 'heart', 'Also', 'lack', 'understanding', 'Mathematics', 'too', 'great', 'days', 'theorem', 'proving', 'are', 'gone', 'most', 'mathematical', 'research', 'spent', 'developing', 'new', 'areas', 'math', 'connecting', 'seemingly', 'unconnected', 'areas', 'math', 'One', 'mathematician', 'Polya', 'refused', 'prove', 'existing', 'areas', 'wanted', 'develop', 'own', 'areas', 'would', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'directors', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'trouble', 'research', 'starting', 'such', 'movies', 'movie', 'something', 'Fields', 'medals', 'clue', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'win', 'how', 'simplistic', 'Overall', 'hope', 'people', 'who', 'movies', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'do', 'more', 'work', 'doing', 'such', 'silly', 'job']",Good Will Hunting

Then, one night, I decided to try it.  How bad could it be?  If it was awful, I figured, at least with Affleck it oughta be funny (in an unintentional way).But guess what?  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't bad.  In fact, it was pretty near great.The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here.  Young Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is, secretly, a mathematical genius, who puts out a rebellious attitudeto disguise this.  While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever.  He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude.  The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor: Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams.  Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to filmmaking, grabbed an Academy Award for ""Best Original Screenplay"" for writing the tale of ""Good Will Hunting"".  Williams also received an Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"", and the film was nominated for seven other awards including ""Best Picture"".  The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant.  His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script.  There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.I find this film to be severely underrated.  If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you.  ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder.

The notions that psychotherapy actually produces real results and that men have genuine emotions are  antithetical to most Hollywood films-aside, perhaps, from _The Prince of  Tides_.  This film not only celebrates these unexplored realities, it  manages to do so with style.  This is made possible only by the control  the director exercises over his actors, and the film's  excellent script.  Robin Williams, in particular, is kept wholly within the bounds of his  tightly drawn character-and we are very much enriched by his performance.  And while it might be true that the script might be self-indulgent on the  part of its writers, but the selves that are indulging are fascinating.  The same story told by different writers with a different set of real life  experiences might well have been unlovable, but Affleck and Damon's lives  produced experiences we actually *want* to see.  For me, though, it is the  story of exceeding to the full measure of one's potentials, both  emotionally and professionally, that makes _Good Will Hunting_ a movie to  own.There are two DVD versions, and their price differential is  minimal enough to make buying the regular version a waste.  No, you should  definitely go for the Collector's Edition, as the bonus materials are  significant and worthwhile.

He can stand head-to-head in intellectual debates with Harvard graduate students, and then booze it up and street fight with his low-life Southy buddies.  Then, when there's crime occuring nearby, he goes into a telephone booth and...ooh...wait...wrong guy...This movie should have been labeled as a comedy, as there is very little here that will fail to make you laugh.  Or better yet, science fiction, because it pushes the outer limits of absurdity with an ill-concieved plotline that involves a college janitor who is intellectually gifted (?), but has never realized his potential. A college professor discovers Hunting's talent for solving complex equations and tries to reform him through psychoanalysis.Good Will Hunting fails to impress on three levels.  First, the plot is utterly unbelieveable.  Second, the dialogue is very abrasive to anyone with a post-secondary degree.  And finally, the two main characters (Williams and Damon)in the movie are unlikable.  No big bash here on Affleck or Damon, I think they're both good actors (especially Damon), but as screenwriters, the two are a joke.With regard to the first and second points (on the plot and dialouge that is), I am sure that there are possibly a few people out there in the real world gifted with exceptionally high IQs and, because of circumstances beyond thier control, are relgated to doing menial labor.  On a similar note, there are probably a few people out there with low IQs who are fortunate enough to hold high ranking positions in society, such as some political officals (ahem).However, it is inconcievable for any human being to *naturally* grasp concepts in subjects such as History, Economics, Statistics, Psychology and Organic Chemistry without the benefit of caring tutilidge.  It is hard enough to master any one of these subjects, let alone all, as Hunting seemingly does.  This aspect of the plot will cause anyone with a Bachelor's Degree or higher to want to hurl rubber bricks at the television set.  I believe that it was Einstien who said that: ""genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration"" (or was that Weird Al Yankovic?).  No matter.And herein lies the difference between good screenwriting and bad.  Any story about a downtrodden and orphaned janitor trying to educate himself against all odds could have been a winner, if it were played out as a realistic production.  Why did Affleck and Damon *need* to play upon adolescent fantasy and make Hunting the second coming of the Messiah?  Good drama does not require such sensationalism.With regard to the third point, both Hunting and the Williams' characters are unlikable.  Hunting, is a pariah ""know-it-all"" with a chip on his shoulder who delights in showing up psychologists up for his own amusement.  While Damon does a good job of acting the part, I had no feeling or sympathy for his character.  Specifically, I think that it would be very unlikely that anyone with such a high level of intellectual and cultural awareness would be such a callous social retard.  (For Pete's Sake buddy, what part of: ""You're going to jail if you don't humor the shrinks!"" does this supposed genius not understand?!) Even Forrest Gump would probably agree that a protagonist in any movie should have some redeeming qualities.Williams, on the other hand, sucks eggs and is one-dimensional.  He plays the same damn character in every movie he's been in since Good Morning Vietnam.  He's become a fixture as the ""lovable, sensitive and funny"" guy and it's getting old.  They always give him the role that is supposed to make you feel sorry for him and cry.  In this movie, he's the widower psychologist and the only guy who can relate to Will Hunting because he's from the same upbringing.  How utterly cliche!

I am incredibly glad that it did win for Best Original Screenplay.  A monologue performed by Robin Williams' character is probably the best monologues in a film ever written.  I was amazed.  It was so touching and so real.  After watching this movie just once, it has already proved itself to be one of my favorite movies of all time.Surprisingly, I do have one disclaimer for all of those families looking for movies like this one to watch with their families.  You know, movies that sort of have a theme like &quot;life is tough but somehow, you'll make it through.&quot;  This is similar, but trust me, it is not a family film.  It has language every five seconds and a lot of sex-related dialogue and humor.  This does not obstruct, however, the amazing script all together.  If you're looking for a powerhouse film without being over the top, this one's it.The acting in this movie is also superior, namely Matt Damon.  This is his first movie to really get people's attention.  He even received an Oscar nomination for his leading  role, and deservadly so.  It really amazed me how he seemed so perfect (he is a genius after all) but on the inside, he was struggling.  And slowly, as these defense mechanisms start coming into play, he unravels and to have someone reveal their inner being like this so perfectly really establishes them as an amazing actor.  Robin Williams was also in this film and he also did very well, receiving his first Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.  Also nominated was Minnie Driver, playing Damon's girlfriend in the movie.  She had this arguement with Damon towards the end of the film and it allowed her to shine.  She was so raw, so real.  She blew me away.  Before Good Will Hunting I had never seen her in anything very high quality.  Thankgoodness for this movie!Bottom Line: Although not a family film (trust me), this movie establishes itself to be one of the best all around movies of recent years.

Affleck plays his best friend, Chuck, an average working joe who, along with two other friends, accompanies Will in all his (mis)adventures in life.  Their Boston accents are absolutely flawless in this film.  Will, working as a janitor at MIT, spots an incredibly difficult problem on a blackboard outside one of the lecture halls and solves it inside of a minute without breaking a sweat--he's a genius, possibly a super-genius, and we see him able to match wits even with arrogant Harvard students (as in one very amusing scene in a Cambridge bar/Harvard hangout spot) quite easily.  He is spotted by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stelland Skaarsgard), who agrees to bail Will out of jail after his most recent scrape with the law if he'll 1) work with the professor on solving some very difficult math problems and 2) see a psychiatrist to work out his problems.Will, who grew up an orphan in and out of various foster homes, often being horribly abused, has developed a tough outer shell that makes him push everyone away who tries to get too close--he tears down each of the professor's suggested shrinks until Lambeau matches him up with Sean Kelly (Robin Williams, in the best piece of acting he's ever done), who turns out to be, in many ways, Will's soul-brother (another Southie native who had a hard childhood).  He even keeps Schuyler (Minnie Driver), his girlfriend, at a distance with a tall tale about his 12 Irish Catholic brothers, even though it's clear he's quite fond of her, and she's in love with him.The story that unfolds, while it may be somewhat cliche, is also one we can all easily recognise, having some element of our lives--the climactic scene, in which Sean finally breaks through to Will by gently reminding him that all the trouble that's befallen him in his life is not his fault never fails to get me choked up and teary-eyed.  Will's story is that of a misunderstood soul trying to get through life the only way he knows how--the hard way.  It takes a kindred spirit to get him to see that it doesn't have to be like that, and that he can do much better for himself.  Even his blue-collar friends, none of whom has more than middling prospects in life, know he's special and want to see him succeed.It's a great movie, and if you have a soft spot for Boston, you'll have another reason to enjoy this gem.

If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).The theme of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down.For one, Will Hunting is not a ""good"" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? Worse, he's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, ""What the f*** do you want?"" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, ""Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?"" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film.In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived.I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama.Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows.The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested.Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, ""Good Will Hunting"" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsgrd is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.GRADE: C+",3,"F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,3422,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'talk', ""'m"", 'just', 'poking', 'fun', 'characters', 'film', 'find', 'blurb', 'offensive', ""'d"", 'better', 'skip', 'movie', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', '1997', 'story', 'young', 'genius', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'South', 'Boston', 'janitor', 'MIT', 'A', 'Math', 'professor', 'Lambeau', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'difficult', 'problem', 'board', 'amazed', 'discover', 'Will', 'Will', 'trouble', 'law', 'Lambeau', 'succor', 'help', 'psychologist', 'Sean', 'Maguire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'get', 'right', 'path', 'Meanwhile', 'Will', 'falling', 'Harvard', 'girl', 'Minnie', 'Driver', '.The', 'theme', 'genius', 'janitor', 'great', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'couple', 'things', 'really', 'bog', 'down.For', 'one', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'title', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'being', 'ironic', 'fact', 'so', 'smart', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'know', 'smoking', 'will', 'destroy', 'body', 'send', 'early', 'grave', 'Worse', 'arrogant', 'unnecessarily', 'mean', 'instance', 'Professor', 'Lambeau', 'jail', 'Will', 'first', 'words', 'are', 'What', 'f***', 'do', 'want', 'Could', 'anyone', 'be', 'stupid', 'How', 'about', 'Hi', ""'m"", 'Will', 'Who', 'are', 'Sir', 'get', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'abused', 'kid', '99', '%', 'guys', 'tough', 'neighborhoods', 'who', 'were', 'abused', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'unnecessary', 'sheet', 'Will', 'film.In', 'fact', 'too', 'much', 'cussing', 'rings', 'untrue', 'Will', 'three', 'friends', 'South', 'Boston', 'including', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'use', 'f-word', 'practically', 'other', 'word', 'inauthentic', 'chord', 'Yes', 'get', ""'re"", 'trying', 'act', 'hooligans', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'contrived.I', 'should', 'add', 'hail', 'hooligan-oriented', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'gang', 'cussed', 'drank', 'smoked', 'sailors', 'even', 'could', 'construe', 'eight', 'words', 'together', 'throwing', 'f-word', 'have', 'problem', 'realistic', 'cussing', 'films', 'fact', 'prefer', 'when', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'artificial', 'drama.Furthermore', 'Damon', ""n't"", 'LOOK', 'tough', 'guy', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Ben', 'little', 'better', 'Matt', 'miscast', 'just', 'too', 'soft', 'baby-face', 'think', 'knew', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'tough', 'punk', 'fact', 'main', 'protagonist', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'away', 'story', 'Who', 'disrespectful', 'punk', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'better', 'genius', 'not', 'result', 'drama', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'compelling', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'When', 'Sean', 'Williams', 'finally', 'Will', 'break', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'interested.Still', 'can', 'handle', 'trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough', 'acting', 'dialog', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'worth', 'catching', 'like', 'dramas', 'one', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'great', 'atypical', 'role', 'serious', 'psycho-therapist', 'who', 'able', 'handle', 'Will', 'overcome', 'genius', 'defense', 'mechanisms', 'Skarsgrd', 'also', 'excellent', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'criticisms', 'wrong', 'way', 'IS', 'good', 'drama', 'film', 'buried', 'underneath', 'contrived', 'writing', 'corresponding', 'performances', 'mainly', 'Matt', 'Ben', '.Incidentally', 'Minnie', 'Matt', 'hooked', 'up', 'movie', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'are', 'real.The', 'film', '126', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Massachusetts', 'Toronto.GRADE', 'C+']",Good Will Hunting

81418,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,0788814664,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[2, 12]","In GOOD WILL HUNTING, the film was intriguing when Will Hunting, (Matt Damon), a night custodian, solves the math equation on the hallway chalkboard at the University and the Math Professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgrd-EXCORCIST: THE BEGINNING) trying to figure out who did it.  This reviewer thought that this was going to be the main focus of the film in which Will Hunting was going to be put to the test on his math genius.  However, that's not the case.  The audience finds out Will Hunting has a chip on his shoulder, a bad attitude, a criminal record, and needs psychological analysis. Once the film establishes the fact that we know of Will Hunting's high inteligence, it shifts to trying to find out why he's such an angry young man. The character of  Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) comes into play as the therapist to dig into Hunting's psyche and then a side-plot of a romance with Skylar (Minnie Driver- RETURN TO ME)is added to complicate matters. These two aspects of the film overtakes the rest of the film and it becomes maudlin and unfocused. We see a mutual respect develop between Hunting and McGuire, but the romance between Hunting and Skylar is a distraction especially when it becomes the basis of the ending of the film when Will Hunting has to make a decision on his future. In conclusion, the film's initial set-up or first quarter of the film was great when showing Will Hunting's genius behind the working class exterior, but the film shifts to trying to psychoanalyze him along with his stormy relationship with Skylar and it becomes uninteresting and unwatchable.",2,So-So Will Hunting,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,1590,"['GOOD', 'WILL', 'HUNTING', 'film', 'was', 'intriguing', 'when', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'night', 'custodian', 'math', 'equation', 'hallway', 'chalkboard', 'University', 'Math', 'Professor', 'Lambeau', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd-EXCORCIST', 'THE', 'BEGINNING', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'put', 'test', 'math', 'genius', 'However', 'not', 'case', 'audience', 'out', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'bad', 'attitude', 'criminal', 'record', 'psychological', 'analysis', 'film', 'fact', 'know', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'high', 'inteligence', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'such', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'character', 'Sean', 'McGuire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'play', 'therapist', 'dig', 'Hunting', 'psyche', 'then', 'side-plot', 'romance', 'Skylar', 'Minnie', 'Driver-', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'ME', 'added', 'complicate', 'matters', 'two', 'aspects', 'film', 'rest', 'film', 'maudlin', 'unfocused', 'see', 'mutual', 'respect', 'develop', 'Hunting', 'McGuire', 'romance', 'Hunting', 'Skylar', 'distraction', 'especially', 'when', 'basis', 'ending', 'film', 'when', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'make', 'decision', 'future', 'conclusion', 'film', 'initial', 'set-up', 'first', 'quarter', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'showing', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'genius', 'working', 'class', 'exterior', 'film', 'shifts', 'trying', 'psychoanalyze', 'along', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'Skylar', 'uninteresting', 'unwatchable']",Good Will Hunting

81420,AP3B615GM191G,0788814664,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 8]","After watching Good Will Hunting, I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction (in this case, novels) that I had previously read: J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", and Stephen King's ""Rage"".  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those efforts, and didn't take to ""Hunting"" any more pleasantly.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on young Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a mathematical genius (of savant proportions) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor (Stellan Skarsgrd).  However, Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation, along with a history of violence, and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy's unique talents.Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I (due to the deep psychological themes), I have never been one much for the ""bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through"" type of storytelling.  To me, Will Hunting was an arrogant, unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film, then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around, and now suddenly I'm supposed to believe that everything is okay?  Not quite.To me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver).  I actually felt that her relationship with Will (and her character altogether) were the high points of the film, not the ""tense"" client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.I realize that I am probably in the minority here, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations.  I found it be pretentious and bloated to be otherwise.",2,"Just Another ""Holden Caufield""",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1878,"['watching', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'struck', 'two', 'similarities', 'other', 'works', 'fiction', 'case', 'novels', 'had', 'previously', 'read', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rage', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'efforts', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'Hunting', 'more', 'pleasantly.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'savant', 'proportions', 'who', 'time', 'mopping', 'floors', 'local', 'university', 'solving', 'complex', 'equation', 'left', 'blackboard', 'catching', 'eye', 'math', 'professor', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'However', 'Will', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'motivation', 'history', 'violence', 'thus', 'sent', 'therapist', 'Sean', 'Maguire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'approach', 'salvaging', 'boy', 'unique', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'due', 'deep', 'psychological', 'themes', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'much', 'bratty', 'youngster', 'character', 'treatise', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'type', 'storytelling', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'arrogant', 'unmotivated', 'jerk', 'beginning', 'film', 'then', 'whole', 'bunch', 'psychological', 'terms/scenarios', 'were', 'thrown', 'around', 'now', 'suddenly', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'everything', 'okay', 'Not', 'quite.To', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'film', 'revolved', 'Hunting', 'potential', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'actually', 'felt', 'relationship', 'Will', 'character', 'altogether', 'were', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'not', 'tense', 'client-therapist', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'steal', 'show.I', 'realize', 'am', 'probably', 'minority', 'here', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'love', 'be', 'wowed', 'psychological', 'scenarios/situations', 'found', 'be', 'pretentious', 'bloated', 'be', 'otherwise']",Good Will Hunting

Mann,"[3, 6]","&quot;GOOD WILL HUNTING&quot; is a brilliant uplifting movie about a guy, Will Hunting(Matt Damon), who is smarter than anyone in the nearby college and could easily get a diploma. Two problems, he doesn't like to show his intellegence, and he doesn't attend the college, he cleans its floors.But soon, Will is seeked out by a college professer, who bails him out of assault charges on two conditions: 1. Will must have math sessions with the professer 2. He must see a sichiatrist once a week.Will goes through 5 of the sichiatrists before he meets Sean(Robin Williams). After 3 or 4 sessions they become close and share thier pasts and thoughts.Then suddenly, Sean and the professer have a violent argument. The professer thinks Will should seek a career in Math, but Sean thinks they should let him choose.All the meanwhile, you're informed of his life outside these happenings. What's great is that everytime he goes out with his friends(Ben Affleck is one of them)or his girlfriend(Minnie Driver), the scenes are fairly well-written, because in other movies, these scenes get to the point as fast as they, this movie is NOT slow, but it does an amazing job in taking its own sweet time.I think that &quot;GOOD WILL HUNTING&quot; is a beautifully made drama with 5 star acting(I still think Matt Damon and Minnie Driver deserved Oscars)and plot.
