I spent the first hour waiting for something to happen, and when it finally did I found it difficult to care.

Hundreds of bare white backsides, or frontsides if you prefer. The third hour was a bit long. This was a loaner, and I fast-forwarded through all the action scenes, so it wasn't so bad.

125814,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0792139771,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 2]","""Braveheart"" was first released in 1995 with an onslaught of positive reviews.  The longevity of the feature, the ability to direct as well as star, as well as the historical topic developed secured Mel Gibson an Oscar win.  His trophies for Best Director as well as Best Feature proved that he was more than just a pretty boy asking top dollar to bring in the audiences - he was excited about the art of filmmaking.  While he did not quite prove it with his film outings afterwards (who can remember the disaster known as ""Conspiracy Theory"" or ""Ransom""), it is in today's growing recycled clich&eacute; Hollywood standard that Mr. Gibson has proven himself.  With two less mainstream success stories under his belt (both ""The Passion of the Christ"" as well as ""Apocalypto""), he has challenged a modern empire and succeeded.  Revisiting Gibson's second directing decision; one must challenge themselves to look beyond the pitfalls, the missing story elements, and the abrupt ending to see the sophomoric feature Gibson gave to us.  ""Braveheart"" isn't perfection, yet it doesn't strive to be - it merely wants to tell a love story set upon the backdrop of historical choices.  Worthy of its wins in 1995, ""Braveheart"" proved to be a bit choppy in 2008, but still a great way to spend nearly three hours.Gibson, to create ""Braveheart"", pulled from every epic imaginable.  His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of ""Spartacus"", ""Gladiator"", and ""Ben-Hur"", yet even with these clich&eacute;s riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice.  Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic.  To begin, the direction is nearly flawless.  A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion.  It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless.  Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered ""beautifully gruesome"", meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish.  His direction showed a realistic view of the battle and filth surrounding Scotland during this dark time, and it is his work behind the camera that continues to make this film rank amongst the greatest ever.  Remember, Gibson won for Best Director and Best Film - which should be kept in mind as we unwrap the other three layers to this film.The next element that one must slice into is the story, which in my eyes, is the weakest element to this film.  While it is emotional to watch the love story unfold, the eye-candy battle sequences, and the picture-esque view of Scotland, there seemed to be a lacking ""meat"" to this story.  Wallace was angered by what happened to his one true love, but we never get the chance to see his years of living with Uncle Argyle come into fruition.  He spouts Latin and French randomly, he uses original battle tactics, and there is talk of Rome at one point, but I wouldn't have found it difficult at all to see a young William Wallace take shape under Argyle.  It would have been impressive to see this hero's roots, to take his passion from more than just his father's death into a whole new realm.  Throughout this film, watching it in 2008, there wasn't much substance to Wallace.  He fought with pride, patriotism, and with his heart, but we never were able to define him as a character.  We knew he could fight - but how?  We knew he loved this girl from the village - but we needed a deeper back story!  The fight scenes were brilliant, but they did not help me see the true William Wallace.  We charged through the film making it from points A to B to C, but never gave us the appetizers in between.  More critical today of films than I was in 1995, perhaps a viewpoint from the English side would have strengthened the background.  I don't believe all English were this harsh, where were the other elements that may have helped Wallace's crusade?  These are just missing pieces that would have strengthened ""Braveheart"" and pushed it to a new level.Needless to say, the next slice is sound.  The power of the battlefield, the yell of Wallace's ""FREEDOM"" and the bagpipes echoing through James Horner's score engulfs the power of the film.  It is the sound that makes ""Braveheart"" the epic that it is.  Without the sounds of battle, without the sounds of the majestic mountains, without the sound of love - this could not have won the awards it did.  As a viewer, it is the most exciting part of this film and the flawless.  While one can argue there are directorial decisions that Gibson could have done better, stronger acting choices, and a more structured story - it is the sound that goes without question.  It is perfection.  Horner's work is mesmerizing and fantastic.  He should have won an Oscar for his sole work on this picture.Finally, there is the acting of ""Braveheart"".  Gibson wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which doesn't surprise me watching it now in 2008.  Gibson, prior to this film, was thought of as the pretty boy/bad boy persona.  Seeing it in the theaters women were swooning over the scantily clad Gibson and that in itself proves that he didn't shake the predetermined image.  There were scenes in which Gibson was smiling, or that his eyes seemed to be bluer than the sky, or that blood seemed to be splattered to an exact location on his body - he seemed to have trouble shaking the beauty of Gibson - and I fault him for that.  The others in the film were decent, but nobody stood out as exemplary.  Coupled with the less meaty story, the characters seemed clich&eacute; ridden.  There was the ""best-friend"", the ""love-interest"", the bad King, and the loyal psychopath - all of which can be seen in any other period piece film.  I don't believe the acting was up to par with the rest of the film, and the Academy noticed.  Gibson played a shaggy Scotsman - it was Mel Gibson - albeit he does a great job with the film, one cannot seem to shake the idea that it is Mel Gibson - and that is why he was awarded no win nor nomination.Overall, despite my best efforts to find major flaws with this film, it is still an amazing piece of cinema to watch.  ""Braveheart"" deserves every award that it has won and others should credit it as the launching pad that finally gave us ""Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"".  Gibson has taken his fame from this film, changed the glamour of it all, and handed us some gritty portraits of the past.  I wish he could have done the same here, but I don't think 1995 was ready for it.  Gibson pushed the envelope with gore and carnage, and it continues to steal your breath away - yet ""Braveheart"" needed to be more than just that.  He couples it with amazing sound, but troubles it with a struggling story and weak characters.  Today, Gibson could shake our minds that he is not Mel Gibson, but in this year - he was that same female dream model.  This is an amazing film.  It deserves a memorable page in our cinematic history, but it isn't perfect.  I believe Mel saw that, and changed it for his post-""Braveheart"" releases.  In a day when our own freedom is put into question, this is the type of film that will stagger your emotions and pull at your heartstrings.  Gibson is a master at his craft, don't get me wrong - this just isn't the sterling image of perfection.  Watch it - over and over.  It may be a long film, but it is worth every minute.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Would you trade your land for freedom?,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,7668,"['Braveheart', 'was', 'first', 'released',

I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review.

The third time, it was merely a good film (this might have been partly because I had just seen Gladiator, but that debate belongs elsewhere).  As an epic, it tends to drag on a bit.  The story is passable, but not as moving or historically accurate as some seem to think.  Mel Gibson does a good job, especially his rousing speech to his army at Stirling (the only truly moving part of the movie).But the battles rule.Starting with a hostile takeover of an English fort and moving on to the insane onrush of two armies simply charging full speed at each other, the battles are possibly some of the most brutally entertaining and involving ever created.  They justify the movie's shortcomings and then some.  The battle of Stirling is the largest of its kind ever filmed.  It stirs the blood to say the least.I wouldn't recommend buying this movie, but I would recommend seeing it at least once if you can get over some rather ugly stuff (like the brutal final torture scene).",4,See it for the battles,975369600,"11 28, 2000",2000,1064,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'entertaining', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'merely', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'partly', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'Gladiator', 'debate', 'belongs', 'elsewhere', 'epic', 'drag', 'bit', 'story', 'passable', 'not', 'moving', 'historically', 'accurate', 'seem', 'think', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'rousing', 'speech', 'army', 'Stirling', 'only', 'truly', 'moving', 'part', 'movie', 'battles', 'rule.Starting', 'hostile', 'takeover', 'English', 'fort', 'moving', 'insane', 'onrush', 'two', 'armies', 'simply', 'charging', 'full', 'speed', 'other', 'battles', 'are', 'possibly', 'most', 'brutally', 'entertaining', 'involving', 'ever', 'created', 'justify', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'then', 'battle', 'Stirling', 'largest', 'kind', 'ever', 'filmed', 'blood', 'say', 'least.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'ugly', 'stuff', 'brutal', 'final', 'torture', 'scene']",N/A

Naturally, the Scots fight back and that's what the movie is all about: fighting against tyranny for freedom.Reminding me of ""The Patriot"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" Mel Gibson plays the role of a man who leads the rebellion against tyranny.  As in The Patriot, he and his men triumph against a stronger force through perseverance, hard work, determination, and brilliant tactics.  The turning point of Braveheart, though, is that he eventually gets captured.  They demand that he renounce his treason and declare allegiance to the king.  Of course he won't.  So they torture him publicly.  They hang him for a few minutes, have his arms and legs tied up and nearly pulled apart by a horse on the end of the rope.  When he finally catches his breath to say something, instead of swearing allegiance to the king and asking forgiveness, he yells, ""FREEEEEEDOOMMMM!!!!!""  Then, they chop off his head.As he said earlier, ""Every man dies, but not every man truly lives,"" there are some things more important than oneself and even one's life.  ""We all have to die eventually, it's only a matter of when, where, and how,""  a paraphrase of another statement of his.  He gave his life to a higher cause.A possible reason he decided to dedicate his life to this cause was because they beheaded his wife since he married her secretly to avoid having her raped on their wedding.  Ironically, he later develops a close and trusting relationship to the Princess of the opposing country.The torture they gave him reminded me of the book, ""1984.""  In this book, the ruling Party is much more effective with political prisoners.  They are deprived of food, water, sleep, and even basic knowledge such as what time of day it is or what became of their friends and family.  They are weakened and broken down, totally controlled by their captors.  A needle in their arm determines when they sleep.  In their cells, they are permitted no conversation or even movement.  Once they are weakened and broken down enough, they are questioned relentlessly about crimes they didn't commit.  So thorough are these brain washing sessions that they eventually believe and admit to crimes they never committed.  The Party ""cleans"" their minds and eventually makes them LOVE their captors, beleiving them to be their saviors from the gross crimes they committed.  The Party allows no martyrs, because the prisoners minds are wiped clean of rebellion and even memory of it.  The memory of the prisoners is wiped out as well.  This process makes it impossible to have any meaning in suffering against the the Party.  In Braveheart, the theme of the movie is that life can have great meaning despite great suffering.",5,Fighting against tyranny for freedom.,1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,2794,"['government', 'taking', 'Scotland', 'trying', 'namely', 'exercising', 'sexual', 'rites', 'women', 'wedding', 'Naturally', 'Scots', 'fight', 'back', 'what', 'movie', 'fighting', 'tyranny', 'freedom.Reminding', 'Patriot', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'rebellion', 'tyranny', 'Patriot', 'men', 'triumph', 'stronger', 'force', 'perseverance', 'hard', 'work', 'determination', 'brilliant', 'tactics', 'turning', 'point', 'Braveheart', 'though', 'eventually', 'captured', 'demand', 'renounce', 'treason', 'declare', 'allegiance', 'king', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'torture', 'publicly', 'hang', 'few', 'minutes', 'have', 'arms', 'legs', 'tied', 'up', 'nearly', 'pulled', 'apart', 'horse', 'end', 'rope', 'When', 'finally', 'breath', 'say', 'something', 'instead', 'swearing', 'allegiance', 'king', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'FREEEEEEDOOMMMM', 'Then', 'chop', 'off', 'head.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'truly', 'are', 'things', 'more', 'important', 'even', 'one', 'life', 'have', 'die', 'eventually', 'only', 'matter', 'when', 'where', 'how', 'paraphrase', 'statement', 'gave', 'life', 'higher', 'cause.A', 'possible', 'reason', 'decided', 'dedicate', 'life', 'cause', 'was', 'beheaded', 'wife', 'married', 'secretly', 'avoid', 'having', 'raped', 'wedding', 'Ironically', 'later', 'close', 'trusting', 'relationship', 'Princess', 'opposing', 'country.The', 'torture', 'gave', 'reminded', 'book', '1984', 'book', 'ruling', 'Party', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'political', 'prisoners', 'are', 'deprived', 'food', 'water', 'sleep', 'even', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'such', 'what', 'time', 'day', 'what', 'became', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'weakened', 'broken', 'down', 'totally', 'controlled', 'captors', 'needle', 'arm', 'determines', 'when', 'sleep', 'cells', 'are', 'permitted', 'conversation', 'even', 'movement', 'are', 'weakened', 'broken', 'down', 'enough', 'are', 'questioned', 'relentlessly', 'crimes', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'thorough', 'are', 'brain', 'washing', 'sessions', 'eventually', 'believe', 'admit', 'crimes', 'never', 'committed', 'Party', 'cleans', 'minds', 'eventually', 'LOVE', 'captors', 'beleiving', 'be', 'saviors', 'gross', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Party', 'martyrs', 'prisoners', 'minds', 'are', 'wiped', 'clean', 'rebellion', 'even', 'memory', 'memory', 'prisoners', 'wiped', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'process', 'impossible', 'have', 'meaning', 'suffering', 'Party', 'Braveheart', 'theme', 'movie', 'life', 'can', 'have', 'great', 'meaning', 'great', 'suffering']",N/A

125822,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792139771,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 12]","Because I know this isn't going to go over well.`Braveheart' is one of those movies that has garnered an impassioned following of supposed cinephiles who are convinced of this film's eternal greatness and hold it in high esteem and consider no fault to be had with regard to its greatness.  It doesn't help that these same devotees usually site it alongside `Forrest Gump' in terms of its greatness and thus lose my overall attention since I can't take that film and its fans seriously.Seriously.But I'm getting off on the wrong foot here.  I don't want this to come across like a middle finger pointed straight at all the five star reviewers here, so I'll try and reword this.  I have found that this film is very popular to those who are told it is great because it won so many Oscars and confuse its epic scope for actual quality.  `Braveheart' is very pretty to look at.  The cinematography is superb and from a technical standpoint, the film still sends chills.  The battle scenes are beautifully cut.  The costumes and production design are stellar.  The score is rapturous when needed (a tad overdone in parts to be honest though) and Mel Gibson's direction can be confused for great because on the outset it appears like he's done a technically savvy job (although I truly account most of the films visual grace to the film editing and cinematography over Gibson's rather clich&eacute;d direction).Still, at the heart of this movie is an emotionally vapid presentation that is masked over by standard heart swelling `root for the underdog' camaraderie and is utterly littered with horrific acting that only bogs down the film's overall impact.This script is just BAD.One thing that I noted rather heavily was the way that Gibson really tried to portray William Wallace as a variation of Jesus Christ himself.  The way he visualizes the man (especially after his capture) is very symbolic and almost tasteless in parts.  In fact, the way that Gibson visualizes this film as a whole is rather distasteful.  There are heavy demeaning elements that bleed forth from Gibson's obvious personal feelings (the film is subtlety sexist and not so subtlety bigoted) and this can at times become overwhelming.  Look at the portrayal of the homosexual Prince.  The first half of the film is no better than a soap opera (those glances are grossly over exaggerated and they do not instill a feeling of love but one of cheesy fabricated emotions).I've debated this a thousand times with my friends.  `Gladiator', while heavily influenced by this film, trumps it by a hundred fold for the simple reason that Ridley Scott understood how to craft a film that felt organic and honest as opposed to vapidly misleading.And Russell Crowe's soulful portrayal of Maximus is leagues above the self-promotion that Gibson lathers all over William.It is technically beautiful, and Sophie Marceau is not only stunning but she delivers a marvelous performance that is too good to be a part of this overrated fluff.  Still, `Braveheart' is not a good film; like at all.And that ending is ridiculous.",3,It's with a very brave heart that I write this review...,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,3075,"['know', ""n't"", 'going', 'go', 'over', 'well.', 'Braveheart', 'one', 'movies', 'garnered', 'impassioned', 'following', 'supposed', 'cinephiles', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'film', 'eternal', 'greatness', 'hold', 'high', 'esteem', 'consider', 'fault', 'be', 'had', 'regard', 'greatness', ""n't"", 'help', 'same', 'devotees', 'usually', 'site', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'terms', 'greatness', 'thus', 'lose', 'overall', 'attention', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'fans', 'seriously.Seriously.But', ""'m"", 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'come', 'middle', 'finger', 'pointed', 'straight', 'five', 'star', 'reviewers', 'here', ""'ll"", 'try', 'reword', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'popular', 'who', 'are', 'told', 'great', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'Oscars', 'confuse', 'epic', 'scope', 'actual', 'quality', 'Braveheart', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'still', 'chills', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'cut', 'costumes', 'production', 'design', 'are', 'stellar', 'score', 'rapturous', 'when', 'needed', 'tad', 'overdone', 'parts', 'be', 'honest', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'direction', 'can', 'be', 'confused', 'great', 'outset', 'done', 'technically', 'savvy', 'job', 'truly', 'account', 'most', 'films', 'visual', 'grace', 'film', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'Gibson', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'direction', '.Still', 'heart', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'vapid', 'presentation', 'masked', 'standard', 'heart', 'swelling', 'root', 'underdog', 'camaraderie', 'utterly', 'littered', 'horrific', 'acting', 'only', 'bogs', 'down', 'film', 'overall', 'impact.This', 'script', 'just', 'BAD.One', 'thing', 'noted', 'rather', 'heavily', 'was', 'way', 'Gibson', 'really', 'tried', 'portray', 'William', 'Wallace', 'variation', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'way', 'man', 'especially', 'capture', 'very', 'symbolic', 'almost', 'tasteless', 'parts', 'fact', 'way', 'Gibson', 'film', 'whole', 'rather', 'distasteful', 'are', 'heavy', 'demeaning', 'elements', 'bleed', 'forth', 'Gibson', 'obvious', 'personal', 'feelings', 'film', 'subtlety', 'sexist', 'not', 'so', 'subtlety', 'bigoted', 'can', 'times', 'become', 'overwhelming', 'Look', 'portrayal', 'homosexual', 'Prince', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'better', 'soap', 'opera', 'glances', 'are', 'grossly', 'exaggerated', 'do', 'not', 'instill', 'feeling', 'love', 'one', 'cheesy', 'fabricated', 'emotions', '.I', ""'ve"", 'debated', 'thousand', 'times', 'friends', 'Gladiator', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'film', 'trumps', 'hundred', 'fold', 'simple', 'reason', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'understood', 'how', 'craft', 'film', 'felt', 'organic', 'honest', 'opposed', 'vapidly', 'misleading.And', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'soulful', 'portrayal', 'Maximus', 'leagues', 'self-promotion', 'Gibson', 'lathers', 'William.It', 'technically', 'beautiful', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'not', 'only', 'stunning', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'part', 'overrated', 'fluff', 'Still', 'Braveheart', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'all.And', 'ending', 'ridiculous']",N/A

The movie is historically inaccurate, but  its job is to tell a story and to put across a message, that of the English  being total bastards and the Scots being pristene...  The battle of  Stirling was known as the battle of Stirling Bridge...  the Scots waited  until the English were on the bridge, and against chivalric law attacked  before they were ready, raining arrows on them and collapsing the bridge  and continuing to slaughter the English as they drowned in the river.

I do not view this movie as an accurate portrayal of William Wallace or Robert the Bruce - nor is it what the rating is based on.  Obviously plenty of liberties were taken with history.  The movie is great because it's a good story well told.Braveheart is about the war for Scottish independence in the 13th century and the historical William Wallace who led the initial phases of the revolt.  Wallace is portrayed as a man of deep principle who wanted peace but wanted freedom for his countrymen more.The large battle scenes and the leadership of Wallace are awesomely portrayed, as is the untenable position of Robert the Bruce.  Bruce is caught between the Scottish nobles who prefer land, wealth, and favoritism from the British crown to freedom and safety for their Scottish brethren, and William Wallace, whom he could ally with to fight for freedom, but at the potential cost of his life, land, and status.  Robert the Bruce's internal struggle was well captured on screen.The only problem I had with the movie and story - but a minor one really - is the unlikely liaison between Wallace and the Princess of Wales.  Even in a fictional account of William Wallace, this seemed like a terribly unlikely event.  But in the scheme of things, this is a minor quibble.",5,Outstanding Epic Drama,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,1403,"['watched', 'Braveheart', 'again', 'weekend', 'truly', 'excellent', 'epic', 'drama', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'table', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'view', 'movie', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'what', 'rating', 'based', 'Obviously', 'plenty', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'history', 'movie', 'great', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'told.Braveheart', 'war', 'Scottish', 'independence', '13th', 'century', 'historical', 'William', 'Wallace', 'who', 'led', 'initial', 'phases', 'revolt', 'Wallace', 'portrayed', 'man', 'deep', 'principle', 'who', 'wanted', 'peace', 'wanted', 'freedom', 'countrymen', 'more.The', 'large', 'battle', 'scenes', 'leadership', 'Wallace', 'are', 'awesomely', 'portrayed', 'untenable', 'position', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'caught', 'Scottish', 'nobles', 'who', 'prefer', 'land', 'wealth', 'favoritism', 'British', 'crown', 'freedom', 'safety', 'Scottish', 'brethren', 'William', 'Wallace', 'whom', 'could', 'ally', 'fight', 'freedom', 'potential', 'cost', 'life', 'land', 'status', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'internal', 'struggle', 'was', 'well', 'captured', 'screen.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'story', 'minor', 'one', 'really', 'unlikely', 'liaison', 'Wallace', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'Even', 'fictional', 'account', 'William', 'Wallace', 'seemed', 'terribly', 'unlikely', 'event', 'scheme', 'things', 'minor', 'quibble']",N/A
125840,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0792139771,C. B Collins Jr.,"[6, 10]","It has been 12 years since Braveheart won the Academy Award for best picture and a release on DVD allows us to review this film in 2007 to determine its continued merit. Does it measure up?Yes and No.I gave the film 4 stars because on the whole the film remains strong after 12 years. The scenes of the Scotish landscape and weather conditions were highly realistic and beautiful. The architectural structures, whether they were peasant huts or fortress castles, were very impressive and facilitated the plot and mood of the film in a way that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy captures 7 years later after the release of Braveheart. The filth of common life in 1290 is captured well, for even the highest nobility were vermin infested and encrusted with dirt. The acting of Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was superb, the best acting job in the whole film. Catherine McCormack as Murron and Sophie Marceau as French Princess Isabella were both excellent casting choices for while both beautiful, McCormack captures the beauty of a strong healthy peasant while Marceau captures the worldly sophisticated beauty of a woman destined for power.  The cinematography was exceptional. One final strength to the film that is certainly relevant to our time, which is that battle against native insurgency is never predictable. Longshanks was extremely lucky that for the most part the Scottish insurgency was willing to fight him face to face in traditional warfare (at least for that time and place) rather than engage in underground gurilla warfare, which is often the choice of insurgent populations.What are the drawbacks?First, considerable historic license was taken to make the film more dramatic and romantic than history would indicate was the actual sequence of events. Second, the violence was a bit over-the-top with terrible scenes of torture and warfare. Third, Gibson was 20 years older than the young William Wallace who began his campaign when he was between 20 and 24 and died before he was 36. Fourth, the film is actually a bit too long. It is a 3 hour film that could have been shortened to 2 hours with little lost in terms of story or atmosphere. The fifth drawback is that by today's standards, the depiction of King Edward I could be seen as homophobic. History would imply that King Edward I was homosexual, but this film equates homosexuality with physical and emotional weakness.Overall, the film holds up to time and remains entertaining after 12 years.",4,"After 12 years, the film still entertains despite a few flaws.",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2469,"['been', '12', 'years', 'Braveheart', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'release', 'DVD', 'review', 'film', '2007', 'determine', 'continued', 'merit', 'measure', 'up', 'Yes', 'No.I', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'whole', 'film', 'strong', '12', 'years', 'scenes', 'Scotish', 'landscape', 'weather', 'conditions', 'were', 'highly', 'realistic', 'beautiful', 'architectural', 'structures', 'were', 'peasant', 'huts', 'fortress', 'castles', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'facilitated', 'plot', 'mood', 'film', 'way', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', '7', 'years', 'later', 'release', 'Braveheart', 'filth', 'common', 'life', '1290', 'captured', 'well', 'even', 'highest', 'nobility', 'were', 'vermin', 'infested', 'encrusted', 'dirt', 'acting', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'Longshanks', 'was', 'superb', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'whole', 'film', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'Murron', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'French', 'Princess', 'Isabella', 'were', 'excellent', 'casting', 'choices', 'beautiful', 'McCormack', 'beauty', 'strong', 'healthy', 'peasant', 'Marceau', 'worldly', 'sophisticated', 'beauty', 'woman', 'destined', 'power', 'cinematography', 'was', 'exceptional', 'One', 'final', 'strength', 'film', 'certainly', 'relevant', 'time', 'battle', 'native', 'insurgency', 'never', 'predictable', 'Longshanks', 'was', 'extremely', 'lucky', 'most', 'part', 'Scottish', 'insurgency', 'was', 'willing', 'fight', 'face', 'face', 'traditional', 'warfare', 'least', 'time', 'place', 'rather', 'engage', 'underground', 'gurilla', 'warfare', 'often', 'choice', 'insurgent', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'First', 'considerable', 'historic', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'history', 'would', 'indicate', 'was', 'actual', 'sequence', 'events', 'Second', 'violence', 'was', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'terrible', 'scenes', 'torture', 'warfare', 'Third', 'Gibson', 'was', '20', 'years', 'older', 'young', 'William', 'Wallace', 'who', 'began', 'campaign', 'when', 'was', '20', '24', 'died', 'was', '36', 'Fourth', 'film', 'actually', 'bit', 'too', 'long', '3', 'hour', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', '2', 'hours', 'little', 'lost', 'terms', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'fifth', 'drawback', 'today', 'standards', 'depiction', 'King', 'Edward', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'homophobic', 'History', 'would', 'imply', 'King', 'Edward', 'was', 'homosexual', 'film', 'homosexuality', 'physical', 'emotional', 'weakness.Overall', 'film', 'time', 'entertaining', '12', 'years']",N/A

There are some minor flaws in the film (where did the spears come from at Stirling?) but overall it is excellently imagined and portrayed.  The combat is grisly and powerful.I'm not going to go into the story much, as I feel that providing spoilers really detracts from a review.  In this film are some cliched approaches to medieval legend.  Oppressive king.  Valiant rebel.  Woman in danger.  There are also a few stereotypes that are not necessary for the advancement of the story.  Overall, though, this is one of the most powerful emotional dramas I've ever watched.  Normally action films are short on drama.  Mel Gibson doesn't fall into that trap here.What is truly remarkable is the sympathy garnered for the lead character, William Wallace, who loses everything when he only desires to have peace and raise a family.  His response to not having what he desires is overwhelming and precisely expressed.  When he loses everything at the point of a knife, he rebels against everything that comes from the English king.  He takes the absolute position that so long as there is no justice then there will be no peace for the English tyrant.This is an epic movie that was long overdue from the movie industry.  It is epic and legendary for the stunning visual effects.  The battle scenes are powerful looks at what battles from that era were probably like, although the specific geography for the actual effort at revolt is rejected in order to make the combat more grand and powerful.In the end the legendary Wallace is elevated to almost Messianic levels and the audience is driven to a white hot passion for freedom and patriotism.This is probably the best work Mel Gibson ever contributed to the movie world.

It's a rousing speech that drives a group of historical underdogs to victory in a battle that they certainly had no business winning. And as an added bonus Americans love the concept of freedom. So even though we aren't free at all the image of Mel Gibson up there screaming, ""But they can never take....our FREEDOM!!!"" is just the kind of foot stomping jolt that can fool the masses into caring about Scottish history. The film itself hasn't done too bad either, winning that best picture statue and all, and it is a perfectly solid throw back to an earlier time. Wallace fights bloody, beautifully show battles to avenge the murder of his bride and to promote ""freedom"" in the face of British imperialism (13th Century Style). The characters are broadly drawn (the crazy Irishman, the dim witted brute, the evil King) and the plot is less than adventurous. The values pander to a middle class audience (have a family, brains over brawns, don't rape brides on their wedding days) so all in all the average movie goer is well taken care of. I even caught myself becoming emotionally involved in the cause of the Scots, but that could just be due to the anti-imperialist in me. Gibson, as director, is able to produce real magic with some of his shots and nothing he does here takes away from his reputation as a born storyteller.What was most interesting to me was to see how much of this film foretold the future of Gibson's oeuvre. We have a trip into an obscure moment in history that ultimately results in a pretty conventional action flick (""Apocalypto""). We see his obsession with all things Christ and torture related (""Passion of the Christ""). And yes I know he didn't direct it but we see a dumbed down, Americanized version of this exact story in ""The Patriot."" I liked this movie and I liked ""The Patriot"" but now I'm questioning whether or not it was only made to sell the same tale to xenophobic types who aren't comfortable rooting for non-Americans. Who knows. I do know that I respect his ability to cater to modern tastes in an attempt to school people on parts of history that they should know about and would find entertaining. Unlike his hero, Gibson is willing to compromise. And while that may mean that this is not a great film it does mean that he reached a far greater audience than had he strictly stuck to the script that the history books provide. ***1/2",3,Gibson's Prophetic Masterpiece,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2479,"['now', 'William', 'Wallace', 'battle', 'cry', 'freedom', 'gone', 'down', 'cinematic', 'history', 'why', 'not', 'rousing', 'speech', 'group', 'historical', 'underdogs', 'victory', 'battle', 'certainly', 'had', 'business', 'winning', 'added', 'bonus', 'Americans', 'love', 'concept', 'freedom', 'So', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'free', 'image', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'there', 'screaming', 'can', 'never', 'take', 'FREEDOM', 'just', 'kind', 'foot', 'stomping', 'jolt', 'can', 'fool', 'masses', 'caring', 'Scottish', 'history', 'film', ""n't"", 'done', 'too', 'bad', 'winning', 'best', 'picture', 'statue', 'perfectly', 'solid', 'throw', 'back', 'earlier', 'time', 'Wallace', 'fights', 'bloody', 'beautifully', 'show', 'battles', 'avenge', 'murder', 'bride', 'promote', 'freedom', 'face', 'British', 'imperialism', '13th', 'Century', 'Style', 'characters', 'are', 'broadly', 'drawn', 'crazy', 'Irishman', 'dim', 'witted', 'brute', 'evil', 'King', 'plot', 'less', 'adventurous', 'values', 'pander', 'middle', 'class', 'audience', 'have', 'family', 'brawns', 'do', ""n't"", 'rape', 'brides', 'wedding', 'days', 'so', 'all', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'well', 'taken', 'care', 'even', 'caught', 'becoming', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'cause', 'Scots', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'due', 'anti-imperialist', 'Gibson', 'director', 'able', 'produce', 'real', 'magic', 'shots', 'nothing', 'here', 'away', 'reputation', 'born', 'storyteller.What', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'foretold', 'future', 'Gibson', 'oeuvre', 'have', 'trip', 'obscure', 'moment', 'history', 'ultimately', 'results', 'pretty', 'conventional', 'action', 'flick', 'Apocalypto', 'see', 'obsession', 'things', 'Christ', 'torture', 'related', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'yes', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'see', 'dumbed', 'down', 'Americanized', 'version', 'exact', 'story', 'Patriot', 'liked', 'movie', 'liked', 'Patriot', 'now', ""'m"", 'questioning', 'not', 'was', 'only', 'made', 'sell', 'same', 'tale', 'xenophobic', 'types', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'rooting', 'non-Americans', 'Who', 'do', 'know', 'respect', 'ability', 'cater', 'modern', 'tastes', 'attempt', 'school', 'people', 'parts', 'history', 'should', 'know', 'would', 'find', 'entertaining', 'hero', 'Gibson', 'willing', 'compromise', 'may', 'mean', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'mean', 'reached', 'far', 'greater', 'audience', 'had', 'strictly', 'stuck', 'script', 'history', 'books', 'provide', '***1/2']",N/A

But, parts of the movie didn't look very good.  Some scenes had grain (mostly in the background, but some in the faces).  Some scenes didn't even look like a Blu-Ray should look.  Most of the movie looked ""high-def"", but some of it didn't.  Overall, I give it 9.0 to 9.5, on a scale from 1-10.  I am not disappointed, nor do I feel ""ripped off"" with the video quality, like I have with other movies.  I just don't think it is as good as more recent movies, and I wouldn't call it ""excellent.""The audio quality could have been better.  It was Dolby TrueHD 5.1, but most of the sound came from the center speaker, with some coming from the front left and right speakers.  I had to walk right up to my surround speakers to hear any sound.  I didn't notice any surround sound from where I was sitting.  And, most of the sounds from the battle scenes came out of the center speaker.  There wasn't much battle sound coming from the front left and right speakers. If I stood right next to the front speakers, I could hear swords clashing - but it wasn't very loud.  There also wasn't much sub-woofer bass, although I thought I could hear it at times.Before you criticize my review, watch it again on Blu-Ray, and pay attention to the audio and video quality.This is not one of my favorite movies, even though it is good.  I enjoy Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" movie more.  One thing I didn't catch, is what happened to John Wallace (William's brother)?  I thought he was the young kid who punched young William at the beginning of the movie, but, he suddenly disappeared from the movie. Was he in the movie as an adult?  I thought young William could have killed John for punching him, but I replayed that part, and it didn't show any evidence of that.  The movie credits at the end had a young William, and a William, but only a John Wallace (no young or old John).",4,"Mostly Great Video, Disappointing Audio",1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,1987,"['Please', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'when', 'review', 'Blu-Ray.The', 'video', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'times', 'parts', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'had', 'grain', 'mostly', 'background', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'Blu-Ray', 'should', 'look', 'Most', 'movie', 'looked', 'high-def', 'did', ""n't"", 'Overall', 'give', '9.0', '9.5', 'scale', '1-10', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'do', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'video', 'quality', 'have', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'good', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'excellent', 'audio', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'most', 'sound', 'came', 'center', 'speaker', 'coming', 'front', 'left', 'right', 'speakers', 'had', 'walk', 'right', 'up', 'surround', 'speakers', 'hear', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'surround', 'sound', 'where', 'was', 'sitting', 'most', 'sounds', 'battle', 'scenes', 'came', 'center', 'speaker', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'battle', 'sound', 'coming', 'front', 'left', 'right', 'speakers', 'stood', 'right', 'next', 'front', 'speakers', 'could', 'hear', 'swords', 'clashing', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'loud', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'sub-woofer', 'bass', 'thought', 'could', 'hear', 'criticize', 'review', 'watch', 'again', 'Blu-Ray', 'pay', 'attention', 'audio', 'video', 'quality.This', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'even', 'good', 'enjoy', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Patriot', 'movie', 'more', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'what', 'happened', 'John', 'Wallace', 'William', 'brother', 'thought', 'was', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'punched', 'young', 'William', 'beginning', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'movie', 'Was', 'movie', 'adult', 'thought', 'young', 'William', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'John', 'punching', 'replayed', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'evidence', 'movie', 'credits', 'end', 'had', 'young', 'William', 'William', 'only', 'John', 'Wallace', 'young', 'old', 'John']",N/A

He's taken in by his uncle who proceeds to teach him languages, history, and take him as far as Rome on pilgramages. When he gets back, fully mature, he just wants to settle down with his love, Murron. However, the King invokes the First Night law, a law where if a Scottish couple marry, one of the British officers gets to have the wife for a night.Not wanting to share his love, William marrys in secret. However, an Englishman finds out and kills his wife. There he just sets off attacking forces for the freedom of Scotland.Very powerful in it's message, and very brutal.

125854,AUHG8KSHI529U,0792139771,Craig Matteson,"[2, 4]","Let us stipulate that this movie is romance on the book, ""Braveheart"" (by Randall Wallace), which is itself a romance on the very real Scotts hero, William Wallace.  In those two steps of fictionalization, loosely based on history, more than a few facts can float off into the ether.  You can easily search the web and find any number of websites that will list all the errors in the movie.  There was even a show in the History Channel discussing the reality of Wallace's life versus the movie and why certain choices were made, such as fighting the battle of Stirling Bridge on a field in the movie rather than on a bridge as it was in real life.  Never mind the fact of the real life ages of the characters making most of the interactions in the movie absolutely impossible.And while all comparisons of fact and fiction are interesting, two facts remain:  the movie made the name of William Wallace more popularly known than he had been in centuries, and it is a very effective and exciting movie.  Believe me, I understand the pain of those who truly love Wallace and feel that their hero has been disgraced and cheated.  It is almost always true that facts suffer greatly when compressed into the constraints of a movie and those that know the facts understand how they add to the meaning and purpose of their hero.  They resent any compromise or cheapening for simple expediency or catering to popular appetites.  This is all fair and true.  However, this movie is a fiction of a fiction of based on real figures.  In a way, it is the opposite of the old ""Dragnet"" show.  The events are fiction; only the names have been kept.Leaving history aside, the film is exciting, stirs feelings of patriotism, and allows good to triumph over evil even at death.  In the movie, Wallace has to overcome everything, including the loss of family and betrayal by those who should have been his friends.  He has real fears of what he has to face at the end and it is his faith that provides the foundation of his courage.  That kind of nobility inspires us and stirs our own resolve.The battle scenes, while historically inaccurate to a great degree, are amazing to behold.  There is a lot of gore and violence in these medieval battles.  It is that gore and a couple of gratuitous uses of the medieval f-word that give the movie an R rating more than the brief scene at the grove with Wallace and his new wife.While not one of my all time favorite films, it is very much worth viewing and contemplating.",4,"While a romance on the truth, still very exciting and moving",1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2495,"['Let', 'stipulate', 'movie', 'romance', 'book', 'Braveheart', 'Randall', 'Wallace', 'romance', 'very', 'real', 'Scotts', 'hero', 'William', 'Wallace', 'two', 'steps', 'fictionalization', 'loosely', 'based', 'history', 'more', 'few', 'facts', 'can', 'float', 'off', 'ether', 'can', 'easily', 'search', 'web', 'find', 'number', 'websites', 'will', 'list', 'errors', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'show', 'History', 'Channel', 'discussing', 'reality', 'Wallace', 'life', 'movie', 'why', 'certain', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'such', 'fighting', 'battle', 'Stirling', 'Bridge', 'field', 'movie', 'rather', 'bridge', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', 'real', 'life', 'ages', 'characters', 'making', 'most', 'interactions', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'impossible.And', 'comparisons', 'fact', 'fiction', 'are', 'interesting', 'two', 'facts', 'remain', 'movie', 'made', 'name', 'William', 'Wallace', 'more', 'popularly', 'known', 'had', 'been', 'centuries', 'very', 'effective', 'exciting', 'movie', 'Believe', 'understand', 'pain', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'Wallace', 'feel', 'hero', 'been', 'disgraced', 'cheated', 'almost', 'always', 'true', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'when', 'compressed', 'constraints', 'movie', 'know', 'facts', 'understand', 'how', 'add', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'hero', 'resent', 'compromise', 'cheapening', 'simple', 'expediency', 'catering', 'popular', 'appetites', 'fair', 'true', 'However', 'movie', 'fiction', 'fiction', 'based', 'real', 'figures', 'way', 'opposite', 'old', 'Dragnet', 'show', 'events', 'are', 'fiction', 'only', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'kept.Leaving', 'history', 'aside', 'film', 'exciting', 'stirs', 'feelings', 'patriotism', 'good', 'triumph', 'evil', 'even', 'death', 'movie', 'Wallace', 'overcome', 'everything', 'including', 'loss', 'family', 'betrayal', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'real', 'fears', 'what', 'face', 'end', 'faith', 'foundation', 'courage', 'kind', 'nobility', 'inspires', 'stirs', 'own', 'resolve.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'great', 'degree', 'are', 'amazing', 'behold', 'lot', 'gore', 'violence', 'medieval', 'battles', 'gore', 'couple', 'gratuitous', 'uses', 'medieval', 'f-word', 'give', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'more', 'brief', 'scene', 'grove', 'Wallace', 'new', 'wife.While', 'not', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'viewing', 'contemplating']",N/A

Although my family Kilt is about the ugliest thing around I do keep as much to do with my heritage as possible around. And this movie is a part of that heritage, sort of. Well, not the movie itself, but the subject matter. Some of the battles took place in Sterling, and Sterling has a lot of history for my family, a dark and sinsiter history to be sure, and one that would make a great movie in and of itself. So because this movie was filmed on location my dad broke the traditional LDS ban on R-Rated movies when I was a kid (a ban that I do not place on myself now that I'm living on my own) to let us see this movie. According to our genology we had relatives that were actively involved with the epic battle this movie is based upon.The movie is perhaps one of the finest movies ever created, deep, passonate, and intense.. albiet fictionalized. (I doubt that William Wallace actually got the princess pregnate, and while I'm no expert I don't think they even actually met. The story revolves around the Brittish opression of the Scottish people, and one mans very personal battle to rid Scottland of Brittish influence forever. The acting in this film as superb, and the cinematography is sweeping. The battles are realistically bloody and give one a realistic glips into the horrors of midevel warfare, and the reason that fedual systems of government are a bad idea. But the real reason to buy this movie is how deeply passionate the movie really is. The filmmakers really cared about this story, and put thier hearts and souls into it and it shows. If more movies had this kind of love put into the projects, if cinematographers would love the projects as much as these guys did, the cinematography, acting, score, and attention to detail, then Holywood would not be swimming in the sea of franchise cash cows and mediocrity that it is swimming in now. This movie defines epic and Rated R or not, should be seen by people of all ages.

I was on a movie channel - it's a movie! Braveheart doesn't claim to be (and shouldn't be) a historically accurate representation of the life and times of William Wallace. It's a passionate love story about a pacifist who becomes a warrior because he can no longer accept the tyranny of the Britains. (And for you British folk who are tweaked by this - get over it. It's just a movie and &quot;strange women, lying in ponds, distributing swords, is no basis for a system of government&quot; anyway).

To me, this is just a decent movie.  I can sort of understand its appeal up to a point, but the story has many weaknesses and Mel Gibson seems pretty self-absorbed.First of all, I felt the love story at the beginning was very brief and was skimmed over pretty quickly.  It was a nice love story, but it started and ended with abruptness.  I don't know the history of William Wallace very well, but many parts of the story were confusing.  It was hard to tell why the Scots and Brits were at war with each other, other than the fact that the Brits were oppressing them.  One thing that ruined the movie for me was Mel Gibson's ego.Many unnecessary scenes are filled-up with showing the viewer the coolness of Mel Gibson.  I can't help but think Mr. Gibson was going on an ego-trip, especially with the ending of the film.  The movie prides itself on vague notions of freedom.  Freedom is wonderful, but I think most people now think its corny when the main hero of the film yells, ""Freedom!!"" in one of the final moments of his life.

The viewer is almost immediately immersed  in the true colors of the beautiful vistas (not to mention all the blood),  which is nothing short of a victory over the older VHS versions of the  film. Although most of the scenes are crisp and clear, there are a few in  which the image quality does tend to exhibit a rather grainy appearance,  but again, these instances are few. Sound quality on the DVD is superb,  measuring far above that of VHS. Bass extension is much deeper, and much  more clean and natural sounding. The surround channels are used with vivid  detail, mostly in the battle scenes and when the musical score wraps into  the story.

It is an important presentation of the determination of controlled men for freedom at all personal costs and sacrifices.

Gibson shows that there is nothing to hold a man back when he has lost that which he loves most.

125871,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,0792139771,Edward,"[18, 31]","A vanity production if there ever was one, Mel Gibson's 1995 &quot;Braveheart&quot; is not so much a movie as it is a video game of medieval mayhem. As the 13th Century Scottish rebel Sir William Wallace, Mel makes love to beautiful women, fights gruesome battles, and barks speeches filled with repetitions of those democratic catchwords &quot;country&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;. Aware that the average 14-year old's eyes glaze at the mere mention of the 13th Century, the screenplay by Randall Wallace skims over the English domination of Scotland, quickly resorting to standard blood and guts, while the conflict between the clans and William Wallace's uneasy allegiance are too sketchy to be enlightening. Edward I of England, called Longshanks,is the movie's villain; and he's represented as a sadistic psychopath. In &quot;A History of the English Speaking Peoples&quot; Winston S Churchill says that Edward I &quot;presents us with qualities which are a mixture of the administrative capacity of Henry II and the personal prowess and magnanimity of Coeur de Lion.&quot; Granted, Churchill was somewhat partial to royalty, but another source says Edward I was &quot;at heart a good and honest man.&quot; In a hagiography like &quot;Braveheart&quot; the opposition must look as bad as possible if the hero's murders and arson are going to be represented as sympathetic, so Longshanks gets the shaft. (Shakespeare had to dramatize Richard III as a ruthless child-killer to make justifiable the usurpation of Henry VII, who was the grandfather of Shakespeare's sovereign.) As a director, Mel Gibson is no Eisenstein. As an actor, he woodenly plays Wallace as a peace-loving man who just wants to tend his farm and raise a family. When Edward establishes droit de seigneur in Scotland, Wallace marries in secret, but even then his wife is assaulted by English soldiers. In defending her honor, Wallace starts the rebellion almost by accident; and he soon becomes the hero of the Scottish cause, his followers (in a ludicrously anachronistic touch) chanting &quot;Wah-les! Wah-les! Wah-les!&quot; Little is known of the real William Wallace, the nearest thing to a biography being a poem that may or may not have been written by a bard named Henry the Minstrel about 180 years after Wallace's death. There is no mention of this poem in the movie's credits. Whether or not Wallace was multilingual is anyone's guess, but it's extremely unlikely he had an affair with the future Queen of England, a subplot thrown in to gratify the Harlequin Romance element in the audience. Isabella is depicted here as a yearning soul, but she's known to history as the &quot;she-wolf&quot; because of her cold-blooded betrayal of her husband Edward II. I know a lot of reviewers have said &quot;Lighten up, it's only a movie&quot;, and I would agree if &quot;Braveheart&quot; were not so solemn and sententious. Bending facts is one thing (Sir Walter Scott did it all the time), but then to plaster these distortions across the screen in pseudo-historic splendor is a little dishonest. Now I see that Mel's coming out with a film based on the Passion.

Gibson is excellent as Wallace and was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar.No film library should be without this great film.Highly recommended!Updated 5 Sep 2011:As Amazon will not allow me to do this separately, I'll have to append this here: the Sapphire Blu-ray release of this great film is certainly worth the upgrade from the standard dvd format that I reviewed above.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved and especially the special feature documentaries making this the definitive version of the film to view.  The only thing that would have made this perfect for me is if it was released as a digibook.  Other than that, this blu-ray release is certainly a step up over the dvd and is worthy of the double-dip.Recommended!",4,Worthy Successor To Spartacus As Shining Light Of the Genre!,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,1756,"['What', 'great', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'historical', 'war/battle', 'epics', 'go', 'surely', 'got', 'be', 'top', '5', 'films', 'ever', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'long', ""'d"", 'be', 'forgiven', 'having', 'squeaky', 'bum', 'syndrome', 'ordinary', 'film', 'never', 'even', 'noticed', 'time', 'was', 'enthralled', 'sound', 'quality', 'coming', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'sounded', 'great', 'system', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'overall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'tiny', 'black', 'spots', 'remained', 'too', 'many', 'frames', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'rather', 'sparse', 'as', 'well', 'decent', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'included', 'addition', '2', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'Interesting', 'indeed', 'see', 'what', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'will', 'look', 'when', 'eventually', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'root', 'massive', 'underdog', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'needed', 'courage', 'desire', 'eventually', 'treachery', 'wanton', 'evil', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'really', 'Gibson', 'excellent', 'Wallace', 'was', 'deserving', 'winner', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar.No', 'film', 'library', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'film.Highly', 'recommended', 'Updated', '5', 'Sep', '2011', 'Amazon', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'do', 'separately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'append', 'here', 'Sapphire', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'upgrade', 'standard', 'dvd', 'format', 'reviewed', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'have', 'been', 'vastly', 'improved', 'especially', 'special', 'feature', 'documentaries', 'making', 'definitive', 'version', 'film', 'view', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'was', 'released', 'digibook', 'Other', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'dvd', 'worthy', 'double-dip.Recommended']",N/A

125887,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0792139771,Godly Gadfly,"[7, 16]","Braveheart comes with an impressive list of credentials.  It is regarded as one of Mel Gibson's best performances.  It won five Academy Awarts, including Best Picture.  The musical score by James Horner is one of the all time favorites.  And it is one of the most popular movies of all time.  Billed as an epic historical saga filled with history, love and battle, Braveheart apparently is Hollywood at its best.  But is it really worth all the hype, and is the emperor really wearing any clothes?First of all, the movie takes many historical liberties, deviating substantially from the real account of William Wallace.  For instance, both the ""prima nocta"" legislation, and the suggestion that Wallace fathered a child with Princess Isobelle are fictional.  But poetic license in movie making is not new, and can hardly be sufficient reason for trashing a movie - Braveheart never pretends to be a reconstruction of history.  But it does pretend to be an epic of cinema, and its success in that regard is debatable.The basic plot of Braveheart is quite simple:  Man loves woman.  Woman gets killed by English.  Man gets angry and takes revenge on English killers of woman.  Man helps lead Scotland to freedom from English. Notice something?  While William Wallace is lauded for his efforts to free Scotland, the reality is that he is motivated more by personal revenge and anger over what happened to his wife. His character is ruled more by murderous passion, lust and revenge, than by politics; His actions are more the result of uncontrollable rage than the result of an intelligent desire to liberate his country.  In the process, Wallace stoops to commit some of the same evils as his English oppressors.  Just like the English tried to take his wife, so Wallace ends up bedding the wife of the English crown prince, rather than honoring her marriage to her own husband (who is admittedly a fool, but this doesn't justify adultery).  In principle, Wallace's adultery is just as heinous and dishonoring to her husband as the English's treatment of Wallace's wife dishonored him. But by this point most viewers have already been manipulated to think that this sexual conquest is a good thing; Braveheart clearly presents this adulterous tryst as a delightful thing, and even rewards the adulterous union with a child.This is typical of the moral confusion evident throughout the entire movie.  While it pretends to be an epic about a struggle for freedom, in reality it is little more than a gory action movie with lots of fighting and passion, where the action is governed more by primitive and barbarian feelings and lusts than by reasoned and thoughtful intelligence.  The reasons behind the cry ""Freedom!"" are never explained, aside from the fact that Wallace is filled with rage at losing his wife, and this motivates him to fearless (and at times foolish and unbelievable) acts of ""bravery"".  He's a larger-than-life hero governed by passion without reason; is motivated more by a vengeful passion over his murdered bride than a passion for his country.  It's not surprising that Braveheart is nonetheless popular, because perhaps the masses today are largely governed by the same passions.  This kind of hero is appealing to those accustomed to the ongoing media spectacle which lauds mindless macho men, and brainless brawn.  Despite our advanced technological and educated era, popular culture is largely rendered passive and mindless through the influence of the mass media and thoughtless entertainment.  Perhaps then it's little wonder that we find Braveheart so appealing, that we fail to realize that its attraction is no more enduring than the emperor's new clothes.  And that today we find a more intelligent movie about a principled statesman and leader like ""A Man For All Seasons"" rather boring.Not to say that Braveheart is all bad (although be warned that the violence and gore more than justifies the R rating).  I found it appealing that the movie didn't resort to a feel-good everyone-lived-happily-ever-after type ending.  The final tragic note is powerful, and is not altogether unlike its imitator ""Gladiator"" (2000).  The battle scenes featuring medieval weapons and hundreds of extras create an epic feel, and have to be admired for what they are - although at times the drama is exaggerated.  But when all is said and done, this movie pretends to be more than what it really is. Braveheart turns history into a blood and brainless love story.  It's no more one of the heights of cinema than the Emperor's new clothes are the heights of fashion. - GODLY GADFLY",3,All passion and no brains.,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,4593,"['Braveheart', 'impressive', 'list', 'credentials', 'regarded', 'one', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'performances', 'won', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awarts', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'musical', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'movies', 'time', 'Billed', 'epic', 'historical', 'saga', 'filled', 'history', 'love', 'battle', 'Braveheart', 'apparently', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'really', 'hype', 'emperor', 'really', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'many', 'historical', 'liberties', 'deviating', 'substantially', 'real', 'account', 'William', 'Wallace', 'instance', 'prima', 'nocta', 'legislation', 'suggestion', 'Wallace', 'fathered', 'child', 'Princess', 'Isobelle', 'are', 'fictional', 'poetic', 'license', 'movie', 'making', 'not', 'new', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'sufficient', 'reason', 'trashing', 'movie', 'Braveheart', 'never', 'be', 'reconstruction', 'history', 'pretend', 'be', 'epic', 'cinema', 'success', 'regard', 'debatable.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Braveheart', 'quite', 'simple', 'Man', 'woman', 'Woman', 'killed', 'English', 'Man', 'angry', 'revenge', 'English', 'killers', 'woman', 'Man', 'lead', 'Scotland', 'freedom', 'English', 'Notice', 'something', 'William', 'Wallace', 'lauded', 'efforts', 'free', 'Scotland', 'reality', 'motivated', 'more', 'personal', 'revenge', 'anger', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'character', 'ruled', 'more', 'murderous', 'passion', 'lust', 'revenge', 'politics', 'actions', 'are', 'more', 'result', 'uncontrollable', 'rage', 'result', 'intelligent', 'desire', 'liberate', 'country', 'process', 'Wallace', 'commit', 'same', 'English', 'oppressors', 'Just', 'English', 'tried', 'take', 'wife', 'so', 'Wallace', 'up', 'bedding', 'wife', 'English', 'crown', 'prince', 'rather', 'honoring', 'marriage', 'own', 'husband', 'who', 'admittedly', 'fool', ""n't"", 'justify', 'adultery', 'principle', 'Wallace', 'adultery', 'just', 'as', 'heinous', 'dishonoring', 'husband', 'English', 'treatment', 'Wallace', 'wife', 'dishonored', 'point', 'most', 'viewers', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'manipulated', 'think', 'sexual', 'conquest', 'good', 'thing', 'Braveheart', 'clearly', 'adulterous', 'tryst', 'delightful', 'thing', 'even', 'rewards', 'adulterous', 'union', 'child.This', 'typical', 'moral', 'confusion', 'evident', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'epic', 'struggle', 'freedom', 'reality', 'little', 'more', 'gory', 'action', 'movie', 'lots', 'fighting', 'passion', 'where', 'action', 'governed', 'more', 'primitive', 'barbarian', 'feelings', 'lusts', 'reasoned', 'thoughtful', 'intelligence', 'reasons', 'cry', 'Freedom', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'aside', 'fact', 'Wallace', 'filled', 'rage', 'losing', 'wife', 'fearless', 'times', 'foolish', 'unbelievable', 'acts', 'bravery', 'larger-than-life', 'hero', 'governed', 'passion', 'reason', 'motivated', 'more', 'vengeful', 'passion', 'murdered', 'bride', 'passion', 'country', 'not', 'surprising', 'Braveheart', 'nonetheless', 'popular', 'perhaps', 'masses', 'today', 'are', 'largely', 'governed', 'same', 'passions', 'kind', 'hero', 'appealing', 'accustomed', 'ongoing', 'media', 'spectacle', 'mindless', 'macho', 'men', 'brainless', 'brawn', 'advanced', 'technological', 'educated', 'era', 'popular', 'culture', 'largely', 'rendered', 'passive', 'mindless', 'influence', 'mass', 'media', 'thoughtless', 'entertainment', 'Perhaps', 'then', 'little', 'wonder', 'find', 'Braveheart', 'so', 'appealing', 'fail', 'realize', 'attraction', 'more', 'enduring', 'emperor', 'new', 'clothes', 'today', 'find', 'more', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'principled', 'statesman', 'leader', 'A', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'rather', 'boring.Not', 'say', 'Braveheart', 'bad', 'be', 'warned', 'violence', 'gore', 'more', 'justifies', 'R', 'rating', 'found', 'appealing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'resort', 'feel-good', 'everyone-lived-happily-ever-after', 'type', 'ending', 'final', 'tragic', 'note', 'powerful', 'not', 'altogether', 'imitator', 'Gladiator', '2000', 'battle', 'featuring', 'medieval', 'weapons', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'create', 'epic', 'feel', 'have', 'be', 'admired', 'what', 'are', 'times', 'drama', 'exaggerated', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'Braveheart', 'history', 'blood', 'brainless', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'one', 'heights', 'cinema', 'Emperor', 'new', 'clothes', 'are', 'heights', 'fashion', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

It might have been three hours long, but to me, it seemed like it was over too quickly.THAT's the mark of a good film.Now that I've had the chance to view it several times over, I have to first make note of the numerous problems with the film editing--some of the action sequences are cut haphazardly, and historically, the film isn't as accurate as it might appear; possibly for entertainment purposes (because after all, it's supposed to be a popcorn movie too, right?).I realize that this was a labour of love for Gibson, and as a director, he'd already proven his mettle with the film &quot;Man Without A Face&quot;.  But &quot;Braveheart&quot; took us back to the days of cinematic epics, borrowing liberally from &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, and especially &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

125889,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,0792139771,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 4]","If you take this film as fiction (forgetting its glaring historical accuracies that have been pointed out by many reviewers here), it's very entertaining, filled with massive, epic, breathtaking battle scenes.  I really liked the film when I saw it in a theater, and considering it was only Gibson's 2nd directorial effort (for which he won an Oscar), it's quite a remarkable achievement.Many now make hay of the incredible violence here.  It is violent, gory, insane, bloody, etc., etc..  When I saw the film, I thought it was necessary to tell the story and very well done.  I think many here don't like the violence of this film because of Gibson's questionable behaviours since making this film.  His extreme religious beliefs turn off many people.  His personal behaviour (his rabid anti-Semitism, his sexist comments on women, his alcoholism) is horrible.  Yet, this is still a good film, I think.  I haven't watched it in years, but I enjoyed it very much when it was made.  It is a bit difficult to look at Gibson the same way as I did when this film was made because of his questionable behaviours, but he's still an excellent filmmaker.  All four films he's directed (including The Passion of the Christ, which I recently viewed again and liked it very much the 2nd time around) are very memorable.The film itself is a rather cardboard cutout film, ignoring the complexity of Scottish independence, reducing the story to a simplistic plotline of William Wallace's true love is killed, he gets pissed, helps Scotland become free.  The portrayal of Edward Longshanks (by Patrick McGoohan, of TV's The Prisoner) is good, but Gibson indulges his silly homophobia in the portrayal of Longshanks's son, who would become Edward II, a gay king.  Edward II is portrayed as an effeminate wimp, but in reality, the real Edward II was much more dynamic.  See Derek Jarman's Edward II film for a much more realistic portrayal of this complex historical figure.Overall, the film is still entertaining and rousing.

best films out there. it gave so much inspiration to fight for what you believe in. love, to live it, fight for it, and die for it. strength, to endure pain, loss, and everything else that comes with war. a tale of bravery, honor, and triumph. to win a battle is not what counts, but to fight with heart is what conquers. a truly amazing film. mel gibson exceeded many expectations with both directing/producing and starring in this film. he proved he's more than an actor. although a very talented and gifted man this movie just puts him on top. the story is one of beauty and meant to go down in history. a man that wants nothing to do with battle, but when it touches him and seems to beckon to him and taunt him, he has no choice but to defend what is rightfully his and noone  elses: his freedom. he loses a love so dear at the hands of a coward, he will avenge it. you cross william and you can bet your life is his. in a world of take, take, take, he gives no more. he stands up for a love that is lost, for himself, for the people that follow. he becomes a legend. known to destroy all those who come against him. he is william wallace, a man to be feared. a man who was a nobody, until he fought back. it takes one person to change the world. after scenes and scenes of bloody battles, you never seem to get tired of it. they are very well done, and the fight is so intense you feel as if you're on the sidelines. it goes so deep you find yourself rooting for this man and his cause. his words are enough to move you and his actions are enough to move mountains. he fights, and to the death if he must. because no matter what he knows he's lived a full life, doing and leaving a piece of him wherever he goes. even the king begins to fear him, his son being a coward, he sends his sons wife to negotiate with william about a surrender or a truce, but he does niether. although as a result she ignites something in him he thought he'd never feel again. and she feels the same. so a new love is born. a passion that could never be revealed for it is forbidden. although a brief tender moment is better than to have never felt that way at all. after all he's accomplished, and everything he's done he will always be remembered. but where there are heros there are traitors. and that is his downfall. a dirty trick to capture him and bring him to the king to make an example of him to all others who wish to continue to fight for freedom. all the while facing torture and death he does not relent, or regret anything he has done. not even the sorrowful pleas of his lady love can make him ask for forgiveness to the king. it is torture to see her beg him to stay with her, and gives him the antidote so he won't feel a thing. he doesn't take it. he will go out there and die an honorable death. extremely touching, and you can't help but wince in pain at the sight of his pain. his love for his freedom meant more to him than anything else. he was going to die, but he would never be forgotten. for he left behind more than a legacy. he left his bloodline. excellent movie an absolute must see.",5,"""EVERY MAN DIES, NOT EVERY MAN REALLY LIVES.""",1193443200,"10 27,

I never really watched the film properly until recently. As a frequent cinema-goer since my youth I was not a part of the mid-nineties cultural phenomenon that was Braveheart's release in Scotland. I did turn up at the the cinema, the old Odeon in Edinburgh, but the queue went round the block (the literal term for a blockbuster) and there was no way in hell I was prepared to wait for three hours on a gray September afternoon (a choice I came to regret). Every subsequent attempt since then was blocked. I never rented the video as I didn't want to watch in pan-and-scan. The fact that every single living Scottish person had seen it apart from myself really got on my nerves, and I was quite bitter about it. And then, as the fever died down, I just kind of forgot about it and moved on.Watching it fully as an adult I think I probably enjoy it more now that I would have done as a teenager. It's certainly a huge epic right up there with the best of them. Mel Gibson captures the pretty side of Scotland wonderfully with his scope photography accompanied by James Horner's bittersweet score. The film never really feels three hours long, the time just disappears.Nearly every notable Scottish actor (apart from Connery and Connelly) appears at some point. From the brilliant (Brian Cox) to the dreary and pretentious (Peter Mullan). Keep a lookout for Tommy Flanagan too, in one of his earlier roles.The battle scenes are impressive, but I wish there were more gory. Gibson's first cut of the film was apparently bloodier, I wish it had remained intact. But despite the grim satisfaction of seeing the English aggressors getting splattered the fact that Scotland IS still ruled by England kind renders Wallace's bravery irrelevant. It may have been 700 years ago, but I hate the fact that he ultimately died for nothing. We DON'T have a country of our own, plain and simple.Maybe one day...in my lifetime.The Blu Ray looks and sound great in 2.35:1 1080p and DTS HD-MA.

125896,AMG88KV31ZIIO,0792139771,Jack Crane,"[0, 1]","I used to love Braveheart in high school. I thought it was a great movie. Over time, thanks to DVD's and Blu-Ray, and my expanded knowledge of history, the movie has become a joke. Scottish people won't let us hear the end of it. Wallace's success is a lot easier to understand once you understand how the battle of Stirling was really fought. Once you read about what really happened, it makes the movie a cheat. Furthermore, once you learn something about warfare, you understand that the Scottish Army depicted in the movie would have had no real chance against the English.Couple the historical inaccuracies with the recent revelations of Mel Gibson's psychotic behavior and penchant for Christian-oriented violence in his movies, and it's clear that he only made Braveheart for the execution scene, and nothing more. It appealed to him. After watching Passion of the Christ, it couldn't be more clear.

125897,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0792139771,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","William Wallace, a commoner, is a legend, a myth, a hero for sure in Scotland. In his thirteen century he opposed the rule of the king of England over Scotland and the ruthless colonial attitude of that king and his soldiers. Why a commoner and not a noble? Because the nobles accepted to be paid prisoners, salaried slaves of the king of England. As a commoner he only suffered the ruthless violence from these soldiers and the indifference of these nobles. He started a rebellion against the English and that rebellion actually swept the whole Scotland and climaxed in the battle of Stirling. He had managed to bring the nobles behind the commoners and he got a full victory. He was knighted at once but did not change his logic. So in order to force the king of England to grant Scotland full independence he crossed the border and attacked the English at home. He took and ransacked the city of York, and killed the duke of York, the very nephew of the king of England. But in the next confrontation the nobles betray him and he is defeated after the nobles leave the battlefield. The Bruce gets him off that battlefield in due time. But later on the nobles again will betray him again, attract him in a trap and deliver him to the king of England. He will be duly executed as a traitor. The film evokes that treatment though it remains rather far from the real stuff and the fact that he was executed on the day before the Bartholomew Fair on the Fair ground itself as a festive entertainment added to all the others by the king himself. The point is historical and the film is valuable because of that historical dimension. A commoner could easily bring commoners together and make them fight for their freedom, even their national freedom. That is the birth of popular nationalism, of nationalism as such, the only nationalism that represents some historical progress, that of the people, of simple people. That nationalism is going to develop in Europe over the coming centuries, but we can witness its birth in Scotland here. At the same time the film shows very well that nationalism is in absolute contradiction with feudalism. That nationalism is based on self-pride and individual freedom, and the protection and guarantee of that individual freedom. The right of the first night (the local esquire or noble has the right to make love to the newly wed woman, before her newly wed husband on the evening of their marriage) is one of these unbearable privileges of the nobles. Furthermore, the nobles satisfy themselves very well with the financial dependence on the king of England, as long as it does not question their local dominance in Scotland over the local Scots. They have no real national spirit, and the freedom of the people is not their problem. They have sworn allegiance to the King of England and that guarantees their privileged position and they are quite satiated with that. At the same time we must understand a different approach of feudalism that is no longer very active in our minds. The king was the very secular representative of God due to his appointment by God himself, under the only authority of the Pope who is the direct spiritual representative of God on earth. If such is the reality of feudalism, then no one can question the decisions and acts of the king, certainly not the nobles who are under allegiance towards that king. A duke can fight against a count or another duke, because they are of the level but they cannot fight against the king who is over them. But the surprising element is that the battle of Stirling took place on September 11, 1297 some 80 years after the first signing of the Magna Carta and 30 years after the final acceptance of this Magna Carta that shows how the English nobles and the English Church actually joined against the king to impose onto him some freedoms that were unheard of before. I tend to believe William Wallace was the development of this Magna Carta and that it brought the third social element into the picture, the third estate, the commoners. The defeat is all the more significant, and the execution is also all the more significant. It was more a martyrdom than anything else. We know that a poet, Blind Harry, will turn the oral legend into a myth with his epic poem written at the end of the fifteen century. This film is just the adaptation of this myth.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Creteil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourt",5,The violence is slightly curbed,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,4528,"['William', 'Wallace', 'commoner', 'legend', 'myth', 'hero', 'sure', 'Scotland', 'thirteen', 'century', 'opposed', 'rule', 'king', 'England', 'Scotland', 'ruthless', 'colonial', 'attitude', 'king', 'soldiers', 'Why', 'commoner', 'not', 'noble', 'nobles', 'accepted', 'be', 'paid', 'prisoners', 'salaried', 'slaves', 'king', 'England', 'commoner', 'only', 'suffered', 'ruthless', 'violence', 'soldiers', 'indifference', 'nobles', 'started', 'rebellion', 'English', 'rebellion', 'actually', 'swept', 'whole', 'Scotland', 'climaxed', 'battle', 'Stirling', 'had', 'managed', 'bring', 'nobles', 'commoners', 'got', 'full', 'victory', 'was', 'knighted', 'once', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'logic', 'So', 'order', 'force', 'king', 'England', 'grant', 'Scotland', 'full', 'independence', 'crossed', 'border', 'attacked', 'English', 'home', 'took', 'ransacked', 'city', 'York', 'killed', 'duke', 'York', 'very', 'nephew', 'king', 'England', 'next', 'confrontation', 'nobles', 'betray', 'defeated', 'nobles', 'leave', 'battlefield', 'Bruce', 'off', 'battlefield', 'due', 'time', 'later', 'nobles', 'again', 'will', 'betray', 'again', 'attract', 'trap', 'deliver', 'king', 'England', 'will', 'be', 'duly', 'executed', 'traitor', 'film', 'treatment', 'rather', 'far', 'real', 'stuff', 'fact', 'was', 'executed', 'day', 'Bartholomew', 'Fair', 'Fair', 'ground', 'festive', 'entertainment', 'added', 'others', 'king', 'point', 'historical', 'film', 'valuable', 'historical', 'dimension', 'commoner', 'could', 'easily', 'bring', 'commoners', 'together', 'make', 'fight', 'freedom', 'even', 'national', 'freedom', 'birth', 'popular', 'nationalism', 'nationalism', 'such', 'only', 'nationalism', 'historical', 'progress', 'people', 'simple', 'people', 'nationalism', 'going', 'develop', 'Europe', 'coming', 'centuries', 'can', 'witness', 'birth', 'Scotland', 'here', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'nationalism', 'absolute', 'contradiction', 'feudalism', 'nationalism', 'based', 'self-pride', 'individual', 'freedom', 'protection', 'guarantee', 'individual', 'freedom', 'right', 'first', 'night', 'local', 'esquire', 'noble', 'right', 'make', 'love', 'newly', 'wed', 'woman', 'newly', 'wed', 'husband', 'evening', 'marriage', 'one', 'unbearable', 'privileges', 'nobles', 'Furthermore', 'nobles', 'satisfy', 'very', 'well', 'financial', 'dependence', 'king', 'England', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'question', 'local', 'dominance', 'Scotland', 'local', 'Scots', 'have', 'real', 'national', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'people', 'not', 'problem', 'have', 'sworn', 'allegiance', 'King', 'England', 'privileged', 'position', 'are', 'quite', 'satiated', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'understand', 'different', 'approach', 'feudalism', 'longer', 'very', 'active', 'minds', 'king', 'was', 'very', 'secular', 'representative', 'God', 'due', 'appointment', 'God', 'only', 'authority', 'Pope', 'who', 'direct', 'spiritual', 'representative', 'God', 'earth', 'such', 'reality', 'feudalism', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'question', 'decisions', 'acts', 'king', 'certainly', 'not', 'nobles', 'who', 'are', 'allegiance', 'towards', 'king', 'duke', 'can', 'fight', 'count', 'duke', 'are', 'level', 'can', 'not', 'fight', 'king', 'who', 'surprising', 'element', 'battle', 'Stirling', 'took', 'place', 'September', '11', '1297', '80', 'years', 'first', 'signing', 'Magna', 'Carta', '30', 'years', 'final', 'acceptance', 'Magna', 'Carta', 'how', 'English', 'nobles', 'English', 'Church', 'actually', 'joined', 'king', 'impose', 'freedoms', 'were', 'unheard', 'tend', 'believe', 'William', 'Wallace', 'was', 'development', 'Magna', 'Carta', 'brought', 'third', 'social', 'element', 'picture', 'third', 'estate', 'commoners', 'defeat', 'more', 'significant', 'execution', 'also', 'more', 'significant', 'was', 'more', 'martyrdom', 'anything', 'else', 'know', 'poet', 'Blind', 'Harry', 'will', 'turn', 'oral', 'legend', 'myth', 'epic', 'poem', 'written', 'end', 'fifteen', 'century', 'film', 'just', 'adaptation', 'myth.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Vincennes', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Val', 'de', 'Marne', 'Creteil', 'CEGID', 'Boulogne', 'Billancourt']",N/A

125911,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,0792139771,John,"[3, 5]","Mel Gibson took not only a page, but a whole chapter out of David Lean's book when he directed this. The cinematogrophy is nothing short of brilliant. The sweeping shots of the Scotland countryside, the beautiful fields, the mountains, the forests, etc... are breathtaking. There hasn't been anything like it since Lawrence of Arabia. A bold statement perhaps, seeing as there have been many films made between 1962 and 1995, but I feel confident in making it.Moving on, the actual story in this movie is riveting. It follows the life of a Scottish man named William Wallace (interestingly enough, the script was written by Randal Wallace, a descendent of the real-life main character) who starts a rebellion against England to win Scotland's freedom after an English lord kills his wife.The battle scenes in this movie are the most graphic you will have ever seen. And I'm including SPR. It says on the back of the DVD box that this was rated R for ""brutal medieval warfare"" and it sure as hell isn't kidding. You see people getting shot with arrows, smashed with what looks to be a twenty pound sledge hammer, hacked with swords, stabbed through with spears, and on and on. The worst part for me, though, was when it showed the English lord's throat being slit. For some reason, I just can't stand to see that. It makes me rub my neck and grimace everytime I watch it. I can stand all the other stuff just fine, though. Go figure... Anyway, this isn't one of those movies you watch with your ten year old.The DVD is okay, but nothing real special. The documentary is one of those 25 minute things that is half promotional. You get to see a little about how Mel directed it, and how the battle scenes were shot, but it really leaves something to be desired. The commentary is pretty good, though. It's just Mel, talking about the movie. It's interesting, and that alone makes it better than a lot of commentaries. Overall, you get the feeling that there is a special edition DVD lurking in the future. A movie of this magnitude simply deserves more than a trailer, a commentary, and a little promotional ""documentary"". So, if you truly love this movie, get it now. The sound and picture are simply astounding, and it does have some extras, but if you can wait, I suggest you do.

125918,A18BV4O63DOWNH,0792139771,"""juno2""","[14, 32]","*Braveheart*  must be an influential, if not exactly good, movie:  witness its many imitators  (*Gladiator*, even Gibson's own  *Patriot*).  For the handful who haven't seen it, it chronicles the mythic tale of William Wallace, a Scottish commoner who in the early 14th century successfully engineered a movement for independence from England.  (Well, it was really Robert I who engineered it, but in this movie the Bruce is ineffectual, to put it kindly.  You see, Gibson is portraying WALLACE.)  I'm not going to sit here and bash the film; there are so many others that are more worthy of my disdain.  Let it be said that  *Braveheart*  will remind you of those old Hollywood epics featuring a cast of thousands.  The point being, the script and characterization are just as hackneyed as any DeMille movie.  (Or any movie from the 1930's starring Errol Flynn.)  There's a Milady in the form of a French Princess of Wales.  There's a wicked King.  The characters are either all Bad or all Good, and never mind the attempt at ambiguousness e.g. Robert the Bruce.  (He's all Good.)  There's the time-honored tradition, old as Seneca, of our hero's blending of personal revenge and patriotism as motivation to fight the injustices of the wicked King.  And there's Wallace himself, who seems to be a conflation of several cliched types  (Robin Hood, The Man With No Name, Charles Bronson in those  *Death Wish*  movies, etc. etc.).  Your toleration of this movie will depend on how willing you are to tread very, very familiar paths.As for Mr. Gibson's direction, it's no big deal.  Static compositions; close-ups intended to convey Meaning  (my favorite was the one where he's atop some mountain, the aerial camera delicately swooping around his tragic face); wistful scenery shots; and an excessive use of slow-motion.  In his defense, it must be stated that his battle scenes are really rather well done, inviting unsuccessful imitation  (think  *Gladiator* -- pee-yew!).  Mr. Gibson provides us three hours of all this -- his sophomoric direction, as well as his apparently sado-masochistic tendencies  (Wallace is constantly beat up throughout).

125923,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,0792139771,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 3]","Hopefully, the furor over THE PASSION will not obscure this, Gibson's masterful account of the life and death of Scottish patriot William Wallace. Short on facts but long on legend, BRAVEHEART is an epic in the grand style of David Lean, possibly the best character biodrama since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.This Academy-Award winning film, Gibson's directorial debut, is lavish, colorful, and long. Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is mythic, but threaded with a fine appreciation of the human frailties of Wallace, who led his countrymen in a protracted War of Independence against English rule in the early 1300s.Gibson's Wallace is balanced, a leader amongst men who accepts his role and the attendant lionizing that accompanies it, with bemusement and wit. The character of Wallace is nearly the perfect man, being forceful, ruthless, civilized, passionate, crafty, educated, and sensitive as the occasion demands. His slow downfall in the second half of the film (and his horrible death) are envisioned not as failures in the man but as born of a need to believe, even in the face of the treachery and self-interest of others.The Scottish nobles are drawn as amoral and torn between alliance with England and a fractious independence (as they historically were). Although they fail Wallace miserably, he is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he returns time and again to them to bolster his military and political clout. The vicious betrayal of Robert The Bruce (and his ultimate redemption) is a plot within a plot, and is played beautifully by Angus McFadyen.Gibson's vision of the battle scenes, drawn as they are with hundreds of extras, screaming horses, and gore enough for a teenage ""slaughter"" movie, are singularly exciting and propel the film forward at a literal gallop. The bloody-handed Wallace is a vision in violence and determination, and ultimate passion.Fine performances are supplied by Patrick MacGoohan as King Edward ""Longshanks"" Plantagenet, Sophie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.BRAVEHEART is creatively fictionalized history and fine inspiration. It is a story in which, as Wallace says: ""Every man dies...not every man really lives.""",5,"""Let Me Tell You of William Wallace...""",1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,2437,"['Hopefully', 'furor', 'PASSION', 'will', 'not', 'obscure', 'Gibson', 'masterful', 'account', 'life', 'death', 'Scottish', 'patriot', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Short', 'facts', 'long', 'legend', 'BRAVEHEART', 'epic', 'grand', 'style', 'David', 'Lean', 'possibly', 'best', 'character', 'biodrama', 'LAWRENCE', 'OF', 'ARABIA.This', 'Academy-Award', 'winning', 'film', 'Gibson', 'directorial', 'debut', 'lavish', 'colorful', 'long', 'Gibson', 'portrayal', 'Wallace', 'mythic', 'threaded', 'fine', 'appreciation', 'human', 'frailties', 'Wallace', 'who', 'led', 'countrymen', 'protracted', 'War', 'Independence', 'English', 'rule', 'early', '1300s.Gibson', 'Wallace', 'balanced', 'leader', 'amongst', 'men', 'who', 'role', 'attendant', 'lionizing', 'bemusement', 'wit', 'character', 'Wallace', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'man', 'being', 'forceful', 'ruthless', 'civilized', 'passionate', 'crafty', 'educated', 'sensitive', 'occasion', 'slow', 'downfall', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'horrible', 'death', 'are', 'envisioned', 'not', 'failures', 'man', 'born', 'need', 'believe', 'even', 'face', 'treachery', 'self-interest', 'others.The', 'Scottish', 'nobles', 'are', 'drawn', 'amoral', 'torn', 'alliance', 'England', 'fractious', 'independence', 'historically', 'were', 'fail', 'Wallace', 'miserably', 'so', 'convinced', 'rightness', 'cause', 'time', 'again', 'bolster', 'military', 'political', 'clout', 'vicious', 'betrayal', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'ultimate', 'redemption', 'plot', 'plot', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Angus', 'McFadyen.Gibson', 'vision', 'battle', 'scenes', 'drawn', 'are', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'screaming', 'horses', 'gore', 'enough', 'teenage', 'slaughter', 'movie', 'are', 'singularly', 'exciting', 'propel', 'film', 'forward', 'literal', 'gallop', 'bloody-handed', 'Wallace', 'vision', 'violence', 'determination', 'ultimate', 'passion.Fine', 'performances', 'are', 'supplied', 'Patrick', 'MacGoohan', 'King', 'Edward', 'Longshanks', 'Plantagenet', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Princess', 'Wales/French', 'King', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'who', 'Wallace', 'wife', 'Murron', 'Murron', 'memory', 'animate', 'Wallace', 'therefore', 'animate', 'film', 'McCormack', 'angelic', 'sensual', 'turns', 'need', 'demands', 'brief', 'crucial', 'role', 'grace.BRAVEHEART', 'creatively', 'fictionalized', 'history', 'fine', 'inspiration', 'story', 'Wallace', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'really']",N/A

So Gibson, never one to shy away from putting his money where his mouth is, makes the story of William Wallace who led the Scots in a fight for independence in the 13th century. Borrowing not just a little from Shakespeare's St. Crispin Day speech, Gibson speaks in a loud booming voice to the troops at Stirling, asking them to consider the Shakesperean choice, 'lying on their death beds 60 years from now, would you not exchange all those days for the one chance to say 'you may take our lives but you'll never take our freedom!'Historically accurate?

Technically, it works well, especially the battle scenes which are frequent, bloody and violent.  They also are not confusing.  The audience always knows who the bad guy is, and what the battle strategy is. However, even though I knew this was a myth, and not based on historical fact, I found the story hard to believe.  Would an English Princess really travel to the battlefield to make love to the King's enemy?Mel Gibson is a good actor, but he seemed too old for the part, especially when he weds his childhood sweetheart in the early part of the film.  The casting for the supporting roles was better:  Patrick McGoohan as the wicked king of England, Brendan Gleason as Mel Gibson's best friend, Catherine McCormack as his first love, Sophie Marceu as the princess.No matter how sad the story or gruesome the violence, I didn't feel any emotional pull.

125933,ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,0792139771,Lord Chimp,"[9, 14]","As I write this, Gladiator is still enjoying its shower of praise. I recall with notable fondness a similar film to snag the Oscar for Best Picture, Braveheart. This is the true masterpiece of the genre (which might be medieval action/adventure or something). What makes Braveheart special? In many movies like this (for instance, Gladiator), the protagonist is only a hero because he suffers. In Braveheart, William Wallace is a hero because he fights against suffering. It is that simple fundament that sets Braveheart up to be a great film.Of course, there is more that makes Braveheart great. Mel Gibson's performance as Wallace is riveting, emotionally charged, and...real. He portrays his character with incredible conviction that makes the movie so much more powerful. His requisite hero speeches are inspiring yet plausible, and positively electric with passion. Sorry, Russell Crowe, but Gibson is the true medieval hero of contemporary cinema. Gibson also proves to be a fine director, with a keen eye for detail and a shrewd understanding of the emotional element of the story.The battle scenes are fittingly gory, and do an excellent job portraying the chaos and brutality of the epoch's battlefield. But the emphasis here is not on the battles between the Scots and the English; this is an enduring story of love, ideals, and heroism. I've never cried watching a movie, but the heart-wrenching (and concurrently uplifting) finale brought me very close. Indeed, this movie sweeps you along for its epic story, and practically makes you another Scottish warrior. Along with the actors, you feel the soaring elation of victory and the profound anguish of defeat. Amazing.One of my favorite movies of all time.

125939,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,0792139771,Mark,"[3, 5]","The preface of this review is mainly a response to those who claim that the movie is pretty much fabricated and not based on that many actual events.  I agree.  But so what?  It still doesn't take away from the point that this is a wonderfully done epic in the tradition of films like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia.  The fact is, most movies made today are based on more fabrications than fact (the celebrated Remember the Titans comes to mind).  It still doesn't take away from the fact that they are decent films.  The point is, history is not really all that interesting to put it into a film, especially an epic of three hours or more like this.  Screenwriters have to fabricate some things, or no one would go see their movies.  If people were more interested in history, screenwriters would not have to make things up to better entertain people.  Therefore, the fault lies not with the filmmakers, but with the viewers.That being said, what Gibson has created is nothing short of a great, (fabricated) historical epic; one that is destined to become a classic.  The film did have stiff competition in 1995 at the Academy's (especially Apollo 13 and Leaving Las Vegas), but I think the Academy made a good choice.  Any one of the films up that year were all good choices for the award (yes, even Babe).  The film follows (the fabricated) William Wallace (Gibson) as he goes from peaceful farmer (for about a week) to fierce warrior able to raise almost invincible armies to defeat the English in the fourteenth century.  Registering at just under three hours (by about three minutes), Braveheart is one of the quickest moving three-hour films I have ever seen, and there aren't very many quiet scenes in between the action.Look, if you want a historically acurate film, go rent a History channel documentary on Wallace.

While many people argue about how inaccurate this film is, they do not realize that it is the spirit of the past that created the events, not the events which created the spirit.  For this reason, Braveheart shines most brightly.  The writers have created a story which portrays not only the complete love for Scotland by the peasantry; it also portrays the complacency and self-serving will of the nobility of Scotland.  This movie, while not being completely accurate, appeals to emotion over the logic of historical facts.  This makes it most fulfilling.Indeed, Braveheart is an excellent movie for anyone.

My strongest objection is that for a poor Scot, who lives in a hut, go to Rome, and speak fluently three languages is too much.William Wallace was not a poor peasant as depicted in the film. No peasant in the XIIth century could afford that culture.

I tend to agree, although I do not dismiss the fact that Mel Gibson has mounted a sumptuous, rousing, extremely visceral adventure about a man and his quest for freedom.  The battle scenes are some of the best of this nature ever put on film.  Gibson does overuse slomo; he does paint William Wallace as a Christ-like martyr, and as he would do years later in his controversial ""Passion,"" Gibson subjects his hero to an extended torture scene, with his fellow soldiers hiding out ala the apostles while Wallace is tortured.  Accused of making Passion his ego piece, I would venture to say that BRAVEHEART is a far bigger ego trip than Passion.  Gibson stars, directs and commandeers the movie in his image and likeness.  Mel is a smart and shrewed showman; his performance is average.  Some of the supporting actors are outstanding:  Angus McFadyen as the self-centered, self-tortured Robert of Bruce, who both befriends and betrays Wallace; Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward deLongshanks, a man whose own cruelty is matched by his lack of mercy and compassion; Catherine McCormack as Mel's doomed wife, whose quiet peasant beauty belies an earthly intelligence; Sophie Marceau as Prince Edward's wife, whose longing for love is captured in the glance of her gorgeous eyes; Brendan Gleeson, always dependable, this time as Gibson's big, boisterous sidekick, and Ian Bannen as the leprosy-ridden father of Robert, whose display of unimpassioned coldness both alienates and commands his son.Yes, an eclair; maybe shouldn't be a Best Picture Oscar winner, but one can't deny Gibson has mounted a rousing, if vacuous, entertainment.",5,MEL'S ECLAIR,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,1959,"['BRAVEHEART', 'gigantic', 'beautifully', 'ornamented', 'chocolate', 'eclair', 'beautiful', 'delicious', 'looking', 'once', 'bite', 'realize', 'how', 'little', 'really', 'inside.In', 'recent', 'poll', 'critics', 'BRAVEHEART', 'was', 'listed', 'one', 'Oscar', 'embarrassments', '-a', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'tend', 'agree', 'do', 'not', 'dismiss', 'fact', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'mounted', 'sumptuous', 'rousing', 'extremely', 'visceral', 'adventure', 'man', 'quest', 'freedom', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'nature', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Gibson', 'overuse', 'slomo', 'paint', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Christ-like', 'martyr', 'would', 'do', 'years', 'later', 'controversial', 'Passion', 'Gibson', 'hero', 'extended', 'torture', 'scene', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'hiding', 'out', 'apostles', 'Wallace', 'tortured', 'Accused', 'making', 'Passion', 'ego', 'piece', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'BRAVEHEART', 'far', 'bigger', 'ego', 'trip', 'Passion', 'Gibson', 'stars', 'directs', 'commandeers', 'movie', 'image', 'likeness', 'Mel', 'smart', 'shrewed', 'showman', 'performance', 'average', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Angus', 'McFadyen', 'self-centered', 'self-tortured', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'who', 'befriends', 'betrays', 'Wallace', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'evil', 'King', 'Edward', 'man', 'own', 'cruelty', 'matched', 'lack', 'mercy', 'compassion', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'Mel', 'doomed', 'wife', 'quiet', 'peasant', 'beauty', 'belies', 'earthly', 'intelligence', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'wife', 'longing', 'love', 'captured', 'glance', 'gorgeous', 'eyes', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'always', 'dependable', 'time', 'Gibson', 'big', 'boisterous', 'sidekick', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'leprosy-ridden', 'father', 'Robert', 'display', 'unimpassioned', 'coldness', 'alienates', 'son.Yes', 'eclair', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Gibson', 'mounted', 'rousing', 'vacuous', 'entertainment']",N/A

Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is so modest, in fact, that he allows his character to be not only the greatest warrior ever seen (able to ride his *horse* into a building, kill a man, and still get out alive despite the presence of a phalanx of armed guards), but so charismatic that the daughter of the enemy king falls in love with him after only one meeting.  He not only fights and romances, he also speaks several languages, and can dazzle lords and commoners alike with his intelligence. (&quot;En francais, s'il vou plait!&quot;) With a stirring speech sounding suspiciously like Kenneth Branagh in HENRY V, Wallace inspires his men to feats of derring-do, invents battle strategies never even conceived during that day and age (because they were tactically impossible, such as letting the enemy run right into a wall of spears), and leads his army into head-on crashes against the foe that bear more than a passing resemblance to the battle scene from Eisenstein's ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  And when Wallace finally meets his end, it's not enough to merely die a defiant, heroic death...instead, he becomes a Christ figure and has a full-blown crucifixion.  (The portrayal of the king's son as a flaming drag queen brought howls of protest from gay-rights groups, as homophobia is a running theme in a number of Gibson's movies.)The movie is certainly not boring, and the battle scenes are good (if bloody); but it's merely an attempt to combine Errol Flynn's ROBIN HOOD with the typical Mel Gibson character, such as we see in MAD MAX or LETHAL WEAPON.

It is based on the story of William Wallace, a 13th century Scotsman who sought revenge for the death of his father, brother and their tiny little town. Mel Gibson's directorial debut could not have done better. The audiences thought it was amazing , the Oscars thought enough of it to name it best picture. William Wallace is an inspiration to all who have been oppressed under the tyranny of evil. He lives with his uncle until he is in his twenties and goes back to his village which is now under the rule of Edward the Longshanks. He wants to marry the women he loves. After she is taken from him, he sets out to free Scotland from oppression.The sheer magnitude of this production has never been seen before. The battle scenes are filmed at great angles. The cinematography is out of this world. This movie basically has something for everyone. It has Romance, Conflict, and it definitelyhas enough action to satisfy anybody. This movie is one of the greatest epics of our time. It is definitely a movie to buy and view over and over again.William Wallace will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and to avenge his beloved. Legend has it that when William Wallace was tortured and killed he was asked if he had any last words and he yelled out ""Freedom""!!!!. His arms and legs were sent to the four corners of Britain as a sign of what would happen to those who opposed the King.""They may take our lives, but they will never take our freedom""",5,A DVD for the Man's Man,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,1651,"['MAN', 'DIES', 'BUT', 'NOT', 'EVERY', 'MAN', 'REALLY', 'LIVES', 'central', 'theme', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Braveheart', 'Braveheart', 'epic', 'story', 'greed', 'revenge', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'greatest', 'Love', 'based', 'story', 'William', 'Wallace', '13th', 'century', 'Scotsman', 'who', 'sought', 'revenge', 'death', 'father', 'brother', 'tiny', 'little', 'town', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'directorial', 'debut', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'audiences', 'thought', 'was', 'amazing', 'Oscars', 'thought', 'enough', 'name', 'best', 'picture', 'William', 'Wallace', 'inspiration', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'oppressed', 'tyranny', 'evil', 'uncle', 'twenties', 'back', 'village', 'now', 'rule', 'Edward', 'Longshanks', 'marry', 'women', 'taken', 'out', 'free', 'Scotland', 'oppression.The', 'sheer', 'magnitude', 'production', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'great', 'angles', 'cinematography', 'world', 'movie', 'basically', 'something', 'everyone', 'Romance', 'Conflict', 'enough', 'action', 'satisfy', 'anybody', 'movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'epics', 'time', 'definitely', 'movie', 'buy', 'view', 'again.William', 'Wallace', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'goal', 'avenge', 'beloved', 'Legend', 'when', 'William', 'Wallace', 'was', 'tortured', 'killed', 'was', 'asked', 'had', 'last', 'words', 'yelled', 'out', 'Freedom', 'arms', 'legs', 'were', 'sent', 'four', 'corners', 'Britain', 'sign', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'who', 'opposed', 'King', 'may', 'take', 'lives', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'freedom']",N/A

So when this movie came out, imagine the excitement we felt.  And with good reason.  It is a really cool movie.  The story is great, the characters are interesting and indepth, and there is great scenery and the battle scenes are amazing.The problem enters only when I researched the period and began to find the movie really had very little to do with real life.  I know it's just a movie, but I am something of a purist, and after all, it does sort of claim to be factual.  The first clue should be the initial narration by Bruce when he claims history is written by men who have hanged heroes, implying the real story was suppressed by the victorious English when it is the Scottish who won the war!  I also felt that it unfairly portrays the English as beastly heathens when the fact is, well, weren't all Europeans of that time pretty vile and cruel?  The Scottish are far from a peaceful, freedom loving people, after all.I am not going to pore over all the things the movie gets wrong, I'm just going to say it's incredibly bad history.

Braveheart is the romanticized story of a historic Scottish freedom fighter, the legendary William Wallace, and his quest for the independence of Scotland. A truly fantastic story even without the Hollywood glorifications, this movie brings to life the story of a man who gave his life for the freedom of his countrymen. This is the movie that forever made me wish I was Scottish.Early on in the story, we learn of Scotland's struggle against the will of English kings, who've ruthlessly dominated Scotland for ages. A proud people, Scots have long fought and died in the name of Scotland in order to preserve her independence and sovereignty. As such, it is fitting that we soon learn of the demise of William's father at the hands of the English. Struck with grief and in shock, William attends his father's funeral, only to briefly meet a young girl who has noticed him and expresses her empathy for him with a sweet and kindhearted gesture. Without knowing it, his destiny in life and love has begun. Immediately thereafter, William is sent to live with his uncle, Argyle, who teaches the young lad to be a man; a good and brave man of honor. Argyle wisely makes a point to teach William to master his intellect before learning to master the sword. This is the portion of the story that lays the foundation of what's to come; which is Wallace's return to the land of his forefathers and clan.There is much to tell about this story, but I will save the best for you to discover for yourself. However, everyone considering this movie should know this: being a person who values freedom and admires the bravery displayed by those who have fought and died for it, this movie is second to none. The setting, the characters, the battle scenes, the dialog, the passionate love he displays for his life-long soul-mate are just a few things that make this movie great. I love William Wallace's character for his indomitable spirit and remarkable, unyielding quest for justice and freedom. Until is last breath, Wallace remains steadfast in his quest for the freedom of his countrymen; and it is a bittersweet, heart wrenching but satisfying end at that.Other reviewers have complained of historical inaccuracies, but I feel that they're missing the point. History is not to be learned from Hollywood depictions. Every discerning person should know that by now, and as such, should expect Hollywood to distort truths for a more entertaining story. Thus, that is the point; it's a story with an excellent message. It's a remarkable, memorable, commendable and very moving story that you will not forget. This is a movie that both men and women will enjoy. It will move you in a way that few movies can.

The English come along and kill her, and Wallace exacts his revenge, resulting in a Scottish rebellion against oppressive English rule.Wallace, played impeccably by Mel Gibson, leads the rebellion, inspiring the Scottish peasants that make up the ranks of his army with the promise of freedom. In a particularly wonderful speech that is classic among Braveheart fans, Gibson extolls the virtue of freedom and rouses his army to fight a much larger English army.There are three things that make this movie so good. First, the characters are convincing and well played (Patrick McGoohan plays the conniving King Edward so well you can't imagine him as anyone else), and you grow to like them. Second, the romantic subplots are a vital and seamless part of the plot, and are never cheesy or unbelievable. Thirdly, the message of the film is one for the ages. Freedom from oppression is something everyone can identify with, and it provides for a very emotional ending and pulls you into the movie.Though the film does an immeasurably good job of bringing you into the past with its sweeping cinematography and its epic plot, some of the battle scenes might be too much for some people to take, particularly younger audiences.

125974,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792139771,Reviewer,"[2, 4]","Throughout the ages, oppression has taken many forms, rearing it's ugly head to deny the liberty and the rights of people everywhere, and the cry of ""Freedom"" and the inherent longing to be free of tyranny in any of it's many incarnations is universal and older than recorded history.  Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  ""Braveheart,"" directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland.  Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling.  Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, ""We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!""  To which Wallace replies, ""I AM William Wallace!""  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's ""Henry V""), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits of this endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, ""Braveheart"" is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.

125982,A2E1QZ5YSHVQXL,0792139771,Rocky,"[2, 6]","I just watched Braveheart a little while ago and at the beginning of the movie I thought it was absolutely sweet when the future wife of William gave him a flower at his father's funeral. But then the movie grew very warrior- like when the movie quickly cut to the boy turning into a man and the English kills his wife and Wallace sets out for revenge. A series of action scenes result and Wallace pretty much just fights and fights. It's easy to tell that this is a story of the centuries long battle of the Scottish and the British, and Mel Gibson picked this one man out of many Scottish leaders to shine a light on. Many of the battle scenes are quite wonderful, and a laugh is thrown in at times. The soul- mate love thing at the beginning with William and his wife who is played by the tender- hearted Catherine McCormack(that Mel admits he had fallen in love a bit with while acting with her) was not at all mushy and throughout the entire film it is shown that his wife is always in the center of his heart, especially at the end when she comes to him, reuniting them at last.But the problem with this film I didn't realize until a few days after was that this movie was stamped all over the place with artistic license. The truth was the real Wallace didn't marry no girl from his village, and that certainly wasn't the reason he went into war. (...) . The prince was only a child back when William was in this battle and so was the princess he married. These two married years after William's death, so there's no way also that the princess could have had in any way contact with William, nor any lusty scenes with him. Honestly this crush this princess had on him and then this one night stand of lust was ridiculous in the film, because in the 1200s this would never have happened. The princess would never even be sent off to talk matters of business because kings confined women only to the castle back in those times and nowhere else. So although it was nice the princess finally got a real man in her bedroom for a night, it is unbelievable for those times and just boring. And also there were a few other spots where it would have been nice for Mel to try to slim down into the actual real history.But otherwise the movie was nice. Especially in the end, when he shouts freedom, although he knows death is the only option if he said this. But this was for inspiration that fueled the remaining of his army to ensure a quick victory at the very last few minutes of the film.This movie I would have appreciated more though if Mel hadn't used so much artistic license and used more actual history. But I applaud Mel for his effort.

Mel Gibson's epic tale of Scottish Patriot William Wallace certainly qualifies as one of the top 5 movies of the 90's, and one of the greatest movies ever made.I can't say enough about the battle scenes, which certainly set the standard for movies to come.  Films such as Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor and others owe a debt of gratitude to Braveheart for setting the standard in terms of realism and accuracy.  Gibson did an amazing job depicting the brutality and violence of medieval war-making.  Those were the days when surgical strikes and friendly fire were not a part of the vocabulary.As for acting, well, you can't get much better than Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau and Patrick Mcgoohan (just to name a few).  Patrick was robbed by the Academy when they failed to nominate him for an Oscar in his portrayal of King Edward I.  I have to say that Mel has an incredible talent for film making and casting is no exception.  Every actor played their part to perfection.The cinematography was impeccable.  This movie was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  The DVD contains a &quot;making of&quot; in which we learn that it rained most of the time and Gibson decided to use that to his advantage rather than work around it.  I have to comend him for this, as it added character to the film and only made the cinematography look that much better.Finally the music was fabulous.  Horner did a wonderful job painting emotion with a soundtrack second to none.  It's no wonder he was chosen to create the soundtrack for another Oscar winning movie called Titanic.If you are a DVD collector, you must have this movie.

The acting was superb, the battle scenes were graphic without being overly grotesque, and the story itself was compelling.But it would have been more compelling if it were based more closely on the true William Wallace's struggle for Scottish independence and the events surrounding him in his time and place. After all, the true historical events are like a movie in themselves.Inaccuracy can be forgiven in cinema on certain levels. This is a long movie that has a lot to relate to the viewer about the people that were there to play out this drama centuries ago. There is a lot of build up, from the death of Wallace's wife at the hands of the British, to the wiping out of his village, and the abuses that the Scots were suffering from their neighbors to the south. There is also a lot of political intrigue, and it is difficult to put that on the screen because political intrigue, especially in medieval Europe, was a complicated business. So in this, inaccuracies that spell out the plight of the Scots and build up to the actual events and battles would be forgivable, and they are.However, one glaring and unecessary inaccuracy dropped this movie down to the 3 star rating all on its own.  William Wallace never - I repeat, NEVER, slept with Queen Isabela. He probably never actually even stood in the same room with her. Yes, she had lovers, and one in particular actually later helped her murder her gay husband in grisly fashion with a red hot poker in a certain orifice. But she never even knew Wallace, and chances are that if she had, she would never give it up to an unwashed Scot.It was totally needless and it did nothing for the plot.

He was actually a conglomeration of heroes from lore. And being such, he never really boinked the princess from England. Who the hell cares. Like Rob Roy (see the Liam Neeson movie of the same name. You'll love it) it's the MOVIE that counts. THAT's what I'm reviewing. You want true to life battle scenes. You got `em. The best you'll ever see. Not for the faint of heart. There is so much truth in the struggle of Scotland vs England. If you have ever traced your family tree back to the English Isles, you will feel the indignity forced upon Mel Gibson's Scots. If any of you have read my reviews you know I am big on cinematography and soundtrack making a movie. It does that and more. The color (everything is GREEN) is so dramatic. The backround music haunts you. The battle close-ups put you in the middle of the horribly real bloodshed. The score leads you emotionally. But the champion of all this is Mel Gibson's performance. If I didn't know he was Mad Max, I'd swear he was William Wallace incarnate. The plot takes you seemlessly from Mel as a small child whose father is killed in revolt against his land bairn, to a mature adult infuriated with the injustice of regal land owners. Tops on my list is the realistic portrayal of medieval power plays, and the way William Wallace is so naively trapped within. This is not just a Hollywood hack and slash. This is an emotional film, encompassing politics and violence in search of  freedom. Anyone who cannot feel the pain of William Wallace in this film, is emotionally dead. This movie is about impact. This is not just a guy flick. Girls watching this movie with you, will end up crying on your shoulder.

The only historical details about William Wallace are those of a bard's poems. So, Mel Gibson rewrites history. The movie is full of gory violence, romance, patriotism (if you can call it that), battle, adultery and passion. While the scenery and music is good, most of the movie is all passion and no brains. I saw some of the reviews of the movie and realize how this movie would appeal to the simple minded - one reviewer writing, ""If you do not like this movie, you are a moron"". Most people from Scotland found this movie silly.The positives, it has a story of passion, with great score and some of the actors like Patrick McGoohan and Sophie Marceau did a good job. The movie starts well but progressively gets worse.The negatives, it shows that the Wallace is starting the whole thing based on revenge and not on ideals, his wife gets killed. So, he starts his rebellion. No Scot would like such a portrayal. He commits adultery with the Princess of Wales, so he is no different from the English, the very people he wishes to vanquish. The English are slandered in a way that is not documented such as ""Prima Noctes"", no Englishman would like that. Though it is a movie, I do not think that Mel Gibson would like it if some one makes a movie of him and slanders him similarly. It shows the Scots wearing kilts all the time, they never wore them until the 18th century. The battle scenes are extremely violent and parts such as Irish changing sides in the beginning of the battle is ridiculous. The part where he cries ""Freedom"" before he is beheaded is the silliest. The story of Robert the Bruce is also not real. Basically, it appears to be a hastily put together script without checking any veracity (or giving a damn about it). It is difficult to believe that they gave the best director oscar to this movie. I guess this was a weak year.For people who say that this is the best movie that they have ever seen, I would recommend that they see movies such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Those movies have passion, better acting and much more realism. They were made over a longer period with a lot of trouble over the literature to reduce errors and the ridiculous nature of the movies such as this one. There will always be die-hards who will swear by this movie, but quality is measured by whether the movie can stand the passage of time.

He is Scotlands National Hero,there is even a statue in his honor at the field of Stirling Bridge.This was one of the two most major engagemnts fought against the english in which William Wallace was commander of the forces of Scotlands army.The other major fight was at Falkirk which was a disservice to honor and glory and in truth was to allow for the subsequent martydom of William Wallace.In the film Braveheart,liberties are taken with history so that what we are asked to consider is in fact a motion picture and not an attempt to tell history with a historical purpose.I would recommend to anyone wishing to know better,to go to Scotlands national web site and there you will find a good deal of factual information about the life and history of both William Wallace and the nation of Scotland.It is of worth noting that the archives could not verify the claims made in this picture which sought to take the very heart out of the  marraige vow,with an edict that allowed for the compelling motivation of war.In a manner of speaking this is very nearly baseless showboating and what makes this so very difficult to get out of the way of is that this is a very violent film with so much political rhetoric that the emotion just sort of grabs you,to me this is unfortunate.The film though is correct about a few things and that Wallace was betrayed at Falkirk by the underclass which ruled from behind closed doors.This underclass,if you will, is referred to, as the nobility.There ties where to there lands and titles which had been given to them by the Crown of England.They sought to protect there interests by betraying this very brave man in William Wallace.Though these are but a thousand words William Wallace deserves better and you will find honest information elsewhere.It may not be a popular opinion but to me Braveheart is a dishonest film and it does have the distinction of wining a best picture Oscar.However it will keep your attention and perhaps like it did to me,provide the reader with motivation to know who this William Wallace really is,and better yet you might be able to get out from under the problems mentioned and learn something about the politics of the silver screen.There are so many items that were this to be possible, you would find a different result if in fact the truth as to history and the truth as to Braveheart were written that what is perceived at present would differ considerably with what would be the truth.",1,Do We Know Better?,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2485,"['Who', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Scotlands', 'National', 'Hero', 'even', 'statue', 'honor', 'field', 'Stirling', 'Bridge.This', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'most', 'major', 'engagemnts', 'fought', 'english', 'William', 'Wallace', 'was', 'commander', 'forces', 'Scotlands', 'other', 'major', 'fight', 'was', 'Falkirk', 'was', 'disservice', 'honor', 'glory', 'truth', 'was', 'allow', 'subsequent', 'martydom', 'William', 'Wallace.In', 'film', 'Braveheart', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'history', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'asked', 'consider', 'fact', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'attempt', 'tell', 'history', 'historical', 'purpose.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'know', 'better', 'go', 'Scotlands', 'national', 'web', 'site', 'will', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'factual', 'information', 'life', 'history', 'William', 'Wallace', 'nation', 'Scotland.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'archives', 'could', 'not', 'verify', 'claims', 'made', 'picture', 'sought', 'take', 'very', 'heart', 'marraige', 'vow', 'edict', 'allowed', 'compelling', 'motivation', 'war.In', 'manner', 'speaking', 'very', 'nearly', 'baseless', 'showboating', 'what', 'so', 'very', 'difficult', 'get', 'way', 'very', 'violent', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'emotion', 'just', 'sort', 'grabs', 'unfortunate.The', 'film', 'correct', 'few', 'things', 'Wallace', 'was', 'betrayed', 'Falkirk', 'underclass', 'ruled', 'closed', 'doors.This', 'underclass', 'will', 'referred', 'nobility.There', 'ties', 'where', 'there', 'lands', 'titles', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'Crown', 'England.They', 'sought', 'protect', 'interests', 'betraying', 'very', 'brave', 'man', 'William', 'Wallace.Though', 'are', 'thousand', 'words', 'William', 'Wallace', 'better', 'will', 'find', 'honest', 'information', 'elsewhere.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'opinion', 'Braveheart', 'dishonest', 'film', 'have', 'distinction', 'wining', 'best', 'picture', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'perhaps', 'did', 'provide', 'reader', 'motivation', 'know', 'who', 'William', 'Wallace', 'really', 'better', 'yet', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'out', 'problems', 'mentioned', 'learn', 'something', 'politics', 'silver', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'items', 'were', 'be', 'possible', 'would', 'find', 'different', 'result', 'fact', 'truth', 'history', 'truth', 'Braveheart', 'were', 'written', 'what', 'perceived', 'present', 'would', 'differ', 'considerably', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'truth']",N/A

In the time period of this movie, the Scottish are fighting against the cruel and repressive English lead by King Edward Longshanks.  Edward is a very cruel and bitter man, further enraged by his son's disinterest in the affairs of state.  William Wallace was intent on living  a life of peace and farming, but a personal tragedy drives him to become the great general of the Scottish armies.I was really moved by this movie.  It reall brings out the tears in even the toughest of people.  It successfully combines the romance and war movie genres.  Usually movies which try to combine these genres do a bad job on one or both elements.  Because this successfully combines both genres, I think both men and women can enjoy it equally.Another point--the battle scenes are very realistic.  If you are sensitive, you may not enjoy these scenes, but I believe they are necessary in this case.  They are needed to show how terrible war is.  Of course there are things worth fighting for--protection of our families and our freedoms, but it is a crime to make war for pride or for profit.

So choose your word and get your review.If you like history, you're going to have problems with this movie.  To be sure, pains were taken to evoke an accurate ""feel"" of the times.  The way in which battles happened is generally more accurate and horrific than has been depicted in movies previously.  But on occasion, license is taken with the strategy and conduct of particular historical battles.  Indeed at times it's tempting to say this film was merely based on some rumors heard about William Wallace.  Certainly, the most egregious sin is how Robert the Bruce is treated.  Far from being accurately portrayed as the true savior of modern Scotland--and indeed the one individual most responsible for Scotland having never been conquered--he's seen as treacherous.  It fails to account how Robert the Bruce eventually triumphed over William Wallace's chief rival: Edward Longshanks, and indeed his successor.  Sadly, the movie never takes the time to explain William and Robert's twin importance; it just leaves us with the martyr and the snake.  And it's not like Gibson didn't have time in the film to give more attention to the Bruce/Wallace relationship.  This is a long film.  No, he actively chose to make a movie which was so centered on Wallace that it went over the line of truth.If, however, you're focusing more on the word ""drama"" than ""historical"", you'll have little to take exception to, here.  It's a great bit of filmmaking on that score, fully deserving of its many accolades.  Battle scenes have rarely been directed on Gibson's par, and the acting is consistently competent throughout.  However this film might warp your history, it's a deftly powerful work that will stay in your mind long after you watch it.[DVD NOTES: A fine director's commentary and making-of featurette bring this puppy up a star, for me.

Nothing but pure impotent rage with him after he cut the mullet and went short.But back to the movie.  Yeah, it holds up for the most part.  Wasn't like it was by any means the best movie of 1995.  For that I had it down to Apollo 13, Twelve Monkeys, Nixon, Toy Story, Seven, Crimson Tide and Babe.  But it's not like any of the best Oscar movies are the best middle brow flicks Hollywood and England kick out most years.  Braveheart belongs right in the middle of the pack.  But again, does Get Shorty, Leaving Las Vegas, or Usual Suspects hold up either.  Of course everybody was figuring Casino was the best movie until it was released.  Then the whole country took a  on it.  And that movie really held up.  Man, it's on a premium channel on the telly and I always stop to watch at least 20-40 minutes minimum.But not so much Braveheart.  Mel has way too much revenge in his heart in all his movies.  Who really tinkled in his cheerios?  Cause whoever it is seems to be doing it every day he's on a movie set cause he's always so vengeanceful.  Just once I'd like to see him doing something good just for the common man and not cause somebody got one over on him and killed his wife or dog or shot up his trailer.Still though I'd say this movie has a great cast.  Not top of the line for 95 like Heat, Richard III or the others I listed.  But plenty good.  Maybe I'm wrong.  It does have Brendon Gleeson and Brian Cox.  Those guys are awesome.  I love them.

Although not personally familiar with the history behind the man, I  understand that Mr. Gibson took liberties with facts, but it is commonly  understood that Hollywood will sacrifice accuracy for entertainment.The  plot is simple: Scotland is under the yoke of Britain and its evil ruler.  Wallace, brought brought up outside Scotland, returns upon reaching manhood  to his village and his people where he falls in love.  Although trying to  live in peace, the English oppression on his people prove to be too much,  and he takes up arms against the powerful enemy to the south.There are,  of course, the requesite battle scenes, despicable actions by the king to  show how truly evil he is, as well as the double-crossing and the romance.  However, the scope and scale of the movie is truly breath-taking.  The  battles are long, arduous affairs, with decapitations, mutilations and lots  of blood.  Think &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; meets people with really  big axes.  But the battles are not merely graphic; they are beautifully  choreographed, and extremely well shot.  The spectator can follow the  action and understand the tactics involved.Ms. Marceau brings fire and  strength to the role of the English King's daughter-in-law.  She is  introduced as a pawn of the King, but she reveals to much more than  that.My complaint of the movie is that the pacing is a bit off.  Three  quarters into the movie, it reaches a point where I thought the movie was  over.  All of a sudden, the plot resumes.  The ending is also a bit too  dramatic, but then again, we are dealing with larger-than-life  characters.Overall, this is a highly recommendable movie, and definitely  a must-see for all Mel Gibson fans.",4,"Excellent movie, even if it lacks historical accuracy.",966038400,"08 12, 2000",2000,1852,"['story', 'William', 'Wallace', 'struggle', 'free', 'Scotland', 'beautifully', 'brought', 'screen', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'excellent', 'cast', 'not', 'personally', 'familiar', 'history', 'man', 'understand', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'took', 'liberties', 'facts', 'commonly', 'understood', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'accuracy', 'entertainment.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Scotland', 'yoke', 'Britain', 'evil', 'ruler', 'Wallace', 'brought', 'brought', 'up', 'outside', 'Scotland', 'reaching', 'manhood', 'village', 'people', 'where', 'love', 'trying', 'live', 'peace', 'English', 'oppression', 'people', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'up', 'arms', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'south.There', 'are', 'course', 'requesite', 'battle', 'scenes', 'despicable', 'actions', 'king', 'show', 'how', 'truly', 'evil', 'as', 'well', 'double-crossing', 'romance', 'However', 'scope', 'scale', 'movie', 'truly', 'breath-taking', 'battles', 'are', 'long', 'arduous', 'affairs', 'decapitations', 'mutilations', 'lots', 'blood', 'Think', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'meets', 'people', 'really', 'big', 'axes', 'battles', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'graphic', 'are', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'extremely', 'well', 'shot', 'spectator', 'can', 'follow', 'action', 'understand', 'tactics', 'involved.Ms', 'Marceau', 'fire', 'strength', 'role', 'English', 'King', 'daughter-in-law', 'introduced', 'pawn', 'King', 'much', 'more', 'that.My', 'complaint', 'movie', 'pacing', 'bit', 'off', 'Three', 'quarters', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'sudden', 'plot', 'resumes', 'ending', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'dramatic', 'then', 'again', 'are', 'dealing', 'larger-than-life', 'characters.Overall', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'movie', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fans']",N/A
