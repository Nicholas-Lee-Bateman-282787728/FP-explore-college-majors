Jarod is such a wonderful character so child-like and yet a genius; but he is also human and caring.  Traits alot of people don't seem to have anymore, he genuingly wants to help people whoever they are.  The series hasn't been released on DVD in this country and I'm not sure when, or if, it ever will be.  I was delighted to see it on Amazon and immediately ordered it.  I have also ordered season 2 as well and am waiting for it to arrive.  The DVD itself has all of season 1 plus some extras of Michael T. Weiss, Jon Gries and the creators all talking about the series and Jarod.  It's good value for money from Amazon even for myself with the DVDs being posted overseas.  If you're a Pretender fan you have to get the DVDs.

874510,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B0006UEVTK,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[2, 2]","The Pretender is an action/drama/mystery series that had hints of Quantum Leap and the Fugitive thrown in the mix. Michael T. Weiss brings a unique blend of child-like innocence and yet a sexy handsome presence (for the ladies)to the character of the adult Jarod, from which the show starts. Jarod is a genius known as a ""Prentender"" Through flashbacks we learn that Jarod was abducted from his parents as a small child by a shadowy secret organization called the Centre and forced to play out ""simulations"" of given dangerous situations. By putting himself into the role of the pivotal charaacters, Jarod would reason out each simulation to a conclusion. Little did Jarod realize, these simulation results were sold by this evil organization to the highest bidder resulting in many deaths and horrifying conclusions. Finally, as an adult, Jarod escapes beginning a breathtaking series of close call captures but Jarod's brilliance outwits them at every turn. Each episode focuses on Jarod's own simulations in the lives of someone else, revolving around Jarod's trying to earn penanance for the Centre's evil by helping people in need. His Pretender skills come in handy as he poses as a doctor,pilot, attorney and many other occupations that will help others. Each time the Centre's crack team,the hard as nails and seemingly evil, Ms Parker (Andrea Parker), Sydney (Patrick Branchau)Jarod's mentor working for the Centre and the clutsey computer tech whiz, Broots (John Gries)alawys seem to stay one step behind. As the series unfolds more mysteries about the Centre start to unfold and each principal player on the Centre's team begins to have their own doubts about their loyalties and the underlying dangers that are in store for even them! There is so much underlying intrigue that cannot be given away. The show is brilliant and was a hidden NBC gem that had only a cult following. This was an outstanding piece of television history that will be a great addition to anyone's viewing library whether you saw this in its original timeslot on television or you are seeing it for the first time. Don't pass this up. It is a great show worthy of its cult status! And at these cheap prices! BUY THEM!! You won't be disappointed. Great acting, great fun, great suspense. The indepth portrayal of the multi-faceted characters is priceless. the only thing I did not like are the double sided discs but these play very well compared to some of the problems I have heard others have had in the past with this format!!Fans of the shows The Fugitive, Alias and Quantum Leap will be quick to notice and enjoy the simularities to this show. An innovative, groundbreaking piece of television history destined to be a cult classic.",5,"The Fugitive,Alias and Quantum Leap fans.....rejoice!",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2723,"['Pretender', 'action/drama/mystery', 'series', 'had', 'hints', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Fugitive', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'unique', 'blend', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'yet', 'sexy', 'handsome', 'presence', 'ladies', 'character', 'adult', 'Jarod', 'show', 'Jarod', 'genius', 'known', 'Prentender', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'Jarod', 'was', 'abducted', 'parents', 'small', 'child', 'shadowy', 'secret', 'organization', 'called', 'Centre', 'forced', 'play', 'out', 'simulations', 'given', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'putting', 'role', 'pivotal', 'charaacters', 'Jarod', 'would', 'reason', 'simulation', 'conclusion', 'Little', 'did', 'Jarod', 'realize', 'simulation', 'results', 'were', 'sold', 'evil', 'organization', 'highest', 'bidder', 'resulting', 'many', 'deaths', 'horrifying', 'conclusions', 'Finally', 'adult', 'Jarod', 'beginning', 'breathtaking', 'series', 'close', 'call', 'captures', 'Jarod', 'brilliance', 'turn', 'episode', 'Jarod', 'own', 'simulations', 'lives', 'someone', 'else', 'revolving', 'Jarod', 'trying', 'earn', 'penanance', 'Centre', 'evil', 'helping', 'people', 'need', 'Pretender', 'skills', 'come', 'handy', 'doctor', 'pilot', 'attorney', 'many', 'other', 'occupations', 'will', 'help', 'others', 'time', 'Centre', 'crack', 'team', 'hard', 'nails', 'seemingly', 'evil', 'Ms', 'Parker', 'Andrea', 'Parker', 'Sydney', 'Patrick', 'Branchau', 'Jarod', 'mentor', 'working', 'Centre', 'clutsey', 'computer', 'tech', 'whiz', 'Broots', 'John', 'Gries', 'alawys', 'seem', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'behind', 'series', 'more', 'mysteries', 'Centre', 'start', 'unfold', 'principal', 'player', 'Centre', 'team', 'have', 'own', 'doubts', 'loyalties', 'underlying', 'dangers', 'are', 'store', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'underlying', 'intrigue', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'away', 'show', 'brilliant', 'was', 'hidden', 'NBC', 'gem', 'had', 'only', 'cult', 'following', 'was', 'outstanding', 'piece', 'television', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'viewing', 'library', 'saw', 'original', 'timeslot', 'television', 'are', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'great', 'show', 'worthy', 'cult', 'status', 'cheap', 'prices', 'BUY', 'THEM', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'fun', 'great', 'suspense', 'indepth', 'portrayal', 'multi-faceted', 'characters', 'priceless', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'compared', 'problems', 'have', 'heard', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'past', 'format', 'Fans', 'shows', 'Fugitive', 'Alias', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'notice', 'enjoy', 'simularities', 'show', 'innovative', 'groundbreaking', 'piece', 'television', 'history', 'destined', 'be', 'cult', 'classic']",N/A

I'm a little bummed they really wrapped everything up with Jarod's past, but the show was canceled so what can I say.What I loved about watching this again after all theses years is it helped me understand character development from a different point of view. A bit hard to explain here in so few words, but as an author and writing coach, I encourage my students to watch a few shows just get a feel for seeing someone experiences things for the first time, which Jarod does in each show.If you're looking for a good show to just let your brain unwind, this is it.

874512,A47OISX4AV8I,B0006UEVTK,AngelosOne,"[7, 7]","Imagine my surprise when I saw that this excellent TV show was coming to DVD.  I was floored, and I immediately put it on my wishlist.  However, I just couldn't wait to own it, so I have pre-order it- at least now, I know it will come and I won't forget to order later on :)Anyway, I remember this show from a while back.  I'm not sure exactly when it first aired, but I do remember many of the episodes with vivid detail.  I must have been in high school when I first saw this show on NBC.It's the story of a ""child"" prodigy who is able to ""pretend"" so vividly how another person would act, that he is able to become that person.  Fast forward about 15 or so years, and we have a fully grown Jarod who has finally decided to escape from the institution which has been using him for the better part of his young life.  Not only that, but it seems that said Institution was responsible to his parents deaths.The show's charm is the main actor's ability to make his ""pretending"" to be different people believable.  He is the somewhat naive hero who still believes in the goodness of people.Another great memory of the show is his relationship with Miss Parker, an agent of the Institution(I forget if it had a name) chasing him.  It's a ""don't know if it will happen"" love story- much of their relationship is played out through flashbacks, since Miss Parker is also the daughter of the Institution's Director, and she met Jarod when she was a young girl.  Their present day interactions are limited, mostly because Jarod is so adept at evading her, but there are some very good episodes where they do get to interact a lot.It's sad that I lost track of this show after it got cancelled on NBC (or was it CBS?) but I've heard that it moved to the Turner Network?  I'm not sure how many seasons the show ended up having, but if they put all of them out on DVD, you can bet anything that I will be buying it.Now, what's this I hear about a TV movie of the Pretender?",5,I still have fond memories of this show....,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1962,"['Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'saw', 'excellent', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'coming', 'DVD', 'was', 'floored', 'immediately', 'put', 'wishlist', 'However', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'so', 'have', 'pre-order', 'it-', 'least', 'now', 'know', 'will', 'come', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'order', 'later', 'Anyway', 'remember', 'show', 'while', 'back', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'do', 'remember', 'many', 'episodes', 'vivid', 'detail', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'NBC.It', 'story', 'child', 'prodigy', 'who', 'able', 'pretend', 'so', 'vividly', 'how', 'person', 'would', 'act', 'able', 'become', 'person', 'Fast', 'forward', '15', 'so', 'years', 'have', 'fully', 'grown', 'Jarod', 'who', 'finally', 'decided', 'escape', 'institution', 'been', 'using', 'better', 'part', 'young', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'said', 'Institution', 'was', 'responsible', 'parents', 'deaths.The', 'show', 'charm', 'main', 'actor', 'ability', 'make', 'pretending', 'be', 'different', 'people', 'believable', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'hero', 'who', 'still', 'goodness', 'people.Another', 'great', 'memory', 'show', 'relationship', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'agent', 'Institution', 'forget', 'had', 'name', 'chasing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'happen', 'love', 'story-', 'much', 'relationship', 'played', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'also', 'daughter', 'Institution', 'Director', 'met', 'Jarod', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'present', 'day', 'interactions', 'are', 'limited', 'mostly', 'Jarod', 'so', 'adept', 'evading', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'where', 'do', 'get', 'interact', 'lot.It', 'sad', 'lost', 'track', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'NBC', 'was', 'CBS', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'moved', 'Turner', 'Network', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'seasons', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'bet', 'anything', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'it.Now', 'what', 'hear', 'TV', 'movie', 'Pretender']",N/A
874513,A33VYK55SK5B4S,B0006UEVTK,"B. Allen-Trick ""Meatrace""","[6, 6]","I was an avid fan of this series since I first saw it back in 1996. I never thought it got the attention it deserved, and I was convinced I'd never see it on DVD.Well I've been pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know, The Pretender is a show about Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) who, after years in captivity at the Centre, where his super-genius was unknowingly used for ill, wishes to right the wrongs of the world he sees in some sort of pennance. Every episode Jarod assumes a new identity to seek justice for those who can no longer speak for themselves. This usually involved inflicting whatever torment the victim endured on those responsible before turning them over to the proper authorities. You could call him a vigilante, but I prefer to think of him as a Benevolent Sociopath.The only negative thing I can say about the show is that it is more than a bit formulaic, especially in the earlier seasons. But that's half the fun, like a good detective who always gets his man, it's the joy of watching him at work. Later in the series we get a lot more backstory on the Centre gang, and a very solid story arc, to which regrettably we never see closure.As far as the DVD set is concerned, it's relatively bare-bones. The video and audio are both crisp, or at least as much as you can expect from a 10 year old cult tv show and probably a couple notches up. The box set is very compact, on 4 double sided discs, two discs to a slim-case and two slim-cases to the box set.The flipper discs annoy me, but not enough to detract from the end result, which is a solid box set of an excellent show at a reasonable price with insightful extras. If you were ever a fan of the show there's no excuse not to pick this up and if the description intrigues you there's no better time to check it out.",4,A great show finally hits DVD,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1795,"['was', 'avid', 'fan', 'series', 'first', 'saw', 'back', '1996', 'never', 'thought', 'got', 'attention', 'deserved', 'was', 'convinced', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'DVD.Well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Pretender', 'show', 'Jarod', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'who', 'years', 'captivity', 'Centre', 'where', 'super-genius', 'was', 'unknowingly', 'used', 'ill', 'wishes', 'right', 'wrongs', 'world', 'sort', 'pennance', 'episode', 'Jarod', 'new', 'identity', 'seek', 'justice', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'speak', 'usually', 'involved', 'inflicting', 'torment', 'victim', 'endured', 'responsible', 'turning', 'proper', 'authorities', 'could', 'call', 'vigilante', 'prefer', 'think', 'Benevolent', 'Sociopath.The', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'more', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'especially', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'fun', 'good', 'detective', 'who', 'always', 'man', 'joy', 'watching', 'work', 'Later', 'series', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'backstory', 'Centre', 'gang', 'very', 'solid', 'story', 'arc', 'regrettably', 'never', 'see', 'closure.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'set', 'concerned', 'relatively', 'bare-bones', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'crisp', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'expect', '10', 'year', 'old', 'cult', 'tv', 'show', 'probably', 'couple', 'up', 'box', 'set', 'very', 'compact', '4', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'two', 'discs', 'slim-case', 'two', 'slim-cases', 'box', 'set.The', 'flipper', 'discs', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'end', 'result', 'solid', 'box', 'set', 'excellent', 'show', 'reasonable', 'price', 'insightful', 'extras', 'were', 'ever', 'fan', 'show', 'excuse', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'description', 'better', 'time', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","With its science fiction premise, soap-operatic storytelling, ironic humor, and sexy ethos, it's no wonder this show retains a huge cult following.  Nearly ten years after its ruthless cancelation, it retains the power to intrigue, titillate, amuse, and impress.  Where many shows from the late Nineties look painfully dated, this one remains watchable and fun over ten years later.Jarod is a postmodern superhero, a man who pretends to be something he's not so that he can do work others should have done.  But he's also a fugitive.  A shadowy conspiracy, The Centre, thinks it owns him, and Miss Parker, Sydney, and Broots are always hot on Jarod's heels.  He has to solve other people's problems while keeping one step ahead of his powerful pursuers.The story steals a pinch of the classic series ""The Fugitive"" but builds upon it, transforming itself into an entirely new beast.  Super-genius Jarod is a good hook for the audience: we relate to his wide-eyed wonder, his ability to identify paradoxes of modern life.  But he's one step ahead of us, challenging us to keep up.  And we want to, because he's such a compelling character.At times, early episodes are a bit wobbly, and could do with a little continuity work.  Jarod lives in better digs and has more freedom to roam the Centre than in later episodes.  I also wish there was more research, because some situations are implausible: are that many firefighters loafing on watch?  Did that Coast Guardsman sport a beard?  These things take me out of the moment.But if you can see your way past these hiccups, this is the kind of series that has been pushed off network TV by hip cynicism.  It believes in justice, human goodness, and resilience.  It's edgy but family-friendly.  And it's punchy enough to be watched repeatedly.  I wish more of this sort of show were still being produced these days.",4,Cult Classic,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,1860,"['science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'soap-operatic', 'storytelling', 'ironic', 'humor', 'sexy', 'ethos', 'wonder', 'show', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'Nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'ruthless', 'cancelation', 'power', 'intrigue', 'titillate', 'amuse', 'impress', 'Where', 'many', 'shows', 'late', 'Nineties', 'look', 'painfully', 'dated', 'one', 'watchable', 'fun', 'ten', 'years', 'later.Jarod', 'postmodern', 'superhero', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'work', 'others', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'also', 'fugitive', 'shadowy', 'conspiracy', 'Centre', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Sydney', 'Broots', 'are', 'always', 'hot', 'Jarod', 'heels', 'solve', 'other', 'people', 'problems', 'keeping', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'powerful', 'pursuers.The', 'story', 'steals', 'pinch', 'classic', 'series', 'Fugitive', 'transforming', 'entirely', 'new', 'beast', 'Super-genius', 'Jarod', 'good', 'hook', 'audience', 'relate', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'ability', 'identify', 'paradoxes', 'modern', 'life', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'challenging', 'keep', 'up', 'want', 'such', 'compelling', 'character.At', 'times', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'wobbly', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'continuity', 'work', 'Jarod', 'better', 'digs', 'more', 'freedom', 'roam', 'Centre', 'later', 'episodes', 'also', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'research', 'situations', 'are', 'implausible', 'are', 'many', 'firefighters', 'loafing', 'watch', 'Did', 'Coast', 'Guardsman', 'sport', 'beard', 'things', 'take', 'moment.But', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'hiccups', 'kind', 'series', 'been', 'pushed', 'off', 'network', 'TV', 'hip', 'cynicism', 'justice', 'human', 'goodness', 'resilience', 'edgy', 'family-friendly', 'punchy', 'enough', 'be', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'wish', 'more', 'sort', 'show', 'were', 'still', 'being', 'produced', 'days']",N/A

Weiss is an amazing Jarod and the counterpart of Ms. Parker is so much fun. As the show progresses you see more interactions between them and it's always fun to watch. I also really enjoyed Sydney and Broots (though later seasons introduce more characters and more Centre-based plots that, I think, are a little detrimental to the show).Some reviewers have said that this show is very predictable and I guess it is, at least in season one. It takes time for a show to get established and as the seasons go on the show becomes more and more in-depth and less of a formula.There are no episodes that I don't like, but Christmas George is one of my personal favorites as well as the one where Jarod first falls in love. This is a nice show with little violence, little swearing but great stories. It's smart and doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator to amuse viewers.There are four seasons (I think) and 2 made-for-tv movies...and I want more.

Classified as a science fiction show, ""The Pretender"" never quite fit the mold. Classified as great television, ""The Pretender"" lives up to it's billing.Michael T. Weiss plays Jarod. Taken as a young boy from his family, Jarod is trained by the shadow organization The Centre to be a Pretender. Basically, he plays out scenarios for his captors. Putting himself into the mind of the people he's forced to emulate.The series begins with the adult Jarod having escaped the Centre. His mission is simple, help those who need help while avoiding being recaptured. All the while, Jarod flashes back to his Centre simulations by means of the extensive video archive they kept on him. At any given time, 3 to 4 actors portray Jarod as he comes of age in these archives.He is tracked relentlessly by Miss Parker (Andrea Parker). She, along with tech whiz Broots (Jon Gries) and Jarod's Centre father-figure Sydney (Patrick Bauchau), are thwarted by Jarod week-in and week-out. But Parker is driven and focused, even if Sydney is less than enthusiastic about returning his charge to the Centre.Missing in this first season are many of the great elements which would follow in seasons two through four. But the groundwork is laid here in excellent fashion. It starts here as more of a ""Fugitive"" type chase. To say much more would spoil the fun of discovering this excellent series.There is a childlike glee in Weiss' early portrayal of Jarod. His discovery of Pez and ice cream for the first time is priceless. Parker is vicious, driven and sexy as can be right from the start. Broots could easily have been the prototype for ""Alias"" tech guy Marshall Flinkman. Bauchau gives Sydney a calm in the eye of the storm feel.Available for the first time on DVD in the US.

Weiss is very good in conveying the many different emotions required, but he is at his best when he is the exuberant little boy who is discovering all the things he missed in his secluded childhood.The formula for each episode is fairly consistent:  Jarod takes on a role to find out the truth behind mysterious deaths; he finds the culprit and brings them to justice in the manner in which their victims suffered.  All along, he's trying to find who he is and what happened to his parents and being pursued by the Centre, from which he escaped is being pursued by the gentlemanly Syndey; the over the top Miss Parker, the geeky Broots and the sinister Mr. Raines.  Andrea Parker, trying to combine all the characteristics of Emma Peel, Cruela DeVil and Bullwinkle's Natasha, is so lousy an actress you start to enjoy her campy performance.

Not that you would need any bonus features to fully appreciate what great value you are getting with this package because all by itself it is good enough!Actors Michael T. Weiss, Andrea Parker, Jon Gries and Patrick Bachau shine in Season 1 of The Pretender.Michael T. Weiss as Jarod is the perfect genius who is on the run, but still manages to find time to help others. Michael's dramatic range is on full display as he slips into a new role for each episode. He's definitely ""The Pretender.""Andrea Parker (Less than Perfect/ABC) as Miss Parker is perfect as the head of the team who leads the chase for the genius, Jarod. She is explosive, unapologetic, beautiful and dangerous. And yet, you don't know the half of her! You will fall in love with Andrea's smouldering portrayal of Miss Parker.Patrick Bachau as Sydney and Jon Gries as Broots add the perfect elements to balance the tension and drama that surround the chase for Jarod, even as the secrets to the Centre's past unfold in every episode.The Pretender is one of the best series to ever premiere on NBC. If you have never seen it, now is your chance to own it and you will never regret it as you get drawn into the fascinating plot lines and learn more about the characters as the first season unfolds.The S1 season set is almost as perfect as Jarod the Pretender! The set contains all 21 episodes from the first season (Pilot included), two commentaries and a 3-part 'making of' featurette. The making-of featurette is short but still entertaining and insightful with comments by Michael T. Weiss (Jarod), Patrick Bachau (Sydney), Jon Gries (Broots) and the series' creators Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle. Sadly comments by Andrea Parker are missing. The two episode commentaries include one for the pilot and one for the season finale. How apropos and delightful! This is the kind of DVD special feature that makes me rub my hands in glee!The episodes are all subtitled (English and Spanish) and closed-captioned, which I appreciate very much, and include English, French and Spanish audio!Also included in the DVD set are 5 original TV spots...very cool!! When they watch these, newbie fans will finally understand why Fox used that strange but familiar ""who are you"" music on the website for the Pretender S1 DVD!Artwork/galleries were excluded from this DVD set, but Fox did try its best to make up for that on the website. Perhaps they are being saved for future releases.In terms of the presentation of the DVD set, there are some things I would change/add:1) A 'play all' option for each disc/side (it boggles the mind that this was not included!)2) It would have been nice to have the 'making-of' featurette on a single disc side instead of spread over three sides3) Some kind of booklet/insert, even if it is single sheet but I suppose it was a cost-cutting strategy4) Some behind-the-scenes clips (I hope they will be included in future releases)Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a TV on DVD set that surpasses all expectations for TV on DVD releases, and will be a treasure to own for anyone who appreciates good television. If you have not had the pleasure of watching this show yet, you are missing out! Now I'm just waiting for the rest of the seasons and the two movies on DVD; and a third movie or a miniseries to wrap up all the storylines!For those who think having the episodes on double-sided discs is a shortcoming, I consider it a blessing because it kept the shipping cost down and I am sure it kept down other costs too. Besides which, there are many other DVD releases that come on double-sided discs, such as The Lord of the Rings. You just have to be a little more careful than with single-sided discs.",5,Michael T.

Miss Parker, a complex character, seems to be cruel at first, but there is more then what meets the eye... that goes for the Center as well and the whole storythe story of Jarod, now an adult, was stolen from his parents when he was just a little boy. He was stolen by a private organization called the center. The reason the center stole Jarod was on account of his brilliant mind. As Jarod grows older, he manages to escape the center, and that when we meat him, on the run. Miss parker (his threat no.1) and Sidney (his father figure) are sent after him, to catch him and bring him back...... But jarod is deadsett against that has he is finally free and on the search for his family.Jarod is a grown man, but still a kid in many ways, getting know the world, and seeing the world and things we as viewers might take for granted. In each episode he discovers new things, and on his quest to find his family, and himself, he helps people along the way.

Along the way we watch as Jarod proves himself as an outstanding pilot and investigator. He is able to solve the crime with the help of mathematics and a universal remote.After figuring out the big picture Jarod decides to set a trap for the culprit by recreating the events surrounding the crash. In the end the bad guy is caught and the bad software is scrapped.

874552,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B0006UEVTK,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 1]","This show started out as a mid-season replacement in '96 on NBC. However, The ""Pretender"" went on to prove its worth in the prime-time ratings-game, season after season.The ""Pretender"" could best be summed-up as part of a sub-genre of the Action-adventure category; the Chase-show. The Chase-show always revolves around one basic plot-line; the main character(s) are running from, and/or to someone, or something. These Chase-shows can be some of the worst on TV, or some of the best. The ""Pretender"" falls into the latter category, in my humble opinion.The main character in the series, Jared, was kidnapped as a child, and whisked away to a heinous organization called the ""Centre"". Jared happens to be a genius, and he's used by those at the ""Centre"", to create ingenious methods to destroy their enemies. As an innocent child, who'd been swiped from his family, Jared has no choice but to go along with those at the ""Centre"", who exploit his genius IQ.As an adult, and by then fully aware of the exploitation he'd been forced to endure by the ""Centre"" during his childhood, Jared escapes. He's pursued by his former mentor (and former father-figure) Sydney. Joining in the quest to capture Jared, are the rabidly-determined femme-fatale, Miss Parker, and her computer-whiz henchman, Broots.Jared manages to elude his would-be captors, by impersonating a different member of a profession in each episode. Throughout the series, Jared had posed as a doctor, lawyer, policeman, airline pilot, etc., etc., etc. One of the main reasons the show held my interest, was to see who Jared would impersonate in the next episode. Whenever Jared morphed into one professional or another, he got to help out others in trouble, while keeping one-step-ahead of his pursuers from the ""Centre"".Jared also kept trying to find out about, and get in contact with, his real family, during the course of the series. As someone who had been cruelly wrenched away from his family in childhood, he was a man determined to solve the puzzle of his past.Then, there was also the sub-plot running through this series. This involved how Sydney, Miss Parker, and Broots, were all just pawns of the ""Centre"" themselves. The real evil character in the show, and the one who had orchestrated Jared's childhood kidnapping, was Mr. Raines.As the series progressed, Miss Parker, Sydney and Broots, together tried to figure out just what the sinister ""Centre"" was up to, and how to stop it. This all made for an Adventure-show with much more depth, and character-development, than most of its ilk.Overall, I'd say the that, ""Pretender"" was the best of all the Adventure-series, which were on TV during the 90s.",5,Best of the 90s Adventure-shows.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2675,"['show', 'started', 'out', 'mid-season', 'replacement', ""'96"", 'NBC', 'However', 'Pretender', 'went', 'prove', 'worth', 'prime-time', 'ratings-game', 'season', 'season.The', 'Pretender', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'summed-up', 'part', 'sub-genre', 'Action-adventure', 'category', 'Chase-show', 'Chase-show', 'always', 'one', 'basic', 'plot-line', 'main', 'character', 's', 'are', 'running', 'and/or', 'someone', 'something', 'Chase-shows', 'can', 'be', 'worst', 'TV', 'best', 'Pretender', 'latter', 'category', 'humble', 'opinion.The', 'main', 'character', 'series', 'Jared', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'whisked', 'away', 'heinous', 'organization', 'called', 'Centre', 'Jared', 'be', 'genius', 'used', 'Centre', 'create', 'ingenious', 'methods', 'destroy', 'enemies', 'innocent', 'child', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'swiped', 'family', 'Jared', 'choice', 'go', 'along', 'Centre', 'who', 'exploit', 'genius', 'IQ.As', 'adult', 'then', 'fully', 'aware', 'exploitation', ""'d"", 'been', 'forced', 'endure', 'Centre', 'childhood', 'Jared', 'pursued', 'former', 'mentor', 'former', 'father-figure', 'Sydney', 'Joining', 'quest', 'capture', 'Jared', 'are', 'rabidly-determined', 'femme-fatale', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'computer-whiz', 'henchman', 'Broots.Jared', 'elude', 'would-be', 'captors', 'impersonating', 'different', 'member', 'profession', 'episode', 'series', 'Jared', 'had', 'posed', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'policeman', 'airline', 'pilot', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'show', 'held', 'interest', 'was', 'see', 'who', 'Jared', 'would', 'impersonate', 'next', 'episode', 'Whenever', 'Jared', 'morphed', 'one', 'professional', 'got', 'help', 'out', 'others', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'one-step-ahead', 'pursuers', 'Centre', '.Jared', 'also', 'kept', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'get', 'contact', 'real', 'family', 'course', 'series', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'cruelly', 'wrenched', 'away', 'family', 'childhood', 'was', 'man', 'determined', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'past.Then', 'was', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'running', 'series', 'involved', 'how', 'Sydney', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Broots', 'were', 'just', 'pawns', 'Centre', 'real', 'evil', 'character', 'show', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'orchestrated', 'Jared', 'childhood', 'kidnapping', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Raines.As', 'series', 'progressed', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Sydney', 'Broots', 'together', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'sinister', 'Centre', 'was', 'up', 'how', 'stop', 'made', 'Adventure-show', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'character-development', 'most', 'ilk.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'Pretender', 'was', 'best', 'Adventure-series', 'were', 'TV', '90s']",N/A

The twist is that he was kidnapped as a very young child, so in addition to his chamelion adventures, he also is seeking his lost family, and even more powerful, is trying to catch up with a childhood lost.  His is a genius with a sense of honor, but he is also a child and as such, his 'justice' is often a bit extreme.  Michael T. Weiss is a great but little seen actor, and this is one of his most impressive works (the other being ""Jeffrey"").

While on the run Jarod helps those less fortunate than himself as he takes on new identities in every episode. Michael T. Weiss' droll performance and the multiple storylines keep ""The Pretender"" entertaining and involving.Fox does another stellar job with a sharp transfer. The stereo sound comes across with nice clarity. Since this series was produced before many shows were done in the surround format, there's no opportunity to take advantage of the format. The economic decision to put this out on four dual sided dual layered discs may have brought the price down so that the Fox could include a featurette and commentary tracks but it also makes these discs highly more likely to become damaged with wear and tear over time. The discs are packed with two each in a single container facing each other. While both are slightly recessed in the slimline packaging, it's very likely that the discs will come into contact with each other and become scratched. I'd suggest purchasing 2 additional slimline cases so that you only have one disc in each slimline holder. It'll better protect the set. Given the care in the transfers, extras and commentary tracks, I'm disappointed and surprised that Fox would take such a short cut as it doesn't reduce the overall production cost all that much nor does it increase the price significantly either.The three part ""Making of"" featurette is the highlight of the extras included here. Spread over four dual sided dual layered discs, the three part featurette focuses on the creation of the series, casting and performers that ultimately inhabited the roles adding and expanding on them. Featuring lots of interviews with the writers/producers/creators and many of the actors from the series, it's a nice trio of featurettes. My only complaint is that you can't watch them all as one featurette because they are spread out over all the discs. We also get the original TV spots advertising the show as part of the extras.A number of episodes feature commentary tracks but the best is on the season finale two-part episode. ""Dragon House"" features creator/writer/producer Craig W. Van Sickle, Steven Long Mitchell, director Fred Keller and actor Jon Gries. We discover, for example, that actor Weiss was the only choice for the show because he could embody both the child-like wonder of the character and the darker elements that haunt him from his past.A marvelous series that, despite it's dark tone, kept audiences guessing ""The Pretender"" looks marvelous on DVD and appears intact. I didn't notice any editing or music changes like I've seen with other popular series. The packaging is another matter entirely and, although it's likely it won't be changed for later seasons, it should be. While I didn't mind the slim line sets all that much to begin with I do mind the dual sided dual layered discs packaged this way. It increases the likelihood of damage to the set.",5,"Yes, he's the great pretender...",1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,3485,"['Jarod', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'can', 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'tinker', 'tailor', 'solider', 'spy', ""n't"", 'matter', 'superior', 'intellect', 'chameleon', 'ability', 'inhabit', 'role', 'What', 'Jarod', 'search', 'past', 'wanting', 'escape', 'present', 'child', 'Jarod', 'was', 'abducted', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'called', 'Centre', 'people', 'Jarod', 'own', 'insidious', 'means', 'Jarod', 'escapes', 'pursued', 'Sydney', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'Carnivale', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Andre', 'Parker', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'ER', 'run', 'Jarod', 'less', 'fortunate', 'new', 'identities', 'episode', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'droll', 'performance', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'keep', 'Pretender', 'entertaining', 'involving.Fox', 'stellar', 'job', 'sharp', 'transfer', 'stereo', 'sound', 'nice', 'clarity', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'many', 'shows', 'were', 'done', 'surround', 'format', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'format', 'economic', 'decision', 'put', 'out', 'four', 'dual', 'sided', 'dual', 'layered', 'discs', 'may', 'have', 'brought', 'price', 'down', 'so', 'Fox', 'could', 'include', 'featurette', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'also', 'discs', 'highly', 'more', 'likely', 'become', 'damaged', 'wear', 'tear', 'time', 'discs', 'are', 'packed', 'two', 'single', 'container', 'facing', 'other', 'are', 'slightly', 'recessed', 'slimline', 'packaging', 'very', 'likely', 'discs', 'will', 'come', 'contact', 'other', 'become', 'scratched', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'purchasing', '2', 'additional', 'slimline', 'cases', 'so', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'disc', 'slimline', 'holder', ""'ll"", 'better', 'protect', 'set', 'Given', 'care', 'transfers', 'extras', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'surprised', 'Fox', 'would', 'take', 'such', 'short', 'cut', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'overall', 'production', 'cost', 'much', 'increase', 'price', 'significantly', 'either.The', 'three', 'part', 'Making', 'featurette', 'highlight', 'extras', 'included', 'here', 'Spread', 'four', 'dual', 'sided', 'dual', 'layered', 'discs', 'three', 'part', 'featurette', 'creation', 'series', 'casting', 'performers', 'ultimately', 'inhabited', 'roles', 'adding', 'expanding', 'Featuring', 'lots', 'interviews', 'writers/producers/creators', 'many', 'actors', 'series', 'nice', 'trio', 'featurettes', 'only', 'complaint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'featurette', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'discs', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'TV', 'spots', 'advertising', 'show', 'part', 'extras.A', 'number', 'episodes', 'feature', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'best', 'season', 'finale', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Dragon', 'House', 'creator/writer/producer', 'Craig', 'W.', 'Van', 'Sickle', 'Steven', 'Long', 'Mitchell', 'director', 'Fred', 'Keller', 'actor', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'discover', 'example', 'actor', 'Weiss', 'was', 'only', 'choice', 'show', 'could', 'embody', 'child-like', 'wonder', 'character', 'darker', 'haunt', 'past.A', 'marvelous', 'series', 'dark', 'tone', 'kept', 'audiences', 'guessing', 'Pretender', 'marvelous', 'DVD', 'intact', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'editing', 'music', 'changes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'popular', 'series', 'packaging', 'matter', 'entirely', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'changed', 'later', 'seasons', 'should', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slim', 'line', 'that', 'much', 'begin', 'do', 'mind', 'dual', 'sided', 'dual', 'layered', 'discs', 'packaged', 'way', 'likelihood', 'damage', 'set']",N/A
