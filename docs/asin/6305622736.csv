Yes, this sequel is simply horrendous, lacking any of the psychological and visceral scares of the original, and certainly missing any of the intriguing storytelling.  Tony Todd is still an imposing figure as Candyman, but Derrico is awful, and why didn't she realize the only thing that could have made her performance bearable was showing some nudity?",1,3rd time really isn't the charm.,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,456,"['Candyman', 'great-great-great-granddaughter', 'someone', 'played', 'Donna', 'Derrico', 'Yes', 'sequel', 'simply', 'horrendous', 'lacking', 'psychological', 'visceral', 'scares', 'original', 'certainly', 'missing', 'intriguing', 'storytelling', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'still', 'imposing', 'figure', 'Candyman', 'Derrico', 'awful', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'performance', 'bearable', 'was', 'showing', 'nudity']",Candyman 3: Day of the Dead VHS

Yet, out of the three that are out now, this is my least favorite of the series. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie but seems to lack the creepiness of the first two.(Not even the gratuitous bra/panty and T&amp;A shots could save this movie, I'm afraid, and there's alot more in here than the previous two. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.) It's just that the first two movies took more of a visceral approach to the horror and this movie seems to take a back seat to it. There's too much recapping going on about his life history, which is fine for those new to the series, but too much emphasis is put on it. Us Hardcore Candyman fans already know all about it. All in all, though, everyone gives a good performance in the movie. It's a good, decent Candyman movie but one I feel coulda been better. Much better.If and when they come out with a fourth in the series, I do hope and pray they don't make it come out like this one. Candyman is a good creepy series that shouldn't be tarnished by giving that creepiness a back seat.",3,Candyman 3:Day of the Dead is good but coulda' been better..,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,1164,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Candyman', 'movies', 'were', 'genuinely', 'creepy', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'three', 'are', 'out', 'now', 'least', 'favorite', 'series', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'movie', 'lack', 'creepiness', 'first', 'two', 'Not', 'even', 'gratuitous', 'bra/panty', 'T', 'amp', 'A', 'shots', 'could', 'save', 'movie', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'alot', 'more', 'here', 'previous', 'two', 'Not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'mind', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'took', 'more', 'visceral', 'approach', 'horror', 'movie', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'too', 'much', 'recapping', 'going', 'life', 'history', 'fine', 'new', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'put', 'Us', 'Hardcore', 'Candyman', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'everyone', 'good', 'performance', 'movie', 'good', 'decent', 'Candyman', 'movie', 'one', 'feel', 'coulda', 'been', 'better', 'Much', 'better.If', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'fourth', 'series', 'do', 'hope', 'pray', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'Candyman', 'good', 'creepy', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'tarnished', 'giving', 'creepiness', 'back', 'seat']",Candyman 3: Day of the Dead VHS

CANDYMAN 3 is filled with ridiculous racial stereotypes, dreadful dialog, and pitiful performances. Playboy Playmate Donna D'Errico only has two things going for her, and they aren't her sharp wit or keen acting prowess. She is simply atrocious in the lead, and would have been better off sticking with Baywatch. Turi Meyer doesn't do much better as director, creating very little suspense or atmosphere as he turns away from the Gothic ghost story and embraces the Slasher genre. His attempt to recreate the stylish and moody Mardi Gras sequence from the second film falls flat. Worst off is poor Tony Todd, who desperately tries to carry the weight of the film himself, but whose performance ultimately suffers from the sophomoric script.

The only thing that it didn't have as much gore as the 3rd one does. But it does have quite some. The movie is about a man that was a slave and was killed by being covered in homey and then covered in a swarm of bees. His right hand then was chopped off and a bloody hook was jammed on. He came back. Anytime someone would look into a mirror and say his name (candyman) five times, he would appear and kill them by gutting them though their stomach neormous times causing guts and blood to go everywhere with his hook. It's a pretty good series. The third one is the best and especially on the DVD. Ithas great sound and picture quality. It only has a trailer.

I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}.As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien & director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little.There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it.

I  mean  it  uses  EVERYTHING  from  the  previous  films,  ESPECIALLY  Candyman's  diolouge!PLOT:  ONCE  AGAIN  Candyman  haunts  his  family  of  lonely,  beautiful  lead  CAROLINE(  typical  ).  Which  is  the  daughter  of  the  lead  from  the  2nd  entry.  But  the  lead  from  the  second  entry  is  killed  offscreen,  so  now  Caroline  is  alone(  typical  ).  Caroline's  friend  Mickey,  or  Miguel,  whatever  his  name  WAS,  opens  an  art  gallery  of  Daniel  Robentei's  paintings.  Caroline  is  offened  that  Mickey  calls  her  former  family  member  Candyman.  I  would  go  over  that,  but  it  is  all  in  part  1  and  2,  so  I'll  skip  it.  Anywho,  Caroline  accidently  ressurects  her  old  family  member  who  is  formally  known  as  CANDYMAN.  You  have  to  say  his  name  5  times  in  the  mirror  to  summon  him.  He  kills  a  bunch  of  people  with  the  hook  for  his  hand(  typical  ),  which  is  explicitly  dull  if  you  HAVE  seen  the  first  to  films,  most  of  it  is  just  repetative.  But  fear  not,  there  is  not  all  lost  in  this  latest  entry!  There  is  a  plot  element  that  I  particuarlly  enjoyed  about  this  entry.  In  this  one,  it  is  kind  of  like  a  battle  amongst  the  characters  in  which  they  were  all  trying  to  blame  each  other  on  who  commited  the  Candyman  murders.  Will  Caroline  be  blamed?  Or  will  it  be  Detective  Sam  and  his  partner  or  Caroline's  recent  boyfriend?  I  won't  tell,  or  say  that  it  is  not  predictible.CHARACTERS:  Caroline(  Donna  D'Errico  )  fills  up  her  horror  role  as  the  babe  trying  to  survive  from  the  maniac(  cough,  typical  ).  She  is  also  probably  the  only  way  the  movie  team  was  able  to  put  this  B-  movie  out  to  Blockbuster,  and  they  use  her  and  Tony  for  the  advertising(  check  out  the  back  cover  and  you'll  get  me  ).  Tony  Todd  is  same  old,  same  old,  again.  Detective  Jamal  is  kinda  cool  but  we  don't  see  enough  of  him.  The  racist  cops  are  the  only  other  new  aspect  to  this  entry,  and  they  are...(  cough,  cough,  typical  ).  Caroline's  boyfriend  was  on  the  original  NIGHTMARE  ON  ELM  STREET,  besides  that,  he  is  boring.SUMMARY:  This  is  no  doubt  a  B-  movie.  The  horror  movie  cliches  are  noticable  and  the  plot  is  mostly  predictacle.  The  ending  was  old  and(  cough,  cough,  cough,  typical  )  .On  a  positive  note,  this  one  is  more  compact  and  contains  less  plot  holes  than  the  previous  films.  And  it  is  easily  the  DARKEST  in  the  series,  which  was  a  very  unpredictable  step  above  Part  2's  enthusiastic  feel.AND:  Yo  Candyman  fans!  This  is  NOT  a  trilogy  series.

Some more of Candyman's past/the family legacy is explored, though the second film in this trilogy had more information. The actress who plays Caroline is pretty, but her acting is just okay. Not great but not sucky either. There's murders happening and Caroline is under investigation by a police officer who is a very unlikeable guy. Of course, Candyman is behind these murders, but of course the police don't think a urban legend is responsible for these attacks.The ending to this movie shouldn't really surprise you - you could kind of guess what would happen before it did happen, especially after Caroline's mom tells her to 'destroy the myth'.

O'Blenis,"[8, 8]","Taken on its own - without having seen Candyman 1 and 2 - I may well have enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did, because, it's far from garbage; it just never gets close to the bar the others set.  It's techically well-made, but lacking on several fronts.  My main fault is that the Candyman character's essence seemed to get lost somewhere - previously he was a horrifying but tragic figure, a monster where you can see why he became what he is; whereas here he comes off just evil, not sympathetic or tragic at all, and his prevoiusly poetic lamentations come across weakly, almost whiny at times, which was definately not the case in the first 2 movies.  He veers dangerously close to being just 'evil-for-evil's sake', like Freddy Krueger, instead of the way he was.  That works well for the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies; Freddy is Supposed to be a totally evil, unsympathetic fiend without a single redeeming trait in his burned body - that's one of the main things that made the Elm Streets (the best of them, anyway) so excellent and the Freddy character one of the great horror icons.  Candyman is a great horror icon too but for entirely different reasons, and it seems to me that kind of got lost in here.I don't mean to be unnecessarily harsh. ""Candyman: Day Of The Dead"" certainly has its good points - solid production, some beautiful California scenery (not the least of which is female lead Donna D'Errico), an unnerving and terrific opening sequence, and another fine performance by Candyman Tony Todd, who manages to impress even with significantly weaker material to work with.  It was a valiant attempt by the filmmakers (who did better on the movie ""Sleepstalker: Last Rites Of the Sandman""), and I guess I'd still recommend this for Candyman fans - some people may enjoy this more than I did - but in my mind it's still a big comedown from what came before.

Of course, the Baywatch beauties are an eye-feast but when it comes  to intriguing characters no way - I could have cared less about what was  happening to them. Watch out for tired, rehashed special effects. What's  with the pasted on bees!  My advice is to go rent the original Candman  again and enjoy the movie.",2,Typical sequel fare - nothing original,945820800,"12 22, 1999",1999,541,"['avid', 'horror', 'fan', 'LOVED', 'Candyman', 'LIKED', 'Candyman', 'Farewell', 'Flesh', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'Candyman', '3', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'even', 'Candyman', 'was', 'not', 'intimidating', 'scary', 'course', 'Baywatch', 'beauties', 'are', 'eye-feast', 'when', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Watch', 'out', 'tired', 'rehashed', 'special', 'effects', 'What', 'pasted', 'bees', 'advice', 'go', 'rent', 'original', 'Candman', 'again', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Candyman 3: Day of the Dead VHS

The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him.There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first ""Candyman"" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he's right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage.",1,Candyman 3:  The Day of the Dead  (1999),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2830,"['Director', 'Turi', 'MeyerCast', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Donna', ""D'Errico"", 'Alexia', 'Robinson', 'Jsu', 'Garcia', 'Mark', 'Adair-Rios', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'Elizabeth', 'Guber', 'Rena', 'Riffel', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Jr.Running', 'Time', '93', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'bloody', 'violence', 'gore', 'sexuality', 'language.The', 'third', 'series', 'derived', 'concept', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Day', 'Dead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'subtitle', 'down', 'well-trodden', 'path', 'already', 'navigated', 'Halloween', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'movies', 'taking', 'decent', 'concept', 'flushing', 'down', 'toilet', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'near', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'relied', 'atmosphere', 'rather', 'gore', 'first', 'sequel', 'was', 'bearable', 'completely', 'routine', 'one', 'just', 'load', 'rubbish', 'Donna', ""D'Errico"", 'Baywatch', 'what', 'spectacle', 'credibility', 'Caroline', 'McKeever', 'great', 'great', 'granddaughter', 'feared', 'Candyman', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'once', 'again', 'once', 'normal', 'man', 'now', 'apparition', 'who', 'slaughter', 'everyone', 'dare', 'say', 'name', 'five', 'times', 'front', 'mirror', 'Caroline', 'name', 'five', 'times', 'front', 'mirror', 'up', 'murder', 'nearest', 'dearest', 'Candyman', 'way', 'various', 'bad', 'actors', 'Caroline', 'up', 'new', 'pal', 'David', 'Nick', 'Corri', 'find', 'collection', 'paintings', 'knocked', 'up', 'Candyman', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'stopping', 'not', 'single', 'thing', 'here', ""n't"", 'scavenged', 'first', 'Candyman', 'film', 'other', 'ropy', 'horror', 'movie', 'produced', 'caveman', 'days', 'screenplay', 'so', 'lazy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'connect', 'characters', 'plot', 'photography', 'bright', 'glossy', 'odds', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'dark', 'story', 'nothing', 'direction', 'atmosphere', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'movie', 'so', 'little', 'effort', 'been', 'put', 'make', 'scary', 'ending', 'outrageous', 'cop', 'thought', 'gone', 'developing', 'themes', 'structuring', 'plot', 'one', 'here', 'talented', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'depth', 'having', ""D'Errico"", 'running', 'around', 'variety', 'tight', 'vests', 'rest', 'performances', 'are', 'poor', 'too', 'none', 'are', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', ""D'Errico"", 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'screaming', 'breathing', 'erratically', 'Surely', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'characters', 'Candyman', 'constant', 'repetition', 'scenes', 'where', 'stick', 'hook', 'someone', 'stomach', 'fact', 'makers', 'movie', 'think', 'Candyman', 'so', 'terrifying', 'very', 'sight', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'will', 'strike', 'fear', 'hearts', 'sign', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'even', 'try', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'master', 'horror', 'first', 'claimed', 'be', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'sequels', 'movies', 'are', 'garbage']",Candyman 3: Day of the Dead VHS

After a thoroughly pointless intro, Candyman 3 gives a crash course in the history of Daniel Robitaille (otherwise known as Candyman). We're introduced to Caroline (Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch), Daniel's great great granddaughter, trying her best to not look like a deer caught in the headlights (she is not successful). A stranger gives her some candy. Quite literally sweets to the sweet. Maybe they thought that was clever? Caroline's friend Miguel is putting on a showing of Candyman's artwork. There's a slightly altered re-telling of the origin, perhaps from Miguel's understanding. Or maybe they were just lazy. Caroline then gets peer pressured into saying his name five times into the mirror in front of the art gallery crowd. Did I mention she seems to forget her bra on every occasion? This is perhaps why Candyman wants to get it on with a relative. Look at me, trying to make sense of this. Later, the paintings are stolen and Miguel is killed. The bumbling detectives (""bad cop/bad cop"") are on Caroline's case, thinking she's the Candyman. Where have I heard this before? Trying to interfere is the son of the 4th Ghostbuster, Ernie Hudson, Jr. Because they couldn't get the 4th Ghostbuster. Incredibly, Candyman suffers the same fate as the Leprechaun in Leprechaun 2.
