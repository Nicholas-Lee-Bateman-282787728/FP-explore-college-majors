Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[10, 12]","William Hurt + an allstar cast star in this character study of an overly methodical divorcee and his profession on who traveling buisness men can make their trips as dull as his life is.Seen the movie?You'll understand my review then because I'll speak directly about the characters.Macon (Hurt) and his astranged wife Sarah have lost their only son to a horrible murder and have grown apart.His siblings live in a house together and live a comically over-organized life.Meanwhile Macon is pursued by his BEYOND pushy dog trainer Murial Prichett and is forced to make a serious choice-between his ex with whom his relationship is always tenative or the fresh faced (but I should point out obviously younger) Murial.He chooses the later,if only for the reason she followed him on a trip to Paris (where they end up eating at a Buger King.????).And as pushy and quirky as she is one actually tends to relate more to Geena Davis's Murial character.Macon Leary comes off as too controlled and insensative and his wife has lost faith in the world due to her loss.The side characters include Macon'shyper organised sister Rose and her relationship with his eccentric boss Julian (portrayed by Bil Pullman) who proceeds to eat two helpings of Rose's highly undercooked turkey at Thanksgiving.More a slightly ubsurdist character study then a comedy,seeing as nothing really romantic happens and the leading man is actually an (intentionally) pathetic individual'The Accidental Tourist' stands out heads and tales above todays faceless comedies bogged down with  mindless teen flicks and vapid 'chick flicks'.This movie had some intelligence and wittyness to it and with the exception of the wonderful movie 'Amelie' very little is being done in this vein nowadays.",5,The Armchair Traveller,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,1756,"['William', 'Hurt', '+', 'allstar', 'cast', 'star', 'character', 'study', 'overly', 'methodical', 'divorcee', 'profession', 'who', 'traveling', 'men', 'can', 'make', 'trips', 'as', 'dull', 'life', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'review', 'then', ""'ll"", 'speak', 'directly', 'characters.Macon', 'Hurt', 'astranged', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'have', 'lost', 'only', 'son', 'horrible', 'murder', 'have', 'grown', 'apart.His', 'siblings', 'live', 'house', 'together', 'live', 'comically', 'over-organized', 'life.Meanwhile', 'Macon', 'pursued', 'BEYOND', 'pushy', 'dog', 'trainer', 'Murial', 'Prichett', 'forced', 'make', 'serious', 'choice-between', 'ex', 'whom', 'relationship', 'always', 'tenative', 'fresh', 'faced', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'obviously', 'younger', 'Murial.He', 'later', 'only', 'reason', 'followed', 'trip', 'Paris', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'eating', 'Buger', 'King.', '.And', 'pushy', 'quirky', 'one', 'actually', 'relate', 'more', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Murial', 'character.Macon', 'Leary', 'off', 'too', 'controlled', 'insensative', 'wife', 'lost', 'faith', 'world', 'due', 'loss.The', 'side', 'characters', 'include', ""Macon'shyper"", 'organised', 'sister', 'Rose', 'relationship', 'eccentric', 'boss', 'Julian', 'portrayed', 'Bil', 'Pullman', 'who', 'eat', 'two', 'helpings', 'Rose', 'highly', 'undercooked', 'turkey', 'Thanksgiving.More', 'slightly', 'ubsurdist', 'character', 'study', 'then', 'comedy', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'really', 'romantic', 'happens', 'leading', 'man', 'actually', 'intentionally', 'pathetic', ""individual'The"", 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'out', 'heads', 'tales', 'todays', 'faceless', 'comedies', 'bogged', 'down', 'mindless', 'teen', 'flicks', 'vapid', ""'chick"", ""flicks'.This"", 'movie', 'had', 'intelligence', 'wittyness', 'exception', 'wonderful', 'movie', ""'Amelie"", 'very', 'little', 'being', 'done', 'vein']",N/A
249652,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301321332,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The bottom line here is that `The Accidental Tourist' is a very strange take on the romantic drama.  It is a very moving and memorable film, and it lingered with me for weeks after seeing it for the first time.  It is beautifully acted, ravishingly sincere in tone and depth and truly a remarkable piece of work considering the prose.  But, it is strange and it can be considered as such, and thus its tone could be considered a detractor (as it has been by some).But I love it.The film centers around a man named Macon.  Macon is a repressed soul.  He writes travel books, enlightening the businessman (who dreads leaving the comforts of home) on how to take home with him and spare himself the inconvenience of stepping outside of his comfort zone.  Macon's guarded nature has caused a rift in his family.  Having recently lost their son in a tragic act of violence, Macon and his wife Sarah are falling apart.  Sarah needed her husband to be there for her, emotionally, but Macon's personality closed him off to her entirely.  So, in an act of desperation, she leaves him.  In an attempt to move on, Macon buys a dog for comfort and companionship; but the dog needs some stern training and that's where a young and strangely endearing woman named Muriel comes in.  Hoping to connect with Macon on a deeper level, Muriel pushes herself on him with reckless abandon, and soon Macon responds.  He needs her just as much as she wants him.  But, just as life begins to turn for Macon, he is saddled with a decision he doesn't really want to make.  When Sarah returns, begging for reconciliation, Macon needs to decide if he wants to try the battlefields of marriage one more time or cast it aside for something new and exciting in Muriel.I love the fact that the film feels distilled at moments, a feeling that helps level out the emotional relevance of the film.  I've often stated that 80's cinema had the tendency to add ungodly levels of melodramatic soap operatic elements to their films, and so watching a film like `The Accidental Tourist', that understands the understated and beautifully underscores a minimalist view of reality, is much appreciated.William Hurt, Geena Davis and Kathleen Turner are all wonderful here.  I don't think I fully understand the Oscar win for Davis (not against Weaver or McDormand for certain) but there is a moment, when she first hears of the tragedy that befell Macon's son, where without a word she won my heart (that embrace was so beautifully timed and executed).In other words, I totally disagree with the reviewer on this site (how dare you Marshall).  I'll be the first one to call out a film for being designed to manipulate the audience, but there are some films that are just genuinely tender and moving.This is one of those films.",5,Accidentally in love...,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2780,"['bottom', 'line', 'here', 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'very', 'strange', 'take', 'romantic', 'drama', 'very', 'moving', 'memorable', 'film', 'lingered', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'ravishingly', 'sincere', 'tone', 'depth', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'work', 'considering', 'prose', 'strange', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'such', 'thus', 'tone', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'detractor', 'been', '.But', 'love', 'it.The', 'film', 'centers', 'man', 'named', 'Macon', 'Macon', 'repressed', 'soul', 'travel', 'books', 'enlightening', 'businessman', 'who', 'leaving', 'comforts', 'home', 'how', 'take', 'home', 'spare', 'inconvenience', 'stepping', 'outside', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Macon', 'guarded', 'nature', 'caused', 'rift', 'family', 'Having', 'recently', 'lost', 'son', 'tragic', 'act', 'violence', 'Macon', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'Sarah', 'needed', 'husband', 'be', 'there', 'emotionally', 'Macon', 'personality', 'closed', 'off', 'entirely', 'So', 'act', 'desperation', 'attempt', 'move', 'Macon', 'dog', 'comfort', 'companionship', 'dog', 'stern', 'training', 'where', 'young', 'strangely', 'endearing', 'woman', 'named', 'Muriel', 'Hoping', 'connect', 'Macon', 'deeper', 'level', 'Muriel', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'soon', 'Macon', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'life', 'turn', 'Macon', 'saddled', 'decision', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'make', 'When', 'Sarah', 'begging', 'reconciliation', 'Macon', 'decide', 'try', 'battlefields', 'marriage', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'cast', 'aside', 'something', 'new', 'exciting', 'Muriel.I', 'love', 'fact', 'film', 'feels', 'distilled', 'moments', 'feeling', 'level', 'emotional', 'relevance', 'film', ""'ve"", 'often', 'stated', '80', 'cinema', 'had', 'tendency', 'add', 'ungodly', 'levels', 'melodramatic', 'soap', 'operatic', 'elements', 'films', 'so', 'watching', 'film', 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'understated', 'beautifully', 'minimalist', 'view', 'reality', 'much', 'Hurt', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'are', 'wonderful', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fully', 'understand', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Davis', 'not', 'Weaver', 'McDormand', 'certain', 'moment', 'when', 'first', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'Macon', 'son', 'where', 'word', 'won', 'heart', 'embrace', 'was', 'so', 'beautifully', 'timed', 'executed', '.In', 'other', 'words', 'totally', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'site', 'how', 'dare', 'Marshall', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'one', 'call', 'out', 'film', 'being', 'designed', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'are', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'genuinely', 'tender', 'moving.This', 'one', 'films']",N/A
249653,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6301321332,Bobby Underwood,"[7, 7]","William Hurt is absolutely brilliant as a man so damaged and insulated from his own life that he is about to implode in Lawrence Kasdan's adaptation of Anne Tyler's novel, perhaps the director's finest moment.Hurt is a father who cannot make sense of the random act of violence in which his son has been killed. In so much pain he is unable to comfort his equally traumatized wife, his marriage finally falls apart because he has decided to accept evil in the world and isolate himself from love in an effort to shield himself from further pain.Bill Pullman gives fine support as his understanding editor and friend. Hurt writes a series of books for the business person who is constantly in flight called the ""Accidental Tourist."" Hurt's family is a little strange and in spite of the serious subject matter Kasdan has sprinkled this film with some very funny true to life moments. One such episode involves the cooking of a Thanksgiving turkey and is hilarious!Geena Davis is the free spirit who attempts to connect with him and assuage Hurt's anguish, winning a well deserved Oscar for her performance. Her little boy, sweet and allergic to everything, is a constant reminder to him of his own son, however, prompting him to accept a brief but unsuccessful reconciliation with wife Kathleen Turner which may cost him everything.Hurt's tremendous performance and an understated score add to this wonderful and heartrending account of one man's personal angst as someone tries to drag him back among the living. One particularly moving scene in Davis' doorway where he expresses his inability to be like other people is absolutely devastating. Her kindness and personal generosity finally begin to wear down the walls, however, and he may just be able to love again, if it is not too late.This is a richly rewarding film for those willing to take the time and I highly recommend it.

His wife (Kathleen Turner) leaves him (their son has died), and Hurt mopes around, settling nicely into the void that's been created.

He resists, even takes up with his wife again, but Davis follows him to Europe and finally wins him there.The major problem is with Hurt: he acts as if he's in a comatose state all the time; in the novel that this was based on (same name), he was quirky and humorously obsessive - none of that is in the movie.

249656,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,6301321332,C. Rothlind,"[1, 1]","Trying to describe this film the term 'novelistic' comes to mind. It inhabits an intimate yet abstract, quasi mythological space, though the use of locations is completely realistic and authentic. It presents a purified world where life's commercial and chaotic urban dimensions don't penetrate. A hermetically sealed realm in which the actions and re-actions of the characters take precedence over everything else. Kasdan has a knack for getting at the core of a story with consummate subtlety, as he first demonstrated in Body Heat. He distills an atmosphere of stillness and intimacy that permeates every bit of business his actors engage in. I found myself watching this the last time I was really sick. I needed to expose myself to its vibe of interpersonal truth, if not to restore health, to make my misery less painful. Consider that indicative of the film's enduring value. A good deal of the credit must go to Kathleen Turner who lends her beautiful authenticity to every role she plays.There's nothing overtly dramatic about Accidental Tourist, which maintains its even keeled approach for the duration. Nothing is allowed to distract from the intense focus on character. Here: a disaffected middle-aged man marooned between the worlds of two different women, attempting to decide which one promises him the most happiness = opportunity for growth. The Accidental Tourist is a leisurely paced exercise in attentive listening filled with the little details of life, but never drags or fails to keep your attention. It wears its heart on its sleeve without being sentimental or saccharine.Hurt and Turner are excellent.

249658,A3FXT4UPI30K7S,6301321332,"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author""","[61, 63]","THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST has some of the most interesting dialogue ever heard in a film about relationships. The story begins when Macon Leary, a travel writer played by William Hurt, comes home to find his wife, Sarah, (played by Kathleen Turner) wants a divorce. This marriage has endured almost unbearable strain after the death of their only son, and Macon's coping strategy is to strive to keep things as they are. When Macon's welsh corgi becomes bad-tempered and starts to bite, Macon can't stand the thought of parting with the dog that was his son's childhood companion. Macon is forced to rely on others when he breaks his leg and moves in with his sister and brothers, and the movie really picks up momentum when he meets a sparkling divorcee dog trainer named Muriel Pritchett (played by Geena Davis). Muriel has her eyes on Macon Leary from the first moment she sees him, when she begins a long campaign to win this world-weary man over and bring joy back into his life. When Sarah finds out that Macon is seeing another woman, she has a change of heart about finalizing the divorce, and seeks a reconciliation. Macon's choice then becomes one of maintaining the status quo or navigating his way through uncertain yet exciting territories with someone new.Both the acting and the dialogue in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST are first-rate and highly memorable. Geena Davis steals the show with her shining performance of a quirky, life-positive divorced single mom with a single-minded interest in helping Macon Leary to become more than a reluctant sight-seer in life. My favorite line of dialogue in this dialogue-driven film is when Macon says to Sarah, ""I'm beginning to think that maybe it's not just how much you love someone, maybe what matters is who you are when you're with them."" I've contemplated this concept for years, and been continually inspired by it's significance.While this film may be considered slow-moving and somewhat sad, it ultimately delivers an uplifting and inspirational message of hope.",4,"Thought-Provoking, Slow-Paced Conflicted Romance",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2020,"['ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'most', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'heard', 'film', 'relationships', 'story', 'when', 'Macon', 'Leary', 'travel', 'writer', 'played', 'William', 'Hurt', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'divorce', 'marriage', 'endured', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'strain', 'death', 'only', 'son', 'Macon', 'coping', 'strategy', 'strive', 'keep', 'things', 'are', 'When', 'Macon', 'welsh', 'corgi', 'bad-tempered', 'bite', 'Macon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'thought', 'parting', 'dog', 'was', 'son', 'childhood', 'companion', 'Macon', 'forced', 'rely', 'others', 'when', 'leg', 'moves', 'sister', 'brothers', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'momentum', 'when', 'sparkling', 'divorcee', 'dog', 'trainer', 'named', 'Muriel', 'Pritchett', 'played', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Muriel', 'eyes', 'Macon', 'Leary', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'long', 'campaign', 'win', 'world-weary', 'man', 'bring', 'joy', 'back', 'life', 'When', 'Sarah', 'out', 'Macon', 'seeing', 'woman', 'change', 'heart', 'finalizing', 'divorce', 'reconciliation', 'Macon', 'choice', 'then', 'one', 'maintaining', 'status', 'quo', 'navigating', 'way', 'uncertain', 'yet', 'exciting', 'territories', 'someone', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'THE', 'ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'are', 'first-rate', 'highly', 'memorable', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'show', 'shining', 'performance', 'quirky', 'life-positive', 'divorced', 'single', 'mom', 'single-minded', 'interest', 'helping', 'Macon', 'Leary', 'become', 'more', 'reluctant', 'sight-seer', 'life', 'favorite', 'line', 'dialogue', 'dialogue-driven', 'film', 'when', 'Macon', 'Sarah', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'someone', 'maybe', 'what', 'matters', 'who', 'are', 'when', ""'re"", ""'ve"", 'contemplated', 'concept', 'years', 'been', 'continually', 'inspired', 'significance.While', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'slow-moving', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'inspirational', 'message', 'hope']",N/A

Kathleen Turner is so perfectly beautiful and perfect in every way and so is John Hurt as her husband.  But Kathleen is always belly aching about him.  I was vexed when I thought they were getting back together.  However, I dont know why Geena Davis chose Macon; probably  because he is a good provider and is good looking, the usual gambit. The boy is refreshingly not cute at all but of course, the dog is cute.  Its a good movie.

249662,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301321332,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 5]","One of the most insensitive questions I ever heard a media journalist pose to an actor was just after the 1989 Academy Awards had been handed out and a TV reporter asked a seemingly besotted Kathleen Turner about her co-star Geena Davis's Oscar winning performance.  ""When you're making a film, can you just tell when one of your fellow actors is turning in an Oscar worthy performance.""  Kathleen, as seemed her wont at the time, put on an affected Spanish accent and sort of Spanish danced around the question.  Neither Turner nor male lead William Hurt had even been nominated for THEIR stellar performances in this celebrated film. In a just world, they probably would have been.  But then again, in a truly JUST world, would we even have these stupid Awards.Of course, there's another very obvious reason why that reporter's question was so stupid: Turner and Davis only share a brief moment onscreen together, and they NEVER actually interact (that we see anyway).  Turner may have been viewing some of the rushes, but as for actual first hand impressions of her castmate's performance, how could she possibly have had much to say on that score.Now I know an actress as outspoken and sometimes downright brazen as Kathleen Turner hardly needs little ol' me to come to her defense, and actually, my main point is a quite different one.  What I'd really like to emphasize is that when dealing with a film like ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, one that exhibits such remarkable ENSEMBLE acting, critical focus on just one of the performers actually distorts the public perception of the film's overall quality.  The acting, the direction, the cinematography and the script are ALL top notch.  There are a great many reasons to see ACCIDENTAL TOURIST.  Geena Davis's performance as the eccentric Muriel Pritchett is but one.I'm sure I'm not the first one to wonder if Davis isn't actually too Hollywood pretty for the role of Muriel.  In the book, she comes across as a much less striking figure.  Davis wears the clothes--AND the attitude--but she still looks great.  If Madonna and Cyndi Lauper hadn't already gone the distance is establishing 1980s ""thrift shop chic,""  Davis might have singlehandedly pulled it off here.To the filmmakers credit, however, Muriel's stunning good looks are just about the only major departure from Anne Tyler's beautifully crafted novel.  If ever there were a text book case on how a script might remain true to the spirit of its source novel, this may be it.  The focus is rightly on William Hurt's eccentric and tormented character, the unwilling travel writer, Macon Leary and the two women in his life, his estranged wife Sarah (Turner) and the aforementioned (and equally eccentric) Muriel.  But secondary characters, including Macon's three eccentric siblings, his protective (and just as offbeat) publisher-cum-future-brother-in-law, and Muriel's chronically ailing seven year old son are just as lovingly drawn.  And they get just enough screen time to win our hearts.I could only recall one of the book's subplots that got anything like short shrift in the film: Muriel's friendship with a young neighborhood mechanic who shares the use of her car, and in the book, this initially mutually beneficial relationship goes precictably awry.  This relationship merits a mention in the film and then gets summarily dropped.  It's the kind of cut you can pretty much understand, but readers of the book might well wonder about the wisdom of bringing it up at all.  That's quibbling, I know. Viewers who have not read Tyler's book would scarcely notice the mention.  And that's as it should be.  This is not one of those films where you wonder if this or that allusion in the film was actually a well-developed subplot in the original source novel.Screenwriter-director Lawrence Kasdan has certainly had his ups and downs over the  years.  THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST--like other films he has both written and directed (BIG CHILL, GRAND CANYON, MUMFORD)--was decidedly one of the Ups.",4,From An Intentional Movie Goer,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,4004,"['One', 'most', 'insensitive', 'questions', 'ever', 'heard', 'media', 'journalist', 'pose', 'actor', 'was', 'just', '1989', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'had', 'been', 'handed', 'out', 'TV', 'reporter', 'asked', 'seemingly', 'besotted', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'co-star', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'When', ""'re"", 'making', 'film', 'can', 'just', 'tell', 'when', 'one', 'fellow', 'actors', 'turning', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Kathleen', 'seemed', 'wont', 'time', 'put', 'affected', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'sort', 'Spanish', 'danced', 'question', 'Turner', 'male', 'lead', 'William', 'Hurt', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'nominated', 'THEIR', 'stellar', 'performances', 'celebrated', 'film', 'just', 'world', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'then', 'again', 'truly', 'JUST', 'world', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'stupid', 'Awards.Of', 'course', 'very', 'obvious', 'reason', 'why', 'reporter', 'question', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'Turner', 'Davis', 'only', 'share', 'brief', 'moment', 'onscreen', 'together', 'NEVER', 'actually', 'interact', 'see', 'anyway', 'Turner', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'viewing', 'rushes', 'actual', 'first', 'hand', 'impressions', 'castmate', 'performance', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'say', 'score.Now', 'know', 'actress', 'outspoken', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'brazen', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'hardly', 'little', 'ol', 'come', 'defense', 'actually', 'main', 'point', 'quite', 'different', 'one', 'What', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'emphasize', 'when', 'dealing', 'film', 'ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'one', 'such', 'remarkable', 'ENSEMBLE', 'acting', 'critical', 'focus', 'just', 'one', 'performers', 'actually', 'public', 'perception', 'film', 'overall', 'quality', 'acting', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'script', 'are', 'ALL', 'top', 'notch', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'reasons', 'see', 'ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'performance', 'eccentric', 'Muriel', 'Pritchett', 'one.I', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'one', 'wonder', 'Davis', ""n't"", 'actually', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'pretty', 'role', 'Muriel', 'book', 'across', 'much', 'less', 'striking', 'figure', 'Davis', 'clothes', 'attitude', 'still', 'great', 'Madonna', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'gone', 'distance', 'establishing', '1980s', 'thrift', 'shop', 'chic', 'Davis', 'might', 'have', 'singlehandedly', 'pulled', 'off', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'however', 'Muriel', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'just', 'only', 'major', 'departure', 'Anne', 'Tyler', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'novel', 'ever', 'were', 'text', 'book', 'case', 'how', 'script', 'might', 'remain', 'true', 'spirit', 'source', 'novel', 'may', 'be', 'focus', 'rightly', 'William', 'Hurt', 'eccentric', 'tormented', 'character', 'unwilling', 'travel', 'writer', 'Macon', 'Leary', 'two', 'women', 'life', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Turner', 'aforementioned', 'equally', 'eccentric', 'Muriel', 'secondary', 'characters', 'including', 'Macon', 'three', 'eccentric', 'siblings', 'protective', 'just', 'offbeat', 'publisher-cum-future-brother-in-law', 'Muriel', 'chronically', 'ailing', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'are', 'just', 'lovingly', 'drawn', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'win', 'hearts.I', 'could', 'only', 'recall', 'one', 'book', 'subplots', 'got', 'anything', 'short', 'shrift', 'film', 'Muriel', 'friendship', 'young', 'neighborhood', 'mechanic', 'who', 'shares', 'use', 'car', 'book', 'initially', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'relationship', 'precictably', 'awry', 'relationship', 'mention', 'film', 'then', 'summarily', 'dropped', 'kind', 'cut', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'understand', 'readers', 'book', 'might', 'well', 'wonder', 'wisdom', 'bringing', 'up', 'quibbling', 'know', 'Viewers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Tyler', 'book', 'would', 'scarcely', 'notice', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'wonder', 'allusion', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'well-developed', 'subplot', 'original', 'source', 'novel.Screenwriter-director', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'certainly', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'years', 'ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'other', 'films', 'written', 'directed', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'GRAND', 'CANYON', 'MUMFORD', 'was', 'decidedly', 'one', 'Ups']",N/A

I was much taken with the film then. It does not hold up well on a second viewing now almost 20 years later. Based on the great novel of the same name by Anne Tyler, the film is all about Macon Leary, (William Hurt) a writer of books giving advice to traveling businessmen, who is married to Kathleen Turner. When the movie opens, they are mourning the death of their young son and Turner tells Hurt that she is leaving him and proceeds to do so. Left to his own devices-- with a little help from his dog Edward-- he meets and has a relationship with Geena Davis, a whacky, just-off-center character in love with clothes too funky for Dolly Parton. Hurt, an actor whose work I usually admire greatly-- he was superb in THE KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN, for instance-- as the befuddled Macon hardly convinced me that two women would be vying for his affections. This type of character is a lot easier to pull off in a novel than in film. Kathleen Turner is miscast. She is too much like the character she played in BODY HEAT, another film with Hurt and the same director Lawrence Kasdan. The real winners in the film are Geena Davis, who is perfect as this zany character-- she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role-- and the film would be worth seeing just to watch her performance, and Leary's dog Edward-- and Leary's family consisting of two brothers and a sister who all still live together as adults and raise dysfunctionality to an art form.There is commentary with the DVD by the director, Davis and Turner in great detail about what the film is all about with nary a word from Mr. Hurt, whatever that means.

I don't really care for William Hurt but he fits this part perfectly. His is a one note character - any deviation would be too painful for him. The pain of losing his son is so intense that he doesn't seem to even let himself feel it.  What Hurt does with just a few small changes in his expression is amazing. I guess I've never noticed this before but I guess it is evidence of extreme acting talent that he can do so much with just his facial expressions and how subtle those are. I found this movie extremely moving.  The supporting cast is excellent and their stories are as interesting as that of Macon. His blundered into relationship with someone completely different from himself is fascinating. The pathetic child of this woman is so beautifully played that you just want to grab him and hug him yourself. It's true that the movie moves slowly but it is a deliberate pace that continues on to what can be called a happy ending.  Some might just say ""this is one strange dude"" and never take him to your heart but I just loved this story. A Side Note:  I wish the people who write the information paragraph about movies on Amazon had actually seen the movie.  Macon doesn't buy a dog. It was his son's dog. Puleeeeeez. This is not the first bad mistake I've seen in these ""blurbs"" and I'm sure it won't be the last. Note: This rather old VHS movie has been transferred to DVD very well.

Pay him no mind. In film and theatre critique one draws more readers with vinegar than honey.  But enough on that.  Even though Accidental Tourist has no car crashes and no blood and no grimacing Rambo screaming as he wins the VietNam War singlehandedly, it is not merely a chick flick.  It has pathos, it has rich characters, vividly drawn; it has sad drama and many tender laughs (Gena Davis singing, ""I'm Gonna Bop Bop Santa Claus"" for example).  Macon Leary is a subdued, somewhat anal-retentive travel guide writer whose son was murdered in a fast food restaurant robbery.  The tragedy destroyed his wife and ultimately his marriage.  Now he must learn to travel through a world not of his own making -  an Accidental Tourist.  When we meet his quirky family we see he is not the dimmest candle on the cake by any means.

249670,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6301321332,L.A. Scene,"[3, 3]","When one looks back at the 1980s, one of the great actors has to be considered William Hurt.  Back in 1986, he won an Oscar award for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" and also garnered several other Oscar award nominations.  1988 seemed to be Hurt's banner year as he was also nominated for an Oscar for 1987's ""Broadcast News"".  The following year, Hurt also was in another movie that year entitled ""The Accidental Tourist"".  This is a different spin of a male mid-life crisis.  His co-star Geena Davis seemed to get most of the accolades, but I think it is Hurt's performance in this film that was the strongest - and perhaps as strong as any role he had taken on to date.William Hurt plays Macon Leary.  Leary is a travel guide writer.  The film opens with Macon and his wife Sarah (played by Kathleen Turner who also starred with Hurt in ""Body Heat"")  separating after many years of marriage.  Their marriage had broken apart because their 12 year old son had been murdered in a shooting.  Following the shooting, Macon had become even more introverted than he usually was - and this is evidenced by his eccentric brothers Porter (played by David Ogden Stiers) and Charles (played by Ed Begely Jr.) as well as his eccentric sister Rose (played by Amy Wright).  Sarah moves out and leaves Macon to care for their dog Edward, who is having obedience problems.  This is where Macon meets dog-trainer Muriel Pritchett (played by Geena Davis).  Muriel is a very forthcoming and outgoing woman who takes a liking to the introverted Macon.  Macon is at first very resistant to Muriel, but eventually gets involved with her and takes a liking to her son Alexander.  Macon eventually moves in with Muriel and she begins to draw him out of his shell.  Muriel eventually starts to push Macon for a commitment and Macon begins to withdraw.  Macon and Sarah eventually see each other and Sarah tells him he wants to reconcile putting Macon at a point where he must choose.There is a very interesting subplot with this movie too.  Macon's siblings have a role in the movie too.  It seems as though Rose is playing homemaker to the Leary brothers - particularly Porter and Charles.  Macon's publisher Julian (played by Bill Pullman)  eventually takes a liking to Rose and asks her to marry him.  This causes an interesting spin because despite the fact that Rose loves Julian, she still feels the need to take care of her brothers.  I really think this was a good subplot and wouldn't have minded this being a more integral part of the movie.One thing that I thought was a big positive were the settings for the movie.  The first 3/4 of the movie was set in the Baltimore, Maryland area while the last part wraps up in Paris, France.  This movie shows what a great setting the Baltimore area was.  While Macon grew up in suburban Baltimore, Muriel lives in the inner city.  The settings seem to work perfectly in contrasting the differences between Macon and Muriel.  The way the movie winds up - despite Baltimore being a great setting for the majority of the film, Paris proves to be the better place for the endingThe film does other things to contrast Macon and Muriel.  Most notably is the way they dress - Macon is a stodgy. conservative dresser.  Meanwhile Muriel is a miniskirt-wearing, trendy dresser.  We also see that Muriel wants marriage while Macon is sour on the idea.  Yet despite the differences, we see that this couple works well together.The casting was done very well.  I couldn't think of two better people to play the eccentric brothers of Macon Leary than David Ogden Stiers (remember him as Major Winchester from M*A*S*H*?) and Ed Begely Jr.  It almost as if these roles were tailor-made for both of these men.  Perhaps the most unsung actor in the film though is Bill Pullman.  I really enjoyed his role as Macon's publisher Julian.  The scene where Edward the dog has Julian up in a tree is a classic.  I really wished they gave Julian more screen time.  Speaking of Edward the dog - Edward was a real scene stealer.  It was disappointing when Edward's role diminishes in the second half of the movie.As for the performance of Geena Davis - I just didn't get it.  I heard so much about this performance for so long.  Yet when I saw it - it fell way short of my expectations.  Yes she dressed trendy and had this bubbly personality.  My reaction - so what?  When I looked at Hurt's performance along with Pullman, Ogden Stiers, and Begely Jr, I felt Davis' performance wasn't as strong as the others.But ultimately it is Hurt who is going to keep this movie moving along.  It's kind of funny that Hurt was under 40 years old when he played Macon - he seemed so much older in the movie.  Hurt does a great job at blending comedy and drama throughout the movie.  One of the most comedic moments of the film occurs when Macon breaks his leg in his basement (with a little help from Edward the dog).  Yet, we see a completely serious side to Macon when he shows up at Muriel's door and explains how going out to dinner reminded him of his late son.I was entertained by the movie, but ultimately I found the ending too predictable - yet satisfying.  Because of the many likeable characters throughout the film, I wouldn't have minded a sequel to the film.  In fact,the only character I didn't find likeable was Kathleen Turner's role as Sarah.  Overall, this is a film that will entertain you from start to finish - highly recommended.",4,A Film that entertains - ultimately Hurt's performance shines,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,5439,"['When',

I must say that the 80's were good to William Hurt who appeared in many Oscar-nominated films (Broadcast News, Accidental Tourist, Children of a Lesser God, Kiss of the Spider Woman, etc).  This quiet film suddenly got the attention of the Academy, and it deserved the attention.  The supporting cast is wonderful especially the Leary's household (brothers and sister).  Kathleen Turner's small role deserves credit, but it's Geena Davis who really brought out the true emotions of Muriel Prichett.  William Hurt's performance is subdued but that's easier said than done.  I think it's an art when you don't have to act out every single line from a script.  Sometimes, I think that Hurt's actions speak louder than words.In the DVD extras, you will find this DVD has everything from a plethora of deleted scenes, trailer, and commentary from Geena Davis.  The most entertaining of the extras is Geena Davis' commentary.  She reveals about how she landed this role and how she prepared for her character.  When you listen to her experience about the Oscar nomination announcement and then winning the Oscar, you realize that this is what a true commentary should be.  Often times, you get a bunch of actors with directors who goof around and joke about certain scenes and break off into different conversations unrelated to the movie.

There are no audio choices to make...what you hear is all you get.However, they've done a superlative job on the picture AND the audio. The audio seems to be coming from the front/middle speakers (is that a mono mix?)while Macon Leary's narratives as &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; predominantly comes out of my right speaker (I have a 5-speaker surround setup). The music comes out of the left and right speakers and is spacious. All audio seems to be in perfect balance requiring no adjustments from this viewer.This is a rich, rewarding movie and its music score by John Williams is a superb example of monothematic scoring (a basic theme that is cast in variations throughout the film).There are many deleted scenes which really seem to come from a different movie. They would have added at least 30-plus minutes to the film. Characters are introduced, one of whom is referred to in the film (Dominick) and one of whom is mentioned in passing (Alicia, mother of the Learys). Kathleen Turner lost some really good scenes, I think. The deleted scenes give her a softer tone than what we see in the film.On a scale of one to five, I give this DVD a five.

Starts off well enough, but you soon realize that the story is not really going places. Instead of having music in the background all the time as in most films, Lawrence Kasdan thought it wise to let the silence speak and describe the life of the characters.The performances and the dialog however are what make it worth a watch. Bill Hurt is his normal bumbling self (which makes one wonder why the jovial character of Geena Davis pursues him so aggressively) and Kate Turner is the same drug she always has been.  Despite an occasional stunning line or two, the theme seemed too drawn out and contrived to me.I especially did not like the denouement, where the man has to make a choice between two possibly equally unattractive options (unattractive for different reasons -- one a pestulent wife and the other a nagging girlfriend) but I guess it does bring out the ordinary in us. At the end of the day, we pick whatever makes us happy.A word about the name of the film. The thinly disguised metaphor that Bill Hurt's character is a tourist in his own journey through life, becomes instead a bad practical joke.

249684,APDPA11IZPYLN,6301321332,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[42, 45]","""The Accidental Tourist"" Hmmm... even the title of the film has many meanings.  Unhappily married couple, Macon Leary,(William Hurt)a travel guide author and Sarah Leary (Kathleen Turner) have just lost their young son Ethan to an accident. Each of them goes through the grief process alone and thus, the marriage is quite dead. They separate, with Sarah leaving Macon in the big, old empty Victorian house alone, save for Ethan's badly behaved dog, a Welsh corgie named Edward. When Edward misbehaves, Macon just can't get rid of the dog because it reminds him of the good times that Ethan had with Edward.  So, Macon takes the dog to obedience school and meets a very ecentric young woman named Muriel Pritchett.  Muriel is a young divorcee with a very sickly little boy, named Alexander (Robert Hy Gorman in a very nice portrayal for a little guy).  Muriel pursues Macon, a sexual relationship ensues and Macon opens up for the first time about his sorrow for Ethan.  There comes a time when macon has to decide what he wants as Sarah returns to the homeplace and wants to try again.Amy Wright, David Ogden Stiers, and Ed Begley Jr. all turn in WONDERFUL performances as Macon's odd siblings who live together in the family home that they grew up in.  Bill Pullman also turns in a great performance as Julian, Macon's publisher.This is a wonderful character study of families, their hurt, disappointment and finally, reconciliation.  The film is strongly written and well acted.  If you are looking for a funny romance like, ""When Harry Met Sally"", a spooky romance like ""Ghost"" or a treacly, sappy sweet romance like ""Sabrina"", then you are looking in the wrong place.  If you like to see characters that pluck at your heart strings and seem ""oh so real"" then this is a movie for YOU!
