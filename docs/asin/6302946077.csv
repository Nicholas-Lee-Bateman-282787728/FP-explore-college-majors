It doesn't follow the book especially closely but is still a very watchable period romance movie.  Christopher Reeve plays the leading man convincingly and Deborah Raffin is exceptional as the leading lady.  There are also some very fine supporting actors.A couple of items I do want to bring up.  There is no closed captioning available on this DVD.  Some of the actors speak with a southern accent and some of the dialogue is indistinct.  I am partially deaf so this was a definite drawback to the movie for me.Also, the movie shows an NR rating.  There is some fairly graphic nudity and sexual situations in the movie so I would not consider this to be a ""family"" movie.  I do feel the scenes fit in with the storyline and weren't gratuitous but just wanted to forewarn.I enjoyed the movie and it brought back some good memories of reading Spencer's books.

346891,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,6302946077,.fgd,"[0, 0]",Up to three stars because Christopher Reeve put in a fine performance as the strong and silent type. I have always seen him type-cast as a comic book Batman which wasted his talent. His co-star was good too.It was somewhat fascinating to see an update of the wholesome down-on- the- range cowboy genre idealised in the 1950-60s re-done in a comparatively racey way and quite forward about men delivering babies and how she shamelessly put him on the spot.......before he'd even had sex with her! !!.There is a dissapointing lack of plot after a promising start which bombs the movie. The chance of a did-he-didn't-he was not explored with any intrigue when the opportunity was there and also to play with more double-edges than the clean-shaven husband. In this way the film reverted to the overt wholesomeness of the genre and was in fact no modern re-vamp done in 1994.Not being American I had trouble following the yella-yella Southern accent. Lulu the hussy was indeciferable when heated and I had to keep back tracking in order to follow either of the couple's long speeches.There is a comment hidden amongst the reviews here that there must be an unedited version of this film knocking around that has full frontal nudity and is more dirty than Lulu straddling the sheriff legs.Unfortunately it looks like only an older generation of viewers or Fundamentalists are coming across it. !!!!The sex scene between Reeve and his co-star is in no way graphic; no humping; no breasts and the two melding with the purest intentions. However for a 5 seconds I did do a double-take on what appeared to be  hairy bum cheeks in the edited version. When I re-ran it I saw her hand creep slowly over the horizon of his hairy shoulder and run into the dip between his shoulder-blades or IS that the cheeks of his ass ? This confusing camera- work must be what throws a grenade into the love scene for more prudish viewers who were not doing a double-take whilst I did not believe my eyes.,3,"poor plot ( and a solution to the "" is it graphic? controversy )",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1978,"['Up', 'three', 'stars', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'put', 'fine', 'performance', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'type-cast', 'comic', 'book', 'Batman', 'wasted', 'talent', 'co-star', 'was', 'good', 'too.It', 'was', 'somewhat', 'fascinating', 'see', 'update', 'wholesome', 'down-on-', 'the-', 'range', 'cowboy', 'genre', 'idealised', '1950-60s', 're-done', 'comparatively', 'racey', 'way', 'quite', 'forward', 'men', 'delivering', 'babies', 'how', 'shamelessly', 'put', 'spot', '.before', ""'d"", 'even', 'had', 'sex', 'dissapointing', 'lack', 'plot', 'promising', 'start', 'movie', 'chance', ""did-he-didn't-he"", 'was', 'not', 'explored', 'intrigue', 'when', 'opportunity', 'was', 'there', 'also', 'play', 'more', 'double-edges', 'clean-shaven', 'husband', 'way', 'film', 'reverted', 'overt', 'wholesomeness', 'genre', 'was', 'fact', 'modern', 're-vamp', 'done', '1994.Not', 'being', 'American', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'yella-yella', 'Southern', 'accent', 'Lulu', 'hussy', 'was', 'indeciferable', 'when', 'heated', 'had', 'keep', 'back', 'tracking', 'order', 'follow', 'couple', 'long', 'speeches.There', 'comment', 'hidden', 'reviews', 'here', 'must', 'be', 'unedited', 'version', 'film', 'knocking', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'more', 'dirty', 'Lulu', 'straddling', 'sheriff', 'legs.Unfortunately', 'only', 'older', 'generation', 'viewers', 'Fundamentalists', 'are', 'coming', 'sex', 'scene', 'Reeve', 'co-star', 'way', 'graphic', 'humping', 'breasts', 'two', 'melding', 'purest', 'intentions', 'However', '5', 'seconds', 'did', 'do', 'double-take', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'hairy', 'bum', 'cheeks', 'edited', 'version', 'When', 're-ran', 'saw', 'hand', 'creep', 'slowly', 'horizon', 'hairy', 'shoulder', 'run', 'dip', 'shoulder-blades', 'cheeks', 'ass', 'confusing', 'camera-', 'work', 'must', 'be', 'what', 'grenade', 'love', 'scene', 'more', 'prudish', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'doing', 'double-take', 'whilst', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'eyes']",N/A

Bazzett ""BookHappy""","[8, 9]","Both my wife and I had read LaVyrle Spencer's novel, Morning Glory, many years ago, so were pleasantly surprised to see a film version with Christopher Reeve on TV, also quite a few years ago. Since it never seems to show up on TV anymore, we finally bought a copy on DVD and were charmed by the story and the film all over again. My only complaint was that the sound quality of the DVD was rather muffled and distorted, making some of the dialogue difficult to understand. And one other point regarding accuracy: In a seduction scene which featured some momentary nudity (which apparently disturbed some viewers - not me), a Hank Williams record of 'Your Cheatin' Heart' was playing. The storyline, however, was set before and during WWII. That song wasn't written or recorded until the early fifties. Not a big deal, but detracted a bit from the authenticity of the period setting. We still think it quite a beautiful little film. We loved the late Christopher Reeve in it, and now wonder what ever happened to his costar, Deborah Raffin, who was also perfect in this story. - Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, PINHEAD: A LOVE STORY",4,"Little-known Reeve film, well done adaptation of romance novel",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1135,"['wife', 'had', 'read', 'LaVyrle', 'Spencer', 'novel', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'version', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'TV', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'show', 'up', 'TV', 'anymore', 'finally', 'bought', 'copy', 'DVD', 'were', 'charmed', 'story', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'rather', 'muffled', 'distorted', 'making', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'understand', 'one', 'other', 'point', 'regarding', 'accuracy', 'seduction', 'scene', 'featured', 'momentary', 'nudity', 'apparently', 'disturbed', 'viewers', 'not', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'record', ""'Your"", 'Cheatin', 'Heart', 'was', 'playing', 'storyline', 'however', 'was', 'set', 'before', 'WWII', 'song', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'recorded', 'early', 'fifties', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'detracted', 'bit', 'authenticity', 'period', 'setting', 'still', 'think', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'little', 'film', 'loved', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'now', 'wonder', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'costar', 'Deborah', 'Raffin', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'story', 'Tim', 'Bazzett', 'author', 'memoir', 'PINHEAD', 'LOVE', 'STORY']",N/A
