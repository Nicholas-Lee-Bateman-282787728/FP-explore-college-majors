The best thing is the ending, which is one of the coolest, twistiest I've seen in any thriller. The final 15 minutes are priceless and intense. The problem lies in actually getting there, as the 103 minute run time of the film tends to drraggg. This is magnified by the fact that the entire movie takes place in one tiny motel room! Now, this adds to the tension and claustrophobic feel, but it just seems to go on forever, at times going back and forth over the same conversations. If they could have sliced off about 15 minutes of dross, this would have been a classic. As it stands, while still quite watchable, it has many tedious moments that take away from the suspensefulness of the whole...",3,A Long Time To Spend In One Room!...,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,736,"['SYMPATHY', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'best', 'thing', 'ending', 'one', 'coolest', 'twistiest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thriller', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'priceless', 'intense', 'problem', 'actually', 'getting', 'there', '103', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'film', 'drraggg', 'magnified', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'one', 'tiny', 'motel', 'room', 'Now', 'tension', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'just', 'go', 'forever', 'times', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'same', 'conversations', 'could', 'have', 'sliced', 'off', '15', 'minutes', 'dross', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'still', 'quite', 'watchable', 'many', 'tedious', 'moments', 'take', 'away', 'suspensefulness', 'whole']",Sympathy

While this movie dragged at times, it does pick up towards the end and you really don;t see what is coming, and there is very little if any forshadowing of the outcome.  It's a thriller, to be sure.  I noticed quite a few amaturish camera cuts.  In fact, it became sort of like a game to find the ""bloopers"".  But that did not distract from the interest in the outcome of the plotline.  Check it out.  I promis you will like it.",5,Very Interesting,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,434,"['Wow', 'movie', 'dragged', 'times', 'pick', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'really', 'don', 't', 'see', 'what', 'coming', 'very', 'little', 'forshadowing', 'outcome', 'thriller', 'be', 'sure', 'noticed', 'quite', 'few', 'amaturish', 'camera', 'cuts', 'fact', 'became', 'sort', 'game', 'find', 'bloopers', 'did', 'not', 'distract', 'interest', 'outcome', 'plotline', 'Check', 'out', 'promis', 'will', 'like']",Sympathy
1329967,A120GIT50UISJP,B0037UJ5W4,"Channel KDK12 ""Channel KDK12 - Serious Horror""","[4, 5]","Trip is an inexperienced bank robber with a hostage and a plan to drive to Canada. Spending the night in a roadside motel, he has his captive, Sarah, chained to the bed, her feet tied, and duct tape across her mouth. Unfortunately for him, Sarah is the one of the feistiest, most fearless hostages you'll ever meet. And there's a third player waiting in the wings. All of which is going to make for a very bad night for Trip.Sympathy takes place entirely in one room, with a very small cast. The actors are pushed to their limits, emotions and power shifting and twisting from moment to moment as they play cat and mouse games all night long. The cast is well up to the challenge, creating believable, complex characters with a minimum of props and other actors to play off of. As the night progresses, we develop a certain twisted attachment to liars, thieves, and murderers.The plot has many twists, so many that we genuinely don't know who will survive, or how. If you can overlook some initial hard-to-swallow events that set up the rest of the story, Sympathy will keep you engaged and thinking until the very end. This debut picture by Andrew Moorman promises very good things to come.",4,An excellent directorial debut by Andrew Moorman,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1191,"['Trip', 'inexperienced', 'bank', 'robber', 'hostage', 'plan', 'drive', 'Canada', 'Spending', 'night', 'roadside', 'motel', 'captive', 'Sarah', 'chained', 'bed', 'feet', 'tied', 'duct', 'tape', 'mouth', 'Unfortunately', 'Sarah', 'one', 'feistiest', 'most', 'fearless', 'hostages', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'meet', 'third', 'player', 'waiting', 'wings', 'going', 'make', 'very', 'bad', 'night', 'Trip.Sympathy', 'place', 'entirely', 'one', 'room', 'very', 'small', 'cast', 'actors', 'are', 'pushed', 'limits', 'emotions', 'power', 'shifting', 'twisting', 'moment', 'moment', 'play', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'night', 'long', 'cast', 'well', 'up', 'challenge', 'creating', 'believable', 'complex', 'characters', 'minimum', 'props', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'night', 'develop', 'certain', 'twisted', 'attachment', 'liars', 'thieves', 'murderers.The', 'plot', 'many', 'twists', 'so', 'many', 'genuinely', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'how', 'can', 'overlook', 'initial', 'hard-to-swallow', 'events', 'set', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'Sympathy', 'will', 'keep', 'engaged', 'thinking', 'very', 'end', 'debut', 'picture', 'Andrew', 'Moorman', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'come']",Sympathy
