There is no real plot other than some US troops and Italian partisans and some German troops shooting it out.It is another one of those war movies where based on how much shooting was going on they would have run out of ammo about 5 minutes into the movie.The plot line is that a captain that knows too much is sent out on a mission and gets captured so another group of soldiers is sent after him to see if he has told the Nazis what he knows.Just silly stuff.I give movies I quit on one star.

I must admit that I ceased viewing this movie after about 15 minutes, although I fast-forwarded to the end.Just an awful, cheap,inaccurate attempt at moviemaking. In the first scene, we see a small group of U.S. soldiers, and a ""Sicilian"" guide on the beach, led by a captain in the 101st Airborne, who did not see action until Normandy in June, 1944, yet this is supposedly Sicily in July, 1943!Also, the captain was overweight, and appeared to be about 55-60 years old! Some paratrooper!When this old soldier was captured by the Germans, the inevitable heinous, black -uniformed SS officer shows up, to interrogate/torture him.

It's a little hard to say what exactly Hollywood has to do to make a quality movie, but whatever it is, this one didn't have it.  It being unrealistic was just one part of the badness.  In one scene, for example, the guys land on the beach--and they're supposed to be the best of the best--and you can see somebody else running up along the beach on the side, but none of them see him...until I guess they got to the cue spot in the sand...""Hey!  Who goes there!""  Parts like that are almost funny.

1538273,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B007UW9WAK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 4]","This is a low budget film about a special group of men selected to go on a rescue operation in Sicily. They are to rescue Captain Lyle Lewis (Dennis LaValle) from the Nazis and be aware there may be a spy. Lt. Wright gets to hand pick a crew of five men to accompany him to Sicily. The film doesn't take the time to build a bunch of colorful memorable characters, but rather concentrates on just two of the men. One was Sgt. Douglas Dickey (Clint Glenn Hummel) from Mississippi. His accent sounded like he was impersonating Will Farrell doing a fake accent. The other character we got to know was Lt. Wright (Scott Martin) who had to leave his wife,a private (Bea Zee Brazen) behind.Lt. ""I'm a Lt. I out rank you.""Wife: ""I'm your wife. No you don't.""She gave us perhaps the best acting performance in the film, although it only lasted two minutes.I thought the initial fight scene was realistic the way the bullets pinged off of rocks. Then later in the film they opt to use fake looking CG flames coming out of the rifles. The bolt action rifle was shot as a semi automatic- nice touch. The script, while simple and predictable, needed to be more clever. The shallow attempts at humor didn't make it.WARNING: This film is also marketed under the title ""Battle Recon: The Call to Duty.""

A special forces squad is sent to pre-allied invasion Sicily to retrieve A US Army captain who was captured during a recon mission.  This is a noisy boring movie where everything becomes predictable and runs way too long.  There is an element of treachery thrown into the mix.  All in all this flick is like opening a bag of toy army men and having the good guys slaughter hordes of Germans, that keep on coming.  A couple of Italian actresses(playing freedom fighters) are added for spice, but other than their bravery and a sexual inuendo their presence adds little.  You have your stereo typical SS officer, that knows something is up, and turns out to be a buffoon.  There's a kind of comical gun-ho southern guy,(terrible accent)who's skilled with a knife that's mildly amusing!  German soldier reenactors have a field day but if it weren't for all the noise, you would have surely fallen asleep.  Don't rent and don't buy!
