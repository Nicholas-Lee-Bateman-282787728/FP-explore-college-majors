1594378,A5ACXANZVOA9K,B009AYNOYQ,Art,"[0, 0]","Army Wives is by far, the best series my wife and I have followed. I think I would say that even if I wasn't a former serviceman. The setting is real, the characters are true to life and the drama gripping. Any one who is intrigued by the stories of people amid the challenges of life, service or civilian, and who values friendship, community, loyalty and trust in sometimes very chaotic and painful  circumstances will love these stories.",5,Army Wives...A Fantastic Series,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,440,"['Army', 'Wives', 'far', 'best', 'series', 'wife', 'have', 'followed', 'think', 'would', 'say', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'former', 'serviceman', 'setting', 'real', 'characters', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'drama', 'gripping', 'one', 'who', 'intrigued', 'stories', 'people', 'challenges', 'life', 'service', 'civilian', 'who', 'friendship', 'community', 'loyalty', 'trust', 'sometimes', 'very', 'chaotic', 'painful', 'circumstances', 'will', 'love', 'stories']",Army Wives: Season 6 - Part Two

However, this is one of the best military-life stories EVER. At first, the only flaw I could see was that the wives of enlisted personnel were such close friends with the wives of officers - which as anyone who ever served knows, that's not the way life is in the military.  But the more I watched, I realized that this is the way it SHOULD be.  The series was cast perfectly, and I was impressed that the problems the characters faced were so similar to those of actual military families.  My granddaughter introduced me to this series when her husband was in Iraq.  She and another Marine wife both watched while their husbands were deployed, and they repeatedly told me to buy this entire series.  I'm so glad I listened.",5,What a great series,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,833,"['gave', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'was', 'unhappy', 'season', 'being', 'sold', 'two', 'parts', 'just', 'wrong', 'However', 'one', 'best', 'military-life', 'stories', 'EVER', 'first', 'only', 'flaw', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'wives', 'enlisted', 'personnel', 'were', 'such', 'close', 'friends', 'wives', 'officers', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'served', 'knows', 'not', 'way', 'life', 'military', 'more', 'watched', 'realized', 'way', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'series', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'was', 'impressed', 'problems', 'characters', 'faced', 'were', 'so', 'similar', 'actual', 'military', 'families', 'granddaughter', 'introduced', 'series', 'when', 'husband', 'was', 'Iraq', 'Marine', 'wife', 'watched', 'husbands', 'were', 'deployed', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'buy', 'entire', 'series', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'listened']",Army Wives: Season 6 - Part Two
