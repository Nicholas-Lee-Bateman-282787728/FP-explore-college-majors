Finally after a 25 years wait and hundreds of requests from fans, it's available on DVD in 2013!China Beach was one of my most favorite shows back in the day. It has been so long that I didn't realize that Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, was the same actress as the very Hot Redhead, Karen Charlene &#34;K.C.&#34; Koloski, a heroin-addicted prostitute and later black-marketeer that I had a crush on as a teen. Also didn't realize that Dana Delany who played Katherine Mayfair on the Desperate Housewives and played Megan Hunt on the ABC drama series Body of Proof was the same actress as China Beach's Nurse Colleen McMurphy. They both looked different with red hair in China Beach (Nowadays Blond). Also surprised to see Robert Picardo,  the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), &#34;The Doctor&#34;, on Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and some Star Trek movies and played Richard Woolsey in the Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe was the same actor as Dr. Dick Richards on China Beach (who had hair back than).Only 2 complaints, as someone mentioned earlier, is the Price, $59.95 for Season 1 & 2, which is totally not worth it for only 23 episodes with No Sub-Titles nor Closed-Captions which my wife needs (she's not deaf) just unable to comprehend actors talking in an accent whether it's a Texas, Southern, Mid-Western, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Boston, Scottish, Cockney, Irish, Aussie, Hispanic, Hip-Hop/Ghetto Talk, Cajun nor French-Canadian. She really needs English Subs (so do I sometimes) which especially should be available since we're paying up the yin-yang on these DVD sets. Seems like the more expensive the DVD and BD Sets are missing Subs and CC whereas the cheap TV DVD sets have Subs and/or CC..",4,Finally after a 25 years Wait!,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,1889,"['China', 'Beach', 'was', 'Critically', 'acclaimed', 'series', 'ran', 'April', '1988', 'July', '1991', 'Finally', '25', 'years', 'wait', 'hundreds', 'requests', 'fans', 'available', 'DVD', '2013', 'China', 'Beach', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'shows', 'back', 'day', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'who', 'Catherine', 'Willows', 'CSI', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Investigation', 'was', 'same', 'actress', 'very', 'Hot', 'Redhead', 'Karen', 'Charlene', '34', 'K.C.', '34', 'Koloski', 'heroin-addicted', 'prostitute', 'later', 'black-marketeer', 'had', 'crush', 'teen', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'who', 'played', 'Katherine', 'Mayfair', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'played', 'Megan', 'Hunt', 'ABC', 'drama', 'series', 'Body', 'Proof', 'was', 'same', 'actress', 'China', 'Beach', 'Nurse', 'Colleen', 'McMurphy', 'looked', 'different', 'red', 'hair', 'China', 'Beach', 'Nowadays', 'Blond', 'Also', 'surprised', 'see', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Emergency', 'Medical', 'Hologram', 'EMH', '34', 'Doctor', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'played', 'Richard', 'Woolsey', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'Stargate', 'Universe', 'was', 'same', 'actor', 'Dr.', 'Dick', 'Richards', 'China', 'Beach', 'who', 'had', 'hair', 'back', '.Only', '2', 'complaints', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Price', '59.95', 'Season', '1', '2', 'totally', 'not', 'only', '23', 'episodes', 'Sub-Titles', 'Closed-Captions', 'wife', 'needs', 'not', 'deaf', 'just', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'actors', 'talking', 'accent', 'Texas', 'Southern', 'Mid-Western', 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Boston', 'Scottish', 'Cockney', 'Irish', 'Aussie', 'Hispanic', 'Hip-Hop/Ghetto', 'Talk', 'Cajun', 'French-Canadian', 'really', 'English', 'Subs', 'so', 'do', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'should', 'be', 'available', ""'re"", 'paying', 'up', 'yin-yang', 'DVD', 'sets', 'more', 'expensive', 'DVD', 'BD', 'Sets', 'are', 'missing', 'Subs', 'CC', 'whereas', 'cheap', 'TV', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'Subs', 'and/or', 'CC..']",China Beach Seasons 1 and 2 DVD Plus Bonus Features

1671998,A2POT13FER5L82,B00FLD7QBM,it,"[0, 0]",This series is mostly about hospitals in Vietnam and what happened in them. There is a much more concentrated occurrence of colorful people and situations than what happened to most veterans like myself. There is also some lack of realism. For instance some soldiers out in the bush start a camp fire at night. This is never done as it announces your location and an attack frequently follows.,4,very depressing,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,393,"['series', 'mostly', 'hospitals', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'happened', 'much', 'more', 'concentrated', 'occurrence', 'colorful', 'people', 'situations', 'what', 'happened', 'most', 'veterans', 'also', 'lack', 'realism', 'instance', 'soldiers', 'out', 'bush', 'start', 'camp', 'fire', 'night', 'never', 'done', 'location', 'attack', 'frequently']",China Beach Seasons 1 and 2 DVD Plus Bonus Features
1671999,A2ZVD2FQSTZ7VQ,B00FLD7QBM,langleybcguy,"[1, 1]","I remember being a teenager when this series came out, and having seen Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic 'Apocalypse Now' and Oliver Stone's 'Platoon', I immediately became interested in this series which offered a different perspective of the Vietnam War - as it was seen through the eyes of medical staff & the women who served in that war.This release does not disappoint. 'China Beach' is a U.S. Army evac hospital (the 510th?) in South Vietnam. Being right on the ocean shore it also had a great wealth of recreation & fun for the people who worked there. The cast was entirely believable; mostly the show followed the struggles/adventures of U.S. Army 1st Lt. Colleen McMurphy (Dana Delany), a nurse who is frequently dealing with seriously wounded soldiers & who takes that role very seriously. Also the show followed commanding officer Maj. Lila Garreau (Concetta Tomei), a headstrong patriot, Captain (and Dr.) Dick Richard (Robert Picardo), Pvt. Samuel Beckett (Michael Boatman), who worked in graves detail, and K.C. (CSI's Marg Helgenberger, before her role as Catherine Willows), a prostitute who lived on site.The pilot is one of my favorite episodes; we were introduced to the characters slowly as well as their roles. A few guest stars who appeared in the first few episodes gave touching appearances, especially Chloe Webb as USO singer Laurette Barber who discovers that she has touched a dying soldier's life when she gave a show to his unit a few days before. Nan Woods appeared in a few episodes as Red Cross member Cherry, who finds herself caught in a bunker with soldiers during the Tet Offensive. Look for Gail O'Grady (Donna in 'NYPD Blue') as one of Laurette's co-stars in the USO show who gets a bad case of stage fright!The show as a whole is very well done and believable; several Vietnam veterans were consulted to give an accurate perspective for the show's writers. I am looking forward to the release of the last 2 seasons.

1672000,A2OA55AAEY0KD1,B00FLD7QBM,"Lloyd Lofthouse "", author of 'My Splendid Con...","[1, 1]","&#8220;China Beach&#8221; was a TV series from 1988 to 1991, and I didn&#8217;t see it until recently after I first heard about it and bought a copy of the series on DVD at Costco.And I think I know why this excellent TV series was cancelled after only four seasons&#8212;most Americans can&#8217;t face the true reality of war and the horrors that come with war. After all, less than 7% of the Americans are veterans and even fewer have served in combat.&#8220;China Beach&#8221; was set in a combat hospital during the Vietnam War in the late 1960s. The main character is first lieutenant Colleen McMurphy who is a triage nurse dealing with often severely wounded troops.  The directors focused on reality and there were real combat nurses who were used as consultants. There&#8217;s a bonus documentary on the DVD at the end of this box set where we get to meet some of these nurses who were actually in Vietnam.The fictional nurse McMurphy takes her job saving lives seriously and when she loses some of those wounded troops, she takes the loss personally and is emotionally injured.If you want a close look at the reality of combat and the price combat troops pay, I highly recommend this series. You will have a safe front row seat to watch these characters become friends, lovers and then suffer loses that would break most people and scar them for life as it must have scarred the real nurses who served there.You may question my opinion of this series so it may help to know that I served in combat in Vietnam in 1966 as a field radio operator in the U.S. Marines. And I was fortunate to never have to be medevaced to a combat hospital although some of the Marines in my unit were.",5,A close look at what war is really like.
