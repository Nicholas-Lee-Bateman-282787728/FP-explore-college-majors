Not just that, but Margaret herself recorded commentaries and an interview on the set, which is something I was surprised to find out considering her recollection of the production of this series in I'm The One That I Want.I cannot wait to see this show, whether it's a great underrated sitcom or a trite mess, I love Margaret Cho and this show is essential viewing for her fans.",4,looking forward to seeing this,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,940,"['became', 'fan', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want', 'Cho', 'fan', 'knows', 'one', 'woman', 'show', 'mostly', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'Margaret', 'had', 'making', 'sitcom', 'ABC', ""mid-1990's.I"", 'remember', 'ABC', 'hyping', 'show', 'putting', 'Margaret', 'out', 'Asian', 'cross', 'Roseanne', 'Seinfeld', 'seemed', 'fade', 'fast', 'never', 'thought', 'anything', 'more', 'became', 'fan', 'live', 'act.Leave', 'good', 'people', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'realize', 'how', 'big', 'devout', 'Margaret', 'cult', 'following', 'really', 'Not', 'just', 'Margaret', 'recorded', 'commentaries', 'interview', 'set', 'something', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'considering', 'recollection', 'production', 'series', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want.I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'show', 'great', 'underrated', 'sitcom', 'trite', 'mess', 'love', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'show', 'essential', 'viewing', 'fans']",All American Girl - The Complete Series
952448,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BXJ1Y2,Dorrie Wheeler,"[8, 10]","Margaret Cho got her start in the late 1980's on the stand-up comedy circuit. In the early 90's she broke ground with her series All-American Girl which is now available on DVD for the first time. All-American Girl was the first prime time series about a Asian-American family. The show debuted in the fall of 1994. Cho starred in the series Margaret Kim. Margaret lives at home with her very colorful family. Margaret, the character, is a fun loving young women who enjoys life. Her mother very much wants Margaret to follow Korean customs and date Korean men. Margaret's brother Stuart (portrayed by B.D. Wong Law & Order, Oz), dates Korean women and is in medical school. Margaret finds support from her grandmother (Amy Hill), father, and younger brother Eric (J.B. Quon.) All-American Girl was a great situation comedy with potential to have a lasting run, but sadly ABC pulled the plug on the series after just one season.All-American Girl was a really funny show. The grandmother stole every scene she was in. The character of the mother was a bit over the top with her strong believes and seemingly bad attitude, but that is the way her character was written. It was a really great ensemble cast and was just as enjoyable as an Everyone Loves Raymond or a Family Matters.To understand All-American Girl you must check out the special feature All-American Girl: A Look Back With Margaret Cho. Margaret went through so much with the network when it came to the production of the show. She is joined in this feature with Amy Hill who starred as the grandmother in the series. This was the first time that Asian-American's were seen on prime television as a family just living their lives and there were conflicts with the casting and the show was not without controversy as some Asian-Americans complained that all of the actors in the show were not Korean. On top of that in the feature Margaret discloses many strife's that occurred with the production and even details how once world politics came into conversation when it came to the series. This feature shines so much light on the series and Amy Hill even gets back into her grandma get up at the end!If you missed All-American Girl during it's original run, do pick it up on DVD. The complete series is available in a four disc box set. It's a really funny show and it's a shame it didn't last longer.",5,A Great Series Arrives on DVD,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,2364,"['Margaret', 'Cho', 'got', 'start', 'late', '1980', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'circuit', 'early', '90', 'broke', 'ground', 'series', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'was', 'first', 'prime', 'time', 'series', 'Asian-American', 'family', 'show', 'debuted', 'fall', '1994', 'Cho', 'starred', 'series', 'Margaret', 'Kim', 'Margaret', 'home', 'very', 'colorful', 'family', 'Margaret', 'character', 'fun', 'loving', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'life', 'mother', 'very', 'much', 'Margaret', 'follow', 'Korean', 'customs', 'date', 'Korean', 'men', 'Margaret', 'brother', 'Stuart', 'portrayed', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'Law', 'Order', 'Oz', 'Korean', 'women', 'medical', 'school', 'Margaret', 'support', 'grandmother', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'father', 'younger', 'brother', 'Eric', 'J.B', 'Quon', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'was', 'great', 'situation', 'comedy', 'potential', 'have', 'lasting', 'run', 'sadly', 'ABC', 'pulled', 'plug', 'series', 'just', 'one', 'season.All-American', 'Girl', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'show', 'grandmother', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'character', 'mother', 'was', 'bit', 'top', 'strong', 'seemingly', 'bad', 'attitude', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'Family', 'Matters.To', 'understand', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'special', 'feature', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'Look', 'Back', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'Margaret', 'went', 'so', 'much', 'network', 'when', 'came', 'production', 'show', 'joined', 'feature', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'who', 'starred', 'grandmother', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Asian-American', 'were', 'seen', 'prime', 'television', 'family', 'just', 'living', 'lives', 'were', 'conflicts', 'casting', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'controversy', 'Asian-Americans', 'complained', 'actors', 'show', 'were', 'not', 'Korean', 'top', 'feature', 'Margaret', 'many', 'strife', 'occurred', 'production', 'even', 'details', 'how', 'once', 'world', 'politics', 'came', 'conversation', 'when', 'came', 'series', 'feature', 'so', 'much', 'light', 'series', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'even', 'back', 'grandma', 'get', 'up', 'end', 'missed', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'original', 'run', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'complete', 'series', 'available', 'four', 'disc', 'box', 'set', 'really', 'funny', 'show', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer']",All American Girl - The Complete Series

When I found out, I bought it sight unseen.Unfortunately, Margaret Cho was not funny at all in this show.  But then again it is difficult to imagine Margaret Cho's brand of comedy in a G rated television show.  But Richard Pryor managed to do it with his show.I gave this DVD set a four star rating because of Grandma.  Grandma does indeed steal the show.  I found myself looking forward to each episode to see what Grandma would do next.  Grandma made me laugh a LOT.  They should have made a series called: ""All American Grandma.""  That would have been a great, long running series.  I would have bought every season on DVD.Except for Grandma, the show was not funny.  It is easy to see why the show failed.  If Grandma were not on the show, the show would have been cancelled much sooner.There are three notable episodes in the series.  One episode consists of Grandma, Mom and Margaret going to the Oprah Winfrey show.  Yes, Oprah is in the episode.  Very good episode.  Another episode, ""Pulp Sitcom"" features Quentin Tarantino in which he pokes a bit of fun at ""Pulp Fiction.""  Good episode.  Another episode, the last episode of the series, is also the worst episode of the series.  It was so bad and inane that it made Three's Company look like Shakespeare.  Margaret finally has her own place with three male roommates.  Those three roommates could not make an intelligent decision if their lives depended on it.

As we know, this was Margaret Cho's first (and, to date, only) sitcom, and ABC tinkered with it to the point that it sent Margaret into a tailspin personally.  They forced her to lose weight (which resulted in kidney failure), and they also hired an ""Asian consultant"", as the audience didn't believe Margaret's character was Asian enough.  After the show was cancelled, Margaret spiralled down into drugs, booze, and anonymous sex (by her own admission).  Her concert film, I'm the One that I Want, details what happened to her in sometimes painful detail.

952455,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B000BXJ1Y2,RetroRhythms,"[2, 2]","This short-lived sitcom was many people's introduction to comedienne Margaret Cho. Though it was supposed to be based on her stand-up act, in reality, it was about as far from her real personality as possible! Added to that, the writing of the show was often banal and inconsistent. In the DVD commentary, Margaret states that the network (ABC) was trying so hard to please different parties (i.e. Asians who thought the show wasn't ""Asian enough,"" and non-Asians who thought it was ""too Asian"") that the show ultimately lost its direction. That explains some of the writing shortcomings.But with all its flaws, ""All-American Girl"" is still fun to watch for several reasons. One, Amy Hill's portrayal of ""Grandma Kim"" is endearing and very funny. In fact, it will remind many of Margaret Cho's impersonations of her real-life mother in her more recent stand-up shows. Second, there is a quirky vibe to the show that results from its odd array of characters. They range from the talented Judy Gold playing an oddball co-worker of Margaret's at the mall department store, to an 11-year-old Ashley Johnson playing an offbeat nextdoor neighbor to the Kim's (the name of Margaret's family on the sitcom), to Jodi Long portraying Margaret's strict and traditional mother, and B.D. Wong acting as her successful, superior older brother. This variety makes for ""a little something for everyone"" that ultimately gives the show the ability to appeal to different ages, races, and people from different socio-economic backgrounds.Lastly, ""All-American Girl"" is intriguing to watch simply because it is sooo different than the Margaret Cho many of us have come to love. Given that a good chunk of her autobiography and first stand-up flick (both titled ""I'm the One That I Want"") focused on the trials and tribulations that doing the sitcom brought her, AAG has taken on a second life in recent years. Now, fans can see what all the fuss was all about, see how much she's changed, and enjoy a bit of nostalgia (yes, the show did, in fact, have a notable teenage following when it originally aired!).",3,"Not All-Margaret, But Still Fun to Watch",1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,2087,"['short-lived', 'sitcom', 'was', 'many', 'people', 'introduction', 'comedienne', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'stand-up', 'act', 'reality', 'was', 'about', 'far', 'real', 'personality', 'possible', 'Added', 'writing', 'show', 'was', 'often', 'banal', 'inconsistent', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Margaret', 'network', 'ABC', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'please', 'different', 'parties', 'i.e', 'Asians', 'who', 'thought', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'Asian', 'enough', 'non-Asians', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'Asian', 'show', 'ultimately', 'lost', 'direction', 'writing', 'shortcomings.But', 'flaws', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'portrayal', 'Grandma', 'Kim', 'endearing', 'very', 'funny', 'fact', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'impersonations', 'real-life', 'mother', 'more', 'recent', 'stand-up', 'shows', 'Second', 'quirky', 'vibe', 'show', 'results', 'odd', 'array', 'characters', 'range', 'talented', 'Judy', 'Gold', 'playing', 'oddball', 'co-worker', 'Margaret', 'mall', 'department', 'store', '11-year-old', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'playing', 'offbeat', 'nextdoor', 'neighbor', 'Kim', 'name', 'Margaret', 'family', 'sitcom', 'Jodi', 'Long', 'portraying', 'Margaret', 'strict', 'traditional', 'mother', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'acting', 'successful', 'superior', 'older', 'brother', 'variety', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'ultimately', 'show', 'ability', 'appeal', 'different', 'ages', 'races', 'people', 'different', 'socio-economic', 'backgrounds.Lastly', 'All-American', 'Girl', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'simply', 'sooo', 'different', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'many', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'Given', 'good', 'chunk', 'autobiography', 'first', 'stand-up', 'flick', 'titled', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want', 'focused', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'doing', 'sitcom', 'brought', 'AAG', 'taken', 'second', 'life', 'recent', 'years', 'Now', 'fans', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'yes', 'show', 'did', 'fact', 'have', 'notable', 'teenage', 'following', 'when', 'originally', 'aired']",All American Girl - The Complete Series
