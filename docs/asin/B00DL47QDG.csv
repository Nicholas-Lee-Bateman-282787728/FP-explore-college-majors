1657734,A2V5AGMDQ7A5XM,B00DL47QDG,adamKS,"[3, 3]","after departing from the minimalist quirky drama side of film with 2008's ""pineapple express"" and the 2 not so great that followed ""your highness"" and ""the sitter', david is appreciatively back in form with ""prince avalanche"". similar to the innocence and cinematography beauty of George Washington and with the buddy humor of the likes of Pineapple Express, prince avalanche should appeal to anyone of DGG's previous work. it's truly a sad thing to see all these premature, negative reviews for a gem of a movie like this. I assume people were looking for obvious, loud humor and a cohesive conventional plot but were disappointed to find a movie with 2 main characters, who we know very little about except that they are different human beings and that they are painting lines on roads that surround a devastated forest and community in texas that was recently destroyed by a fire.  we have no clue what these 2 do back in the city when their not working, we only get a glimpse of who they are but as the film goes on we start to see subtle characteristics and personality rise to the surface and we see these two guys for who they really are or who they strive to be. the movie is an unraveling of emotions and character and possibly a start of an impossible, blooming friendship between 2 polar opposites.anybody who has seen and liked david Gordon greens previous work before pineapple express, will not be surprised or bored with this movie. the man has a unique style of storytelling through film that uses subtle shots of nature and unconventional characters to bring forth organic human expression. and like his first 4 films, prince avalanche is no different. maybe a lot of the negative reviews are people looking for another pineapple express stoner comedy like film or just from seeing the great comedic actor paul rudd on the cover or trailer. this is not another paul rudd comedy, although paul rudd's comedic genius is seen throughout beneath that 80's moustache and clothes in the self-assured but flawed Alvin character, only in a more subtle way. also, emile hersch's character ""lance"" is very likeable and relatable and reminds me a bit like james franco laidback, clueless character in pineapple express. I think paul rudd's acting in this one is deserving of an award or at least an nomination. his reserved comedic presence along with drips of dramatic acting really shine here.this is the kind of movie that is only going to hit a niche spot for movie seekers who ask more out of their movies than just cheap laughs and conventional plots and pacing. this is a special kind of movie for special film viewers and that's ok. why else would david Gordon green make such a minimalistic, spontaneous buddy dramedy in a desolate burnt forest in the middle of texas with only 4 total characters/actors in the entire movie? I think he made this more for himself than anything just to get back to what he enjoys about making movies and to not be restricted by big budget or marketers trying to make his film be something else.as goes the saying, ""we all go back to where we belong"" or ""we all always return to our roots"". .and this is exactly the case with ""prince avalanche"". this is david making movies the way HE likes making movies and it is clear that this is the man's unique ""talent/gift"" on this planet.keep em coming david, i'll keep watching.",5,david gordon green is back in form,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,3367,"['departing', 'minimalist', 'quirky', 'drama', 'side', 'film', '2008', 'pineapple', 'express', '2', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'followed', 'highness', 'sitter', 'david', 'appreciatively', 'back', 'form', 'prince', 'avalanche', 'similar', 'innocence', 'cinematography', 'beauty', 'George', 'Washington', 'buddy', 'humor', 'likes', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'prince', 'avalanche', 'should', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'DGG', 'previous', 'work', 'truly', 'sad', 'thing', 'see', 'premature', 'negative', 'reviews', 'gem', 'movie', 'assume', 'people', 'were', 'looking', 'obvious', 'loud', 'humor', 'cohesive', 'conventional', 'plot', 'were', 'disappointed', 'find', 'movie', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'are', 'different', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'painting', 'lines', 'roads', 'surround', 'devastated', 'forest', 'community', 'texas', 'was', 'recently', 'destroyed', 'fire', 'have', 'clue', 'what', '2', 'do', 'back', 'city', 'when', 'not', 'working', 'only', 'get', 'glimpse', 'who', 'are', 'film', 'start', 'see', 'subtle', 'characteristics', 'personality', 'rise', 'surface', 'see', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'strive', 'be', 'movie', 'unraveling', 'emotions', 'character', 'possibly', 'start', 'impossible', 'blooming', 'friendship', '2', 'polar', 'opposites.anybody', 'who', 'seen', 'liked', 'david', 'Gordon', 'greens', 'previous', 'work', 'pineapple', 'express', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'bored', 'movie', 'man', 'unique', 'style', 'storytelling', 'film', 'subtle', 'shots', 'nature', 'unconventional', 'characters', 'bring', 'forth', 'organic', 'human', 'expression', 'first', '4', 'films', 'prince', 'avalanche', 'different', 'maybe', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'people', 'looking', 'pineapple', 'express', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'film', 'just', 'seeing', 'great', 'comedic', 'actor', 'paul', 'rudd', 'cover', 'trailer', 'not', 'paul', 'rudd', 'comedy', 'paul', 'rudd', 'comedic', 'genius', 'seen', 'beneath', '80', 'moustache', 'clothes', 'self-assured', 'flawed', 'Alvin', 'character', 'only', 'more', 'subtle', 'way', 'also', 'hersch', 'character', 'lance', 'very', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'bit', 'james', 'franco', 'laidback', 'clueless', 'character', 'pineapple', 'express', 'think', 'paul', 'rudd', 'acting', 'one', 'deserving', 'award', 'least', 'nomination', 'reserved', 'comedic', 'presence', 'drips', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'really', 'shine', 'here.this', 'kind', 'movie', 'only', 'going', 'hit', 'niche', 'spot', 'movie', 'seekers', 'who', 'ask', 'more', 'movies', 'just', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'conventional', 'plots', 'pacing', 'special', 'kind', 'movie', 'special', 'film', 'viewers', 'ok.', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'david', 'Gordon', 'green', 'make', 'minimalistic', 'spontaneous', 'buddy', 'dramedy', 'desolate', 'burnt', 'forest', 'middle', 'texas', 'only', '4', 'total', 'characters/actors', 'entire', 'movie', 'think', 'made', 'more', 'anything', 'just', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'making', 'movies', 'not', 'be', 'restricted', 'big', 'budget', 'marketers', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'else.as', 'saying', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'belong', 'always', 'return', 'roots', '.and', 'exactly', 'case', 'prince', 'avalanche', 'david', 'making', 'movies', 'way', 'HE', 'making', 'movies', 'clear', 'man', 'unique', 'talent/gift', 'planet.keep', 'em', 'coming', 'david', 'i', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching']",Prince Avalanche
1657735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DL47QDG,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I&#8217;ve had a crush on Paul Rudd for a few years.  I&#8217;m ok with this.  I&#8217;m comfortable enough in my manhood/marriage to admit that (I&#8217;ve admitted a lot worse, so&#8230;).  I&#8217;ll watch him in anything, but even I am aware that his film choices can be questionable.  He seems to like to regurgitate the same character and the same scenarios a lot, and while he&#8217;s very good at it, I&#8217;ve be anxious for him to stretch himself a bit and do something really great.  On the flipside, I kind of hate Emile Hirsch.  I find his breed of acting to be annoying and false and while he has tried to stretch himself and has chosen some really quality works in the past, I often go out of my way to avoid his films if I can.I was faced with a conundrum here.&#8216;Prince Avalanche&#8217; brings both actors (who couldn&#8217;t be more different) together with director David Gordon Green (who directed the Malick-esque &#8216;George Washington&#8217; and then&#8230;&#8216;Pineapple Express&#8217;?) in a film about isolation, loneliness and self-discovery.  Some will balk that this film doesn&#8217;t go anywhere or doesn&#8217;t say anything or is devoid of real story or plot and yet to those I say &#8220;dig deeper&#8221; and &#8220;look closer&#8221; and you will see, because it is all there.The film takes place in 1988 where a highway road worker named Alvin is spending the summer painting yellow stripes along the highway with his girlfriend&#8217;s younger brother, Lance.  Alvin enjoys the solitude; the camping out in the woods and being away from life in general, for it allows him the opportunity to reflect on his life.  Lance hates it.  He needs people and longs for some intimate interaction with women, but Alvin is fine with the distance, even if it means that he isn&#8217;t around to meet the needs of his girlfriend, who is growing restless with his absence.  When Lance returns from a weekend in town, he brings information that alters Alvin&#8217;s life course, changing the way he looks at himself but also the way he projects his entire life.What is he going to do now?While I&#8217;ll admit that the story itself may seem slight, there is a deeper impact here that I wasn&#8217;t expecting, and sometimes it is in the simplest of plot details that the most direct emotional response can be found.  Alvin&#8217;s life is so micromanaged and his idea of what he wants and what others need is misguided at the very least and obviously built around a cushion to keep him protected and &#8216;in control&#8217;.  Lance breaks that down because he lives in a far less &#8216;arranged&#8217; world, a world that is colored outside of the lines and one that consists of reckless behavior and a striving after the wind.  Lance&#8217;s world is created on inexperience, while Alvin&#8217;s dwells in a world almost too experienced; one of subliminal fear.  They need to strike a balance, an amalgam of their particular views, and when that happens they can find enrichment they never thought possible.But first they need to collide.Rudd and Hirsch are both excellent here.  Hirsch&#8217;s ticks as an actor (the way he creates obnoxiousness has always irritated me) is best suited here where he is given a character who is about as nave as they come.  His expressions betray his faux sense of confidence and help bolster a performance that feels rich with underlying meaning.  Rudd handles Alvin&#8217;s backstory with ease, giving his gruffness a sense of underlying pain that helps underline the progressive nature of his character.  He also handles the humor, dry and awkward, with his undeniable charm.  I really, really NEED Paul Rudd to work with Wes Anderson.  He would fit so brilliantly into that world, and he needs to build a sharper career.  Hopefully this is only the beginning for him, although next year he&#8217;s working with David Wain again so maybe not.Yes, this doesn&#8217;t have a lot going on, but it is also brisk, and when you look at the details (that scene in the destroyed home for one) you can find something that sings with life and has a real sense of character development.",4,"Not what you&#8217;d expect, but that is a good thing&#8230;",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,4147,"['8217', 've', 'had', 'crush', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'few', 'years', '8217', 'ok', '8217', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'manhood/marriage', 'admit', '8217', 've', 'admitted', 'lot', 'worse', '8230', '8217', 'watch', 'anything', 'even', 'am', 'aware', 'film', 'choices', 'can', 'be', 'questionable', 'like', 'regurgitate', 'same', 'character', 'same', 'lot', '8217', 's', 'very', 'good', '8217', 'be', 'anxious', 'stretch', 'bit', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'flipside', 'kind', 'hate', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'find', 'breed', 'acting', 'be', 'annoying', 'false', 'tried', 'stretch', 'chosen', 'really', 'quality', 'works', 'past', 'often', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'films', 'can.I', 'was', 'faced', 'conundrum', 'here.', '8216', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', '8217', 'actors', 'who', 'couldn', '8217', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'together', 'director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'who', 'directed', 'Malick-esque', '8216', 'George', 'Washington', '8217', 'then', '8230', '8216', 'Pineapple', 'Express', '8217', 'film', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'self-discovery', 'will', 'balk', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'go', 'anywhere', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'say', 'anything', 'devoid', 'real', 'story', 'plot', 'yet', 'say', '8220', 'deeper', '8221', '8220', 'closer', '8221', 'will', 'see', 'there.The', 'film', 'place', '1988', 'where', 'highway', 'road', 'worker', 'named', 'Alvin', 'spending', 'summer', 'painting', 'yellow', 'stripes', 'highway', 'girlfriend', '8217', 'younger', 'brother', 'Lance', 'Alvin', 'solitude', 'camping', 'out', 'woods', 'being', 'away', 'life', 'general', 'opportunity', 'reflect', 'life', 'Lance', 'people', 'longs', 'intimate', 'interaction', 'women', 'Alvin', 'fine', 'distance', 'even', '8217', 'meet', 'needs', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'growing', 'restless', 'absence', 'When', 'Lance', 'weekend', 'town', 'information', 'Alvin', '8217', 's', 'life', 'course', 'changing', 'way', 'also', 'way', 'projects', 'entire', 'life.What', 'going', 'do', 'now', '8217', 'admit', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'slight', 'deeper', 'impact', 'here', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'expecting', 'sometimes', 'simplest', 'plot', 'details', 'most', 'direct', 'emotional', 'response', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Alvin', '8217', 's', 'life', 'so', 'micromanaged', 'idea', 'what', 'what', 'others', 'need', 'misguided', 'very', 'least', 'obviously', 'built', 'cushion', 'keep', 'protected', '8216', 'control', '8217', 'Lance', 'down', 'far', 'less', '8216', 'arranged', '8217', 'world', 'world', 'colored', 'lines', 'one', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'striving', 'wind', 'Lance', '8217', 's', 'world', 'created', 'inexperience', 'Alvin', '8217', 's', 'dwells', 'world', 'almost', 'too', 'experienced', 'one', 'subliminal', 'fear', 'need', 'strike', 'balance', 'amalgam', 'particular', 'views', 'when', 'can', 'find', 'enrichment', 'never', 'thought', 'possible.But', 'first', 'need', 'collide.Rudd', 'Hirsch', 'are', 'excellent', 'here', 'Hirsch', '8217', 's', 'ticks', 'actor', 'way', 'always', 'irritated', 'best', 'suited', 'here', 'where', 'given', 'character', 'who', 'about', 'as', 'nave', 'come', 'expressions', 'betray', 'faux', 'sense', 'confidence', 'help', 'bolster', 'performance', 'rich', 'underlying', 'meaning', 'Rudd', 'Alvin', '8217', 'backstory', 'ease', 'giving', 'gruffness', 'sense', 'underlying', 'pain', 'underline', 'progressive', 'nature', 'character', 'also', 'humor', 'dry', 'awkward', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'really', 'really', 'NEED', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'work', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'would', 'fit', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'world', 'build', 'sharper', 'career', 'Hopefully', 'only', 'beginning', 'next', 'year', '8217', 'working', 'David', 'Wain', 'again', 'so', 'maybe', 'not.Yes', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'also', 'brisk', 'when', 'look', 'details', 'scene', 'destroyed', 'home', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'life', 'real', 'sense', 'character', 'development']",Prince Avalanche

1657737,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00DL47QDG,C. Sawin,"[12, 13]","Writer and director David Gordon Green has kind of lost his way over the last five years or so. Known for making independent dramas that were genuinely well received by critics, Green made the jump to R-rated comedy in 2008 with ""Pineapple Express"" which went on to gross $87 million domestically on a $27 million budget. Green would stay in the R-rated comedy game for a while with ""Your Highness"" and ""The Sitter,"" both of which either flopped or barely made a profit. ""Prince Avalanche"" seems like a return to form for Green and while it isn't groundbreaking, it's definitely an experience worth having.""Prince Avalanche"" has some amazing cinematography. The film opens with fires damaging acres and acres of land as you helplessly witness a sea of trees burn to the ground. As you're watching it, you can't help but feel the devastation of the fire, the extreme loss, and the severe sense of hopelessness. At the same time, it's kind of beautiful in a sorrowful kind of way. Little things become extraordinary with fantastic camera work: pushing a wheelbarrow over a hill as dawn breaks, water trickling through rocks in a stream, a caterpillar slowly crawling towards its destination, and close-ups of paint staining the asphalt and rain adding moisture to various surfaces.As you watch Alvin and Lance paint lines on the asphalt, hammer poles into the side of the road, and glue down street reflectors, you begin to realize how lonely it must be and yet how absolutely liberating it can feel at the same time. The two men camp out under the stars every night, live in a tent, and eat and drink at the cusp of nature at all times. They're alone out in the middle of nowhere and only have each other to keep one another company.The humor of the film mostly lies within two men craving what they can't have. Lance just wants to get laid and is amusing nearly every time he opens his mouth. His weekend story is downright entertaining. Alvin seems a bit more reserved. He's so in love with Lance's sister Madison that nothing else really matters to him. There's one amazing scene where Paul Rudd walks into the remains of a burned down house and pretends he's coming home to a loving wife in a two story home who's fixing dinner for the two of them.While the film does a fantastic job portraying the relationship between Alvin and Lance, ""Prince Avalanche"" doesn't really go anywhere when it comes to the story. By the end of the film, the two men are closer than they were at the beginning but there's little resolve otherwise. The alcoholic truck driver (Lance LeGault) and the woman searching for her pilot's license in the ashes of her former home (Joyce Payne) were interesting characters to encounter, but also didn't really have much impact on the overall story.""Prince Avalanche"" is a beautifully filmed dramatic comedy with exceptional performances from Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch. Paul Rudd should get bonus points for his Daniel Plainview-like appearance. While the story may have weak legs, the relationship between Alvin and Lance is strong enough to make ""Prince Avalanche"" a lonely road worth traveling.",3,Reap the rewards of solitude,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,3120,"['Writer', 'director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'kind', 'lost', 'way', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'Known', 'making', 'independent', 'dramas', 'were', 'genuinely', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'Green', 'made', 'jump', 'R-rated', 'comedy', '2008', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'went', 'gross', '87', 'million', 'domestically', '27', 'million', 'budget', 'Green', 'would', 'stay', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'game', 'while', 'Highness', 'Sitter', 'flopped', 'barely', 'made', 'profit', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', 'return', 'form', 'Green', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'definitely', 'experience', 'worth', 'having', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'film', 'fires', 'damaging', 'acres', 'acres', 'land', 'helplessly', 'witness', 'sea', 'trees', 'burn', 'ground', ""'re"", 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'devastation', 'fire', 'extreme', 'loss', 'severe', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'beautiful', 'sorrowful', 'kind', 'way', 'Little', 'things', 'become', 'extraordinary', 'fantastic', 'camera', 'work', 'pushing', 'wheelbarrow', 'hill', 'dawn', 'breaks', 'water', 'trickling', 'rocks', 'stream', 'caterpillar', 'slowly', 'crawling', 'destination', 'close-ups', 'paint', 'staining', 'asphalt', 'rain', 'adding', 'moisture', 'various', 'surfaces.As', 'watch', 'Alvin', 'Lance', 'paint', 'lines', 'asphalt', 'hammer', 'poles', 'side', 'road', 'glue', 'down', 'street', 'reflectors', 'begin', 'realize', 'how', 'lonely', 'must', 'be', 'yet', 'how', 'absolutely', 'liberating', 'can', 'feel', 'same', 'time', 'two', 'men', 'camp', 'out', 'stars', 'night', 'live', 'tent', 'eat', 'drink', 'cusp', 'nature', 'times', ""'re"", 'alone', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'only', 'have', 'other', 'keep', 'one', 'company.The', 'humor', 'film', 'mostly', 'two', 'men', 'craving', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Lance', 'just', 'get', 'laid', 'amusing', 'nearly', 'time', 'mouth', 'weekend', 'story', 'downright', 'entertaining', 'Alvin', 'bit', 'more', 'reserved', 'so', 'love', 'Lance', 'sister', 'Madison', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'matters', 'one', 'amazing', 'scene', 'where', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'remains', 'burned', 'down', 'house', 'coming', 'home', 'loving', 'wife', 'two', 'story', 'home', 'who', 'fixing', 'dinner', 'two', 'film', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'relationship', 'Alvin', 'Lance', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'when', 'story', 'end', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'closer', 'were', 'beginning', 'little', 'resolve', 'otherwise', 'alcoholic', 'truck', 'driver', 'Lance', 'LeGault', 'woman', 'searching', 'pilot', 'license', 'ashes', 'former', 'home', 'Joyce', 'Payne', 'were', 'interesting', 'characters', 'encounter', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'overall', 'story', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'should', 'get', 'bonus', 'points', 'Daniel', 'Plainview-like', 'appearance', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'weak', 'legs', 'relationship', 'Alvin', 'Lance', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'Prince', 'Avalanche', 'lonely', 'road', 'traveling']",Prince Avalanche

The film takes a predictable but interesting twist when the more sophisticated of the two is dumped by his girlfriend.I don't think Prince Avalanche sold itself well. Audiences these days are much too smart to just admit that self deprecating is cool. It didn't have any redeeming humour to work with. While it does try to be a real portrayal of lives, it ends up making the real look too mundane, too sad and nothing worth writing him about.If the intention of the director was any different than celibate mediocrity, he didn't display that intention too well.The acting is decent but the film was quite a drag.

The movie is full of subtle philosophy, which you'll probably enjoy to decipher.

1657750,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00DL47QDG,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","This small, low-budget indi-film by David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") is loosely based on an Icelandic film from 2011 called ""Either Way.""  Set in central Texas in 1988 after a devastating wildfire had destroyed acres of woodlands and homes.  (Note: The movie was actually shot in the Bastrop State Park, southeast of Austin which suffered a huge fire in 2011).  Alvin (Paul Rudd), who lives in the Dallas area with his girlfriend is a road worker of the state and has been assigned to paint new lines and install signs on a remote highway.  His subordinate is Lance (Emile Hirsch), the brother of his girlfriend.  Lance has no experience at much of anything but was given the job because of his sister's relationship.The pair have little in common but make the best of their isolated time together.  Because of the distance involved to the nearest city, Alvin and Lance spend the nights in the burned out forest until the weekend.  Even then Alvin decides to go it alone to get his thoughts together about his life and possible marriage.  That's pretty much it.  This is a simple film about two guys sharing their less than perfect lives with each other.  There are conflicts about girls, marriage, kids, music, and sex.  There are some funny moments as well as more serious ones.In one of the better scenes, Alvin is wandering about when he comes across an elderly woman (Joyce Payne) poking through the ashes of what was once her home.  The movie changes gears here a bit and becomes a mini documentary as the woman tells Alvin where the furniture once was and how she is searching for her pilot's license amongst the ash.  The fact that this is not an actress, makes the scene even more poignant.  Perhaps it should have lasted longer or perhaps there should have been more scenes like this.  I think Green missed the boat.Lance LeGault does give the film a bit of energy when his truck driver character shows up out of nowhere to ply the boys with liquor.  Otherwise the film drags much of the time.  There just isn't much there there to coin a phrase.  On the plus side, Hirsch and Rudd do a fine job with the script, lean as it is.  I suspect there was some improvisation.  The film also features a nice soundtrack by Explosions in the Sky.The Blu ray transfer has the usual 1080p video resolution and retains the film's 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Shot with digital cameras, the movie looks great.  Excellent colors, deep blacks and natural skin tones never waiver.  Some fine camera work features snippets of flowers emerging from the burned out landscape.  Colors of yellow and red seem most prominent.  The disc features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it very good recognizing that this is a dialog heavy film, lacking in natural surround sound opportunities.  We do get some birds and chickens flapping about.  The rest is properly focused up front and is very clear.  Here are the extras:  Commentary with Green and other production assistants, a deleted scene, Paul & Emile (character development), From the Ashes featurette, Lance LeGault remembered, interviews with Rudd, Hirsch and Green, a trailer and AXS TV promo.",3,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Being alone does not mean being lonely,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,3139,"['small', 'low-budget', 'indi-film', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'loosely', 'based', 'Icelandic', 'film', '2011', 'called', 'Way', 'Set', 'central', 'Texas', '1988', 'devastating', 'wildfire', 'had', 'destroyed', 'acres', 'woodlands', 'homes', 'Note', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Bastrop', 'State', 'Park', 'southeast', 'Austin', 'suffered', 'huge', 'fire', '2011', 'Alvin', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'Dallas', 'area', 'girlfriend', 'road', 'worker', 'state', 'been', 'assigned', 'paint', 'new', 'lines', 'install', 'signs', 'remote', 'highway', 'subordinate', 'Lance', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Lance', 'experience', 'much', 'anything', 'was', 'given', 'job', 'sister', 'relationship.The', 'pair', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'make', 'best', 'isolated', 'time', 'together', 'distance', 'involved', 'nearest', 'city', 'Alvin', 'Lance', 'spend', 'nights', 'burned', 'out', 'forest', 'weekend', 'Even', 'then', 'Alvin', 'go', 'alone', 'get', 'thoughts', 'together', 'life', 'possible', 'marriage', 'pretty', 'much', 'simple', 'film', 'two', 'guys', 'sharing', 'less', 'perfect', 'lives', 'other', 'are', 'conflicts', 'girls', 'marriage', 'kids', 'music', 'sex', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'serious', 'one', 'better', 'scenes', 'Alvin', 'wandering', 'about', 'when', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Joyce', 'Payne', 'poking', 'ashes', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'home', 'movie', 'changes', 'gears', 'here', 'bit', 'mini', 'documentary', 'woman', 'Alvin', 'where', 'furniture', 'once', 'was', 'how', 'searching', 'pilot', 'license', 'ash', 'fact', 'not', 'actress', 'scene', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'think', 'Green', 'missed', 'boat.Lance', 'LeGault', 'give', 'film', 'bit', 'energy', 'when', 'truck', 'driver', 'character', 'up', 'nowhere', 'ply', 'boys', 'liquor', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'much', 'time', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'there', 'coin', 'phrase', 'plus', 'side', 'Hirsch', 'Rudd', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'script', 'lean', 'suspect', 'was', 'improvisation', 'film', 'also', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'Explosions', 'Sky.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'usual', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', 'film', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Shot', 'digital', 'cameras', 'movie', 'great', 'Excellent', 'colors', 'deep', 'blacks', 'natural', 'skin', 'tones', 'never', 'waiver', 'fine', 'camera', 'work', 'snippets', 'flowers', 'emerging', 'burned', 'out', 'landscape', 'Colors', 'yellow', 'red', 'seem', 'most', 'prominent', 'disc', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'very', 'good', 'recognizing', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'film', 'lacking', 'natural', 'surround', 'sound', 'opportunities', 'do', 'get', 'birds', 'chickens', 'flapping', 'about', 'rest', 'properly', 'focused', 'up', 'front', 'very', 'clear', 'Here', 'are', 'extras', 'Commentary', 'Green', 'other', 'production', 'assistants', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Paul', 'Emile', 'character', 'development', 'Ashes', 'featurette', 'Lance', 'LeGault', 'remembered', 'interviews', 'Rudd', 'Hirsch', 'Green', 'trailer', 'AXS', 'TV', 'promo']",Prince Avalanche

The script allows both characters to breathe and grow as the film progresses, questioning their lot in life, their sense of direction, and even their own values.  They are both endearingly, believably naive and this lends a wonderful charm to their story.At times slowly paced and a tad bit arty, director Green nevertheless imbues Prince Avalanche with a spontaneous feel- not necessarily in the plotting as much as the dialog.  Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch are in top form here, understated and reflective, and innocently goofy when necessary.One personal note- I am extremely familiar with Bastrop, Tx. and the state park wherein much of the principal filming took place.

1657756,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00DL47QDG,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 3]","This is an American indie film from film maker David Gordon Green. His chequered career has seen him bring us `Pineapple Express, `Your Highness' and the rather good `Undertow'; in this film he has taken inspiration from an original story by Icelander  Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurosson. He has relocated that to the fire ravaged forests of Texas in 1988. We meet the two main protagonists in Alvin (Paul Rudd - `Role Models and `I Love you man') he is working out his demons by working on the road painting service. His only companion is the brother of his girlfriend Lance, Emile Hirsch (`Into the wild' and `Milk'). He considers Lance to be a loser.Now very little actually happens, they paint the road, erect some signs , meet an aged truck driver and an elderly woman who is searching her burnt out home to salvage memories . This lady was really doing that and was asked if her story could be put into the film - which is a nice touch. The idea was that this would be an absurdist, minimalist tale where the two main characters would slowly reveal their real characters - both strengths and weaknesses by just being together or alone with their own thoughts, and some alcohol and heart ache.So does it work? Well a lot of people seem to think so with a 6.4 rating on IMDB this is certainly no turkey. It is also supposed to be a 'hilarious' comedy; well I felt amused a couple of times but this is not even in the foothills of being funny. The characterisation is good and some of the absurd themes sort of work, but overall I felt under whelmed by this film. It is only 90 minutes long and the scenery is often beautiful. The score is from `Explosions in the Sky' and `Loosley Tight' and that also really works, I would give 6 out of ten which roughly equates with 3 stars. That is not meant to be harsh but to ignore the areas where this does not work would, I feel, be disingenuous.

1657757,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00DL47QDG,Tony Heck,"[4, 5]","""There's a difference between being lonely and being alone."" Alvin (Rudd) and Lance (Hirsch) are working on a road in the middle of nowhere. Alvin is dating Lance's sister and the two have a friendly relationship but they aren't really friends. During the summer they experience the high and lows of love and begin to bond over the ups and downs of life. First of all even though Paul Rudd is in this I would not call this a comedy. I really liked this but do not go in expecting to laugh. One other disclaimer is that this isn't a movie where a lot happens. The director of this directed Pinapple Express and The Sitter and this could not be more different then those two. This is a hard movie to review because really nothing happens but I did really enjoy this. This is basically just two guys experiencing life and love. There is a sub-plot with a woman they meet that seemed to have deeper meaning that I couldn't grasp. This is a movie I recommend though. Overall, a movie that isn't for everyone but one that I enjoyed and recommend for fans of indi-movies. I give it a B+.",4,A movie that isn't for everyone but one that I enjoyed and recommend for fans of indi-movies. Acting is great.
