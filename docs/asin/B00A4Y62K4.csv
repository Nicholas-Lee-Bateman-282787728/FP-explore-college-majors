Most women enjoy a ""chick flick"" to watch on a date with their Valentine and The Bouquet is the perfect feel good movie. While I don't typically enjoy romantic movies, this one had more depth to it where the focus wasn't just on a love story. It's about family, both by birth and by choice, and the ties that can bind or break them.Growing up with a sister close to my age, I can understand the competition, rivalry and jealousy that occurs. There are many dynamics between siblings and fighting for their parents attention is commonplace. Terri and Mandy have had a tumultuous relationship but tragedy forces them to put their differences aside to focus on what really matters.The movie got off to a bit of a slow start for me but by midway I was completely into the movie. It does have a slower pace but that's also the way of life in rural America. It's a good reminder to slow down, smell the flowers and cherish the moments with family and friends that might not be there forever. It's easy to get caught up in jobs, making money and the business of life.
