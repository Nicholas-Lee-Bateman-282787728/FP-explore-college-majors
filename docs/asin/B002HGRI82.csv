Jack Bishop a widower with a young daughter and a new wife live an everyday life until his daughter Toby are kidnapped. Slowly Jack's dark past comes into focus while he searches for his lost child, even turning to the religion of Santa Muerte to try to find the little girl. What follows is an interesting mystery thriller with some good but rather obvious plot twists.The movie have a dark and atmospheric mood to it and this is it's best feature. The story is rather ok, the characters are well done but where Not Forgotten shines is in the mood. Both the use of color as well as the music is very well done. The movie have some phasing problems though and do get boring in certain sections.Another thing this movie has going for it are the strong element of religion. While the cult of Santa Muerte is used as the villain of this plot, it is still presented in a great way and the movie made me want to go out and learn more about the religion. The inclusion of curses and blood soaked rituals adds to the mood of the film, but at the same time this faith which many real life people follows are treated with respect.Not Forgotten had it's flaws, it moves to slowly at times at the plot is to obvious to make a good mystery. But all in all I think it is a good movie with strong themes, good characters and with a focus on a religion that many people, at least here in Europe do not know much about.

Incredibly unprofessional, slanderous comments were made towards Baker who obviously had artistic differences with these baffons.  I hope he got his money up front and cut them loose though he has plenty of material for a lawsuit.  He gave them a great performance despite their obvious disdain and slandering of him behind his back such as ""at least Simon has good hair but that's about the only decent thing I can say about him.

He is living in a quiet Texas-Mexico border town, happily married to his beautiful wife Amaya (Paz Vega). One day his daughter Tobey (Chloe Moretz) goes missing, perhaps kidnapped by someone, or perhaps involved in an accident.Time passes by and Jack starts investigating on his own. He soon realizes that his daughter's disappearance has something to do with his past.... Well, actually, there are lots more in the slow-moving story, like some supernatural elements and a lengthy torture scene using a broken bottle, but to be frank I lost interest in whatever is going on about 30 minutes in.With the pretty impressive cast including Chole Moretz, or Chlo Grace Moretz, better known as ""Hit-Girl"" of ""Kick Ass,"" the thriller ""Not Forgotten"" should have been much more interesting. Sorry, but what you get here is a confusing mess of a movie that does not know where and how storytelling should be done. So many hints are dropped in the earlier stage, clearly trying to set up some big surprises for the later part (and I admit I couldn't predict them).However, with a story that is told clumsily, there is no mystery, no suspense, nothing really intense in the film's slow-paced narrative. ""Not Forgotten"" never generates tension, perhaps except the last chapter. By the time we get to the film's conclusion, however, most of us would lose interest in whatever is going on before us.Simon Baker does his best as Jack, a mild-mannered guy who begins to show a totally different side as the story unfolds, and surely his fans will be interested, while fans of Chloe Moretz would be disappointed as she looks terribly bored, given no chance to show what the talented player can really do.",2,"Nice Cast (Including Simon Baker, Paz Vega and Chlo Grace Moretz) Wasted in Thrill-less Thriller",1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1785,"['Simon', 'Baker', 'Mentalist', 'Jack', 'Bishop', 'ordinary', 'businessman', 'father', 'one', 'daughter', 'living', 'quiet', 'Texas-Mexico', 'border', 'town', 'happily', 'married', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Amaya', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'One', 'day', 'daughter', 'Tobey', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'missing', 'perhaps', 'kidnapped', 'someone', 'perhaps', 'involved', 'accident.Time', 'passes', 'Jack', 'investigating', 'own', 'soon', 'daughter', 'disappearance', 'something', 'do', 'past', 'Well', 'actually', 'are', 'lots', 'more', 'slow-moving', 'story', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'lengthy', 'torture', 'scene', 'using', 'broken', 'bottle', 'be', 'frank', 'lost', 'interest', 'going', '30', 'minutes', 'in.With', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'cast', 'including', 'Chole', 'Moretz', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'better', 'known', 'Hit-Girl', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'thriller', 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Sorry', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'confusing', 'mess', 'movie', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'how', 'storytelling', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'So', 'many', 'hints', 'are', 'dropped', 'earlier', 'stage', 'clearly', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'big', 'surprises', 'later', 'part', 'admit', 'could', ""n't"", 'predict', '.However', 'story', 'told', 'clumsily', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'nothing', 'really', 'intense', 'film', 'slow-paced', 'narrative', 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'never', 'tension', 'perhaps', 'last', 'chapter', 'time', 'get', 'film', 'conclusion', 'however', 'most', 'would', 'lose', 'interest', 'going', 'us.Simon', 'Baker', 'best', 'Jack', 'mild-mannered', 'guy', 'who', 'show', 'totally', 'different', 'side', 'story', 'unfolds', 'surely', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'fans', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'terribly', 'bored', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'talented', 'player', 'can', 'really', 'do']",N/A

The Mentalist is one of my favorite TV shows and I have seen Paz Vega in other movies. So I didn't hesitate to get the movie. What a mistake!The plot is quite complicated and really difficult to imagine. Jack Bishop (Simon Baker) is a businessman, and coach of the soccer team that his daughter Tobey (Chloe Moretz) is playing on. They are living in a Texas border town. He is married to Amaya (Paz Vega). She is not the mother of Tobey. One day, just before practice, his daughter is kidnapped by someone and then...the movie starts. The cops are getting involved and are investigating. They ask Jack about his ex wife and he says that she died and that he doesn't remember where his wife is burried and doesn't have a death certificate. He also doesn't remember how his wife died. And the cops say ....OK, no problem (!). From that point on I stopped taking this movie seriously and just watched to see where the pathetic director is taking us. Probably one of the worst direction I have ever seen! When the director of a movie accepts such nonsense then the whole script belongs in the garbage.This is a bad movie all around. Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, especially the direction. Not sure why they keep showing the river with the border line between Texas and Mexico all the time. At no point we believe that Baker is that reformed assassin while the direction of the movie is at best pathetic.  The movie jumps from one scene to the other without any cohesion and smooth transitions.Two stars for Chloe Moretz who tries to save the movie and for the end that is unexpected. But the plot had potential with another director and with someone who can really play a guy with two personalities (Ralph Fiennes comes to mind instead of Simon Baker).",2,Forget this movie!,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,1868,"['movie', 'try', 'forget', 'bought', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'too', 'much', 'few', 'spent', 'Amazon', 'Mentalist', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'other', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'get', 'movie', 'What', 'mistake', 'plot', 'quite', 'complicated', 'really', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'Jack', 'Bishop', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'businessman', 'coach', 'soccer', 'team', 'daughter', 'Tobey', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'playing', 'are', 'living', 'Texas', 'border', 'town', 'married', 'Amaya', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'not', 'mother', 'Tobey', 'One', 'day', 'just', 'practice', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'someone', 'then', 'movie', 'cops', 'are', 'getting', 'involved', 'are', 'investigating', 'ask', 'Jack', 'ex', 'wife', 'died', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'wife', 'burried', ""n't"", 'have', 'death', 'certificate', 'also', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'wife', 'died', 'cops', 'say', '.OK', 'problem', 'point', 'stopped', 'taking', 'movie', 'seriously', 'just', 'watched', 'see', 'where', 'pathetic', 'director', 'taking', 'Probably', 'one', 'worst', 'direction', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'When', 'director', 'movie', 'accepts', 'such', 'nonsense', 'then', 'whole', 'script', 'belongs', 'garbage.This', 'bad', 'movie', 'around', 'Bad', 'plot', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'direction', 'especially', 'direction', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'keep', 'showing', 'river', 'border', 'line', 'Texas', 'Mexico', 'time', 'point', 'believe', 'Baker', 'reformed', 'assassin', 'direction', 'movie', 'best', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'jumps', 'one', 'scene', 'other', 'cohesion', 'smooth', 'transitions.Two', 'stars', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'who', 'save', 'movie', 'end', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'had', 'potential', 'director', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'guy', 'two', 'personalities', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'mind', 'instead', 'Simon', 'Baker']",N/A
