370579,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,6303364705,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[4, 6]","In these very days Ignatius Press is publishing a new biography of Very Reverend Mother Benedict Duss, OSB, the foundress of Regina Laudis Abbey in rural Bethlehem Connecticut, who after the liberation of World War II traveled from the Benedictine Abbey in Jouarre, France to New York and New England, where she did receive welcome reception by artist Lauren Ford of Sheepfold, as mentioned in another review here which relates the true story much more accurately than this fictionalized and romanticized film which was always more of an embarrassment to the real community than a help or a chronicle.She and the embryonic Benedictine foundation then received a generous donation of land and buildings from industrialist Robert Leather, including a former brass factory and a rather small residence soon converted into monastic cells and chapel which now serves as the men's guest house, as the factory building was converted into the main monastic residence and chapel. Now with their growth into an Abbey, new buildings and centers are developed including the magnificent new Abbatial Church and choir.As mentioned in the other review, this film, which would be welcome as curiosity in dvd format, was scripted by Claire Boothe Luce, wife of the Time magazine publisher and ambassadress to Rome after her conversion to Catholicism. Her personal ambience and concerns and spirituality and rather quaint and stereotypical perception of life in religious community are herein reflected; yet some true incidents do come through, such as the discarding of a parking ticket in Manhattan by Mother Mary Aline under the understanding it was merely advertising posted under their borrowed windshield wiper, which is said to have been based on true life.This movie nevertheless serves as a mere shadow puppet playing of the profound reality, which we eagerly await to read through the well-known Ignatius Press and the talented writer (also authoress of the moral theological text Choosing Mercy) who compiled her comprehensive and true biography after close interviews with the Foundress in her final years.",5,"AS WE AWAIT NOW THE NEW BIOGRAPHY OF THE FOUNDRESS OF REGINA LAUDIS, THIS FREELY FICTIONALIZED VERSION MAY INTEREST SOME",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2100,"['very', 'days', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'publishing', 'new', 'biography', 'Very', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'Benedict', 'Duss', 'OSB', 'foundress', 'Regina', 'Laudis', 'Abbey', 'rural', 'Bethlehem', 'Connecticut', 'who', 'liberation', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'traveled', 'Benedictine', 'Abbey', 'Jouarre', 'France', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'England', 'where', 'did', 'receive', 'welcome', 'reception', 'artist', 'Lauren', 'Ford', 'Sheepfold', 'mentioned', 'review', 'here', 'true', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'accurately', 'fictionalized', 'romanticized', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'embarrassment', 'real', 'community', 'help', 'chronicle.She', 'embryonic', 'Benedictine', 'foundation', 'then', 'received', 'generous', 'donation', 'land', 'buildings', 'industrialist', 'Robert', 'Leather', 'including', 'former', 'brass', 'factory', 'rather', 'small', 'residence', 'soon', 'converted', 'monastic', 'cells', 'chapel', 'now', 'men', 'guest', 'house', 'factory', 'building', 'was', 'converted', 'main', 'monastic', 'residence', 'chapel', 'Now', 'growth', 'Abbey', 'new', 'buildings', 'centers', 'are', 'developed', 'including', 'magnificent', 'new', 'Abbatial', 'Church', 'choir.As', 'mentioned', 'other', 'review', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'curiosity', 'dvd', 'format', 'was', 'scripted', 'Claire', 'Boothe', 'Luce', 'wife', 'Time', 'magazine', 'publisher', 'ambassadress', 'Rome', 'conversion', 'Catholicism', 'personal', 'ambience', 'concerns', 'spirituality', 'rather', 'quaint', 'stereotypical', 'perception', 'life', 'religious', 'community', 'are', 'herein', 'reflected', 'true', 'incidents', 'do', 'come', 'such', 'discarding', 'parking', 'ticket', 'Manhattan', 'Mother', 'Mary', 'Aline', 'understanding', 'was', 'merely', 'advertising', 'posted', 'borrowed', 'wiper', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'true', 'life.This', 'movie', 'nevertheless', 'mere', 'shadow', 'puppet', 'playing', 'profound', 'reality', 'eagerly', 'await', 'read', 'well-known', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'talented', 'writer', 'also', 'authoress', 'moral', 'theological', 'text', 'Choosing', 'Mercy', 'who', 'compiled', 'comprehensive', 'true', 'biography', 'close', 'interviews', 'Foundress', 'final', 'years']",Come to the Stable VHS

When relaying to me her favorite holiday movies she always mentioned ""Come to the Stable"".  She had an old copy that she taped off commercial TV but she never had a DVD version.  I've been looking for years for her but no dice.  She mentioned it to me again recently and by chance I came across an outfit in San Diego that was selling a multi-region DVD printed in Asia.  I had it mailed to my Mom and asked her if she was satisfied with the quality.  She said she was and thanked me profusely.  My mother having grown up in the Forties has an affinity for films of that era.  I grew up in the Seventies so I have nostalgia for that time.  I borrowed the disc from her to see what the hubub was about.  All I can say is it is what it is-a nice little film.  It's formula but it's a formula that works.  It's no better or worse than some of the heartwarming films that crop up on the Hallmark Channel.  It's not out of place if you were to view it during the holiday season.

370594,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303364705,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","This the holiday season, sentimental fare like COME TO THE STABLE rises to the fore like clockwork. Not as well known as Crosby's GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY, not as seminal as LILIES IN THE FIELD, COME TO THE STABLE still manages to infiltrate your cynical self and work into your good graces. It doles out an abundance of warmth and gentle humor, and the cast is marvelous. I say park the entire family in front of this charming 1949 comedy.Sister Margaret (Loretta Young) and the awesomely named Sister Scolastica (a demure Celeste Holm) are two near penniless nuns from a French convent come to Bethlehem, Connecticut to fulfill a sacred vow to found a children's hospital. They've cut down their list of necessities to two essential items: they now only require land and financing. Heh. Their primary assets are their unwavering faith and a relentless way about them that would impress even the Terminator. They seek charity from those around them - never mind that those around them may scoff at their improbable mission - and although the sisters go about their task with cheery serenity, there's a doggedness there. And a certain obliviousness in their approach. They're almost dismissive of the daunting impracticality of their objective. But that's faith for ya.There's a fascinating element here, in watching these two nuns alternately charm, befuddle, and exasperate those they encounter and, in the end, achieving their lofty goal. It speaks of a Teflon-like mystique which surrounds nuns. They are unassailable figures. There's no use getting mad at them. Even underworld figures don't dare mess with the sisters. Those seemingly insurmountable obstacles that had initially faced Sisters Margaret and Scolastica soon tumble down like sand castles.Loretta Young and Celeste Holm do their utmost to ingratiate themselves to the audience, submitting delightful, low-keyed performances, with Young getting the lion's share of the dialogue. Although in very good form, Young doesn't quite match her impeccable turn in THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER. Still, Young would be nominated for an Oscar in the leading actress category but would lose out to THE HEIRESS' Olivia de Havilland. Celeste Holm is so very disarming as the shy French nun, and her French accent is ridiculously spot on. The sisters are given traits guaranteed to have you big grinning, from Sister Margaret's reckless driving of the jeep to Sister Scolastica's susprising reveal as an ex-champion tennis player. For me, the meek Sister Scolastica's expert fielding of tennis balls on the court provides the film's most memorable and unexpected imagery.No sneering villains in this one, no bad guys, really. The nuns brave the den of a notorious racketeer, but even those scenes don't exude a sense of peril, and the mob boss (Thomas Gomez), when confronted with the nuns' disconcerting directness, gives way like silly putty. The plot's central conflict comes from the resentment of a music composer (Hugh Marlowe) who rails against a children's hospital being erected next to his home. Marlowe plays his character as harried and  irascible but we all know he's a good dude at heart. To round off the supporting cast, Elsa Lanchaster - who, along with Celeste Holm, would be nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar - plays a distracted artist who reluctantly opens up her stable-cum-art studio to shelter the nuns. Dooley Wilson - or ""Sam"" from CASABLANCA - is the composer's quietly undermining butler. Basil Ruysdael is the stern local Bishop who warily keeps an eye on the nuns' progress.There's a good balance of comedy and drama, the film treating us to a story that is heartfelt without being preachy. It's a bit of a shame that COME TO THE STABLE has become a neglected gem, even though it garnered the sum of seven Academy Award nominations. This movie was well regarded enough that there was a proposed sequel - titled A SPARK IN THE NIGHT - which would've reunited Young and Holm, although nothing ever came of it.

370595,A3RUMI4Y58S59,6303364705,Heaven's Hound,"[0, 0]","Most people know little about Loretta Young's career. Much of what they know is based on their familiarity with her hugely successful TV show of the 1950s when she and Lucille Ball were TV's biggest stars.  But the Loretta Young of the early 30s and precode Hollywood was quite a different actress.  In those days, she played tough working class women opposite tough Hollywood actors like James Cagney (Taxi) and Spencer Tracy (A Man's Castle).  In those early days she had no qualms about playing sexy women who always got their man.  Then as she blossomed into womanhood, Hollywood realized they had on their hands one the most beautiful women on the silver screen, and she was ""promoted"" to roles of socialites and queens (Suez).  In Come to the Stable Young plays for the first time a nun (she played a nun several times on her TV show).  And she is quite good, as good as Ingrid Bergman, famous for playing a nun in The Bells of St. Mary.  What most people don't know is the the screenplay for this film was written by Clare Booth Luce, and it was specifically written for Loretta Young.  Both Luce and Young were well-known Catholics.  And they were both known for promulgating their Catholicism, for which many in Hollywood resented them; Young more resented when the world learned she and Clark Gable were lovers and Young had a child by him, a daughter she adopted through a ruse that tricked most of Hollywood and surely most of her legions of fans.  Nevertheless, Come to the Stable is a charming film with terrific performances by Young and Celeste Holm.  It has the charm and timelessness of A Wonderful Life and The Bishop's Wife.  Parents, you can without worry allow your children to watch this film.  They may indeed be uplifted and inspired by it, for it's a story of two selfless people who have devoted their lives to helping the sick, their main goal to establish a hospital in America.  With all the junk available to our children, our kids today could perhaps learn something from a film like this.  Both Young and Holm were nominated for Academy Awards, Young for best actress, Holm for best supporting actress.  And they both deserved their nominations.  Hope the film is cast in a better DVD. It deserves to be available to all film buffs.  Last word, watch Young in her early 30s films, you'll be surprised by how good an actress she was when only in her teens.  And as for her beauty:  she's breathtaking, and for a sight of that, watch the opening scenes, if you can find the film, of Suez.  She is stunning, and steals every scene from Tyrone Power, no easy task for he was almost as beautiful as Young.",5,Loretta Young: from Midnight Mary to a Nun!,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2633,"['Most', 'people', 'know', 'little', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'career', 'Much', 'what', 'know', 'based', 'familiarity', 'hugely', 'successful', 'TV', 'show', '1950s', 'when', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'were', 'TV', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'early', '30s', 'precode', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'actress', 'days', 'played', 'tough', 'working', 'class', 'women', 'opposite', 'tough', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Taxi', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'A', 'Man', 'Castle', 'early', 'days', 'had', 'qualms', 'playing', 'sexy', 'women', 'who', 'always', 'got', 'man', 'Then', 'blossomed', 'womanhood', 'Hollywood', 'realized', 'had', 'hands', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'promoted', 'roles', 'socialites', 'queens', 'Suez', 'Come', 'Stable', 'Young', 'plays', 'first', 'time', 'nun', 'played', 'nun', 'several', 'times', 'TV', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'good', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'famous', 'playing', 'nun', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'screenplay', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Clare', 'Booth', 'Luce', 'was', 'specifically', 'written', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Luce', 'Young', 'were', 'well-known', 'Catholics', 'were', 'known', 'promulgating', 'Catholicism', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'resented', 'Young', 'more', 'resented', 'when', 'world', 'learned', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'were', 'lovers', 'Young', 'had', 'child', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'ruse', 'tricked', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'surely', 'most', 'legions', 'fans', 'Nevertheless', 'Come', 'Stable', 'charming', 'film', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Young', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'charm', 'timelessness', 'A', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'Parents', 'can', 'worry', 'allow', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'uplifted', 'inspired', 'story', 'two', 'selfless', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'devoted', 'lives', 'helping', 'sick', 'main', 'goal', 'establish', 'hospital', 'America', 'junk', 'available', 'children', 'kids', 'today', 'could', 'perhaps', 'learn', 'something', 'film', 'Young', 'Holm', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Young', 'best', 'actress', 'Holm', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'deserved', 'nominations', 'Hope', 'film', 'cast', 'better', 'DVD', 'be', 'available', 'film', 'buffs', 'Last', 'word', 'watch', 'Young', 'early', '30s', 'films', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'actress', 'was', 'when', 'only', 'teens', 'beauty', 'breathtaking', 'sight', 'watch', 'opening', 'scenes', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'Suez', 'stunning', 'steals', 'scene', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'easy', 'task', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Young']",Come to the Stable VHS

370613,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,6303364705,Marvin D. Pipher,"[2, 2]","This film was made shortly after World War II: a time when movie goers could take their children to the movies without fear, where they could buy their ten cent popcorn and their five cent cokes, learn a simple moral lesson, and leave the theater feeling better than when they went in.  It was a time when America was perceived as the greatest Christian nation on Earth and Americans as being a highly moral people.  That perception, in my view, was due in large measure to foreigners viewing films such as this.  Unfortunately, those days are gone forever.It&#8217;s not an artful film: the plot isn&#8217;t particularly believable; the characters are right out of &#8216;Guys and Dolls&#8217; and &#8216;The Bells of St. Mary&#8217;s&#8217;; and the acting isn&#8217;t of the finest.  But it tells a heartwarming story: the story of two nuns who arrive in the United States shortly after World War II&#8217;s end, virtually penniless, but intent on building a hospital in America.  It&#8217;s a story that, if you&#8217;re not careful, will draw you in, bring a bit of joy to your heart and maybe even a tear to your eye.

This story of the simple faith of, in particular, two nuns who come to Pennsylvania from Europe to establish a hospital, is heartwarming, occasionally funny, touching, enchanting.  Elsa Lanchester is wonderful in the film too, unwittingly taking the two nuns in and providing them with lodging, soon expanding her hospitality to almost a dozen of them as they work to raise the money that will help them buy the building that will be their starter hospital.

Loretta Young, a staunch catholic in real life is one of those rare actresses in a league with the likes of Ingrid Bergman, Deborah Kerr and Audrey Hepburn , that seem totally convincing as nuns whether it be in their displays of humility in portraying their characters or just by the total immersion that they undergo when taking on the nun role.&quot;Come to the Stable&quot; tells a very simple but extremely moving story based on a short story by Clare Booth Luce, of the journey that two nuns, one American and one french, make to fulfill a solemn vow made during World War 2. Resulting from the fact that through prayer to St. Jude, the Patron Saint of lost causes, their hospital was spared destruction by the advancing forces the two make a vow to return to America to set up a similiar hospital for young infants in Bethlehem, Connecticut where they have learnt of a woman who paints very beautiful religious paintings. After finding the right place atop a serene hill with perfect views of the town the nuns with very little money, very few propects and with a strong unquestioning faith proceed to achieve everything that has become their lifes work. Their journey from a hopeless situation with no funds to build the hospital or obtain the land, to one that inspires others to get involved to achieve the dream of the new hospital makes for inspirational viewing and puts across the strong message of the basic good of all people if you only take the time to look for it. In their drive to fulfill their aim the nun's encounter some interesting characters who's lives they alter in very positive ways. Miss Potts played by Elsa Lancaster in a wonderful performance is a lonely spinister who loves to paint and finds her whole life turned upside down by the unexpected arrival of the nuns on her door step. She for the first time finds a real purpose to her existence as she involves herself totally in the plans of Sister Margaret and Sister Scholastica (Celeste Holm). In their search for land to build the church on the sisters find themselves travelling to New York where they encounter small time con man Luigi Rossi who after hearing their story not only gives them a sizable donation but also the deed to the land with the promise that a commerative stained glass window will be installed in memory of his son who was lost in the war not far from where the sisters nursed in Northern France. His transformation from a small time hood to a man with a conscience is only one of the miracles that the nuns work in their dealings with others. Hugh Marlowe plays the nuns new and indeed quite unhappy neighbour Robert Mason who despite being against the idea of a hospital literally in his backyard finds himself helping the nuns and in a crucial situation where the nuns find themselves short of financing for their repayments, chips in and ensures the sisters dream becomes a reality.Directed with a sentimental but sure hand by veteran director Henry Koster who was responsible for such diverse efforts as &quot;Harvey&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;' and &quot;The Robe&quot;, the representation of what strong belief can do to achieve great things either big or small in ones life is always the central theme of &quot;Come to the Stable&quot;. Loretta Young as Sister Margaret was an inspirational choice as the lead in a role originally intended for Irene Dunne. She is everything a nun should be, strong, gracious, determined, and a firm believer in the basic good in man. Her's is a superb performance which quite rightly received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actress. Equally honoured is the beautifully unplayed performance of Celeste Holm in the role of French nun Sister Scholastica, Sister Margaret's helper who in a comical moment reveals herself in a past life to have been a top class French tennis player in a scene where she is forced to play in full nun's habit for high stakes, namely a large badly needed donation to the building fund!Such beautifully put together films as &quot;Come to the Stable&quot; often make me wonder what Hollywood is really doing nowadays as such delicate themes as guiding faith and divine providence,  would not be able to be made nowadays what with the harsh reality of most modern screenplays. I never fail to be touched by this story or by the wonderful performance by Loretta Young in the lead. It is a heart warming viewing experience for anyone who has ever had avow to fulfill or a dream to pursue. Watch this film and  be inpired as I always am to try and fulfill my dreams while enjoying an terrific excursion back to movie making as it used to be.",5,Beautiful depiction of a Nun's faith and
