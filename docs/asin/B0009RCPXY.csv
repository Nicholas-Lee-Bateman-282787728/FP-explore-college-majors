911115,A1SW2FBJI2IA3N,B0009RCPXY,Aly,"[1, 1]","I grew up with the Swan Princess movies mixed in with the Disney classics and a few other here-and-there animated features like Thumbelina, Anastasia, and Quest for Camelot. If you've seen this movie, this review won't aid you in your decision; I'm more or less going to be giving an overview of the actual movie rather than the product, itself, as a physical piece.Okay, so the first Swan Princess is just great in every way, right? At least, that's probably your opinion if you're here for the third installment in the series. Even the second one was really good. This one is also fairly good, but there are a few points in the movie that I just want to kick whoever let this happen. Let me just say this, do NOT watch this movie if you love Rogers and how he's been portrayed in the first--and even the second--movie. In those first two, he's sarcastic, witty, dignified, and a good guide for Derek. He's kinda twisted, too, with how much he bullies Bromley. All in all, he's hilarious and grows even funnier to us as we get older and understand more of his jokes and intentions.(UPCOMING SPOILER ALERT)However, this is NOT the Rogers we see in this third installment of the series. He might be at the very beginning, but once a character ""named"" Zelda comes into the picture... Well, he turns into the biggest idiot I've ever beheld and NOT in a good way. The woman is clearly lacking in morality for the very reason of winning his affections and favor and, a shock to all of us who thought Rogers had some dignity, it works. He's an absolute fool and that results in a huge slipup in security and a musical number we could all have done without.That's the main issue with the third movie though. The rest isn't too bad and, honestly, I really like the ending, as ambiguous as it is in part. I won't spoil it, but, to me, it really ties up the series in that you can finally, clearly tell how much Derek loves Odette. It's similar to the first movie's resolution, but I find that to be a good thing.",4,"Good, but there are some kickers.",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2003,"['grew', 'up', 'Swan', 'Princess', 'movies', 'mixed', 'Disney', 'classics', 'few', 'other', 'here-and-there', 'animated', 'features', 'Thumbelina', 'Anastasia', 'Quest', 'Camelot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'aid', 'decision', ""'m"", 'more', 'less', 'going', 'be', 'giving', 'overview', 'actual', 'movie', 'rather', 'product', 'physical', 'piece.Okay', 'first', 'Swan', 'Princess', 'just', 'great', 'way', 'right', 'least', 'probably', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'here', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'Even', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'also', 'fairly', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'kick', 'whoever', 'let', 'happen', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'movie', 'love', 'Rogers', 'how', 'been', 'portrayed', 'first', 'even', 'second', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'dignified', 'good', 'guide', 'Derek', 'kinda', 'twisted', 'too', 'how', 'much', 'Bromley', 'hilarious', 'grows', 'even', 'funnier', 'get', 'older', 'understand', 'more', 'jokes', 'intentions', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'However', 'NOT', 'Rogers', 'see', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'beginning', 'once', 'character', 'named', 'Zelda', 'picture', 'Well', 'biggest', 'idiot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'beheld', 'NOT', 'good', 'way', 'woman', 'clearly', 'lacking', 'morality', 'very', 'reason', 'winning', 'affections', 'favor', 'shock', 'who', 'thought', 'Rogers', 'had', 'dignity', 'absolute', 'fool', 'results', 'huge', 'slipup', 'security', 'musical', 'number', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'main', 'issue', 'third', 'movie', 'rest', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'honestly', 'really', 'ending', 'as', 'ambiguous', 'part', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'really', 'up', 'series', 'can', 'finally', 'clearly', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'Derek', 'Odette', 'similar', 'first', 'movie', 'resolution', 'find', 'be', 'good', 'thing']",N/A
