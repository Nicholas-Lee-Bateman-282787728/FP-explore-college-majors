What really surprised me was that it was filmed only 2 miles from where I was raised in  New Salem State Park between Springfield and Petersburg, Illinois.  Abraham Lincoln worked at the post office at New Salem.  AS children we used to go to the park to walk the trails and go through the cabins.  That was over 50 years ago.  It was fun seeing all those things over again.When I was a child we went to Disneyland and they had a panoramic exhibit.  360 degree surround movie of -- you guessed it -- New Salem State Park.

1326957,A2DMEQZ2TTGZ34,B00362GK6C,A. parry,"[2, 2]","""The Awakening Land"" happens to be a late 70's mini series based upon Conrad Richter's book trilogy. The story illustrates a frontier style tale, showing a group of settlers moving to the very rural Ohio Valley in the late 1700's, and ultimately developing a thriving town and region well into the mid 1800's. The story is excellent at showing the viewer the transformation and progression of the individual characters, as well as the overall development of the Ohio area. The production quality of this mini series is very high, with excellent casting, great acting, and spectacular filming locations to match the wonderful cinematography. The pacing for this mini series is not particularly ""slow"" or ""fast"", just very steady and even keeled.Just Great!!!The DVD set offered by Warner Archive Collection is of excellent quality. The five and a half hour mini series is segmented into 3 parts, with one part on each of the 3 discs. Each disc opens with a short descriptive advertisement about the Warner Archive Collection, and then advances to the most simplistic ""menu"" screen you will ever see on a DVD, with basically one option offered, to ""play"" the DVD content (no chapter menu, setup, etc). The simplicity of the DVD's happens to be more than made up for with an excellent 16:9 (1.77 to 1) picture quality, smooth playback, and crisp/clear audio with adequate volume. Segments (discs) number 1 and 2 each have a runtime of approximately one hour and forty minutes, with the 3rd segment (disc) running longer at approximately 2 hours and fifteen minutes. The total runtime for the mini series is just over five and a half hours.When played using a nice upscaling player, and viewed on a decent quality HDTV, the overall picture quality is probably an ""8"" out of 10. While there happen to be a few very brief scenes showing dust or light artifacts in the print, it is extremely minimal (hardly noticed). The contrast is excellent, the colors are strong, and the clarity is very nice. The audio soundtrack is fairly simple, but does offer crisp and clear sound without any noticed concerns. Overall, the viewing experience is very enjoyable, even beyond the subject matter.A well crafted story, the well known and very effective primary cast, quality acting by the supporting cast, scenic filming locations, and cinematography techniques, all greatly enhance the entertainment value of this 3 disc, 3 part, 5.5 hour, late 1970's mini series.Watching this series happens to be a great way to spend a ""rainy"" Saturday or Sunday.""The Awakening Land"" is definitely worthy of your time.Hope this helps, . . .

It was filmed at least partially in central Illinois, so i got a kick watching some of the actors who I know including one of my college professors. If you pay attention you'll spot actor William H.

She certainly has more substance as an actor to her than ""Bewitched"" revealed! It was interesting to see a young Jane Seymour and Wm H Macey. Hal Holbrook as Portius was excellent as well. Like one reviewer said, this story lingers in my mind, actually is haunting. What courageous, hard-working people they were, these early settlers. They are the ones that created what became our cities and towns. I honor them. As in society in general there were the opposite type characters, as portrayed. I only take issue with the author and/or producer portraying the people that moved westward of that era as ignorant. It's my understanding that the colonials made sure all children were educated and in that day and time children received a classical education; read the great philosophers, had an extensive vocabulary, etc. It's possible people expanding westward over a period of time became unlearned but it seems reasonable to expect mothers taught their children when there was no established school.

1326987,A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,B00362GK6C,Michelle R,"[160, 166]","I first saw this about 30 years ago, when it was originally broadcast. I saw once again the first part about 15 years ago, when it was shown again, but missed the rest due to a family crisis. I can honestly say the story stayed with me most of my life -- I was a kid the first time around. I very much wanted to own this, and kept watching for it to be available. In the meanwhile, I read the books it was based on:The Trees: First Book In Awakening Land Trilogy,Fields: Second Book In Awakening Land Trilogy, andThe Town: Third Book In Awakening Land Trilogy. The books are really quite good, particularly if the subject matter interests you, and I found myself reading one at work and crying. However, the books only made me want to see the series again.When it did become available -- through the Warner Brothers site and vendors here -- I jumped at the chance to purchase it and did a little happy dance. I told my husband about it, and cautioned him that it might be slightly cheesy. I said this because that happens sometimes with older shows -- you remember them one way and then cringe when you see them now. I really didn't want to be embarrassed and so I gave a preemptive, ""I could be imagining how good it was, but it's really special to me and so humor me. 'K? Thanks.""The story follows Sayward Luckett for several decades, beginning in the late 1700s as her family comes to and settles land in the Ohio Valley. We see her fight to keep her family together and  we see her marry a man because she's attracted to him, but also because he can provide an education for her future children. We see her go from a poor woman with little influence to the accidental founder of a town.Here's the thing: there ARE cheesy moments. The third part is noticeably weaker than the two proceeding parts too, but I'd still very much recommend this. This is worth a willing suspension of disbelief in pretending the very much middle-aged Elizabeth Montgomery is a young girl at the beginning. She does a terrific job playing Sayward, a very admirable and strong character, and I can't imagine a more age-appropriate actress doing better. You care about this woman and you ache for her when tragedy strikes.Hal Holbrook also does a terrific job at the educated Portius Wheeler. Of course, the actor has made a career out of playing smart people, but this role allows him to also play a man who does some unlikable things, but remains likable. He has terrific chemistry with Elizabeth Montgomery.Also, look for a young and gorgeous Jane Seymour. The accent is a little iffy though. :) Oh, and a baby-faced William H. Macy.While all three parts are worth watching, much of the third episode is vaguely like the TV series of Little House on The Prairie (as opposed to the Little House books.) Hey, I love LHOTP as much as the next person, more, but in this case it didn't meet the quality of the previous parts or focus on the characters we'd invested in; instead, much of the time over to the young son of Sayward and Portius. When I was a kid, I actually loved this part. Still, the ending brings it back to the solid writing and acting of the first two parts.I'm very glad I got the opportunity to see this once again and I hope that -- now that it's available on DVD -- it will find a new, appreciative audience. Even with somewhat dated production values, this makes me long for the days of the miniseries and having several hours to follow a really good story. (Don't forget that the books are terrific, too!)This is 5 stars from me, because it was powerful enough to stay with me for decades, because it showcases the talents of Elizabeth Montgomery -- who left us too soon -- and because it tells a terrific story, and because they really don't make 'em like that anymore.",5,Almost As Good As I'd Remembered.,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,3771,"['first', 'saw', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'saw', 'once', 'again', 'first', 'part', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'again', 'missed', 'rest', 'due', 'family', 'crisis', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'story', 'stayed', 'most', 'life', 'was', 'kid', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'own', 'kept', 'watching', 'be', 'available', 'meanwhile', 'read', 'books', 'was', 'based', 'Trees', 'First', 'Book', 'Awakening', 'Land', 'Trilogy', 'Fields', 'Second', 'Book', 'Awakening', 'Land', 'Trilogy', 'andThe', 'Town', 'Third', 'Book', 'Awakening', 'Land', 'Trilogy', 'books', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'subject', 'matter', 'interests', 'found', 'reading', 'one', 'work', 'crying', 'However', 'books', 'only', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'series', 'did', 'become', 'available', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'site', 'vendors', 'here', 'jumped', 'chance', 'purchase', 'did', 'little', 'happy', 'dance', 'told', 'husband', 'cautioned', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'said', 'sometimes', 'older', 'shows', 'remember', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'cringe', 'when', 'see', 'now', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'so', 'gave', 'preemptive', 'could', 'be', 'imagining', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'special', 'so', 'humor', 'K', 'Thanks', 'story', 'Sayward', 'Luckett', 'several', 'decades', 'beginning', 'late', '1700s', 'family', 'settles', 'land', 'Ohio', 'Valley', 'see', 'fight', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'see', 'marry', 'man', 'attracted', 'also', 'can', 'provide', 'education', 'future', 'children', 'see', 'go', 'poor', 'woman', 'little', 'influence', 'accidental', 'founder', 'thing', 'ARE', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'third', 'part', 'noticeably', 'weaker', 'two', 'proceeding', 'parts', 'too', ""'d"", 'still', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'pretending', 'very', 'much', 'middle-aged', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'young', 'girl', 'beginning', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'Sayward', 'very', 'admirable', 'strong', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'actress', 'doing', 'better', 'care', 'woman', 'ache', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes.Hal', 'Holbrook', 'also', 'terrific', 'job', 'educated', 'Portius', 'Wheeler', 'course', 'actor', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'smart', 'people', 'role', 'also', 'play', 'man', 'who', 'unlikable', 'things', 'likable', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery.Also', 'look', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'accent', 'little', 'iffy', 'Oh', 'baby-faced', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy.While', 'three', 'parts', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'much', 'third', 'episode', 'vaguely', 'TV', 'series', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'opposed', 'Little', 'House', 'books', 'Hey', 'love', 'LHOTP', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'more', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'quality', 'previous', 'parts', 'focus', 'characters', ""'d"", 'invested', 'instead', 'much', 'time', 'young', 'son', 'Sayward', 'Portius', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'actually', 'loved', 'part', 'Still', 'ending', 'brings', 'back', 'solid', 'writing', 'acting', 'first', 'two', 'parts.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'once', 'again', 'hope', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'new', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'Even', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'production', 'values', 'long', 'days', 'miniseries', 'having', 'several', 'hours', 'follow', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'books', 'are', 'terrific', 'too', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'stay', 'decades', 'talents', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'left', 'too', 'soon', 'terrific', 'story', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'anymore']",N/A
