What was really stupid in the season 2 case they talk about the song Boz Busters and It's not on the DVD The song that replaced Boz Busters sounds way to modern for an 80s show.

Riptide is not my favorite show nor have I seen it since I was a kid.  However, a 2.5 season mid-'80s detective action comedy is not without its charm, and is begging to be revisited.  If you're checking out this page, you're already interested in the show and want to know ABOUT THE DVDS, PERIOD.  So here goes: The set is presented in three amaray DVD cases (one for each season).  The artwork on the cases is identical to the individual season sets and enclosed in a thin cardboard slipcase with cover artwork seen on this amazon page.  My slipcase arrived with some dents but still looks nice on my shelf between The Ring Two and Road to Perdition.  If I ever change my mind, I can ditch the slipcase and the amarays still look really nice on their own, side-by-side.  This is the better buy over the season sets, because you're not losing anything and you're saving space.  Don't worry about the DVDs themselves: I surmise they're the same ones from the season sets (yes, the 5 discs each for seasons 2 and 3 do fit nicely into one amaray).  I threw in the first couple of discs and thought the image was very nice -- about as nice as you can expect for a 25 year-old show.  The only reason I'm not giving the set 5 stars is for some unforeseen irregularity I may encounter as I watch it.  No extras here, which is negligible for a forgotten ""gem"" which can be purchased in its entirety.  Who needs extras? -- This is an entire TV series to watch at your leisure.

This is one of those shows where you can lose yourself for an hour with a fast-paced, action filled adventure. The comraderie between the characters is nice to see and the stories are cool. This is one series which does not take iteself too seriously and actually that is a good thing in that it allows you to enjoy the show, laugh and feel good. I liked the show when I saw it in the '80s and still like the show now.
