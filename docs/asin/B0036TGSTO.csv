1328733,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0036TGSTO,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","THE YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF is a very quiet, small film that depends on dialogue rather than action. It began as a short story by Pete Hamill and was adapted for the screen by Erin Dignam.  As directed with quiet intensity by Indian director Udayan Prasad the film is more an exploration of isolated individuals who for different reasons do not fit into society and how four of those individuals discover themselves through their interaction with each other.Brett Hanson (William Hurt) is discharged form prison where he has served six years for manslaughter: he has a history of run-ins with the law and seems to face his release with a certain degree of fear of the outside world.  He meets two youngsters - the lonely Martine (Kristen Stewart) who has only a father and an absent one at that,  and Gordy (Eddie Redmayne), a Native American asocial misfit itinerant - and because of a sever rain storm the three set out in Gordy's car to find shelter.  They stay in motels and gradually each characters past unfolds: the running development is Brett's history of coming close to a significant relationship with a fearful woman named May (Maria Bello) whose fear of relationships was temporarily resolved with her romance with Brett - all of this history is played through flashback scenes when Brett was working oil rigs in New Orleans.  Martine and Gordy are fascinated and a bit fearful of Brett as an ex-con but they both connect with Brett's essentially good spirit and insist that he stay with them and allow the bonding youngsters t help him recover the one love he had.Two generations of lost people collide then bond and learn from each other.  There is considerable emotional energy in this somewhat laconic film with as much being discovered by silences as with dialogue.  William Hurt offers a profoundly understated performance: Stewart and Redmayne provide the perfect nave foil for his reconnection with the world outside prison walls - both the physical prison he has just left and the mental prison in which he has been hiding all his life.  Maria Bello is convincing as the strong woman who fears vulnerability while desperately in need of being loved.  This is a film that may not have made it in theaters but is probably best viewed in the intimacy of the home via DVD.

It made it to a few festivals in 2008, a few more in 2009 and finally hit a few theaters (not DFW as I recall) in 2010.  The story involves 3 lonely misfits looking for happiness and an identity.  William Hurt is Brett, an ex-con just released from prison. He had caused the accidental death of a man who was trying to pull him away from pinning Brett's wife (Maria Bellow) to a wall.  Rather than fight the charge he spends 6 years in prison, feeling guilty not only for the death but the circumstances that caused it.  Without transportation he finds a ride with a young couple who just met.An excellent 17 year old Kristen Stewart plays 15 year old Martine who is clearly looking for attention feeling like nothing more than wallpaper.  Eddie Redmayne plays Gordy, a loud, somewhat obnoxious teen who's on his way to nowhere in his 70ish Ford Galaxy 500 convertible.  He has eyes for Martine and she agrees to go with him but only if Brett goes too.  Yeah, me neither.  In any case, the movie is a slow moving journey from somewhere in Louisiana to New Orleans.  During the trip, the unlikely trio begins to gel with a minimum of dialog getting in the way.  The ultimate goal is to reunite Brett with his wife.  I was happy to see few out-of-left-field obstacles put in their way other than the usual car trouble, lack of money and internal bickering.

With that perspective in mind movies and books are typically structured in one of two ways.  In the first way the meaning and purpose is linear, very apparent how it adds to the plot development as each word is spoken or read.  In the second way though the meaning and purpose is hidden but will be revealed slowly and with impact when the timing is right.  The Yellow Handkerchief fits the second process.Without giving anything away, and as others have stated in their reviews, three strangers end up on a serendipitous road trip.  Each character is massively insecure, unable to find acceptance from others because they are unable to accept who they are as individuals, yet each character is starving for acceptance and love for exactly who they are.  Their road trip is a journey of slow revelation and painful acceptance, one which they each fight in their own way and eventually embrace with unforgetable impact.I've been a long-time fan of William Hurt, but I've never seen him act at the incredible level he demonstrates in The Yellow Handkerchief. Maria Bello's character battles her own familiar insecurities in the movie.  The example of her art was equal and complementary to Hurt. Eddie Redmayne was perfectly cast.  Kristen Stewart's role was probably the best of her career so far.The Yellow Handkerchief is slow but exceptional.

I grew up watching old movies on tv and love films that depend on character development, dialogue, and good actors. This film filled these criteria well.I was especially intrigued by Eddie Redmayne. I had seen him in BirdsongMasterpiece Classic: Birdsongand he didn't overly impress me, but he really excelled in this part.  He plays the goofy young man so effectively.  He immersed himself in his portrayal of Gordy so much you would never guess that he was educated at Eton and Cambridge.The other two primary actors were very also good. William Hurt always performs to a high standard.  I found his protrayal of Brett to be sensitive, compassionate and strong.  And no other actress plays the conflicted young woman as well as Kristen Stewart.It's unfortunate that this film isn't better known.

The group consists of a 15 year-old girl (Kristen Stewart), a geeky teen who wants to be her boyfriend (Eddie Redmayne) and a mysterious older man (William Hurt) whom the other two learn more and more about. A fourth character is the woman the Hurt character loves (Maria Bello).This is a small indie film with quality actors and a story about love and redemption that smacks of real life and leaves you with a good feeling.
