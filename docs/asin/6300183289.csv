The movie smells low budget but what makes it bad is a silly screenplay and directing like in an amateur movie. It also has some bad acting. Pia Zadora isn't capable of making a believable portrayal of the the heroine, Jerilee (who could with this screenplay?), but she is really charming and on a camp level, her performance is wonderful.This is a pretty bad movie, but it's also very entertaining. Everybody who likes campy movies, like I do, should own a copy of this movie. I've seen it three times in six months without getting the least bored.

The story centers around a busty blonde played by the legendary (yes, legendary) Pia Zadora, who wants to make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter.  Her path to there is a no holds barred, sexually charged, unintentionally funny, so bad it's so good, jaw dropping extravaganza you'll be glad to witness.  Zadora literally throws herself in the main title role.  One can even glimpse at a talented actress behind her many over-the-top fits.  As for the script, well, there isn't any--just a sew-on take of its star in different states of undress who, in between stages, delivers such howlers as ""if I write for anyone, Vinny, I write for ME!"".  The powers that be at Universal who, needless to say, have the rights to this gem, should really swallow their pride and release it on DVD (with outtakes and commentaries, of course). Can't they see they have a definite camp classic in their hands ?-----Martin Boucher",5,THE CROWD PLEASER,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,1012,"['What', 'bad', 'bad', 'movie', 'THE', 'LONELY', 'LADY', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'adaptation', 'stops', 'story', 'centers', 'busty', 'blonde', 'played', 'legendary', 'yes', 'legendary', 'Pia', 'Zadora', 'who', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'path', 'barred', 'sexually', 'charged', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'good', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'extravaganza', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'witness', 'Zadora', 'literally', 'main', 'title', 'role', 'One', 'can', 'even', 'glimpse', 'talented', 'actress', 'many', 'over-the-top', 'fits', 'script', 'well', ""n't"", 'just', 'sew-on', 'take', 'star', 'different', 'states', 'undress', 'who', 'stages', 'delivers', 'such', 'howlers', 'write', 'anyone', 'Vinny', 'write', 'ME', 'powers', 'be', 'Universal', 'who', 'needless', 'say', 'have', 'rights', 'gem', 'should', 'really', 'swallow', 'pride', 'release', 'DVD', 'outtakes', 'commentaries', 'course', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'have', 'definite', 'camp', 'classic', 'hands', 'Boucher']",N/A

I seemed to always catch it playing on TV and couldn't stop watching it.  Recently, I saw it on TV, and figured I might as well buy it on video since I like it so much.  The copies I purchased here in Canada from a record store were awful, and was I able to find a clean playing copy that was new on the internet.  It's basically about an up & coming writer that sleeps here way to the top and meets a lot of unscrupulous people along the way.  It's a drive-in movie through & through.  Lots of nudity, violence, and a really lame script, but it has a certain charm that I can't put my finger on.

202990,A207IYGZTAF0DS,6300183289,NoWireHangers,"[1, 2]","""The Lonely Lady"" is that type of terribly misguided attempt at serious drama that ended up being a trashy soap opera. It's about as campy as it gets, and if you like that kind of movies, you will most likely love ""The Lonely Lady"". Pia Zadora is cute and innocent as always. She has often been ridiculed for her supposed lack of talent, but she has a certain charm and I doubt that many actresses could play this part, with all of it's cheesy dialogue, in a very believable way. She and the rest of the cast try their best, but because of the material they have to work with, they all end up laughable, just the way you like it when watching a campy movie like this.Don't expect this to be a great movie, but if you are looking for something campy and unintentionally funny, this just might be your perfect choise. It's one of my favorite guilty pleasures and I really hope it will be released on DVD soon.

Definitely a period peice.The characters are so two dimensional, it's almost like watching lip-syncing cardboard manikins. Pia Zadora's squirrelly acting style is particularly amusing. The storyline is sort of nonexistent.So Martha S. says here's what to do in order to make this occasion a cheery holiday funfest: Have a low-rent party!!! All you have to do is make a batch of fruit punch and spike it with MD 20/20 or some other cheap wine; Whip up some Hors Deuvers made of Ritz crackers, Spam and Cheez Whiz.
