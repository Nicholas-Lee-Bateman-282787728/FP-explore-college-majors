Simple things-- going back and forth between the pilot and another crew member in a dive while in the window is another bomber calming flying along side.  His wife sitting calmly at home knitting in the living room in 5 inch high heels - what!  What bravery and courage, his bad calls got everyone else killed.  Sorry, I love a good war story but this had way too much wrong with it.  No emotion to it.

Loads of aerial combat action. Computer graphics are used for most of the aerial views.No female love plots or anti war stuff. Just a well made war movie like the ones produced right after ww2.It is a survival story of an south African aviator in the RAF during the war. The view point is south African, very much like the American point of view. Very different from the British movies where the war is just a negative thing and they must just carry on and endure the hardships, with very bad endings,",5,South african produced movie- great,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,610,"['like', 'B24', 'bombers', 'movie', 'bombing', 'run', 'Germany', 'lots', 'Bomber', 'German', 'fighters', 'Loads', 'aerial', 'combat', 'action', 'Computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'used', 'most', 'aerial', 'views.No', 'female', 'love', 'plots', 'anti', 'war', 'stuff', 'Just', 'well', 'made', 'war', 'movie', 'ones', 'produced', 'right', 'ww2.It', 'survival', 'story', 'south', 'African', 'aviator', 'RAF', 'war', 'view', 'point', 'south', 'African', 'very', 'much', 'American', 'point', 'view', 'Very', 'different', 'British', 'movies', 'where', 'war', 'just', 'negative', 'thing', 'must', 'just', 'carry', 'endure', 'hardships', 'very', 'bad', 'endings']",Angel of the Skies

I can tolerate a historical movie with a so-so storyline, but I abhor shoddy realism in the same.  The opening scene depicts an ME109 and a Spitfire in a dogfight over the English Channel in September of 1940.  The Spitfire displays the Sky Grey I.D. band around the fuselage ahead of the tail. This band wasn't applied until well after the Battle of the Britain when the RAF began flying raids over the France Coast.  Also, the wing and fuselage roundels are all wrong.  The movie poster and DVD cover shows a B-17, but the movie characters are flying in a B-24.  And about that B-24, no British Squadron flew a B-24 on bombing raids in 1944.  The RAF regulated the B-24 to maritime Coastal Command duties.  A gross oversight indeed.  The climatic air battle that brought the &#34;Angel&#34; down had ME109's as the only combatant.  That's okay, but these ME's were the &#34;E&#34; variant and they were painted in late 1939-1940 camouflage.  &#34;E's&#34; were not in service by 1944.  After the &#34;Angel&#34; crashed, an RAF officer was at the door of Kirk's house to tell his wife that his plane had not returned.  Following the movies storyline, this was happening as the crew was trying to save the life of one of their own immediately after the crash.  I doubt that any planes from the raid had yet return from the mission at that point.  Well, that was enough for me.  I shut-off the movie and felt cheated out what could have been a pretty good film.",1,"Full of inaccuracies, mediocre storyline.",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1579,"['Judging', 'low', 'reviews', 'film', 'has/still', 'getting', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'determine', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'tolerate', 'historical', 'movie', 'so-so', 'storyline', 'abhor', 'shoddy', 'realism', 'same', 'opening', 'scene', 'ME109', 'Spitfire', 'dogfight', 'English', 'Channel', 'September', '1940', 'Spitfire', 'Sky', 'Grey', 'I.D', 'band', 'fuselage', 'ahead', 'tail', 'band', 'was', ""n't"", 'applied', 'well', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'when', 'RAF', 'began', 'flying', 'raids', 'France', 'Coast', 'Also', 'wing', 'fuselage', 'roundels', 'are', 'wrong', 'movie', 'poster', 'DVD', 'cover', 'B-17', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'flying', 'B-24', 'B-24', 'British', 'Squadron', 'flew', 'B-24', 'bombing', 'raids', '1944', 'RAF', 'regulated', 'B-24', 'maritime', 'Coastal', 'Command', 'duties', 'gross', 'oversight', 'indeed', 'climatic', 'air', 'battle', 'brought', '34', 'Angel', '34', 'down', 'had', 'ME109', 'only', 'combatant', 'okay', 'ME', 'were', '34', 'E', '34', 'variant', 'were', 'painted', 'late', '1939-1940', 'camouflage', '34', 'E', '34', 'were', 'not', 'service', '1944', '34', 'Angel', '34', 'crashed', 'RAF', 'officer', 'was', 'door', 'Kirk', 'house', 'tell', 'wife', 'plane', 'had', 'not', 'returned', 'Following', 'movies', 'storyline', 'was', 'happening', 'crew', 'was', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'one', 'own', 'immediately', 'crash', 'doubt', 'planes', 'raid', 'had', 'yet', 'return', 'mission', 'point', 'Well', 'was', 'enough', 'shut-off', 'movie', 'felt', 'cheated', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'film']",Angel of the Skies

1670750,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00F947S20,Tommy Dooley,"[11, 11]","This is a South African made film about some of the former colonies men who volunteered their services to fight for Britain at the hour of her greatest need in the dark days of World War 2. Meet Captain Kirk (yes he is really called that) played by Nicholas Van Der Bijl, in a performance of varying degrees. He leads a motley crew of his fellow countrymen who use such vocabulary as &#8216;cheerio&#8217; and &#8216;filly&#8217; in reference to ladies. Anyway they are fighting for RAF, Bomber Command and have to go and bomb the bejesus out of Germany etc.Well whilst over Germany they get shot and have to make an emergency landing and then decide to battle their way back to France and the safety of the British lines, this is set late in the war and Operation Overlord has already taken place so we are well past D Day. What happens next is the story of their journey.Right, for war film buffs there are a few things wrong with this film, first off the planes are al CGI, which is not a problem as they are all done really well even the Mescherschmitts, with props that look real and proper smoke etc so well done there. Problem is these guys are flying during the day. By this stage of the war the USAAF were doing the daylight runs and the RAF were doing the night runs. And they had fighter escort in the latter stages when this is set and there are none here. They are also flying Liberators which were never deployed to bomb Bremen by the RAF as depicted here. Now you are doing CGI so you could have got a Lancaster or a Wellington even, but still never mind.The acting is all quite good and the love interest in the shape of Kirky&#8217;s beloved in good if underplayed Lillie Claire as the neglected and dutiful lover is actually really convincing. This does have its moments and is far from being a bad movie, but factual errors really annoy some people and it is not a real full on &#8216;action fest&#8217; especially once the plane goes splat, but I still found a lot to actually like here, hence the rating. If factual errors annoy you then best to avoid, and it was  released as &#8216;Battle for the skies&#8217; in the UK for some strange reason, at least it retains its proper title in the US.",3,South African WW2 Effort,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2215,"['South', 'African', 'made', 'film', 'former', 'colonies', 'men', 'who', 'volunteered', 'services', 'fight', 'Britain', 'hour', 'greatest', 'need', 'dark', 'days', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Meet', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'yes', 'really', 'called', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Der', 'Bijl', 'performance', 'varying', 'degrees', 'motley', 'crew', 'fellow', 'countrymen', 'who', 'use', 'such', 'vocabulary', '8216', 'cheerio', '8217', '8216', 'filly', '8217', 'reference', 'ladies', 'are', 'fighting', 'RAF', 'Bomber', 'Command', 'have', 'go', 'bomb', 'bejesus', 'Germany', 'etc.Well', 'whilst', 'Germany', 'get', 'shot', 'have', 'make', 'emergency', 'landing', 'then', 'decide', 'battle', 'way', 'back', 'France', 'safety', 'British', 'lines', 'set', 'late', 'war', 'Operation', 'Overlord', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'are', 'well', 'past', 'D', 'Day', 'What', 'next', 'story', 'journey.Right', 'war', 'film', 'buffs', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'wrong', 'film', 'first', 'planes', 'are', 'al', 'CGI', 'not', 'problem', 'are', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'even', 'Mescherschmitts', 'props', 'look', 'real', 'proper', 'smoke', 'etc', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'there', 'Problem', 'guys', 'are', 'flying', 'day', 'stage', 'war', 'USAAF', 'were', 'doing', 'daylight', 'runs', 'RAF', 'were', 'doing', 'night', 'had', 'fighter', 'escort', 'latter', 'stages', 'when', 'set', 'are', 'none', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'flying', 'Liberators', 'were', 'never', 'deployed', 'bomb', 'Bremen', 'RAF', 'depicted', 'here', 'Now', 'are', 'doing', 'CGI', 'could', 'have', 'got', 'Lancaster', 'Wellington', 'even', 'still', 'never', 'mind.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'love', 'interest', 'shape', 'Kirky', '8217', 'beloved', 'good', 'underplayed', 'Lillie', 'Claire', 'neglected', 'dutiful', 'lover', 'actually', 'really', 'convincing', 'have', 'moments', 'far', 'being', 'bad', 'movie', 'factual', 'errors', 'really', 'annoy', 'people', 'not', 'real', 'full', '8216', 'action', 'fest', '8217', 'especially', 'plane', 'splat', 'still', 'found', 'lot', 'actually', 'here', 'hence', 'rating', 'factual', 'errors', 'annoy', 'then', 'best', 'avoid', 'was', 'released', '8216', 'Battle', 'skies', '8217', 'UK', 'strange', 'reason', 'least', 'proper', 'title', 'US']",Angel of the Skies
