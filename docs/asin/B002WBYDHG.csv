1296654,A5QZKZTG3ME0M,B002WBYDHG,Amazon Customer,"[7, 12]","I am totally disgusted with MILL CREEK for this dishonest release of the exact same set but in a different box.  No where does it give titles of episodes.  All they have done is release the same 4 disc set, this time in a cheap hard cover DVD case instead of their cheap cardboard box they used in the initial release. I also blame Amazon for not giving a better description so we would not have been suckered into to buying the same set twice.  Why couldn't MILL CREEK have just selected another 30 episodes out of the hundreds that were broadcast???????",1,BEST OF MATCH GAME: 30 EPISODES,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,555,"['am', 'totally', 'disgusted', 'MILL', 'CREEK', 'dishonest', 'release', 'exact', 'same', 'set', 'different', 'box', 'where', 'give', 'titles', 'episodes', 'have', 'done', 'release', 'same', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'time', 'cheap', 'hard', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case', 'instead', 'cheap', 'cardboard', 'box', 'used', 'initial', 'release', 'also', 'blame', 'Amazon', 'not', 'giving', 'better', 'description', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'suckered', 'buying', 'same', 'set', 'twice', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'MILL', 'CREEK', 'have', 'just', 'selected', '30', 'episodes', 'hundreds', 'were', 'broadcast']",N/A

1296659,A32EEGACSPIPI0,B002WBYDHG,Kimberly,"[33, 34]","For some reason Amazon is taking the reviews for ""The Dumb Dora Edition"" which is only one disc and placing them on this product. This version is a reprint of the old ""Best of Match Game"" set which went out of print. The content of the old set & this set is exactly the same. So if you already have the old Best of Match Game set there is nothing new here. However for those who didn't buy the old set it's nice to see this in print again.I only gave the product 4 stars because I don't necessarily think the episodes picked are ""the best"" of Match Game. It seems when picking episodes they went with what famous celebrity was on the panel instead of really funny/memorable moments in many cases. I also think there are too many episodes before Brett & Charles joined in 1973 and then too many episodes after Richard left in 1978. Personally the best for me would be when Brett, Charles, & Richard were all on the panel.However there are still some great episodes on this set like the famous ""School Riot"" episode and the episode when Richard & Fannie pretend to be Brett & Charles. The set also contains the three episodes that Kirstie Alley appears as a contestant which might be interesting to some fans. Not to mention best episodes or not it's great to be able to watch full episodes of Match Game that are not edited by GSN to add in more commercials and credit crunches.",4,This is Not a One Disc Set,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,1377,"['reason', 'Amazon', 'taking', 'reviews', 'Dumb', 'Dora', 'Edition', 'only', 'one', 'disc', 'placing', 'product', 'version', 'reprint', 'old', 'Best', 'Match', 'Game', 'set', 'went', 'print', 'content', 'old', 'set', 'set', 'exactly', 'same', 'So', 'already', 'have', 'old', 'Best', 'Match', 'Game', 'set', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'However', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'old', 'set', 'nice', 'see', 'print', 'again.I', 'only', 'gave', 'product', '4', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'episodes', 'picked', 'are', 'best', 'Match', 'Game', 'when', 'picking', 'episodes', 'went', 'what', 'famous', 'celebrity', 'was', 'panel', 'instead', 'really', 'funny/memorable', 'moments', 'many', 'cases', 'also', 'think', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'Brett', 'Charles', 'joined', '1973', 'then', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'Richard', 'left', '1978', 'Personally', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'Brett', 'Charles', 'Richard', 'were', 'panel.However', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'episodes', 'set', 'famous', 'School', 'Riot', 'episode', 'episode', 'when', 'Richard', 'Fannie', 'pretend', 'be', 'Brett', 'Charles', 'set', 'also', 'three', 'episodes', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'contestant', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'fans', 'Not', 'mention', 'best', 'episodes', 'not', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'full', 'episodes', 'Match', 'Game', 'are', 'not', 'edited', 'GSN', 'add', 'more', 'commercials', 'credit', 'crunches']",N/A

I only gave it 4 stars because although I liked it,I don't feel it was the ""best of"". It seemed like some random episodes thrown together. I think the people who put this together didn't put enough thought into it or just used what was available ? I liked it because this is the only video of Match Game I was able to find and it was fun to relive those old moments. It would be nice if they could produce a proper collection of this and other classic game shows !? I have mixed emotions on this one. When I purchased this it was $4 and it was worth the price I paid just to see it,but if I truly wanted the ""best of"",I would have been disappointed.

1296662,AOJ691J3ZW3NK,B002WBYDHG,Nicholas R. Patti,"[3, 3]","I am so glad that I chose to purchase this video disc title. Match Game provides a vast amount of entertainment for citizens in any age group. The program was on the air originally shortly before my time but it still lights a spark with me nonetheless. Gene Rayburn (who passed away during my senior year in high school) was a top-notch terrific host for this elaborate game show. I must also say that the creators and producers made a wise decision when they made Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly regular panelists. All thirty selected episodes are well-worth viewing with all of the original fee plugs intact! The four-disc box set contains some decent extras as well.What I like most about Match Game: the lovable and beautiful female celebrity panelists. Brett Somers, Betty White, Loretta Swit, Fannie Flagg, Phyllis Davis, Debralee Scott, Elaine Joyce, Jamie Lee Curtis, Patti Deutsch, and Joyce Bulifant all have sweet, pleasant faces that make me glow with tremendous joy! One included program here shows a male contestant giving Debralee Scott a good, warm hug during the bonus round segment as a result of her providing his chosen answer which turned out to be the one worth the most money!
