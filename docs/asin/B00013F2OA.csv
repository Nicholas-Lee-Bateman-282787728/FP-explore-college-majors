This is a movie about America looking good in the publics eye, in this case it was within the realm of a government agency, I think it was the C.I.A, don't really remember, but, neway, its the ol' grand routine of promoting a black man to meet some status requirement.  But, this A.A soon became a stab in the back to its promoters as the black man used his C.I.A training to incorporate recruited urbanites as weapons against the government.  As the last 20 minutes of the movie was nothing more than urban guerrilla warfare.................a good movie in what it represented for its time, just as ""Sweet backs bad ass song"" was.  highly reccomend",5,yo govie break yo self! lmao!,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,856,"['movie', 'fear', 'black', 'planet', 'lol', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'mostly', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'movies', 'shouldnt', 'have', 'went', 'far', 'grain', 'allowed', 'movie', 'America', 'looking', 'good', 'publics', 'eye', 'case', 'was', 'realm', 'government', 'agency', 'think', 'was', 'C.I.A', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'neway', 'ol', 'grand', 'routine', 'promoting', 'black', 'man', 'meet', 'status', 'requirement', 'A.A', 'soon', 'became', 'stab', 'back', 'promoters', 'black', 'man', 'used', 'C.I.A', 'training', 'incorporate', 'recruited', 'urbanites', 'weapons', 'government', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'urban', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', '..a', 'good', 'movie', 'what', 'represented', 'time', 'just', 'Sweet', 'backs', 'bad', 'ass', 'song', 'was', 'highly', 'reccomend']",N/A
792099,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B00013F2OA,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[8, 9]","(To begin, my choice of * * * reflects this particular cut... not the film itself...  But as the film has been long out of print, the fact that its out may very well warrent * * * * *... Read on...)In the late 60's/early 70's, the air was ripe with talk of revolution.White people too spoke of it... but in a different way.  a.k.a. ""The blacks are taking over!""This film is a dramatization of both the dream (or fantasy) and the nightmare...  And the idea of working within the system just enough to learn the ropes, then using it to your own good... (A play on the debate if taking advantage of the system makes one a sell out... a.k.a. Uncle Tom.)Conceptually speaking, that's what makes this film great...It is not a typical B-movie ""exploitation"" film with the revolutionaries being afro-wig wearing stereotypes, and the political content just being backdrop for the car chases... its a film with a message... To that extent its in a league of its own...In addition, the production values are surprisingly good... Though an underground film, the production values hold their ground... Its a very well crafted film... even to the point of being slick.  (The editor later went on to work for Steve Spielberg and is currently one of the top in his field.)So why do I give the film three stars...? I feel it drags at times... but there may very well be an excuse...  Incidental music (which is just as important as the visuals in any good film) is very important.  My assumption is that the company that released it couldn't get the rights, so the soundtrack had to be muted.  A shame because the original soundtrack was done by HERBIE HANCOCK (!) - - so what happens is you hear it faintly in the backround... at one point you even see a band playing and girl dancing, but you barely hear any music...  The end result... the film feels a bit empty and spacey... and in parts where the music would have complimented the scenery (and visa versa) it just feels like empty space... so the film drags...  The problem could probably easily be resolved by having one of today's ""acid Jazz"" bands provide a funky soundtrack in the same same style... but you have to be careful like that, because if the soundtrack is done cheaply, it diminishes the quality of the film... NO SOUNDTRACK however, makes it feel empty.That aside, there are a few wonderful suprises, including an interview with the author/director, who is as militant and outspoken as ever.  (Reminds me a bit of Melvin Van Peebles.)  - - Robert Townsend gives his thoughts on the film...  And there is plenty of hyping.In conclusion, the idea of guerillas learning their game from the CIA is very interesting in today's climate... because that's exactly what's happening now regarding the war on terrorism...  There is some irony though... when Kennedy was shot Malcolm X got into trouble for saying it was an example of ""the chickens coming home to roost"" - - On 9/11 the same thought came to my mind...  Yes, it was a terrible thing, but when you have a foreign policy and shake a bee's nest, you can't blame when the bees come out and sting you to death.  You can moralize that the bees were wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that you were stupid for provoking them.  In fact, if a nearby person gets stung, its the person who provoked the bees fault, not the bees themselves whether or not their behavior is ""right"" or ""wrong"" or whether they were ""right"" or ""wrong"" for building the hive... - - This film, then can be watched from two perspectives:  1)  As a fantasy that was very popular during that era.  2)  As a warning of what happens when people feel surpressed and frustrated.  Likewise, it is a play on every white bigot's worst nightmare:  The help banding together and going far beyond merely steeling the silverware.  (There is a very funny scene demonstrating this.)So * * * * * in concept...

He heads back to Chicago, adept now at pushing paperwork and, more importantly, making explosives, handling guns, and a wide range of other ""covert ops.""  Freeman maintains his air of respectability via his Social Service job.  However, his life outside of work includes organizing and leading an underground guerilla army, recruiting from the gangs with which he works.  ""You really want to mess with Whitey?  I can show you how.""Known on the street as Turk, Freeman's group could give Al-Qaeda a run for their money.  Freeman knows the ""rules"" and ""the game"" and he plays it expertly.  For example, when Freeman needs funds for his domestic terrorism operation, he asks the lightest skinned members to rob a bank, knowing that such a well organized group would be mistaken for white, leading authorities on a wild goose chase.  ""This took brains and guts, which we don't have, right?""An incendiary tale of revolution, SPOOK should have lit up the country--had it not been pulled from theaters almost immediately after release.  The film is as chilling now in an era where people jump at their shadows for fear of terrorists, as it must have been when it came out originally when cities still smoldered after the riots of the late `60s.  Only available for years via grey market dealers in a less-than-pristine video version, the DVD release of THE SPOOK WHO SAT BY THE DOOR has been given the deluxe treatment this must-see film deserves.",5,Re-released with nary a bang nor a whimper,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,1971,"['Re-released', 'bang', 'whimper', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'New', 'Millennium', 'Studios', 'early', '2004', 'THE', 'SPOOK', 'WHO', 'SAT', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOOR', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'important', 'films', '1970s', 'Based', 'novel', 'Sam', 'Greenlee', 'SPOOK', 'subversive', 'tale', 'Dan', 'Freeman', 'Lawrence', 'Cook', 'who', 'hired', 'CIA', 'token', 'Negro', 'political', 'tool', 'Senator', 'appeal', 'black', 'voters.Freeman', 'best', 'keep', 'head', 'low', 'nose', 'clean', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'CIA', 'tactics', 'possible', 'taking', 'leave', 'back', 'Chicago', 'adept', 'now', 'pushing', 'paperwork', 'more', 'importantly', 'making', 'explosives', 'handling', 'guns', 'wide', 'range', 'other', 'covert', 'ops', 'Freeman', 'air', 'respectability', 'Social', 'Service', 'job', 'However', 'life', 'work', 'organizing', 'leading', 'underground', 'guerilla', 'army', 'recruiting', 'gangs', 'really', 'want', 'mess', 'Whitey', 'can', 'show', 'how', 'Known', 'street', 'Turk', 'Freeman', 'group', 'could', 'give', 'Al-Qaeda', 'run', 'money', 'Freeman', 'rules', 'game', 'expertly', 'example', 'when', 'Freeman', 'funds', 'domestic', 'terrorism', 'operation', 'lightest', 'skinned', 'members', 'rob', 'bank', 'knowing', 'well', 'organized', 'group', 'would', 'be', 'mistaken', 'white', 'leading', 'authorities', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'took', 'brains', 'guts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'incendiary', 'tale', 'revolution', 'SPOOK', 'should', 'have', 'lit', 'up', 'country', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'pulled', 'theaters', 'almost', 'immediately', 'release', 'film', 'chilling', 'now', 'era', 'where', 'people', 'jump', 'shadows', 'fear', 'terrorists', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'originally', 'when', 'cities', 'still', 'smoldered', 'riots', 'late', '60s', 'Only', 'available', 'years', 'grey', 'market', 'dealers', 'less-than-pristine', 'video', 'version', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE', 'SPOOK', 'WHO', 'SAT', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOOR', 'been', 'given', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'must-see', 'film', 'deserves']",N/A

It is seriously lacking a commentary track, any subtitles, and is presented in full frame instead of letterbox.(UPDATE: The disc IS in widescreen, but is optimized for the newer widescreen TV sets, so you'll have to re-set your DVD player's output. Check the owner's manual.)But beggers can't be choosers, and I've been begging someone, ANYONE, to get a good quality print of this long-suppressed film onto DVD. And this DVD is made from the master negative that has been in a vault for over 30 years!After watching only pirated VHS copies and badly worn Canadian releases for so long, this film looks and sounds fresh and crisp.For those uninitiated to this film, or the book it is based upon,  here's a quick summary...A White U.S. Senator, looking to improve his standing among Black voters, sponsors a drive for the CIA to recruit Black agents. However, everyone is graded on a curve, so all are condemned to flunk...save for soft-spoken Dan Freeman. After going through grueling training in self-defence, guerilla warfare and underground operations, he is recruited to be a ""reproduction chief"" (he runs a photocopier in the sub-basement), and serves the CIA as a token Black employee (the term ""spook"" used here is both a racial slur, and a slang term for a spy).After 5 years, he leaves the CIA to work in his native Chicago for a social services agency...by day. By night, he's using his CIA training to teach a street gang to be the vanguard in an upcoming race war...Understandably, this film raised a lot of fears among Whites when released, and despite box office success, it vanished from distribution after only three weeks. The film-makers insist it was pressure on the film's distributors by the FBI and their COINTELPRO program against Black Nationalist groups.Long available only on bootleg video copies and screened only on college campuses, it became an underground classic. And now, it's legitimately available on DVD.The DVD includes the rarely seen coming attractions trailer and TV spot, as well as interviews with the book's author, Sam Greenlee (in his 70's and still as vocal as he ever was!) and film-maker Robert Townsend, who says that this film literally changed his life.Believe the hype!
