866391,A2O2PEZQ5CVVSZ,B0006FO8JI,Anonymous,"[7, 7]","My 2-year-old is constantly referring to his (invisible) ""star pocket"" because of this DVD. He watches this at least 3 times a week, and would watch it 4 times in a row if I let him!The Explorer Stars help Dora and Boots through 2 videos including ""Star Catcher"" and ""Star Mountain"". Both are excellent. In these videos, your child will learn Spanish names of vehicles and colors, learn how to count up to 15, and will get some excersice by reaching and jumping for stars and jumping over sharks!Special features include ""Dora's Star Catcher Game"" and ""Itsy Bitsy Spider Sing-Along"".This is a worthwhile investment for parents or grandparents of small children.
