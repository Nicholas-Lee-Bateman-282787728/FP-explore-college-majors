Shin,"[2, 3]","1.  ok, like everyone who is interested in the DVD, likes dixie dregs (an obvious statement).2.  thus, if you're interested in the dixie dregs and thus their music, this is not the DVD to get because the sound is subpar (ok, you're kind of expecting that because it was recorded in 1978) but beyond that, the overall mixing is completely terrible.  at times, you can hear steve morse and especially when he's soloing, you can barely hear the guitar.  yes, i did go into the menu system and try the two different audio settings--> no difference.3.  thus, yes, the dixie dregs put out some incredible music in their time.  but this DVD doesn't do them justice and in fact is a complete waste of time / money due to poor  sound quality.",1,"If you like music, then skip this DVD",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,733,"['1.', 'ok', 'everyone', 'who', 'interested', 'DVD', 'dixie', 'dregs', 'obvious', 'statement', 'thus', ""'re"", 'interested', 'dixie', 'dregs', 'thus', 'music', 'not', 'DVD', 'get', 'sound', 'subpar', 'ok', ""'re"", 'kind', 'expecting', 'was', 'recorded', '1978', 'overall', 'mixing', 'completely', 'terrible', 'times', 'can', 'hear', 'steve', 'morse', 'especially', 'when', 'soloing', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'guitar', 'yes', 'i', 'did', 'go', 'menu', 'system', 'try', 'two', 'different', 'audio', 'settings', 'difference.3', 'thus', 'yes', 'dixie', 'dregs', 'put', 'out', 'incredible', 'music', 'time', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'fact', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', '/', 'money', 'due', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality']",N/A
918415,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000A1IKHO,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","Read the 15 reviews prior to mine and you'll get a very accurate sense of this DVD.Strengths are that this is vintage footage of a great band in their prime, in front of an audience that appreciates them, plus the video and sound quality aren't bad, and the two 'extra' performances are a nice treat.  I love seeing these guys kicking serious ass when they were young, and watching this brings back happy memories for me.  Can't complain about the price of ten bucks either.But the negatives are there too.  Compared to the albums (I have them all), the volume level of the guitar is clearly too low, especially the solos, and often drowned out by the violin.  And visually, yes, this borders on The Allen Sloan Show, featuring him *way* out of proportion to the other band members.  If you know how the band worked, Steve Morse was indeed the leader of the band and its lead composer, yet we hardly even see his face in this footage, instead seeing him more from the back and side when we do get to see him.  Not being able to see his face during guitar solos is especially irksome and robs us of an important component of live performance.  Similarly, Andy West and Rod Morgenstein absolutely tear it up, yet we hardly see them either.  The camera guys and video editors obviously didn't know what they were doing, which is unfortunate.But enough with the negativity.  The strengths of this DVD are sufficient that, as a huge Dregs/Morse fan, I treasure this DVD and will continue to enjoy it, and I strongly recommend it to other fans as well.  Best to focus on the positives and see the glass half full in this case.",4,Flawed but still a must-have,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1620,"['Read', '15', 'reviews', 'prior', 'mine', ""'ll"", 'get', 'very', 'accurate', 'sense', 'DVD.Strengths', 'are', 'vintage', 'footage', 'great', 'band', 'prime', 'front', 'audience', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'two', ""'extra"", 'performances', 'are', 'nice', 'treat', 'love', 'seeing', 'guys', 'kicking', 'serious', 'ass', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'watching', 'back', 'happy', 'memories', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'price', 'ten', 'bucks', 'either.But', 'negatives', 'are', 'there', 'too', 'Compared', 'albums', 'have', 'volume', 'level', 'guitar', 'clearly', 'too', 'low', 'especially', 'solos', 'often', 'drowned', 'out', 'violin', 'visually', 'yes', 'borders', 'Allen', 'Sloan', 'Show', 'featuring', '*way*', 'proportion', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'know', 'how', 'band', 'worked', 'Steve', 'Morse', 'was', 'indeed', 'leader', 'band', 'lead', 'composer', 'yet', 'hardly', 'even', 'see', 'face', 'footage', 'instead', 'seeing', 'more', 'back', 'side', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'Not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'face', 'guitar', 'solos', 'especially', 'irksome', 'robs', 'important', 'component', 'live', 'performance', 'Similarly', 'Andy', 'West', 'Rod', 'Morgenstein', 'absolutely', 'tear', 'up', 'yet', 'hardly', 'see', 'camera', 'guys', 'video', 'editors', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'unfortunate.But', 'enough', 'negativity', 'strengths', 'DVD', 'are', 'sufficient', 'that', 'huge', 'Dregs/Morse', 'fan', 'treasure', 'DVD', 'will', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'other', 'fans', 'well', 'Best', 'focus', 'positives', 'see', 'glass', 'half', 'full', 'case']",N/A

Tarin ""EveryoneIsBlindnDeaf""","[3, 5]","Getting tired of tarded camera work, someone start a school for these people? make them all sit and watch Roger Waters In the Flesh, and Led Zep DVD set of 2003.  pure and simple.  stop blowing it!!!!!a let down because of the audio mix. Very violin heavy. You can barely hear the guitar on most songs even during the solos (with the exception of The Bash). I found this to be the same with the other Dregs DVD. This DVD is definitely the Alan Sloan show. It is almost comical how many times you see Steve's back in order to get a shot at Sloan playing. Even during the bass solo they cut to Sloan clapping his hands.

I was looking for something special to get him for Christmas this year and found this DVD on Amazon.  My husband's reaction was priceless.  He gives the DVD a resounding two thumbs up.  His only complaint, which is the same complaint he has with most music videos, is that when a particularly good guitar riff is happening, the camera is shooting somewhere else.  That irritates him so much!
