895114,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007Y8ABK,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 7]","In the world of documentaries, Tarnation ranks among one of the best that I have seen.  Sometimes with a low-budget outing it is hard to judge the quality of the final product, but Jonathan Caouette proves that he has a passion for the subject, a desire to tell his story and a know-how to bring his moments to life.  With bold music (that nearly grips your heart at every turn) and an Andy Warhol style of imagery, Caouette pulls us deep within his life and shows us his life unfiltered.  Using just his computer, he builds the story of his life using scenes taken from nineteen years in front (and behind) the camera.  It reminded me of Capturing the Friedmans, except with more heart and soul.  We are taken through a broad range of emotions which include fear, surprise, excitement, and distraught as we witness the decline of our narrator.  Tarnation is a man's bold expression to tell the story of his life, and for me, it worked wonders on my soul and mind.What makes Caouette's documentary impressive is that you sometimes forget that he is the one creating the masterpiece.  Since he is in front of the camera from a young age until thirty years later, it is easy for one to forget that he is creating these images for us.  I think that is important for us to remember because he places every snapshot, every audio, and every snippet of video in the film to show a purpose.  While we all can watch the film and derive our purpose or point about the film (which is what makes cinema amazing), I saw it as this very sad and vicious circle of life.  Mother lives with parents, who are mentally unstable, she eventually is that way as well, which then slowly translates onto her son.  It is a sad and destructive cycle that happens daily in America as well as around the world.  It is a central focus to many of our films and media, the idea that if you grow up in an environment of chaos, you will eventually create that same chaos years later.  It is a wild thought that can be visually seen in the film Tarnation.Outside of the broad range of emotions that were surging through me while I watched this riveting piece of art, there were some elements that I just thought were bold, creative, and extremely stylish.  I loved the use of words to tell the story.  Normally, in these documentaries you are forced to listen to that calming voice telling you what is happening, what did happen, and what will happen next.  In this film, Caouette uses the typed words to give us both that sensation of neutrality (and sometimes numbness) and to honestly focus our attention towards the images on screen.  There are times when the voiceover technique can become overpowering, and you begin to focus yourself onto the words of the narrator, instead of the events unfolding on screen.  With the typed words from Caouette, we focus on him, his mother, and the environment that is imploding around him.Also, the music.  One cannot talk about this film without mentioning the soundtrack to this film.  You know those moments where you need to express yourself and the only way that works is by making a mixed CD?  Well, this is Caouette's mixed CD.  The music choice for the film seemed to come from his heart, from his passion spawned this music.  Not only was I listening to some great songs for the first time, but this was just another avenue for me to understand Jonathan and the world in which he resides.  The music really help set the mood and tone for the entire film.  It helped build the tension and give us that raw human emotion that built the foundation to this movie.  Jonathan's mother was the main character of this film, then I would say that the music was the co-star.  This film would not have been as effective if it wasn't for the amazing sound choices.Finally, I would like to say that Caouette has built a masterpiece here.  He has taken a personal story and created more emotions and personality than most Hollywood big budget productions could have.  It was real.  This is something that Hollywood continues to strive for, but cannot quite reach it.  Caouette has, and I wouldn't be surprised if he did it again.  I think what I loved so much about this film is that it is another story about our world.  I don't think we see enough real-life stories about our neighbors and friends, but instead are bombarded with superficial heroes that are paid more money than we will ever see and somehow always win the perfect girl at the end.  Happiness is not always the ending to every story.Overall, I was impressed.  This was an outstanding film that deserves every bit of recognition that is handed to it.  Caouette has created a masterpiece and is changing with this film the face of documentaries.  I expect to see rip-offs of this popping up in the near future.  He inspires those of us who want to create our own stories to do so, and is a pioneer of the struggling filmmaker.  I suggest this film to all my friends and family, not just for the cinematic pleasure that is contained in it, but also because Caouette could be the modern day Warhol ... at least that is what I saw when I witnessed the power of this film.

The problem is that as interesting as we may be in our own stories, to everybody else they sound the same as everybody else's stories.  The magic of ""Tarnation,"" an impressive debut for Jonathan Caouette, is that he found a way to make us interested in his life story. That said a few things have to be granted. First, his life, more than likely, was more screwed up than yours. Secondly, he was lucky enough to have basically his entire life documented on film. However, it still took tons of ingenuity and talent to put together this film. With documentaries more so than fiction films, the magic is in the editing.  Here Caouette turns his life into a psychedelic music video.  The first half is more powerful than the second half as I was disturbed and creeped out. His video collage tells the story of his mother who fell on hard times and was the victim of very unfortunate circumstances.  It all leads up to a climax in which Caouette confronts his grandfather, a grandfather we are left throughout the film wondering why he is still hanging around.  Near the end of the film my list of questions and complaints was starting to mount a little.  Since it is not really a narrative it has no story arch to keep the film moving in forward motion, so by the end the film was beginning to drag. Also, some of the more recent footage did appear to be filmed simply for the sake of the movie he was making. It doesn't really damage the way the film works, it only cuts down on the organic feel it had going for it.  I also wondered if he was exploiting those around him for personal gain. I eventually came to the conclusion that no he was not. Those people were all involved in his life and thus were simply part of his life which he mined for his own personal reasons. It becomes even less offensive after you walk into a Charter 1 Bank and realize that the bank feels the need to mine the personal lives of their workers to make their bank feel more homey (My personal favorite ""Hi My Name is Michael and I'm Saving for a Sailboat"").In her recent review of ""10 on Ten"" Manohla Dargis said that the problem with digital video is that it has led to lots of people thinking they have something important to say when in reality they don't. However, after seeing this film I have to disagree with her. Why not open up film to the masses, the way writing and music already are? It's not as if bad films are going to magically get distribution in this country. A very good film like this one barely gets released at all (2 weeks total here in Detroit and spent at different theatres about 3 months apart). I would rather hear what the masses have to say than hear what the studio suits have to say anyways. And in this case Jonathan Caouette definitely had something to say. ***1/2",3,A Stunning Debut of Talent and Technique,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,2865,"['have', 'stories', 'tell', 'lives', 'want', 'people', 'hear', 'right', 'problem', 'as', 'interesting', 'may', 'be', 'own', 'stories', 'everybody', 'else', 'sound', 'same', 'everybody', 'else', 'stories', 'magic', 'Tarnation', 'impressive', 'debut', 'Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'interested', 'life', 'story', 'said', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'granted', 'First', 'life', 'more', 'likely', 'was', 'more', 'screwed', 'up', 'yours', 'Secondly', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'basically', 'entire', 'life', 'documented', 'film', 'However', 'still', 'took', 'tons', 'ingenuity', 'talent', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'documentaries', 'more', 'so', 'fiction', 'films', 'magic', 'editing', 'Here', 'Caouette', 'life', 'psychedelic', 'music', 'video', 'first', 'half', 'more', 'powerful', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'disturbed', 'creeped', 'out', 'video', 'collage', 'story', 'mother', 'who', 'fell', 'hard', 'times', 'was', 'victim', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'up', 'climax', 'Caouette', 'grandfather', 'grandfather', 'are', 'left', 'film', 'wondering', 'why', 'still', 'hanging', 'around', 'end', 'film', 'list', 'questions', 'complaints', 'was', 'starting', 'mount', 'little', 'not', 'really', 'narrative', 'story', 'arch', 'keep', 'film', 'moving', 'forward', 'motion', 'so', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'beginning', 'drag', 'Also', 'more', 'recent', 'footage', 'did', 'appear', 'be', 'filmed', 'simply', 'sake', 'movie', 'was', 'making', ""n't"", 'really', 'damage', 'way', 'film', 'only', 'down', 'organic', 'feel', 'had', 'going', 'also', 'wondered', 'was', 'exploiting', 'personal', 'gain', 'eventually', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'not', 'people', 'were', 'involved', 'life', 'thus', 'were', 'simply', 'part', 'life', 'mined', 'own', 'personal', 'reasons', 'even', 'less', 'offensive', 'walk', 'Charter', '1', 'Bank', 'realize', 'bank', 'need', 'mine', 'personal', 'lives', 'workers', 'make', 'bank', 'feel', 'more', 'homey', 'My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Hi', 'My', 'Name', 'Michael', ""'m"", 'Saving', 'Sailboat', '.In', 'recent', 'review', '10', 'Ten', 'Manohla', 'Dargis', 'said', 'problem', 'digital', 'video', 'led', 'lots', 'people', 'thinking', 'have', 'something', 'important', 'say', 'when', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'However', 'seeing', 'film', 'have', 'disagree', 'Why', 'not', 'open', 'up', 'film', 'masses', 'way', 'writing', 'music', 'already', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'films', 'are', 'going', 'magically', 'get', 'distribution', 'country', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'barely', 'released', '2', 'weeks', 'total', 'here', 'Detroit', 'spent', 'different', 'theatres', '3', 'months', 'apart', 'would', 'rather', 'hear', 'what', 'masses', 'have', 'say', 'hear', 'what', 'studio', 'suits', 'have', 'say', 'anyways', 'case', 'Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'definitely', 'had', 'something', 'say', '***1/2']",Tarnation

How and why that tragic falsehood got perpetuated in his horribly dysfunctional family is the subject of Jonathan Caouette's intense, emotionally raw, and deeply sad autobiographical documentary. His mother Renee--for all her madness, mental illness, 200 shock therapy treatments as a child, drug abuse, rape, and over a hundred psychiatric hospitalizations from 1965 to 1999, knows better: ""Screwed up parents raise screwed up kids. I just wanted to break the cycle."" She did not and could not, and her son Jonathan, writer and director, has paid a horrible psychic price: ''I don't want to be like my mom,"" he frets in a final scene. But he repeated the past and more, including growing up gay in Texas, and developing a ""depersonalization disorder"" in which one views one's life in a detached, third person manner as if in a dream.Caouette incorporates numerous media into his cinematic catharsis --super 8 home movies that he started taking when he was 11, still photos, phone messages, movie clips, tape recordings, and even simple text. He fires these at the viewer in a non-linear fashion and at a staccato pace, often filling split screens with dozens of overlapping frames. The disorienting effect mimics his life, and even draws the viewer into his own state of mind. Caouette is a gifted film maker. As a human being he gets high marks for sheer bravery for confronting his horrific past, and for his deep tenderness toward his deranged mother who came to live with him in New York City. No person should bear even a fraction of the curse that he inherited. Tarnation makes at least two claims to fame.

Using widely available software, he has produced a compelling documentary about his difficult childhood and his relationship with his mother, Renee, whose mind has been destroyed by shock treatments.  He uses the home movies, photographs, and tape recordings with which he has documented his own experiences over the course of his life.  Caouette's use of complex montages, color saturation, and many other film techniques is very assured and confident; this film delivers constant visual surprises and effectively communicates the pain and loneliness of the lives it chronicles.Its only drawback is that Caouette sometimes comes across as self-indulgent and even self-aggrandizing in his victim status.  While the majority of the material comes across as brutally honest, the sequences in which an older Jonathan addresses the camera directly were rather jarring and somehow seemed to strike a false note.  I don't doubt for a moment any of the emotion he shows in those sequences, but I couldn't help wondering whether it was ""heightened"" for dramatic purposes.

895121,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0007Y8ABK,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[12, 21]","I was immensely disappointed by this film. The ""avant-garde"" style of the film has been done better by other filmmakers (specifically Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, and Harmony Korine), and the film is mostly about Jonathan, not about his mother. The critics made this film sound like it was an attempt by Jonathan to bring him closer to his mother, to try and understand her by making a film about her, and to bring ""closure"" to their relationship. Well, the film isn't really about Jonathan's mother, it's strictly about him. We hear and see tons of information (with annoying title cards) about Jonathan's life, career, and loves. It feels like an episode of ""this is Jonathan's life"", as if Jonathan is this absolutely fascinating, brilliant individual that we must all pay attention to. He may become a great artist someday, but he isn't there yet. Jonathan uses his mother merely as an excuse to make a very self-indulgent, narcissitic film about himself. He doesn't really seem interested in her, other than as an excuse to show how much HE'S suffered, not really about her suffering. While Jonathan had a horrendous childhood, I felt very little sympathy towards him, as he is constantly mugging for the camera in a ""feel sorry for me, I'm gay and my mother is insane"" way. The man has been taping himself since he was in grammar school, so he's just a tad in love with himself, methinks. Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy is a film that deals with a schizophernic, and it is much more interesting and artistic than this film (Korine's uncle is a schizophernic).

Gradually the notion formed that his own personal universe would be the best subject for a feature film.  After his mother recovered from a lithium overdose, he used iMac technology to edit together a film on the issues that interested him.There is no lack of drama.  Jonathan's mother was frequently hospitalized for mental health problems.  As a child Jonathan watched his mother being raped, was put into an abusive foster home, and was eventually adopted by his mother's parents, Adolph and Rosemary Davis.When Adolph gave Jonathan a movie camera and a Big Brother kept taking him to the movies, Jonathan's life took off.  He would film himself and those around him.  His grandparents put up with his direction for years.  He acted out some campy scenes very well for an eleven-year old.He realized early on that he was gay and got to know the culture of the times.  He had his first boyfriend, Michael Cox, when he was fifteen in high school; they co-directed a musical of ""Blue Velvet.""Jonathan still missed his mother and started destructive behavior, including many suicide attempts.  He was hospitalized for a number of drug- or behavior-related events.After an important gap of several years (during which he fathered a son!), his grandmother died and he chose to move to New York City to be an actor.  He had met his father and received a visit from his mother.  More important, he met the love of his life, David Sanin Paz, who healed Jonathan, allowing Jonathan to try to heal his mother.When his mother overdoses her lithium, a crisis erupts, sending Jonathan back to Houston to deal with his mother and his aging grandfather.  He makes some decisions and the movie comes to its conclusion.I found it all fascinating and worked through the relationships and chronologies to see how matters fit together.  I would have been more than willing to see the three-hour or two-hour versions that were prepared initially or for the film festival in New York.  There were some loose ends, gaps, and questions left.  In the commentary track, he suggested a film on his son and half-brother might interest him, but other topics would be good too.While the creator is primarily interested in reconstructing his past and in looking after his mother, the subjects emphasized in the advertising for the film, I think it would also be worthy to mention the support he got along the way.  His family and Big Brother encouraged his film skills.  His first boyfriend, Michael Cox, was there for Jonathan when he came back from New York to be at his aging grandfather's neglected home after the mother's lithium overdose.  Jonathan's high school friend Michael ""Spooky"" Mouton taught him punk rock, acted in his teen films, went with him to New York, and was his first roommate in New York.  Both Michaels must have been aware of Jonathan's problems but stuck with him.  David Sanin Paz fixed Michael up to take the next steps.  Jonathan's gay and other friends were the key to his success when his biological family was falling apart.The director's commentary is excellent, so much so that the movie isn't really seen until both the film sound and commentary have been heard.  The other extras are also good, although some might have benefited from a commentary track.There are frequent skin scenes of Jonathan and occasional shots of boyfriends.When does Jonathan Caouette's next film come out?",5,Film Maker  Reconstructs Family History,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,3482,"['Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'been', 'filming', 'friends', 'family', 'twenty', 'years', 'Gradually', 'notion', 'formed', 'own', 'personal', 'universe', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'subject', 'feature', 'film', 'mother', 'recovered', 'lithium', 'overdose', 'used', 'iMac', 'technology', 'edit', 'together', 'film', 'issues', 'interested', 'lack', 'drama', 'Jonathan', 'mother', 'was', 'frequently', 'hospitalized', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'child', 'Jonathan', 'watched', 'mother', 'being', 'raped', 'was', 'put', 'abusive', 'foster', 'home', 'was', 'eventually', 'adopted', 'mother', 'parents', 'Adolph', 'Rosemary', 'Davis.When', 'Adolph', 'gave', 'Jonathan', 'movie', 'camera', 'Big', 'Brother', 'kept', 'taking', 'movies', 'Jonathan', 'life', 'took', 'off', 'would', 'film', 'grandparents', 'put', 'up', 'direction', 'years', 'acted', 'out', 'campy', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'eleven-year', 'old.He', 'realized', 'early', 'was', 'gay', 'got', 'know', 'culture', 'times', 'had', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'Michael', 'Cox', 'when', 'was', 'fifteen', 'high', 'school', 'co-directed', 'musical', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Jonathan', 'still', 'missed', 'mother', 'started', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'including', 'many', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'number', 'drug-', 'behavior-related', 'events.After', 'important', 'gap', 'several', 'years', 'fathered', 'son', 'grandmother', 'died', 'chose', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'be', 'actor', 'had', 'met', 'father', 'received', 'visit', 'mother', 'More', 'important', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'David', 'Sanin', 'Paz', 'who', 'healed', 'Jonathan', 'allowing', 'Jonathan', 'try', 'heal', 'mother.When', 'mother', 'lithium', 'crisis', 'erupts', 'sending', 'Jonathan', 'back', 'Houston', 'deal', 'mother', 'aging', 'grandfather', 'decisions', 'movie', 'conclusion.I', 'found', 'fascinating', 'worked', 'relationships', 'chronologies', 'see', 'how', 'matters', 'fit', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'willing', 'see', 'three-hour', 'two-hour', 'versions', 'were', 'prepared', 'initially', 'film', 'festival', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'loose', 'ends', 'gaps', 'questions', 'left', 'commentary', 'track', 'suggested', 'film', 'son', 'half-brother', 'might', 'interest', 'other', 'topics', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'creator', 'primarily', 'interested', 'reconstructing', 'past', 'looking', 'mother', 'subjects', 'emphasized', 'advertising', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'worthy', 'mention', 'support', 'got', 'way', 'family', 'Big', 'Brother', 'encouraged', 'film', 'skills', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'Michael', 'Cox', 'was', 'Jonathan', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'be', 'aging', 'grandfather', 'neglected', 'home', 'mother', 'lithium', 'overdose', 'Jonathan', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Michael', 'Spooky', 'Mouton', 'taught', 'punk', 'rock', 'acted', 'teen', 'films', 'went', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'first', 'roommate', 'New', 'York', 'Michaels', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'aware', 'Jonathan', 'problems', 'stuck', 'David', 'Sanin', 'Paz', 'fixed', 'Michael', 'take', 'next', 'steps', 'Jonathan', 'gay', 'other', 'friends', 'were', 'key', 'success', 'when', 'biological', 'family', 'was', 'falling', 'apart.The', 'director', 'commentary', 'excellent', 'so', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'film', 'sound', 'commentary', 'have', 'been', 'heard', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'benefited', 'commentary', 'are', 'frequent', 'skin', 'scenes', 'Jonathan', 'occasional', 'shots', 'boyfriends.When', 'Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'next', 'film', 'come', 'out']",Tarnation

Wick ""Armchair Apologist and Limosui...","[4, 6]","Like ""Grey Gardens"" and other films about family struggles with mental illness, ""Tarnation"" is an unflinching mixed bag of triumph and sorrow.  It's a complete life ""caught on tape"" and other various media by filmmaker and subject Jonathan Caouette growing up in Texas during the 80's with his mentally ill mother and his grandparents.  The frantic pace of editing and storytelling is what makes it a compelling watch -- while this is a documentary, it's use of underground-aesthetics and MTV-style transitions create a mood that's more like early Gus Van Sant than the simple Mayles Brother's realism.Of course there are times in this film where the relentless images overpower the subjects and the filmmaker-as-subject can come off as narcissistic (but then again, any teenager armed with a video camera will do that - using a means to escape and become something else).  There's also uncomfortable moments that cross the line of intrusion - and your left to wonder what happened when the camera was turned off.  However, this movie does have incredible heart because it goes out on a very vulnerable limb to show those telling moments where he's performing some strange monologue or his mother rambling in front of the camera.  Also - as non-linear as life is, we probably do not need voice-overs, post-scripts, or any authoritative plot-like device that gives the film any more narrative than it needs.Perhaps what is most liberating about this documentary is the fact that it's very a hands-on approach to filmmaking, recalling self-published documentary's where the tools are given to the subjects and simply advised to film themselves.  Apple-users will recognize iMovie tools and effects used through out, creating a patchwork of pictures and memories, all masterfully from a single desktop.

895124,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007Y8ABK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 4]","Tarnation circles around the director of the film and his mother, as he tries to exorcise his cerebral demons that root deep within his past, a past that reaches as far back as the 1950s when his mother was borne to Adolph and Rosemary.  They named their daughter, Renee, who later had Jonathan, the director, and before he was borne his father had disappeared out of his life.  However, long before Jonathan was born, when Renee only was a young teen, an accident caused her to have temporary paralysis in her legs.  The parents believed that all of it was in Renee's head, which compelled them to apply shock treatment to their daughter due to a suggestion of a neighbor.  All wickedness in this sad and true story seems to originate from the day when Renee began her shock treatment as a young teen.Jonathan intermingles photos, old family recordings, fading screens with information of the family's fate together with recent shots that were intended for the making of this film.  All of this footage brings together a personal and disturbing tale and the formation of Jonathan's identity who bravely shares of his tragic misfortunes and unsettling past.  The editing, made by Jonathan, offers an artistically talented experience, as it induce a psychedelic experience.  This strange approach to tell the story provides an expressive channel for the audience to feel what Jonathan might have lived through.  It also bombards the viewer with an over stimulation that feels authentic, as Jonathan tells his story that begins in New York.The first scene displays Renee singing I'm Gonna Let It Shine while twinkling her index finger in a peculiar manner.  This suggests the cerebral disadvantage that she endures, as additional footage offers more information about her difficulty to adapt to the norms of society.  What is most striking in these initial shots is Renee's eyes that radiate a bizarre strangeness.  Consequently, it is revealed that Renee has recently overdosed on Lithium while Jonathan is trying to recover from a high fever.  In fear of her death, Jonathan returns to his childhood town in order to find a way to help her and ease the anguish that he feels inside.Despite all the hardships Jonathan openly exhibits his warm affection for his mother.  He also reveals literally everything, as he showcases himself nude through old recordings he has made in the past.  Yet, it is not his nudeness that will alarm the audience, but his frankness about himself in the shadow of his delusional mother.  Scene after scene brings to mind the structure of a mental disorder, as the audience is brought through Jonathan's childhood and adolescence.  The film illustrates Jonathan's love for film and acting, as an old recording of himself displays a disturbing performance as Sharell.  In addition, Jonathan freely shares about his exploration of his sexuality and other struggles that he faced through his teens.  Ultimately, the audience is brought back to present time and his venture back to his childhood town in Texas.Tarnation offers a brilliantly daring, artistically psychedelic, and poignantly affectionate tale of the filmmakers own upbringing and his attempt to purge himself of his painful past.  In the process, Jonathan Caouette, brings himself closer to be at peace with himself, but it also opens up many old wounds.  Some parts of this documentary resemble Gray Gardens (1975), which tells the story about a mother and daughter living in their decaying mansion in East Hampton.  Yet, Jonathan succeeds in making this story more sensational in a psychedelic manner that induces an atmosphere where the audience can actually experience what Jonathan might have felt during certain parts of his life.",5,Brave Artistic Depiction of Personal and Family Crisis...,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,3724,"['Tarnation', 'circles', 'director', 'film', 'mother', 'exorcise', 'cerebral', 'demons', 'root', 'deep', 'past', 'past', 'far', 'back', '1950s', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'borne', 'Adolph', 'Rosemary', 'named', 'daughter', 'Renee', 'who', 'later', 'had', 'Jonathan', 'director', 'was', 'borne', 'father', 'had', 'disappeared', 'life', 'However', 'long', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'Renee', 'only', 'was', 'young', 'teen', 'accident', 'caused', 'have', 'temporary', 'paralysis', 'legs', 'parents', 'believed', 'was', 'Renee', 'head', 'compelled', 'apply', 'shock', 'treatment', 'daughter', 'due', 'suggestion', 'neighbor', 'wickedness', 'sad', 'true', 'story', 'originate', 'day', 'when', 'Renee', 'began', 'shock', 'treatment', 'young', 'teen.Jonathan', 'intermingles', 'photos', 'old', 'family', 'recordings', 'fading', 'screens', 'information', 'family', 'fate', 'together', 'recent', 'shots', 'were', 'intended', 'making', 'film', 'footage', 'together', 'personal', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'formation', 'Jonathan', 'identity', 'who', 'bravely', 'shares', 'tragic', 'misfortunes', 'unsettling', 'past', 'editing', 'made', 'Jonathan', 'artistically', 'talented', 'experience', 'psychedelic', 'experience', 'strange', 'approach', 'tell', 'story', 'expressive', 'channel', 'audience', 'feel', 'what', 'Jonathan', 'might', 'have', 'lived', 'also', 'viewer', 'over', 'stimulation', 'authentic', 'Jonathan', 'story', 'New', 'York.The', 'first', 'scene', 'displays', 'Renee', 'singing', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Let', 'Shine', 'twinkling', 'index', 'finger', 'peculiar', 'manner', 'cerebral', 'disadvantage', 'additional', 'footage', 'more', 'information', 'difficulty', 'adapt', 'norms', 'society', 'What', 'most', 'striking', 'initial', 'shots', 'Renee', 'eyes', 'radiate', 'bizarre', 'strangeness', 'Consequently', 'revealed', 'Renee', 'recently', 'overdosed', 'Lithium', 'Jonathan', 'trying', 'recover', 'high', 'fever', 'fear', 'death', 'Jonathan', 'childhood', 'town', 'order', 'find', 'way', 'help', 'ease', 'anguish', 'inside.Despite', 'hardships', 'Jonathan', 'openly', 'warm', 'affection', 'mother', 'also', 'literally', 'everything', 'nude', 'old', 'recordings', 'made', 'past', 'not', 'nudeness', 'will', 'alarm', 'audience', 'frankness', 'shadow', 'delusional', 'mother', 'Scene', 'scene', 'brings', 'mind', 'structure', 'mental', 'disorder', 'audience', 'brought', 'Jonathan', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'love', 'film', 'acting', 'old', 'recording', 'disturbing', 'performance', 'Sharell', 'addition', 'Jonathan', 'freely', 'shares', 'exploration', 'sexuality', 'other', 'struggles', 'faced', 'teens', 'Ultimately', 'audience', 'brought', 'back', 'present', 'time', 'venture', 'back', 'childhood', 'town', 'Texas.Tarnation', 'brilliantly', 'daring', 'artistically', 'psychedelic', 'poignantly', 'affectionate', 'tale', 'filmmakers', 'own', 'upbringing', 'attempt', 'purge', 'painful', 'past', 'process', 'Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'closer', 'be', 'peace', 'also', 'up', 'many', 'old', 'wounds', 'parts', 'documentary', 'resemble', 'Gray', 'Gardens', '1975', 'story', 'mother', 'daughter', 'living', 'decaying', 'mansion', 'East', 'Hampton', 'Jonathan', 'making', 'story', 'more', 'sensational', 'psychedelic', 'manner', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'audience', 'can', 'actually', 'experience', 'what', 'Jonathan', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'certain', 'parts', 'life']",Tarnation

It is a virtual collage of videotapes, photographs, narrations, notes, simulations, etc. Some of the special effects are disturbing in their dark artistry and they convey a true sense of mental illness just by viewing and listening. It is a psychodelic nightmare. Caouette has created a real piece of American art. His family story is tragic, starting with a mother who (unnecessarily) went through several series of shock treatments as a girl and young adult, which virtually destroyed her life. She had been a young model. Caouette has video of himself from age eleven showing him acting out in semi-drag both a battered housewife with a southern accent and other characters that are hilarious, well acted and slightly scary. Jonathan has ambivalent feelings towards his mother and the grandparents that raised him, but he shows uncompromised courage and persistence in documenting every important moment - no matter how painful it is.

895126,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007Y8ABK,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 2]","Tarnation is an intense, honest and extremely difficult to watch autobiographical film made by Jonathan Caouette. Jonathan Caouette is brilliant, to say the least; he edited this footage which he principally shot himself over the course of many years. Caouette uses this film as a vehicle to tell his life experiences with clarity mixed with a stream of consciousness and surrealistic clips designed to demonstrate what was going on in his mind at the time. I also think it must have been rather cathartic for Jonathan to make this film.Jonathan Caouette essentially tells his life story in chronological order; and he enhances it very well by showing his grandparents' wedding (on his mother's side of the family) and how they had a daughter named Renee. Unfortunately, Renee falls in an accident and she gets shock treatments to help her recover from what they think is a psychosomatic paralysis. (I don't think they would prescribe that today.) Renee recovers from her paralysis in six months--but the shock treatments continue for 18 months more! We briefly see Jonathan's mother marrying his father Steve; but Steve runs away soon after he marries Renee not even knowing that she's pregnant.Unfortunately, the story gets worse. Renee goes in and out of psychiatric hospitals; and we learn that Jonathan was placed in foster homes for years where he was emotionally and physically abused. I was incensed at the abuse that Jonathan was forced to endure.Jonathan continues to tell his life story: his deep emotional connection with his maternal grandparents and his mother Renee; his quest to find his father Steve; his first boyfriend Michael; moving to New York City from Texas to pursue an acting career and much more.Actually, his life story is fascinating and I truly hung on every word that was printed on the screen; Caouette used this technique to tell us the facts of his life story. We get many psychedelic and surrealistic film clips Jonathan shot to demonstrate the demons in his mind.However, there's a price to pay for watching this film: It's very tough to take. The footage is frequently extremely unpleasant. We see countless family fights and by the time this film was completed Jonathan's mother Renee had so much brain damage from a lithium overdose that we see her acting like a child. The surrealistic clips are often disturbing and while I applaud Jonathan's honesty and openness it's just not easy to swallow. And I have a master's degree in social work that emphasized counseling! If I found this to be tough, you KNOW it's a tough film to sit through.The DVD comes with several extras.

On the face of it, the film tells the story of 31-year-old filmmaker Jonathan Caouette's lifelong relationship with his Texan family, in particular his difficult but loving bond with his mentally ill mother Ren&eacute;e LeBlanc. But, as ""Tarnation"" unfolds, it seems the film is a painful attempt to pay tribute to Ren&eacute;e, whose mind was destroyed by hundreds of electroshock treatments, without having much of Ren&eacute;e to get ahold of. ""Tarnation"" tries to paint a loving portrait of a person who must be reconstructed from the remnants of a shattered personality. It's disturbing and powerful. At the same time, ""Tarnation"" is a self-portrait of Jonathan Caouette that follows his emotionally tumultuous life from his childhood, through his youth, and finally to a more satisfying life in New York City, his character somehow bound with that of his troubled mother all along.""Tarnation"" is unique in its form as well as its content. The film was famously made for only $218 and edited on Jonathan  Caouette's iMac. Caouette uses photographs, old home movies, audio recordings, old television and movie clips, and a few staged reenactments to tell his story. Emulating the style of underground film that its creator has loved since his teens, ""Tarnation"" makes extensive use of distorted  film footage and quick cutting. This doesn't make for easy viewing. The film's grating  style will unfortunately limit ""Tarnation""'s audience. I found the Hi-8 video manipulated to look like old Super-8 particularly unwatchable. But ""Tarnation"" is a no-holds-barred self-examination and loving tribute to a woman who could have been. It's fascinating and moving, and sometimes its ugliness suits the subject.The DVD (Wellspring 2005 release): Bonus features include a U.S. theatrical trailer, a French theatrical trailer, additional scenes, a gallery of 15 movie posters, and an audio commentary. ""1983/1984 Rushes"" are 5 additional or extended scenes. ""Unreleased Tracks"" (1 minute) are 2 sequences of clips set to music that were not included in the movie. In the audio commentary, filmmaker Jonathan Caouette talks about his decisions in putting the film together, including editing and music choices. He also elaborates on some of the events in the film, providing some more details of his experiences.

After being conceived Jonathan's father left with no knowledge of his girlfriend's, Jonathan's mother Renee, pregnancy after pressure from Renee's troubled parents. Renee was a child model and a beautiful young girl until a fall of a roof caused her a minor but serious leg injuries. She was lucky though the pain would subside and injuries would heal, but her parents were convinced Renee obtained mental damage and with doctors approval started shock treatments on young Renee which continued for years. She remained beautiful but began to become mentally damaged.After giving birth to Jonathan, Renee escaped her parents control and left the state. The story only got worse from there though. Jonathan witnessed his mother being raped and after the authorities intervened Jonathan was put into foster care where he was subject to beatings by numorous foster parents. Soon thereafter Jonathan was given back to his grandparents who became his legal guardians.Possibly to escape his pain and troubles, Jonathan began video taping himself and family. We see in the film this home footage including a disturbing but important scene where Jonathan dresses up as a woman and acts out as a young woman battling abuse. The scene is both fasinating and breathtaking. He continues piecing his life together with video footage and photos for the next 20 years, which would become this moving picture which brings us up to date with Jonathan and culminated in his first meeting with his father and interviews with his mother, now emotionally scarred and mentally disabled.This film has moved me in a way that no other film ever has. It was heartbreaking and beatiful. What transcended was Jonathan's love for his mother and courage to survive. Several times I sat in disbelief at the tragedy Jonathan and his mother endured. This film was an out of body experience putting the viewer in another person's skin for an hour and a half. Every minute of the film I felt Jonathan's pain, his love, his overwhelming strenghth and exuberance. After the film I thought about my life and I realized how better I had it then him. But I also had mental problems and family troubles, so he not only touched me but inspired me as well.Jonathan Caouette's ""Tarnation"" is a beautiful, mesmerizing, heartbreaking and inspirational film about the power of love and courage of one brave boy.",5,Heartbreaking and Uplifting,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2441,"['Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'life', 'one', 'subject', 'will', 'truely', 'tested', 'being', 'conceived', 'Jonathan', 'father', 'left', 'knowledge', 'girlfriend', 'Jonathan', 'mother', 'Renee', 'pregnancy', 'pressure', 'Renee', 'troubled', 'parents', 'Renee', 'was', 'child', 'model', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'fall', 'roof', 'caused', 'minor', 'serious', 'leg', 'injuries', 'was', 'lucky', 'pain', 'would', 'subside', 'injuries', 'would', 'heal', 'parents', 'were', 'convinced', 'Renee', 'obtained', 'mental', 'damage', 'doctors', 'approval', 'started', 'shock', 'treatments', 'young', 'Renee', 'continued', 'years', 'remained', 'beautiful', 'began', 'become', 'mentally', 'damaged.After', 'giving', 'birth', 'Jonathan', 'Renee', 'escaped', 'parents', 'control', 'left', 'state', 'story', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'Jonathan', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'being', 'raped', 'authorities', 'intervened', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'put', 'foster', 'care', 'where', 'was', 'subject', 'beatings', 'numorous', 'foster', 'parents', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'given', 'back', 'grandparents', 'who', 'became', 'legal', 'guardians.Possibly', 'escape', 'pain', 'troubles', 'Jonathan', 'began', 'video', 'taping', 'family', 'see', 'film', 'home', 'footage', 'including', 'disturbing', 'important', 'scene', 'where', 'Jonathan', 'up', 'woman', 'out', 'young', 'woman', 'battling', 'abuse', 'scene', 'fasinating', 'breathtaking', 'piecing', 'life', 'together', 'video', 'footage', 'photos', 'next', '20', 'years', 'would', 'become', 'moving', 'picture', 'up', 'date', 'Jonathan', 'culminated', 'first', 'meeting', 'father', 'interviews', 'mother', 'now', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'mentally', 'disabled.This', 'film', 'moved', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'beatiful', 'What', 'transcended', 'was', 'Jonathan', 'love', 'mother', 'courage', 'survive', 'Several', 'times', 'sat', 'disbelief', 'tragedy', 'Jonathan', 'mother', 'endured', 'film', 'was', 'body', 'experience', 'putting', 'viewer', 'person', 'skin', 'hour', 'half', 'minute', 'film', 'felt', 'Jonathan', 'pain', 'love', 'overwhelming', 'strenghth', 'exuberance', 'film', 'thought', 'life', 'realized', 'how', 'better', 'had', 'then', 'also', 'had', 'mental', 'problems', 'family', 'troubles', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'touched', 'inspired', 'well.Jonathan', 'Caouette', 'Tarnation', 'beautiful', 'mesmerizing', 'heartbreaking', 'inspirational', 'film', 'power', 'love', 'courage', 'one', 'brave', 'boy']",Tarnation

895133,A3AC7H2Q6DFMVK,B0007Y8ABK,"Sur-reel Life, All About My Movies ""Phil X""","[5, 6]","Caouette takes an original approach to the autobiographical documentary, mostly eschewing hearsay and dramatic re-enactment for a more avant-garde, rock video aesthetic. Utilizing home video footage, some of which dates back to when the subject was barely walking age, he assembles an extremely haunting and stylized pastiche of childhood traumas and adolescent angst. Caouette took to the camera at a very young age, his nascent obsession with capturing images on film serving as his primary means of dealing with years of institutional abuse. But as we watch him grow up before our very eyes, and experience his trials and tribulations, which include sexual experimentation, frequent rages, time in a mental hospital, and a mind-altering experiment involving marijuana dipped in formaldehyde, it also becomes apparent that Jonathan has the soul of an artist, and no shortage of talent wielding his trusty Super 8.At various points, ""Tarnation"" stares down the director/subject's Houston-based family, particularly his grandparents, whose unwavering belief in their normalcy blinds them to how irrevocably screwed-up they actually are. They could be brain-damaged; Caouette himself doesn't seem to know for sure. Meanwhile, these chapters of unflinching realism are offset by dreamlike sister passages, as if the great David Lynch, whose work Caouette clearly was a fan of (Indeed, the funniest montage in the film documents Jonathan's successful high school musical production of the 1986 classic, ""Blue Velvet""), actually dropped in to personally direct his late night TV-viewing hours.During these somnambulant interludes, which feature close-ups of television screen blizzards, ominous droning barely perceptible beneath the soundtrack, and the bright and shiny juxtaposed with murky darkness, the tone vacillates between calming fantasy and tweaker's nightmare. Like any dream, however, the sleeper's subconscious eventually finds its way into the fabric. If ""Tarnation"" represents a map of the director's subconscious, what preoccupies him most is his mother, Renee. Growing up, he never got to know the ""real"" her, the Renee LeBlanc before the depression, before the divorce from Jonathan's father, before those aforementioned grandparents, who were about as ignorant as they were morally self-righteous, had shock treatments administered to her, destroying her personality. The lynchpin of the movie is his enduring relationship with her, rife with wonder and frustration, which represents the impossible-to-sever umbilical connection that exists between all mothers and their children.Renee's dilapidated, mentally gone existence acts as a mirror to Jonathan, reflecting a future he can envision for himself. Turning out the same world-worn way doesn't seem all that far-fetched, considering how their respective pasts are already very similar (physical and emotional abuse, drugs, burgeoning career based on physical appearances). During a ""Big Brother,"" reality TV-style confession that serves as the denouement of the film, Jonathan admits his fears of ending up like Renee. It's just that, when she was his age, she seemed a lot better than she does now. But looking at things rationally, a similar kind of fate seems highly unlikely for Caouette. If his completed autobiography proves anything, it is his willingness to confront the past, to try and sublimate the pain and overcome the trauma. The mere fact that he attempts this, unlike his mother, who avoids talking about the worst times to the very end, confirms how different they really are. Yes, she is his mother; yes, like her, Jonathan Caouette may consider himself tarnished. But in truth, no one shines brighter than he, and this movie is strong evidence of that.* * *Thanks for reading! You can find more reviews at reellifeallaboutmymovies.blogspot.com",5,F for F***ed-Up?
