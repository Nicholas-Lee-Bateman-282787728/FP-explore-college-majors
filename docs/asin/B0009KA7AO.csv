907293,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009KA7AO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 7]","I've caught snippets of Jiminy Glick on Comedy Central, but I have never really sat down and watched the show for any length of time.  Still, this is Martin Short we're talking about, so I was fairly confident that Jiminy Glick in La La Wood would prove funny and entertaining - and it did.  The film's a little uneven as a whole, but it has several laugh out loud moments, and it maintains a decent level of humor from start to finish.Martin Short created Jiminy Glick for his long-gone talk show, but Jiminy is best known for his Primetime Glick interview show on Comedy Central.  Let's say he has a unique interviewing style and let it go at that.  As the film opens, he's the primary entertainment critic in Butte, Montana - but he is all excited about his chance to attend the Toronto Film Festival and hobnob with stars that don't have second jobs in department stores.  It's a family affair as his wife Dixie (Jan Hooks) and twin boys Matthew and Modine arrive to live it up and schmooze with the stars.  Unfortunately, no one knows who Jiminy Glick is - but all that changes after he snags an interview with the incredibly reclusive Ben DiCarlo (Corey Pearson) who is there to showcase his new film Growing Up Gandhi.  Suddenly, Glick's the main attraction at the film festival and he lines up some pretty big names for one-on-one talk sessions, including Steve Martin and Kurt Russell.  There's only one problem - he fears he may have murdered a prominent actress while he was in an alcoholic haze.This is a really funny movie.  Glick isn't my favorite Martin Short character of all time, but he's definitely one of Short's funniest creations.  Just about everything he says and does is funny.  As an interviewer, he just says whatever pops into his head, and some pretty weird stuff almost always comes out as a result.  Short almost steals the show away from himself, though, with his portrayal of David Lynch, who pops up from time to time to set the weirdly abstract stage for the murder mystery-like part of the story.  Short's Lynch impersonation is truly a classic.  I also have to say that Jan Hooks proved much funnier than I expected, as well; she and Short have really good comedic chemistry.The film gets a bit racy in a couple of places, which undoubtedly earned it its R rating, and I don't see how that helps the film at all.  Even the crude jokes usually come off as funny, though.  I don't think you have to be familiar with Jiminy before seeing the film, but Glick fans will surely get more of a kick out of the movie experience and should definitely check it out.  Crude, shrewd, shallow - and funny.

907298,A3LOXOMPX3ZPRK,B0009KA7AO,"Lawrence Brown ""Larry Brown""","[0, 0]","I like Martin Short. I like everything about him. I think he's a great singer and entertainer, he's smart, he's lovable, and he's apparently very funny because he's always cracking up the cast and behind camera crew. He and his style appeal to me, and I just like him.But this movie just isn't funny. And Glick isn't funny. Short tries to carry Glick with the same funny speech patterns that carried Ed Grimley... ""I'm as doomed as doomed could be, ya' know."" Grimley and Glick use similar speech patterns. But that's not enough to carry this character or this movie.Short says in the DVD commentary that they improvised most scenes with no or very little script, though his commentary partner calls him on that and disagrees with him and insists there was a script. Now that's funny. But anyway, as the Beatles learned when filming ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" hoping that people will be naturally funny and interesting doesn't work. You have to put some hard work and long hours into a polished script to get anything worth shooting. This movie (if there really was no script) again affirms that truth.This movie features a lot of vulgar material and I think that was a big mistake. The larger plot and story and comedy style would have appealed to young people and families and Short sacrificed that entire viewing audience for the coarse material and it really doesn't add anything. I guess Short felt an R rating was what was needed at this point in his career.Very little in this movie works. The boyfriend/manager character was the only one that was funny, yes he was over the top but at least he was actually somewhat funny. Glick is best when Hollywood celebrity Short shows through the character while giving a good natured ribbing to Hollywood giants like Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Kurt Russel (Hanks does not appear in this movie but Glick has interviewed him elsewhere to great results). The interviews that Glick does with Martin and Russel, and especially the deleted outtake footage of those interviews are the only thing that works in this movie.The production and story were much bigger than what I expected. The plot explanation at the end is pretty good, creative, outlandish, unexpected, and funny. There's a part that was scripted.

Whether it was from his days from Saturday Night Live as Ed Grimley, or in many of his well-recognized acting roles from The Three Amigos, and Father Of The Bride. Well, he has put that full forward with his latest characture, Jiminy Glick. The nutty television interviewer was a debut regular from Martin's short-lived talk show in 1999, and on the more successful spinoff, Comedy Central's Primetime Glick. With all that surprise hype, it is just strange that there actually is a movie about Jiminy Glick.Jiminy Glick in La La Wood, tells the story of Jiminy, and his trip to the Toronto Film Festival. He takes along his wife, Dixie, and two of his four sons, Matthew & Modine. His other two sons Morgan and Mason aren't featured in this movie. In the film, Jiminy scores a review with a Johnny Depp-like actor named Ben Decarlo, upon a released parody film called Going, Going, Ghandi. Well, Jiminy fell asleep during the film, and pretended to enjoy it. Yet, he scores big with several other interviews from people like Steve Martin, and Rob Lowe. Yet, within that hype, he gets caught within a bad dream that he had with a hasbeen actress named Melinda Carlisle, after getting drunk from a stint with rappers. Within that, he keeps dreaming that he actually was the one who murdered Melinda, which actually turned out to be a misunderstanding. All in all, the movie is tasteful at times, but just has some silly slapstick, like Dixie slapping Jiminy in one scene after he tells her about his nightmare. The story is also funny, but could've had a better plot twist rather than just the nightmare in Jiminy's head.I honestly don't think that a lot of people might really be interested in Jiminy Glick in La La Wood. Still, if you're a die hard fan of Martin Short's character, this would be a most amusing movie to see. Otherwise, you're just better off looking at the film when it comes to cable.
