1533184,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007L6VPL4,C. Sawin,"[11, 13]","Jeff, Who Lives at Home isn't the type of comedy you'd expect from the likes of Jason Segel and Ed Helms. While the film's humor is similar to what you'd find in an episode of ""The Office"" (which Helms co-stars in) in the sense that everything is very dry and isn't necessarily side-splitting but chuckle worthy, both Segel and Helms manage to be slightly different from the roles they've played in the past.Jason Segel is Jeff; a thirty year old pothead that still lives in his mom's basement. Helms is Pat; Jeff's slightly more responsible older brother with marital problems. These summaries don't sound all that different from Segel's role in Knocked Up or Helm's role in The Hangover, but there's more to their characters than what's first let on. Jeff is incredibly depressed and has this hopeless sense of coincidences being signs of a bigger purpose while Pat is a total prick. He does whatever he wants to do without listening to anyone else and has a way of making anyone he's talking to feel like an idiot in the span of a few lines of dialogue.The other element is Susan Surandon who portrays the mother of Jeff and Pat. She's a hopeless romantic who hates what her children have grown into. Linda's secret admirer storyline is the first part of Jeff, Who Lives at Home that feels genuine. The conclusion of that secondary storyline is when the movie ditches its attempt at R-rated independent humor and becomes more emotional and real.It's not that Jeff, Who Lives at Home doesn't have its humorous moments. The humor is at its peak when Segel and Helms share screen time. Pat digging in the trash outside of the restaurant as Jeff advises him not to and their conversation outside of the hotel room are two of the funniest scenes in the movie, but it feels like familiar ground. Any indie comedy you can think of is similar in comparison. It's like the movie is trying way too hard to be indie at times. I found myself thinking of Little Miss Sunshine. Once Pat's marriage heads south is when things start to really mean something.The camera work was really odd though; constantly zooming in and out on still shots like Jeff sitting on the couch and talking on the phone or during conversations in general. There wasn't really a lot of movement to try and follow or anything. At first it seemed to be for a dramatic effect, but then the zooming became too frequent.Films that have meaning should be held at higher value than the ones that are pure entertainment. Entertaining movies are fun, but it's like they only have one layer to them. Films that give a message seem to have several layers to them and if done properly allow you to feel more emotions and allows you to feel like you've witnessed the complete cycle of a group of characters. Jeff, Who Lives at Home treads similar ground that Salmon Fishing in the Yemen does in the way that the least likely person winds up being the voice of reason.Fate and everything coming full circle are huge plot points in the film that are revealed in very satisfying ways.

1533186,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B007L6VPL4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Jeff, Who Lives At Home is one of those surprising little films where everything comes together at the end.Jason Segel is the bum stoner Jeff, who lives at his mother's, Susan Sarandon, home. Somebody calls Jeff, mistakenly looking for Kevin. His mother calls a few minutes later and tells Jeff to fix a shutter, go to the store and buy glue. These seemingly innocent simple moments set the entire film in motion, Jeff is the only person that can understand the Kevin sign that he just heard.Segel has recently acted in a number of films where he is the only person that sees what others cannot see. This is the best version of those films. The film starts out relatively slow. Gradually it becomes clear that Jeff is the only one that sees what is really going on in the world around him. The only real distraction of this film are the production values, the film has more of a made for television feel. The camera work is that needless movement, rapid zoom technique used in television dramas. The editing and framing are workaday television standard.The ending was a wonderful surprise. The last ten minutes changed this from a standard pot boiler movie to something special. For me, that was the payoff. In some respects I thought of Run Lola Run, the movie that three times over explores what would happen if one small event in the story changed. This is by no means on the masterpiece level of Run Lola Run; I was just reminded of that film.The cast is surprisingly good. Segel is a well known quantity; he has played this role before in so many movies. Ed Helms is just marginally different from his character in The Office. Prior to this film, I had grown very tired of his ""Andy-ness."" He brought something just a little different this time, and I liked him. Susan Sarandon is her usual somewhat quirky nutty self, but played it a bit more subtly than usual. Judy Greer (Two And A Half Men and Californication) is exactly the right balance of hurt and crazy. I was surprised to see Rae Dawn Chong (the daughter of Tommy Chong - Cheech and Chong) play a wonderful straight role in the film. There is a subtle joke - Chong has nothing to do with pot in this film, but smoking was a critical central part of this film. Her father made a career out of pot smoking jokes, being one of the original stoners.The Duplass brothers did a wonderful job directing this film. Cyrus is one of their early films and is a perfect companion to Jeff. (Cyrus)The film is rated R for language and drug use. There is no nudity and a few minor brawls. This film would be perfectly fine for a younger mature viewer.Although not a masterpiece, this is a wonderful film. I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever expected. I would say this is Jason Segel's best film.",5,Surprise - Better Than Expected,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2745,"['Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'one', 'surprising', 'little', 'films', 'where', 'everything', 'together', 'end.Jason', 'Segel', 'bum', 'stoner', 'Jeff', 'who', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'home', 'Somebody', 'Jeff', 'mistakenly', 'looking', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'tells', 'Jeff', 'fix', 'shutter', 'go', 'store', 'buy', 'glue', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'simple', 'moments', 'set', 'entire', 'film', 'motion', 'Jeff', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'understand', 'Kevin', 'sign', 'just', 'heard.Segel', 'recently', 'acted', 'number', 'films', 'where', 'only', 'person', 'what', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'best', 'version', 'films', 'film', 'out', 'relatively', 'slow', 'Gradually', 'clear', 'Jeff', 'only', 'one', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'world', 'only', 'real', 'distraction', 'film', 'are', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'more', 'made', 'television', 'feel', 'camera', 'work', 'needless', 'movement', 'rapid', 'zoom', 'technique', 'used', 'television', 'dramas', 'editing', 'framing', 'are', 'workaday', 'television', 'standard.The', 'ending', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'changed', 'standard', 'pot', 'boiler', 'movie', 'something', 'special', 'was', 'payoff', 'respects', 'thought', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'explores', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'one', 'small', 'event', 'story', 'changed', 'means', 'masterpiece', 'level', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'was', 'just', 'reminded', 'film.The', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Segel', 'well', 'known', 'quantity', 'played', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'just', 'marginally', 'different', 'character', 'Office', 'Prior', 'film', 'had', 'grown', 'very', 'tired', 'Andy-ness', 'brought', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'time', 'liked', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'usual', 'somewhat', 'quirky', 'nutty', 'self', 'played', 'bit', 'more', 'subtly', 'usual', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'Californication', 'exactly', 'right', 'balance', 'hurt', 'crazy', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'daughter', 'Tommy', 'Chong', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'play', 'wonderful', 'straight', 'role', 'film', 'subtle', 'joke', 'Chong', 'nothing', 'do', 'pot', 'film', 'smoking', 'was', 'critical', 'central', 'part', 'film', 'father', 'made', 'career', 'pot', 'smoking', 'jokes', 'being', 'one', 'original', 'stoners.The', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'Cyrus', 'one', 'early', 'films', 'perfect', 'companion', 'Jeff', 'Cyrus', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'nudity', 'few', 'minor', 'brawls', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'younger', 'mature', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'wonderful', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'expected', 'would', 'say', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'best', 'film']",Jeff: Who Lives at Home
1533187,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B007L6VPL4,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","""Jeff Who Lives At Home"" begins with a simple concept.  Our hero Jeff (Jason Segel) sits in his mother's basement toking a water pipe pondering the meaning of life.  A wrong number asking for Kevin sets off a chain of events.  In Jeff's mind there has to be a reason for someone asking for Kevin.  Off the couch Jeff goes in a series of adventures for some kind of cosmic significance and in the process gives meaning to his life and helps repair his brother Pat's(Ed Helms) strained marriage and give his widowed mother (Susan Sarandon) some degree of happiness.  Director-writers Mark and Jay Duplass are not trying to change the game with this film but in an unpretentious way create movie magic.  It helps that Segel's Jeff is an amiable sort instead of a cliched slacker.  And what fountain of youth is Sarandon drinking from?

Right away Jeff Who Lives At Home falls flat, because Jeff (a gentle pot-smoking 30-year-old loser living in his mother's basement) doesn't engage you. Five minutes in and you're already wondering where the film is going. Jeff's unsympathetic and unlikable brother works in a paint store and is having a bad time with his wife, who objects to his purchase of a Porsche. An aggressive man mistakenly calls Jeff at home looking for Kevin and in his drug-addled state Jeff becomes fixated with everyone and everything named Kevin and gets on a bus across town where he bumps into his brother and... we don't really care. The plot sucks, I'm afraid, and what takes this movie to the bottom of the ocean is bad casting and bad acting.

Some argue free will over pre-destination but I don't see the two as being mutually exclusive. There is a pre-determined point in all our futures, but that point exists because of the choices we make. It's not a point created by an outside force and that is part of what is going on in this movie.Here's the scoop. Jeff (Jason Segel) is 30 years old, lives in his mom's basement and smokes a lot of pot. He has never gotten over the trauma of losing his father and looks for 'signs' that will point him to his destiny. His brother Pat (Ed Helms) keeps screwing up his relationship with his wife (Judy Greer) by always putting himself first. Mom (Susan Sarandon), who also never got over her husband's death, is frustrated in trying to get Jeff motivated to perform even the most rudimentary of tasks. She suddenly finds herself with a secret admirer in her office. Signs that Jeff sees (or thinks he sees) lead to a situation where Pat thinks his wife might be cheating on him. The ensuing adventure helps point everyone to what might be their destiny.Though maybe not a great movie, this still deserves a look. The Duplass brothers are onto something in that the adventures they depict aren't that big, but they're bigger than the player's everyday lives. And they do manage to involve the viewer. Jeff's looking for signs leads him to the adventure, but it's his decision to follow those signs that, in fact, leads him to, what he feels, is his destiny. Helms is good as Pat. He's mildly successful but wants way more than he should, and more than his home can sustain. In this instance, it's a Porsche he can nowhere near afford. Sarandon is always good. Her frustration is palpable here. She just needs to get back on the horse, even if it's a horse of a different color. The filming is very low key. It gives the viewer the sense of being with the characters. I liked the music score as well. It was dotted with some nifty, indy-ish tunes. The ending is more than a bit pat but somehow I didn't mind. Because, in the end, we all want to be close with those who are the most important to us.This is a bit better than the three stars I gave it. See it.

Sharon is fed up with his slacker life, and Jeff is waiting for Fate to give him a purpose in life.  Meanwhile, Jeff's brother Pat (Ed Helms) is dealing with a crumbling marriage to Linda (Judy Greer).  Ed further alienates his wife when he makes a very ill-advised purchase of a Porsche, which is far outside of the couple's budget.The film's main focus is the relationship between the brothers.  Initially, the brothers squabble, and it's clear Pat has no respect for Jeff's lifestyle.  Nevertheless, Pat enlists Jeff's help when he believes his wife is cheating on him, and the two embark on a comical chase of Pat's wife and her suspected lover across the city.The acting was universally good, and the story was original.  In particular, I thought Helms was great in his depiction of a man who feels both disconnected from his wife and terrified at the thought of losing her.  I enjoyed the relationship between the two brothers.  Like many siblings, they don't always get along, and they are not always kind to each other, but their mutual devotion was touching.What worked less well was Sarandon's story line.  It's not exactly easy to believe the still-beautiful woman as a frumpy, lovelorn cubicle dweller.  She has a secret admirer in the office, and she's convinced that she's so unattractive and old that this must be a joke.  I think the reveal was meant to be shocking, but the identity of the ""secret"" admirer was immediately obvious to me.

1533215,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B007L6VPL4,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[0, 0]","Jeff, Who Lives At Home follows brothers Jeff, a 30 year old stoner living in his mother's basement, and Pat, a moderately successful man with a failing marriage. Jeff has a unique outlook on life, where he believes everything happens for a reason and random events can be perceived as signs; Jeff coincidentally runs into Pat, and a chain reaction of events occurs. Jeff, Who Lives At Home is a funny, thought-provoking, and compelling film, with comedy and drama.The story in this film is very immersive and compelling. The film blends drama and comedy, and manages to stay balanced. The comedy in this film is often subtle; although I mentioned a ""stoner"" early, don't expect a stoner comedy or something raunchy (like Pineapple Express or Harold and Kumar.) This story has a lot of heart, allowing it to be genuinely compelling; this film has the ability to make you think about your lifestyle, and potentially change or challenge the way you think. Jason Segel and Ed Helms give fantastic performances and have great chemistry, and the rest of the acting was great, as well.Overall, Jeff, Who Lives at Home is an amazing comedy/drama, supported by two wonderful performances and a thought-provoking theme.

I'm a huge fan of Jason Segel's (Jeff) work, so naturally I wanted to see this. However, it was nothing like I expected.I thought we'd follow Jeff through a point of his life that covered a week, a month, or any set period of time for that matter, but that's not really what happens. We follow Jeff through one crazy day in his life. Which isn't bad, but I feel they could've done more with the character had they expanded the amount of time the movie covered in his life. On top of that the movie is really short, running just over one hour and twenty minutes.Jeff is a 30 year old stoner who currently lives in his mothers basement. He's recently been infatuated with the movie Signs, and is taking everything that happens to be some sort of sign. Jeff's main goal is to find some sort of greater purpose for himself. He feels lost in today's world, as if there's something he's supposed to find out about himself. During the movie he is helping his brother Pat (Ed Helms) who is also going through a rough patch. Only difference is Pat has a wife, a job, and a life. Even though the movie didn't play out as I expected, I still fell in love with it. Mainly with Jeff. I feel I resemble Jeff a lot in the sense that I too am searching for what my destiny is in life, and until I do I just live life day to day. You see everyone else around you progressing in their lives, and you just feel stuck.I don't know who did the music to the film, but it was wonderful. It definitely served its purpose in setting the perfect mood for the film. It's very lighthearted and carefree, I hope I can find the score somewhere.The only thing I can really complain about aside from the length is how it was filmed. If you've ever watched an episode of the Office, that's the best thing to compare it to. The camera is kind of shaky and it zooms in and out on the character a few times in each shot. It doesn't make it unwatchable, but that kind of filming isn't for everyone.Overall Score: 8/10 - Even though it didn't turn out as I expected, I still highly recommend this film. If you're into those weird comedy films that don't necessarily try to be comedies, then you will enjoy this. Overall it's a beautiful movie, and Jason Segel does an amazing job as Jeff.

1533218,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B007L6VPL4,Kevin F. Tasker,"[5, 6]","Seeing Jeff, Who Lives at Home is the cinematic equivalent of a long bath in a Tibetan river with a guide whose philosophical exaltations result in a state of levity even though we know in our hearts he is just another clueless Midwestern white dude. But hey, at least he's trying!  The film wavers, quivers, jumps. It relies on coincidence and divine intervention, astrologically positioning our hero--the eponymous Jeff--in his home at the story's beginning, and in crisis by its climax 80 minutes later. At the outset, he receives a cryptic phone call asking for someone named Kevin so he sets out to find this mystical being (he is very stoned, presumably, taking a massive bong rip just after he spends a lot of time recording a rambling though perfectly apt understanding of the film Signs). His brother, meanwhile, is down on his luck, failing to properly understand his girlfriend. Oh, and his mother has a secret admirer. So the plot thickens.This beautifully shot film relies very heavily on signs and wonders which, while not necessarily bad, do challenge the verisimilitude of the audience. It is the little things that bug. Why does Jeff end up outside the Hooters? Why does everyone end up where they end up near the conclusion? The film, though it portrays an ostensibly simple story, asks a lot from the audience. You must willingly adhere to its whimsical world logic, if you are to enjoy the skewed though heartfelt events as they unfold. Thankfully, the performances are stellar. Jason Segel and Ed Helms are perfect foils for one another and develop a brotherly repartee embedded with decades of strife and misunderstanding. The men could hardly be more opposite and this adds dramatic tension to their fights and frolicking throughout the Louisiana landscape. Elsewhere, Susan Sarandon is excellent-though extraneous--in the final's principle subplot which meanders and broods, ultimately feeling more akin to a 30 minute television show than an addition to such a film. Arguably, Sarandon's mother character's lamentations provide a further undercurrent to the disconnect which plagues Jeff and his brother, allowing the viewer to see where the roots of uncertainty sprouted. The subplot, as a whole, feels vacuous however, and lends very little of substance, though it is indeed wistful and, in many ways, quite watchable.In the end, while it twists through a multitude of familiar locales (restaurants, hotels, offices and the titular basement), and situations (an outsider playing basketball with black youths, a torrid love affair (or two) etc) the film is imbued with an undeniable current of magic. The same magic which drives Jeff will, if you let it, bubble into your heart and force a smile through layers of film-going cynicism. The final scene is actually tear-inducing and its specifics won't be spoiled. If heart and integrity translated to box office success--this film would outpace Avatar or The Hunger Games in its opening weekend alone.

1533223,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B007L6VPL4,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 2]","Jeff, Who Lives At Home is a tough movie on review. I enjoyed watching it, but I suspect that I will later feel embarrassed for this. It's not that the film is bad. Hardly. It's more that it is so overtly precious that it's hard to know if I'm responding to it because it truly has much to recommend it, or if I'm not just riding on the faux-sugar high of the movie's saccharine backbone.The film follows Jeff (Jason Segel), a 30 year-old stoner who lives in his mother's (Susan Sarandon) basement. After postulating on the deeper meanings of Shyamalan's misfire,Signs, Jeff is inundated with signs, starting with an ad for a multivitamin, all of which conspire to lead him to his destiny. Along the way, he crosses paths with his older brother, a jerk named Pat who is currently on the outs with his wife, Linda (Judy Greer). Simultaneously, Jeff and Pat's mother struggles with her age (it's her birthday), her loneliness (her husband died a few years ago), and a secret admirer at her workplace.These plots intertwine in clever, sometimes funny, ways, but never without a double dose of portentous coincidence (or is it fate?). It seems like it might be tongue-in-cheek, but Jeff certainly takes the whole thing very seriously, and the end results are also not nearly as funny as they are sobering. The movie's soundtrack (a light and playful and nearly-constant stream of xylophone  music) as well as the camerawork (there are many odd twitches and zooms in and out, as if the producers wanted to add just a hint of a documentary feel) add to the film's ambiguous and nonchalant profundity.It's perhaps best not to read too much into the story. The film is character-driven, and even though nearly every person is unlikeable or annoying in some way, they are so perfectly acted and their relationships are so solidly defined that it's a joy to watch them interact. The humor isn't forced into punchlines or jokes or even quirks. It's found in the harmonic dissonance of intersecting lives lived in different keys. These people clash, but they also complement each other. In the end, it all comes together, wrapped up with a neat, cute little bow (a la Signs), and you're left wondering if you weren't just bamboozled by an 83 minute Hallmark card.I can see being annoyed by the film and its when-you-wish-upon-a-star mentality. It just so happens I was in the mood for that kind of low-calorie philosophizing, though, and the performances were truly touching. It's a gentle film, inoffensive but not without a tiny little kick. I predict there are many who will find it a little cheap or even downright puerile, but I predict many more will feel the opposite. I can't say either perspective is entirely wrong, but I will say that you don't have to believe either to enjoy the movie.",4,Home Is Where The Heart Is (And Also The Bong),1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2786,"['Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'tough', 'movie', 'review', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'suspect', 'will', 'later', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'not', 'film', 'bad', 'Hardly', 'more', 'so', 'overtly', 'precious', 'hard', 'know', ""'m"", 'responding', 'truly', 'much', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'riding', 'faux-sugar', 'high', 'movie', 'saccharine', 'backbone.The', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Jason', 'Segel', '30', 'year-old', 'stoner', 'who', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'basement', 'postulating', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'Shyamalan', 'misfire', 'Signs', 'Jeff', 'inundated', 'signs', 'starting', 'ad', 'multivitamin', 'conspire', 'lead', 'destiny', 'way', 'paths', 'older', 'brother', 'jerk', 'named', 'Pat', 'who', 'currently', 'outs', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Simultaneously', 'Jeff', 'Pat', 'mother', 'age', 'birthday', 'loneliness', 'husband', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'secret', 'admirer', 'workplace.These', 'plots', 'intertwine', 'clever', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'ways', 'never', 'double', 'dose', 'portentous', 'coincidence', 'fate', 'might', 'be', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Jeff', 'certainly', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'seriously', 'end', 'results', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'are', 'sobering', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'light', 'playful', 'nearly-constant', 'stream', 'xylophone', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'camerawork', 'are', 'many', 'odd', 'twitches', 'zooms', 'out', 'producers', 'wanted', 'add', 'just', 'hint', 'documentary', 'feel', 'add', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'nonchalant', 'profundity.It', 'perhaps', 'best', 'not', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'film', 'character-driven', 'even', 'nearly', 'person', 'unlikeable', 'annoying', 'way', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'relationships', 'are', 'so', 'solidly', 'defined', 'joy', 'watch', 'interact', 'humor', ""n't"", 'forced', 'punchlines', 'jokes', 'even', 'quirks', 'found', 'harmonic', 'dissonance', 'intersecting', 'lives', 'lived', 'different', 'keys', 'people', 'clash', 'also', 'complement', 'other', 'end', 'together', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neat', 'cute', 'little', 'bow', 'la', 'Signs', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'bamboozled', '83', 'minute', 'Hallmark', 'card.I', 'can', 'see', 'being', 'annoyed', 'film', 'when-you-wish-upon-a-star', 'mentality', 'just', 'happens', 'was', 'mood', 'kind', 'low-calorie', 'philosophizing', 'performances', 'were', 'truly', 'touching', 'gentle', 'film', 'inoffensive', 'not', 'tiny', 'little', 'kick', 'predict', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'little', 'cheap', 'even', 'downright', 'puerile', 'predict', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'feel', 'opposite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'either', 'perspective', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'will', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'believe', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Jeff: Who Lives at Home

In this movie we still get the offbeat characters, but they tend to be more likable, if flawed. At least I found myself rooting for them.  Jeff (Jason Segel) is 30 and lives in the basement of his mother's house.  He isn't happy and is unemployed from what I can tell.  He's obsessed with the Shyamalan movie ""Signs"" (2002).  Aided by heavy doses of pot, Jeff believes the name Kevin is a sign for him leading perhaps to a better life.  So he follows anything or anyone with the name Kevin.His older brother Pat (Ed Helms) is married to Linda (Judy Greer) but their union is in jeopardy.  Lack of communication seems to be the problem as Pat doesn't listen and just talks past Linda on issues.  He buys a Porsche on his limited income.  Linda wants to save for a house.  Yeah, he's a jerk.The majority of the film deals with chance meetings of the brothers, Linda and the boy's mother, Sharon (an excellent Susan Sarandon).  Sharon's scenes deal with a potential office admirer and Sarandon plays them with the charm and sophistication she's perfected.  Without question this is a small movie with wit and an occasional bite.  The movie's conclusion, I thought was a perfect and brought the whole movie together.  Nice film.  Well constructed, well written, well made.The Blu ray transfer provides an excellent 1080p picture.  From what I can tell, the movie was shot using high definition video cameras rather than film.  Still it looks crisp and clear in every aspect.  While it has a slightly harder edge than what you see in film, I have no complaints.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

Jeff is also an unemployed 30-year old living in his mother's basement, so yeah, there's that. Jeff's brother, Pat (Ed Helms), is a clueless salesman who doesn't realize his marriage is on the rocks until the day he catches his wife (Judy Greer) with another man. Jeff's mom (Susan Sarandon) struggles to deal with her two deadbeat sons. Throughout the course of that day, Jeff and Pat are determined to find out if Pat's wife is having an affair. Instead, their journey allows them to find themselves and each other.When I saw that the cast consisted of Jason Segal, Ed Helms and Judy Greer, my thoughts immediately drifted to Judd Apatow's raunchy productions. Friends, don't let the title or casting fool you, this movie is no such thing. I can't ever recall watching something directed by the Duplass brothers so this was my first experience with their style of directing. Though it wasn't quite what I expected, admittedly, I was impressed. I thought this movie was going to be your run-of-the-mill comedy with little meaning or value, but I was mistaken. Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a dramedy that functions as a character study more than anything. It takes us deep into the lives of three exceedingly unhappy people and their meaningless existences. There were definitely comedic moments but the movie also had me crying at the very end (which is a rarity for me).Another notable thing is the lack of a big budget which allows for the focus to be more on the dialogue and in character development. But this isn't a problem because it's these things that make the movie so special. The Duplass brothers have shown us seemingly unlikable characters and managed by the end of the film to make them very likable. This is also a testament to the strength of the actors as well. Segal, Helms and Sarandon are totally believable in their portrayal of the unhappy family dynamic and yet are still completely charming at the same time. They are realistically flawed and they suffer, lacking in purpose and looking for redemption. The Duplass brothers use that suffering to fuel much of the comedy in the film and the juxtaposition, in this case, works. These characters get you thinking and reflecting on their growth both as individuals and as a family.I think the thing that is most impressive about the film is how it begins with a sign (the movie Signs, actually) and each action and interaction builds upon the one before it. Jeff, Who Lives at Home starts off with the characters, each on their own, but during the course of the film their stories steadily collide and intertwine, showing us that these people are more connected than they ever realized. Fate is a key theme here and all events culminate in them figuring out what his/her own destiny really is. It's a truly remarkable movie because of its honesty and sincerity. It will tickle both your funny bone and your heartstrings.Food for Thought: Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a bit of a thinker that leaves you reeling by the very end. It's an endearing story about destiny, family and love. Chalk full of smart humour, it's totally worth the time if you're looking for a memorable film that takes a deeper look into the flaws of man (and woman).

I had seen a preview in the theatre a few times, and really was looking forward to this.""Jeff, Who Lives At Home"" (83 min.) brings several parallel stories. As the title of the movie gives away, Jeff (played by Jason Segel) is a 30 yr. old good-at-nothing pothead who lives in the basement of his mom's house. The film opens as Jeff explains why ""Signs"" is his all-time favorite movie, and he is desparately looking for signs around him to get some direction in his life. Then there is Jeff's older brother Pat (played by Ed Helms), whose marriage is in serious trouble, the latest problem being that he bought a Porsche against the wishes of his wife (played by Judy Greer), who herself may actually be having an affair with a co-worker. Last but not least there is Mom (played delightfully by Susan Sarandon), who gets contacted at work by a co-worker claiming to be a secret admirer. Meanwhile Mom is concerned about Jeff and Pat in more ways than one.The movie plays out in a single day, and all the parallel stories come together in the last 10-15 min. of the movie. I don't want to reveal any further plot points, you'll just have to see if for yourself. While the movie is of course billed as a comedy, there are some serious emotional undercurrents in this movie that are just as effective, if not longer lasting than a quick laugh here or there. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. That said, I could've enjoyed the movie even more, were it not for the borderline headache-inducing editing style of the movie. Indeed almost every scene contains non-stop moving of the camera, extreme close ups, and for good measure some more zooming in and out for seemingly no reason at all. It almost ruined the movie for me, to be honest.

Jeff is a bum who lives in his mother's basement, and his brother Pat is married, has an apartment and a job, and just bought a Porsche. However, Jeff seems to be the more kindhearted of the two, believes in destiny and fate, and spends the whole movie in sweatshirt and shorts. This quirky film takes Jeff and Pat on an eccentric journey that strengthens the bond of brotherhood between them more than ever before. Pat has to learn how to love his wife (played by Judy Greer -- 13 Going on 30; 27 Dresses) better, and Jeff follows the strange clue of the random name &#34;Kevin&#34; that he believes destiny has sent him. While this is going, their mother (played by Susan Sarandon -- The Lovely Bones, Little Women, Shall We Dance, The Company You Keep) seems to have a secret admirer at work.

Emotionally stalled since the death of his father several years earlier, Jeff spends his days smoking marijuana and watching the movie ""Signs,"" convinced that his destiny will depend on recognizing and paying attention to portents.When Jeff receives a wrong-number phone call and the caller asks for Kevin, Jeff regards this as a sign.  On a bus, he spots a kid with ""Kevin"" imprinted on the back of his jersey and spends the rest of the day following him.  The kid gets off the bus and later Jeff hitches onto a truck with ""Kevin Candy"" written on its side.  Jeff is convinced these are subtle signs ... of something.Jeff's older brother, Pat (Ed Helms), lives in a small apartment with wife Linda (Judy Greer), works in a paint supply store, and wants to have as little to do with Jeff as possible.  But Pat enlists the reluctant help of his brother to investigate when he sees Linda at a restaurant with a strange man and suspects she is having an affair.The brothers' mom, Sharon (Susan Sarandon), an office worker frustrated by Jeff's inability to focus, calls him several times a day, and is at the far end of her patience.Writers/directors Jay and Mark Duplass (""Cyrus,"" ""Baghead"") have crafted a character-driven story about relationships, a feat that is becoming increasingly rare in American films.  The movie has a non-rushed, leisurely pace as it introduces us to each of the three principal characters in turn.  We first see each of them alone, which allows them to reveal more of themselves than people ordinarily do when others are around.We don`t quite know what to make of Jeff at first.  Is he merely a pothead and is the movie yet another stoner comedy, or is there more to him than what first appears?  Pat is more clearly defined, since his life seems normal, though he is more troubled than he is willing to acknowledge.  The Duplass brothers delve deeply into these two men to explore why they are what they are.There are amusing moments, to be sure, though ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" is not what you'd call a rollicking slapstick romp.  The film will bring many smiles to your face, but its inherent humanity renders both Jeff and Pat genuine people just trying to make their way through life as best they can.  Though on the surface complete opposites, their time together at a point of crisis draws out similarities.  Surprisingly, Jeff offers some wisdom while Pat, the steady citizen, flounders.The best aspect of the movie is its authenticity.  We see people in embarrassing moments, watch them awkwardly attempt to navigate them, and are struck by the believability of their actions.  Though the movie is clearly scripted, some scenes have a spontaneous, ad-lib feel, so that not every line is a set-up for a punchline.  Though this reduces the laughter quotient, it enhances character credibility.Segal's Jeff -- called a sasquatch by brother Pat -- is a hulking man-boy with a laid-back innocence that's a product of too much weed and too little sense of purpose.  Segal infuses comic touches throughout the movie, yet keeps the character grounded, never overdoing his performance for the laugh.  His manner of speaking is calm, thoughtful, and lacks any trace of anger or indignation.  This contrasts markedly with Helms' Pat, a tightly-coiled spring initially blind to the fact that his marriage is deteriorating.Rated R, ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" contains some strong language, drug use, and a bit of violence.  At a streamlined 83 minutes, the film takes an interesting, offbeat look at relationships, highlighting the trials and foibles of folks trying to find meaning and happiness in their lives.",3,A Look at a Quirky Relationship,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3777,"['Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'title', 'character', 'Jason', 'Segal', '30-something', 'single', 'guy', 'who', 'basement', 'mother', 'house', 'Emotionally', 'stalled', 'death', 'father', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'Jeff', 'days', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'watching', 'movie', 'Signs', 'convinced', 'destiny', 'will', 'depend', 'recognizing', 'paying', 'attention', 'portents.When', 'Jeff', 'wrong-number', 'phone', 'call', 'caller', 'Kevin', 'Jeff', 'sign', 'bus', 'spots', 'kid', 'Kevin', 'imprinted', 'back', 'jersey', 'rest', 'day', 'following', 'kid', 'bus', 'later', 'Jeff', 'hitches', 'truck', 'Kevin', 'Candy', 'written', 'side', 'Jeff', 'convinced', 'are', 'subtle', 'signs', 'something.Jeff', 'older', 'brother', 'Pat', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'small', 'apartment', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'paint', 'supply', 'store', 'have', 'as', 'little', 'do', 'Jeff', 'possible', 'Pat', 'reluctant', 'help', 'brother', 'investigate', 'when', 'Linda', 'restaurant', 'strange', 'man', 'having', 'affair.The', 'brothers', 'mom', 'Sharon', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'office', 'worker', 'frustrated', 'Jeff', 'inability', 'focus', 'several', 'times', 'day', 'far', 'end', 'patience.Writers/directors', 'Jay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Cyrus', 'Baghead', 'have', 'crafted', 'character-driven', 'story', 'relationships', 'feat', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'American', 'films', 'movie', 'non-rushed', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'three', 'principal', 'characters', 'turn', 'first', 'see', 'alone', 'reveal', 'more', 'people', 'ordinarily', 'do', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'around.We', 'don', 't', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Jeff', 'first', 'merely', 'pothead', 'movie', 'yet', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'there', 'more', 'what', 'first', 'Pat', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'life', 'normal', 'more', 'troubled', 'willing', 'acknowledge', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'delve', 'deeply', 'two', 'men', 'explore', 'why', 'are', 'what', 'are.There', 'are', 'amusing', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'rollicking', 'slapstick', 'romp', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'many', 'smiles', 'face', 'inherent', 'humanity', 'renders', 'Jeff', 'Pat', 'genuine', 'people', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'Though', 'surface', 'complete', 'opposites', 'time', 'together', 'point', 'crisis', 'draws', 'similarities', 'Surprisingly', 'Jeff', 'wisdom', 'Pat', 'steady', 'citizen', 'flounders.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'authenticity', 'see', 'people', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'watch', 'awkwardly', 'attempt', 'navigate', 'are', 'struck', 'believability', 'actions', 'movie', 'clearly', 'scripted', 'scenes', 'have', 'spontaneous', 'ad-lib', 'feel', 'not', 'line', 'set-up', 'punchline', 'laughter', 'quotient', 'character', 'credibility.Segal', 'Jeff', 'called', 'sasquatch', 'brother', 'Pat', 'hulking', 'man-boy', 'laid-back', 'innocence', 'product', 'too', 'much', 'weed', 'too', 'little', 'sense', 'purpose', 'Segal', 'comic', 'touches', 'movie', 'yet', 'character', 'grounded', 'never', 'overdoing', 'performance', 'laugh', 'manner', 'speaking', 'calm', 'thoughtful', 'trace', 'anger', 'indignation', 'markedly', 'Helms', 'Pat', 'tightly-coiled', 'spring', 'initially', 'fact', 'marriage', 'deteriorating.Rated', 'R', 'Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'strong', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'bit', 'violence', 'streamlined', '83', 'minutes', 'film', 'interesting', 'offbeat', 'look', 'relationships', 'highlighting', 'trials', 'foibles', 'folks', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'happiness', 'lives']",Jeff: Who Lives at Home

Meanwhile their long suffering mum played by the wonderful Susan Sarandon ( I love her because she was in `The Rocky Horror Picture Show') is in a job with a secret admirer and she thinks things might be looking up, if only she could get her lazy son off the sofa.This is a movie that wants to be quirky and it sort of gets there and it wants to be funny and I did laugh on at least two occasions, but it was more the schadenfreude kind of thing, where you laugh at others misfortunes, which is what the movie was playing for. It is though a caring film; relationships are at the core as well as misplaced value in material things and the belief that looking at things from a different angle can bring massive rewards.It has a run time of just under an hour and a half and it flows by in a reassured pace. I actually quite enjoyed it, this is not laugh out loud or `riotous' but it is warm, amusing and ultimately entertaining, the sort that warms the cockles of your heart as they used to say in my Grand dads day.",4,We Don't Need to Talk about Kevin,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1993,"['Jeff', '30', 'successfully', 'unemployed', 'living', 'mothers', 'basement', 'experimenting', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'watching', 'TV', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'wrong', 'number', 'call', 'someone', 'called', 'Kevin', 'decides', 'sign', 'fave', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'classic', 'Signs', 'know', 'one', 'crop', 'circles', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'thinks', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'so', 'random', 'moment', 'will', 'lead', 'possible', 'destiny', 'thankfully', 'when', 'teenager', 'bus', 'Kevin', 'T', 'Shirt', 'so', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'off', 'hot', 'well', 'luke', 'warm', 'pursuit.Jeff', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Love', 'Man', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'also', 'brother', 'Pat', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Hangover', 'who', 'turning', 'point', 'relationship', 'state', 'finances', 'buying', 'Porsche', 'will', 'help', 'then', 'wife', 'man', 'Enlisting', 'help', 'Jeff', 'set', 'off', 'warmish', 'pursuit', 'pair', 'Meanwhile', 'long', 'suffering', 'mum', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'love', 'was', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'job', 'secret', 'admirer', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'up', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'lazy', 'son', 'sofa.This', 'movie', 'be', 'quirky', 'sort', 'there', 'be', 'funny', 'did', 'laugh', 'least', 'two', 'occasions', 'was', 'more', 'schadenfreude', 'kind', 'thing', 'where', 'laugh', 'others', 'misfortunes', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'caring', 'film', 'relationships', 'are', 'core', 'as', 'well', 'misplaced', 'value', 'material', 'things', 'belief', 'looking', 'things', 'different', 'angle', 'can', 'bring', 'massive', 'rewards.It', 'run', 'time', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'reassured', 'pace', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'riotous', 'warm', 'amusing', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'sort', 'cockles', 'heart', 'used', 'say', 'Grand', 'day']",Jeff: Who Lives at Home

After receiving a phone call from a wrong number Jeff (Segel) thinks that the call has a deeper reason. His mom (Sarandon) calls and asks him to run an errand for him. What starts as a simple trip to a hardware store begins to evolve and change the lives of everyone Jeff comes into contact with, including his brother Pat (Helms). This is another movie that is almost nothing like the preview. The preview made it seem much funnier then it was. While this did have some funny parts in it I found this movie to be more sweet and heartfelt then I expected. Some of the aspects of the movie are very serious but they are done in a way that tone it down. Segel is just about the perfect choice for this role because there is just something about him that you find disarming and comfortable no matter what he is doing. If you are looking for a typical Segel comedy this is not it. This one has more substance and heart and is very much worth watching. Overall, if you liked ""Everything Must Go"" then this movie is for you. I recommend this but this is again not your average comedy. I give it a B+.",4,More of a drama then a comedy but very good.

1533268,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B007L6VPL4,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[7, 13]","Jay and Mark Duplass may hate the term ""mumblecore"", but their low budgeted indie films have become synonymous with intuitive, sharp comedies unafraid to explore relationships with real depth. Through a handful of films they've managed to avoid falling into the trap laid by Hollywood movies, which usually means cutting emotional corners to reach some sort of unearned happy ending. Not even a step into the mainstream with 2010's Cyrus, really Jonah Hill's finest performance of his young career, could steer them into the land of cliche.No, it took Jeff, Who Lives At Home for the Duplass's to fall off their game. A heavy handed and mostly incoherent fable about destiny, the film is randomly funny thanks mostly to its charming cast. Jason Segel is Jeff, a lovable stoner going nowhere in life, 30 years old and living at home with his mom, Sharon.(Susan Sarandon) For a guy stuck in the present, Jeff is obsessed with the future, looking for clues to his destiny anywhere he can find them, drawing inspiration from M. Night Shyamalan's Signs. On the other end of the spectrum is his older brother, Pat(Ed Helms), an aggressive ball of nervous energy with a perpetual chip on his shoulder. When we first meet him in the midst of an early mid-life crisis, he's fighting a familiar verbal war with his wife(Judy Greer) over his irresponsible spending and chronic inattentiveness.A mistaken phone call from a person looking for ""Kevin"", combined with his mother's desire to see him actually leave the house, sends Jeff on a citywide trek full of randomness and extreme coincidence. Jeff sees the controlling hand of fate in everything: a pick-up game of basketball, a delivery truck, whatever. The signs seem to be guiding him somewhere, and it's directly into his brother, leading the two on one epic day full of strange occurrences and twists of divine providence. Segel and Helms make for a pretty powerful comedic duo, but the lackadaisical plot does them no favors. Helms in particular thrives in an environment of rapid fire comedy, which this certainly isn't. It lounges somewhere in between, struggling to create avenues for Segel's gift of physical humor. He's just a naturally funny guy, and yet that is stunted a little bit here by all the mystical mumbo jumbo.Where the film finds the most solid footing is in the exploration of Pat and Linda's marriage, and we see again why Judy Greer is one of the most underrated actresses working today. Why isn't she a bigger star? Their relationship is never given enough screen time, but in just a few minutes we can sense how lived in their home feels , and how they've both become too comfortable to even bother getting angry with one another. This is the Duplass sweet spot, navigating those uncomfortable emotional corners most films won't dare tread. We could be talking about this as one of the year's great movies if only their marriage had been the centerpiece, rather than just a small part of the broken puzzle.Because Sarandon needed something more to do than just sit on the phone, a pointless storyline about a secret admirer in her office is tacked on. The only real good coming out of it is that we get to see Rae Dawn Chong in something relevant again. At least the conclusion has some energy to it,  a crescendo of chance, dramatic revelations and even a life or death moment. Too bad it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and feels like a desperate attempt to have everybody walk away happy and properly schooled. The Duplass's have traded away authenticity in favor of accessibility, a bad deal by any measure.",2,The weakest film from the Duplass Brothers yet,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3584,"['Jay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'may', 'hate', 'term', 'mumblecore', 'low', 'budgeted', 'indie', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'synonymous', 'intuitive', 'sharp', 'comedies', 'unafraid', 'explore', 'relationships', 'real', 'depth', 'handful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'avoid', 'falling', 'trap', 'laid', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'usually', 'cutting', 'emotional', 'corners', 'reach', 'sort', 'unearned', 'happy', 'ending', 'Not', 'even', 'step', 'mainstream', '2010', 'Cyrus', 'really', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'finest', 'performance', 'young', 'career', 'could', 'steer', 'land', 'cliche.No', 'took', 'Jeff', 'Who', 'Home', 'Duplass', 'fall', 'off', 'game', 'A', 'heavy', 'handed', 'mostly', 'incoherent', 'fable', 'destiny', 'film', 'randomly', 'funny', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'charming', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Jeff', 'lovable', 'stoner', 'going', 'nowhere', 'life', '30', 'years', 'old', 'living', 'home', 'mom', 'Sharon', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'guy', 'stuck', 'present', 'Jeff', 'obsessed', 'future', 'looking', 'clues', 'destiny', 'anywhere', 'can', 'find', 'drawing', 'inspiration', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Signs', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'older', 'brother', 'Pat', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'aggressive', 'ball', 'nervous', 'energy', 'perpetual', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'midst', 'early', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'fighting', 'familiar', 'verbal', 'war', 'wife', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'irresponsible', 'spending', 'chronic', 'inattentiveness.A', 'mistaken', 'phone', 'call', 'person', 'looking', 'Kevin', 'combined', 'mother', 'desire', 'see', 'actually', 'leave', 'house', 'Jeff', 'citywide', 'full', 'randomness', 'extreme', 'coincidence', 'Jeff', 'controlling', 'hand', 'fate', 'everything', 'pick-up', 'game', 'basketball', 'delivery', 'truck', 'signs', 'seem', 'be', 'guiding', 'somewhere', 'directly', 'brother', 'leading', 'two', 'one', 'epic', 'day', 'full', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'twists', 'divine', 'providence', 'Segel', 'Helms', 'make', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'comedic', 'duo', 'lackadaisical', 'plot', 'favors', 'Helms', 'particular', 'thrives', 'environment', 'rapid', 'fire', 'comedy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'somewhere', 'struggling', 'create', 'avenues', 'Segel', 'gift', 'physical', 'humor', 'just', 'naturally', 'funny', 'guy', 'yet', 'stunted', 'little', 'bit', 'here', 'mystical', 'mumbo', 'film', 'most', 'solid', 'footing', 'exploration', 'Pat', 'Linda', 'marriage', 'see', 'again', 'why', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'Why', ""n't"", 'bigger', 'star', 'relationship', 'never', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'can', 'sense', 'how', 'lived', 'home', 'feels', 'how', ""'ve"", 'become', 'too', 'comfortable', 'even', 'bother', 'getting', 'angry', 'one', 'Duplass', 'sweet', 'spot', 'navigating', 'uncomfortable', 'emotional', 'corners', 'most', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dare', 'tread', 'could', 'be', 'talking', 'about', 'one', 'year', 'great', 'movies', 'only', 'marriage', 'had', 'been', 'centerpiece', 'rather', 'just', 'small', 'part', 'broken', 'puzzle.Because', 'Sarandon', 'needed', 'something', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'sit', 'phone', 'pointless', 'storyline', 'secret', 'admirer', 'office', 'tacked', 'only', 'real', 'good', 'coming', 'get', 'see', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'something', 'relevant', 'again', 'least', 'conclusion', 'energy', 'crescendo', 'chance', 'dramatic', 'revelations', 'even', 'life', 'death', 'moment', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'feels', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'have', 'everybody', 'walk', 'away', 'happy', 'properly', 'schooled', 'Duplass', 'have', 'traded', 'away', 'authenticity', 'favor', 'accessibility', 'bad', 'deal', 'measure']",Jeff: Who Lives at Home
