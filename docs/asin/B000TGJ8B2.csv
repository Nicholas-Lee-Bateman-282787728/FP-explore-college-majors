If that isn't reason enough to buy this set I don't know what is.  Just like the individual season sets, many many episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband"" are included as well as audio interviews with show creators, flubs, cast biographies and the original animated Lucy and Desi intro and outro at the commercial break.  It's an incredible amount of history and insight that's a joy to find all in one place.  And special to this release is extra disc featuring the never-before-released I Love Lucy Movie as well as a fully colorized episode and a few other fun bonuses.It's lovely to have the series so beautifully presented.  I mean that in terms of the picture and audio quality as well as the DVD packaging.  The discs are in two paper and cardboard accordion style cases with a large size booklet so you can find the episode you want to watch.  The only complaint I have (and it's minor) is that the images of Lucy aren't on the actual box but on a clear plastic box encasing the heart which makes getting at the DVDs a bit more difficult than it should be.  Also I fear the plastic box will rip or tear after repeated openings.  The only option is to display the set without the slip case, but then the packaging is not as eye catching.  It's a testament to the excellent work done on this set that a packaging gripe is the most negative thing I can say.

1089811,A1VFICSYK056GC,B000TGJ8B2,Dr. Dario J. Toncich,"[4, 6]","Having recently viewed some 80s and 90s sitcoms I realized how quickly (and badly) television comedy can date.  Age really does weary them and the years condemn.  This is partly due to repetition and partly because the comedy probably wasn't all that good to begin with.In a radio interview in 2008, Jerry Lewis noted that modern comedians had told him that his visual style of comedy was out of date - he responded that visual comedy never went out of date, it's just that modern comedians don't have the discipline or the work ethic to pull it off.  Lewis hit the nail on the head - modern comedians, often lacking maturity; life experience; breadth of skills or even a willingness to serve a long-term comedic apprenticeship simply don't have the tools to create lasting comedy.  If we accept that comedic talent doesn't just fall out of the sky - and that it does require years (decades) of hard work, then we have a real problem.  We now have a television industry that doesn't want anyone over the age of 25 appearing in their shows and the result is a collection of sitcoms that are little more than strings of sarcastic one-liners in which every line has been audience tested for reaction.  Mechanical, formula-driven, repetitive and time limited.Lucille Ball was (still is) one of the all-time comedy greats of American television - whether at visual comedy; slapstick; pathos; quick one-liners or any other facet of what makes us laugh.  Combine Lucille Ball with an  ensemble of other highly skilled and experienced performers like Desi Arnaz; Vivian Vance and William Frawley and you have all the basics for a timeless comedy.  Superimpose upon this some brilliant scriptwriting and you have ""I Love Lucy"".  Almost six decades old and still as funny as ever.  And you can bet that it will still be just as funny in another six decades - Seinfeld got tiresome after one decade, despite being hailed as the comedy guru of the 1990s.The only downside of watching the nearly 200 episodes in this collection is that eventually you'll have to go back to watching the current crop of sitcoms, only to be even more disappointed with them than you were before.  That's when you have to unpack the first DVD in this box set and start viewing I Love Lucy all over again.This collection is cheap at twice the price.If you are interested in this then you should also consider buying the other comedic genius of the era - Groucho Marx in ""You Bet Your Life"".",5,Timeless Comedy Never Goes Out of Style,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2456,"['Having', 'recently', 'viewed', '80s', '90s', 'sitcoms', 'realized', 'how', 'quickly', 'badly', 'television', 'comedy', 'can', 'date', 'Age', 'really', 'weary', 'years', 'condemn', 'partly', 'due', 'repetition', 'partly', 'comedy', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'begin', 'with.In', 'radio', 'interview', '2008', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'noted', 'modern', 'comedians', 'had', 'told', 'visual', 'style', 'comedy', 'was', 'date', 'responded', 'visual', 'comedy', 'never', 'went', 'date', 'just', 'modern', 'comedians', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'discipline', 'work', 'ethic', 'pull', 'off', 'Lewis', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'modern', 'comedians', 'often', 'lacking', 'maturity', 'life', 'experience', 'breadth', 'skills', 'even', 'willingness', 'serve', 'long-term', 'comedic', 'apprenticeship', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tools', 'create', 'lasting', 'comedy', 'accept', 'comedic', 'talent', ""n't"", 'just', 'fall', 'out', 'sky', 'require', 'years', 'decades', 'hard', 'work', 'then', 'have', 'real', 'problem', 'now', 'have', 'television', 'industry', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'age', '25', 'appearing', 'shows', 'result', 'collection', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'strings', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'line', 'been', 'audience', 'tested', 'reaction', 'Mechanical', 'formula-driven', 'repetitive', 'time', 'limited.Lucille', 'Ball', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'all-time', 'comedy', 'greats', 'American', 'television', 'visual', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'quick', 'one-liners', 'other', 'facet', 'what', 'Combine', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'ensemble', 'other', 'highly', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'performers', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'William', 'Frawley', 'have', 'basics', 'timeless', 'comedy', 'Superimpose', 'brilliant', 'scriptwriting', 'have', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Almost', 'six', 'decades', 'old', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'can', 'bet', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'just', 'funny', 'six', 'decades', 'Seinfeld', 'got', 'tiresome', 'one', 'decade', 'being', 'hailed', 'comedy', 'guru', '1990s.The', 'only', 'downside', 'watching', 'nearly', '200', 'episodes', 'collection', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'back', 'watching', 'current', 'crop', 'sitcoms', 'only', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed', 'were', 'before', 'when', 'have', 'unpack', 'first', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'start', 'viewing', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'again.This', 'collection', 'cheap', 'twice', 'price.If', 'are', 'interested', 'then', 'should', 'also', 'consider', 'buying', 'other', 'comedic', 'genius', 'era', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'Bet', 'Life']",I Love Lucy: The Complete Series

The sleeves for the seasons are color coded as well making a visual attraction that reminded my wife of an old juke-box.The discs are extremely crisp and clear on the screen. The menu offers only Spanish subtitles, but with the cc set to on on my television there were  English subtitles on the screen.

1089824,A1NDYG7YCATPLD,B000TGJ8B2,Gregory A. Moorehead,"[5, 5]","Earlier this year with some trepidation, I finally purchased ""I Love Lucy--the Complete Series"".  Like most Amazon shoppers, I always read the reviews before purchasing items, and when this product first came to market many of the Amazon reviews were luke-warm.  One common criticism was the packaging.  Aside from the clear outer sleeve, I find the packaging to be durable, attractive and unique.  I especially like the accordion disc holders, of which there are two--one holding seasons 1-3, and the other holding seasons 4-9.  In addition, there is a nicely produced episode guide. All of the contents are enclosed in a box, topped with the familiar, heart-shaped ""I Love Lucy"" logo.  I've been a Lucy fan for more than 35 years, and there's very little about ""I Love Lucy I don't know. The ""I Love Lucy Movie"" is really three episodes of the series linked together with behind the scenes footage that was never released. Still, to any ""Lucy"" fan this is pure gold! And while I'm not a fan of colorization, the technique employed on the ""Lucy Goes to Scotland"" episode rings more authentic than earlier colorization efforts. It's so interesting to see the different colors on the clothing and the sets, not to mention Lucy's hair.  The complete set includes the ""Lost Pilot"", the ""Christmas Show"" from 1956, and all thirteen Lucy-Desi hour-long specials, which were produced after ""I Love Lucy"" ended.

Then I started watching The Lucy Show. Unfortunately, that was on at 2am, so I never saw much of it. I am so glad that The Lucy Show - not to mention Here's Lucy and various Lucille Ball specials - are now almost finished being released on DVD as well! I Love Lucy will always be my favorite of the 3 series. The Lucy Show was aimed more at a younger audience, I think. Here's Lucy brought it back up a notch. But I Love Lucy is definitely the classiest! Lucille Ball paired with Vivian Vance gives I Love Lucy something the other 2 shows just couldn't imitate. Lucy and Ethel. What a pair. Everyone should have a friend like that! And of course Lucille Ball with Desi Arnaz. Lucy occasionally got a potential boyfriend on the other 2 shows, but he was always gone by the next episode! The romance, the two of them together, the two couples either fighting or scheming together... great comedy! And then of course there was William Frawley. He was a great foil. I always liked him better than Gale Gordon. Mr. Mooney/Harry could be so mean! Fred could be gruff, but his heart of gold always shined through.I don't own this actual item. I bought the individual seasons as they came out and wanted to review the series as a whole. It's just as well. I notice that, like most complete series, a lot of buyers think the design of the big box is poor for storing discs safely and conveniently. And, of course,I Love Lucy: The Movie and Other Great Raritieshas been released on its own since then. And how awesome that ""Lucy Goes to Scotland,"" one of my favorite episodes, is the episode they chose to colorize as a special feature on that disc! So cool!Here are some of my favorite episodes:""Lucy Goes to Scotland,"" of course: Lucy dreams she is going to be eaten by a 2-headed Fred and Ethel dragonPretty much all the Europe episodes, really...""Lucy and Bob Hope,"": I've seen their 4 movies together, so it's always fun to watch them interact""The Operetta,"": Vivian Vance really shines in this one; I just wish her song was longer""Ricky Minds the Baby,"": Ricky tells Little Red Riding Hood in Spanish!""Home Movies,"": Lucy and Ethel are cowboys... backwards""The Great Train Robbery,"": just ridiculous!""Lucy Meets Tallulah Bankhead,"": I know that's a comedy hour, but oh well""Bull Fight Dance,"": for once, the bull is full of Lucy!""Lucy Thinks Ricky is Trying to Murder Her,"": first episode filmed, a little uneven and also implausible, but very funnyI could totally go on!Out of the 3 ""big ones""... that is, ""chocolate factory,"" ""grape stomping,"" and ""vitameatavegamin,"" I would go with ""chocolate factory.""

1089831,AHRQOLXJE4CBV,B000TGJ8B2,"JACK LOBO ""ljb926""","[4, 5]","There were many great TV shows that came out in the 1950s. But three shows come to mind that are as popular today as they were back then. The Honeymooners, The Adventures Of Superman, and of course I Love Lucy. The longest running first-run of the three. However, this is not a lesson in 1950s television, nor is it a history of I Love Lucy. The goal of this review is to let potential buyers make an informed decision. Getting the most enjoyment and ease of use will depend on two basic elements. Common sense and shelf space dimensions. First cut the tape that hold the flap of the clear plastic case. Next, slide the box set out. I made a personal choice to cut off the left side flap  for ease of sliding the box set in and out. With the front of the box set facing you, lift the big red heart and place to the side. Inside you will find a booklet. Remove the booklet. This will give you easy access to the disc holders. The left side holder holds the special bonus disc and Seasons 1 through 3. The right side holder holds Season 4 through 6 for the regular I Love Lucy show and Seasons 7 through 9 for the continuation spin off series The Lucille-Desi Comedy Hour. 17 discs per holder. 34 discs in all and with bonus features on all of them. Now, here comes the commom sense part. Do not turn the box set upside down as this will cause all your discs to fall all over the floor. A reviewer did write that all their discs went all over the floor, but either deleted their review or edited that part out. Let us begin. Select the holder of your choice. Hold the accordion style disc holder facing toward you in one hand. With the other hand, use your fingers in the same manner as searching for a file in a filing cabinet, use  sensible gentleness to search for the disc of choice. When you find it, just widen the gap a little to allow the disc to be lifted easily. Use the same method to place the disc back. If by chance you happen to be one handed use something else to support the holder. If these simple instructions are followed the disc holders should never rip or tear. Now for the the shelf space dimensions. This will affect different people in different ways. If you have a clearance height of at least nine inches on your shelf the box set can be displayed upright in a sideview position like any other disc or box set. A depth of 12 inches on your shelf from front to back would be optimal, but 8 inches is enough to keep it from falling to the floor. If you still feel you lack the common sense and/or the accomodations to store this set then stick with or purchase the regular I Love Lucy Seasons 1 through 6 box set and the Lucy-Desi Seasons 7-9 to get almost the same thing as this box set. I don't know if the special bonus disc is or will be available for purchase.

My wife & I watched the entire series (no, not in one sitting) and sat & laughed ourselves silly. Of course, you see basically the same episodes running on a daily basis on some channel somewhere, but to be able to watch them all in the order they were televised was fascinating. The pilot episode, which takes place in a totally different apartment, makes you realize how primitive early television was. There's a parade of character actors & actresses throughout the series that you recognize from other TV shows & film work. Everyone works together so well, the chemistry is incredible.

1089839,ASD62GZ68WX7X,B000TGJ8B2,Jeannie,"[2, 2]","I'm not going to comment on the quality of the I Love Lucy shows. I do not feel that this is the place for that. Instead, the quality of the DVDs, packaging, etc. is what should be reviewed. First, the packaging was a bit overdone but still delivered the important content, the DVDs themselves, in excellent condition. Inside the fancy outer plastic case were two accordion fold folders that contained the DVDs. I've seen reviewers complain that their disks were damaged by the folders and would have preferred jewel cases for each DVD. My DVDs were in excellent condition and I'm glad they were not in jewel cases because they would have taken up ten or more times the amount of room. The box with the folders keeps everything corralled in a minimal amount of space. If they had eliminated the big cardboard heart on top, it would have been even more compact.The content on the DVDs was excellent! The first disk was a bonus disk I didn't watch because I wanted to dive into the series. I'm glad I did because much of what is on it is also found on the other disks. Others may feel it is all worth watching.The episodes were all digitally remastered and, whenever possible, deleted footage was restored. The picture was clear and sharp, better than anything I've ever seen on TV. Each disk also contains bonus features, such as original openings and closings which had been deleted when edited for reruns because of the advertising content or to allow more room for commercials, ""flubs,"" behind the scenes notes, guest star credits (with bios), and an episode of Lucy's radio show, ""My Favorite Husband."" If the only available replacement for missing footage was of too poor a quality to include with the episode, the missing footage was included separately in the bonus section. The bonus section of each disk is well worth watching.The only complaints I have was occasionally some of the clothing the actors wore would have fine lines or dots which would create moir&eacute; patterns on screen which would make the clothing appear iridescent  or even flashing at times. I feel the editors could have taken a little more time to eliminate, or at least reduce, these. It didn't happen often but it still was a bit distracting. Two or three episodes had a scene or two that briefly displayed unnecessary Spanish subtitles. If I wanted to see Spanish subtitles, I would have selected them. A few episodes were preceded with a written announcement In Spanish. My high school Spanish is rather rusty (more like corroded) but it appeared they were apologizing that they didn't have Spanish subtitles or dubbing for the following episode. I feel that should have been shown only if Spanish had been selected. I feel these are very minor complaints, especially in light of the excellent quality of everything else.Considering the number of disks, the amazingly high quality of the video, and the bonus material included, this set is an incredible bargain.",5,Pity I can't give this six stars.,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,2949,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'quality', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'place', 'Instead', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'packaging', 'etc', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'reviewed', 'First', 'packaging', 'was', 'bit', 'overdone', 'still', 'delivered', 'important', 'content', 'DVDs', 'excellent', 'condition', 'fancy', 'outer', 'plastic', 'case', 'were', 'two', 'accordion', 'fold', 'folders', 'contained', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'disks', 'were', 'damaged', 'folders', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'jewel', 'cases', 'DVD', 'DVDs', 'were', 'excellent', 'condition', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'not', 'jewel', 'cases', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'ten', 'more', 'times', 'amount', 'room', 'box', 'folders', 'keeps', 'everything', 'corralled', 'minimal', 'amount', 'space', 'had', 'eliminated', 'big', 'cardboard', 'heart', 'top', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'compact.The', 'content', 'DVDs', 'was', 'excellent', 'first', 'disk', 'was', 'bonus', 'disk', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'wanted', 'dive', 'series', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'much', 'what', 'also', 'found', 'other', 'disks', 'Others', 'may', 'feel', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'episodes', 'were', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'whenever', 'possible', 'deleted', 'footage', 'was', 'restored', 'picture', 'was', 'clear', 'sharp', 'better', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'disk', 'also', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'original', 'openings', 'closings', 'had', 'been', 'deleted', 'when', 'edited', 'reruns', 'advertising', 'content', 'allow', 'more', 'room', 'commercials', 'flubs', 'scenes', 'notes', 'guest', 'star', 'credits', 'bios', 'episode', 'Lucy', 'radio', 'show', 'Favorite', 'Husband', 'only', 'available', 'replacement', 'missing', 'footage', 'was', 'too', 'poor', 'quality', 'include', 'episode', 'missing', 'footage', 'was', 'included', 'separately', 'bonus', 'section', 'bonus', 'section', 'disk', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'only', 'complaints', 'have', 'was', 'occasionally', 'clothing', 'actors', 'wore', 'would', 'have', 'fine', 'lines', 'dots', 'would', 'create', 'moir', 'eacute', 'patterns', 'screen', 'would', 'make', 'clothing', 'appear', 'iridescent', 'even', 'flashing', 'times', 'feel', 'editors', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'eliminate', 'least', 'reduce', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'still', 'was', 'bit', 'distracting', 'Two', 'three', 'episodes', 'had', 'scene', 'two', 'briefly', 'displayed', 'unnecessary', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'wanted', 'see', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'selected', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'preceded', 'written', 'announcement', 'Spanish', 'high', 'school', 'Spanish', 'rather', 'rusty', 'more', 'corroded', 'appeared', 'were', 'apologizing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'dubbing', 'following', 'episode', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'only', 'Spanish', 'had', 'been', 'selected', 'feel', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'complaints', 'especially', 'light', 'excellent', 'quality', 'everything', 'else.Considering', 'number', 'disks', 'amazingly', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'bonus', 'material', 'included', 'set', 'incredible', 'bargain']",I Love Lucy: The Complete Series

She really invented the modern television program. The things that we take for granted today were all because of this classic sitcom. It was all brand-new for her and when you watch these eps now it all looks like Lucy was doing it for years and years. But that doesn't mean that she also doesn't look and sound fresh and funny. Lucy was such a kook. Or maybe clown is a better word to describe her because there isn't another person on this planet that will go to such great lengths just to make someone else laugh.It's sad to think that TV these days isn't even one one-millionth as good as ""I Love Lucy"" always was. Like many people, I do not watch the reality potluck garbage that broadcast network TV has lazily morphed into. Instead, I'd rather read a book. Or watch ""I Love Lucy.""Some have said that Lucille Ball wasn't acting on ""I Love Lucy,"" that she was just playing another extension of herself. I tend to disagree. There isn't a better TV actress in the entire history of television because Lucy Ricardo was so incredibly different from Lucy Ball. The 2 looked alike but that's really where the similarities end.The entire cast was also perfect. Fred & Ethel Mertz (William Frawley & Vivian Vance who hated each other, almost as much as the characters they played) were just icing on the cake. And Ricky (Desi Arnaz) was usually the voice of reason which only made it that much more funny when he'd often abandon all hope and join Lucy with whatever hairball scheme she had up her sleeve, next.Every single show on this comedic masterpiece is pure entertainment and pure quality. Lucille Ball was a workaholic that never did anything unless it was Perfect. And even though these eps are all over 50 years old, they're each still very relatable. That's because Lucy's method of comedy was so universal. She didn't put on airs or get on her soapbox. This lady was just here to make us laugh. That was it.

1089846,ATMNM0IMFHL9,B000TGJ8B2,"John T. R. Gorman ""John Lee Booker""","[5, 5]","I Love Lucy: The Complete Series [1951-60] is 34 DVDs worth of unbridled laughter packaged in a thin, colorful clear-plastic outer shell. Upon opening, six of these discs crashed to the floor. I learned why: The DVDs get housed in an incredibly flimsy box, and what passes for the lid of this box fell to the floor as well, because there's no hinge, or even paper tape to hold the lid, such as it is, in place.I would rather that the studio had spent an extra $3-5/set wholesale, (thus $7-10 cost to us), in order to give the 34 discs the same kind of higher-quality casing that the series M*A*S*H* comes in. A series this funny not only deserves it, it demands it! I believe that Lucille Ball would be most unhappy to see the best of her life's work packaged as poorly as this set is. Fortunately, I have a solution for you.You should pick up a 36-disc holder along with this order. As of this writing, you can get one for $10.73 here on Amazon, or as little as $8.15 from one of Amazon's dealers. That way, you'll have room for the 34 DVDs and the most-excellently written booklet about &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; that comes with the set.IF, heaven forbid, you're unfamiliar with this show, look up &#34;I Love Lucy&#34;, the factory episode on YouTube. (Season 2, Episode 4 on this boxed set). It so greatly illustrates the sheer perfect genius of this program's scriptwriters as well as the acting and brilliant comic timing amongst Lucy (Lucille Ball), Ricky (Desi Arnaz), Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance), and the show's resident curmudgeon, Fred Mertz, (William Frawley). Fact: Ricky and Lucy are married in real life, and, though the neighbor-couple characters, Fred and Ethel are not, you'd never know that based on their performances.To be sure, some scripts have the &#34;boys&#34; say things to the &#34;girls&#34; that are groan-worthy sexism by today's standards, and Lucy regularly mocks her husband's triple-thick Cuban accent in ways that would have Latino groups marching in the streets to protest. Still, &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; is quite clearly ahead for its time, by giving us an early peek at &#34;women's' lib&#34;, if you will.That is, if Lucy and Ethyl tangle with Ricky and Fred, you may rest assured that the ladies will outwit the fellows every single time. At the end of the &#34;Factory&#34; episode, for example, Lucy and Ethel win the argument with Ricky and Fred, fairly and squarely. What Ricky and Fred do by way of apology, though, must be seen to be believed... Razor-sharp comedy at its best, all 194 episodes, and more!If you've read this far and haven't put &#34;I Love Lucy (The Complete Series)&#34; in your Amazon shopping cart yet, don't wait any longer.

They are held in cardboard sleeves that fold out accordian style in two ""booklets"". When I pulled the first few out to watch they already had scratches and scuffs. While it's a good price, you don't want new DVDs to look used right off the bat. My advice? Buy the set but invest in a CD/DVD holder to protect your I Love Lucy series!

Every time I TiVo the show on broadcast or cable TV, the picture quality is so muddy and flat, I was expecting the DVD to look similar.  Not the case.  All the episode are very very sharp and 10 times more crisp than you will see on TV.  It makes watching the episodes that much more enjoyable. Not only does each disc contain the complete, uncut episodes, but some lost footage has been faithfully restored in order to present the episodes as they originally were BEFORE they were cut up for syndication.  The other nice feature is the extensive chapterization.  Some vintage TV show DVDs just give you each episode as a single chapter.  This set breaks each episode down into multiple chapters.  Additionally, there are lists of flubs and rare Lucille Ball radio shows as well as restored promos that haven't aired in 60 years!!  And if that weren't enough, this is THE ENTIRE Lucy collection.  The final discs contain the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour, which came after the official ""I Love Lucy"" series was over.  The packaging is very nice too.  All discs come in a heart-shaped box.  Very nice.

I love Lucy was one of the best shows on television, and is a breath of fresh air amongst the dreck that passes for television nowadays.

So many TV shows today employ violence, sex, and profanity to 'spice' things up or 'push the envelope', but Lucy had none of these.

I am also glad that they put more special features and the I Love Lucy movie in this set. This is something that every Lucy fan should own. The packaging for this complete series set is very unique but it does have some flaws. The outside plastic cover can be easily torn in not carefully pulling the box in and out and the actually disc holders which is accordian style, while clever, can tear easily also if not careful.

I purchased this for my son in law and he really loved the set. It's not expensive packaging; and the cardboard sleeves are hard on the discs...but....one can just pick up some protective sleeves and transfer the discs for safer keeping. On the other hand, it's well known that even surface scratches usually don't affect the playing or picture quality of a DVD or CD. It's not the same concept as a vinyl LP where a needle can skip when almost any defect is on the vinyl.

1089886,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000TGJ8B2,Robert Badgley,"[4, 6]","I should have titled this review:""The DVD set I ALMOST bought,but didn't"".This is the only review of a DVD set I do NOT own,but TRIED to get and failed.First let me review the series then I will get to my bugaboo about the packaging in the second half.The series itself,as everyone knows,has a stellar position in televisionhistory.Lucille Ball was a struggling bit player at RKO then later for MGM who eventually managed to garner some lead roles in lesser pictures.She was a smart and ambitious actress who paid her dues and learned her lessons very well.During the war she met and romanced with Cuban band leader Desi Arnaz.They eventually married and Desi also became an actor.In the early 50s Desi and Lucy decided to develop a sitcom.Both would star, with Desi heavy into the production end and Lucy concentrating on her comedy schtick for the camera.Desi had the show filmed,a virtual first,which is why we are still able to Love Lucy after all these years.Lucy as I said was one smart lady and she had learned alot about comedy over the years from her days at the studios.She knew who to get advice from when she needed it and one of the most important was one of the greatest gag men/comedians of all time,Buster Keaton.The show started in 1951 and wasn't a giant hit right off the bat.The first year was touch and go and Lucy and Desi worked their tails off to perfect and improve everywhere they could.By the second year the ratings improved dramtically and by the third they were the biggest thing on TV.And why not?The audience loved(and still does) the interplay between Lucy and Desi(husband and wife) and the dynamic their neighbours Fred and Ethel Mertz(William Frawley and Vivian Vance,respectfully) brought to the entire series.Like the great comedians of old Lucy showed audiences that you didn't need to constantly talk in order to be funny.Many of the routines and situations Lucy gets herself into in these shows are done without uttering a single syllable.And they are for the most part simply hilarious.This show is the cream of the crop as far as television is concerned,a benchmark in many ways.And it is an essential to anyone interested in wholesome,genuinely funny and just plain excellent television programming.Now for the other half of this review,and it all revolves around the packaging.When my set arrived I was first surprised at how thin it was,maybe six inches.The set itself is rectangular,encased in thick plastic with Lucys' picture on the front.You open a flap on the right side and slide out the contents.The bottom half is square while the top half has the shape of a heart.On top of the heart is a form fitting piece of plastic to fill the gaps the heart doesn't,to keep it tight inside.You remove that piece then you lift up the heart to reveal two smaller hearts sitting at the bottom inside of the case,and a booklet.The smaller hearts contain all the DVDs in this set.They are open topped and like accordians.Each DVD sits loose inside one of these accordian slots.I placed my order for a set and the first one that came I started to check each DVD and found the very first disc had a nasty looking scratch on it.That set I returned and ordered a replacement.In the second set I got to about the seventh DVD when I found a scratch on that one!!I have had this kind of thing happen before and instead of prolonging the inevitable I decided to call it a day and get a refund.What a shame too as there hasn't been many sets I was looking forward to as much as I was this one.How the scratches got on those DVDs is difficult to say.There was nothing in the accordian shaped holders to indicate anything that could have scratched them.But the very idea that they sit loose and can move around bothers me.The manufacturers also may be to blame with sub standard DVDs and/or poor equipment.Furthermore if you wanted to take a few episodes over to show old Aunt Sadie the ONLY way you could safely take them is to take the ENTIRE set with you.If you just threw one of the heart DVD holders into a plastic bag and took them over like you would an ordinary slipcase,you would find the entire collection sitting loose at the bottom of the bag,and probably all scratched.The concept for this set was unique and is nice to look at.But in practical terms it comes up a complete failure.I can only hope sometime in the future Paramount Home video takes some notes and reissues this set in nice,tight slimpacks.It is really the only way to go.In conclusion I highly recommend the Lucy series to everyone out there.But fair warning to those who are contemplating buying this set:caveat emptor!",5,"""Five stars"" for the series-""O stars""

The reason for her dismissal was having no talent whatever, and I surmise this prompted the key point in the I Love Lucy series that Lucy was talentless. This is a key ingredient in many good comedy routines. However, comedians and comdienes must have an exceptional intellect, if they are to be good, and this is because they must know how something is supposed to work in order to screw up consistently every time.

1089894,A3HSZWH3QY03NU,B000TGJ8B2,"Sam C. ""Southern Man""","[4, 4]",This was bought as a gift for my wife and we both love it. This is one of the absolute best packaged series sets I have seen. There are lots of other sets for shows you can buy that come in shameful packaging. This set comes in a heavy duty box with lots of art work and an outer hard plastic box to keep it in for extra protection. Inside you will find a full color and detailed book that tells all about the I Love Lucy show and short descriptions of each episode with lots of pictures. The cover is a hard cardboard plastic coated heart shaped top. Inside there are two very well made DVD holders set up like mini rolodex to make it easy to flip thru and find the Season and Disc you want to play. Best made set of DVDs I have seen. As far as quality of the audio / video - 100% perfect and could not be better. I Love Lucy show has always been one of the highest quality produced and filmed shows of all time tv series history so that helps I am sure. The quality and sound are 2nd to none and that is cause the show was done at Desilu Studios where almost every great tv series of the 1960s and 70s were made. The big plus is you can save almost 50% buying thru amazon as opposed to a store..... that is why I bought here. Do not hesitate if you are wanting this set and get it here.,5,"I LOVE LUCY The Complete Series (over 180 episodes) with all kinds of special clips, extras including movie & bloppers",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1288,"['was', 'bought', 'gift', 'wife', 'love', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'packaged', 'series', 'sets', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'lots', 'other', 'sets', 'shows', 'can', 'buy', 'come', 'shameful', 'packaging', 'set', 'heavy', 'duty', 'box', 'lots', 'art', 'work', 'outer', 'hard', 'plastic', 'box', 'keep', 'extra', 'protection', 'will', 'find', 'full', 'color', 'detailed', 'book', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'show', 'short', 'descriptions', 'episode', 'lots', 'pictures', 'cover', 'hard', 'cardboard', 'plastic', 'coated', 'heart', 'shaped', 'top', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'DVD', 'holders', 'set', 'up', 'mini', 'rolodex', 'make', 'easy', 'flip', 'thru', 'find', 'Season', 'Disc', 'want', 'play', 'Best', 'made', 'set', 'DVDs', 'have', 'seen', 'As', 'far', 'quality', 'audio', '/', 'video', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'highest', 'quality', 'produced', 'filmed', 'shows', 'time', 'tv', 'series', 'history', 'am', 'sure', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', '2nd', 'none', 'cause', 'show', 'was', 'done', 'Desilu', 'Studios', 'where', 'almost', 'great', 'tv', 'series', '1960s', '70s', 'were', 'made', 'big', 'plus', 'can', 'save', 'almost', '50', '%', 'buying', 'thru', 'amazon', 'opposed', 'store', '..', 'why', 'bought', 'here', 'Do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'are', 'wanting', 'set', 'get', 'here']",I Love Lucy: The Complete Series

This Complete Series is now available for pre-order on various websites including Amazon and will release on October, 23, 2007!With this set you get all 179 half hour episodes of I Love Lucy as well as 13 FULL hour episodes of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour on DVD for the low low price of only $168.99 and packaged beautifully plus digitally remastered to crystal clear perfection!!There will also be bonuses including Lucille Ball on the radio show ""My favorite Husband, rare commercials, clips in color, Desilu studio tour with Lucy and the gang and much more.. With the bonuses alone you get several hours of fun and if you bought the season DVD sets it will be much of the same bonuses in this complete series.If you have never bought the Lucy season sets and you are a fan then you do not know what you are missing. The shows are in crystal clear picture quality and not like they were when DVD's were first made and VHS's also, these are so nice and remastered to perfection and clearer than what you will see on tv. I wont even watch I Love Lucy on the television anymore because the DVD's are so much clearer that it doesn't look right to watch it a little on tv.You not only get every single episode of the I Love Lucy show and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour to watch over and over again but you get never before seen bonuses that are very rare and some of these bonuses have never been seen on cable before now. This is the absolute perfect gift for any Lucy fan and is a must have collection to own!I bought my season sets seperately as they were being made and I paid about $250 for the complete collection individually and the I Love Lucy movie was not even included, you will be very lucky to get that lost movie, which was recently found 50 years later after I love Lucy was produced and they may be adding that movie with this set. The I Love Lucy movie as of now has never been released to the public but by stong requests from many fans it will be out soon!I will keep updating this review as I find out more information about what is included with the set but this is a terrific value and not to be passed up even if the movie is not included with the complete series.. This is a terrific value and price!!(UPDATE: The price of this set has now went up so I believe that if you were able to buy it at the $168.99 Amazon will match it via there policy but if you are just now buying it you will have to pay the new price unless it goes down before the release date which tends to happen a lot on Amazon with price changes so keep a look out and do price comparisons at dvdpricesearch website for this set to get the best deals.

I bought the first season's DVDs as soon as they were available, and as a family, we have watched those discs over and over again.  I was SO EXCITED to see this set on sale and sold my first season's discs (for way too low, I've now realized) to make room for this set.Here are the greats:- the box is cute and decorative- the discs are arranged in such a way that's easily accessible and very compact- you're not missing ONE single episodeHere are the problems with the set/DVDs:- NO English captions?  I thought that's standard these days- the last few seasons were not ""seasons"" but just a few shows at most- I'm a bit scared how the discs will weather in a few years because they're protected by cardboard, not plasticTruth of the matter is spending $150 on a complete season of a great show isn't too much to shell out.

The Comedy Hour episode with Tallulah Bankhead is missing the part where she explains after dinner that she is allergic to strawberries, which is a critical part to understanding a later scene.  Otherwise, this is a great collection to have.It is mentioned in the bonus material that some recently found lost footage wasn't edited in because of questionable quality.  Why didn't they splice it in anyway, because that would have been easier than punching through the bonuses to view it.  The bonuses are really nice, although somewhat redundant in spots, and I had to take about an hour to scroll through them so as to make sure there was nothing I missed. The booklet description of the bonus material highlights the titles of the included radio shows, and serves as a helpful guide.There are many cute intros and exits to the episodes that we have not seen on TV Land, but it doesn't include all of the advertisements mentioned in the bonus material.  There are five wonderful Westinghouse promotions they hosted on the bonus of the DVD, Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie, which I also highly recommend as a follow up to a five week marathon of this series (at 1 DVD per day).  The restoration on this collection is really great, with only 3 or 4 splotches they either overlooked or couldn't repair.Whilst the packaging is beautifully designed, the actual DVDs aren't that well protected in their 2 accordion folders, so one has to be careful replacing and retrieving them.  It is better than other clever packages I've seen, but they could have lined the pockets with protective material to ensure long life.  The manufacturers aren't that interested in going the extra few inches for highly overpriced DVDs and CDs.  My question is, how is Amazon's return policy going to cover this item if one can't watch them all in enough time to discover any damage, and return them within 30 days?  At least 2 DVDs would have to be viewed per day to find out.

Pull up on the heart to reveal the discs, which have no individual protection, only a cardboard insert backing each disc -- this means, go out to the store and buy a case of 50 paper sleeves and ditch the cardboard inserts inside this box.I have yet to inspect every disc, and I hope none is severely scratched.  Not likely; I had worse trouble with the Cosby Show 25th anniversary set, and those issues were surprisingly few and minor -- and I bought envelopes for those discs too.It's a bit on the cheap side, this box, but even having to do the extra work in procuring disc envelopes, for an extra $4, it's a good price for a great series.  But expect this trend to continue for many more shows; particularly complete series sets.If this is the way of the future, I hope more companies do what was done for ""Sanford and Son - the complete series"":  One plastic tray/caddy with all the discs inside and fitted with one cardboard piece.  No fuss, no muss.
