1016083,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B000HT3P5Q,A.K.A. Me,"[13, 17]","With 11 seasons of M*A*S*H* in reruns for many years now, I think everyone has a handle on the quality of this show and whether or not they like it. So I am going to leave that aspect to other reviewers who feel it is warranted, and address the packaging of this particular release:There should be yearly worst-designed packaging awards, just so this set could win the grand prize. I have over 100 seasons of television, some with very poorly designed packaging, but this is the WORST piece of trash I have come across yet. And the kicker is that quite a bit of the expense of this set is for this less-than-worthless waste of trees.Now the purpose of this inane packaging is to have a piece of M*A*S*H* memorabilia. But I didn't buy this to put on display like a sculpture. I bought it for the TV show...imagine that! I want my TV season sets to fit into my TV season storage shelves. Is that too much to ask? And haven't any of the people who are paid top dollar to be in charge of these projects ever heard of form following function? Apparently not. Trying to get a disc out of this thing is like wrestling with a muscular octopus. And when you do find some way to balance the heavy fold-out arm-like sections of this storage ""book,"" then you have to slide the discs out oh-so-carefully while balancing it, so as not to scratch them...but ultimately you needn't bother, because the discs were scratched up when they were put in the packaging to begin with.The fact that ANYONE thinks that sliding a DVD in and out of a rough cardboard slot is acceptable storage boggles my mind. It is virtually impossible NOT to destroy these discs if you keep them in their original packaging, and then you want to actually WATCH the show. The only way to preserve the already somewhat compromised quality of the discs is to abandon the octopus altogether. I decided the only way to go is to put the discs in slim line jewel cases, (yet another expense) and store them in the slipcover...ah, if only they all fit! Some had to go in vellum sleeves instead. Far from ideal, but at least the discs will not incur any further damage.Inside of the cover of this unwieldy monster is a very nice clipboard. The entire purpose of the clipboard is to hold a much smaller booklet. Once I decided to abandon everything but the slipcase, I realized I'd really like to at least keep the clipboard, as it has some use. Of course, it is firmly glued to the inside of the book, but with some muscle, I removed it and scraped the glue off the back. The rest of the octopus will unfortunately only add to the clogging of the local landfill - that's the only logical place for it.One day, perhaps, in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future, those who are in charge of producing TV shows for purchase will realize that we buy them to watch them, not to display them, and they will FINALLY stop wasting our precious money and storage space on monstrosities such as this. So to sum up, a word to those highly paid Hollywood types: double slimline DVD cases in slipcovers, stupid.",1,"Great Show, Gruesome Packaging",1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,3046,"['11', 'seasons', 'M*A*S*H*', 'reruns', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'think', 'everyone', 'handle', 'quality', 'show', 'not', 'So', 'am', 'going', 'leave', 'aspect', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'feel', 'warranted', 'address', 'packaging', 'particular', 'release', 'should', 'be', 'yearly', 'worst-designed', 'packaging', 'awards', 'just', 'so', 'set', 'could', 'win', 'grand', 'prize', 'have', 'over', '100', 'seasons', 'television', 'very', 'poorly', 'designed', 'packaging', 'WORST', 'piece', 'trash', 'have', 'come', 'yet', 'kicker', 'quite', 'bit', 'expense', 'set', 'less-than-worthless', 'waste', 'trees.Now', 'purpose', 'inane', 'packaging', 'have', 'piece', 'M*A*S*H*', 'memorabilia', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'put', 'display', 'sculpture', 'bought', 'TV', 'show', 'imagine', 'want', 'TV', 'season', 'sets', 'fit', 'TV', 'season', 'storage', 'shelves', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'have', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'are', 'paid', 'top', 'dollar', 'be', 'charge', 'projects', 'ever', 'heard', 'form', 'following', 'function', 'Apparently', 'not', 'Trying', 'get', 'disc', 'thing', 'wrestling', 'muscular', 'octopus', 'when', 'do', 'find', 'way', 'balance', 'heavy', 'fold-out', 'arm-like', 'sections', 'storage', 'book', 'then', 'have', 'slide', 'discs', 'oh-so-carefully', 'balancing', 'so', 'not', 'scratch', 'ultimately', 'need', ""n't"", 'bother', 'discs', 'were', 'scratched', 'up', 'when', 'were', 'put', 'packaging', 'begin', 'with.The', 'fact', 'ANYONE', 'sliding', 'DVD', 'rough', 'cardboard', 'slot', 'acceptable', 'storage', 'boggles', 'mind', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'NOT', 'destroy', 'discs', 'keep', 'original', 'packaging', 'then', 'want', 'actually', 'WATCH', 'show', 'only', 'way', 'preserve', 'already', 'somewhat', 'compromised', 'quality', 'discs', 'abandon', 'octopus', 'altogether', 'decided', 'only', 'way', 'go', 'put', 'discs', 'slim', 'line', 'jewel', 'cases', 'yet', 'expense', 'store', 'slipcover', 'ah', 'only', 'fit', 'had', 'go', 'vellum', 'sleeves', 'instead', 'Far', 'ideal', 'least', 'discs', 'will', 'not', 'incur', 'further', 'damage.Inside', 'cover', 'unwieldy', 'monster', 'very', 'nice', 'clipboard', 'entire', 'purpose', 'clipboard', 'hold', 'much', 'smaller', 'booklet', 'decided', 'abandon', 'everything', 'slipcase', 'realized', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'least', 'keep', 'clipboard', 'use', 'course', 'firmly', 'glued', 'inside', 'book', 'muscle', 'removed', 'scraped', 'glue', 'back', 'rest', 'octopus', 'will', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'add', 'clogging', 'local', 'landfill', 'only', 'logical', 'place', 'it.One', 'day', 'perhaps', 'hopefully', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'who', 'are', 'charge', 'producing', 'TV', 'shows', 'purchase', 'will', 'realize', 'buy', 'watch', 'not', 'display', 'will', 'FINALLY', 'stop', 'wasting', 'precious', 'money', 'storage', 'space', 'monstrosities', 'such', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'word', 'highly', 'paid', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'double', 'slimline', 'DVD', 'cases', 'slipcovers', 'stupid']",N/A

There is nothing better than sitting down and watching MASH to relax and enjoy some time in the past.Not a single complaint about the series.  It's perfect for those of us who loved MASH.HOWEVER the DVDs come in this paper case and it's BAD, really bad.  Mine was a mess when I opened it.  There were DVDs all over, some in a little plastic sleeve and out of the slot it was supposed to be in and some out of the plastic sleeve and loose. And a couple of them right where they belonged.  The slots that the DVDs belong in were a huge mess.  The glue that's holding it together is coming unglued and many of them tore as well as coming lose from where they were glued in. I only wish I could post the pictures of this mess here!About 1/3rd of the DVDs are badly scratched, and this happened before I opened the item. Doesn't have a thing to do with me scratching them or mishandling them.About 1/3rd of the DVDs are scratched to some degree, and only about 1/3rd of them are in great shape.The case is a cute idea that doesn't work in reality. Someone needs to change the packaging and put the darn DVDs into DVD cases.  I bought DVD cases for these here on Amazon and they work, but they add another $20 to the cost of having this series. (the covers are approx. 10$ for 10 cases.... you need 12 cases for this series, so you have to buy 20 of them.)If I had it to do over again, I'd buy the individual seasons.  I know it would cost more, but the DVDs would be in better shape and I'd be happier.I'm giving 2 stars because of the horrid packaging.

Many people have been given something to think about in re war, civility, cruelty, and kindness through the thoughts, actions, and antics of Hawkeye, Trapper John, BJ Hunnicut, Radar, and all the rest of the cast. There is not only comments on the meaninglessness of war and chauvinism to be found here, but also on existence in general. And lets of course not forget some clever acting along the way, too.The series pretty much picks up where the film left off. The characters are roughly the same, and the idiosyncratic directional style that Altman brought to the film is mimicked (to a point, of course) in the first series. As time goes by the series changes from being exclusively a comedy series to including quite a bit of drama, which, in my opinion, is just fine. It keeps the series 'fresh', for lack of better words. There is a clear evolution in the way that subject matter is treated. We get to see war and despair treated humoristically as well as dramatically.The packing, as so many reviewers have noticed before yours truly, is not the best in the world. Two of the disc in my set was actually scratched out of the box. Seems a shame that such a great set of DVDs should suffer such bad packing, which is the reason for my rating it at 4 and not 5 stars.

1016096,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000HT3P5Q,calvinnme,"[2, 2]","It's hard to believe that a TV show that was intended to be a comedic protest against the Vietnam War managed to outlast that war by ten years and last well into the Reagan administration, finishing strongly with a series finale that was the most watched episode of television in history - a record that lasts to this day, and with the advent of cable will probably always stand in the record books. As a matter of fact, when I first heard about the ending of hostilities in Vietnam, I remember thinking that ""MASH"" would probably be cancelled the following year because it would no longer be relevant.If you watch the first two or three seasons, you have the basic formula of the ""hippies"" (Hawkeye and Trapper) versus the ""establishment"" (Hoolihan and Burns) with Henry Blake trying to keep the peace. There are some leftover values from the 60's too, with even good guys Trapper and Lt. Colonel Henry Blake both blatantly cheating on their wives and partying at every opportunity. In the fourth season things really begin to change with B.J. Hunnicutt and Captain Potter being more personally conservative people than their predecessors, although they still take the ""right side"" in moral battles with the establishment. The one time Hunicutt strays from his wife it tears him up inside with guilt. This is something Trapper would have just taken in stride.Eventually, Major Hoolihan has a short-lived marriage that ends when she learns that her husband is cheating on her. Thereafter, her character is less of an evil cartoon and more of a human being. The cowardly and greedy Major Burns never changes, and is replaced in 1977 with Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, who is a snobby, aloof, and at times annoying Bostonion, but who has the humanity that Burns never had. Thus by 1978, basically there are no glaring schisms between the characters, and most of the time they work together for their patients and against the government bureaucracy that is personified by numerous guest stars. The characters' various personalities are just acting more as an irritant to one another, much like very different people trying to share a college dorm room, than anything else at this point.Even though the show was broadcast from 1972-1983, it is not dated at all.

1016097,A1GPGPOA8ME38W,B000HT3P5Q,"Cecil Elliott, Jr.","[2, 2]","How would you define MASH. Do you label it as a comedy or do you label it as a drama? The best answer would be, MASH would have to defined as both! The original movie was pure comedy.There no emphasis placed on the drama of the sessions in the operating room. When MASH was recasted for television, producers had to adjust the format,to make it appealing to the viewing audience. The comedic genius of Alan Alda brought the light comedy to the series. Dr. Walter Dishel, the medical advisor for the series, brought the drama of the operating room to the viewing audience. The surgeons at the 4077th MASH, were trauma surgeons, operating close to the front lines during the Korean War. They knew time was critical if they were going to save a man's life. Some of the cases seen the operating room, were loosely based on actual cases from the Korean War and possibly Vietnam.When MASH was recasted for television, it was beautifully done. Alan Alda was perfect as Hawkeye Pierce. Wayne Rogers was excellent as Trapper John. Loretta Swit was outstanding as ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan! The late McClean Stevenson was good as Colonel Henry Blake and the late Larry Linville was perfect for the character of Major Frank Burns. The only carry-over from movie was Gary Burghoff as Radar O'Reilly. As the series progressed, other characters were introduced. During the second season, William Christopher was introduced as Father Mulcahy and Jamie Farr was introduced as cross-dressing Corporal Max Klinger.During the first three seasons, MASH was a light comedy with a little drama from the sessions in the operating room. The comedy came from several sources. The first, was the constant battles between Hawkeye Pierce & Trapper John with Major Burns. The second, was the affair between Major Burns & Hot Lips Houlihan. The other source was Klinger's efforts to get out of the Army on a Section 8 medical discharge. At the end of season three, changes were made as new characters were introduced. Veteran character actor Harry Morgan joined the cast as Colonel Sherman Potter. He provided the father figure to the series. Daytime actor Mike Farrell joined the cast as Captain B.J. Hunnicutt, a dedicated husband and father who was away from his family while serving during the Korean War. During the fourth season, the viewing audience started to see changes in the character of Hot Lips Houlihan. During the first three seasons, Major Margaret Houlihan was a cold, no non-sense Army chief nurse who cared about her nurses. The changes made in her character, were gradual over the course of the series. During the fourth season, more emphasis was placed on the cases in the operating room. During the sixth season, David Ogden Stiers joined the cast as Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a Boston thorasic surgeon with an ego. During the early part of season 8, everyone seen the departure of Gary Burghoff as Radar O'Reilly was sent home on a hardship discharge after the passing of his Uncle Ed. Klinger would take over the duties of company clerk.During its run, MASH was a combination of light comedy of the practical jokes that were pulled on unsuspecting members of the unit and the drama taking place in the operating room. One of the best episodes of the series, was the last. Good-bye,Farewell & Amen was perfect. One of the storylines was the pressure finally getting to Hawkeye Pierce, requiring the assistance of Dr. Sidney Freeman, the psychiatrist. The major storyline was the cease fire, bringing the Korean War to an end and disbanding of the 4077th MASH for the trip home and the reunions with their families. CBS should be commended in allowing the producers of MASH to bring the series to a conclusion. MASH is one of the best series on television and continues to do well in syndication. The character of Major Margaret Houlihan provided inspiration to thoses who pursued nursing careers. The real MASH units during the Korean War, provided the concept of the trauma centers we see in the major cities of the United States.If you are fan of MASH like I am, M*A*S*H - Martinis & Medicine Complete Collection, is a must for anyone's DVD library. It will allow you to enjoy & relive some of the best episodes of the series.

1016099,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B000HT3P5Q,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 1]","It's funny I wasn't a big fan of MASH during its original run, but in syndication I got to know it more intimately (I was usually up late during my time in college and MASH was on around 11pm, so I'd watch it as I did my work). My favorite time though is after Klinger stopped wearing dresses and became company clerk. I liked Radar a lot, but it seemed after his departure, a lot of changes were made, and it seemed as if it had matured quite a bit. It's like the radar years were the freshman/sophmore years, and the Klinger years were the Junior and Senior years (as far as maturity is concerned). I genuinely like the show. It is a great mixture of the pain and comraderie of war. How people who spend so little time together under harsh circumstances can become a family. Though the show did last a lot lot longer than the Korean War in which it took place. The characters were well drawn out, and you get to see Hawkeye evolve, partly due to the influence of his bunkmates. From Colonel Potter to Hot Lips to Radar to Klinger, every character is memorable and well loved. When Henry Blake dies en route to going home, that had to be the saddest moment in television history. While we were safe in the knowlege that the actor was still alive, the death of his character left a mark on all of us, and on the other characters as well. War is hell, but this show proves that even in our darkest moments we can find a little laughter among friends. Anyone who is a fan of the comedies mixed with drama, and anyone who is a fan of well written sitcoms or any well written show for that matter, should own this. I can't see too many people being disappointed, unless you do not like the touches of realism thrown in. No matter how comical this show was it never failed to show the cost of war..and the toll it takes on those caught in the middle. This is a must have for anyone wishing to own top quality shows on dvd. The set itself I'd give a four, it's a bit oversized, and although the clipboard on the inside of the case is a nice touch you would figure they'd make the booklet a size to match. However, I will add that the case looks like something the army would put it in, if it were to ever package dvds. It has a real world feel. I'd prefer it to be in the regular size dvd cases (some you can fit up to six discs) so that it would fit better with my collection. The dvds do move around a bit, but that's due to the cardboard cd holders. But once you get them in your collection you're not likely to have too many problems as long as it's handled right. It's a nice show piece. I do not take stars off though in reviews based on packaging unless the packaging is totally horrible. the five stars will be for the show itself and four for the packaging...I have a lot of series on dvd, and this one definitely sticks out.

Had I, it would not have been purchased. When I was growing up MASH was my favorite sitcom, and to this day I still love to watch the re-runs of it.When the package arrived I was excited and opened it up and immediately 3 DVD's fell out and onto the carpet. I couldn't figure out why that had happened until I opened it up completely and seen how they were placed in cardboard sleeves. Then upon inspecting the rest of them I noticed that they were scratched (some worse than others) and the ones that were still in the sleeves were scratched like a half moon where they rubbed the disc below them. I mean the concept of the whole packaging was a good one, but in reality it should have been tested for these problems. I played the ones that were scratched and was certain that they would freeze up or skip on me, but they were fine. Even the worst ones played with no problems.Now this is not in any way excusing them for the way they packaged them, but I am just expressing my situation. I later went on and read the reviews of others that had the same problems, and wished that I had done that before. It will not happen again. In the last few months I have noticed that Amazons quality control is not as good as it used to be. I had received another DVD a month ago and it had clearly been opened and then re-sealed to make it look like the seal hadn't been broken so they could return it. The DVD was fine and I told Amazon that most likely whoever had done it, probably copied the disc and sent it back for a refund. Someone should have inspected it when it came back to verify that it hadn't been tampered with. Evidently they hadn't.I plan on keeping this set because they do play, and if I were to exchange it who knows what they are going to look like. Also if I were to buy the single seasons separately it would end up costing me more than the $69 that I paid for it. So buyer beware make sure to check out the reviews before buying anything from now on.

Anyone agree with me here should reply back to this posting.12/16/10 Update:Come on people... Even after I wrote this review on how bad the packaging is and why Amazon needs to stop selling this until the packaging gets fixed, there are still those buying this POS set and still getting bad disks and still complaining. Well Duh... If you would have read this review and posted a comment back and had a clue, this would not happen to you!

Or is it vice versa?This show squeezes you. It makes you care. Though it is clear that the point of it overarchingly is anti-war, somehow it's not preachy. Instead, this is a premise of the characters meant to draw out the dichotomy of caring and pain, of trying to be healing in the face of destruction. I think I'm making it too heavy sounding. It's actually not heavy at all. It has moments, don't get me wrong. All great Sitcoms have their moments that make you tear up, but you'll treasure those moments because you'll love these characters. You'll fall in love with them.It can simply be stated that M*A*S*H is perhaps the greatest TV program every made. It retains its humanity throughout. Never falters. The characters develop, change, some leave, some come in later, but you'll find yourself wanting more.When the last episode ends you're not just sad because there's no more, you're sad because you'll already miss them. This show definitely makes you feel like these are people you know and care about.

But in a review of the content of the series, you are reviewing the corporate media group, not the show itself. Shame on all of you.The show is fantastic and this box set is a fans dream come true.Was I upset at first? You bet. What did I do about it? Well, since I assume you all know how to find the internet and Amazon, I don't get why you did not do what I did.Before the general listing for the whole box set came on Amazon, I listed all 10 of my individual seasons here for sale. And I was able to list them for between $17 and $25 each, making roughly $200 in about 2 weeks selling the individual sets.When Amazon listed the box set for $139, I ordered it. And guess what? I may have lost money from the $30 each I paid for the individual sets, but I made a profit by selling them and buying the box set.Simple math folks. You all could have and should have done the same. Don't cry about it because you didn't use your heads.Now, to the point - the show, the series, everything about it is 5 stars all the way. Sure, some ups and downs over the seasons, but for sheer entertainment and elightenment value you can't go wrong here. The extras are nice for a show that came and went before VHS was popular and there were few extras to be had. the lost script is a real gem. and you get the movie too. All that for well under $200 (unless you keep waiting). A steal of a deal if you ask me.And I played the game and beat Fox at it's own greed.

Years later, it caught on with me, and I've been a big fan ever since.  The price for this entire series collection averages around $16 per season (think about that, Warner Bros.!), not counting the orginal movie or the two bonus features discs.  Okay, $175 divided by 36 discs is less than $5 per disc.  For me, it's more than worth it to have all the digital clarity with no ads, editing, or -ugh!- pop-ups and banners prostituting the show on TV nowdays.  Now then, why four stars?  The packaging.  Another reviewer was dead on about the cardboard packaging.  The box is really neat, and the little playbook is crucial to keeping up with the episodes.  If you order this package, have 36 proper center-spindle DVD cases ready.  Cardbord is ABRASIVE!  Also, if you have a shelf system that is designed to hold DVD cases upright, this box will not fit - too tall.  I've got the regular cases, which I'm labeling and putting the discs into them, 'cause I surely don't intend to leave them on the shelf!!  I'm looking forward to lots of laughs and many other emotions with one of the best series ever put on the carrier waves.  Personally, I never liked Frank Burns, which is a positive testament to Larry Linville whose great acting skills had me convinced that he was really like that.  I preferred Potter over Blake because Potter wasn't wishy-washy and knew when to be firm and when to be lenient.  I welcomed Winchester because he could hold his own with Hawkeye and B.J.

1016140,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000HT3P5Q,Just Bill,"[13, 13]","I agree with the other reviewers: the content of this MASH boxed set is first-rate. Every episode spanning 11 years, plus the movie, plus cool behind-the-scenes discs.The khaki-colored cloth box is a great idea. But, as a few reviewers pointed out, the DVDs are wedged into a cardboard holder like coins in a coin set. The movie was slightly marred the minute we pulled it out of its holder. So, at that point, I wasted no time in getting a separate CD/DVD case with soft cloth and plastic holders. I carefully pulled out every disc and re-inserted them into the new carrying case where they'll stay safe and sound. The box will be stored somewhere for safekeeping as well.Three quick comments:1. The collector's booklet that comes with the set is nice, but not essential. It's mostly photos and not a whole lot of revealing words about the show or the actors' thoughts about the show. So it's a nifty item, but not the crowning glory of this boxed set.2. The transfer to DVD is mostly excellent. The first episode had a few grainy vertical lines in it. But the sound is superb. Ditto for the movie. Great sound and picture.3. I haven't yet watched the behind-the-scenes bonus DVDs, but those are next up. Those, to me, are always my favorite parts of a special collector's set. I've seen the show. I've seen the photos. But what I really want to see are interviews with cast and crew (even writers and directors) telling me how it all came together.MASH was a groundbreaking TV show, and the soundtrack to my life as a teenager. I watched MASH from its first show through to its last show. I recall getting kind of sick of Alan Alda's iconoclastic, irreverent, buck-authority personality after a few seasons. But the ensemble cast was brilliant and the show featured many of TV's most memorable moments.If you can find this special collector's boxed set, buy it. It's worth the price (as long as the price is under $250) to have every single episode of this often hilarious TV show.Highly recommended!",5,"Four Stars For Packaging, Five Stars For Content",1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,2002,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'content', 'MASH', 'boxed', 'set', 'first-rate', 'episode', 'spanning', '11', 'years', 'movie', 'cool', 'behind-the-scenes', 'discs.The', 'khaki-colored', 'cloth', 'box', 'great', 'idea', 'few', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'DVDs', 'are', 'wedged', 'cardboard', 'holder', 'coins', 'coin', 'set', 'movie', 'was', 'slightly', 'marred', 'minute', 'pulled', 'holder', 'So', 'point', 'wasted', 'time', 'getting', 'separate', 'CD/DVD', 'case', 'soft', 'cloth', 'plastic', 'holders', 'carefully', 'pulled', 'out', 'disc', 're-inserted', 'new', 'carrying', 'case', 'where', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'safe', 'sound', 'box', 'will', 'be', 'stored', 'somewhere', 'safekeeping', 'well.Three', 'quick', 'comments:1', 'collector', 'booklet', 'set', 'nice', 'not', 'essential', 'mostly', 'photos', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'revealing', 'words', 'show', 'actors', 'thoughts', 'show', 'nifty', 'item', 'not', 'crowning', 'glory', 'boxed', 'set.2', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'few', 'grainy', 'vertical', 'lines', 'sound', 'superb', 'Ditto', 'movie', 'Great', 'sound', 'picture.3', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'watched', 'behind-the-scenes', 'bonus', 'DVDs', 'are', 'next', 'up', 'are', 'always', 'favorite', 'parts', 'special', 'collector', 'set', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'photos', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'even', 'writers', 'directors', 'telling', 'how', 'came', 'together.MASH', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'TV', 'show', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'teenager', 'watched', 'MASH', 'first', 'show', 'last', 'show', 'recall', 'getting', 'kind', 'sick', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'iconoclastic', 'irreverent', 'buck-authority', 'personality', 'few', 'seasons', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'brilliant', 'show', 'featured', 'many', 'TV', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments.If', 'can', 'find', 'special', 'collector', 'boxed', 'set', 'buy', 'price', 'as', 'long', 'price', '250', 'have', 'single', 'episode', 'often', 'hilarious', 'TV', 'show.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Fooled me too.  When I opened the box and removed the MASH set, the first thing I noticed was the fact that half the DVDs had worked loose in shipping.  OK, you expect that - no matter how well the packaging happens to be done.  Now, we come to examining the DVDs - a number of them were scratched, so discretion being the better part of valor - I decided to forget about watching it in order until I played some of the DVDs and just grabbed a representative sampling.  A couple had video problems and one (Season 10, Disc 2) had almost nothing on the disc!  Apparently there's no such thing as Quality Control at the company that made these for 20th Century Fox.Overall, I paid $117 for what I thought would be at least decent, watchable DVDs, albeit in poor packaging.  What I wound up with was poor quality, scratched (and in one case, chipped) DVDs in crappy packaging.Steer clear of it - save your money!!

I preferred to watch thebrightly lit, Disney-esquire ""Bewitched"" and other shows instead. Thetheme music also depressed me. I tried watching it, but I could neverfinish it --- something about it just made me feel sad.I'm 34 now, and I am of the opinion that ""MASH"" is perhaps the greatestAmerican sitcom in television history. (Ironically, even though I stillmoderately like ""Bewitched,"" it just doesn't hold up that muchanymore.) Three years ago I became very close with someone whom Iimmediately adopted as the little brother I never had. His favoriteshow was ""MASH,"" and after several attempts to get me to watch anepisode with him, I finally relented and sat down to watch the pilot.It was okay. Then he begged me to watch another, and another, andanother. Begrudgingly, I did. However, I noticed that after a fewepisodes I actually started to enjoy it. Eventually, I became totallyhooked on it.When I was a child I was too young to understand the dynamics and theconcept of this series. All I wanted back then was the Muppets,cartoons, monsters, and Disney films. Now, as an adult, I recognizewhat the show means to our culture. Not only is it written in arazor-sharp style, but the balance of comedy and tragedy is executedbrilliantly. Also, I used to live in South Korea and Japan, where Itaught English as a Second Language, and I noticed in several episodesthat the writers ""did their homework"" in regards to the culture ofKorea. Even though I wasn't in Korea in the 50s, this element drew meinto the show even more. With every episode I watched I thought of mytime in Korea. And although every series sooner or later ""jumps theshark,"" this one had hands down the best final episode of any series inTV history.Now I am about to collect the entire series, and try to hunt down itsless successful spin-offs ""AfterMASH"" and the ""WALTER"" episode. I havemore memories associated with this show now, memories of a friendshipthat unfortunately no loner exists. Even though he and I called itquits, I will always think of my past friend and my experiences livingin Korea when I see this show. (In fairness, however, I'm sure I gothim hooked on ""The X Files."") It's funny how things change. Or perhapsthings have actually stayed the same and it is myself that has changed.Nonetheless, for several reasons (some personal and others not) I willalways treasure this outstanding series.

Ok, while it isn't the greatest way to hold the discs (lousy actually) the box and `scrapbook album' inside are very substantial , clever and nice to look at and hold.  Mine showed up in pristine condition.  All the discs were there for each season, nothing had fallen out or fallen apart, and I thought the inclusion of Radar's clipboard was a very nice touch!  (albeit, a scaled down version)  I have been playing these discs on a Toshiba HD DVD player which is notorious for NOT playing scratched discs and they have all played beautifully.It really is amazing how much has been trimmed and cut out completely over the years to make room for more commercials.  Now days they could just time compress it, but instead are still showing the chopped and spliced rerun versions.  I would estimate in season one alone I saw about 70 minutes MORE than you would see watching season one on TV Land or Hallmark channel.  That's about an average of 3 minutes more per episode.  These are not just longer versions of the same old scenes you know and love, but entirely new segments (since they were originally hacked out) that add much value and enjoyment to owning this set.  I saw a scene with Frank Burns drunk out of his mind and singing that has not been shown on the chopped versions for probably more than 30 years.  In fact, many of the newly restored  scenes are HILARIOUS and like finding buried treasure!The quality of the video overall is very good.  I have never seen MASH look this good from broadcast TV.  One of the main features I love about this set is that you can choose to watch them with or without the laugh track on.  For me, the show is even better WITHOUT the laugh track.  I don't need a laugh track to tell me when something is funny.  I find myself laughing all the more without it.  Plus you can really hear and notice the nuances of the performances to a level that the laugh track had previously obscured.OK OK, the disc handling system of this box set is BAD! (OK THERE! I said it!)  You could invest another 20 or 30 dollars in some nice DVD boxes or maybe an album to safely hold these discs and save them from any cardboard induced scratching.  Except for that one issue, this box set delivers the goods and will not leave you wanting.

1016162,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B000HT3P5Q,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[8, 8]","Reviewing M*A*S*H: The Martinis & Medicine Collection is not an easy task, because this is one gigantic collection of stuff. In a large, sturdy, canvas-covered box of Army green is contained:* All eleven seasons of the show, a total of 245 half-hour episodes and 5 one-hour episodes, for a total of 250 episodes* The 2  hour-long series finale, ""Goodbye, Farewell & Amen""* The feature film, ""M*A*S*H"" which inspired the series* Two special features DVDs* A softcover ""collector's handbook""* A built-in clipboard like Radar's, stamped ""4077""As for reviewing the collection itself, well, how the hell do I do that? If you're reading this, you're probably a hardcore fan and don't need me to tell you about it. However, if by chance you've never seen it, M*A*S*H was the story of the men and women of the 4077 Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War (or ""police action"" as it was called at the time). It began as a slapstick medical comedy and gradually matured into what might be described as the first television ""dramedy."" Episodes that were at first almost totally farsical, mainly involving free-loving nurses and immature, martini-sodden doctors giving the big one to Army bureacracy, gave way to storylines heavy on social commentary and bloody realities of war. The hospital staff coped with loneliness and separation from their families, with extreme heat and cold, with fleas and lice and rats, with enemy shelling, with deluges of wounded that kept them up for days at a time, with gut-wrenching moral choices, with Army bureacracy (more formiddable than the Chinese and the North Koreans combined), with agonizing boredom, and finally, with each other. M*A*S*H was a ""situation comedy"" in the literal sense - put these characters, men and women, doctors and nurses, drafted soldiers and Army regulars, in a flybown tent-camp in the middle of war zone, take away their freedom, terrrorize them with bombs, torment them with bad food, uncomfortable cots and shortages of everything, and see what happens.M*A*S*H was on the air for eleven years and had a number of cast changes, but over the course of the series the star was always Alan Alda, whose character of Hawkeye Pierce combined brilliant surgical technique with the immaturity (sexual and otherwise) of a college sophomore. The other major characters were, at various times, Trapper John (Wayne Rogers), B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell), Henry Blake (MacLean Stevenson), Margaret Houlihan (Loreta Swit), Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan), Radar O'Reilly, (Gary Burgoff), Frank Burns (Larry Linville), Francis Mulcahey (William Christopher), Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) and Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers). It would take another 300 words to explain these characters, but suffice to say that the chemistry that the actors achieved when the show was at its best is something that comes along maybe once every ten years. It's just that good.Now, I want to close by making it very clear that these episodes are UNEDITED. I put this caps for a reason. During its network run, from 1972 - 1983, M*A*S*H episodes were aired in prime time in their full 25 minute length. When they were cycled into re-runs, the networks cut them by 4 minutes to accommodate yet more commercials, which means if you missed their broadcast premiere, you have probably never seen the missing four minutes.

1016165,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000HT3P5Q,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","I want to start off by saying the content of the set is wonderful.  The only reason I knock it down two stars is because of, as others have noted, the god-awful packaging that the set comes in.  You will absolutely (unless you are extremely lucky) have at least a couple discs that will need to be cleaned in order to play, and most likely one that all or part of an episode will not play unless you get the disc resurfaced (or invest in a machine that can resurface the disc).  If the series were on blu ray and had the anti scratch coating the packaging would be fine, but with DVDs the choice of the tightly packed notches that they slip into was horrible.  They would have been far better off packaging it like the Married...With Children complete series where the discs are stacked on top of each other in two large spindles.As for the series itself, most likely everyone looking at this set will know about it and probably will have seen most of the episodes multiple times.  Given that the show has been off the air for 30 years and has been in syndication for years since then (although it is not as readily available on TV as it was 15 to 20 years ago) most fans of the show know the characters and the various stories.  The one benefit you get from the DVDs is being able to see the episodes in broadcast order which for those who were not (or barely) alive or just too young to have watched the show when it was on the air is nearly impossible these days.  Most of the shows do not necessarily need to be seen in broadcast order to make sense because the stories are all pretty much self contained.  A couple times there are two part episodes, but that was rare.  There were even instances where the show had no continuity at all because of the same actor playing different characters (Harry Morgan being the best example).  There were some instances however when previous events are referenced (especially in the later episodes) so seeing them in order can be helpful.  But what the show excelled at was character development.  With the exception of Frank Burns every character (especially those where the actors stayed around for a long time) was given some kind of depth and grew beyond their initial introduction, and the best way to see that evolution is by watching the episodes in order.The series changed a lot over its run, going from being more of a ""pure"" sitcom to more of a social commentary anti-war piece in its later years when Alan Alda was running a lot of it.  It was always anti-war, but in the early years it was a comedy with elements of drama.  Later it switched to a drama with comedic moments.  The end of the third season and the entire fourth season was really the transition.  Once Larry Linville left the show and David Ogden Stiers came on, it was a much more serious show on the whole.The bonus material is where the set shines.  One bonus is the inclusion of the MASH movie.  The movie was in some ways very different from the series, although some elements from the movie were written into the series.  Personally I found it interesting how the series turned Frank into less of the bible verse quoting serious person to a weasely buffoon.  Even the characters that stuck around for the series were quite different for the most part than how they were portrayed in the movie.  The only bonus on the movie DVD was a 25 min feature on the making of the movie with interviews with most of the cast members.  It is an interesting look at the chaos of the filming and how it launched the careers of many young actors that would go on to be pretty big stars.Then there are two discs devoted to the show.  There is a 30th Anniversary Reunion show that was filmed while Harry Morgan and Allan Arbus were still alive.  There is also the 1991 special that included interviews with McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville, and the A&E; Biography episode that was done on the show.  Along with all of that there are many behind the scenes features, Public Service announcement spots, and bloopers that were made while the show was still on the air.  Along with that there is a 25min feature with interviews from fans of the series and the script for an episode that was never produced.  Along with that an 10 question trivia game.  All in all you get everything MASH related aside from the failed spinoff series afterMASH.Ironically if the show premiered now it probably never last a full season because it had bad ratings in season 1.  It survived not only that, but 4 main cast members leaving (two of them after season 3) as well as multiple day/time slot changes, to go from teetering on the edge of cancellation to having its finale be the most watched show in the history of broadcast television.  It also took a lot of risks for its time.  It killed off a main character and discussed controversial issues some of which linger to this day.  It also was a launching pad for the careers of many young stars.  It is fun to see how many stars and future stars you can spot who guest starred on the show during its run.As I said before the content of the set is wonderful.  If you are a fan of the show you will love the content.  Dealing with the scratched discs however is a total pain, but I do not believe the material on the bonus discs is available in the individual season sets.  That is definitely something you have to weigh when considering this purchase. Chances are you know where you stand on the series as a whole, so it will come down to the bonus material.  Definitely watch it right away so you can do a return and swap out the defective discs if you get a couple that cannot be salvaged.",3,"Five star content, -2 star packaging",1392940800,"02 21,

I adore M*A*S*H (I'm 19 and have grown up with this show) and I've waited four years to get my hands on it. I couldn't afford it when it first came out, and wasn't too worried since I still was able to watch it on TV. I cannot do it anymore and decided that I should get this--- the price had definitely come down to something I can afford.The bonuses are just fabulous. The extension of the episodes is a great treat, my mother and I were just commenting on it. I was happy to see that it also included a little handbook and the actual movie as well as the reunion specials and bloopers and such. I have yet to watch them, but I do look forward to it. One of the other reasons for purchasing this fine collection.I have seen reviews on here about the packaging (one of the reasons I opened it immediately after getting it). At first I questioned it, but decided to get it anyway just because I really wanted it. Granted it's not the best but so far I have yet to have any problems with it. It plays perfectly in my DVD player. It wasn't as bad as people were saying. A couple of my DVD had that 'ring' but it wasn't so severe and although I haven't tested it out in my DVD player yet but I'm positive they will work. If it doesn't, there is always Displex to purchase to help out the DVDs affected.If you are a M*A*S*H fanatic like myself, this is a great treat!

1016173,AXYIW2PVCWTNU,B000HT3P5Q,Only review if I know,"[1, 16]","Since seeing this on the Wednesday before Turkey Day, packaged and priced lower than any other set, I was breathless when I read it had the movie. I immediately went to the last show in my mind, hearing and invisioning the helicopter taking off. Then to RADAR calling out the arrival of the same and I felt cruelly soothed in comfort.  I have been hearing the theme song and helicoptoers for 3 days. I want this set and can not afford it due to a committment of no buying due to Christmas in Disneyland!  If I buy it, I know I will not be able to resist my urge to watch the last episode first, then the movie, then the 11 seasons in order.  Yet this is not mash, one season at a time, aticipatied, wanted and to grow with. With the end at the end.  I could name off each and every character with no visual to look at to my 8 and 11 year old and yet trying to answer their question, I could not ever, begin, in any way to describe MASH. I know how you feel, the ones who feel burned by the slow release.  My first episode of  my beloved of all time  ""I Love Lucy"" started at $150, dropped to $100 and then rereleased at half that with each consecutive season narrower in box size (more episodes per disk) and less expensive. Yet like a real TV show, I got to re-experience the wait, the building of excitement as I got my hands on Season II then III etc.  It is not a ploy, I am a marketer. At the the time of release of the first season, no one believed the American Consumer would want nor pay for a huge bulk of disks. The cost, 11 seasons, oh, $750.  You can be angry or relish in the fact that you have the set, have what  I covet and now I must buy the set or can not see buying it at all, and then, my uncontrollable self will be at the last show first.  Your way is better. You are angry at Fox Media?  Then send your disks back, as, in the commercial, it says MASH so many dollars, the experience of now, priceless.  The fact my two kids walk around with in my daughter's case with a I Love Lucy Purse and Wallet  while imitating the Harpo Marx scene with her friends and brother as a challenge, and in my Son's case, parrating to me the expression, when I error, ""You have some e'splaining to do"" is worth every penny. They learned who John Wayne is, Harpo, Hedda Hooper, William Holden, Rock Hudson and more.  They learned as I did, it is OK to be a feisty red hed, (gray in my case at 48) . They learned my discussion re Fred of it is not Ok to refer to your wife as...... Finally, they both learned that the so often proclaimed words with the stomping of her right foot by Lucy, of ""But OHHHHH Ricky..... eventually always led to what we know, the women run the show no matter how loud the man barks... ""LUCY&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; so do me a favor and go listen to the theme song and a helicopter and veiw an epidisode where Hawkeye and Pierce make fun of Frank!  I cant buy the whole set and yet my mind says 11 seasons mutiplyed by 30 dollars and I only see one hundred dollars difference. Lots of money. So I put back the kids Guitar Hero on the shelve (eighty dollars)  and I am going to do it as should be, slowly, one by one.  Count your blessings.  Thanks Fox. For the topper, my kids were watching I love Lucy instead of today's selection of nonsense.

LOVE seeing all of the minutes of each episode that have been cut from syndication for years. Only a couple have made a real difference to the story, but I like getting more MASH this way. And without commerical interruption is wonderful of course.There are lots of comments elsewhere about the packaging. I found it fine myself. I have been able to handle all of the discs without any scratching on the heavy paperstock packaging. Actually, over the years, I have scratched more discs on the center posts of plastic cases by having the disc slide a little bit before settling in. So in some ways, I like this booklet style packaging better for a big set of discs.The outer box is a great display piece as well.One very minor criticism is on the design of the menus of a couple of seasons. Every episode of MASH begins wih the theme/credits. Through at least season five, you can skip the first chapter as you start the episode which skips only the opening credits. Somewhere about Season 6 (I think) the first chapter of the episodes is the opening credits AND a couple of minutes of the show. Which means if you skip chapter 1 as you could do all along, you miss a little bit of the episode and have to back up (or just FF through the credits and manually stop). This is true for 2-3 seasons and then it is back to the way it was done in the first five.Very minor gripe I know. But still something I could wish would be a little different. I guess the difference is because each season was worked on individully for DVD release and there were different folks making those decisions along the way.There is one episode along the way that is the syndicated version because the original, full length episode was not available anymore. So the episode is cut and it does not have the clarity of the rest of the remastered series.

All 11 seasons, the original movie and 2 discs of extras are really everything a Mash fan can hope for.  The packaging at first glance looks really great.  The outside looks like a real army kit, and when you open the box there is a notepad clipped to the inside.  But when you got to get your disc out, that is when the problems begin.  The 36 dvds are all placed in very tight and stiff cardboard slots.  Many of the dvds are already scratched when they were shoved in by workers at the warehouse packing them.  Those that escaped the initial round will be scratched when you try pulling them out yourself.  This is the worst design I have ever seen.  I don't know why they couldn't have gone with the standard snap in casing with overlapping.

It's obvious the manufacturer was going for aesthetics over practicality.This is a handsome set despite the cardboard slots that definitely affect the individual DVDs.As a collective work, the motion picture MASH and certain blocs of episodes deserve separate reviews.The Robert Altman film that preceded the television series is very different from most TV episodes.  If you saw the film first, your likely partial to the format and characters of the film, if you've grown up having only seen the television series you'll likely be put off by dark nature of the film.I love the show and grew up with it, but became a huge fan of the film while serving in the Army.With an amazing cast of actors: Robert Duvall, Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt and Elliot Gould the movie shares only Gary Burghoff (Radar O`Reilly) with the TV show.  if you appreciate Altman's style, you would be hard pressed to find a more definitive Altman film.The TV show became more of a collection of parables or anecdotal comedy, not often as dark and reflective as the film, but has its moments under the direction of Alan Alda.Early episodes drew on Altman's influence for inspiration and this is clearly obvious, but later episodes evolved to reflect an independent feel with cast members often taking a guest director`s role.  Many of the TV episodes featured contemporary issues in a Korean War setting.For a television series to last longer than the war it parodied is remarkable in its own right, but to have a final episode audience that rivals a Super Bowl secures MASH's place in TV history.",4,"The perfect way to kill an entire rainy day or two, or a painfully long flight.",1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,1756,"['Product', 'wise', 'M*A*S*H', 'Martinis', 'Medicine', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'fair', 'share', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'disc', 'storage', 'less', 'perfect', 'obvious', 'manufacturer', 'was', 'going', 'aesthetics', 'practicality.This', 'handsome', 'set', 'cardboard', 'definitely', 'affect', 'individual', 'DVDs.As', 'collective', 'work', 'motion', 'picture', 'MASH', 'certain', 'blocs', 'episodes', 'deserve', 'separate', 'reviews.The', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'preceded', 'television', 'series', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'TV', 'episodes', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'likely', 'partial', 'format', 'characters', 'film', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'television', 'series', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'dark', 'nature', 'film.I', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'film', 'serving', 'Army.With', 'amazing', 'cast', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'movie', 'shares', 'only', 'Gary', 'Burghoff', 'Radar', 'O', 'Reilly', 'TV', 'show', 'appreciate', 'Altman', 'style', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'more', 'definitive', 'Altman', 'film.The', 'TV', 'show', 'became', 'more', 'collection', 'parables', 'anecdotal', 'comedy', 'not', 'often', 'dark', 'reflective', 'film', 'moments', 'direction', 'Alan', 'Alda.Early', 'drew', 'Altman', 'influence', 'inspiration', 'clearly', 'obvious', 'later', 'evolved', 'reflect', 'independent', 'feel', 'cast', 'members', 'often', 'taking', 'guest', 'director', 's', 'role', 'Many', 'TV', 'episodes', 'featured', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'Korean', 'War', 'setting.For', 'television', 'series', 'last', 'longer', 'war', 'parodied', 'remarkable', 'own', 'right', 'have', 'final', 'episode', 'audience', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'MASH', 'place', 'TV', 'history']",N/A

But, maybe I'm asking for too much.  I'm the fool!  I guess I should just take it like a man.It took them more than 5 years to finally release every season individually, and with no extras.  I could have kept my kid's interested in watching these episodes with me, but they took so long completing the release of all the seasons, now they've grown up and don't care about this show anymore.Now, look at this low-cost box set with all the episodes, the original movie M*A*S*H (which I bought years ago, too), and all those extra features. When I saw this Box Set at the store, I almost cried!Those of us who spent about $400 buying this collection, now has so much less than somebody whose able to buy this whole show in ""one fell swoop"" (for less than half of what we all paid).I sure hope that they will release all those extras as a separate DVD package for those of us ""true from the beginning"" M*A*S*H fans who've patiently collected the series over the years.

The outside presentation is cool but the problem came when I opened it up.First off the binding wasn't glued on both sides. The hot glue strip was there but it apparently wasn't secured properly when they manufactured it and it had come loose. The equivalent of the back cover of a hardback just hanging there, not attached to the book binding at all.Most of the discs had slid out of their slots in transit and almost all of them were scratched to some degree. I attribute this to the lousy way they packaged the seasons. They went all out on the outside appearance of the boxed set then went with folded up cardboard sheets with pockets (no spindle or lining) for the discs. Even better the pockets were made by gluing two pieces of cardboard together and cutting slots into one sheet to form the pocket so even if you are careful the discs will get scratched with use. Oh and some of these sheets weren't even glued together properly so the discs would just fall out the bottom if you put them in their slots.Not usually one to gripe and though I fully intend to get a replacement hoping it is better I wanted to warn those who may be planning to send these out as gifts that they might want to look inside them first.And I was so looking forward to watching these over the holidays. Oh well here's hoping the replacement is in better shape.EDIT: 11/30/2007Got a replacement from Amazon. They shipped it next day before I even sent the other one back. I checked out the condition of the set and each disc. Everything is in good to great shape (some scratching/scuffing nothing major) and I look forward to watching them. Still not happy with the packaging though so might transfer everything into a disc carrier.If this were my first shipment I would rate this package a 4 only because of the design and risk to the discs.",2,"Nice collection, lousy packaging",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1933,"['collection', 'quite', 'thorough', 'why', 'decided', 'get', 'even', 'have', 'few', 'seasons', 'already', 'outside', 'presentation', 'cool', 'problem', 'came', 'when', 'opened', 'binding', 'was', ""n't"", 'glued', 'sides', 'hot', 'glue', 'strip', 'was', 'there', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'secured', 'properly', 'when', 'manufactured', 'had', 'come', 'loose', 'equivalent', 'back', 'cover', 'hardback', 'just', 'hanging', 'there', 'not', 'attached', 'book', 'binding', 'all.Most', 'discs', 'had', 'slid', 'slots', 'transit', 'almost', 'were', 'scratched', 'degree', 'attribute', 'lousy', 'way', 'packaged', 'seasons', 'went', 'out', 'outside', 'appearance', 'boxed', 'set', 'then', 'went', 'folded', 'up', 'cardboard', 'sheets', 'pockets', 'spindle', 'lining', 'discs', 'Even', 'better', 'pockets', 'were', 'made', 'gluing', 'two', 'pieces', 'cardboard', 'together', 'cutting', 'slots', 'one', 'sheet', 'form', 'pocket', 'so', 'even', 'are', 'careful', 'discs', 'will', 'get', 'scratched', 'use', 'Oh', 'sheets', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'glued', 'together', 'properly', 'so', 'discs', 'would', 'just', 'fall', 'out', 'bottom', 'put', 'slots.Not', 'usually', 'one', 'gripe', 'fully', 'intend', 'get', 'replacement', 'hoping', 'better', 'wanted', 'warn', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'planning', 'send', 'out', 'gifts', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'first.And', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'holidays', 'Oh', 'well', 'here', 'hoping', 'replacement', 'better', 'shape.EDIT', '11/30/2007Got', 'replacement', 'Amazon', 'shipped', 'next', 'day', 'even', 'sent', 'other', 'one', 'back', 'checked', 'out', 'condition', 'set', 'disc', 'Everything', 'good', 'great', 'shape', 'scratching/scuffing', 'nothing', 'major', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'Still', 'not', 'happy', 'packaging', 'so', 'might', 'transfer', 'everything', 'disc', 'carrier.If', 'were', 'first', 'shipment', 'would', 'rate', 'package', '4', 'only', 'design', 'risk', 'discs']",N/A
