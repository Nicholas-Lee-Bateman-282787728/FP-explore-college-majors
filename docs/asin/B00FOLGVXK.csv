1672324,ASYCQBBYFGGS2,B00FOLGVXK,"Harry Gene Neyhart ""hgn2001""","[16, 16]","The second review I ever wrote on Amazon.com was for the old Artisan DVD of THE CASSANDRA CROSSING back in 1999. I was thrilled to get the film in a letterboxed format on DVD after years of less-than-stellar presentations on VHS tape. And I remained happy with that purchase for some years as the letterbox version went out of print and was replaced by a pan and scan disc.As televisions evolved to larger and larger screens with higher and higher definition, I found that the old DVD of this film that I had been so thrilled with was now woefully inadequate. Though it was &#34;widescreen&#34;, it was presented within a 4:3 frame, resulting in one of those postage-stamp images. Zooming in with the TV just made the picture blurrier.Now Blu-ray to the rescue through Shout! Factory/Timeless Media Group. They've taken a pristine copy of the original movie and transferred it to Blu-ray, resulting in a high-definition image that needs to be seen to be believed. This almost forty-year-old movie has never looked better. The image is bright and sharp with proper film grain.This 2014 Blu-ray package contains two discs. One is a Blu-ray, the other is a remastered DVD. Each disc contains two movies (the other in THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE which I've never seen).Sound quality is adequate with the sole Dolby Digital soundtrack. There are no subtitles or closed captions.",5,Blu-ray debut for The Cassandra Crossing,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1366,"['second', 'review', 'ever', 'wrote', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'old', 'Artisan', 'DVD', 'THE', 'CASSANDRA', 'CROSSING', 'back', '1999', 'was', 'thrilled', 'get', 'film', 'letterboxed', 'format', 'DVD', 'years', 'less-than-stellar', 'presentations', 'VHS', 'tape', 'remained', 'happy', 'purchase', 'years', 'letterbox', 'version', 'went', 'print', 'was', 'replaced', 'pan', 'scan', 'disc.As', 'televisions', 'evolved', 'larger', 'larger', 'screens', 'higher', 'higher', 'definition', 'found', 'old', 'DVD', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'thrilled', 'was', 'now', 'woefully', 'inadequate', 'was', '34', 'widescreen', '34', 'was', 'presented', '4:3', 'frame', 'resulting', 'one', 'postage-stamp', 'images', 'Zooming', 'TV', 'just', 'made', 'picture', 'Blu-ray', 'rescue', 'Shout', 'Factory/Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'pristine', 'copy', 'original', 'movie', 'transferred', 'Blu-ray', 'resulting', 'high-definition', 'image', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'almost', 'forty-year-old', 'movie', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'image', 'bright', 'sharp', 'proper', 'film', 'grain.This', '2014', 'Blu-ray', 'package', 'two', 'discs', 'One', 'Blu-ray', 'other', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'disc', 'two', 'movies', 'other', 'THE', 'DOMINO', 'PRINCIPLE', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', '.Sound', 'quality', 'adequate', 'sole', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'subtitles', 'closed', 'captions']",N/A

1672327,ASRUYRC3R5J6Q,B00FOLGVXK,sasha,"[11, 12]","At noon on October 25th the Transcontinental Express left Geneva station with almost one thousand people on board.  Their destination: Basel, Paris, Brussel, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm.  NO ONE ARRIVED.Prior to the train leaving the station it was secretly boarded by a young man who had been exposed to the pneumonic plague after breaking into a secure facility in Geneva to steal drugs.  When it was discovered that this man was on board and that he was sick an attempt was made to transfer him to a helicopter but he died before that could be accomplished.Jonathan Chamberlan (Richard Harris) is a neurologist on board with his ex-wife Sophia Loren.  Burt Landaster (Colonel McKenzie) has been called in to handle the situation.  He re-directs the train to Nuremburg and has the train sealed and boarded with health workers and armed men to keep the passengers escaping.  Orders are that anyone leaving the train will be shot and killed.  (A similar situation occured in Pandora's Clock with an airplane full of allegedly infected passengers- great movie).The train will be routed across the Cassandra Crossing to a place in Poland where supposedly the people will be quarantined.  However, the Cassandra Crossing has not been used in years and is falling down in places.  Is Colonel McKenzie deliberately sending these people to their death?How Richard Harris & Sophia Loren manage the situation on the train; the fears of the passengers and how they manage to survive is the story.The Blu ray is clear - so clear you can see the sweat on people's foreheads.  The scenery is magnificent.  And the story is a great story and not so impossible when you remember the viruses already making people ill somewhere in the world.  There are NO Subtitles.  However, my hearing impaired husband could hear the movie well except when accents were used. The original &#34;the Cassandra Crossing&#34; on dvd has Closed Captioned for those of you interested.I do not believe that you can give the same rating to two different movies who are totally opposite.  Therefore, I am rating only one of the movies at a time.This is a favorite movie of mine.  I have had the original release from 1976 for many years and enjoyed it.  The Blu Ray has made everything clearer, sharper and easier to hear.",5,CASSANDRA CROSSING BLU RAY DVD,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2292,"['noon', 'October', '25th', 'Transcontinental', 'Express', 'left', 'Geneva', 'station', 'almost', 'one', 'thousand', 'people', 'board', 'destination', 'Basel', 'Paris', 'Brussel', 'Amsterdam', 'Copenhagen', 'Stockholm', 'ONE', 'ARRIVED.Prior', 'train', 'leaving', 'station', 'was', 'secretly', 'boarded', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'exposed', 'pneumonic', 'plague', 'breaking', 'secure', 'facility', 'Geneva', 'steal', 'drugs', 'When', 'was', 'discovered', 'man', 'was', 'board', 'was', 'sick', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'transfer', 'helicopter', 'died', 'could', 'be', 'accomplished.Jonathan', 'Chamberlan', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'neurologist', 'board', 'ex-wife', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Burt', 'Landaster', 'Colonel', 'McKenzie', 'been', 'called', 'handle', 'situation', 'train', 'Nuremburg', 'train', 'sealed', 'boarded', 'health', 'workers', 'armed', 'men', 'keep', 'passengers', 'escaping', 'Orders', 'are', 'anyone', 'leaving', 'train', 'will', 'be', 'shot', 'killed', 'similar', 'situation', 'occured', 'Pandora', 'Clock', 'airplane', 'full', 'allegedly', 'infected', 'passengers-', 'great', 'movie', '.The', 'train', 'will', 'be', 'routed', 'Cassandra', 'Crossing', 'place', 'Poland', 'where', 'supposedly', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'quarantined', 'However', 'Cassandra', 'Crossing', 'not', 'been', 'used', 'years', 'falling', 'down', 'places', 'Colonel', 'McKenzie', 'deliberately', 'sending', 'people', 'death', 'How', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'manage', 'situation', 'train', 'fears', 'passengers', 'how', 'manage', 'survive', 'story.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'clear', 'so', 'clear', 'can', 'see', 'sweat', 'people', 'foreheads', 'scenery', 'magnificent', 'story', 'great', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'impossible', 'when', 'remember', 'viruses', 'already', 'making', 'people', 'ill', 'somewhere', 'world', 'are', 'Subtitles', 'However', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'husband', 'could', 'hear', 'movie', 'well', 'when', 'accents', 'were', 'used', 'original', '34', 'Cassandra', 'Crossing', '34', 'dvd', 'Closed', 'Captioned', 'interested.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'can', 'give', 'same', 'rating', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'opposite', 'Therefore', 'am', 'rating', 'only', 'one', 'movies', 'time.This', 'favorite', 'movie', 'mine', 'have', 'had', 'original', 'release', '1976', 'many', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'made', 'everything', 'clearer', 'sharper', 'easier', 'hear']",N/A
