1462864,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005J039H2,Einsatz,"[9, 11]","Normally, I love these types of films: a throwback to the kind of monster movies made during the 80s.  There's your standard secret lab, the obligatory connection to the military, the experiment that has gone bad AND escapes, and the hapless locals who have to deal with it (IT, being the title character).  It's a solid formula that's difficult to screw up.  While I won't go so far as to say they totally botched the job, some of it is quite fun and entertaining, but I have to say it wasn't something I'd like to keep for future viewings.  Inconsistent is the kindest term I can apply to this movie.  It felt as if there were two different directors doing the work and the final results just didn't mesh.  There are the anemic sections when nothing but talk happens, and then there are the frenetic action/kill sequences that literally explode on the screen.  Both parts are done in two completely different styles of filmmaking.  One part is fun to watch because it's totally crazy and yes, a little messy/bloody.  The other part is slow, tedious, and at all time static.  Slap these two parts together and what you end up with is a film that's barely adequate.  I didn't mind watching it, but that's about it.

1462866,A3MCD82QVBLWRX,B005J039H2,Hunter,"[1, 4]","Dinowolf is actually a released in 2009 film called Dire Wolf - which is more accurate (in that there was such an animal but definitely not in the time of the dinosaurs - and not related to dinosaurs, but hey...My problem though is more with the fact that none of the reviews have any note of the things Fred is normally noted for and IMDB has no commentaries from anyone about it.  Weird for this kind of film.  I am going to take as wild guess that that is because most of the natural audience did not see this and the few who may have really had little to say.  This implies no nudity (female) - and who would, with no offense, really  wish to see Gil naked.  It also implies special effects not good enough for comment, though possibly not bad enough for same either.  Overall I have to go with my impression that I have no reason to buy/watch this film.  So I won't.

If it had been, such a great title wouldn't have been wasted. No new plot twists here. No spoilers really possible in this all too predictable made for DVD monster flick. Basically, it's a genetically engineered werewolf type monster that can run around in daylight. Lower shooting cost, no doubt. The daylight does hurt the suspense factor. The kills are numerous and messy. The acting is a bit better than average. Over all it's your standard monster movie fair. No nudity. But enough gore to please the average teenage fan-boy.

1462870,A1QYHMXSARAHO4,B005J039H2,Plank Spanker,"[1, 3]","In this day of poor quality, unrealistic, pathetic computer generated ""creatures"" it's nice to see that there are still those who have the ability to do a bang up job of equally god awful old school ""man in a monkey suit"" style creature effects.  Except this creature is a man in a monkey suit with a bear/wolf head.  Add to that the bad acting and poor directing and you have a sure fire competitor for "" Worst Movie Ever Made"" award.  The failure ofthis pic is more the fault of the writting staff and director than anything.  Here is an example;  the sheriff, played by actor Maxwell Caufield, in the middle of what should be a suspensful night time creature attack scene suddenly has his own attack.....of O C D....ventures outside the building they have been trapped in by the creature to straighten a crooked  sign and is viscously attacked right in front of the game warden (Blake Griffith) who is also his son.  Instead of being disturbed AT ALL, it's more like ""oh well"" and business as usual.  Almost every scene has comparable and similar failings.  Other main players are Dawn Ann Billings, Kristen Howe, and Kimberly Horner,  among others, and sad thing is some of these people can act at least moderately well.  The story line has potential, but the script failed period.  Too bad, too sad.  The theme of genetic experimentation gone wrong has been utilized extensively over the past decade or so but lends to the interpretation of the cast and production crew. While this attempt displayed imagination there was no real creativity.
