Once they make their way into the boat, they find someone is living there.

However whether you like this movie or not totally depends on your own mental make up and how you grew up and WHERE you grew up. Part of this is what would be called &#34;coming of age&#34; because of the prominent roles that the two young boys played. That part carried me back to my own childhood in several ways. The movie had adventure, drama, a bit of romance in a shallow sort of way, and the coming of age part. If you were reared in the city you probably wouldn't enjoy this movie. If you were reared in a small rural town or in the country you may well love it. McConaughey was really &#34;in character&#34; as I have never seem him before and IMHO did an outstanding job with his character. The two young boys, I forget their names, also did a great job of acting. The supporting roles were mostly done very well also.

1648912,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00CMT52T6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","At the heart of `Mud' is a coming of age tale about adolescence, innocence and love.  This was surprising to me, and quite moving to be honest.  I didn't expect something so honest and `simple' to come from a film seemingly so much darker.  That isn't to say that `Mud' doesn't have thrilling elements, and it certainly reaches levels of darkness, but at its core it is something softer, kinder and more delicate.It is richer than I expected.`Mud' tells the story of fourteen year-old Ellis, a young boy living on a river in Arkansas.  His family is riddled with turmoil as his parents fight in the open air and make plans to separate.  Ellis and his friend Neckbone escape their homelives by venturing down river to a small island where Neckbone found a boat in a tree that the two plan to use as a clubhouse of sorts.  The problem is that the boat is occupied by a strange man named Mud who is awaiting the arrival of his girlfriend, Juniper.  He cannot leave the island, for reasons he leaves a mystery, but strikes a friendship with the boys, who agree to bring him food in exchange for the boat.While the main draw to the film is of course the mystery surrounding Mud's backstory, and don't get me wrong because it certainly is exciting and worth sticking around for, the real soul of the film comes from the development of Ellis and the unveiling of his emotional development.  As Ellis reflects on his homelife, his parent's marriage and the threat to lose his home, the girl he thinks he loves and the realization that love is not as easy as you want it to be, and then having him live vicariously through Mud, soaking in his stories and falling in love with his charm and the ideals he represents, he become drawn to Ellis and completely enwrapped in his tale.  While Mud's story may be the flashy central point in the story, it is Ellis's tale that haunts us long after the credits have finished rolling.I'm excited for where Jeff Nichols' career is going to lead him.  I have yet to see `Shotgun Stories', but both `Mud' and `Take Shelter' are remarkable films that show so much unique vision and potential for greatness.  I see a masterpiece in his near future.  `Mud' is through provoking and atmospheric, using the river and the light to create such charged appeal.  Even the running length feels organic thanks to the way that Nichols worked out every detail.I would like to take a second to address Hollywood's ridiculous bias against young male actors.  All this attention on Matthew McConaughey's career revival and his performance here being a `career best' (he's very good, surprisingly) only masks the fact that this film is not his.  Mud, while a title character, is a supporting one.  This is purely Ellis's story, and young Tye Sheridan carries this film with such authentic grace.  In fact, both he and Jacob Lofland are better than McConaughey here.  If Ellis had been a female and had been played by someone like Hailee Steinfeld then you can bet your bottom dollar someone would be trying to push for a category fraud campaign to get her a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.  Sadly, no one will do that for Sheridan, despite the fact that his performance is achingly effective.  He handles everything with such natural enlightenment.  You can feel him embrace Mud with a sense of adolescent wonderment, capitalizing on Ellis's innocence and naivety and yet as he discovers the nasty truth regarding love and life he begins to melt away and become hardened.  Contrasting his father's jilted views with Mud's fantastical coloring to strike an accurate balance is beautifully played and honestly felt.It's just a beautifully honed performance.",5,A unique vision sails home...,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3670,"['heart', 'Mud', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'adolescence', 'innocence', 'love', 'was', 'surprising', 'quite', 'moving', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'so', 'honest', 'simple', 'come', 'film', 'seemingly', 'so', 'much', 'darker', ""n't"", 'say', 'Mud', ""n't"", 'have', 'thrilling', 'elements', 'certainly', 'levels', 'darkness', 'core', 'something', 'softer', 'kinder', 'more', 'delicate.It', 'richer', 'expected.', 'Mud', 'story', 'fourteen', 'year-old', 'Ellis', 'young', 'boy', 'living', 'river', 'Arkansas', 'family', 'riddled', 'turmoil', 'parents', 'fight', 'open', 'air', 'make', 'plans', 'separate', 'Ellis', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'escape', 'homelives', 'venturing', 'down', 'river', 'small', 'island', 'where', 'Neckbone', 'found', 'boat', 'tree', 'two', 'plan', 'use', 'clubhouse', 'sorts', 'problem', 'boat', 'occupied', 'strange', 'man', 'named', 'Mud', 'who', 'awaiting', 'arrival', 'girlfriend', 'Juniper', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'island', 'reasons', 'mystery', 'friendship', 'boys', 'who', 'agree', 'bring', 'food', 'exchange', 'boat.While', 'main', 'draw', 'film', 'course', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Mud', 'backstory', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'certainly', 'exciting', 'worth', 'sticking', 'real', 'soul', 'film', 'development', 'Ellis', 'unveiling', 'emotional', 'development', 'Ellis', 'homelife', 'parent', 'marriage', 'threat', 'lose', 'home', 'girl', 'realization', 'love', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'want', 'be', 'then', 'having', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Mud', 'soaking', 'stories', 'falling', 'love', 'charm', 'ideals', 'drawn', 'Ellis', 'completely', 'enwrapped', 'tale', 'Mud', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'flashy', 'central', 'point', 'story', 'Ellis', 'tale', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling.I', ""'m"", 'excited', 'where', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'career', 'going', 'lead', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Shotgun', 'Stories', 'Mud', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'are', 'remarkable', 'films', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'unique', 'vision', 'potential', 'greatness', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'near', 'future', 'Mud', 'provoking', 'atmospheric', 'using', 'river', 'light', 'create', 'such', 'charged', 'appeal', 'Even', 'running', 'length', 'feels', 'organic', 'thanks', 'way', 'Nichols', 'worked', 'out', 'detail.I', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'second', 'address', 'Hollywood', 'ridiculous', 'bias', 'young', 'male', 'actors', 'attention', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'career', 'revival', 'performance', 'here', 'being', 'career', 'best', 'very', 'good', 'surprisingly', 'only', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'Mud', 'title', 'character', 'supporting', 'one', 'purely', 'Ellis', 'story', 'young', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'film', 'such', 'authentic', 'grace', 'fact', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'are', 'better', 'McConaughey', 'here', 'Ellis', 'had', 'been', 'female', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'then', 'can', 'bet', 'bottom', 'dollar', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'push', 'category', 'fraud', 'campaign', 'get', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Sadly', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'Sheridan', 'fact', 'performance', 'achingly', 'effective', 'everything', 'such', 'natural', 'enlightenment', 'can', 'feel', 'embrace', 'Mud', 'sense', 'adolescent', 'wonderment', 'capitalizing', 'Ellis', 'innocence', 'naivety', 'yet', 'nasty', 'truth', 'regarding', 'love', 'life', 'melt', 'away', 'become', 'hardened', 'Contrasting', 'father', 'jilted', 'views', 'Mud', 'fantastical', 'coloring', 'strike', 'accurate', 'balance', 'beautifully', 'played', 'honestly', 'felt.It', 'just', 'beautifully', 'honed', 'performance']",N/A

Silva ""Superman_242""","[2, 4]","Disclaimer: This review is for the film itself, not the blu-ray itself.If you watch the trailer for this film, it gives you almost no idea as to what the movie's theme is.  I watched it twice and had virtually no clue, so I more or less went in blind.  This is actually a preferable method of seeing movies, because you aren't tainted or spoiled from a trailer.THE BADNothing.THE GOODOnce or twice a year I see a movie that fits in the category ""There's no good time to get up and use the restroom.""  This movie was so compelling and well-paced that I prolonged my bathroom break until I could hold it no longer.  Every single scene is purposeful and compelling.  It never drags.The acting by all is phenomenal, but Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of his life.  He was himself, but subtly different.  I found myself thinking more than once: ""Is this really the guy from Sahara?""  I'm not positive he will get nominated for an Oscar for this role, but he certainly will be considered.  Also, the main teenage boy is remarkably believable and likable. I certainly hope we see him again.As opposed to many movies about the South, this film paints a picture of the it that is very rich and realistic.  It never treats the culture with contempt, although I can't say that it's an endearing depiction either.It is beautifully and subtly shot.  The color palette matches the story, shapes the mood, and the shots are never shots for shots' sake.CONCLUSIONI adored this movie.  It's my favorite movie of the year so far, although there's not a lot of great competition.  If you enjoy Independent cinema, then you will most certainly enjoy this beautifully simple piece of cinema.  However, if you consider yourself to be more mainstream, then this is not for you.  4.75/5 stars.PARENTS GUIDEThere is quite a bit of language and some violence, particularly where one women is thrown around by a man.

1649048,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00CMT52T6,Darren,"[0, 0]","With &#34;Mud&#34;, writer/director Jeff Nichols not only takes on the themes and setting of Mark Twain's famous novels about Huck and Tom, but, perhaps more interestingly, he actually takes the time to study honest masculinity.  The male is on display in many of his recognizable guises: the vagabond, the depressed laborer whose line of work is little more than subsistence and nostalgia, the uncle who acts younger than his age, the aging warrior.  And, of course, the boys: two 14-year-olds who have the entire summer and the region of southeastern Arkansas at their disposal.  You can call this guise Boyhood at Twilight, that brief interlude after childhood but before driver's permits and lukewarm airy beer drunk from red Solo cups.  It's an age mostly characterized by inner pain, pain brought about by a general sense of disillusionment about things.  Innocence slips away, and the world comes into focus.  Exiting childhood is our second shocking birth.Our main hero is Ellis, played by Tye Sheridan.  He and his buddy Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) spend their days rattling along the dusty roads on Neckbone's dirtbike or putting across the Arkansas River on Ellis' skiff, looking for stuff to get into.  There's a great moment near the beginning of the film as the boys are motoring past the narrow familiar banks: suddenly, an endless horizon ahead of sea and sky.  (OK, film students, that's what's called a Symbol.)  And sure enough, once they bank up on a small island prone to getting completely submerged in floods, they find a filthy-looking Matthew McConaughey.  The kids had been looking to retrieve a boat that had wrecked near the top of a tall tree, but discover McConaughey has been living in it.  Why?  Because he's on the run from the law and from bounty hunters.  The cops want to arrest him; the bounty hunters want to kill him.  The boys have found their new project for the summer: getting the man off the island.McConaughey convinces as the tattered vagabond.  He speaks in a strange cadence and he's a little kooky, but he's also skilled in the masculine arts of knot-tying, cigarette smoking, pistol packing, bonfire making, and boat-building.  The boys are inevitably enraptured, but I note that Neckbone (the Tom Sawyer stand-in, I'm guessing) requires a little more time to be convinced.  &#34;BS!&#34; he coughs to Ellis as McConaughey is describing his beautiful girlfriend.  &#34;What do WE get out of it?&#34; he asks after McConaughey asks them to help him out.  Somehow I'm not worried about Neckbone, despite his dingy, impoverished circumstances living with his uncle.  One gets the feeling he'll make out in life.Not so sure about Ellis, though, despite his smile at the end of the picture -- in fact, because of it.  After what the movie puts him through, he should know better.  He's a natural romantic, a true Southerner.  He's quick to throw a punch and fancies himself tough enough to take one.  He gets awfully wrapped up in fixing the romance between McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon: he eagerly passes notes between his miserable island and her motel.  (Poor Neckbone doubtfully and rather wearily tags along.)  Females mystify him.  Having suckerpunched a senior who was bothering a girl he's had his eye on, he assumes that he's now the girl's knight-errant, despite being at least 2 or 3 years younger than her.  His parents are divorcing because his mother no longer wants to live on the houseboat where his dad hopelessly plies his subsistence trade of selling fish caught from the river -- this upsets the romantic Ellis.  &#34;I'm not a townie!&#34; he says to his father on the prospect of moving into apartment with his mom after the divorce.  He's not realistic, and it will hurt him later in life.  Sam Shepard as the weird old neighbor across the river tries to set the kid straight on a few points, but he ain't having any of it.The women in &#34;Mud&#34; act out of mysterious motives -- mysterious to the men, at least.  McConaughey always finds excuses for Witherspoon's behavior.  Ellis' mom is hardly in the film -- we get to know her mostly through the conversations between Ellis and his bitter father (Ray McKinnon).  The young girls kiss you one minute, call you &#34;just some kid&#34; the next.

1649050,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00CMT52T6,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","""Mud"" was probably a hard film to market because its themes are difficult to pigeonhole.  Centered around the banks of the Mississippi it concerns itself with two fourteen year old friends, Ellis(Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), whose bond is probably forged by less than ideal home lives.  Ellis' parents are on the cusp of separation and Neckbone lives with an uncle his natural parents nowhere to be found.  They have a secret hideaway on a desert island on the river and one day they find an interloper to their idyll, Mud(Matthew McConaughey).  Rumpled in appearance with a pistol strapped to his waist Mud relates a tale of him being on the run from bounty hunters because he killed a man who was abusing the love of his life, Juniper(Reese Witherspoon).  The boys are taken in by these tales of alleged gallantry and start doing favors for Mud.  It begins with them bringing him food, then passing messages to Juniper, and finally scrounging parts for Mud's boat.  The message here is twofold.  ""Mud"" illustrates the rocky road from adolescence to the teen years and secondly how the impressionable clamor for romance even if it is far removed from the truth.  McConaughey is absolutely spellbinding as the rascal Mud and the two newcomers are screen naturals who seem to be playing real teens and not facsimiles.  Director-writer Jeff Nichols not only crafts a terrific script but establishes an eerie mood to accompany his words.

1649101,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00CMT52T6,Doug Anderson,"[8, 12]","Alright alright alright. MUD is about that moment in our lives when our crazy dreams about life come into contact with its even crazier realities. MUD is a mix of Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald with a splash of GOONIES, WINTERS BONE and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD.  As he did in The Paperboy and Killer Joe, McConnaughey tones down the pretty boy image and completely disappears into this role.  It's a standout performance in a film that also features notable performance by Sam Shepard, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Shannon, and a whole host of newcomers.(In a role that had to have been written for him and him alone) Matthew McConnaughey plays a hard-living sociopathic castaway kept alive by a steady diet of romantic readiness and a rather less steady diet of Beanie Weenie.  Like all American dreamers (and MUD is really a distillation of them all), he is completely out of touch with the world as it actually is and a practiced master of the art of self-deception, and, as is the case with so many American dreamers, it's this eternally renewed self-deception that allows him to remain innocent despite his years of experience. Or at least from a distance he appears to be innocent, but when we get up close his gritty drifter skin and his empty stare seem to tell the part of his tales that he dare not speak aloud.  When two 14 year-old Arkansas boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find him living in a boat stranded in the treetop of an uninhabited isle, one, Neckbone, immediately assumes he's a bum but the other, Ellis (played by one of the best kid actors I've ever seen), senses something noble and even inspiring about his determination to dream big despite the fact that he has nothing in this world but a dirty shirt, a rusty Colt 45, and an old boat stuck up in a tree (that he's claimed as his own). It's through Mud that they get their initiation into life and it's through them that he gets his.This doesn't sound like your typical coming-of-age story and it isn't. For one, most kids never meet much less befriend a homeless man (and, possibly, a murderer) who lives (for the moment) on a swampy copperhead-infested isle.  But these aren't your normal kids, these are river kids, born and raised on riverboats and moored to a way of life that dates back a good two-hundred or more years. These are not suburban kids. They do not even have computers nor do you get the idea that they've ever seen one. They don't even have tvs. They're not interested in ""that life."" They spend every spare second they have exploring the rivers many estuaries and venturing out  further and further toward ever bigger bodies of water. These kids are adventurers.  They are in search of life (and everything that word suggests).  They are aearching for the same thing their daddies searched for (but maybe didn't find or haven't yet found).  They mind their daddies (or uncles) and they respect them and talk like them and gather what wisdom they have just as their daddies did -- by listening and watching how other people live and absorbing whatever they can from whoever they can, but they are young and idealistic and they are not ready to settle down just yet. There is a wildness in them that they need to explore first, especially in Ellis. And Elllis sees that same wildness in Mud.  As unlikely as the friendship is between Ellis and Mud, it also makes sense: they are each at a crucial point in their own coming-of-age stories and each seems particularly suited to offer the other some much-needed and sought-for insight and perspective.Part of the appeal of this film is that it features two roughhewn American figures in Ellis and Mud and that they make such a perfect team. One is still genuinely innocent while the other has never really figured out how to make that transition from childlike innocence/idealism to adult experience. What really attracts Ellis to Mud is the way he talks about his lifelong love. The other adults in Ellis's life (mainly his parents) have been worn down by their relationships but Mud is enlivened by love.  And that appeals to Ellis and helps encourage his own bourgeoning romanticism. The difficult thing for both Ellis and Mud is figuring out how best to adjust and align their romantic notions/expectations with actual reality instead of making one the enemy of the other.  Mud has never been much good at learning from experience and adjusting his sites and expectations as he goes but, as romantic as he might be, Ellis is a quick learner and Ellis seems to be the one person Mud is willing to learn from. So MUD works as an interesting twist on The Great Gatsby: Mud can be viewed as the eternally romantic Gatsby kept afloat by dreams and Ellis can be viewed as the much more grounded Nick Carraway. It's not so much that Mud's version of Daisy, Juniper (played by a hot-blooded, booty-shorted Reese Witherspoon), is a bad girl or unworthy of his affection, it's just that she knows that no human being can be asked to accompany a dreamer to their own private dream lair and that's the only reality that Mud has ever known.  He loves her, but she always runs away. She loves him, but he lives in his own private world. They've played this dangerous game of attraction/repulsion their entire lives without understanding it. And Ellis (like Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby) becomes the messenger who must read each character and translate each to the other. And Ellis proves magnificently capable at this task.So after some near-lethal run-ins with a den of copperheads, a girl named May Pearl, and a band of pissed-off redneck assassins (seems the guy Mud killed awhile back has a lot of angry friends) everyone comes of age in a satisfying way.  Great film.  McConnaughey is on a streak. Also fun to see Sam Shepard in this story since this is exactly the kind of tale (doomed lovers ensnared by one another) he has been telling his entire life. Witherspoon is perfect as well. But the real break out star is the child actor, Tye Sheridan (Ellis). A must-see.",5,Masterpiece,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,6052,"['Alright', 'alright', 'alright', 'MUD', 'moment', 'lives', 'when', 'crazy', 'dreams', 'life', 'come', 'contact', 'even', 'crazier',

1649108,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00CMT52T6,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Set in rural Arkansas, MUD is at heart a coming-of-age story in which fourteen-year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) learn something about the realities of existence - that people's motives are not quite what they seem; that love involves complicated emotions; and one should not place one's trust too much in other human beings.  This gradual process of discovering self-awareness evolves through regular encounters with the eponymous hero Mud (Matthew McConaughey).  Mud himself experiences a similar process of self-discovery, even though his emotions are clouded by an enduring - and perhaps futile - attachment to childhood sweetheart Juniper (Reese Witherspoon).  Beautifully shot by director Jeff Nichols, the film sets this story against a backdrop of a vanishing way of life, as Ellis' family discover that life on a houseboat can no longer sustain them.  The film ends in elegaic mood: just as Ellis discovers something about himself, he is forced to leave the river and live with his mother in an anonymous condo.  What spoils MUD, however, is its sprawling structure; within its two-hour running-time it tries to cram in a revenge plot, a subplot involving Mud and his closest childhood friend Tom (Sam Shepard), and a gun-battle at the end that seems quite at odds with what has gone before.  Nonetheless MUD is worth looking at, especially for its photography (by Adam Stone).",3,Beautifully Set and Filmed Coming of Age Story that is Structurally All Over the Place,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1422,"['Set', 'rural', 'Arkansas', 'MUD', 'heart', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'fourteen-year-old', 'Ellis', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'learn', 'something', 'realities', 'existence', 'people', 'motives', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'love', 'involves', 'complicated', 'emotions', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'place', 'one', 'trust', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'gradual', 'process', 'discovering', 'self-awareness', 'evolves', 'regular', 'encounters', 'eponymous', 'hero', 'Mud', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Mud', 'similar', 'process', 'self-discovery', 'even', 'emotions', 'are', 'clouded', 'enduring', 'perhaps', 'futile', 'attachment', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Juniper', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'film', 'story', 'backdrop', 'vanishing', 'way', 'life', 'Ellis', 'family', 'discover', 'life', 'houseboat', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'sustain', 'film', 'elegaic', 'mood', 'just', 'Ellis', 'something', 'forced', 'leave', 'river', 'live', 'mother', 'anonymous', 'condo', 'What', 'MUD', 'however', 'sprawling', 'structure', 'two-hour', 'running-time', 'cram', 'revenge', 'plot', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Mud', 'closest', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Tom', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'gun-battle', 'end', 'quite', 'odds', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'Nonetheless', 'MUD', 'worth', 'looking', 'especially', 'photography', 'Adam', 'Stone']",N/A
1649109,A3LGDXHXYBMGCY,B00CMT52T6,drollere,"[1, 1]","""mud"" has many things going for it -- a strong script, great acting, believable and compelling characters, and the foreboding of cottonmouth country. the four subplots (marriage, reunion, revenge and first love) are motivated by the same premise: how a woman can make a man suffer, and where that can lead when love goes bad. each subplot is enriched by various male relationships: father/son, love competitor or mortal enemy, same age buddy or cross generational mentor. there is shadow and light across every relationship and all the characterizations blend as a result of superb casting. the script has a clockwork quality in which every detail has significance in the whole; both the cinematography and sequence editing are technically impressive but shaped to tell the human story. the focus is on relationships in a small southern river town, how the people came to where they are and how they move forward; you're pulled into the story as if you're living it, and this dictates a leisurely pace that is part of the storytelling and that allows you to linger with scenes the way you'd pause over a memorable passage in a novel. i want to alert viewers to the subtle fairytale elements in the film -- a boat in a tree, a lone boy approaching an island forest at night, a damsel in distress standing on a balcony, a sky that fills with birds when a man talks of love, a woman who casts dark spells on men, killers who plot revenge with prayer, two boys performing the quests set for them by a man who appears from nowhere wearing talismans and spinning tales -- these magical elements serve as highlights on the realism and guide our emotional intuitions about the characters. mcconaughey gives an insightful and unsentimental performance as the drifter who struggles to master his past and his passion, tye sheridan is very strong as the boy trying to become a man despite betrayal by those he trusts, and ray mckinnon is deeply affecting as the father trying to salvage his family, home and masculine identity. it's a mark of the high quality of the production that sam shepard and michael shannon accepted relatively minor roles to be a part of it. i loved this film, and i will be very disappointed if it does not get some 2013 best picture nominations.",5,one of the year's best pictures,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,2261,"['mud', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'strong', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'believable', 'compelling', 'characters', 'foreboding', 'cottonmouth', 'country', 'four', 'subplots', 'marriage', 'reunion', 'revenge', 'first', 'love', 'are', 'motivated', 'same', 'premise', 'how', 'woman', 'can', 'make', 'man', 'suffer', 'where', 'can', 'lead', 'when', 'love', 'bad', 'subplot', 'enriched', 'various', 'male', 'relationships', 'father/son', 'love', 'competitor', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'same', 'age', 'buddy', 'cross', 'generational', 'mentor', 'shadow', 'light', 'relationship', 'characterizations', 'blend', 'result', 'superb', 'casting', 'script', 'clockwork', 'quality', 'detail', 'significance', 'whole', 'cinematography', 'sequence', 'editing', 'are', 'technically', 'impressive', 'shaped', 'tell', 'human', 'story', 'focus', 'relationships', 'small', 'southern', 'river', 'town', 'how', 'people', 'came', 'where', 'are', 'how', 'move', 'forward', ""'re"", 'pulled', 'story', ""'re"", 'living', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'part', 'storytelling', 'linger', 'scenes', 'way', ""'d"", 'pause', 'memorable', 'passage', 'novel', 'i', 'want', 'alert', 'viewers', 'subtle', 'fairytale', 'elements', 'film', 'boat', 'tree', 'lone', 'boy', 'approaching', 'island', 'forest', 'night', 'damsel', 'distress', 'standing', 'balcony', 'sky', 'birds', 'when', 'man', 'talks', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'dark', 'spells', 'men', 'killers', 'who', 'plot', 'revenge', 'prayer', 'two', 'boys', 'performing', 'quests', 'set', 'man', 'who', 'nowhere', 'wearing', 'talismans', 'spinning', 'tales', 'magical', 'elements', 'serve', 'highlights', 'realism', 'guide', 'emotional', 'intuitions', 'characters', 'mcconaughey', 'insightful', 'unsentimental', 'performance', 'drifter', 'who', 'master', 'past', 'passion', 'tye', 'sheridan', 'very', 'strong', 'boy', 'trying', 'become', 'man', 'betrayal', 'ray', 'mckinnon', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'father', 'trying', 'salvage', 'family', 'home', 'masculine', 'identity', 'mark', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'shepard', 'michael', 'shannon', 'accepted', 'relatively', 'minor', 'roles', 'be', 'part', 'i', 'loved', 'film', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'not', 'get', '2013', 'best', 'picture', 'nominations']",N/A

""Stand By Me"" comes right to mind as a classic coming of age story. Well this Matthew McConaughey lead film is right up there as one of those done right. Now I have always liked Matt and never really understood the hate that people place on him. I will admit that I have liked some of his romantic comedies. I went to my Aunt's house to see this movie as we all do from time to time. After it was over we all agreed that ""Mud"" was a really good film.Ellis and Neckbone are best friends and are always looking to have a good time and go on that great adventure we all dream of. They find their chance when they decide to go to a small island on the Mississippi in Arkansas. Once there they find a boat that is up in a tree, they have to investigate. They soon realize [after finding some interesting reading material] that someone is living there. A drifter named ""Mud"" who befriends the kids and even gets them to help him out. Just what he wants their help for leads the boys into the biggest and most dangerous adventure they will ever know.Writer/director Jeff Nichols' did an excellent job with this film as his direction and script flowed so smoothly. A story like this in the wrong hands or off just a bit in the writing department could easily have been for lack of a better word boring. But Nichols' manages to keep you hooked until the credits role in this tale of love, betrayal, murder, and growing up. Also the look and feel of this film only adds to the experience, you almost feel like you are there.This movie was also superbly acted by the entire cast, from the leads to the supporters. Most of the praise has gone to McConauahey and rightfully so as he has been on a role lately with his performances. He is great here as Mud and from what I have read he was actually who Nichols' wrote the part for in the 90's or something like that. Nay way I have to say that the two kids here [Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland] did just as good as their famous co star. This story really is more about them and Tye's ""Ellis"" in particular. It is through Ellis that the story moves and thus the role had to have been cast perfectly, it was. Also all three of these character's guardians were just as well cast and all play a major role in the personalities of the lead trio.This was a great movie full of great scenery and cinematography that gives this Arkansas based film a feeling of being real. The characters here seem like real people and it is because of that that you actually care about these people. Now this is not the greatest movie ever made, at least to me, but it is a really good one that I would recommend. this is a really well made drama that has made my list of best I have seen this year.",5,GREAT COMING OF AGE STORY THAT IS MORE THAN THAT,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,2796,"['MUDComing', 'age', 'stories', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'are', 'done', 'right', 'Stand', 'Me', 'right', 'mind', 'classic', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Well', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'lead', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'done', 'right', 'Now', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Matt', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'hate', 'people', 'place', 'will', 'admit', 'have', 'liked', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'went', 'Aunt', 'house', 'see', 'movie', 'do', 'time', 'time', 'was', 'agreed', 'Mud', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'film.Ellis', 'Neckbone', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'go', 'great', 'adventure', 'dream', 'find', 'chance', 'when', 'decide', 'go', 'small', 'island', 'Mississippi', 'Arkansas', 'Once', 'find', 'boat', 'up', 'tree', 'have', 'investigate', 'soon', 'realize', '[', 'finding', 'interesting', 'reading', 'material', ']', 'someone', 'living', 'there', 'drifter', 'named', 'Mud', 'who', 'kids', 'even', 'help', 'out', 'Just', 'what', 'help', 'boys', 'biggest', 'most', 'dangerous', 'adventure', 'will', 'ever', 'know.Writer/director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'direction', 'script', 'flowed', 'so', 'smoothly', 'story', 'wrong', 'hands', 'off', 'just', 'bit', 'writing', 'department', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'boring', 'Nichols', 'manages', 'keep', 'hooked', 'credits', 'role', 'tale', 'love', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'growing', 'up', 'Also', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'only', 'experience', 'almost', 'feel', 'are', 'there.This', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'superbly', 'acted', 'entire', 'cast', 'leads', 'supporters', 'Most', 'praise', 'gone', 'McConauahey', 'rightfully', 'so', 'been', 'role', 'lately', 'performances', 'great', 'here', 'Mud', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'was', 'actually', 'who', 'Nichols', 'wrote', 'part', '90', 'something', 'Nay', 'way', 'have', 'say', 'two', 'kids', 'here', '[', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', ']', 'did', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'famous', 'co', 'star', 'story', 'really', 'more', 'Tye', 'Ellis', 'particular', 'Ellis', 'story', 'moves', 'thus', 'role', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'was', 'Also', 'three', 'character', 'guardians', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'personalities', 'lead', 'trio.This', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'full', 'great', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'Arkansas', 'based', 'film', 'feeling', 'being', 'real', 'characters', 'here', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'actually', 'care', 'people', 'Now', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'least', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'drama', 'made', 'list', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year']",N/A

Mud revolves around a coming of age theme of one young boy, Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan). It involves two Ellis and another boy, Neckbone, befriending a man, Mud (played by Matthew McConaughey), who they discover living on an island. Mud has an appropriate name; he seems to be gritty in every sense, and seems to be a drifter hiding out from something. Mud tells them his in need of food, and makes a pact with the two boys to give them the boat if they will bring food back to the island. Ellis is willing to do this, but along the way the boys find out information about Mud that Mud hadn&#8217;t told them. Mud&#8217;s life is in danger, and he has a few secrets in his past. The action revolves around the boy&#8217;s efforts to reunite Mud with a long time love and also protect him from those out to do him harm.There are many thinking points in Mud, one of which is Ellis trying to understand the idea of what constitutes love. Ellis experiences a crush, and he connects his hopes of romance with that of Mud&#8217;s first love Juniper. Another point explored is simply the importance of trust and friendship.

1649166,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00CMT52T6,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","`He's not dangerous.'Writer/director Jeff Nichols presents a film with many levels of meaning and entertainment. It is at once a thriller of sorts, a mystery, a love song that manages to touch every character in the drama, a character study of a lovesick criminal on the run and a coming age story for a 14 year old boy discovering all the permutations of love and belonging and family and needs. It is a remarkable stage for the talents of Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan and will likely place them in the Oscars race.The best synopsis of the film has been summarized by Roadside Attractions and is referenced here: `14 year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives on a makeshift houseboat on the banks of a river in Arkansas with his parents, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon). He sneaks out early one morning to meet his best friend, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Neckbone, also 14, lives with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon), who makes a hardscrabble living diving for oysters. The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that's when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to Mud, and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that Mud has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but Mud is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help Mud escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect Mud and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing Mud, on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis's own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.'As important and impressive as the story is the overwhelming aspects of the film are the moments when the concept and meaning of love is shared  - many times, by many people, in many ways.  It is insightful and deeply moving. This is a film that proves that a fine entertainment visually can also be a great cerebral fix!

Yes, the film did focus on the boy more, but it equally focused on Mud and his hard life. The acting was superb. The cinematography was at times beautiful, as well as dark and gritty. The soundtrack was very, very subtle, allowing the viewer to hear the surroundings, making it even more realistic. For parents and those concerned about the rating: There are no nude scenes. No sex scenes. Yet there is a boat-load of foul language. No 'F' bomb that I heard, yet within the first 10 minutes of the film I counted 9 'S' words alone; after counting to 15 I stopped keeping track, and a slew of other foul words just kept on from there. It was just too much foul language, and really not needed. Also quite a bit of gun violence, with people being shot at close range. Boys fighting each other, a grown man punching a boy in the face. Sex references, including porn magazines, and references to girls breasts.Spoiler Alert....For me this movie can be summed up in one word, tragic. No happy endings here. Ellis the boy ends up with the life he didn't want. His father ends up with the life he didn't want. When you start to care about Mud, you then learn that his trials were all for nothing and in the end he doesn't learn a thing. You are lead to care about Mud's girlfriend Juniper, only to dislike her later.

How did he manage to climb out of acting mediocrity? Well we have to go back in time to the beginning of his career before we can go forward to the present and future. McConaughey struggled early in his career in the early and mid-1990's trying to find his footing as he took minor roles in films and one starring role in the dreadful Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. McConaughey finally got his big break in Joel Schumacher's adaptation of John Grisham's A Time to Kill starring as Jake Brigance taking the spot like from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock and Donald Sutherland. He embodied the Grisham's character so well that you can't imagine anyone else playing the character. From A Time to Kill he moved on to the small film Lone Star followed by Contact and Amistad showing off his acting capabilities and that is how he found redemption by making better film choices as he has chosen to work with great and good directors like Christopher Nolan in Interstellar and Martin Scorsese in The Wolf of Wall Street. It seems like McConaughey decided end his reputation as a pretty boy who can't act and return to his roots showing everyone how capable of an actor he which bring us to Mud.Mud is an intentionally sluggishly paced coming of age drama that follows the life and struggles of Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and the friends and family around him. Ellis and his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) live a river life on in southern Arkansas. The two find a boat resting high up in the trees on a small island on the river as if it is a sign from heaven the boys decided to make it their own only to find that someone has been living there. That is when they encounter a man simply known as Mud. Mud tells the boys he is waiting for someone and that if they boys help him get supplies he will then give them the boat. Through their journey with Mud we explore their hard lives as they deal with divorce, young love, facing the reality of the world and growing up. Jeff Nichols's screenplay is well written and thought out and inspired from Mark Twain. Yes his screenplay is slowly paced and for one moment in the film I wanted something to explode, but that was only a brief moment and otherwise I really enjoyed the story. The only flaw I had in the film was the climax at Ellis's boat home. It just seemed out of place, forced and didn't really work for me, but once the climax was over the epilogue was great.Reese Witherspoon like McConaughey seems to have spent most of her career in the romantic comedy world, but unlike McConaughey Witherspoon is good at it. She is charming, beautiful and has a good sense of humor, but it is nice to see her take a dramatic risk in Mud as Juniper the woman Mud loves since he was a child and has killed for. Reese shines in her supporting role displaying her charm, but in a more of a heartbreaking way. The Incomparable Sam Shepard does an outstanding job as the Tom Blankenship the only man Mud respects and the closest thing he has to a father. Michael Shannon the ever ready quality actor does a good job as Galen, Neckbone's uncle and the man who's raised him as he tries beautifully shows the nervousness yet desire to be more than a uncle to Neckbone, but a father. The rest of the cast from Sarah Paulson, Bonnie Sturdivant and to Ray McKinnon all do a good job in their roles and add something to the film.Mud is a naturally beautiful film. Filmed in Dumas and Stuttgart, Arkansas Adam Stone the cinematographer does a wonderful job showing off the natural beauty of the south and Arkansas which was matched by captivating minimalistic score done by composer David Wingo that fit the sluggish pace and cinematography of the film perfectly.While Mud isn't perfect story wise or pacing wise it still has a really good heartwarming coming of age story that is greatly complimented by the actors such as Matthew McConaughey in his best acting job of his career, Reese Witherspoon, and Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland who I think have a potential of a very bright career in Hollywood. That along with the cinematography and score make Mud a great film and one of the two best films I've seen this year along with Beyond the Pines. Though I don't think the pacing of the film will make it for everyone I still I highly recommend Mud before the deluge of the summer films starting next week.",5,Witness Matthew McConaughey's best acting performance of his career.,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,4625,"['Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'suffered', 'last', 'decade', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hell', 'films', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Fool', 'Gold', 'Sahara', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'only', 'remotely', 'decent', 'films', 'time', 'being', 'Frailty', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'How', 'did', 'manage', 'climb', 'acting', 'mediocrity', 'Well', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'beginning', 'career', 'can', 'go', 'forward', 'present', 'future', 'McConaughey', 'struggled', 'early', 'career', 'early', 'mid-1990', 'trying', 'find', 'footing', 'took', 'minor', 'roles', 'films', 'one', 'starring', 'role', 'dreadful', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Next', 'Generation', 'McConaughey', 'finally', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Grisham', 'A', 'Time', 'Kill', 'starring', 'Jake', 'Brigance', 'taking', 'spot', 'likes', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'embodied', 'Grisham', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'character', 'Time', 'Kill', 'moved', 'small', 'film', 'Lone', 'Star', 'followed', 'Contact', 'Amistad', 'showing', 'off', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'how', 'found', 'redemption', 'making', 'better', 'film', 'choices', 'chosen', 'work', 'great', 'good', 'directors', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Interstellar', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'McConaughey', 'decided', 'end', 'reputation', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'return', 'roots', 'showing', 'everyone', 'how', 'capable', 'actor', 'bring', 'Mud.Mud', 'intentionally', 'sluggishly', 'paced', 'coming', 'age', 'drama', 'life', 'struggles', 'Ellis', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'friends', 'family', 'Ellis', 'best', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'live', 'river', 'life', 'southern', 'Arkansas', 'two', 'find', 'boat', 'resting', 'high', 'up', 'trees', 'small', 'island', 'river', 'sign', 'heaven', 'boys', 'decided', 'make', 'own', 'only', 'find', 'someone', 'been', 'living', 'there', 'when', 'encounter', 'man', 'simply', 'known', 'Mud', 'Mud', 'boys', 'waiting', 'someone', 'boys', 'help', 'get', 'supplies', 'will', 'then', 'give', 'boat', 'journey', 'Mud', 'explore', 'hard', 'lives', 'deal', 'divorce', 'young', 'love', 'facing', 'reality', 'world', 'growing', 'up', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'screenplay', 'well', 'written', 'thought', 'out', 'inspired', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Yes', 'screenplay', 'slowly', 'paced', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'wanted', 'something', 'explode', 'was', 'only', 'brief', 'moment', 'otherwise', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'only', 'flaw', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'climax', 'Ellis', 'boat', 'home', 'just', 'seemed', 'place', 'forced', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'once', 'climax', 'was', 'epilogue', 'was', 'great.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'McConaughey', 'have', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'world', 'McConaughey', 'Witherspoon', 'good', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'nice', 'see', 'take', 'dramatic', 'risk', 'Mud', 'Juniper', 'woman', 'Mud', 'was', 'child', 'killed', 'Reese', 'shines', 'supporting', 'role', 'displaying', 'charm', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'way', 'Incomparable', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Tom', 'Blankenship', 'only', 'man', 'Mud', 'closest', 'thing', 'father', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'ever', 'ready', 'quality', 'actor', 'good', 'job', 'Galen', 'Neckbone', 'uncle', 'man', 'who', 'raised', 'beautifully', 'nervousness', 'yet', 'desire', 'be', 'more', 'uncle', 'Neckbone', 'father', 'rest', 'cast', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'Bonnie', 'Sturdivant', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'all', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'add', 'something', 'film.Mud', 'naturally', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Filmed', 'Dumas', 'Stuttgart', 'Arkansas', 'Adam', 'Stone', 'cinematographer', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'off', 'natural', 'beauty', 'south', 'Arkansas', 'was', 'matched', 'captivating', 'minimalistic', 'score', 'done', 'composer', 'David', 'Wingo', 'fit', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'film', 'perfectly.While', 'Mud', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'story', 'wise', 'pacing', 'wise', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'heartwarming', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'greatly', 'complimented', 'actors', 'such', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'career', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'potential', 'very', 'bright', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'cinematography', 'score', 'make', 'Mud', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'pacing', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'everyone', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Mud', 'deluge', 'summer', 'films', 'starting', 'next', 'week']",N/A

The acting in Mud is well drawn up and beautifully shot.The storyline is a honorable mention. It is very southern, but it is heavily centered around the two young boys and Mud. Expect an enjoyable combination of drama, occasional humor, and just the right amount of action for this movie.It is still considerably early in the year, but this IS one of 2013's movies to watch and is one that will be talked about(in a good way) for quite awhile.To close, Mud fires on all four cylinders and executes all three acts to perfection.5 stars",5,Matthew McConaughey gives a flawless performance,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1169,"['had', 'idea', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Not', 'only', 'i', 'am', 'seriously', 'going', 'go', 'broke', 'amount', 'movies', 'buy', 'including', 'one', 'genres', 'movies', 'i', 'am', 'just', 'movie', 'person', 'choosing', 'movies', 'watch', 'prefer', 'ones', 'serve', 'purpose', 'film', 'one', 'kind', 'Mud', 'just', 'more.Mud', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'title', 'character', 'unique', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Galen', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Ellis', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'Ellis', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'Ellis', 'mom', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Juniper', 'acting', 'Mud', 'well', 'drawn', 'up', 'beautifully', 'shot.The', 'storyline', 'honorable', 'mention', 'very', 'southern', 'heavily', 'centered', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Mud', 'Expect', 'enjoyable', 'combination', 'drama', 'occasional', 'humor', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'movie.It', 'still', 'considerably', 'early', 'year', 'one', '2013', 'movies', 'watch', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'good', 'way', 'quite', 'awhile.To', 'close', 'Mud', 'four', 'cylinders', 'three', 'acts', 'perfection.5', 'stars']",N/A

1649286,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00CMT52T6,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.When looking at a film like Mud it's hard to picture Matthew McConaughey being fit to play the titular character. Sure, he's had a handful of serious roles in the past, but majority of his work consists of Rom-Coms and things of that nature. However, it's this odd casting choice that makes Mud such a surprise hit. Not only is McConaughey able to pull of this role, but he does it with such ease that you would think he gets offered roles like this all the time. With that said, though, Mud is such a unique film that even McConaughey's stellar performance feels like a minor element in a much bigger picture.There's no denying that Mud's title and marketing are a bit misleading. While the story does center around the titular Mud, he isn't necessarily the main character of the film. No, that titled is reserved for a young boy named Ellis (Tye Sheridan). Living in De Witt, Arkansas with his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), the two boys come across a presumably deserted island while riding their boat one morning. However, it doesn't take long before they come across a man named Mud. After sharing his story with the boys, they learn that he is trying to reunite with his childhood sweetheart Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but is on the run from some bounty hunters and needs their help.One of Mud's strongest attributes is its cast and their performances, but the story's purity and unpredictability are what really connected with me. Because of this, there's no way to gain a real understanding of the story based on the brief synopsis provided above or on the back of the box. At its core, Mud is about a young boy's crippled understanding of love. Ellis believes that if two people love each other then they should be together, but everywhere he turns another relationship is crumbling. Whether its his parents marriage, the complicated relationship between Mud and Juniper, or his horrible experience with his first ""girlfriend"", Ellis' faith in true love slowly deteriorates as the film progresses and its almost heartbreaking to watch.As a result, Mud's character progression makes itself known throughout the entirety of the film. Not only from Ellis, but from Mud as well. By the time you reach the story's conclusion you see drastic change in both of these characters and its arguably the result of them meeting each other. Ellis is no longer the naive boy blindly living in an imperfect world and Mud is finally able to move on and do the right thing for both himself and those around him. The viewer also sees a slight change in both Neckbone and Senior (Ray McKinnon), Ellis' father, but their growth isn't as apparent as the two leads.Mud's casting is something that's been praised quite a bit by those who have seen the film, and for good reason. Not only were the actors perfect for their roles, but everyone involved did a phenomenal job of bringing these characters to life. Sheridan and McConaughey are bound to leave the biggest impression due to them receiving the most screen time, but it would be wrong to ignore the fact that Witherspoon, Lofland, McKinnon and Sam Shepard all delivered outstanding performances as well. While I would have liked to see more emphasis put on some of the characters like Juniper and Tom, it's no small feat that even the minor performances stood out as much as they did.Finally, the film's sense of atmosphere is outstanding. Part of this is brought out by the cast's performances, but it's also accomplished through the film's score, composed by David Wingo. Both of these elements combined really help bring to life the gritty southern setting. David's compositions are dark, ominous, and, at times, even a little thrilling. They're a perfect fit for the story being told and without them there's no arguing that the film wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.Overall Score: 8/10 - Among other things, Mud is powerful and confident. The story is engaging, the setting is raw, and it's all tied together with some fantastic performances and an equally enjoyable score. However, all of these things are just small parts of a greater whole and that's what helps make Mud feel like a cohesive experience. If you had your eye on this before I definitely recommend you give it your time. It easily exceeded my expectations.",4,8/10 - Good,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,4323,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.When', 'looking', 'film', 'Mud', 'hard', 'picture', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'being', 'fit', 'play', 'titular', 'character', 'Sure', 'had', 'handful', 'serious', 'roles', 'past', 'majority', 'work', 'Rom-Coms', 'things', 'nature', 'However', 'odd', 'casting', 'choice', 'Mud', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Not', 'only', 'McConaughey', 'able', 'pull', 'role', 'such', 'ease', 'would', 'think', 'offered', 'roles', 'time', 'said', 'Mud', 'such', 'unique', 'film', 'even', 'McConaughey', 'stellar', 'performance', 'feels', 'minor', 'element', 'much', 'bigger', 'denying', 'Mud', 'title', 'marketing', 'are', 'bit', 'misleading', 'story', 'center', 'titular', 'Mud', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'No', 'titled', 'reserved', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Ellis', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'Living', 'De', 'Witt', 'Arkansas', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'two', 'boys', 'come', 'presumably', 'deserted', 'island', 'riding', 'boat', 'one', 'morning', 'However', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'come', 'man', 'named', 'Mud', 'sharing', 'story', 'boys', 'learn', 'trying', 'reunite', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Juniper', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'run', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'help.One', 'Mud', 'strongest', 'cast', 'performances', 'story', 'purity', 'unpredictability', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'connected', 'way', 'gain', 'real', 'understanding', 'story', 'based', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'provided', 'back', 'box', 'core', 'Mud', 'young', 'boy', 'crippled', 'understanding', 'love', 'Ellis', 'two', 'people', 'love', 'other', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'together', 'everywhere', 'relationship', 'crumbling', 'parents', 'marriage', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Mud', 'Juniper', 'horrible', 'experience', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'Ellis', 'faith', 'true', 'love', 'slowly', 'film', 'almost', 'heartbreaking', 'watch.As', 'result', 'Mud', 'character', 'progression', 'known', 'entirety', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'Ellis', 'Mud', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'reach', 'story', 'conclusion', 'see', 'drastic', 'change', 'characters', 'arguably', 'result', 'meeting', 'other', 'Ellis', 'no', 'longer', 'naive', 'boy', 'blindly', 'living', 'imperfect', 'world', 'Mud', 'finally', 'able', 'move', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'viewer', 'also', 'slight', 'change', 'Neckbone', 'Senior', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'Ellis', 'father', 'growth', ""n't"", 'as', 'apparent', 'two', 'leads.Mud', 'casting', 'something', 'been', 'praised', 'quite', 'bit', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'actors', 'perfect', 'roles', 'everyone', 'involved', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'Sheridan', 'McConaughey', 'are', 'bound', 'leave', 'biggest', 'impression', 'due', 'receiving', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'ignore', 'fact', 'Witherspoon', 'Lofland', 'McKinnon', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'delivered', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'emphasis', 'put', 'characters', 'Juniper', 'Tom', 'small', 'feat', 'even', 'minor', 'performances', 'stood', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'did.Finally', 'film', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'outstanding', 'Part', 'brought', 'out', 'cast', 'performances', 'also', 'accomplished', 'film', 'score', 'composed', 'David', 'Wingo', 'elements', 'combined', 'really', 'help', 'bring', 'life', 'gritty', 'southern', 'setting', 'David', 'compositions', 'are', 'dark', 'ominous', 'times', 'even', 'little', 'thrilling', ""'re"", 'perfect', 'fit', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'arguing', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'enjoyable.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'other', 'things', 'Mud', 'powerful', 'confident', 'story', 'engaging', 'setting', 'raw', 'tied', 'together', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'score', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'small', 'parts', 'greater', 'whole', 'what', 'make', 'Mud', 'feel', 'cohesive', 'experience', 'had', 'eye', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'give', 'time', 'easily', 'exceeded', 'expectations']",N/A

This movie may not make many top ten lists and, due to its lesser-known status, probably won't be earning any acting awards for the main stars, but it has some very powerful writing, cinematography and acting, especially by the two young teen boys who carry almost the entire movie themselves.Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are two names to keep an eye out for in the future. These two kids are old souls, as seen by their understanding of life as written in this movie. They are able to convey with the simplest movement, glance, or utterance of syllable an entire paragraph of dialog and thirty minutes of back story. Their acting is nothing short of oscar quality throughout.The storyline stays on track, albeit slowly, but there is not one second of corny, gratuitous, wasteful or useless dialog in the movie. The message, from start to finish, though seemingly hopeless at times, is one of friendship, adventure, honesty and intrigue, but more than anything else, the making of a good man. The insight into the vastness, the wonder, the beauty, the hollowness and also the depth and greatness of love are all explored through the eyes of the talented Sheridan as we watch him gain another fifty years of understanding of the human condition in a few days.No sugar coated, feel-good smarm in this tale, but exceptional acting by two fine young actors and a whole cast of well known Hollywood names that will keep those who appreciate the craft of storytelling and high quality acting interested from beginning to end.If you're looking for a fast paced shoot'emup, look elsewhere.

This is how the story goes: Two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone, who find a man named Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Mud describes fantastic scenarios -- he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life, Juniper, who is waiting for him in town. Skeptical but intrigued, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him. It isn't long until Mud's visions come true and their small town is besieged by a beautiful girl with a line of bounty hunters in tow.The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Mud), Tye Sheridan (as Ellis), Sam Shepard (as Tom) & Reese Witherspoon (as Juniper) is brilliant. The directing & story & screenplay by Jeff Nichols is brilliant.The music by David Wingo is brilliant. The cinematography by Adam Stone is brilliant. The film editing by Julie Monroe is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Richard A. Wright is brilliant. The art direction by Elliott Glick is brilliant. The set decoration by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb, set dressings by Mitchell Crisp, Henson Flye, Matthew Martin, Joey Santoro, James Smith & Karen Young is brilliant. The costume design by Kari Perkins is brilliant. The special make-up effects design by Matthew W. Mungle & Clinton Wayne is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Everett Byrom III is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Jason Schugardt & coordinated by Zafar Janjua & Anastasia Von Rahl is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mickey Giacomazzi is brilliant.This is a brilliant, well-made and well-done drama that is entertaining and intriguing.

Jeff Nichols has directed his best film to date, thus far. This is one of the best movies of the summer season and one of the best movies of the year, if not, the best movie of the year, thus far.

Also, Matthew's character in the story, I would say, is secondary to the two young male characters who take much of the screen-time.The main protagonist of the story is Ellis played by Tye Sheridan, a 14 year old boy with a big heart and courage of a grown man.To say more would only spoil the movie.

The milieu and young cast  conjure memories of Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" and the 1986 film ""Stand By Me"". Fourteen-year-old friends Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) set out for a small island in the Mississippi with plans to claim a motorboat that was stuck in a tree on the island during a flood. But they find someone else has beaten them to it. A mysterious drifter calling himself ""Mud"" (Matthew McConaughey) is living on the island and asks the boys to bring him food. When they do, he has some more challenging requests and regales them with tales of a long-lost love named ""Juniper"" with whom he intends to reunite soon.The strong sense of place in Jeff Nichols' films lends them a potency that the stories alone might not have. Nichols returns to his native Arkansas for ""Mud"". This is his strongest effort since ""Shotgun Stories"" (2007), and this one's a little more optimistic. ""Mud"" is part coming-of-age tale, part suspense. From the moment the boys meet Mud, it doesn't look like this character could come to a good end, but Nichols keeps us guessing. Ellis is quick to take the romantic view of Mud. Neckbone is more circumspect. The audience will tend to think that Mud could not be what he says, but it is difficult to know what to make of him. Ellis, meanwhile, is getting conflicting views of love, from Mud's stories, his parent's crumbling marriage, and his own painful experiences with a slightly older girl. ""Mud"" is slow to reveal its secrets.The DVD (LionsGate 2013) has no bonus features, but subtitles are available in English and Spanish.

Most wouldn't have thought that as recently as maybe 5 years ago.  But he's impressive as Mud, a charming man on the run, hiding from the law on a small Arkansas island in the middle of the Mississippi River.Holed up in boat stuck in a tree during the last flood, Mud is trying to hook up with his girlfriend, Juniper (excellent Reese Witherspoon).  Two 14 year old boys, find the boat and claim it as their own, until they discover the residence of Mud.  In an unusually remarkable performance by Tye Sheridan as Ellis, he portrays an honest sense of age transition most of us will remember.  His best friend Neckbone (a nice first time performance by Jacob Lofland) is an orphan being raised by his uncle (Michael Shannon who starred in director Jeff Nichols only other film, ""Take Shelter"").  Ellis believes in people and he believes in love, having fallen for a high school senior.Neckbone is leery of people, including Mud but is guided by Ellis's instincts.  Together they work to get Mud and Juniper paired up and help with their escape from the law and the family of the man Mud killed back in Texas.  Ellis's own life is falling apart.  His father (Ray McKinnon) and mother (Sarah Paulson) are separating.  The mother is tired of living on the river in a houseboat.  Father and son like the arrangement.  Sam Shepard has a turn as the man who was a father-figure to Mud and who gives clues to his neighbor Ellis about the Mud-Juniper relationship.  Mud and Ellis form a special bond.  Both are incurable romantics which keeps them focused on their goal.This is a superbly acted, beautiful film; well written, with wonderful photography and a perfect musical score.The Blu ray transfer from Lionsgate is just as good as the film.  With a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film sparkles with some excellent lighting choices showing well on video.  Often using hand held cameras, we get some excellent close-ups, which offers excellent detail.  Good contrast prevails throughout.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is superb.  As noted, much of the film takes place on a remote, uninhabited island in the middle of a river.  The surrounds are in play here as the natural environment is well recorded, birds, bugs, wind envelope the viewer.  The musical score sounds great as well.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with director/writer Nichols and a separate segment where he details his desire to make the film.  Three other brief pieces focus on the casting, the locale and the sequence called the Snake Pit.",5,(BLU RAY UPDATE) One of the best films of 2013,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2709,"['will', 'probably', 'be', 'known', 'film', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'place', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'time', 'Most', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'as', 'recently', 'maybe', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'impressive', 'Mud', 'charming', 'man', 'run', 'hiding', 'law', 'small', 'Arkansas', 'island', 'middle', 'Mississippi', 'River.Holed', 'up', 'boat', 'stuck', 'tree', 'last', 'flood', 'Mud', 'trying', 'hook', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Juniper', 'excellent', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Two', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'find', 'boat', 'claim', 'own', 'discover', 'residence', 'Mud', 'unusually', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'Ellis', 'honest', 'sense', 'age', 'transition', 'most', 'will', 'remember', 'best', 'friend', 'Neckbone', 'nice', 'first', 'time', 'performance', 'Jacob', 'Lofland', 'orphan', 'being', 'raised', 'uncle', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'who', 'starred', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'Ellis', 'people', 'love', 'having', 'fallen', 'high', 'school', 'senior.Neckbone', 'leery', 'people', 'including', 'Mud', 'guided', 'Ellis', 'instincts', 'Together', 'work', 'get', 'Mud', 'Juniper', 'paired', 'up', 'help', 'escape', 'law', 'family', 'man', 'Mud', 'killed', 'back', 'Texas', 'Ellis', 'own', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'father', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'are', 'separating', 'mother', 'tired', 'living', 'river', 'houseboat', 'Father', 'son', 'arrangement', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'turn', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'father-figure', 'Mud', 'who', 'clues', 'neighbor', 'Ellis', 'Mud-Juniper', 'relationship', 'Mud', 'Ellis', 'form', 'special', 'bond', 'are', 'incurable', 'romantics', 'keeps', 'focused', 'goal.This', 'superbly', 'acted', 'beautiful', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'wonderful', 'photography', 'perfect', 'musical', 'score.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'Lionsgate', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'film', '1080p', 'resolution', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'sparkles', 'excellent', 'lighting', 'choices', 'showing', 'well', 'video', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'get', 'excellent', 'close-ups', 'excellent', 'detail', 'Good', 'contrast', 'prevails', 'Likewise', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'superb', 'noted', 'much', 'film', 'place', 'remote', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'middle', 'river', 'surrounds', 'are', 'play', 'here', 'natural', 'environment', 'well', 'recorded', 'birds', 'bugs', 'envelope', 'viewer', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'well', 'Subtitles', 'include', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'director/writer', 'Nichols', 'separate', 'segment', 'where', 'details', 'desire', 'make', 'film', 'Three', 'other', 'brief', 'pieces', 'focus', 'casting', 'locale', 'sequence', 'called', 'Snake', 'Pit']",N/A

Matthew McConaughey sporting the most terrifying prosthetic dentures in film history outside of the horror genre, stars as the title character Mud. As good as he is in his role and as good as the other adult actors are, the film ultimately belongs to the young teen actors Tye Sheriden (The Tree of Life) and Jacob Lofland (film debut). I actually would love to see these boys get noticed come Oscar season but that isn't likely to happen.Film BreakdownAfter a flood in a small Arkansas town, two teenage boys discover a boat lodged in a tree in a wooded area near the river. They quickly discover that someone resides in the boat's cabin area. The boys soon find out that it is Mud living in the boat and that he is hiding out for reasons I won't say in this review. In no time road blocks are set up to try and find Mud, one of the boys lets Mud know of this development and that is when Mud realizes he must flee by river. There is more to all this involving the Reese Witherspoon character whom is staying in a near by motel and supposed to be joining Mud in this escape plan. Amongst all this our two teens learn some valuable lessons about life and love.The film is just over 2 hours and also stars Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, Ray McKinnon and Michael Shannon which I thought would've been great as the bad guy here but Shannon is playing a lot of bad guys lately with ""The Iceman"", ""Man of Steel"" and ""Premium Rush"" that is was also nice to see him play a regular guy and even provide some of the films comic relief.Overall highly recommended to all audiences!

We even saw a psychopath, who was the brother of the murdered man by Mud played by the star of the movie Matthew McConaughey, who I first saw in the movie  ""A Time To Kill"" and what a movie that was of the true south.  Guess what the South has not changed spent 6 months down in Georgia and there still is a Clan or KKK, as well as Bigots all over, who are willing to say the most unspeakable things about black people, when they are standing right there in a store talking to me.Let's not forget the police in the South, oh how they truly hate us Northerners, those that were born and breed there.  You would think we started our Civil War here in the states where .  The controlling rich man, who is not afraid to use others to take the Law into his own hands.  King was played by ""Walking Tall"" star Joe Don Baker.What a performance by Sam Shepard who played Tom Blankenship the neighbor, who lives across the river on another houseboat, who helped raise Mud when he found him in the swaps of the Bayou country.Last but not least the Real Stars were Tye Sheridan who played Ellis and his best friend Jacob Lofland who played Neckbone, these two young men have a future in the movie business and I do hope they continue, as they will go far with their craft of acting.  You felt like you knew them, as I had friends, where I lived in Charlotte, New York like them growing up through thick and thin we were together at that age.  Playing baseball, telling stories, getting into trouble and getting caught by our parents or a neighbor.  Those were the good days when we were just starting to realize we were growing into adults like our parents, and that was scary for 12 and 15 year olds.  We wanted to love, but did not know much about it in those days, but we learned once in high school and there was a lot more to love than the sex, there was the emotions and feelings we all kept hidden and only told our best friends.  Two in our group of chums are gone one saved his troop in Viet Nam and the other got involved in drugs and passed, his choice with the alcohol to get him started.  Just like Ellis and Neckbone we all believed in Love, but really did not understand it, much like they did not.  It was a word you only said to the right person who came along in your life.  That is what Mud had with Juniper his childhood sweetheart played by Reese Witherspoon, who I almost did not recognize her, she has changed, but even as a child she could act and she did a wonderful amount of acting in this story of the childhood love that really never dies for Mud and Juniper.  They are connected throughout their lives.This is a wonderful movie with a great cast of actors and the writing of Jeff Nichols tells us a story we all have been through in our childhood, with friends and parents, who confused most of us children.Cast (in credits order)Matthew McConaughey ...

1649499,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CMT52T6,Paul Allaer,"[246, 281]","""Mud"" (2012 release; 130 min.) is the newest film from writer-director Jeff Nichols, who just last year brought us the excellent ""Take Shelter"" thriller (starring Jessica Chastain). As the movie opens, we get to know two young boys, 14 yr. old Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan) and his best friend Neckbone (played by Jacob Lofland), in a small boat on the Mississippi river, on their way to an island where they have found something incredible: a boat that somehow ended up high in a tree. The boys think the boat is abandoned and want to make it their playground, only to find out that someone is living in the boat: Mud (played by Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a refuge of the law for killing a man who got involved with Mud's on-again, off-again girlfriend Juniper (played by Reese Witherspoon). Mud gains the trust of the boys and convinces them to assist him in getting the boat lowered from the tree. We also get to know Ellis' family, as his mom and dad are going through tough times and are contemplating divorcing. This frightens Ellis as it may lead to having to move away from his beloved house on the river. At this point we are not even half-way through the movie. Is Mud really who he claims to be? Will the boat be lowered from the tree? Do Mud and Juniper find true love? Will Ellis find a way to save his house on the river? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie feels like a tour-de-force from Jeff Nichols. Even though ""Take Shelter"" was itself quite good, ""Mud"" feels like a quantum leap forward, both in the writing and the directing. The Mississippi river and surrounding Arkansas landscapes play a huge role in the movie, and at time it all feels quite surreal, or at least there is a sense of magic-realism. McConaughey plays another great role (although for me not quite as career-defining as his role in last year's ""Killer Joe""). But as much as I like McConaughey, the film is stolen by young Tye Sheridan, who acts and has a screen presence far greater than you might expect. In that sense, and as the movie ultimately is more about Ellis than it is about Mud, the movie could've just as easily have been called ""Ellis"". Jacob Lofland in the role of Ellis' friend is great as well. The two boys take up a huge amount of screen time, and hence this movie reminded me of that great movie ""Stand By Me"" from the mid-80s, starring a then young and unknown River Phoenix. Sheridan surely looks to have the talent and the chops to build a long and rewarding acting career.This movie premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, to generally great acclaim, and for the life of me I do not understand why it has taken almost a year to get the movie finally released in US theatres.

1649550,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00CMT52T6,RMurray847,"[129, 147]","MUD may be the best movie of 2013 through the end of April.  I was thoroughly entertained and captivated from the opening moments until the final shot.  The movie is so well crafted and acted.  It grapples with resonant themes.  This is a small movie that never feels small.  It's as gripping as any blockbuster thriller...yet is told on a small, personal level.It all starts with a great script by director Jeff Nichols (who also did the outstanding, but leisurely paced TAKE SHELTER).  Nichols is telling a coming-of-age story...and that's about as worn-out an idea as you can think of.  Yet even as portions of it feel as familiar as a Mark Twain novel...it's also never less than fresh and invigorating.  Nichols has packed his script full of serious themes, yet he never forgets to tell a good story.The story is set in Eastern Arkansas, right along the banks of the Mississippi.  In fact, our hero is Ellis, lives in a houseboat right on the water.  His parents (Sarah Paulson & Ray McKinnon) having a crumbling marriage, and Ellis is feeling uncertain about his place in the world and is worried about the seeming transience of love.  (And the livelihood his dad makes along the river is also endangered; and tied directly to the failing relationship of his parents.)One early morning, Ellis and his friend Neckbone (yep, that's the name) take a boat out to an island in the middle of the river.  They've heard that there's large boat STUCK UP A TREE.  The boat is there, and there's another surprise too.  Someone is living in it!  The boys meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey), the man on the boat.  He's hiding out on this island, waiting to meet up with his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and avoiding the men who are trying to track him down and kill him.  This is over-simplifying the situation, but I don't want to spoil it.  Suffice it to say that Ellis is drawn to this strange but charismatic man...and offers to help him because he sees in Mud & Juniper another chance to prove the power of true love.This only skims the surface of the nuances at play in this movie.  Nichols the writer also touches on Ellis' first love.  He gives Neckbone a peculiar family relationship of his own, because Neckbone is an orphan who lives with his eccentric & magnetic uncle (Michael Shannon).  Even Mud has a peculiar father figure (Sam Shepard) that he has a complicated relationship with.  Thus, MUD is about boys and their fathers as much as it is about boys learning hard lessons about love.A lot happens in this movie, but not for one second is it complicated or difficult to follow.  Nichols the writer has laid his script out magnificently, and Nichols the director delivers a clear, almost old-fashioned movie.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the land (and river) become a character.  The acting is outstanding.  Characters don't always say what they're thinking, but all the performers show us on their faces what is going on in their hearts.  So many movies these days show blank-faced actors hiding their feelings.  MUD is old-fashioned in that the characters are clearly presented.  The script helps them, but each actor is given room to emote and feel.  This makes for a character drama that grabs hold of the viewer from the opening moments.  I found it to be a beautifully immersive experience.McConaughey is fantastic.  I've never been his biggest fan, but his Mud is fascinating, frustrating and compelling.  It's easy to see why Ellis is drawn to him.  And young Tye Sheridan (TREE OF LIFE), who is really our guide through the story, is remarkable.  McConaughey will get all the attention, but Sheridan is in the crucial role.  If we don't care deeply about Ellis, the film doesn't work.  And we care VERY deeply about Ellis.  I could almost feel the audience tangibly drawn to him and rooting for him.And everyone else is terrific too.  Shannon & Shepard are swell (is Shannon ever anything less than interesting?).  Ray McKinnon (SONS OF ANARCHY) is truly compelling as a man who is truly losing his grip on everything he's held dear.  Jacob Lofland plays Neckbone, and is the perfect partner to Sheridan.  These two boys have a deep friendship and we totally believe that these two kids WOULD be close friends...even as they have their differences.Even as I've sat here writing this review, my appreciation for the film has grown as I've tried to put into words just how and why it works so well.  I simply admired the movie from beginning to end.It's not perfect.  The female characters are generally unlikeable (even if well performed...Witherspoon is very much cast against type).

1649629,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00CMT52T6,Stanley Crowe,"[24, 28]","WARNING: This is a critique of the movie and contains ""spoilers.""  The  movie is worth seeing, with much to enjoy.  But see first and read later (if you want to!).There's a lot to like about ""Mud.""  It's well-cast and well acted, it touches on engaging (and oft-treated issues), and it gives us a glimpse of a way of life in Arkansas that has a distinctive texture for all its difficulties and economic limitations.  The problem is, for me, that the movie gets in its own way, so to speak.  A rather clear thematic structure is undermined by aspects of the plot that turn the movie into a kind of shoot-em-up revenge thriller, and that seems gratuitous and not particularly expressive of the dominating themes of the movie.  These dominating themes have to do with love and with the idea that love is unstable.  The idea that love can bring a kind of stability into ones life is one that is cherished by the protagonist, a 14-year-old called Ellis (Yes, that means that Matthew McConaughy isn't the protagonist, despite the film's being named for his character.)  Ellis is watching his parents' marriage fall apart for reasons that have to do with their disagreement about continuing to live in a houseboat on the river so that his father can continue to make a precarious living doing what he has always done.  His mother has come to a point where she can't stand the precariousness, and she's ready to move out.  Both insist that they ""love"" Ellis, and he loves them, and the inefficacy of his love for them and their once-secure love for each other to keep the family together is deeply troubling to Ellis ( touchingly played by Tye Sheridan).  He doesn't want to give up his vision of love as able to effect more than it can, so when he and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) find a man who calls himself Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi (where they had discovered a boat stuck in a tree following a hurricane) and when Mud tells them that he is planning to snatch his beloved Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) from under the noses of the family of a man who want to kill him (Mud) for killing a member of the family who had treated Juniper badly, the idealistic Ellis is gung-ho to help love find a way.  When Mud reveals that he has been in love with Juniper since he was Ellis's age, then he seems like the perfect example of the perfect lover.  So a plan is hatched to get the boat out of tree, have it reconditioned with whatever the boys can find or steal (including an engine!), and use it to have Mud and Juniper make their escape.  As the plans go forward, the patriarch of the family seeking revenge on Mud (Joe Don Baker, looking old) arrives in the town (called DeWitt in the movie) knowing that Juniper is there and figuring that Mud must be nearby.  Joe Don brings along a bunch of hired guns to make sure that Mud will not escape them.Well, it all goes pear-shaped.  To Ellis's deep disappointment, Juniper (although she claims that she once loved Mud) isn't really all that keen to be rescued by him, and Ellis learns that her relationship with Mud has for years been marked by serial unfaithfulness on her part.  In her defense, she tells Ellis that Mud is unreliable and a liar.  Ellis is devastated -- this isn't the fairytale romance that he hoped to enable, and he is the more vulnerable because his first awkward attempts to get a girlfriend end in humiliation.  He goes back to the island, excoriates Mud, tells him what Juniper has been saying, and rushes off, wanting nothing more to do with him.So how to wrap this all up? This is where another kind of plot (the thriller) takes over and blurs the thematic clarity.  Ellis, in running away from Mud, is bitten by a poisonous snake.  Mud, throwing caution to the winds, gets him off the island and to a hospital, but his coming into town in such a dramatic fashion tips off the family and killers who are hunting him.  He accepts that he and Juniper have no future and tries to make his escape, but first visits Ellis in his home to say goodbye and patch up their relationship -- he did save Ellis's life, after all.  He is followed to Ellis's house by his pursuers, heavily armed, and the scene is set for mayhem.  Enter the deus ex machina in the shape of Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), who has a house across the water from Ellis's family and who has known and looked out for Mud for years -- and who is . . . a sharpshooter with a high-powered rifle (apparently he was either in the Marines or the CIA, depending on whose story you believe).  It's all far too convenient; when the shooting starts, he sits on his porch and picks off the bad guys.  At the end, he and Mud are heading down the Mississippi on the refurbished boat, Juniper, as well as Mud's illusions, having been left behind.This Hollywood-ish ending is unfortunate.  It distracts from our appreciation of subtler representations of trust and love (between the two boys, for example) or between the fatherless Neckbone and his uncle who looks after him, and even between Mud and Blankenship, perhaps.  Unfortunate too, I think, is that the movie isn't all that visually interesting.  It looks fine, but there's no visual rhythm to it.  But see it for the ambiance and the acting.  The boys are very good, and Reese Witherspoon does a fine job in what is really a very small part, as the fadedly pretty, rather slutty and shallow Juniper.  Much has been made of McConaughy's Mud -- he does a fine job, and it's not his usual kind of role, but I don't see it as a huge stretch for a professional actor.",3,"Some good things, but messy at the

Now if this sounds slightly familiar, perhaps you're thinking of another slice of Americana where two boys try to help a social outcast find his family and escape captivity by traversing the Mississippi River: Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  The parallels between Mud and Finn are actually quite numerous, most notably that both examine the trials of a young boy's integrity.  Whether or not director and writer Jeff Nichols is intentionally invoking Finn, he has nevertheless created a fine companion to the 1885 novel.The success of Mud lies in the hands of McConaughey and relative newcomer Tye Sheridan, who plays Ellis.  As the unlikely relationship forms between them, Nichols is able to weave in significant observations about fatherhood, childhood, love, and respect.  Protection is a recurring motif that truly sits at the heart of the film.  In fact, known for taking his shirt off, it is ironic that in Mud, McConaughey's shirt remains on as a symbolic form of protection.  Consequently, it is actually quite significant when it is ceremoniously and inevitably removed.Mud is certainly no technical achievement and will no doubt be lost in the shuffle as the flashy summer blockbusters start releasing, but it is a strong resonating film full of the kind of tension, drama, humor, and realism Mark Twain would be proud of.

Critics and fans on the movie sites I go to have been raving about this film, so I had to check it out and chime in. I agree with those who say that newcomer, Tye Sheridan, gives an amazing performance, but as for the rest of the film, I think it leaves something to be desired. While out exploring, two boys meet a strange man named Mud, stranded on an island. This man is full of stories and needs the boys help to reconnect with his girlfriend and leave the island. For starters, the film is full of inconsistencies. Mud is starving and needs these boys to bring him food, but somehow, he always has a cigarette in his mouth. One or two things could be overlooked, but the inconsistencies fill up this film. While it's a good story, there isn't a lot of substance to it and the film moves at a snails pace, another thing that tends to turn viewers away. The best thing to do would have been to use flashbacks in Mud's stories to fill the time, instead there are a lot of symbolic scenes of people lost in thought, the business of the town, the kids hanging out, it was very methodical, but also very dull. Matthew McConaughey plays Mud and does a decent job, the problem doesn't lie with him. The film is based on this guy, and for a character with such an interesting past, he really is a sad, dull guy. The only real positive I took away from this film was Tye Sheridan, who plays one of the boys. He does a tremendous job as he starts to realize that love isn't everlasting. To see how this character matures from the beginning of the film to the end, is really remarkable, but it's not unique. Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen similar stories, where the film is much more interesting and the same thing ends up happening. Mud is ambitious and may be the start of a long career for two young actors, but ultimately it's long, slow, and forgettable.",3,The Ultimate Movie Reivew! - (...) - @tss5078,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,2002,"['Mud', 'strange', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'where', 'one', 'boy', 'love', ""n't"", 'forever', 'friendship', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'Critics', 'fans', 'movie', 'go', 'have', 'been', 'raving', 'film', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'chime', 'agree', 'who', 'say', 'newcomer', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'amazing', 'performance', 'rest', 'film', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'exploring', 'two', 'boys', 'meet', 'strange', 'man', 'named', 'Mud', 'stranded', 'island', 'man', 'full', 'stories', 'boys', 'help', 'reconnect', 'girlfriend', 'leave', 'island', 'starters', 'film', 'full', 'inconsistencies', 'Mud', 'starving', 'boys', 'bring', 'food', 'somehow', 'always', 'cigarette', 'mouth', 'One', 'two', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'overlooked', 'inconsistencies', 'fill', 'up', 'film', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'lot', 'substance', 'film', 'moves', 'snails', 'pace', 'thing', 'turn', 'viewers', 'away', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'Mud', 'stories', 'fill', 'time', 'instead', 'are', 'lot', 'symbolic', 'scenes', 'people', 'lost', 'thought', 'business', 'town', 'kids', 'hanging', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'methodical', 'also', 'very', 'dull', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Mud', 'decent', 'job', 'problem', ""n't"", 'lie', 'film', 'based', 'guy', 'character', 'such', 'interesting', 'past', 'really', 'sad', 'dull', 'guy', 'only', 'real', 'positive', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'one', 'boys', 'tremendous', 'job', 'realize', 'love', ""n't"", 'everlasting', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'really', 'remarkable', 'not', 'unique', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'think', 'dozen', 'similar', 'stories', 'where', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'same', 'thing', 'up', 'happening', 'Mud', 'ambitious', 'may', 'be', 'start', 'long', 'career', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'ultimately', 'long', 'slow', 'forgettable']",N/A

1649692,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00CMT52T6,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Today, 'independent' fictional dramas are not much different from those released by the big Hollywood studios. They both have trouble being believable. That's the case with director Jeff Nichols' 'Mud', starring Matthew McConaughey, who seems to have a penchant for playing southerners of late.It begins of course with the two De Witt, Arkansas boys, Ellis and his pal, Neckbone, discovering the boat up in the tree on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River. When they come upon McConaughey's character, 'Mud', a drifter (who we later find out is wanted for murder by State Troopers), it looks like this might be going in the direction of a tale about a serial killer who has a penchant for young boys (a la John Wayne Gacy). But soon, to our relief, we discover that Mud is much more benign.Actually Mud has been pining away for years for his childhood love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), who just happens now to show up in De Witt. The man Mud killed was abusing Juniper and in one incident (according to Mud), threw her down the stairs, resulting in the loss of a baby she was expecting. While Mud decided to play vigilante and take the law into his own hands, somehow that's okay because not only was the act despicable (and worthy of execution in Mud's eyes) but the victim's family were also bad people (so bad that the family patriarch is referred to by Mud, as the devil himself!). Mud in effect really is not a bad guy at all, despite committing a murder. Actually he's just a bad boy with a heart of gold. When the family of the man he killed comes after him later on, he becomes a hero of sorts, blasting them all to smithereens with an aid of one particular ally.That ally is Mud's former mentor (and father figure of sorts) Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), a former Marine sharpshooter, who happens to live right across from Ellis and his parents, on the river. Ellis believes Mud's crazy stories that Tom used to be a CIA agent but Tom debunks them. In fact, he correctly fills Ellis in on Mud's true history--that he's been obsessed with Juniper for years and refuses to accept the fact that she's no good and cheats on him whenever she gets the chance.Bad boy Mud finally gets to prove that he's not so bad after all when, with the help of expert shot Tom (of course), mows down the brother of the guy who abused Juniper, along with a bunch of mean looking bounty hunters, who attempt to gun him down inside Ellis' home, after Mud comes to say goodbye to the kid. The 'heart of gold' machinations continue when Ellis lashes out at Mud on the island, after he's disillusioned by both Juniper and Mud's expected reconciliation falls apart, and he himself is rejected by a slightly older high school student he develops a crush on. Ellis falls into a snake pit and is bitten by a poisonous snake. Guess who rushes the stricken Ellis to the hospital on the mainland and saves his life?There's also a sub-plot involving Ellis' parents who are divorcing, resulting in the appropriation by the State of the houseboat they're living in. At film's end, Ellis and his mother move into a regular apartment, in town. As for Mud, you guessed it. He survives bullets and near-miss snake bites and nursed back to health by kindly mentor Tom.Despite solid performances by the two child actors, 'Mud' pretty much feels as phony as a three dollar bill. Here's a portrait of a killer whose main problem is that he's a love sick puppy dog. Even Tom, the man who really knows about all of Mud's shortcomings, gives him a free pass after Mud helps him to do away with a gaggle of cartoon bad guys and then saves the film's youthful protagonist from certain death, after the kid ever so conveniently falls into a pit of poisonous snakes.Don't get me wrong. 'Mud' is thoroughly watchable but please don't believe that most of this could actually happen in real life. For those viewers who do believe in the verisimilitude of this type of narrative, I can only surmise that such aficionados, are also seriously addicted to contemporary Hollywood and Indie dramas, featuring antagonists with clear cut and ever-so unrealistic, 'hearts of gold'.",2,McConaughey's bad boy drifter with heart of gold has little semblance of truth,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,4203,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', '5.0Today', ""'independent"", 'fictional', 'dramas', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'released', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'have', 'trouble', 'being', 'believable', 'case', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Nichols', ""'Mud"", 'starring', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'have', 'penchant', 'playing', 'southerners', 'late.It', 'begins', 'course', 'two', 'De', 'Witt', 'Arkansas', 'Ellis', 'pal', 'Neckbone', 'discovering', 'boat', 'up', 'tree', 'island', 'middle', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'When', 'come', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'drifter', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'wanted', 'murder', 'State', 'Troopers', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'direction', 'tale', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'penchant', 'young', 'boys', 'la', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'soon', 'relief', 'discover', 'Mud', 'much', 'more', 'benign.Actually', 'Mud', 'been', 'pining', 'away', 'years', 'childhood', 'love', 'Juniper', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'just', 'now', 'show', 'up', 'De', 'Witt', 'man', 'Mud', 'killed', 'was', 'abusing', 'Juniper', 'one', 'incident', 'according', 'Mud', 'threw', 'down', 'stairs', 'resulting', 'loss', 'baby', 'was', 'expecting', 'Mud', 'decided', 'play', 'vigilante', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'somehow', 'okay', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'act', 'despicable', 'worthy', 'execution', 'Mud', 'eyes', 'victim', 'family', 'were', 'also', 'bad', 'people', 'so', 'bad', 'family', 'patriarch', 'referred', 'Mud', 'devil', 'Mud', 'effect', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'committing', 'murder', 'Actually', 'just', 'bad', 'boy', 'heart', 'gold', 'When', 'family', 'man', 'killed', 'later', 'hero', 'sorts', 'blasting', 'smithereens', 'aid', 'one', 'particular', 'ally', 'Mud', 'former', 'mentor', 'father', 'figure', 'sorts', 'Tom', 'Blankenship', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'former', 'Marine', 'sharpshooter', 'who', 'live', 'right', 'Ellis', 'parents', 'river', 'Ellis', 'Mud', 'crazy', 'stories', 'Tom', 'used', 'be', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Tom', 'fact', 'correctly', 'Ellis', 'Mud', 'true', 'history', 'been', 'obsessed', 'Juniper', 'years', 'accept', 'fact', 'good', 'cheats', 'whenever', 'chance.Bad', 'boy', 'Mud', 'finally', 'prove', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'help', 'expert', 'shot', 'Tom', 'course', 'down', 'brother', 'guy', 'who', 'abused', 'Juniper', 'bunch', 'mean', 'looking', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'who', 'attempt', 'gun', 'down', 'inside', 'Ellis', 'home', 'Mud', 'say', 'goodbye', 'kid', ""'heart"", 'gold', 'machinations', 'continue', 'when', 'Ellis', 'out', 'Mud', 'island', 'disillusioned', 'Juniper', 'Mud', 'expected', 'reconciliation', 'apart', 'rejected', 'slightly', 'older', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'crush', 'Ellis', 'snake', 'pit', 'bitten', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'Guess', 'who', 'stricken', 'Ellis', 'hospital', 'mainland', 'life', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Ellis', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'divorcing', 'resulting', 'appropriation', 'State', 'houseboat', ""'re"", 'living', 'film', 'end', 'Ellis', 'mother', 'move', 'regular', 'apartment', 'town', 'Mud', 'guessed', 'bullets', 'near-miss', 'snake', 'bites', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'kindly', 'mentor', 'Tom.Despite', 'solid', 'performances', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'pretty', 'much', 'feels', 'as', 'phony', 'three', 'dollar', 'bill', 'Here', 'portrait', 'killer', 'main', 'problem', 'love', 'sick', 'puppy', 'dog', 'Even', 'Tom', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'Mud', 'shortcomings', 'free', 'pass', 'Mud', 'do', 'away', 'gaggle', 'cartoon', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'film', 'youthful', 'protagonist', 'certain', 'death', 'kid', 'ever', 'so', 'conveniently', 'pit', 'poisonous', 'snakes.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thoroughly', 'watchable', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'most', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', 'believe', 'verisimilitude', 'type', 'narrative', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'such', 'aficionados', 'are', 'also', 'seriously', 'addicted', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', 'Indie', 'dramas', 'featuring', 'antagonists', 'clear', 'cut', 'ever-so', 'unrealistic', ""'hearts"", 'gold']",N/A
