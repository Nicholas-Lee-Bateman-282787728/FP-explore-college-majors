414857,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6304328966,JGC,"[5, 7]","Susan & God,Woman's FaceandWhen Ladies Meet (1941). What do all these movies have in common? Just like, ""They all Kissed the Bride"" they were all made in the early 40's (towards the end of Ms. Crawford's MGM career.) And, just like ""They All Kissed The Bride"" all of these movies are absolutely dreadful and extremely painful to watch. But unlike the others, ""They All Kissed The Bride"" is different.This movie was different for a few reasons. First of all, Joan was on loan to Columbia (it was only the 2nd or 3rd time MGM lent her out for a ""talkie."") And, I have to be honest. This was a really, really bad movie. And not only was it a bad movie, but  it was a bad movie that Joan was bad in.I also had difficulty following the movie and understanding it. Maybe, because the plot was incredibly dry. Except for a few funny lines with Joan and Billie Burke, the majority of the movie was very slow-moving and terribly over-dramatic.In 1942, Joan was going through a really rough time, personally and professionally. Her studio was feeding her sub-standard scripts with one hand while trying to push her out the door with the other. This movie was the last thing on Joan's agenda. But she did it out of loyalty to her good friend, Carole Lombard, who died in a plane crash. Ms. Crawford donated her entire salary to charity and then fired her manager when he didn't do the same (how many of today's Hollywood stars do this?) That's a rhetorical question, because we all know the answer is none.",3,Even Ms. Crawford can't save this halfbaked turkey,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,1495,"['Susan', 'God', 'Woman', 'FaceandWhen', 'Ladies', 'Meet', '1941', 'What', 'do', 'movies', 'have', 'common', 'Just', 'Kissed', 'Bride', 'were', 'made', 'early', '40', 'end', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'MGM', 'career', 'just', 'Kissed', 'Bride', 'movies', 'are', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'extremely', 'painful', 'watch', 'others', 'Kissed', 'Bride', 'different.This', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'few', 'reasons', 'First', 'Joan', 'was', 'loan', 'Columbia', 'was', 'only', '2nd', '3rd', 'time', 'MGM', 'lent', 'out', 'talkie', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'Joan', 'was', 'bad', 'in.I', 'also', 'had', 'difficulty', 'following', 'movie', 'understanding', 'Maybe', 'plot', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dry', 'few', 'funny', 'lines', 'Joan', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'majority', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'terribly', 'over-dramatic.In', '1942', 'Joan', 'was', 'going', 'really', 'rough', 'time', 'personally', 'professionally', 'studio', 'was', 'feeding', 'sub-standard', 'scripts', 'one', 'hand', 'trying', 'push', 'out', 'door', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'Joan', 'agenda', 'did', 'loyalty', 'good', 'friend', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'who', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'donated', 'entire', 'salary', 'charity', 'then', 'fired', 'manager', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'how', 'many', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'do', 'rhetorical', 'question', 'know', 'answer', 'none']",They All Kissed the Bride VHS

She's absolutely sensational.White collar meets blue, referee is Douglas, the struggling, but insightful hipster writer, with no ""wheels"" of his own but vicariously as advocate for all the truck rivers in Joan's very successful trucking company. He's no Clark Gable  but can match him with his resonant voice and smooth moves.Story is that MGM loaned Joan to Columbia and for this Reviewer a very happy medium results: she brings the style and elegance of MGM to a company that is expert in making entertaining and energetic comedies.We have a minor classic on our hands until a little after ""intermission"" and then we suddenly drop from A to B movie as Joan the Corporate Riser gets bombed at a company party (not for the suits....see the movie!), rediscovers her ""womanhood"" and suddenly wants Melvin, the annoying guy who early in their association seemed to want nothing more than to collect on an accident claim related to her firm.Movie is still recommended.

Drew, known as M.J. by her intimidated employees, has taken over command of the vast Drew financial empire from her late father. When reporter Michael Holmes begins to publish exposes about Drew's tyrannical employment practices, the imperious M.J. demands that he be investigated. A pretty enjoyable film considering its rather contrived storyline, it nevertheless should please the mulititude of fans who still see in Crawford something I don't personally - generally speaking. The film was originally to have starred Carole Lombard, but she was tragically killed in a airplane crash after a highly successful War Bond drive. The script was re-written to suit Joan of Crawford. To her credit, Joanie donated her entire salary for this film to various charities in memory of the much-loved Lombard. As trivia footnotes, cinematographer used a special new ""lavender lighting"" technique which was used as an experiment in order to enhance the brilliance of Crawford's eyes (!) The film's ending credits acknowledge thusly: ""Miss Joan Crawford appears through the courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"".

414860,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6304328966,Silver Screen,"[2, 2]","""They All Kissed the Bride"" (1941) is a noteworthy film as first, being a comedy from Joan Crawford, and second, as the film Carole Lombard was scheduled to do at the time of her death.Crawford, never judged a comedienne at any time in her career, does a very commendable job in what could have been a bland role.  She plays the part of M.J. Drew, a hard as nails businesswoman, to perfection and doesn't skip a beat by overplaying the character once she gets weak kneed over Michael Holmes (Melvyn Douglas).  Seeing Crawford in the part, it's hard to imagine Lombard in the role, sparkling comedienne though she unquestionably was.  You could imagine Bette Davis, perhaps, as the strictly business M.J., but only Myrna Loy, in my judgment, could have done as much justice to the role as Crawford does, as both a driven businesswoman and a lovestruck lady.Although M.J.'s background isn't mentioned much, other than the fact that she inherited her trucking business from her deceased father, one could expect that M.J. was the son he never had and treated as such, whereas younger sister Vivian was the babied Daddy's Girl.  Which makes M.J. ripe for Michael Holmes and his forthright behavior.  Has anyone ever stood up to M.J. before?  Probably not.  And maybe that is part of M.J.'s fascination with Michael.Although Crawford deserves kudos for her comedy, Melvyn Douglas simply shines.  Not only was he an incredibly talented, and sadly underrated, actor, but he and Crawford meshed well together and had a great chemistry.  Not the electrifying, sexually charged chemistry she shared with Gable, but more a meeting of the minds, of personality.  It's not easy to take the spotlight from such a performer as Crawford but Douglas does it with ease.  He seems comfortable and at home playing reporter Michael Holmes and both he and Crawford seem to be having a good time with their roles.It's a shame that MGM didn't recognize that Crawford could, on occasion and with the right part and co-star, handle some lighthearted comedic roles  - - she shone in MGM's ""The Women"" and ""Susan and God"" (although this film was sorely underrated and perhaps undermarketed).  She may have been able to turn in some other sparkling performances but, alas, only the women's films and horror awaited her post-MGM.If you are a Crawford fan, this film is definitely worth viewing and adding to your library.  If you are unfamiliar with Melvyn Douglas, this is a great film to get to know his work and appreciate his acting and comedy chops.Definitely recommended.",4,Melvyn Douglas Shines in a Crawford Comedy,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2547,"['Kissed', 'Bride', '1941', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'comedy', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'second', 'film', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'was', 'scheduled', 'do', 'time', 'death.Crawford', 'never', 'judged', 'comedienne', 'time', 'career', 'very', 'commendable', 'job', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bland', 'role', 'part', 'M.J.', 'Drew', 'hard', 'nails', 'businesswoman', 'perfection', ""n't"", 'skip', 'beat', 'overplaying', 'character', 'once', 'weak', 'kneed', 'Michael', 'Holmes', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Seeing', 'Crawford', 'part', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Lombard', 'role', 'sparkling', 'comedienne', 'unquestionably', 'was', 'could', 'imagine', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'perhaps', 'strictly', 'business', 'M.J.', 'only', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'judgment', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'as', 'much', 'justice', 'role', 'Crawford', 'driven', 'businesswoman', 'lovestruck', 'lady.Although', 'M.J.', 'background', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'much', 'other', 'fact', 'inherited', 'trucking', 'business', 'deceased', 'father', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'M.J.', 'was', 'son', 'never', 'had', 'treated', 'such', 'whereas', 'younger', 'sister', 'Vivian', 'was', 'babied', 'Daddy', 'Girl', 'Which', 'M.J.', 'ripe', 'Michael', 'Holmes', 'forthright', 'behavior', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'stood', 'up', 'M.J.', 'Probably', 'not', 'maybe', 'part', 'M.J.', 'fascination', 'Michael.Although', 'Crawford', 'kudos', 'comedy', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'simply', 'shines', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'sadly', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Crawford', 'meshed', 'well', 'together', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Not', 'electrifying', 'sexually', 'charged', 'chemistry', 'shared', 'Gable', 'more', 'meeting', 'minds', 'personality', 'not', 'easy', 'take', 'spotlight', 'performer', 'Crawford', 'Douglas', 'ease', 'comfortable', 'home', 'playing', 'reporter', 'Michael', 'Holmes', 'Crawford', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'roles.It', 'shame', 'MGM', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Crawford', 'could', 'occasion', 'right', 'part', 'co-star', 'handle', 'lighthearted', 'comedic', 'roles', 'shone', 'MGM', 'Women', 'Susan', 'God', 'film', 'was', 'sorely', 'underrated', 'perhaps', 'undermarketed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'turn', 'other', 'sparkling', 'performances', 'alas', 'only', 'women', 'films', 'horror', 'awaited', 'post-MGM.If', 'are', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'adding', 'library', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'great', 'film', 'get', 'know', 'work', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'comedy', 'chops.Definitely', 'recommended']",They All Kissed the Bride VHS
414861,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6304328966,Simon Davis,"[6, 6]","""They All Kissed The Bride"", marks a slight variation in Joan Crawford's early 1940's movie career and being a Columbia release has a different feel to it than most of Joan's MGM features at this time, despite the presence of frequent costar Melvyn Douglas as the male lead. Originally set as a starring vehicle for Carole Lombard who was due to start this film upon her return from a War Bond selling tour, the film's production schedule was thrown into disarray by Lombard's tragic death in a plane crash on the return leg of her tour. At very short notice and as a homage to Miss Lombard, Joan Crawford not only stepped into the lead role but very generously donated her entire salary to wartime charities. When her agent still tried to collect his 10% fee for her services however Joan fired him on the spot!Despite starting off as a hard nosed, no nonsense businesswoman in the beginning this role reveals a delightfully comic and carefree Joan Crawford in the later stages that comes as a pleasant surprise after all her strongly dramatic work as one of the Queens of MGM soap operas for over a decade.Joan Crawford stars as Margaret Drew, better known to her terrified employees, as the imperious ""M J"" because of her shrewish, icy, and ruthless handling of the company that she has inherited from her late father a highly successful founder of a trucking empire . Margaret expects total dedication to the job whatever the cost and is quick to come down hard on anyone who  appears to fall below her high expectations and standards. Margaret's adage in life could be ""if you can't do it well then I'll find someone who can"". Margaret's tyrannical nature also flows over into her family life where she strikes terror into life of both her fluttery mother Mrs. Drew (Billie Burke), and her younger sister Vivian (Helen Parrish) who she is forcing into a loveless but socially prominent marriage against her will. Margaret's orderly life composed of her giving the orders and all others obeying is turned upside down by a ""tell it as it is"" journalist Michael Holmes (Melvyn Douglas), who writes a very unflattering series of newspaper articles painting Margaret as a controlling and bullying sour puss who is, in his words ""more a machine than a woman"". Horrified by her name being besmirched Margaret prepares to do battle with Michael. What infuriates Margaret so much is Michael's carefree lack of fear of her and his ability to put her down at every turn. Despite his dislike of her management practices and the way she treats people in general Michael finds himself attracted to Margaret and sets out to find the real woman under the steely facade. Aware of how cut off she is from the grass roots drivers that have made her father's company the success it is, Michael persuades a reluctant Margaret to accompany him to their annual dance where she is passed off simply as Michael's ""date"" as none of the employees know what Margaret looks like. What passes that evening is a lesson in humility for Margaret as she quickly finds herself eating a greasy hot dog, and doing a frantic jitterbug with Michael's pal Johnny Johnson (Allen Jenkins. The next morning Margaret's board of directors including the befuddled Marsh (Roland Young) are amazed to find Margaret arrive late for work, badly dressed and carrying her jitterbug trophy which she proceeds to do a dance around the office with. Margaret begins to show a softer more caring side to her character with all her staff and family which has never been revealed to anyone and her former hatred for Michael turns to love. The final scene hilariously reveals Margaret and Michael getting together in one of the company trucks which formerly were never to be used by Margaret's orders for ""personal use"", but which now is serving to take them away to their wedding.To witness Joan Crawford's character becoming all perplexed and weak kneed at a man's attention is not a sight most movie goers in the early 1940's experienced and this is why ""They All Kissed The Bride"", is such a joyous viewing experience as it reveals Joan's seldom seen flair for light comedy. Her chemistry with Melvyn Douglas is excellent as always and was something they enjoyed in all their other film work together such as ""The Shining Hour"",and especially in ""A Woman's Face"". Alexander Hall's sure direction of this non traditional role for Joan Crawford is sure and efficient and Margaret's transformation from machinelike tyrant to love struck individual is smooth and totally believable. Hall manages Crawford's light comic moments like her final scene in the back of the truck and the memorable jitterbug sequence for maximum effect and indeed it is hard now to really imagine Carole Lombard, for all her gifts as an actress being as effective in these scenes. Crawford and the other women are all flatteringly gowned by designer Irene and this film began a collaboration between the star and the designer that went on for many years.As a big fan of Joan Crawford I never doubted her great dramatic abilities but until I saw ""They All Kissed The Bride"" for the first time recently I couldn't imagine how she would handle the light hearted transformation that her character ungoes in the last half of this film. Needless to say I was impressed and it should be an essential item in all Crawford collections. It displays Crawford in a most pleasing characterisation and made demands on her as an actress that many of her MGM efforts at that time were failing to do. Crawford's great triumph in ""Mildred Pierce"", was still 3 years off here but it is a terrific little vehicle for this legendary actress. Be sure to catch Joan Crawford being ""defrosted"", by Cupid's arrow in Columbia Pictures ""They All Kissed The Bride"".",4,"Joan Crawford Goes on ""Loan Out"" With Pleasing Comic

414862,A3LP1MXLC99ZI4,6304328966,Thomas F. Lath.,"[16, 16]","Joan Crawford took this role after the original star, Carole Lombard, was killed in an airplane crash.  She donated her entire salary to the war effort when it was completed.  She quickly wins my attention in the movie,  because she plays the role so well.  She wants success, and having to deal  with a flighty mother and sister makes her job very difficult.  Her  nemesis, played so well by Melvyn Douglas, slowly wins her heart and falls  for her himself. It is fun to watch the younger Miss Crawford play the  hard-nosed type that she certainly was associated with later in her career.  She hits her marks well within the movie, and she seemed very comfortable  with her frequent costar Mr. Douglas.  Even though it has the typical  Hollywood ending (which I personally enjoy very much), it is well worth  your time to watch.
