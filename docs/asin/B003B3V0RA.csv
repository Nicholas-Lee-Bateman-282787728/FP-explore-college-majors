It's 4 great 20th Century Fox films, and while all of them aren't absolutely amazing, it's still worth it.Black Widow (1954)- 7/10- I didn't think this movie was anything very special in particular, but it still was a pretty thrilling and engaging film in Cinemascope. It's about a woman named Nancy Ordway (Peggy Ann Gardner) who starts climbing the social ladder when Peter Denver (Van Heflin) lets her stay at his house, while his wife Iris Denver (Gene Tierney) is out of town. Later, she is found hanging by a rope in his house, but people start to believe it was murder, and almost everybody is a suspect. It also stars Ginger Rogers, George Raft, and Reginald Gardner. While it seems to fit an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents better and it feels like a B movie, it still has it's good notes, like the color of the film, and also the suspense that builds up over the film. Another good part of the film was Gene Tierney. I feel that she's a very underrated actress and she should be as known as Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe. Altogether, ""Black Widow"" has it's pros and cons, but it's a good and well-crafter color noir suspense film.Special Features:Commentary by film noir historian Alan RodeGinger Rogers at Twentieth Century Fox featuretteGene Tierney: Final Curtain for a Noir Icon featuretteInteractive pressbookIsolated score trackStill galleriesOriginal theatrical trailerCall Northside 777 (1948)- 9.5/10- Even though this isn't really a suspense film and it fits more in the drama genre, ""Call Northside 777"" is a very moving and well done film starring my favorite actor, Jimmy Stewart. He plays P.J. McNeal, a newspaper writer who investigates a 1932 shooting during the Prohibition Era, where Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man get imprisoned for 99 years. He is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek is guilty, but later on tries to prove he didn't commit the murder. The black-and-white cinematography was really something special, along with a nicely paced storyline with fantastic acting. ""Call Northside 777"" is an underrated noir drama that deserves more respect.Special Features:Fox Movietone news (motion picture stars attend premiere)Theatrical trailerDangerous Crossing (1953)- 8.5/10- Nobody really remembered this film over the years, but I still think it's a great film, which stars one of my favorite 20th Century Fox actresses, Jeanne Crain. It's about a woman named Ruth Stanton Bowman (Jeanne Crain) and her newlywed husband, John Bowman (Carl Betz), on a honeymoon cruise to Europe. Suddenly, John disappears, and all of the workers on the boat tell her that he was never on the boat. Later on, Dr. Paul Manning (Michael Rennie) tries to help her,, which all leads to a shocking ending. I can see why nobody remembered it after it came out, but there are a lot of good things to this film, like the foggy and shadowy cinematography, along with the creepy atmosphere that the film gives off. ""Dangerous Crossing"" is worth a watch.Special Features:Commentary by film historian Aubrey SolomonPeril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing featuretteInteractive pressbookStill galleriesIsolated score trackOriginal theatrical trailerLaura (1944)- 10/10- Probably in the top 5 best film noirs of all time. There are a lot of good things to this film that stood the test of time. When popular society girl Laura Hunt (the wonderful Gene Tierney) dies from being shot to death, Mark McPherson investigates the murder, and gets information about Laura in a series of flashbacks from the man who made Laura popular, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), and Laura's fiancee, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), and multiple others. It's a very thrilling story with fantastic cinematography, exceptional acting, a wonderful screenplay, that fabulous picture of Gene Tierney that appears throughout the film, the twist mid-way through the film, and many other things. ""Laura"" deserves to be called one of the best film-noirs, ranking with ""The Maltese Falcon"", and ""Double Indemnity"".Special Features:Two A&E; Biographies:Gene Tierney: A Shattered PortraitVincent Price: The Versatile VillainExtended VersionDeleted SceneTheatrical Trailer20th Century Fox was the home of film-noirs, and this quad set definitely showcases all of the amazing noir that they produced.

1335356,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B003B3V0RA,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[1, 1]","LAURA:So much has been written about the wonderful classic film, Laura, that all is needed is to add that you won't find a better scene-stealing actor than Clifton Webb.  He creates roles that stir your feelings, whether it be dislike, relentless dark humor, or admiration for his ability to be a realistic snob.  He had a major role in this film and yet Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews draw all of the attention.  The photography is also so much better in black and white than if it had been in bright color.  I have seen this movie often, but I never get tired of watching it again...if just to see Webb weaving his way into a scene with just a ""look, sneer, and turn of the head."" His unique manner of making himself an unapologetic unlikeable bore is unmatchable.NORTHSIDE 777:I have seen this movie before, and it is one of the better news-reporter-doubting-the-conviction-of-a-cop-killer films.  James Stewart at his best as he tries to find evidence that will pardon a man who was identified by a bystander as the murderer. The correlation of corruption is added to the plot but perhaps not enough attention is paid to that aspect.  It is interesting to watch the old technology that was used in a story set in the early 1930s.  While there was a tiny handheld camera used, the lie detector test, the way photos are supersized, and the way ""faxing"" was utilized then show us how technology has advanced.  I found that the film itself has degraded some in that the shadows become much too dark and some of the better scenes are almost blackened.  It needs to be remastered.STRANGE CROSSING:I had never seen this movie before, and I think that it isn't rated too highly because it may have been the first to use the ""missing spouse on board a ship"" theme.  It has since been overused, and therefore this one not appreciated as an interesting topic.  I didn't find Jeanne Crain's acting unconvincing, but I found Rennie's bland and disinterested.  The middle-to-ending does have a twist that I didn't expect, so there is merit in watching another black and white film with photography that can't be beat, including using fog and shadows to heighten the suspense.BLACK WIDOW:Now this was a movie that had some good points and some bad ones.  I didn't think that Ginger Rogers acting was up to her musical standards as ""perfect."" Peggy Ann Garner was definitely miscast. Van Heflin seemed to be as bored as I was with his performance. Reginald Gardner was the most convincing as Ginger Roger's shamefully scared and married-for-money husband, The ending was meant to be predictable, but wasn't, so there was a positive note.  The best part of this movie was the beautiful clothing worn by Rogers.I have given this collection of film noir movies a review of ""good"" because I can't think of a better group of black and white (and one in color) movies that I enjoyed watching for the low cost and even the hours of enjoyment.",4,For Noir Black&White Filmography Fans (mainly),1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,2922,"['LAURA', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'wonderful', 'classic', 'film', 'Laura', 'needed', 'add', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'scene-stealing', 'actor', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'roles', 'stir', 'feelings', 'be', 'dislike', 'relentless', 'dark', 'humor', 'admiration', 'ability', 'be', 'realistic', 'snob', 'had', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'yet', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'attention', 'photography', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'black', 'white', 'had', 'been', 'bright', 'color', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'often', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'again', 'just', 'see', 'Webb', 'weaving', 'way', 'scene', 'just', 'look', 'sneer', 'turn', 'head', 'unique', 'manner', 'making', 'unapologetic', 'unlikeable', 'bore', 'unmatchable.NORTHSIDE', '777', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'news-reporter-doubting-the-conviction-of-a-cop-killer', 'films', 'James', 'Stewart', 'best', 'find', 'evidence', 'will', 'pardon', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'identified', 'bystander', 'murderer', 'correlation', 'corruption', 'added', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'attention', 'paid', 'aspect', 'interesting', 'watch', 'old', 'technology', 'was', 'used', 'story', 'set', 'early', '1930s', 'was', 'tiny', 'handheld', 'camera', 'used', 'lie', 'detector', 'test', 'way', 'photos', 'are', 'supersized', 'way', 'faxing', 'was', 'utilized', 'then', 'show', 'how', 'technology', 'advanced', 'found', 'film', 'degraded', 'shadows', 'become', 'much', 'too', 'dark', 'better', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'blackened', 'be', 'remastered.STRANGE', 'CROSSING', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'think', ""n't"", 'rated', 'too', 'highly', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'use', 'missing', 'spouse', 'board', 'ship', 'theme', 'been', 'overused', 'therefore', 'one', 'not', 'appreciated', 'interesting', 'topic', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'acting', 'unconvincing', 'found', 'Rennie', 'bland', 'disinterested', 'middle-to-ending', 'have', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'merit', 'watching', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'photography', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'including', 'using', 'fog', 'heighten', 'suspense.BLACK', 'WIDOW', 'Now', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'acting', 'was', 'up', 'musical', 'standards', 'perfect', 'Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'was', 'definitely', 'miscast', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'seemed', 'be', 'as', 'bored', 'was', 'performance', 'Reginald', 'Gardner', 'was', 'most', 'convincing', 'Ginger', 'Roger', 'shamefully', 'scared', 'married-for-money', 'husband', 'ending', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'predictable', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'was', 'positive', 'note', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'clothing', 'worn', 'Rogers.I', 'have', 'given', 'collection', 'film', 'noir', 'movies', 'review', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'group', 'black', 'white', 'one', 'color', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'low', 'cost', 'even', 'hours', 'enjoyment']",N/A

1335358,A1EXBK6NNHJ4PW,B003B3V0RA,Emma Richards,"[24, 31]","I recently bought this set at Costco for $8.99 for one reason, and one reason only: Laura. This classic has been one of my favorite films noir ever since I saw it years ago, so I was delighted to find it at such a cheap price, and with three others interesting looking films noir thrown in, to boot!So, did the set live up to my expecations? Well, kind of. I had never even heard of the three other movies included in the set (Black Widow, Call Northside 777 and Dangerous Crossing), so I really didn't know what to expect. After watching all the movies in the set, I'm sort of in two minds about it (though, on the whole, I'm glad I bought it). The only really great one was Laura; Call Northside 777 was good; Black Widow was enjoyable, but I wouldn't go so far as to actually call it good; and Dangerous Crossing was, frankly, atrocious.I'll give a short synopsis and review of each one:Black Widow (1954)-Synopsis: An ambitious young female writer commits suicide in the apartment of a male friend, a famous Broadway producer. Or was it murder?-Review: Going into this, my thoughts were that this was basically going to be All About Eve with murder (and camp). After having seen it, I still think that's a fairly accurate summation, but I also thought it would be, well, really bad. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, Nancy Ordway is no Eve Harrington, but the dialog is fairly snappy and the central mystery keeps you guessing. All in all, what promised to be an amusingly bad melodrama turned out to be a fairly engrossing whodunit (though don't get me wrong, it's extremely melodramatic). Not a movie I would buy on its own, but it's entertaining and enjoyable enough to merit being included in this boxset.-Rating: 3/5Call Northside 777 (1948)-Synopsis: An ace reporter reopens an eleven year old case of cop killing, and reluctantly comes to the conclusion that the convicted man is innocent. Based on a true story.-Review: I went into this one with fairly high expectations. Not only does it star James Stewart, of whom everyone is a fan, but the idea of a copkiller being wrongfully convicted is always an intriguing one, as it deals so closely with the possibilities of police and government corruption. When a police officer is killed, his or her fellow policemen will, naturally, feel revengeful and want to punish whomever did it, but this often clouds their judgment and gets in the way of them doing their job correctly, as they want to make a quick arrest and get an even quicker conviction. This sometimes mean the wrong person is held accountable, which is exactly what this movie is about.The acting is uniformly excellent, with Jimmy Stewart and Kasia Orzazewski being the stand-outs as the reporter and the mother of the convicted man, respectively. There are no stereotyped characters; you can even understand the viewpoints of the cops who are impeding the reporter's investigation. It's a good, solid film, definitely the second best of the bunch, after Laura. Well worth your time.-Rating: 3.75/5Dangerous Crossing (1953)-Synopsis: A newlywed couple boards a yacht for their honeymoon, but the husband seemingly vanishes into thin air. No one else on the boat has seen him, and they think his frantic bride is either lying or insane. Think The Lady Vanishes, only bad.-Review: Ugh. Based on the synopsis, this movie seemed like it would be half-decent. Boy, was I wrong. I don't want to go to in-depth because that would spoil it, more so than for the other movies in the set, but this was just awful. My main problem with it was that we, the audience, were supposed to be on the lead character's (played by Jeanne Crain) side. We were supposed to be rooting for her to prove that she was not crazy and that she really did have a husband who had mysteriously vanished. You see, the main storyline was not her husband's disappearance, but the other passengers and the crew believing her to be crazy. She had to go about finding her husband and proving everyone wrong. But here's the thing: after having seen the movie, I STILL am convinced that the lead character was psychotic. I don't know if it was Crain's acting or Leo Townsend's writing, but just 20 minutes into the movie I figured she was an escapee from an hospital for the criminally insane (there's a smile she gives at about the 27 minute mark that's absolutely chilling). In a movie of this kind, it is imperative that the audience's sympathy be entirely with the person whom everybody else thinks is crazy, otherwise the whole movie falls apart, which is what happened here. Not even Michael Rennie (Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still) could save this unholy mess of a film.There is one good thing about this movie, though, and that is the cinematography. The movie's set on a boat, mostly at night, so there's fog and darkness everywhere, which creates a very eerie setting, almost beautiful in its sinisterness. Too bad the rest of the movie was so terrible.-Rating: 1.5/5 (That .5 is for the cinematography.)Laura (1944)-Synopsis: A police detective falls in love with the woman whose murder he is investigating.-Review: What can I say that hasn't been said before? An acknowledged classic in the film noir genre, and for good reason. This movie is, to coin a phrase, practically perfect in every way. The acting (with the notable exception of Gene Tierney, who's always been good at standing around and looking pretty, and not much else) is fantastic, the dialog witty, the score beautiful and the twists memorable. Like I said, there's not much I can say about this brilliant film that others haven't already said, so I'm not going to say much in this review, only that Laura is the reason I bought this set, and the reason it's such a good investment. If you haven't already seen it, stop reading this review at once and do so. You won't regret it.-Rating: 4.5/5All in all, with this set you get four movies, one great, one good, one enjoyable and one bad, for just a few dollars.
