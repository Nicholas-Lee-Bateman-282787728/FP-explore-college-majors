1168146,A29ZEV20RCXV1D,B001AS5XNA,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[17, 20]","Don't hesitate on this one! Grab it! The second season PLUS what in my opinion is an equally important bonus area of discussion [all visual material] including various of the series participants and extra input from those who need no introduction to their high altitude climbing credentials and mountaineering achievements. So too, in the bonus material, the hard questions [read: TV documentary criticisms] of the documentary on Everest are not avoided nor in any way sugar-coated. You're looking at approximately 7 hours of visual material here between the TV episodes and the added bonus discussion material consisting of 4 extended episodes entitled, ""Everest: After the Climb"" . You absolutely can't beat it for under $15.00! This was the price [$14.97] when I did the review.I'll lay my cards on the table and as I always do especially if commenting on films [documentary or fiction!] or books that deal with the climbing and/or mountaineering community. I'm tired of seeing Russell Brice used as a sort of handy and proverbial punching bag and especially by, inter alia,  various and sundry types who wouldn't know a belay from a ballet or whose knowledge of high altitude climbing and its 'realities' wholly escapes them. Still others take the view that Brice is somehow the perceived ""culprit"" and allegedly 'responsible' [!?] for the David Sharp matter [2006] as if Russell had some hidden magic wand and could simply wave it around a few times and, voila, some 20 Sherpas could be made to suddenly materialize from his tent to initiate high altitude rescues of virtually anyone in trouble and regardless of altitude issues or weather considerations.The bonus material addresses various of these considerations. But it also addresses the 'realities' of high altitude climbing in general. For example, the question is put on the table in virtually any mountain rescue attempt by the narrator: Does it come down to a matter of ""who should be or shouldn't be rescued"" and Brice responds, rightly so in my opinion, that it has nothing to do with who 'should' or 'shouldn't be' rescued issues but rather a more realistic appraisal of ""who CAN be rescued"" and whether it is 'possible' and logistically feasible to do it! You don't produce the resources for a mountain rescue out of nothing! Or 'thin air', as it were. And the weather at hand is a significant factor not to mention the perils of the higher one climbs or the intricacies/complexities of the route. Naturally, there are always the exceptions to the rule who almost miraculously are saved but then these exceptions become the benchmarks for those who know nothing about high altitude climbing making with, ""See! 'X' and 'Y' were saved! Why not 'Z' ?"" It's simply not that easy! Look at the cumulative mountaineering experience of both Rob Hall and Scott Fischer [1996] but factors were present on the mountain that day which precluded their rescue. Folks can't relate that 'feet/meters' can be like 'miles/kilometers' in places like Everest and K2 [et al] -- that's something they just can't comprehend not to mention navigation issues during a white-out or numbing cold 'despite' protective and modern insulation gear.In any event, I think the visual discussion material following the second season episodes is well worth the listen! And the realities of high altitude mountaineering. We're also in the age of so-termed ""adventure tourism"" with a literal proliferation of various world-wide commercial entities offering to take clients to ""you name it"" but it's also true, IMO, that some of these clients have no business being at places like Everest or K2 where their prior climbing experience is virtually negligible not to mention altitude issues where some actually believe that the use of bottled oxygen brings them to 'sea level' breathing or that fixed ropes right to the summit itself 'assures a summit' --- NOTHING is 'assured' since it can't be! And it's not 'just' the weather to force one back, it's a whole gammut of factors than can go wrong and at 'any' level on the mountain much less over 26,000 feet. Client temperament(s) notwithstanding.It seems to me that certain websites have almost dedicated themselves to Russell Brice bashing with a veritable laundry list litany of J'accuse mongering so that if Russell can't pull off ad hoc rescue miracles while pulling rescuers from his derriere, as it were, or indeed take 'anyone' to the summit and back no matter how they are faltering or showing their lack of experience and/or physical stamina limitations on the trial runs, ahh, then he's the proverbial and alleged ""don't give a ****"" bad guy! Sherpas and guides are NOT there to die for the aspirations of the client especially, I'll add at once, for the client who despite literal hours of cajoling and pleading to turn back, proceed forward and perhaps expect and damn the consequences to both themselves and others -- or to be hand-held or short-roped to their dream. In the series, various 'did' finally listen to reason and turned back but the reality is that some do not despite the best efforts of others [including climbing partners or expedition leaders in some scenarios] to reason with them. And some of them are still up there. Or indeed, miraculously rescued 'by' the climbing community ... at least when feasible and possible to do so.Doc Tony",5,Grab this one!

My impression was that series 1 was more interesting as there was a greater variety of charathers whereas series 2 was overshadowed by the amusing Tim, whose ego was as big as his frame. The scenery is really lovely but there are annoying features, namely the obsessive Machismo, the personifcation by the charachters of the mountain and the frequent recapitulations which must have preceded and followed commercial breaks. Even so, it is all very enjoyable and one really wants to know who will summit. Clearly these guys have extrordinary self-discipline in this context but I wondered to myself whether this self-discipline was reflected in other parts of their lives. As the Dane rightly put it, his bigger challenge was his forthcoming marriage and in that he was spot on.

I have read other Discovery Channel DVD reviews that said the DVD's had only primitive navigation, little real effort at polish and zero extras.  This DVD set is like that.  Instead of a nice splash screen with navigation it just has text that says to play the programs.  It's about on the level of what a consumer set top DVD-R recorder does.  One example of that is a review on the Survivorman season 2 set that is available now (August 2008).  Now note that another release of season 2 of Survivorman will be released in October that is half the price and has actual Survivorman cover art.  Not sure what is going on.  I looked at the Discovery Channel site and they sell DVD's with single episodes with generic covers.  Some of those DVD's are available on Amazon for $22/episode.Just a guess but it looks like Discovery releases programs one episode at a time, then all of those in one set and eventually releases a nice boxed set version that is fully produced later.  Some people think the DVDs released earlier look like DVD-R's and I have to agree they have that look but I'm not certain.  If they stick to that pattern another Everest Beyond the Limit season 2 boxed set that has navigation and extras might be released in the future.  I think the simpler DVD sets may be rushed to market for people that want to buy episodes shortly after they are aired.Look for yourself here:""Everest Beyond the Limit: The Complete Season 1"" no menusEverest: Beyond the Limit The Complete 1st Season (3 Disc)""Everest Beyond the Limit"" with navigation and extrasEverest: Beyond the Limit""Survivorman Season 2"" with generic cover art and simple navigationSurvivorman Season 2 (4 DVD Set)""Survivorman Collection 2"" with nice cover artSurvivorman: Collection 2""Everest Beyond the Limit season 2 episode 8"" a single episode from season 2Everest: Beyond the Limit Season 2 - Episode 8: Now or NeverHowever, the actual program material in this set is good.

1168155,A1ZIY3F0B6X297,B001AS5XNA,K. Johnson,"[15, 16]","Having done some climbing, (many years ago) the subject matter and cinematography are highly compelling, and season 1 was very good.  Season 2 however, is a study on how you can take an already very dramatic subject, and stretch it ""beyond the limit"" to the point of ridiculous.I am not by any means berating the expedition members, (well, except for Betsy, who was a joke) but the film makers quest for high ratings seems to be the guiding force here.  I can almost hear them asking the following questions -1.  Just how many times can we show spinning images of all the metal in Tim's body?2.  Seems like there isn't enough drama this year, how about a fight between Tim and Russ?3.  How many times can we talk about HAPE and HACE?  I mean, after all, people need to hear it at least 30 times, don't they?4.  Why would we show all of the compelling, but silly aspects of climbing, when we can repeat the same footage, over and over and over and over and over.... (I do realize that TV shows need a certain amount of repetition, but 8 times within the same episode?)5.  Can we get a ridiculously unqualified female climber?  And, can we make her look even more stupid?  Just for laughs?In an attempt to make things more dramatic, as is usual with reality TV, some of the realism seems lacking.  I'm normally a huge Discovery fan, but if there is a season 3....I'll pass....I've basically already seen it.",2,High altitude drama....and repetition,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,1405,"['Having', 'done', 'climbing', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'subject', 'matter', 'cinematography', 'are', 'highly', 'compelling', 'season', '1', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Season', '2', 'however', 'study', 'how', 'can', 'take', 'already', 'very', 'dramatic', 'subject', 'stretch', 'limit', 'point', 'ridiculous.I', 'am', 'not', 'means', 'berating', 'expedition', 'members', 'well', 'Betsy', 'who', 'was', 'joke', 'film', 'makers', 'quest', 'high', 'ratings', 'be', 'guiding', 'force', 'here', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'asking', 'following', 'questions', '-1', 'Just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'show', 'spinning', 'images', 'metal', 'Tim', 'body', '2', 'Seems', ""n't"", 'enough', 'drama', 'year', 'how', 'fight', 'Tim', 'Russ', '3', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'talk', 'HAPE', 'HACE', 'mean', 'people', 'need', 'hear', 'least', '30', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", '4', 'Why', 'would', 'show', 'compelling', 'silly', 'aspects', 'climbing', 'when', 'can', 'repeat', 'same', 'footage', 'do', 'realize', 'TV', 'shows', 'need', 'certain', 'amount', 'repetition', '8', 'times', 'same', 'episode', '5', 'Can', 'get', 'ridiculously', 'unqualified', 'female', 'climber', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'stupid', 'Just', 'laughs', 'attempt', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'dramatic', 'usual', 'reality', 'TV', 'realism', 'lacking', ""'m"", 'normally', 'huge', 'Discovery', 'fan', 'season', '3', '.I', ""'ll"", 'pass', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'already', 'seen']",Everest: Beyond the Limit - Season 2

1168157,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B001AS5XNA,"pjf ""pjf""","[0, 0]","If you read books by real mountaineers, and have seen a few documentaries or movies (often which have scenery filmed elsewhere purporting to be the real thing, this reality tv show is worth it just for the scenery.  You get to see all the base camps and some of the landmarks of the north face of Everest. (you have to wait for season three to see the south face).  You also get to see a reality TV version of base camp, and a reality tv version of what a commercial expedition is like.Be aware this isn't real mountaineering. Safety lines are strung most of the way to the summit, and ladders have been affixed to places where technical rock climbing might be needed. Given all the amateurs attempting the climb, who bottleneck the routes regardless, this saves a lot of lives.  But it's a bit disappointing to see the steps laced with aluminum ladders.  Amateurs are being warned to climb with their legs too, not just pull themselves by yanking on the jumar clipped to the safety rope hard enough to pull the ice screws, snow stakes and pinions out.Given this is reality TV, you also have tons of manufactured drama, complete with a typical idiotic biker guy who talks big and ignores orders, then depends on Sherpas half his size to get him out of the trouble he got himself into, plus risking the lives of his guides.  The asthmatic Dane from season 1 is back to try and climb without gas. A cast of others want to be the first, the oldest, etc., which, given the hundreds of people climbing now, this is a little silly.  Another plans to do a double traverse from north to south face and back.  And there's a  fame hungry woman who did a little climbing ten years ago, and some trekking and decided being on a reality show about Everest was too good a chance to miss.  A lot is made of her incompetence.  Realistically, though, every year someone else makes the news who started ""climbing"" with Everest and makes it up and down. This year it was a 14 year old girl from India.  Given Everest is not a technical climb, some of these amateurs really can make it. What seems to sink Betsy is clear signs of trouble acclimatizing, and hypoxic behavior. I suspect she was added for the drama, to show someone struggling and have the big scene of will she or won't she be cut from the team.This is not a bad show, but it is a reality show, which means a lot of manufactured drama. I suppose they all thought just the scenery and the matter of fact story of commercial Everest climbs would not be enough drama. But I would have appreciated the show more without the manufactured drama, especially more wide pans of the various camps and landmarks, rather than more idiotic Tim drama which is what the producers went for. At least give us it in extras on the DVD (sadly they didn't).One thing I'll say for Russell Brice, his timing climbers has a lot of value, given they are climbing with Oxygen. I never heard this tactic mentioned before.  But it makes a lot of sense given that regardless how strong a climber is, or how technical they are, or how determined, if they don't have the speed, they'll die. Because climbers only have so many hours on their oxygen bottles. If they are slow, they are going to run out of gas. And most inexperienced poorly acclimated climbers then will just fall down in the snow, their brain a hypoxic fog, and perhaps not get up again.  So Russel's timing clients to the various camps is a great idea. Perhaps, if more expeditions required that, there would be fewer bottlenecks.The extras were not scenery or more prosaic camp life or climbing bits, but post climb discussions. Still, I thought the extras added a lot to the value of purchasing the DVD.In all, I would say if you are interested in Everest, this show is worth it, in spite of suffering (or fast forwarding perhaps, the second time you encounter it) though the silly reality show fake drama bits.",4,worth it for the sherpa cams,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3894,"['read', 'books', 'real', 'mountaineers', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'documentaries', 'movies', 'often', 'have', 'scenery', 'filmed', 'elsewhere', 'purporting', 'be', 'real', 'thing', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'just', 'scenery', 'get', 'see', 'base', 'camps', 'landmarks', 'north', 'face', 'Everest', 'have', 'wait', 'season', 'three', 'see', 'south', 'face', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'reality', 'TV', 'version', 'base', 'camp', 'reality', 'tv', 'version', 'what', 'commercial', 'expedition', 'like.Be', 'aware', ""n't"", 'real', 'mountaineering', 'Safety', 'lines', 'are', 'strung', 'most', 'way', 'summit', 'ladders', 'have', 'been', 'affixed', 'places', 'where', 'technical', 'rock', 'climbing', 'might', 'be', 'needed', 'Given', 'amateurs', 'attempting', 'climb', 'who', 'bottleneck', 'routes', 'regardless', 'lot', 'lives', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'see', 'steps', 'laced', 'aluminum', 'ladders', 'Amateurs', 'are', 'being', 'warned', 'climb', 'legs', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'pull', 'yanking', 'jumar', 'clipped', 'safety', 'rope', 'hard', 'enough', 'pull', 'ice', 'screws', 'snow', 'stakes', 'pinions', 'out.Given', 'reality', 'TV', 'also', 'have', 'tons', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'complete', 'typical', 'idiotic', 'biker', 'guy', 'who', 'big', 'orders', 'then', 'Sherpas', 'size', 'get', 'trouble', 'got', 'risking', 'lives', 'guides', 'asthmatic', 'Dane', 'season', '1', 'back', 'try', 'climb', 'gas', 'cast', 'others', 'want', 'be', 'first', 'oldest', 'etc.', 'given', 'hundreds', 'people', 'climbing', 'now', 'little', 'silly', 'plans', 'do', 'double', 'traverse', 'north', 'south', 'face', 'back', 'fame', 'hungry', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'little', 'climbing', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'trekking', 'decided', 'being', 'reality', 'show', 'Everest', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'chance', 'miss', 'lot', 'made', 'incompetence', 'Realistically', 'though', 'year', 'someone', 'else', 'news', 'who', 'started', 'climbing', 'Everest', 'down', 'year', 'was', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'India', 'Given', 'Everest', 'not', 'technical', 'climb', 'amateurs', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'What', 'sink', 'Betsy', 'clear', 'signs', 'trouble', 'acclimatizing', 'hypoxic', 'behavior', 'suspect', 'was', 'added', 'drama', 'show', 'someone', 'struggling', 'have', 'big', 'scene', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'cut', 'team.This', 'not', 'bad', 'show', 'reality', 'show', 'lot', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'suppose', 'thought', 'just', 'scenery', 'matter', 'fact', 'story', 'commercial', 'Everest', 'climbs', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'show', 'more', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'especially', 'more', 'wide', 'pans', 'various', 'camps', 'landmarks', 'rather', 'more', 'idiotic', 'Tim', 'drama', 'what', 'producers', 'went', 'least', 'give', 'extras', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", '.One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Russell', 'Brice', 'timing', 'climbers', 'lot', 'value', 'given', 'are', 'climbing', 'Oxygen', 'never', 'heard', 'tactic', 'mentioned', 'lot', 'sense', 'given', 'regardless', 'how', 'strong', 'climber', 'how', 'technical', 'are', 'how', 'determined', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'speed', ""'ll"", 'die', 'climbers', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'hours', 'oxygen', 'bottles', 'are', 'slow', 'are', 'going', 'run', 'out', 'gas', 'most', 'inexperienced', 'poorly', 'acclimated', 'climbers', 'then', 'will', 'just', 'fall', 'down', 'snow', 'brain', 'hypoxic', 'fog', 'perhaps', 'not', 'get', 'up', 'again', 'So', 'Russel', 'timing', 'clients', 'various', 'camps', 'great', 'idea', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'expeditions', 'required', 'would', 'be', 'fewer', 'bottlenecks.The', 'extras', 'were', 'not', 'scenery', 'more', 'prosaic', 'camp', 'life', 'climbing', 'bits', 'post', 'climb', 'discussions', 'Still', 'thought', 'extras', 'added', 'lot', 'value', 'purchasing', 'DVD.In', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'interested', 'Everest', 'show', 'spite', 'suffering', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'perhaps', 'second', 'time', 'encounter', 'silly', 'reality', 'show', 'fake', 'drama', 'bits']",Everest: Beyond the Limit - Season 2

The reason that I say it was ""almost as good as the first season"" in the title is because once you have experience it the first time then you aren't as caught off guard by the danger and the astonishing facts about climbing Everest. Another reason I didn't find it as good was and is on the cover of the DVD box. The fact that this lady reporter was involved when she had no experience (or little or none) and that so much time was spent on her ineptitude was really irritating. And again, why she is on the cover of the box is really aggrivating since she was such a small part of the show, or should have been and because she was pretty much shown to be a fraud who got on the show just simply for the story and to be on the show.
