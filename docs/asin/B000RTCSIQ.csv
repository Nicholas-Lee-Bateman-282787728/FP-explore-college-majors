1084018,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000RTCSIQ,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","This 2006 film begins in 1942 when a sailor, Anatoly, and his captain are captured by the Nazis.  A young Anatoly begs for his life and in turn, is asked to shoot his captain.  He does, and as the Nazis leave, the ship is blown up.  Anatoly survived.  He is found on the island and now resides in the Monastery.Jump to 1976, and from hereon in, Anatoly the Russian Orthodox monk is haunted by his past.  People come to the island to see him, as they believe he has powers to heal, can foresee the future and exorcise demons.  However, he does not feel worthy of this power, and chases some away.  He has incredible guilt as a sinner.He becomes an unusual character in the monastery, a nuisance, trouble maker, prankster, dirty and living amidst the boiler.  He often prays for forgiveness.  He has the brethren thinking.This film almost looks black and white with the desolate winter and the vast waters of the sea.  The pacing is moderate, as one is intrigued by the actions of Anatoly.  This film was a winner of many awards, including Winner of 5 Nika Awards (Russian Oscars) including Best Film.  ......Rizzo",4,The unusual Monk!,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1112,"['2006', 'film', '1942', 'when', 'sailor', 'Anatoly', 'captain', 'are', 'captured', 'Nazis', 'A', 'young', 'Anatoly', 'begs', 'life', 'turn', 'asked', 'shoot', 'captain', 'Nazis', 'leave', 'ship', 'blown', 'up', 'Anatoly', 'survived', 'found', 'island', 'now', 'Monastery.Jump', '1976', 'hereon', 'Anatoly', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'monk', 'haunted', 'past', 'People', 'come', 'island', 'see', 'believe', 'powers', 'heal', 'can', 'foresee', 'future', 'exorcise', 'demons', 'However', 'not', 'feel', 'worthy', 'power', 'away', 'incredible', 'guilt', 'sinner.He', 'unusual', 'character', 'monastery', 'nuisance', 'trouble', 'maker', 'prankster', 'dirty', 'living', 'amidst', 'boiler', 'often', 'forgiveness', 'brethren', 'thinking.This', 'film', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'desolate', 'winter', 'vast', 'waters', 'sea', 'pacing', 'moderate', 'one', 'intrigued', 'actions', 'Anatoly', 'film', 'was', 'winner', 'many', 'awards', 'including', 'Winner', '5', 'Nika', 'Awards', 'Russian', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Film', 'Rizzo']",The Island

1084020,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000RTCSIQ,Christopher Culver,"[4, 7]","The 2006 film OSTROV (The Island) is a story of religious faith in the bleak Russian north. As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.But Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.The film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.Nonetheless, I found OSTROV rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's STALKER or the ending of OFFRET).All in all, OSTROV is entertaining, but not terribly deep.",3,"Entertaining and a glimpse of a lifestyle mysterious to many outside Russia, but very melodramatic",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,2002,"['2006', 'film', 'OSTROV', 'Island', 'story', 'religious', 'faith', 'bleak', 'Russian', 'north', 'film', '1942', 'young', 'Russian', 'sailor', 'Anatoly', 'forced', 'Germans', 'shoot', 'captain', 'Tikhon', 'Left', 'dead', 'Anatoly', 'up', 'shore', 'island', 'where', 'monastery', 'located', 'next', 'three', 'decades', 'monks', 'trying', 'atone', 'killing', 'friend', 'shipmate', 'Eventually', 'lowest', 'low', 'Anatoly', 'granted', 'clairvoyance', 'ability', 'work', 'miracles', 'steady', 'stream', 'visitors', 'island', 'seek', 'help.But', 'Anatoly', 'certain', 'kind', 'saint', 'specific', 'Russian', 'tradition', 'holy', 'fool', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'fellow', 'monks', 'point', 'think', 'insane', 'eventually', 'everything', 'revealed', 'communicate', 'key', 'spiritual', 'point', 'Between', 'ministering', 'outsiders', 'who', 'visit', 'dealing', 'exasperated', 'brethren', 'Anatoly', 'rest.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'way', 'plot', 'engaging', 'enough', 'audiences', 'outside', 'Russia', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'Russians', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Communism', 'informative', 'presentation', 'realities', 'Orthodox', 'monastic', 'life', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'Pyotr', 'Mamonov', ""n't"", 'look', 'decrepit', 'real-life', 'screen', 'really', 'convincing', 'starets', 'who', 'spent', 'decades', 'unforgiving', 'environment.Nonetheless', 'found', 'OSTROV', 'rather', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'seeming', 'best', 'sappy', 'worst', 'outright', 'propaganda', 'certain', 'kind', 'contemporary', 'Russian', 'Orthodoxy', ""n't"", 'represent', 'faith', 'entirely', 'well', 'When', 'one', 'Russian', 'Orthodoxy', 'cinema', 'one', 'tempted', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'even', 'when', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', ""n't"", 'directly', 'using', 'Orthodox', 'themes', 'still', 'communicated', 'Christian', 'truths', 'more', 'powerfully', 'anything', 'film', 'think', 'climax', 'Tarkovsky', 'STALKER', 'ending', 'OFFRET', '.All', 'OSTROV', 'entertaining', 'not', 'terribly', 'deep']",The Island
1084021,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000RTCSIQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Mesmerizingly beautiful and profoundly moving, this 2006 prize winning Russian film THE ISLAND is gratefully brought to the public by Film Movement. Everything about the film - the screenplay by Dmitri Sobolev, the haunting musical score by Vladimir Martynov, the cinematography by Andrei Zhegalov and the direction by Pavel Lounguine (aka Lungin) - is the epitome of sophistication in cinematic art.The story opens in 1942 in Russia where Nazis come aboard a little Russian craft manned by Tikhon (Aleksei Zelensky) and his mate Anatoly (Timofey Tribuntsev): the Nazi officer threatens Anatoly and in the end has Anatoly shoot Tikhon and the shot Tikhon drops into the cold ocean. Years later somewhere in Northern Russia in a small Russian Orthodox monastery an older Anatoly (Pyotr Mamonov) confuses his fellow monks with his bizarre behavior and his apparent ability to cast out demons, heal, and foretell the future to people who visit the island monastery particularly for Anatoly's gifts.  But Anatoly's mind is racked with guilt because he knows he killed his closest friend Tikhon. Father Filaret (Viktor Sukhorukov), the principal monk, falls under Anatoly's spell and because of Anatoly's simple life, Filaret gives up his worldly goods to be more like Anatoly. Father Iov (Dmitriy Dyuzhev) attempts to bring sanity into Anatoly's life, but in the end he is deeply moved by the crazy priest. One of the visitors brings his insane daughter to Anatoly, Anatoly frees her of demons, and the grateful visitor tells Anatoly that he did not indeed kill Tikhon - that he survived and still lives. And it is in this peace that Anatoly allows himself to die.The supporting cast has only brief moments on screen but they are memorable. The focus of the film is the portrayal of Anatoly by Pyotr Mamonov - it is a miracle of acting. This is a film that will haunt the viewer not only because of its message but also because of its beauty. As Santayana said, `Sanity is a madness put to good uses.'
