Unfortunately, the poor script really works against them.The premise has already been done to death.  There are two high school ""kids"" played by people in their early to mid-20s.  The guy is a rebel, trouble making football player.  The girl is a popular, well behaved cheerleader.  They develop a rocky but passionate relationship.  At the end, they ride off into the sunset together.  Ho hum.The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the good acting by both Quinn and Hannah.  This movie was very early in their careers and you can't blame them for taking on these roles.  They perform admirably but ultimately become mired in a story that goes nowhere.However, you could certainly do worse as far as '80s movies go.  Also of note is the surprising fact that Aidan Quinn performed frontal nudity in this film.  It was his big screen debut and certainly must have taken guts to do.

286629,A33FCLUEQSUD68,6301977602,Claire,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie while in high school in 1988 (4 years after it came out) on tv and it was of course edited for nudity. Just the same, though, the editing didn't take away from the movie's ""Rebel Without A Cause""/ Romeo & Juliet love story which inspired me to wish I could be Daryl Hannah running away on the back of a motorcycle wrapped around a hunky-hot bad boy. When I bought the VHS copy later I was a little shocked to see all of the nudity including Aidan Quinn's full frontal. Now that this movie is finally on DVD, the picture is better but there is no more of Quinn's nudity. They edited that out but don't fear, boys, Hannah's nudity remains intact. I didn't really mind the editing since the ending is absolutely the best one ever and makes perfect use of Bob Seger's classic ""Roll Me Away."" I love movies where young lovers run away without a care in the world such as no education, no money, nowhere to go except anywhere but here... (See also ""Fire With Fire""- another great 80's movie with similar themes.) As for this dvd, I think it's a little overpriced but the movie is great. The music really makes the movie and the acting is also good. These were early roles for Aidan Quinn (his first, actually) as well as Daryl Hannah, Adam Baldwin and Jennifer Grey (also her first role.) The picture is much better and brighter than on the VHS copy but, unfortunately, the sound is not very good. It is very difficult to hear dialogue in certain parts. As for extras, of course, you can forget about any of those. All you get is the movie and an edited one at that. But at least the music was kept intact, something that doesn't always happen when movies are transferred to dvd. The only reason I didn't give the review all 5 stars was because the sound was flawed.",4,Better in some ways but less in others...,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,1777,"['saw', 'movie', 'high', 'school', '1988', '4', 'years', 'came', 'out', 'tv', 'was', 'course', 'edited', 'nudity', 'Just', 'same', 'though', 'editing', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', '/', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'love', 'story', 'inspired', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'running', 'away', 'back', 'motorcycle', 'wrapped', 'hunky-hot', 'bad', 'boy', 'When', 'bought', 'VHS', 'copy', 'later', 'was', 'little', 'shocked', 'see', 'nudity', 'including', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'full', 'frontal', 'Now', 'movie', 'finally', 'DVD', 'picture', 'better', 'more', 'Quinn', 'nudity', 'edited', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'boys', 'Hannah', 'nudity', 'intact', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'editing', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'best', 'one', 'ever', 'perfect', 'use', 'Bob', 'Seger', 'classic', 'Roll', 'Me', 'Away', 'love', 'movies', 'where', 'young', 'lovers', 'run', 'away', 'care', 'world', 'such', 'education', 'money', 'nowhere', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'See', 'also', 'Fire', 'Fire', 'great', '80', 'movie', 'similar', 'themes', 'dvd', 'think', 'little', 'overpriced', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'really', 'movie', 'acting', 'also', 'good', 'were', 'early', 'roles', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'first', 'actually', 'as', 'well', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'also', 'first', 'role', 'picture', 'much', 'better', 'brighter', 'VHS', 'copy', 'unfortunately', 'sound', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'difficult', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'certain', 'parts', 'extras', 'course', 'can', 'forget', 'get', 'movie', 'edited', 'one', 'least', 'music', 'was', 'kept', 'intact', 'something', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'transferred', 'dvd', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'review', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'sound', 'was', 'flawed']",N/A
286630,A1L1NJNVL5ICZB,6301977602,"Cloudburst2000 ""OasisRocks""","[7, 7]","Aidan Quinn and Daryll Hannah both do superb jobs in portraying the angst and confusion of young love.  Quinn plays Johnny Rourke, a misunderstood rebel from &quot;the wrong side of the tracks.&quot;  Johnny is angry at the world because of his less-then-ideal life, and he can't wait to get out of Everton to a place where no one will know him.  He basically wants to start life with a clean slate where no knows that he is Johnny Rourke, the kid whose mother abandoned the family and whose father is a drunk.  Hannah plays Tracey Prescott, the &quot;perfect&quot; head cheerleader who dates the quarterback.  Tracey is the kind of person who does everything that everyone expects of her.  She tries to please everyone else even if it means that she is not happy.  Tracey just wants to lead a life where there are no expectations of her and she only needs to please herself.Johnny and Tracey share an intense attraction and get involved in a secret and steamy romance.  Johnny provides Tracey with a sense of danger and daring that she is missing from her comfortable, hum-drum existence, while Tracey provides Johnny with much-needed calming influence.  This movie has some graphic sex scenes.  These scenes would be considered rather risque even by today's standards so it was definitely risque for the mid-80's.The two characters are perfectly suited for each other, and they find that they actually have quite alot in common...namely their desire to find that ever-elusive happiness.  Will they find it together?  This question is answered in the final scenes of the movie.  The finales scenes of the movie are one of the best climaxes I have seen.  Will Tracey take a chance and follow her heart by going with Johnny or will she follow her mind and continue living her comfortable existence even if it means foregoing happiness?  Rent the movie and find out.I also find it interesting that the only other person in the movie who seems to realize that Johnny is more than what he seems to be is Tracey's younger brother, Davey.  He seems to understand that Johnny is &quot;a diamond in the rough&quot; and approves of his sister's relationship with Johnny.  His character is very enlightening even though he only appears in a couple of scenes.All of the actors in this movie did wonderful acting jobs and truly added to the depth of the movie.  Coach Barton and Johnny's fellow football team member, Randy Daniels(who also happens to be the quarterback and Tracey's boyfriend) both do superb acting jobs.  The way they pick on Johnny simply because they don't understand him is very reminiscent of what actually occurrs in schools throughout the country.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good coming-of-age dramas.  Younger viewers will be able to relate to the characters because they likely faced these types of situations in high school, and older viewers will be able to see what kinds of pressures their children face while attending school.  However, viewers who are too young to deal with explicit sex scenes should wait a few years before watching this great movie.",5,A Wonderful Story of First Love,984960000,"03 19, 2001",2001,3094,"['Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Daryll', 'Hannah', 'do', 'superb', 'jobs', 'portraying', 'angst', 'confusion', 'young', 'love', 'Quinn', 'Johnny', 'Rourke', 'misunderstood', 'rebel', 'quot', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks.', 'quot', 'Johnny', 'angry', 'world', 'less-then-ideal', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'Everton', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'will', 'know', 'basically', 'start', 'life', 'clean', 'slate', 'where', 'Johnny', 'Rourke', 'kid', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'family', 'father', 'drunk', 'Hannah', 'Tracey', 'Prescott', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'quarterback', 'Tracey', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'everything', 'everyone', 'please', 'everyone', 'else', 'even', 'not', 'happy', 'Tracey', 'just', 'lead', 'life', 'where', 'are', 'expectations', 'only', 'please', 'herself.Johnny', 'Tracey', 'share', 'intense', 'attraction', 'get', 'involved', 'secret', 'steamy', 'romance', 'Johnny', 'Tracey', 'sense', 'danger', 'daring', 'missing', 'comfortable', 'hum-drum', 'existence', 'Tracey', 'Johnny', 'much-needed', 'calming', 'influence', 'movie', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'rather', 'risque', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'definitely', 'risque', ""mid-80's.The"", 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'other', 'find', 'actually', 'have', 'quite', 'alot', 'common', 'namely', 'desire', 'find', 'ever-elusive', 'happiness', 'Will', 'find', 'together', 'question', 'answered', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'finales', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'climaxes', 'have', 'seen', 'Will', 'Tracey', 'take', 'chance', 'follow', 'heart', 'going', 'Johnny', 'will', 'follow', 'mind', 'continue', 'living', 'comfortable', 'existence', 'even', 'foregoing', 'happiness', 'Rent', 'movie', 'find', 'out.I', 'also', 'find', 'interesting', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'movie', 'who', 'realize', 'Johnny', 'more', 'what', 'be', 'Tracey', 'younger', 'brother', 'Davey', 'understand', 'Johnny', 'quot', 'diamond', 'rough', 'quot', 'approves', 'sister', 'relationship', 'Johnny', 'character', 'very', 'enlightening', 'even', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes.All', 'actors', 'movie', 'did', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'jobs', 'truly', 'added', 'depth', 'movie', 'Coach', 'Barton', 'Johnny', 'fellow', 'football', 'team', 'member', 'Randy', 'Daniels', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'quarterback', 'Tracey', 'boyfriend', 'do', 'superb', 'acting', 'jobs', 'way', 'pick', 'Johnny', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'what', 'actually', 'schools', 'country.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'coming-of-age', 'dramas', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'likely', 'faced', 'types', 'situations', 'high', 'school', 'older', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'kinds', 'pressures', 'children', 'face', 'attending', 'school', 'However', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'deal', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'should', 'wait', 'few', 'years', 'watching', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

The astonishingly beautiful couple of Aidan Quinn (Johnny) and Darrell Hannah (Tracey) work really well together as high school seniors who feed upon each others emotions.  You just have to see it because it is almost impossible to describe the chilling atmosphere of this movie set in a cold little mountain town where the steel mill is the major employer and the fact that someone has a job is pretty remarkable.  It has an amazing 80s soundtrack, a dance scene set to Romeo Void that is one of the best I have ever seen, a really great cast and full frontal by Aidan himself.  My favorite line is when Johnny has forced his way into Tracey's house and upon seeing her parent's bedroom says ""So this where they made you"" in his low sexy voice.I dearly loved it when I was young and romantic so I bought it and watched it again recently.  I must say that maturity took the edge off my enjoyment, I was concerned that Tracey was going to regret riding off in the sunset with an attractive but very angry kid from a really bad home life with a tendency towards violence (I think that Jackson Browne was abusive toward her in real life also).  However, were I seventeen again and Johnny had showed up at my door on a motorcycle looking very punk in his father's suit coat and a narrow tie, bearing a corsage he had thoughtfully dyed black to take me to the high school dance, I too, would have put on my cheerleader jacket and climbed on back for ride of a lifetime.",4,An ultimate teen movie,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1584,"['So', 'much', 'better', 'new', 'MTV', 'watched', 'James', 'Foley', 'movie', 'obsessively', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'couple', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Johnny', 'Darrell', 'Hannah', 'Tracey', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'who', 'feed', 'others', 'emotions', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'almost', 'impossible', 'describe', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'set', 'cold', 'little', 'mountain', 'town', 'where', 'steel', 'mill', 'major', 'employer', 'fact', 'someone', 'job', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'amazing', '80s', 'soundtrack', 'dance', 'scene', 'set', 'Romeo', 'Void', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'full', 'frontal', 'Aidan', 'favorite', 'line', 'when', 'Johnny', 'forced', 'way', 'Tracey', 'house', 'seeing', 'parent', 'bedroom', 'So', 'where', 'made', 'low', 'sexy', 'voice.I', 'dearly', 'loved', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'romantic', 'so', 'bought', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'must', 'say', 'maturity', 'took', 'edge', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'concerned', 'Tracey', 'was', 'going', 'regret', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'attractive', 'very', 'angry', 'kid', 'really', 'bad', 'home', 'life', 'tendency', 'towards', 'violence', 'think', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'was', 'abusive', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'However', 'were', 'seventeen', 'again', 'Johnny', 'had', 'showed', 'up', 'door', 'motorcycle', 'looking', 'very', 'punk', 'father', 'suit', 'coat', 'narrow', 'tie', 'bearing', 'corsage', 'had', 'thoughtfully', 'dyed', 'black', 'take', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'cheerleader', 'jacket', 'climbed', 'back', 'ride', 'lifetime']",N/A

286638,ADOSOJ9HJAHDU,6301977602,"M.M. ""Muppet Fan""","[12, 12]","I still remember watching this movie as a small child--I think it was one of the first R-rated films I ever saw.  And I still love it as much now as I did then.First, there's the scenery....I love that whole run-down, industrial, working-class feel to the film. Reminds me a lot of my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA. In fact, the film locations--areas around Weirton and Stubenville, from what I recall-- are pretty closeby to where I live in PA.Okay, the story is pretty generic--your stereotypical kids-from-the-opposite-sides-of-the-tracks fall in love---but the soundtrack is slammin'--early-80's new wave mixed in with classic rock---a lot of good choices for the scenes, everything from Kim Wilde's ""Kids in America"" during the oh-so-perfect ""break in and trash the high school before stripping down to their skivvies and jumping in the pool and making out before retiring to the boiler room and getting busy"" scene to the grande finale with Bob Segar's ""Roll Me Away"" playing in the background.More on that high school scene.... I still remember sneaking downstairs in the middle of the night whenever this movie was shown as a late night feature on TV, just to see that one sequence, and being pissed off because they always went to commercial before the love scenes, or else just cut them out altogether......but I know why they did that now. After searching for many years and  finally finding a video store that carried this film and watching it untinterrupted and uncut, I was surprised by how explicit the scenes were. But it had--and still has--some of the hottest, most intense love scenes ever committed to celluloid.  Aidan Quinn looked hotter than hot (naked AND clothed!!), and his portrayal of Johhny had an intensity and sincerety that made you both sympathize and fear him a little at the same time. (And so many guys I know wonder why us ""good girls"" always go for the ""bad boys!!!!!"") Daryl Hannah (who still looks exactly the same now as she did then--Good heavens, does that girl ever age?? Or eat, for that matter??) also gives a stellar performance, although her character got on my nerves sometimes--that girl really needed her own voice and a backbone. I couldn't believe the way she let her boyfriend treat her. I would have loved to see a scene where she just slapped the hell outta that guy.I also loved the supporting who's who of cast members...Haviland Morris (aka Jake Ryan's perfect-looking girlfriend Caroline in ""Sixteen Candles"")  to Jennifer Grey (""Dirty Dancing""--yet another perennial favorite)  to Adam Baldwin (who was in ""My Bodyguard,"" which also starred a young and gorgeous Matt Dillon...anyone remember that film??).All in all, still a great 80's film that at times gets swept under the rug by all of those people who worship John Hughes movies.

The tension between Quinn and Hannah, and De Young... whew! And, the dirty bits! (Oh!) I was also pleasantly surprised by a number of familiar faces along the way that weren't quite so familiar 25 years ago. And, the soundtrack is fantastic, especially Romeo Void and Inxs.Anyway, I don't have the VHS to compare it to, but this DVD-R does appear to be widescreen, as advertised on the case. Yes, I would have paid twice as much had it been remastered and restored, but it looked pretty good (for such an obscure, 25 year old movie) and the sound was pretty good, too.Only two, very minor draw-backs that came to my mind, aside from the lack of any bonus material whatsoever (BOO!!!), (1) the trailer that's included isn't a trailer at all, it's basically just the first few minutes of the film, and (2) I can't be absolutely certain now, but i seem to recall that when Hannah bursts into the gymnasium as Quinn and De Young are trashing each other and the classroom down the hall, she screamed ""He's going to kill him!"". On this DVD-R, she bursts through the doors, her mouth opens and we cut back the Quinn and De Young fighting. Hmmm... (what can i say, i'm a completist.)So, seeing as there ain't no better copy anywhere in the world, i gotta give this an 8+.Come on, WB, put a little more effort into it.

The movie stars Adain Quinn as Johnny in his break out role & Daryl Hannah early in her career plays Tracey. Movie takes place in a gray,cold, smoggy, depressing looking steel town somewhere in Pennsylvania. Johnny is a troubled smart {...} rebel with a alcholic father, no friends & years before his mother abandoned the family for reasons that are not clear. Tracey is a pretty & popular cheerleader with a loving upper middle class family preparing for college in the fall. But something is missing for Tracey - her boyfriend & friends bore her & she feels she is missing out on something. She desparately wants to live on the edge instead of her predictable, safe, day-to-day, ho-hum exsistance. Tracey wants excitement. She exchanges glances in class with Johnny. A charity dance pairs her with him by chance. They play cat & mouse games. He challenges her. She takes dares. She does something her friends have advised her not to do, she takes up with the mysterious, sexy & dangerous Johnny & starts really living & feeling for the first time in her life. Their chemistry & sexual attraction is instant & all consuming. The sexual tention between them is amazing! They fall quickly in love & lust. Film contains more than one scene of the sexiest, most graphic, explicit & passionate sex scenes allowed in a R rated film. Full frontal nudity. A steamy pool scene. A love scene in a boiler room of their empty school. Her parents bed. You can almost feel Johnny's obsession with Tracey. His eyes are so amazing! A excellent soundtrack with Bob Segar's songs & new wave music of the 1980's really adds to the film. The ending really leaves it up to your imagination as to what might happen next. Do they really ride off into the sunset forever? I would really recommend you track this film down -it won't dissappoint. This is one of my favorite films of all time.

He wanted to make a film in the spirit of ""The Deer Hunter."" He wanted to find a cemetery near a steel plant, and he did find such a location in Weirton. The film was shot in Weirton, Wheeling, Steubenville, and a few other local places. He came to town with an unknown actor by the name of Aidan Quinn. His co-star was Daryl Hannah who had been in ""Blade Runner""(1982) and a handful of other lesser-known films. Foley had a screenplay by a then-unknown writer, Chris Columbus (director of Harry Potter films and ""Home Alone 2""), a German transplant cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, who had shot John Sayles' film, ""Baby, It's You""(1983) after a career in Germany shooting Fassbinder's films. The last credit in the film is to moi. Unfortunately, the film died, and even the Weirton Public Library refused to show our 16 mm print of the film since it hasa torrid love scene in the high school pool between the stars.

286644,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,6301977602,S. T. Peterson,"[2, 3]","If this were 1984 I doubt I would give this movie a full star review. Back then watching these movies I never really understood the recklessness (pun not intended) even though I understood wanting to get out of Dodge because it was depressing, oppressive, repressive and in general a place where you went no where. But today, looking back, older and a little wiser I guess I can get it, on several levels. I think part of this was the fulfillment of the 60s freedom activist movements. People say the 60s and 70s were crazy. I think our society all over saw it in full swing in the 80s actually and movies like this show that--it is a historical perspective. It was the complete transition from what was to what we see now. And I can see wanting to ""be different"" when you live in a place like the setting of this town too. You are different, not in a better than you way, or eccentric way, but you want something different for yourself. People portrayed in this movie are the people that don't settle down in the towns that they grew up in but move off and experience things they never imagined (good and bad). It also shows something that may be more common now and taken for granted--crazy home life. It shows how it affects a kid. Anyway this movie shows all of this and does it well. The plot is sound . . . there is a beginning, middle and end. The characters have actually something to say, not just jibberish. There is definitely a lot of profanity and sex but that is all part of the story actually, believe it or not. And after having seen the other teen movies or hard-on-his-luck-drifter movies of the 80s and afterwards I would say that this was the original, although it doesn't seem to have been given credit for it. Anyway this is not my favorite genre but I have discovered Aiden Quinn lately. He never was a favorite of mine, ever, until lately. And I think he does a great job in this movie. And that is why I saw it. This movie, on a smaller scale, has a specific setting that you saw a lot of in the early 80s--rust bucket America. While we never hear the name of the town it is defintely a steel works town. And then there was All the Right Moves set in such a place. And Flashdance set in Pittsburgh. Etc. All of these movies were based in the midwestern fading industrial towns where people were seeing a decline in their communities and it definitely shows in what you seen in these movies.
