Obviously, his best role was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" where he was evil personified.  However, in ""Fracture"", he is also excellent as the alleged killer of his philandering wife.In brief, ""Fracture"" is a court room drama.  Hopkins plays the part of Ted Crawford who has chosen to murder his wife in cold blood.  The crime is to be prosecuted by Ryan Gosling playing the role of Willy Beachum.  To Beachum, the case is a ""slam dunk"".  Apparently, there is a signed confession, a murder weapon and a motive.  However, as we soon learn, the case is far more complicated than it appears to be a first glance.  Ted Crawford is a clever man who has left no tracks.  Indeed, he is acquitted.  But hubris then takes hold.  If only he had chosen not to continue to press the envelope.On small criticism I have of the movie is that the gun was never traced by its serial number.  When you see the movie, this point will make sense.  It's a clear weakness in the plot.  If not, the police department involved was monumentally incompetent.In spite of my criticism, the movie is worth seeing.

DA Ryan Gosling.Knowing his younger wife is having an affair with a police detective, Hopkins awaits her arrival home and shoots her in the left cheek. The bullet travels through her brain and lodges against the skull, but she doesn't die.The cop boyfriend arrives to investigate a reported shooting, not realizing who the victim is. Naturally he's upset when he sees his lover lying near death. Hopkins cooly admits to shooting her, has the weapon nearby. At the police station he willingly signs a confession.Meanwhile, Gosling is a lawyer on the way up. He likes nothing better than to win in court, and his 97% success rate shows he's good at it. After destroying in trial the case of a top-notch defense attorney, Gosling is hired by the loser's law firm, the most prestigious in L.A. He's given his two weeks notice at the DA's office, but has a chance to rack up another courtroom victory before leaving the City's employ, an open-and-shut case of a man who's confessed to the attempted murder of his spouse.Hopkins takes legal procedures in a most cavalier manner, even acts as his own lawyer. At one point before the trial he offers Gosling a great deal of cash if he will defend him, with a warning that things will become messy if he remains prosecutor. These words of caution go unheeded by the young DA who has, in his mind, already moved on to a new career with that big money firm. Besides, this case is a slam dunk, right?

Gosling plays a young, hotshot prosecuting attorney on his way to bigger and better things with a change of scenery to corporate law but gets stuck with this open-and-shut case right before he switches firms.

A husband shoots his wife right in the face.  At first we think she's dead, but later we find out she survives, but is lying in a hospital bed.  This was the only good moment because it was very mysterious when it happened.As soon as that shooting scene is over, the movie slips into a *boring* story for the remainder of the film (the other 95% of the running time).  The only other segment I liked was at the very end.  It was certainly a twist, but not the best ending you've ever seen, and most likely not the kind of twist you wanted to see.The entire story deals mostly with a lawyer who occasionally has some conversations with the crazy wife-shooting husband, and that was flat out WRONG.  Focusing on the lawyer more than the husband was a big mistake, because the husband was the one with the interesting character- he was basically a crazy old man who liked to play mind games.  Certainly more interesting than spending the majority of time focusing on the lawyer and his uninteresting relationship with his girlfriend (not to mention acting unbelievable in his lawyer role for the most part- he was very quiet, and didn't act like he really knew what he was doing).  Why did the writers wanna focus on THIS guy?  I have no idea.And that makes up over 90% of the film.

(Ryan Gosling), to find the flaw, and bring him to justice. Despite a somewhat flat finale (the flaw should be obvious, if you are observant), the performances are so good that the film is a genuinely entertaining noir.Hopkins' on-screen persona is so well established, at this point in his career, that his back-story as a brilliant, charming psychopath requires little screen time. A scene showing his authority at work, another of him spying on his much younger wife (Embeth Davidtz) enjoying an indiscretion at a motel, and his confrontation with the cheating spouse, ending with a bullet in her head, just seems 'natural'. Of course, this is just the framework to a scheme that will also destroy her lover, and humiliate the police and judicial system, while he smiles and taunts Gosling. Nobody 'taunts' better than Hopkins, and his genteel superiority and cockiness is great fun to watch!Gosling's role is far more complex, and isn't helped by an abrupt reversal of his morality that is poorly written, but he does a remarkable job. A country boy, complete with a southern twang, he disguises a self-centered ruthlessness with an off-handed charm. With a 97% conviction rate (achieved by passing 'no-win' cases off to others), he coldly breaks an agreement with a defense counsel to win a big case, resulting in a job offer from the prestigious firm he'd just defeated. He is on the fast track, a fact he plays to the hilt, as he serves his notice to the D.A.'s office, is introduced into the world of 'big fees', and seduces his mentor (Rosamund Pike, sporting a perfect American accent). Reluctantly,  he agrees to one last assignment, the arraignment of Hopkins...which will knock his well-laid plans completely off-kilter, as his involvement is a key element in Hopkin's scheme.While there are obvious plot-holes (how could Hopkins be certain Gosling would be the DA assigned to the case?), the cat-and-mouse duel between the adversaries is a joy, with two actors at the top of their game.""Fracture"" isn't a great film, but it is involving, and Hopkins and Gosling's performances give it an extra 'star' in my rating!",4,Nifty Mystery Benefits from Standout Leads...,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2320,"['Fracture', 'trods', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground', 'mystery', 'lovers', 'genius', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'plans', ""'Perfect"", 'Crime', 'up', 'young', 'collar', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'D.A', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'find', 'flaw', 'bring', 'justice', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'finale', 'flaw', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'are', 'observant', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'noir.Hopkins', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'so', 'well', 'established', 'point', 'career', 'back-story', 'brilliant', 'charming', 'psychopath', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'scene', 'showing', 'authority', 'work', 'spying', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'enjoying', 'indiscretion', 'motel', 'confrontation', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'ending', 'bullet', 'head', 'just', ""'natural"", 'course', 'just', 'framework', 'scheme', 'will', 'also', 'destroy', 'lover', 'humiliate', 'police', 'judicial', 'system', 'taunts', 'Gosling', 'Nobody', ""'taunts"", 'better', 'Hopkins', 'genteel', 'superiority', 'cockiness', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Gosling', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'complex', ""n't"", 'helped', 'abrupt', 'reversal', 'morality', 'poorly', 'written', 'remarkable', 'job', 'country', 'boy', 'complete', 'southern', 'twang', 'self-centered', 'ruthlessness', 'off-handed', 'charm', '97', '%', 'conviction', 'rate', 'achieved', 'passing', ""'no-win"", 'cases', 'others', 'coldly', 'breaks', 'agreement', 'defense', 'counsel', 'win', 'big', 'case', 'resulting', 'job', 'offer', 'prestigious', 'firm', ""'d"", 'just', 'defeated', 'fast', 'track', 'fact', 'hilt', 'notice', 'D.A', 'office', 'introduced', 'world', ""'big"", 'fees', 'mentor', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'sporting', 'perfect', 'American', 'accent', 'Reluctantly', 'one', 'last', 'assignment', 'arraignment', 'Hopkins', 'will', 'knock', 'well-laid', 'plans', 'completely', 'off-kilter', 'involvement', 'key', 'element', 'Hopkin', 'scheme.While', 'are', 'obvious', 'plot-holes', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'certain', 'Gosling', 'would', 'be', 'DA', 'assigned', 'case', 'cat-and-mouse', 'duel', 'adversaries', 'joy', 'two', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'Fracture', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'involving', 'Hopkins', 'Gosling', 'performances', 'give', 'extra', ""'star"", 'rating']",N/A

Next to Hannibal Lector, I think this is one of Hopkins best roles because he plays such a smart and clever character who shoots his wife and then finds away to get out of being found guilty for it. The movie is a cat-and-mouse chase between Hopkins and Gosling's lawyer who is trying to convict him.Director Gregory Hoblit crafted a solid movie...the best of his movies that I've seen, which include Frequency (2000) and Primal Fear (1996) as well. I think this movie has been under-appreciated. The production design and photography are excellent. And I love Hopkin's home in the movie, the architecture is definitely my taste. It's a blending of modern and asian minimalism with a love of classic crafted materials...much like the movie itself. The acting and chemistry between Hopkins and Gosling are excellent too.

He even surrenders his gun to the police and freely confesses. Better yet the millionaire fool wants to represent himself at thrial. The easiest conviction since Carl Ferguson... Or is Hopkins really a criminal genius in disguise manipulating the system and everything has been according to his plan?A young DA Ryan Gosling (you may remember him from `Murder By Numbers' a much better how'd he do it film but poorly cast.) is moving on up to the East Side. To a deluxe law firm in the sky. All he has to do is wrap up what seems like the easiest case of his career.But problems quickly develop as Hopkins works his magic. The shooting did not happen as assumed. A brilliant mystery for the audience since we witnessed it first hand. Worse the investigating detective was having an affair and infatuated with the victim. It was this affair which led to the shooting.Ryan Gosling becomes obsessed with solving the crime he knows Hopkins committed. Hopkins likewise becomes obsessed with Gosling. Stalking him long after the trial. Fracture is well written with high production quality and a haunting musical score. The plot intrigues the audience with how'd he do it? Especially since we saw it. What could we have seen wrong.The big let down is the climax where Hopkins predictably confesses. I won't spoil it but the solution is anti-climactic. It turns out Hopkins isn't a genius, the cops are just morons. The resolution is also based on the false legal premise of trying someone twice for the same crime. Two separate charges cannot be brought at separate times for the same incident.I did not like Ryan Gosling whom comes across an arrogant young punk. He breaths with his mouth open and has a bad southern accent. Why does Hollywood always have Californians with southern accents? It does not make them Matlock.Spoiler warning!!! The ending is frankly unbelievable for several reasons.1. Cops love guns. Surely the detective would have noticed they both used a Glock 21 .45.2. The detective's finger prints would surely have shown up on Hopkins unused .45.3. Gunpowder leaves a VERY distinctive smell. The detective would have noticed this sent and wondered why his gun smelled like gunpowder if he didn't use it.4. Legal guns are NEVER UNUSED. The manufacturer is required by law to fire at least 2 test shots before it leaves the factory. In some states the manufacturer or dealer MUST give the 2 spent bullets and shells over to law enforcement as a way of entering them into a ballistics' database.5. Hopkins tests negative for gun powder residue because he burns his shirt in his fireplace. The cops surely would have realized the fireplace was used and assumed he used it to destroy evidence.6. Hopkins cannot be tried twice for the same incident any more than OJ Simpson can be tried for trespassing no Nicole's property. The only scenario where this might work is if he were tried in federal court. This is rarely done and only in political hotbeds such as trying Timothy McVeigh in state and federal court.

And the only Hannibal"" I ever knew (from the stories 248-183 BC) that amounted to something, was a Carthaginian who marched his army including elephants into and conquered Rome and occupied it during the First Punic Wars. But this film captured my attention. Maybe it was because I synapsed many of my neurons in earlier years at a practice of medicine, but I had to watch this film four times to finally figure out each piece, i.e., the changing of the handgun, how he did it at the house as he was being arrested and subdued, and a few other parts.I thought for a relative newcomer Ryan Gosling did an extremely good job. Sure, parts of the film were created: the legal issues you had to believe; but other parts of the film were done very well. Anthony Hopkins did a good job as I see it, as an aircraft accident investigator though likely this would be handled in real-life by the NTSB (though a privately-sought rendition could be sought by an interested concern, though they are not inexpensive). The description of the entry wound and he path of the finally resting bullet were accurately described, as well as the residual compromise of the motor and other functions.The ending was not particularly surprising, but I would have like to have seen what was said at opening arguments at the second trial. I suppose that might have diminished the many other legal foibles noted and pointed out already. Altogether, I find this among the top five of the maybe two hundred plus films I have seen this year.

1078889,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000R4SMCW,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","I love watching two people engaged in a mind game, with their subtle attempts at one-upping each other through carefully choreographed manipulation. The chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling in ""Fracture"" is tense, practically thick enough to cut with a knife; their characters play off of each other so well, both with personalities that are intense and restrained at the same time. How appropriate for a film about committing the perfect crime and trying like mad to catch the criminal. What makes this case especially interesting is that the criminal is, physically speaking, within reach. Legally speaking, well, that's another story; the crime was planned and executed with extreme precision, leaving virtually nothing for the legal system to work with.This emphasis on craftiness and personal style made for quite an engrossing experience, made even better by a solid plot and decent performances. Hopkins plays engineer Ted Crawford, a man of considerable control with an eye for exactness (to understand what I mean, watch the scenes featuring his homemade marble contraption). Through discreet observation, he learns that his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), has been having an affair with Officer Rob Nunally (Billy Burke). As one might expect, this is far from acceptable in Crawford's eyes; what's not so expected is how far he'll go in expressing his anger. To show her who's actually in control, he meets her at home and shoots her in the head.Thus begins a seemingly never-ending Cat and Mouse game. Unaware that the crime scene is his lover's home, Nunally arrives to negotiate with Crawford. To everyone's surprise, Crawford confesses, despite the fact that the spent shell casings were wiped clean and that he had already burned his clothing. After being arrested (and physically assaulted by Nunally), it's one legal snag after another: forensic testing concluded that Crawford's gun had never been fired; there were no fingerprints anywhere; Nunally's testimony is useless when his infidelity is made public; Crawford's confession is inadmissible because he was supposedly provoked into giving one. All the cards seem to be stacked in Crawford's favor, and because of that, he decides to represent himself during trial.Here enters Willy Beachum (Gosling), a young Assistant DA assigned as the Prosecution Attorney. There's a quiet desperation about this character; he ambitiously aims for the private sector, which makes the pressure to succeed even greater. One gets the sense that his continuous facial ticks and hand movements are the direct result of his overachievement. He's more flawed than one might be led to believe, especially in his determination to win every case (having a ninety-seven percent success rate sure looks good on a resume). Crawford, being the sly devil he is, picks up on Beachum's personality quirks immediately. This paves the way for a series of conversations that are nothing more than puppetry; Crawford has complete control of both his situation and Beachum. This character is arrogant at a level that's both fascinating and deplorable; continuously being called ""Old Sport"" is enough to drive anyone over the edge.As the film progresses, a series of legal technicalities bring Crawford closer to acquittal. How disappointing for Beachum, who knows--but cannot prove--that Crawford is as guilty as sin. Of course, Crawford knows that Beachum knows, which is why he takes so much pleasure in watching the young attorney fail. If Beachum hopes to get anywhere with the case, he has to produce some evidence, namely the gun that Crawford actually used. But every time the crime scene is searched, nothing is found. Desperate to see his lover's husband get convicted, Nunally tries to convince Beachum to enter false evidence. I won't say whether or not Beachum cracks (pardon the pun); I will say that the odds against him are staggeringly high, meaning he has next to no options left.What I enjoyed most about this film was it's careful attention to character. No one was flat or underdeveloped; just enough is given for the audience to feel emotionally invested. This is especially important for a subplot involving Beachum's relationship with his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). They initially walk on eggshells around each other, the sexual tension overwhelming. When they finally sleep together, I never got the sense that it was an inappropriate inter-office fling. It felt more like a cry for release, each consumed by worlds that are crashing down around them.

1078890,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000R4SMCW,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[15, 22]","With legitimate time wasting movies like ""Perfect Stranger"" out there I feel almost bad about picking on this one, one that I actually liked. But I liked it despite the all too familiar taste on my tongue. Willy (Ryan Gosling) is ready to move on to fame and fortune and Lakers tickets, but first he needs to close just one more case. To make the situation even better for him the case is open and shut; murder weapon, signed confession, so on and so forth. And from there things go predictably downhill. The weapon is no good, the confession is no good, the arresting officer was fornicating with the victim, so on and so forth. The script works the same way a magic trick does where we the audience spend the first half of the film watching it write itself into an airtight box and sink itself to the bottom of the ocean just so that the second half can be spent watching it escape. It is all very tired, of course the writer is smarter than the characters, but there are bits of joy to be taken from this type of story. Really it is just a high gloss version of the slop James Patterson pumps out three times a year. And no I didn't believe any of it for a second, it is pure courtroom fantasy. But I did enjoy the dark sense of humor, its half attempt at an anti-careerist message, and obviously Ryan Gosling. There is nothing here to make you rush out and see it in theaters, and its forthcoming mediocre box office receipts will prove it, but a year from now when it shows up on HBO I say give it a chance.In the opening scene director Gregory Hoblit makes an interesting decision as he goes for a good vs. bad conflict as opposed to a did he vs. didn't he one. There is no doubt in anybody's mind whether or not Ted (Anthony Hopkins) did it because we watch as he shoots her right in the face. So from then on Hoblit is stuck painting Gosling (young) as the hero and Hopkins (Not young) as the murderous husband. That means that even though Ted is the better, more likeable character we have to spend the movie pretending to root for Willy. To make this happen the writers stack the deck in his favor, he won't cheat to win the case, he turns to a selfless public servant for help and he has some sexual tension going on with a decent looking blond. Never mind that the real Willy would never do any of these things. As far as his romantic interest goes it is interesting that it isn't developed further, just kind of hinted at and then abandoned. Because if ""300"" has taught us anything it is that girls will accompany their boyfriends to any movie, no matter how stupid, so long as the producers throw in a half-baked love story to pacify them. For a while it looked as though the film was going to have to choose between the morality of bringing down the wife's shooter and this ""don't go corporate"" message that they seemed to want to spread. Of course if you have ever seen a Hollywood movie I am giving nothing away by saying that have and eat their cake. Which is fine, I forgive them. I also forgive them for this weak third act that is dragged out to provide the cliffhangers and easy resolutions that keep the masses coming back for more. I forgive mainly because Gosling is so good here. A pay check movie this is indeed, but he has charisma to spare and isn't afraid to share it. If it weren't for his girly-man choices thus far in his career he would be a full blown movie right now. But alas, he doesn't really do movies that involve him shooting a gun and hence the fact that most Americans don't know him. But hopefully people will see him here and when they do they will enjoy themselves with this light weight yet engrossing film. ***1/4",3,The Tale of Willy the Ambitious,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,3662,"['legitimate', 'time', 'wasting', 'movies', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'there', 'feel', 'almost', 'bad', 'picking', 'one', 'one', 'actually', 'liked', 'liked', 'too', 'familiar', 'taste', 'tongue', 'Willy', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'ready', 'move', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Lakers', 'tickets', 'first', 'close', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'case', 'make', 'situation', 'even', 'better', 'case', 'open', 'shut', 'murder', 'weapon', 'signed', 'confession', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'things', 'go', 'predictably', 'downhill', 'weapon', 'good', 'confession', 'good', 'arresting', 'officer', 'was', 'fornicating', 'victim', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'script', 'same', 'way', 'magic', 'trick', 'where', 'audience', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'watching', 'write', 'airtight', 'box', 'sink', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'just', 'so', 'second', 'half', 'can', 'be', 'spent', 'watching', 'escape', 'very', 'tired', 'course', 'writer', 'smarter', 'characters', 'are', 'bits', 'joy', 'be', 'taken', 'type', 'story', 'Really', 'just', 'high', 'gloss', 'version', 'slop', 'James', 'Patterson', 'pumps', 'out', 'three', 'times', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'pure', 'courtroom', 'fantasy', 'did', 'enjoy', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'half', 'attempt', 'anti-careerist', 'message', 'obviously', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'rush', 'out', 'see', 'theaters', 'forthcoming', 'mediocre', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'will', 'prove', 'year', 'now', 'when', 'up', 'HBO', 'say', 'give', 'chance.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'interesting', 'decision', 'good', 'vs.', 'bad', 'conflict', 'opposed', 'did', 'vs.', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'doubt', 'anybody', 'mind', 'not', 'Ted', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'did', 'watch', 'right', 'face', 'So', 'then', 'Hoblit', 'stuck', 'painting', 'Gosling', 'young', 'hero', 'Hopkins', 'Not', 'young', 'murderous', 'husband', 'even', 'Ted', 'better', 'more', 'likeable', 'character', 'have', 'spend', 'movie', 'pretending', 'root', 'Willy', 'make', 'happen', 'writers', 'stack', 'deck', 'favor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'win', 'case', 'selfless', 'public', 'servant', 'help', 'sexual', 'tension', 'going', 'decent', 'looking', 'blond', 'mind', 'real', 'Willy', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'things', 'As', 'far', 'romantic', 'interest', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'developed', 'further', 'just', 'kind', 'hinted', 'then', 'abandoned', '300', 'taught', 'anything', 'girls', 'will', 'accompany', 'boyfriends', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'stupid', 'so', 'long', 'producers', 'throw', 'half-baked', 'love', 'story', 'pacify', 'while', 'looked', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'choose', 'morality', 'bringing', 'down', 'wife', 'shooter', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'corporate', 'message', 'seemed', 'want', 'spread', 'course', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'am', 'giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'saying', 'have', 'eat', 'cake', 'Which', 'fine', 'forgive', 'also', 'forgive', 'weak', 'third', 'act', 'dragged', 'out', 'provide', 'cliffhangers', 'easy', 'resolutions', 'keep', 'masses', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'forgive', 'mainly', 'Gosling', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'pay', 'check', 'movie', 'indeed', 'charisma', 'spare', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'share', 'were', ""n't"", 'girly-man', 'choices', 'thus', 'far', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'blown', 'movie', 'right', 'now', 'alas', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'movies', 'involve', 'shooting', 'gun', 'hence', 'fact', 'most', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hopefully', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'here', 'when', 'do', 'will', 'enjoy', 'light', 'weight', 'yet', 'engrossing', 'film', '***1/4']",N/A

1078892,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B000R4SMCW,Christopher Engel,"[7, 12]","What starts off as a decent legal thriller with all Anthony Hopkins has to offer being portrayed on screen outsmarting an idiot of a prosecutor ends in the most unsatisfying way imaginable. Everything works exactly as Hopkins plans, until the mind-bogglingly bad ending that fails on a multitude of levels. First of all, the ""evidence"" the prosecutor obtains would never, ever, EVER be allowed in court. It would be so illegal as to make Hopkins look even more not guilty with a simple denial that the prosecutor is correct at such a useless and circumstantial claim. The prosecutor, in a frenzy of idiocy, visits Hopkins in his own home (this alone is bad enough, but it gets far worse) for a confession. Not only is what Hopkins' alleged slip-up not admissible in court in any form, but what he forces from him for a crime *that he did not commit* is a public confession out of nothing but boasting, but even then, the hero would lose here in the real world. The prosecutor does absolutely nothing for his case the entire way through, and the legal system is shot in the head just as badly as the victim in the whole case. Basic legal rules are completely ignored, the ""twist"" ending is insensible, stupid, and impossible, and everything is just ruined completely by it. Hopkins would win this if the movie played by the rules, but it doesn't when it means the most, making the whole thing totally pointless.To make everything infinitely worse, the Double Jeopardy rule that Hopkins takes advantage of is not disproven like the prosecutor says. Hero Prosecutor gets around the Double Jeopardy rule with a charge that would never hold up, because the fact is, he didn't do what the prosecutor said he did. He did not directly cause his wife's death, so everything used to charge him with murder is simply false. He's charged with one thing, found innocent, and then the prosecutor ""turns the tables"" and finds him guilty of a more serious crime--one he actually didn't do, so he could get around the Double Jeopardy rule.It gets even worse. The Double Jeopardy rule isn't even used correctly here. Double Jeopardy doesn't simply mean you can't be charged for the same crime twice. The twist here is that Hopkins is charged and tried with one thing, and then again with another. But the two crimes he's charged with could not be treated as separate crimes, even if it were the case that he were guilty of the second that he gets caught on.And yes, it gets even worse than that. When Hopkins' wife ultimately dies, it's *through legal means*. This is where everything falls so far apart, the title starts to make sense in the context of the story. When he's doing his thing, what he's doing is legal. He has legal free reign over whether or not they maintain life support. He didn't do anything illegal when he asks them to pull the plug. There is no murder charge possible here. He has every right to do what he did, whether or not people agree with it. No illegal action was taking place--Hopkins, at that point, is a free man, with no charges against him. Just because he tells a doctor to pull the plug on his wife doesn't make him a murderer in any way. He did not cause her death, and even if he did, it was legal. It's not like he snuck into the hospital and shot her again. All he did was fill out a form and make a formal request. That's legal. There is no possible murder charge like the film uses to throw him off his guard, since he didn't murder his wife. Period.So, unless legal thrillers with no sense or basis in reality interest you, this just isn't worth it. Maybe catch it on TV just to watch Hopkins look smug, but don't bother even renting it. It's just too out-of-touch with reality to be worth anything meaningful.Extremely disappointing conclusion to an otherwise decent legal thriller.",1,A decent film ruined by an impossible ending.,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3809,"['What', 'off', 'decent', 'legal', 'thriller', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'offer', 'being', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'outsmarting', 'idiot', 'prosecutor', 'most', 'unsatisfying', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Everything', 'exactly', 'Hopkins', 'mind-bogglingly', 'bad', 'ending', 'multitude', 'levels', 'First', 'all', 'evidence', 'prosecutor', 'obtains', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'EVER', 'be', 'allowed', 'court', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'illegal', 'make', 'Hopkins', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'guilty', 'simple', 'denial', 'prosecutor', 'correct', 'useless', 'circumstantial', 'claim', 'prosecutor', 'frenzy', 'idiocy', 'visits', 'Hopkins', 'own', 'home', 'alone', 'bad', 'enough', 'far', 'worse', 'confession', 'Not', 'only', 'what', 'Hopkins', 'alleged', 'slip-up', 'not', 'admissible', 'court', 'form', 'what', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit*', 'public', 'confession', 'nothing', 'boasting', 'even', 'then', 'hero', 'would', 'lose', 'here', 'real', 'world', 'prosecutor', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'case', 'entire', 'way', 'legal', 'system', 'shot', 'head', 'just', 'as', 'badly', 'victim', 'whole', 'case', 'Basic', 'legal', 'rules', 'are', 'completely', 'ignored', 'twist', 'ending', 'insensible', 'stupid', 'impossible', 'everything', 'just', 'ruined', 'completely', 'Hopkins', 'would', 'win', 'movie', 'played', 'rules', ""n't"", 'when', 'most', 'making', 'whole', 'thing', 'totally', 'pointless.To', 'make', 'everything', 'infinitely', 'worse', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'rule', 'Hopkins', 'advantage', 'not', 'disproven', 'prosecutor', 'Hero', 'Prosecutor', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'rule', 'charge', 'would', 'never', 'hold', 'up', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'prosecutor', 'said', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'directly', 'cause', 'wife', 'death', 'everything', 'used', 'charge', 'murder', 'simply', 'false', 'charged', 'one', 'thing', 'found', 'innocent', 'then', 'prosecutor', 'tables', 'guilty', 'more', 'serious', 'crime', 'one', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'could', 'get', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'rule.It', 'even', 'worse', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'rule', ""n't"", 'even', 'used', 'correctly', 'here', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', ""n't"", 'simply', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'charged', 'same', 'crime', 'twice', 'twist', 'here', 'Hopkins', 'charged', 'tried', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'again', 'two', 'crimes', 'charged', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'treated', 'separate', 'crimes', 'even', 'were', 'case', 'were', 'guilty', 'second', 'caught', 'on.And', 'yes', 'even', 'worse', 'When', 'Hopkins', 'wife', 'ultimately', '*through', 'legal', 'means*', 'where', 'everything', 'so', 'far', 'apart', 'title', 'make', 'sense', 'context', 'story', 'When', 'doing', 'thing', 'what', 'doing', 'legal', 'legal', 'free', 'reign', 'not', 'maintain', 'life', 'support', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'illegal', 'when', 'pull', 'plug', 'murder', 'charge', 'possible', 'here', 'right', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'people', 'agree', 'illegal', 'action', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'point', 'free', 'man', 'charges', 'Just', 'doctor', 'pull', 'plug', 'wife', ""n't"", 'make', 'murderer', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'cause', 'death', 'even', 'did', 'was', 'legal', 'not', 'snuck', 'hospital', 'shot', 'again', 'did', 'was', 'fill', 'out', 'form', 'make', 'formal', 'request', 'legal', 'possible', 'murder', 'charge', 'film', 'throw', 'off', 'guard', 'did', ""n't"", 'murder', 'wife', 'Period.So', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'sense', 'basis', 'reality', 'interest', 'just', ""n't"", 'worth', 'Maybe', 'catch', 'TV', 'just', 'watch', 'Hopkins', 'look', 'smug', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'even', 'renting', 'just', 'too', 'out-of-touch', 'reality', 'be', 'worth', 'anything', 'meaningful.Extremely', 'disappointing', 'conclusion', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'legal', 'thriller']",N/A

Hopkins knows this, of course, and plays on his vanity.Gosling evolves from a me-only lawyer to someone who really wants justice, even if it costs him. Both characters are cocky and smart and the twists and turns just add to the fun.I enjoyed watching all the actors performances and was very impressed. The camera-work by Director Of Photography Kramer Morgenthau should also be recognized, along with director Gregory Hoblit, who seems to direct very entertaining films (""Frequency,"" ""Fallen,"" etc.)I could have watched this story unfold for another two hours and would have been happy to do so, am I'm not one to sit still for long periods these days.

1078903,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000R4SMCW,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 4]","""Primal Fear"" director, Gregory Hoblit's legal cat and mouse game between veteran actor Anthony Hopkins and promising newcomer Ryan Gosling could have been a psychological thriller of Hitchcockian proportions, but to many fissures in either the editing phase or the overall concept make this ""Fracture"" borderline abysmal.Like a kaleidoscope, all the elements exist and combine to create a shimmering bent-ray look into the perfect crime.  From the onset, the audience comprehends fully that Crawford (Hopkins) killed his adulterous wife and somehow perhaps because in this role Hopkins perfects and tempers with a knowing sadness that familiar megalomaniacal ingeniousness spawned during his Academy Award winning enactment of Hannibal Lector we empathize with Pavlovian fascination, wishing with all of our might that Crawford beats the rap in spite of the wrongness of his transgression.If Hannibal Lector suggests the sophisticated power of a warped mind, the character of Crawford explores similar territory.  In Hopkins deft hands, Crawford smolders with nuance that begs to be investigated.  We know Crawford is riddled with fractures---fractures from his childhood, his adult past and his obviously failed marriage.  The incidentals need not be detailed; the beauty of Hopkin's performance makes disclosure unnecessary.Like Lector, Crawford simply is and he's got the high-dollar items to back up and accentuate his success on various mind and achievement levels.  As head of his own aerodynamics company, his organized mind can see and arrange the components of his life from the perspective of a higher vantage point--- his accoutrements illicit an affluent privacy: he lives in a gate-contained cushy California crib, drives a fantastic sports car, tinkers with magnificent Rube Goldberg contraptions (kudos to Dutch artist Mark Bischoff) and possesses an off-the-chart IQ for which any Mensa might, well, kill.  Unfortunately, one of his acquisitions isn't going along with the program; wife Jennifer has set up house with her police inspector boyfriend.  Within the first five minutes of the film, Crawford takes care of this blot on his brand of perfection with a quick bullet to her brain, rendering her comatose.Enter the perfect rub, public defender-protagonist, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling).  Young and hungry, Will is about to shun his inbred liberal/Democrat/socialistic values and embrace ""the dark side""---accepting a position with a posh-y firm the type of which caused Will Shakespeare to utter in Henry VI, ""Let's kill all the lawyers.""  Older and wiser Crawford immediately sizes up his competition as being distracted by his imminent career transition and the open and shut case that the DA expects disintegrates into an entertaining farce where Crawford maintains the upper hand with a most sadistic yet unassuming calmness that belies the partial deadness of the soul beneath. Gosling needs to regroup fast before he puts a permanent blot on his win-only record and blows his chances for his greed driven dreams.The script's overall concentration on Gosling's character unfortunately falls prey to many of Hollywood's formulaic pitfalls.  Hoblit should have emulated great suspense thrillers like ""Deathtrap"" or ""Sleuth"" and left out characters that do little to enhance the plot.  In this instance, ice blonde Rosamund Pike as Gosling's new boss becomes merely an ornament decorating Gosling's roguish manliness rather than a personality important to driving the plot.  Her family reiterates the socialist message while they sip expensive wine during Thanksgiving dinner that anyone with a mindset slightly akin to ""Wall Street's"" Gordon Gekko condones and enables Big Corporate Evil.  But none of that has anything to do with the intricate mind game that could have been played and relished by the two main characters.Likewise the plot's loose ends eventually tarnish the film's trite outcome.  I suppose the concentration on the poorly constructed subplots distracts the audience from fully analyzing some of the hints, snafus and gaffs but do not create enough background noise to stop one from realizing that the lover's compromising of the evidence on the Crawford property and at the crime lab would have provided Crawford with yet another interesting gambit to play.Bottom line:  In true Hollywood fashion, the film's ultimate significance lies in some unwanted political message about big business versus social awareness rather than the ultimate mind game that it purports to be.  The film entertains and generates conversation, but its structural fractures downplay the interplay between minds that this reviewer would have found much more satisfying.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Flawed Fracture,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,4725,"['Primal', 'Fear', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'legal', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'promising', 'newcomer', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Hitchcockian', 'proportions', 'many', 'fissures', 'editing', 'phase', 'overall', 'concept', 'make', 'Fracture', 'borderline', 'kaleidoscope', 'elements', 'exist', 'combine', 'create', 'shimmering', 'bent-ray', 'look', 'perfect', 'crime', 'onset', 'audience', 'fully', 'Crawford', 'Hopkins', 'killed', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'somehow', 'perhaps', 'role', 'perfects', 'tempers', 'knowing', 'sadness', 'familiar', 'megalomaniacal', 'ingeniousness', 'spawned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'enactment', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'empathize', 'Pavlovian', 'fascination', 'wishing', 'might', 'Crawford', 'rap', 'spite', 'wrongness', 'transgression.If', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'sophisticated', 'power', 'warped', 'mind', 'character', 'Crawford', 'similar', 'territory', 'Hopkins', 'deft', 'hands', 'Crawford', 'nuance', 'be', 'investigated', 'know', 'Crawford', 'riddled', 'fractures', '-fractures', 'childhood', 'adult', 'past', 'obviously', 'failed', 'marriage', 'incidentals', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'detailed', 'beauty', 'Hopkin', 'performance', 'disclosure', 'unnecessary.Like', 'Lector', 'Crawford', 'simply', 'got', 'high-dollar', 'items', 'back', 'up', 'accentuate', 'success', 'various', 'mind', 'achievement', 'levels', 'head', 'own', 'aerodynamics', 'company', 'organized', 'mind', 'can', 'see', 'arrange', 'components', 'life', 'perspective', 'higher', 'vantage', 'point', 'accoutrements', 'illicit', 'affluent', 'privacy', 'gate-contained', 'cushy', 'California', 'crib', 'fantastic', 'sports', 'car', 'tinkers', 'magnificent', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'contraptions', 'kudos', 'Dutch', 'artist', 'Mark', 'Bischoff', 'off-the-chart', 'IQ', 'Mensa', 'might', 'well', 'kill', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'acquisitions', ""n't"", 'going', 'along', 'program', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'set', 'up', 'house', 'police', 'inspector', 'boyfriend', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'Crawford', 'care', 'blot', 'brand', 'perfection', 'quick', 'bullet', 'brain', 'rendering', 'comatose.Enter', 'perfect', 'rub', 'public', 'defender-protagonist', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Young', 'hungry', 'Will', 'shun', 'inbred', 'liberal/Democrat/socialistic', 'values', 'embrace', 'dark', 'side', '-accepting', 'position', 'posh-y', 'firm', 'type', 'caused', 'Will', 'Shakespeare', 'utter', 'Henry', 'VI', 'Let', 'kill', 'lawyers', 'Older', 'wiser', 'Crawford', 'immediately', 'up', 'competition', 'being', 'distracted', 'imminent', 'career', 'transition', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'DA', 'entertaining', 'farce', 'where', 'Crawford', 'upper', 'hand', 'most', 'sadistic', 'yet', 'unassuming', 'calmness', 'partial', 'deadness', 'soul', 'beneath', 'Gosling', 'needs', 'regroup', 'fast', 'permanent', 'blot', 'win-only', 'record', 'chances', 'greed', 'dreams.The', 'script', 'overall', 'concentration', 'Gosling', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'prey', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'formulaic', 'pitfalls', 'Hoblit', 'should', 'have', 'emulated', 'great', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'Deathtrap', 'Sleuth', 'left', 'out', 'characters', 'do', 'little', 'enhance', 'plot', 'instance', 'ice', 'blonde', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Gosling', 'new', 'boss', 'merely', 'ornament', 'decorating', 'Gosling', 'roguish', 'manliness', 'rather', 'personality', 'important', 'driving', 'plot', 'family', 'socialist', 'message', 'sip', 'expensive', 'wine', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'anyone', 'mindset', 'slightly', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'condones', 'Big', 'Corporate', 'Evil', 'none', 'anything', 'do', 'intricate', 'mind', 'game', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'relished', 'two', 'main', 'characters.Likewise', 'plot', 'loose', 'ends', 'eventually', 'tarnish', 'film', 'trite', 'outcome', 'suppose', 'concentration', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'subplots', 'audience', 'fully', 'analyzing', 'hints', 'snafus', 'gaffs', 'do', 'not', 'create', 'enough', 'background', 'noise', 'stop', 'one', 'realizing', 'lover', 'compromising', 'evidence', 'Crawford', 'property', 'crime', 'lab', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'Crawford', 'yet', 'interesting', 'gambit', 'play.Bottom', 'line', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'film', 'ultimate', 'significance', 'unwanted', 'political', 'message', 'big', 'business', 'social', 'awareness', 'rather', 'ultimate', 'mind', 'game', 'be', 'film', 'entertains', 'generates', 'conversation', 'structural', 'fractures', 'downplay', 'interplay', 'minds', 'reviewer', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",N/A

I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed.The acting and the characterization is fantastic. Every character has emotional depth, and at one point or another through the film you both love and hate something about each one of them. The good guys aren't totally good, and the bad guys aren't totally bad, and I find that to be all to rare these days.Storywise, despite what some have said, there are no continuity flaws. In the opening scene of the movie, Anthony Hopkins's character is seen making a call from a payphone to verify when the particular detective is on-duty, and he makes sure that officer is the one who he invites inside his house after the shooting occurs. I don't see anything implausible about that.This legal thriller can't help but remind me of my favorite legal thriller, The Firm. While Fracture is not AS intense, as life-or-death, as edge-of-your-seat as The Firm, I still found it highly enjoyable with no complaints. And it is indeed rare for me to go to a movie these days without at least a few complaints.Hopkins plays this character brilliantly, and despite what others may say, I do not feel that it is just a rip off of Hannibal Lecter. There are more differences than there are similarities, although both can certainly be creepy characters.Overall this is truly a good movie, focusing on the moral dilemma between right and wrong, and in discovering whether one's own morals are on the right side in the process.Very rarely do I purchase movies on DVD, or even watch any movie a second time, but this one is on my to-buy list.

1078915,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000R4SMCW,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There's a familiar bag of tricks at work in this 2007 courtroom-driven suspense thriller, and it goes beyond Anthony Hopkins' deliberate echo of Hannibal Lecter in his malevolently amusing performance as Ted Crawford, a wealthy and cuckolded industrial engineer. It involves the intricately plotted, marginally credible screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers, which reminds me of an old episode ofColumbo. That's not necessarily a bad thing since those Sunday night shows could be entertaining whodunits, but the derivative veneer of this movie purposefully shortchanges logic for contrived twists. In fact, the central conceit of the film is that we know Crawford shot his beautiful, adulterous wife point blank. The story is really about how he plans to get away with it and how young Willie Beachum, an ambitious and unflagging assistant D.A. bucks the odds and seeks the truth in this case.Giving away any more is unnecessary, as director Gregory Hoblit is no stranger to the courtroom giving us the equally twist-infestedPrimal Feareleven years ago. While the twists are not as pronounced here, they also don't feel as hard-earned primarily because Crawford and Beachum feel more like movie archetypes than flesh-and-blood characters. This is where casting helps considerably since Hopkins can easily evince menace with minimal effort - a blank stare, veiled smirk, the delusion of befuddlement in the courtroom - before you can sayThe Silence of the Lambs. Impressive in last year'sHalf Nelson, Ryan Gosling plays Beachum in a likeably braggadocio manner with a heavy Southern accent and a variety of idiosyncratic tics. It is his character that goes through something of an arc from accepting a high-paying job at an exclusive private firm to a personal catharsis over his crusade for justice.The two principal actors are well matched in their scenes together, even though one is a virtual replay of the one between Hopkins and Jodie Foster inLambs. The rest of the actors aren't given much leeway to provide any meaningful depth to their characters - David Strathairn, in a complete role reversal from this year'sBourne Ultimatum, as Beachum's moral conscience and current boss, D.A. Joe Labruto; Billy Burke particularly lackluster as the indiscreet detective caught in the middle; Embeth Davidtz making her precious few moments count as Crawford's dissatisfied wife Jennifer; and former Bond girl Rosamund Pike as Nikki Gardner, Beachum's boss at his new firm. Her romantic relationship with Beachum seems like a particularly absurd plot convenience given the impropriety of a senior partner bedding an associate.The twisty ending satisfies for the obvious reason but is tethered in legal precedents that seem strangely arbitrary (pardon the pun). As part of its set of extras, the 2007 DVD contains two alternatives to the final ending, both making the inevitable a more Baroque-level experience that borders on silly. The other deleted scenes are of marginal interest including two extended variations on the romantic coupling between Gardner and Beachum. While a trailer is included, there is surprisingly no commentary track from either the director or the two principals. For what it's worth, the film is a fun ride for the undemanding because a moment's thought afterward will inevitably spoil your memory of it.",3,Overly Tricky Plot Makes for Glib Entertainment Thanks Mainly to the Two Leads,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3330,"['familiar', 'bag', 'tricks', 'work', '2007', 'courtroom-driven', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'deliberate', 'echo', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'malevolently', 'amusing', 'performance', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'wealthy', 'cuckolded', 'industrial', 'engineer', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'marginally', 'credible', 'screenplay', 'Daniel', 'Pyne', 'Glenn', 'Gers', 'old', 'episode', 'ofColumbo', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Sunday', 'night', 'shows', 'could', 'be', 'entertaining', 'whodunits', 'derivative', 'veneer', 'movie', 'purposefully', 'logic', 'contrived', 'twists', 'fact', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'know', 'Crawford', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'point', 'blank', 'story', 'really', 'how', 'get', 'away', 'how', 'young', 'Willie', 'Beachum', 'ambitious', 'unflagging', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'odds', 'truth', 'case.Giving', 'away', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'stranger', 'courtroom', 'giving', 'equally', 'twist-infestedPrimal', 'Feareleven', 'years', 'ago', 'twists', 'are', 'not', 'pronounced', 'here', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hard-earned', 'primarily', 'Crawford', 'Beachum', 'feel', 'more', 'movie', 'archetypes', 'flesh-and-blood', 'characters', 'where', 'casting', 'considerably', 'Hopkins', 'can', 'easily', 'evince', 'menace', 'minimal', 'effort', 'blank', 'stare', 'veiled', 'smirk', 'delusion', 'befuddlement', 'courtroom', 'can', 'sayThe', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Impressive', 'last', ""year'sHalf"", 'Nelson', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Beachum', 'likeably', 'braggadocio', 'manner', 'heavy', 'Southern', 'accent', 'variety', 'idiosyncratic', 'tics', 'character', 'something', 'arc', 'accepting', 'high-paying', 'job', 'exclusive', 'private', 'firm', 'personal', 'catharsis', 'crusade', 'justice.The', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'matched', 'scenes', 'together', 'even', 'one', 'virtual', 'replay', 'one', 'Hopkins', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'inLambs', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'leeway', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'depth', 'characters', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'complete', 'role', 'reversal', ""year'sBourne"", 'Ultimatum', 'Beachum', 'moral', 'conscience', 'current', 'boss', 'D.A', 'Joe', 'Labruto', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'particularly', 'lackluster', 'indiscreet', 'detective', 'caught', 'middle', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'making', 'precious', 'few', 'moments', 'count', 'Crawford', 'dissatisfied', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'former', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Nikki', 'Gardner', 'Beachum', 'boss', 'new', 'firm', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Beachum', 'particularly', 'absurd', 'plot', 'convenience', 'given', 'impropriety', 'senior', 'partner', 'bedding', 'associate.The', 'twisty', 'ending', 'satisfies', 'obvious', 'reason', 'tethered', 'legal', 'precedents', 'seem', 'strangely', 'arbitrary', 'pardon', 'pun', 'part', 'set', 'extras', '2007', 'DVD', 'two', 'alternatives', 'final', 'ending', 'making', 'inevitable', 'more', 'Baroque-level', 'experience', 'borders', 'silly', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'marginal', 'interest', 'including', 'two', 'extended', 'variations', 'romantic', 'coupling', 'Gardner', 'Beachum', 'trailer', 'included', 'surprisingly', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'two', 'principals', 'what', 'worth', 'film', 'fun', 'ride', 'undemanding', 'moment', 'thought', 'afterward', 'will', 'inevitably', 'spoil', 'memory']",N/A

I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of ""Fracture"" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his ""playful Dr. Lector"" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. ""Fracture"" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found ""Fracture"" quite good.3.5/5",3,"Willy Beachum: ""I'm not going to play any games with you.""

But despite this the movie suffers from a script that fails to keep that secret that would make the story work: most viewers will be able to figure out the `mystery' far before its discovery poses the end of the film.Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is an older wealthy man married for a year to a younger beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and happens to spy on her with her current paramour, detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke), confronts her at home and shoots her in the face with the intention of killing her.  But of course she is not dead: she is in a vegetative state in a hospital ICU by the next frame.  Meanwhile a young lawyer Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) while working for the District Attorney office with Joe Labruto (David Strathairn) sniffs that all is not right with the case while at the same time vying his career choices with transferring to a law firm under the eye of Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike).  Willy is assigned to prosecute Crawford, but Crawford, defending himself, is acquitted because the murder weapon (gun) cannot be produced.  THAT is the mystery: what happened to the needed evidence?  The remainder of the story is how Willy solves the case and while most people will have figured it out, revealing it in a review robs potential viewers from the cat and mouse game the film is supposed to be.Both Hopkins and Gosling are superb, even with a script that is weak, and simply watching them perform is reason enough to see the film.  The sets and filming are also fascinating and the pacing of the movie is satisfyingly tense.  With a bit more imagination the story could have worked better. The `stars rating' is for the Stars!

Entertaining with excellent acting and even though you may be able to figure out the ""twist"", it won't take away from your enjoyment of it.This legal thriller presents an extremely intelligent husband (Hopkins), who has just attempted to murder his wife, shooting her in the head for having an affair, pitted against the young, hot-shot lawyer (Gosling).  Gosling is on his way out of the DA's office for a more lucrative job in corporate law, but, Gosling's character takes on the prosecution against Hopkin's character because apparently Hopkins has signed his own confession to murdering his wife and Gosling feels it is a quick open and shut case.What appears to be an open and shut case for Gosling turns anything but.  The man who was having an affair with the wife just happens to be the arresting officer when Hopkin's character was taken into custody throwing a monkey wrench into the works.  Hopkins has a field day with Gosling's character because he was unprepared to see past the possibility of being played.  Any more comment about this could give away spoilers.Gosling's character is purposely hard to root for at the beginning, but by mid movie you will be rooting for him.  Hopkin's character, who you may be laughing with a couple of times, eventually is presented as the maniacal killer he is just as you are rooting for Gosling's character.*****The Bottom Line*****For those who buy only those movies that they would watch more than once, then this is an entertaining movie and should be a part of your collection.Hopkins is always excellent and Gosling plays his part extremely well.

He's just there and actually doesn't talk that much.Anthony Hopkins is good, as always, playing a creepy old brilliant nut who kills his promiscuous wife and calculatingly removes any evidence linking him to the murder.  Unfortunately there isn't much to work with because he has very few scenes in which the director allows him to talk.  Everybody sort of stands there and nods.My disgust with the film grew to such a ferocious pitch that I began to enjoy Hopkins' tooling around with Gosling's colorless character.  His wife, who spends most of the movie in a vegetative state, is more enthralling than the people who are conscious and walking around.Maybe this is a real thrill for those in law school, but for my part I can't imagine why a director would take two tremendous actors and waste them so badly.Zzzz...",1,Bad--really bad,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1358,"['Fracture', 'kind', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', ""'ve"", 'become', 'resigned', 'merely', 'being', 'entertained', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'require', 'little', 'bit', 'motion', 'screen', 'capture', 'keep', 'attention', 'agonizing', 'two', 'hours', 'film.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'almost', 'decent', 'DA', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'really', 'macho', 'chin', 'ups', 'bar', 'lawyer', 'terrible', 'court', 'charming', 'few', 'women', 'once', 'awhile', 'etc', 'point', 'character', 'cohere', 'anything', 'believable', 'orinteresting', 'just', 'there', 'actually', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'good', 'always', 'playing', 'creepy', 'old', 'brilliant', 'nut', 'who', 'promiscuous', 'wife', 'calculatingly', 'evidence', 'linking', 'murder', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'work', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'director', 'talk', 'Everybody', 'sort', 'stands', 'nods.My', 'disgust', 'film', 'grew', 'such', 'ferocious', 'pitch', 'began', 'enjoy', 'Hopkins', 'tooling', 'Gosling', 'colorless', 'character', 'wife', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'vegetative', 'state', 'more', 'enthralling', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'conscious', 'walking', 'around.Maybe', 'real', 'thrill', 'law', 'school', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'director', 'would', 'take', 'two', 'tremendous', 'actors', 'waste', 'so', 'badly.Zzzz']",N/A

1078952,A8MRMHTVRJFVU,B000R4SMCW,Jo Stanford,"[2, 3]","Since I am both a lover of psychological thrillers and a fan of Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, it would be nearly impossible for me not to like this film, Fracture. And I was not disappointed. Though I would agree with some of the reviewers that Ryan's character Willy Beachum was not particularly likeable at first, I would disagree that he was as bad as Anthony's character, Ted Crawford. After all, Willy is cocky and ambitious, Ted is arrogant AND a cold-blooded killer. Willy though flippant, and perhaps a little arrogant, hardly comes off as someone who would shoot their wife point-blank in the face.Ted's machinations occur from the beginning. In the very first scene, he tells his wife, ""I love you,"" and in the next minute shoots her in the face. And every step he takes after that is carefully designed to outwit everyone from the cops to the prosecutor to even the judge. It's this maneuvering by Ted that makes the film worth seeing. Everybody knows he did it -- but is he that smart, that conniving that he will get away with the perfect murder?That's where Willy comes in. From the beginning, he underestimates Ted. Pre-occupied with starting a new, lucrative job, Willy thinks he has an open and shut case and gives it very little attention. In fact, when he first visits the crime scene with the police, he is on the phone with his soon-to-be employer trying to decide how he wants his new office decorated. Well, he gets totally humiliated at the trial by Ted and things go downhill from there.The movie, though not heart-pounding, keeps your interest. Noteworthy performances are given by the rest of the cast. David Strathairn plays Willy's boss, the hard-boiled, but with soft edges, head of the district attorney office. Embeth Davidtz' talent is wasted as the wife, as she is comatose for most of the movie. Rosamund Pike plays a ruthless lawyer and Willy's brief love interest. Pike actually is more dislikeable than Willy as she embodies all the things we hate about lawyers. In one scene she chastises Willy that it's not about convicting a killer, but it's more important that you ""can do as you're told.""The most unbelievable character I think was the police officer (Billy Burke) who had an affair with Ted's wife which precipitates the whole chain of events. He comes off as a lovesick dolt. What cop would have an affair with a woman and not know her real name? He, more than anyone,  has the resources to find out someone's identity. But for the plot to work, perhaps him not knowing her name is essential and I guess we can forgive the movie this test of our common sense.The movie has good character development -- at least for Willy. He goes from a flippant, all-about-me persona to someone who actually cares about the victim and bringing her assaulter to justice. The plot may be somewhat predictable, but the main method Ted uses to get away with the crime was a surprise to me. The dialogue is good, especially Ted whose every word is calculating and clever. Throughout the movie, he taunts everyone with his superior cleverness but eventually forgets his own earlier message to Willy.The title ""Fracture"" is the movie's subtle message. Early on, Ted makes a comment that, ""If you look closely enough, you'll find that everything has a weak spot where it can break."" And that's what Ted is good at throughout the movie, finding people's weak spot and using it to his advantage. But what Ted doesn't seem to comprehend, is that he too has a weak spot and it will be his undoing, his fatal flaw.",4,Nearly Impossible For Me Not To Like This Film,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,3536,"['am', 'lover', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'fan', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'Fracture', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'would', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'Ryan', 'character', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'first', 'would', 'disagree', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Anthony', 'character', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'Willy', 'cocky', 'ambitious', 'Ted', 'arrogant', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'Willy', 'flippant', 'perhaps', 'little', 'arrogant', 'hardly', 'off', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'shoot', 'wife', 'point-blank', 'face.Ted', 'machinations', 'occur', 'beginning', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'wife', 'love', 'next', 'minute', 'shoots', 'face', 'step', 'carefully', 'designed', 'outwit', 'everyone', 'cops', 'prosecutor', 'even', 'judge', 'maneuvering', 'Ted', 'film', 'seeing', 'Everybody', 'did', 'smart', 'conniving', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'perfect', 'murder', 'where', 'Willy', 'beginning', 'Ted', 'Pre-occupied', 'starting', 'new', 'lucrative', 'job', 'Willy', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'very', 'little', 'attention', 'fact', 'when', 'first', 'crime', 'scene', 'police', 'phone', 'soon-to-be', 'employer', 'trying', 'decide', 'how', 'new', 'office', 'decorated', 'Well', 'totally', 'humiliated', 'trial', 'Ted', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there.The', 'movie', 'not', 'heart-pounding', 'keeps', 'interest', 'Noteworthy', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'rest', 'cast', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Willy', 'boss', 'hard-boiled', 'soft', 'edges', 'head', 'district', 'attorney', 'office', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'talent', 'wasted', 'wife', 'comatose', 'most', 'movie', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'ruthless', 'lawyer', 'Willy', 'brief', 'love', 'interest', 'Pike', 'actually', 'more', 'dislikeable', 'Willy', 'things', 'hate', 'lawyers', 'one', 'scene', 'Willy', 'not', 'convicting', 'killer', 'more', 'important', 'can', 'do', ""'re"", 'told', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'think', 'was', 'police', 'officer', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'Ted', 'wife', 'whole', 'chain', 'events', 'off', 'lovesick', 'dolt', 'What', 'cop', 'would', 'have', 'affair', 'woman', 'not', 'know', 'real', 'name', 'more', 'anyone', 'resources', 'find', 'out', 'someone', 'identity', 'plot', 'work', 'perhaps', 'not', 'knowing', 'name', 'essential', 'guess', 'can', 'forgive', 'movie', 'test', 'common', 'sense.The', 'movie', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'least', 'Willy', 'flippant', 'all-about-me', 'persona', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'victim', 'bringing', 'assaulter', 'justice', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'main', 'method', 'Ted', 'get', 'away', 'crime', 'was', 'surprise', 'dialogue', 'good', 'especially', 'Ted', 'word', 'calculating', 'clever', 'movie', 'everyone', 'superior', 'cleverness', 'eventually', 'own', 'earlier', 'message', 'Willy.The', 'title', 'Fracture', 'movie', 'subtle', 'message', 'Early', 'Ted', 'comment', 'look', 'closely', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'find', 'everything', 'weak', 'spot', 'where', 'can', 'break', 'what', 'Ted', 'good', 'movie', 'finding', 'people', 'weak', 'spot', 'using', 'advantage', 'what', 'Ted', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comprehend', 'too', 'weak', 'spot', 'will', 'be', 'undoing', 'fatal', 'flaw']",N/A

Basically, we are dealing with a romantic crime drama that turns into a Court TV/TLC Channel Forensic Science episode, until the clich&eacute; ending. We still don't understand why Fracture is being praised by so many critics when the real fractures are its obvious flaws--editing, draggy moments, awkward dialogue and the ""what were they thinking"" grand finale. Despite the respectable performance by Hopkins and the eye candy cinematography, the film drags forever and it's not as clever as it appears to be.Story:The meticulous (and very rich) structural engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) knows very well that his beautiful wife Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) is having an affair--obviously with a younger fellow. He wastes no time and once they are alone in their house, he shoots her right in the face. Police arrest him for attempted murder--she is still alive, but unfortunately in a coma.The cocky young attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) has been assigned to be the prosecutor against Ted who confessed his crime, right at the scene, to the negotiator Detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke)--who is the only man that heard his confession and also Jennifer's lover. Willy thinks that his case--because the confession and all--is an easy one and shouldn't take long to close it and he doesn't know that Rob was seeing Jennifer. Our young lawyer is also about to get a high-paid job for a bigger firm--his new boss will be the sexy Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). Willy and anybody else for that matter don't know that Ted is not your regular jealous old husband, but a smart and dangerous man who knows the law very well and it will use it to his advantage. As the story progresses, things get complicated for Willy who cannot find any hard evidence against Ted--Willy's career and personal life are also in jeopardy.Review:Fracture opens up pretty much a la Basic Instinct--the slick cinematography along with the love scenes--but there is no build up or character development before the shooting incident. We just see Ted planning his fatal crime in a very generic way. After he tried to kill his wife and goes to jail, then the film turns into a long version of the TV show Law & Order where nothing is what it seems with the traditional mumbo jumbo lawyer talk. At this point, the movie revolves mostly on Willy's motives and personal life. The proud lawyer who finally found a case that he really cares about. He wants to do the right thing, but his situation is so desperate that at one point, he wants to bring down the engineer at any cost even if he has to lie or loose his new job. While in Jail, Ted enjoys all of this and plays silly mind games with Willy. The chemistry between these two actors is very little. Predictably, the star of the film is Hopkins who gives us a decent performance as the evil cold blooded man who wanted to get even with his wife--not hard from him because he often plays these kinds of roles.Director Gregory Hoblit needs to know what this is not a TV movie. His experience in the small screen is painfully obvious--visually pretty, but TV-like nevertheless. The movie drags for most the film--we get unnecessary scenes like a Thanksgiving dinner where the dialogue is preposterous. Not only that, the worst part is towards the end of the film. They portray Ted as the smartest man in the courtroom, but the clich&eacute; ending makes you think twice about his intelligence.The Verdict:Too long to be a Law & Order episode and too boring to be the next Basic Instinct, Fracture deals with an angry senior citizen who cannot stand his unfaithful wife and decides to kill her. Perhaps there is a fracture in our legal system and the movie tries to show that anyone with knowledge of the law can get around it. Whatever they writers wanted, those draggy moments and clich&eacute; ending ruins all of the other good aspects of the film.",3,Too long to be a Law & Order episode and too boring to be the next Basic Instinct,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3974,"['**No', 'Spoilers**Is', 'thing', 'perfect', 'crime', 'Perhaps', 'Fracture', 'far', 'Basically', 'are', 'dealing', 'romantic', 'crime', 'drama', 'Court', 'TV/TLC', 'Channel', 'Forensic', 'Science', 'episode', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Fracture', 'being', 'praised', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'when', 'real', 'fractures', 'are', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'editing', 'draggy', 'moments', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'were', 'thinking', 'grand', 'finale', 'respectable', 'performance', 'Hopkins', 'eye', 'candy', 'cinematography', 'film', 'forever', 'not', 'as', 'clever', 'be.Story', 'meticulous', 'very', 'rich', 'structural', 'engineer', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'very', 'well', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'having', 'affair', 'obviously', 'younger', 'fellow', 'time', 'once', 'are', 'alone', 'house', 'shoots', 'right', 'face', 'Police', 'arrest', 'attempted', 'murder', 'still', 'alive', 'unfortunately', 'coma.The', 'cocky', 'young', 'attorney', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'been', 'assigned', 'be', 'prosecutor', 'Ted', 'who', 'confessed', 'crime', 'right', 'scene', 'negotiator', 'Detective', 'Rob', 'Nunally', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'who', 'only', 'man', 'heard', 'confession', 'also', 'Jennifer', 'lover', 'Willy', 'case', 'confession', 'easy', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'close', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rob', 'was', 'seeing', 'Jennifer', 'young', 'lawyer', 'also', 'about', 'get', 'high-paid', 'job', 'bigger', 'firm', 'new', 'boss', 'will', 'be', 'sexy', 'Nikki', 'Gardner', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Willy', 'anybody', 'else', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ted', 'not', 'regular', 'jealous', 'old', 'husband', 'smart', 'dangerous', 'man', 'who', 'law', 'very', 'well', 'will', 'use', 'advantage', 'story', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'Willy', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Ted', 'Willy', 'career', 'personal', 'life', 'are', 'also', 'jeopardy.Review', 'Fracture', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'la', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'slick', 'cinematography', 'love', 'scenes', 'build', 'up', 'character', 'development', 'shooting', 'incident', 'just', 'see', 'Ted', 'planning', 'fatal', 'crime', 'very', 'generic', 'way', 'tried', 'kill', 'wife', 'jail', 'then', 'film', 'long', 'version', 'TV', 'show', 'Law', 'Order', 'where', 'nothing', 'what', 'traditional', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'lawyer', 'talk', 'point', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Willy', 'motives', 'personal', 'life', 'proud', 'lawyer', 'who', 'finally', 'found', 'case', 'really', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'situation', 'so', 'desperate', 'one', 'point', 'bring', 'down', 'engineer', 'cost', 'even', 'lie', 'loose', 'new', 'job', 'Jail', 'Ted', 'silly', 'mind', 'games', 'Willy', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'very', 'little', 'Predictably', 'star', 'film', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'decent', 'performance', 'evil', 'cold', 'blooded', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'even', 'wife', 'not', 'hard', 'often', 'kinds', 'roles.Director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'know', 'what', 'not', 'TV', 'movie', 'experience', 'small', 'screen', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'visually', 'pretty', 'TV-like', 'nevertheless', 'movie', 'most', 'film', 'get', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'where', 'dialogue', 'preposterous', 'Not', 'only', 'worst', 'part', 'end', 'film', 'portray', 'Ted', 'smartest', 'man', 'courtroom', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'think', 'twice', 'intelligence.The', 'Verdict', 'Too', 'long', 'be', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode', 'too', 'boring', 'be', 'next', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Fracture', 'angry', 'senior', 'citizen', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'kill', 'Perhaps', 'fracture', 'legal', 'system', 'movie', 'show', 'anyone', 'knowledge', 'law', 'can', 'get', 'writers', 'wanted', 'draggy', 'moments', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'other', 'good', 'aspects', 'film']",N/A

1078956,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B000R4SMCW,Justin Playfair,"[1, 1]","Crime scene investigation takes a black eye in this thriller. Although the movie is excellent and is a study of personality flaws in overly successful yuppies it is nonetheless a bit of a scam when it comes to evidence linking a criminal with a potential murder.Physical evidence is good but is not absolutely the only requirement to convict in our system of justice. Indeed, I have witnessed murderers go to jail without any physical evidence presented. So we are somewhat mislead here in this picture. Also, although not generally known, all guns have identification numbers and in situations that are present here in the movie the officers would certainly know if their guns had been tampered in any way.The relations of officers are also known, especially in their off duty amorous affairs by their co-workers and the chance that an investigator would show up at the scene and not reveal his relationship in a situation to a superior is highly unlikely.Yet, this film is still tense and interesting despite all the police procedural flaws. Anthony Hopkins is at his Hannibal best and sinks his teeth into a young strapping successful professional prosecutor who believes he is God's gift to women and the best brain to ever come into the DA's office. We love to see Hopkins manipulate the smart aleck prosecutor, playing on his vanity and then skillfully destroy the young mans reputation before all of Los Angeles.

So it isn't a suspense story as much as a psychological thriller, the type that pits two very strong personalities against one another (played by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling).Each is a control freak  and each is ambitious. The whole thrill of this movie is watching the characters, seeing how they develop and change and wondering how this will all play out.Looking at the reviews that others have written for this movie, it is clear that people tended to love or hate this movie -and I think I understand why. For one thing, you KNOW what happened -and why -almost from the start. But I happen to like character-driven movies and this one is definitely in that vein.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 1]","I expected better reviews on fracture but I suppose not everyone will be able to give complete attention to Hopkins and overlook the films flaws. Yes Anthony Hopkins had yet another one man show where he gave us some comedy, a little creepiness, and amazing intelligence to defeat the law. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hokins) has found that his wife is cheating on him with a man who looks further down from Crawford's age and closer to her own. Crawford waits for his wife to come home and then proceeds to shoot her not killing her but she stays unconscious. Crawford moves some things in the house including the shell casings (replacing them with new ones) and waits for the police to come.When the police arrive Crawford confesses to his crime and then surrenders. At his arraignment Crawford retracts his confession and then says that he wants to represent himself. He then meets Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) who is the district attorney trying to put him away. Beachum has some trouble, he is a young attorney who has not lost a case and is receiving a new and well paid job at a new firm for it. He expected Crawfords case to be very easy but Crawford has so many tricks up his sleeve and Beachum might not get that job. The two go back and forth trying to outsmart one another but it will all come down to the wire and the end is pretty darn good.The story is a good one and with characters that could bore you being played by any other actor the cast was picked very well. As I said before Anthony Hokins kills this movie. His comedic sarcastic scenes are hilarious and I have never seen a movie where I wanted the bad guy to win so badly. Ryan Gosling was an ok opponent for Hopkins but maybe not perfect for this role. I seriously couldn't stand Goslings relationship with Rosamund Pike at all. In a lot of movies they feel the need to add a girlfriend or boyfriend to fill some movie time and it doesn't always work. What makes this film is Anthony Hopkins, he does a crazy job playing this guy and he makes every minute of the movie a little more interesting. I would say this would be a pretty good movie to rent or borrow. I think all together it's a 4 star film with 5 star acting from one actor so it's not enough to give it 5.

They never exactly explained why Willy Beauchamp has attained a 97 percent conviction rate with this unintelligble Goober stammer, but you know what, after a half an hour or so Ryan just stopped talking in his soup and started speaking English like any other Angeleno.  It's like his beginning to care about human values and other human beings brought on many changes, including adopting the standard ""mid-American"" speech patterns people on TV have.  By the end of the movie he could have become a newscaster, and my love for him had returned, full strength, like an entire bottle of Excedrin.  He's a fantastic actor and rabks right up there with his fellow new Mousekeeters of the period, Justin, Christina and Britney as far as star power goes.  Didn't Anthony Hopkins win an Oscar or two?  He should have brought them to the set of FRACTURE and gifted them to Ryan Gosling, as his successor, say on a break from filming, livened up the craft table or whatever it's called.  For Gosling is the new Hopkins and in fact, when Hopkins was on the screen, the movie got unexpectedly dull--or if not dull, then incredibly obvious.  It was like a successor to HANNIBAL--say Clarice got tired of being married to the ancient Hannibal Lecter and started cheating on him with a local detective--of course HL would seek his revenge, starting by shooting her point blank and leaving her for dead.As Clarice Lecter--I mean, Jennifer Crawford, the lovely actress Embeth Davidtz who was so good in JUNEBUG turns in an amazing performance here, and the odd thing about it is, she's in a coma through most of it.  Not since the poet John Giorno snooxed through 5 and a half hours of Andy Warhol's early feature SLEEP (1963) has any leading player spent so much of a film out cold.As for the plot, how on earth could Crawford make sure that his wife's boyfriend would be the one who came to his door after the shot was fired?  If the whole basis of his plot rested on that happening, it's even more ludicrous than it seems at first glance.

I found little of either in this boring rehash of roles Anthony Hopkins has lived off since his Hanibal Lechter days merged with a dull courtroom drama.Hopkins is an aerodesigner that kills his wife, who's had an affair. He manages to get even with the guy that cuckolded him during the investigation and is tried by hotshot prosecutor Ryan Gosling, a walking, gum-chewing, guffawing cliche of one of Hollywood's great archetypes. Mr. Cliche gets surprised by the way Hanibal, er Hopkins, sets up the crime so he can't be found guilty (in fact, he can't even be tried.)But, wait, as they say in the infomercials, there are a bunch of twists coming that will give you satisfaction. Turns out prosecutor Gosling isn't as dumb as he looks and Hanibal II isn't as smart as he looks. So guess what? They do find a way to try him for his crime after all.Unfortunately, the two paragraphs above comprise the sum and substance of this really bad movie. I don't recall when this made its appearance at the theaters but it couldn't have made much of an indent. The action, what there is of it, is slow-moving, full of holes in its logic, and so predictable you'll figure it out in about a half-hour. The ending is one of Hollywood's greatest traps -- it does nothing more than set the ground for the sequel, which I'm sure was filmed same time they did this one.Save your money, time and energy and pass on this dog.

Nope.(WARNING: This review is for viewers who have already seen the movie.)The problem with a VERY clever movie, is that it attracts viewers who are determined to figure it out.  Therefore, the script-writer must be smarter and more careful than your average gum-snapping teen.The big problems here are that our anti-hero plans every detail of ""getting away with murder,"" except a few MAJOR details.The entire plan will not work unless the detective-lover-guy reacts to the murderer's callousness by leaping at him and wrestling him to the floor.  Without this, there can be no calculated switching of the same-make guns.  Get it?Also, the entire plan will not work if his wife had AT ANY TIME told detective-lover-guy where she lived or her last name.  Ooops!  And what if he was off-duty, or not called to the scene, or another hotshot cop went in first.  Ooops, the whole plan fails.(Just for fun, I'd love to know why the elaborate part was included, of murderer shooting through some windows.  ??? )Worse than these gambles, is the HUGE and ridiculous linchpin problem of detective-lover-guy NEVER realizing that maybe, just maybe, since he has the EXACT same gun, and no one can find the actual murder weapon, that just maybe he should have his checked.  Once he does that, the whole plan is foiled, and hey, no need to blow your head off.At the end, it was almost comical that our hero prosecutor's plan depended on murderer thinking they were alone (thus, no witnesses to hear the cliche confession).  Yet, as soon as prosecutor opens the door, the whole yard is swarming with cops, with their police radios doing their noisy cliche thing.  Come on, script-writer, stay clever and real to the end.  Don't get tired of being sharp.  Your viewers expected a full ride.Aside from these jabs -- the acting, camera work, characters and pace were all excellent.  A few times, lines were spoken so softly I had to playback and turn up.  The blonde love-interest was interesting, but kind of dropped without tying it up for us.

1078976,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000R4SMCW,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 7]","I was trying to answer a question about what movies I'd seen recently.  When I said I'd seen ""Fracture,"" my mind went blank; and I couldn't remember who was in it or what it was about.  I decided that if I reviewed it, maybe it'd come back to me.  The title and the film seem disconnected to me.  I'm sure there was a connection between the word ""Fracture"" and the picture, but it sounds like something Hitchcock would have directed.  Now ""Shot in the Head"" might have brought back what Ted Crawford does to his wife Jennifer.Director Gregory Hoblit made a name for himself as the Executive Producer of the TV series ""NYPD Blue.""  He directs this stylish thriller that has the suspense of a chess match, brainy but not that interesting to watch.Anthony Hopkin will probably always be identified with his amazing Oscar-winning performance from ""Silence of the Lambs.""  So many of his characters seem like variations on that spooky character.  Ryan Gosling was a great rebel romantic in ""The Notebook"" and received an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"" last year, which I know at least 24 people have seen.  As DA Willy Beachum, he's too flawed to be entirely likeable, but one does admire the character's perseverance.  Embeth Davidtz plays Crawford's wife Jennifer in a brief appearance.  Her role in the small film ""Junebug"" was filled with energy.  Her face is one that leaves you trying to recall where you'd seen it.  While I couldn't come up with ""Bridget Jones Diary"" or ""Schindler's List"" anymore than I could recall the movie ""Fracture"" when asked, she does a nice job as the wife of the wealthy but cold Ted Crawford.  One really can't blame her for seeking out police negotiator Rob Nunnally played by Billy Burke, who I did recognize from one of my favorite episodes of TV's ""Monk.""  Burke does a good job of playing the distraught lover, although one wonders how one used to being in the middle of crisis events suddenly loses it on the courtroom steps.  David Strathairn turns in another amazingly tightly controlled performance that is well suited to this film, brainy but boring, or ""Good Night & Good Luck.""My favorite part of the film was Rosamund Pike as high-powered lawyer Nikki Gardener.  Hoblit takes us to the Gardner family's home for Thanksgiving, which introduces us to her father, a judge, but also allows Pike to show numerous levels between the professional and the personal family life.  Her face is familiar from double-o-seven's ""Die Another Day,"" ""Pride & the Prejudice"" and ""The Libertine.""  [I think was one of the 24 people who actually watched ""The Libertine"" all the way to the end!]""Fracture"" really fractured for me at the end.  Without giving any spoiler, it seemed that someone as bright as Ted Crawford would surely be able to have contemplated the lame-brained technicality with which Beachum wraps up the plot & assures us that good guys win.  While there is a lot to be said for sitting in a cool movie theatre in the summertime watching a good movie, odds are a year from now you'll also be trying to remember, ""What was that about?""

In his spare time, for instance, he constructs elaborately gold and silver contraptions that send crystal marbles on endless, dizzying loops, around and over and under and back up, the cogs and wheels turning inexplicably, inconceivably, pointlessly.  These devices are beautiful and fun to look at -- one of them towering almost four feet high -- but they are ultimately useless.  They don't do much other than divert, and even that in small measure.""Fracture,"" a courtroom thriller from the same guy who madeFallenandPrimal Fear(Gregory Hoblit) wants to be as smart and intricate as those marble roller coasters, but it is only as diverting.The set-up is interesting (and Hoblit's detail-driven directing make even the splashes of water on Hopkins' face look luxurious): Crawford comes home early one day and shoots his adulterous wife in the face.  Several hours later, he has been arrested.  Signed and verbal confession.  Murder weapon in hand.The open-and-shut case is handed down to a clever-n-clean-cut Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), an attorney on the way up to bigger, brassier waters, about to start work at a prestigious nickel-and-iron law firm, moving on from his down-home grass-roots spot at a small legal house where his prowess is not-so-subtly resented by everyone but the cute-as-a-button secretaries.  One last quick case, thinks Beachum, before he packs his bags and starts working for the Big Dogs.Of course, it's not so simple as all that.  It turns out that most of the evidence is inadmissable because the arresting officer, Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) also happens to be Crawford's wife's lover.  As the locks on the case begin to disintegrate, so does Beachum's handle on his career, notwithstanding the brief (and weirdly directed) affair Beachum begins to have with his soon-to-be boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike playing every upwardly-mobile, take-no-guff female attorney that's ever come out of Central Casting).The linchpin of the case -- and of the entire movie -- rests on finding the murder weapon.  Everything else is background noise.  The problem is, the script makes it pretty obvious where the weapon is.  We can see where that marble is going just by tracing the gold-plated track, so the destination is no surprise at all.  And since the entire story -- quite honestly, the entire story -- swivels on the fulcrum of that supposed tension (up to the excruciatingly slow revelation that Beachum has at the end), the entire story fails.I'd give points for Hoblit's competent directing and even for the acting.  Hopkins and Gosling are both powerhouses, one well-established, the other proving his mettle with every new film, but the lines they say are old, the ""twists"" they tread are so old, they've been worn into a rut by countless movies before them.  And their conflict -- the brash, young upstart (a brilliant man, really) versus the wise, studied maestro (an equally brilliant man) -- doesn't get much play time.  Even when it is on-screen, it's a mostly uninteresting battle of egos.Very little is at stake in ""Fracture,"" and even less is worth noting, and it's all because of the plot.  Fine acting and decent filming are like well-sculpted mahogany frames and gentle ogee pathways in an over-large marble maze-way.  They look pretty, they move just as prettily, but after five minutes, it gets old to watch.

The rub comes, when he looks like he might get away with it, and the only thing between him and freedom is a young up-and-coming public prosecutor, played by Ryan Gosling.  He is starting a new job for a new boss (Rosamund Pike, from Die Another Day - much sexier here) in a high profile corporate law firm.  So for him it becomes a question of conscience - can he let the murderer go, so that he can move on with his new career, or will he jeapordise his new career to do whatever it takes to `bring him down'.So things are set up less as a whodunit, but more as a Columbo episode format.  We know he did it - but will the good guy figure it out?  None of the scenes have too much in the way of surprises, and the twists are fairly well flagged.  So what we are left with is a very glossy looking thriller with superior performances.  Sure, Hopkins has had better moments, and could be accused of sleepwalking through the movie, but Hopkins on autopilot is still better than the rest of the pack.  And the big surprise is Ryan Gosling - here, he puts in a memorable central performance.  The movie hinges on our buying into this character, and Gosling pulls it off.  It's Gosling that raises this to a 4 star movie.It's clear the plot set up will never be entirely satisfactorily resolved, as evidenced by the two alternative endings where they played with how best to finish the story off.

1078999,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000R4SMCW,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 2]","This is a movie that's quickly forgotten. It's uninspiring, cliche' and boring. This movie was one of the most unconvincing films due to the actors and the so-called plot.In a nutshell, Ryan Gosling plays a hotshot lawyer (wow, that's unique) who is given an attempted murder case where a man Anthony Hopkins (whose character was comical and though he probably wasn't trying to be) has shot his wife in the head. Turns out the wife has been having an affair with the detective on the case and the movie just goes downhill from there.There were several problems with this film because it was so unbelievable. I love Ryan Gosling and think he's a fantastic actor but he did not fit this role. He was not convincing at all as a lawyer and he seemed uncomfortable within the scenes with Hopkins. It's like he knew he was out of his element because it's like he held back with his acting. I also felt like his acting was a bad impersonation of Matthew McConaughey in a John Grisham film. Why he had a Southern accent and why it was important to the film was beyond me. I also felt like I was watching an A Time to Kill knockoff. It just wasn't working and he seemed like he was more intimidated by Hopkins as an actor than anything else.Hopkins' talent was completely wasted and I don't know why he was in this film. This was one of the worst acting jobs I have ever seen Hopkins do and I blame it on the bad plot and bad writing. He just didn't have anything decent to work with. He seemed uninspired and like he didn't even care about the scenes half the time. It's like he was just saying the words without any emotion or obligation. Anyone could've played Hopkins' part because for what he did, it did not matter.David Straitharn must've just needed a job or something because he insulted himself by being in this movie. Anyone could've done what he did and I didn't see any point to his character at all. Rosamund Pike was probably the best actor in the entire movie and they only showed her about four times. The romance between her and Gosling is what I enjoyed most but it ended up some watered down romance that proved pointless. It's obvious Pike was thrown in mainly for eye candy but she still did a good job with her role. At least her scenes kept me from dozing.The plot was laughable. I am so tired of movies trying to make a dumb character into a clever killer. I am also tired of movies where clues and answers just fall into the young lawyer's lap when he needs them too. This movie had so many plot holes and made no sense.Not only did I not buy Gosling as a lawyer but I sure as heck didn't buy him as someone smart enough to figure out Hopkins' plan. On top of that Hopkins' character was dumb as a pinky nail yet managed to keep Gosling running in circles. Please.This movie was a big pound of nothing. It's a wannabe lawyer film that doesn't live up to any of its predecessors. This is one movie that should be skipped unless you're just a fan of the stars. I've seen Lifetime Movies that are more suspenseful and interesting than this was.I gave it two stars for Rosamund Pike and for the short-lived romance in the movie. If it hadn't been for those two things I wouldn't have bothered to finish the movie at all.

Relax, he's no Hannibal Lector.  While he does have no problem with shooting people, I doubt that Mr. Hopkins would cross the line into caniblism this time.  Rather, he is just a guy looking to get away with his crime by playing mind games on Ryan Gosling.  Thankfully, Mr. Gosling shows us that he's no moron and won't go down without a fight.  The interaction and antagnonism between these two men is the gem of this film.  The acting is superb and it shows the most during Anthony Hopkins's early tries at being a pro-cee lidigator...granted, it takes the entire cast to make that work, but Mr. Hopkins shines.

Such are the zingers that Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) tosses at Willy Beachum, very young deputy D.A.  This movie is a brilliant psychological thriller.  Ted is convinced that he has executed the perfect crime.  He readily confesses to shooting his wife, who he has caught in an affair. He is convinced his confession will be thrown out on technicalities.  He is so convinced that he even attempts to serve as his own counsel for the trial.  The person that he has caught his wife with adds even more intrigue to the movie, and he makes sure the person is there when the body is discovered so that he can see the look of anguish on the guy's face.  The wife is not dead, however, and on life support in a coma.  The young prosecutor knows he is losing badly and spends hours at her bedside hoping to revive her so she can name the shooter.  Ted loves the game of cat and mouse with the young attorney, and feels that Willy is so cocky, he will trap himself up.  The finale of the movie is worth the wait.  Ted is so diabolically clever at every turn, covering all of the bases, but there are two little details he has forgotten.  One concerns the double jeaopardy clause, and the other is in underestimating Willy's abilities.

The mystery is, how and will he get away with it? While there were a few interesting turns of events, I thought the film was generally dull and the plot was just too contrived and poorly scripted for me to take seriously. I happen to think that Ryan Gosling is one of the better up and coming actors in the game (his questionable role selections notwithstanding) but his performance here was quite average I thought. The same goes for veteran Anthony Hopkins.In a nutshell, this movie is about a guy (Hopkins) who finds out his wife is cheating on him, and thus shoots her. As luck would have it, the arresting officer is the guy who was banging his wife. The wife is in a coma, and the case for attempted murder is seemingly open and shut, being that the suspect still has the gun in hand when the police come, and he confesses on the spot. But alas, if it was that simple, there wouldn't be much of a mystery would there? Hopkins has a few tricks up his sleeve, and the prosecutor (Gosling) is so intrigued by the case that he postpones his new job at a prestigious defense firm to stay and try Hopkins. This leads to a cat and mouse game between the two, with Hopkins handing the young prosecutor his first real challenge of his career.If you're a die-hard fan of either of the lead actors, or an enthusiast for murder mysteries, you might want to give it a shot, but otherwise I would say skip it.

Ted Crawford (Hopkins) shot his young wife (Davidson) because he discovered she was having an affair with a younger man. Jennifer Crawford hovers in the hospital in a coma with a bullet lodged in her head.Enter William Beachum (Ryan Gosling) an ambitious young Assistant District Attorney with an impressive 97% win record and a shiny new job with an uptown law firm.  State v. Crawford is Beachum's last case and he figures it's going to be an easy win.Anything but, ignoring the old saw that ""anyone who represents themselves has a fool for a client"", Crawford fires his attorney and not only tries his own case, but Beachum as well.The tables are turned and this time Beachum not only wants to win, he doesn't want to set a guilty man free.  The resulting story is an interesting character study, but only fast-paced near the end where a life is at stake.The best part of this film was seeing Hopkins and Gosling face off.  I remember seeing ""The Edge"", which was a real thriller starring Hopkins and Alec Baldwin--two enemies who had to rely on each other to survive.

Enter Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who brutally shoots his wife in a calculated rage which occurs in the first five minutes of the story. This horrific action sets the stage for psychological warfare with Deputy District Attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) through the legal system.While the over-confident, slightly arrogant Beachum thinks he's got an open and shut case, he's not paying attention to the happenings all around him. He's on his way up and out of his position of District Attorney to a brighter future with a new, highly esteemed firm. He just has to finish up with this seemingly easy case that takes it's first move in the court after a slow ascension to get there.Right out of the shoot Crawford excuses his attorney and asks the Judge if he might represent himself for his own defense.  He pulls the rug right out from under the always self-assured Beachum.Being blindsided from the start, Beachum starts to play catch-up through the ever increasing tension building from Crawford's twisting and turning the plot in his favor, with quite an ease.  One should expect this with Hopkins performing his calculating magic with his role as the defendant.These two actors bring out their best in this cat and mouse suspense thriller, pulling on the Hitchcockian style. While the first hour of the film may seem to be meandering around a bit, it's really lending several clues that Beachum is overlooking while focusing of his future.Be astute in watching the details enfolding during this opportunity, to not miss them yourself.  In your initial viewing things start to fracture in the court for Beachum and continue to do so throughout the movie.Without Hoblit's careful direction of Gosling's character, he may not have been able to hold his own with Hopkins' dominant conniving character.  He proves able in sort of a conniving sense of his own and the result is surely amazing.I would recommend the Wide Screen Edition for better observing the details if you do have the choice in viewing.",5,"This is no hairline fracture, Hopkins and Gosling compound the issue...",1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2077,"['movie', 'grabs', 'right', 'start', 'attempted', 'murder', 'Enter', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'brutally', 'shoots', 'wife', 'calculated', 'rage', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'story', 'horrific', 'action', 'stage', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'Deputy', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'legal', 'system.While', 'over-confident', 'slightly', 'arrogant', 'Beachum', 'got', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'happenings', 'way', 'up', 'position', 'District', 'Attorney', 'brighter', 'future', 'new', 'highly', 'esteemed', 'firm', 'just', 'finish', 'up', 'seemingly', 'easy', 'case', 'first', 'move', 'court', 'slow', 'ascension', 'get', 'there.Right', 'shoot', 'Crawford', 'attorney', 'Judge', 'might', 'represent', 'own', 'defense', 'rug', 'right', 'out', 'always', 'self-assured', 'Beachum.Being', 'blindsided', 'start', 'Beachum', 'play', 'catch-up', 'ever', 'increasing', 'tension', 'building', 'Crawford', 'twisting', 'turning', 'plot', 'favor', 'ease', 'One', 'should', 'expect', 'Hopkins', 'performing', 'calculating', 'magic', 'role', 'defendant.These', 'two', 'actors', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'cat', 'mouse', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'pulling', 'Hitchcockian', 'style', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'meandering', 'bit', 'really', 'lending', 'several', 'clues', 'Beachum', 'overlooking', 'focusing', 'future.Be', 'astute', 'watching', 'details', 'enfolding', 'opportunity', 'not', 'miss', 'initial', 'viewing', 'things', 'start', 'fracture', 'court', 'Beachum', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'movie.Without', 'Hoblit', 'careful', 'direction', 'Gosling', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'Hopkins', 'dominant', 'conniving', 'character', 'able', 'sort', 'conniving', 'sense', 'own', 'result', 'surely', 'amazing.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'Wide', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'better', 'observing', 'details', 'do', 'have', 'choice', 'viewing']",N/A

Fracture is a film with qualities reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock era that really left me guessing until the very end.  Gosling's performance as a young smitten lawyer named Willie Beachum is something to applaud.  I was not impressed when he was cast in a crime thriller called ""Murder by Numbers"" with Sandra Bullock a few years ago, but those thoughts are now erased from my memory.  Beachum takes on the case of a successful engineer named Ted Crawford, who is accused of attempted murder.  As the clues become less and less presentable, Beachum suddenly realizes that Crawford is playing some sort of game, and it is a game of chance and elaborate mind games that Beachum just might win.Fracture did not douse me with puzzles, in fact it really held back in that area and yet the continual drama that played out between the two main characters was more than enough to keep me not just guessing, but simply interested in the film's story as a whole.",5,Fracture - a review,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,1039,"['Fracture', 'great', 'psychological', 'drama', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Fracture', 'film', 'qualities', 'reminiscent', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'era', 'really', 'left', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'Gosling', 'performance', 'young', 'smitten', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Willie', 'Beachum', 'something', 'applaud', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'crime', 'thriller', 'called', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'thoughts', 'are', 'now', 'erased', 'memory', 'Beachum', 'case', 'successful', 'engineer', 'named', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'who', 'accused', 'attempted', 'murder', 'clues', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'presentable', 'Beachum', 'suddenly', 'Crawford', 'playing', 'sort', 'game', 'game', 'chance', 'elaborate', 'mind', 'games', 'Beachum', 'just', 'might', 'win.Fracture', 'did', 'not', 'douse', 'puzzles', 'fact', 'really', 'held', 'back', 'area', 'yet', 'continual', 'drama', 'played', 'out', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'not', 'just', 'guessing', 'simply', 'interested', 'film', 'story', 'whole']",N/A
1079028,A3RF46CL8GDIN8,B000R4SMCW,SouthGenie,"[12, 17]","I first saw this movie on HBO, and while I was glad I didn't pay money in a theater to see it, I still don't think it's the biggest waste of movie time ever. (I'm still trying to get back the 90 minutes of my life I lost to ""The Forgotten,"" though I long since made Time-Warner refund me the $3.99 charge for its rental.) Initially I would have given Fracture 2 stars, but once I started thinking of Willie as a young Jack McCoy of Law and Order I decided it was really more of a 3, almost a 3.5 star movie.This movie had nothing to do with Jack McCoy or Law and Order, I just felt like it should have.  Other reviewers said they would have been more accepting of this as a TV movie, and I came to agree. It would have been the perfect NBC Sunday night movie about how Jack McCoy of Law and Order came to be who he is.It should have been a better movie; the writing, directing and acting could all have been better.  Hopkins is adept in his role as the intelligent and manipulative psychopath. Backhandedly overbearing, he subtly insults even while playing disarmingly nave, dropping  hints to people that he is smarter than and a few steps ahead of them. Gosling is convincing as the cocky, overconfident young man. Typically he is not easily fooled and fairly unflappable, as certain of his success in the bedroom as the courtroom, but Gosling played his role with a bit too much of the ""it's all good"" attitude. He wasn't very convincing in scenes that were supposed to display urgency or intensity, not in the courtroom or out of it. There also wasn't much chemistry between him and Nikki, his new boss and romantic interest. That she was his new boss with whom he immediately gets involved with, and given that it was a job he got with an off hand legal stunt and still had to prove himself at should have made their affair feel more risqu&eacute;, but didn't.  I generally couldn't feel the heat of his anger, frustration, or even lust. This could also have due to poor writing, directing, and maybe even casting. He did have one really good scene with one of the detectives, the one played by Cliff Curtis, where they were both frustrated with events and each other and played it well, so I couldn't be sure he couldn't deliver more emotional intensity if the movie had been better written and directed. Unfortunately the parts where tension and suspense were supposed to be building generally fell flat.Now if it had been about Jack McCoy, Lobruto could have been Adam Schiff, making the scenes between them more emotionally charged, particularly the one where Willie says ""that's what this is about, I'm not going to be you in 20 years"" to Lobruto. Lobruto knows Willie better than Willie knows himself and seems to be able to mentor him in the same way Adam Schiff might have mentored a young Jack McCoy.  Fracture wasn't made for the Law and Order franchise, unfortunately.As far as the DVD extras, there wasn't that much, but there are a lot of better movies with fewer DVD extras. Deleted scenes and alternate endings were included. They were interesting to see but better left out of the movie, in my opinion. There was no commentary track though and that seemed like sour grapes to me.This is the story of a confident young lawyer that knows how to win and remain ethical, (even if he's riding the line ethically) but learns how to care. It's neither the best nor worst movie you'll ever see. I went ahead and got it from Amazon market place because I would have gotten it from the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, I just don't feel like waiting for it to get there.",3,The Making of Jack McCoy,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,3571,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'HBO', 'was', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'money', 'theater', 'see', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'biggest', 'waste', 'movie', 'time', 'ever', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'back', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'lost', 'Forgotten', 'long', 'made', 'Time-Warner', '3.99', 'charge', 'rental', 'Initially', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Fracture', '2', 'stars', 'once', 'started', 'thinking', 'Willie', 'young', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Law', 'Order', 'decided', 'was', 'really', 'more', '3', 'almost', '3.5', 'star', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Law', 'Order', 'just', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accepting', 'TV', 'movie', 'came', 'agree', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'NBC', 'Sunday', 'night', 'movie', 'how', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Law', 'Order', 'came', 'be', 'who', 'is.It', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Hopkins', 'adept', 'role', 'intelligent', 'manipulative', 'psychopath', 'Backhandedly', 'overbearing', 'subtly', 'insults', 'even', 'playing', 'disarmingly', 'nave', 'dropping', 'hints', 'people', 'smarter', 'few', 'steps', 'ahead', 'Gosling', 'convincing', 'cocky', 'overconfident', 'young', 'man', 'Typically', 'not', 'easily', 'fooled', 'fairly', 'unflappable', 'certain', 'success', 'bedroom', 'courtroom', 'Gosling', 'played', 'role', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'attitude', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'display', 'urgency', 'intensity', 'not', 'courtroom', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'chemistry', 'Nikki', 'new', 'boss', 'romantic', 'interest', 'was', 'new', 'boss', 'whom', 'immediately', 'involved', 'given', 'was', 'job', 'got', 'off', 'hand', 'legal', 'stunt', 'still', 'had', 'prove', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'affair', 'feel', 'more', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'did', ""n't"", 'generally', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'heat', 'anger', 'frustration', 'even', 'lust', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'due', 'poor', 'writing', 'directing', 'maybe', 'even', 'casting', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'scene', 'one', 'detectives', 'one', 'played', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'where', 'were', 'frustrated', 'events', 'other', 'played', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'more', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'written', 'directed', 'Unfortunately', 'parts', 'where', 'tension', 'suspense', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'building', 'generally', 'fell', 'flat.Now', 'had', 'been', 'about', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Lobruto', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Adam', 'Schiff', 'making', 'scenes', 'more', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'particularly', 'one', 'where', 'Willie', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', '20', 'years', 'Lobruto', 'Lobruto', 'Willie', 'better', 'Willie', 'be', 'able', 'mentor', 'same', 'way', 'Adam', 'Schiff', 'might', 'have', 'mentored', 'young', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Fracture', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'unfortunately.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'extras', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'movies', 'fewer', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'were', 'included', 'were', 'interesting', 'see', 'better', 'left', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'commentary', 'track', 'seemed', 'sour', 'grapes', 'me.This', 'story', 'confident', 'young', 'lawyer', 'how', 'win', 'remain', 'ethical', 'even', 'riding', 'line', 'ethically', 'how', 'care', 'best', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'went', 'ahead', 'got', 'Amazon', 'market', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', '5.50', 'bin', 'Wal-Mart', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'waiting', 'get', 'there']",N/A

Gosling is good as the prosecutor and plays his part well.

That's as much of a summary as I intend to give since all my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray itself and my rating is also based only upon that quality and not on my opinion of the movie.VIDEO&#8230;.The quality of the transfer is really quite good with deep dark blacks which depend much upon the actual quality of the TV monitor you are watching it on.  I saw no artifacting or background banding anywhere in the film's imaging.  Color grading tends to be very warm with a soft  focus but contrast is really very good.  Mbps rate is very high averaging towards the high 30's and low 40s.  I do believe that there is some real improvement between this Blu Ray and my Standard Def version though this is not a side by side comparison.AUDIO&#8230;.You do have to go to the audio set up menu in order to set the audio to a lossless Dolby True HD setting, otherwise it will go to a default lossy audio.  This is a mostly dialogue driven film so do not expect much use of your surrounds for in immersive audio experience.  The LFE channel is rarely brought into play.  Surprisingly, some nice foley fx in the front surrounds were present here and there.  Dialogue is clear and transparent though initial audio levels were a touch low.  Raising my volume level a bit settled that issue and I did not have to roller coaster my remote's volume once properly set.EXTRAs&#8230;.There are several additional scenes and two alternate endings.  Once watched, glad they picked the ending they did.  I enjoyed the additional scenes.

There is no doubt to the guilt of Hopkins' character in this film like that of the murderer on that famous series I mentioned.  Knowing the guilt gives the story a different angle and we are along for the ride to see how or even if Hopkins gets caught. The story is also helped by some snappy dialog and unpredictable plot twists.This film is in the genre of ""cat and mouse"" played out in a courtroom and Hopkins makes the best ""cat"" today on film.  His character is rather amoral and clearly operates under his own rules of engagement with little regard to the rules that apply to the rest of us ""little people.""  He is snobbish and condescending to the point that you wonder what his wife ever saw in him.  He clashes effectively with the equally unlikable prosecutor played by Gosling.Gosling's cocky portrayal of the prosecutor that would have been better played by Tom Cruise in his younger days, but here Gosling plays the role a bit too stereotypically right down to the arrogant gum chewing and swaggering walk.  In fact, we generally dislike him enough that we initially enjoy the head games that Hopkins plays with him.  We want to see him brought down a peg or two.The film is well-paced but unimaginatively directed.  Much is left to the two leads and the script to carry the story.  That's all well and good, but it's nice to see a story delivered with some flair or style.  Here  the direction is rather mundane and it all plays out like a TV movie-of-the-week.

1079035,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000R4SMCW,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[7, 8]","Anthony Hopkins loves movies where he can wipe the floor with his costars. He is almost giddy in roles like Hannibal Lector. His character in director Gregory Hoblit's latest thriller, Fracture, is no different. Like the eggshell analogy that Hopkins makes to his costar Ryan Gosling, Fracture falls prey to the same smarmy advice the star gives out: everything, no matter how perfect it may look, has a flaw.When wealthy and intelligent aerodynamics expert Ted Crawford (Hopkins) catches his wife in an act of infidelity with a Los Angeles homicide detective, he cooks up an elaborate plan to not only kill his wife, but to legally get away with it. What should have been an open and shut case for District Attorney Willy Beachum turns into a career ending nightmare as Crawford seemingly outsmarts the law at every turn.Though the direction, acting and visual style in Fracture is fantastic, the hairline crack that splinters the picture is the film's attempt at creating suspense by relying on a twist ending that is easily predictable given the information that is presented early in the film. How exactly does Crawford shoot his wife in the face with a weapon that has never been fired? Given the revealing marketing for the film, which gives away the circumstances surrounding the murder, audiences can easily trace the steps that Hopkins takes early in the film, clearly giving them an idea of where Fracture is going.In the best thrillers, when the inevitable twist hits, it is the little clues scattered throughout the picture which give the ending credibility. While all these details are within Fracture, they are so clear that if you don't see the crack in the villain's flawless plan immediately, you will be kicking yourself when the film finally presents it to you.That being said, how does Fracture manage to hold the audience's attention despite its blatant reveal of the picture's number one mystery? While a less experienced director might rely heavily on this twist alone, Gregory Hoblit manages to see through what could have been a thinly veiled, plot driven movie and finds an intriguing character study.While Hopkins chews up the scenery with his vast intellect and charming whit, Fracture is really the story of Willy Beachum. Considering the fact that Fracture consists of a cast which includes an Academy Award winner and two nominees, it was to be expected that Hoblit should have no problem drawing performances from his actors. The real surprise in Fracture is just how well planned out the story of Willy Beachum was.Ryan Gosling's character begins the film as an arrogant, hot shot district attorney who has been put on the fast track, landing a job in the private sector. Thinking that Crawford's case will be the last in his short tenure serving the public, Beachum shrugs off what appears to be an easy win. His refusal to take the case seriously, combined with Crawford's meticulous planning, ultimately leads to Beachum's downfall. With his cushy job in jeopardy, Beachum's character develops a methodical obsession with Crawford, searching desperately to find the one clue that will put his nemesis away for good.As the film progresses Gosling's character changes from cocky to heroic. At first it is fun to see Hopkins toy with him, but thanks to Gosling's surprisingly good acting and Hoblit's taught direction, as Beachum changes, so does the audience's expectations. We want Gosling to come out on top. This change, from selfishness to selflessness is what gives his character the roundness that carries Fracture past its faults.Though predictable, it is the dramatic arc of Willy Beachum which separates Fracture from just another episode of Law and Order. While Hopkins' character begins the film as a smarmy antihero, he essentially pushes Beachum into becoming the unlikely champion of the story, and in some ways Fracture showcases one legendary actor passing on the torch to another.-Joe Russo",3,Fracture Movie Review,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3941,"['Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'movies', 'where', 'can', 'wipe', 'floor', 'costars', 'almost', 'giddy', 'roles', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'character', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'latest', 'thriller', 'Fracture', 'different', 'eggshell', 'analogy', 'costar', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Fracture', 'prey', 'same', 'smarmy', 'advice', 'star', 'out', 'everything', 'matter', 'how', 'perfect', 'may', 'look', 'flaw.When', 'wealthy', 'intelligent', 'aerodynamics', 'expert', 'Ted', 'Crawford', 'Hopkins', 'wife', 'act', 'infidelity', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'homicide', 'detective', 'up', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'not', 'only', 'kill', 'wife', 'legally', 'get', 'away', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'career', 'ending', 'nightmare', 'Crawford', 'seemingly', 'law', 'direction', 'acting', 'visual', 'style', 'Fracture', 'fantastic', 'hairline', 'crack', 'picture', 'film', 'attempt', 'creating', 'suspense', 'relying', 'twist', 'ending', 'easily', 'predictable', 'given', 'information', 'presented', 'early', 'film', 'How', 'exactly', 'Crawford', 'shoot', 'wife', 'face', 'weapon', 'never', 'been', 'fired', 'Given', 'revealing', 'marketing', 'film', 'away', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'murder', 'audiences', 'can', 'easily', 'trace', 'steps', 'Hopkins', 'early', 'film', 'clearly', 'giving', 'idea', 'where', 'Fracture', 'going.In', 'best', 'thrillers', 'when', 'inevitable', 'twist', 'hits', 'little', 'clues', 'scattered', 'picture', 'give', 'ending', 'credibility', 'details', 'are', 'Fracture', 'are', 'so', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'crack', 'villain', 'flawless', 'plan', 'immediately', 'will', 'be', 'kicking', 'when', 'film', 'finally', 'you.That', 'being', 'said', 'how', 'Fracture', 'manage', 'hold', 'audience', 'attention', 'blatant', 'reveal', 'picture', 'number', 'one', 'mystery', 'less', 'experienced', 'director', 'might', 'rely', 'heavily', 'twist', 'alone', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'plot', 'driven', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'character', 'study.While', 'up', 'scenery', 'vast', 'intellect', 'charming', 'whit', 'Fracture', 'really', 'story', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'Considering', 'fact', 'Fracture', 'cast', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'two', 'nominees', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'Hoblit', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'drawing', 'performances', 'actors', 'real', 'surprise', 'Fracture', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'planned', 'out', 'story', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'was.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'film', 'arrogant', 'hot', 'shot', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'been', 'put', 'fast', 'track', 'landing', 'job', 'private', 'sector', 'Thinking', 'Crawford', 'case', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'short', 'tenure', 'serving', 'public', 'Beachum', 'shrugs', 'off', 'what', 'be', 'easy', 'win', 'refusal', 'take', 'case', 'seriously', 'combined', 'Crawford', 'meticulous', 'planning', 'ultimately', 'Beachum', 'downfall', 'cushy', 'job', 'jeopardy', 'Beachum', 'character', 'methodical', 'obsession', 'Crawford', 'searching', 'desperately', 'find', 'one', 'clue', 'will', 'put', 'nemesis', 'away', 'good.As', 'film', 'Gosling', 'character', 'changes', 'cocky', 'heroic', 'first', 'fun', 'see', 'Hopkins', 'toy', 'thanks', 'Gosling', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'acting', 'Hoblit', 'taught', 'direction', 'Beachum', 'changes', 'so', 'audience', 'expectations', 'want', 'Gosling', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'change', 'selfishness', 'selflessness', 'what', 'character', 'roundness', 'Fracture', 'faults.Though', 'predictable', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'Fracture', 'just', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'Hopkins', 'character', 'film', 'smarmy', 'antihero', 'essentially', 'Beachum', 'becoming', 'unlikely', 'champion', 'story', 'ways', 'Fracture', 'one', 'legendary', 'actor', 'passing', 'torch', 'another.-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A

1079037,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000R4SMCW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 7]","""Fracture"", the new film from director Gregory Hoblit (""Primal Fear"", TV's ""L.A. Law"", ""NYPD Blue""), is a pretty routine legal thriller with four attributes that help it stand out from the rest of the pack.Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), an aerospace tycoon, sits at his desk working on a new Rube Goldberg contraption when he suddenly realizes he should leave the office. He shows up at a local hotel and finds his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) having an affair with Rob (Billy Burke, ""Ladder 49"", TV's ""24""), a detective with the Los Angeles police force. When Jennifer returns home, Ted confronts her and shoots her. Later, Rob is the detective called to the scene. When he realizes his girlfriend has been killed, he attacks Ted. At trial, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling, ""Half Nelson), a deputy DA with one foot out the door for a private practice job, is reluctant to take the case until he learns there is a signed confession. He convinces the district attorney (David Strathairn) that he can close the case in the two weeks he has left, keeping his conviction rate and new job intact. Willie, a man with a lot of debt, anxious to get going on his new high salary position, takes the case and soon meets his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamunde Pike, ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Die Another Day""), who seems to be attracted to her new Junior Associate. But Willie is cocky and assumes this is a slam-dunk until he starts to learn Ted's strategies to win the trial.""Fracture"" is a pretty routine legal thriller centered on a `brilliant mind' who will manipulate everyone around him in an effort to go free. The one person standing in his way? A younger `brilliant mind'.There are four factors that set ""Fracture"" apart from the rest of the pack. The first, and least significant of the four, are Hoblit's efforts to shoot this film in a very lush style, making it an almost beautiful film to watch. Hoblit worked on many of Steven Bocho's television series and the style is similar to ""L.A. Law"" or ""Murder One"". All of the surfaces gleam with polish, shadows are heavy and dark, and figures are frequently seen from behind screens or in shadow. Sunlight also seems to play a major influence on all of the cinematography. Often, characters are walking through hallways and we see the glow of early afternoon light trying to break through the dusty passageways or reflecting off marble surfaces. This technique helps to give the film a rich look, even beyond the general lifestyle of Hopkin's character, who is rich and lives in a nice, modern house. This technique helps to give Gosling's office at the District Attorney's office a rich look, even though the office is cramped, unglamorous and very different from Ted's lifestyle.The other three factors are the talent of three actors involved in the film. First and foremost is Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins has played this type of role before, the brilliant mastermind, but he does it so well. There are and will be inevitable comparisons between this role and Hannibal Lecter (both are brilliant, both are deadly, both play mind games with a young `prot&eacute;g&eacute;') and Ted Crawford is Hannibal - light. But it is always interesting to watch a master like Hopkins, even when he is lobbed a softball like this role. Crawford, an aeronautical engineer, likes to create elaborate rube Goldberg contraptions, with long metal chutes, allowing Crawford to place a metal ball at the top and watch it move through a series of passages, all connected, much like a large version of the game ""Mousetrap"". When he realizes his wife is cheating on him, he decides to shoot her and comes up with a way to get through all of the legal challenges and hurdles. Presumably, studying these contraptions helps him work through all of the possible variations.As the story progresses, Hopkins manages to add some nice touches to the role, making him seem even more devious and menacing. During a character's testimony, Crawford, who has chosen to represent himself, doodles on a yellow legal pad, periodically ripping the pages from the pad. Each time he tears off a sheet, the sound reverberates through the quiet courtroom, causing Beachum to turn his attention to the defendant.Ryan Gosling does a great job as Willie Beachum, the Assistant District Attorney who gladly accepts a high paying job at one of the most respected law firms in Los Angeles. Beachum is cocky and trying to move beyond his roots; he grew up poor in Oklahoma and now has a load of debt from law school. He clearly always saw the District Attorney's office as a stepping-stone and is now glad to be leaving it. When he meets with his boss (played by David Strathairn), a comment is made about Willie's high conviction rate and the lengths he would go to get it. Willie is a complicated guy and not beyond inflating the truth or maneuvering things to benefit his goals.When he meets his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamunde Pike), he is instantly attracted to her and they flirt. This is yet another example of his cockiness, because he knows he is good looking and doesn't care if he flirts with his new boss. The fact that this leads to the film's biggest plot hole is beyond the point. because he is so brazen about it, this adds significantly to his character.He strides into the courtroom and decides to prosecute Ted's case, despite his impending new job, because he considers it a slam-dunk. Ted signed a confession, there was no one else in the house, and how could he lose? Then, Ted begins to pull the strings and manipulate everything and everyone.To a lesser extent, David Strathairn adds significance as District Attorney Lobruto, Willie's boss. From the moment Lobruto walks into Beachum's office to confront him, we see that Lobruto has world-weariness to him. As an elected public official, he is aware of what little he can accomplish and accepts everything else with ease. He has been beaten down by the system and takes his young Assistant DA's defection with the slightest disgruntlement. But he understands. If he had the same chance, he would probably take it.Embeth Davidtz, Rosamunde Pike, Billy Burke, Bob Gunton and Fiona Shaw all play supporting characters, some with greater success and greater impact, but they all add to the texture of the story, making it interesting to watch.""Fracture"" is not a great film, but it is fun to watch all of the twists and turns, the machinations Hopkins' character puts everyone through. For it to be a great film, Hopkins would have to add something different to his character. Is it just me or does it seem odd that Crawford is playing mind games with a poor guy from the South, who came from a questionable background? Does Beachum's background sound familiar to anyone else? Did they ask Jodie Foster to take the role before she refused it because it was too similar to Clarice Starling? Gosling does a good job with the role, but Hopkins is such a great actor and this role is not a stretch that it seems like a disappointment.",3,Hopkins and Gosling Elevate This Routine

When Crawford butts heads with district attorney Willy Beachum it seems like a perfect case for both of them; Crawford discovers that Willy has accepted a job with a major corporate law firm which indicates that his head won't be in the game: Willy sees the case as a slum dunk because he has a written confession, the murder weapon and motive. Crawford and Beachum begin a battle of wits with each trying to out think the other to achieve their goals.END OF SPOILERS**The film looks very nice in its DVD transfer. We get minimal extras here including deleted scenes and alternate endings that differ only slightly from the final version that we see. Whenever a film has multiple endings like this it usually means trouble for the film; a director and the writers usually know where they want to go with the story and have a solid beginning and end. It's the journey between the two that can often be the difficult part here. With a beautiful set up, ""Fracture"" falters in between. The film really demanded a stronger ending as well although the final version does work quite well because of the weak 2nd and 3rd acts, it doesn't deliver the way it should.""Fracture"" is entertaining and worthwhile renting particularly if you are a fan of either of the lead actors and both leads give terrific performances it's just a pity that they aren't in a better film.",3,"""Even a clock is right twice a day""...""Fracture"" is a broken thriller with some strong performances",1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,2513,"['Fractured', 'tone', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Playing', 'cross', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Fracture', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'one', 'films', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'do', 'raise', '2', 'star', 'thriller', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'two', 'advesaries', 'face', 'off', 'other', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'Fallen', 'Frequency', 'guy', 'things', 'titles', 'f', 'writers', 'Daniel', 'Pyne', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Glenn', 'Gers', 'Cybill', 'squander', 'film', 'potential', 'laying', 'out', 'story', 'linear', 'straight', 'forward', 'fashion', 'result', 'surprises', 'slight', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'film', 'up', 'line', 'Hopkins', 'film', 'Even', 'broken', 'clock', 'right', 'twice', 'day', 'broken', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'more', 'often', 'storytelling', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'skillful.SPOILERS**Ted', 'Crawford', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wealthy', 'aviation', 'designer', 'When', 'wife', 'Embeth', 'Davison', 'who', 'completely', 'wasted', 'role', 'having', 'affair', 'decision', 'kill', 'plan', 'get', 'away', 'When', 'Crawford', 'heads', 'district', 'attorney', 'Willy', 'Beachum', 'perfect', 'case', 'Crawford', 'Willy', 'accepted', 'job', 'major', 'corporate', 'law', 'firm', 'head', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'game', 'Willy', 'case', 'slum', 'dunk', 'written', 'confession', 'murder', 'weapon', 'motive', 'Crawford', 'Beachum', 'begin', 'battle', 'wits', 'trying', 'think', 'other', 'achieve', 'goals.END', 'SPOILERS**The', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'get', 'minimal', 'extras', 'here', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'differ', 'only', 'slightly', 'final', 'version', 'see', 'Whenever', 'film', 'multiple', 'endings', 'usually', 'trouble', 'film', 'director', 'writers', 'usually', 'know', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'story', 'have', 'solid', 'beginning', 'end', 'journey', 'two', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'difficult', 'part', 'here', 'beautiful', 'set', 'up', 'Fracture', 'falters', 'film', 'really', 'demanded', 'stronger', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'version', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'weak', '2nd', '3rd', 'acts', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'way', 'should', 'Fracture', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'renting', 'particularly', 'are', 'fan', 'lead', 'actors', 'leads', 'give', 'terrific', 'just', 'pity', 'are', ""n't"", 'better', 'film']",N/A

Envolve the same thing other trial films have, the young, vain lawyer who ""doesn't lose"", A love relationship that is ""taboo"" i.e. with the boss, and an ending that is suppose to be a twist, but as expected works out.  I just didn't care for Ryan Gosling role, but I don't think it's all his fault.  And the biggest lesson, walk away, in fact, run away if you get the chance. How stupid can a guy be, if you know your dream job is in jeopardy with what you are doing, and you can stop, Stop.
