So powerful to me, at least, that I have only watched it one other time after my first viewing...even though it's a fine movie.  I wanted to get at least one viewing on a good DVD transfer but a disc of this film has yet to be made as of 2009!Story-wise,  I doubt many people could have done what Orson Welles' character did in this film. Welles, by the way, is outstanding in here. He, Claudette Colbert, George Brent and Richard Long provide some wonderful acting.Long, playing the elder son, presents a tremendous contrast of how a young man acted back in the 1940s compared to nowadays in terms of of respect and manners. The little girl in here is played by Natalie Wood. She has blonde hair and is about five or six years old, and does an impressive job speaking German.This is a real heart-rendering story.

310860,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302413419,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Tomorrow is Forever"" is a post war melodrama about the impact of war on people's lives. It was based on a 1944 novel by Gwen Bristow. This type of film was popular in the 40s, the most famous of which include ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) and ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), although this film is much more than a simple anti-war film about the disruptive effects of war.In this 1946 black and white film, Orson Welles plays a married man who is killed during World War 1 and his widow Claudette Colbert remarries (George Brent), but Welles was merely wounded and when he finally recovers, years later, he returns to find out his former wife had his child, now being raised as Brent's own son (Richard Long in his film debut). To make matters worse, Long wants to enlist in the RAF much to the opposition of Colbert who believes she lost her husband in the first war.FWIW - Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem ""Enoch Arden"" (1864) is the exemplar from which these kinds of films evolved, although one can find the roots ultimately in the tale of Odysseus. Other films to use this theme include the screwball comedy ""My Favorite Wife"" (1941) as well as ""Remember the Day"" (1941) and ""The Man From Yesterday"" (1932) both of which starred Colbert. More recently Tom Hanks' ""Cast Away"" (2000) is another variation on the theme.Orson Welles (1915-85) created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). But someone along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. By 1946, when this film was made, Welles was already in trouble and exhibiting many of the problems that would unhinge his career. But in this film he gives one of his finest performances and it's really good to watch.BTW - Welles was one of the finest actors to ever appear, so watching one of his finest performances is watching the best of the very best.Claudette Colbert (1903-96) won the Oscar in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night"" and was nominated in 1936 (Private Worlds"") and 1945 (""Since You Went Away""). In 1987 she won the Golden Globe for a TV show ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", her last film. In her 50 years of performing, she made more than 50 films, though 35 of them were in the 30s and included such memorable films as ""Cleopatra"" (1934), ""Under Two Flags"" (1936), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939). She is the real star of this film and her performance is excellent.George Brent (1899-1979) is best known as the frequent co-star with Bette Davis in 13 films although he was also very close with Garbo. His memorable films include ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""Dark Victory"" (1939), and ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1945).This was the third film for child star Natalie Wood (1938-81) who would achieve her breakout in ""Miracle on 47th Street"" (1947) and go on to be nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Rebel without a Cause"", ""Splendor in the Grass"", ""Love with the Proper Stranger""). Wood plays a little girl adopted by Welles during his stint in Europe.FWIW - Welles and Wood had a real bond, which you can plainly see on film. Welles said she was ""so good she was terrifying"" and Wood said ""I found him most kind.""Irving Pichel (1891-1954) directs. He was an actor (70+ films) and director (30+ films) who is best known for this film and for ""The Pied Piper"" (1942) and ""A Medal for Benny"" (1945). He cast Wood in her first film, ""Happy Land"" (1943) and he came up with her theatre name, giving her the name ""Wood"" as a token to his good friend Sam Wood.Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) does a great job in this tear jerker. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.In 1946 the biggest hits were ""Song of the South"", ""Duel in the Sun"", ""The Best Years of our Lives"", ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", and ""Blue Skies"". The big Oscar winner was ""The Best Years of our Lives"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor). Other notable films were Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Bogart and Bacall in ""The Big Sleep"", Burt Lancaster in ""The Killers"", and ""The Yearling"". Very few war films came out in 1946.The NY Times' caustic Bosley Crowther called it ""a straight piece of Hollywood taffy, slightly saline and gooey clear through."" In lesser hands, this film might have been a melodrama, but with the great performances of Welles, Colbert, Brent, and even Wood, it achieves a much higher level.By today's tastes the film may seem overly romantic and sometimes even preachy, but by the standards of the mid 40s it isn't. In addition, contemporary viewers may find the plot a little far-fetched - how would a woman not recognize her husband, even after war and even after 20 years? The fact is, in the past, wars dramatically changed people's appearance, not only due to the injuries but also the poor medical care, poor aftercare, presence of all sorts of post traumatic diseases, and even more telling, the impact of malnutrition.So, put aside the 40s melodramatic feel of the film and put aside your skepticism about the ravages of war, and just sit back and watch a truly inspiring films with great performances.",5,Great film with excellent performances,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,5504,"['Tomorrow', 'Forever', 'post', 'war', 'melodrama', 'impact', 'war', 'people',

310861,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302413419,Ed Uyeshima,"[17, 18]","Despite the movie's Harlequin-level romance novel title, the unlikely pairing of classic Hollywood leading lady Claudette Colbert and resident bad-boy Orson Welles actually works in this intriguing albeit far-fetched 1946 melodrama directed by the relatively undistinguished Irving Pichel. Written by Lenore J. Coffee, the plot concentrates initially on newly married John and Elizabeth McDonald, who are suddenly separated when he enlists for combat duty during WWI. Just as she discovers she is pregnant, Elizabeth receives word that John is dead, but the truth is that he is so badly injured that he doesn't want to return to her as a cripple. Once recovered, he takes on the guise of an Austrian scientist named Erik Kessler. Twenty years elapse, and Elizabeth has remarried to businessman Larry Hamilton, who has coincidentally recruited Kessler to test the company's new product formula. Elizabeth meets Kessler but does not recognize him to be her long lost John due to plastic surgery. However, John knows her, and they become intertwined again when their son Drew decides to enlist in the RAF years before the U.S. enters WWII.The story sounds preposterous on paper, but it is quite compelling to see the movie evolve toward its inevitable resolution. Colbert is her naturally effervescent self, though she is well into her forties here and a mite too mature for the early scenes when she is playing a blushing newlywed to the twelve-years younger Welles. Nonetheless, she provides surprising bite to the scenes where Elizabeth confronts her own prejudices about war. In the juiciest role, Welles has a field day as the crippled, defeated Kessler as he keeps his naturally grandiose manner in check. Perennial also-ran George Brent is wooden as expected as Hamilton, but a couple of familiar faces shine as the children - Richard Long as the grown Drew and an eight-year old Natalie Wood, blonde and sporting a convincing Austrian accent, as Kessler's adopted daughter Margaret. There are some lapses in credibility beginning with Elizabeth's inability to recognize John and ending with her rather sudden resignation that John is right in his perspective on the past. Regardless, it's a surprisingly involving movie with a mature perspective on love and war, a curio sadly forgotten today and well worth a look now.",4,Preposterous But Eminently Watchable Melodrama Thanks Mainly to an Enigmatic Welles,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,2324,"['movie', 'Harlequin-level', 'romance', 'novel', 'title', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'lady', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'resident', 'bad-boy', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'far-fetched', '1946', 'melodrama', 'directed', 'relatively', 'undistinguished', 'Irving', 'Pichel', 'Written', 'Lenore', 'J', 'Coffee', 'plot', 'initially', 'newly', 'married', 'John', 'Elizabeth', 'McDonald', 'who', 'are', 'suddenly', 'separated', 'when', 'combat', 'duty', 'WWI', 'Just', 'pregnant', 'Elizabeth', 'word', 'John', 'dead', 'truth', 'so', 'badly', 'injured', ""n't"", 'want', 'return', 'cripple', 'Once', 'recovered', 'guise', 'Austrian', 'scientist', 'named', 'Erik', 'Kessler', 'Twenty', 'years', 'elapse', 'Elizabeth', 'remarried', 'businessman', 'Larry', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'recruited', 'Kessler', 'test', 'company', 'new', 'product', 'formula', 'Elizabeth', 'Kessler', 'not', 'recognize', 'be', 'long', 'lost', 'John', 'due', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'However', 'John', 'become', 'intertwined', 'again', 'when', 'son', 'Drew', 'enlist', 'RAF', 'years', 'U.S.', 'enters', 'WWII.The', 'story', 'preposterous', 'paper', 'quite', 'compelling', 'see', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'resolution', 'Colbert', 'naturally', 'effervescent', 'self', 'well', 'forties', 'here', 'mite', 'too', 'mature', 'early', 'scenes', 'when', 'playing', 'blushing', 'newlywed', 'twelve-years', 'younger', 'Welles', 'Nonetheless', 'surprising', 'bite', 'scenes', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'own', 'prejudices', 'war', 'juiciest', 'role', 'Welles', 'field', 'day', 'crippled', 'defeated', 'Kessler', 'naturally', 'grandiose', 'manner', 'check', 'Perennial', 'also-ran', 'George', 'Brent', 'wooden', 'as', 'expected', 'Hamilton', 'couple', 'familiar', 'shine', 'children', 'Richard', 'Long', 'grown', 'Drew', 'eight-year', 'old', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'blonde', 'sporting', 'convincing', 'Austrian', 'accent', 'Kessler', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Margaret', 'are', 'lapses', 'credibility', 'beginning', 'Elizabeth', 'inability', 'recognize', 'John', 'ending', 'rather', 'sudden', 'resignation', 'John', 'right', 'perspective', 'past', 'Regardless', 'surprisingly', 'involving', 'movie', 'mature', 'perspective', 'love', 'war', 'curio', 'sadly', 'forgotten', 'today', 'well', 'look', 'now']",Tomorrow Is Forever VHS

Westbrook ""GTW""","[1, 1]","A brief review of the movie: &#8220;Tomorrow Is Forever.&#8221;I had lost track of this movie, even lost the title, until a recent showing on TV brought it to life.  When I searched for it, I inevitably ran into the movie &#8220;Since You Went Away.&#8221; Both of these movies are outstanding.Tomorrow Is Forever tells the story of a married soldier, John  (Orson Welles), in WWI, returning after years away due to battle injuries and extensive facial surgery. Before he leaves Germany he adopts the eight year old daughter (Natalie Wood) of the surgeon who saved his life, but was soon killed by the emerging Nazis. His wife, Elizabeth (Claudette Colbert), had been told he was dead, and at some point down the road she has married someone else. When Orson Welles contacted Elizabeth, and her new family, he kept his past to himself. This was an incredibly difficult task, but he pulled it off.This movie starts with WWI and ends at the start of WWII. Elizabeth&#8217;s son, and many of his school friends, are sold on the idea to travel to Canada and enroll in the Royal Air Force (RAF). As one who is writing a book on these two wars this coverage is of particular interest. One of my uncles enrolled in the RAF as Canada did not have an air corp in 1939 -1940 period. This movie ends with Welles deciding not to reveal his true identity. This was also an incredibly difficult task, but he pulled it off.

310876,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,6302413419,Marvin D. Pipher,"[4, 5]","I first saw this film when it was released in 1946 and have never forgotten it.  Perhaps it made such a lasting impression on my youthful mind simply because of the war, but I'm sure much of it was due to the film's intriguing plot and the fascinating interplay between the film's two main characters: played by Orson Wells and Claudette Colbert.The film is set in the mid to late 1930s, sometime before the United States was drawn into World War II and plays on the fact that a generation had passed between the end of World War One and the beginning of the Second World War; enough time for a young man born at the end of the first war to `almost' be of an age to fight in the next one.  And that is the nub of this story.  For, as those old enough to remember will surely recall: Although America wasn't in the war at that time, many young men in their late teens opted to leave college and join either England's Royal Air Force (RAF) or the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in order to fight the Nazis.In this film, Claudette Colbert's son is just such a fellow, and since she believes her husband to have been killed in the first Great War she was terrified at the thought of also losing her son to the next one.  Then, unbeknownst to her; her crippled husband with a heavy foreign accent suddenly returns from Germany along with his supposed daughter: played by Natalie Woods in her first important role.  The scene is thus set for a dramatic, intriguing and, in my case, an unforgettable film.Orson Wells described it as a ""trivial little thing,"" but I beg to differ, and I think you will too; especially if you love movies with well-thought-out plots, fascinating characters, and intriguing dialog.  If you do, you'll certainly enjoy this one.  As for me, I'm still trying to figure out if Claudette Colbert's character ever fully realized that Wells' character was in fact her long-lost husband.

310877,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302413419,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Tomorrow Is Forever is one of the finest movies I&#8217;ve ever seen. The actors give excellent, convincing performances. In addition, the choreography and cinematography reflect good forethought and the use of lighting greatly helps to enhance the mood of each and every scene as well as emotions on the character&#8217;s faces. The sets are detailed and the musical score enhances the film, too. I should add that this is quite an emotional movie&#8212;keep a box of tissues handy in case you&#8217;re the type who sheds a tear or two while watching a most poignant and meaningful film that is somewhat melancholy! And how this film deals with self-sacrifice on the part of a war veteran so the people he loves can live the best lives he thinks they possibly can!When the action starts, we meet young John Andrew MacDonald (Orson Welles) and his new wife Elizabeth (Claudette Colbert) in Baltimore; they are newlyweds but much to the chagrin of Elizabeth they must say good-bye, John wants to fight in World War One. Unfortunately, John is badly wounded in combat. When John is found and taken to a hospital where the kindly Dr. Ludwig (John Wengraf) takes care of him, John has no papers on him and he refuses to tell Dr. Ludwig his real identity; John loves Elizabeth so much that he cannot bear to make her go through life with him being so badly maimed from his wounds. John even begs Dr. Ludwig to let him die but Dr. Ludwig refuses! Thus Elizabeth gets a telegram on Armistice Day that John was killed a few days before the war ended and the stress is too much for her to bear; she faints and is taken to the home of her boss, Lawrence Hamilton (George Brent) where she can recover. Eventually Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John&#8217;s baby and who thinks she&#8217;s a war widow, marries Lawrence who loves her even though both Lawrence and Elizabeth know that Elizabeth will never love another man the way she loved John. Elizabeth and Lawrence raise John Andrew MacDonald, Jr. as their own son and they never tell John Jr. (who goes by Drew as he gets older) that Lawrence really isn&#8217;t his father. Lawrence and Elizabeth eventually have a son of their own, too.Quite a few years pass&#8212;and as Germany is getting ready to invade Poland and start World War Two, John Andrew, now going by the name of Erik Kessler and trained in Europe as a scientist, arrives in New York along with Margaret (a very young Natalie Wood), the orphaned daughter of Dr. Ludwig and his wife (Ludwig and his wife were killed by Germans who didn&#8217;t like Ludwig&#8217;s politics). Together Erik and Margaret make their way to Baltimore where Erik gets a job by chance working for Lawrence Hamilton! It isn&#8217;t long before Erik and Elizabeth meet; Erik recognizes Elizabeth immediately and he has quite an emotional reaction&#8212;the look of shock and the many other emotions all at once on his face is worth the price of admission alone! Elizabeth begins to suspect something isn&#8217;t quite right about Erik&#8217;s background; could he actually be her first husband John Andrew MacDonald? Erik denies this but Elizabeth isn&#8217;t so sure. More trouble ensues when twenty year old Drew wants to go to Canada to join the RAF&#8212;Elizabeth is petrified to let him go because she thinks she lost John during World War One.Of course there&#8217;s more to the plot than just this and I&#8217;ll stop here to avoid giving out spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything plays out.Richard Long is terrific as Drew Hamilton.

The only thing I can compare it to is ""Random Harvest"" which was another highly emotional movie about love detoured by a WWI battle injury.  Frankly, I'm not sure I could handle much more emotional tension that what these movies bring to the screen.  In the case of ""Tomorrow is Forever"" we see the story of a happily married man who goes off to war promising his beloved wife that he will return.  We next see him in a German military hospital, face covered with bandages, wanting to die due to the extremity of his wounds.  The wife back home gets a killed in action letter and eventually remarries and begins a new life.  Obviously, the story reunites wife 1 with husband 1 and that is the core of the movie.  This whole scenario is brilliantly set up.  Sure, it's next to impossible.  However, it's so skillfully done that we don't care to disparage the results.  This aspect of the film is what sets it (and ""Random Harvest"" as well) apart from all the other Bette-Davis-soap-opera style, tear-jerkers of the past and present.As the movie reaches its' climax, we have created our own preferred outcomes.  In the end, we are left with (we reluctantly admit) the correct resolution to the dilemna.  We are convinced by the writer, the director, and the awesome acting by Orson Welles and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Claudette Colbert.  The scenes involving these two are taut with emotion and the dialogue is worthy of Welles's talent.  The film's title carries a meaning that is only truly understood after watching the movie.

310885,A2T77ZRDKU6PA0,6302413419,ronzo,"[5, 5]","In its review of TOMORROW IS FOREVER (1946), Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever states ""This slow-moving melodrama wastes a good cast.""I thought it was better than that, but not by much.I should state that I like to watch anything that has Orson Welles in it.  For example, even though THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) is hampered by his attempt at a brogue, it too is also rewatchable.Here Welles plays a husband who returns from WWI, supposedly disfigured beyond recognition; and really all that has changed is he limps, has an injured hand, and has grown a beard.  His wife, played by Claudette Colbert, is completely fooled; but the viewer may find this stretches their suspension of disbelief to its limits.And that would be all right in itself, but the plot centers on Welles' ability to make Colbert believe he is not her husband; and he tries to convince her that her instinct is wrong; and that her suspicion is nothing more than wishful thinking about the past.Regarding the film's construction, I thought it well put together, with a highlight being Max Steiner's music.  If it had any weakness, Colbert's insistence on having herself shot on the same side of her face, (and at the same angle) becomes a little repetitive; because there are many close-ups in this picture.  This lack of cinematographic variety may make all but the most ardent Colbert fan wonder.Still, if you appreciate Orson Welles, Claudette Colbert, or 1940s melodrama, it is not to be missed.  If you have a taste for them all, this may likely become a favorite film.",3,Tomorrow Lasts Forever,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,1548,"['review', 'TOMORROW', 'IS', 'FOREVER', '1946', 'Videohound', 'Golden', 'Movie', 'Retriever', 'slow-moving', 'melodrama', 'good', 'cast', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'not', 'much.I', 'should', 'state', 'like', 'watch', 'anything', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'example', 'even', 'THE', 'LADY', 'FROM', 'SHANGHAI', '1947', 'hampered', 'attempt', 'brogue', 'too', 'also', 'rewatchable.Here', 'Welles', 'husband', 'who', 'WWI', 'supposedly', 'disfigured', 'recognition', 'really', 'changed', 'limps', 'injured', 'hand', 'grown', 'beard', 'wife', 'played', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'completely', 'fooled', 'viewer', 'may', 'find', 'stretches', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'limits.And', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'plot', 'centers', 'Welles', 'ability', 'make', 'Colbert', 'believe', 'not', 'husband', 'convince', 'instinct', 'wrong', 'suspicion', 'nothing', 'more', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'past.Regarding', 'film', 'construction', 'thought', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'highlight', 'being', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'music', 'had', 'weakness', 'Colbert', 'insistence', 'having', 'shot', 'same', 'side', 'face', 'same', 'angle', 'little', 'repetitive', 'are', 'many', 'close-ups', 'picture', 'lack', 'cinematographic', 'variety', 'may', 'make', 'most', 'ardent', 'Colbert', 'fan', 'wonder.Still', 'appreciate', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', '1940s', 'melodrama', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'have', 'taste', 'may', 'likely', 'become', 'favorite', 'film']",Tomorrow Is Forever VHS

310888,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302413419,Simon Davis,"[76, 77]","I find with each viewing of the classic ""Tomorrow Is Forever"" I find I like the production more and more. It is such a totally rich film in so many ways, whether it be the sterling central performance from Claudette Colbert in what I'm convinced is one of her finest performances,  Orson Welles's charmed under playing of a role that could have been simply sentimental, or the haunting anti-war message it puts forward in its telling of life through two world wars.""Tomorrow Is Forever"" has so much to offer to the viewer in so many different ways. Claudette Colbert always a favourite actress of mine proves once and for all what a superb dramatic actress she can be. Long regarded as one of the premier comedy actresses of the 1930's and 40's here she excels in the role of a young bride who believes she has lost her husband in WW1 action only to find that years later after she has re married that a stranger who comes into her families life gives her a eerie sense that that might not be the case. In this film she is at times touchingly lovely, stubborn, full of anger and full of hope, in short she has a wonderful well rounded character to work with and she makes the most of it.Claudette is blessed with two excellent leading men in this production in Orson Welles and George Brent. Welles, so often prone to bellicose overplaying of roles that require a bit of restraint, here delivers a beautiful modulated performance as Claudette's first husband who seemingly has come back from the grave. His scenes after he has returned to Colbert's home are wonderful and full of tension as to whether he will reveal his real identity. The conclusion of the film is a tour de force for Welles as he decides to sacrifice his own potential happiness and  to remain a mystery to the family and tells Colbert that ""Tomorrow is forever and not to look back to a romantised past"". George Brent, so often stiff on screen here delivers one of his best performances as the man who has loved Claudette through two world wars and provides her with the home and family she craves so much. He is entirely believable and warm in his playing and he and Colbert reveal a wonderful chemistry in their playing together. Natalie Wood also makes a rare childhood appearance in this film as an Austrian orphan, the daughter of the doctor who saved Welles's life but was killed by the Nazi's, who Welles adapts and brings to America. She is a delight in her scenes and you can see the tremendous acting talent that she possessed even at this early age. Richard Long playes Welles's and Colbert's son who doesn't know the identity of his real father and brings great depth to his playing of the treasured son who comes into conflict with Colbert over his decision to join the fighting early in WW2 thus causing history to repeat itself.""Tomorrow Is Forever"" can be regarded as a real tear drenced drama for the matinee crowd however its worth goes way beyond that. It covers many issues just as relevant today such as those about the human cost of war, the issue of whether we should involve ourselves in others problems and whether we should allow our past experiences to rule how we behave. It is a beautifully put together drama full of rich performances that really stay in your mind. I'm quite surprised that this wonderful film is not better remembered today. I sense that it has been forgotten because of the more famous roles that all the main performers have undertaken. Claudette Colbert in particular is totally awe inspiring in her dramatic delivery of the tortured young bride who has been robbed of her life and spends a lifetime trying to recapture it. She will have you alternately crying, laughing and saying ""bravo"" up to the wonderous finale.I cannot recommend ""Tomorrow Is Forever"" highly enough. For all those who enjoy well acted dramas with fine writing, a non preaching message and performers delivering often unexpectedly restrained acting work, none come finer than the anti-war ""Tomorrow Is Forever"".",5,Beautifully put together drama for Colbert and Welles,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,4004,"['find', 'viewing', 'classic', 'Tomorrow', 'Forever', 'find', 'production', 'more', 'more', 'such', 'totally', 'rich', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'be', 'sterling', 'central', 'performance', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'what', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'charmed', 'playing', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'sentimental', 'haunting', 'anti-war', 'message', 'forward', 'telling', 'life', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'Tomorrow', 'Forever', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'viewer', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'always', 'favourite', 'actress', 'mine', 'proves', 'once', 'what', 'superb', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'can', 'be', 'Long', 'regarded', 'one', 'premier', 'comedy', 'actresses', '1930', '40', 'here', 'role', 'young', 'bride', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'WW1', 'action', 'only', 'find', 'years', 'later', 're', 'married', 'stranger', 'who', 'families', 'life', 'eerie', 'sense', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'film', 'times', 'touchingly', 'lovely', 'stubborn', 'full', 'anger', 'full', 'hope', 'short', 'wonderful', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'work', 'most', 'it.Claudette', 'blessed', 'two', 'excellent', 'leading', 'men', 'production', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'George', 'Brent', 'Welles', 'so', 'often', 'prone', 'bellicose', 'overplaying', 'roles', 'require', 'bit', 'restraint', 'here', 'beautiful', 'modulated', 'performance', 'Claudette', 'first', 'husband', 'who', 'seemingly', 'come', 'back', 'grave', 'scenes', 'returned', 'Colbert', 'home', 'are', 'wonderful', 'full', 'tension', 'will', 'reveal', 'real', 'identity', 'conclusion', 'film', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Welles', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'potential', 'happiness', 'remain', 'mystery', 'family', 'tells', 'Colbert', 'Tomorrow', 'forever', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'romantised', 'past', 'George', 'Brent', 'so', 'often', 'stiff', 'screen', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'Claudette', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'home', 'family', 'so', 'much', 'entirely', 'believable', 'warm', 'playing', 'Colbert', 'reveal', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'playing', 'together', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'also', 'rare', 'childhood', 'appearance', 'film', 'Austrian', 'orphan', 'daughter', 'doctor', 'who', 'saved', 'Welles', 'life', 'was', 'killed', 'Nazi', 'who', 'adapts', 'brings', 'America', 'delight', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'talent', 'possessed', 'even', 'early', 'age', 'Richard', 'Long', 'playes', 'Welles', 'Colbert', 'son', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'identity', 'real', 'father', 'great', 'depth', 'playing', 'treasured', 'son', 'who', 'conflict', 'Colbert', 'decision', 'join', 'fighting', 'early', 'WW2', 'thus', 'causing', 'history', 'repeat', 'Tomorrow', 'Forever', 'can', 'be', 'regarded', 'real', 'tear', 'drenced', 'drama', 'matinee', 'crowd', 'however', 'worth', 'way', 'many', 'issues', 'just', 'relevant', 'today', 'such', 'human', 'cost', 'war', 'issue', 'should', 'involve', 'ourselves', 'others', 'problems', 'should', 'allow', 'past', 'experiences', 'rule', 'how', 'behave', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together', 'drama', 'full', 'rich', 'performances', 'really', 'stay', 'mind', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised', 'wonderful', 'film', 'not', 'better', 'remembered', 'today', 'sense', 'been', 'forgotten', 'more', 'famous', 'roles', 'main', 'performers', 'have', 'undertaken', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'particular', 'totally', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'dramatic', 'delivery', 'tortured', 'young', 'bride', 'who', 'been', 'robbed', 'life', 'lifetime', 'trying', 'recapture', 'will', 'have', 'alternately', 'crying', 'laughing', 'saying', 'bravo', 'up', 'wonderous', 'finale.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Tomorrow', 'Forever', 'highly', 'enough', 'who', 'enjoy', 'well', 'acted', 'dramas', 'fine', 'writing', 'non', 'preaching', 'message', 'performers', 'delivering', 'often', 'unexpectedly', 'restrained', 'acting', 'work', 'none', 'come', 'finer', 'anti-war', 'Tomorrow', 'Forever']",Tomorrow Is Forever VHS
