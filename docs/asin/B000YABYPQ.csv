This time he's trying to prove that his great grandfather wasn't involved with the assasination of our president Abraham Lincoln. They also discover along the way that there is a treasure involved. That (of course this has to happen) makes someone else want the same treasure. With his dad, Riley, and his girlfriend, who will come out on top?I enjoyed the sequal to National Treasure. It's full of action again and has a good plot to it. However, the first one (as always) is clearly a better movie. The ""bad guys"" in the second movie don't appear to be ""on the chase"" as bad as Eon and his gang in the first movie. Sure they want the treasure pretty bad, but it doesn't seem that they want it as much as Eon did.Overall, though this is a great sequal to the first National Treasure. If you enjoyed watching the first one, then I recommend getting the sequal.",4,"Not as good as first, but still good",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,917,"['Nicholis', 'Cage', 'back', 'sequal', 'National', 'Treasure', 'time', 'trying', 'prove', 'great', 'grandfather', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'assasination', 'president', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'also', 'discover', 'way', 'treasure', 'involved', 'course', 'happen', 'someone', 'else', 'want', 'same', 'treasure', 'dad', 'Riley', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'enjoyed', 'sequal', 'National', 'Treasure', 'full', 'action', 'again', 'good', 'plot', 'However', 'first', 'one', 'always', 'clearly', 'better', 'movie', 'bad', 'guys', 'second', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'chase', 'as', 'bad', 'Eon', 'gang', 'first', 'movie', 'Sure', 'want', 'treasure', 'pretty', 'bad', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'as', 'much', 'Eon', 'did.Overall', 'great', 'sequal', 'first', 'National', 'Treasure', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'recommend', 'getting', 'sequal']",N/A

Continuing the treasure hunt (again with a decidedly patriotic thrust) Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) leads his globe trotting entourage to Paris, London`s Buckingham Palace, and even inside the most intimate desk drawers of the Oval Office.  This time clues are sprinkled around the Western Hemisphere in Native American language, sending Ben and his sidekicks, Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), to retrieve them and find the Lost City of Gold.While I liked the first 'National Treasure,' suspension of disbelief needs even more audience participation with this effort.  (When Riley sets up a surveillance center from a bathroom stall in Buckingham Palace, well, you just have to decide to go along for the ride.)  I found their first excursion preposterous, but I loved the characters and the caper.  I still do, but this time the tension is diminished and the destination is even less to anticipate than its predecessor.  And, while Ben Gates is no Jason Bourne, the movie has the necessary irreverence to poke fun of itself.  (""I went to Buckingham Palace, and all I got was this old piece of wood."")  They have to, after all, to gain some credibility.In this installment (the receipts do suggest another sequel) Ben must clear the name of an ancestor, Thomas Gates, who is linked by an artifact that implicates him with a scheme to obtain gold and help the confederacy win the Civil War.  While reenacting Lincoln's assassination at the Ford Theater, a member of The Knights of the Southern Circle, confronts Thomas at a local tavern and forces him at gunpoint to decode a message aimed at getting a cache of valuable gold that would overthrow the Union's victory.Fast-forward to the present...and joining them on the trail are Ben's professorial father (Jon Voight) and his language expert mother (Helen Mirren).  Instead of an anonymous front of security personnel, we get two greedy FBI agents (Ed Harris and Harvey Keitel) who follow our scholarly crew closely to get to the treasure first and make their claim for fame and fortune.`National Treasure 2' may be insubstantial, but it does offer some rewards.  With a relaxing, no-brainer plot and an admirably uplifting, patriotic execution, the film won't inspire refunds, but it's not as hefty as 'The Bourne Ultimatum' or anything from the 'Indiana Jones' franchise.  (I loved a London car chase scene even if I've seen most of the tricks before.) As a substandard adventure, the movie goes down easily, has some breezy irreverence, and sports a fine performance by Helen Mirren, whom I didn't even recognize with an American accent until the final credits.  Sometimes this piece of fools' gold can be fun.My recommendation:  Save this one for Flag Day, Independence Day, or one of those wet, rainy days or when you're too tired to think.

1117667,A1P4APIZD79ZQC,B000YABYPQ,"97XBAM ""The Future of Roll and Roll""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this movie despite the poorly written villian part played by Ed Harris . First off the southern accent done by the New Jersey born Harris was awful , then when he teams up with Cage and company he tells him he framed his ancestor to get him to help find the lost city -which makes no sense since he tried to kill him in Europe to steal a clue before that . In the first movie there was no doubt that Ian the villian , despite teaming up with the heroes again , was going to off them after finding the treasure . The Wilkinson character is good , then bad , but only because he's trying to clear his family's good name . The writers tried to make him a sympathetic figure near the end , but after kidnapping , blackmail and attempted murder I can't imagine anyone having any sympathy at all for this character . Why can't Hollywood just let a villian be evil for evil's own sake these days ? They do the same thing with the spiderman movies - Goblin/Dr. Octopus/Sandman/Venom aren't really bad , but were driven to evil by 'insert reason here' .Anyway getting by that there was much more good than bad in this sequel , especially the addition of Helen Mirren as the estranged wife of Patrick Gates . As in the first movie Ben Gates was clever to the point of a genius with a photographic memory , Riley was funny , especially amusing was every nutty conspiracy theory in his non-selling book seeming to be true having been bought (apparently the only copy sold) by fair minded FBI agent Sadusky , once again played by Harvey Keitel .The question asked of Ben Gates by the president near the end strongly hinted at a third installment . If there's a villian in that one , hopefully he'll be a straight up baddie motivated by greed and power and not a conflicted , convoluted mess of motivations . Despite that one flaw in this movie , I recommend it and will be going to the theater to see the next installment should there be one .",4,"Enjoyable sequel , weak villian .",1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,1947,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'poorly', 'written', 'villian', 'part', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'First', 'southern', 'accent', 'done', 'New', 'Jersey', 'born', 'Harris', 'was', 'awful', 'then', 'when', 'up', 'Cage', 'company', 'framed', 'ancestor', 'get', 'help', 'find', 'lost', 'city', '-which', 'sense', 'tried', 'kill', 'Europe', 'steal', 'clue', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'doubt', 'villian', 'teaming', 'up', 'heroes', 'again', 'was', 'going', 'off', 'finding', 'treasure', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'good', 'then', 'bad', 'only', 'trying', 'clear', 'family', 'good', 'name', 'writers', 'tried', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'end', 'kidnapping', 'blackmail', 'attempted', 'murder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'having', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'just', 'let', 'villian', 'be', 'evil', 'evil', 'own', 'sake', 'days', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'spiderman', 'movies', 'Goblin/Dr', 'Octopus/Sandman/Venom', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'were', 'driven', 'evil', ""'insert"", 'reason', 'here', '.Anyway', 'getting', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'sequel', 'especially', 'addition', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Patrick', 'Gates', 'first', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'was', 'clever', 'point', 'genius', 'photographic', 'memory', 'Riley', 'was', 'funny', 'especially', 'amusing', 'was', 'nutty', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'non-selling', 'book', 'seeming', 'be', 'true', 'having', 'been', 'bought', 'apparently', 'only', 'copy', 'sold', 'fair', 'minded', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sadusky', 'once', 'again', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', '.The', 'question', 'asked', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'president', 'end', 'strongly', 'hinted', 'third', 'installment', 'villian', 'one', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'straight', 'up', 'baddie', 'motivated', 'greed', 'power', 'not', 'conflicted', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'motivations', 'one', 'flaw', 'movie', 'recommend', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'theater', 'see', 'next', 'installment', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'one']",N/A

But don't get too attached to this, apart from the beginning and the very end it hardly comes up at all.

It is at least as good. And like with the first one, you can't help wishing it were all true, and there really was a huge City of Gold hidden somewhere. But these folks don't want to melt it down for ingots; they want to return it to its rightful owners (the Native Americans) in reparations for stealing their land. Noble, that.With esoteric knowledge of symbols, arcane parts of history, lost languages, and lots of other things the rest of us know little about, a pretty plausible story is put together about the lost city and how it is tied into the assassination of President Lincoln, the Statues (yes, plural!) of Liberty, the President's desk, and Monticello. Confused? You're supposed to be.Lots of high-tech equipment put together in the service of the quest, lots of high-speed, crash-filled chases, and running from a variety of authority figures. Even the President (who does not look like Bush or McCain or Obama) gets involved, but I won't spoil it by telling you how. It is his desk, after all.It's fun, but it's not very profound.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 7]","I admit that watching the first NATIONAL TREASURE movie was a guilty pleasure, but here ends my enjoyment of anything National or Treasure. Sequels are tough to pull off (can anyone say ""Indiana Jones 4?"") and one has to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump them out even when the script fails on almost every level ...and such was the case with National Treasure 2.If anyone can tell me how finding this new treasure helped solve the Gates family's problem related to their relatives' association with the Lincoln assassination, please let me know. Because that was what this film was all about, right? I mean, we start off with Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch,The Legend of Bagger Vance) being approached by the men who set up President Lincoln's assassination, who in turn kill Thomas for refusing to give up the secrets to an ancient language in a document they have. We then move on to the current day where this document comes to the attention of the Gates family by the sinister Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who presents his evidence that Thomas Gates was the mastermind behind Lincoln's death. So Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage,Ghost Rider), his father Patrick (Jon Voight,Transformers), Ben's estranged wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Ben's trusty friend and sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha,Failure to Launch) head out to clear the family name by finding the lost treasure of pre-America. But how, exactly, this will clean-up their family name isn't clear ...or even explained. A pretty big hole in the story's central plot.This plot hole combined with everything we've already seen in the previous NATIONAL TREASURE film makes this second installment tedious and full of non-surprises.The only positive spin the film can claim is Justin Bartha's Riley character who infuses almost all of the comedy by having a monopoly on the best lines (""Ben, if it were you trying to convince me, you'd have less evidence and I'd already believe you by now."").But that's it. Even the dastardly character Mitch Wilkinson (Harris) doesn't stay dastardly; only moments before he turns ""good"" he was holding a knife to Ben's mother's neck (Helen Mirren,The Queen), making his character completely unbelievable now. Gah!National Treasure 2 is a true disaster, with such poor characterization and plotting that it makes the entire film feel like it's laced with fool's gold with nary a piece of treasure in sight.",2,Umm ...Does Anyone Know How Finding The Treasure Would Clear The Gates Family Name?,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,2391,"['admit', 'watching', 'first', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'movie', 'was', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'here', 'enjoyment', 'anything', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Sequels', 'are', 'tough', 'pull', 'off', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '4', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'pump', 'out', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'almost', 'level', 'such', 'was', 'case', 'National', 'Treasure', '2.If', 'anyone', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'finding', 'new', 'treasure', 'helped', 'solve', 'Gates', 'family', 'problem', 'related', 'relatives', 'association', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'was', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'mean', 'start', 'off', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'being', 'approached', 'men', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'who', 'turn', 'kill', 'Thomas', 'refusing', 'give', 'up', 'secrets', 'ancient', 'language', 'document', 'have', 'then', 'move', 'current', 'day', 'where', 'document', 'attention', 'Gates', 'family', 'sinister', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'evidence', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'was', 'mastermind', 'Lincoln', 'death', 'So', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'father', 'Patrick', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Transformers', 'Ben', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Ben', 'trusty', 'friend', 'sidekick', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'head', 'out', 'clear', 'family', 'name', 'finding', 'lost', 'treasure', 'pre-America', 'how', 'exactly', 'will', 'clean-up', 'family', 'name', ""n't"", 'clear', 'even', 'explained', 'pretty', 'big', 'hole', 'story', 'central', 'plot.This', 'plot', 'hole', 'combined', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'previous', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'film', 'second', 'installment', 'tedious', 'full', 'non-surprises.The', 'only', 'positive', 'spin', 'film', 'can', 'claim', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Riley', 'character', 'who', 'almost', 'comedy', 'having', 'monopoly', 'best', 'lines', 'Ben', 'were', 'trying', 'convince', ""'d"", 'have', 'less', 'evidence', ""'d"", 'already', 'believe', 'now', '.But', 'Even', 'dastardly', 'character', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Harris', ""n't"", 'stay', 'dastardly', 'only', 'moments', 'good', 'was', 'holding', 'knife', 'Ben', 'mother', 'neck', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'making', 'character', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'now', 'Gah', 'National', 'Treasure', '2', 'true', 'disaster', 'such', 'poor', 'characterization', 'plotting', 'entire', 'film', 'feel', 'laced', 'fool', 'gold', 'piece', 'treasure', 'sight']",N/A

The plot bears the disjointed, cobbled-together hallmarks of any script burdened with three (count 'em, three!) different sets of writers on story alone.  (It makes you wonder how many script doctors took a whack at it as well.)  As a result, you never really know what this movie is about.  Is it a romantic adventure?  A Civil War story like National Treasure?  A Spanish Colonial story?  A story about a Blackwater-type CEO who is a mercenary treasure hunter manipulating Cage?  A story about Cage's parents?  The script doesn't know, and neither do we.  As a result, we never really get things moving in a clear manner, which pulls you out of the movie and makes you start trying to figure out what's going on.

How could you go wrong with Nicholas Cage (channeling the early, enjoyable phase of his career), Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris, Jon Voight and Helen Mirren?  Ed Harris did great with what he had to work with.  It would have been a better film if it had been more about Harris and Cage trying to outwit each other, if only because Harris would have had more screen time and a more clearly defined character.This is worth a rent if you liked ""National Treasure"" or like action movies.

1117695,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000YABYPQ,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","Synopsis: Ben Gates and company are back for another exciting and dangerous adventure as they sent off in search of the mythic Olmec City of Gold. The difficulty factor of discovering clues to the location of this sacred site has increased dramatically in comparison to their previous quest. This time the intrepid band must sneak their way into the private chambers of the Queen of England, the Oval Office of the White House and whisk the President of the United States away from FBI security for a private chat. All this activity is but a prelude to uncovering the Book of Secrets.Will Ben (Nicolas Cage), Riley (Justin Bartha), Abigail (Diane Kruger), Partrick (Jon Voight) and Professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) be able to overcome all the obstacles before them and succeed in their endeavor? And what is the secret agenda of the notorious black market dealer in antiquities (Ed Harris) who has accused Ben's Great Grandfather of being one of the co-conspirators in the Lincoln assassination and why is he always close behind following them every step of the way?Critique: `National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets' has a lot of positives; well devised storyline, likeable cast and superior production values. There is however one noticeable problem with this sequel that cannot be ignored, the film borrows much too heavily from the original. We've seen the frenetic car chases and Riley's nerdish ability to tap into even the most sophisticated alarm systems to cause havoc while Ben strolls effortlessly through top security areas. We've also seen the sexual tension and constant banter between Ben and Abigail as well as the ""look at me, I'm here too"" comments by Riley. Even after growing accustomed to seeing all the recycled themes and stunts from the first movie I still found it hard to believe the long troughs of oil and torch scenario would be reused once again in the treasure chamber.My Rating: A little more originality would have been appreciated; -4 Stars-.",4,"""We Pretty Much Make Our Living On Crazy""",1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,1980,"['Synopsis', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'company', 'are', 'back', 'exciting', 'dangerous', 'adventure', 'sent', 'off', 'search', 'mythic', 'Olmec', 'City', 'Gold', 'difficulty', 'factor', 'discovering', 'clues', 'location', 'sacred', 'site', 'increased', 'dramatically', 'comparison', 'previous', 'quest', 'time', 'intrepid', 'band', 'must', 'sneak', 'way', 'private', 'chambers', 'Queen', 'England', 'Oval', 'Office', 'White', 'House', 'whisk', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'away', 'FBI', 'security', 'private', 'chat', 'activity', 'prelude', 'uncovering', 'Book', 'Secrets.Will', 'Ben', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Abigail', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Partrick', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Professor', 'Emily', 'Appleton', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'be', 'able', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'succeed', 'endeavor', 'what', 'secret', 'agenda', 'notorious', 'black', 'market', 'dealer', 'antiquities', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'accused', 'Ben', 'Great', 'Grandfather', 'being', 'one', 'co-conspirators', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'why', 'always', 'close', 'following', 'step', 'way', 'Critique', 'National', 'Treasure', '2', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'lot', 'positives', 'well', 'devised', 'storyline', 'likeable', 'cast', 'superior', 'production', 'values', 'however', 'one', 'noticeable', 'problem', 'sequel', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'film', 'much', 'too', 'heavily', 'original', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'frenetic', 'car', 'chases', 'Riley', 'nerdish', 'ability', 'tap', 'even', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'alarm', 'systems', 'cause', 'havoc', 'Ben', 'effortlessly', 'top', 'security', 'areas', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'sexual', 'tension', 'constant', 'banter', 'Ben', 'Abigail', 'as', 'well', 'look', ""'m"", 'here', 'too', 'comments', 'Riley', 'Even', 'growing', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'recycled', 'themes', 'stunts', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'long', 'troughs', 'oil', 'torch', 'scenario', 'would', 'be', 'reused', 'once', 'again', 'treasure', 'chamber.My', 'Rating', 'little', 'more', 'originality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', '-4', 'Stars-']",N/A

The story line generally flows well although there are a few sections here and there where one is left to wonder about some loose ends, but these are nothing major, just the usual fare for these kinds of movies.  Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors and he is up to the task as the self-effacing, slightly socially awkward, brainy hero Ben Gates who does the right thing.  His love object Diane Kruger (Abigail Chase)is an excellent partner to Gates.  Jon Voight (Gate's father) and Justin Bartha (as Reily Poole, Gates' partner in treasurer hunting) is also very good, particularly as the ""chopped liver"" character who gets the short end of the stick throughout.  The entire process of finding and deciphering clues is very entertaining and convincing and the action scenes (chases, escapes) are good, although somewhat stereotypical.One part that bothers me about these types of movies: the chase scene in London where the chaser and chasee wreck havoc throughout, totalling other vehicles, throwing drivers out of their cars to commandeer them, destroying property left and right, and not a peep from the London police.  I have come to accept these as necessary aspects to keep the action moving.  What I had a major problem with however, was in the interpersonal area, and I will attempt to describe this without spoiling the plot.  Certain changes of personality and reconciliation of relationships were just not believable.  In movies like these, I can much easier believe that the characters can be in Washington, DC one day, in London the next, and in New Hampshire on the third, than I can believe some of the changes of attitude that the directors have asked us to accept.  I think personalities are less malleable, paradoxically, than physical realities but the viewer is asked to go out on a limb, all for the sake of the cliche ""all's well that ends well ending"".  That's too bad.  I think the American public can take a little more of reality and deal with unhappy endings than given credit for.",4,Enjoyable but Asks a Bit Too Much in the Interpersonal,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2107,"['movie', 'was', 'lots', 'fun', 'healthy', 'dose', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'story', 'line', 'generally', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'sections', 'here', 'there', 'where', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'nothing', 'major', 'just', 'usual', 'fare', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'up', 'task', 'self-effacing', 'slightly', 'socially', 'awkward', 'brainy', 'hero', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'who', 'right', 'thing', 'love', 'object', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'excellent', 'partner', 'Gates', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Gate', 'father', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Reily', 'Poole', 'Gates', 'partner', 'treasurer', 'hunting', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'chopped', 'liver', 'character', 'who', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'entire', 'process', 'finding', 'deciphering', 'clues', 'very', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'action', 'scenes', 'chases', 'escapes', 'are', 'good', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical.One', 'part', 'types', 'movies', 'chase', 'scene', 'London', 'where', 'chaser', 'chasee', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'totalling', 'other', 'vehicles', 'throwing', 'drivers', 'cars', 'commandeer', 'destroying', 'property', 'left', 'right', 'not', 'peep', 'London', 'police', 'have', 'come', 'accept', 'necessary', 'aspects', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'What', 'had', 'major', 'problem', 'however', 'was', 'interpersonal', 'area', 'will', 'attempt', 'describe', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'Certain', 'changes', 'personality', 'reconciliation', 'relationships', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'movies', 'can', 'much', 'easier', 'believe', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'Washington', 'DC', 'one', 'day', 'London', 'next', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'third', 'can', 'believe', 'changes', 'attitude', 'directors', 'have', 'asked', 'accept', 'think', 'personalities', 'are', 'less', 'malleable', 'paradoxically', 'physical', 'realities', 'viewer', 'asked', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'sake', 'cliche', 'well', 'well', 'ending', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'American', 'public', 'can', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'reality', 'deal', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'given', 'credit']",N/A

The first thing people need to understand is this is a mix of some history with fiction. Looking at this as historical fact would be like saying what happened in ""Young Indiana Jones"" was all historical fact. Once again puzzles and clues must be deciphered to lead to a large treasure. All the while the family name is under attack, bad guys and the government are in hot pursuit, and clever means of outwitting them all is displayed. This is truly more of the same. The style is very similar and although the locations and some of the people are changed some of the time, it has a distinct feel of sameness which I personally found comforting. this time the story ties the Gates to the assasination of Lincoln, and a Native American treasure. The search for clues leads them to France, England, and even the White House. Fortunately they have a few friends that will make the difference including a familiar face at the FBI. The story was good, the cast great, and the directing, scenery, effects, and music above average.

1117708,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000YABYPQ,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[1, 3]","National Treasure - Book of Secrets is one of those slight, improbable, but good-hearted Saturday-matinee-serial adventure movies, kind of like what Indiana Jones started off being before George Lucas got all clunky and serious. An almost A-list cast (Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren - good lord, Helen Mirren? She must have had the rent coming due, or something! - Harvey Keitel and Ed Harris, backed up by also-rans Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) delivers their lines with a fair degree of conviction and wit, which if it doesn't sparkle with a brilliant diamond shine at least does not flop to the ground, vaguely embarrassing us all for the characters who have to mouth them.The plot is one of those which becomes even more wildly improbable the more you think about it, and the more you know of history; Queen Victoria a Confederate sympathizer? A secret and so far unnoticed message cast into the model for the Statue of Liberty? Secret and so far undiscovered passages underneath Mount Vernon's gardens? And a whole watery subterranean Olmec/Aztec city of gold underneath Mount Rushmore, a good many miles to the north of their known cities and strongholds?  (Don't know how they passed up a chance to have water gush out of Washington's nose; I guess director Jon Turteltaub will distain the obvious, on occasion.)

The historical feature about the Knights of the Golden Circle (who were a real organization, with fortunes which became fatally entwined with the Confederacy) was woefully sketchy.

1117711,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YABYPQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 5]","Much like the film that preceded it, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is both completely preposterous and a lot of fun at the same time. No, I never once believed what was going on; this movie is not about believability, but about pure entertainment, much like the ""Indiana Jones"" films or ""The Da Vinci Code."" And in the tradition of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" this film is founded on the premise that hidden clues will lead to the truth. In this case, the quest for the truth is directly related to Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage): his family name is threatened when it's revealed that one of his ancestors--Thomas Gates--may have been the mastermind behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) claims to have proof of this: a piece of a missing page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth.Both Ben and his father, Patrick (Jon Voight), refuse to believe this is true, and immediately vow to set the record straight. Ben first needs to get a look at Wilkinson's piece of paper, and to do that, he enlists the help of his partner, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and his ex-girlfriend, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Numerous infrared scans show that the page contains a cipher, and when cracked, it's discovered that Thomas Gates was looking for a fabled ancient city, said to made entirely of gold. Finding this city would prove that Gates was in no way responsible for killing President Lincoln. How, I'm not entirely sure, but considering how cleverly the various clues are hidden, I have to admit that I didn't really care.As it turns out, the clues will take Ben, Abigail, Riley, and Patrick on an international journey, beginning in France with the original Statue of Liberty. There are also two special clues that function simultaneously, and while I won't say what they are, I will say that they're hidden in Buckingham Palace and the White House. I'll also say that one of the clues is missing; the only way to find it is by obtaining the legendary Book of Secrets, which has been passed down from President to President for over one hundred years. Not only does this book contain the information Ben is looking for, it also speaks the truth about the country's biggest mysteries, from Area 51 to the missing minutes of the Watergate tapes to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. According to FBI agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel), the only way to ever see the book is to be elected President. Ben decides on the next best thing: he'll kidnap the current President (Bruce Greenwood) and convince him to reveal the book's location.Does this not sound like a fun movie? And it gets even better: hot on Ben's trail is Wilkinson, who--as you might have guessed--wants to stop Ben from finding the treasure. Its discovery would mean that Ben's ancestor was, in fact, innocent, and that would mean that Wilkinson's family history has been a lie. Using Patrick's bugged phone as a source of information, he listens to Ben's conversations and tries to gain the upper hand. Villains in such films are almost always this sneaky, which only makes us hate them that much more. And I have no doubt that this is exactly the way we're supposed to feel; both ""National Treasure"" films rely on a very clear Hero/Enemy formula, like all good adventure stories do. Simply put, we root for the good guys and hope that the bad guys fail. In essence, this movie is really no different than the Saturday afternoon serials of the 1940s and `50s.Topping everything off is Ben's mother, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), a History professor at the University of Maryland. She and Patrick have been divorced for over thirty years, and not once during that time have they spoken to each other. There's a reason for this: watching them together in the same room is enough to drive even the calmest, most patient person to the breaking point. When they reunite, they immediately bicker over the most insignificant things, like who should have placed their luggage in the cab on one of their old treasure hunting trips. But the main reason she's included is because Ben needs her help; one of the clues is covered with the symbols of an ancient language, and she is one of only a handful of people who can decipher them.The film culminates with a visit to Mount Rushmore, where something special has been in hiding for centuries. Most of the finale takes place in large caverns, into which water rushes in from large, temple-like openings. Unrealistic, I know, but hey, it's probably the most fitting conclusion for a film like this. It helps that a strong sense of humor runs all throughout, simply because this is a film that can't be taken seriously. The one character that's pure comedy relief is Riley, who always seems to get the short end of the stick. When he's introduced, he's at a bookstore, promoting his latest book on treasure hunting--not only do most people walk by without saying a word, some actually mistake him for Ben. There are also a fair number of humorous moments between Voight and Mirren, who make their characters likeable while still keeping that irritating edge. I know that ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets""--or for that matter, its predecessor--will never be considered a great movie, but who cares? I had fun, and that's all that matters.",4,Raiders of the Lost Book,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,5262,"['Much', 'film', 'preceded', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'completely',

1117712,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,B000YABYPQ,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[5, 8]","While not the greatest film ever,National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)had a few good things going for it.  It was a feel good adventure film that lacked bloodshed, profanity, or sexuality of any kind.  I am against censoring these things from films, but I respect the feelings of fellow moviegoers who enjoy milder entertainment.  It also had a patriotic, but not jingoistic, hero who was willing to risk spending the rest of his life in a federal prison to see that the ultimate good was served.  Which is a breath of fresh air from all of these ""stylish"" antiheroes who when viewed from a moral standpoint, are little if any better than the villains.Other than trying to scare up a few box office dollars, I can think of no other reason why this sequel was made.  It suffers from the same problem as 99% of all sequels because it recycles rather than continues the story of the preceding film.  It follows the same formula as its predecessor - one clue leads to another clue, which leads to... rinse and repeat.  The only things different are superficial details and the addition of Benjamin's mother to the fray.  There is just nothing here that contains even a molecule of originality.Adding to that, it is as ridiculously predictable as a broken clock being correct twice a day.  You've seen this all before whether it be the strained relationship between Ben's parents or how Ben gets himself into trouble with the FBI - and how both problems are resolved.  It really makes me wonder if they were going for a sequel or a rewrite of the first movie.What is really depressing about this film is that when it is compared to the recent cinematic trends (needless remakes, Eli Roth torture films, potty humor comedies, and Americanized J-horror), it's actually not a bad movie.  Then again, looking good by default doesn't make something good in fact.  This is not the worst movie ever made.  Far from it.

The best bit that should have been kept in was a scene where Ben tries to escape the Library of Congress via a skylight and his spotted by Agent Sadusky.""Secrets of a Sequel"" takes a look at how they approached this new film. The producers wanted to make it on a bigger scale with more difficult puzzles for our heroes to solve. The crucial factor in making this film was getting key cast members from the first one to return. The script wasn't done when they started filming and the filmmakers rewrote it as they went along.""The Book of Secrets: On Location"" takes a look at the different locations all over the world where our heroes look for clues. They actually shot in Paris and London and we see footage of them shooting there.""The Treasure Reel: Bloopers and Outtakes."" Cage hasn't been this funny in years as he blows lines and goofs around on set with his co-stars. We even get to see the usually unflappable Ed Harris break character.""Street Stunts: Creating the London Chase"" examines how they pulled off this action sequence. We get an indication of just how much planning goes into something like this in order to make sure everything goes off as planned.""Underground Action"" takes a look at the film's climactic action set pieces. The technicians and effects people show us how much of it was done with visual effects and practical sets.""Evolution of a Golden City"" examines the underground city made out of gold - how it was designed and then built on a soundstage.""Knights of the Golden Circle"" gives the lowdown of this extremist group and briefly details their agenda of provoking another Civil War.""Cover Story: Creating the President's Book"" takes a look at the President's Book of Secrets that is crucial to finding the City of Gold. We see how this particular prop was put together and chosen by the director.Finally, there is ""Inside the Library of Congress,"" a fascinating look at the actual historical building in which they shot a key scene for the film. This extra really conveys a sense of history and some of the people who work there talk about just how much and the various kinds of information that is stored there.",4,Discover the Wealth of Extras on the Collector's Edition,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,3034,"['first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'actor', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'director', 'talks', 'acting', 'choices', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Voight', 'made', 'first', 'scene', 'show', 'how', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'films', 'Turteltaub', 'certainly', 'history', 'rattles', 'kinds', 'historical', 'factoids', 'given', 'scene', 'Voight', 'highly', 'fellow', 'actors', 'points', 'out', 'certain', 'performance', 'bits', 'theirs', 'Turteltaub', 'dominate', 'track', 'Voight', 'chimes', 'occasionally.The', 'second', 'disc', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'Turteltaub', 'bit', 'more', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'sequence', 'involving', 'riddle', 'hummingbird', 'ran', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'condensed', 'two', 'minutes', 'final', 'film', 'also', 'see', 'more', 'Riley', 'gaining', 'access', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'computers', 'allowed', 'actor', 'adlib', 'best', 'bit', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Ben', 'escape', 'Library', 'Congress', 'skylight', 'spotted', 'Agent', 'Sadusky', 'Secrets', 'Sequel', 'look', 'how', 'approached', 'new', 'film', 'producers', 'wanted', 'make', 'bigger', 'scale', 'more', 'difficult', 'puzzles', 'heroes', 'solve', 'crucial', 'factor', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'getting', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'one', 'return', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'when', 'started', 'filming', 'filmmakers', 'rewrote', 'went', 'along', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'Location', 'look', 'different', 'locations', 'world', 'where', 'heroes', 'look', 'clues', 'actually', 'shot', 'Paris', 'London', 'see', 'footage', 'shooting', 'there', 'Treasure', 'Reel', 'Bloopers', 'Outtakes', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'been', 'funny', 'years', 'lines', 'goofs', 'around', 'set', 'co-stars', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'usually', 'unflappable', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'break', 'character', 'Street', 'Stunts', 'Creating', 'London', 'Chase', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'action', 'sequence', 'get', 'indication', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'planning', 'something', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'off', 'planned', 'Underground', 'Action', 'look', 'film', 'climactic', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'technicians', 'effects', 'people', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'done', 'visual', 'effects', 'practical', 'sets', 'Evolution', 'Golden', 'City', 'underground', 'city', 'made', 'gold', 'how', 'was', 'designed', 'then', 'built', 'soundstage', 'Knights', 'Golden', 'Circle', 'lowdown', 'extremist', 'group', 'briefly', 'details', 'agenda', 'provoking', 'Civil', 'War', 'Cover', 'Story', 'Creating', 'President', 'Book', 'look', 'President', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'crucial', 'finding', 'City', 'Gold', 'see', 'how', 'particular', 'prop', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'chosen', 'director.Finally', 'Library', 'Congress', 'fascinating', 'look', 'actual', 'historical', 'building', 'shot', 'key', 'scene', 'film', 'extra', 'really', 'sense', 'history', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'talk', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'various', 'kinds', 'information', 'stored', 'there']",N/A

As an adult, I found National Treasure: Book of Secrets the most boring movie I have seen on the big screen all year. I had to use every ounce of will power not to walk out of the theater and demand my money back!Before the movie even started, I was forced to sit through an infuriatingly dopey Disney cartoon, which was nothing more than a not-so-subtle commercial for expensive T.V. and stereo equipment.  It went on and on and on. Finally I had to close my eyes in order not to get overly aggravated! Wow! How low Disney has sunk to make a buck.The story was written to the level of a 10 year old! There's close to nothing to entertain an adult. It's a blatant and poorly done rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark.I can deal with a story that's preposterous if  it's enjoyable. But kidnapping the president by walking him through a tunnel. How exciting! Finding a Central or South American city hidden many thousands of miles away in the Badlands of South Dakota! Yikes!, how insulting to all the Plains Indian tribes can you get?  Or, how dumb do you think the American movie going audience is? Can at least a modicum of reality seep into the story?The special affects are so trite! The props look so fake that I thought they were using an amusement park to film this movie. I was waiting for a water slide to show up at any moment!The acting was pitiful! Nicholas Cage had such a painful expression on his face throughout the movie I though he must either be embarrassed or ashamed of  himself  for stooping so low. I realize actors need to make a living. But he, of all people, can pick and choose his film projects.The only good thing I could think of is the scene with the President and a cameo of a Hillary Clinton look-alike at the President's birthday party. Since the Hillary cameo was having such a good time at the party, it can be assumed the Democrats won the 2008 election!",1,What A Disney Disaster!

1117723,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B000YABYPQ,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[2, 5]","On the movie: I am just not a big fan of this series so far. I am a history buff and was really wanting to enjoy this movie; like the first one, the same flaws remain in #2. Nicolas Cage is just bad casting. It is difficult to like him. However, the supporting cast is fantastic; Diane Kruger as his love interest Abigail and Justin Bartha as the sidekick are happily on board for this installment, as well as Jon Voigt as Ben Gates' (Cage) dad. Helen Mirren is a welcome addition to the cast as Ben's mom who still carries much bitterness for her ex (Voigt).This time, the catalyst for the treasure hunt is the recent accusation that Ben's great-great-grandfather was part of the plot to murder President Lincoln. This leads to a search for the Presidential Book of Secrets which leads to trying to find the Lost City of Gold. This time the film goes international; London, Paris...but even with some exotic locales, the film just does not generate the excitement that it should.Although this film attempts to pattern itself after Hitchcock (stated by Director Turteltaub himself on the commentary), it fails. There are many fantastic individual scenes that just don't gel together as a whole. Hitchcock was a master at elevating and dropping the audience with suspense and hot romance (""North by Northwest"" is a classic example); not so here. Cage may be trying to channel Cary Grant (again as Turteltaub tells it) but he comes nowhere near close; and even though I truly like Diane Kruger, her chemistry with Cage is not like Grace Kelly & Grant of old. The leaps to clues and the thought processes behind them are just as hard to believe as before; you REALLY need to suspend disbelief to buy into this movie. Ed Harris as the villain is a poorly written character; selfish and rotten throughout, his last minute redemption is hard to believe.Now to the DVD itself; picture/audio are fantastic (especially if you have a surround sound system). The extras are also excellent. Mercifully, Disney decided not to put all the hunt and peck methods that were on the National Treasure One DVD. This time, you just pop in Disc 2 and access whatever you want to see. Disc 1 has commentary by Voigt & Turteltaub. Even Voigt comments on the fact that most likely nobody else was available for the commentary; still, it is interesting to hear the behind-the-scenes stories. The deleted scenes were trimmed for the right reasons; a film that jumps around like this one needs tight editing, and the scenes shown here really don't add at all. One of my fave extras is ""Inside the Library of Congress"" which shows some of the rare collection there (photos of John Wilkes Booth and the men being hung for the Lincoln murder). ""Cover Story: Crafting the President's Book"" shows how the actual book was created for the movie and the attention to detail that makes it look authentic. ""Knights of the Golden Circle"" left me wanting much more; it is a very short featurette talking about the real-life group of people who wanted to keep slavery going and annex Mexico; their need for gold/money thwarted their efforts. ""Evolution of a Golden City"": this one will surprise you for two reasons: to see just how much was actually built as a set, and then to see what was created by CGI (the ability to create objects that appear to be handled by actors shows just how far this technology has come). ""Treasure Reel: Bloopers & Outtakes"" is the usual assortment of guffaws that show errors and cast camaraderie. ""The Book of Secrets: On Location"" is a wonderful travelogue of all the different locations, describing what was actually shot on location and what was CGI. Turteltaub/Bruckehimer definitely pushed the limits of trying to use the real spots, often thwarted by regulations, especially in DC at the White House (snipers on the roof of the White House?!? ouch!). Very interesting to watch the ""rehearsals"" of the chase sequence in the ""Street Stunts"" featurette. ""Underground Action"" shows the behind-the scenes for the City of Gold and the Balancing Platform, achieved through the use of a gimbal. ""Secrets Of A Sequel"" talks about the thought process behind coming up with this installment and the importance of reuniting the original cast and crew. Overall on these extras, there is much talking about how the ending and much of the script was made up along the way. This really comes as no surprise, and confirms for me that had there been more planning, a cohesive resulting plot would have made a much better film. Easter Eggs: Including a conversation about Beverly Hills High School with fellow alums Nic Cage and Jo Turteltaub, and a look at the White House lawn scene as filmed in front of a blue screen .So-so film that is watchable; just a real bummer that some more story planning wasn't done ahead of time. The DVD itself is excellent and a marked improvement over the first.NOTE: Although many reviewers  have referred to the Goofy cartoon that was shown in the theaters, it is not on this DVD, unless there is some extra-hidden Easter Egg. Always a danger in reviewing a DVD BEFORE you see the actual DVD. Sorry folks, you'll have to find Goofy somewhere else!",3,"Review of actual DVD: So-so movie, GREAT extras!

Sadly, this second installment fails on most of these counts.Despite the return of the original cast, the story here simply does not hold together. It is not believable in any sense of the word, as was the case in the first movie (which is what made it so compelling); the puzzles are outlandish and over the top and the capers silly. It moves along at a good pace and is entertaining, if you can forget how much worse this movie is than the first one. But it leaves you with an empty feeling -- that it could have so much more with a little extra work.Too much of this movie seem contrived. Bringing the mom of the Nick Cage character into the story simply muddied the waters, as did the supposed separation of Nick and love interest. The whole thing at Mt. Rushmore was just silly. All the underground stuff, the secret passages and rickety falling platforms and ladders seemed too too much like the original, except that in the original movie, you might believe it could happen. In this movie, it made no sense and frankly, I didn't care. Lost city of gold? Somewhere under Mt Rushmore? Uh, yeah.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[8, 9]","Despite the fact that this 2007 sequel to the popular ""National Treasure"" boasts a fine cast of actors (Nicholas Cage, Jon Voight, personal favorite Ed Harris and the incomparable Helen Mirren,) ""Book of Secrets"" catapults into a fast but formulaic action with a little less than the high voltage adrenaline the initial film offered, repositioning famed treasure-hunter/historian Ben Franklin Gates (Cage) to face yet another widely publicized dis --- this time linking his equally cipher-solving obscure masters-of-trivia ancestors to the Lincoln assassination.  Unfortunately, the direction in which ""Book"" heads detours a bit from the mixture of DaVinci Code cleverness and conspiracy theory weaving through a politically fueled labyrinth of arcane societies that I expected.Instead, Cage and Co. move at warp speed through each step of this adventure quest seeking the famed Cibola---City of Gold, gathering clues in a variety of eye-pleasing locations while connecting the dots with an ease that will make one's head spin and put the fastest number-crunching supercomputer to shame.  The rather predictable climax, relying heavily on Speilberg's Indiana Jones success formula, replete with bickering, bantering adjuncts and couples and `look-what-you've-gotten-me-into-now' repartee wows the audience with the same unreal sensation achieved at the end of a Disneyland ride--think Pirates of the Caribbean when your amusement park shuttle boat lies in the shadow of the facsimile pirate ship and the whole audio-animatronic crew sings ""(Yo Ho)A Pirate's Life for Me,"" while the gunpowder explodes and the backdrop shudders.  In fact, this very feeling suggests what went wrong in this could-have-been fun more-adult film:  an over reliance on Disney-fication--too much pyrotechnics over Sleeping Beauty castle:  nuanced players under-utilized to depict banality, trite, yet s(n)appy dialogue that feigns intelligence, old tried-but-true attempts at humor that probably work well for the audience it attempted to capture--PG family far--and an underscoring of historical gravitas as depicted by Cage's deadpan expression and Bruce Greenwood's presidential suavity and emphasized by a soaring patriotic soundtrack.Bottom line?  ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" delivers exactly what the marquee suggests:  pleasant albeit familiar family fare with a slick Disney polishing that seems to jump about more like a video game than a film.

Like the first, it features Nicholas Cage as treasure-hunter Ben Gates, this time on the track of another fabled prize of antiquity: The Golden City of Cibola.The movie opens in April 1865, as the Civil War ends.  A Confederate conspiracy calling itself the Knights of the Golden Circle approaches one Thomas Gates for the key to a coded message.  While Gates is decoding the message, John Wilks Booth, a member of the Knights, assassinates President Abraham Lincoln.  When Gates realizes who he is dealing with, he tries to destroy the coded message and is shot for his trouble by one of the Knights.Fast forward to the present:  Ben Gates and his father Thomas Gates (reprised by Jon Voight) are presenting a lecture about their ancestor as a civilian hero of the Civil War when they are challenged by one Mitch Wilkerson (played with smooth menace by Ed Harris).  Wilkerson claims to have proof that the Civil War-era Gates was a member of the plot to kill Lincoln, in the form of a missing page from Booth's dairy.Ben Gates and his father must prove their family's innocence.  An examination of the missing diary page reveals a clue relating to the Lost City of Cibola, and the chase is on.  Ben joins forces with his father, his computer-hacking buddy Riley (Justin Bartha), his archivist ex-girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger in a strong peformance), and his mother Emily (Helen Mirren in a great supporting role as a professor of native American languages).  Together, they will follow a string of clues through Paris, London, Washington DC, Mount Vernon, and the Black Hills of South Dakota, closely pursued by Mitch Wilkerson and his band of thugs, and by the FBI.  Along the way, Ben will figure out ways to break into Buckingham Palace and the White House, kidnap the President (Bruce Greenwood in a pitch perfect cameo), and ransack the President's Book of Secrets for the location of a long-hidden treasure chamber.The movie rockets along in a thrill ride from one exotic location to the next.  Real pieces of history such as the twin desk set made from HMS Resolute are mashed together with bits of urban myth and historical trivia to create another fantastic treasure conspiracy.  Ben and his friends solve one puzzle after another, typically under the time pressure of some crisis threatening life or liberty.  The movie features some scenes of violence, such as a white-knuckle car chase in London, but the overall mood is distinctly tongue-in-cheek and worthy of its PG rating.This movie is highly recommended as a very entertaining, good old-fashioned thriller.",4,Great Fun on a Treasure Hunt....,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,2683,"['2007', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'worthwhile', 'sequel', 'original', 'National', 'Treasure', 'first', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'treasure-hunter', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'time', 'track', 'fabled', 'prize', 'antiquity', 'Golden', 'City', 'Cibola.The', 'movie', 'April', '1865', 'Civil', 'War', 'Confederate', 'conspiracy', 'calling', 'Knights', 'Golden', 'Circle', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'key', 'coded', 'message', 'Gates', 'decoding', 'message', 'John', 'Wilks', 'Booth', 'member', 'Knights', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'When', 'realizes', 'who', 'dealing', 'destroy', 'coded', 'message', 'shot', 'trouble', 'one', 'Knights.Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'reprised', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'are', 'presenting', 'lecture', 'ancestor', 'civilian', 'hero', 'Civil', 'War', 'when', 'are', 'challenged', 'one', 'Mitch', 'Wilkerson', 'played', 'smooth', 'menace', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Wilkerson', 'have', 'proof', 'Civil', 'War-era', 'Gates', 'was', 'member', 'plot', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'form', 'missing', 'page', 'Booth', 'dairy.Ben', 'Gates', 'father', 'must', 'prove', 'family', 'innocence', 'examination', 'missing', 'diary', 'page', 'clue', 'relating', 'Lost', 'City', 'Cibola', 'chase', 'Ben', 'forces', 'father', 'computer-hacking', 'buddy', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'archivist', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Abigail', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'strong', 'peformance', 'mother', 'Emily', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'professor', 'native', 'American', 'languages', 'Together', 'will', 'follow', 'string', 'clues', 'Paris', 'London', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Mount', 'Vernon', 'Black', 'Hills', 'South', 'Dakota', 'closely', 'pursued', 'Mitch', 'Wilkerson', 'band', 'thugs', 'FBI', 'way', 'Ben', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'ways', 'break', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'White', 'House', 'kidnap', 'President', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'cameo', 'ransack', 'President', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'location', 'long-hidden', 'treasure', 'chamber.The', 'movie', 'rockets', 'along', 'thrill', 'ride', 'one', 'exotic', 'location', 'next', 'Real', 'pieces', 'history', 'such', 'twin', 'desk', 'set', 'made', 'HMS', 'Resolute', 'are', 'mashed', 'together', 'bits', 'urban', 'myth', 'historical', 'trivia', 'create', 'fantastic', 'treasure', 'conspiracy', 'Ben', 'friends', 'solve', 'one', 'puzzle', 'typically', 'time', 'pressure', 'crisis', 'threatening', 'life', 'liberty', 'movie', 'scenes', 'violence', 'such', 'white-knuckle', 'car', 'chase', 'London', 'overall', 'mood', 'distinctly', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'worthy', 'PG', 'rating.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'very', 'entertaining', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'thriller']",N/A

My defense for that is that they can't just show him sitting there thinking for over a half hour, because it will slow the film.  But in this movie, the answer just pops into his head right away; he doesn't even seem to have to think at all.Some things in the movie are too predictable.  For instance, we find out in the beginning that Abigail has broken up with Ben and kicked him out of their house, so obviously we know that they will end up back together.  The same goes for Ben's parents.  We see them together and they can't stand one another, so we know that they will also be together again.I think that Ed Harris is a great actor and I was glad to see him in this movie, but he doesn't make a good nemesis.  He's just all over the place.  First he's just a jerk, then he's a villain, then he's a nice guy and is more like Ben's partner, then he pulls a knife and is bad again, then he's the hero.  I just don't buy it.Last of all, the treasure hunt in this movie was pointless to me.  When Ben and his father find out that Ben's great-grandfather might have been involved in Lincoln's assassination, they say that if they find this treasure, it will prove his innocense.  What?  How does finding this treasure prove anything?Sorry to spoil some people's fun with a bad review, but I just didn't like this movie.

1117756,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000YABYPQ,James Hiller,"[5, 6]","Let's get the first thing out of the way before I go into the review of this movie: it is a movie, a fiction movie designed purely for entertainment, and in no way, shape or form meant to be a serious look at anything historical. For those Lincoln's Assassination purists, this movie may just bring you to the edge of incredulity, and give you a migraine with the first five minutes. For the rest of the public, who just enjoys a fun, goofy action/adventure movie, this flick is for you.Picking up on the fun of the first movie, National Treasure, comes the sequel ""Book of Secrets"". Picking up a few years after the ending of the first film, we find anti-hero Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) trying to clear his family's name after a nefarious con artist named Mitch Wilkinson (the underused Ed Harris) produces a missing page of the Booth diary that would suggest Gates' great-grandfather was responsible for putting together the plot to kill Lincoln. That sends Gates on a quest, needing the help once again of now shock author Riley Poole (the wonderful Justin Barrtha), and eventually his ex-whatever Abby (Diane Kruger). The plot and plan quickly takes them to Paris and then London, in search of a desk with hidden compartments, which in turn, leads them back to the good ol' USA and yet another search of fantastic caverns on American Soil.Joining the fun this time, along with Jon Voight reprising his role as Pat Gates, is the amazing Helen Mirren as Emily Appleton, Benjamin's long gone mother with steel in her veins. She's needed to interpret some interesting Indian symbols Ben finds on a piece of wood. Mirren takes to her role with aplomb, always a great actress, despite having several water scenes later on in the movie.The plot of ""Book of Secrets"" is a contrived jumble of puzzles and coincidences, but then, wasn't the first one? And wasn't that what we all loved about the first one to begin with? The gang of producers managed to capture the fun of the first movie without seemingly being too redundant. As you watch the movie, if you've seen the first one enough, you can mentally check off the ""this is the part that matches what happened in the first."" Does that detract from my sense of fun? No!Perhaps it's the acting (Justin and Helen are superb, and Ed Harris turns delightfully nasty in this one as well), or the action that make this just a fun time in the movies. Is any of it believable? Not in the slightest. But within the first five minutes, you must suspend your belief, and just enjoy the ride. Even when the president of the United States willingly goes on a quest with Ben Gates.... I groaned at that one.However, I did think this was a fun film, great for a break from reality, to spend it with people that are genuinely crazy, imperfect, but yet fun.",4,Back to Fun!,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2791,"['Let', 'get', 'first', 'thing', 'way', 'go', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'fiction', 'movie', 'designed', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'look', 'anything', 'historical', 'Lincoln', 'Assassination', 'movie', 'may', 'just', 'bring', 'edge', 'incredulity', 'give', 'migraine', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'rest', 'public', 'who', 'just', 'fun', 'goofy', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'flick', 'you.Picking', 'up', 'fun', 'first', 'movie', 'National', 'Treasure', 'sequel', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'Picking', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'ending', 'first', 'film', 'find', 'anti-hero', 'Benjamin', 'Gates', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'trying', 'clear', 'family', 'name', 'nefarious', 'con', 'artist', 'named', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'underused', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'missing', 'page', 'Booth', 'diary', 'would', 'suggest', 'Gates', 'great-grandfather', 'was', 'responsible', 'putting', 'together', 'plot', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'quest', 'needing', 'help', 'once', 'again', 'now', 'author', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'wonderful', 'Justin', 'Barrtha', 'eventually', 'ex-whatever', 'Abby', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'plot', 'plan', 'quickly', 'Paris', 'then', 'London', 'search', 'desk', 'hidden', 'compartments', 'turn', 'back', 'good', 'ol', 'USA', 'yet', 'search', 'fantastic', 'caverns', 'American', 'Soil.Joining', 'fun', 'time', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'reprising', 'role', 'Pat', 'Gates', 'amazing', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Emily', 'Appleton', 'Benjamin', 'long', 'gone', 'mother', 'steel', 'veins', 'needed', 'interpret', 'interesting', 'Indian', 'symbols', 'Ben', 'piece', 'wood', 'Mirren', 'role', 'aplomb', 'always', 'great', 'actress', 'having', 'several', 'water', 'scenes', 'later', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'contrived', 'jumble', 'puzzles', 'coincidences', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'loved', 'first', 'one', 'begin', 'gang', 'producers', 'managed', 'capture', 'fun', 'first', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'being', 'too', 'redundant', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'enough', 'can', 'mentally', 'check', 'off', 'part', 'what', 'happened', 'first', 'detract', 'sense', 'fun', 'No', 'Perhaps', 'acting', 'Justin', 'Helen', 'are', 'superb', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'delightfully', 'nasty', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'make', 'just', 'fun', 'time', 'movies', 'believable', 'Not', 'slightest', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'must', 'suspend', 'belief', 'just', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'Even', 'when', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'willingly', 'quest', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'groaned', 'one.However', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'great', 'break', 'reality', 'spend', 'people', 'are', 'genuinely', 'crazy', 'imperfect', 'yet', 'fun']",N/A

1117785,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000YABYPQ,K. Driscoll,"[0, 1]","National Treasure 2:  Book of Secrets is a $130 million adventure film that looks great, has a great pace, and stars Nicholas Cage, Harvey Keitel, Helen Mirren, and Ed Harris, among others.  All the more shame because no emphasis was put into making this story anymore than a souped-up version of a Dan Brown novel.  Off the subject but I actually thought Ron Howard'sDa Vinci Codefilm was better.  Jon Turteltaud (3 Ninjas,Cool Runnings) directs and the infinitely successfully Jerry Bruckheimer produces.  One thing is for sure, Book of Secrets aimed to make money and that happened so we might see more sequels.Like thefirst film, this one focuses on intricate and ambitious conspiracy theories in American history.  This story ultimately surrounds the assassination of President Lincoln.  Benjamin Gates (Cage) is back and finds himself personally motivated to unveil the truth.  So much so, he finds a ways to infiltrate both Buckingham Palace and the Library of Congress, in addition to kidnapping the president of the United States.National Treasure 2 is an easy target and I could probably be more critical but other than the perpetually creepy Jon Voight, the cast, which is really just punching in for a days work, is better than one would expect here and even half-hearted performances out of Ed Harris and Helen Mirren are better than the average actor.  Nicholas Cage may get even more credit for putting almost everything into such trivial screenplays, but the cynic in me is sad that he seems to only care about the money time and time again.  I guess he's just a fun-loving guy but I think of films likeWild At Heart,Adaptation, andLeaving Las Vegas, and it reminds me that Cage is one of the most talented actors alive today.

1117789,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000YABYPQ,Kevin Killian,"[4, 8]","Our kids were never good at history and were this-close to flunking out of the top private schools that we had found them places in.  History was like poison to them.  For right or wrong their generation doesn't believe in anything that took place before, say, French situationalism.  Ask them about the Beatles, they'll look absolutely blankly at you.  When the headmaster called me four years ago, threatening to dropkick my oldest son Brandon right out of school if his history grades did not improve, I was at the door of despair.  Then happily Nicolas Cage saved the day by releasing NATIONAL TREASURE part one, and my kids got hooked on history.  They don't know who Nicolas Cage is, in fact I don't think they believe he is an actor, they think he is Ben Gates the ""history guy.""They also like his father, played by Jon Voight, and now they have a new hero, Helen Mirren's Egyptologist character who proves just as brave and plucky as her son and estranged husband.Before Part Two I had no idea that there was an actual Book of Secrets that all American Presidents are forced to read and hide!  But I have since been assured that all of it is true.It is funny that Hollywood producers, who would as we all know sell out their own grandmothers, have now made two pictures in a row in which ""family honor"" is the prime motivating factor.  Not only do the Gates family feel stung when it is ""proven"" that their ancestor helped assassinate Lincoln, but Ed Harris is similarly suffering from the disgrace of bad blood.  It's not exactly convincing, and the actors don't really play it out very well, but hey, it got my kids interested in Lincoln and in Dr, Samuel Mudd, the man after whom, as Nicolas Cage explains, we got the common expression, ""His Name Is Mudd.""  Long ago, director John Ford shot the excellent biopic ""The Prisoner of Shark Island"" about this very same case, and my kids seem to love it.  They have recently asked me if they could become members of the American Cinematheque and get seasons tickets to the Cinematheque's current program of screening every one of John Ford's films.I liked seeing Jon Voight and Helen Mirren play off of each other like the Nick and Nora of history.  In actuality, both Voight and Mirren had something in common, each had made a seminal film with the British auteur John Boorman, DELIVERANCE for Voight and EXCALIBUR for Mirren.  Something of Boorman's shadowy, erratic glow hovers over all the Voight-Mirren sequences in the film, far outclassing the Cage-Kruger affair, for which I did not care a whit, though Brandon has recently left Princeton to try to track down Diane Kruger and ask her about how to become a topnotch expert in forensics analysis, as he believes her to be.  Finally, the real-life Book of Secrets, now owned by President Bush, tells the whole story about Area 51 and how Eisenhower was brought there in a secret plane and shook hands and played cards with two dying aliens before they died, and other stories we thought were tall tales were true, just like the legendary city of gold under Mount Rushmore.",3,Better than the original,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,3084,"['kids', 'were', 'never', 'good', 'history', 'were', 'this-close', 'flunking', 'top', 'private', 'schools', 'had', 'found', 'places', 'History', 'was', 'poison', 'right', 'wrong', 'generation', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'took', 'place', 'say', 'French', 'situationalism', 'Ask', 'Beatles', ""'ll"", 'look', 'absolutely', 'blankly', 'When', 'headmaster', 'called', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'threatening', 'dropkick', 'oldest', 'son', 'Brandon', 'right', 'school', 'history', 'grades', 'did', 'not', 'improve', 'was', 'door', 'despair', 'Then', 'happily', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'saved', 'day', 'releasing', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'part', 'one', 'kids', 'got', 'hooked', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'believe', 'actor', 'think', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'history', 'guy', 'also', 'father', 'played', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'now', 'have', 'new', 'hero', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Egyptologist', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'brave', 'plucky', 'son', 'estranged', 'husband.Before', 'Part', 'Two', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'actual', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'American', 'Presidents', 'are', 'forced', 'read', 'hide', 'have', 'been', 'assured', 'true.It', 'funny', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'sell', 'out', 'own', 'grandmothers', 'have', 'now', 'made', 'two', 'pictures', 'row', 'family', 'honor', 'prime', 'motivating', 'factor', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'Gates', 'family', 'feel', 'stung', 'when', 'proven', 'ancestor', 'helped', 'assassinate', 'Lincoln', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'similarly', 'suffering', 'disgrace', 'bad', 'blood', 'not', 'exactly', 'convincing', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'hey', 'got', 'kids', 'interested', 'Lincoln', 'Dr', 'Samuel', 'Mudd', 'man', 'whom', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'got', 'common', 'expression', 'Name', 'Mudd', 'Long', 'ago', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'excellent', 'biopic', 'Prisoner', 'Shark', 'Island', 'very', 'same', 'case', 'kids', 'seem', 'love', 'have', 'recently', 'asked', 'could', 'become', 'members', 'American', 'Cinematheque', 'get', 'seasons', 'tickets', 'Cinematheque', 'current', 'program', 'screening', 'one', 'John', 'Ford', 'films.I', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'play', 'other', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'history', 'actuality', 'Voight', 'Mirren', 'had', 'something', 'common', 'had', 'made', 'seminal', 'film', 'British', 'auteur', 'John', 'Boorman', 'DELIVERANCE', 'Voight', 'EXCALIBUR', 'Mirren', 'Something', 'Boorman', 'shadowy', 'erratic', 'glow', 'hovers', 'Voight-Mirren', 'sequences', 'film', 'far', 'outclassing', 'Cage-Kruger', 'affair', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'whit', 'Brandon', 'recently', 'left', 'Princeton', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'ask', 'how', 'become', 'topnotch', 'expert', 'forensics', 'analysis', 'be', 'Finally', 'real-life', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'now', 'owned', 'President', 'Bush', 'whole', 'story', 'Area', '51', 'how', 'Eisenhower', 'was', 'brought', 'there', 'secret', 'plane', 'shook', 'hands', 'played', 'cards', 'two', 'dying', 'aliens', 'died', 'other', 'stories', 'thought', 'were', 'tall', 'tales', 'were', 'true', 'just', 'legendary', 'city', 'gold', 'Mount', 'Rushmore']",N/A

Mitch Wilkinson, a Confederate general's descendent, produces evidence pointing to Thomas Gates', Ben Gates' ancestor, involvement in plotting together with John Wilkes Booth to kill Abraham Lincoln. Ben Gates will try to clear his ancestor's name while embarking on a treasure hunt in search of Cibola, the legendary lost Indian city of gold.Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger (who is beautiful!), Ed Harris, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren, Harvey Keitel, Justin Bartha, and the rest of this great cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it combines mystery, action, and adventure, making it one of the best films of its kind.On the negative side:1) What parents would allow their son to sacrifice himself to save them??? NONE!2) The openly and provocative anti-southern/anti-confederate bias.Alright they lost, now leave them alone!At the same time this blind and without-questions-asked adoration of Abraham Lincoln without presenting the actual truth about him regarding his political stance during the 1858 Illinois Lincoln-Douglas debates, his actions/policies/decrees from 1861 to 1865 as well as the overall legality of the American Civil War, undermines any attempt at credibility.The hypocrisy and double standards remain unabated as the Sons of Liberty are often viewed as heroes, but the Knights of the Golden Circle are described in the film as ""an extremist group.""Moreover, technically John Wilkes Booth was indeed a murderer, but not a `traitor,' since he was a southerner.In short, it's the same old/usual clich&eacute; involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: Southerners (it must have been really difficult to include Germans, Serbs or Russians in this one although there are a few jabs against Queen Victoria...).3) The overly exaggerated relationship/behavior between the two parents. It got tiring very early on.Nevertheless, despite these setbacks the movie is highly entertaining.Additionally, the part about how the United States used to be ""they"" before the Civil War only to become ""it"" after the Civil War, was very interesting.The acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire movie.In short, National Treasure 2 Book of Secrets is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, though it could have easily avoided the mistakes it made. 4.4 Stars",4,The Knights of the Golden Circle,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,2848,"['National', 'Treasure', '2', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'viewer', 'one', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'action', 'packed', 'adventures.The', 'film', 'up', 'shortly', 'where', 'first', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Confederate', 'general', 'descendent', 'evidence', 'pointing', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'ancestor', 'involvement', 'plotting', 'together', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'kill', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'will', 'try', 'clear', 'ancestor', 'name', 'embarking', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'search', 'Cibola', 'legendary', 'lost', 'Indian', 'city', 'gold.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'who', 'beautiful', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'rest', 'great', 'cast', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'chemistry', 'AMAZING', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'mystery', 'action', 'adventure', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'kind.On', 'negative', 'side:1', 'What', 'parents', 'would', 'allow', 'son', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'NONE', '2', 'openly', 'provocative', 'anti-southern/anti-confederate', 'bias.Alright', 'lost', 'now', 'leave', 'alone', 'same', 'time', 'blind', 'without-questions-asked', 'adoration', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'presenting', 'actual', 'truth', 'regarding', 'political', 'stance', '1858', 'Illinois', 'Lincoln-Douglas', 'debates', 'actions/policies/decrees', '1861', '1865', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'legality', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'attempt', 'credibility.The', 'hypocrisy', 'double', 'standards', 'remain', 'unabated', 'Sons', 'Liberty', 'are', 'often', 'viewed', 'heroes', 'Knights', 'Golden', 'Circle', 'are', 'described', 'film', 'extremist', 'group', 'Moreover', 'technically', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'was', 'indeed', 'murderer', 'not', 'traitor', 'was', 'southerner.In', 'short', 'same', 'old/usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'involving', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'villains/scapegoats', 'Southerners', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'difficult', 'include', 'Germans', 'Serbs', 'Russians', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'jabs', 'Queen', 'Victoria', '.3', 'overly', 'exaggerated', 'relationship/behavior', 'two', 'parents', 'got', 'tiring', 'very', 'early', 'on.Nevertheless', 'setbacks', 'movie', 'highly', 'entertaining.Additionally', 'part', 'how', 'United', 'States', 'used', 'be', 'Civil', 'War', 'only', 'become', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'acting', 'setting', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'wonderful', 'mystery', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'toes', 'entire', 'movie.In', 'short', 'National', 'Treasure', '2', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'will', 'surely', 'provide', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'avoided', 'mistakes', 'made', '4.4', 'Stars']",N/A

And indeed, the acting, directing, and cinematography in this film are all wonderful. I was especially pleased to find that Helen Mirren has been added to the mix. So for the acting alone, it is worth seeing this film. And if you don't stop think--at all--you can sit back and enjoy the ride, improbable as it is.However, there are several problems with the plot, starting with the fact that the plot point that gets the entire movie rolling would have been completely unnecessary for Nicholas Cage's character, Ben.*SPOILERS*A mysterious character, Wilkinson (played by Ed Harris), comes out of the blue and very publicly accuses Ben's great-grandfather of having masterminded the Lincoln assassination. He has a vital document proving it. Ben gets his hands on the document, finds a cipher, and starts a series of highly illegal and improbable activities to unravel the clues.Sounds fine, right? Except that if Wilkinson had just approached Ben directly and said, ""I have this document and I want to know if you can solve the mystery regarding it,"" without making a public accusation (which, despite a later retraction, some people will always believe), Ben would have jumped at the opportunity without hesitation. Therefore, the entire premise of the movie--Ben having to clear his family's good name--is based on an unbelievable circumstance. That means another antagonist would have had to have been found, but that's what good writers are for.After that, the other plot holes seem pretty minor by comparison, but there are a number of them, not to mention things like windshields that are shot up, then magically restore themselves, the ancient Olmec in South Dakota, and on and on.*END OF SPOILERS*I did enjoy the movie, and I wasn't sorry I had seen it, but the fact that the writers didn't bother to make the overarching premise believable says something either about their skill or their attitude toward the audience's intelligence. Or maybe both. And although I admit that I would see another National Treasure, my expectations for the intelligence of the plot have been considerably lowered by this one. But the optimist in me says that it could be like the Indiana Jones movies--the second one (Temple of Doom) was the very worst, and the last (Crystal Skull) was the best.

That's why John Wilkes Booth sought him out the night he assassinated President Lincoln.  But when Thomas realized he was helping a group that wanted to keep fighting the Civil War, he tour the pages from Booth's diary and tried to burn them.At least that's the story the Gates family has always believed.  Suddenly, Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) has come forward with one of those missing pages.  On the page is proof that Thomas Gates was in on the assassination.It's just not that easy for Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) to believe.  They just know that if they examine the page, they'll find proof that Thomas is innocent of the charges.  Enlisting the help of Riley (Justin Bartha) and Abigail (Diane Kruger), they set out to redeem the family name.  To do so, they have to find the ancient Indian City of Gold.  And they have to enlist the help of Ben's mother Emily (Helen Mirren), who hasn't spoken to Patrick in 32 years.  With someone hot on their trail, can they complete their new quest?Let's the honest, the first movie had plenty of flaws.  But it told a fast paced story with lots of humor.  This one is pretty much the same.  The flaws are a little more pronounced this time, but it is just as funny as the first.There's still plenty of humor, with the great lines being spread equally amoung the characters, although Riley still gets his share.  Unfortunately, several of the best ones from the previews did get cut.  The plot, while similar to the first, features new locations and clues that make it feel fresh.  And the acting is still good.Having said all this, the story does have some flaws.  First of all, the movie opens with a Civil War setting, and that setting kicks off the story.  Now maybe I missed something (it took me two or three viewings to make all the connections in the first one), but why are they using a page from Civil War times to track items which date from the 1870's and 80's?Additinally, plot points seem to get glossed over.  We can make the connections, but an extra few lines of dialog would have been nice.  Finally, the villain was too weak for the story, and FBI agent Sadusky really had no point in returning for this film.While it has some serious flaws, this movie is fun, and that is ultimately what this is all about.

To clear his father's name, Ben recruits Abigail, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and his parents (Jon Vought, Helen Mirren) to trek across the world to find clues that would lead to the whereabouts of the evidence. But he'll have to do it before FBI agent Sandusky (Harvey Kietel) and the treasure hunter (Ed Harris) who brought up the charges find him first.Sounds like a simplistic story, right? Well, apparently, someone forgot to tell director Jon Turteltaub. At the end of 2004, this director brought a somewhat family-friendly version of ""Indiana Jones"" to theaters titled ""National Treasure"". That's fine and all, and films like that succeed, as long as they invite the audience along for the ride. And who can say no to a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced film starring Nicolas Cage (""The Rock""). But Turteltaub bathed the whole film in non-stop expository dialogue, reducing the character personalities to simply stock figures that flat out tell the story, even if the performances from the actors (Cage, Bartha, Krueger, and Voight) are lively enough to be enjoyable.Things haven't changed. The only changes made in the sequel ""Book of Secrets"" is a different story, more cast members (including a nondescript Bruce Greenwood as the President), and more locations to travel. Turteltaub is looking for an ""Indiana Jones""-type adventure like the last roundabout, and the cast members are up to the challenge, but the dialogue is still explanatory instead of inviting. ""Transformers"" had a somewhat complex story (key word: somewhat), but Michael Bay (director of four Jerry Bruckheimer films) allowed the plot to be easy to hang on its every words without being explained non-stop.Because of that, the action sequences aren't much to get worked up over. And Turteltaub has the galls to turn the volume up to 11 to overcompensate and let the audience get into it. But I'm not convinced. Trevor Rabin also slums with a forgettable score that could've worked, but how would I know? I got exhausted by what was going on.The only person who seems to at least avoid exposition for about a small percentage of the time is Justin Bartha. Like Will Arnett, Bartha's another guy who gets ripped on for playing out lousy jokes that worn out their welcome. But at least he's trying to stay afloat from drowning in expository dialogue. His jokes about him being a ladies man and his car rocket off to the sky, while some jokes - whether it's Ben arguing with a kid that his father didn't kill the president or Ben and Abigail faux-arguing in a British building - fall embarrasingly flat. This is just me talking.The performances are fine if you can ignore the mind-numbing dialogue. Nicolas Cage doesn't elevate the boring environment like he otherwise did in ""Ghost Rider"" or ""Next"", but at least he tries to bring his quirky mannerisms into the fray. The same with Diane Krueger, who is lively enough to make you forget that she's flat-out explaining the plot (someone give her a good film to work with!). Even Jon Voight and Helen Mirren do what's best with the dialogue they're given, though I wish Voight wouldn't slum after doing such a good job in ""Transformers"" (there's even some lame attempt at pathos here).I don't know. Some people are going to get a rise out of this piece of entertainment, because, hey, it's PG? But ""Transformers"" was PG-13, and it took on some hefty risks and came out a winner. With a predictable ending to top it all off, and a promise that a third ""National Treasure"" is in waiting, maybe Jerry Bruckheimer should stick to his TV shows. Cause since the last two Pirates of the Carribean movies, and Michael Bay living off the $700 million success story that was ""Transformers"", maybe the former action producer has dried up.",4,"""And so it begins, another Gates family quest.""",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,4012,"['treasure', 'hunter', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'breaking', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'out', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'was', 'one', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'clear', 'father', 'name', 'Ben', 'Abigail', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'parents', 'Jon', 'Vought', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'trek', 'world', 'find', 'clues', 'would', 'lead', 'whereabouts', 'evidence', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sandusky', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'brought', 'up', 'charges', 'find', 'simplistic', 'story', 'right', 'Well', 'apparently', 'someone', 'forgot', 'tell', 'director', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'end', '2004', 'director', 'brought', 'somewhat', 'family-friendly', 'version', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'theaters', 'titled', 'National', 'Treasure', 'fine', 'films', 'succeed', 'as', 'long', 'invite', 'audience', 'ride', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer-produced', 'film', 'starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Rock', 'Turteltaub', 'bathed', 'whole', 'film', 'non-stop', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'reducing', 'character', 'personalities', 'simply', 'stock', 'figures', 'flat', 'out', 'tell', 'story', 'even', 'performances', 'actors', 'Cage', 'Bartha', 'Krueger', 'Voight', 'are', 'lively', 'enough', 'be', 'enjoyable.Things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'only', 'changes', 'made', 'sequel', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'different', 'story', 'more', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'nondescript', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'President', 'more', 'locations', 'travel', 'Turteltaub', 'looking', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '-type', 'adventure', 'last', 'roundabout', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'up', 'challenge', 'dialogue', 'still', 'explanatory', 'instead', 'inviting', 'Transformers', 'had', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'story', 'key', 'word', 'somewhat', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'director', 'four', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'films', 'allowed', 'plot', 'be', 'easy', 'hang', 'words', 'being', 'explained', 'non-stop.Because', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'Turteltaub', 'galls', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', '11', 'overcompensate', 'let', 'audience', 'get', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'also', 'forgettable', 'score', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'got', 'exhausted', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'least', 'avoid', 'exposition', 'small', 'percentage', 'time', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Bartha', 'guy', 'who', 'ripped', 'playing', 'out', 'lousy', 'jokes', 'worn', 'out', 'welcome', 'least', 'trying', 'stay', 'afloat', 'drowning', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'jokes', 'being', 'ladies', 'man', 'car', 'rocket', 'sky', 'jokes', 'Ben', 'arguing', 'kid', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'president', 'Ben', 'Abigail', 'faux-arguing', 'British', 'building', 'fall', 'embarrasingly', 'flat', 'just', 'talking.The', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'can', 'ignore', 'mind-numbing', 'dialogue', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'boring', 'environment', 'otherwise', 'did', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Next', 'least', 'bring', 'quirky', 'mannerisms', 'fray', 'same', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'who', 'lively', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'flat-out', 'explaining', 'plot', 'someone', 'give', 'good', 'film', 'work', 'Even', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'given', 'wish', 'Voight', 'would', ""n't"", 'slum', 'doing', 'such', 'good', 'job', 'Transformers', 'even', 'lame', 'attempt', 'pathos', 'here', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'rise', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'hey', 'PG', 'Transformers', 'was', 'PG-13', 'took', 'hefty', 'risks', 'came', 'out', 'winner', 'predictable', 'ending', 'top', 'off', 'promise', 'third', 'National', 'Treasure', 'waiting', 'maybe', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'should', 'stick', 'TV', 'shows', 'Cause', 'last', 'two', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'movies', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'living', 'off', '700', 'million', 'success', 'story', 'was', 'Transformers', 'maybe', 'former', 'action', 'producer', 'dried', 'up']",N/A

What he learns is that the Confederate movement was searching for a legendary treasure - The City of Gold - to bolster and fund their resistance efforts, and that Thomas Gates refused to help them. We soon discover Wilkinson's ulterior motive for maligning Thomas Gates - to get Ben in on the hunt for the treasure. Pretty soon, all of the old gang - Riley Poole (Justin Bartha - so cute!), Abigail Chase (Diane Krueger), and Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), with the addition of Ben's mom (a wonderful performance by Helen Mirren) - are following the clues and putting the puzzle pieces together.Along the way, Ben kidnaps the President of the United States (for about 20 minutes), sneaks a look at the President's Book of Secrets, and re-connects with Abigail.I thought this movie was fun and entertaining. I like Nicholas Cage as Ben Gates more than any role he's played in recent memory, and Mirren added a classy touch to the cast. And though I usually hate blatant set-ups for future sequels in the franchise, this movie's reference to ""page 47"" in the Book of Secrets was actually intriguing. Let's hope that the next movie focuses less on finding an EVEN MORE SUPER-FABULOUS treasure and more on some other aspect of the adventure.",4,There's gold in them thar . . . rocks and water and stuff,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,2050,"['Even', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'National', 'Treasure', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'when', 'second', 'one', 'came', 'thought', 'How', 'can', 'top', 'awesome', 'treasure', 'found', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'formula', 'movie', 'treasure', 'hunting', 'history', 'action', 'still', 'works.In', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'now', 'respected', 'scholar', 'making', 'presentation', 'great-great-grandfather', 'role', 'trying', 'stop', 'assassination', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'Out', 'audience', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'perhaps', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'was', 'mastermind', 'entire', 'assassination', 'Wilkinson', 'page', 'diary', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'evidence', 'theory.In', 'effort', 'clear', 'ancestor', 'name', 'Ben', 'investigating', 'What', 'Confederate', 'movement', 'was', 'searching', 'legendary', 'treasure', 'City', 'Gold', 'bolster', 'fund', 'resistance', 'efforts', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'refused', 'help', 'soon', 'discover', 'Wilkinson', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'maligning', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'get', 'Ben', 'hunt', 'treasure', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'old', 'gang', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'so', 'cute', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'Patrick', 'Gates', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'addition', 'Ben', 'mom', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'are', 'following', 'clues', 'putting', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'way', 'Ben', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'look', 'President', 'Book', 'Secrets', 're-connects', 'Abigail.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'like', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Ben', 'more', 'role', 'played', 'recent', 'memory', 'Mirren', 'added', 'classy', 'touch', 'cast', 'usually', 'hate', 'blatant', 'set-ups', 'future', 'sequels', 'franchise', 'movie', 'reference', 'page', '47', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'was', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'Let', 'hope', 'next', 'movie', 'less', 'finding', 'EVEN', 'MORE', 'SUPER-FABULOUS', 'treasure', 'more', 'other', 'aspect', 'adventure']",N/A

I also admitt to being a ' fan' of History, and am fully in favor of films that involve the audience in the intricacies of the past.After the first film, I was ready for more....Well, for the most part, I got more...and sadly, I also got LESS.The second romp with Nicholas Cage and Co. ( a likeable crew of actors portraying a likeable crew of characters) is just not as cohesive or intelligent as the first film. The flow is stagey and some action parts of it are just ridiculous.( Where was The Metropolitan Police Force during that drawn out London car chase ??... How did these bad guys get so many GUNS onto British soil ??..and WHY are they unafraid to so casually display and use them ??? ...And WHY, OH, WHY does The Villain end up not only with such a flimsy motivation, but on a polite and friendly  first name basis with our incredibly understanding Hero ??? This villain has publically and privately wronged his family ...This guy has employed thugs to either kidnap, beat up,threaten to kill and/or otherwise endanger the hero`s family, friends and countless innocent bystanders...Is it just me, or do people generally not feel very mellow towards someone like that? )Despite an even more intriguing premise ( clearing The Family Name of Injustice) and a more viable historical springboard ( John Wilkes Booth, The Knights Of The Golden Circle) the film swerves off on a search for a Lost City Of Gold ( I guess Confederate Conspiracy and a Lost Confederate Treasure just were not enough of a McGuffin ). Apparently, the fact that Cibola was never thought to be located anywhere near The Dakotas is beside the point when you want to do the first big screen location shooting of Mt. Rushmore since Hitchcock sent Cary Grant up a president`s nose.  So much for History.All that having been addressed, it is still a fun film, just not up to the previous one. I still hope for another entry ..another ""National Treasure"" hunt, as it were.As for the dvd release; the Bonus selections are a big disappointment. They are not 'features', but a collection of FEATUR-ETTES, too many running less than ten minutes. Mayhap it`s just me, but I believe that if you are going to evoke History as your plot, it makes sense to hand people a bit more of The Facts on the ""Collectors` Edition"" DVD  release than a 3 minute, 17 second run-down on The Knights Of The Golden Circle,  and I guess there just isn`t all that much inside The Library Of Congress if the best it merits is 8 minutes, 49 seconds on a dvd.  (They stayed well clear of the facts on Cibola in the bonus selection as well as the plot)Not surprisingly, the longest running of the FEATURETTES deal with ""How We Made the Movie""( Again, so much for History.)Before anyone goes off about my stringent standards, I will point out that the Historical Feature Documentaries on the Young Indiana Jones dvd sets are EXCELLENT with most of the documentaries lasting longer than the fictional material they accompany. YES, History IS worth the effort !I noted one Amazon reviewer gushing about ""The wealth of material""  on the Book Of Secrets bonus disc...Well, the entire thing runs all of ONE HOUR AND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES. When you can cover TEN topics in less than an hour and a half, it is NOT  a ""wealth of material"" .Bottom Line: Rent the two-disc 'Collectors', or buy  the plain jane version without the bonus disc.",3,TARNISHED TREASURE.,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,3480,"['begin', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'National', 'Treasure', 'was', 'witty', 'fun', 'overall', 'intelligent', 'also', 'admitt', 'being', 'fan', 'History', 'am', 'fully', 'favor', 'films', 'involve', 'audience', 'intricacies', 'past.After', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'more', '.Well', 'most', 'part', 'got', 'more', 'sadly', 'also', 'got', 'LESS.The', 'second', 'romp', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Co.', 'likeable', 'crew', 'actors', 'portraying', 'likeable', 'crew', 'characters', 'just', 'not', 'cohesive', 'intelligent', 'first', 'film', 'flow', 'stagey', 'action', 'parts', 'are', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Where', 'was', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'Force', 'out', 'London', 'car', 'chase', 'How', 'did', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'GUNS', 'British', 'soil', '..and', 'WHY', 'are', 'unafraid', 'so', 'casually', 'display', 'use', 'WHY', 'OH', 'WHY', 'Villain', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'flimsy', 'motivation', 'polite', 'friendly', 'first', 'name', 'basis', 'incredibly', 'understanding', 'Hero', 'villain', 'publically', 'privately', 'wronged', 'family', 'guy', 'employed', 'thugs', 'kidnap', 'beat', 'up', 'threaten', 'kill', 'and/or', 'otherwise', 'endanger', 'hero', 's', 'family', 'friends', 'countless', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'just', 'do', 'people', 'generally', 'not', 'feel', 'very', 'mellow', 'towards', 'someone', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'clearing', 'Family', 'Name', 'Injustice', 'more', 'viable', 'historical', 'springboard', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'Knights', 'Golden', 'Circle', 'film', 'off', 'search', 'Lost', 'City', 'Gold', 'guess', 'Confederate', 'Conspiracy', 'Lost', 'Confederate', 'Treasure', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'McGuffin', 'Apparently', 'fact', 'Cibola', 'was', 'never', 'thought', 'be', 'located', 'anywhere', 'Dakotas', 'point', 'when', 'want', 'do', 'first', 'big', 'screen', 'location', 'shooting', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'Hitchcock', 'sent', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'up', 'president', 's', 'nose', 'So', 'much', 'History.All', 'having', 'been', 'addressed', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'previous', 'one', 'still', 'hope', 'entry', 'National', 'Treasure', 'hunt', 'dvd', 'release', 'Bonus', 'selections', 'are', 'big', 'disappointment', 'are', 'not', ""'features"", 'collection', 'FEATUR-ETTES', 'too', 'many', 'running', 'less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Mayhap', 's', 'just', 'believe', 'are', 'going', 'evoke', 'History', 'plot', 'sense', 'hand', 'people', 'bit', 'more', 'Facts', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'release', '3', 'minute', '17', 'second', 'run-down', 'Knights', 'Golden', 'Circle', 'guess', 'there', 'just', 'isn', 't', 'that', 'much', 'Library', 'Congress', 'best', '8', 'minutes', '49', 'seconds', 'dvd', 'stayed', 'well', 'clear', 'facts', 'Cibola', 'bonus', 'selection', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'longest', 'running', 'FEATURETTES', 'deal', 'How', 'Made', 'Movie', 'Again', 'so', 'much', 'History', 'anyone', 'stringent', 'standards', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'Historical', 'Feature', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'dvd', 'sets', 'are', 'EXCELLENT', 'most', 'documentaries', 'lasting', 'longer', 'fictional', 'material', 'accompany', 'YES', 'History', 'IS', 'effort', 'noted', 'one', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'gushing', 'wealth', 'material', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'disc', 'Well', 'entire', 'thing', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'TWENTY', 'FIVE', 'MINUTES', 'When', 'can', 'cover', 'TEN', 'topics', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'NOT', 'wealth', 'material', '.Bottom', 'Line', 'Rent', 'two-disc', ""'Collectors"", 'buy', 'plain', 'jane', 'version', 'bonus', 'disc']",N/A

While giving a lecture at a college about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and their Great grandfather's involvement and subsequent murder on the same night a man named Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) steps forward to introduce new evidence regarding the event.

There were too many lucky breakins, too many lucky heist, too many easy solutions and a way too easy kidknapping. It just got to feeling a little to lucky and a little too convenient.Overall: I don't mean push the movie too far down because it was still an enjoyable to watch.

Disney is top notch with fairy tales like the colors and details of a Thomas Kincaid canvas.Even the awkward underdog, Gates' sidekick gets a gal at the end!National Treasure 2 is filled with contradictions between true history and what was made for the screen.And as one who is proud of my own heritage, I noticed that in the scene near the end when the president and Gates are in the hanger, all the state flags of the Union can be seen in the foreground, all except of course, poor Mississippi. If you remember the flag's design, you'll understand this pathetic attempt at political correctness. Disney is top notch with political correctness!I think a greater audience, however will notice that the luck of actually surviving the dozens of near misses are pretty far fetched to the woefully unreal. On one hand you have fiction and on the other you have the bullet proof luck of the Road Runner's Coyote.Here are some other unnatural parts of the film that I found more than a little distracting.-They found oil in the chambers of the lost city of gold to light their lamps. For one, ground oil had not been discovered until the 19th century in America and was rarely used as a lighting method. Whale oil was used and no way indians could have had whale oil in South Dakota.-The stone monuments and paths in the so-called city of gold within Mount Rushmore did not contain stone native to that region such as limestone.-It seemed too easy for Gates and his posy to avoid both the Royal Guard in Buckingham Palace and the White House and the FBI. They had the luck of spies.-The same moment they decided to capture the president just so happened to be the one moment where the president would be speaking at a specific place where Gates knew there was a secret tunnel to accomplish it.-Many of the clues and riddles were solved way too quick, even for a character like Gates. They were much to general for him to discover meaning in less than a minute. Like for example atop Mount Rushmore when he discovered in twenty-seconds what a cloudless rain meant. It took him less than twenty seconds to find the exact one-foot of space on the giant summit of Mount Rushmore to poor the water on to the rock to reveal the cave opening.-Within the mountain they are swinging around on ropes that were thousands of years old. Yeah...-Isn't it strange how Gates' family history had been involved in one way or another with both the secret treasure of Alexander hidden by the forefathers and eighty-nine years later in a completely different treasure hidden scene, the Gates were involved with the City of Gold?The odds are impossible sense neither story had a connection to it nor neither ancestor had been involved except through chance.-Lastly, it is a laughable chance that the expert on the vague yet specific era of Native writing that Gates needed to decode a clue just so happened to be his Mom.And I have a historical bone to pick with this movie.Characters at the beginning of the movie refer to Southern sympathizers in the North as traitors against the Union and villains associated with Lincoln's assignation.To call men working for the independence of a set of states from their former government traitors would be no different than calling those who worked for the independence of the set of colonies from England traitors.""If we were wrong in our contest, then the Declaration of Independence of 1776 was a grave mistake and the revolution to which it led was a crime. If Washington was a patriot; Lee cannot have been a rebel.""-Major General Wade Hampton, Confederate CavalryThe ""traitors"" referred to in this film were basically a high-organized network of Northern citizens during the civil war that were committed to helping a new nation achieve its independence from the Union and obtain peace and an end to the bloodshed.A character in the film referred to them as Southern extremists. They were portrayed as those responsible for Booth's four years too late point blank shot.  Actually, there is no evidence that ever existed which could truly link the Knights of the Golden Circle or any Confederate group with the assignation of Lincoln.In another scene in the film a child stands his ground against the main character, Gates, arguing that Lincoln's death had been master minded by members of the Federal Government by pointing out that on the night Lincoln was shot, his bodyguard was strangely absent and that the one bridge unguarded by Federal troops that evening gave Booth his easy escape.  Yet, the main character, with a chilling similarity to many of today's revisionists reproved with the more accepted teachings when in truth, the young character's argument has footing in historical evidence.In the movie's opening scene, a subtitle reads that the Civil War had been over for five days on April 14th.  On April 14th the armies and navy of the Confederate states, with the exception of the Army of Northern Virginia were still active in the field.  The Confederate government, led by Davis, continued to operate even while evading Grant's forces in Virginia and North Carolina. Civil War combat and the maneuvering of both Confederate and Union forces did not end until at least a month later.  Brig. General Stand Watie, the highest-ranking Native American officer in the Civil War, was the last to formally surrender a Confederate land force on the date of June 23, 1865.  The Confederate raider, CSS Shenandoah after being the only Civil War ship to of completely circled to globe, did not bring down their flag until docking in Liverpool, England, in November.Despite what happened on 9th or 14th of April of 1865, the war continued.In the movie, the character Gates boasts that his ancestor, killed by a Southern bad guy, had died for his country.  To be perfectly technical, his ancestor's character was killed defending a country whose cause was to destroy another's independence.Though the film is not based on the Civil War, it includes many of the revisionist barbs found in films that center on the topic.What if the careless and off handed slandering towards the South in National Treasure 2 was directed towards the North instead?  What if the character of Gates had, instead of the original plot, embarked on a treasure hunt to prove that his ancestors was not among the officers in Kilpatrick's 1864 raid to assassinate President Davis?  What if a Unionist group in the South had been portrayed as traitors?When you take a moment to imagine how this would offend you, understand then, why I feel that films like this are offensive to those of us that feel compelled to defend our heritage. Or any devoted to historical truth.",3,Didn't enjoy this one at all.,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,7022,"['movie', 'times', 'filled', 'holes', 'plot', 'producers', 'audience', 'mind', 'same',

What they discover was that Queen Victoria supported the Southerner's cause and she was attempting to help them find a treasure to finance the war.Naturally, there's a treasure involved--the famed City of Gold. In order to find this treasure, they must race against Mitch Wilkinson and kidnap the US President to get to the Presidential Book of Secrets, containing information about everything from the City of Gold to Area 51 and the Kennedy Assassination.Along the way, Ben's ex-girlfriend, Abigail, and Mom, Dr. Em Appleton, are added to the treasure hunting crew.In my opinion, ""Book of Secrets"" has exceeded the ""National Treasure.""

This cross between RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (lite) with THE DAVINCI CODE (lite) will not stick in your memory for more than a few minutes after you leave the theatre...but  you'll at least remember having a more or less fun time.Nicholas Cage (with his bad hair-dye) is at least having more fun than he did in NEXT, WICKER MAN and GHOST RIDER.  In those films, he looked absolutely exhausted and bored.  The NATIONAL TREASURE films seem to spur him to some good energy.  He clearly enjoys the upbeat attitude of these films...a kind of ""can do"" feeling.  He plays Ben Gates, a renowned ""treasure  hunter"" who in this film is in search of nothing less than the famed City Of Gold:  Cibola.  He wants to find this to clear the name of his great-great grandfather...who is accused of conspiring with John Wilkes Booth to kill Lincoln.  Sure, seeing the City of Gold would be nice...but clearing his family's name is more important.After much running about in Europe, he and his team realize that in order to complete their quest (which basically is following one clue/puzzle to another), they must have access to the legendary ""President's Book of Secrets,"" which only the President of the United States ever gets to see.  So naturally, Cage must kidnap the president so he can have some time alone with the man to convince him to let him have the book.  It's at this point that the movie goes completely off the deep-end...and in a way, that's the most fun.  There is really not one single second of the film that is credible in any way...but if you are making a film that silly, you might as well work hard to outdo yourself.  So yes, the film builds the silliness quotient to almost ridiculous  heights...but if you go with it, and put your inner adult away from two hours...you'll have fun.As I said, Cage is engaged in the film.  Jon Voight, as his father, seems just a tiny bit lost in his role...like he's having trouble following the plot...but he's full of vim and vigor.  He's matched by Helen Mirren as his feisty ex-wife, who just happens to be an expert in a long extinct Native American language that the hunters just happen to need translated.  What a happy coincidence!  But it's fun seeing Mirren engaging in a little action and trying to hold on to her American accent.  Diane Kruger is Cage's love interest...she's bland but game enough.  Bruce Greenwood is the president (something he's done before, I feel certain) and this Canadian actor pulls it off with panache.  Ed Harris is the primary villain of the piece, and  his character is poorly defined, so Harris just plays him with generic villainy...it's not really his fault, but just about anyone could have done the part as well.  Also, Harvey Keitel shows up in a completely dispensable cameo...and looks totally out of place in the whole film.However, the movie is nearly stolen by virtual unknown Justin Bartha, as Cage's fellow treasure hunter Riley Poole.  He's a bundle of clumsy energy, eager to please, eager for attention, a bit of a geek but also brave and smart.  He's almost manic in the role...but his gleeful demeanor brightens up every scene he's in.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a great performance...but it is  most in keeping with the spirit of the movie.The special effects are generically impressive.  When they arrive at the City (is that a spoiler?  Does anyone actually doubt for one second they will find it?), it's one of those spectacular underground temple/palace/treasure piles that we've seen a MILLION times before (THE MUMMY and TOMB RAIDER spring to mind.)  It's huge, and it's also completely unimaginative.  It's at this point that I most felt like all this movie really has to offer is a big screen version of any one of a thousand computer games where you following one puzzling clue to another to another.This COULD be highly depressing, and make one feel that one's money has been wasted on totally unimaginative and derivative junk.  That's certainly how a lot of critics took the film.  But on the other hand, you could accept the film in the spirit it's been offered.  True, it's a sequel that exists purely to cash in...but it delivers everything a person going to see it could want.  That it slips from memory almost entirely upon leaving the theatre probably just means that everyone will buy the DVD so they can recapture what they saw, enjoyed and forgot.",3,Fun romp...forgettable but delivers solid diversion.  3.5 stars,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,4498,"['can', 'get', 'silly', 'title', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'SECRETS', 'diverting', 'couple', 'hours', 'movie', 'cross', 'RAIDERS', 'OF', 'THE', 'LOST', 'ARC', 'lite', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'lite', 'will', 'not', 'stick', 'memory', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'leave', 'theatre', ""'ll"", 'least', 'remember', 'having', 'more', 'less', 'fun', 'time.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'bad', 'hair-dye', 'least', 'having', 'more', 'fun', 'did', 'NEXT', 'WICKER', 'MAN', 'GHOST', 'RIDER', 'films', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'exhausted', 'bored', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'seem', 'spur', 'good', 'energy', 'clearly', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'films', 'kind', 'can', 'do', 'feeling', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'renowned', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'who', 'film', 'search', 'nothing', 'less', 'famed', 'City', 'Gold', 'Cibola', 'find', 'clear', 'name', 'great-great', 'grandfather', 'who', 'accused', 'conspiring', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'Sure', 'seeing', 'City', 'Gold', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'clearing', 'family', 'name', 'more', 'important.After', 'much', 'running', 'about', 'Europe', 'team', 'realize', 'order', 'complete', 'quest', 'basically', 'following', 'one', 'clue/puzzle', 'must', 'have', 'access', 'legendary', 'President', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'only', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'ever', 'see', 'So', 'naturally', 'Cage', 'must', 'kidnap', 'president', 'can', 'have', 'time', 'alone', 'man', 'convince', 'let', 'have', 'book', 'point', 'movie', 'completely', 'deep-end', 'way', 'most', 'fun', 'really', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'second', 'film', 'credible', 'way', 'are', 'making', 'film', 'silly', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'hard', 'outdo', 'So', 'yes', 'film', 'silliness', 'quotient', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'heights', 'go', 'put', 'inner', 'adult', 'away', 'two', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun.As', 'said', 'Cage', 'engaged', 'film', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'father', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'lost', 'role', 'having', 'trouble', 'following', 'plot', 'full', 'vim', 'vigor', 'matched', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'feisty', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'expert', 'long', 'extinct', 'Native', 'American', 'language', 'hunters', 'just', 'happen', 'need', 'translated', 'What', 'happy', 'coincidence', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Mirren', 'engaging', 'little', 'action', 'trying', 'hold', 'American', 'accent', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Cage', 'love', 'interest', 'bland', 'game', 'enough', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'president', 'something', 'done', 'feel', 'certain', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'off', 'panache', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'primary', 'villain', 'piece', 'character', 'poorly', 'defined', 'so', 'Harris', 'just', 'generic', 'villainy', 'not', 'really', 'fault', 'just', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'part', 'well', 'Also', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'up', 'completely', 'dispensable', 'cameo', 'totally', 'place', 'whole', 'film.However', 'movie', 'nearly', 'stolen', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Cage', 'fellow', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'bundle', 'clumsy', 'energy', 'eager', 'please', 'eager', 'attention', 'bit', 'geek', 'also', 'brave', 'smart', 'almost', 'manic', 'role', 'gleeful', 'demeanor', 'up', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'great', 'performance', 'most', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'movie.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'generically', 'impressive', 'When', 'arrive', 'City', 'spoiler', 'Does', 'anyone', 'actually', 'doubt', 'one', 'second', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'spectacular', 'underground', 'temple/palace/treasure', 'piles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'MILLION', 'times', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'TOMB', 'RAIDER', 'spring', 'mind', 'huge', 'also', 'completely', 'unimaginative', 'point', 'most', 'felt', 'movie', 'really', 'offer', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'one', 'thousand', 'computer', 'games', 'where', 'following', 'one', 'puzzling', 'clue', 'another.This', 'COULD', 'be', 'highly', 'depressing', 'make', 'one', 'feel', 'one', 'money', 'been', 'wasted', 'totally', 'unimaginative', 'derivative', 'junk', 'certainly', 'how', 'lot', 'critics', 'took', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'accept', 'film', 'spirit', 'been', 'offered', 'True', 'sequel', 'purely', 'cash', 'everything', 'person', 'going', 'see', 'could', 'want', 'memory', 'almost', 'entirely', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'probably', 'just', 'everyone', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'can', 'recapture', 'what', 'saw', 'enjoyed', 'forgot']",N/A
1117857,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000YABYPQ,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","National Treasure Two(released Dec/07)is another wonderful entry in the franchise that,in my opinion, is every bit as good as the first one.Like the first film our central character is very much the Indiana Jones type,very scholarly,a brilliant symbologist and with a big dollop of the adventurer thrown in for good measure.The story this time around involves(again)our central protagonist Ben Gates(Nicholoaus Cage)and with his family past called to question.His great,great grandfather died trying to save a secret organization from getting it's hands on the legendary City Of Gold built by ancient Amerindians.In fact the day he died is the day this organization headed by John Booth,assassinated President Lincoln.The scene shifts to present day where Ben and his father Patrick(Jon Voight)are finishing a lecture and a descendant of a member of the secret organization Mitch Wilkinson(Ed Harris),interrupts the proceedings.He claims Ben's great,great grandfather was a traitor and offers up a piece of old parchment to prove it.The story makes headlines and the family becomes disgraced,which of course doesn't sit well with Ben.Ben and his wife Abigail(Diane Kruger) are estranged and he has to approach her,much to his chagrin,for assistance.They examine the Booth page/book closely and find clues.They travel to Paris and then to London.It seems an old British ship the HMS Resolute when salvaged and then scrapped,provided more than enough timber to build two desks with;one in Buckingham Palace and the other in the oval office of the White House.They find an old partial cuneiform-like tablet in the Queens desk and manage to escape security there....just.They are dogged all the way by Wilkinson who threw up the ""traitor"" red herring as a ruse so Ben would lead him to the ultimate treasure they all seek.Back in Washington Ben and Abigail get into the oval office and gain access to the desk to find no matching tablet but a clue.This clue tells them the piece of the puzzle they seek is in a secret document called""The President's Secret Book"".This book contains a myriad of US secret information,some known or little or not known,passed down president by president for many,many decades.In order to get a hold of this book Ben decides to capture the President himself!On a trip to a hotel in Mount Vernon,Virginia,Ben infiltrates a party the President is attending there and shows him an old map of the hotel.The original plan drawings show an underground escape passage covered up but never found.A curious President and a very anxious Ben find the tunnel and this is where Ben asks him to see the book.The President obfuscates but in the end,knowing Ben's actual intentions,reveals its' existence and its' location in the Library of Congress.But he is warned that once he gets back he will have no choice but to sick the FBI on him.Ben gets to the Library and gets his book and the clue.The first clue(from the desk in London) had been translated by his mother Emily(Helen Mirren) and now his father approaches his estranged wife for help again.She translates it and he leaves.Unbeknownst to him his wife had been under duress by Wilkinson,hidden in the back,who threatened harm to both if she revealed his presence.The new clue leads them all to a lake above and behind Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.From here they enter a system of caves with the requisite number of booby traps.Eventually persistence pays off and they all find the lost City of Gold and its' treasure.There are alot of tense moments and in a big reversal Wilkinson is forced to give his life so the others may escape.The FBI finally get their man and escort Ben and company to a private airplane hangar to meet...the President.He congratulates them and their service to the country as the charges of ""kidnapping"" are stricken.The President takes Ben aside asking him if he had a chance to look at page 47 of the Secret Book during its' perusal.Ben replies he did,he could provide assistance there and that it is life altering....and they walk off camera together.The movie ends with Ben's friend getting his Porsche car back which had been towed earlier in the picture;tax free.But the real ending occurred in that hangar and its' reference to that mysterious page 47-sequel anyone?.Like the first movie the clues of legends combined with half truths and old symbology issue forth like a maniacal popcorn machine,flying at you from all directions.They don't want you stopping to analyze them but to just accept them and let the on screen characters take their plot clues from them and let things move where they will.And move things do as slowly but surely Ben,his friend,he wife,his father and now his mother all become involved in the hunt.It is a solid cast as all the major actors from the first film are back as well,as mentioned,his mother Emily played wonderfully salty by Helen Mirren.Added into the mix is our antagonist Wilkinson also played wonderfully by Ed Harris.Technically speaking the movie has been transferred wonderfully as the film is crisp and clear.It retains it's widescreen a/r of 2:35:1,however there are NO special features but a commentary by the director and Jon Voight on this single disc edition.You will recall National Treasure One which had a plethora of extras on one disc.Seems Disney ""gives"" you the first,getting you ""hooked"" enough where they think you will happily pay the extra dineros for an extra disc this time around.All in all a very pleasing film up to standards set by the first movie.The cast is 100% solid all the way and thesps Helen Mirren and Ed Harris make the adventure just that much better.Disney loses extra marks here however for their decided cheapness in not including any worthwhile extras this time around;nothing new for them.Enjoy the second National Treasure ride!",4,National Treasure

The original was a surprise hit and made money.  But it had a kernel of an idea and a plot that almost worked.  The sequel looks like a clone of the original.

1117862,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YABYPQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2In ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets,"" the 2007 sequel to the original ""National Treasure"" from 2004, historian Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) finds himself in the distinctly unenviable position of having to clear his great-great-grandfather's name from the charge - being leveled by a black market antiquities dealer (Ed Harris) - that his forefather played a major role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  In order to prove the accusation wrong, thereby restoring not only his ancestor`s reputation but his own in the process, Gates must uncover the whereabouts of a treasure map leading to the fabled City of Gold built by a tribe of pre-Columbian Native Americans.  (And don't bother asking how those two things are related because, even after watching the movie, I`m still not sure I would be able to tell you).""Book of Secrets,"" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub and directed by Turteltaub, is a giant Rube Goldberg contraption about a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions.  In terms of the story, there are more twists and turns, leaps in logic, conspiracy theories and contrived red herrings than even the most astute puzzle-solver should be required to keep up with.  Luckily, the action moves along at a quick enough pace - including an impressive car chase through the streets and alleyways of London - that one doesn't have much time to question the sense of it all.The actors certainly do throw themselves into the spirit of the enterprise, running around like mad through an assortment of colorful, touristy settings - from the Eiffel Tower to Buckingham Palace to the White House to Mount Vernon to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore - but the film, taken as a whole, is a pretty soulless exercise overall.  Most grating is the stereotypical love/hate relationship between Ben and his ex-girlfriend, Abigail (Diane Kruger), an archivist at the National Archives, who are obviously still hopelessly, madly in love with one another and only need one more epic, life-threatening adventure to bring that truth home to them - which puts the audience one step ahead of the sleuthers to begin with.  And as if that weren`t enough, we're treated to a second bickering couple - Ben's divorced mother (Helen Mirren) and father (Jon Voight) - to parallel the first and double our displeasure.The problem with a movie like this one is that, no matter how well it's put together on a technical level, finally, after what feels like the thousandth uncovered clue and the millionth hairbreadth escape from a fate-worse-than-death, the viewer simply exhausts himself trying to keep up with it all and stops paying attention.",2,fast-paced but hollow puzzle-drama,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2653,"['National', 'Treasure', 'Book', 'Secrets', '2007', 'sequel', 'original', 'National', 'Treasure', '2004', 'historian', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'distinctly', 'unenviable', 'position', 'having', 'clear', 'great-great-grandfather', 'name', 'charge', 'being', 'leveled', 'black', 'market', 'antiquities', 'dealer', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'forefather', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'order', 'prove', 'accusation', 'wrong', 'thereby', 'restoring', 'not', 'only', 'ancestor', 's', 'reputation', 'own', 'process', 'must', 'uncover', 'whereabouts', 'treasure', 'map', 'leading', 'fabled', 'City', 'Gold', 'built', 'tribe', 'pre-Columbian', 'Native', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'asking', 'how', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'related', 'even', 'watching', 'movie', 'm', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'produced', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'directed', 'Turteltaub', 'giant', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'contraption', 'series', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'contraptions', 'terms', 'story', 'are', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'leaps', 'logic', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'contrived', 'red', 'herrings', 'even', 'most', 'astute', 'puzzle-solver', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'keep', 'up', 'Luckily', 'action', 'along', 'quick', 'enough', 'pace', 'including', 'impressive', 'car', 'chase', 'streets', 'alleyways', 'London', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'question', 'sense', 'all.The', 'actors', 'certainly', 'do', 'throw', 'spirit', 'enterprise', 'running', 'around', 'mad', 'assortment', 'colorful', 'touristy', 'settings', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'White', 'House', 'Mount', 'Vernon', 'Library', 'Congress', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'film', 'taken', 'whole', 'pretty', 'soulless', 'exercise', 'overall', 'Most', 'grating', 'stereotypical', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Abigail', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'archivist', 'National', 'Archives', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'still', 'hopelessly', 'madly', 'love', 'one', 'only', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'epic', 'life-threatening', 'adventure', 'bring', 'truth', 'home', 'audience', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'sleuthers', 'begin', 'weren', 't', 'enough', ""'re"", 'treated', 'second', 'bickering', 'couple', 'Ben', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'father', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'parallel', 'first', 'double', 'displeasure.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'one', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'technical', 'level', 'finally', 'what', 'thousandth', 'uncovered', 'clue', 'millionth', 'hairbreadth', 'escape', 'fate-worse-than-death', 'viewer', 'simply', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'stops', 'paying', 'attention']",N/A

It has the obligatory car chase with the suitable amount of car crashes and destruction to appeal to those who equate the quality of the movie to the number of car smashes and special effects.  Of course the police never get involved and the good guys always get away. What is truly amazing in the film is that all of the machinery, latches, and levers work on the first try hundreds or even thousands of years after being installed and left unused -- a real tribute to ancient technology.  Nicolas Cage is amazing in his ability to solve clues and ciphers with just a glance.  This movie is  cross between Indiana Jones Meets the Olmecs and a Symbologist Redeems the Family Tree -- it's a fairy tale with almost no effort to achieve a semblance of reality.  Having pointed out the many flaws in this movie I would like to say that Jon Voigt does a very good job as does the actress who played his wife.  The side kick Riley has the best lines in the movie and does a very good job as the comedy relief.  I enjoyed the film and gave it three stars because it is fun with a bang-up ending.

Booth and another associate meet Thomas Gates inside an inn to help them resolve a cipher/ a code to gain entry to a city of gold for the KGC (a southern extremist group at that time dedicated to maintaining the confederacy), While Thomas Gates thwarts their attempt at trying to destroy the clue to the treasure, his name comes up in a diary that lists out all the people involved in the assassination and years later, at present day he (Thomas Gates) is also named among the conspirators to kill Lincoln.Ben Gates now follows this to prove his ancestor's innocence and maintain that his ancestor is actually a hero.While, the sequence of events keeps you interested, the good part they have adopted is the similar thought process they used in National Treasure 1, the different clues and how they go after each puzzle to resolve the same. The only strange part is for starters the roles played by Ed Harris and to an extent by Helen Mirren, which leaves little to be noted and does not give a deeper background into their characters and yes.... sigh, Riley is still trying to get laid..Whilst owning it would be for die hard fans only, a rental is definitely worth it and good family fun.Note: Contrary to some folks finding it absurd, i rather found Cage's british impersonation to be funny!

It seems these days the movie franchises come in threes: Bourne series, Matix, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Oceans 11-13. In pretty much every case, the second outting is inferior to the first, but the series redeems inself with the third installment. NT2 on the other hand, took virtually the same story arc, plot devices and kept it interesting. I'm eager for the third installment. The star of NT2, Nicolas Cage, is one of those actors who I've had to develop a taste for, but lately I must say that he's come into his own. Even in his less successful movies (of late) like ""Next"" and ""Lord of War"" he's quite watchable. And though NT2 is a bit of an ensemble movie where the secondary roles are both well cast and well acted, Cage is the heart of the movie and rightly so. I also appreciated this movie for it's respectful treatment of the President - clearly meant to be George Bush II - something quite unusual for Hollywood.",4,National Treasure 2 is a treat.,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,1046,"['National', 'Treasure', '2', 'one', 'rare', 'sequels', 'original', 'liked', 'lot', 'days', 'movie', 'come', 'threes', 'Bourne', 'series', 'Matix', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Oceans', '11-13', 'pretty', 'much', 'case', 'second', 'outting', 'inferior', 'first', 'series', 'third', 'installment', 'NT2', 'other', 'hand', 'took', 'virtually', 'same', 'story', 'arc', 'plot', 'devices', 'kept', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'eager', 'third', 'installment', 'star', 'NT2', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'actors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'had', 'develop', 'taste', 'lately', 'must', 'say', 'come', 'own', 'Even', 'less', 'successful', 'movies', 'late', 'Next', 'Lord', 'War', 'quite', 'watchable', 'NT2', 'bit', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'where', 'secondary', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'well', 'acted', 'Cage', 'heart', 'movie', 'rightly', 'so', 'also', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'respectful', 'treatment', 'President', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'George', 'Bush', 'II', 'something', 'quite', 'unusual', 'Hollywood']",N/A

1117885,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000YABYPQ,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[40, 52]","The opening Goofy cartoon alone is worth the price of admission to this family friendly film.  Like most sequels, this one is generally satisfying, but no match to its predecessor as it simply isn't as fresh or original.Amazon's review is solid in hitting all the plot points and general positive and negatives about this film; therefore, I'll dispense with covering much of that as this film is really for die hard Cage fans and for those that loved the first Treasure film.  This one can't hold a candle to that one, but it does well enough on its own.The characters are all back and still fun, Riley is my favorite with lines like, ""Oh, here come my tax dollars to arrest me,"" and the addition of Ben Gates' mom played by Helen Mirren, who is supposedly so mean she can freeze beer with just a stare, is an asset to any film she graces.  Although Sean Bean was a far more interesting villain, Ed Harris, not new to playing a heavy (seeA History of ViolenceandJust Cause) is okay enough here.  Diane Kruger returns as Cage's nearly ex-wife and is just as charming and alluring as she was in the first (I love that accent of hers).  Of course, Jon Voight returns as Gates' dad and is hysterical in his scenes with Helen Mirren who always makes him feel like he's three years old.  Naturally, this film would be nothing without Cage's engaging performance at Ben Gates, although I do think he's doing a bit more ""going through the motions"" with this outing (and we are threatened with a third at the end).The plot like the first one is unbelievable and filled with holes, but also like the first one, we are willing to suspend our disbelief to enjoy the ride the film provides.  The chase scenes are exciting, but less believable than our first go-around.  Come on, London is known for having the world's largest parking lot for streets.  No one is car/bus chasing anyone through there!  However, like I said, we are along for the ride here and we know it's all silly stuff, but it is enjoyable even if it is a bit of a letdown in comparison to the firstNational Treasure.",3,"3.5 Stars for this unnecessary but fun sequel with an outstanding bonus ""Goofy"" cartoon",1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2072,"['opening', 'Goofy', 'cartoon', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'most', 'sequels', 'one', 'generally', 'satisfying', 'match', 'predecessor', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fresh', 'original.Amazon', 'review', 'solid', 'hitting', 'plot', 'points', 'general', 'positive', 'film', 'therefore', ""'ll"", 'dispense', 'covering', 'much', 'film', 'really', 'die', 'hard', 'Cage', 'fans', 'loved', 'first', 'Treasure', 'film', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'one', 'well', 'enough', 'own.The', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'still', 'fun', 'Riley', 'favorite', 'lines', 'Oh', 'here', 'come', 'tax', 'dollars', 'arrest', 'addition', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'mom', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'supposedly', 'so', 'mean', 'can', 'freeze', 'beer', 'just', 'stare', 'asset', 'film', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'villain', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'not', 'new', 'playing', 'heavy', 'seeA', 'History', 'ViolenceandJust', 'Cause', 'okay', 'enough', 'here', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Cage', 'nearly', 'ex-wife', 'just', 'charming', 'alluring', 'was', 'first', 'love', 'accent', 'hers', 'course', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'returns', 'Gates', 'dad', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'always', 'feel', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'Naturally', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'Cage', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'do', 'think', 'doing', 'bit', 'more', 'going', 'motions', 'outing', 'are', 'threatened', 'third', 'end', 'plot', 'first', 'one', 'unbelievable', 'filled', 'holes', 'also', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'film', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'less', 'believable', 'first', 'go-around', 'Come', 'London', 'known', 'having', 'world', 'largest', 'parking', 'lot', 'streets', 'one', 'car/bus', 'chasing', 'anyone', 'there', 'However', 'said', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'here', 'know', 'silly', 'stuff', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'bit', 'letdown', 'comparison', 'firstNational', 'Treasure']",N/A

Moreover, that in truth, these Native Americans weren't such dolts as to not value genuine treasure, such as precious metals. Building upon this myth is important to leftists, because the more they build up pre-Colombian Native Americans, the more what the ""whites"" supposedly did to them appears horrific.While not an expert on pre-Colombian Native North Americans, I am pretty sure the evidence is settled that these peoples never advanced beyond the Stone Age; meaning they never smelted metal, including gold, so they could hardly have built an entire city with it; moreover they never developed the wheel, so the elaborate mechanisms that guard the ""City of Gold"" are something equivalent to a reader of this review coming home to discover that the family cat had occupied his day repairing your broken flat-screen television. Also, while I am less sure of the following, I don't think there is much evidence to support that these people ever attached value to precious metals or stones (they sold Manhattan Island for, among other things, glass beads) so the idea of them building a city out of gold seems as likely as that they were found to have at one time to be experimenting with the fission possibilities of North American uranium.Nevertheless, for its entertainment value, if you have a couple hours to kill, this is not a bad movie.

No, not a legendary city of gold, but the riches that come from storming the box office. National Treasure: Book of Secrets is everything a big budget adventure sequel should be. A bigger story and better action help make Book of Secrets a surprising end of the year crowd pleaser.Setting out to clear his ancestor's name, Ben Gates is back in treasure-hunting action to unequivocally prove that his family had nothing to do with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. With his usual cohorts Riley, Abigail and his father, Patrick Gates, the trio must race against the clock to stop a new enemy, Mitch Wilkinson, from uncovering an ancient treasure before they can, or forever risk the Gates name being associated with the death of one of America's greatest presidents.A hit for Nicholas Cage has been long overdue. Spanning nearly two full years making dud after dud, Cage is back and in good form, even if a sequel to the massively successful National Treasure was a safe no-brainer. Book of Secrets is just as outlandishly fun as its predecessor, one-upping the original by having the principle characters break into Buckingham Palace and even kidnap the President of the United States!Kudos have to be handed over to screenwriters Cormac and Marianne Wibberley for crafting such a big adventure, yet staying true to the themes that director John Turtletaub and company established with the first National Treasure. Even though their new adventure takes the entourage of talented character actor's across the globe, Book of Secrets manages to keep this treasure hunt a uniquely American tale. Just wait until you see where our government hid one of the most famed and sought after treasures of all time!Upping the production value from the last film, Book of Secrets is crammed packed with puzzles, car chases and exciting action sequences to help keep the film filled with riveting adventure from opening to closing frame. John Turtletaub has again done a great job of keeping the manic pace of the film frantic and fun, even if there are a few solitary moments when the picture starts to feel the weight of its lengthy running time.While the returning cast again does a stellar job continuing their characters, newcomers to the series Ed Harris and Hellen Mirren are welcomed additions to the story. While Harris is perfectly suited for the role, his character, Mitch Wilkinson, seems to be the only weak link to the story. Wilkinson seems like a very torn individual. One minute the dastardly villain is opening fire on our heroes, vowing to end their lives to get at the treasure, and the next he is helping them!Luckily the picture's best moments don't hinge on confrontations between Cage and Harris. The real fun of National Treasure has always been watching as the characters solve some of history's most challenging puzzles. Book of Secrets is assuredly no different, keeping audiences on their toes and tantalizing them with conspiracy theories that will likely continue the franchise forward.Between massive Pirate's plunder and uncovering buried National Treasure, 2007 aims to be a financially lucrative year for Disney's live action department. With surprises at every turn, Book of Secrets has established National Treasure as a viable and fun adventure franchise, making the film a must see holiday blockbuster that the whole family can enjoy.-Joe Russo",4,National Treasure Book of Secrets Movie Review,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3503,"['Disney', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'have', 'dived', 'yet', 'again', 'secret', 'book', 'pull', 'out', 'map', 'treasures', 'vast', 'fortune', 'No', 'not', 'legendary', 'city', 'gold', 'riches', 'come', 'storming', 'box', 'office', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'everything', 'big', 'budget', 'adventure', 'sequel', 'should', 'be', 'A', 'bigger', 'story', 'better', 'action', 'help', 'make', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'surprising', 'end', 'year', 'crowd', 'pleaser.Setting', 'out', 'clear', 'ancestor', 'name', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'back', 'treasure-hunting', 'action', 'unequivocally', 'prove', 'family', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'usual', 'cohorts', 'Riley', 'Abigail', 'father', 'Patrick', 'Gates', 'trio', 'must', 'race', 'clock', 'stop', 'new', 'enemy', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'uncovering', 'ancient', 'treasure', 'can', 'forever', 'risk', 'Gates', 'name', 'being', 'associated', 'death', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'presidents.A', 'hit', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'Spanning', 'nearly', 'two', 'full', 'years', 'making', 'dud', 'dud', 'Cage', 'back', 'good', 'form', 'even', 'sequel', 'massively', 'successful', 'National', 'Treasure', 'was', 'safe', 'no-brainer', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'just', 'outlandishly', 'fun', 'predecessor', 'one-upping', 'original', 'having', 'principle', 'characters', 'break', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'even', 'kidnap', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Kudos', 'have', 'be', 'handed', 'screenwriters', 'Cormac', 'Marianne', 'Wibberley', 'crafting', 'big', 'adventure', 'yet', 'staying', 'true', 'themes', 'director', 'John', 'Turtletaub', 'company', 'established', 'first', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Even', 'new', 'adventure', 'entourage', 'talented', 'character', 'actor', 'globe', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'keep', 'treasure', 'uniquely', 'American', 'tale', 'Just', 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'government', 'hid', 'one', 'most', 'famed', 'sought', 'treasures', 'time', 'Upping', 'production', 'value', 'last', 'film', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'crammed', 'packed', 'puzzles', 'car', 'chases', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'help', 'keep', 'film', 'filled', 'riveting', 'adventure', 'opening', 'closing', 'frame', 'John', 'Turtletaub', 'again', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'manic', 'pace', 'film', 'frantic', 'fun', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'solitary', 'moments', 'when', 'picture', 'feel', 'weight', 'lengthy', 'running', 'returning', 'cast', 'again', 'stellar', 'job', 'continuing', 'characters', 'newcomers', 'series', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Hellen', 'Mirren', 'are', 'welcomed', 'additions', 'story', 'Harris', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'character', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'be', 'only', 'weak', 'link', 'story', 'Wilkinson', 'very', 'torn', 'individual', 'One', 'minute', 'dastardly', 'villain', 'opening', 'fire', 'heroes', 'vowing', 'end', 'lives', 'get', 'treasure', 'next', 'helping', 'Luckily', 'picture', 'best', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'hinge', 'confrontations', 'Cage', 'Harris', 'real', 'fun', 'National', 'Treasure', 'always', 'been', 'watching', 'characters', 'solve', 'history', 'most', 'challenging', 'puzzles', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'assuredly', 'different', 'keeping', 'audiences', 'toes', 'tantalizing', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'will', 'likely', 'continue', 'franchise', 'forward.Between', 'massive', 'Pirate', 'plunder', 'uncovering', 'buried', 'National', 'Treasure', '2007', 'aims', 'be', 'financially', 'lucrative', 'year', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'department', 'surprises', 'turn', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'established', 'National', 'Treasure', 'viable', 'fun', 'adventure', 'franchise', 'making', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'holiday', 'blockbuster', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy.-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A
1117896,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B000YABYPQ,The JuRK,"[0, 0]","One of the smartest things I've ever heard Roger Ebert say was, ""Never take a film more serious than it takes itself.""That saying came to mind after watching NATIONAL TREASURE 2: BOOK OF SECRETS.  It would be doomed otherwise.The only other big Hollywood spectacle I'd seen recently was the horrific TRANSFORMERS, a loud, lame movie that celebrates the worst of modern movies.  Every single scene in that movie was a direct rip-off of every other movie ever made.  But that might have been overlooked if there was a single human character worth caring about.NATIONAL TREASURE 2 isn't breaking any new ground, that's for sure (most of it plays like a hybrid of the Indiana Jones films and the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films) but the cast manages to make the characters likable and watchable.  For the most part, Nicolas Cage stoically shows up for his paycheck but Jon Voight and Helen Mirren bring some humor and humanity to the mayhem.No one seems to take too much seriously, especially the often silly script (a deadpan Cage breaks into both Buckingham Palace AND the White House?), so it's hard to be critical.

Anyone going to see this should not be expecting something remarkable anyway. This is one of those films that is pure brainless entertainment (so brainless the filmmakers put the subtitle ""J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building"" on the shot of the very sign outside the FBI building).Normally I would be fuming by now about such talent (three...yes THREE Oscar winners) is wasted on horrible scripting, directing, and editing, but I sat there staring dumbfounded at everything the filmmakers threw at the screen one after another...whether it was Benjamin Gates waltzing into Buckingham Palace and then waltzing right out with a two hundred-year-old clue within a matter of minutes; or the slipping past the army of secret service agents, to kidnap the president of the United States at his own birthday (is there no more respect!).This second installment moves at a rapid pace with editing that sometimes reminded me of a TV episode. Not as much time is spent on how the characters acquire the information or clues but more spent on action and the gang trotting the globe (one scene they are in Buckingham palace, the next the are standing at the Eiffel Tower, and before you know it ready to hike Mount Rushmore!). This time they are out to find ""The greatest treasure of all time!"" (this makes me wonder how they are going to top it in their possible third installment). The great treasure turns out to be the legendary ""city of gold"" that Cortez and many other explorers have searched for. By finding this treasure it will help clear their ancestor's name, which has been linked to the Lincoln assassination. It follows the same type of format with clue after clue, relentless chases by a villain (this time played by Ed Harris) and his henchmen. One thing that helped make it a little more watchable was the new character Emily (played by Helen Mirren) who is the mother of Benjamin Gates.This is one of those popcorn flicks--something you will not have to concentrate to keep up with and can forget about after you leave the theater. Knowing the characters already, greatly aids this film because there is zero development of them.

The film is entertaining, but it looks no longer fresh like ""National Treasure,"" implausible but still interesting mixture of slick actions and the history of America. The globe-trotting story of the sequel includes several incredible episodes like sneaking into Buckingham Place and ""kidnapping"" of President of the United States, but after all the sequel's plot is basically only repeating the original's.Most of the original film's cast return - Nicholas Cage, John Voight, Diane Kruger, Harvey Keitel and Justin Bartha. Plus Bruce Greenwood, Ed Harris and Helen Mirren join the cast for ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets."" With this great cast no one is likely to fail. Director Jon Turteltaub surely delivered the goods, but considering these names and the money that must be spent on producing the costly set, the goods are not enough and the romance part of the story just doesn't work with the flat characters.This is a fairly enjoyable two-hour adventure film, less original and engrossing than the predecessor to be sure, but it is fun nonetheless.

In an attempt to prove his great-grandfather's innocence, Ben, Abigail (Diane Kruger), and Riley (Justin Bartha) begain a globetrotting adventure that takes them from Buckingham Palace to the Oval Office in the White House.  Their journey ultimately leads Ben to ""kidnapping"" the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood) and a perilous journey inside Mount Rushmore.NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS is a fairly average action-adventure movie.  Like the original movie, BOOK OF SECRETS boasts a decent mixture of actual history with tons of conspiracy theories to bolster an otherwise lackluster plot.  However, there really isn't as much action as there was in the first movie.  Things have been watered down, including the ""villain"", Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris).  Harris' talents (as well as those of Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, and Helen Mirren) are completely wasted in the movie, but so is his character.  Wilkinson is intended to be an evil foil to Benjamin Gates, but instead by the end of the movie comes off as being a completely sympathetic person that was just trying to clear his family's name just like Ben is doing.The strongest thing about the movie is the characters.  It is true that Benjamin Gates and Riley Poole and the rest of the cast are basically cardboard figures.  However, they are cardboard characters that the audience actually cares about, even without ever having seen NATIONAL TREASURE.  Abigail is beautiful and throughout the movie the audience roots that the adventure will bring her and Ben back together; Riley Poole is adorable and the audience keeps hoping he will end up with a fraction of the success that Ben has; etc.Overall, though NATIONAL TREASURE: BOOK OF SECRETS isn't a great action-adventure movie and at times struggles to build excitement, it is a decent yarn involving some lovable characters.",3,"Still Fun, But Not as Exciting",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2287,"['delivering', 'presentation', 'great-grandfather', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'relationship', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'attempt', 'stop', 'assassination', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'challenged', 'man', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'have', 'missing', 'page', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'diary', 'Thomas', 'Gates', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'ring-leaders', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'prove', 'great-grandfather', 'innocence', 'Ben', 'Abigail', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'begain', 'globetrotting', 'adventure', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'Oval', 'Office', 'White', 'House', 'journey', 'ultimately', 'Ben', 'kidnapping', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'perilous', 'journey', 'Mount', 'Rushmore.NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'SECRETS', 'fairly', 'average', 'action-adventure', 'movie', 'original', 'movie', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'SECRETS', 'decent', 'mixture', 'actual', 'history', 'tons', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'bolster', 'otherwise', 'lackluster', 'plot', 'However', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'action', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Things', 'have', 'been', 'watered', 'down', 'including', 'villain', 'Mitch', 'Wilkinson', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Harris', 'talents', 'as', 'well', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'are', 'completely', 'wasted', 'movie', 'so', 'character', 'Wilkinson', 'intended', 'be', 'evil', 'foil', 'Benjamin', 'Gates', 'instead', 'end', 'movie', 'off', 'being', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'person', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'clear', 'family', 'name', 'just', 'Ben', 'doing.The', 'strongest', 'thing', 'movie', 'characters', 'true', 'Benjamin', 'Gates', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'basically', 'cardboard', 'figures', 'However', 'are', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'audience', 'actually', 'even', 'ever', 'having', 'seen', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'Abigail', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'audience', 'roots', 'adventure', 'will', 'bring', 'Ben', 'back', 'together', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'adorable', 'audience', 'hoping', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'fraction', 'success', 'Ben', 'etc.Overall', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'SECRETS', ""n't"", 'great', 'action-adventure', 'movie', 'times', 'struggles', 'build', 'excitement', 'decent', 'yarn', 'involving', 'lovable', 'characters']",N/A

Our Hero finds the fabulous and unlikely treasure in the end, as expected, and the bad guy turns out not to be so bad after all.Motivations are a bit ethereal: both sides seek one of the greatest troves in history as a matter of family pride.

Gates wants more though; he wants the archaeological knowledge to be brought to light for the good of all mankind, possibly including the answer to why Olmec inscriptions had anything to do with a trove in South Dakota. Those annoying heaps of gold really have nothing to do with either party's interest - ahem.
