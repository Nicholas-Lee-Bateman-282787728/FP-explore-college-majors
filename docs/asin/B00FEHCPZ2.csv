1671161,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00FEHCPZ2,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","Let me be the first to say it. Okay maybe not the first but among the folks who want it to be known. Steven Seagal, that wonder of movie martial arts flicks needs to stop what he's doing, stop thinking he knows what's best and start listening to directors and writers who make movies. Once he does that perhaps he'll stop starring in direct to video crap like this and make good movies once again.Seagal plays a crime lord here, a man who used to work for some unnamed government agency that did bad things (routine for Seagal movies these days) who turned those skills into a way to make money. His prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roman (Bren Foster) is sent on a mission to kill an inmate at the local prison. Signaled wrongly on purpose by Ice Man (Ving Rhames) for some reason, he must pay the price for a job gone wrong. Seagal allows the employer time with Roman alone during which he breaks both of his hands.Months pass and now Roman is a drunk on the streets whose hands have healed improperly. He's now living in a room above a restaurant owned by Seagal's daughter Karen. There he makes friends of a sort with her cook Jimmy Peanuts (Danny Trejo). As the film progresses we learn that Jimmy is there not to just cook but protect Karen as well.Problems arise when Ice Man is released from prison and decided to take over the empire created by Seagal and his partners. Wiping out the partners one by one, he sets his sites on the whole ball of wax. Each step brings him closer and closer to Seagal and an eventual showdown is bound to happen. So how does Roman come into this? Seagal has been footing the bill for him ever since his hands were broken. The damaged hands have prevented him from using his martial arts skills to kill people but the skills are still there, especially in his legwork which we see when some goons try to hold up Jimmy. Just how Seagal helps Roman with his hands is beyond belief and more along the lines of you gotta be kidding me than wow that's amazing. Let's just hope no one with damaged hands follows the instructions used here.The movie plays at the slowest pace possible and the acting leaves much to be desired. Production values are solid here but that's about it. I've read that Seagal has a penchant for telling writers and directors that he knows best what words to say and how to say them. If that were the case he'd be making better movies. I'm sorry but it's the truth and someone needs to tell him. Rhames and Trejo have both done better and deserve to be in a better film than this one. If they continue down this path they'll be making only direct to DVD films as well.The only standout here is Bren Foster who has the opportunity to break out of these sorts of films and become a star. He's got the good looks necessary to be a star and his ability in martial arts seems top notch. He just needs to find the right vehicle to display those abilities and this isn't it. Good luck to him in the future. And good luck to Seagal if he continues to make movies like this.",2,"SEAGAL, PLEASE STOP",1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,3012,"['Let', 'be', 'first', 'say', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'first', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'known', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'wonder', 'movie', 'martial', 'arts', 'flicks', 'needs', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'stop', 'thinking', 'what', 'best', 'start', 'listening', 'directors', 'writers', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'Once', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'starring', 'direct', 'video', 'crap', 'make', 'good', 'movies', 'once', 'again.Seagal', 'plays', 'crime', 'lord', 'here', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'unnamed', 'government', 'agency', 'did', 'bad', 'things', 'routine', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'days', 'who', 'turned', 'skills', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Roman', 'Bren', 'Foster', 'sent', 'mission', 'kill', 'inmate', 'local', 'prison', 'Signaled', 'wrongly', 'purpose', 'Ice', 'Man', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'reason', 'must', 'pay', 'price', 'job', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Seagal', 'employer', 'time', 'Roman', 'alone', 'hands.Months', 'pass', 'now', 'Roman', 'drunk', 'streets', 'hands', 'have', 'healed', 'improperly', 'now', 'living', 'room', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'Seagal', 'daughter', 'Karen', 'friends', 'sort', 'cook', 'Jimmy', 'Peanuts', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'film', 'learn', 'Jimmy', 'there', 'not', 'just', 'cook', 'protect', 'Karen', 'well.Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'Ice', 'Man', 'released', 'prison', 'decided', 'take', 'over', 'empire', 'created', 'Seagal', 'partners', 'Wiping', 'out', 'partners', 'one', 'one', 'sites', 'whole', 'ball', 'wax', 'step', 'closer', 'closer', 'Seagal', 'eventual', 'showdown', 'bound', 'happen', 'So', 'how', 'Roman', 'come', 'Seagal', 'been', 'footing', 'bill', 'ever', 'hands', 'were', 'broken', 'damaged', 'hands', 'have', 'prevented', 'using', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'kill', 'people', 'skills', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'especially', 'legwork', 'see', 'when', 'goons', 'try', 'hold', 'up', 'Jimmy', 'Just', 'how', 'Seagal', 'Roman', 'hands', 'belief', 'more', 'lines', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'kidding', 'wow', 'amazing', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'one', 'damaged', 'hands', 'instructions', 'used', 'here.The', 'movie', 'plays', 'slowest', 'pace', 'possible', 'acting', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'solid', 'here', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Seagal', 'penchant', 'telling', 'writers', 'directors', 'best', 'what', 'words', 'say', 'how', 'say', 'were', 'case', ""'d"", 'be', 'making', 'better', 'movies', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'truth', 'someone', 'needs', 'tell', 'Rhames', 'Trejo', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'deserve', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'continue', 'down', 'path', ""'ll"", 'be', 'making', 'only', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'well.The', 'only', 'standout', 'here', 'Bren', 'Foster', 'who', 'opportunity', 'break', 'sorts', 'films', 'become', 'star', 'got', 'good', 'looks', 'necessary', 'be', 'star', 'ability', 'martial', 'arts', 'top', 'notch', 'just', 'find', 'right', 'vehicle', 'display', 'abilities', ""n't"", 'Good', 'luck', 'future', 'good', 'luck', 'Seagal', 'make', 'movies']",Force Of Execution

1671164,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00FEHCPZ2,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[15, 16]","After a relatively high publicity run, things are sort of looking down for Steven Seagal: not only is he receiving criticism for his partnerships with Joe Arpaio and Vladimir Putin, but his UFC prot&eacute;g&eacute; Anderson Silva seems to be publicly distancing himself from the Buddhist Bonecrusher. Seagal's in need of a good movie like few times before, and luckily he's gotten one in ""Force of Execution."" I'm genuinely surprised by how much I like this film, which may very well be the most action-packed flick Seagal has done in quite some time. It's not nearly perfect and it isn't even really a vehicle for the man, but I predict that a lot of fans and action devotees in general will like this one.The story: an emerging crime lord (Ving Rhames,The Tournament) prepares for a bloody street war with the established kingpin (Seagal). In the middle of this, a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the latter (Bren Foster) - maimed and cast out for a past failure - must decide whether he will play a part in the violence to come.Seagal seems really into his role: he tries for an accent again, but more notably has the tone and personality of the antihero down pat, as though he prepared for the part with a Coppola marathon. He's matched in presence by Ving Rhames, who can do these tough guy roles in his sleep but doesn't phone in his performance at all. Danny Trejo (Dead in Tombstone) is here as well, playing the grizzled owner of a diner, but the real star of the movie is in fact Bren Foster. Graduating from his supporting part inMaximum Conviction, Foster soundly steals the show out from under his better-known costars and makes the movie his own by being not only an impressive martial artist but also a surprisingly adept actor, turning his portions of the plot into generally the most interesting ones.Director Keoni Waxman seems to be the preferred filmmaker of Seagal these days, much to my chagrin since I'm not a huge fan of any of the work they've done together, but he redeems himself by not only directing a better-made movie in this, but also a more interesting one. There are some of those annoying DTV slights that we've had to get used to - Seagal's dialogue being dubbed here and there, scenes between characters wherein the actors were clearly never in the same room, etc. - but they appear to a lesser extent than expected. The writing is also better than one might expect, with more character development scenes than are the norm for low budget action fare, and occasional weird/cool moments (SPOILER) like when Trejo reveals himself to be a ""Mexican witch doctor"" and cures Bren Foster's injured hands with live scorpion venom.One of the major complaints among viewers of Seagal's movies of the last ten years is their relatively meager martial arts contents, and ""Force of Execution"" addresses this qualm with no less than 10 hand-to-hand brawls - 13 if you include the short ones. Thanks to Foster, these may also be the most legitimately athletic fights we've seen in Steven's movies since early in his career. Seagal is more than serviceable for his four tussles, relying less on doubles than in his worst films, and even Ving Rhames mixes things up in a single brawl, but it's Bren's work as both an acrobat and a down-to-earth martial artist who elevates the entire picture. Think Scott Adkins without the gratuitous flipping. The scenes wherein he takes out a hallway full of prison guards and duels escrima guru Ron Balicki (The Prodigy) with knives are standouts, and should make Seagal consider handing the reins to other martial artists more often in his movies.Speaking of Steven, I have the feeling that he's finally winding down. I may be reading too much into this, but his character alludes more than once to ""retiring"" and references his age in a negative context as well. In playing the part, he really gives the impression that he feels he ought to be done with this kind of stuff. Seagal still has a role in at least one more movie coming out, but should this indeed be the time that he hangs up his gloves as a leading man, he chose a pretty satisfying movie to mark the occasion.

1671172,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00FEHCPZ2,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[6, 6]","Mr. Alexander (Steven Seagal) is an ex-government agent who learned ""things"" in the mountains of Thailand. He is now the crime boss over the city of Albuquerque. Iceman (Ving Rhames) has recently got out of prison and is challenging Alexander, who simply wants to be bought out honorably. In what passes for a Seagal subplot, Roman Hurst (Bren Foster)who works for Alexander, gets double crossed by Iceman and is forced to retire, losing the use of his hands- somewhat, but he can still slow motion kickbox. He now lives in a room off a diner owned by Alexander and run by Jimmy Peanuts (Danny Trejo). The waitress (Jenny Gabrielle) becomes a focal point, because that is where the crime boss likes his girlfriend to work.The plot, like Seagal is straight forward. Trejo supplies us with a surprise, but the plot is not twisty. The tough guy dialog is cliche, using lines like, ""You broke the code."" Seagal is a bad guy who kills people, but commands with over doses of corny respect speeches. At one point Seagal sits down and describes his gun collection, giving us the advantage points of each piece, topping it off with ""Isn't that amazing.""I found this to be a better quality Seagal film, as he is not in every scene and shares with Rhames and Trejo.4 stars on the Seagal scale. 2 stars for non-fans.Parental Guide: F-bomb, n-word, torture.

It is obvious that he is getting older like most of us but I still enjoy his older movies, which I tend to watch more than once or twice, or a newer movie I have not seen before.  They are not the kind of movies that get Academy Awards but they are great movies that you watch just the action and many times bad acting that you find in them.  As usual, Steven usually wins in the end even when he plays a bad guy as he did in this movie.  But in the end he shows that he still has a good heart as he walks away the winner.

Why in the heck can't he just use his normal voice nowadays, instead of mumbling stuff nobody can understand?  Listen to him in the special feature included on the disc - sounds like a regular dude talking.  Listen to him in the movie - does he think mumbling makes him seem more menacing or something?  I don't know.  Anyway, the movie is great if you're a Bren Foster fan, as he has lots of screen time and does lots of his usually great martial arts.  The remainder of the film is just so-so, and downright stupid in some places, such as when Seagal has his henchman beaten to a pulp for screwing up a hit and then later gives him a bunch of money because he's &#34;family.&#34;  I can't remember the last time I had a family member beaten up for something, but then I'm over 50 and might not understand this new era.
