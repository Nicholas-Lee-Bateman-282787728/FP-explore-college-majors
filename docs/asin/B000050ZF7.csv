Daniel Patten, III""","[5, 5]","I only got to see the old Black &amp; White episodes once when I was growing up--so it's a real treat to see them after such a long time. I didn't enjoy &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot; as much as I thought I would, however. You could tell that it was thrown together rather quickly, (due to the sets for Marco Polo not being ready some have said), and while there are good moments, the sound was not very good and Hartnell (who is my favorite Doctor BTW) did flub his lines alot. I skipped over the original unaired pilot as i have already seen it before on &quot;The Hartnell Years&quot; and I was also eager to see the &quot;Missing Years&quot; tape--and boy did I enjoy that. The clips were absolutly wonderful and it almost makes you cry to think that many of these episodes will never be found. It was almost like watching new episodes because we have never seen most of these clips before, and made this collection well worth the price. Episode 3 of &quot;The Underwater Menace&quot; was absolutly delicious and had some very funny scenes. This is definatly a must have for the serious Dr. Who fan.

I can't say it was worth the wait, but I am pleased with the contents on them. The remastering of both &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot; and the original &quot;pilot episode&quot; look beautiful, magnificently cleaned up by the Restoration Team. Although, don't look at the story too much, as it was originally conceived to fill time between &quot;The Daleks&quot; and &quot;Marco Polo&quot;(the sets weren't ready!). &quot;Edge&quot; itself is incredibly bizarre, but things start ot feel a little normal during &quot;The Brink of Disaster&quot;. The original pilot is also very enjoyable. Love Susan's little jig in classroom. But the Highlight of the release, at least for North Amercian viewers, is &quot;The Missing Years&quot;. A 30 minute special made by the Restoration Team about various Doctor Who episodes that might be missing forever. Also included, are various extracts and clips from  missing episodes. Well researched, well made, these people know what they're talking about, very informative. And let's not forget the bonus episode: Episode 3 of &quot;The Underwater Menace&quot;! It has to be seen to be believed! Absolutely wonderful! The Doctor in disguise is NOT to be missed.

563234,A2N029FTHX6BTS,B000050ZF7,Michael Hickerson,"[7, 7]","After what seems like one of the longer waits in history for a Who video, the superlative Missing Years tapes finally makes the jump across the pond to American shores.  And the clips featured on this tape are worth the price along and are really what elevate this reviewer to give this double tape set so many stars.  The clips are nicely done and will leave Who fans yearning for more missing episodes to see the light of day--especially anything from Evil of the Daleks or Fury from the Deep.  (The clip from Fury is frightfully unnerving and shows off how could this story could be if all of it was available).  Yes, the presentation by Deborah Watling and Frasier Hines is a bit over the top at times--but it's worth it for the clips.  Also included is the first complete Troughton episode--part three of &quot;The Underwater Menance.&quot;  It's campy at best and features one of the more infamous cliffhangers in all of Who.  But the featured peformance by the second Doctor makes it worth seeing.As for the Edge of Destruction, it's a quiet Hartnell two-parter. It's really more about the character development of the original TARDIS quartet than anything.  An interesting story as it's the only story to take place completely inside the TARDIS.  Added on is the umpteenth re-release of the original pilot. If you've got the Hartnell Years tape, you've already got it.  it's just been remasted--which I'm not sure helps it that much.All in all, buy this set for the great clips on the Missing Years. And slip the Edge of Destruction in on a rainy afternoon as a good way to spend an hour.",4,Missing Years clips are worth it!,990489600,"05 22, 2001",2001,1596,"['what', 'one', 'longer', 'waits', 'history', 'Who', 'video', 'superlative', 'Missing', 'Years', 'finally', 'jump', 'pond', 'American', 'shores', 'clips', 'featured', 'tape', 'are', 'price', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'elevate', 'reviewer', 'give', 'double', 'tape', 'set', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'clips', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'will', 'leave', 'Who', 'fans', 'yearning', 'more', 'missing', 'episodes', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'especially', 'anything', 'Evil', 'Daleks', 'Fury', 'Deep', 'clip', 'Fury', 'frightfully', 'unnerving', 'off', 'how', 'could', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'available', 'Yes', 'presentation', 'Deborah', 'Watling', 'Frasier', 'Hines', 'bit', 'top', 'times', 'clips', 'Also', 'included', 'first', 'complete', 'Troughton', 'episode', 'part', 'three', 'quot', 'Underwater', 'Menance.', 'quot', 'campy', 'best', 'one', 'more', 'infamous', 'cliffhangers', 'Who', 'featured', 'peformance', 'second', 'Doctor', 'worth', 'seeing.As', 'Edge', 'Destruction', 'quiet', 'Hartnell', 'two-parter', 'really', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'original', 'TARDIS', 'quartet', 'anything', 'interesting', 'story', 'only', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'completely', 'TARDIS', 'Added', 'umpteenth', 're-release', 'original', 'pilot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Hartnell', 'Years', 'tape', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'just', 'been', 'remasted', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'buy', 'set', 'great', 'clips', 'Missing', 'Years', 'slip', 'Edge', 'Destruction', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'hour']",N/A

For some reason (incompetence, most probably) they placed, not the original pilot episode, but the actual first episode of an Unearthly Child as it originally aired.  The tapes have been pulled from retailers and are being replaced with the proper episode.  How long this will take, no one knows.  Another big disappointment for North American Who fans.

In a way, it's almost Hitchcockian in its execution.  For this adventure takes place within the confines of the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS.  Some sort of intense shockwave has knocked the crew unconscious, and something seems to be wrong with all of the systems within the ship.  Not only that, but paranoia, moments of insanity, as well as suspicions and accusations run rampant among the four companions, as no one is sure who to trust, for rational thinking and understanding are thrown out the window, at least, until the climax of the final episode, as the Doctor finally realizes what has happened.  This adventure was really cool, and very intense, as the Doctor faced off with both Barbara and Ian, in an intense scenes of wild accusations and mistrust.  But ultimately, it was this adventure that marked a turning point for William Hartnell's Doctor, for it was here that the Doctor showed signs of being less harsh, and more likeable, especially towards Ian and Barbara.",4,Inside The Spaceship,1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,1078,"['particular', 'adventure', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'intense', 'atmospheric', 'way', 'almost', 'Hitchcockian', 'execution', 'adventure', 'place', 'confines', 'Doctor', 'ship', 'TARDIS', 'sort', 'intense', 'shockwave', 'knocked', 'crew', 'unconscious', 'something', 'be', 'wrong', 'systems', 'ship', 'Not', 'only', 'paranoia', 'moments', 'insanity', 'as', 'well', 'suspicions', 'accusations', 'run', 'rampant', 'four', 'companions', 'one', 'sure', 'who', 'trust', 'rational', 'thinking', 'understanding', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'least', 'climax', 'final', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'finally', 'what', 'happened', 'adventure', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'very', 'intense', 'Doctor', 'faced', 'off', 'Barbara', 'Ian', 'intense', 'scenes', 'wild', 'accusations', 'mistrust', 'ultimately', 'was', 'adventure', 'marked', 'turning', 'point', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Doctor', 'was', 'here', 'Doctor', 'showed', 'signs', 'being', 'less', 'harsh', 'more', 'likeable', 'especially', 'towards', 'Ian', 'Barbara']",N/A
