Girl tells boy not to give up his train for the domineering fat boy. The oppressed alien is released from it's subterranean dwelling, builds it's rocket ship on the town's tallest structure and launches off -after the boy tells the alien it can live and be free. The town is destroyed in the process and the ultimate symbol of society's repressive, overwhelming force (the military) is overcome.

1399286,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B004EPYZPS,Adam,"[1, 4]","I've been a fan of J.J. Abrams since Lost, Cloverfield, and the reboot of Star Trek.  Paired with Steven Spielberg, I was expecting something great, especially when critics were praising this film so highly.  Many people will say it's a cross between The Goonies, ET, and several other childhood films, which I will agree is *mostly* correct.  However, I found that it seems to lose it's tone about halfway through and the overall theme of childhood innocence gets lost.I will say the acting is fantastic.  With children as lead actors, their roles are cast perfectly.  A little cliched, perhaps, but the band of friends fits well.  Kyle Chandler as the sheriff/father fits his role quite nicely as well.  The premise builds a nice story of a strained father-son relationship after the death of the mother, as well as takes us through the bonds of friendship and the childhood fun of making a home movie.  On a cinematic standpoint, the camerawork and score work well with the film.  Abrams has always gone over the top to drop the audience into a colorfully distinctive world full of emotion and life, and this film is no different.What I didn't enjoy were certain elements to the alien/monster itself, which caused the story to stray from being about childhood innocence amidst a supernatural crisis to being about children stuck in a violent battle between humans and the alien.  Ignoring the cliched components of a secret military train getting derailed, I had expected this film to veer toward being about an ET-like creature, where ET was misunderstood by scientists but was a caring creature deep down that only a child could understand.  This alien, however, doesn't seem to value human life and showed no restraint in lashing out with unsympathetic violence (aside from a random scientist it decided to bond with early in the film).  Some may argue that this is a more realistic or simply different portrayal, which is better since Abrams most likely didn't want to remake ET.  However, I felt that it took away from the warmness that the film could have offered and made it more gritty as it got to the end.  Aside from that, I'm not a fan of movies where suspending disbelief is overly necessary, but this film absolutely requires it.  From the overly dramatic train wreck scene to the battle where kids are running around unchallenged by the plethora of soldiers, I found myself sighing with disappointment.  That and, despite being called ""Super 8"", the kids' film really doesn't play as big of a role as I would have thought.  In fact, in the last third, it is virtually nonexistent.It was a nice attempt to create a unique film and I will not deny that the basic premise, acting, and camerawork are fantastic.  However, I just didn't feel the *magic* that many critics said this film had.",3,"Didn't have the ""magic"" I expected",1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2804,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Lost', 'Cloverfield', 'reboot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Paired', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'great', 'especially', 'when', 'critics', 'were', 'praising', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'cross', 'Goonies', 'ET', 'several', 'other', 'childhood', 'films', 'will', 'agree', '*mostly*', 'correct', 'However', 'found', 'lose', 'tone', 'halfway', 'overall', 'theme', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'lost.I', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'children', 'lead', 'actors', 'roles', 'are', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'little', 'cliched', 'perhaps', 'band', 'friends', 'fits', 'well', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'sheriff/father', 'role', 'quite', 'nicely', 'as', 'well', 'premise', 'nice', 'story', 'strained', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'death', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'childhood', 'fun', 'making', 'home', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'camerawork', 'score', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'Abrams', 'always', 'gone', 'top', 'drop', 'audience', 'colorfully', 'distinctive', 'world', 'full', 'emotion', 'life', 'film', 'different.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'were', 'certain', 'elements', 'alien/monster', 'caused', 'story', 'stray', 'being', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'amidst', 'supernatural', 'crisis', 'being', 'children', 'stuck', 'violent', 'battle', 'humans', 'alien', 'Ignoring', 'cliched', 'components', 'secret', 'military', 'train', 'getting', 'derailed', 'had', 'expected', 'film', 'veer', 'being', 'ET-like', 'creature', 'where', 'ET', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'scientists', 'was', 'caring', 'creature', 'deep', 'down', 'only', 'child', 'could', 'understand', 'alien', 'however', ""n't"", 'seem', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'showed', 'restraint', 'lashing', 'out', 'unsympathetic', 'violence', 'aside', 'random', 'scientist', 'decided', 'bond', 'early', 'film', 'may', 'argue', 'more', 'realistic', 'simply', 'different', 'portrayal', 'better', 'Abrams', 'most', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'remake', 'ET', 'However', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'warmness', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'made', 'more', 'gritty', 'got', 'end', 'Aside', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'movies', 'where', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'overly', 'necessary', 'film', 'absolutely', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'train', 'wreck', 'scene', 'battle', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'unchallenged', 'plethora', 'soldiers', 'found', 'sighing', 'disappointment', 'being', 'called', 'Super', '8', 'kids', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'play', 'as', 'big', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'fact', 'last', 'third', 'virtually', 'nonexistent.It', 'was', 'nice', 'attempt', 'create', 'unique', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'deny', 'basic', 'premise', 'acting', 'camerawork', 'are', 'fantastic', 'However', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', '*magic*', 'many', 'critics', 'said', 'film', 'had']",N/A

1399292,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPYZPS,A kids review,"[1, 1]","J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film.

1399296,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B004EPYZPS,Allan M. Lees,"[16, 30]","I have to begin by confessing that Spielberg movies, with the exception of Empire of the Sun, have always bored me. If ever a director typified the standard lazy Hollywood churn-out-the-schlock mentality it's Spielberg. This movie - which I was asked to watch by a friend who likes sci-fi - actually hits a low spot because pretty much every aspect is flat. The camera work is tiresome and unimaginative, the script could have been written by a write-a-cliche computer program, the acting is one-dimensional, there is no plot, and the special effects are frankly unintentionally funny but always boring and telegraphed hours in advance. Likewise the soundtrack is... well, let's just say, this movie definitely would be better with the volume set to zero.In addition to being a tiresome hack job in which everyone dials in their contribution from long-distance, it's a sci-fi movie with no science and no fiction. There's basically not much of a plot (""hey, what if there's this weird stranded alien and like, the military capture it and torture it, and, like, you know, it escapes and starts killing people..."") and the fact the ""monster"" is  putatively an alien is irrelevant - it could just as easily be a giant poltergeist or a land-capable shark.As always, Spielberg throws in tons of faux sentimentality (young teens rediscovering the importance of fathers... sigh....) and close-up shots than serve only to reveal that no one in this flaccid production can act.But all is not lost. If you are one of the many people out there who have difficulty falling asleep at the end of a stressful day, this is definitely the movie for you.

1399303,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B004EPYZPS,amerdale876,"[11, 15]","Sometimes, you go to see a film and it doesn't leave much of an impression on you. Sometimes it's quite the opposite and you're left to thinking about the film and the story over and over again. ""Super 8"" - wunderkind director J.J. Abrams' third feature film (as a director) - is definitely slotted in the latter category! When I first viewed the movie trailer, I instantly thought of Steven Spielberg (who produced the film) meets Stephen King - in the vein ofStand by Me (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] (published as ""The Body"" inDifferent Seasons (Signet)),ItandHearts In Atlantis(specifically ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""). After seeing the film, my hunch was correct. If you are a fan of Spielberg's early blockbusters likeE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)orClose Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray], or King's previously mentioned books, then this is the film to go see!What amazed me so much about the story were the characters; they are so likeable and relatable that it makes it easy for the viewer to take these people to heart. The kid actors are all effective and talented, however their characters still don't quite reachThe Goonies [Blu-ray] status. Nevertheless, they are realistic and fun - especially the lead, Joe (Joel Courtney), Alice (Elle Fanning), and Charles (Riley Griffiths). Now, let me take a moment here to completely and shamelessly praise actress Elle Fanning. Big sister Dakota Fanning better watch her back because Elle's performance in this is phenomenal! She encapsulates both a boy's first crush as well as that cool, beautiful girl you knew in school, all in one - the kind of girl who talks and you just fall in love with her. Plus, she brings exceptional emotional depth to her character and the film; just watch the scene between Alice and Joe when they are watching film footage of Joe's dead mother - a raw, stirring scene. The heartrending bond that she and Joe have in the film helps the story along to prove that this is more than just some monster flick. As I grow older, I find that my most favorite films are the ones that explore the intricacies of peoples' connectivity and relationships to one another. For all of its special effects and monster hijinks (like inCloverfield [Blu-ray], Abrams borrows from Spielberg'sJaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)in not showing too much of the monster), ""Super 8"" focuses on relationships; and it is not in some hokey way, but in a way that imbues the film with a kind of magic. It's that same magic that you feel when you're a kid and the simplest things in life are what matter most - that magic of innocence, growing up, first love, exploring the world, and standing for what you believe in.Most of Spielberg's movies have ""daddy issues"" where the father of the main character(s) is either dead or has left, and Abrams slightly shifts this theme with having the daddy made a widow (the always-likeable Kyle Chandler) who is estranged from his son Joe and has issues with the town drunk, also Alice's dad (Ron Eldard). Add in Joe's crush on Alice plus his growing friendship with the other boys (especially his friend, Charles), and there's a well-balanced summer blockbuster. This is not one of those ""deep meaning"" movies either; people die ... violently, things blow up (a lot). Considering the other summer releases this year, I believe I'm safe in saying that ""Super 8"" is the summer movie of the year! There is something about this film that makes you want it to last a little longer, but it's good it did not because then it would risk being too overdone. It is not the story that you want to last so much as it is a peek into the journey of these characters' lives.An aspect I really despise as a critic is writing (or telling people) about how good a film is and then those people going in with such high expectations and when I ask them how it was, they say, ""It sucked,"" or, ""It was OK, but I didn't see why you thought it was so great."" I know what I say is going to set the bar high for most audiences out there, and they might not like it. It doesn't matter. No matter what you say as a critic, you stand by your claim; my claim is that this is one of the best movies of the year.

1399306,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004EPYZPS,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I remember when `Super 8' was about to drop.  Everyone that I knew was in a state of frenzy.  It just looked so wonderful.  The nostalgia of seeing a science fiction film in the same vein as those pioneered by Steven Spielberg was almost too good to be true.  Could `Super 8' really be this generation's `E.T.'?  The world was on edge and nearly every Oscar prognosticator was prematurely claiming it a lock in nearly every tech category, and some were even claiming that it was on its way to Best Picture and possibly even Best Director glory.Then it opened to lukewarm critical response, fizzled out and walked away with ZERO Oscar nominations.I was one of those who rushed to predict this everywhere, and I was wholly thrilled to see the film.  It just looked so lovely.  The biggest issue with a film like `Super 8' is that it is rather silly.  The bugs were not worked out wholly.  The script, while rich with contagious dialog (the sparring between the child actors is the finest part of the film) is too unsure of itself to aid the film any.  When we are focused on the alien, the film falls apart; and that is a sad fact considering that the whole draw here was, in all respects, the alien.So here's the basic premise.  In Ohio, way back in 1979, there was a young boy named Joe.  Joe's mother has died and he's obviously distraught about it.  His father love him, but he's preoccupied with work (he's the Sheriff's Deputy) and he's a little too hard edged.  Joe's best friend Charles is obsessed with making movies and convinces the neighborhood kids to make a zombie film with him.  While making the film, a train crashes and a `thing' escapes and havoc is set loose on the small town as dogs and eventually people start disappearing.  The military is all over it, the citizens are in a panic and Joe and his friends start searching for the answers.Visually, the film works to a certain extent.  The special effects can feel a little overdone in parts (the crash itself lasts far too long and screams ""look at me"") and the alien itself is an uninspired disappointment.  That said, the set pieces are beautifully done and the whole feel of the era portrayed is nicely kept in tone.  The atmosphere of the film's first half is flawless.  In fact, leading up to the actual alien business, I was thinking this film was truly brilliant.  Sadly, it takes a nosedive into clich&eacute; ridden sci-fi with little inspiration to keep it afloat.  The child performances are all great; Elle Fanning proving once again that she deserves an Oscar, but the adults are all simple creations that lack depth.  The token villain (the military Col.

I was experiencing first hand the filmmakers (and films) that formed my childhood (Spielberg, Lucas, Zemeckis, Dante, etc.) at the height of their powers. E.T., The Goonies, Back To The Future, Gremlins, Stand By Me, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Monster Squad, et al. Movies were magical. Going to them was an event. Standing in line was exciting. They stayed with you, and are still with you today. Sadly, that's been gone for a long time. Sure, there may be a summer blockbuster that's fun, but it doesn't have 'it'. Most are just empty, soulless CGI-fests that won't still be lauded 25 years from now. J.J. Abrams decided to do something about it. Let's get to it.Set in 1979, we meet Joe, a young boy who just suffered a horrible loss. He lives with his sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) and has a few friends. One night, he and his friends decide to go out and make their own zombie movie. While shooting down by the train tracks, they witness a horrible accident as a truck collides with an oncoming train in a truly spectacular crash. Little do our little friends know that they captured what was in the train's cargo, and mysterious and strange things begin to happen in town. I'll just stop there and let you experience the rest.""Super 8"" is nostalgic and fun just not for the times, but for the type of filmmaking on display here. Spielbergian shots and lens flares, story over spectacle (although there is that), and real humanistic kids you instantly like, care for, and you want to see what happens to them. Back when kids were kids and they talked and acted like kids, just like those great films of the 80s. It was so refrshing to see this instead of the typical modern kids in movies who like so polished and like they just stepped off of the newest low rated CW show. These kids are from 1979, but I find them more relatable and interesting than anything I have seen in the last decade or more. Obviously, there is an homage to producer Spielberg here, and even though there is that, the film is still it's own movie. The fact that it appears to be a love letter to E.T.'s dad is not a deterrent. It's a great, new, original movie from J.J. wrapped in touches to Spielberg and other films from that era. And what touches. I can't say that I am familiar with Abrams' work. I have never seen anything he has ever done before. I will now! He is a director to be reckoned with here. The love and detail he puts into his scenes, characters, and era the film is set in, is so lovingly detailed. It's quite an accomplishment.""Super 8"" harks back to a time when these films meant something to the audience. Meant something to the kids. Nowadays, it's all about cartoonish CGI, 3D, and what young adult novels a studio can get their hands on and everything else comes after. Abrams and company were brave to make an original and secretive film and release it in summer. Brave to actually make it with heart, passion, emotion, and characters that actually came first. The ending and eventual outcome may not of been as great as it could of been, but that's okay. With a movie this lovingly skilled and well done in every other place, and the fact they we just got such a film like this in the first place, made up for it for me. It's not going to take away anything from the movie. The acting is top notch. These kids are great. These are the best set of kids I have seen in a movie in a long time. The actors, most of whom have never been in a movie, just shine. Kyle Chandler also does very well in his role. Ron Eldard is also on hand. More brave points to Abrams for casting the movie with no real marquee name star.""Super 8"" is an exceptional movie that really delivers what I was hoping it would. It's funny, sweet, adventurous, exciting, scary, and interesting. Is it too self indulgent in it's homages of films past? Of course not. A good movie is a good movie however it's told and made. It's a movie that we should embrace and hold dear because it's unlikely we are going to get another movie like this for a long time....if ever. Abrams and his cast and crew should be proud of the film they made. As a child of the 80s, this movie made me feel like a kid again.

The acting was very impressive in this film from all of the mostly unknown child actors with Elle Fanning in her best role to date next to Phoebe In Wonderland and it's amazing to me that this thirteen year old graces the screen effortlessly like she is a verteran actress, it's uncanny. The story of forgiveness and letting go overpowers most of the action scenes especially the ending which may bring some viewers to tears and the natural bond between the kids reminded me of classic films like Stand By Me and The Goonies with a dash of Signs, Monsters and E.T. and is mostly like those films than being a full blown thrilling and terrifying sci-fi/action flick and to be honest this is just a retro family film than what trailers lead you to believe. There were a couple of plot holes that bothered me like where did all the missing dogs go? How did the monster get there in the first place and are there more? Was is just a mad science experiment gone wrong? Ect. When it actually shows the monster it wasn't scary enough and went the King Kong route and made it have feelings which was a tad cheesy and what I'm trying to say is that it didn't go horror enough with not enough terror and suspense for a monster movie or whatever it was aiming for which I still don't know because it tried to juggle a bunch of genres at once which in the end kind of played against it and became less effective as it moves along. I liked how it was paying tribute to all of the classic movies of it's kind of that decade but mabey a little too much because alll it does is make you rememeber the good old days of the movies that you longed for that it tries so hard to become that it doesn't focus enough on becoming it's own movie which sooner or later will be forgotten.",3,IT WAS JUST OK FLICK ..

1399326,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004EPYZPS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 2]","FILM RATING:  3.5 starsWhat I really love the most about writer/director J.J. Abrams' new film Super 8 (2011) is how it made me so fondly reminisce and wax nostalgic for the great, but sometimes a bit ""cheesy"" (in hindsight), movies I grew up loving in the 1980s. Like The Goonies (1985), E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Explorers (1985), and even Stand By Me (1986).  Abrams has woven together a good story here about five childhood friends who love hanging out and making movies...at least when they're not quarreling and making fun of each other. It's an homage to himself and executive director Steven Spielberg (and many more of us), who grew up much like these kids, making their own homemade movies. Set in the 1970s, the kids especially like making zombie and horror movies, recording them on their own Super 8mm film camera with a microphone taped to the end of a broomstick ""boom"". These boys are all geeks and misfits, like we all really were when we were their age. Come on...admit it...you were an awkward kid too!With legendary writer/director/producer Spielberg on board this project as both producer and ""Godfather"", you kind of knew something magical, and a bit cheesy, would happen in this film. I just wish it was a bit more magical in the story and character development, and less magical in the visual effects, lens flare, and alien aspects. Don't get me wrong, I liked all of that stuff, and I think Super 8 is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. But I also can't help feeling that the third act of the film fell apart. I think once the ""Area 51 Surprise"" is introduced visually, the film gets weaker. And the fun relationships and bonds that the five boys have, along with their girl crush addition to the group (played by Elle Fanning), kind of melts. Still, there is a lot to love in this summer blockbuster. For one, it's original material that isn't based on a comic book or toy, and it isn't a sequel or remake. Super 8 seems to be the Inception of this year. It's smart, stylistic, and filled with cool visual effects and a great ensemble cast that gives excellent performances. Kudos to Abrams for a well-written script...at least for most of the movie.The first act of the film brings with it some of the best performances by a group of kids I've seen in awhile. All five of the boys, led by newcomer Joel Courtney, create an energetic group dynamic that allows each to feed off the other...snapping sarcastic and sharp dialogue that definitely made me feel like a kid again. And paradoxically feel both the awkwardness and greatness of that time in my life. Kyle Chandler, as the single widowed father of Joel's character Joe, and the police officer who gets to the bottom of the train wreck and it's supernatural circumstances, delivers a solid performance that gels the focus on family built into Abrams script. The same can be said for the supporting role played by Ron Eldard as the single alcoholic father of Elle's character Alice. The entire cast of Super 8 feels right and supports Abrams very strongly in bringing the script to life.One of director J.J. Abrams strengths is bringing together an incredible crew of talented artists and technicians who create productions of the highest quality. While the rumored budget for Super 8 was only $50 million, this movie looks and feels like a $100 million plus production. The production design, cinematography, music, sound, and visual effects are all well executed and support the story perfectly. I felt completely transported back to the 1970s, or at least to my imagination of what the 70s was like. The sets, costumes, props, and everything else in the production design (led by Production Designer Martin Whist) gave the film that historic feel that I just love in the movies. There's something about going to the movies and escaping into a different time, whether in the past or the future, that always works for me. And when its done well, I really appreciate it.Director of Photography Larry Fong, known for his work on 300 (2006) and the TV show Lost, provides some stunning cinematography that literal had me gasping for air in awe. While I'm not a HUGE fan of Abrams' now signature lens flare look that he started with his remake of Star Trek (2009), it works up until I started noticing it too much...same as in Star Trek. I'm hoping that Abrams' learns that less is more sometimes, and lens flares can be great when used in the right places to support the story, but can be annoying when they BECOME the story. While I didn't overly notice the music by composer Michael Giacchino, I also didn't feel like any music was missing at crucial points during the movie. I would definitely like to listen to the Super 8 score again and focus on it because I think there were some good pieces of music throughout the movie. The sound design and sound editing was outstanding on Super 8. The dialogue was dead on and all of the explosions, gunfire, and other special events that I expected to feel from the sound of the movie worked well.The bottom line is that Super 8 is the summer blockbuster to go see in my humble opinion so far this year. While I haven't yet seen any of the many superhero or comic book movies that have filled the screens the last two months, I do know that I really enjoyed Super 8 on the big screen. It's the kind of popcorn movie that I grew up loving and looking forward to. I love going to the theater for a clever, original film like this one. Super 8 starts as an outstanding film (4.5 stars) but ends as just a good film (3 stars). So I've given it an initial rating of 3.5 stars. It's one of those movies I wanna watch again at home on blu-ray to see if it gets better the next time. It may just be a 4 star film for me eventually, but for now it's at least locked in as one of the best movies of 2011, likely to find a place on my Top 10 at year's end.",4,Super Nostalgia for

In this case they are trying to make a movie, but they could have easily been going on a night out, a picnic, a party or some other event.  All that is required is someone be using a video camera at the time to record the events.  In this case a train wreck is filmed.  Not the first time I'm sure a train wreck was filmed, and once again it could have been a truck or plane crash as well.  Then we have the typical government cover up, we have seen that many times.

Before that he made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  Both films are five star classics.  This is his production but made by a younger director whom he picked. It is not that this movie is bad, it is that it made me sad that there will probably be no more groundbreaking five star films from him in this genre. This film has the family life of both films.  It has got the alien but he is not much onscreen. It has the ship, straight out of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. The visuals at the ending are almost verbatim from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. Basically it is a movie about a group of youngsters making a super eight film in 1979 about zombies, who have a close encounter with an alien.  This happens when they  witness a colossal train wreck.  The train wreck is really impressive. I was actually quite taken with the original premise, of the kids making the zombie picture in super 8.  That could have been a much fresher, more original film had the alien aspect of the story not taken over from the train wreck forward.  I think it could have been a classic like Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME if they had stuck with the kids and their movie adventures.  I hadn't seen Elle Fanning recently.

1399364,AN9J46667D80O,B004EPYZPS,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 5]","Back when I was growing up there was a young filmmaker known for great movies like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial. These were wonderful movies. The first was scary, the second was thought-provoking and the third was excellent family entertainment. As the 1980's came along, this filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, made other fine works, like the Indiana Jones series and in the 1990's gave us Jurassic Park. Then he discovered World War II, and that was basically then end of him making ""genre"" films that appealed to a wide audience.But apparently I wasn't the only one who had fond memories of Spielberg's earlier career. JJ Abrams, noted as the man who made Lost and directed the Star Trek reboot, seems to also have those sorts of good memories. So he teamed up with Spielberg and made Super 8, a film which, aside from the modern special effects, would not seem out of place in Spielberg's resume.Super 8 centers around events in small-town Ohio in 1979. Joe Lamb is a young boy whose mother has died at the start of the film. Four months later he and his friends are making a zombie movie when they inadvertently bear witness to a massive (and extremelyunrealistic), train derailment. They escape with their lives, unaware that something else has escaped, too. Soon all the town's dogs disappear, only to turn up in nearby towns. The Air Force arrives to clean up the train mess and begins basically overtaking the town (and get away with massive lies, because if there's one thing we know about the 1970's, it's that investigative journalism didn't really exist and trust in the government was absolute). Then various items and people start to disappear and the action gets ramped-up to eleven, leading to an unnecessarily action-heavy third act.At its core this is a movie about the relationship between a young boy, his friends and a girl that he's starting to develop a crush on. The movie is at its finest when it shows these kids just being kids. When it shows them hanging out chatting in a diner and teasing each other like kids do. When it shows them sneaking out of their homes to film at night. When it shows them being appalled/overjoyed that they're actually breaking into their school during summer vacation. These moments, as well as the ones highlighting Joe's somewhat complicated relationship with his father, also the town deputy and person in charge after the sherrif disappears), are the true heart of the film.Those moments also make the moments of action, which include the military going nuts in the middle of the town, completely unnecessary. Those scenes add nothing to the plot, really, aside from creating some artificial peril for our heroes to deal with. Really one could edit out all the military elements and be left with a good, solid, summer science fiction film for the whole family. Also, having gone nuts with the action sequence, I feel that Abrams missed a really opportunity to kill off one of the kids. Harsh? Maybe, but it might have added something to the film. But consider the one of the pivotal moments of Jaws is when a six-year-old boy is gruesomely eaten by the shark.I also need to make mention of Abrams as a director. He's good at what he does. He's very good at what he does. But he's never met a lens flare he didn't like, and frankly it's really, really distracting. If you thought scenes in Star Trek overused the lens flare, just you wait. Abrams really goes nuts with it in this movie and it does not add anything to the film.Ultimately this is a very good movie, and I'd said it's suitable for pretty much the entire family.",4,Lens flares for all!,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,3626,"['Back', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'there', 'was', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'known', 'great', 'movies', 'Jaws', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'E.T', 'Extra-Terrestrial', 'were', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'first', 'was', 'scary', 'second', 'was', 'thought-provoking', 'third', 'was', 'excellent', 'family', 'entertainment', '1980', 'came', 'along', 'filmmaker', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'other', 'fine', 'works', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', '1990', 'gave', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Then', 'discovered', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'basically', 'then', 'end', 'making', 'genre', 'films', 'appealed', 'wide', 'audience.But', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'Spielberg', 'earlier', 'career', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'noted', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'Lost', 'directed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'also', 'have', 'sorts', 'good', 'memories', 'teamed', 'up', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'aside', 'modern', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'place', 'Spielberg', 'resume.Super', '8', 'centers', 'events', 'small-town', 'Ohio', '1979', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'start', 'film', 'Four', 'months', 'later', 'friends', 'are', 'making', 'zombie', 'movie', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'bear', 'witness', 'massive', 'extremelyunrealistic', 'train', 'derailment', 'escape', 'lives', 'unaware', 'something', 'else', 'escaped', 'too', 'Soon', 'town', 'dogs', 'disappear', 'only', 'turn', 'up', 'nearby', 'towns', 'Air', 'Force', 'clean', 'up', 'train', 'mess', 'basically', 'overtaking', 'town', 'get', 'away', 'massive', 'lies', 'one', 'thing', 'know', '1970', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'trust', 'government', 'was', 'absolute', 'Then', 'various', 'items', 'people', 'start', 'disappear', 'action', 'ramped-up', 'eleven', 'leading', 'unnecessarily', 'action-heavy', 'third', 'act.At', 'core', 'movie', 'relationship', 'young', 'boy', 'friends', 'girl', 'starting', 'develop', 'crush', 'movie', 'finest', 'when', 'kids', 'just', 'being', 'kids', 'When', 'hanging', 'out', 'chatting', 'diner', 'teasing', 'other', 'kids', 'do', 'When', 'sneaking', 'homes', 'film', 'night', 'When', 'being', 'appalled/overjoyed', ""'re"", 'actually', 'breaking', 'school', 'summer', 'vacation', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'ones', 'highlighting', 'Joe', 'somewhat', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'father', 'also', 'town', 'deputy', 'person', 'charge', 'sherrif', 'disappears', 'are', 'true', 'heart', 'film.Those', 'moments', 'also', 'make', 'moments', 'action', 'include', 'military', 'going', 'nuts', 'middle', 'town', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'add', 'nothing', 'plot', 'really', 'aside', 'creating', 'artificial', 'peril', 'heroes', 'deal', 'Really', 'one', 'could', 'edit', 'out', 'military', 'elements', 'be', 'left', 'good', 'solid', 'summer', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'Also', 'having', 'gone', 'nuts', 'action', 'sequence', 'feel', 'Abrams', 'missed', 'really', 'opportunity', 'kill', 'off', 'one', 'kids', 'Harsh', 'Maybe', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'something', 'film', 'consider', 'one', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'Jaws', 'when', 'six-year-old', 'boy', 'gruesomely', 'eaten', 'shark.I', 'also', 'need', 'make', 'mention', 'Abrams', 'director', 'good', 'what', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'never', 'met', 'lens', 'flare', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'frankly', 'really', 'really', 'distracting', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'overused', 'lens', 'flare', 'just', 'wait', 'Abrams', 'really', 'nuts', 'movie', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'film.Ultimately', 'very', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'said', 'suitable', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

1399368,ACJVGDN8G386P,B004EPYZPS,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[3, 9]","Even though this film was written and directed by J.J. Abrahms, the film oozes with Spielberg-ness. The film centers around a group of kids who have much more insight and wisdom than the adults, much like ET. The military branch of the US Government moves in, trying to hide whats really happening, much like Close Encounter of the Third Kind. And there's a large hulking space creature that I guess is not quite as malicious as the creature from Alien but he's tearing up a small town. As you'll see, some of the creature's victims are treated similarly to Alien.The film involves a group of kids of junior high school age in 1979 shooting their own zombie-horror flick; one of whom has just lost his mother. The director Charles (played very convincingly by the young and talented Riley Griffiths), a sort of 12-year-old throwback to Orson Welles, replete with pipe, is the obsessed and ambition filmmaker doing everything he can to make a great film. He is constantly speaking of ""production value"". My guess is his character may have been somewhat based on the young Steven Spielberg who pressed his friends into little film projects shot with his super-8 camera back in the 1950's. The two other characters which emerge as the main focus are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) two people thrust together because of their involvement with the film project who become somewhat intimate in a way that only 12-year-old's can. A supporting character of note has to be Cary, played by Ryan Lee, who carries around fire crackers just to make the older folk cringe.The group is shooting a scene at a train station with the boy main character and the only girl in the movie. Their production literally becomes derailed by a train wreck which obliterates everything in sight, not to mention the station, although the super-8 camera which continued to film was surprisingly untouched! Of course, this is not just a train derailment: the whole train looks like it was in the middle of the front lines in WWII. A man in a busted up pick-up, looking half-dead, who may have intentionally derailed the train, tells the kids to run for their lives. The kids escape in their car, which was also surprisingly untouched, before the military guys show up with flash-lights and guns.The story then moves on several fronts: the mystery of the train wreck, Charles' obsession with completing his movie, and the relationship between Joe and Alice and their parents. Eventually, when more of the mystery is revealed, the film becomes largely about a kind of reconciliation between the two kids and their parents. At a certain point, the movie-making aspect takes a back seat to the relationships of the two kids and the two adults. It seemed like Charles, the director, at one point, seems more like a supporting character.Although I definitely enjoyed this film, largely because of the believability of the kids which is first-rate by any standard, I was frustrated on a couple of points. I thought the movie was trying to do too many things given its parameters. To me, the relationship between the two main kid characters and their parents distracted away from the really interesting idea about the kids trying to make their movie. Also, I thought there would be a lot more about the footage which was gotten at the train wreck.The one character who I felt was slightly under-developed was Charles, the kid director. His screen time was sacrificed in order to develop more about the adult relationships, which I found less interesting, some of which seemed just a touch clich&eacute;. I wanted to know more about Charles, why he was shooting his films and other information. Only late in the film do we learn more about him and why he was engaging in this project.Two stories which are very similar to this film, Spielberg's ET and Stephen King's IT, focus almost exclusively on the kids, who they are, and what they are trying to accomplish. If a story begins about a group of kids, I think it is better for the story to stay on them rather getting off on tangents. Super-8 started out that way, but then took a bit of a side turn and focused more on a couple of the adult characters.

INSIDIOUS was the first over-hyped movie that left me speechless as to just how OVERRATED (and lame) a movie could be, and that was soon followed by SUPER 8. The original teaser trailer promised something dark and sci-fi spooky in the vein of X-FILES. However the trailer didn't blow me away, nor did it make me want to see the film. When I started hearing that this film actually was a lighter film and would recall the better days of Spielberg in which childhood and adventure blended perfectly, I began to get hopeful. But within thirty-minutes of SUPER 8, I felt nothing but disappointment, and that feeling only intensified as the movie lumbered along. An immediate turn-off was the language. I don't care if kids REALLY DO talk like sailors or not, the amount of profanity, which includes one or two instances of the 'F' bomb in this film, is ridiculous and unnecessary. Add to that, the sexual humor and at least one instance of drug-abuse from one character, and you DO NOT have a family film in the best tradition of Spielberg. You have a movie that offends and will probably anger some parents who fell to the hype. Look at the PG-13 rating folks! It's there for a reason!I have read where others have compared this to films like GOONIES and STAND BY ME. Those films had likeable, believable kids. SUPER 8's kids are irritatingly loud, irresponsible and vulgar. So why am I supposed to LIKE them? The fact is, I don't. They are examples of the WORST kind of behavior from children. I have heard this film defended for its language, because that's how kids really talk. I get it, but that doesn't mean that a film MUST adhere to that kind of realism in order to keep their audience entertained. Other films have won children and adults over alike without resorting to profanity; certainly not to the degree that SUPER 8 contains.Having kids curse in films is a bore. It's not needed.As for the big sci-fi ALIEN elements within SUPER 8, all I can say is WOW, couldn't they have come up with something more original than that? All in all, a summer BUST for me. If you liked or loved it, fine. I didn't. If I really want my family to watch a film that blends childhood with sci-fi adventure and doesn't rely on anything offensive, I'll just put in IRON GIANT or HOOK, or a thousand other films that are better than SUPER 8.",2,The most overrated movie of the decade!,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2488,"['second', 'time', 'one', 'year', 'find', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'saw', 'same', 'film', 'others', 'did', 'positively', 'RAVED', 'film', 'anyway', 'INSIDIOUS', 'was', 'first', 'over-hyped', 'movie', 'left', 'speechless', 'just', 'how', 'OVERRATED', 'lame', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'soon', 'followed', 'SUPER', '8', 'original', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'promised', 'something', 'dark', 'sci-fi', 'spooky', 'vein', 'X-FILES', 'However', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'did', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'When', 'started', 'hearing', 'film', 'actually', 'was', 'lighter', 'film', 'would', 'recall', 'better', 'days', 'Spielberg', 'childhood', 'adventure', 'blended', 'perfectly', 'began', 'get', 'hopeful', 'thirty-minutes', 'SUPER', '8', 'felt', 'nothing', 'disappointment', 'feeling', 'only', 'intensified', 'movie', 'lumbered', 'along', 'immediate', 'turn-off', 'was', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'kids', 'REALLY', 'DO', 'talk', 'sailors', 'not', 'amount', 'profanity', 'one', 'two', 'instances', 'F', 'bomb', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'unnecessary', 'Add', 'sexual', 'humor', 'least', 'one', 'instance', 'drug-abuse', 'one', 'character', 'DO', 'NOT', 'have', 'family', 'film', 'best', 'tradition', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'anger', 'parents', 'who', 'fell', 'hype', 'Look', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'folks', 'there', 'reason', 'have', 'read', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'compared', 'films', 'GOONIES', 'STAND', 'BY', 'ME', 'films', 'had', 'likeable', 'believable', 'kids', 'SUPER', '8', 'kids', 'are', 'irritatingly', 'loud', 'irresponsible', 'vulgar', 'So', 'why', 'am', 'supposed', 'LIKE', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'examples', 'WORST', 'kind', 'behavior', 'children', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'defended', 'language', 'how', 'kids', 'really', 'talk', 'get', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'MUST', 'adhere', 'kind', 'realism', 'order', 'keep', 'audience', 'entertained', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'won', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'resorting', 'profanity', 'certainly', 'not', 'degree', '8', 'contains.Having', 'kids', 'curse', 'films', 'bore', 'not', 'needed.As', 'big', 'sci-fi', 'ALIEN', 'elements', 'SUPER', '8', 'can', 'say', 'WOW', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'original', 'summer', 'BUST', 'liked', 'loved', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'family', 'watch', 'film', 'childhood', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'rely', 'anything', 'offensive', ""'ll"", 'just', 'put', 'IRON', 'GIANT', 'HOOK', 'thousand', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'better', 'SUPER', '8']",N/A

When I saw the glimpses, even with some of the earlier trailers, I found myself reminded about a good deal of the Anime I've seen for the Sci-Fi and/or Horror genre. Particularly the ones that happened to touch upon the scientific technology only slightly, and the horror is minute. The draw for these Anime is the actual storyline and the characters. Normally I find myself not interested in watching American movies for this genre, but when I saw the trailers, I found myself wanting to watch the movies at least once.When the movie popped up on the big screen , I found that my comparisons to the Anime I like from those two genre was not far off at all. While the subject of ""the thing"" and other scientific elements crop up in the movie, not to mention there are a few times I felt a slight terror running through my mind, I felt that it wasn't over done. Instead, the movie focused on the characters and the plot line. I found myself drawn into the whole thing.The characters came to life in my mind. Each of the children in their group had their own distinct personalities. There are also quite a bit of growing up issues presented within the movie, dealt with in a believable fashion. There is also the issue with dealing with parents that are over bearing. The movie is one of those that one should watch at least once, despite the fact that Spielberg does over do the detail when it comes to certain things, but that only adds to the fantastical element in the story. Not to mention it is expected of his work.I got what I expected out of the movie. There was a great plot, a nice romance story that came across as  believable, not to mention age appropriate was also in there. The story line had quite a few cliches in it, but in the long run the plot flowed smoothly from beginning to end.

1399375,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B004EPYZPS,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 10]","JJ Abrams has made hit movies. Has he ever made a good movie? With Super 8, he wrote, directed and produced two movies, and sacrificed the good to make sure he had a hit.Super 8 begins just fine, the story of a group of young teens making a movie about zombies. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is determined to enter his movie in a film contest. He's the director and writer. Joe (Joel Courtney) is his best friend and make-up specialist.  When Charles recruits Alice (Elle Fanning) for a role (she can drive and they need a car), Joe starts to learn what puberty can do to a fella.We're off on a small town adventure of stealth movie making, improvisation, determination, spontaneity and, as far as I know, effective zombie acting. One night when the kids have sneaked away from their homes to film a night scene at the railway station, Charles sees a train coming. ""Production values!"" he happily exclaims and sets up the scene so the train roaring by will be in his movie. Bad luck. A truck drives onto the tracks and smashes head on into the train. There's a massive derailment only Hollywood CGI can create. It goes on and on.Now the young moviemakers are center stage in a new movie, this one about an alien creature captured by the Air Force and in the charge of a particularly ruthless colonel and his men. This movie is made to insure a hit with that real-life demographic, the 16 through 28 crowd. Yes, in the crash the alien, which looks something like a quick-stepping giant tarantula crossbred with the real mama from hell in Alien, escapes. Thanks to a couple of film cartons the kids dropped as they ran from the crash, the colonel figures out someone might have seen too much and filmed it. Soon dogs run away from town, engines from cars are stolen, electronic gear disappears and people vanish, all in clouds of wowzer and predictable special effects.In the course of Super 8 we'll follow young Joe through adventures that now are by the numbers...evacuations, tanks, house explosions, great caverns, missing townspeople including Alice hanging upside down waiting to become alien snacks, Joe's face-to-face heroism with the big bug, and one of the most non-thrilling examples of spaceship building in any movie. Although the alien looks like something really big that escaped from an insect zoo, it turns out that, despite its chomping down on people with slobber and lots of teeth, it's really just a guy (or woman) who is scared and lonely, who has been treated badly by the Air Force, and just wants to build a spaceship so it can go home.JJ Abrams creates a warm, nostalgic story about kids back in the Seventies who are energetically making a movie while keeping it secret from adults. The kid actors do a fine, believable job and we like them. Their small town is a great place to live in. Charles' family is a wonderful mix of love and chaos. We're hooked with these kids and with Charles' movie. And all this just becomes loose ends. (We do get to see Charles' movie during the credits...like an afterthought.In his determination to win a big audience, Abrams sacrifices all that in favor of by-the-numbers demographic pandering and CGI. Abrams worked for Steven Spielberg for a while and Spielberg is a producer of Super 8. Spielberg's influence is all over the movie.

The locations, oh wow, were just fantastic and just gave it that really cool retro childhood vibe. The whole thing was coming together nicely and I thought hey how did I miss this.... And then they start showing too much of the monster. And then the girl gets in trouble. And then it just kind of turns into a weird monster battle but I guess.... It could have been something a lot less modern and in your face and it could have rode that special train of subtlety in film to something far greater.I don't think the monster needed to be so big and nor do I think it needed to destroy half the town.

The cubes making up the ship and the thing just wanting to go home was a nice touch but I think it all went a little too far by the end and turned into a typical monster movie. Anyway, it is a pretty good film and should entertain the kids and family for a bit. A little too much of that schmaltz again from Spielberg but all in all I enjoyed my time with it.",3,First half is five stars.

1399380,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPYZPS,C. Sawin,"[5, 8]","J.J. Abrams is a writer/director/producer I can't quite get a read on. I never bothered with any of the TV series he was involved with (""Alias,"" ""Lost,"" ""Fringe"") and after practically loathing Mission: Impossible II, I skipped III altogether. On the other hand though, Star Trek was pretty fantastic, Joy Ride sits comfortably in my collection of guilty pleasures, and Cloverfield was pretty decent at times. So Abrams work basically ranges from okay to amazing to me. So you can understand why my excitement for Super 8 was easy to contain. Trailers didn't reveal much of anything. Other than some kids making a zombie movie that witness a devastating train crash with some sort of extraordinary creature as its cargo being unleashed and the trailers giving off a big E.T. vibe, there wasn't much else to take away from it. That's the point with an Abrams project though; that key element is kept secret to pique interest and the payoff is usually something spectacular. Super 8 certainly delivers something worth waiting for.We spend most of the time with the kids of the film. If it's not the zombie film we're focused on, it's the friendship between Joe (Joel Courtney) and Charles (Riley Griffiths) or the relationship that develops between Joe and Alice (Elle Fanning). Something tragic happens to Joe and it's a story point that manages to make itself relevant throughout the course of the film. As you can imagine, the first half of the film is a little slow. Things crawl along while some depth is added to the characters. Character development is never something to be ashamed of.The train wreck is where things pick up. The sound effects used in the film are so loud, so distinct, and so precise that it makes you feel like you're actually there at that train station witnessing this horrific event in person. The sound utilized in the film is a huge drawing point for seeing the film in theaters. Explosions are felt not heard as the creature's screams seem to vibrate your very bones.Speaking of explosions, the special effects are also quite impressive. The teases leading up to the creature's big reveal draw a lot of interest. Cars being thrown in the air, heavy machinery being totally destroyed in an instant, something monstrous and inhuman being seen in reflective surfaces, and people screaming for their lives as something races across the screen and abducts them. But obviously the actual creature is the high point of the special effects. Look no further than the Kelvin gas station scene, the bus scene, or the entire finale for proof of this. As far as the creature is concerned, Cloverfield will probably be the first thing that comes to mind. But you actually get to SEE what was on that train and it's fairly astounding.The film is kind of like if E.T. and The Goonies were combined into one film along with bits of Cloverfield and Battle: Los Angeles injected into it. You know, if Battle: Los Angeles wasn't a total letdown.Super 8 is a rather brilliant sci-fi thriller. There's plenty of buildup and character development, which results in big action sequences having a bigger impact and actually makes you care about these characters when something goes wrong for them. The creature is teased for so long that when you do finally see it, it feels like a huge accomplishment. The cast of kids is really the heart of the film while Elle Fanning's exceptional acting puts her ahead of the pack. The film blindsides you in the gut with a strong assault of emotion that makes you reminisce the best and most memorable Steven Spielberg films. Not to mention the outstanding special effects and loud yet engaging use of sound. Super 8 is an emotionally powerful sci-fi film featuring a wonderful cast, solid storyline, immense sound effects, groundbreaking special effects, and some ridiculously awesome action sequences.",4,A well-rounded sci-fi thriller,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,3848,"['J.J.', 'Abrams', 'writer/director/producer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'read', 'never', 'bothered', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'involved', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'Fringe', 'practically', 'loathing', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'II', 'skipped', 'III', 'altogether', 'other', 'hand', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'comfortably', 'collection', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'times', 'So', 'Abrams', 'work', 'basically', 'ranges', 'okay', 'amazing', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'excitement', 'Super', '8', 'was', 'easy', 'contain', 'Trailers', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'anything', 'Other', 'kids', 'making', 'zombie', 'movie', 'witness', 'devastating', 'train', 'crash', 'sort', 'extraordinary', 'creature', 'cargo', 'being', 'unleashed', 'trailers', 'giving', 'off', 'big', 'E.T', 'vibe', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'take', 'away', 'point', 'Abrams', 'project', 'key', 'element', 'kept', 'secret', 'pique', 'interest', 'payoff', 'usually', 'something', 'spectacular', 'Super', '8', 'certainly', 'delivers', 'something', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.We', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'kids', 'film', 'not', 'zombie', 'film', ""'re"", 'focused', 'friendship', 'Joe', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'Charles', 'Riley', 'Griffiths', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'Alice', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Something', 'tragic', 'happens', 'Joe', 'story', 'point', 'make', 'relevant', 'course', 'film', 'can', 'imagine', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'little', 'slow', 'Things', 'crawl', 'along', 'depth', 'added', 'characters', 'Character', 'development', 'never', 'something', 'be', 'ashamed', 'of.The', 'train', 'wreck', 'where', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'sound', 'effects', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'loud', 'so', 'distinct', 'so', 'precise', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'train', 'station', 'witnessing', 'horrific', 'event', 'person', 'sound', 'utilized', 'film', 'huge', 'drawing', 'point', 'seeing', 'film', 'theaters', 'Explosions', 'are', 'felt', 'not', 'heard', 'creature', 'screams', 'seem', 'vibrate', 'very', 'bones.Speaking', 'explosions', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'impressive', 'teases', 'leading', 'up', 'creature', 'big', 'reveal', 'lot', 'interest', 'Cars', 'being', 'thrown', 'air', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'being', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'instant', 'something', 'monstrous', 'inhuman', 'being', 'seen', 'reflective', 'surfaces', 'people', 'screaming', 'lives', 'something', 'races', 'screen', 'obviously', 'actual', 'creature', 'high', 'point', 'special', 'effects', 'Look', 'further', 'Kelvin', 'gas', 'station', 'scene', 'bus', 'scene', 'entire', 'finale', 'proof', 'As', 'far', 'creature', 'concerned', 'Cloverfield', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'actually', 'get', 'SEE', 'what', 'was', 'train', 'fairly', 'astounding.The', 'film', 'kind', 'E.T', 'Goonies', 'were', 'combined', 'one', 'film', 'bits', 'Cloverfield', 'Battle', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'injected', 'know', 'Battle', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'letdown.Super', '8', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'plenty', 'buildup', 'character', 'development', 'results', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'having', 'bigger', 'impact', 'actually', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'creature', 'teased', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'do', 'finally', 'see', 'huge', 'accomplishment', 'cast', 'kids', 'really', 'heart', 'film', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'ahead', 'pack', 'film', 'gut', 'strong', 'assault', 'emotion', 'reminisce', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'Not', 'mention', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'loud', 'yet', 'engaging', 'use', 'sound', 'Super', '8', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'featuring', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'solid', 'storyline', 'immense', 'sound', 'effects', 'groundbreaking', 'special', 'effects', 'ridiculously', 'awesome', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

He often repeats himself a bit too closely and when another director follows his lead, the results could be disastrous.  This film wasn't as bad as some people have been led to think.  They're married to the style and overly involved in a type of movie that by now leads to repetition and cliche.  For those of us not buried in this genre, the film has its good points.The kids played their parts quite well, for the main part.  The girl was outstanding.The last shots near the end of the film made the kids look ten years older and that didn't work out at all.  The music was strictly by the numbers but it's exhiliratingto hear a full orchestra.  There were no real themes or development.  I personally stopped caring about the monster somewhere midway in the film.The situation and the drama are aimed directly at the audience, as if, somehow, somebody had rated each scene according to saleability and then strung them together.The tricks have been done before in other films but then again so have the Sherlock Holmes films or the Thin Man series, or Star Trek...The list is enormous.  There's nothing inherently bad in repeating success.  Hollywood has been doing it for over a hundred years.  When the repetition is ham-fisted, though, it does become quite annoying and this was ham-fisted all right.  However the film does fly by, there are no ""dead"" moments until the saccharine ending which aims at the heartstrings but reaches the bile of the viewer instead.  Anyone could have organized a more efficient ending. I did enjoy most of the film, though, and the production values helped it out in a big way.Curtis Stotlar",3,Derivative? Yes.  Boring?

The only question is just how good. Super 8 is a mash-up of E.T. and Cloverfield.  That's an oversimplification and a big disservice to the hard work that went into Super 8, which stands on its own two feet as a sci-fi movie with a lot of heart.  Much of that heart comes from Super 8's child actors who far outshine most of their adult counterparts this movie season.  Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning stand out in the two lead roles, but everyone in the movie did an A+ job, at times capturing the camaraderie of films like Stand by Me as well as the sense of wild eyed adventure from Goonies.Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends in an Ohio steel town who witness a cataclysmic train crash, inadvertently capturing it on a super 8 movie camera while making a student film. It's clear that something monstrous was aboard that train and made its escape during the crash. When the U.S. Air force comes to town, local law man, Jackson Lamb does his best to get to the bottom of a series of disappearances and thefts that plague the town in the wake of the crash.  But the civilians who know the most about what happened the night of the crash are the kids who witnessed it while shooting their super 8 movie, including Jackson's son, Joe.Super 8 does an excellent job of taking you along the adventure with its characters.  You'll uncover the mystery alongside them. Unlike a who done it, I never felt the need to guess who or what was behind all the craziness. Super 8 just took me along for a crazy ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it, and as with the best thrill rides I totally lost track of the time.  Going into the movie I feared there would be a boring half hour build up or some down time, as there is in a lot of 2 hour movies. I'm looking at you A.I. I couldn't have been more wrong. Super 8 is pitch perfect. Action, laughs, human drama and a few scares. It's all there.  I won't spoil the set piece action scenes in this review, but there is one in particular which is the best I've seen so far this year, and that includes action tour de forces like Source Code, Thor, and X-Men: First Class.Special mention must be made at how the film makers captured 1979 down to the tiniest detail. Super 8 doubles as a time warp the same way Mad Men does with Don Draper and company. To sum it up, Super 8 is a must see and it's very much a big screen movie experience, even at today's inflated ticket prices.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",5,Super Aliens,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,2579,"['Review', 'When', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'get', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'rest', 'assured', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'only', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Super', '8', 'mash-up', 'E.T', 'Cloverfield', 'oversimplification', 'big', 'disservice', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'Super', '8', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'Much', 'heart', 'Super', '8', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'far', 'outshine', 'most', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'movie', 'season', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'stand', 'out', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'everyone', 'movie', 'did', 'A+', 'job', 'times', 'capturing', 'camaraderie', 'films', 'Stand', 'Me', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'wild', 'eyed', 'adventure', 'Goonies.Super', '8', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'Ohio', 'steel', 'town', 'who', 'witness', 'cataclysmic', 'train', 'crash', 'inadvertently', 'capturing', 'super', '8', 'movie', 'camera', 'making', 'student', 'film', 'clear', 'something', 'monstrous', 'was', 'train', 'made', 'escape', 'crash', 'When', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'force', 'town', 'local', 'law', 'man', 'Jackson', 'Lamb', 'best', 'get', 'bottom', 'series', 'disappearances', 'thefts', 'plague', 'town', 'wake', 'crash', 'civilians', 'who', 'know', 'most', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'crash', 'are', 'kids', 'who', 'witnessed', 'shooting', 'super', '8', 'movie', 'including', 'Jackson', 'son', 'Joe.Super', '8', 'excellent', 'job', 'taking', 'adventure', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'uncover', 'mystery', 'who', 'done', 'never', 'felt', 'need', 'guess', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'craziness', 'Super', '8', 'just', 'took', 'along', 'crazy', 'ride', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'best', 'thrill', 'totally', 'lost', 'track', 'time', 'Going', 'movie', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'half', 'hour', 'build', 'up', 'down', 'time', 'lot', '2', 'hour', 'movies', ""'m"", 'looking', 'A.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'Super', '8', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Action', 'human', 'drama', 'few', 'scares', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'set', 'piece', 'action', 'scenes', 'review', 'one', 'particular', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'action', 'tour', 'forces', 'Source', 'Code', 'Thor', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class.Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'how', 'film', 'makers', 'captured', '1979', 'tiniest', 'detail', 'Super', '8', 'doubles', 'time', 'same', 'way', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Don', 'Draper', 'company', 'sum', 'up', 'Super', '8', 'must', 'see', 'very', 'much', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'experience', 'even', 'today', 'inflated', 'ticket', 'prices.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",N/A
1399384,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B004EPYZPS,David A. Wend,"[3, 7]","Super 8 was a far more interesting film that I thought. The trailers didn't look very interesting and what convinced me to see the movie were comments I heard on the radio. A comment that I recalled was that the first half of the film was like a Steven Spielberg movie (not surprising, as he was a producer) with the second half like a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.  I came away feeling the film was an excellent tribute to Mr. Spielberg.The story is set in a small suburb in 1979 and focuses of a group of movie-making kinds (much like Spielberg and writer-director J. J. Abrams themselves) who are making a zombie film.  The characters have their own deep conflicts centering on the death of Joel Lamb's mother (sensitively acted by Joel Courtney). Joel's father, a deputy sheriff (Kyle Chandler providing an excellent performance) has a strong dislike for one of his deceased wife's co-workers Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard). This causes problems in a budding romance between for Joel and Alice Dainard (beautifully played by Elle Fanning).  Everything changes when the kids observe a train derailment, documented on their Super 8 camera that allows an alien creature to escape.The feel of the movie was closer to ET for me with the kids knowing more than the adults and knowing what needs to happen once they have all the facts about what is going on.  This is a beautifully acted film with some excellent special effects that add to the viewing experience without being gratuitous.  I think Super 8 is the kind of film that can be enjoyed more when seen the second or third times.

I definitely fall into that camp and did in fact have a good time with this movie. It was fun to watch, interesting, fast paced and exciting to me.Although it didn't develop any really new sci-fi story ideas it did a good job of handling some tried and true sci-fi plot schemes and was in several ways similar to E.T.

On the other hand, sometimes I'll pick up a movie I have no knowledge of and have read nothing about and I'll love it. I also find that on a second viewing, I like the critically acclaimed movies more than I did on the first viewing. The letdown has passed, and I get more into the movie for what it is, not for what I expected it to be.So here's the cover hype. Is Super 8 ""the years most thrilling movie""? No. Is it ""an instant classic""? No. But it is, in my opinion, a really good movie that just misses, and it's hard to put your finger on why. The acting is fine, and the kids are engaging. Special effects are right on, and the subplots work their way into the storyline without becoming cumbersome. And the kids are remarkable, even more so after watching the special features about them. The leads never acted before? It's mind boggling.You can instantly make a comparison to E.T. (Kids & an Alien). But this picture has a totally different feel to it. The kids aren't as innocent, and the Alien isn't as sweet & helpless. They do try to pull a 360 on that fact at the end of the movie, but after raining death and destruction on the town for almost two hours, it's pretty hard to swallow. And there are some really special moments in this film. My favorite is watching Elle Fanning at the train station rehearsing her lines, and the faces on the other actors as they realize how good she is.So you can see the problem here, nothing but good things to say about the movie, and yet, it just misses. Why? If anyone was holding me down, and needed an answer, I might just have to say that although I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams (really), maybe the movie would have been better served if Spielberg had occupied the directors chair. Maybe the little thing this movie needed was a touch of Spielberg's magic.4 stars for the movie, and the fact that I will watch this, I'm sure, more than a few more times down the road. It is engaging and fun, and so I do recommend this for a purchase. If you lower your expectations just a tad, you will enjoy it. Hope this helps.",4,E.T.

And why not? Steven gave his blessings and executive produced as well. But somehow I think Steven did much more than just produce. The films feels so Stevenish you'd think he held Abrams hand all through the production. You get the usual dose of Spielbergisms with the cute early adolescent kids who act twice as mature and smart as REAL kids of that age.The film focuses on a group of kids in 1979 making a Super 8 zombie film (obviously inspired not by Steven but George Romero) and then get caught up in a government conspiracy involving a benign but very pissed-off extraterrestrial that the military has held prisoner for over 20 years. The kids witness the train wreck that causes it's escape and their peaceful little Ohio town experiences all sorts of mayhem.Aside from the typical monster-on-the-loose plot, the film does have some good character developement. The characters, both adults and teens, are well drawn out. Touching on issues such as loss of family members, alienation with parents, a little puberty thrown in and you have all the makings of a warm and fuzzy drama Spielberg style. The only problem is as said before, these kids act just too mature for their age. When I was this age in the 70s, me and everybody else were just plain stupid. And we certainly didn't open ourselves up to each other like they do here.All in all, the film is entertaining escapism for the summer season. While not a classic measuring up to the likes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or E.T., I think J.J. can chalk up another winner with this one.

At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses.

Abrams, 113 minutes, 2011) - Every now and then comes a film that is so much fun, so compelling, suspenseful, moving and well acted that you do not care how dumb and derivative it may be. SUPER 8 is not just your ordinary alien-monster-devours-a-town film. This has nostalgia, heart, Oscar-caliber acting and a director who has inherited the Flame from Spielberg.Charming, sweet young Joe Lamb (15-year-old Joel Courtney in his first major role) has lost his mother in an accident. It is circa 1979, in the hamlet of Lillian, Ohio (West Virginia served as the location). To alleviate the pain, he and his pals assist their pushy fellow junior high student in the making of a Super 8 zombie film. Witnessing a train accident at their prime location, the kids barely escape with their lives - not knowing what the wreck has unleashed. The train wreck has to be one of the most spectacular sequences ever filmed.Joe and his friends will discover much about extraterrestrial life before their week is finished - and it is here the film is at its most powerful. The kids are dead set on finishing their Super 8 film in time to submit it to an Ohio film contest. Having shot similar stuff in the mid-1970s, I can tell you: nothing stops a filmmaking obsession. Not even a giant, slimy alien.Although the attempts to get the kids talking right was a bit of a failure (kids did not say ""totally, dude"" in the 1970s, and this is just the tip of the anachronisms iceberg) - and the story certainly could have ended a bit better - it was all worth it. Abrams, while not slapping or shimmying the camera so much, is in full force with his trademark deliberate camera flare. It adds to the atmosphere, as does the rich cinematography and the location of a little old town.This is the first film I know of attempting to show us the elite cadre of budding filmmaking kids in the 1970s, and the Super 8 film festival culture. Spielberg, though he's approximately a fellow of my generation, filmed the same kinds of zombie flicks as a kid. Abrams pays deep homage to Spielberg; the pity about Spielberg not directing is that this might have been seen as a major comeback for him as a director. Oh well.Don't miss the kids' finished, hilarious Super 8 film, ""The Case"", which is shown in all its glory during the final credit roll. This goofy, 1950s-style monster flick is just the tonic we need in this frazzled era. My only wish is Abrams and Spielberg will keep up the good work.Featuring the talents of Noah Emmerich, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard, the sweet soon-to-be-a-superstar Elle Fanning (her sister Dakota had a split-second cameo as did Abrams) and Glynn Turman as Dr. Woodward.",5,"""Production value!!""",1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2719,"['SUPER', '8', 'prod', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'writ./dir', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', '113', 'minutes', '2011', 'Every', 'now', 'then', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'compelling', 'suspenseful', 'moving', 'well', 'acted', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'how', 'dumb', 'derivative', 'may', 'be', 'SUPER', '8', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'alien-monster-devours-a-town', 'film', 'nostalgia', 'heart', 'Oscar-caliber', 'acting', 'director', 'who', 'inherited', 'Flame', 'Spielberg.Charming', 'sweet', 'young', 'Joe', 'Lamb', '15-year-old', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'lost', 'mother', 'accident', 'circa', '1979', 'hamlet', 'Lillian', 'Ohio', 'West', 'Virginia', 'served', 'location', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'pals', 'assist', 'pushy', 'fellow', 'junior', 'high', 'student', 'making', 'Super', '8', 'zombie', 'film', 'Witnessing', 'train', 'accident', 'prime', 'location', 'kids', 'barely', 'escape', 'lives', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'wreck', 'unleashed', 'train', 'wreck', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'spectacular', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed.Joe', 'friends', 'will', 'discover', 'much', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'week', 'finished', 'here', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'kids', 'are', 'dead', 'set', 'finishing', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'time', 'submit', 'Ohio', 'film', 'contest', 'Having', 'shot', 'similar', 'stuff', 'mid-1970s', 'can', 'tell', 'nothing', 'filmmaking', 'obsession', 'Not', 'even', 'giant', 'slimy', 'attempts', 'get', 'kids', 'talking', 'right', 'was', 'bit', 'failure', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'totally', 'dude', '1970s', 'just', 'tip', 'anachronisms', 'iceberg', 'story', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'bit', 'better', 'was', 'Abrams', 'not', 'slapping', 'shimmying', 'camera', 'so', 'much', 'full', 'force', 'trademark', 'deliberate', 'camera', 'flare', 'atmosphere', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'location', 'little', 'old', 'town.This', 'first', 'film', 'know', 'attempting', 'show', 'elite', 'cadre', 'budding', 'filmmaking', 'kids', '1970s', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'festival', 'culture', 'Spielberg', 'approximately', 'fellow', 'generation', 'filmed', 'same', 'kinds', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'kid', 'Abrams', 'deep', 'homage', 'Spielberg', 'pity', 'Spielberg', 'not', 'directing', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'major', 'comeback', 'director', 'Oh', 'well.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'kids', 'finished', 'hilarious', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'Case', 'shown', 'glory', 'final', 'credit', 'roll', 'goofy', '1950s-style', 'monster', 'flick', 'just', 'tonic', 'need', 'frazzled', 'era', 'only', 'wish', 'Abrams', 'Spielberg', 'will', 'keep', 'good', 'work.Featuring', 'talents', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'sweet', 'soon-to-be-a-superstar', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'sister', 'Dakota', 'had', 'split-second', 'cameo', 'did', 'Abrams', 'Glynn', 'Turman', 'Dr.', 'Woodward']",N/A

The first few minutes seem to hold true to this. The movie starts with a bunch of kids making amateur movies. The acting is superb and it really evokes the images I have of a young Spielberg and Lucas making movies.However, it doesn't continue. About a quarter into the movie, it suddenly transforms into a 2000s movie. The kids start filming a scene and then accidentally catch a major train crash on film. Next, the movie turns into a sci-fi/alien mystery/thriller. While it's a mystery for all of the adults in the movie, to 21st century viewers the odd series of events obviously point to an alien. Thus, there really isn't any mystery to unravel. Also, the plot gyrates back and forth between Alien and E.T., which just doesn't make for a good mix. Some moments are really dark and scary, while at other points we're supposed to be laughing with the kids or staring in wonder.Fortunately, the kids are a joy to watch in their respective roles. Each of their characters possesses realistic quirks and lights of inspiration, from the chubby director to the pyromaniac ""zombie"" actor. They more than anything else capture that wild and free spirit of the young boy with his super 8 camera. Elle Fanning is superb as the girl who gets recruited to act in the amateur movies. Her acting scene near the beginning showed a level of maturity and intensity that left me agog. I think the movie would have been a LOT better if J.J. Abrams had stuck to the 1980s formula of really focusing the movie on the kids, as in E.T. or Goonies.Also, some of the overdone CG special effects, such as the train crash, seemed out of place and unrealistic. Did we really need a scene where the kids run from an exploding train?

Much like Star Trek, the cinematography and scoring are amazing. Much like Cloverfield, an amazing design of monster hits the screen like no other. But if you are in the viewing for this as a monster/kid-friendly movie, you've got an awesome bid you're looking towards. I say 'kid' with some variance of course, meaning those of age comparable to the actors, but I know some parents would disagree. The kids swear a fair amount, but it's nothing too terrible. And the clincher - the on-screen violence is very minimal. And that's rare enough in movies nowadays.

1399424,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B004EPYZPS,Erik North,"[7, 11]","One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of ""blockbuster"" that has everything you could want, and something more.  And while that is becoming an increasingly rare species in the 21st century, every once in a while it happens.  SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011.Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids.  The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979.  Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman).  The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of it...until the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene.  Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this ""incident"", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate.  The local police, led by Kyle Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why.  Back in 1963, Turman had been a member of the Air Force involved in an Area 51-type of alien encounter, and had tried to help the aliens which had landed on Earth with their spaceship; instead, the Air Force not only dismissed him but tried to destroy any and all traces of his work.  The end result is a film that has plenty of mayhem, both human and alien alike, but ends on a largely hopeful note (even though some may be dissatisfied with that kind of a resolution).By setting the film back in 1979, Abrams bought us back to a world where Blackberrys, Blue Tooths, the Internet, and all other electronic communications devices either didn't exist yet or were merely in the planning stages, hence the presence of CB radios and the kids' use of Super-8 millimeter film for their proposed George Romero-type endeavor (and references, via posters on walls, to DAWN OF THE DEAD).  In many ways, SUPER 8 resembles THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY in that Abrams doesn't make it easy for the audience to figure out everything in one bold plot stroke, though he does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax).  And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic people than the adults.The presence of such great 1979 hits as ""Heart Of Glass"" (by Blondie) and ""My Sharona"" (by the Knack) amidst Michael Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days.  So even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just a blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself, though not slavishly imitative of him.",5,A Solidly Crafted Blockbuster For 2011,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,3649,"['One', 'things', 'make', 'certain', 'summers', 'movies', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'endless', 'stream', 'special', 'effects', 'blockbusters', 'promise', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', 'end', 'seem', 'offer', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'substance', 'sometimes', 'special', 'kind', 'blockbuster', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'species', '21st', 'century', 'once', 'while', 'SUPER', '8', 'writer/director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'who', 'directed', '2009', 'STAR', 'TREK', '2006', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'III', 'certainly', 'one', 'films', 'summer', '2011.Instead', 'going', 'big-name', 'cast', 'Abrams', 'went', 'comparative', 'unknowns', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'young', 'kids', 'film', 'set', 'small', 'Ohio', 'town', 'summer', '1979', 'Several', 'kids', 'including', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'are', 'process', 'making', 'zombie', 'horror', 'flick', 'using', 'Super', '8-millimeter', 'Kodak', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'night', 'witness', 'violent', 'train', 'wreck', 'truck', 'being', 'driven', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Glynn', 'Turman', 'accident', 'caught', 'camera', 'really', 'think', 'nothing', 'Air', 'Force', 'mysteriously', 'seal', 'accident', 'scene', 'Turman', 'kids', 'tell', 'anyone', 'incident', 'parents', 'may', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'too', 'horrible', 'contemplate', 'local', 'police', 'led', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'get', 'precious', 'little', 'cooperation', 'Air', 'Force', 'guys', 'including', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Back', '1963', 'Turman', 'had', 'been', 'member', 'Air', 'Force', 'involved', 'Area', '51-type', 'alien', 'encounter', 'had', 'tried', 'help', 'aliens', 'had', 'landed', 'Earth', 'spaceship', 'instead', 'Air', 'Force', 'not', 'only', 'dismissed', 'tried', 'destroy', 'traces', 'work', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'plenty', 'mayhem', 'human', 'alien', 'alike', 'largely', 'hopeful', 'note', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'kind', 'resolution', 'setting', 'film', 'back', '1979', 'Abrams', 'bought', 'back', 'world', 'where', 'Blackberrys', 'Blue', 'Tooths', 'Internet', 'other', 'electronic', 'communications', 'devices', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', 'were', 'merely', 'planning', 'stages', 'hence', 'presence', 'CB', 'radios', 'kids', 'use', 'Super-8', 'millimeter', 'film', 'proposed', 'George', 'Romero-type', 'endeavor', 'references', 'posters', 'walls', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'many', 'ways', 'SUPER', '8', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'Abrams', ""n't"", 'make', 'easy', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'everything', 'one', 'bold', 'plot', 'stroke', 'utilize', 'several', 'elements', 'mentor', 'films', 'CLOSE', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'KIND', 'E.T.', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'haywire', 'power', 'out', 'aliens', 'presence', 'aliens', 'remain', 'mostly', 'shadow', 'figures', 'climax', 'happens', 'E.T.', 'military', 'law', 'seem', 'be', 'depicted', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'light', 'aliens', 'even', 'mayhem', 'being', 'caused', 'kids', 'including', 'Fanning', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'grown-up', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'adults.The', 'presence', 'such', 'great', '1979', 'hits', 'Heart', 'Glass', 'Blondie', 'Sharona', 'Knack', 'amidst', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'dramatic', 'score', 'give', 'good', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'like', 'back', 'days', 'So', 'even', 'alien', 'story', 'part', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'part-and-parcel', 'special', 'effects', 'blockbusters', 'what', 'Abrams', 'plot', 'SUPER', '8', 'more', 'just', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'worthy', 'comparisons', 'Spielberg', 'not', 'slavishly', 'imitative']",N/A

The film's main characters are developed for the most part, and the coming of age theme fits in nicely with the story. The action and sci-fi elements are there, yes, but they don't take precedent over the characters and the spirit of the film.  As others have stated, Super 8 does have a Stand by Me/ Goonies kind of vibe to it, with a bit of teenage crush thrown in.A group of kids in a rural Ohio town witness a horrific train wreck while they are out filming a scene for a film contest.  One of the boys, Joe, however, notices that a car had also been in on the disaster. The driver of the vehicle, who is badly hurt, has puzzling and ominous warning to the startled children. This message has more meaning as odd supernatural events begin to take place in the area. The military comes in, but there is the sense that all is not right in the small town. Joe's father, Police Chief, begins to look for answers to the odd happenings.One of the things I liked leading up to this film's opening last year was that the trailers held back on revealing major spoilers, which was kind of refreshing in a day and age when we are given too much during previews.

1399438,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B004EPYZPS,G. Denick,"[0, 0]","In Super 8, JJ Abrams was successful in re-creating the feelings that were present in ET, as well as several movies from the era: Childlike wonder for the world, camaraderie among friends, and a drive for adventure. He also nailed the ""period piece"" effort, making this seem like a movie that was ripped right from the late 70s/early 80s, with nothing that I could detect that disrupted the illusion. Meticulous details were covered, and the effort was very impressive. As for the plot itself, I thought it was a fantastic homage to monster movies, sci-fi, and the aforementioned ET, which was obviously a huge inspiration for this movie (although this one is far more violent, just to warn you). I also really appreciated how the creature design had subtle homages to both ET and Cloverfield, Abrams' most famous monster. The CGI is top notch (as to be expected from a Bad Robot production) and not overused, and the monster is cleverly revealed only in brief glimpses throughout until the final showdown, much like the brilliantly doled out Cloverfield beastie. This was a great movie that took me back to the days of my childhood, successfully recapturing those feelings that I got when watching movies like Goonies when I was a kid... and it's a great ""alternative"" Halloween movie for these brisk October nights!",4,A successful love letter to ET and the movies Abrams and I grew up with,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1317,"['Super', '8', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'was', 'successful', 're-creating', 'feelings', 'were', 'present', 'ET', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'movies', 'era', 'Childlike', 'wonder', 'world', 'camaraderie', 'friends', 'drive', 'adventure', 'also', 'nailed', 'period', 'piece', 'effort', 'making', 'seem', 'movie', 'was', 'ripped', 'right', 'late', '70s/early', '80s', 'nothing', 'could', 'detect', 'disrupted', 'illusion', 'Meticulous', 'details', 'were', 'covered', 'effort', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'plot', 'thought', 'was', 'fantastic', 'homage', 'monster', 'movies', 'sci-fi', 'aforementioned', 'ET', 'was', 'obviously', 'huge', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'just', 'warn', 'also', 'really', 'appreciated', 'how', 'creature', 'design', 'had', 'subtle', 'homages', 'ET', 'Cloverfield', 'Abrams', 'most', 'famous', 'monster', 'CGI', 'top', 'notch', 'be', 'expected', 'Bad', 'Robot', 'production', 'not', 'overused', 'monster', 'cleverly', 'revealed', 'only', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'final', 'showdown', 'much', 'brilliantly', 'doled', 'out', 'Cloverfield', 'beastie', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'took', 'back', 'days', 'childhood', 'successfully', 'recapturing', 'feelings', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'Goonies', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'great', 'alternative', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'brisk', 'October', 'nights']",N/A
1399439,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B004EPYZPS,G. Dowling,"[2, 4]","I grew up on the films of Steven Spielberg.  He made me fall in love with the movies and led me to how magical they can be.  Some films are about dark, gritty subject matter, some show us beautiful sunsets, some terrify us...Spielberg sought to take the magical way a child views the world and make it real, and in essence, reminded us as adults, that a little of that magic still lives inside of us.  We still long for that sense of awe and wonder.  Sci-fi (a genre I never have considered myself a fan of) at its best, should inspire an a sense of awe, wonder, and moreover, ...possibility.  ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" took us on a journey like that through the eyes of an ordinary man.  ""E.T."" took us on the same path but through the eyes of a child trying to cope with the pain of his parents' divorce.  It is this very innocent and beautiful glance inward that gives rise to the masterpiece called ""Super 8"".  A summer movie that reminded me how good summer movies used to be before they were taken over by comic book heroes and sequels.""Super 8"", written and directed by JJ Abrams (MI: III, Star Trek, TV's Lost), is the best summer movie I have seen in at least 2 decades.  It is inspired by Spielberg's ouevre, ad it certainly makes sese that Spielberg produced this as well.  Set in the mid-1970s, Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends who set out to make a zombie movie with a Super 8mm camera.  The kids are around 1-14years old, and the pack is led by Joe Lamb (played beautifully by Joel Courtney).  Joe is a smart, senitive and creative kid who recently lost his mother is an accident.  Courtney is an actor to watch especially watching how deftly he imbues Joe with a fresh-faced sensitivity and wisdom beyond his years withou ever once becoming cloying.  Much the same can be said if the other young actors who fill out his group of friends, among them is Alice (played by Elle Fanning of ""The Door in the Floor""), who is a potential love interest for Joe.  One night while filming their zombie flick, a train derails, nearly killing the lot of them.  This sequence makes up the most exciting and spectacular action scenes and bit of special effects of last summer.  It make the train wreck in ""The Fugitive"" look like amateur hour.  It's a sequence that perfectly mixes action, terror, special effects, and performance.  The rest of the film deals with what's in the train and how it affects the town and the characters.  None of which I would dare spoil.""Super 8"" flooded me with such nostalgia...not just of summer movies past, but of American boyhood, endess summers, and the promise of adventure.  Joe and his friends are at the age where they stand on the precipice of believing in magic and leaving it behind for adulthood. The movie is exciting, often very scary, and very moving.  The adult cast is nicely filled out by ""Friday Nigh Lights"" Kyle Chandler as Joe's dad and the town Sherriff, Noah Emmerich (The Walking Dead) as a mysterious military heavy, and Ron Eldard (Deep Impact) as Alice's troubled, alcoholic,and very sad dad.Director JJ Abrams has made a superior thriller that gives us everything we want in our summer movies.  Action, excitement, lots of humor, brilliant special effects by Industrial Light & Magic, but most of all heart and soul.  Abrams has shown himself as an auteur and not just a brilliant action meastro. In a summer over-stuffed with superhero films with bloated $200 budgets, Abrams made his spectacular tale for a relatively thrifty $50 million.  This goes to show that hundreds of millions does not buy a story a heart.  Only an artist cando wht Abrams has done here.  Super * is Oscar-worthy and the best picture of the year.""Super 8"" is presented on Blu-ray in a dazzling and flawless MPEG 4 AVC codec.  The PQ is immaculate.  I could not find a single flaw.  Colors are bright and robust, contrast is spot on and edgs are razor sharp.  All of tis is achieved without any digital tampering such as DNR or edge enhancement.  Fine detail is crystalline in presentation.  Textures are fully realized.  The image looks more like a window we could put our hand into rather than flat 2D.  Also worth mentioning, Abrams refused to film in 3D as he feels the market is over-saturated with this gimmick.  He's right and good for him.The audio is a show-stopper with the first of its kind I have heard at a Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  TrueHD is my favorite audio as it sounds the most realistic.  Surrounds are the most enveloping and chillingly real I have ever hard.  The train derailment is a jaw-drpper.  I felt like I was in the middle of it.  My partner and watchd this sequence 3 times in a row.  It is a sequences which should be playing in all big box stores a it will sell HDTVs and Bluray players in record numbers.  This is why I love this technology.  This is the best audio track I have ever heard.  Completed with crisp, perfect dialogue reproduction...this is the track to top going forward.  This disc is the epitome of reference grade, demo material.The special features are splendid with terrific cast and filmmaker commentaries, awesome featurettes, among others.  Te packasge includes the BD, a SD DVD and digital copy.  Currently as I write this, ""Super 8"" is selling for $19.99.  Buy it now.  Don't bother rentin it.  It also makes a great gift for anyone who loves film...and wants to remmber what summer used to feel like.Rating: A+",5,"""Super 8"" is a new, modern masterpiece.

The only redeeming value was when the 2 parents stopped fighting and started helping each other near the end of the movie.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections",2,once was enough,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,702,"['kind', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'why', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'train', 'crash', 'was', 'spectacular', 'think', 'least', 'one', 'kid', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'accident', 'kids', 'were', 'entertaining', 'most', 'part', 'E.T', 'kind', 'movie', 'Good', 'alien', 'Bad', 'military', 'end', 'alien', 'away', 'kind', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'few', 'times', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'Just', 'different', 'actors', 'different', 'looking', 'alien', 'only', 'redeeming', 'value', 'was', 'when', '2', 'parents', 'stopped', 'fighting', 'started', 'helping', 'other', 'end', 'movie.Visit', 'Amazon', 'Collections', 'see', '4-star', '5-star', 'DVDs', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections']",N/A

1399444,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EPYZPS,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film.  It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher.  It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax.  In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee.  Joel Courtney is outstanding in his role and the supporting cast is excellent.

Yeah? Well this ain't one of those.Spielberg might be the producer but this early work of now noted action Director JJ Abrams is clearly not a part of the warm and fuzzy stable of kids films. Set in what looks like the early 70's some young high schoolers who look like young high schoolers, not 30 some things pretending to be kids, are making a movie for fun. They plan to be on a train platform late at night for  a passing train to be a prop, but as the train crashed and they run off, they begin to realize they may have witnessed something no one was meant to see.The military descends on the town to clean up the mess and paranoia goes through the roof as people disappear and the military is saying nothing. Are they protecting the town or covering their own back sides from their screw up?The problem here is that while the buildup is good and the interaction between the main characters is good, the thing at the heart of it all when seen is sort of not up to the horror they have built up and to be honest the last 2-3 minutes do not hold up.In the end I thought this was ok. This suffered in the theatres because they tried to keep what was going on a big mystery, but all they did was discourage anyone from caring enough to have a look.

1399452,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004EPYZPS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 9]","After weeks and months of speculation, the thing is unveiled. And, it turns out, what SUPER 8 is, is a blast from the past, a nostalgic kick of cinema. And it's good, it's really good. There's a kid in this film who, whenever he thought something was cool, would remark, ""That was mint!"" Well, sir, SUPER 8 was mint.SUPER 8 is set in 1979, in the heartland town of Lillian, Ohio. Four months after the death of his mother at the local steel factory, 12-year-old Joe Lamb and his dad are grieving still, Joe's dad, a Sheriff's Deputy, still so affected that he's become estranged from his son. Joe at least has got his friends to distract him. It's summer now, school in the rearview for a while, and Joe's promised to help out his good chubby buddy (and budding filmmaker) Charles with his 8mm zombie movie, hopefully to be finished in time for an upcoming film festival. Joe builds train models, but he's also handy with monster make-up.Joe is particularly stoked to learn that his dream girl, Alice, will be acting in the picture. Joe and his friends (and Alice) all agree to sneak out at night and shoot scenes at the local train station. But then their little horror film gets upstaged when a military train rumbles by and derails spectacularly. And that's the start of a series of mysterious and frightening events befalling the town of Lillian.Joe Lamb, observant and early on tapped as the prospective protagonist, notes that something has punched thru the steel confines of one of the box cars. Soon after, the town suffers persistent fluctuations in electrical power, dogs are running away, and people are vanishing, as well as automobile parts and various everyday household items. And the U.S. Air Force has come to town, behaving oddly and sweeping the town streets and fiddling with their instruments. In the air wafts the smell of  a military cover-up.In a nod to the paranoid 1950s sci-fi flicks, certain of the townspeople blame the Red Menace. Joe and his friends know better. They've seen stuff, including these weird little cubes. But they were warned, warned by the only other person to have witnessed the train crash (and he actually caused it). If the kids talk, ""they"" will get them... and their parents, too. Except that this is the kind of movie in which the adults are the ones milling around, perplexed, and kids are the only ones who can save the day. I'm all for this kind of movie.This is intentionally a throwback film. And it throws me back to that era, when disco was at its last gasp. When the Walkman was the latest revolutionary leap in music accessibility. When sexy Debbie Harry was doing her thing. When the Three Mile Island disaster was still topical.  When folks said things like ""gnarly."" SUPER 8 will resonate with just about everyone, but even more strongly with those falling in the Generation X bracket. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams has learned well at the master's feet. Much of what's in SUPER 8 evokes classic Spielberg. This story is darker and with a harder, more brutal edge, but somewhere in it you can catch glimpses of E.T. and THE GOONIES. Only, the special effects are much more lavish. Even if Abrams teases you for much of the film by only revealing shadowy bits of the terrifying alien set loose in the tiny town.Abrams constructs a good mystery, and he's excellent with staging the reveals. All of that doesn't impress me as much as how he handles the story's human elements, or, more specifically, how good he is with those scenes showcasing the children. He treats these scenes - which are all a homage to adolescence - with clear affection and humor and perceptiveness. More, he obviously feels a kinship to these kid characters who, just like him at that age, are avid film buffs and amateur filmmakers. Somewhere, in a producer's chair, polishing his Oscars, Spielberg must've been beaming, just beaming. It helps that the two child leads, Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are so terrific. They hit those emotional beats just perfect. I also got love for that firecracker-obsessed pal of theirs who is certainly destined to be a future arsonist. What's less excellent - partly because it's resolved in such a perfunctory manner - is how Joe and his dad's strained relationship is developed. Also, Joe's dad (Kyle Chandler) seems slated to have a bigger role to play in the story. But, it turns out, not so much. And, if you're anticipating a full-on E.T.-type interaction between the kids and the alien, prepare to be thwarted. For the most part, this alien is nothing like E.T. ***SPOILER FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCE ONLY*** SUPER 8 shows what well may have happened to E.T. if the military had gotten its hands on him before Eliott did. SUPER 8 is watchable because the premise hooks you in and Abrams knows storytelling. But, for my money, it elevates to must-see status because these kid actors are so good at their craft and because Abrams does well with evoking a child's natural sense of wonder. It's all mint, baby.And mind that you stay for Charles's completed zombie film (titled ""The Case"") which plays during the closing credits.",5,"J.J.

IMO, this film is one of the very best of 2011 and if you are a fan of ""old-fashioned"" type drama/suspense films that have to do with extra-terrestrial life and what happens to a small rural community in the late 1970's is truly a film that will stay with you long after the movie's end.  To give any more away would be a sin, so I won't.The blu-ray video and audio is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is what appears to be 2.35:1 or thereabouts (Amazon has it wrong at 1.85:1).  The video throughout is pristine with vivid colors in the daylight scenes and ink blacks in the night scenes.  Details are vivid as you would expect from a top-notch blu-ray transfer.  The audio equals the quality of the video and I've had to monitor the volume because I live in an apartment and use a 9.1 speaker configuration.  Vocals came mainly from the center speaker along with the two front speakers that sometimes spilled over to the speakers located in the right and left middle ends of the room.  Music and sounds were extremely active in all the remaining speakers.  This film's sound truly rocked my movie room.I have over a thousand blu-rays and this film is in the top two of all films made and released in 2011.  YES, it is that good!!!I just pre-ordered this from Amazon.com at the price of $24.99 and that's more than I usually pay for a new movie on blu-ray.

Regardless the characters are well drawn and each of them hilarious in their own right.Aside from the awesome characters and wonderful story there are more technical reasons that make this movie great.  J.J. Abrams' ability to use color and a wide angled shots are abilities that are unrivaled in today's film making community.  When watching this movie look at his amazing ability to use the color blue.  He also seems to have an affinity for the Mid-West and that classic American lifestyle from the sixties and seventies.  His ability to showcase and romanticize that lifestyle is also unrivaled.Like ""Star Trek"" J.J. Abrams has showcased his ability to rejuvenate what made the original so good, and while this movie is no remake it almost feels like an homage to ""The Goonies.""

1399468,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004EPYZPS,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 3]","J.J. Abrams, as a creator, has been something of an amalgam. He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure ""Summer"" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements into one big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, ""That was a great film and it will always be a great film"". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.",5,"A New Classic Summer Film, and one of best of 2011.",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,5709,"['J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'been', 'something', 'amalgam', 'more', 'less',

His police officer dad can't relate to him, so he spends lots of time as makeup man on his friends' amateur monster film. Sometimes it's harder to tell which film is more interesting - the fully-formed film about small town loss, young loss, military lies and a terrifying presence, or the choppy, badly-acted (but darling!) film about a bunch of teens trying to become filmmakers.I'm not sure there's much being said about the intersection of the two stories, except in the way they allow the adults and kids to cross paths and resolve old animosities. Very sweet and very smart. You don't get a good look at the film's mysterious presence until well into the film - a salvation for anyone familiar with the genre.

The easiest way to describe this movie is like a cynic's version of &#34;Close Encounters&#34; with a pinch of &#34;The Goonies&#34; thrown in for flavor.  For a movie that tries to combine emotional scenes with some great action set-pieces, Super 8 succeeds.  It's a big-budget blockbuster with a happy ending, but it's at least my opinion that this movie is one of the best of its kind.The story is interesting, even if you change the channel when all of those 'true UFO stories' shows are on.  Sure, stories of aliens, government conspiracies, and small towns helplessly caught in larger problems are nothing new, but telling the story with a cast of younger actors puts a different perspective on this type of sci-fi.  The acting is great.  It seems like those responsible for casting took their time to find actors both young and old who really make every scene shine. It's not just padding between action sequences.  The action and special effects are great.  Real-world and digital effects mix well in this movie, and both complement the other instead of looking fake or helplessly cheesy.This movie may be more mature than it appears on the surface.  If you're a parent, there is cursing, violence, and the alien in the film is pretty creepy for most of the film.  Despite appearing this way you eventually learn that much of the alien's behavior has to do with the manner in which he/she/it was treated- unlike some of the worst sci-fi at least there's a reason for things being the way that they are.  Those with children that are young and/or easily scared may want to look elsewhere.  Be warned, this is one of those movies that's going to try and tug at your heart-strings.  If you dislike films that aim for the 'Spielberg' ending this one is most certainly not for you (kind of hard to avoid since he was the producer after all).Granted, this movie didn't re-invent the wheel as far as movie making or story writing is concerned, but it is highly entertaining.

Simply a great movie to behold.As for the format of Super 8, it certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it. Many have argued that VHS was not available in 1979, but that cannot be verified.

It's the standard-fare government cover-up (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) of the presence of an alien creature we are supposed to both fear and pity. The thing wants to go home (ET but with none of the warmth), and does more stomping and smashing than anything else.The alien finally turns the water tower in Lillian, Ohio into a gigantic magnet which shape-shifts car engines, microwaves, a kid's locket and bikes into a spaceship. With the drama of a donut, the creature climbs aboard and goes home, and there you have it. End of Story.While the kid actors are wonderful, and Spielberg shows again he knows the ways of adolescents well, we don't get to know them as thoroughly as we might hope.Other than the loss of a mom, a pot-smoking dad, dysfunctional family relationships and the conflicts extant between most all parents and kids, there's not a lot else to make us love the little band of Super 8 filmmakers. They are creative to be sure, and we have the expected boy/girl crush thrown in, but other than the scene 'filmed' at the train crash, the kids are not memorable.Also left underdeveloped in plot and unanswered as questions are: why, specifically, is it the dogs who run away? Where is the alien from and why is it really here? Why does it store humans upside down in the hole (they seem to serve no purpose)? Was there a point at all to the lady with the curlers in her hair? Couldn't we develop more rapport between the alien and the kids?In short, the explosions and sparklers are nice, but nothing spectacular anymore. The period music is OK, and disco references, Walkman, and old Kodak cameras are nostalgic. But if you're looking for a fast-paced plot like Raiders, a spectacular conclusion like Close Encounters, or the charm and warmth of ET, you won't find it here. Just some foul-mouthed kids, an estranged alien with an attitude, and some explosions to keep you awake.If this movie is 'memorable', our standard for Saturday afternoon adventure has been significantly lowered.

A group of nerdy middle school kids is focused on creating a zombie movie for a competition when they witness a horrific accident at the train station, but they're not convinced that it was an accident.  When the super 8 film is finally developed a few days later, they know that something bizarre has happened in their town. The inexplicable occurrences start to mount - people and metallic objects gone missing, power disturbances, dogs that have run away, cars that won't operate, etc. In a town meeting, the locals claim that the Soviets are to blame. I had to remember back to that era to be reminded of what a threat Russia was back then !The human plot centers around two kids, both of whom have lost one parent and are struggling to relate to the remaining damaged parent. The monster plot centers around an extra terrestrial being that has apparently gotten stuck on earth and can't find a way back home (remember ET?). The visual and plot references to the monster are rather confusing and conflicted - is it a good monster or a bad monster? Even the glimpses of the monster are brief and incomplete.Eventually the plot all comes together and the loose ends are tied up in a satisfactory way. The special effects are superb, as expected from a Spielberg film, and the acting, given that a bunch of 12-13 year olds are the main characters, is believable.

One is a rather charming film about a group of young film-makers trying to put together a super 8 movie in the late 1970s. Their interaction with each other and with the fathers of the principal boy and girl are well realised and believable, helped along by some excellent performances (I especially liked Joel Courtney's clever differentiation of his delivery when he is acting and when he is 'acting' in the super 8 movie). In the special features director J.J. Abrams refers to his own experiences as a young film-maker and it's clear to see that he is incorporating more than a little of himself in this part of the movie. Four stars for this section of the film.The other movie is a sci-fi flick about a derailed train and what escapes from it. The two stories are linked together (though only just) by the escape having been caught by the super 8 camera, left running when the train derailment causes the young movie-makers to scatter. This part of Abrams' movie is a tribute to Steven Spielberg, who also participated as a producer. It's not nearly as successful, both because almost everything is derived from Spielberg's movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s and also because hardly anything is given any explanation. We're left sitting there pointing out techniques from Close Encounters or E.T., but not knowing why they're being used.

1399500,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004EPYZPS,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[5, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Under producer Spielberg's assumed tutelage and inspiration, director J.J. Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in ""Super 8"". Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of ""The Goonies"", ""War of the Worlds"", and ""E.T."", but not in equal proportions.Abrams handles the ""Goonies"" component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe (home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.The ""War of the Worlds"" component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. Army into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.Unfortunately, the ""E.T."" aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the ""Cloverfield"" monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from ""20 Million Miles to Earth"". And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a picture of Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? ""E.T."" gets shortchanged here.Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time.

But, I am really glad we went to see it.  The movie is really about a government secrete that comes back to bite this town in the ass.  There is a train that is transporting cretin items.  They have to do with something that government got and did in the late 50s early 60s.  These kids are making a movie for some sort of festival.  They are right by some train tracks.  One boy sees a car go on the tracks, in front of the train.  The train crashes and these things are exposed.  One of the boys takes one of the items.  Soon after things in the town start getting weird.  The power keeps blinking out, the animals run away and people start to die and or go missing.  It may sound simple and it actually is.  Which makes the movie so great.The graphics and or 3D effects look amazing.  But the great thing is, they did do it TO many times.  Even the creatures that come to do what they come to do are mysterious.  You do get to see them, BUT, it seems like every time you see one, you only see a part of it, or there is a lot of smoke or something else around to impair your vision of the creature.  They could have over did the things.  Making you see the entire thing over and over and over again.  The fact that they did not, makes the movie even better.  You really get the feeling that your watching a movie from the 70s or 80s when you are watching the film.  It had a very E.T. feel.  Also, the kids in the movie are amazing.  When I looked them up on IMDB, I was shocked at their ages.  Some amazing acting by great actors.  They really made the movie.  When you leave the theater or turn the TV off you will have a lot of answers.  But it may even put a few questions in your mind as well.

1399511,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPYZPS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 4]","Super 8 began last year with a marketing campaign that provided a general idea of what to expect from the film while revealing nothing. As the trailers became only slightly more revealing, the comparisons to Spielberg began. It's no secret that Steven Spielberg produced the film, so this comparison may seem easy but it is an inarguable fact that this film would not exist without his influence. Super 8 is the offspring of films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies but it never feels like a derivative cash-in and actually succeeds in taking moviegoers back to a time when the ""summer blockbuster"" meant something; a time when a good story went hand-in-hand with special effects and action sequences. There are two types of movies here and writer/director J.J. Abrams does a refreshing job balancing them both rather than letting the action overtake the story. Its adolescent characters, military villains, and late 70s, small town setting evoke memories of Spielberg but writer/director J.J. Abrams brings enough originality to the project that it's less of a rehash than a renaissance.The film takes place in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio in 1979. 13-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney in an impressive debut) is helping his group of friends make a Super 8 movie at an old train depot. To the group's enjoyment, the ""director"" Charles (Riley Griffiths) has convinced local girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to drive them to the depot and appear in the movie. As they're shooting, a train appears in the distance and, in moments, is derailed by a pickup truck....And, for the purpose of preserving the surprise element; I'll leave it at that.Is the ""secret"" at the heart of the film really a secret anymore? Most people have enough information to deduce what's going on, but the less you know the better. It's all part of the effect Super 8 has. There are plenty of special effects and action sequences, but Abrams allows his film to build nicely before revealing what he has in store. Unlike most recent summer blockbusters, the action is never brainless; it serves a purpose and functions for the story as opposed to an excuse to show the advancements in technology. The first big special effects sequence is the train crash, which is one of the most intense, exciting sequences you're likely to come across this year. You may question the physics behind it, but you can't deny the heart-racing excitement it inspires nor can you deny the stunning special effects that made it possible.Super 8 really succeeds where most summer movies fail by delivering strong writing, with a good story and well-developed characters in addition to all the action. While Abrams may go for easy emotional cues his story has a lot of heart and Super 8 succeeds extensively on its likable, well-defined characters and human story. The story never feels like a backdrop for the action, a practice Hollywood has inexplicably embraced recently. Abrams obviously has an eye for casting as well. The adolescent actors in the lead roles are a talented, funny, and emotive group that convincingly embody their characters and never seem amateurish or annoying. The adult actors do fine jobs too, but the adults aren't as well-defined as the children are. Joe's dad, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the anguished, withdrawn father who steps in when things get messy while Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is the typical stone-faced military villain. This is a minor flaw that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Finally, it captures the 1979, small-town vibe wonderfully adding a very ""classic feel"" and is a great looking film in general; moody, nostalgic, and, yes, ""Spielbergian.""Super 8 does not disappoint on any level and is what a summer blockbuster should aspire to be. It is consistently entertaining, riveting from start to finish, and a wonderful reminder of the magic that's been missing from the movies. While it may be too soon to make such a bold statement, Super 8 seems destined to become a classic of its genre. J.J. Abrams is forging quite the career. It is impressive enough that he has made a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film for a remarkably low $45 million at a time when the box office is overrun with movies with triple-digit budgets and double-digit IQs. Even more impressive is that he has fashioned a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film that is one of the best films of this year.GRADE: A",5,What the Summer Blockbuster Should Aspire to Be,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,4467,"['Super', '8', 'began', 'last', 'year', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'provided', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'revealing', 'nothing', 'trailers', 'became', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'revealing', 'comparisons', 'Spielberg', 'began', 'secret', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'produced', 'film', 'comparison', 'may', 'seem', 'easy', 'inarguable', 'fact', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'influence', 'Super', '8', 'offspring', 'films', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'E.T.', 'Goonies', 'never', 'derivative', 'cash-in', 'actually', 'taking', 'moviegoers', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'meant', 'something', 'time', 'when', 'good', 'story', 'went', 'hand-in-hand', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'movies', 'here', 'writer/director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'refreshing', 'job', 'balancing', 'rather', 'letting', 'action', 'overtake', 'story', 'adolescent', 'characters', 'military', 'villains', 'late', '70s', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'evoke', 'memories', 'Spielberg', 'writer/director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'enough', 'originality', 'project', 'less', 'rehash', 'renaissance.The', 'film', 'place', 'fictional', 'town', 'Lillian', 'Ohio', '1979', '13-year-old', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'impressive', 'debut', 'helping', 'group', 'friends', 'make', 'Super', '8', 'movie', 'old', 'train', 'depot', 'group', 'enjoyment', 'director', 'Charles', 'Riley', 'Griffiths', 'convinced', 'local', 'girl', 'Alice', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'drive', 'depot', 'appear', 'movie', ""'re"", 'shooting', 'train', 'distance', 'moments', 'derailed', 'pickup', 'truck', '.And', 'purpose', 'preserving', 'surprise', 'element', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'secret', 'heart', 'film', 'really', 'secret', 'anymore', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'enough', 'information', 'deduce', 'what', 'going', 'less', 'know', 'better', 'part', 'effect', 'Super', '8', 'are', 'plenty', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'Abrams', 'film', 'build', 'nicely', 'revealing', 'what', 'store', 'most', 'recent', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'action', 'never', 'brainless', 'purpose', 'functions', 'story', 'opposed', 'excuse', 'show', 'advancements', 'technology', 'first', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'sequence', 'train', 'crash', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'exciting', 'sequences', ""'re"", 'likely', 'come', 'year', 'may', 'question', 'physics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'heart-racing', 'excitement', 'can', 'deny', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'made', '8', 'really', 'where', 'most', 'summer', 'movies', 'fail', 'delivering', 'strong', 'writing', 'good', 'story', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'addition', 'action', 'Abrams', 'may', 'go', 'easy', 'emotional', 'cues', 'story', 'lot', 'heart', 'Super', '8', 'extensively', 'likable', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'human', 'story', 'story', 'never', 'feels', 'backdrop', 'action', 'practice', 'Hollywood', 'inexplicably', 'embraced', 'recently', 'Abrams', 'obviously', 'eye', 'casting', 'as', 'well', 'adolescent', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'talented', 'funny', 'emotive', 'group', 'convincingly', 'embody', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'amateurish', 'annoying', 'adult', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'jobs', 'too', 'adults', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well-defined', 'children', 'are', 'Joe', 'dad', 'Deputy', 'Jackson', 'Lamb', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'anguished', 'withdrawn', 'father', 'who', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'messy', 'Colonel', 'Nelec', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'typical', 'stone-faced', 'military', 'villain', 'minor', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'affect', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'Finally', '1979', 'small-town', 'vibe', 'wonderfully', 'adding', 'very', 'classic', 'feel', 'great', 'looking', 'film', 'general', 'moody', 'nostalgic', 'yes', 'Spielbergian', 'Super', '8', 'not', 'disappoint', 'level', 'what', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'should', 'aspire', 'be', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'riveting', 'start', 'finish', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'magic', 'been', 'missing', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'soon', 'make', 'such', 'bold', 'statement', 'Super', '8', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'genre', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'forging', 'quite', 'career', 'impressive', 'enough', 'made', 'special-effects', 'heavy', 'science-fiction', 'summer', 'film', 'remarkably', 'low', '45', 'million', 'time', 'when', 'box', 'office', 'overrun', 'movies', 'triple-digit', 'budgets', 'double-digit', 'IQs', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'fashioned', 'special-effects', 'heavy', 'science-fiction', 'summer', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year.GRADE']",N/A

Peplinski,"[1, 2]","First off, this movie entertained me far more than I expected it to - well worth the rental fee, particularly in HD as the effects were stunning. Very good acting, and the plot kept us guessing right up until the end. LOVED IT! I have to wonder who this movie is for though? The cast of mostly children gives it a Goonies/ET feel (which is why I wasn't very interested at first) but it seemed to be WAY too scary for actual children that age. These are not cute charming aliens, folks! Very entertaining & enjoyable for me but make sure kids are old enough to handle it before letting them see it.We had a recurring problem with the streaming video. Every time we got close to the 43-min mark, the video stopped and went black & silent. Then it went back to the home screen for the film, where we could click ""Watch"" and it would go all the way back to the beginning. Our internet connection is not immune to dropping a signal, but the fact that it happened multiple times in the exact same spot in the movie makes me believe there was something wrong with the Amazon server. Finally we just forwarded the video all the way past that part (to around the 45 min mark) and it continued until the end without dropping. We missed only about 2 min of the film but having to start it over again three times was pretty irritating.

But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich&eacute;, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clich&eacute;d but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J.

1399527,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B004EPYZPS,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","I have watched probably 30 movies in the past month or so, and this is the first one that has made me want to review it. There is so much junk these days, so many bad stories, repetitious stories, so much bad acting (mostly bad directing), coming of age movies, or deadly B-rated shark attack movies (the new and ""improved"" syfy channel batters us with some of the worst movies, my husband and I watch them because it's actually entertaining making fun of them), paranormal movies that not only do not scare me, but make me cringe they are so terrible (why does the woman ALWAYS scream????), movies where the theme is about dying, but the character either meets the love of their lives or becomes some sort of hero, movies about today's new and improved families (usually pushing one or several of today's interpretation of family and how wonderful they are - I call them preachy movies), lame love stories that usually make me wish I had those 90 minutes of my life back at the end, or so-called comedies, filled with so many bathroom references, it just stops being funny. I've recently been complaining that there aren't enough of the wonderful big movies like Gladiator, Terminator, Independence Day, Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, or any Alien movie or Underworld type movies these days. Batman, Spiderman or any of the comics superheroes seem to be the only ones being produced. (Exception being the Hunger Games movies which are exceptional!)Today, as I was perusing my sad selection of Netflix movies, I noticed this one (Super 8) made by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielburg. I read the blurb about six kids making a movie and catching something supernatural with their Super 8 camera. There are two genres - there is supernatural, and there is sci fi. Sometimes the two intertwine, but honestly, this one fits neatly into the sci fi genre. SPOILER ALERT: you might not actually know that until about 3/4 of the way through the movie, however. So, I almost passed it up, having had my fill of the many, many supernatural movies available these days (most of them pretty bad). But JJ Abrams? I took a chance because for the most part, he is one of today's brightest stars in sci fi genre TV shows and movies.WOW! Maybe because my expectations were so low, I actually loved this movie. It's been a while since I have loved watching a movie like this one. The story centers around six middle school age kids, Joe, Cary, Preston, Charles, Martin and Alice, who want to enter a contest with their movie. They borrow Charles' parents' Super 8 movie camera, as the movie is shot in 1979, just before the DVD movie cameras burst onto the scene. The interaction between these six kids is simply amazing to watch. Instead of being snotty, or over-the-top nerdy, they are played as real kids who, before the age of Nintendo and computer games, still have to amuse themselves with either sports or in this case, the arts. Watching these six together, as they meet after dark at an old-looking train station on the edge of their all-American town, I was drawn in as they set up their scene between Martin and a reluctant Alice. Martin is all geeked out in a suit and old-fashioned looking hat, and Alice just stands there in jeans and a t-shirt waiting to begin. Looking back, somehow, I have to imagine a very young Abrams maybe taking a scene out of his own childhood. These kids are really ready - they have scripts, and they know the on-set jargon, they have a make-up kit, and a nice looking tripod for the camera, we even find out that Charles, as director, has a good set of ear phones. This first scene is practice - and as Martin begins his lines, we watch the absolutely wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice come to life playing a young woman trying to convince her husband (or boyfriend) to stay with her and not leave. It was almost literally the opening of the movie and I was already completely pulled into the story.As they set up for the first ""take"" of the movie and begin filming, Charles sees a real train coming down the track and yells ""PRODUCTION VALUE,"" for the first of several times as he sees (and I'm thinking now, DEFINITELY a blast from Abram's past) a chance for some real cool background (the scene set to the train screaming by). They quickly get all set up and start filming the scene for real. The actual star of the movie (Super 8) is Joe, played very well by a relative newcomer named Joel Courtney (a young actor to watch). As the other five kids are involved in the filming, Joe looks backward for a moment down the track and watches as a truck rolls onto the track and aims straight for the train. He alerts the other five and they watch in horror as the inevitable collision draws near.The ensuing crash was a bit over-the-top spectacular (seriously, I doubt a smallish old truck like that could create the mayhem that followed), but I'm already hooked and loving this moving so I suspend my critical eye right now and watch the spectacle with heart-stopping excitement. Every car on this longish train smashes up in the air, over the little train station, spilling tons of explosions and debris everywhere. We lose Alice as the boys scramble for safety, but in the end, (again suspending reality a bit) all six kids are OK. What they don't realize, but we are privy to see is that the camera rolled, on its side, throughout most of the collision and fireworks. As the kids regroup, slapping each other on the back at not only seeing the spectacle, but living through it, the nefarious military vehicles roll up, causing them to grab their stuff and run.At this point, I'm in! The rest of the movie is a wonderful mix of great action and moments of sweet contemplation, these kids really deserve high praise for their performances (or probably JJ Abrams can get a great performance out of an orange, not sure, and yes, I am a huge fan of his). The story continues to be strong as the secrets are discovered by the children, and eventually the fathers of Joe and Alice (the always wonderful Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard both of whom are among two of today's best but seriously under appreciated actors) who both end up helping them, thus removing the normal - parents are bad, kids know everything theme I see so much these days. I read a review where someone criticized too many longing looks and too much boring dialogue, but I say, if you play too many games or watch too many violent movies, you probably won't like the sweet moments between Joe and Alice, obviously both harboring crushes on each other, or Charles and Joe (as they are watching the movie it took two days to get developed, the scenes taken when the camera was on its side and continued to capture the train wreck), as they quibble over both of them liking Alice.SPOILER ALERT: The end is a bit of a twist, although if you read my caption above, you might have an idea about what happens, but I loved it. I have to add here that the bad language used by the children was a bit unnecessary here and there, and I am a full-out supporter of the military and I'm afraid this movie plays into the X-Files (which I love) military is bad conspiracies and I admit to wishing it could have been an evil corporation as the protagonist instead of our heroes who a lot of people have no idea how much they give up and how hard they work to keep us safe and free (and I admit to being retired military), but I am not one to throw out the baby with the bath water. Despite these fairly minor annoyances of mine, I still gave it five stars. And trust me, had it been anything less than excellent in every way, I would downgrade it one star for the tired old evil military so many Hollywood producers cast as the bad guys these days. JJ, do me a favor, do our military a favor, too? Make one like this again - but make a pharmaceutical company the bad guy. They actually kind of deserve it. JMHO.Despite that, I am just so happy to finally be able to recommend a good sci fi movie to my friends! It's been a long, dry period for those of us who love the genre. If you want a really good movie with some great scary parts, big explosions, sweetness of youth, and parents who love, a very winning mix, and no preaching at you or watching sad death scenes or constant dumb bathroom talk, watch this movie. Super 8 is the best movie I've seen in a long time.",5,"Reminiscent of ET - Finally, Good Sci Fi",1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,8348,"['have', 'watched', 'probably', '30', 'movies', 'past', 'month',

Arguably the most E.T. like movie of all time, Super 8 starts up with a bang and runs through every trick in the ET playbook before the first hour is up, then goes back in again and again to expand on the one thing it knows.  That thing is the essential mystery of childhood and how, once we become adults, we lose our innate understanding of aliens from other planets.  Happily for movie buffs, Super 8 tells the story of six brave kids teetering on the brink of adolescence, and sets the story in the late 1970s so we can all identify, even the middle-aged like me.  E.T. showed us a family led by a mother and father, but Super 8 presents the children at risk because their mothers have been snatched away from them by a cruel factory death.  Reading between the lines, smart viewers will notice that only one mother remains, and she is played by Jessica Tuck, the vampire spokesperson from True Blood--what's that saying about motherhood?  I have no idea, but I'm sure that Steven Spielberg's casting is always saying something pertinent, unlike his scripts.  (Next up, Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis as Abe, and Sally Field, short, sixtyish and moonfaced, as weird Mary Todd.  Everyone's wondering, will Anne Hathaway play Anne Hathaway, Lincoln's first love?)Knowledge is power, summer films say, yet in Super 8 this harmless dictum is severely smashed.  In tracing the fate of the one roll of Super 8 film that accidentally records a horrific train wreck, director JJ Abrams convinces us that somehow this footage, which incidentally shows a monster rising from the wreckage, is going to be important in the denouement.  Like Hitchcock's McGuffins, the footage is presented pictorially as a matter of great consequence, and in addition it becomes a matter about which we the audience know more than the kids on screen.  Lo and behold, absolutely nothing of consequence occurs with this footage and we feel cheated, like children without a mother.  It's a great movie, even with that awful instant nostalgia factor suffusing the whole thing like air freshener.  Aliens with the minds of kids: will Hollywood, will Spielberg, ever abandon this theme?

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 1979 a group of young teenagers is working on an amateur horror film about a zombie infestation. One night they slip out of homes to film a scene which happens on an abandoned railway station. When doing it they witness a terrible train derailment, during which SOMETHING escapes from a kind of an armored wagon... and then the film really begins.Even if this film was directed by J.J. Abrams (which made me suddenly very concerned about the next STAR WARS movie...), it was produced by Steven Spielberg and it is clear from the beginning that &#34;Super 8&#34; is just a mixture of recycled elements from &#34;E.T.&#34;, &#34;Close encounters of the third kind&#34; and &#34;Taken&#34;. It wouldn't be a problem if this mix was well made - but it was NOT!The story is silly and terribly predictable, filled with every possible clich&eacute; in the book. US military and US government are presented as some kind of Nazis. The alien creature is a kind and gentle thing and it kills only bad people, namely those who wear uniforms... A drug using, vulgar slacker (Jeez, what a role model!) is the main ally of children against the bad US government, who not only abuses gentle alien creatures but also routinely murders US citizens. I also couldn't really feel any sympathy for little heroes from &#34;Super 8&#34; - unlike in &#34;E.T.&#34;, far from being nice kids, they are a mixture of boring and annoying brats with deep issues.As many other recent films, this one tries to be a sci-fi film for both adult and young public - just to fail on both counts, as it is too violent and scary for a kid's movie and too childish for a grown-up movie...I hardly mamanged to finish watching it and at the end I was simply relieved that this ordeal was over.

1399569,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004EPYZPS,MadMacs,"[3, 4]","Occasionally, I get challenged by someone about a review that involves a children's movie - as if there were some magical demarkation between that and crap. There isn't. If you can't see that simple fact, then you have my sympathy for having blunt perceptions and an apologist mentality.A good film is a good film - period. There isn't a golf handicap for movies; a special pass for marginal, ineffective or failure.There are numerous fantastic productions that are specifically geared toward children that are simultaneously amazing films. Think about it for a second.'The Goonies', 'Explorers', 'Ratatouille', 'Jumanji', 'Up', 'The Adventures of Tintin', and the list goes on and on and on. And consider budget conscious or sublime productions which sacrifice nothing when it comes to quality storytelling: 'The Sandlot', 'Hope and Glory', 'The Red Balloon', etc.Again, funding isn't the issue. Quality in filmmaking is the key discussion every...single...time.So this question/challenge isn't about my adult perceptions. It's whether or not a film is a winner, middling, or just bites. It's not a fault for pointing out thatThe Emperor Has No Clothes. Why attack the messenger?This amazing and completely engaging film is a perfect example of quality with no discounts for being geared toward younger audiences. Just a flat out enjoyable, fully constructed, and deftly performed production that just happens to be a kid's flick. In the vein of 'E.T.', a movie whose magic of storytelling, childhood adventure and personal sacrifice will hopefully embed itself deep into the hearts of youths everywhere. A hopeful prediction: Thirty years from now and all those new middle-agers will fondly reminisce about Super 8 and how it affected their lives, changed it even. Very much like Star Wars did for many of my generation. Well, a hope anyway.The story opens with a gang of misfit teens and the tragic circumstances that begins a summer that no one will ever forget.It's 1979 and the small town of Lillian, Ohio is about to undergo an unimaginable trauma. Joseph Lamb is one of a quirky group of kids whose big dream is to win an amateur movie contest. But their innocent days end suddenly with the death of Joe's mother at the steel foundry. Now an only child, along with his devastated deputy sheriff father, they struggle to go on without the heart of their lives.Still, as kids will do, they try to forget. Not with malice, but because we all know that children are children for a reason. For them, life goes on. And Joe finds comfort helping his friends with the film project. So it comes as a double shock when he learns that his buddy, the conspicuously boisterous director, has finally found a girl to play the co-starring role in their zombie flick. Shocking, not only because he found a girl, by itself a noteworthy miracle. But because of who she is, or rather, who her father is in relation to Joe himself. He's the man indirectly responsible for his mother's death.But young Joe is insightful enough to understand that Alice wasn't at fault and smartly holds no ill feelings. That she's also the most beautiful girl in school also softens the surprise. So, newly installed as the lone female to the troupe of goofy buds, the gang rolls on, both literally and figuratively as the film becomes their summer adventure. Guerrilla moviemaking, using standing sets without permission, is pretty common for young directors and the gang is no different, taking advantage when and where they can - including an opportunity to film one night at the rail station. But it will be a night like no other.Collectively, they nearly all get killed in the process of accidentally capturing the spectacular train crash near the town limits. Having been so close to the explosive wreck, they're amazed to be alive. They're even more stunned to realize that someone intentionally crashed the millions of pounds of rolling steel stock. Bizarrely - it's someone they know - their school science teacher. And he's still alive.Soon the local authorities like Joe's dad are quickly supplanted by the military. And camouflaged US Air Force personnel carrying assault weapons and various strange gear appear on the scene.Something is terribly wrong.Things quickly spiral as more and more odd events begin to occur. All their dogs go missing. The power grid fluctuates with no explanation. Miles of transmission lines and microwave ovens disappear; even entire car engines are torn out of the bodies of vehicles. Worse yet, there are reports of people who have just vanished. As the town begins to realize these events can't be easily explained away - panic sets in.Yikes.An incredible film - period.Movie Note:- When anyone challenges me to explain great acting - this is now the film I reference. The train sequence, as young Ellie Fanning switches 'on' her character. That is *exactly* what it means to be an actor.Personal Notes:- This was a reward for my hard work. I literally spent a solid year completely avoiding any review, comment or notation regarding this film. Trust me, in this Information Existence, this was no easy task. Quickly clicking off pages or even shutting down browsers to avoid the unavoidable pop-ups and hot links; changing the channel or muting whenever a story or advert hit the screen. For me, a serious endeavor that ate up a good portion of daily mental energy. So that when it finally came time - this was as fresh and clean as the driven snow. Had absolutely no idea what the film was about, who it starred, or even what theme the film could be categorized in. Pure ignorant bliss.

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 5]","You might remember adventure films of your youth, where Middle America kids discovered amazing wonders and defeated great evils that only they could see.  These were the days of E.T., Goonies, and The Monster Squad, where kids laughed, cried, and fought while having adventures.  It's pretty much how adults remember their childhood summers, free of the soul-crushing realities of school, puberty, and adults. If you look back on your misspent youth in the early 80s with nostalgia, then Super 8 is for you.J.J. Abrams has seen those movies, and with papa Spielberg's blessings, wants you to see them too.  Although this film is ostensibly about a child (Joel Courtney as Joe) coming to grips with the death of his mother, it is not for children.  There's swearing, drug use, and violence - pretty much what you would expect from a film set in the early 80s. In fact, despite the lens flares, the out of focus camera work, and the soaring musical score, Super 8 distinguishes itself from other coming-of-age-with-aliens flicks with its unrelenting violence. The alien in Super 8 is big, mean, and angry, and he expresses that anger by eating people.The alien is a stand in for the adult rage that seethes throughout the town of Lillian, Ohio.  It's destroying father and widower Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) from the inside.  It haunts Louis Daniard (Ron Eldard), who was indirectly involved in the accident that killed Joe's mother.  And it is passed on to the children, manifesting with painful eloquence in Louis' daughter Alice (Elle Fanning, bred from a race of superactresses).  When Joe finally confronts the beast, boy and alien finally see each other for who they really are: innocents thrust into bad situations.  Will their tortured legacy define them o r will they rise above it?Heady stuff for a movie, and Abrams' deft movie-making elevates a straightforward plot that might otherwise be lost in the alien-invasion morass.  The film is beautifully shot and, for the most part, tightly scripted.  But once boy and alien face off, the movie loses a lot of its momentum.Lurking throughout the military vs. townies vs. alien conflict is a hope of redemption for both Louis and Jackson.  This redemption is found in a car ride rescue by the parents, who of course don't rescue the kids at all.  Basically, the two guys could have had a beer and come to the same conclusions, but for pacing purposes it happens in a car.And that's where Super 8 isn't quite as successful. The ending struggles to mash the alien's resolution with a father and son reunited, complete with a symbolic locket of motherly love. It feels a bit forced, which detracts from an otherwise pitch perfect tale about filmmaking, death, and meeting girls.With less warmth than E.T. but a better script than Signs, Super 8 is a nostalgia-fueled trip for fans of horror and sci-fi who remember using words like ""mint.""

We have the ""clever-kids-who-know-way-more-than-the-clueless-adults"" of just about every Spielberg movie ever made (ET comes most to mind, for obvious reasons); we have Chief Brody from Jaws (a Sheriff's Deputy this time instead of a Chief of Police, and Lillian, Ohio instead of Amity Island, but you get the idea); we have vehicles driving down a dark, star-covered road in the middle of nowhere when mysteriously all the power goes out (Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, anyone?); we have a baddie/villain/whatever-it-is that we see more and more of as the film progresses (Jaws again); we have dinner-table scenes with kids behaving more wild and out-of-control than any reasonable parent would ever let their kids behave (Close Encounters, again?); and I won't give any spoilers, but suffice to say that the film concludes in a very true-to-form Spielbergian mode.  And let's not forget the 2 inescapable contributions by JJ Abrams -- excessive and intrusive lens flares everywhere you turn (Star Trek?), and the moody (and beautiful) music by Michael Giacchino (L O S T).

The movie started great, with coherent sequence of events that seemed to lead to a masterpiece of art. Soon, the train crash added great action and drama that was quickly dissipated by a slightly injured truck driver who should have been disseminated into unrecognizable parts in regard to the colossal train accident. That was then followed by another miscalculation on the part of the moviemaker of allowing all the kids who were in the center of the collision scene to survive. Some of those characters were irrelevant to the story and their survival did not serve any purpose but showing the unnecessary exaggeration.The movie would have still made it to glorious outcome despite the reckless exaggeration of surviving such upheaval. The underlying causes of the train accident would have made the best movie ever had the story stayed away from the frank display of an extraterrestrial monster. Losing confidence in the judgment of the moviemaker made the science fiction less comforting when the viewers should have been eased into believing in a fictional scenario rather than suspecting foul play on the part of the moviemaking.Many car engines disappeared, many missing dogs and equipments, those were still less unsettling than showing the monster closer to the end of the movie, building underground spaceship and harvesting all metal objects.

Abrams wanted to paint a picture-perfect homage to the former's great classics of the 70's and 80's.  This movie succeeds without qualification.  Set in the late 70's in a small Ohio blue collar town, a youngster tries to overcome the accidental death of his mother.  Joe (Joel Courtney) has a rocky relationship with his father and police deputy played by the always good Kyle Chandler.  Joe and his friends are making a student film using a period icon, the super 8 camera.  During the filming late at night they witness the crash of a train that has not only an unusual cause but mysterious after effects.  The crash itself is a highlight, even though railroad cars shooting into the sky like missiles seems highly unlikely.  Still it is well done.  During the events, Joe also begins a flirtation with comely Alice played with unusual tenderness by Elle Fanning.  Make no mistake this girl can act.  Their budding romance is beautiful to watch and one that most of us adults wish we would have had when we were teeny boppers.  The ""monster"" in the story is kept from view most of the time ala ""Jaws"" but he eventually surfaces and wrecks carnage all over town.  The ending is a bit tidy, but there is no mistaking this well crafted near masterpiece and was the surprise of the summer.In a second viewing I saw the movie in IMAX. Is it worth the extra money?  No.  The film is obviously larger so we see more skin pores and blemishes, but it doesn't add much to the overall scale of the film.  While the film has an extraordinary train crash, and a violent alien creature, the movie is centered on the relationships between kids crashing puberty.  Joel Courtney as Joe and Elle Fanning as the slightly older Alice are terrific.  ""Super 8"" shows that a movie primarily about kids (making a home movie), doesn't have to be a ""kid movie"".  Let Jim Carrey and the Penguins cover that territory.2-11-12:  Blu ray update - The transfer has excellent clarity.  It is crisp and detailed.  Very little grain.  The Dolby TrueHD is spectacular.

I can tell you what Predator looks like.  I can tell you what the Alien from Aliens looks like.  Sooo... what the heck does this thing look like?You can't.  We never get a good enough look at it to figure it out.  For that reason alone this movie sucks.  Period.  End of story.  However, it sucks for many other reasons as well.What the heck is this movie anyway - some sort of mutant offspring of ET, Close Encounters, Cloverfield, and the Goonies?  Oh - except in the Goonies we actually had a group of kids that were likeable.  Not so here.  We get the chunky kid who is directing a Super 8 film - but he is rude, annoying, and entirely unlikeable.  We also have a thin crazy kid who likes fireworks.  He just comes off as a nut who is off his meds.  We also have a couple other young boys, none of which contribute anything to the film other than taking up space.That leaves us with the young male protagonist (I forgot his name) and the young female protagonist (I forgot her name) and their puppy love story - except that we don't get anything from that either.  At least in Goonies there was a kiss.This film follows the adventures of this worthless band of kids while an alien is loose somewhere in their town.  The dumb thing is that the kids really have no impact or relevance to anything that is happening.  What do they accomplish?  Do they help the alien?  No.  Do they hinder the alien?  No.  Do they do anything at all that impacts what the alien is doing?  No.  They have no purpose whatsoever.What is the alien up to?  Well, that is hard to say exactly.  The alien digs himself (?) a cavern under the town's water tower and uses a bunch of local machinery to turn the tower into some sort of giant electro-magnet or something.  Apparently, the point of this exercise was to attract thousands of tiny ""alien looking"" cubes (about the size of Rubik's cubes).  You see - the alien ship was made out of a fancy alien alloy that converts into these little cubes.  One minute the ship has form, the next minute it becomes thousands of little cubes.  The how and why isn't important... just go with it.Ok - so I can live with that.  However, how the cubes are handled must be one of the dumbest moves in the history of alien containment programs.  When the government decides to move the alien cross country in a train, they put all the cubes into crates on the same train.  Why?Then, at the end of the film when the alien is using the magnetic water tower to collect metal and such, where are the cubes?  Parked in a series of trucks across the street!  Wow... it's like the most convenient plot twist in the history of film.  What is the range of the magnetic water tower?  Guess that doesn't matter because the government parked the cubes right across the street!  Lucky break for the alien because then the cubes all fly up into the air and re-create the alien ship - which then takes off like something from The Last Starfighter.To add to my list of gripes - what was the alien trying to accomplish anyway?  If the little cubes had not been parked right across the street from the water tower, what would have been the point?  Let's say that the government had actually done something intelligent and had these cubes in a secret base somewhere for research.  What then?  What was the tower going to accomplish then?  In fact, I'd argue that the only way the plot makes any sense at all is if the alien knew the cubes would be within the range of the tower in the first place.

1399602,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B004EPYZPS,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","A Five Star movie.  Absolutely - however I will be the first to acknowledge that this has it's own unique niche audience, and won't be for everyone.  This is a love letter to the movies of the late 70's and 80's, the movie of Zemeckis, Dante and yes, most of all Spielberg.  For in this feature J.J. Abrams has created a love letter to Spielberg's era of moviemaking, a movie that both celebrates and emulates the styles and tools, the moviemaking grammar, and particularly the tone of movies from that era.It's all that, but still wrapped in a story, one that has a set of familiar elements, but wrapped up in a new enough arrangement.  A bunch of kids in 1979 bond while making home movies with their Super 8 camera.  They are filming one night when they witness a terrible train crash.. but when the dust settles, there is something from the cargo of the train that has been released, and it is about to have a major impact on the town.  Scratch beneath that relatively simple skin though, and you'll find elements of the Goonies (bunch of kids coming of age through shared adventure), Close Encounters (paranoia, alien contact affecting ordinary small town folk), Gremlins (the black humour), and E.T. (adolescents coming of age in damaged families). And if this is an homage to Spielberg, then it's earlier Spielberg - the guns, deaths and occasional mild swear words aren't airbrushed out. It is very much a story first and foremost about real kids, living real lifes, and much less about the fantastic events happening around them.  Yes there is spectacle towards the end, but only as a pay off to the emotional journey of the characters.. if it's just the action or effects you want, you will likely be disappointed.  In fact, if there is any off note in the movie, it is the appearance of cgi - a very modern tool to tell an old fashioned story, and taking you out of the nostalgia trip somewhat. But it's not enough to derail the journey.It's not just the director; the look, the feel of the movie, down through sets, period detail and even the musical score, also celebrate that early 80's feel.  And let's not forget those lead roles - kids who actually come across as real, likeable, believable - the scenes where they have to emote, particularly Elle Fanning, are amazingly genuine, and the relationship between the leads is handled in a delicate way which uses visuals and acting more than it does clunky exposition or awkward dialogue.So yes, it is my own personal 5 stars.. Maybe it's too nostalgic to appeal to today's kids, maybe its too much about kids to appeal to today's adults.  But for me, I am just at that age that when I was young and impressionable it was Spielberg and Dante and the rest that stirred my own passion for movies, that made that first mark, that created those moments that would be my first love of cinema.. and it is precisely that feeling that has been captured and celebrated here.  This is what happens when movies about kids are made by mature filmmakers.  Watching it, I felt like that young wide eyed kid in the cinema again, and it was a glorious feeling.",5,Wonderful homage to the movies of the 70's / 80's,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,3107,"['Five', 'Star', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'unique', 'niche', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'love', 'letter', 'movies', 'late', '70', '80', 'movie', 'Zemeckis', 'Dante', 'yes', 'most', 'Spielberg', 'feature', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'created', 'love', 'letter', 'Spielberg', 'era', 'moviemaking', 'movie', 'celebrates', 'styles', 'tools', 'moviemaking', 'grammar', 'particularly', 'tone', 'movies', 'era.It', 'still', 'wrapped', 'story', 'one', 'set', 'familiar', 'elements', 'wrapped', 'up', 'new', 'enough', 'arrangement', 'bunch', 'kids', '1979', 'bond', 'making', 'home', 'movies', 'Super', '8', 'camera', 'are', 'filming', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'witness', 'terrible', 'train', 'crash..', 'when', 'dust', 'settles', 'something', 'cargo', 'train', 'been', 'released', 'have', 'major', 'impact', 'town', 'Scratch', 'beneath', 'relatively', 'simple', 'skin', ""'ll"", 'find', 'elements', 'Goonies', 'bunch', 'kids', 'coming', 'age', 'shared', 'adventure', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'paranoia', 'alien', 'contact', 'affecting', 'ordinary', 'small', 'town', 'folk', 'Gremlins', 'black', 'humour', 'E.T', 'adolescents', 'coming', 'age', 'damaged', 'families', 'homage', 'Spielberg', 'then', 'earlier', 'Spielberg', 'guns', 'deaths', 'occasional', 'mild', 'swear', 'words', 'are', ""n't"", 'airbrushed', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'first', 'foremost', 'real', 'kids', 'living', 'real', 'lifes', 'much', 'less', 'fantastic', 'events', 'happening', 'Yes', 'spectacle', 'end', 'only', 'pay', 'emotional', 'journey', 'characters..', 'just', 'action', 'effects', 'want', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'off', 'note', 'movie', 'appearance', 'cgi', 'very', 'modern', 'tool', 'tell', 'old', 'fashioned', 'story', 'taking', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'somewhat', 'not', 'enough', 'derail', 'journey.It', 'not', 'just', 'director', 'look', 'feel', 'movie', 'down', 'sets', 'period', 'detail', 'even', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'celebrate', 'early', '80', 'feel', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'lead', 'roles', 'kids', 'who', 'actually', 'come', 'real', 'likeable', 'believable', 'scenes', 'where', 'have', 'emote', 'particularly', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'are', 'amazingly', 'genuine', 'relationship', 'leads', 'handled', 'delicate', 'way', 'visuals', 'acting', 'more', 'clunky', 'exposition', 'awkward', 'dialogue.So', 'yes', 'own', 'personal', '5', 'stars..', 'Maybe', 'too', 'nostalgic', 'appeal', 'today', 'kids', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'kids', 'appeal', 'today', 'adults', 'am', 'just', 'age', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'impressionable', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'Dante', 'rest', 'stirred', 'own', 'passion', 'movies', 'made', 'first', 'mark', 'created', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'love', 'cinema..', 'precisely', 'feeling', 'been', 'captured', 'celebrated', 'here', 'what', 'when', 'movies', 'kids', 'are', 'made', 'mature', 'filmmakers', 'Watching', 'felt', 'young', 'wide', 'eyed', 'kid', 'cinema', 'again', 'was', 'glorious', 'feeling']",N/A

Sort of a mixture of Gremlins, ET, Jurassic Park (lots of Spielberg-style in this movie), the Goonies, Predator, with a little zombie stuff and Dazed and Confused thrown in. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it is very tension driven, not gory (which worked well for the hard-to-please tweens in my house...not kiddies, but not ready for R-ratings.)I would have liked to have seen more of the character development between the boys (even if the action sequences were a little shorter) but that is just my preference and that doesn't fit with the ""summer blockbuster"" type of genre. Still, it seemed to ride the buddy movie/action movie line very very well. I WANTED the protagonists to win...which doesn't always happen for me in some movies. There were also a few little moments of that-doesn't-make-any-sense and corny stuff, but the movie was so enjoyable, you just let the few go.Overall, it was quite good. I remember walking out and thinking ""I wanna see that AGAIN!"" which isn't a frequent response I have to most movies. I often judge movies by the amount of popcorn I have left...if it is gone, it means I was kind of bored/not engaged, but I had half a bag left after this one!!

The train wreck was really good and the special effects were amazing. My big problem was with the kids. I am sure they will grow up and be really great actors. They were written really bad parts for this movie. Why was there so much cussing and bad language by the kids. If you want a family movie be aware that the kids have bad language, are rude and nasty to each other,sneak out of home after midnight, and(while underage) steal cars and drive them. The kids came of annoying and in desperate need of discipline. I hate to sound that way but these kids were behaving in bad ways. They are being a bad example to other kids. Kids today are out of control and movies like this show them that it is ok to act this way. While some adults may just laugh at the way these kids acted in this movie, kids today need to be taught proper ways to behave. I was horrified at how these kids were talking to each other and acting out in public. This would have been easier to take if the actors had been in their late teens, but these kids were around 12 years old. In the late 1970's parents would not have allowed their kids to talk this way to other people and to the parents. Trust me I grew up in a small town in Ohio, where this film is supposed to be set. If you want a movie to watch for family night and want to set a good example for your kids and don't want to have to constantly explain that people shouldn't talk like that or do that, don't watch this movie. 12 year old kids shouldn't be cussing, stealing cars, setting explosives, driving the stolen cars, sneaking out of the house at night, and back talking their parents. This is not cute or funny. It is sad.

1399609,A3009F8SKEDJNP,B004EPYZPS,"Nick Name ""call me Mr. Name""","[0, 0]","Super 8 offered true enjoyment in forms I did not expect. Action, excitement, and otherworldly adventure are stock-in-trade for Spielberg and Abrams, and that expectation is what first drew me to the film. But those elements of the movie quickly became less and less interesting, even a bit burdensome, while other aspects emerged as genuinely engaging, delightful, and moving. Super 8 is a genuinely good and worthwhile film not for the elements one expects from Spielberg and Abrams but from those one does not. I'll be specific. The underlying premise of the film (which I will not reveal) which drives the basic plot and offers a whopping dose of the extraterrestrial unknown, but proves utterly predictable and if visually exciting, conceptually leaden, heavy handed, and, really, just inevitable. The same is true for the movie's themes, which come close to being gaggingly sentimental and simplistic as is often the case with a Spielberg project focusing on young people. But the plot, action, even the special effects really serve as a vehicle for the development of characters: their emotions/perceptions and relationships. In other words, it wasn't what literally happened in the film that grabbed me -- it was the way different characters (as individuals and in relation to each other) experienced those events that made the movie great. Abrams handles his young actors far, far better than Spielberg ever has done and allows them to rise above ""the idea of youth"" that is so deadly and false in Spielberg to become convincing, likeable, fascinating, and endearing people with believable identities. Brilliantly, Abrams has all the main characters experience the main events in individual ways; the main characters grow and change in real time, before our eyes, through the experiences they are having. And as the characters change, real relationships -- which are numerous -- grow and change, too. The performances are wonderfully varied, and all the main performers are terrific. Elle Fanning may be the standout here, leaving far behind the ""look at me; I'm a young actor"" effect that tends to mar her sister's work. All of the young actors skilfully create distinct characters but the viewer never ends up thinking ""this kid can act"" because we believe in their creations. And it is how these young characters experience the events in the movie, not those events, that really grabbed me. There is fear and uncertainty, pain and loss, but it is ultimately the sweetness of finding others that makes this less a thrilling film than a genuinely beautiful one.",5,Unexpected pleasures,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2571,"['Super', '8', 'offered', 'true', 'enjoyment', 'forms', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'Action', 'excitement', 'otherworldly', 'adventure', 'are', 'stock-in-trade', 'Spielberg', 'Abrams', 'expectation', 'what', 'first', 'drew', 'film', 'elements', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'less', 'less', 'interesting', 'even', 'bit', 'burdensome', 'other', 'aspects', 'emerged', 'genuinely', 'engaging', 'delightful', 'moving', 'Super', '8', 'genuinely', 'good', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'not', 'elements', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'Abrams', 'one', 'not', ""'ll"", 'be', 'specific', 'underlying', 'premise', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'basic', 'plot', 'whopping', 'dose', 'extraterrestrial', 'unknown', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'visually', 'exciting', 'conceptually', 'leaden', 'heavy', 'handed', 'really', 'just', 'inevitable', 'same', 'true', 'movie', 'themes', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'gaggingly', 'sentimental', 'simplistic', 'often', 'case', 'Spielberg', 'project', 'focusing', 'young', 'people', 'plot', 'action', 'even', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'serve', 'vehicle', 'development', 'characters', 'emotions/perceptions', 'relationships', 'other', 'words', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'literally', 'happened', 'film', 'grabbed', 'was', 'way', 'different', 'characters', 'individuals', 'relation', 'other', 'experienced', 'events', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'Abrams', 'young', 'actors', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'Spielberg', 'ever', 'done', 'rise', 'idea', 'youth', 'so', 'deadly', 'false', 'Spielberg', 'become', 'convincing', 'likeable', 'fascinating', 'endearing', 'people', 'believable', 'identities', 'Brilliantly', 'Abrams', 'main', 'characters', 'experience', 'main', 'events', 'individual', 'ways', 'main', 'characters', 'grow', 'change', 'real', 'time', 'eyes', 'experiences', 'are', 'having', 'characters', 'change', 'real', 'relationships', 'are', 'numerous', 'grow', 'change', 'too', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'varied', 'main', 'performers', 'are', 'terrific', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'may', 'be', 'standout', 'here', 'leaving', 'far', 'look', ""'m"", 'young', 'actor', 'effect', 'mar', 'sister', 'work', 'young', 'actors', 'skilfully', 'create', 'distinct', 'characters', 'viewer', 'never', 'up', 'thinking', 'kid', 'can', 'act', 'believe', 'creations', 'how', 'young', 'characters', 'experience', 'events', 'movie', 'not', 'events', 'really', 'grabbed', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'pain', 'loss', 'ultimately', 'sweetness', 'finding', 'others', 'less', 'thrilling', 'film', 'genuinely', 'beautiful', 'one']",N/A

If you missed that decade, the ambience provided by the old steel mill town of Weirton, West Virginia may seem implausible and a bit hokey.The plot line is pretty simple, and I admit that it does invite comparison with another of Spielberg's films, namely the blockbuster hit E.T.  The parallels are not so close, however, as to legitimate the suspicion thatSpielberg is just stealing from his past successes and recycling old ideas.  After all, the kids in Super 8 are older, the action scenes are astonishing, viewers are treated to a really cleverly done instance of a film within a film, and we've even got romance.I have no idea where the kid actors came from, but they are very good.  Each in his or her own way is engaging and, for the most part, quite believable.  The kids are at their best when appearing in their own zombie-themed movie, so be sure to watch it along with the closing credits.  It's really interesting to see them portray kid actors making a kid movie -- stilted, stiff, and stammering -- after they've shown us that none of these afflictions of youth and inexperience hamper their performances in Super 8 proper.Glyn Turman does a fine job as Dr. Woodward.  (He's probably best known as the mayor of Baltimore in the HBO series The Wire, and fans of In Treatment will also recognize him.)

While there is a scene that is specifically reminiscent of E.T., this movie is quite a bit different.The alien, for one, actually eats people, and is far from the small, cute, and cuddly alien featured in E.T...also, it doesnt really develop relationships with people. It is seeking a way to ""go home"", as it were, and there is a military quarantine.Anyway, the cast was pretty good, and the interaction between the featured children (of tween age i think) was decent. The premise that they were filming a zombie movie when they end up witnessing a train derail, which ends up freeing the alien, was pretty cool. The local animals fleeing the area (presumably due to the presence of an unnaturally large predator) seemed like something that would actually happen.Where the movie falls flat to me is...the alien is a massive predator, eating people, and destroying a bunch of stuff, but is also cast as a sympathetic character. They try to rationalize this approach by saying that it learned to hate humans after it was initially captured (Roswell), held prisoner, tortured and tested upon by our military scientists. It is able to communicate telepathically through contact (would that be empathically?). Still, it doesnt seem to care about the humans it captures for food, even though they are just ordinary folks with no ties to the military or their scientists. Yet, when the star tween touches him, he suddenly decides not to eat anybody else, and rather focus on finishing his ship and leaving.There is no fond farewell, no conversation outside of a single empathic moment between the tween and the alien. It just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is left to pick up the pieces of a shattered town. Presumably, the gov't would later say a hallucinogenic gas was released into the air accidentally by way of a weather balloon causing the locals to see things as they destroyed their own town (at least, i figure that is how this would play out in real life). The movie though...it just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is happy (outside of those people who were killed by the now seemingly misunderstood alien). To me, the movie was basically a big build up where everybody is scared which then shifts suddenly and tries to become a social consciousness type message about kindness and understanding. Didnt really work for me. No real peak...the movie just kind of flatlined.Had i known before watching this that JJ Abrams was the responsible party, i would probably have skipped this one, since i know better than to trust any project he is involved with.

1399637,A3S4B0BHMN5SEN,B004EPYZPS,PrestonP,"[0, 0]","Where to begin this review without spoiling anything?  The movie opens in a small town in Ohio in 1979 with a boy sitting on a swing; he holds a necklace from his hand.  It is winter and there is a gathering at the house adjacent.  Shortly the audience learns that the funeral of this boy's mother.  Joe Lamb's, the boy played by Joel Courtney, mother died in an accident at the mill.The opening scenes are slow and mildly painful as director JJ Abrams' films usually start at a faster pace, however, this choice allows the audience to connect with the characters like Joe or his father, Jackson Lamb played by Kyle Chandler.  It even allows for the audience to meet all of the characters but one.The main section of the story takes place later when the boys begin to shoot their zombie film.  One scene requires them to drive out to a train depot where they enlist the help of the film's lead and underage actress to drive them.  Alice Dainard's, played by Elle Fanning, father is responsible for the accident that killed Joe's mother and naturally leads to confrontation between her father and Joe's.It is at the train depot that a pickup truck drives onto the tracks and derails a locomotive that the action, special effects, and the already stored emotions for the characters come through to the audience.  Of course there is something inside one of the cars that escapes, the Air Force is dispatched to cover it up and strange things start happening throughout the town.  But all of the finer details will be left spoiler free.Abrams does a brilliant job of getting that small town America feel throughout the film.  But his true achievement is attaching the audience to each unique character.  None of the characters step on each other's archetype and they all have their own reasons for being there.  When the situation really starts the hit the fan, the audience has a feels for the characters and the events surrounding them.It should be noted that Elle Fanning's performance is one that is difficult to come by.  Her onscreen presence captivates and is immediately endeared.  She sells every bit of her act.  Even the film within the film is masterfully executed by Fanning.  If she is not nominated for this film, she most certainly will be in the future.This movie should have been reviewed weeks ago.  Upon the initial viewing it was a 5 out of 5, now it is a solid 4.5 out of 5.  The reason behind the reduction is not a reflection on the greatness of Super 8.  As demonstrated from the glowing review above, it is a great movie.  It is just that all other movies this year (or honestly since Inception) have not stimulated the mind in the way that Super 8 does.  The movie is Abrams' best film and a testament to the early days of Spielberg (producer).",4,Super Summer Film,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2767,"['Where', 'begin', 'review', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'movie', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', '1979', 'boy', 'sitting', 'swing', 'necklace', 'hand', 'winter', 'gathering', 'house', 'adjacent', 'Shortly', 'audience', 'funeral', 'boy', 'mother', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'boy', 'played', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'mother', 'died', 'accident', 'mill.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'slow', 'mildly', 'painful', 'director', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'films', 'usually', 'start', 'faster', 'pace', 'however', 'choice', 'audience', 'connect', 'characters', 'Joe', 'father', 'Jackson', 'Lamb', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'even', 'audience', 'meet', 'characters', 'one.The', 'main', 'section', 'story', 'place', 'later', 'when', 'boys', 'begin', 'shoot', 'zombie', 'film', 'One', 'scene', 'drive', 'out', 'train', 'depot', 'where', 'enlist', 'help', 'film', 'lead', 'underage', 'actress', 'drive', 'Alice', 'Dainard', 'played', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'father', 'responsible', 'accident', 'killed', 'Joe', 'mother', 'naturally', 'confrontation', 'father', ""Joe's.It"", 'train', 'depot', 'pickup', 'truck', 'drives', 'tracks', 'locomotive', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'already', 'stored', 'emotions', 'characters', 'come', 'audience', 'course', 'something', 'one', 'cars', 'Air', 'Force', 'dispatched', 'cover', 'up', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'town', 'finer', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'spoiler', 'free.Abrams', 'brilliant', 'job', 'getting', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'feel', 'film', 'true', 'achievement', 'attaching', 'audience', 'unique', 'character', 'None', 'characters', 'step', 'other', 'archetype', 'have', 'own', 'reasons', 'being', 'there', 'When', 'situation', 'really', 'hit', 'fan', 'audience', 'feels', 'characters', 'events', 'surrounding', 'them.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'performance', 'one', 'difficult', 'come', 'onscreen', 'presence', 'captivates', 'immediately', 'endeared', 'bit', 'act', 'Even', 'film', 'film', 'masterfully', 'executed', 'Fanning', 'not', 'nominated', 'film', 'most', 'certainly', 'will', 'be', 'future.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reviewed', 'weeks', 'ago', 'initial', 'viewing', 'was', '5', '5', 'now', 'solid', '4.5', '5', 'reason', 'reduction', 'not', 'reflection', 'greatness', 'Super', '8', 'demonstrated', 'glowing', 'review', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'other', 'movies', 'year', 'honestly', 'Inception', 'have', 'not', 'stimulated', 'mind', 'way', 'Super', '8', 'movie', 'Abrams', 'best', 'film', 'testament', 'early', 'days', 'Spielberg', 'producer']",N/A

1399664,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B004EPYZPS,Robert Badgley,"[0, 3]","Super 8(released June/11)gives us the one two punch of Steven Spielberg and Hollywood's flavour of the moment,J.J.Abrams.The hype would certainly lead one to believe this is an instant classic,a truly unforgettable cinematic experience,a movie you will see again and again,et al.Well,if you've been around movies along as I have,the hype becomes just that,alot of words/hot air to inflate something up,that may or may not have a pay day in the end.And the hype today is pretty much the same stuff they've been dishing out since the 20s.Does Super 8 have a long half life?Let's see.The plot gives us a group of kids who love to make movies.Each character has their own raison d'etre,as Spielberg and company make each a stand out in their own right,translation:makes them like us ordinary folks.One is a wanna be movie director with a weight problem,one loves to play with matches and explosives,one likes to act but can't,one has a cop for a father and whose mother just passed away,and into this mix is thrown a young girl whose father doesn't get along with the aforesaid cop.One evening finds the group out at a railroad station filming.A train approaches which will make a fine backdrop for their scene,but something startling will happen.One of them notices a pick up come onto the tracks ahead of the train and deliberately run into it.This causes the train to derail,but the train cars start flying through the air like footballs.By now they have abandoned their camera which has fallen sideways onto the platform but continues to film.In the aftermath they look around at the devastation not believing what just happened,let alone the fact they are all still alive.Suddenly the military approach-ith and the kids ski-doo.The kids have all agreed not to discuss their experience,as the military has the crash scene sewn up.Slowly but surely strange things are a-happening.Dogs,people and equipment are disappearing in the town at an alarming rate,with no apparent explanation.One evening the girl of the group gets snatched up and taken away by a large creature.The boys stumble onto some notes a school professor had accrued over a long period of time,which has a direct bearing on what is happening now.The military interrupts their gathering and takes them all by bus back for interrogation.Along the way the creature attacks and tips the bus over.It kills the military men,but the kids escape.In the meantime the military has set a deliberate fire which threatens to engulf the entire town.They evacuate its citizens so they can go on the hunt and recapture this alien.It seems they captured it and its' spaceship years before,but the alien has wanted to go home ever since,and now that it is free this is what it intends to do.The remainders of the group drive back to town in an attempt at rescuing the girl,who has been taken down to an underground cavern.Underground,they indeed find the girl and return to the surface.They are just in time to witness the water tower turn into a giant magnet,drawing objects big and small onto it.The creature goes inside the tower,which immediately converts into an alien craft and away he/she/it goes.Does this film live up to its 'classic' hype?.....not by a million light years.I found this film to be quite a boring time,frankly.The only thing classic about this film are the Spielberg touches,such as the attention to detail in the characterizations I mentioned earlier,getting the experiences of youth/young love,etc.from their perspective,feeling the ultimate empathy for the alien,one man,er boy,standing bravely up to and connecting with said alien,and finally no Spielberg picture would be complete without a resolution of the parent/child conflict at the beginning of the film,at the end,coupled with a tender reunion to enhance it all.Ahhhh.Trouble is,by the time this film wraps up I couldn't have cared less who made up with who or that the creature made it safely away,or any of the touchy feely moments Spielberg tried to engender.And speaking of the wrap up,I was actually surprised the ending,WAS the ending.I was expecting more footage of...I don't know what....anything,I guess.The film also takes its sweet time meandering its way through its somewhat cumbersome plot,introducing us all to its characters and locations which must engender within us that""Oh yeah,I remember that time"",or the old chestnut""Hey Bob,I used to have a house and car just like that"".Yep,that's a Spielberg moment,if ever there was one.Except,this is NOT E.T.,and I mean that in the sense that it doesn't come anywhere close to the quality of that film.And you know while we're on the subject and have Mr Spielberg's attention(he always reads my reviews!),I have just about had it with the portrayal of kids of that age who would NEVER in a million years have talked to each other,let alone their parents,in the fashion they do,without dying a million deaths.He can get the clothes right,the music down pretty good but the precociousness that most of his young characters exhibit,has just got to go,OK Steven?Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its w/s format.There is commentary and two featurettes on the making of the film.All in all a HUGE disappointment.I try not to let the hype into my reviews and/or influence me in any way.In fact I find the more I know,the more skeptical I am about what is to come.I get to a point and become a Missourian...""Show Me"".The hype couldn't save this stinker.The pace and the meandering script are way off the beam and all the tricks Spielberg can muster cannot even save the day here.It's another War of the Worlds(2005).Give it a pass.2 1/2-3 stars.",3,Good as the

1399665,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004EPYZPS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Super 8 (J. J. Abrams, 2011)I'm having some problems figuring out what to say about Super 8, which I watched yesterday and enjoyed a great deal. I think much of the reason for this is that I'm not exactly sure what type of movie it is. On the other hand, it knows exactly what type of movie it is, which leads me to an inversion of my usual problem reviewing certain films. It's part monster movie, following closely on Abrams' success with Cloverfield. It's part homage to 1979, an historical piece that aims to capture an era (and does so almost perfectly as far as the atmosphere goes, and I say this as someone who was just a year or so younger than the principals in the film in 1979). It's part coming-of-age rom-com, and this is probably the movie's strongest facet, as it takes a well-worn plotline, social outcast 1 ropes hot girl into working with his crew in order to seduce her, opening the way for social outcast 2 and hot girl into falling in love, destroying his plan--and gives it new feet. And somehow, despite any number of anachronisms that don't make sense in a movie that supposedly takes place in 1979, Abrams makes it all work.Plot: in a small town in Ohio, a bunch of teenaged kids are trying to make a zombie movie. Director Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths in his screen debut) has a major crush on school hottie Alice Dainard (Because of Winn-Dixie's Elle Fanning), and so reworks the script to give his lead actor, Martin (Alabama Moon's Gabriel Basso), a wife, and asks Alice to be in the film; she agrees. Of course, the entire cast and crew of the movie are equally hot for Alice, including make-up artist and model-builder Joe Lamb (The Between's Joel Courtney), the son of a local deputy. Unfortunately, Joe's father has an unpleasant history with Alice's father Louis (ER's Ron Eldard), which complicates things when the two find themselves getting entangled. While the crew are shooting a pivotal scene at the local train station, they witness--and unintentionally film--a truck, driven by local biology teacher Dr. Woodward (John Dies at the End's Glynn Turman), driving onto the tracks and into the path of an oncoming train, causing the worst derailment in Ohio history. When the authorities arrive to clean it up, they turn out to be military types, led by sadistic tinpot dictator Nelec (Warrior's Noah Emmerich), who immediately crosses paths, and hackles, with Deputy Lamb, who is elevated to acting Sheriff when his boss, Sheriff Pruitt (Edward Scissorhands' Brett Rice), disappears under mysterious circumstances.Honestly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much has been made of the fact that this is not only a love letter to 1979, but is also a love letter to a number of eighties films (notably E.T. and The Goonies), as well as closely mirroring Abrams' own Cloverfield. This is true. And if that bothers you, so be it. I didn't have a problem with it at all; better an homage than yet another Hollywood remake, as far as I'm concerned. Especially when that homage is as well-shot and well-acted as this one is.Much has also been made of the movie's many anachronisms--the two most obvious being mentions of Rubik's Cubes and Walkmen, neither of which was available in America until 1980. Yes, these things jar, and yes, I did shave off a bit of star for them, but the way I see it, this is Abrams' love letter to the time period, rather than something he exhaustively researched, and he wrote it how he remembered it. Should he have gone back and checked that all his cultural references actually made sense given the setting, or maybe changed the year to 1981? Yeah, he probably should have. Am I going to say ""this movie is crap and you shouldn't watch it"" because he didn't, as some of the more vociferous critics on the IMDB boards have? Of course not. That would be like saying ""you shouldn't see The Serpent and the Rainbow because Zakes Mokae is from South Africa, not Haiti."" Ridiculous.You may have to be of a certain age to get the most out of this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, just go with it and you'll have a very good time. *** ",4,Fuzzy nostalgia done right.,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,4100,"['Super', '8', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', '2011', ""'m"", 'having', 'problems', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'say', 'Super', '8', 'watched', 'yesterday', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'deal', 'think', 'much', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'type', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'exactly', 'what', 'type', 'movie', 'inversion', 'usual', 'problem', 'reviewing', 'certain', 'films', 'part', 'monster', 'movie', 'following', 'closely', 'Abrams', 'success', 'Cloverfield', 'part', 'homage', '1979', 'historical', 'piece', 'capture', 'era', 'so', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'as', 'far', 'atmosphere', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'year', 'so', 'younger', 'principals', 'film', '1979', 'part', 'coming-of-age', 'rom-com', 'probably', 'movie', 'strongest', 'facet', 'well-worn', 'plotline', 'social', 'outcast', '1', 'ropes', 'hot', 'girl', 'working', 'crew', 'order', 'seduce', 'opening', 'way', 'social', 'outcast', '2', 'hot', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'destroying', 'plan', 'new', 'feet', 'somehow', 'number', 'anachronisms', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'place', '1979', 'Abrams', 'work.Plot', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'bunch', 'teenaged', 'kids', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Director', 'Charles', 'Kaznyk', 'Riley', 'Griffiths', 'screen', 'debut', 'major', 'crush', 'school', 'hottie', 'Alice', 'Dainard', 'Winn-Dixie', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'so', 'reworks', 'script', 'give', 'lead', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Alabama', 'Moon', 'Gabriel', 'Basso', 'wife', 'Alice', 'be', 'film', 'course', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'movie', 'are', 'equally', 'hot', 'Alice', 'including', 'make-up', 'artist', 'model-builder', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'Between', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'son', 'local', 'deputy', 'Unfortunately', 'Joe', 'father', 'unpleasant', 'history', 'Alice', 'father', 'Louis', 'ER', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'things', 'when', 'two', 'find', 'getting', 'entangled', 'crew', 'are', 'shooting', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'local', 'train', 'station', 'witness', 'unintentionally', 'film', 'truck', 'driven', 'local', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Dr.', 'Woodward', 'John', 'End', 'Glynn', 'Turman', 'driving', 'tracks', 'path', 'oncoming', 'train', 'causing', 'worst', 'derailment', 'Ohio', 'history', 'When', 'authorities', 'arrive', 'clean', 'up', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'military', 'types', 'led', 'sadistic', 'tinpot', 'dictator', 'Nelec', 'Warrior', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'who', 'immediately', 'paths', 'hackles', 'Deputy', 'Lamb', 'who', 'elevated', 'acting', 'Sheriff', 'when', 'boss', 'Sheriff', 'Pruitt', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Brett', 'Rice', 'mysterious', 'circumstances.Honestly', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'letter', '1979', 'also', 'love', 'letter', 'number', 'eighties', 'films', 'notably', 'E.T', 'Goonies', 'as', 'well', 'closely', 'mirroring', 'Abrams', 'own', 'Cloverfield', 'true', 'so', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'better', 'homage', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Especially', 'when', 'homage', 'well-shot', 'well-acted', 'one', 'is.Much', 'also', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'many', 'anachronisms', 'two', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'mentions', 'Rubik', 'Cubes', 'Walkmen', 'neither', 'was', 'available', 'America', '1980', 'Yes', 'things', 'jar', 'yes', 'did', 'shave', 'off', 'bit', 'star', 'way', 'see', 'Abrams', 'love', 'letter', 'time', 'period', 'rather', 'something', 'exhaustively', 'researched', 'wrote', 'how', 'remembered', 'Should', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'checked', 'cultural', 'references', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'given', 'setting', 'maybe', 'changed', 'year', '1981', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'Am', 'going', 'say', 'movie', 'crap', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'more', 'vociferous', 'critics', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'have', 'course', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'Serpent', 'Rainbow', 'Zakes', 'Mokae', 'South', 'Africa', 'not', 'Haiti', 'Ridiculous.You', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'age', 'get', 'most', 'movie', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'just', 'go', ""'ll"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'time', '***']",N/A

1399674,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004EPYZPS,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 18]","**1/2J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - ""Super 8"" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable ""Friday Night Lights"") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.The similarities between ""Super 8"" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, ""E.T."") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like ""E.T."" into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an ""E.T."" and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. ""Super 8"" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game.In addition to ""E.T.,"" there are bits and pieces of ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with ""Super 8."" It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.",2,"Tries hard to recapture an era, but just feels derivative",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2907,"['**1/2J.J', 'Abrams', 'Super', '8', 'back', 'days', 'early', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'co-produced', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'could', 'appeal', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'eye', 'when', 'group', 'intrepid', 'suburban', 'kids', 'could', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'take', 'evil', 'forces', 'when', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'was', 'clearly', 'up', 'good', 'when', 'tear-stained', 'characters', 'could', 'look', 'wide-eyed', 'tight-shot', 'amazement', 'wonders', 'unraveling', 'heavens.Set', 'appropriately', '1979', 'time', 'digital', 'cameras', 'CGI', 'technology', 'when', 'children', 'had', 'express', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'technological', 'equivalent', 'chewing', 'gum', 'baling', 'wire', 'Super', '8', 'centers', 'group', 'nerdish', 'preteens', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'make', 'own', 'amateur', 'zombie-splatter', 'film', 'upcoming', 'contest', 'filming', 'one', 'night', 'kids', 'are', 'witness', 'horrifying', 'freight', 'train', 'crash', 'repercussions', 'go', 'far', 'just', 'mass', 'mangled', 'twisted', 'metal', 'strewn', 'area', 'Air', 'Force', 'taken', 'more', 'casual', 'interest', 'event', 'soon', 'strange', 'inexplicable', 'occurrences', 'begin', 'happening', 'town.The', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'just', 'been', 'killed', 'tragic', 'factory', 'accident', 'grieving', 'father', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'TV', 'incomparable', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'town', 'deputy', 'Joe', 'also', 'crush', 'pretty', 'alluring', 'Alice', 'Dainard', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'who', 'been', 'brought', 'boys', 'film', 'project', 'last', 'moment.The', 'similarities', 'Super', '8', 'number', 'Spielberg', 'least', 'Spielbergian', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'course', 'E.T', 'are', 'so', 'numerous', 'so', 'obvious', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'bear', 'repeating', 'here', 'admire', 'much', 'what', 'Abrams', 'trying', 'do', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'flat', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'final', 'analysis', 'What', 'actually', 'missing', 'special', 'Spielberg', 'touch', 'almost', 'Quixotic', 'visionary', 'conviction', 'could', 'turn', 'even', 'simple', 'work', 'E.T', 'timeless', 'classic', 'One', 'never', 'questions', 'Spielberg', 'belief', 'material', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'quite', 'make', 'same', 'claim', 'Abrams', 'least', 'not', 'particular', 'instance', 'Abrams', 'story', 'streamlined', 'clarity', 'E.T', 'extension', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'along', 'Super', '8', 'be', 'going', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'once', 'up', 'going', 'nowhere', 'frankly', 'sci-fi', 'aspects', 'story', 'feel', 'awfully', 'stale', 'late', 'stage', 'game.In', 'addition', 'E.T.', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Goonies', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Gremlins', 'War', 'Worlds', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'analysis', 'what', 'most', 'wrong', 'Super', '8', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'borrowed', 'parts', 'end', 'left', 'nothing', 'can', 'truly', 'call', 'own']",N/A

1399684,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B004EPYZPS,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[0, 1]","It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.My Impressions:The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on!We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted ""production value"" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.Favorite Scenes:Father's Faith:Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother ""should have"" taken her father.The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.Amateur Horror Film:During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch!I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.Music!The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.Hackneyed Themes:Yes there were some ""I've seen this before"" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.

1399685,A16J5IIA94TJOB,B004EPYZPS,Scott Dorn,"[1, 4]","If you just like special effects and little else you may enjoy this hodgepodge of a film. I remember Spielberg reminiscing on a TCM special about ""Epic Films"", how he was influenced as a kid by Cecil B. DeMille's train wreck sequence in the film, ""The Greatest Show On Earth"". It's redone  here and it's even more spectacular, but it would have benefited greatly if there had been some suspense leading up to it! After that scene, the film deteriorates into every mediocre Sci-Fi film of the Fifties, except with much bigger special effects. The ending is much like ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", but without any of the charm of those films, or really making much sense! In fact the whole film borrows heavily on the ""E.T."" theme of the misunderstood, but in this case, brutally tortured alien, just wanting to go home. The ending, despite all of the visual effects, is actually a little cheesy, although we're supposed to feel awe inspired.The whole movie is disjointed and it really pains me to write such a bad review for any film that Spielberg is associated with, but the film leaves the viewer with way too many unanswered questions, and it's really a huge letdown in almost every department!

But knowing that was the formula that JJ Abrams used forCloverfield, my expectations were set for that...and my expectations where met. At least the Cloverfield hand held camera part of the formula was dropped for Super 8.On the other hand, I'm a big fan of a well written and well acted story. While Super 8 was full of moments that were simply not believable, the story flow and the amusing but accurate capture of how a group of middle schoolers interact with each other saved Super 8 from 2 star land.My kids loved Super 8. Although I'd hesitate to call it a great 'family' film simply based on some of the mature material and language. It's actually refreshing to see the MPAA take a more lax approach to language with a PG-13 instead of an R. I suppose having Steven Spielberg on board as producer may have had some pull.Basically a bunch of kids in a remote town are witness to a military train crash. Unfortunately one of the passengers on the train really wants to go home but that's not where the train was taking him...er...I mean...It. But when the train crashes this 'dark' passenger has a chance to escape and the kids do a better job of tracking down the escaped passenger than the most qualified government agency ever could. Now there's a formula that never seems to get old in Hollywood, right?...Smart civilians and kids outwit the dumb old police and military.

1399696,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B004EPYZPS,S. Morales,"[2, 3]","A vastly overrated outing from both overrated director J.J. Abrams and has-been Steven Spielberg, this film has gotten about 95% of its success on those two names alone. Therefore, for the sake of a non-bias review for yourself, simply forget (as hard as it may be for the average American), FORGET that this movie has any connection whatsoever with J.J. and Ol' Steve. Take the film for its own right, and you'll see that this is perhaps the most overrated film of 2011. If you remember the teaser trailers leading up to its release, you'd say they were vastly vague, and revealed almost nothing except for creepy music and a lot of darkness. There is a reason for this, it was an attempt to create a buzz for this film because the filmmakers knew they had nothing to really work with. Any other type of trailer would've simply revealed every details about the movie in a matter of 2 minutes. Because, honestly, that's all the time you need to reveal every plot device this film actually offers.The film stars a group of no-name teenage actors who are growing up in the late 1970's, they all are in the middle of creating a low-budget zombie film when a train station scene changes their lives (at least for a few days), when they witness and come head on with a giant train crash, holding an alien that the military is trying to keep under wraps. The teens escape with this knowledge and are then pursued by said military... the film basically delves into a continuous desperate attempt to try and create characters who we really never end up truly caring about, and a plot that drones on, stretching for suspense but never achieving any of it. Later on after a semi-climactic (not really) final scene, the aliens escape and we really never get to know what happens to all the kids as the movie just ends.The biggest problem with this film is that J.J. and Spielberg try to take various elements that would equate to a heart-warming movie - middle schoolers, puppy love, a simpler time and generation (1979), quiet mid-western town, etc - and try to toss in a strange antagonist (aliens) to mix things up, but never actually using any of these attributes to do anything worthwhile. What Spielberg and J.J. seem to forget is that these elements alone will not create an enjoyable film, you need a good script to do that, not to also mention better actors. In other words, while it was cute to get no-name teenage actors to feel more realistic instead of hiring Lindsay Lohan and the cast of High School Musical, they don't put on performances that really break any ground. They play their parts well enough, but never hold any chemistry or magic, many times when even given the opportunity simply act as wooden slabs, displaying forced puppy love crushes and social tension. It just never works, it's hardly ever believable. Sure they're cute and the ""pretty girl"" definitely can pull of the ""mystery girl with a heart-melting smile"" well, these things are all ruined by forced monologues of things that are never touched upon in any way during the film except for the part when the kids are just TELLING us. An example being one drawn out monologue with said pretty girl going on about some memory of her childhood while watching a film in a dark room with the kid who's going ga-ga over her... her forced tears don't fool anyone, I don't care what Spielberg says in the featurettes, it's boring and useless, does nothing to enhance her character or do we see any of these elements of what she's actually TALKING ABOUT during her monologue as all these kids (except for the main protagonist boy) don't even seem to have any parents! To put it another way, don't have a character talk about things in her life she does or does not like, have her cry over it, stretch to make it dramatic (even though it isn't because her character isn't built up well enough prior for us to care), and then NOT have these things she's talking about be seen in any way whatsoever throughout the movie.Another minus being the military/airforce/whatever who is trying to keep the Area 51 alien under wraps. Of course they fail, but even though the aliens themselves are supposed to be the the villains, so are the military. The issue here is that the aliens do not make themselves well known enough for us to be scared of them, dislike them, or desire to see them die for being the villains - they just aren't written in the film well enough at all except for just a few scenes of ""rarr! be scared! I'm the alien! The bad guy in the movie! rarrr!!"" Sorry, but that just isn't enough. Moreover, the military/airforce guys are too nice. They don't do anything that makes us dislike them or see any reason whatsoever why we should even be rooting for these obnoxious kids. Hence, we don't. So there really don't feel to be any ""bad guys"" in the film.To just make one last point, the time era the film takes place in also is near unbelievable. Sure it's 1979, and things aren't THAT much different than they are now, given a suburb, but the point just isn't made well enough, and I can't tell whether it's because of bad props or just not enough atmosphere helping me to really believe this really is 1979. A film like ""Born on the Fourth of July"" with Tom Cruise from the late 80s made the 60's FEEL like the 60's, as does the recent hit ""The Help,"" as well as ""Forest Gump."" These films highlight their time era, thus making it more believable, and in a way making the characters more genuine and likable. What only adds to this problem is the way the kids in the movie speak. They don't SPEAK like kids who grew up in the 1970s, or act correctly in terms of body language; rather, they speak way too modern, all carry a sort of sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek attitude you'd expect from a kid growing up in the 2000's. Obviously Abrams is too young to even know how children acted in the 70s. Perhaps Spielberg could've written or directed a bit of this film, at least he has some experience during this time as it was when he created some of his most classic films.Spielberg and Abrams like to boast about how this film is done to pay ""homage"" to old sci-fi thrillers of the past. Besides E.T., I honestly don't think anyone really cares. I mean, who has even seen these old 50's movies besides die-hard movie buffs themselves who are forking over about 1% of all this film's earnings? You want to pay homage? Fine. But at the very least make a GOOD movie with a GOOD script.Anyway, aside from the lack of characterization, the plot goes nowhere as the military scenes involving the guys trying to cover the whole thing up are never interesting, and there are never any plot twists among any of the characters, but things just play out exactly as you'd expect them to throughout the movie. The ending just, well, ends. I actually remember fighting to not fall asleep during the the last half hour of the film.One reviewer states that this feels more like a big-budget Disney film, which is very true. This movie seems to want to impress adults by incorporating ""childhood charm,"" but does none of it, especially not with that dumb alien storyline always getting in the way. This movie simply feels like a big-budget film that could've just been premiered on Disney XD. This one may have been intended for all ages, but adults simply won't feel any charm whatsoever, and neither will teenagers, although they may enjoy seeing peers their age argue, sometimes. Maybe, but I'm just chancing it.Spielberg has not made a decent film in years. Minority Report, though containing a great story and special effects, lacked good direction. There weren't very many thrilling scenes throughout it. Although it still worked mostly because it contained a good story. J.J. Abrams has got to be the most overrated director alive today, and only seems to do well simply because American audiences fall so easily for big-budget films with very little substance. While Star Trek made a good film, it did contain a good number of flaws, namely, a lame and boring enemy.... which is the same we get in Super 8. J.J. also can get a good word in by legendary directors, thus people simply fork up the money and say they enjoyed the film because they can't see past a special effects show with substandard characterization and a predictable script.While Super 8 wasn't terrible, it was definitely overrated, and just comes off as your average run-of-the-mill alien flick starring some kids who you won't ever remember again. The campaign for this film did lots to draw people in, considering all the mysterious teaser trailers that made this film almost feel like the most mysterious and epic alien-lands-on-earth film ever. It would be nice to actually, then, you know, make the aliens have some REAL interaction. I'd say rent, don't buy.Technical Stuff:On a technical level, the Blu-ray disc looks great, the movie is sharp and sound is top-notch. The train crash scene (being the only worthwhile thing in the film, and the most exploited as it seems to be the only thing that drew people in) boasts of great bombastic sound and sharp picture, and beautiful explosions. The special features take are all filmed in HD, and take you into behind-the-scenes footage of making the film. Unfortunately, we can only take so much, as much of this is simply overkill. I don't need to see every waking moment of what people did and talked about while they were making the movie. Especially if it was a movie I didn't much even care for. The only films that can get away with this type of footage are ones where you REALLY want to know what went on... such as, let's say, Lord of the Rings.",3,An Amazing Train Crash Scene. ...That's

At first I thought it has the potential to become a cult film, like the two mentioned. As the movie follows a group of teenagers, while making a film they watch a train derail and strange things start to happen.  The alien does not show up until the last part of the movie.  The alien fights and eats people.  While it is not a horror movie, the movie does show people getting crushed and blood splattering (warning for parents with younger kids) and this is the reason I am not sure about it becoming a cult movie.  Adults looking for a good alien movie will most likely be disappointed.  Again this is more like ET or Goonies with a darker twist and more blood, but not a bad movie.

Luckily, this movie meets those high expectations. This is one movie you should not miss. This movie will surely draw comparisons to ET and other movies but this movie can stand by itself. This movie is for a new generation so the thinking will be different. The acting in this movie is very good. The actors portray their characters perfectly and it looks as if all the actors are completely comfortable in their roles. I wish the acting from the children was a little better but it is passable. It is great to see how they view the world and comprehend all of the events. The directing from J.J. Abrams is great. He makes the movie flow nicely and doesn't rush any parts. Some scenes may be a little overplayed but it doesn't take away from the film. The story is not predictable with the exception of the ending. The story does include a few cliches. The story is, overall, well-written. The dialogue is also well-written. It does not feel like it was written by a 13 year old unlike some other movies. The action is great and well-directed. The action scenes are intense and the derailing train scene is great! The film has a nice pace to it so that it doesn't feel rushed or too slow. One problem I have with the movie is the ending. It is not very good and a little cheesy. Another thing is that I would love to know more about some characters. It would've helped the movie and I feel like we don't know enough about Alice's father. Overall, I recommend that you see this film and form your own opinion. Just make sure that you do not know too much before going in. Super 8 is a great summmer flick with a good story.

1399704,A23W55M32D2AC,B004EPYZPS,"Stephen Ashley ""Author of Walt Disney World w...","[32, 43]","I keep seeing this compared to Goonies & ET. It's got it's similarities but it differs radically, and these differences may mean that it's not a good movie choice for kids. I'll explain below, plus here's the pros and cons of this movie:Pros:1. The acting is phenomenal. The kids are just amazing. Each of them was absolutely believable and brought depth to their characters. I could totally relate to several of the kids. The adults were good as well, but they really weren't featured and developed enough to make a huge difference.2. The production value was amazing. What else would you expect from a Speilberg movie! The action sequences were riveting.3. The 1979 setting was very authentic and fun. Since I was around in that time period, it was great to see.4. The relationships between the kids were so well developed, and the main kids individual characters were beautifully written for and developed. This was what made the movie worthwhile.5. As in Goonies and ET, the kids are the heroes in this movie. They're the ones who know the truth and act on it for good. They're pure of heart, resourceful, determined and put themselves at risk to act like heroes.Cons:1. This had a horror movie feel. There was plenty of violence, and it was scary. This movie is not for young kids. Those who don't like horror should avoid this movie. Granted most of it wasn't explicitly gory, but there was some blood and plenty of people died violently. There are many moments designed to shock, startle and scare you. Though it's rated PG-13, I'd say it feels closer to an R rating to me.2. If you're looking for a feel good alien like in ET, it's not here. The audience is not given much of a chance to emotionally connect with the alien. It's ugly, scary, violent and mysterious. I don't want to give anything away, but this is not a feel good, cuddle the alien, cute movie similar to ET. You may still enjoy this flick, but go in with the right expectations.3. There are tons of holes in the movie. There are many questions that are never answered, and a couple featured characters that are never fully explained. I don't always mind holes in movie lines if the movie is entertaining, but in this movie it was hard to ignore.4. The story line just wasn't that original. Take a bunch of different movies, put them in a jug and shake them together and you get this movie. I don't always mind a repeated story line if it's entertaining or moving, but this was just okay for me.So I'd say that if you like horror, this movie may be for you, though you may be disappointed with the lack of explicit gore. If you like scifi, this movie may be somewhat satisfying, but it probably won't be in your top 20. If you like coming of age movies, you'll love the story lines around the kids. If you love special effects, there are some good ones here. This movie is definitely not for young kids or for anyone who shouldn't be viewing horror.I'd say this is a video to rent on DVD.

They are both sensitive--having lost their mothers.During a nighttime film shoot, a train is derailed, when it hits a truck that goes on the tracks, and explosions and intrigue ensue, with the Air Force soon appearing. Gradually (a bit too much so), we learn why dogs are running off to the next county, why people are vanishing, and why microwave ovens are missing.I liked the solid acting by the youthful cast, especially by Fanning and Courtney, who establish a very moving relationship with each other.Overall, this film held my interest fairly well and jolted me a few times as I munched on some popcorn.

1399709,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B004EPYZPS,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[16, 19]","Every now and then, a film comes along and reminds you of the way it used to be. Back in the eighties, blockbusters were made with heart. Everything from the acting to the direction was top-notch, especially if the film in question was a Spielberg film. Steven Spielberg is one of the best film directors in the industry. His love of the medium shines in just about every project that he has been a part of. Some of the most influential films of the past have his name attached to them, namely E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jurassic Park. He deals with fantastical themes with a heartfelt, childlike curiosity - a definite trademark that appears in many of his films. Recently, director J.J. Abrams made a film which can be seen as a love letter to Spielberg. This film is `Super 8', and it is one of the best offerings of the summer, as well as one of the best films of the year. And, for those of you who have followed me over the past two years, the mere fact that I am glowing over a mainstream blockbuster is nothing short of a miracle.The film opens in Lillian, Ohio in 1979, and follows a group of close-knit boys during summer break, as they attempt to film a zombie flick with a Super 8 camera. Young Joe Lamb has recently lost his mother in a steel mill accident, and as a way to cope with his loss, he vows to help his best friend, the film-obsessed Charles, complete his latest cinematic masterpiece. Together with three other boys, and his latest crush, Alice, Joe slowly begins a journey of self-discovery. Everything changes one night during a film shoot, when the boys witness, and barely manage to escape, a horrific train wreck. The kids flee the site, as the U.S. Air Force arrives.This leads to strange phenomena in the town; pets running away from their owners, the disappearance of car engines and power lines, and people being abducted. Soon after, the boys discover some disturbing footage which was caught during the train crash, while the camera was still rolling film. Something crawls up out the wreckage, and dashes out of the frame. The boys decide to delve into the mystery themselves, and the adventure begins.The performances in this film are amazing, especially from newcomer Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. Each delivers an incredibly genuine performance, and I was blown away by the raw energy displayed on screen. The direction is perfect, with splashes of J.J. Abrams idol, Spielberg, splashed about the screen in nearly every frame. The musical score is magical. The mystery is involving. It all makes for an excellent time at the theatre, and will make you long for the days when summer blockbusters had a soul. With strong messages of hope and forgiveness, it is also one of the most touching films to come out in a while.Super 8 is rated PG-13, and is 112 minutes.",4,'Super 8' is an excellent homage to Spielberg!,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2840,"['now', 'then', 'film', 'along', 'way', 'used', 'be', 'Back', 'eighties', 'blockbusters', 'were', 'made', 'heart', 'Everything', 'acting', 'direction', 'was', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'film', 'question', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'directors', 'industry', 'love', 'medium', 'shines', 'just', 'project', 'been', 'part', 'most', 'influential', 'films', 'past', 'have', 'name', 'attached', 'namely', 'E.T.', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'fantastical', 'themes', 'heartfelt', 'childlike', 'curiosity', 'definite', 'trademark', 'many', 'films', 'Recently', 'director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'made', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'love', 'letter', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Super', '8', 'one', 'best', 'offerings', 'summer', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'mere', 'fact', 'am', 'glowing', 'mainstream', 'blockbuster', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle.The', 'film', 'Lillian', 'Ohio', '1979', 'group', 'close-knit', 'boys', 'summer', 'break', 'attempt', 'film', 'zombie', 'flick', 'Super', '8', 'camera', 'Young', 'Joe', 'Lamb', 'recently', 'lost', 'mother', 'steel', 'mill', 'accident', 'way', 'cope', 'loss', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'film-obsessed', 'Charles', 'complete', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Together', 'three', 'other', 'boys', 'latest', 'crush', 'Alice', 'Joe', 'slowly', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Everything', 'changes', 'one', 'night', 'film', 'shoot', 'when', 'boys', 'witness', 'barely', 'manage', 'escape', 'horrific', 'train', 'wreck', 'kids', 'flee', 'site', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'arrives.This', 'strange', 'phenomena', 'town', 'pets', 'running', 'away', 'owners', 'disappearance', 'car', 'engines', 'power', 'lines', 'people', 'being', 'abducted', 'Soon', 'boys', 'discover', 'disturbing', 'footage', 'was', 'caught', 'train', 'crash', 'camera', 'was', 'still', 'rolling', 'film', 'Something', 'up', 'wreckage', 'frame', 'boys', 'decide', 'delve', 'mystery', 'adventure', 'begins.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'amazing', 'especially', 'newcomer', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'Riley', 'Griffiths', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'delivers', 'incredibly', 'genuine', 'performance', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'raw', 'energy', 'displayed', 'screen', 'direction', 'perfect', 'splashes', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'idol', 'Spielberg', 'splashed', 'screen', 'nearly', 'frame', 'musical', 'score', 'magical', 'mystery', 'involving', 'excellent', 'time', 'theatre', 'will', 'make', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'had', 'soul', 'strong', 'messages', 'hope', 'forgiveness', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'while.Super', '8', 'rated', 'PG-13', '112', 'minutes']",N/A

The main characters are children and we are given enough information to identify with them. Even if we weren't like any of them ourselves, we almost certainly went to school with similar children.The movie feels like a combination of Stand by Me and some of the best Steven Spielberg stories, such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The story feels like it could have been written by Stephen King and contains a slice of small-town America, combined with a fantasy element.The opening scene mentions an accident at a steel mill in which Elizabeth Lamb is killed. Her husband, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is a deputy, and her son, Joe (Joel Courtney), is helping his friends make a movie. We spend a lot of time with these children and events are seen from their viewpoint. The group enlists Alice (Elle Fanning) to play a role in their movie and she impresses them with her superior acting ability. Joe starts to develop feelings for her and it's this relationship which drives the story.One of the most memorable scenes comes early in the movie. While the kids are filming, a train approaches. Charles (Riley Griffiths), who is the director, wants to shoot a scene while the train is passing. A truck drives onto the tracks in front of the train and causes a massive accident. The scene is spectacular and will rock your home theater. After surviving the accident, the kids notice a carriage on its side and something is pounding on the walls from within.That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story. Courtney and Fanning give strong performances and their developing friendship is believable. Alice's father is a source of conflict and Joe's father has a role to play in the safety of the town. Part of the fun is watching events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. What is causing these things to happen? Why are people and animals disappearing?Super 8 evokes a special feeling. It's partly nostalgia as we remember friendships in our childhood, and the movie feels as if it belongs in the 70s or early 80s. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is now and there is a closeness between the people in the town that is rare to see in today's world. The friendship between the children makes everything work and it feels authentic.Although the early part of the movie relies on special effects, there is a real story here with a little depth. If you like Spielberg's classic movies, you'll probably enjoy what Abrams has done. If you were wondering whether Abrams includes lens flares like he did in Star Trek, they are present throughout the movie.",4,Feels like Spielberg and Stephen King,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,3000,"['Video', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '2.40:1Audio', 'English', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '7.1French', 'Portuguese', 'Spanish', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Portuguese', 'Spanish.Discs:50GB', 'Blu-ray', 'DiscDVD', 'copyDigital', 'copy', 'disc', 'BD-LiveD-BoxPlayback', 'Region', 'listed', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'Super', '8', 'ideal', 'family', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'children', 'are', 'given', 'enough', 'information', 'identify', 'Even', 'were', ""n't"", 'like', 'almost', 'certainly', 'went', 'school', 'similar', 'children.The', 'movie', 'feels', 'combination', 'Stand', 'Me', 'best', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'stories', 'such', 'E.T', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'story', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'slice', 'small-town', 'America', 'combined', 'fantasy', 'element.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'mentions', 'accident', 'steel', 'mill', 'Elizabeth', 'Lamb', 'killed', 'husband', 'Jackson', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'deputy', 'son', 'Joe', 'Joel', 'Courtney', 'helping', 'friends', 'make', 'movie', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'children', 'events', 'are', 'seen', 'viewpoint', 'group', 'Alice', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'play', 'role', 'movie', 'superior', 'acting', 'ability', 'Joe', 'develop', 'feelings', 'relationship', 'story.One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', 'filming', 'train', 'approaches', 'Charles', 'Riley', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'director', 'shoot', 'scene', 'train', 'passing', 'truck', 'tracks', 'front', 'train', 'massive', 'accident', 'scene', 'spectacular', 'will', 'rock', 'home', 'theater', 'surviving', 'accident', 'kids', 'notice', 'carriage', 'side', 'something', 'pounding', 'walls', 'setup', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'ruin', 'things', 'giving', 'away', 'more', 'story', 'Courtney', 'Fanning', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'developing', 'friendship', 'believable', 'Alice', 'father', 'source', 'conflict', 'Joe', 'father', 'role', 'play', 'safety', 'town', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'events', 'unfold', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'What', 'causing', 'things', 'happen', 'Why', 'are', 'people', 'animals', 'disappearing', 'Super', '8', 'special', 'feeling', 'partly', 'nostalgia', 'remember', 'friendships', 'childhood', 'movie', 'feels', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'Technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'advanced', 'now', 'closeness', 'people', 'town', 'rare', 'see', 'today', 'world', 'friendship', 'children', 'everything', 'work', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'little', 'depth', 'like', 'Spielberg', 'classic', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'what', 'Abrams', 'done', 'were', 'wondering', 'Abrams', 'lens', 'flares', 'did', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'present', 'movie']",N/A

Let me just tell you right now, you don't want your arm laying around in it. Fortunately, because we went to a late showing several weeks post release, the theater wasn't very crowded, so there weren't many witnesses to take care of.My first reaction to Super 8 was very positive. There's a good story there. An actual story about real people. So here's the warning: there will be spoilers. I want to actually talk about this movie and J. J. Abrams, and I don't want to try to do it while dodging around trying not to give anything away about the movie. Also, despite anything negative I may say about Super 8, let me just reiterate that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching the film. It's easily one of the best stories in a movie I've seen this year. Not the best, but, probably, top 5.I have very ambivalent feelings about Mr. Abrams. The more removed I am from the experience of sitting in the theater watching Super 8, the more my ambivalence towards Abrams extends over to the movie. See, Abrams has this problem: he likes to hide things behind his back to generate suspense. You remember doing that when you were a kid, right? Or, at least, having it done to you? When you're a kid, it's kind of fun. Trying to ""convince"" someone to show you what he's hiding. It's fun because you know he really does want to show you, so, once you've played the game long enough, he'll give you a peek. Teenagers change this to the ""I've got a secret"" game, but it's really the same thing.There are two problems with this: 1. the thing is often anti-climactic 2. sometimes, we already know. Oh, actually, there's one other problem: it only works once. It's sort of a cheap trick in story telling because of that, when the suspense is being generated by just holding the secret behind your back. There's no reason to go back and experience it again, because you already know the secret. As opposed to a movie like The Sixth Sense (and I hate using this, because I don't have much respect for what Shyamalan has become. However, you can't deny that this one film was brilliant. Possibly the most brilliant of its genre) where the secret is really in front of you the whole time, you just don't know it because you haven't figured it out. You can watch it over and over again marveling at how you should have figured it out but just didn't.That was the biggest issue I had with Super 8; I had flashbacks of Cloverfield, which is a movie I just didn't enjoy. I appreciate what Abrams was trying to do (it was a great idea), but the execution was... well, it was just weak. A movie without a plot with the author holding a monster behind his back that he flashes to us for a brief moment at the end and leaves us saying, ""That's it? That was all? Two hours of this just for that?"" He applies this same gimmick to Super 8, and, although he gives us a better view of the critter at the end of the movie, I still felt like I'd been kind of cheated. It was sort of like finding out that all he'd had behind his back the whole time was a frog. There was nothing startling about the alien. It was an alien. Big deal.Abrams' genius lies in his ideas. He comes up with great concepts. Like Cloverfield. He doesn't have the best execution, though. He lets the idea run away with him instead of harnessing the idea. His Star Trek is a great example of this. He has this problem. He needs to re-boot the Star Trek franchise, but he doesn't want to just do the same thing over again. How could he shake things up? Destroy Vulcan. Go off on a whole new timeline. It was a great idea. But red matter? Seriously? That's the best he could come up with? And some guy sitting around in a space ship for decades just waiting? Yeah, it sounds malevolent and all, but, come on, decades? There's bound to be a point where the boredom sets in. Don't get me wrong, I loved his Star Trek. It's the best Star Trek out there, but, in the end, it's still just Star Trek with things like red matter that make my eyes roll.He seems to have a follow through issue, too. Like a cat in a field of butterflies. Alias comes to mind. Another great idea. The first season was exceptional. Hooked me and my wife. We watched the whole series based on that first season. Well, the second season was pretty good, too. Somewhere in the third season, though, he got a new idea, Lost, and left Alias to pursue that instead. And Alias was full of the ""what am I hiding behind my back?"" plots. Every season. Oh, and everyone was an enemy spy that they would just suddenly reveal ""by the way, I have a secret."" I haven't watched Lost, but it has sounded like it was much the same. Great concept. It must have been considering how many people flocked to it, but he left it somewhere in there to go do Fringe, which I couldn't watch. I tried. But it was just too Abrams. Oh, and there was Star Trek in there, too, so, really, all you people out there upset about how Lost ended, you can't exactly blame Abrams, because he wasn't there. Other people were responsible for whatever bad stuff happened at the end of the series. Oh, wait. Abrams wasn't there. I guess you can blame him. But, you know, he probably didn't have any idea about how to end it, either, so it probably wouldn't have mattered if he had been there.Super 8 evokes all of these Abrams issues for me. I can see them all in there. However, 8 has one saving grace: the story is just E.T. With a twist. It's the ""what if the government had found the alien first?"" version. But it's still a story about a boy that has lost a parent and is trying to cope with his loss. By meeting an alien. If only that was an option available to all boys that have lost a parent. Spielberg gave Abrams an assist on the story, so it's not surprising that that's what we're getting. Just with a lot of explosions and guns and eating humans (because that's really the freakiest moment in the movie, the alien casually munching on a human limb like it's eating a chicken leg). It's a strong story, and I could probably watch Super 8 again for the story, although the suspense surrounding the alien won't be there. My wife said she'd watch it again just to see the train crash again. It is spectacular.Abrams does an excellent job with the setting. It evokes that sense of nostalgia in people my age and older. Those memories of what it was like to be a kid at that time. It's probably the strongest thing about the movie. It's perfect. Kids riding bikes. Models hanging from ceilings. Star Wars posters and comic books. All those things that are gone from mainstream life today. No cell phones. No computers. Cameras that actually use film that has to be developed. In that respect, I'm not sure how the movie plays to younger audiences. I haven't seen anything from that demographic about it, and we didn't take our kids to see it. I'm pretty sure all the explosions would make up for any lack of connection with the world of the movie, though.There's even a message. Most movies, these days, don't have messages. Or themes. Nothing beyond the good vs evil. Which is fine, but it can go deeper than that. Abrams doesn't want anyone to miss his message, so he states it plainly for the audience. I'm impressed by this. Not in that he did it, but that people have still missed it. I know they have. I've read more reviews about this movie than any movie in a long time, and they all missed it. I would have thought that stating it the way Abrams did was a bit heavy handed, but, evidently, you have to put it right out there for people to even have a hope of them getting it, and, still, people will miss it. It's like communication with teenagers. Maybe that's where he messed up; he didn't state the message at least three times. Having spent many years of my life working with teenagers, I have experience with the ""at least three times"" thing. Most of them will get it after three times, although some still miss out and have to come back and ask ""what did you say?""At any rate, it's a good message. So good, in fact, that I'm going to quote it. The whole movie, the whole story, leads up to this one line. From the very first frame, he begins setting up the story, with a true  plot arc, to lead up to the one line of the movie that will sum everything up. However, I don't think it will spoil anything to know it ahead of time, because this particular aspect of the movie is about the journey. The journey of a father and a son trying to figure out how to connect with each other after the loss of the wife and mother. It's a touching journey and more grounded in reality than E. T., since the relationship in E.T. is the relationship with the alien. Who, then, leaves. Like Eliot's father left. This time, though, the boy is left with his father and the knowledge, ""Bad things happen. Bad things happen, but you can still live.""",4,"""You can still live.""",1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,9587,"['wife', 'screamed', 'mean', 'really', 'screamed', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one',

The movie was set in 1979 when ""Alien"" was released and the child characters are shooting the zombie film for Super 8 film festival. The drama starts off with teens making a film but when they encounter the strange train derailment scene they are drawn into the military situation, sort of X-files or Taken plot that what the train cargos were carrying was actually an alien. The accident was dealt beautifully just like seeing Hayao Miyazaki animation film in live action. Since then so much sci-fi cliches go on and on. But despite of similarities to previous hit films I love this movie overall. It has heartfelt drama the feel of E.T in it.

His mother has recently died and his dad (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy who is semi-understanding. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the brains behind the film. Alice (Elle Fanning) agrees to help them with the movie. After midnight, she drives the foursome to the scene. She doesn't have a license and is worried because the deputy's son is with them. Joe promises not to tell. One boy, Cary, has a love for fire and fireworks. Alice's father (Ron Eldard) gets in trouble with the law. Her relationship with Joe is not welcomed by him. This develops into a background Romeo and Juliet scenario, something for the young teen girl appeal.As they are rehearsing a scene at the station, a train is coming down the tracks. Charles scrambles to get a film clip of the train while shooting the scene. Then it happens: a white pick-up truck speeds by the train. There is a wreak. The kids panic and run for their lives as RR cars explode all around them. When the smoke clears they take a quick headcount. There are things which look like a white Rubik's cubes all around them.Charles recognizes the driver of said white truck; it is his fourth period biology teacher, Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman, a black man with a PhD. in biology teaching middle school in white suburban Lillian, Ohio). In his near dying breath the teacher instructs the kids not to say anything or else they and their families will be hunted down and killed! As GI Joe shows up at the scene, the kids grab their equipment and speed out of there...and they take one of the cubes.The Air Force has taken charge of the clean up. The town's people are kept away and in the dark. Then weird things start to happen...Sheriff goes missing, dogs go missing, car engines go missing, microwaves go missing. There is clearly a ""monster"" thing on the loose, but the camera doesn't let us see it, very similar to many of the Jurassic Park/ Predator scenes. I wish I had seen this on IMAX. There are a number of scenes where things suddenly ""jump out at you."" This always makes it fun for a bunch of kids at the theater.Spielberg/ Adams bring out the best in the child actors making them very convincing and realistic. The humor is pointed at kids. When Alice asks how to be a zombie, Joe tells her to act like their English teacher. The movie contains numerous anachronisms: Rubik's cube and Walkman came out in 1980 while the movie takes place in 1979. Elle Fanning is asked to play a number of different parts in this film, and she does them all well. I felt like I was watching her audition tape.At some point in time the hippie (store clerk who tries to sell Charles pot) lets out a WTF.

I also did not know that there would be a lot of nostalgic and coming-of-age-teen themes.  Again, a not unwelcome surprise for someone that lists American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused as favorites.  There was plenty to like about Super 8.Taking place in the late 1970s, the world we notice in the movie incorporates longish hairstyles, classic muscle cars, Coca Cola in bottles, and simpler times for youngsters.  Kids actually played back then.  They had adventures, got together to be creative, and had fun in real-time.  There was no Internet or text messaging to distance relationships.  The somewhat dorky and outcast group of friends in this film are into cinema and making their own ultra-low budget zombie flick.  The dialogue, plot, and ""production value"" of their project is simplistic and childish.  However, I could appreciate and recall the low level of sophistication that one has as a junior high student.  It was authentic and reminded me of my own efforts at being creative as an adolescent.  Every small-town kid with an artistic streak should be able to relate to this aspect of Super 8.With teen nostalgia, naturally, comes a love story.  It is not overpowering stuff or a main focus of the plot, but more of a cute and sugar sweet distraction.  Again, Super 8 hits the right notes to make you remember a far-off time when having a crush was a big deal.  It could make your summer.But what makes the season for the group of friends here is a mysterious train derailment and an even more suspicious clean-up effort by the United States Air Force.  The movie grabs you by the collar and takes an unusual turn after the crash.  I was not sure what was coming next.  Gory horror sequence?  Black hole opened to a parallel universe?  Government conspiracy?  A mishmash of all of those possibilities?  What comes out of the crash is revealed slowly and carefully, and with great storytelling skill.  Super 8 has style that is graceful, witty, never clumsy, and well-executed to keep you focused and interested.  There is even some light humor to break up the question marks.  Remember that this is a science fiction film, and you will suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fantastic story and classic feel of the way we move through it.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed at how improbable (impossible?) the reality of Super 8 turns out.I enjoyed the suspense, surprises, and explosions here more than the theme of loss that permeates the protagonist's psyche and closes the circle at the end of the film.  I felt the resolution was a little forced and cheesy.  But, one forced element of an otherwise entertaining, well-conceived, and well-executed film is forgivable.  Give Super 8 a run, and you will not be disappointed.",3,Like Dazed and Confused with a sci-fi twist,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2851,"['Going', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'science', 'fiction', 'picture', 'was', 'interesting', 'surprise', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'nostalgic', 'coming-of-age-teen', 'themes', 'Again', 'not', 'unwelcome', 'surprise', 'someone', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'favorites', 'was', 'plenty', 'like', 'Super', '8.Taking', 'place', 'late', '1970s', 'world', 'notice', 'movie', 'longish', 'hairstyles', 'classic', 'muscle', 'cars', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'bottles', 'simpler', 'times', 'youngsters', 'Kids', 'actually', 'played', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'adventures', 'got', 'together', 'be', 'creative', 'had', 'fun', 'real-time', 'was', 'Internet', 'text', 'messaging', 'distance', 'relationships', 'somewhat', 'dorky', 'outcast', 'group', 'friends', 'film', 'are', 'cinema', 'making', 'own', 'ultra-low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'production', 'value', 'project', 'simplistic', 'childish', 'However', 'could', 'appreciate', 'recall', 'low', 'level', 'sophistication', 'one', 'junior', 'high', 'student', 'was', 'authentic', 'reminded', 'own', 'efforts', 'being', 'creative', 'adolescent', 'small-town', 'kid', 'artistic', 'streak', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'aspect', 'Super', '8.With', 'teen', 'nostalgia', 'naturally', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'overpowering', 'stuff', 'main', 'focus', 'plot', 'more', 'cute', 'sugar', 'sweet', 'distraction', 'Again', 'Super', '8', 'right', 'notes', 'make', 'remember', 'far-off', 'time', 'when', 'having', 'crush', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'could', 'make', 'summer.But', 'what', 'season', 'group', 'friends', 'here', 'mysterious', 'train', 'derailment', 'even', 'more', 'suspicious', 'clean-up', 'effort', 'United', 'States', 'Air', 'Force', 'movie', 'grabs', 'collar', 'unusual', 'turn', 'crash', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'Gory', 'horror', 'sequence', 'Black', 'hole', 'opened', 'parallel', 'universe', 'Government', 'conspiracy', 'mishmash', 'possibilities', 'What', 'crash', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'great', 'storytelling', 'skill', 'Super', '8', 'style', 'graceful', 'witty', 'never', 'clumsy', 'well-executed', 'keep', 'focused', 'interested', 'even', 'light', 'humor', 'break', 'up', 'question', 'marks', 'Remember', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'will', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'story', 'classic', 'feel', 'way', 'move', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'improbable', 'impossible', 'reality', 'Super', '8', 'out.I', 'enjoyed', 'suspense', 'surprises', 'explosions', 'here', 'more', 'theme', 'loss', 'protagonist', 'psyche', 'circle', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'resolution', 'was', 'little', 'forced', 'cheesy', 'one', 'forced', 'element', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'well-conceived', 'well-executed', 'film', 'forgivable', 'Give', 'Super', '8', 'run', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
1399730,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004EPYZPS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 7]","J.J. Abrams has not made a lot of films, but each film has been very good, embracing the genre and giving fans something to celebrate. Even ""Mission Impossible III"", derided because of Cruise's shenanigans, was very good, better than the first two installments. But each film has been a stepping stone. Considering the quality of these films, the possibility of a filmmaker of Abrams' skill and caliber working on a personal project has been tantalizing.Now, with ""Super 8"", Abrams makes a film based on his own idea. He blends all of his superlative filmmaking skills with a personal story and the effort is almost magical. ""Super 8"" is by far the best film I have seen this year. And it will take a lot for a new film to take this position away. It just may end up as the best film of the year.Set in small town Ohio, in 1979, a group of kids gets together to make a film using their super 8 cameras. Originally a zombie film, the director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), a pudgy kid from a large, noisy family, decides his magnum opus needs more drama, so he enlists the help of Alice (Elle Fanning), who his friend and cameraman, Joe (Joel Courtney) has a crush on. The whole group sneaks out at midnight and heads to the local train station. As a train approaches, Charles shouts for the crew to get ready, he wants to capture the ""production value"" of the train speeding by. But a truck soon appears and begins driving directly for the locomotive. The kids watch in horror as the truck crashes into the train and the whole thing derails. They run for their lives, trying to escape the carnage. As the dust begins to clear, they realize there have been no injuries amongst them and run off just as ominous government agencies begin to arrive to do the clean-up. Charles and Joel also find the camera. It is broken, but they decide to develop the film anyway. Over the next few days, Joel's dad, Jackson, the Sheriff (Kyle Chandler) begins to realize something strange is going on; dogs begin to disappear, then his boss is missing, then the government steps in and gives him a story about the train wreck. Jackson confronts Nelec (Noah Emmerich), the leader of the army's 'clean-up' efforts. Just as the rumors begin to fly, and stories of mysterious sightings begin to circulate, the town is evacuated because of a wild fire. Joel and his friends try to escape to figure out what is going on.From the moment ""Super 8"" begins, you know you are in for something special. Abrams sets the film in 1979 which also seems to be a homage to the sort of film his mentor, and producer of the film, Steven Spielberg made during the same period. Everything about the film seems authentic and real. People are wearing new Walkmans. The clothes and cars are all period specific. The attitudes are even a little more innocent. Even better, when Abrams decides to feature some new-fangled item, like the Walkman, for instance, it becomes a part of the story. This takes the moment from being a simple wink-wink nudge-nudge type of thing and shows how clever Abrams really is. It is very easy to make a visual reference like this. It is much more difficult to make it a believable part of the story. Abrams always does the more difficult and makes it work.Charles is part of a large, noisy family who seems to be bursting out of the walls of their house. Yet, there is always room for Joe at the table. Joe and Charles are best friends and this helps to make the film seem even a little more nostalgic. In fact, there seem to be more similarities in this film to Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" than to the oft-mentioned ""E.T."". Charles large family and their crowded dinner table are similar to the Neary family's. At one point, an electrician is fixing a power line. He stands in the bucket on his truck and rises toward the junction box. Roy Neary was also an electrician who is trying to fix massive power outages. ""Close Encounters"" is set in Indiana, ""Super 8"" in Ohio, Both feature people from small town America dealing with something they could never have imagined.The real key to the success of ""Super 8"" is the kids. Everyone of them gives a good performance and really raises the bar for future child actors. Joel Courtney plays Joe, the son of the local Sheriff. A family tragedy puts a strain on the relationship between the two and Joe escapes the pressures of his everyday life with his large group of friends. Courtney is just so natural, so at ease, he never seems like he is acting. He deals with his grief, with his dad, with the drama in his town like anyone his age would. They escape into the making of their film. Joe is also extremely nervous when Charles announces he has asked Alice to act in the film because he has a huge crush on Alice and becomes a bit tongue-tied. Joe becomes the hero of the film, fighting every inch of the way to find out what is going on and then fighting to end the problem. It is a very good, richly observed performance. More amazing, this is Joel Courtney's first film.Riley Griffiths plays Charles, the director of the film the kids are working on. It is difficult to tell for sure, but I will bet that this character is closely modeled after Abrams when he was a kid. Charles is a funny guy; his face always buried in a movie magazine, thinking of new scenes, new ideas to make their film that much better. He has clearly read everything he could possibly get his hands on and relishes every bit of it, even the stuff he doesn't completely understand. At the train station, he walks around framing the picture with his hands; he seems obsessed with capturing 'production values', like the real train passing. When they retrieve the camera after the wreck, they take the film to the local photo shop and send it away to be processed. His performance is funny, but not overly jokey; he is just a normal kid who loves everything about filmmaking. More amazing, this is Riley Griffith's first film as well.Elle Fanning, the veteran of the group, is very good. Alice seems intrigued to be involved in the film, but she is also asked to help provide the transportation for the group, which puts her on edge when the Sheriff's son shows up. She doesn't have a driver's license and is afraid of getting into trouble. But Joe quickly puts her at ease. When they arrive at the train station, they are all amazed by her acting ability. Throughout the course of the film, she and Joe spend a lot of time together and become closer and their relationship provides many sweet innocent moments to the film.The rest of the kids are all great. Each is different, fun and unique.Kyle Chandler does a great job as Jackson, the man who is a Sheriff first and a dad to Joe second. He quickly realizes something is going on and becomes even more determined to figure things out when he meets Nelec and realizes they aren't telling him the whole truth. His town is experiencing something big, and it consumes him, so it takes him a while to realize his son is getting into mischief. But when he does, he quickly puts a stop to it. Then he becomes busy again, leaving Joe to his own devices. The relationship between the two is not good, and hasn't been good for a long time. Then, the family tragedy only pulls them further apart. Chandler does a very good job of showing us all of the different responsibilities Jackson is dealing with.Toby Emmerich adds another shady government/ villain-type role to his resume. The role is good, believable and suitable for the story. But the character actor has played this role before, many times.Ron Eldard plays Louis, Alice's no-good dad. Louis is haunted by many demons and adds complexity to the film.The real beauty of ""Super 8"" is that Abrams is simply a great filmmaker. He seems determined to make films in which he reveals as little as possible about the creature/ monster/ alien/ threat to the main characters as possible. In ""Cloverfield"", a film he helped write and produce, the threat is viewed in brief snippets, often in grainy cell phone or camcorder footage. For the majority of the film, you never see it fully. This does two things. It makes the menace more believable and it creates more suspense. Because we can't see the whole thing, we are less likely to find fault in it, or to disbelieve in the existence of it. Also, because the threat is revealed in small, fleeting moments, we are never sure when it will show up. I know some people don't like this film, but the cinema verite style, the unknown cast and the snippets of footage of the creature all served to create a memorable monster film.Abrams continues this same sort of idea in ""Super 8"". The threat to this small town is not revealed for a long time. But to maintain suspense, we see bits of what it can cause. Joe watches through small, high windows as things fly into the air. The electrician watches things happening in a maintenance building in the distance. Even when we are placed close to the action, Abrams uses some fairly brilliant methods to hide the identity of the threat.When everything starts to fall into place and we realize what is going on, it all makes sense and we are committed to the ride because we have spent so much time in this universe, with these characters.It is also unusual (unfortunately) for a summer film to capture any emotion, let alone anything that could seem real and move us. In ""Super 8"", Abrams sets up the story with a sad event, which helps to inform us of the relationship between Joe and Jackson. And throughout the story, we see how strained their life together is, how difficult. And this all leads to a very emotional moment, which I confess, made me tear up.Ultimately, ""Super 8"" has moments that are funny, scary, suspenseful, exciting, dramatic and more. It has everything. Better yet, everything seems necessary to the characters and the story.A couple of weeks before the film was released, I watched the trailer for ""Super 8"" before another highly anticipated summer film. After the trailer, someone mumbled ""E.T., phone home"" causing some laughter. But this remark is more of a compliment than a dig. Abrams has captured the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder Elliot and his brother and sister experience in ""E.T."" And because of this, he captures the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder for us to relive.If it sounds like I am gushing, I am. Go see this movie. Go. Go already.",5,"Abrams is ""Super""",1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,10422,"['J.J.', 'Abrams', 'not', 'made', 'lot', 'films', 'film', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'embracing', 'genre', 'giving', 'fans',

In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was really fantastic.

No, not a love story between the characters (sure, there's a little bit of that kissy stuff), but a love story between director J.J. Abrams and Stephen Spielberg.  It is obvious from Abrams's films that, like plenty of children who grew up in 70s and 80s, he was raised on the work of Spielberg and Lucas.  In fact, his Star Trek preboot arguably has more in common with the work of Lucas and Spielberg than with the original series.  Fashioning himself as something of a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Abrams has created a wonderful little homage to his mentor.The film opens with the off screen death of Joe Lamb's mother who worked at the local steel mill.  Both Joe and his father, Jackson, a deputy in the local police department, must deal with the emotional trauma that naturally comes from losing a loved one.  At the same time, the death also strains the relationship between Joe and Jackson.  Jackson just doesn't seem to know how to raise his son without his wife around, and he wants to ship him off to a baseball camp for the summer in the hopes that it will give him some space and stifle Joe's interest in filmmaking.  Joe has been serving as the special effects and make-up artist on his friends' movie about, what else, zombies.The kids' zombie movie is arguably the most important aspect of Super 8.  The gang's film represents the transformation of their playacting into an art form, a transition from childhood into adulthood that still manages to bridge these two conditions.  The film further embodies the split between the world of adults and children.  In many of Spielberg's early films, especially E.T., the difference between how children and adults see the world is represented in esoteric knowledge.  The fact that the wonderful and strange actually exists can only first be perceived by an innocent youth.  But it is also by making this film that the boys come into contact with the fairer sex.  The director, Charles, has managed to get a girl, Alice, to agree to play the part of the hero's wife.  Joe happens to have an unrequited crush on Alice, and later in the film he gets to play the daring hero to her damsel in distress when Alice is in danger.Oh, and there's also a giant space alien in the film that's trying to get off this planet while wreaking havoc on the towns folk.  The alien arrives in town by way of a derailed freight train.  The only witnesses to the train disaster are Joe and his gang who have set up next to the tracks in hopes of incorporating the train into their film so that it will lend it some verisimilitude.  The train derailment and the gang's escape is one of the finer set pieces of the film, and it is somewhat reminiscent of the plane crash in what is arguably Abrams's finest directorial effort, the pilot to the TV show Lost.  In all, the alien seems like something of an afterthought.  While Abrams does a commendable job of laying down some carefully constructed chaos, the alien himself seems somewhat perfunctory.  Unlike in E.T. (a movie that I cannot help comparing Super 8 to, even if a little unfairly), where E.T. served as a companion to a child of a single parent household who struggled to connect to other children of his own age, Super 8's monster seems like generic threat #5, seemingly picked out of a hat at random.  The alien menace and the drama of loss and adulthood never come together fully.  And while it is often enjoyable watching people escape or be eaten by the monster, I couldn't help but want to get back to the gang making their movie.But as homage the film does plenty right.  In the 80s Spielberg placed films he produced and directed in small town suburbia, often in the Pacific Northwest.  Likewise, Abrams's Super 8 takes place in a small town in Southwest Ohio.  We can tell the movie takes place in the late seventies because the local steel mill has yet to close down.  I also grew up in a small Ohio town, and while we didn't have a steel mill (maple syrup was a large part of the local economy), the setting did make me a little wistful for small town life.  One of the great messages that come out of Spielberg's early work as a director and producer, whether it is E.T. or Goonies, is that you need not leave your town to look for adventure.  The unusual, the exciting can be uncovered in your neighbors yard, the boarded up house down the street, or the local patch of woods.  The paradoxically infinite confines of suburbia were so full of excitement that leaving that world seemed unnecessary.And in this sense, Abrams does a fine job of mimicking Spielberg.  He may not have all of the details right, but he has done his homework, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster.  In a world full of sequels and prequels, we need more movies like Super 8.  Abrams may fall into the clich&eacute; of the prodigy piano player carefully reconstructing a classic; he can play the notes but he misses the soul of the music.  But then again, the music was pretty great to begin with.",4,Charming Homage to Spielberg's Younger Days,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,5018,"['Super', '8', 'love', 'story', 'No', 'not', 'love',

When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like ""Cloverfield"" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Stand By Me"" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic.

At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train.Written and directed by J. J.

1399746,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EPYZPS,Turfseer,"[4, 13]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***It sure doesn't hurt to have your film produced by Steven Spielberg and apparently J.J. Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg--he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives.After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically--once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed.",2,Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific

There are also quite a few bits of humor in the film for both adults and kids. There is also plenty of action.This movie is rated PG-13, which surprises me, mainly because of the language. Apparently the word sh*t is not a profanity anymore. Just be aware of this if watching this with your kids. Other than that word being used repeatedly, it is completely fine for family movie night.This movie really reminded me of the Goonies movie from the 1980's, except instead of a pirate theme Super 8 is centered around, well, I don't want to give it away and ruin it.

1399748,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B004EPYZPS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Set during the summer of 1979 in a small town in Ohio, SUPER 8 revolves around Joe Lam (Joel Lamb) and his friends as they attempt to finish a Super 8 zombie movie for an upcoming Super 8 Film Festival. While filming one night at the local train station, the boys and the star actress of their production are witness to and somewhat involved with a horrible train accident that unleashes a mysterious creature. Soon after, all the dogs in the town run away, people start disappearing, and all kinds of pieces of electronics and machinery are stolen. Oh, and the military has moved in and blocked off the area around the train crash. While watching footage that was shot on the night of the crash, Joe and his friends make a startling discovery. The boys attempt to finish their movie while at the same time solving the mystery of the alien creature.SUPER 8 is a sci-fi movie that has very little to do with sci-fi. Instead, the movie is more of an action movie drama that's about relationships. The core of the movie is about the relationship between Joe and his friends. They are a close knit group of companions, but you know that after high school they will go their separate ways, perhaps some of them never to meet again. At the same time, you know that some of the friends will be friends throughout life.Besides being a movie about the relationship between childhood friends, SUPER 8 is also a movie about family. The movie begins in an incredibly depressing manner with the death of Joe's mother, her funeral, and the immediate aftermath. After her death, Joe and his dad (Kyle Chandler) attempt to hold on while forging ahead; adjusting to the new normal after the death of a close loved one is extremely difficult. There's also the relationship between Joe's love interest, Alice (Elle Fanning) and her own father (Ron Eldard). In a completely different vein, there's also the budding relationship between Joe and Alice. Oh, and there's the whole thing about our own relationship as humanity with other creatures (in this case an extraterrestrial creature).I really enjoyed SUPER 8. It's one of my favorite movies from 2011. The movie was directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. I felt the film was a decent film on its own. It's a nice little story with some great moments of acting. However, what sticks out most about the movie is the overwhelming since of nostalgia that swathes every inch of the film like a college dorm reeking of potpourri incense. The movie isn't just a homage to the late 1970s and early 1980s, it's a full blown love song that blares out over Abrams's film boom box as he stands outside Steven Spielberg's office. There were a lot of movies made in the 1980s that were Spielbergian in tone or style. However, in the past twenty years, not even Steven Spielberg has made many Spielbergian movies. SUPER 8 resurrects the Spielbergian-style of filmmaking. The movie pays homage to a slew of other films (and in some cases outright steals from some): E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and THE GOONIES are easily the largest influences. However, there are several others including JURASSIC PARK, JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD, JAWS, GREMLINS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Also, the zombie movie the boys are making, &#34;The Case&#34; has several references to George Romero and his zombie films.Like most of Steven Spielberg's and J.J. Abram's previous works, not everyone will enjoy SUPER 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone (probably most particularly those over the age of sixty). Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in SUPER 8 especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.The DVD of SUPER 8 doesn't include many extras. There's the usual commentary with director J.J. Abrams and some of his crew. Done correctly, this often can be one of the most rewarding extras of a DVD. However, in this case, the commentary is incredibly boring. Abrams and his buddies croon about Spielberg throughout, there are long pauses throughout where there is no commentary or discussion, and there really isn't any new information revealed that wasn't already available in the promotional materials for the movie and DVD. The other special features include a short featurette with Abrams and his crew entitled &#34;The Dream Behind SUPER 8&#34;. That featurette was more exciting that the DVD commentary. There's another featurette entitled &#34;The Visitor Lives: Creating the Creature&#34; that features the main creature designer for the alien. This is an interesting look at the process of how the alien came to be created. Lastly, there are a series of trailers for upcoming and soon-to-be released movies.",5,It's Like THE GOONIES crossed with E.T. with a touch of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,4778,"['Set', 'summer', '1979', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'SUPER', '8', 'revolves', 'Joe', 'Lam', 'Joel', 'Lamb', 'friends', 'attempt', 'finish', 'Super', '8', 'zombie', 'movie', 'upcoming', 'Super', '8', 'Film', 'Festival', 'filming', 'one', 'night', 'local', 'train', 'station', 'boys', 'star', 'actress', 'production', 'are', 'witness', 'somewhat', 'involved', 'horrible', 'train', 'accident', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'Soon', 'dogs', 'town', 'run', 'away', 'people', 'start', 'disappearing', 'kinds', 'pieces', 'electronics', 'machinery', 'are', 'stolen', 'Oh', 'military', 'moved', 'blocked', 'off', 'area', 'train', 'crash', 'watching', 'footage', 'was', 'shot', 'night', 'crash', 'Joe', 'friends', 'make', 'startling', 'discovery', 'boys', 'attempt', 'finish', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'solving', 'mystery', 'alien', 'creature.SUPER', '8', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'sci-fi', 'Instead', 'movie', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'drama', 'relationships', 'core', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'friends', 'are', 'close', 'knit', 'group', 'companions', 'know', 'high', 'school', 'will', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'never', 'meet', 'again', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'friends', 'life.Besides', 'being', 'movie', 'relationship', 'childhood', 'friends', 'SUPER', '8', 'also', 'movie', 'family', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'manner', 'death', 'Joe', 'mother', 'funeral', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'death', 'Joe', 'dad', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'attempt', 'hold', 'forging', 'ahead', 'adjusting', 'new', 'normal', 'death', 'close', 'loved', 'one', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'also', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'love', 'interest', 'Alice', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'own', 'father', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'completely', 'different', 'vein', 'also', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'Alice', 'Oh', 'whole', 'thing', 'own', 'relationship', 'humanity', 'other', 'creatures', 'case', 'extraterrestrial', 'creature', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'SUPER', '8', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '2011', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'own', 'nice', 'little', 'story', 'great', 'moments', 'acting', 'However', 'what', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'overwhelming', 'nostalgia', 'inch', 'film', 'college', 'dorm', 'reeking', 'potpourri', 'incense', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'homage', 'late', '1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'full', 'blown', 'love', 'song', 'out', 'Abrams', 'film', 'boom', 'box', 'outside', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'office', 'were', 'lot', 'movies', 'made', '1980s', 'were', 'Spielbergian', 'tone', 'style', 'However', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'many', 'Spielbergian', 'movies', 'SUPER', '8', 'Spielbergian-style', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'homage', 'slew', 'other', 'films', 'cases', 'outright', 'steals', 'E.T.', 'CLOSE', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'KIND', 'THE', 'GOONIES', 'are', 'easily', 'largest', 'influences', 'However', 'are', 'several', 'others', 'including', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'LOST', 'WORLD', 'JAWS', 'GREMLINS', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'Also', 'zombie', 'movie', 'boys', 'are', 'making', '34', 'Case', '34', 'several', 'references', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'most', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'J.J.', 'Abram', 'previous', 'works', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'SUPER', '8', 'broad', 'appeal', 'tone', 'style', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'probably', 'most', 'particularly', 'age', 'sixty', 'Nevertheless', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'SUPER', '8', 'especially', 'focus', 'relationship', 'characters', 'not', 'overall', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'SUPER', '8', ""n't"", 'include', 'many', 'extras', 'usual', 'commentary', 'director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'crew', 'Done', 'correctly', 'often', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'rewarding', 'extras', 'DVD', 'However', 'case', 'commentary', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'Abrams', 'buddies', 'croon', 'Spielberg', 'are', 'long', 'pauses', 'where', 'commentary', 'discussion', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'new', 'information', 'revealed', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'available', 'promotional', 'materials', 'movie', 'DVD', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'short', 'featurette', 'Abrams', 'crew', 'entitled', '34', 'Dream', 'Behind', 'SUPER', '8', '34', 'featurette', 'was', 'more', 'exciting', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'Visitor', 'Creating', 'Creature', '34', 'main', 'creature', 'designer', 'alien', 'interesting', 'look', 'process', 'how', 'alien', 'came', 'be', 'created', 'Lastly', 'are', 'series', 'trailers', 'upcoming', 'soon-to-be', 'released', 'movies']",N/A

J.J. Abrams has proven to be something of a film and TV chameleon able to imitate the stuff he liked from his youth while also adding something new and unique about which makes it like good comfort food--it's familiar but not TOO familiar. There are some minor problems with the third act of the film but, on the whole, this throw back bit of entertainment recalls what Spielberg (and even Rob Reiner did so well with ""Stand By Me"" the OTHER best film that Spielberg never made)did well before he became a ""serious"" artist; Abrams creates compelling characters with nicely detailed teenagers and although the adults are a little less well developed, they are pretty well done.Set in the late 1970's, ""Super 8"" follows a group of kids making a zombie movie that they are going to enter in a Super 8 film competition. The kids witness a train crash while filming at an old train station and SOMETHING comes out of one of the cars. This thing begins taking people from the down, stealing microwaves and other devices. When the military show up, it's pretty clear that something BIG has gone wrong.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is very much a demo quality Blu-ray. Colors pop, detail is remarkably sharp and abundant (well, except for the Super 8 footage some of which was actually shot on 16mm so they could add visual effects--by the way the Super 8 movie is at the conclusion during the titles and is a chuckle particularly if you were from that generation that made their own little movies).Audio is positively stunning with a lossless mix.Special features are quite good-- we get deleted scenes (all in HD) as well as a series of featurettes covering the train wreck sequence from conception to execution showing us various stages of completion and featuring Abrams, the visual effects superiors, etc. We also get a digital copy (it's a digital download that you need the code sheet for which is inside) and a DVD copy of the film. There are also eight featurettes that focus on the creation of the film from the story to the final product. Finally we get an engaging commentary track by J.J. Abrams but do yourself a favor and listen to it AFTER you watch the movie because there are spoilers and, of course, a lot of info on the making of the film that might prove distracting.If you enjoyed early Spielberg films from the 1980's like ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind"" (or even ""E.T."" although this is scary and there is some profanity to be aware), you'll enjoy ""Super 8"".",4,"""Super 8""-The best Spielberg movie Spielberg never made",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2599,"['Super', '8', 'best', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'made', 'least', 'best', 'Stand', 'Me', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'proven', 'be', 'something', 'film', 'TV', 'chameleon', 'able', 'imitate', 'stuff', 'liked', 'youth', 'also', 'adding', 'something', 'new', 'unique', 'good', 'comfort', 'food', 'familiar', 'not', 'TOO', 'familiar', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'whole', 'throw', 'back', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'recalls', 'what', 'Spielberg', 'even', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Stand', 'Me', 'OTHER', 'best', 'film', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'made', 'did', 'well', 'became', 'serious', 'artist', 'Abrams', 'compelling', 'characters', 'nicely', 'detailed', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'are', 'little', 'less', 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done.Set', 'late', '1970', 'Super', '8', 'group', 'kids', 'making', 'zombie', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'enter', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'competition', 'kids', 'witness', 'train', 'crash', 'filming', 'old', 'train', 'station', 'SOMETHING', 'one', 'cars', 'thing', 'taking', 'people', 'down', 'stealing', 'microwaves', 'other', 'devices', 'When', 'military', 'show', 'up', 'pretty', 'clear', 'something', 'BIG', 'gone', 'wrong.The', 'Blu-ray', 'positively', 'stunning', 'very', 'much', 'demo', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'Colors', 'pop', 'detail', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'abundant', 'well', 'Super', '8', 'footage', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', '16mm', 'could', 'add', 'visual', 'effects', 'way', 'Super', '8', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'titles', 'chuckle', 'particularly', 'were', 'generation', 'made', 'own', 'little', 'movies', '.Audio', 'positively', 'stunning', 'lossless', 'mix.Special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'HD', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'featurettes', 'covering', 'train', 'wreck', 'sequence', 'conception', 'execution', 'showing', 'various', 'stages', 'completion', 'featuring', 'Abrams', 'visual', 'effects', 'superiors', 'etc', 'also', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'digital', 'download', 'need', 'code', 'sheet', 'inside', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'eight', 'featurettes', 'focus', 'creation', 'film', 'story', 'final', 'product', 'Finally', 'get', 'engaging', 'commentary', 'track', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'do', 'favor', 'listen', 'AFTER', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'spoilers', 'course', 'lot', 'info', 'making', 'film', 'might', 'prove', 'distracting.If', 'enjoyed', 'early', 'Spielberg', 'films', '1980', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'even', 'E.T', 'scary', 'profanity', 'be', 'aware', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Super', '8']",N/A

Once the alien is let loose on this small American town many strange events begin occurring that impact the struggles the human characters are already experiencing.The central character in the film is 14 year old Joe Lamb who lives in a small town in Ohio. At the start of the film we discover that Joe has just lost his mother in an industrial accident at the factory she worked.  As a typical young teen Joe is heavily involved with his friends, chief among them is Charles Kaznyk who is passionate about the zombie movie they are all making on a super 8 camera for a local film competition. The lead actress in Charles's zombie movie is Alice ""Ellie"" Dainard on whom Joe has a crush. But this budding romance is the center of further pain and controversy for Joe. Alice's father, Louis Dainard, is an abusive alcoholic and it is revealed that the day Joe's mother died she was covering a shift that Louis was unable to work due to his drunkenness. This fact cause problems between Joe and his father, Jack, a deputy sheriff and the relationship between Joe and Alice also furthers the already strained relationship between Louis and his daughter Alice. The budding young romance also puts strain on Joe's friendship with Charles when it is revealed that he too has a crush on Alice.The conflicts of these relationships play out as the town is under siege from an alien which has escape when the train it is being transported on is derailed by a high school teacher,  Dr. Woodward, who had been involved in secret government projects where the alien had been abused and cruelly treated as scientists were performing tests on it. Joe, Alice, Charles and their other friends witness the train wreck as they are filming their super 8 zombie movie. Soon strange things be happening. Power lines and townspeople begin disappearing along with dogs running away as the military arrive without saying a word to what really was on that train. The military unit searching for the alien is headed by Colonel Nelec who was also part of the team performing tests on the creature in the early 1960s. Joe's father is arrested by Colonel Nelec when he begins asking too many questions. Events take a turn for the worst when Alice is abducted by the alien after an argument with her father.When examining their recently developed film footage of their zombie movie they glimpse the alien creature that has abducted the townspeople, including Alice, and been causing the strange events in town. Joe and his friends proceed to break into the school to find out all they can about this creature by investigating Dr. Woodward's office. Watching films, reading documents and listening to tapes they discover that this alien has been tortured and tested by its human interrogators and its only desire is to repair its ship and go home. At this point the military comes crashing into the school and incarcerating  the kids. While locked in a bus on the way back to where the military has set up camp the creature attacks the bus killing  Colonel Nelec. The children escape unharmed and eventually uncover the lair beneath the water tower where the alien has held the people he abducted and where he is repairing the ship. After setting the people free Joe has a confrontation with the alien telling him its alright ot leave and that he should go. The movie ends with the mysterious cube material repairing his sip and the alien leaves.The cinematography is excellent and the film really captures what it was like to be 14 in 1979. I was about the same age at that and have fond memories of the period. Except for the villain, Colonel Nelec, all the other characters are multidimensional and complex. The relatively unknown actors playing the young kids are very convincing and it comes across very naturally. When they are having lunch together the next day after the train derailment they are trying to discuss the situation but they still can't help but being kids and acting goofy and childlike in their confrontations with one another. It is a delightful scene. I think the stand our performances are from the lead actors, Joel Courtney as Joseph ""Joe"" Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice ""Allie"" Dainard, Kyle Chandler as Jack Lamb Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard, Riley Griffiths as Charles Kaznyk. Elle Fanning  particularly stands out not only in the film itself but as an actress within the zombie movie being filmed. She displays that there is deep acting talent in the Fanning family. The movie has a lot of heart and you really get to see inside of their emotions in the film. You also get to see them change, grow and mature because of the events they face.My only negative complaint about the film is the lack of one relationship. That is the relationship between the alien creature and the children and in turn we the audience. JJ Abrams likes the mystery element to movies and wants to keep the alien a mystery and to a large extent that works. Although the creature is revealed, wonderfully created by Neville Page, it is so late in the film that we never really get a chance to develop any emotional connection to the creature. It is this shadowy figure lurking in the dark in which we only get small glimpses of from time to time. Although we do learn the alien's story in bits and pieces along the way more interactions between the creature and the children would have provided more of an emotional connection. If we had more of a connection to the creature the ending would have provided more of an emotional punch. Plus, to be honest, I am a nerd about these things and monster and alien movies are among my favorite types of science fiction stories so when you have such a great creature design and top notch special effects I would like to see more of the creature! But all in all a very good movie by JJ Abrams and one I will watch over and over.",5,A movie about relationships.,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,6220,"['heavy', 'spoliers', 'relationship', 'movie',

1399763,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004EPYZPS,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[266, 308]","Super 8 is admittedly not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it so much, and was so taken by the characters and the actors playing them, that I didn't really mind the occasional inconsistency or lingering ""awed expressions"" scene.Set in a small town in Ohio in 1979, the basic plot centers around Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a 13-year-old boy whose mother recently died in a factory accident, leaving him with only his father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a sheriff's deputy who's a more than decent man but who has never known how to really be a father. Jackson's escape is burying himself in his work, while Joe's is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make an amateur zombie movie with the help of their other friends Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Cary (Ryan Lee). But Joe's involvement becomes truly committed when Charles persuades Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), a girl he secretly has a crush on, to join the project.Things taken a sudden turn when, in the midst of shooting a midnight scene at the local railroad depot, Joe sees a pickup truck suddenly drive onto the tracks, directly in the path of an oncoming freight train, resulting in a spectacular crash that sends freight cars derailing everywhere and the shocked kids running for cover. The plot quickly thickens when Joe gets a glimpse of something bursting out of one of the freight cars, and when they find the driver of the pickup, badly injured, is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher, who warns them to get away and to never speak of what they've seen to anyone or they - and their parents - will be killed. And then there's the knocked over Super 8 camera that has been continuing to roll throughout everything, capturing something that no one else saw while they were busy tried not to get crushed by flying debris. Something that will become important later as strange things begin to happen:  dogs fleeing the town for no apparent reason, car engines and other pieces of machinery being stolen, people suddenly disappearing. And of course the massive influx of military personnel who are crawling all over everything while their commander, Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) blandly insists that there's _nothing_ going on.The characters are well drawn, fleshed out with real personalities, quirks and flaws, and you very quickly come to care about them.  And the actors, most of them either fairly unknown or newcomers, are marvelous, the kids in particular as they're at the heart of the film, but also the adults, particularly Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the two fathers linked - and separated - by tragedy, each not doing so well at dealing with it. Joel Courtney as Joe has one of those faces that projects everything he's feeling, from the distance he's experiencing with his dad to the secret yet painfully obvious crush he has on Alice. Riley Griffiths as his best friend Charles is a perfect counterpoint, pursuing his film with single-minded determination but holding other things in. Ryan Lee's pint-sized braces-laden (and explosives-crazy) Cary is a riot, as is Gabriel Basso's Martin as the zombie film's leading man who has an unfortunate tendency to puke a lot, while Zach Mills' Preston has the healthiest fear-instinct of the crowd. And last but not least, Elle Fanning's Alice is a wonder, a sensitive girl with her own father issues whose unexpected natural talent at acting leaves the boys with their jaws hanging.Super 8 is highly derivative, but in a good way. It draws on the best parts of any number of movies from the past, most notably E.T. (1982) and The Goonies (1985) but also films like Joe Dante's Explorers (1985) , The Bad News Bears (1976) and, more recently, Son of Rambow (2007), a little seen but marvelous independent British film about a couple of boys with family issues who bond over making an amateur movie.Note:  in one scene, there's a definite tip-of-the-hat prop taken right out of Spielberg's E.T.  Just keep your eyes peeled when the camera closes in on the water tower near the climax of the movie and see if anything looks strikingly familiar.There are admittedly weak points in the film, mainly where it seems uncertain of just which direction it wants to take or where inconsistencies tend to be glaring. Is the alien dangerous and deadly... or just misunderstood? Is the alien killing people... or just holding on to them for a while?  The trouble is that in different parts of the film it's definitely one, but in other parts of the film it's the other.  And the climactic lingering ""awed expressions"" scene does feel at odds with the the life-threatening dangers the characters were experiencing earlier (not to mention the burning shambles half the town has been reduced to). Another weak point is the villain, Col. Nelec (I suspect the name Nelec is an in-joke of some kind), who is never anything but a cliched military bad guy.  But as I said, while these things do keep it from being a perfect film, they don't in the end get in the way from it being an engaging and enjoyable one.Highly recommended for anyone who likes an engaging film that sucks you in and keeps you involved all the way through, and that values story and character over special effects and stars.",4,"Entertaining, engrossing and extra-terrestrial -

It turned out to be an entertaining enough movie, though not quite in the same league with such Spielberg sci-fi classics as E.T. and Close Encounters, and maybe not even as good as Mr. Abrams' update of the Star Trek franchise.  Still, the movie was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed its nod to the '60s 'B' movies where the army is fighting the alien invaders (or giant ants, or whatever).  Plus there was the familiar element of a small town dealing with an unknown threat to its existence.  There were also many heartwarming and/or humorous moments of the type that fans of those previous Spielberg classics will recognize, and the little romance between the two young people was nice.  However, the scenes of the middle school heroes were a bit too repetitive (ex., too many scenes of the young director demanding that they get back to making his movie).  That detracted slightly from my level of entertainment with Super 8.  Also, there is no shortage of special FX shots in this flick, but few of them were noteworthy.  A couple of impressive scenes near the end are an exception to this observation.  Otherwise, it was just a lot of stuff flying through the air, blowing up, and/or getting smashed and knocked around.  Finally, the plot plot just felt a bit too casually thrown together, never fully engaging my interest at the level to make this film truly memorable.  I almost went a star lower with my rating, but I left the theater feeling I'd had a good time, and that was enough to get me to 4 stars.An additional note:  Make sure you stick around for the credits!

This is the case with ""Super 8"", a rough mash-up of ""ET"", ""CE3K"", and ""Jurassic Park"". Had these films never been made, ""Super 8"" would come off as agreeably original. But when all the viewer can do is think of how much ""Super 8"" reminds him of //other// films, something is wrong.""Super 8""'s worst problem is that it depends too heavily on coincidence and obvious foreshadowing. When one of the young film makers displays a proclivity for lighting small fireworks, you //know// it's going to come in handy later. And why is it that the train //just happens// to pass near the community where the man who tries to stop it resides?Spoiler follows.The obvious question of why the Air Force is moving the alien and his paraphernalia is never answered. A plausible explanation is that they're finally going to let him leave. If so, the events of the film are highly ironic. The ""bad guys"" aren't quite so bad, while the ""good guy"" is the person who incites the tragedy. Had ""Super 8"" included this revelation, I'd probably have given it four stars.Michael Giacchino's score is a dud. It comes off as watered-down Williams -- which might have been his intent, a subtle slap at the film itself.In short, ""by the numbers"" movie making. J J Abrams should be ashamed -- and ought to take a refresher course from Robert McKee.PS: A note to the costume department... In a film with millions of dollars of special effects, the wig for the guy playing the hippie salesman is incomprehensibly awful. The ""part"" in the wig appears to be a part of the wig -- not hair growing out of his scalp. John Wayne had better hairpieces 50+ years ago, and Robert Duvall's ""do"" for ""Lonesome Dove"" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for ""Super 8"".",3,derivative and disappointing,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2118,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', '60', 'years', 'little', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'old', 'movie', 'silent', 'film', 'Orphans', 'Storm', '.Movie', 'makers', 'seem', 'think', 'wide', 'availability', 'decades', 'films', 'home', 'video', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'recycling', 'stuff', 'most', 'viewers', 'have', 'seen', 'case', 'Super', '8', 'rough', 'mash-up', 'ET', 'CE3K', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Had', 'films', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'Super', '8', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'agreeably', 'original', 'when', 'viewer', 'can', 'do', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'Super', '8', '//other//', 'films', 'something', 'wrong', 'Super', '8', 'worst', 'problem', 'too', 'heavily', 'coincidence', 'obvious', 'foreshadowing', 'When', 'one', 'young', 'film', 'makers', 'displays', 'proclivity', 'lighting', 'small', 'fireworks', '//know//', 'going', 'come', 'handy', 'later', 'why', 'train', '//just', 'happens//', 'pass', 'community', 'where', 'man', 'who', 'stop', 'resides', 'Spoiler', 'obvious', 'question', 'why', 'Air', 'Force', 'moving', 'alien', 'paraphernalia', 'never', 'answered', 'plausible', 'explanation', ""'re"", 'finally', 'going', 'let', 'leave', 'so', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'highly', 'ironic', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'guy', 'person', 'who', 'tragedy', 'Had', 'Super', '8', 'included', 'revelation', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars.Michael', 'Giacchino', 'score', 'dud', 'off', 'watered-down', 'Williams', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intent', 'subtle', 'slap', 'film', 'itself.In', 'short', 'numbers', 'movie', 'making', 'J', 'J', 'Abrams', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'ought', 'take', 'refresher', 'course', 'Robert', 'McKee.PS', 'note', 'costume', 'department', 'film', 'millions', 'dollars', 'special', 'effects', 'wig', 'guy', 'playing', 'hippie', 'salesman', 'incomprehensibly', 'awful', 'part', 'wig', 'be', 'part', 'wig', 'not', 'hair', 'growing', 'scalp', 'John', 'Wayne', 'had', 'better', 'hairpieces', '50+', 'years', 'ago', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'do', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'undetectable', 'other', 'looking', 'overly', 'neat', 'even', 'Blu-ray', 'film', 'had', 'budget', 'would', ""'ve"", 'barely', 'covered', 'catering', 'Super', '8']",N/A
