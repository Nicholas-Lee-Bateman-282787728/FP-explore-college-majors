Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting and some time co-operating with the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.Combat - Season 3, Operation 1 ~ Vic Morrow",5,This program has unique introductory music,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,872,"['Many', 'programs', 'era', 'had', 'own', 'introductory', 'music', 'program', 'was', 'exception', 'music', 'was', 'Leonard', 'Rosseman.They', 'always', 'start', 'out', 'staring', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Instead', 'great', 'sweeping', 'epics', 'program', 'single', 'squad', 'trials', 'tribulation', 'confronting', 'time', 'co-operating', 'Germans', 'WWII', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'oppose', 'problem', 'solution', 'time', 'was', 'back', 'time', 'professional', 'privates.In', '1967-1968', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'lucky', 'certain', 'areas', 'actually', 'had', 'TV', 'broadcasting', '1600', 'hrs', 'guessed', 'was', 'one', 'programs', 'wonderer', 'what', 'locals', 'thought', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'series', 'own', 'Not', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'portrait', 'program', 'are', 'still', 'today.Combat', 'Season', '3', 'Operation', '1', '~', 'Vic', 'Morrow']",N/A
858187,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00063MCX4,Harry Brewer,"[0, 0]","Television's best war series is Combat! It's full of action but it's the human drama that makes it such a standout series. This set has 16 episodes but they're not in broadcast chronological order.""The Pillbox"" is an intense drama with Lt. Hanley (Rick Jason) being the main character. Warren Oates is the guest star. This was the first Combat! episode that Vic Morrow directed. ""Gideon's Army"" is one of Combat's most chilling episodes. The squad stumbles upon a Polish enforced labor camp. This will remind some people of some very unpleasant incidents from WWII. ""The Hostages"" features Doc (Conlan Carter) as the main character. Carter was actually nominated for an Emmy for his part in this episode. Saunders & Caje have been captured by some German soldiers who are trying to escape from the Allied held French town. Doc has to get a vehicle to help facilitate the escape but nothing goes right. ""The Glory Among Men"" was the final episode of the second season of Combat! It's Vic Morrow's second time directing an episode. He would generally get to direct two episodes a season beginning with the second season. ""The Glory Among Men"" is Combat's most thought provoking episode. While on patrol a member of the squad is severely wounded & is caught in no-man's-land between the Germans & Americans. The problem is that no one in the squad likes the man, in fact, they all detest him. The question is asked: What do you do? Do you leave him there to die or do you attempt to rescue him? It's a tough situation & Morrow handles it well as director.There are some bonus features included in the set that include audio commentaries on selected episodes. There are bloopers, notes & oddities by Jo Davidsmeyer on each episode. This set is highly recommended though set one of the second season is the stronger set.",5,"Combat - Season 2, Mission 2",1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,1815,"['Television', 'best', 'war', 'series', 'Combat', 'full', 'action', 'human', 'drama', 'such', 'standout', 'series', 'set', '16', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'not', 'broadcast', 'chronological', 'order', 'Pillbox', 'intense', 'drama', 'Lt.', 'Hanley', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'guest', 'star', 'was', 'first', 'Combat', 'episode', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'directed', 'Gideon', 'Army', 'one', 'Combat', 'most', 'chilling', 'episodes', 'squad', 'Polish', 'enforced', 'labor', 'camp', 'will', 'remind', 'people', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'incidents', 'WWII', 'Hostages', 'Doc', 'Conlan', 'Carter', 'main', 'character', 'Carter', 'was', 'actually', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'part', 'episode', 'Saunders', 'Caje', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'German', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'Allied', 'held', 'French', 'town', 'Doc', 'get', 'vehicle', 'help', 'facilitate', 'escape', 'nothing', 'right', 'Glory', 'Men', 'was', 'final', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'Combat', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'second', 'time', 'directing', 'episode', 'would', 'generally', 'get', 'direct', 'two', 'season', 'beginning', 'second', 'season', 'Glory', 'Men', 'Combat', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'episode', 'patrol', 'member', 'squad', 'severely', 'wounded', 'caught', ""no-man's-land"", 'Germans', 'Americans', 'problem', 'one', 'squad', 'man', 'fact', 'detest', 'question', 'asked', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'Do', 'leave', 'there', 'die', 'do', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'tough', 'situation', 'Morrow', 'well', 'director.There', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'set', 'include', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'are', 'bloopers', 'notes', 'oddities', 'Jo', 'Davidsmeyer', 'episode', 'set', 'highly', 'recommended', 'set', 'one', 'second', 'season', 'stronger', 'set']",N/A
858188,A1L0MFAIV44H8R,B00063MCX4,hemmingway,"[0, 0]","The 2nd season of Combat is outstanding.  The episode with Beau Bridges has stuck with me since I 1st saw it in the 60's.  Combat never disappointed, it always entertained and was revealing of the WW2 GI's day to day life.  I understand every episode was based on an actual event.  Though not a documentary, Combat shows the types of things our fighting men encountered.  It is inspiring, informative, humorous and it grabs your interest.  The actors went through a week of boot camp to learn how the military does things.  This greatly added to the shows authenticity.  I have shared some episodes with my wife, who had never seen the show before, and she greatly enjoyed them.One episode covers the liberation of some prison camp detainees and touches on their misery.  I highly recommend this whole series that is so good you won't believe how quickly time passes when you watch the shows.

858191,A1Z2MZ9DV1K74T,B00063MCX4,Lawrence Rapchak,"[4, 8]","But here goes, anyway:  My picks for best episodes of ""COMBAT'S"" 2nd season.BRIDGE AT CHALONS -- Riveting performance by Lee Marvin.  I'm not necessarily a fan of these ultra-macho guys, but he's so damn' POWERFUL in this show.GLOW AGAINST THE SKY ---- Very intense and violent.  Of course, had Billy Nelson been wounded this seriously, he would have been shipped home immediately, and never appeared in another ""Combat"".THE WOUNDED DON""T CRY---- Very well done.  Karl Boehm very sympathetic.  The twists and turns near the end will keep you on the edge of your seat.***Suprise ""Hit"" episode:  ""A SILENT CRY""-----typical set-up withmisanthropic soldier (Richard Anderson) whom Saunders gets stuck with. The guy is a braniac who was promoted to Sargeant due to his expertise in radio technology--but he's never been out on a mission. What's more, he's a pacificst/philosopher, who cannot reconcile his lofty ideals with those of men who KILL others in battle.His undoing comes in a beautifully crafted scene, as he works on a radio in a cellar with a young French resistance fighter, who is also an idealistic dreamer.  Amazingly subtle acting, direction, and dialogue.  Of course, when things start getting dangerous, Anderson's idealism is tested in the heat of battle.Predictable, but still a top-notch show (even though the big battle scene behind the furniture is kind of funny).****THE BEST of the 2nd season:  Vic Morrow's ""THE GLORY AMONG MEN"".  Simply unbelievable that a film of this quality was shot in 5 days. Brilliant in every way, and marred only slightly by the somewhat contrived ""OK, now everybody smile"" business at the very end. But what a show!!****WORST --- Rick Jason in ""RESCUE"".  In the latter part of the episode, due to a rifle butt to the jaw, Jason walks around with a grimace that's part Karloff's ""Haunted Strangler"" and part Popeye.  It's just nutty!Also, watch out for ""The Party"", which should have been subtitled ""Combat meets The Keystone Kops"".  And ""What are the Bugles Blowin' For"" which seems to drag on forever---unless this was the director's way of evoking the same sense of TEDIUM in the viewer that the squad feels throughout most of this episode.THE END.",5,Who Cares What I think?,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2199,"['here', 'anyway', 'picks', 'best', 'episodes', 'COMBAT', '2nd', 'season.BRIDGE', 'AT', 'CHALONS', 'Riveting', 'performance', 'Lee', 'Marvin', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'fan', 'ultra-macho', 'guys', 'so', 'damn', 'POWERFUL', 'show.GLOW', 'AGAINST', 'THE', 'SKY', 'Very', 'intense', 'violent', 'course', 'had', 'Billy', 'Nelson', 'been', 'wounded', 'seriously', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shipped', 'home', 'immediately', 'never', 'appeared', 'Combat', '.THE', 'WOUNDED', 'DON', 'T', 'CRY', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'Karl', 'Boehm', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'twists', 'turns', 'end', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', '***Suprise', 'Hit', 'episode', 'SILENT', 'CRY', '-typical', 'set-up', 'withmisanthropic', 'soldier', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'whom', 'Saunders', 'stuck', 'guy', 'braniac', 'who', 'was', 'promoted', 'Sargeant', 'due', 'expertise', 'radio', 'technology', 'never', 'been', 'out', 'mission', 'What', 'more', 'pacificst/philosopher', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'reconcile', 'lofty', 'ideals', 'men', 'who', 'KILL', 'others', 'battle.His', 'undoing', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'scene', 'radio', 'cellar', 'young', 'French', 'resistance', 'fighter', 'who', 'also', 'idealistic', 'dreamer', 'Amazingly', 'subtle', 'acting', 'direction', 'dialogue', 'course', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'dangerous', 'Anderson', 'idealism', 'tested', 'heat', 'battle.Predictable', 'still', 'top-notch', 'show', 'even', 'big', 'battle', 'scene', 'furniture', 'kind', 'funny', '****THE', 'BEST', '2nd', 'season', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'THE', 'GLORY', 'AMONG', 'MEN', 'Simply', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'shot', '5', 'days', 'Brilliant', 'way', 'marred', 'only', 'slightly', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'OK', 'now', 'everybody', 'smile', 'business', 'very', 'end', 'what', 'show', '****WORST', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'RESCUE', 'latter', 'part', 'episode', 'due', 'rifle', 'butt', 'jaw', 'Jason', 'grimace', 'part', 'Karloff', 'Haunted', 'Strangler', 'part', 'Popeye', 'just', 'nutty', 'Also', 'watch', 'out', 'Party', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'subtitled', 'Combat', 'Keystone', 'Kops', 'What', 'are', 'Bugles', 'Blowin', 'drag', 'forever', 'was', 'director', 'way', 'evoking', 'same', 'sense', 'TEDIUM', 'viewer', 'squad', 'feels', 'most', 'episode.THE', 'END']",N/A
