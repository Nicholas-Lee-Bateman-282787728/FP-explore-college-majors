I absolutley fell in love with the male lead...can someone say HOT!!!!!!  I watched the extra features and I wonder why it took Korean audiences 15 years to realize what an amazing talent he is.  Adorable!The female lead was awesome as well.  I really liked how she would be vulnerable and silly yet warm, loving, sweet and smart.  The chemistry between the main characters really made this film one of my favorites.  I enjoyed all the supporting roles too. The story line is great and just when you think you have it figured out, they throw something new at you...very entertaining.The love story is wonderful and I would definately recommend to any Kdrama lovers!!!!!",5,"Love, love, love it!!!!!",1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,758,"['Could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'just', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'funny', 'yet', 'heartwarming', 'absolutley', 'fell', 'love', 'male', 'lead', 'can', 'someone', 'say', 'HOT', 'watched', 'extra', 'features', 'wonder', 'why', 'took', 'Korean', 'audiences', '15', 'years', 'realize', 'what', 'amazing', 'talent', 'Adorable', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'silly', 'yet', 'warm', 'loving', 'sweet', 'smart', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'favorites', 'enjoyed', 'supporting', 'roles', 'too', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'throw', 'something', 'new', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'love', 'story', 'wonderful', 'would', 'definately', 'recommend', 'Kdrama', 'lovers']",N/A

Once you get past the first few episodes that set up the characters it starts to get even better thank you think it would be.  It made me yell at the TV!  LOL!  To me that's a great indicator that it was a good series because it made me get emotionally invested in the characters and their storylines.I get worried sometimes near the end of many Asian dramas and animae because they will kill off main characters at the drop of a hat, so you never know what will happen until the end credits are rolling.  This is a funny and serious drama with a complicated plot line that you discover along the way.  I really liked the two main lead actors.  Excellent acting and great chemistry.  One of the bosses is in the series TEN and I really enjoy the characters he plays.Another thing about Asian shows is the clothing.  Both the women and the men wear very interesting styles.  The lead male had some runway worthy outfits for a lawyer. He doesn't wear just suits, but even then, they are a bit flashy.  The lead female of course had some extremely cute clothes, but the shoes were awesome.  Especially the pair named ""Grace"".  They could have been a character all by themselves!P.S. I loved they way she parked her car at the office everyday!  I approve.",5,The Shoes!  The Fashion! AND...

Do not let the the beginning minutes of superficiality and extravagant glamness discourage you as it actually helps set the character of one of the film's main protagonists.(2.) South Korean studios are fast joining their Indian, Japanese and Chinese counterparts in producing quality movies. As an aside, it's interesting to see the distinctive core personalities of each of these cultures revealed both in how they tell their stories and in what their cultures deem to be significant to showcase on film.(3.) The actor's thought processes and dialogue showed intelligence unlike many Hollywood films where the actor's actions/decisions often make little common sense and are not well thought out. Also, surprising was that the acting by all participants was carried off with great nuanced and emotional skill.(4.) The story itself showed intelligent complexity with layers of intrigue and suspense that reveal themselves in a fluid and timely fashion as the movie progressed thus kudos to the director and writers. The background research for the script was thoughtful and surprisingly accurate; in particular for the legal and investigative scenes.(5.) The cinematography was also surprisingly well done with unusual camera angles to help convey more about the story e.g. the angles to show the holding of hands conveyed more emotion than words or more than the customary standard camera angle.Negative:Jenny's (Jeni) story should have been more complete; seemed scrambled and abruptly tossed in order to fill storyline holes.

The only problem I had with the show was the history they made for her character in regards to her weight. It seemed like a deliberate attempt to copy the success of &#34;200 Pounds Beauty&#34; and it was totally irrelevant to the overall story plot.

1411580,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004JPJ2YC,maskedgamer,"[0, 2]","Prosecutor Princess is a Korean TV Drama about a spoiled rich girl whose CEO father pushes her to become a State Prosecutor to further elevate the families high class status. Ma Hye Ri the fashion crazy spoiled rich girl starts off of her journey into the career world by skipping her post graduation course to go purchase a pair of designer shoes. That is where all the trouble happens and the story begins.Ma Hye Ri, makes the story interesting enough because she is a likeable character. She's not spoiled in the sense that she's rude and stuck up but spoiled in the sense she's been pampered and sheltered most her life so it has made her naive. The show follows her progression as she starts to take herself more seriously and matures as a person. There are a lot of good points to the story but there are also a lot of things in the plot that take away from the series being as good as it could have been.The First 8-9 episodes focus on Ma Hye Ri and her relationship with her co workers, family, and love interests. The later episodes put the buildup of the first 8-9 episodes on hold as it takes a backseat to the sub plot that is supposed to tie the story in together. What I didn't like about the ""sub plot"" is that it wasn't interesting and I wanted to watch a romantic show not a murder mystery story. In the later episodes Ma Hye Ri is almost a completely different person as though the writers forgot to adapt her personality into the story. Maybe it's her progression and maturation as a character but really I think it was just bad writing. She starts out by being a mini skirt wearing, high healed, club going, naive rich girl that sings karaoke in bunny girl outfits (or whatever that was) then all of a sudden she's like Agent Scully from the X files running around doing investigations. I just didn't like the acute character transition and dramatic change in the story.Although the plot was okay it seemed very far fetched and just tied in too conveniently to wrap up the story. Some questions really just remained opened and never really answered. Like what is the nature of Jenny and Woo's relationship. They were long time friends but were they loves at once? Are they friends with benefits? It's obvious that Jenny has some type of romantic feelings for Seo Woo, because she shows her jealously towards Ma Hye Ri on every encounter and even tries to make her think that they slept together. So really what is up with her?I just felt that hers was another story eliminated from the show because it would conflict with the story if she was thrown into the love triangle. Also there's the part of Ma Hye Ri's mother who is obviously stuck in a loveless relationship where she suspects her husband is cheating on her (as shown in the golf range clip) but, that part of her story is sort of washed away when it's been made apparent that she is a housewife in a loveless relationship.The other parts of the story I found to be a problem were the lack of actual romantic story. Throughout the show there really isn't much romantic connection between any of the characters it's mostly just crushes and hints. Ma Hye Ri spends more episodes having a crush on her Prosecutor Co worker than she does actually romantically interacting with him. Then all of sudden that story takes a back seat to the murder mystery. Seo Woo takes the front seat and it takes forever for their relationship to develop more. Even though it's cannon since the beginning of the show, I just disliked his character once the truth was revealed. Seeing that He and his ""Secretary/Girlfriend/Friend with benefit"" looked to Ma Hye Ri as if she was just a piece on a chessboard and they were playing with her fate I didn't feel comfortable seeing the two of them together in a ""romantic"" relationship. Without spoiling the show listing my other reasons I'll leave it at that.Prosecutor Princess is a good Korean show if you look at it based on the acting and the attempt at giving you decent story but I just felt as though they writers didn't try hard enough and made the story come together too easily. Instead of Ma Hye Ri being a ""Princess"" she just adapts to being a normal person instead of trying to make those around her learn to accept her way of doing things like the show started out. That was my biggest problem with the show is that I liked Ma Hye Ri's character but she just seemed to vanish half way through the story.The later episodes break off into a story that I just found uninteresting and like it dragged on longer than it should (mostly because I wasn't interested). What you would think the Plot of the story would be about is The Prosecutor Princess using her fashion senses to help track down the criminal that escaped at the beginning of the show and then falling in love with Yoon in the process as they try to catch him. That made the most sense to make a show based off that idea to me which is what the first 6-7 episodes are basically about and then BAM! out of no where it just comes to a halt,gets resolved and is forgotten then the sub story takes over.For that I rate the movie 3/5. It's show with good characters but a story that could have been executed better.",3,Average but well acted.,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,5185,"['Prosecutor', 'Princess', 'Korean', 'TV', 'Drama',
