Ty really gives his all and you will see many soon to be stars, like Lee Marvin popping up.

Power showed he could act in &#34;The Razor's Edge&#34; and &#34;Nightmare Alley&#34;.  This is a good vehicle to expand his dramatic chops in.  Not a great film but a very enjoyable one with fast pacing and a good cast.
