I personally didn't like the moves (too basic/boring for my taste) and it didn't make me sweat compared to other exercise routines. I think it is okay for beginners. However, I didn't think it was this much low-impact because there are some jumps and you have to twist your feet quite a bit too (be careful with the knees). Using dance shoes may help instead of barefoot.",3,Not low impact,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,405,"['thought', 'dvd', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'moves', 'too', 'basic/boring', 'taste', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sweat', 'compared', 'other', 'exercise', 'routines', 'think', 'okay', 'beginners', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'low-impact', 'are', 'jumps', 'have', 'twist', 'feet', 'quite', 'bit', 'too', 'be', 'careful', 'knees', 'Using', 'dance', 'shoes', 'may', 'help', 'instead', 'barefoot']",Tracey Mallett's Fuse Dance Cardio Melt
1535805,A3H3L1XNS4IN8C,B007PNLIME,CitiGirl,"[0, 0]","I am a major Tracey Mallett FanGirl.  I have all her Booty Barre DVD's.  I am not super coordinated when it comes to exercising along to complicated aerobic dance or aerobic step routines.  First and foremost, I am a klutz so any routine that requires me to learn complicated choreography is a No-Go for me.  However, I know that cardio exercise is a key to heart health and burning fat.  I bought this after reading other reviews on Amazon and another website.  Most everyone had positive reviews for this DVD.  I have done it twice and I really enjoy working out along with the DVD.  I can't do all the moves at the present time but I am working on doing so.  The routine isn't complicated but I have a lot of weight to lose due to having a baby.  Sometimes, I can't keep up with everything she demonstrates but from what I can tell, the routine is not that hard once all the steps are memorized.  Of course, I have to be able to keep up and that is my goal.  I recommend this DVD if you have two left feet and hate dance videos.",5,I hate Aerobic Dance Videos but I love this!,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1031,"['am', 'major', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'FanGirl', 'have', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'super', 'coordinated', 'when', 'exercising', 'along', 'complicated', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'aerobic', 'step', 'routines', 'First', 'foremost', 'am', 'klutz', 'so', 'routine', 'learn', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'No-Go', 'However', 'know', 'cardio', 'exercise', 'key', 'heart', 'health', 'burning', 'fat', 'bought', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'website', 'Most', 'everyone', 'had', 'positive', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'have', 'done', 'twice', 'really', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'moves', 'present', 'time', 'am', 'working', 'doing', 'so', 'routine', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'have', 'lot', 'weight', 'lose', 'due', 'having', 'baby', 'Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'everything', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'routine', 'not', 'hard', 'once', 'steps', 'are', 'memorized', 'course', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'goal', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'hate', 'dance', 'videos']",Tracey Mallett's Fuse Dance Cardio Melt
1535806,A1FVXLTDPR7VOD,B007PNLIME,C. White,"[15, 16]","My favorite things about this workout are Tracey and her background dancers - they are genuinely having fun and are working hard.  Its nice to see especially since two of the ladies are trained dancers and two of them are not.  I personally love Tracey's Booty Barre DVDs as I have a ballet background.  This is a totally different type of ""dance DVD"".The first workout consist of different types of dance circuits ending with cardio intervals.  She chooses dance moves that tend to come naturally to the body.  She takes the time to explain the steps and then puts them all together.  The moves range from funk to ballet.  For the cardio intervals, think football drills and side to side leaps with ballet arms.  It is all low impact.For the second workout, she keeps the dance theme (obviously) and uses light weights to sculpt the arms.  Think ballet and yoga arms - graceful type moves.  Between weight circuits she will throw in some cardio intervals.  These are dance type intervals with lots of hip swings.  Its actually a fun workout.  Something you would want to do with your girlfriends in the living room!

1535807,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B007PNLIME,Leanne,"[4, 5]","I just got done doing this for the first time, and it's another lovely offering from Tracey!  She is her usual darling, encouraging self in this workout, and she makes the workout fun.Part 1 is 30 minutes long and it's a dance cardio section.  The description of this workout states that this section is done in an interval format, but there really weren't intervals in it.  This portion and the second are both done barefoot, so it stays pretty low impact.  I was just a bit disappointed since I was hoping that this would be tougher -- more on the level of the Booty Barre Total New Body workout -- than it was.  It didn't get my heartrate up very high, but it was fun to do.Part 2 is also 30 minutes long, and it's a toning section that alternates weights with cardio bursts.  There was a definite upper-body emphasis to this workout, so I think it would pair nicely with Tracey's other new workout,Tracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Lean.  The moves were also different from either of her more advanced Booty Barre workouts and from Cardio Lean.  The last circuit segment concluded with a side plank move that caught me a bit off guard since that more advanced move didn't seem to fit in with the overall intermediate-level feel of the entire hour.  I used three-pound weights for this part (as do Tracey and the background exercisers), and felt nicely challenged.The music is fine; it's mostly electronic instrumental, with a few vocal tracks mixed in.  It's not music I've heard in any other workouts, which is nice.  There is also one background exerciser who shows modifications for most of the moves, although in a few shots it was hard to see what she was doing.Since I wasn't sure how to combine these two new workouts, I asked Tracey on her Facebook page, and she said that it would be good to alternate them every other day with her other Booty Barre workouts.Overall, this is a fun workout that's nice for days when you don't want to do killer cardio.  I'm glad I got both this and her Cardio Lean workouts, and see myself using them a lot.",4,A fun low-intermediate workout,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2053,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'doing', 'first', 'time', 'lovely', 'offering', 'Tracey', 'usual', 'darling', 'encouraging', 'self', 'workout', 'workout', 'fun.Part', '1', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'dance', 'cardio', 'section', 'description', 'workout', 'section', 'done', 'interval', 'format', 'there', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'intervals', 'portion', 'second', 'are', 'done', 'barefoot', 'pretty', 'low', 'impact', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'tougher', 'more', 'level', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'Total', 'New', 'Body', 'workout', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'heartrate', 'up', 'very', 'high', 'was', 'fun', 'do.Part', '2', 'also', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'toning', 'section', 'weights', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'was', 'definite', 'upper-body', 'emphasis', 'workout', 'think', 'would', 'pair', 'nicely', 'Tracey', 'other', 'new', 'workout', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'FuseDance', 'Cardio', 'Lean', 'moves', 'were', 'also', 'different', 'more', 'advanced', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'workouts', 'Cardio', 'Lean', 'last', 'circuit', 'segment', 'concluded', 'side', 'plank', 'move', 'caught', 'bit', 'off', 'guard', 'more', 'advanced', 'move', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'overall', 'intermediate-level', 'feel', 'entire', 'hour', 'used', 'three-pound', 'weights', 'part', 'do', 'Tracey', 'background', 'exercisers', 'felt', 'nicely', 'challenged.The', 'music', 'fine', 'mostly', 'electronic', 'instrumental', 'few', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'mixed', 'not', 'music', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'workouts', 'nice', 'also', 'one', 'background', 'exerciser', 'who', 'modifications', 'most', 'moves', 'few', 'shots', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing.Since', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'combine', 'two', 'new', 'workouts', 'asked', 'Tracey', 'Facebook', 'page', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'alternate', 'other', 'day', 'other', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'workouts.Overall', 'fun', 'nice', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'killer', 'cardio', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'Cardio', 'Lean', 'workouts', 'see', 'using', 'lot']",Tracey Mallett's Fuse Dance Cardio Melt

I alternate it with the Booty Barre.I was looking for low-impact but effective with muscle toning and fat burning and I think this was a great choice for me. Especially alternating with the Booty Barre I've had great results!Although the description says 2 workouts, I just consider this to be a single hour workout. It seems to me that it was intended to be done as one workout and that the whole ""2 workouts"" thing is just marketing.Part 1 is the cardio dance section and is a fun mix of different kinds of moves. It gets your heart-rate up and gets you warm for part 2.Part 2 is my favorite, I love her toning moves and I always feel I've had a great workout afterwards!

I would say I am burnt out on exercise, but I like Tracey so I thought I would give her latest DVD a try.  I have done it 3 times and can't get through the whole DVD; my thighs start aching.  This is a really good workout; you wouldn't think so by looking at the moves while sitting down but these moves really work you out.The only issue I have is this lady named CHRISTINE; she dances funny and she is distracting.  I don't understand why she was chosen for this video.  Her Salsa is particularly horrible.The BEST move is RIDE THE HORSE; my thi0hs are killing me.  Another great move is the one where you twist your arms and legs (hip hop move).  This DVD is great because the moves are not complicated at all, not strenous at all, or anything like that but if you don't ordinarily work the parts of the body this DVD works you will be tired.  I do about 20 minutes and call it a day.Also great is that she does the moves barefeet which means NOT HIGH IMPACT.I recommend this DVD for people that like to do moves that work the body but you are not huffing and puffing while doing them.My LIVE Zumba class has me huffing and puffing and jumping around and that is definitely too much for the house and my carpet; this is perfect for me and the carpet.",4,Fun little workout!,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1321,"['go', 'Zumba', 'classes', 'have', 'like', '20', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'house', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'burnt', 'out', 'exercise', 'like', 'Tracey', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'latest', 'DVD', 'try', 'have', 'done', '3', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'DVD', 'thighs', 'start', 'aching', 'really', 'good', 'workout', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'looking', 'moves', 'sitting', 'down', 'moves', 'really', 'work', 'out.The', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'lady', 'named', 'CHRISTINE', 'funny', 'distracting', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'chosen', 'video', 'Salsa', 'particularly', 'horrible.The', 'BEST', 'move', 'RIDE', 'THE', 'HORSE', 'thi0hs', 'are', 'killing', 'great', 'move', 'one', 'where', 'twist', 'arms', 'legs', 'hip', 'hop', 'move', 'DVD', 'great', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'not', 'strenous', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'ordinarily', 'work', 'parts', 'body', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'tired', 'do', '20', 'minutes', 'call', 'day.Also', 'great', 'moves', 'barefeet', 'NOT', 'HIGH', 'IMPACT.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'people', 'like', 'do', 'moves', 'work', 'body', 'are', 'not', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'doing', 'them.My', 'LIVE', 'Zumba', 'class', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'jumping', 'around', 'definitely', 'too', 'much', 'house', 'carpet', 'perfect', 'carpet']",Tracey Mallett's Fuse Dance Cardio Melt
