""The Sterile Cuckoo"" has a soft-focus, mildly color-washed-out picture, likely due to the year of the film (1969) and thus some aging to the master. The audio is good. I'm very pleased with this purchase, actually, which is an upgrade to the DVD I already owned.I've definitely seen several 1967-69 blu-ray films that look a lot sharper and better all-around (heck, my DVD--not blu-ray--of 1967's ""Bedazzled"" (Dudley Moore, Raquel Welch) looks much sharper on my HD TV than does ""The Sterile Cuckoo""!).  But, I suspect that ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" was not a big-budget film.Still it's a good, but not better-than-good, blu-ray effort.Fine acting, sentimental, very realistic story.",4,"Fairly good, not great, blu-ray picture",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,810,"['review', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'etc.', 'not', 'how', 'good', 'story', 'acting', 'not', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'soft-focus', 'mildly', 'color-washed-out', 'picture', 'likely', 'due', 'year', 'film', '1969', 'thus', 'aging', 'master', 'audio', 'good', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'purchase', 'actually', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'already', 'owned.I', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'seen', 'several', '1967-69', 'blu-ray', 'films', 'look', 'lot', 'sharper', 'better', 'all-around', 'heck', 'DVD', 'not', 'blu-ray', '1967', 'Bedazzled', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'much', 'sharper', 'HD', 'TV', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'suspect', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'was', 'not', 'big-budget', 'film.Still', 'good', 'not', 'better-than-good', 'blu-ray', 'effort.Fine', 'acting', 'sentimental', 'very', 'realistic', 'story']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS
499888,A2GFDZTGPZL51N,B00000FB1U,Amalgamated Me,"[3, 3]","After years of waiting, this movie was finally released on DVD.  I was put off at first by the fact that the title of the movie was wrong on the packaging - the producers, called Olive Films, had labelled it ""Sterile Cuckoo"" when it is actually ""The Sterile Cuckoo"".  A small detail, admittedly, but still...also - the description blurb on the back cover is almost unreadable as it's white typescript on a yellow background - did no one at Olive Films catch that???That aside, I was glad to see the film itself decently reproduced.  There are no extras at all, just the film and chapters, but that's all right.  My four star review is for the DVD itself, not the film, which I go back and forth on in opinion.  I've seen it many times since my first viewing in 1973, and can't seem to settle on a definitive opinion, so judge for yourself.  Keep in mind that 1969 was a different time than 2012, and while a girl like Pookie now would be put on medication, in her own time she was just marginalized by the ""cool"" kids and ultimately ""sent to the cornfield"" by her first boyfriend.Not for everyone, but certainly unforgettable...",4,Finally in DVD,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1128,"['years', 'waiting', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'fact', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'packaging', 'producers', 'called', 'Olive', 'Films', 'had', 'labelled', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'when', 'actually', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'small', 'detail', 'admittedly', 'still', 'also', 'description', 'blurb', 'back', 'cover', 'almost', 'unreadable', 'white', 'typescript', 'yellow', 'background', 'did', 'one', 'Olive', 'Films', 'catch', 'aside', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'film', 'decently', 'reproduced', 'are', 'extras', 'just', 'film', 'chapters', 'right', 'four', 'star', 'review', 'DVD', 'not', 'film', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'first', 'viewing', '1973', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'settle', 'definitive', 'opinion', 'judge', 'Keep', 'mind', '1969', 'was', 'different', 'time', '2012', 'girl', 'Pookie', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'medication', 'own', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'marginalized', 'cool', 'kids', 'ultimately', 'sent', 'cornfield', 'first', 'boyfriend.Not', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'unforgettable']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS
499889,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000FB1U,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 7]","I kind of all sorts of adore Liza Minnelli.  She has such a warm endearing quality.  She is spunky and witty and charming in a goofy sort of way, but she certainly doesn't lack in the sensual department.  Despite her unconventional appearance, she knew how to make herself more than appealing while in her prime.  Just watch `Cabaret' and tell me you weren't the least bit intrigued.All that said, it took me quote some time to finally see `The Sterile Cuckoo', one of Liza's first big roles.  I sat down to soak it in a few days ago and I'm still giddy with amusement.  I don't mean that to make it sound as if this is a laugh riot because it is not.  `The Sterile Cuckoo' is far from a comedy.  It is a serious and deeply provocative film about the insecurities of a young woman and the mess they make of her relationships.  Sure, the film has its amusing (funny) moments, but they are peppered in over a series of poignant and meaningful interactions.The film tells the story of Mary Ann Adams, better known as Pookie.  When we meet Pookie she is introducing herself to a shy young man named Jerry Payne.  They are both off to college.  Pookie is aggressive and abrupt, but she is endearing.  Pookie finds a way to weasel herself in Jerry's life, and soon the two are dating.  The first half of the film plays out almost like a romantic comedy, but as the second half begins to roll around we see the layers of this film begin to fall away, baring a soul we may not have expected.  As Pookie begins to exhibit strange behavior, her relationship with Jerry starts to fray.  She becomes possessive and spiteful.  She becomes controlling and jealous and erratic.  Jerry starts to pull away, causing a rift between the two that will prove nearly disastrous for young Pookie.What I liked so much about `The Sterile Cuckoo' was that it didn't try so hard.  It simply allowed the audience to pick up on the subtle clues as to Pookie's behavior.  We are never outright told about her life, at least not in a direct `this has messed me up' type manner, but we are given little hints here and there that, when picked up on and spliced together, tell a complete story about this very complicated young woman.I was telling a friend the other day that Pookie Adams may be one of my favorite film characters, ever.  She just has so many beautiful details that make her so relatable and sympathetic.  Despite her apparent flaws (and she has many of them) she is so likable.That likeability comes almost directly from Liza Minnelli's brilliant performance.  The way she handles Pookie is flawless.  She understands how important it is to allow the layers to speak for themselves.  She never forces anything and she completely understands that Pookie's spunky personality is her shield, and she plays it as such, always inserting a manic sense of insecurity in her outlandish behavior.  You can always see that she is scared, even when she puts up the pretense that she is not.  Wendell Burton is also very, very good here.  He plays Jerry straight-laced and nave, but not so much that he becomes unbelievably dense.  Instead, Jerry comes off as insecure, just like Pookie; he just displays it differently.  I was very impressed with Tim McIntire.  With just a few short scenes he was able to create a very lasting impression.  With rugged good looks and a commanding sense of confidence, McIntire creates the perfect `wedge' in Pookie and Jerry's relationship.  What is also so fascinating is that you truly believe him when he allows his insecurities to be made known as well.This is a beautiful film about finding oneself and rising above our past.  Pookie self destructed thanks to an innate need to be loved that was not being met.  Watching her crumble can be heartbreaking, but it is also tragically beautiful.WHERE'S MY DVD TRANSFER?!?!",5,There is nothing `cuckoo' about adoring this masterpiece...,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,3830,"['kind', 'sorts', 'adore', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'warm', 'endearing', 'quality', 'spunky', 'witty', 'charming', 'goofy', 'sort', 'way', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'lack', 'sensual', 'department', 'unconventional', 'appearance', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'prime', 'Just', 'watch', 'Cabaret', 'tell', 'were', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'intrigued.All', 'said', 'took', 'quote', 'time', 'finally', 'see', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'one', 'Liza', 'first', 'big', 'roles', 'sat', 'down', 'soak', 'few', 'days', 'ago', ""'m"", 'still', 'giddy', 'amusement', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'make', 'sound', 'laugh', 'riot', 'not', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'far', 'comedy', 'serious', 'deeply', 'provocative', 'film', 'insecurities', 'young', 'woman', 'mess', 'make', 'relationships', 'Sure', 'film', 'amusing', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'peppered', 'series', 'poignant', 'meaningful', 'interactions.The', 'film', 'story', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Adams', 'better', 'known', 'Pookie', 'When', 'meet', 'Pookie', 'introducing', 'shy', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Payne', 'are', 'college', 'Pookie', 'aggressive', 'abrupt', 'endearing', 'Pookie', 'way', 'weasel', 'Jerry', 'life', 'soon', 'two', 'are', 'dating', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'out', 'almost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', 'roll', 'see', 'layers', 'film', 'begin', 'fall', 'away', 'baring', 'soul', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'Pookie', 'exhibit', 'strange', 'behavior', 'relationship', 'Jerry', 'fray', 'possessive', 'spiteful', 'controlling', 'jealous', 'erratic', 'Jerry', 'pull', 'away', 'causing', 'rift', 'two', 'will', 'prove', 'nearly', 'disastrous', 'young', 'Pookie.What', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'simply', 'allowed', 'audience', 'pick', 'up', 'subtle', 'clues', 'Pookie', 'behavior', 'are', 'never', 'outright', 'told', 'life', 'least', 'not', 'direct', 'messed', 'type', 'manner', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'spliced', 'together', 'tell', 'complete', 'story', 'very', 'complicated', 'young', 'woman.I', 'was', 'telling', 'friend', 'other', 'day', 'Pookie', 'Adams', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'characters', 'ever', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'beautiful', 'details', 'make', 'so', 'relatable', 'sympathetic', 'apparent', 'flaws', 'many', 'so', 'likable.That', 'likeability', 'almost', 'directly', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'way', 'Pookie', 'flawless', 'how', 'important', 'allow', 'layers', 'speak', 'never', 'forces', 'anything', 'completely', 'Pookie', 'spunky', 'personality', 'shield', 'such', 'always', 'inserting', 'manic', 'sense', 'insecurity', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'can', 'always', 'see', 'scared', 'even', 'when', 'up', 'pretense', 'not', 'Wendell', 'Burton', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Jerry', 'straight-laced', 'nave', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'unbelievably', 'dense', 'Instead', 'Jerry', 'off', 'insecure', 'just', 'Pookie', 'just', 'displays', 'differently', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'very', 'lasting', 'impression', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'commanding', 'sense', 'confidence', 'McIntire', 'perfect', 'wedge', 'Pookie', 'Jerry', 'relationship', 'What', 'also', 'so', 'fascinating', 'truly', 'believe', 'when', 'insecurities', 'be', 'made', 'known', 'well.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'finding', 'rising', 'past', 'Pookie', 'destructed', 'thanks', 'innate', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'met', 'Watching', 'crumble', 'can', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'also', 'tragically', 'beautiful.WHERE', 'MY', 'DVD', 'TRANSFER']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS
499890,AIE9VQPM8UHPH,B00000FB1U,Arcadia Ranch,"[4, 4]","Pookie Adams is an 18-year-old heading off to her first year at college. She meets another new freshman, Jerry Payne, on the bus. Jerry is a shy boy who will be majoring in biology with the intention of pursuing the study of insects. He is initially put off by Pookie's brash behavior and incessant conversation that flits from one topic to another like a butterfly. But she pursues him, visiting him at his college for a weekend and writing him endless letters. Eventually he is charmed by her smile, her wit, and her vivacious personality. They fall into an affair and life is briefly magical. But Jerry begins to realize that Pookie wants every minute of his life and attention all to herself. He sees that he is in a relationship that will suffocate him and he breaks it off as gently as he is able. In the heartbreaking final scene, he helps her board a bus that will take her home and watches sadly as the bus pulls away. Liza Minnelli's portrayal of the mercurial Pookie, who is haunted by the fact that her mother died giving birth to her, and that her father has always resented her for it, received a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Wendell Burton, who played Jerry Payne, is equally impressive as the inexperienced boy drawn into a relationship that he is ultimately unable to cope with. The goodness and innocence of both lead characters magnifies the pain they unintentionally inflict on each other. The movie's theme song, ""Come Saturday Morning,"" also Oscar nominated, seems almost to have been written for this story and adds beautifully to the magic.

It evoked so many emotions that I was uncomfortable with some of my feelings.  This is especially true when Pookie was vulnerable - because I cared about her and I did not want her to be hurt.  Pookie is a conflicted character.  Underneath her outgoing behavior is a young lady in much pain - and I could sense her pain throughout the story.  Note that Liza showed incredible acting talent to pull off Pookie's inner conflicts.Character-driven all the way, this is an important story that all young people should see.

Quiet and so unsure but firm as a straught arrow.You could almost say this is just a plain old love story.But it is about moods.You never see a classroom at the college, only the dorms and the student boardinghouse, the bar and the surrounding countryside.The mood is somber; as if that rural area excused itself from the world and settled down to leaf-strewn environs and navel gazing.

499901,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00000FB1U,JGC,"[5, 5]","I just got through reading a book about Liza the other today (the book was lousy) but it described ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" which I have never seen or heard of before. I looked online for it and all I could find was the used copies on this site for eighteen bucks. So imagine my surprise when it came on TCM this week. What luck, right?Wendell Burton was the perfect actor to play the role of Jerry because he did everything I expected him to do and in a way he did everything that I wanted him to do. And Liza did such a first-rate job as Pookie because she gave this young lady life and body and comedy and character and sorrow. There was something very touching (and perhaps even rather tragic) to this creature. Because Pookie was the type of person that drew people to her with one hand (she craved attention and affection) while simultaneously pushing them away with the other. It was like breathing, she just couldn't help it.My favorite part was the scene when they went to that little roadside motel. It was absolutely hysterical because Pookie was so into it and good girls (especially girls from the nineteen-sixties) were always supposed to suppress their feelings. To see such a brazen act on film was a real shocker. I love how she ordered Jerry to ""peal the tomato."" When I first saw Pookie with those black granny-glasses she totally resembled Paul Pfeiffer from ""The Wonder Years"". But after she hops into that squeaky bed I saw an innocence in her that otherwise went undetected. And after it was all finished she felt sad. No, not guilty-sad, but pensive-sad. Like Pookie explained to Jerry ""it's too perfect"" and as we all know there is no such thing as perfect.The movie is very haunting, perhaps because there is something extraordinarily familiar about both Pookie and Jerry. Jerry reminded me of every guy I've ever known. And Pookie was like that crazy girl in college that never wanted to do what anyone else did and always showed up late everywhere and was always terribly disorganized but was still capable to cleaning up her act every once in a while.It's no surprise that Liza was nominated for her first Oscar because her alter-ego runs the gamut of funny, obsessive, hysterical and desperate. The scene with her on the phone with Jerry, pleading to spend Easter vacation with him (while he studies because he received some ""flunk-notices"") really showed the type of person Pookie truly was. She was so terrified of being alone. She was downright afraid of being one of the countless causalities in this world that swallows people up whole and throws them away, without a second thought. I could feel her anguish and frustration as she begged and pleaded with Jerry. But Pookie really didn't need to say a word for the audience to get it because everything was clearly written all over her plaintive face.The soundtrack music was incredibly penetrating. I don't know if it was original music for this movie but it sure sounded like a perfect fit. BTW the song included on the soundtrack is ""Come Saturday Morning"" by The Sandpippers. According to Wikipedia the song peaked at #17 in 1970. And, it is available on thisCD.""The Sterile Cuckoo"" tells me so much. Not blatantly or overtly because both Jerry and even Pookie were more or less introverted when it came to sharing their true emotions and feelings. Sure, Pookie could run around and act like a clown because that was a lot easier than letting society meet that scared and insecure person that lived within her body and mind. You have to read between the lines though and everything is as plain as night.There must have been a very pronounced part of Pookie that probably felt unloved and incomplete because she saw the world so differently. Everyone around her was weird and strange. I think that was her way of putting up a wall because she didn't know how to allow anyone into her world because deep down she knew that she was the oddball. She finally let Jerry see her like no one else ever did before. And he said he loved her. But did he really? Do any of them love any of us that much? Or do they just want to feel a warm body and hear a heartbeat?",5,running with scissors,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,4139,"['just', 'got', 'reading', 'book', 'Liza', 'other', 'today', 'book', 'was', 'lousy', 'described', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'looked', 'online', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'used', 'copies', 'site', 'eighteen', 'bucks', 'So', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'came', 'TCM', 'week', 'What', 'luck', 'right', 'Wendell', 'Burton', 'was', 'perfect', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'Jerry', 'did', 'everything', 'expected', 'do', 'way', 'did', 'everything', 'wanted', 'do', 'Liza', 'did', 'first-rate', 'job', 'Pookie', 'gave', 'young', 'lady', 'life', 'body', 'comedy', 'character', 'sorrow', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'touching', 'perhaps', 'even', 'rather', 'tragic', 'creature', 'Pookie', 'was', 'type', 'person', 'drew', 'people', 'one', 'hand', 'craved', 'attention', 'affection', 'simultaneously', 'pushing', 'away', 'other', 'was', 'breathing', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'it.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'went', 'little', 'roadside', 'motel', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Pookie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'girls', 'especially', 'girls', 'nineteen-sixties', 'were', 'always', 'supposed', 'suppress', 'feelings', 'see', 'such', 'brazen', 'act', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'shocker', 'love', 'how', 'ordered', 'Jerry', 'peal', 'tomato', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Pookie', 'black', 'granny-glasses', 'totally', 'resembled', 'Paul', 'Pfeiffer', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'squeaky', 'bed', 'saw', 'innocence', 'otherwise', 'went', 'undetected', 'was', 'finished', 'felt', 'sad', 'No', 'not', 'guilty-sad', 'pensive-sad', 'Pookie', 'explained', 'Jerry', 'too', 'perfect', 'know', 'such', 'thing', 'perfect.The', 'movie', 'very', 'haunting', 'perhaps', 'something', 'extraordinarily', 'familiar', 'Pookie', 'Jerry', 'Jerry', 'reminded', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'Pookie', 'was', 'crazy', 'girl', 'college', 'never', 'wanted', 'do', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'did', 'always', 'showed', 'up', 'late', 'everywhere', 'was', 'always', 'terribly', 'disorganized', 'was', 'still', 'capable', 'cleaning', 'up', 'act', 'once', 'while.It', 'surprise', 'Liza', 'was', 'nominated', 'first', 'Oscar', 'alter-ego', 'gamut', 'funny', 'obsessive', 'hysterical', 'desperate', 'scene', 'phone', 'Jerry', 'pleading', 'spend', 'Easter', 'vacation', 'studies', 'received', 'flunk-notices', 'really', 'showed', 'type', 'person', 'Pookie', 'truly', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'terrified', 'being', 'alone', 'was', 'downright', 'afraid', 'being', 'one', 'countless', 'causalities', 'world', 'people', 'whole', 'away', 'second', 'thought', 'could', 'feel', 'anguish', 'frustration', 'begged', 'pleaded', 'Jerry', 'Pookie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'word', 'audience', 'get', 'everything', 'was', 'clearly', 'written', 'plaintive', 'face.The', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'was', 'incredibly', 'penetrating', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'original', 'music', 'movie', 'sure', 'sounded', 'perfect', 'fit', 'song', 'included', 'soundtrack', 'Come', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Sandpippers', 'According', 'Wikipedia', 'song', 'peaked', '17', '1970', 'available', 'thisCD', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'blatantly', 'overtly', 'Jerry', 'even', 'Pookie', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'introverted', 'when', 'came', 'sharing', 'true', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'Sure', 'Pookie', 'could', 'run', 'around', 'act', 'clown', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'letting', 'society', 'meet', 'scared', 'insecure', 'person', 'lived', 'body', 'mind', 'have', 'read', 'lines', 'everything', 'as', 'plain', 'night.There', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'pronounced', 'part', 'Pookie', 'probably', 'felt', 'unloved', 'incomplete', 'saw', 'world', 'so', 'differently', 'Everyone', 'was', 'weird', 'strange', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'putting', 'up', 'wall', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'allow', 'anyone', 'world', 'deep', 'knew', 'was', 'oddball', 'finally', 'let', 'Jerry', 'see', 'one', 'else', 'ever', 'did', 'said', 'loved', 'did', 'really', 'Do', 'love', 'much', 'do', 'just', 'want', 'feel', 'warm', 'body', 'hear', 'heartbeat']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS

Pakula (Klute, Starting Over) is a fairly straightforward, bittersweet tale of first love represented as a touching, coming-of-age character study. Soft-spoken biology major Jerry Payne (Wendell Burton) encounters bespectacled oddball, Pookie Adams (Liza Minnelli) as both are waiting for a bus to take them to their first semesters at neighboring colleges. The extroverted but socially awkward Pookie either misinterprets Jerry's passive malleability as interest or willfully disregards the possible indifference masked by his mostly silent countenance, and insists that the two share a mutual attraction (&#34;We got along terrifically on the bus!&#34; she asserts). Pookie, an outcast who aggressively overcompensates and guards her lonely vulnerability behind the labeling of others as &#8220;creeps,&#8221; &#8220;weirdos,&#8221; or &#8220;bad eggs,&#8221; is clearly drawn to the nice, button-down sweetness of the biology major, but one senses that she's a type who habitually latches onto strangers.

That, however, was before I caught this 1969 Gem, 'The Sterile Cuckoo', on Sky Classics.Beautifully-directed by Alan Pakula in that strange, isolated, stereotypical 1960's-flick style, 'The Sterile Cuckoo' tells the bittersweet, emotionally macabre tale of anally-retentive college freshman Jerry Payne (Wendell Burton), and his intense relationship with the scatterbrained, maniacal Pookie Adams (Liza Minnelli), an enigmatic and energetic girl with a sad past.Liza's first Oscar nomination was very thoroughly deserved. Even as late as 1969 the Oscars were not yet the meaningless PR-Fest that we now know them to be, and it's nominations for odd, thought-provoking performances like Minnelli's, here, that restores our faith in that system. She's absorbing and heart-wrenching, infuriating and devastating, all at the same time. Her perfect foil comes in the guise of the extremely skillfull performance turned in by Wendell Burton, in the role of her hapless boyfriend Jerry. He's the ideal contrast to Minnelli's mania, and though we are oftentimes infuriated by his apathy, we can't help but simultaneously sympathise with him.Pakula's direction is excellent. The vistas are beautiful; simple and isolated, with so much 'New England' jumping from the screen as to make you all but feel the leaves crunching beneath your feet. The sparse countryside, punctuated by violent outbursts of colour, is the perfect metaphor for the central relationship, and Pakula makes extremely clever use of this in the scenes of Pookie and Jerry's early relationship.A classic slice of 60's ideal surrealism, this is a beautifully-crafted, emotionally absorbing movie that REALLY should be on DVD by now.

The story reflects many attitudes of college students of the times, many of the typical situations students were involved in at the time.  Also the main character, played by Liza Minnelli, who was wonderful in the role, was an odd ball and had difficulty relating to her peers in almost every way.  It's a character probably every student can relate to, no matter what generation.  It's funny at times and sad at times.  She finds a boyfriend, who at first finds her odd, then gets along with her because he also feels out of place at college at first like she does.  Eventually he does blend in and he outgrows her, and he gently tries to break off with her, leaving her quite upset she can not handle it.  She ends up leaving college, and the viewer is left to wonder what will happen to her and hopes she adapts to life.  A great, great film, highly recommended.

Pakula also stages a very funny and bleak fraternity party that turns into the sort of beery roughhouse, which to freshmen might pass for an orgy.Pookie embarrasses Jerry in public with her manic-depressive symptoms and attack on the `weirdos'. Also very good is Tim McIntire as Jerry's kind of typical frat boy loutish roommate.Jerry is getting closer to the `weirdos' and drifts away from Pookie as he makes his way into the world.Need doesn't translate into true love,though it translates into lust for a while.Its also very moving like when Pookie makes the phone call to salvage what is left of their love or Jerry very gently has to let her down,still caring and enquiring about her.It uncomfortably reminds us of our own early experiences and search for love.There is a gentle wistfulness to the music Come Saturday Morning and the centrepiece is the landscape shot in upstate New York and in spring, summer, and autumn it is heavenly with the greens and autumn changes in the leaves. The sound mix suffers when Alan J. Pakula and company shoot outside (Liza Minnelli is nearly inaudible when Pookie and Jerry wander through the cemetery). Subtitles could have compensated for that loss. Pakula's directorial debut takes a done-to-death story template and revitalizes it with intelligence, maturity, and tenderness.A refreshing work that shows the quality of late 60s early 70s American cinema and Pakula's 1st,before the French took over.",4,"""Its's going to be nice to get away from all these weirdos"".",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2283,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'late', '60s.Minelli', 'Pookie', 'Adams', 'quite', 'incredible.A', 'damaged', 'teenager', 'going', 'college', 'hooking', 'up', 'reserved', 'young', 'student', 'Jerry', 'Payne', 'Wendell', 'Burton', '.Her', 'desperation', 'lonely', 'background', 'desire', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'weirdos', 'be', 'taken', 'one', 'wing.She', 'kooky', 'Jerry', 'energy', 'animation', 'humour', 'bring', 'shell', '1st', 'few', 'months', 'school.He', 'reprieve', 'father', 'who', 'held', 'responsible', 'mother', 'early', 'death.The', 'film', 'shot', 'straightforwardness', 'honesty', 'indie', 'charm', 'in.The', 'scene', 'where', 'go', 'motel', 'cold', 'Jerry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'light', 'fire', 'Pookie', 'clothes', 'up', 'chair', 'snuggle', 'up', 'creaky', 'bed', 'Pakula', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'bleak', 'fraternity', 'party', 'sort', 'beery', 'roughhouse', 'freshmen', 'might', 'pass', 'orgy.Pookie', 'Jerry', 'public', 'manic-depressive', 'symptoms', 'attack', 'weirdos', 'Also', 'very', 'good', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'Jerry', 'kind', 'typical', 'frat', 'boy', 'loutish', 'roommate.Jerry', 'getting', 'closer', 'weirdos', 'drifts', 'away', 'Pookie', 'way', 'world.Need', ""n't"", 'translate', 'true', 'love', 'lust', 'while.Its', 'also', 'very', 'moving', 'when', 'Pookie', 'phone', 'call', 'salvage', 'what', 'left', 'love', 'Jerry', 'very', 'gently', 'let', 'down', 'still', 'caring', 'enquiring', 'her.It', 'uncomfortably', 'own', 'early', 'experiences', 'search', 'love.There', 'gentle', 'wistfulness', 'music', 'Come', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'centrepiece', 'landscape', 'shot', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'spring', 'summer', 'autumn', 'heavenly', 'greens', 'autumn', 'changes', 'leaves', 'sound', 'mix', 'suffers', 'when', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'company', 'shoot', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'nearly', 'inaudible', 'when', 'Pookie', 'Jerry', 'wander', 'cemetery', 'Subtitles', 'could', 'have', 'compensated', 'loss', 'Pakula', 'directorial', 'debut', 'done-to-death', 'story', 'template', 'intelligence', 'maturity', 'tenderness.A', 'refreshing', 'work', 'quality', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'American', 'cinema', 'Pakula', '1st', 'French', 'took', 'over']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS

That's unfortunate, because I think that I would have really benefited from seeing this movie as a young person--and gotten a sort of heads-up on the problems that come with a serious relationship.In other reviews and descriptions of this film, the situation is described as one in which the reserved and quiet Jerry outgrows his kooky and impulsive girlfriend Pookie.  I think, however, that the breakup occurs for a rather different reason.  It is more that Jerry is worn down by Pookie.  He just can't take this kind of erratic behavior any more--especially since he is a college student majoring in a difficult subject (biology) and needs to study and get some work done!  The turning point, where he begins to realize that this relationship is ultimately untenable, is the scene in which Pookie has something like a manic episode at a house party given by Jerry's college friends and housemates.  Pookie berates and insults everybody she can think of, including Jerry's friend and roommate Charlie (who she sort of flirts with as well), which is terribly embarrassing and hurtful for Jerry.  A guy doesn't get over this kind of thing very easily!  If Pookie had done something as grossly embarrassing as this to him in public at an earlier stage of their relationship, the breakup would have come much more quickly than it did in this movie!  Once it happened, such an event would play like a Youtube video in his mind in a never ending loop--over and over again--especially when attempting to study dry academic subjects!Pookie apologizes--but it was too little too late.  Jerry knows that Pookie's erratic behavior will continue.  And even when she appears stable, he has to be waiting for the next shoe to drop.  In the end, Jerry is not angry at Pookie--he still clearly cares for her--he just can't continue to deal with her day in and day out.  The continuation and temptation of an emotionally-intense physical relationship would also be troubling, as he would fear being held emotionally hostage by a person who might blow up at him any moment.  Essentially, Jerry decides to opt out of the relationship just to avoid being hurt any further.It is probably true that Jerry benefited from meeting Pookie.  A reserved guy like him probably needed a girl who worked so hard to get his attention--and who refused to accept his desire to retreat and isolate himself.  After this relationship he would probably be able to respond to the more subtle overtures from girls who are less confrontational and better emotionally balanced.In the end, I found this to be an interesting movie that does a good job showing how this kind of relationship plays out.  From other people's comments I gather that this kind of dramatic first love is fairly typical.  One's first deep relationship, however, can still be heart-wrenching without one's significant other being as unstable as poor Pookie!",5,Quiet and reserved college freshman guy worn down by impulsive and unstable girlfriend,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,3093,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'year', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'familiar', 'song', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'heard', 'movie', 'saw', 'just', 'now', 'unfortunate', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'benefited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'young', 'person', 'gotten', 'sort', 'heads-up', 'problems', 'come', 'serious', 'relationship.In', 'other', 'reviews', 'descriptions', 'film', 'situation', 'described', 'one', 'reserved', 'quiet', 'Jerry', 'kooky', 'impulsive', 'girlfriend', 'Pookie', 'think', 'however', 'breakup', 'rather', 'different', 'reason', 'more', 'Jerry', 'worn', 'down', 'Pookie', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'kind', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'more', 'especially', 'college', 'student', 'majoring', 'difficult', 'subject', 'biology', 'study', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'realize', 'relationship', 'ultimately', 'untenable', 'scene', 'Pookie', 'something', 'manic', 'episode', 'house', 'party', 'given', 'Jerry', 'college', 'friends', 'housemates', 'Pookie', 'berates', 'insults', 'everybody', 'can', 'think', 'including', 'Jerry', 'friend', 'roommate', 'Charlie', 'who', 'sort', 'flirts', 'as', 'well', 'terribly', 'embarrassing', 'hurtful', 'Jerry', 'guy', ""n't"", 'get', 'kind', 'thing', 'very', 'easily', 'Pookie', 'had', 'done', 'something', 'grossly', 'embarrassing', 'public', 'earlier', 'stage', 'relationship', 'breakup', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'did', 'movie', 'happened', 'event', 'would', 'play', 'Youtube', 'video', 'mind', 'never', 'ending', 'loop', 'over', 'again', 'especially', 'when', 'attempting', 'study', 'dry', 'academic', 'subjects', 'Pookie', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Jerry', 'Pookie', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'will', 'continue', 'even', 'when', 'stable', 'be', 'waiting', 'next', 'shoe', 'drop', 'end', 'Jerry', 'not', 'angry', 'Pookie', 'still', 'clearly', 'cares', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'deal', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'continuation', 'temptation', 'emotionally-intense', 'physical', 'relationship', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'troubling', 'would', 'fear', 'being', 'held', 'emotionally', 'hostage', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'blow', 'up', 'moment', 'Essentially', 'Jerry', 'opt', 'relationship', 'just', 'avoid', 'being', 'hurt', 'further.It', 'probably', 'true', 'Jerry', 'benefited', 'meeting', 'Pookie', 'reserved', 'guy', 'probably', 'needed', 'girl', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'attention', 'who', 'refused', 'accept', 'desire', 'retreat', 'isolate', 'relationship', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'respond', 'more', 'subtle', 'overtures', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'confrontational', 'better', 'emotionally', 'end', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'kind', 'relationship', 'out', 'other', 'people', 'comments', 'gather', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'first', 'love', 'fairly', 'typical', 'One', 'first', 'deep', 'relationship', 'however', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'heart-wrenching', 'one', 'significant', 'other', 'being', 'as', 'unstable', 'poor', 'Pookie']",The Sterile Cuckoo VHS

More's the pity, because this is a beautifully tender story of first love & its inevitable ending, which deserves to be seen. Liza Minnelli is unafraid to play the eccentric, lonely Pookie as needy & infuriating when required. Yet we never lose our sympathy for her, especially as we realize that Wendell Burton's shy, introverted Jerry is gradually outgrowing her. She's exactly what he needed to break out of his shell, and he clearly understands this ... but he sees that they're destined to go different ways before she does (or before she'll admit it to herself). Minnelli & Burton are superb together, utterly convincing in their wistful, somewhat lost, always searching way. And Tim McIntire's supporting performance as Jerry's boastful roommate, who surprises us with a heartfelt confession on a night drive home, is a small gem in its own right.
