My wife was really starting to get into it and I finally caved and started watching it on youtube with her. I quickly got sucked in on this amazing journey that Ewan and Charlie take, and without sounding too sensational, sometimes you really do feel as if you are taking the journey with them!Their banter is totally off the cuff, and nothing (dialogue-wise) seems staged, and yet they both are hilarious! I had never hear of Charlie Boorman before this documentary, but take my word for it - he is extremely funny and totally lovable. It is refreshing to see Ewan McGregor outside of the spotlight...I always enjoy finding out that celebrities I admire have qualities that transcend the silver screen. You can see this by the way he cares for his wife and children, and his genuine love for the people he meets. Also he makes fun of Starwars fans, which doesn't surprise me and makes him even more relatable in my book.My wife and I normally don't watch things with too much profanity in them, but I have to be honest the vulgarity is missing when Ewan and Charlie curse...we just end up chuckling. That said, parents should probably watch this before deciding whether it is suitable for their children.My ONLY gripe with this set is that they have taken out parts that were originally included in the BBC episodes and used some of them for ""extra footage"". That said, at least the footage is included, and because of that I can't really complain too much. This is the reason for the star I knocked off, but to be honest it should be closer to half.Overall, this is a great set. If you haven't seen any of this, trust me when I say that you will want both of them. The general concept is the same, but the experiences are totally different due to the diversity of cultures and scenery!You will love the heart that these guys share for the open road and the people they meet by chance along the way. You will be jealous, I promise.Totally recommended!",4,Captivating and amusing!,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,2014,"['Ok', 'so', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'super', 'big', 'series', 'first', 'wife', 'was', 'really', 'starting', 'get', 'finally', 'caved', 'started', 'watching', 'youtube', 'quickly', 'got', 'sucked', 'amazing', 'journey', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'take', 'sounding', 'too', 'sensational', 'sometimes', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'are', 'taking', 'journey', 'banter', 'totally', 'cuff', 'nothing', 'dialogue-wise', 'staged', 'yet', 'are', 'hilarious', 'had', 'never', 'hear', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'documentary', 'take', 'word', 'extremely', 'funny', 'totally', 'lovable', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'spotlight', 'always', 'enjoy', 'finding', 'out', 'celebrities', 'admire', 'have', 'qualities', 'transcend', 'silver', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'wife', 'children', 'genuine', 'love', 'people', 'Also', 'fun', 'Starwars', 'fans', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'even', 'more', 'relatable', 'book.My', 'wife', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'things', 'too', 'much', 'profanity', 'have', 'be', 'vulgarity', 'missing', 'when', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'curse', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'chuckling', 'said', 'parents', 'should', 'probably', 'watch', 'deciding', 'suitable', 'children.My', 'ONLY', 'gripe', 'set', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'parts', 'were', 'originally', 'included', 'BBC', 'episodes', 'used', 'extra', 'footage', 'said', 'least', 'footage', 'included', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'reason', 'star', 'knocked', 'off', 'be', 'honest', 'should', 'be', 'closer', 'half.Overall', 'great', 'set', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'will', 'want', 'general', 'concept', 'same', 'experiences', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'due', 'diversity', 'cultures', 'scenery', 'will', 'love', 'heart', 'guys', 'share', 'open', 'road', 'people', 'meet', 'chance', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'jealous', 'promise.Totally', 'recommended']",Long Way Down & Long Way Round Complete Series - 6 Disc Set
