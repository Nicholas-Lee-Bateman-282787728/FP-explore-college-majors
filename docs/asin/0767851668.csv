Unfortunately, at times she picks very poor movies in which to show these qualities.  This movie is quite frankly one of the worst I have seen  in years, and if it weren't for Ashley, I would have stopped watching  before the it-couldn't-come-soon-enough end.The story of some British  spy/law enforcement/who knows what (played by Ewan McGregor), who ends up  on the trail of a serial killer (Judd).  Soon enough, he falls in love with  her and acts as her guardian angel.  This could have been a good movie, but  the story is poorly told, the actors other than Judd give very poor  performances, and the result is a boring movie that despite its twists and  turns is just about as exciting as watching paint dry.McGregor is an  otherwise fine actor who doesn't really show much here.  In support, k.d.  lang shows why she is more well known as a singer by acting about as well  as a block of wood.  (Why do otherwise successfull singers try to be  actors?)  Stephan Elliot does nothing and Kieth Claude Russell should be  locked up for life for his part in this movie.Do yourself a favor and  avoid this one at all costs.  Even if you are the biggest Ashley Judd fan  in the world, you will not find anything worth while about this one.",2,Both Stars For Ashley - The Rest Get Zero,960076800,"06 4, 2000",2000,1320,"['Ashley', 'Judd', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actresses', 'world', 'today', 'Unfortunately', 'times', 'very', 'poor', 'movies', 'show', 'qualities', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'worst', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'were', ""n't"", 'Ashley', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'watching', ""it-couldn't-come-soon-enough"", 'end.The', 'story', 'British', 'spy/law', 'enforcement/who', 'what', 'played', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'up', 'trail', 'serial', 'killer', 'Judd', 'Soon', 'enough', 'love', 'guardian', 'angel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'poorly', 'told', 'actors', 'other', 'Judd', 'give', 'very', 'poor', 'performances', 'result', 'boring', 'movie', 'twists', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'exciting', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry.McGregor', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'much', 'here', 'support', 'k.d', 'lang', 'why', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'singer', 'acting', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'block', 'wood', 'Why', 'do', 'otherwise', 'successfull', 'singers', 'try', 'be', 'actors', 'Stephan', 'Elliot', 'nothing', 'Kieth', 'Claude', 'Russell', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'life', 'part', 'movie.Do', 'favor', 'avoid', 'one', 'costs', 'Even', 'are', 'biggest', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'fan', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'worth', 'one']",N/A

McGregor surpasses himself as the secret agent, haunted by the  disappearence of his child who gets obsessed by e beautiful muderess (an  equally good part by Judd). The story itself seems rather pointless in the  beginning, but as the obsession starts to become mutual the bits and peaces  fall nicely into place. Even if the end seems rather unlikely it has at  least a ring of justice to it, which makes for a nice redeaming factor in  story about people, who started out as lost causes. Stephen Elliott too is  to be commended. Most directors loose their grip halfway through a somewhat  mystic story like this, but he has managed to keep averything under  control, right to the end.",4,"A very interesting movie, quite unique.",958348800,"05 15, 2000",2000,845,"['Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Mysticisme', 'tend', 'dump', 'movie', 'direction', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'away', 'very', 'nicely', 'McGregor', 'secret', 'agent', 'haunted', 'disappearence', 'child', 'who', 'obsessed', 'e', 'beautiful', 'muderess', 'equally', 'good', 'part', 'Judd', 'story', 'rather', 'pointless', 'beginning', 'obsession', 'become', 'mutual', 'bits', 'peaces', 'fall', 'nicely', 'place', 'Even', 'end', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'least', 'ring', 'justice', 'nice', 'redeaming', 'factor', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'lost', 'causes', 'Stephen', 'Elliott', 'too', 'be', 'commended', 'Most', 'directors', 'loose', 'grip', 'halfway', 'somewhat', 'mystic', 'story', 'managed', 'keep', 'averything', 'control', 'right', 'end']",N/A

A good thriller calls for good character development, something which this movie plainly ignores. And no, a one-minute flash-back by Judd in the middle of the movie is NOT good character development in my book.Still the movies begins with much promise - a secret agent doing surveillance on a suspect is instead becomes a witness to his death by a smart, beautiful, and obviously dangerous woman. This is the classic shy/geeky guy meets hot/rebellious babe with a twist! But from there, the movie begins a downward spiral that even Trent Reznor never reached. Seriously, if the filmmakers want us, the audience, to feel sympathetic for a staller and a serial killer, they need to provide better reasons than one has his wife and daughter leave him and the other is abandoned by her father.Without the emotional attachment that comes with good character development, the audience is reduced to mere spectators who watch two loonies doing things that don't make much sense for an audience who don't much care.  Furthermore, as good actors as McGregor and Judd are, they don't have chemistry.And after sitting through this pile of manure, thinking there must be some sort of payoff at the end but it never came; I was left wondering: If his daughter really means more to him than anything in the world, why oh why doesn't the McGregor character invests all the time, money, and effort he uses to stall Judd; to find his daughter?",1,Huh??,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,1567,"[""'m"", 'off-beat', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'key', 'word', 'here', 'thriller', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'psychological', 'not', 'thrilling', 'good', 'thriller', 'calls', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'something', 'movie', 'plainly', 'one-minute', 'flash-back', 'Judd', 'middle', 'movie', 'NOT', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'book.Still', 'movies', 'much', 'promise', 'secret', 'agent', 'doing', 'surveillance', 'suspect', 'instead', 'witness', 'death', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'obviously', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'classic', 'shy/geeky', 'guy', 'hot/rebellious', 'babe', 'twist', 'there', 'movie', 'downward', 'spiral', 'even', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'never', 'reached', 'Seriously', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'audience', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'staller', 'serial', 'killer', 'need', 'provide', 'better', 'reasons', 'one', 'wife', 'daughter', 'leave', 'other', 'abandoned', 'father.Without', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'audience', 'reduced', 'mere', 'spectators', 'who', 'watch', 'two', 'loonies', 'doing', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'audience', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Furthermore', 'good', 'actors', 'McGregor', 'Judd', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry.And', 'sitting', 'pile', 'manure', 'thinking', 'must', 'be', 'sort', 'payoff', 'end', 'never', 'came', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'daughter', 'really', 'more', 'anything', 'world', 'why', 'oh', 'why', ""n't"", 'McGregor', 'character', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'stall', 'Judd', 'find', 'daughter']",N/A

22984,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,0767851668,Armando M. Mesa,"[5, 7]","Unfortunately, this is one of those films that falls in the &quot;pick apart&quot; category for most people. Why ?  From other reviewers the feelings are mixed. It is a film where many viewers find themselves asking  if what Joanna's father did to her justifies her reason for committing the  crimes.Does such an excuse or reason hold water for the plot in this story?  What they fail to remember is some of the &quot;damage&quot; caused by her  other late life experiences which included her correctional mentor played  by Genevieve Bujold.Personally, for me the feelings are somewhat mixed,  too, since I had previously seen Ashley Judd play a victim in Double  Jeopardy. In Eye, she is also a victim of circumstances that reads like a  laundry list ( from her father abandoning her, to a correctional system  where she fell through the cracks). She is literally a victim of  circumstances who shows us what happens when the end result is a trip down  a dark abyss of madness instead of one of hope and redemption(redemption  for her acts, not from the acts committed upon her by others). You often  see films where such dark characters somehow make ammends or climb out of  that abyss.On the flipside, the Eye (Ewan McGregor) finds himself trying  to cleanse his conscience and soul of guilt for not being there for his  daughter. For the Eye, not in an incestuous or twisted sense, Joanna is  very reminiscent of that missing daughter and wife. One of the best lines  in the film is ,&quot;I'm a daddy who has lost his little girl. You're a  little girl who has lost her daddy.&quot;  The director or writer could  have easily written the typical background cliche where both daughter and  wife were killed due to one of his dangerous missions. Or, his daughter  could have been killed with wife surviving and leaving him with the blame.  It is haunting (no pun), yet captivating how the writer gave the viewer the  impression in the beginning that the Eye's daughter was dead. However, she  still is an actual &quot;ghost&quot; of his conscience and past. It is  through Joanna that he attempts to redeem himself; That is his obesession.  That is his weakness...The only other film that comes to mind with  almost similar story lines is Basic Instinct. The only major difference is  there was nothing at all helpless or remotely redeemable about sharon  Stone's character; She simply killed men for the thrill of it !",4,Interpretation is also in the eye of the beholder...,960249600,"06 6, 2000",2000,2422,"['Unfortunately', 'one', 'films', 'quot', 'apart', 'quot', 'category', 'most', 'people', 'Why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'feelings', 'are', 'mixed', 'film', 'where', 'many', 'viewers', 'find', 'asking', 'what', 'Joanna', 'father', 'did', 'justifies', 'reason', 'committing', 'crimes.Does', 'such', 'excuse', 'reason', 'hold', 'water', 'plot', 'story', 'What', 'fail', 'remember', 'quot', 'damage', 'quot', 'caused', 'other', 'late', 'life', 'experiences', 'included', 'correctional', 'mentor', 'played', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold.Personally', 'feelings', 'are', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'too', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'play', 'victim', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'Eye', 'also', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'reads', 'laundry', 'list', 'father', 'abandoning', 'correctional', 'system', 'where', 'fell', 'cracks', 'literally', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'end', 'result', 'trip', 'down', 'dark', 'abyss', 'madness', 'instead', 'one', 'hope', 'redemption', 'redemption', 'acts', 'not', 'acts', 'committed', 'others', 'often', 'see', 'films', 'where', 'such', 'dark', 'characters', 'somehow', 'make', 'ammends', 'climb', 'flipside', 'Eye', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'trying', 'cleanse', 'conscience', 'soul', 'guilt', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'daughter', 'Eye', 'not', 'incestuous', 'twisted', 'sense', 'Joanna', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'missing', 'daughter', 'wife', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'quot', ""'m"", 'daddy', 'who', 'lost', 'little', 'girl', ""'re"", 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'daddy.', 'quot', 'director', 'writer', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'written', 'typical', 'background', 'cliche', 'where', 'daughter', 'wife', 'were', 'killed', 'due', 'one', 'dangerous', 'missions', 'daughter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'wife', 'surviving', 'leaving', 'blame', 'haunting', 'pun', 'yet', 'captivating', 'how', 'writer', 'gave', 'viewer', 'impression', 'beginning', 'Eye', 'daughter', 'was', 'dead', 'However', 'still', 'actual', 'quot', 'ghost', 'quot', 'conscience', 'past', 'Joanna', 'redeem', 'obesession', 'weakness', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'mind', 'almost', 'similar', 'story', 'lines', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'only', 'major', 'difference', 'was', 'nothing', 'helpless', 'remotely', 'redeemable', 'sharon', 'Stone', 'character', 'simply', 'killed', 'men', 'thrill']",N/A

I gave it two stars because the acting is good, it deserves less than 0 stars for the way the  plot was handled, or there was none.A British intelligence agent (Ewan  McGregor) assigned to a case, observes an attractive young woman brutally  killing a man.  He tails her.  Through conversations with his imaginary  daughter, he is directed to protect her as if she is a wayward &quot;little  girl&quot;.  His headquarter's contact k d lang, concerned that he is in  left field (he is), continues to support him, so he does not lose contact,  but is flabbergasted with his current direction.About the only thing I  found amazing in the movie, was his computer set up and how fast he could  move it.Ewan McGregor, does some further research (amazing what DNA  typing can do in this movie) and finds out who she is.  A visit to a  prison, results in a contact with Genevieve Bujold, which gives a hint of  some promise that never materializes.This movie continues on in this  direction for it's entirety, with the monotony of Ashley Judd's killing  spree contining, until she meets a wealthy blind man, who wants to marry  her. Ewan McGregor tries to warn him off, but instead eventually puts in  motion the car accident that kills him.Further down the road, she  drifts to run into a violent Jason Priestley (a significant departure from  his 90210 days) who's entire role in this movie seems to be to get Ewan  McGregor to rescue Ashley Judd who runs away anyway.  Big surprise.The  movies ends with Ashley Judd wondering who Ewan McGregor is, after running  away from him and getting injured in an auto crash.

What he observes is the murder of the son by a beautiful woman for whom his shock quickly descends into an erratic obsessive love beyond the call of duty. The murderess, Johanna Eris (Ashley Judd) kills every man who yearns to get close having been deserted as a child by her father. Problematic to the story is the audience's realization that years before The Eye crossed the threshold from reality to fantasy loosing his daughter with whom he continues to converse, a ghostly reminder of his lonely existance.  Director Stephen Elliot (Pricilla, Queen of the Desert) earnestly tries to pull off this muddled murder-thriller.  Elliot wants to overwhelm his audience with the idea of love out of control and the haunted emotions of longing and loneliness, but he is unable to rise beyond the problematic script.  Judd is distant, an iceberg far from sexy, her acting is anything but compelling in the role of an older woman. Ewan McGregor, cast against type succeeds in bringing sympathetic pathos to his hunt with desperation and the need to find the daughter he's lost.  The surprising small cameos of Jason Priestley as a evil drug-head, and Genevieve Boujould are high points in the film. Nevertheless, the film is long on concept and short on follow through. Critics and audiences hated this film, but it is not altogether bad nor an incomprehensible film.

22992,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,0767851668,cinemagirl,"[1, 3]","After renting this film, I've gotten the impression that this movie seems to be an experiment. Perhaps the director was aiming for something unique and disconcerting -- he succeeded, but not gracefully. Albeit I commend him  for trying something new, this film just did not take off in the least. The  plot (if it even exists) is thin, there are so many incongruent events in  the film that it leaves viewers going, &quot;But--but--but!&quot; Folks,  just because a film is difficult to understand and peculiar does not grant  the right for people to call it a &quot;beautiful masterpiece.&quot; When  you make a film that stars two big actors and promises a good story in the  trailer, you must deliver. You cannot assume that audiences will embrace an  offbeat story, unless, of course, you never claim it to be a satisfying  film. However, there are some good aspects about the film.1.)  Cinematography: the angles and shots are sometimes beautiful. Interesting  way to shoot a film (if only there were a story to match it...).2.)  Acting: Judd and McGregor are good actors who deliver in this film.  Obviously, they didn't let the lack of direction throw them. They somehow  made the parts work with what they had.A good reason NOT to see the  film: McGregor's character (&quot;The Eye&quot;) has a young daughter with  whom he interacts quite a bit in the film, and after a while viewers  realize that she is but a figment of his imagination. His real daughter is  lost somewhere in the world because his wife took her. Anyway, could they  have hired a more exasperating young actress? Perhaps it is just the part  and not her, but I found myself becoming very irritated by her antics.I  don't recommend this film.

22994,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767851668,D. Litton,"[22, 37]","If ever a movie was put forth that concentrates on the extreme sense of loss and loneliness that a person can experience in life, it is the latest film by Stephan Elliot. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; is a vibrant  package of gorgeous thrills that are as stunning as the lead actors'  preformances as well as the splendid cinematography. While the movie may be  confusing to some, and previews will surely mislead those in the mood for  action sequences, those of you in the market for suspense that keeps  mounting amidst an alluring backdrop shall be enthralled.  Ewan  McGregor (Trainspotting, The Pillow Book) stars as The Eye, an undercover  agent assigned to investigate the blackmail of a government official's son.  Upon tracking the suspect, he soon dicsovers that the blackmailer, a sexy  yet sinister woman, is really a serial killer with deep emotional  instability. As his surveillance continues, he begins to develop feelings  for her, and his connection with her costs him his loyalty to his work as  he works to keep her safe from the hands of the law. The pace builds with  intensity as he gets closer to her, but to reveal himself would mean losing  her forever.  The film, based upon the 1980 novel by Marc Behm, while  slandered by the highest of critics, is, in my opinion, a stunning visual  and emotional achievement that sweeps its audience into an involving and  tragic story of obsession, loss and loneliness. Says director Stephan  Elliott: &quot;I saw it as a story of two lost souls... that is what The  Eye and Joanna Eris share- a deep sense of loss.&quot;  Those feelings  of loss are beautifully acted by Judd and McGregor, who play their parts  with a unique brand of mystery and intensity. As The Eye, McGregor's moods  change as swiftly as his location, shifting from stern and  involved-with-work to emotionally imbalanced as he thinks of his losses and  the woman he cannot hope to gain. Judd's Eris moves with catlike precision  throughout the film, gliding through the streets with just the right degree  of wariness and suspicion. It is evident from her portrayal that Judd is an  actress worthy of playing a woman constantly on the run.  Certain  filmmaking effects help to contribute to the intensity of certain moments  in the film. The scene on the street in New York City, in which Eris steps  out of her apartment and is told by her landlord that a strange man has  &quot;been following her around all week,&quot; is moved at a suspenseful  pace by close-ups of Eris, now required to keep her guard up, an  ear-pounding techno score by Marius de Vries, and close-ups of pedestrians  from her point-of-view. Another example of sound effects adding to the  quickening suspense is the scene on the sidewalk of Chicago, where Joanna  outsmarts The Eye and begins following him. The sound of this sequence is  devoid of all else except for the footsteps of these two characters,  creating a void in which they alone reside.  One reason for the film's  negative criticism was its ad campaigning. Theatrical trailers and  television commercials promoted the film to be a fast-paced action piece,  when in truth, it is a slow-building story with an very involving plot that  takes its time to unfold and reveal. Those looking for a movie that gives  its answers in the first fifteen minutes will be surely disappointed, but  those who look for involvement and creativity will be pleased with this  film, which is a wonderful achievement.",4,Wow!,961545600,"06 21, 2000",2000,3478,"['ever', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'forth', 'extreme', 'sense', 'loss', 'loneliness', 'person', 'can', 'experience', 'life', 'latest', 'film', 'Stephan', 'Elliot', 'quot', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'quot', 'vibrant', 'package', 'gorgeous', 'thrills', 'are', 'as', 'stunning', 'lead', 'actors', 'preformances', 'as', 'well', 'splendid', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'confusing', 'previews', 'will', 'surely', 'mislead', 'mood', 'action', 'sequences', 'market', 'suspense', 'mounting', 'amidst', 'alluring', 'backdrop', 'shall', 'be', 'enthralled', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Trainspotting', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'Eye', 'undercover', 'agent', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'blackmail', 'government', 'official', 'son', 'tracking', 'suspect', 'soon', 'blackmailer', 'sexy', 'yet', 'sinister', 'woman', 'really', 'serial', 'killer', 'deep', 'emotional', 'instability', 'surveillance', 'develop', 'feelings', 'connection', 'costs', 'loyalty', 'work', 'keep', 'safe', 'hands', 'law', 'pace', 'intensity', 'closer', 'reveal', 'would', 'mean', 'losing', 'forever', 'film', 'based', '1980', 'novel', 'Marc', 'Behm', 'slandered', 'highest', 'critics', 'opinion', 'stunning', 'visual', 'emotional', 'achievement', 'audience', 'involving', 'tragic', 'story', 'obsession', 'loss', 'loneliness', 'Says', 'director', 'Stephan', 'Elliott', 'quot', 'saw', 'story', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'what', 'Eye', 'Joanna', 'Eris', 'share-', 'deep', 'sense', 'loss.', 'quot', 'feelings', 'loss', 'are', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Judd', 'McGregor', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'unique', 'brand', 'mystery', 'intensity', 'Eye', 'McGregor', 'moods', 'change', 'as', 'swiftly', 'location', 'shifting', 'stern', 'involved-with-work', 'emotionally', 'imbalanced', 'losses', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'hope', 'gain', 'Judd', 'Eris', 'catlike', 'precision', 'film', 'gliding', 'streets', 'just', 'right', 'degree', 'wariness', 'suspicion', 'evident', 'portrayal', 'Judd', 'actress', 'worthy', 'playing', 'woman', 'constantly', 'run', 'Certain', 'filmmaking', 'effects', 'help', 'contribute', 'intensity', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'scene', 'street', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Eris', 'apartment', 'told', 'landlord', 'strange', 'man', 'quot', 'been', 'following', 'week', 'quot', 'moved', 'suspenseful', 'pace', 'close-ups', 'Eris', 'now', 'required', 'keep', 'guard', 'up', 'ear-pounding', 'techno', 'score', 'Marius', 'de', 'Vries', 'close-ups', 'pedestrians', 'point-of-view', 'example', 'sound', 'effects', 'adding', 'quickening', 'suspense', 'scene', 'sidewalk', 'Chicago', 'where', 'Joanna', 'Eye', 'following', 'sound', 'sequence', 'devoid', 'else', 'footsteps', 'two', 'characters', 'creating', 'void', 'alone', 'reside', 'One', 'reason', 'film', 'negative', 'criticism', 'was', 'ad', 'campaigning', 'Theatrical', 'trailers', 'television', 'commercials', 'promoted', 'film', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'piece', 'when', 'truth', 'slow-building', 'story', 'very', 'involving', 'plot', 'time', 'unfold', 'reveal', 'looking', 'movie', 'answers', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'will', 'be', 'surely', 'disappointed', 'who', 'look', 'involvement', 'creativity', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'film', 'wonderful', 'achievement']",N/A

There is an attempt to form a link between McGregor's now-gone wife and daughter and Ashley Judd, but that doesn't really hold up.  I mean, the odds that his wife and/or daughter were wig-wearing serial killers seems unlikely.  Yes perhaps she had a rough childhood, but so did the killers of Thomas Harris's work, and no renegade British agent was risking his life to save them.Odd (but not terribly interesting) characters abound, from Ewwn McGregors' thoroughly American (don't ask me why) contact to a perhaps lesbian owner of a home for wayward girls and a blind mogul, the only one of whom draws any emotion from the audience.Nothing in this movie makes much sense, and none of it is terribly interesting.

Finally I broke down and watched it one night and honestly do not understand all the criticism.  I thought it was a fairly engrossing movie that kept me interested throughout the entire film.To address a couple common complaints about the movie... A lot here say it was extremely confusing.  Although not a traditional plot for a movie, I didn't really see all that much to be confused about, it was fairly straightforward.  Most people seem to hate the movie for the ending alone.  While I agree its kind of an 'open' ending, its not that its necessarily bad.  There's basically 2 things that could possibly occur after the ending of the movie (I won't reveal them for spoiler sake).  Why is it so bad that the writer doesn't tell you which of the 2 things occurred?  Because it wasn't important to the story what happens afterwards, it was everything leading up to that point that was important.While you are kind of thrown into the whole plot without much upfront explanation, Ewan's character is thrown into his feelings just as suddenly and that is when the story begins.  Throughout the film you piece together bits and pieces of each characters past to make you understand why they are doing the things they do and what led up to them.  Its basically a contrast of 2 people who have suffered great loss and how they cope with it.I also found the camera effects to be very good as well as good acting through the film.So if you need a movie where everything is tied up nice and neat at the end, this may not be for you, but other than that there really isn't too much to dislike about it.

But, no, the movie was exactly THAT bad to provoke another negative response, at least from me. Who had the brilliant idea to film a thinly plotted espionage thriller as if it was a student art film? And artsy it certainly tries to be. The plot follows a neurotic British agent across the world as he becomes more and more enamored of a sociopathic, yet emotionally wounded, femme fatale on whom he has been spying. There is no rhyme or reason, even in the wide span of human desire and emotion, to explain many of the events and incidents that happen between the two or even why, other than sheer insanity, he is drawn to her in such a creepy stalker type fashion. The movie certainly won't tell you anything. It is too &quot;high brow&quot; for that and would rather show you fancy camera work and snow globe after snow globe. One gets the impression that the director is trying to impress you while completely forgetting that he is filming a trashy romantic spy novel (thus the scenes with a topless Mz. Judd would be defined as being &quot;tastefully done&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; rather than tawdry and exploitative). You may sit around and discuss the nuamces of this &quot;film&quot; over a latte, but it doesn't erase the fact that it is simply dull and dumb, faulty advertising or no.Oddly enough, there is an alternate ending on the DVD which, while not redeeming the film, at least ends it in a traditional Hollywood fashion and is a little more satisfying than what those in the theater saw. It is an additional scene where Ewan meets up, rather conveniently, with his long lost daughter. It is set up in the story that he has never seen his daughter before and has had to pick out which girl was his from a school photo of an entire class. He believed so strongly that the girl he chose was the right one that she appears throughout the film as a phantom of his imagination. It actually adds quite a bit of dimension and pathos to his character to find out in the ending that was cut, that he picked the wrong girl. I felt better about the viewing after watching this until I remembered that somebody decided to cut this scene for release, probably because it gave a little too much explanation and insight to a film that tried its hardest to offer absolutely none.Even if the whole topless issue piqued your interest a few paragraphs back, trust me, it isn't worth it. Watching paint dry isn't the same thing as viewing a painting. That statement isn't as profound as it is nonsensical--like the whole concept of this film.",1,"You'll Shoot Your Eye Out, Kid!",1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,2665,"['would', 'think', 'hundred', 'more', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'film', 'posted', 'one', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'leave', 'alone', 'movie', 'was', 'exactly', 'THAT', 'bad', 'provoke', 'negative', 'response', 'least', 'Who', 'had', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'film', 'thinly', 'plotted', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'was', 'student', 'art', 'film', 'artsy', 'certainly', 'be', 'plot', 'neurotic', 'British', 'agent', 'world', 'more', 'more', 'enamored', 'sociopathic', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'femme', 'fatale', 'whom', 'been', 'spying', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'even', 'wide', 'span', 'human', 'desire', 'emotion', 'explain', 'many', 'events', 'incidents', 'happen', 'two', 'even', 'why', 'other', 'sheer', 'insanity', 'drawn', 'such', 'creepy', 'stalker', 'type', 'fashion', 'movie', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'too', 'quot', 'high', 'brow', 'quot', 'would', 'rather', 'show', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'snow', 'globe', 'snow', 'globe', 'One', 'impression', 'director', 'trying', 'impress', 'completely', 'forgetting', 'filming', 'trashy', 'romantic', 'spy', 'novel', 'thus', 'scenes', 'topless', 'Mz', 'Judd', 'would', 'be', 'defined', 'being', 'quot', 'tastefully', 'done', 'quot', 'quot', 'necessary', 'quot', 'rather', 'tawdry', 'exploitative', 'may', 'sit', 'around', 'discuss', 'nuamces', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'latte', ""n't"", 'erase', 'fact', 'simply', 'dull', 'dumb', 'faulty', 'advertising', 'no.Oddly', 'enough', 'alternate', 'ending', 'DVD', 'not', 'redeeming', 'film', 'least', 'ends', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'little', 'more', 'satisfying', 'what', 'theater', 'saw', 'additional', 'scene', 'where', 'Ewan', 'up', 'rather', 'conveniently', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'never', 'seen', 'daughter', 'had', 'pick', 'out', 'girl', 'was', 'school', 'photo', 'entire', 'class', 'believed', 'so', 'strongly', 'girl', 'chose', 'was', 'right', 'one', 'film', 'phantom', 'imagination', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'dimension', 'pathos', 'character', 'find', 'out', 'ending', 'was', 'cut', 'picked', 'wrong', 'girl', 'felt', 'better', 'viewing', 'watching', 'remembered', 'somebody', 'decided', 'cut', 'scene', 'release', 'probably', 'gave', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'explanation', 'insight', 'film', 'tried', 'hardest', 'offer', 'absolutely', 'none.Even', 'whole', 'topless', 'issue', 'piqued', 'interest', 'few', 'paragraphs', 'back', 'trust', ""n't"", 'worth', 'Watching', 'paint', 'dry', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'viewing', 'painting', 'statement', ""n't"", 'as', 'profound', 'nonsensical', 'whole', 'concept', 'film']",N/A

Apparently this was based on  40's style pulp fiction he read while filming Priscilla and decided immediately that it would be his next film.It took 7 years to get the financing, asking for a $20 million budget he ended up with $11 million and financed much of it himself. That alone should put up warning lights.The cast has little to work with. Almost the entire film is made in Montreal in winter and edited to death. There is even an entire scene of Ewan McGregor in drag that is just barely visible if you follow the director's commentary on the DVD version. The film itself is so low budget that he fills in as a double for several characters on several scenes and Ashley Judd's wardrobe was nearly a third of the ENTIRE budget.The premise is that a man called the eye (McGregor) who is some sort of technical spy is so wrapped up in his job that he doesn't even realize his wife has left with his daughter for weeks. She's apparently gone several years and he is still not quite right in the head over it when he is assigned to follow the Ashley Judd character. For some reason he becomes obsessed with her to the point of helping her cover her tracks as a serial murderer.The plot becomes absurd as his obsession deepens and the police begin to catch up with her. When he reveals himself and she betrays him it is almost as if the writer and director didn't know what to do and the movie just ends leaving nothing resolved and no questions answered.Beholder is about obsession and loss and the slow loss of reason and the ability to see beyond what is right in front of you. It is a spiral into a strange psychosis shared by 2 people as seen from the opposing ends of a spyglass.If you are into film noir and would like to try something diffent than the usual popcorn thriller this is an ok movie.

It also contained a ridiculous weaving in and out of scenes, and a horrid ending!  For those that are trying to read more into this film than what it is, don't bother.  It's just Hollywood's cheap substitution for an intelligent thriller.It's too bad, the premise was good, but it was wasted on this horrid, boring and annoying film.  Poor Ashley, she's too beautiful, versatile and talented of an actress to be wasting her time on these kind of films.  With the exception of &quot;Double Jeapardy&quot;, it's too bad she hasn't been getting some good roles equivalent to what Julia Robert's has been getting these days.  Well maybe she'll just pretend this one doesn't exist and you should to, STAY AWAY!",1,"Poor Ashley, it's not her fault!",969667200,"09 23, 2000",2000,1469,"['give', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'However', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'husband', 'exclaimed', 'quot', 'Ehhh', 'THAT', 'WAS', 'AWFUL', 'quot', 'sat', 'there', 'motionless', 'aghast', 'actually', 'watched', 'something', 'so', 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'rental', 'money', 'guess', 'Here', 'were', 'reasons', 'despised', 'film', 'First', 'annoying', 'little', 'girl', 'hallucination', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'character', 'usually', 'like', 'children', 'movies', 'Then', 'totally', 'ubelievable', 'plot', 'mean', 'come', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'followed', 'THAT', 'closely', 'Ashley', 'street', 'wise', 'cautious', 'character', 'never', 'caught', 'also', 'contained', 'ridiculous', 'weaving', 'scenes', 'horrid', 'ending', 'are', 'trying', 'read', 'more', 'film', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'cheap', 'substitution', 'intelligent', 'thriller.It', 'too', 'bad', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'wasted', 'horrid', 'boring', 'annoying', 'film', 'Poor', 'Ashley', 'too', 'beautiful', 'versatile', 'talented', 'actress', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'kind', 'films', 'exception', 'quot', 'Double', 'Jeapardy', 'quot', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'been', 'getting', 'good', 'roles', 'equivalent', 'what', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'been', 'getting', 'days', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'pretend', 'one', ""n't"", 'exist', 'should', 'STAY', 'AWAY']",N/A
23045,A2X9HB95SG0XWE,0767851668,Tyler Parkford,"[2, 3]","I fell in love with Eye of the Beholder the first time I saw it.  I don't know why I had such a momentous reaction to this film, but something seemed to &quot;click&quot;.  The story is very original, but doesn't seem to hold  enough water.  The scene transitions are, at times, spectacular; with  steady camera movement and somewhat random fades.  Its a very slow movie,  considering that there's not much to work with, and the acting appears very  dull and bland.  However, Eye of the Beholder is about two sociopaths who  eventially find each other, so heavy acting really doesn't fit the  storyline.  The sound and picture quality are both moderate, and much of  the dialogue drifts with little emotion.  Eye of the Beholder is not  hollywood material and, to some, may appear very very depressing, due to  the films bleak attitude.  Its a romance with a 180 degree twist, and is  suitable for anyone who has the patience for slow drama.  Its a good movie  to view once, but I would not be very enthusiastic to own it.  Rent it  before buying it, and endulge.",5,"Good Movie, but a bit pointless",962496000,"07 2, 2000",2000,1063,"['fell', 'love', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'had', 'momentous', 'reaction', 'film', 'something', 'seemed', 'quot', 'click', 'quot', 'story', 'very', 'original', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hold', 'enough', 'water', 'scene', 'transitions', 'are', 'times', 'spectacular', 'steady', 'camera', 'movement', 'somewhat', 'random', 'fades', 'very', 'slow', 'movie', 'considering', 'not', 'much', 'work', 'acting', 'very', 'dull', 'bland', 'However', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'two', 'sociopaths', 'who', 'eventially', 'find', 'other', 'so', 'heavy', 'acting', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', 'storyline', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'moderate', 'much', 'dialogue', 'drifts', 'little', 'emotion', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'not', 'hollywood', 'material', 'may', 'appear', 'very', 'very', 'depressing', 'due', 'films', 'bleak', 'attitude', 'romance', '180', 'degree', 'twist', 'suitable', 'anyone', 'who', 'patience', 'slow', 'drama', 'good', 'movie', 'view', 'once', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'own', 'Rent', 'buying', 'endulge']",N/A
