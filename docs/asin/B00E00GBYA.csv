I do have to say that I can't recall how many are on this disk, but there are quite a few fillers that may drive you a bit nuts. Personally I skipped them since they had nothing to do with the main storyline. But at least they weren't as bad as some other Anime's (such as the 6 seasons worth of fillers in Naruto! UGH!)...Either way I am positive you will love this.",5,What Else Can We Say?!,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,427,"['One', 'Piece', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'disk', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'fillers', 'may', 'drive', 'bit', 'nuts', 'Personally', 'skipped', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'main', 'storyline', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'Anime', 'such', '6', 'seasons', 'fillers', 'Naruto', 'UGH', 'way', 'am', 'positive', 'will', 'love']","One Piece: Season 5, Voyage Three"
