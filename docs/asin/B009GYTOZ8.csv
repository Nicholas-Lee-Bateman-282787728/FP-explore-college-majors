1596370,A1GJJ4B4CRAHWH,B009GYTOZ8,Grady Glover,"[32, 42]","BBC brings you the Doctor Who Limited Edition Gift Set just in time for the holiday season! This limited edition Doctor Who collector's box will be the ultimate holiday gift for Doctor Who fans! It includes the complete seasons 1-6 covering the 9th, 10th and 11th Doctors (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, and Matt Smith), over 70 hours in all, plus hours and hours of bonus features including 3 new Doctor Specials coming to DVD for the first time ever. The set also includes a collectible 11th Doctor Sonic Screwdriver, 3 original art cards and the comic book, ""Doctor Who at Comic Con."" It's a Doctor Who dream come true.BBC Home Entertainment has announced an incredible 6-season release of Doctor Who - Limited Edition Gift Set, covering the new 2005 program from Series 1 through Series 6 (and including the various specials as well, of course). This item is only going to be available in DVD format, so no Blu-ray release here (because, as passionate fans already know, the show was only produced on standard-definition videotape - which is completely incompatible with high-def resolutions - from ""Rose"" through to the 2008 Christmas Special, ""The Next Doctor"").Cost of the 41-disc title is $249.99 SRP, and as the studio-provided description quoted above says, it will include a collectible Sonic Screwdriver in the style that the 11th Doctor (Matt ""Bowties are Cool"" Smith) uses, plus a comic book, three original art cards, and three Specials which are new-to-DVD. It's available on November 20th. Amazon has a listing for the title, but isn't taking pre-orders just yet. We don't have any further details than that for now, nor do we have any images of the packaging at this time other than the (somewhat blurry; sorry!) thumbnail picture at the right. Stay tuned for updates!From TVSHOWSONDVD website...",5,A GREAT GIFT FOR A DOCTOR WHO FAN!!

I have had no problems with the set I bought.  Every disk has played and I have experienced no problems at all.  Seems to be a very superior product.I can't say that about the storylines though.  I can see why the new series has garnered more popularity than the old.  The effects are bigger and the sets more interesting.  It's a shame the story line suffers.  I am actually getting tired of seeing extinguished races such as the Daleks return time and time again.

1596373,A1XZ4EAIC71NZV,B009GYTOZ8,Ray Keeper Jr,"[5, 9]","Dear BBC, please redesign the attrocious plastic DVD holders for Series 1-4. They tend to break where the DVD discs are held in place and often ruin the DVD discs themselves. The discs also tend to become dislodged during transport and get scratched up. Please rectify this ongoing issue and and do not use the platic slip cover mess things that were used for Series 1 & 2. Use the DVD Boxset type from Series 5/6 and please update the artwork for Series 1. The artwork for Series 2 and onward are still aestethically pleasing but series 1 needs some updating.*The Series: The show itself is funny, exciting, silly and bittersweet all rolled into one. The way it goes from happy to sad, serious to levity and everywhere in between is something that is truly hard to find these days. The stories are sometimes clever, inventive, but ultimately fun. Yes, there are quite a few stinkers but that is true for any televised program. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that I love Series 1 - 4 moreso than the recent ones. I still enjoy the current series mostly because of Matt's take on the Doctor though. I like his old weary traveller approach to the role of the Doctor.*Visual Effects: The new series visual effects are bold, daring and sometimes impressive. They make the first couple of series look really dated as a result but overall, the effects from Series 1 - 4 are inventive, fun and have personality to them.*The music on the show is fantastic and some argue that it directs the the emotions for the viewer during Series 1 - 4. I disagree with that and I believe that is sorely missing from the most recent series. Murray Gold is an amazing musician and the music from Series 1 & the Specials really showcases his work. I'm not dumping on Series 5 and onward, I just find that it is lacking something that was present in the other series musically.*The Doctor: The differences between actors does no phase me, sure I have a preference for David Tennant but I also like Matt and Chris' take on the Doctor.Christopher Eccleston: Chris' Doctor was quite goofy at times but his smile hid a traumatic past underneath. I just wish that we saw more of it in the time that we had with him. Stiil, he was quite enigmatic as a result of that. :)David Tenannt: David's Doctor was very human and quite lonely if a bit silly at times. The continuation of the budding romance between Rose and the Doctor from Series 1 into Series 2 was made more believeable because of him. His energetic performances were sometimes manic but thoroughly entertaining. He could convey emotions quite well when dealing with the darker and sadder traits of his character. He also had intensity during the most bombastic and dire of situations.Matt Smith: Matt's Doctor is very evidently the wise old man of the three nu-series Doctors. Alot of his scenes convey his years coming through his face and how he looks at the universe. His evolving care and nurturing of Amy and Rory through Series 5 & 6 shows him invested in their burgeoning life story together. I also liked the fact that he is dealing with his demons and inner turmoil underneath and feeling quilt for Rose, Martha, Donna and so on. I'm excited to where Steven Moffat takes his story and I hope that it is a worthy journey for the good Doctor.*Companions:Rose: Rose is the girl who fell in love with the man from the stars. She was swept away on a grand adventure through time and space. Sure, she had a boyfriend but who could blame her for wanting to leave him behind to see the universe with this otherworldly being who has a spaceship that can travel through time and space. People complain about the domestics that Rose' brought to the show. I could not disagree more with this because it grounded the character to the world. Her mother and Mickey add a bit of backstory to her and they were explored during Series 1 & 2. Mickey even grew from meek to being a fighter. Jackie reconnected with her dead husband.Martha: Martha had an unfortunate storyline, her falling for the man who was heartbroken and in love with someone else. Still, she grew into a strong character throughout her series run. I wish we could have seen the 1 year she was travelling the world spreading the word of the Doctor. She too had a backstory and her family was a part of her life but it was not a rosey story. She also had a career unlike Rose, and her time with the Doctor shaped her into something more that was touched upon in the following series.Donna: I can understand the criticisms regarding her initial appearance in the Christmas Special for the third series. I have to say that her return during the 4th Series completely shattered that in my opinion. She was not interested in romancing the Doctor. She was not completely trusting of him but she wanted to see his world. She wanted to be an equal partner in saving the world. Out of the three companions during the Davies Era, her story was exciting and seeing her evolve through the fourth series was really funny and cool. The way it ended for her was truly a sad conclusion to her story though.Amy: For much of her time during Series 5, I could not get into her character. I could understand that Steven Moffat wanted to get away from the domestics from previous series'. So it completely baffles me why he brought a prenancy, two weddings, many deaths and revivals, and a near death during Series 6. I would definitely call those story elements somewhere within the domestic range and soap opera mainstays. Through all that, we never really got to see Amy and her family and her place therein. I found her cold and disconnected in that way. Series 5 can get away with that being that is was part of the story but Series 6 continued that. Sure her and Rory sometimes went home but we never really saw her at home with the family.Series 7 had Rory's dad and that is something completely tragic in and of itself which leads me to...Rory: I felt bad for this character through much of season 5. He was killed and brought back and so on. I was surprised that he wasn't thrown into a blackhole for good measure. Still, Arthur Darvil was very amiable, heck he should have been the main companion character for Series 5 and 6. That would have been a total break from tradition.The Ponds: How it ended for them did no affect me at all. Call it the ""cry wolf"" syndrome but when you have so many scenes of your characters on the verge of dying or being killed, that when it does finally happen it loses a great deal of impact. Even though they did not die, they are gone through timey wimey conventions.River: The character at best can make a wonderful foil for the Doctor. At worst, she can overshadow (Series 6) the Doctor and be campy. I much prefer her when she is somewhere in between. Not quite a mugging cow and not quite overly ahead of the Doctor. She was, I think very well done during the 4th series two parter. I liked her most recent appearance this season as she was somewhere in the middle. Will she make another appearance? I don't know but it has been established that she will be there before Matt's Doctor regenerates again.Anyway, we are getting a new companion this Christmas. I don't know if this new companion is in any way similar or the same person we saw in, Asylum of the Daleks. I just hope that we could get away from the too clever and too Ellen Page smart/cynical/sarcastic female companion that seems to plague much of Steven Moffat's writing.End.",5,Love the series but the
