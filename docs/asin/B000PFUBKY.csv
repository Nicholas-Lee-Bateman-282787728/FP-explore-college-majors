1070767,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000PFUBKY,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is a typical TV movie. It is the story of a girl who is talked into pretending she is married in order to keep her job when her company is taken over by another whose CEO stresses family values. She ends up hiring an actor to play the part of her husband and she uses her best friend's daughter to play the part of her daughter. Of course it's obvious from almost the first moment they do their act that they will eventually fall in love. In that sense, this is a pretty standard TV romantic comedy. It's not terribly original but it is fairly clean-cut and enjoyable to watch. Most of the actors do a decent job with their parts although a few of them seems a bit stilted or out of place in some scenes. There are a couple of twists to the plot that are somewhat unrealistic and overdone, but for the most part it isn't too bad. It is a nice little low-budget feel-good movie that's worth checking out.",4,B quality but nice,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,908,"['typical', 'TV', 'movie', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'talked', 'pretending', 'married', 'order', 'keep', 'job', 'when', 'company', 'taken', 'over', 'CEO', 'family', 'values', 'up', 'hiring', 'actor', 'play', 'part', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'daughter', 'play', 'part', 'daughter', 'course', 'obvious', 'almost', 'first', 'moment', 'do', 'act', 'will', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'sense', 'pretty', 'standard', 'TV', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'fairly', 'clean-cut', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Most', 'actors', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'parts', 'few', 'bit', 'stilted', 'place', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'twists', 'plot', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'overdone', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'nice', 'little', 'low-budget', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

Well, everything seems to be perfect 'till her boss moves into the house next door -- and she has to find a way to continue this sham! Of course, the always adorable Tori Spelling falls in love with the actor hired to portray her husband!This movie is so cute, and almost seems like the kind of movie that Doris Day would have made years ago.

It was a cute movie and Tori looked very pretty throughout the film. Nice scenery too. You could see the ending coming a mile away, but if I like a film that doesn't bother me and I don't see it as a drawback. The only  problem I had with the movie was I didn't see any romantic chemistry between Tori and co-star Jordan. They had a pleasant, friendly chemistry between them  and he is an incredibly attractive guy but I didn't see any real romantic sparks there. Oh well, I still like this movie and will probably watch it again someday. It's a nice way to spend a couple of hours.",4,Cute but...,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,676,"['got', 'movie', 'am', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'fan', 'watched', 'relaxed', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'Tori', 'looked', 'very', 'pretty', 'film', 'Nice', 'scenery', 'too', 'could', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'like', 'film', ""n't"", 'bother', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'drawback', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Tori', 'co-star', 'Jordan', 'had', 'pleasant', 'friendly', 'chemistry', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'there', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'someday', 'nice', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

The premise is far-fetched, but if you are willing to sit back and be entertained, then it's fun. I took off a star because it was disturbing that an employee's personal life was used as the basis for determining if she was a good fit for the company. She retained her job because she pretended to be married! How lame is that? By all reports, she was a great employee, and this never should have been an issue. Have they heard of Equal Employment Opportunity?As for the characters involved, and the moral message, the movie is rated PG. I doubt very seriously if anyone past the age of seven would believe that living this lie is ok. So kids may enjoy it and laugh at it, but I'd hope parents see it as a vehicle for discussing why the lying, and the situations depicted, were wrong.  This isn't a movie I'd buy to keep small children entertained without adult supervision. But I'm an adult, and I'm not going to think it's ok to lie to keep my job. Why would I want to work somewhere if I had to pretend to be something I'm not just to keep my job?When I just relaxed into the entertainmet and watched the movie, it was hilarious. It wasn't until after I thought about it that it rankled a bit. But I am planning to watch it again. And it will make me laugh and smile again every time it's played.  Just don't take it seriously, and everything will be fine.",4,"Good For 'Tweens, Teens and Adults",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1416,"['****', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '*********This', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'premise', 'far-fetched', 'are', 'willing', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'entertained', 'then', 'fun', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'was', 'disturbing', 'employee', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'used', 'basis', 'determining', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'company', 'retained', 'job', 'pretended', 'be', 'married', 'How', 'lame', 'reports', 'was', 'great', 'employee', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'issue', 'Have', 'heard', 'Equal', 'Employment', 'Opportunity', 'characters', 'involved', 'moral', 'message', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'doubt', 'very', 'seriously', 'anyone', 'age', 'seven', 'would', 'believe', 'living', 'lie', 'ok', 'So', 'kids', 'may', 'enjoy', 'laugh', ""'d"", 'hope', 'parents', 'see', 'vehicle', 'discussing', 'why', 'lying', 'situations', 'depicted', 'were', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'d"", 'buy', 'keep', 'small', 'children', 'entertained', 'adult', 'supervision', ""'m"", 'adult', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'think', 'ok', 'lie', 'keep', 'job', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'work', 'somewhere', 'had', 'pretend', 'be', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'keep', 'job', 'When', 'just', 'relaxed', 'entertainmet', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', ""n't"", 'thought', 'rankled', 'bit', 'am', 'planning', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'smile', 'again', 'time', 'played', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'fine']",N/A
