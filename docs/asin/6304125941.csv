Well, Kids in the Hall have made a brilliant film that is funny on so many levels that it cannot fail to please. There is much in this movie that is, both, mainstream funny and wildly inappropriately funny. (Cancer Boy is one of my favourites.)

403300,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6304125941,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 8]","The Kids in the Hall have always been reliable in having incredibly sharp aim when throwing stones at the establishment and here they surprise even me with their pinpoint accuracy. In ""Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy"" they throw the gloves off to expose pharmaceutical industry as the cutthroat zoo that it is. Just being brave enough to call attention to the fact that there is a difference between clinical depression and ""I Just Got Kicked to the Curb"" depression is impressive. But they go further than that, showing depression to be something that isn't all bad because nobody would really want to live in a world where neighbors prance up and down the street singing about how gay they are, or in one where rock stars don't have a problem in the world so they are stuck singing Sesame Street-esque lullabies. I've battled depression a few times myself, and never once did I swallow one of those thought quenching pills.The Kids in the Hall have many targets here, and they are all deserving. Corporate life in general is first on the list. The CEO is an infantile idiot who surrounds himself with Yes Men who spend their days trying to match the carpet to the color of the boss' socks. Anybody who were to wander into their boardroom would find quite the sight indeed. The problems being discussed is not whether the drug is safe but rather what color it should be. The head of marketing is under the impression that he is some sort of idol (""So I'm driving around in my $62,000 car""). And said wanderer would be ridiculed for being too intelligent. I took extra enjoyment out of watching the cop scene, as they proclaim victory (""We always win"") even though they only caught one of the dozens of perps that they were after. People in general are also called out, rightfully so, for being too fixated on happiness and for what makes them happy.I will admit that in my case they were probably preaching to the choir. I already know these things. But in a country who still believes in ""Support our Troops"" and ""Greed is Good"" it can only help to point out that, in fact, the military is kinda gay and corpos are a stand in for Satan. The comedy here is hit and miss, but considering that sketch comedy is mostly miss and miss I would say that they are ahead of the curve. The ending gets a little too silly, especially with when people become paralyzed within their own happiness. But that allows them to go through and show us their happiest moments which was quite hysterical. If you have seen the TV show before you know what to expect in the acting department. Honorable mention goes to Bruce McCulloch and his portrayal of Cisco the twitchy, heartless marketing guy. I recommend this film for everybody, but mostly for those of you who have wondered about the difference between illegal and prescription medication. The difference of course being that illegal drugs can't go on trash TV to promote itself. The film has a worldview that is right on. Too much leftist cinema today is somber and depressing, this one at least makes you laugh while making you depressed, and then reminds you that depression is a good thing anyways. ***1/2",3,Maybe We're All Depressed Because This Film is Right...,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,3143,"['Kids', 'Hall', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'reliable', 'having', 'incredibly', 'sharp', 'aim', 'when', 'throwing', 'stones', 'establishment', 'here', 'surprise', 'even', 'pinpoint', 'accuracy', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'throw', 'gloves', 'expose', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'cutthroat', 'zoo', 'Just', 'being', 'brave', 'enough', 'call', 'attention', 'fact', 'difference', 'clinical', 'depression', 'Just', 'Got', 'Kicked', 'Curb', 'depression', 'impressive', 'go', 'further', 'showing', 'depression', 'be', 'something', ""n't"", 'bad', 'nobody', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'neighbors', 'prance', 'up', 'street', 'singing', 'how', 'gay', 'are', 'one', 'where', 'rock', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'world', 'are', 'stuck', 'singing', 'Sesame', 'Street-esque', 'lullabies', ""'ve"", 'battled', 'depression', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'swallow', 'one', 'thought', 'quenching', 'pills.The', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'have', 'many', 'targets', 'here', 'are', 'deserving', 'Corporate', 'life', 'general', 'first', 'list', 'CEO', 'infantile', 'idiot', 'who', 'Yes', 'Men', 'who', 'spend', 'days', 'trying', 'match', 'carpet', 'color', 'boss', 'socks', 'Anybody', 'who', 'were', 'wander', 'boardroom', 'would', 'find', 'quite', 'sight', 'indeed', 'problems', 'being', 'discussed', 'not', 'drug', 'safe', 'rather', 'what', 'color', 'should', 'be', 'head', 'marketing', 'impression', 'sort', 'idol', 'So', ""'m"", 'driving', 'around', '62,000', 'car', 'said', 'wanderer', 'would', 'be', 'ridiculed', 'being', 'too', 'intelligent', 'took', 'extra', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'cop', 'scene', 'proclaim', 'victory', 'always', 'win', 'even', 'only', 'caught', 'one', 'dozens', 'perps', 'were', 'People', 'general', 'are', 'also', 'called', 'out', 'rightfully', 'so', 'being', 'too', 'fixated', 'happiness', 'what', 'happy.I', 'will', 'admit', 'case', 'were', 'probably', 'preaching', 'choir', 'already', 'know', 'things', 'country', 'who', 'still', 'Support', 'Troops', 'Greed', 'Good', 'can', 'only', 'help', 'point', 'out', 'fact', 'military', 'kinda', 'gay', 'corpos', 'are', 'stand', 'Satan', 'comedy', 'here', 'hit', 'miss', 'considering', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'miss', 'miss', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'ahead', 'curve', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'silly', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'become', 'paralyzed', 'own', 'happiness', 'go', 'show', 'happiest', 'moments', 'was', 'quite', 'hysterical', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'acting', 'department', 'Honorable', 'mention', 'Bruce', 'McCulloch', 'portrayal', 'Cisco', 'twitchy', 'heartless', 'marketing', 'guy', 'recommend', 'film', 'everybody', 'mostly', 'who', 'have', 'wondered', 'difference', 'illegal', 'prescription', 'medication', 'difference', 'course', 'being', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'trash', 'TV', 'promote', 'film', 'worldview', 'right', 'Too', 'much', 'leftist', 'cinema', 'today', 'somber', 'depressing', 'one', 'least', 'making', 'depressed', 'then', 'depression', 'good', 'thing', 'anyways', '***1/2']",Kids in the Hall - Brain Candy VHS

The premise, a new drug that makes the taker deliriously happy, would have made for a funny skit, but here it is inflated to a length that cannot be sustained.  The Kids' forte is sketch comedy; they are every bit as good as Monty Python or the better SNL casts.  I wish they had played to their strength here and done something more along the lines of ""The Meaning of Life"" or ""And Now for Something Completely Different,"" Monty Python's classic big screen collections of hilarious skits.

Expecting cameos from characters like The Chicken Lady and Gavin and all of my favorites - I was immediately disappointed by this stand alone feature from the Canuck 5 - which had nothing to do with the characters that they had created. Years later, however, I must reassess my position and say that this film twenty times as enjoyable as your average comedy. The storyline is much more intriguing than any high concept (i.e. SNL) comedy that comes from Paramount and the results are so much more satisfying. So what if Cabbage Head or The Flying Pig never shows up? The kids go to so much trouble to create characters that are new and not rely on their old characters that you have to admire them, even when it doesn't quite work. I'm not giving it a full 4 stars however, because the DVD never offers much. I wanted to see all of the scenes cut out of the movie (like David Foley's fast food teen ""THE FRIES WILL NEVER BE READY!"") but alas - we must wait until the special edition I fear.

These five guys hailing from Canada produced some of the best satirical comedy and characters for their time. Filmed before a live studio audience and with pre-planned filmed bits, they gave that generation their own Monty Python of sorts. So when the show ran it's course by 1994, the guys decided it was time to take the plunge into motion pictures like their British heroes. They then wrote a script about a scientist working for a ruthless pharmaceutical company who creates the ultimate in happiness pill with disastrous results, as well as playing the majority of the male and female parts, it was going to be a smash because the TV series was such a big hit with a loyal following, right? Although, when the film was made and released there was one problem.It's not funny.Not that they made a serious drama about the subject, it's just that there's not a gut-busting laugh in the entire film. If I had to give it a title, humorous satire would fit the bill. And while they created great long-running characters on the show, none of them are really used here (okay, a couple are, but barely) and the new characters are quickly forgotten once the wig is removed. Of course, the casual fan was turned off by the movie in '96 and so ended the film career of KITH. Looking back, the film hasn't gotten any better, McKinney's Don Roritor is a pale copy of producer Lorne Michaels (done much better by Mike Myers less than a year later), McDonald as the lead character Chris Cooper seems like the wrong actor for the part, and mainstay Dave Foley is barely in the film at all due to his feelings on the script and doing just fine for himself on his own with 90's TV show Newsradio.Truthfully, the only reason why I picked it up is that recently this film/DVD has gone out-of-print. While I'm not too sure why, lately these guys have reunited together for live gigs even more than The Eagles, so I can only assume that this bare-bones release will soon get an extras-filled/commentary version....maybe with an explaination from the guys as to what went wrong. So in conclusion, if you can see it easily (read:cheap), give it a view, but if you're a fan of the TV show but haven't seen Brain Candy yet, prepare yourself for one bad trip, man.(RedSabbath Review:7.0/10)",3,"Maybe Those Kids Should Have Stayed In The ""TV"" Hall....",1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2508,"['Say', 'TV', 'comedy', 'troupe', 'Monty', 'Python', 'can', 'have', 'film', 'career', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Canadian', 'equivalent', 'Back', 'late', ""80's/early"", '90', 'when', 'wanted', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'live', '11:30pm', 'went', 'HBO', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'five', 'guys', 'hailing', 'Canada', 'produced', 'best', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'characters', 'time', 'Filmed', 'live', 'studio', 'audience', 'pre-planned', 'filmed', 'bits', 'gave', 'generation', 'own', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sorts', 'So', 'when', 'show', 'ran', 'course', '1994', 'guys', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'take', 'plunge', 'motion', 'pictures', 'British', 'heroes', 'then', 'wrote', 'script', 'scientist', 'working', 'ruthless', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'who', 'ultimate', 'happiness', 'pill', 'disastrous', 'results', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'majority', 'male', 'female', 'parts', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'smash', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'hit', 'loyal', 'following', 'right', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'was', 'one', 'problem.It', 'not', 'funny.Not', 'made', 'serious', 'drama', 'subject', 'just', 'not', 'gut-busting', 'laugh', 'entire', 'film', 'had', 'give', 'title', 'humorous', 'satire', 'would', 'fit', 'bill', 'created', 'great', 'long-running', 'characters', 'show', 'none', 'are', 'really', 'used', 'here', 'okay', 'couple', 'are', 'barely', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'once', 'wig', 'removed', 'course', 'casual', 'fan', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', ""'96"", 'so', 'ended', 'film', 'career', 'KITH', 'Looking', 'back', 'film', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'better', 'McKinney', 'Don', 'Roritor', 'pale', 'copy', 'producer', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'less', 'year', 'later', 'McDonald', 'lead', 'character', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'wrong', 'actor', 'part', 'mainstay', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'barely', 'film', 'due', 'feelings', 'script', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'own', '90', 'TV', 'show', 'Newsradio.Truthfully', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'recently', 'film/DVD', 'gone', 'out-of-print', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'why', 'lately', 'guys', 'have', 'reunited', 'together', 'live', 'gigs', 'even', 'more', 'Eagles', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'will', 'soon', 'get', 'extras-filled/commentary', 'version', '.maybe', 'explaination', 'guys', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'So', 'conclusion', 'can', 'see', 'easily', 'read', 'cheap', 'give', 'view', ""'re"", 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'yet', 'prepare', 'one', 'bad', 'trip', 'man', 'RedSabbath', 'Review:7.0/10']",Kids in the Hall - Brain Candy VHS

What the reviewers don't seem to recognize is that it takes a certain kind of outlook to appreciate this humor.  If it were as broad as the latest slapstick from a Hollywood dream  factory, it might be more widely accepted, but it simply wouldn't be as  GOOD.That said, one important point I feel I need to make is that the  depiction of depression and anti-depressants in this movie is almost TOO  accurate.  Anyone who's ever gone through the throes of chronic despair --  not just moodiness, but the actual disorder called depression -- knows  where the characters in this movie are coming from. I don't know whether  they intended to make a philosophical point or not, but one has to debate  with herself or himself: would I risk being one of the five percent if it  would get me off this morose jag?Fans of the Kids In the Hall TV series  will appreciate the in-references peppered throughout this movie -- Mrs.  Hurdicure, or the guy whose name escapes me who can't bring himself to  admit he's gay.  These references aren't overwhelming, however, so new  viewers with no familiarity won't feel overwhelmed by what seems like  in-jokes.

Many nice sub plots,  one about a married gay man (Thompson) who comes out of the closet, another  about a heavy metal singer named Grivo (McCulloch) and many more. You can't  take this movie seriously, I mean, it's the Kids in the Hall, come on! Also  stars Brendan Fraser and looks closely for Janeane Garofalo in a cameo  appearance.

Wauldron ""iamtoddicus""","[22, 24]","Dear readers, if you have never seen the Kids In The Hall series, you will not understand the nuances and brilliance of Brain Candy. If you have, you will feel like you have discovered the Holy Grail.Synopsis: researchers discover a pill to make everybody happy, and suffer the consequences. The great part, the Kids play all the parts, and there are little skits within the big picture.If you are expecting slapstick, forget it, this is sophisticated humor. The absurd rules. THIS is what the Kids are best at, and this is the best I have seen. From Canadian police trampled by people fleeing a public rest room, to catatonic test subjects, this film rocks. Kudos to Dave Foley, who made it big with NewsRadio (man do I hope they release that series on DVD). He plays the stright man the whole way through, and actually gets the meatiest parts. The rest wear dresses, but look pretty good....If you are a Welcome to Woop Woop fan, or a Monty Python fan, if you can find this movie, BUY IT!!

403325,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,6304125941,thecableguy,"[2, 2]","The Kids in the Hall were ahead of their time in their first feature (1996) with their pointed satirizing of the (still) current psychiatric drug craze. ""Brain Candy"" sews together various vignettes of dysfunctional people (all portrayed by KITH in different costumes) and centers them around a group of scientists at Roritor Pharmaceuticals who are developing Gleemonex, the ultimate anti-depressant. Gleemonex chemically guides patients to their happiest moment, and allows them to re-experience that moment's feeling forever. Chemically. As one of the scientists puts it: ""Gleemonex makes you feel like it's 72 degrees in your head. All the time.""The drug is a huge success, but tensions rise between the scientists and marketing department when some of the initial test patients become so caught up replaying their happiest memory they become comatose.The premise of ""Brain Candy"" is very similar to Hirokazu (""Nobody Knows"") Kore-eda's 1988 film ""After Life.""  In that film, social workers at a purgatory-ish way station assist the recently deceased with creating short films of their happiest memories, which will be replayed for eternity. ""After Life"" is an emotionally enriching, empowering film -- mainly because the characters are already dead; their lives and freedom on earth haven't been stolen and replaced. Chemically. I recommend watching the two films together sometime.I'm not sure what my final position on psychiatric drugs will be. I'm pretty certain no amount of talking will calm down someone who's just had a psychotic break, but I do think our society tends to rely too much on pills for long-term solutions, which makes ""Brain Candy"" fairly important viewing for those considering dealing with medicine, even if the film is generally silly and obnoxious. Personally, I see psychiatric drugs as a cast with talk therapy as an aid to properly set the bone. Though sometimes I feel like William Hurt in ""Accidental Tourist"" when my girlfriend insists I take my medicine when I lose my temper.Anyway, there were two endings shot for ""Brain Candy."" The filmmakers opted for the more upbeat one (though the film is still a downer overall.) I wish Paramount would release a special edition with the alternate ending, as well as some other cut scenes, including one featuring Janeane Garofalo. Until they do, you'll have to track down a bootleg from a fan.Pac-Man Fever",4,Possibly the most depressing comedy ever made,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2387,"['Kids', 'Hall', 'were', 'ahead', 'time', 'first', 'feature', '1996', 'pointed', 'satirizing', 'still', 'current', 'psychiatric', 'drug', 'craze', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'together', 'various', 'vignettes', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'portrayed', 'KITH', 'different', 'costumes', 'around', 'group', 'scientists', 'Roritor', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'who', 'are', 'developing', 'Gleemonex', 'ultimate', 'anti-depressant', 'Gleemonex', 'chemically', 'patients', 'happiest', 'moment', 're-experience', 'moment', 'feeling', 'forever', 'Chemically', 'one', 'scientists', 'Gleemonex', 'feel', '72', 'degrees', 'head', 'time', 'drug', 'huge', 'success', 'tensions', 'rise', 'scientists', 'marketing', 'department', 'when', 'initial', 'test', 'patients', 'become', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'replaying', 'happiest', 'memory', 'become', 'comatose.The', 'premise', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'very', 'similar', 'Hirokazu', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'Kore-eda', '1988', 'film', 'Life', 'film', 'social', 'workers', 'purgatory-ish', 'way', 'station', 'assist', 'recently', 'deceased', 'creating', 'short', 'films', 'happiest', 'memories', 'will', 'be', 'replayed', 'eternity', 'Life', 'emotionally', 'enriching', 'empowering', 'film', 'mainly', 'characters', 'are', 'already', 'dead', 'lives', 'freedom', 'earth', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'stolen', 'replaced', 'Chemically', 'recommend', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'sometime.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'final', 'position', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'will', 'be', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'certain', 'amount', 'talking', 'will', 'calm', 'down', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'psychotic', 'break', 'do', 'think', 'society', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'pills', 'long-term', 'solutions', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'fairly', 'important', 'viewing', 'considering', 'dealing', 'medicine', 'even', 'film', 'generally', 'silly', 'obnoxious', 'Personally', 'see', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'cast', 'talk', 'therapy', 'aid', 'properly', 'set', 'bone', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'take', 'medicine', 'when', 'lose', 'temper.Anyway', 'were', 'two', 'endings', 'shot', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'filmmakers', 'opted', 'more', 'upbeat', 'one', 'film', 'still', 'downer', 'overall', 'wish', 'Paramount', 'would', 'release', 'special', 'edition', 'alternate', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cut', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'featuring', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'do', ""'ll"", 'have', 'track', 'down', 'bootleg', 'fan.Pac-Man', 'Fever']",Kids in the Hall - Brain Candy VHS
