771752,A102RDJLOHWS0W,B0000BZNLI,"blackbird ""blackbird""","[2, 9]","They are here, all the episodes.  VERY BRITISH.  You know, a scream now and then, throwing china against walls ------one must wonder if the secret conversations of such puritanical females bring up accounts of the number of teacups that met their end smashed to pieces for the sake of something to talk about.  Violent vanities seem to appeal rather than real life.While there are so many women in various roles, which I like, there are many personality situations.  Some are dreadful examples of destructive anger which seem to be some kind of normal behavior for the modern life of women.  Complaining, whining, man haters in the finest of old tradition of faultless female suffering which is never of their own making whether real or imagined though usually the latter.  Punching men seems to be a modern proper rite of womanhood in these gardens.Unlike the simpleton emotions of most of the male characters in these plots, who let the punch occur, I would defend myself from predatory females.  Self defense.It seems as much a study of Victorian Puritanism in many women including the main two doing the sluething.  Violence seems as much their style as those they uncover.""To hell with men,"" agree the two in the first episode.  Emotional displays of anger and physical violence from both of them appear from time to time yet no remorse, completely unable to see the damage they do.As a try for humor I wish that somewhere in the episodes a character would say ""My wife, no, no, she won't be here for the celebration, she can't stand the sight of people enjoying themselves, makes her sick for days.""  It is an old joke that says much for the all-pure puritanical point of view.Anyway, I find it an extra, a well done screenplays full of human frailities at all levels.The acting is good in my opinion.  So is the music with basic themes.  Can't fault the scenery.  The smaller detective can look like a teenager in a bouncy bra and a pretty top.  Good for her.Episode One is a fine collection of psycho cases, especially men who believed the words of  killer women, thinking the female of the species is only made of sugar and spice and everything nice.Episode two has one our dynamic duo being shot at with bullets passing through a window while she goes into an anger which is finally expressed by her opening a door and yelling at the unknown shooter.  Not smart nor believable.  No search for bullets, no report.  Stupid.  It is a shame to display any woman that stupid.  Just an opinion.  Later they report it in a humerous incident which is clever.  But not real enough.Well, I'm not perfect either.  In series one, 2nd dvd, is a plot containing a dog who saves the life of one of the two of our girl stars.  And what does the doggy get for it?  A new life in a dog group home of some sort.  What?  What?  Well, these girl stars do seem to hate the world and take the hate out on we mere lowly humans and dogs.  Ruffled my feathers.  It's a secret plot theme perhaps.  Even the son of one of the girl stars seems to want to stay away from his mom.  Can't blame him or his father who now has a new 23 year old girl in his life.  I wonder what the older girl star did to him for years until he tossed her out?There is a fine number of rich arrogant snobs as well.  No vulgarity, well, of course not.Lots of wine and champagne.  Vases full of massive bouquets.Precious little pub grub.  No beer and sandwiches nor a ploughman lunch for our private detectives.  Quite uppity this duo.  Quite clean too often.In the last series we find a revolver being used in an unsafe way.  It may help a screenplay but idiotic firearm usuage is too stupid to accept as a good screenplay.That clever little poem spoken in a tent in the Elizabethan garden episode is a spicy gem.There is a little bit of carefully underplayed humor from time to time as in the housekeeper-cook who can't get better than putting a kettle on.  A grand character.  Just love her.There's always a dead body handy in a garden or a shed.  But not a pansy was injured nor a stock plant suffered disrespect.  Only the pride of the actors was trampled upon.  Shortage of daffodils is very upsetting.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[81, 83]","Most mystery series have big tough longtime cops or lovably eccentric oddballs as their detectives.So it's a bit refreshing to see a pair of utterly ordinary detectives in the light mystery series ""Rosemary and Thyme"" -- one a cop-turned-housewife, and one a feisty horticulturist. You won't find any mind-blowing mysteries, just solid whodunnits and likable characters... and plants. Lots and lots of beautiful plants.Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) has just been dumped by her husband of 27 years, for a ""twenty-three-year-old tart!"" When visiting an old pal, she encounters plant pathologist Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) who is promptly fired by her slimy boss. The two wronged women team together to solve a bizarre mystery involving poisonous plants, a car wreck, and a serial killer.After that, Rosemary and Laura go into business together, treating sick lawns and creating picturesque gardens. But like any good detectives, they keep bumping into sinister crimes, both of the past and present: a spa matriarch is strangled at her desk, skeletons are uncovered in a murdered pop star's garden, and a man is killed in a graveyard... with an arrow.Things don't improve much in the following seasons -- Rosemary and Laura end up dealing with wrecked romantic gardens, Parisian theft and murder, school pranks gone wrong, Italian restaurants, ferocious competition at a garden show, murder at a vineyard, sabotaged plays and tennis camps.... and even an abandoned baby that may have something to do with a murder.""Rosemary and Thyme"" is notable more for its cozy, cottagey feel than for its intricate mysteries -- but then again, they don't try to be complex or twisty. Instead, the stories focus on our likable horticulturists, and the lovely gardens they create or restore... and the entertaining dialogue (""You've broken the bloody window!"" Rosemary yells at a sniper) makes this even more fun.There's a pleasantly old-fashioned flavour to the series -- lots of vine-draped cottages, manorhouses, luxurious resorts, vineyards and herbal skills. Sure, there's laptops, TV shows, drug dealers and myriad cell phones. But those are just the trappings on an ordinary little mystery series, where the plant sicknesses often have something to do with the murders.Of course, the leads make or break a series like this.

771763,A1C70R9KCILEU,B0000BZNLI,Elle,"[4, 4]","Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme are full time gardeners and part-time nosey parkers or is that the other way round?  Either way, I found this series delightful!  I began viewing this lovely series on PBS a few years ago but my area station carried them in a hit and miss fashion--more miss than hit, so I ordered the complete set!  I have not regretted it one bit!From the very first episode, When No Birds Sing, the characters of Laura Thyme (played by the amazingly talented Pam Ferris, most recently of Call the Midwife) and Rosemary Boxer (played by the equally brilliant Felicity Kendal) jumped off of the screen and into my heart.  The series begins with Laura leaving her home and well tended, much beloved garden.  Her husband, Nick, of 27 years has left her for a younger woman, a 23-year old, thin-as-a-rail blonde!  Laura moans, it isn't her fault she got old! To make matters worse, if they can get worse, she has no income.  She was once a Police Constable but has not worked in many years in order to raise her two children and run the home.  She takes her packed bags and goes to the home of her husband's best mate. He and his wife promptly, but with some sympathy, deposit her at a local inn.  Is it simply a coincidence or is it providence that Ms. Rosemary Boxer, a professor of plant pathology, is also staying at the very same inn?  I say providence, absolutely! Rosemary is in the area at the behest of her university to diagnose some diseased, old, and rare trees.To avoid any spoilers, as one must meet these two without knowing ahead of time what will happen next; I'll just say that the two find that they are a match made in heaven.  They are first brought together by the mysterious death of a person to whom they both have connections.  After the mystery is solved, it is their love of gardens and kindred spirits that keep them together. Laura tells Rosemary, ""I don't miss my house at all but I really miss my garden!""They form a business partnership and travel hither and yon to work their gardening magic.  Along the way, these feisty, women of a ""certain age,"" who are suspicious of anything and anyone that strikes them as odd (and lucky for us that includes every single person they meet; people drop dead everywhere they go, friends and foes alike.) They solve murders while they garden. They are fearless, unabashed nosey parkers extraordinaire.  Together they are formidable and brazenly go around poking their collective noses into everyone's business.For me, it is a huge bonus that their gardening takes them to some breath-taking locales, which is the ""scene of the crime"" in each episode.  I don't care that it seems unbelievable that the two of them could pull off the masterpieces in botanical achievement that they do; I love these gardens! I want one! If you love English gardens, you will love those shown in this series.  Rosemary and Laura create and recreate a beautiful garden in each episode. Every scene includes stunning flower arrangements; hanging baskets dripping with blooms from every visible eave, even those attached to falling down sheds; historical ancient gardens (one of their restored gardens results in the visit by the Queen!) and flowers and plants of every color, kind and description imaginable.  The scenery is eye-popping. At solving murders, they turn out to be equally brilliant albeit there are some scrapes, bruises, twists, turns, stumbles, and a lot of luck involved along the way; lucky crime solving and lucky narrow escapes.  All in all, a lot of fun to watch! I'd love for Rosemary and Thyme to work a bit of their gardening magic at my home but I don't want anyone I know to be murdered!The ensuing episodes, 23 in all, offer delightful and entertaining mysteries without graphic forensics.",5,Intrepid Nosey Parkers Who Just Happen To Be Brilliant Gardeners!,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,3775,"['Rosemary', 'Boxer', 'Laura', 'Thyme', 'are', 'full', 'time', 'gardeners', 'part-time', 'nosey', 'parkers', 'other', 'way', 'way', 'found', 'series', 'delightful', 'began', 'viewing', 'lovely', 'series', 'PBS', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'area', 'station', 'carried', 'hit', 'miss', 'fashion', 'more', 'miss', 'hit', 'ordered', 'complete', 'set', 'have', 'not', 'regretted', 'one', 'bit', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'When', 'Birds', 'Sing', 'characters', 'Laura', 'Thyme', 'played', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'most', 'recently', 'Call', 'Midwife', 'Rosemary', 'Boxer', 'played', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Felicity', 'Kendal', 'jumped', 'screen', 'heart', 'series', 'Laura', 'leaving', 'home', 'well', 'tended', 'much', 'beloved', 'garden', 'husband', 'Nick', '27', 'years', 'left', 'younger', 'woman', '23-year', 'old', 'thin-as-a-rail', 'blonde', 'Laura', 'moans', ""n't"", 'fault', 'got', 'old', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'can', 'get', 'worse', 'income', 'was', 'once', 'Police', 'Constable', 'not', 'worked', 'many', 'years', 'order', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'run', 'home', 'packed', 'bags', 'home', 'husband', 'best', 'mate', 'wife', 'promptly', 'sympathy', 'deposit', 'local', 'inn', 'simply', 'coincidence', 'providence', 'Ms.', 'Rosemary', 'Boxer', 'professor', 'plant', 'pathology', 'also', 'staying', 'very', 'same', 'inn', 'say', 'providence', 'absolutely', 'Rosemary', 'area', 'behest', 'university', 'diagnose', 'diseased', 'old', 'rare', 'trees.To', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'one', 'must', 'meet', 'two', 'knowing', 'ahead', 'time', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'two', 'find', 'are', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'are', 'first', 'brought', 'together', 'mysterious', 'death', 'person', 'whom', 'have', 'connections', 'mystery', 'solved', 'love', 'gardens', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'keep', 'together', 'Laura', 'Rosemary', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'house', 'really', 'miss', 'garden', 'form', 'business', 'partnership', 'travel', 'hither', 'yon', 'work', 'gardening', 'magic', 'way', 'feisty', 'women', 'certain', 'age', 'who', 'are', 'suspicious', 'anything', 'anyone', 'odd', 'lucky', 'single', 'person', 'meet', 'people', 'drop', 'dead', 'everywhere', 'go', 'friends', 'foes', 'alike', 'solve', 'murders', 'garden', 'are', 'fearless', 'unabashed', 'nosey', 'parkers', 'extraordinaire', 'Together', 'are', 'formidable', 'brazenly', 'go', 'poking', 'collective', 'noses', 'everyone', 'business.For', 'huge', 'bonus', 'gardening', 'breath-taking', 'locales', 'scene', 'crime', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'unbelievable', 'two', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'masterpieces', 'botanical', 'achievement', 'do', 'love', 'gardens', 'want', 'one', 'love', 'English', 'gardens', 'will', 'love', 'shown', 'series', 'Rosemary', 'Laura', 'create', 'recreate', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'episode', 'scene', 'stunning', 'flower', 'arrangements', 'hanging', 'baskets', 'dripping', 'blooms', 'visible', 'eave', 'even', 'attached', 'falling', 'down', 'sheds', 'historical', 'ancient', 'gardens', 'one', 'restored', 'gardens', 'results', 'visit', 'Queen', 'flowers', 'plants', 'color', 'kind', 'description', 'imaginable', 'scenery', 'eye-popping', 'solving', 'murders', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'are', 'scrapes', 'bruises', 'twists', 'turns', 'stumbles', 'lot', 'luck', 'involved', 'way', 'lucky', 'crime', 'solving', 'lucky', 'narrow', 'escapes', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', ""'d"", 'love', 'Rosemary', 'Thyme', 'work', 'bit', 'gardening', 'magic', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'be', 'murdered', 'ensuing', 'episodes', '23', 'offer', 'delightful', 'entertaining', 'mysteries', 'graphic', 'forensics']",N/A

Lafleche-christian,"[16, 16]","Rosemary & Thyme is a British mystery series staring Felicity Kendal (Good Neighbors, The Camomille Lawn) and Pam Ferris (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Matilda) as gardening detectives. I first saw Felicity Kendal in Good Neighbors and fell in love with her sense of humor and personality. I was thrilled to find out that she brings that same down to earth personality to Rosemary & Thyme.  Rosemary & Thyme  was first aired on British television in 2003 and ran until August 2007.Both women are avid gardeners who are somehow embroiled in a bunch of different mysteries.  Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) is the daughter of a farmer and former police woman who loves her home garden. Her husband recently left her for another woman so she has extra time on her hands. Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) has a degree in plant pathology and was recently laid off from her University job by her underhanded ex-beau.The series begins with Rosemary investigating some dying trees at the home of a friend.  Laura's husband has just left her for a younger woman and she finds herself in the same hotel as Rosemary.  They meet and uncover a plot to kill Rosemary's friend.  Rosemary and Thyme consider themselves gardeners more than they consider themselves detectives.  The mysteries just happen to occur where they are solving a gardening problem or creating a new garden and they get involved in finding clues for the mystery as well.  I love how  naturally each of these mysteries unravels.  It's very easy to think of these women as *just like you* especially since they are average middle aged women and not your typical Barbie doll style actress. The two women's personalities mesh together perfectly as friends.Most of the episodes take place in various manor houses and gardens in England however some are shot in other countries as well.  Just a few of the more famous locations include London's Kew Gardens and Regent's Park; the French Riveria; Italy's Ligurian coast; a Surrey vineyard; and the hills of Malaga, Spain.  Being able to see all of these lovely, exotic gardens was one of the reasons that I enjoyed these mysteries so much.  If you're a gardener yourself or someone who loves to watch travel programs, you'll want to watch this series just for the pleasure of seeing the different locations. If you're also a fan of British mysteries, all the better. You'll find this show a delightful break from the violence and reality shows on television now.Rosemary & Thyme: The Complete Collection includes all 22 episodes on 7 discs.  There is approximately 18 1/2 hours of viewing time.  Series 1 ran in 2003.  Series 2 ran in 2004.  Series 3 ran from 2005 to 2007.

My wife and I are keen gardeners, so for us there is the added pleasure of seeing a series set in some lovely gardens.I do have a couple of reservations about it. First is personal; I've never really cared for Felicity Kendall. Ever since she came on the scene back in the 1970s with 'The Good Neighbors' (as it was titled in the US), she's always made me vaguely uncomfortable. She has a bit of a smug attitude, rather like the girl in school who knows she's the most popular girl of her year. I find Pam Ferris much more appealing; often she gets cast as someone nasty, like Aunt Marge in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or the terrifying school principal in Matilda, so it's nice to see her here as one of the good guys.My other slight misquiet is that the mysteries themselves are rather far-fetched. Trying to manufacture a crime in a garden setting and the involvement of two horticulturalists in the solving of the mystery needs some creative thinking on the part of those writing the screenplays, and it doesn't always come together very neatly. The locations are wonderful, the stories not so much- the plots are better than the plots, if you take my meaning.Still, it's beautiful and cosy and the theme music by John Williams (the classical guitarist, not the composer) is exqusite.

Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) is a former policewoman who has been abandoned by her philandering husband for a younger woman, and Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) is a plant biologist who lost her university teaching post. Together they are Rosemary & Thyme, and their adventures are played out against gorgeous English gardens, manorial landscapes, and the often stunning floral beauty of rural Britain. Volume 1 features six episodes, while Volume 2 has eight episodes. These are classic British-style 'whodunnits' with the viewer deeply engaged with every remarkable character, plot twist, and surprise ending.

Each episode runs 46 minutes, about an hour less than an episode of, say, ""Morse"": too brief to develop stories with depth and complexity; too long for stories lacking those qualities.If the BBC were to commission Disney Studios to do a mystery series, ""Rosemary & Thyme"" might be the result.

The characters of Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme are delightful and the two actresses, Felicity Kendall as Rosemary and Pam Ferris as Laura Thyme are perfect. The stories focus more on the characters than the murder, of which there is at least one per episode but it is not graphic or bloody. Kendall and Ferris seem to have the necessary chemistry to make the characters believable and their screen presence as good friend is genuine. Also the scenery in each episode is magnificent and is a large part of the series. I have read that filming the series takes place in many different gardens in England and there were two episodes shot in Europe, one in France and one in Italy. All in all a great series that is a pleasure to watch. I was sad to here that series 3 is the last and the show was dropped. I would really liked to have seen many more episodes.

I found myself cheering at times when they got the ""badies"".  The places they go to garden are a treat to view!  I loved seeing so many English gardens and some estates.  There were also about 4 episodes filmed in other countries, 2 Spain, 1 Italy and 1 France, if they were in the locations they talked about on the show. (I was unable to find a filming locations page for these shows.)If you want totally realistic, maybe think twice.  While the writing was good, sometimes I was miles ahead figuring out who did it, sometimes their actions were not what you even think the character would do, and there were by far way to many murders in each episode to be realistic.  That being said, the stories overall made sense, were quite varied and I enjoyed the writing.Simon Langton, the director of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice also directed many of these episodes.  You'll also notice at least 4 people who played in '95 P&P; appear in various episodes here.  Also 1 person who was in the '80 P&P; that I noticed.I highly recommend this if you enjoy British filming, scenery, light mysteries and likeable characters.",5,Great series!,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,1244,"['loved', 'series', 'Too', 'bad', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'U.S', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'most', 'part', 'relate-able', 'found', 'cheering', 'times', 'when', 'got', 'badies', 'places', 'go', 'garden', 'are', 'treat', 'view', 'loved', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'English', 'gardens', 'estates', 'were', 'also', 'about', '4', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'other', 'countries', '2', 'Spain', '1', 'Italy', '1', 'France', 'were', 'locations', 'talked', 'show', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'filming', 'locations', 'page', 'shows', 'want', 'totally', 'realistic', 'maybe', 'think', 'twice', 'writing', 'was', 'good', 'sometimes', 'was', 'miles', 'ahead', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'sometimes', 'actions', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'even', 'think', 'character', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'far', 'way', 'many', 'murders', 'episode', 'be', 'realistic', 'being', 'said', 'stories', 'overall', 'made', 'sense', 'were', 'quite', 'varied', 'enjoyed', 'writing.Simon', 'Langton', 'director', '1995', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'also', 'directed', 'many', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'also', 'notice', 'least', '4', 'people', 'who', 'played', ""'95"", 'P', 'P', 'appear', 'various', 'episodes', 'here', 'Also', '1', 'person', 'who', 'was', ""'80"", 'P', 'P', 'noticed.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'enjoy', 'British', 'filming', 'scenery', 'light', 'mysteries', 'likeable', 'characters']",N/A

Yes, every episode has a murder, and some are a bit gory, but the story lines are always interesting, and don't depend on the gory details (if they exist) to hold your attention.These 2 women are hired each week to solve someone's gardening problems, and the locations alone make watching the worthwhile. Nature abounds in all it's glory as the back drop for every story. Most of them take place in the UK, but they travel a bit in a couple episodes.There are also interesting tidbits for anyone who loves digging in the dirt and planting gardens, between Rosemary's background in Horticulture and Laura (Thyme)'s love of gardening and her down-to-earth 'old housewives tales'.And - a gold star for the writers of the show - These gals are organic - no chemicals and pesticides - except as the 'villans' in the 'plot', pardon the pun.If you haven't 'met' these lovely women and their wit and humor, check them out.
