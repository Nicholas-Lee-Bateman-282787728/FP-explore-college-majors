374488,A3759QIB6KMQZ2,6303439748,"Anthony Paul ""AP""","[3, 3]","This movie cannot compare to the earlier Stooges, but it is the best thing that Curly-Joe did with them. It is a must for Stooges fans. Everyone claims that the quality of the later Stooge endeavors is poor, due to thier  ages, or due to Curly-Joe not measuring up. While these reasons may be  attributes, the real problem is that the Stooges were forced to be less  violent in the 1960's, thus taking away from them their best material.  I  still believe that, left to their own devices, the Stooges could have made  great movies at the end of their carreers. In The Three Stooges Meet  Hercules, you'll see many glimpses of their former hilarity, but it's never  showcased.  Yet, it's still enjoyable!",4,It's not Curly or Shemp...but it's the best Curly-Joe,936662400,"09 7, 1999",1999,703,"['movie', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'earlier', 'Stooges', 'best', 'thing', 'Curly-Joe', 'did', 'must', 'Stooges', 'fans', 'Everyone', 'quality', 'later', 'Stooge', 'endeavors', 'poor', 'due', 'thier', 'ages', 'due', 'Curly-Joe', 'not', 'measuring', 'up', 'reasons', 'may', 'be', 'attributes', 'real', 'problem', 'Stooges', 'were', 'forced', 'be', 'less', 'violent', '1960', 'thus', 'taking', 'away', 'best', 'material', 'still', 'believe', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'Stooges', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'movies', 'end', 'carreers', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Meet', 'Hercules', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'glimpses', 'former', 'hilarity', 'never', 'showcased', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Three Stooges Meet Hercules VHS

Most of the DeRita features have very weak scripts and really embarrassing cringe-worthy childish storylines, something that generally only children and nostalgic aging Boomers actually like, but there are a handful of them that have pretty good scripts and supporting casts, such as this one.  It was also directed by the wonderful Ed Bernds, which might account for the surprisingly positive change in direction, going from bad kiddy fare to a movie that, while not nearly at the same level as classics like 'Hoi Polloi' or 'Brideless Groom,' can still be watched multiple times and be enjoyed by non-Boomers and people over the age of ten.  Under Bernds's direction, they look and act decades younger!  Sure there are some moments (like the scene with the hokey-looking Cyclops) that do seem geared to the kiddy matinee audience, but overall it's something that flows along seamlessly, a great plot that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  It doesn't even have the same dated quality as 'The Outlaws Is Coming!,' their other best DeRita feature, making it even stronger.  Even DeRita isn't as teeth-gratingly annoying as he usually is; he's tolerable so long as he stays in the background and is taken in small doses.  This picture also has their longtime supporting player Emil Sitka, which is always a good thing; another supporting player I really enjoyed was Samson Burke as Hercules.  He was so hilariously hammy!  And though there isn't that much slapstick in here (due to all of the parents who thought their kids would imitate their violent antics), it does feature in more than usual, complete with sound effects.  Probably the only thing I can find to really find fault with here is how Moe does a number of Curlyisms.  It's as embarrassing and cringe-worthy as it always is when he tries to imitate his (by that time deceased) baby brother's trademark noises and mannerisms.The only extra besides basics like scene selection is a self-congratulatory preview for the colorised DVDs that Columbia had released around this time.  Why wasn't an actual trailer for this movie included in lieu of that?  Although this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, given how no-frills their other Stooge DVDs are, barely any hint that they're DVDs and not video cassettes.  Overall, it's one of the few DeRita features I would recommend instead of urging people to steer well clear of.",4,Probably their best feature,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,2555,"['Not', 'saying', 'much', 'considering', 'type', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'DeRita', 'era', 'probably', 'best', 'starring', 'feature', 'did', 'Most', 'DeRita', 'features', 'have', 'very', 'weak', 'scripts', 'really', 'embarrassing', 'cringe-worthy', 'childish', 'storylines', 'something', 'generally', 'only', 'children', 'nostalgic', 'aging', 'Boomers', 'actually', 'are', 'handful', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'scripts', 'supporting', 'casts', 'such', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'directed', 'wonderful', 'Ed', 'Bernds', 'might', 'account', 'surprisingly', 'positive', 'change', 'direction', 'going', 'bad', 'kiddy', 'fare', 'movie', 'not', 'nearly', 'same', 'level', 'classics', ""'Hoi"", 'Polloi', ""'Brideless"", 'Groom', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'non-Boomers', 'people', 'age', 'ten', 'Bernds', 'direction', 'look', 'act', 'decades', 'younger', 'Sure', 'are', 'moments', 'scene', 'hokey-looking', 'Cyclops', 'do', 'seem', 'geared', 'kiddy', 'matinee', 'audience', 'overall', 'something', 'along', 'seamlessly', 'great', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'ages', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'same', 'dated', 'quality', ""'The"", 'Outlaws', 'Coming', 'other', 'best', 'DeRita', 'feature', 'making', 'even', 'stronger', 'Even', 'DeRita', ""n't"", 'teeth-gratingly', 'annoying', 'usually', 'tolerable', 'so', 'long', 'background', 'taken', 'small', 'doses', 'picture', 'also', 'longtime', 'supporting', 'player', 'Emil', 'Sitka', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'supporting', 'player', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Samson', 'Burke', 'Hercules', 'was', 'so', 'hilariously', 'hammy', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'slapstick', 'here', 'due', 'parents', 'who', 'thought', 'kids', 'would', 'imitate', 'violent', 'antics', 'feature', 'more', 'usual', 'complete', 'sound', 'effects', 'Probably', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'find', 'really', 'find', 'fault', 'here', 'how', 'Moe', 'number', 'Curlyisms', 'embarrassing', 'cringe-worthy', 'always', 'when', 'imitate', 'time', 'deceased', 'baby', 'brother', 'trademark', 'noises', 'only', 'extra', 'basics', 'scene', 'selection', 'self-congratulatory', 'preview', 'colorised', 'DVDs', 'Columbia', 'had', 'released', 'time', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'trailer', 'movie', 'included', 'lieu', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'given', 'how', 'no-frills', 'other', 'Stooge', 'DVDs', 'are', 'barely', 'hint', ""'re"", 'DVDs', 'not', 'video', 'cassettes', 'Overall', 'one', 'few', 'DeRita', 'features', 'would', 'recommend', 'instead', 'urging', 'people', 'steer', 'well', 'clear']",Three Stooges Meet Hercules VHS

It was fun to watch, and kept me engaged all the way through it. Even Moe Howard himself said that in 1962, this was a box-office smash upon its release, with lines often stretching all the way around the theatre block!The secret behind TSMH and the other Stooge films is clever scripting and direction. We're never painfully reminded we're watching comedians well into their sixties; Moe, Larry and Curly Joe (the final member to join the ranks)are able to function & clown superbly without performing major physical stunts. BTW, Curly Joe's character in these films seems to have a closer comic styling to Lou Costello than the original Curly. And he seems to be smarter (though not by much!).Another factor is the satirical jokes & modern-day references that make TSMH seem fresh & funny. Mel Brooks must've mined the humor for his ""History of the World"" comedy, which coincidentally, includes a Roman sketch.And there's even throwbacks to the early Stooge days: the familiar sound effects and pie-throwing (done during the chariot race climax).If you've never seen the Stooges during their 60's career revival, this is a good film to start with!",5,The knuckleheads meet the musclehead,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,1211,"['arguably', 'best', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'feature', 'bunch', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'kept', 'engaged', 'way', 'Even', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'said', '1962', 'was', 'box-office', 'smash', 'release', 'lines', 'often', 'stretching', 'way', 'theatre', 'block', 'secret', 'TSMH', 'other', 'Stooge', 'films', 'clever', 'scripting', 'direction', ""'re"", 'never', 'painfully', 'reminded', ""'re"", 'watching', 'comedians', 'well', 'sixties', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'Joe', 'final', 'member', 'join', 'ranks', 'are', 'able', 'function', 'clown', 'superbly', 'performing', 'major', 'physical', 'stunts', 'BTW', 'Curly', 'Joe', 'character', 'films', 'have', 'closer', 'comic', 'styling', 'Lou', 'Costello', 'original', 'Curly', 'be', 'smarter', 'not', 'much', 'factor', 'satirical', 'jokes', 'modern-day', 'references', 'make', 'TSMH', 'seem', 'fresh', 'funny', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'must', ""'ve"", 'mined', 'humor', 'History', 'World', 'comedy', 'coincidentally', 'Roman', 'sketch.And', 'even', 'throwbacks', 'early', 'Stooge', 'days', 'familiar', 'sound', 'effects', 'pie-throwing', 'done', 'chariot', 'race', 'climax', '.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Stooges', '60', 'career', 'revival', 'good', 'film', 'start']",Three Stooges Meet Hercules VHS
374507,A14I90JCYYG9SI,6303439748,Robert M. Khoury,"[0, 0]","This is my favorite Three Stooges' film.  The story is pretty good.  The casting is pretty good.  The characters are pretty good, especially Hercules.  However, Moe looks old, very old.  Those are not bags under his eyes.  It's luggage.  Sadly, there is not enough of that famous Three Stooges violence.  Yes, there is a pie throwing scene.  And the sound effects are the same.  But there is no eye poking and way too little face slapping and head hammering.  Also missing are Curly's Curlyisms and there is not enough good material with Larry.  This film could have been cast with Abbott and Costello without changing a thing.  By the early sixties, it was too late to expect the Three Stooges to be fresh, original, and daring.  They were a brand.  And like any brand, they knew what you had a right to expect from them and what they had a right to expect from you.  So there is just enough of them in this film to satisfy their audience, but not enough to please them.  Still, I highly recommend it.

""Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze"" is a close second. This film proved that the Stooges comedy could be maintained in a feature film, the one thing Moe and Larry wanted after the 25 years of making short features. And it was an excellent film, especially after the abominable ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"". The only drawback, like the other Stooges features, is that there are no special features.

It grossed about two million dollars at the box office, exceeding expectations, and landed the Stooges a three-picture deal. Those three would turn out to be Three Stooges in Orbit, Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze, and Outlaws is Coming. Two million gross at the box office is pathetic these days, but it was substantial 43 years ago.People already know the premise of this film. It's repeated several times on this page. But this is the type of film anyone with an appreciation of comedy would like. Be it a five year old or a 75 year old. It's just a fun, quick-paced, and clean film. I'm a Stooges fan, and this is one of my favorite things they ever did, including their short films.This flick is the best place for anyone to start in the DeRita era, which tends to be frowned upon by many Stooge fans, but I liked DeRita. He was a good actor.5 stars for the movie, but until proven otherwise, the actual DVD will get a 1 or a 2. These pictures were filmed in the 1:66 to 1 aspect ratio, but Columbia has typically released with in 1:85 to 1. This crops the picture somewhat, but the average fan won't notice.
