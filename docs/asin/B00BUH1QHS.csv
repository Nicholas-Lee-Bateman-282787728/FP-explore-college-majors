He has to deal with so many challenges both physically & mentally While playing the rounds such as figuring out what to do with the limited clues he was given, dealing with a kid he was forced to kidnap named Tommy Weaver (Tom Stevens), Det. McKenzie (Venus Terzo) & the police coming after him, and trying to put all the pieces together of what the connection is with everyone involved in the rounds including a missing Governor with Heller telling him that it's all about ""balancing the scales of justice.""This was one of those sequels that has no connection to the previous movie past it being the same concept which in this case was having to complete a dangerous task in a limited amount of time or else face severe consequences.  This version of ""12 Rounds"" was heavily different than the first one as this was set to be more adult & darker with all the events taking place throughout the night, more foul language, some moments of dark humor based off the stupidity of Tommy, and an scene of simulated sex & nudity & drugs.  The first movie came off more like an adrenaline rush with each round being a more dangerous stunt than the previous one but this one fell flat to me so I would only recommend this for a rental or stream but nothing more past that.",3,"""The Scales Of Justice Are Unbalanced""",1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1638,"['Randy', 'Orton', 'Nick', 'Malloy', 'EMT', 'who', 'going', 'movie', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Cindy', 'Busby', 'witness', 'car', 'accident', 'resulted', 'fatality', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'when', 'received', 'phone', 'call', 'mysterious', 'man', 'named', 'Patrick', 'Heller', 'Brian', 'Markinson', 'threatening', 'wife', 'safety', 'game', '12', 'Rounds', 'deal', 'so', 'many', 'challenges', 'physically', 'mentally', 'playing', 'rounds', 'such', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'limited', 'clues', 'was', 'given', 'dealing', 'kid', 'was', 'forced', 'kidnap', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Weaver', 'Tom', 'Stevens', 'Det', 'McKenzie', 'Venus', 'Terzo', 'police', 'coming', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'what', 'connection', 'everyone', 'involved', 'rounds', 'including', 'missing', 'Governor', 'Heller', 'telling', 'balancing', 'scales', 'justice', 'was', 'one', 'sequels', 'connection', 'previous', 'movie', 'being', 'same', 'concept', 'case', 'was', 'having', 'complete', 'dangerous', 'task', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'else', 'face', 'severe', 'consequences', 'version', '12', 'Rounds', 'was', 'heavily', 'different', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'more', 'adult', 'darker', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'night', 'more', 'foul', 'language', 'moments', 'dark', 'humor', 'based', 'off', 'stupidity', 'Tommy', 'scene', 'simulated', 'sex', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'round', 'being', 'more', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'previous', 'one', 'one', 'fell', 'flat', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'rental', 'stream', 'nothing', 'more']",12 Rounds 2: Reloaded

1639275,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BUH1QHS,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","Who would have thought several years back that one of the biggest stars in movies would be a wrestler from the WWE? Most people thought of wrestlers as little more than muscle bound oafs with nothing going on except their next gig. The truth of the matter is that these members of sports entertainment do more acting in one day than many professional actors making it to the screen. So for myself I found it not too surprising that some would make it in movies. The Rock has done it rising to the top of the action film scene. John Cena was heading that way but seems to have disappeared. Battista has done one movie and is scheduled for another big screen film. And now they can add the name of Randy Orton to the list.Orton stars in the just released 12 ROUNDS 2: RELOADED. Cena starred in the first film in this series where for one reason or another a criminal forces our hero to run through a gauntlet of 12 obstacles to save someone he cares about. It would have been odd for the same character to do so again so Orton gives us a new hero.Orton stars as Nick Malloy, an EMT who witnesses a car accident while walking with his wife. He tries to save a young woman injured but knows there is no hope for her. Rescuing the young man whose car ran into the other, he saves him. But it's the loss of life with the woman that plagues him.A year later and Malloy and his partner are called out to help someone at a remote location. When they get there they find a man with his mouth taped shut and something inserted into his stomach. Malloy's phone goes off and a man tells him to get out of the ambulance and move away, threatening to harm his wife if he doesn't do so. Malloy realizes he is being watched by things the voice says. When he hears something odd in the ambulance he tells his partner to get out but not before the bomb planted inside the victim explodes. Malloy's partner is injured but alive and the voice instructs Malloy to follow instructions to the letter, sending him off to a new location with only so much time to make it.Eventually, as with the previous film, we have a villain who wants revenge for being wronged. In this case, and no this isn't a spoiler since we got lots of this in the trailer, we discover that the woman who died a year ago was his wife. Now he's taking revenge on everyone involved in the incident, from Malloy who failed to save her to members of the justice system who allowed the young man who rammed them to skate off with a slap on the wrist.Going from one location to the next, Malloy must not only follow the instructions given (which of course include not calling the police) but try and solve the puzzle of who is giving the instructions and why. We viewers might realize early on but those in the middle of things are hard pressed to find answers right away. The villain moves Malloy to a point where he must take along a young man he's led to with him to the next stop.This turns out to be Tommy, the young man who killed his wife.But the revenge doesn't just involve these two. Along the trip the villain takes them down they find several others who failed to serve justice in this case, everyone from a judge to a defense attorney. No one will escape the wrath of this bad guy. With the clock ticking and 12 different goals to achieve, will Malloy be able to find out what is going on and save his wife, held hostage by this man?The movie is quite well made with a technical quality some wouldn't expect to find in a modestly budgeted film. The acting by all on board is kept in check and Orton, while being his first time out, does show great potential to be another break out star as long as good projects continue to come his way.While Oscar contenders won't lose sleep over films like this, movie fans will have something worth renting or buying the next time they go out. It delivers the action on all counts and makes an enjoyable film worth watching.",3,ANOTHER WWE STAR WITH POTENTIAL,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3917,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'wrestler', 'WWE', 'Most', 'people', 'thought', 'wrestlers', 'little', 'more', 'muscle', 'oafs', 'nothing', 'going', 'next', 'gig', 'truth', 'matter', 'members', 'sports', 'entertainment', 'do', 'more', 'acting', 'one', 'day', 'many', 'professional', 'actors', 'making', 'screen', 'So', 'found', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'would', 'make', 'movies', 'Rock', 'done', 'rising', 'top', 'action', 'film', 'scene', 'John', 'Cena', 'was', 'heading', 'way', 'have', 'disappeared', 'Battista', 'done', 'one', 'movie', 'scheduled', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'now', 'can', 'add', 'name', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'list.Orton', 'just', 'released', '12', 'ROUNDS', '2', 'RELOADED', 'Cena', 'starred', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'where', 'one', 'reason', 'criminal', 'forces', 'hero', 'run', 'gauntlet', '12', 'obstacles', 'save', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'odd', 'same', 'character', 'do', 'so', 'again', 'Orton', 'new', 'hero.Orton', 'stars', 'Nick', 'Malloy', 'EMT', 'who', 'car', 'accident', 'walking', 'wife', 'save', 'young', 'woman', 'injured', 'knows', 'hope', 'Rescuing', 'young', 'man', 'car', 'ran', 'other', 'loss', 'life', 'woman', 'him.A', 'year', 'later', 'Malloy', 'partner', 'are', 'called', 'out', 'help', 'someone', 'remote', 'location', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'find', 'man', 'mouth', 'taped', 'shut', 'something', 'inserted', 'stomach', 'Malloy', 'phone', 'off', 'man', 'get', 'ambulance', 'move', 'away', 'threatening', 'harm', 'wife', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'Malloy', 'being', 'watched', 'things', 'voice', 'When', 'something', 'odd', 'ambulance', 'partner', 'get', 'out', 'not', 'bomb', 'planted', 'victim', 'explodes', 'Malloy', 'partner', 'injured', 'alive', 'voice', 'Malloy', 'follow', 'instructions', 'letter', 'sending', 'off', 'new', 'location', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'make', 'it.Eventually', 'previous', 'film', 'have', 'villain', 'who', 'revenge', 'being', 'wronged', 'case', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'got', 'lots', 'trailer', 'discover', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'wife', 'Now', 'taking', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'involved', 'incident', 'Malloy', 'who', 'failed', 'save', 'members', 'justice', 'system', 'who', 'allowed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'rammed', 'skate', 'off', 'slap', 'wrist.Going', 'one', 'location', 'next', 'Malloy', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'follow', 'instructions', 'given', 'course', 'include', 'not', 'calling', 'police', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'who', 'giving', 'instructions', 'why', 'viewers', 'might', 'realize', 'early', 'middle', 'things', 'are', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'answers', 'right', 'away', 'villain', 'moves', 'Malloy', 'point', 'where', 'must', 'take', 'along', 'young', 'man', 'led', 'next', 'stop.This', 'out', 'be', 'Tommy', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'wife.But', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'just', 'involve', 'two', 'trip', 'villain', 'down', 'find', 'several', 'others', 'who', 'failed', 'serve', 'justice', 'case', 'everyone', 'judge', 'defense', 'attorney', 'one', 'will', 'escape', 'wrath', 'bad', 'guy', 'clock', 'ticking', '12', 'different', 'goals', 'achieve', 'will', 'Malloy', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'save', 'wife', 'held', 'hostage', 'man', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'made', 'technical', 'quality', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'film', 'acting', 'board', 'kept', 'check', 'Orton', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'show', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'break', 'out', 'star', 'as', 'long', 'good', 'projects', 'continue', 'come', 'way.While', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'sleep', 'films', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'worth', 'renting', 'buying', 'next', 'time', 'go', 'out', 'action', 'counts', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watching']",12 Rounds 2: Reloaded

1639281,A3D28SE0H060MU,B00BUH1QHS,Ryan,"[1, 2]","WWE Studios has a bad habit of continuing every franchise, regardless of whether the narratives match up or any of the original cast members are willing to return. They simply see the opportunity to latch on to any minor previous success in order to completely bleed it dry of profit. All of the straight-to-home-entertainment sequels from this studio have a recycled production line feel about them, making the product a shadow of the original product.The one perk that the studio has found from using a fresh cast with the sequels is the opportunity it provides for more ""professional"" wrestlers in the WWE lineup. 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded is Randy Orton's turn to step into the action hero role, with a terrorist-type storyline that is similar to the original 12 Rounds. Paramedic Nick Malloy (Orton) is pulled into the sick games of a psychopath (Brian Markinson) seeking revenge for an incident in the past, resulting in the title rounds. These rounds are not referring to the ammunition of a weapon, but instead reference the levels of the game that Malloy is forced to play in order to protect the one he loves.A premise such as this provides an opportunity for endless creativity, especially since the film is not tied down by anything from the original movie. It would seem that they could have had a lot of fun with the action sequences, but much of this movie instead quietly plods along the expected routes, hardly even making proper use of the set-up. Even for a sloppy sequel, too much of the film's action is completely forgettable.The Blu-ray release includes a commentary track with director Roel Rein&eacute; and editor Radu Ion, along with a featurettes about Orton, the locations and the action in the film.

I actually did like it better than Part 1, which I also liked and enjoyed. This one had more of a story line in my opinion, and I loved the way it was constantly revealing more of that story line. I am an Action Movie Junkie, but this movie is not as action packed as most of movies, but I still loved it. I've already watched it twice, and I plan to watch both parts 1 and 2 this weekend.The biggest surprise to me is the Randy Orton can really act. He did a great job!

1639288,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00BUH1QHS,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","WWE Films continue to surprise, giving us a string of terrific action thrillers from an unlikely source. Their latest straight to video release is a sequel to 2009s, 12 Rounds. While Randy Orton wasn't nearly as good as John Cena was in the first film, he gives a more than adequate performance as Nick Molloy, a paramedic who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. After failing to save a rich mans wife at the scene of a drunk driving accident, the man decides to punish all those involved, including the paramedic who failed to save her. The story here is pretty solid, especially for an action film, but what bothers me is that this sequel was in no way connected to the first film. Reloaded is a different story in a different city, with an entirely different cast, so how did the bad guy manage to come up with the same game, from four years earlier? As for that game, the rounds weren't as long or as complicated, but what really makes this better than your average action movie is the compelling back story and the depth of the characters involved. Randy Orton, while having very limited film experience was pretty good and that will come as a surprise to many. It's hard to think of WWE Superstars as actors, but that is exactly what they are. Aside from wrestling in their underwear every week, they have to play a charterer and follow a script 52 weeks a year, so is this really such a stretch? For the most part the WWE Superstars have made for some pretty exciting action stars. The supporting cast of this film was also very good, in particular Tom Stevens, formerly of the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Stevens plays Tommy, another person caught up in this madman's game, and he is not only thrilling and charismatic, but he's pretty funny too. 12 Rounds 2 won't win any awards, but it is 90 minutes of non-stop action, packaged in a compelling story, which I found to be extremely entertaining.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1912,"['WWE', 'Films', 'continue', 'surprise', 'giving', 'string', 'terrific', 'action', 'thrillers', 'unlikely', 'source', 'latest', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'sequel', '2009s', '12', 'Rounds', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'John', 'Cena', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'more', 'adequate', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Molloy', 'paramedic', 'who', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'failing', 'save', 'rich', 'mans', 'wife', 'scene', 'drunk', 'driving', 'accident', 'man', 'punish', 'involved', 'including', 'paramedic', 'who', 'failed', 'save', 'story', 'here', 'pretty', 'solid', 'especially', 'action', 'film', 'what', 'bothers', 'sequel', 'was', 'way', 'connected', 'first', 'film', 'Reloaded', 'different', 'story', 'different', 'city', 'entirely', 'different', 'cast', 'how', 'did', 'bad', 'guy', 'manage', 'come', 'up', 'same', 'game', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'game', 'rounds', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'long', 'as', 'complicated', 'what', 'really', 'better', 'average', 'action', 'movie', 'compelling', 'back', 'story', 'depth', 'characters', 'involved', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'having', 'very', 'limited', 'film', 'experience', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'many', 'hard', 'think', 'WWE', 'Superstars', 'actors', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'Aside', 'wrestling', 'underwear', 'week', 'have', 'play', 'charterer', 'follow', 'script', '52', 'weeks', 'year', 'so', 'really', 'such', 'stretch', 'most', 'part', 'WWE', 'Superstars', 'have', 'made', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'action', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'particular', 'Tom', 'Stevens', 'formerly', 'Diary', 'A', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'series', 'Stevens', 'Tommy', 'person', 'caught', 'up', 'madman', 'game', 'not', 'only', 'thrilling', 'charismatic', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too', '12', '2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', '90', 'minutes', 'non-stop', 'action', 'packaged', 'compelling', 'story', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'entertaining']",12 Rounds 2: Reloaded
