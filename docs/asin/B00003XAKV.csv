While the story of old school friends reuniting for a fun in the surf and sun theme is non-offensive, the screenplay is.  Probably produced as a low-budget summer flick, Blue Juice is a moronic effort that  tries to present too many characters in ridiculous situations.  Never released in theaters in the US and only transferred to video after Ewan McGregor became noticed after the last Lucas film, Blue Juice stars Sean Pertwee as an over the hill at 30 beach bum with a very young and cute Catherine Zeta Jones as his girlfriend.  Their romatic interludes and relationship is threatened by the unexpected and uninvited appearance of Pertwee's three stooges-like friends from London up for a male bonding weekend.  Although excellent supporting actors like Stephen Macintosh and Ewan McGregor present believable characters they can not sustain this stinker.  The film falters and fails to be entertaining although younger fans of McGregor will no doubt enjoy this little ditty.  Predictable, lacking originality, but possibly rental material, Blue Juice is the kind of film every actor has listed on their resume of past credits and wishes they could forget.",2,WIPEOUT!,994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,1302,"['film', 'British', 'surfer', 'pals', 'co-starring', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'Blue', 'Juice', 'story', 'old', 'school', 'friends', 'reuniting', 'fun', 'surf', 'sun', 'theme', 'non-offensive', 'screenplay', 'Probably', 'produced', 'low-budget', 'summer', 'flick', 'Blue', 'Juice', 'moronic', 'effort', 'present', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'Never', 'released', 'theaters', 'US', 'only', 'transferred', 'video', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'became', 'noticed', 'last', 'Lucas', 'film', 'Blue', 'Juice', 'stars', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'hill', '30', 'beach', 'bum', 'very', 'young', 'cute', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'girlfriend', 'romatic', 'interludes', 'relationship', 'threatened', 'unexpected', 'uninvited', 'appearance', 'Pertwee', 'three', 'stooges-like', 'friends', 'London', 'up', 'male', 'bonding', 'weekend', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Stephen', 'Macintosh', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'present', 'believable', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'sustain', 'stinker', 'film', 'falters', 'fails', 'be', 'entertaining', 'younger', 'fans', 'McGregor', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'little', 'ditty', 'Predictable', 'lacking', 'originality', 'possibly', 'rental', 'material', 'Blue', 'Juice', 'kind', 'film', 'actor', 'listed', 'resume', 'past', 'credits', 'wishes', 'could', 'forget']",N/A

The plot really comes down to whether it is better to live as a free spirit, throwing caution to the wind, or whether there is a time to settle down. There is an on again, off again romance here. Some of the architecture and natural backdrops for this film are excellent. I felt the acting was at times indifferent, and something was just a bit disjointed about it, but I still enjoyed it overall.

546771,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00003XAKV,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[17, 21]","I've never been much for surfing movies.  Only 2 reasons why I picked up this aqua-attempt @ a movie:(1)  It stars Catherine Zeta-Jones(2)  It was under [money]Unfortunately, I regretted my decision to purchase it.  The plot centers around an over-the-hill past-his-prime surfer (Sean Pertwee - NOT the fellow on the cover) who feels it incumbent that he surf a dangerous coral & rock infested area known as ""the boneyard.""  Why?  you ask.  Well, so he can land a good-for-nothing friend of his a job @ a 2nd-rate newspaper.  Contrived, you say?  Yep, you're right!  Of course, being that this is a surf film, they elevate the task to the stature of Hektor travelling outside the gates to protect his beloved city of Troy.The only other surf movie I recall seeing is POINT BREAK.  Two factors make BLUE JUICE a better movie than POINT BREAK:(1)  POINT BREAK included Keanu Reeves in its cast, BLUE JUICE did not.(2)  BLUE JUICE included Catherine Zeta-Jones in its cast.  POINT BREAK did not.Furthermore, there are only 2 factors that entice one to watch BLUE JUICE @ all:(1)  Catherine Zeta-Jones looks terrific in a bikini.(2)  Catherine Zeta-Jones looks terrific in lingerie.Other than that, this film is a wash.  There is one scene in which one of the main characters is getting pummeled by 3-4 guys.  Ostensibly, we're supposed to have sympathy for him.  Actually, the fellow was so obnoxious that I was rooting for the lads who were belting him.Even Cahterine Zeta-Jones fans will have a hard time stomaching this DVD.  In truth, she is only in about 15% of the story.  The rest of the film details 4 guys meandering around the English countryside doing asinine things.  Likewise, fans of surf movies probably won't get too much out of this film, either.  There's only about maybe 7 minutes of surfing in the entire disc, and none of IT is particularly exciting.",1,"No dude, the surf is NOT up",1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,1868,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'surfing', 'movies', 'Only', '2', 'reasons', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'aqua-attempt', '@', 'movie', '1', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', '2', 'was', '[', 'money', ']', 'Unfortunately', 'regretted', 'decision', 'purchase', 'plot', 'centers', 'over-the-hill', 'past-his-prime', 'surfer', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'NOT', 'fellow', 'cover', 'who', 'incumbent', 'surf', 'dangerous', 'coral', 'rock', 'infested', 'area', 'known', 'boneyard', 'Why', 'ask', 'Well', 'can', 'land', 'good-for-nothing', 'friend', 'job', '2nd-rate', 'newspaper', 'Contrived', 'say', 'Yep', ""'re"", 'right', 'course', 'being', 'surf', 'film', 'elevate', 'task', 'stature', 'Hektor', 'travelling', 'gates', 'protect', 'beloved', 'city', 'Troy.The', 'only', 'other', 'surf', 'movie', 'recall', 'seeing', 'POINT', 'BREAK', 'Two', 'factors', 'make', 'BLUE', 'JUICE', 'better', 'movie', 'POINT', 'BREAK', '1', 'POINT', 'BREAK', 'included', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'cast', 'BLUE', 'JUICE', 'did', 'not', '2', 'BLUE', 'JUICE', 'included', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'cast', 'POINT', 'BREAK', 'did', 'not.Furthermore', 'are', 'only', '2', 'factors', 'entice', 'one', 'watch', 'BLUE', 'JUICE', '@', '1', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'terrific', 'bikini', '2', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'terrific', 'lingerie.Other', 'film', 'wash', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'getting', 'pummeled', '3-4', 'guys', 'Ostensibly', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Actually', 'fellow', 'was', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'was', 'rooting', 'lads', 'who', 'were', 'belting', 'him.Even', 'Cahterine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'stomaching', 'DVD', 'truth', 'only', 'about', '15', '%', 'story', 'rest', 'film', 'details', '4', 'guys', 'meandering', 'English', 'countryside', 'doing', 'asinine', 'things', 'Likewise', 'fans', 'surf', 'movies', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'either', 'only', 'about', 'maybe', '7', 'minutes', 'surfing', 'entire', 'disc', 'none', 'IT', 'particularly', 'exciting']",N/A
546772,A2Y0YDC6NVW1S2,B00003XAKV,Emily Padden,"[0, 0]","I'm a surfer from NYC, so the minute I found out that there was a Britsh surfing movie I was in. (I love finding out about different, not expected places that people surf and the communities they come from.) Originally I rented this via Netflix and I was psyched to see Catherine Zeta Jones was in it, and then later realized that Ewan Mcgregor is also in it. Less psyched though when I realized that Catherine's character doesn't surf; unfortunately she gets relegated to the ""surfer's girlfriend"" role. (A decent part, but still.) Also, do not go by Ewan's appearance on the cover; that's decieving because he isn't at all the lead (he's one of the surf buddies in the group), and he doens't look like that in the movie.All that being said, I found the movie interesting enough that it ended up on my Amazon wish list. The movie is basically about a few days in the lives of a group of English surf buddies, waiting until the swell gets good enought to ride on. I thought it was really cool look at the Cornwall surf community, and being a teenager of the 90s I found myself a little nostolgic for things that popped up in the movie. (Various questionable fashion / life choices, at one point a rave is featured...) No, there's not a whole lot of crazy British surfing going on, but the characters definitely have a love of surfing, and to me that's equally as important. I mean, how much of a soul surfer do you have to be to wait around at a spot that gets pumping only for a little while a couple of times a year? That's dedication. Plus the characters really like where they live - they wait for that perfect moment rather than to just go somewhere else. That puts a deeper value on when you actually surf, I feel.So if you're expecting a fantastic, pre-star, action packed movie, this may not be for you. If, however, you want a glimpse at one British surfing community and a fun watch, then go ahead and purchase this. :)Oh, and Sean Pertwee? Not bad to look at in a wetsuit.

546773,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003XAKV,"""flickjunkie""","[10, 12]","The only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves.  For viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.The story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all.  J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard.  The trouble is, there are no waves until the very end of the film, so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.The acting is mostly mediocre.  Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments, but his acting was generally mundane.  Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch.  Probably the funniest performance was turned in by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.There is really not much here on which to comment.  I rated it a 3/10.

This is a British film that stars some guy I've seen in other obscure movies with  Catherine and Ewan as B-characters. Something was weird with Catherine, she  had no eye makeup or something, it was quite distracting. Ewan was cool,  and played a familiar stereotype he has perfected, the druggy loser. I  didn't quite understand the tone of the picture. I thought it was going to  be a romantic adventure film, Point Break with kissing. Not even close. It  seems like it wants to be a beach movie, but the jokes are few and far  between, not to mention not funny. Some go by so fast that, because of the  dialect, are practically indecipherable. For a surf movie, there is  surprisingly little surfing, and I found myself fast-forwarding through a  lot of babbling (a staple of British filmmaking).
