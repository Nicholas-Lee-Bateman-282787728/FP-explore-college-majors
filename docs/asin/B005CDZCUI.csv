It is a great anime for someone who is looking to see what anime is about and can be about.

1453747,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B005CDZCUI,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[2, 2]","Ryuji and Taiga meet by coincidence. As it turns out, they have a crush on each others best friend. They also happen to live next door to each other. Despite their totally different backgrounds and attitudes, they decide to team up and help the other get close to the ones they love. As time passes, the pair begins to feel something comforting and natural about being with one another. What will they do about the feelings they have had all this time? What will they do about the new feelings that have surfaced? One thing is for sure. In a love pentagon, a few hearts are bound to be broken.This series starts off kind of silly. It actually remains that way most of the way through. At the same time, it deals with very serious and intense emotions. There are times when I thought, "" oh my gosh, this is stupid"". There were also times when I almost cried . It's a lot like Clannad or Kanon in that regard. There are a lot of great characters, plot twists, and plenty of emotion to go around. The production quality of this series is also very good. The animation, soundtrack, and voice actors are all top notch.I do have a few issues with Toradora though. I really wish it was dubbed, for one. It's hard to relax when you're undivided attention  is focused on reading subs. You can't turn away for a second because much of the dialogue is very important. My other problem is the ending. It's not the worst ending I've ever seen, but it doesn't seem to fit. After all the characters had been through together, you would expect them to be different. That's all I'll say about that though.Despite my 2 issues with Toradora, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I think it ranks up inn my top 10 anime dramas ever. It's also kind of expensive like many other anime series out there. I got mine from  PlayTech-Asia.com. The entire series comes on 2 DVDs and it cost under $30. I highly recommend this series to any anime fan, and I suggest checking out the deal PlayTech-Asia has on it.

1453750,A2BF3Z1UOWFBY,B005CDZCUI,Upright Ape,"[6, 53]","There is a very big problem with Toradora.  Unfortunately, I can't tell you what it is without a caveat, because it's a major spoiler.So here it is: spoiler warning.  If you don't want to know why this series belongs in the trash, don't continue reading.  Watch the series instead, and find out for yourself.Spoiler ahead....All right then, here goes.  The very big problem with Toradora is the ending.  As with too many Anime series, the writers have been incapable of finishing the story without tossing an incredibly inane reversal in the faces of the viewers.I'm not sure why the other reviewers haven't mentioned this.  Maybe they're OK with this sort of thing for some reason.  I am not.  I am especially not OK in the case of Toradora because the reversal, while as extremely disappointing as such reversals can be, was also completely preposterous.  As in, ""never mind everything that the characters have been saying, doing, and feeling up to this point.  We'll do just the opposite, because this is Opposite Day.""That's it in a general nutshell.  The reversal of everything established in the series up to that point is executed with such an arbitrary abandon of logic and continuity that it completely wrecks the entire mood of the series.Still want details?  OK: after a very touching, romantic scene between Ryuji and Taiga at his granparents' house, and after Ryuji has succeeded in reuniting his mother with his grandparents, and after Ryuji and Taiga have repeated their promise that the ""Dragon and the Tiger shall always be at one another's side"", Taiga leaves.  Gone.  Out of the picture.She abruptly leaves after She, Ryuji, and his mother return to their homes.  She says she will return for supper after she meets with her own mother in her apartment.  Only in her apartment, she finds that her mother has left.  There are a number of frantic, angry, (other emotions) messages left on her cell.  She listens to parts of a few of those, then goes out on her balcony.There is one star in the sky.  She now decides that she is that star, and must learn to shine on her own, ""so I can love him"".  Then she's shown walking away with a suitcase.Later we learn that she's returned to live with her mother.  Guess it's time for Taiga to learn to shine on her own, at home with mommy.These scenes are so ridiculous, contrived, and pretentious that they literally back-slap the audience with a clear message from the writers: ""Ha, ha, we fooled you!""There is a scene earlier in the series in which Yashuka and Taiga's best friend, Minorin, are running against each other in a footrace to determine who will win the right to place a tiara on the head of the queen of the school's cultural festival.  That queen is Taiga, who for various reasons (one of them being that her father didn't show to see her stage performance) desperately needs the support.  There are manu challenges in the race for Ryuji, including abusive opponents who knock him down to take his lead away.  Minorin enters the race at this point, to stomp on the bad guys and allow Takusah to win.  Only he doesn't surge ahead to win.  He turns back to where Minorin is holding down the bad guys and takes her hand.  Hand-in-hand, they finished the race together and both place the tiara on Taiga's head.It's a very moving scene, a moment of great happiness for Taiga following the heartbreak she experienced when her father didn't show.There were similarly moving scenes in the series.  And then....And then, the last scene with the suitcase is flung like raw sewage all over the story.There is a ham-handed attempt at closure after the credits in the last episode.  Ryuji is shown returning to an empty classroom.  He looks around, mumbles something about ""the one who knows where to find it"", or some such other blathering nonsense, and opens a standalone locker in the back of the room.  He first met Taiga when this locker fell open to reveal her, and now, sure enough, she's standing there.She says, ""I wanted to surprise you.""  Well.  She's home again. How long was she gone?  Is she going to stay?  Does she still love hime?  Will they still marry?Never mind all that. He asks her, ""Have you grown?""She says, ""Not a millimeter"".""I love you"", he says.  (He never did manage to say this, even during their romantic scene at his grandmother's house).So what does she do?  How do the writers make the sewage smell like roses?They don't, that's how.  She gets angry, butts him in the jaw with the top of her head, and screams ""How dare you say something embarrassing like that in broad daylight????""End of story.Yeah, that fixed it all right.  A couple who promise to marry and share an intimate moment together in an earlier episode, now can't get through a mutual expression of love without getting into an adolescent scuffle.Still smells like sewage to me.Nice going, Anime writers.  Chalk up another idiotic ending to an otherwise great series.Stupid.",1,Wrong,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,4934,"['very', 'big', 'problem', 'Toradora', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'caveat', 'major', 'spoiler.So', 'here', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'why', 'series', 'trash', 'do', ""n't"", 'continue', 'reading', 'Watch', 'series', 'instead', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.Spoiler', 'ahead', '.All', 'right', 'then', 'here', 'very', 'big', 'problem', 'Toradora', 'ending', 'too', 'many', 'Anime', 'series', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'incapable', 'finishing', 'story', 'tossing', 'incredibly', 'inane', 'reversal', 'viewers.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'OK', 'sort', 'thing', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'am', 'especially', 'not', 'OK', 'case', 'Toradora', 'reversal', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'such', 'reversals', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'also', 'completely', 'preposterous', 'never', 'mind', 'everything', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'doing', 'feeling', 'up', 'point', ""'ll"", 'do', 'just', 'opposite', 'Opposite', 'Day', 'general', 'nutshell', 'reversal', 'everything', 'established', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'executed', 'such', 'arbitrary', 'abandon', 'logic', 'continuity', 'completely', 'entire', 'mood', 'series.Still', 'want', 'details', 'OK', 'very', 'touching', 'romantic', 'scene', 'Ryuji', 'Taiga', 'granparents', 'house', 'Ryuji', 'succeeded', 'reuniting', 'mother', 'grandparents', 'Ryuji', 'Taiga', 'have', 'repeated', 'promise', 'Dragon', 'Tiger', 'shall', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'side', 'Taiga', 'Gone', 'picture.She', 'abruptly', 'Ryuji', 'mother', 'return', 'homes', 'will', 'return', 'supper', 'own', 'mother', 'apartment', 'Only', 'apartment', 'mother', 'left', 'are', 'number', 'frantic', 'angry', 'other', 'emotions', 'messages', 'left', 'cell', 'parts', 'few', 'then', 'out', 'balcony.There', 'one', 'star', 'sky', 'now', 'star', 'must', 'learn', 'shine', 'own', 'so', 'can', 'love', 'Then', 'shown', 'walking', 'away', 'suitcase.Later', 'learn', 'returned', 'live', 'mother', 'Guess', 'time', 'Taiga', 'learn', 'shine', 'own', 'home', 'mommy.These', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'contrived', 'pretentious', 'literally', 'back-slap', 'audience', 'clear', 'message', 'writers', 'Ha', 'ha', 'fooled', 'scene', 'earlier', 'series', 'Yashuka', 'Taiga', 'best', 'friend', 'Minorin', 'are', 'running', 'other', 'footrace', 'determine', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'right', 'place', 'tiara', 'head', 'queen', 'school', 'cultural', 'festival', 'queen', 'Taiga', 'who', 'various', 'reasons', 'one', 'being', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'see', 'stage', 'performance', 'desperately', 'support', 'are', 'manu', 'challenges', 'race', 'Ryuji', 'including', 'abusive', 'opponents', 'who', 'knock', 'down', 'take', 'lead', 'away', 'Minorin', 'race', 'point', 'stomp', 'bad', 'guys', 'allow', 'Takusah', 'win', 'Only', ""n't"", 'surge', 'ahead', 'win', 'back', 'where', 'Minorin', 'holding', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'hand', 'Hand-in-hand', 'finished', 'race', 'together', 'place', 'tiara', 'Taiga', 'head.It', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'moment', 'great', 'happiness', 'Taiga', 'following', 'heartbreak', 'experienced', 'when', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'show.There', 'were', 'similarly', 'moving', 'scenes', 'series', 'then', 'then', 'last', 'scene', 'suitcase', 'flung', 'raw', 'sewage', 'story.There', 'ham-handed', 'attempt', 'closure', 'credits', 'last', 'episode', 'Ryuji', 'shown', 'returning', 'empty', 'classroom', 'around', 'mumbles', 'something', 'one', 'who', 'where', 'find', 'such', 'other', 'blathering', 'nonsense', 'standalone', 'locker', 'back', 'room', 'first', 'met', 'Taiga', 'when', 'locker', 'fell', 'open', 'reveal', 'now', 'sure', 'enough', 'standing', 'there.She', 'wanted', 'surprise', 'Well', 'home', 'again', 'How', 'long', 'was', 'gone', 'going', 'stay', 'Does', 'still', 'love', 'hime', 'still', 'marry', 'Never', 'mind', 'Have', 'grown', 'Not', 'millimeter', 'love', 'never', 'did', 'manage', 'say', 'even', 'romantic', 'scene', 'grandmother', 'house', 'what', 'do', 'How', 'do', 'writers', 'make', 'sewage', 'smell', 'roses', 'do', ""n't"", 'how', 'angry', 'butts', 'jaw', 'top', 'head', 'How', 'dare', 'say', 'something', 'embarrassing', 'broad', 'daylight', 'End', 'story.Yeah', 'fixed', 'right', 'A', 'couple', 'who', 'promise', 'marry', 'share', 'intimate', 'moment', 'together', 'earlier', 'episode', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mutual', 'expression', 'love', 'getting', 'adolescent', 'scuffle.Still', 'sewage', 'me.Nice', 'going', 'Anime', 'writers', 'Chalk', 'idiotic', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'great', 'series.Stupid']","Toradora!, Volume 1 (Standard Edition)"
