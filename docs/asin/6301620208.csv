258344,ADGKZ4RFVAJ8H,6301620208,A Customer,"[7, 8]","This apocalyptic view of nuclear war was a made for TV movie aired on ABC.  Starring Jason Robards as a physician, Steve Guttenburg as a medical  student and John Lithgow as a college professor, the movie is set in or  around the University of Kansas at Lawrence and Kansas City.  The pacing  builds up as tension between East and West heightens through news bulletins  and growing public anxiety over the threat of war disrupts daily lives,  including wedding preparations. That is the main point, how even the build  up can be disastrous and the event itself is absolutely catastrophic.  The  effects are realistic and the make-up showing radiation poisoning is  graphic.  However, the movie underestimates the pure power of the weapons  which would be used and more people live through the initial attacks than  would be the case if 20-35 megaton warheads were used.  Nonetheless, this  movie is an excellent portrayal of the social disorganization and medical  misery resulting from nuclear war.

258347,A19HQVND02SRWE,6301620208,Alan,"[1, 8]","I was 10 years old when this film aired back in 1983, and I was afraid to watch it.  I think it aired at 9pm Eastern, which was my bedtime at that age anyway, but even if I could stay up to watch it, I wouldn't.  As a 10 year old, nuclear war was something that really scared me.I'm 32 now, and I was surprised to see this released on DVD.  By now, my fear of the film had long since turned to fascination, and I decided to pick it up.  I'd wondered how the characters in the film could've survived, and how the film could've ended.  I was expecting the film to be a bit more subdued than today's television, and to be a bit dated as well (most things from the 80's are).  As it turns out, I was wrong on both counts.If you're reading this, you probably already know the plot: in a nutshell, the USSR and USA get into a nuclear war, and the ""lucky"" survivors have to live (or try to live) in the aftermath.  While the film is not exactly a gore-fest, it is a little graphic, and is definitely unsettling.  One of the things I was wondering as I was watching the film was how they were going to manage all of the characters they were introducing before the missiles came.  They answer: they DON'T manage all those characters afterwards.  Read into that what you will.This is definitely a ""What would I do in this situation?"" kind of film.  The effects are decent by 1980's standards (but dated by today's), and the film is well-acted, especially by Steve Guttenberg, who really surprised me.  It starts off a bit slow, but I'm assuming that's done to develop character and get you to care about these people before all hell breaks loose.I'm really glad I didn't watch this when I was 10.A few side notes: for the life of me, I couldn't place where I'd seen the bike-riding blond fiancee guy before, but then it hit me: it's the same actor who played the young Clark Kent in ""Superman: The Movie"" (Jeff East).  Also, I've read that Ben Stein was critical of this film when it came out.  For those of you who don't know, Ben Stein is an actor, famous for his role as the droll teacher in ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"" (""Bueler...Bueler...Bueler..."").  He also did some commercials for ""Clear Eyes"" eye drops, hosted his own show called ""Win Ben Stein's Money"", and was a speechwriter for Richard Nixon.  Stein was also critical of Mark Felt when it was revealed that Felt was ""Deep Throat"".  Stein defended Nixon, say that, even though Nixon was a liar, at least he wasn't a liar and drug addict like John F. Kennedy, or a liar and war-starter like Lyndon Johnson, etc.  He also criticized Felt in American Spectator, saying that he looked like a Nazi war criminal.  Stein feels that Nixon's authorization of the Watergate break-in and subsequent involvement in the cover-up should not have been exposed.  This should tell you a little bit about Ben Stein.Anyway, even though Ben doesn't recommend this film, I do.  In fact, I recommend watching this film WITH Ben Stein, if you can somehow pull it off.One last thing: the last chapter on the DVD is entitled ""Hope"".  Personally, it's the last word I would've used.  Where the hope was in that last scene, I couldn't tell you.",4,Disturbing,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,3169,"['was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'aired', 'back', '1983', 'was', 'afraid', 'watch', 'think', 'aired', '9pm', 'Eastern', 'was', 'bedtime', 'age', 'anyway', 'even', 'could', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", '10', 'year', 'old', 'nuclear', 'war', 'was', 'something', 'really', 'scared', 'me.I', ""'m"", '32', 'now', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'now', 'fear', 'film', 'had', 'long', 'turned', 'fascination', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', ""'d"", 'wondered', 'how', 'characters', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'survived', 'how', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'subdued', 'today', 'television', 'be', 'bit', 'dated', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'things', '80', 'are', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'counts.If', ""'re"", 'reading', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'USSR', 'USA', 'get', 'nuclear', 'war', 'lucky', 'survivors', 'have', 'live', 'try', 'live', 'aftermath', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'gore-fest', 'little', 'graphic', 'definitely', 'unsettling', 'One', 'things', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'manage', 'characters', 'were', 'introducing', 'missiles', 'came', 'answer', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'manage', 'characters', 'afterwards', 'Read', 'what', 'will.This', 'definitely', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'kind', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', '1980', 'standards', 'dated', 'today', 'film', 'well-acted', 'especially', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'who', 'really', 'surprised', 'bit', 'slow', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'done', 'develop', 'character', 'get', 'care', 'people', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'when', 'was', '10.A', 'few', 'side', 'notes', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'place', 'where', ""'d"", 'seen', 'bike-riding', 'blond', 'fiancee', 'guy', 'then', 'hit', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Jeff', 'East', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'was', 'critical', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'actor', 'famous', 'role', 'droll', 'teacher', 'Ferris', 'Bueler', 'Day', 'Off', 'Bueler', 'Bueler', 'Bueler', 'also', 'did', 'commercials', 'Clear', 'Eyes', 'eye', 'drops', 'hosted', 'own', 'show', 'called', 'Win', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'Money', 'was', 'speechwriter', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Stein', 'was', 'also', 'critical', 'Mark', 'Felt', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'Felt', 'was', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Stein', 'defended', 'Nixon', 'say', 'even', 'Nixon', 'was', 'liar', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'liar', 'drug', 'addict', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'liar', 'war-starter', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'etc', 'also', 'criticized', 'Felt', 'American', 'Spectator', 'saying', 'looked', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'Stein', 'Nixon', 'authorization', 'Watergate', 'break-in', 'subsequent', 'involvement', 'cover-up', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'should', 'tell', 'little', 'bit', 'Ben', 'Stein.Anyway', 'even', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'fact', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'WITH', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'can', 'somehow', 'pull', 'last', 'thing', 'last', 'chapter', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'Hope', 'Personally', 'last', 'word', 'would', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Where', 'hope', 'was', 'last', 'scene', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell']",N/A

As scores of others have written, this was, and probably still is the most controversial made for TV movie of all-time. Right up there with ""The Burning Bed"" for those of you who remember that.Seeing this as a teenager I was definitely creeped-out. The attention to detail and authenticity make this film a stand-out. The acting ranges from acceptable to extraordinary and the special effects-though not exactly cutting-edge, more than get the point across.There is no point in going over the storyline itself. This film could have contained any one of a hundred pentagon war scenarios and been essentially the same. This film is more about people than politics. A short nuclear exchange reduces Kansas City (and the nation) to ashes. The stories of a good 1/2 dozen characters are set up and followed through this harrowing experience. We see this through the eyes of a then-unknown Steve Guttenberg along with John Lithgow, and Jason Robards. I thought Guttenberg did a good job-usually I can't stand him.This film is like a 'slice-of-life' which none of us wants to experience. The atmosphere is depressing and hopeless for the most part.

258349,A55MRYPUAX4QU,6301620208,Avid Reader,"[2, 12]","""The Day After"" was one of a series of films made in the 1980's. Of these, only ""Testament"" could be called a success. The films were part of a massive campaign by the USSR and Western leftists to keep ground-based nukes from Western Europe.  The CSPI (Center for Science in the Public Interest), a ""disinterested"" group that hilariously declared itself non-partisan, led the charge with graphic descriptions of nuclear winter or worse. After deployment and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, the subject was never broached. The hype was huge - psychiatrists and child psychologists were ready to help grieving students who happened to watch the show, the papers played it big, the media gave it all the free publicity you could want...and it was still an artistic blunder.Besidess blocking the weapons (not necessarily a bad thing), the movie had two purposes:  (1) Visualzie the horrible affects of a nuclear war and just as important (2) make the Soviet Empire and the West morally equivalent - no good or bad guys - just ""big guys"" and ""little guys""  I'd expected a powerful, thought-provoking show but instead got a disaster on all fronts (artistic, political and military).  The dialogue was possibly the most stilted and amateurish ever presented on screen.  It sounded like a high school play at times - awkward & hesitant.  Husbands and wives spoke like strangers, family talk was from Ozzie & Harriet, a 6th grader asks, ""Daddy, whut's radiation?""  Folks on the brink of starvation resist the only method for replanting crops. No one has heard of an EMP and (you have to smile) when it hits, EVERYONE stays in their car trying to start the engines, oblivious to the zillion others around them with the same problem. Politically it's a phony Kumbaya Moment. In crimson Kansas folks greet the Soviet closure of West Berlin with a shrug - no expressions of outrage.  At the end, the President (read Reagan) gives a ridiculously upbeat speech - we have not surrendedred and he invokes God and patriotism.  All the while, victims moan and the camera shows devastation.  Apparently the purpose of the awful dialogue was to make folks sound like ""simple folk"" who loved mom, pop, God & corn.  Although set in the 80's, the viewer for some reason kept getting glimpses of what looked like film from the 1950's.It is the acting that really ""bombed"". Poor Jason Robards comes in for the most criticism.  Unlike everyone else, his clothes stay clean and fresh.  He appears drunk or doped during the entire film, stumbling and slurring his way through the most unlikely of circumstances. It's as if the writers tried to substitue incoherence and mangled steps for serious lines.  Amy Madigan is present as a pregnant woman and whines as usual. Steve Gutenburg is a student with embarrasingly poor lines.  John Lithgow plays an exasperated know-it-all. The extras hired to portray victims never spoke a word - did the bomb suddenly remove the gift of speech?  Emotions were surface - you feel as if the actor could just as easily cry as laugh.  The chemistry between the romantic couples was about as heated as a male model and a beauty queen.This is too bad because the few good scenes were very affective - the harried soldiers, the moment the bomb hit, the panorama of utter destruction and that final tragedy when student met the daughter and both had lost their hair.  For obvious reasons, the start of the war was obscure - after all, who cares about blame in such a catastrophe?  Who attacked first, who initiated the first nuclear strike, why did the USSR block Berlin in the first place?  I kept waiting to see the rest of the world but that would have entailed creativity and another story.  In this case the writers were inadvertently correct to focus on this locality.  The outside world is a mysterious unknown, like Medieval times when one only knew the village in which they were born and died.  The film was promptly criticized by Sagan (CSPI) as too ""optimistic"".  You can't please all the folks all the time, I guess.

258350,ALR819EYYWX06,6301620208,azog,"[6, 10]","I saw this when it first aired in 1983. 22 years later, I saw it in BestBuy for $10 and had to have it. I honestly don't recall my reactions from the first time, but I do remember that this was quite controversial in its day.Perhaps today, over a decade since the end of the Cold War, it would be considered bland. But for those of us who grew up in the Cold War and knew the terrible possibilities which were only moments away, this was our reality. Don't forget that this particular time period spawned such Cold War classics like ""Red Dawn"". And who could forget ""Wargames""?The movie is from the vantage of ""normal"" people. Only in the background do we get an idea of the rising global tensions. The news comes from radios in the cars, or from televisions which the characters are watching, as they make their way thru their everyday lives.The first half of the movie builds the major characters, and tries to show you the ""innocence"" of the time. These are the people who will ultimately suffer if They press The Button.We get a glimpse of what would have to be the most horrible thing you'd ever imagine - Minuteman missiles are being launched, from silos which are literally in their backyards.Once the war is over, the rest of the movie focuses on ""what next"". You see the families huddled in their cellars, waiting for a safe time to emerge, but they don't know when that will be. Farmers are trying to figure out how to reclaim their land. Lawlessness ensues as looters and rioters are shot on sight. And as one of the final blows, we see the slow death of radiation disease...There is never any indication as to who was at fault - who started the war? One scene shows a character getting mad over the lack of this information. But the point is moot, and what's done is done.Unfortunately, the movie moves slow, simply because of the way the story is told.

Growing up my parents were careful in what they allowed in the home from the outside world such as violence, promiscuity...you know, the typical. But when it came to 'real issues', they were a little more open. They taught us to never feel ""too comfortable"" with life because you never know what can happen. A good example, 9/11. They taught us to be prepared mentally and physically in case a catastrophe hits. But at the same time, they also taught us a balance that we need to live by as well.

258359,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6301620208,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","There have been some controversial made-for-TV movies over the years, but I don't think any of them compare to The Day After.  This is the most-talked-about TV movie I've seen in my thirty-four years.  I didn't watch it when it was initially aired on ABC in 1983, which is odd because I started nursing a fear of nuclear war around that same time during my childhood.  It's something every Cold War child went through at some point, although I know my own experience paled considerably compared to those coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s.  I was also forming my political opinions at that age, as well, and perhaps I didn't watch the movie because of the political agenda behind it.  Liberals feared Ronald Reagan at this time, fearing he would actually start a nuclear war, and that kind of political sentiment, in my opinion, lay behind this film.  Of course, despite such fears by some, President Reagan went on to end the Cold War altogether.The Day After was - and still is - a terrifying motion picture that purports to show what happens when the politicians stop making speeches and let the bombs fly.  The thing about nuclear war is that it just keeps on giving - or, I should say - taking.  Those who die in the initial explosion are the lucky ones, as the survivors must face a decimated, increasingly atavistic society struggling to find sustenance and medical attention (useless though it is) even as they slowly die from radiation poisoning.  Make no mistake - this movie was intended to frighten the American people.  Frighten them it did.  Anti-nuclear activism was given a tremendous boost in terms of popular appeal - until the fervor was dragged down alongside Walter Mondale's silly pledge to raise taxes in the 1984 election.After an hour or so of introducing us to several characters in the heartland of America - Kansas City and its outlying areas - the impetus of military clashes in Germany all too suddenly turns the Cold War red hot, and a full nuclear exchange takes place between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Panic ensues as the local population watches the nearby silos unleash one ICBM after another, knowing Soviet nukes are only minutes away from their otherwise peaceful skies.  You get a good couple of minutes of nuclear destruction as Soviet nukes explode all over the atmosphere of the area.  The mushroom clouds hit the viewer with great force.  Numerous Americans are quickly vaporized (you see a quick X-ray image of them before they disappear), and wholesale destruction is wrought on basically everything.  The final hour of the movie focuses on the survivors and the dire situation they find themselves in.  The entire cast is high caliber, but Jason Robards truly shines as the university doctor who stumbles back to campus and organizes his medical crew to do what they can against insurmountable odds.  We also follow the fate of a farm family holed up in their cellar for days before emerging back into the light after radiation levels fall down to a survivable rate.  It's an awful situation that only gets worse, as no one is safe from the deadly fallout - or their suddenly desperate fellow man.Watching this film again now, I could not help but think how overly optimistic the film is, in a sense.  As a note as the end of the movie informs the viewer, the effects of a nuclear attack would be far, far worse than you see here.  One kid is blinded by a nuclear explosion, but in reality many people would basically have their eyes melted out of their heads.  Radiation poisoning in the movie basically consists of a growing lethargy, rotting body parts, and hair loss - there's no sign of the deathly nausea and other symptoms that would ensue.  The mushroom clouds themselves look altogether too small for such nuclear detonations, as well.This wasn't the first movie to depict a post-nuclear America, but The Day After was the first film to try to realistically depict the unspeakable devastation of nuclear war.  The folks in this film were just normal civilians living normal lives in the heartland of America.  As such, the movie directly challenged everyone who thought ""it can't happen here.""  No one is safe from the devastation of 100s of ICBMs exploding all over the country.  The Day After remains a powerful and important film today.  The threat of Soviet attack has been minimized (for now), but the threat of a nuclear attack is still very real, thanks to the madmen in Iran and North Korea and traitors to humanity such as Pakistan's Abdul Khan.  One well-placed nuclear detonation over the American continent could wipe out all power nationwide with its EMP pulse (and I was surprised and happy to see the EMP pulse effect mentioned in the movie) and instantly turn the U.S. into a third-world nation.  The worst thing we can do is to pretend the dangers of nuclear attack don't exist, and The Day After makes it all but impossible not to face up to that threat.  It is still very much required viewing, in my opinion.",5,The most controversial TV movie ever made finally on DVD,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,5000,"['have', 'been', 'controversial', 'made-for-TV',

258360,A1LPOWMIH8J4E6,6301620208,Daniel Waitkoss,"[1, 2]","""The Day After"" is one of the most hyped films ever made for TV and it almost (and I stress almost) lived up to its advertising.  The problem with the film is not so much the acting, although the yells of ""Jolene"" come in far too many times and in far too shrill a voice, but with the story-line.  Far too few of the many characters are built into full human beings--particularly the young farm family.  When the characters are given more time, alas, the film tends to move towards soap opera with the farmer's daughter (no pun intended) having such lines as ""I wish he would have left me a baby,"" etc.  At the same time, several of the characters are rather unsympathetic--I really didn't like the eldest daughter or the father.  This takes away from the film's power.  With characters that you have seen far too many times and really do not care for,especially the rebellious daughter and dad, the viewer begins to not care that their world is about to be blown into atomic cinders.The film would have worked better with more emphasis on Jason Robarbs and the the people at the hospital in Lawrence, KS.  His character, a pediatrician (msp?), is fully alive and rounded--you see his daughter and his wife and know enough about them to realize what they are like and how much they mean to Robarbs.  The viewer can build some interest in them and their problems.  The characters in the hospital bask in Robarbs glow (no pun intended) and become more than just stick figures as they interact with him and the strain of life after the attack.The hyped special effects of the attack were not so special, even for the time it was shot with the use of x-ray pictures during the blasts to show people being vaporized and the use of stock footage, seen far too many times--it didn't work for me then nor does it today.The film does try to make its point, but with the exception of Robarbs, excellent as usual, the film falls flat.  A truly good film about nuclear attack was released about the same time and was shown on American Playhouse.  ""Testament"" had one small special effect but packed the full wallop that ""The Day After"" missed so woefully.

I have never been more frightened for this world in my entire life, and that is a fact. &quot;The Day After&quot; deals with a nuclear war, and the main characters are everyday folk, like us, in Middle America. The movie was filmed in the early 1980's, when the Cold War was at it's peak, and every film studio came out with cheap action films about post-nuclear war heros and giant radioactive insects.But this telefilm, guided by the talented Nicholas Meyer(Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan), rose to new heights and presented us with a vision of a world that has lost all sense of reason and hope, with 2 powerful nations taking their ignorance out on the billions who are innocent, but still pay for the actions brought on by the ignorant. Jason Robards plays a doctor and Steve Guttenburg(his best performance by far) as a man traveling home are just two of the many everyday people bound together by horrible circumstances.Two of the most powerful scenes that brought tears to my eyes is where  a battered priest is reading from his Bible from a bombed out church, with devastation all around him, and the people in attendance are scarred, bloody, and dying. And as the priest trys to raise hopes about God's plan, and about keeping faith, a little girl dies in her sleep, apparently from radiation sickness.And the family, without saying anything, gets up from their pew, and walks away, while the priest, in desperation, increases his voice, having a hard time himself believing in a God that would let this happen.Another heart-wrenching scene is when a group of people are in a building hiding from the radiation, when they pick up a message from the President of the United States, telling Americans that a cease fire had been called, and that the US did not surrender, won't surrender, and he felt sympathy for the losses inflicted, but the great nation of America still lives, and he too had suffered personal losses. And as he said this the camera pans around the room, and instead of patriotic fervor from the survivors, you get the more realistic blank faces, from people who had just seen the world as they knew it destroyed, family, friends dead. This scene shows how futile and pointless war of any kind is.What was the most powerful is that even though we can inflict so much pain on each other, as presented very clearly and graphically in this film, is that there are those who will die to save others in the aftermath, such as in the hospital where the doctors died themselves, worked to death comforting the dying. I think that this film will touch everyone's soul, and hopefully someone in power will take heed of this movie. The threat of nuclear holocaust is still with us, and it would not take much for this film to become reality. Please buy this, rent this, or catch it the next time it is on television. We should not all have to suffer just because a few egomaniacs can't shake hands. This is just one of the many lessons this film teaches, and hopefully it will be a lesson learned, for all of our sakes.",5,What makes it even more scary is that it could STILL happen,982713600,"02 21, 2001",2001,3163,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'television', 'even', 'commercials', 'stay', 'tuned', '3', 'hours', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'frightened', 'world', 'entire', 'life', 'fact', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'deals', 'nuclear', 'war', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'everyday', 'folk', 'Middle', 'America', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'early', '1980', 'when', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'peak', 'film', 'studio', 'came', 'out', 'cheap', 'action', 'films', 'post-nuclear', 'war', 'heros', 'giant', 'radioactive', 'insects.But', 'telefilm', 'guided', 'talented', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'rose', 'new', 'heights', 'presented', 'vision', 'world', 'lost', 'sense', 'reason', 'hope', '2', 'powerful', 'nations', 'taking', 'ignorance', 'billions', 'who', 'are', 'innocent', 'still', 'pay', 'actions', 'brought', 'ignorant', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'doctor', 'Steve', 'Guttenburg', 'best', 'performance', 'far', 'man', 'traveling', 'home', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'many', 'everyday', 'people', 'together', 'horrible', 'circumstances.Two', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'where', 'battered', 'priest', 'reading', 'Bible', 'bombed', 'church', 'devastation', 'people', 'attendance', 'are', 'scarred', 'bloody', 'dying', 'priest', 'trys', 'raise', 'hopes', 'God', 'plan', 'keeping', 'faith', 'little', 'girl', 'dies', 'sleep', 'apparently', 'radiation', 'sickness.And', 'family', 'saying', 'anything', 'up', 'pew', 'walks', 'away', 'priest', 'desperation', 'voice', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'God', 'would', 'let', 'happen.Another', 'heart-wrenching', 'scene', 'when', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'building', 'hiding', 'radiation', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'message', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'telling', 'Americans', 'cease', 'fire', 'had', 'been', 'called', 'US', 'did', 'not', 'surrender', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surrender', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'losses', 'inflicted', 'great', 'nation', 'America', 'still', 'too', 'had', 'suffered', 'personal', 'losses', 'said', 'camera', 'room', 'instead', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'survivors', 'get', 'more', 'realistic', 'blank', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'world', 'knew', 'destroyed', 'family', 'dead', 'scene', 'how', 'futile', 'pointless', 'war', 'kind', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'even', 'can', 'inflict', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'other', 'presented', 'very', 'clearly', 'graphically', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'save', 'others', 'aftermath', 'such', 'hospital', 'where', 'doctors', 'died', 'worked', 'death', 'comforting', 'dying', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'everyone', 'soul', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'power', 'will', 'take', 'heed', 'movie', 'threat', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'film', 'become', 'reality', 'Please', 'buy', 'rent', 'catch', 'next', 'time', 'television', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'suffer', 'just', 'few', 'egomaniacs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'hands', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'lessons', 'film', 'teaches', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'lesson', 'learned', 'sakes']",N/A

The cast lives up to the requirements of the script and the director keeps the action moving forward without falling into a lachrymose stream. If you did not see the TV version, it is worth seeing it in this DVD version.There are documentaries which show surviving people and their artifacts (buildings, bridges, streets) after they have been impacted by all-out combat.

258368,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6301620208,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[4, 4]","This movie originally came out my sophomore year in high school.  I can still remember all the unrest and dialogue it caused;  it was all everyone wanted to talk about the next day at school.  So many people were so upset that I recall some teachers taking time out of class to discuss the topic of nuclear war.  To say the least, this movie ""hit a nerve.""For myself, I had read articles in SCIENCE magazine and had done extensive research on the subject matter.  The movie was disturbing, but nothing really surprised me in it.  The next day @ school I looked around and thought to myself:  ""Am I the only one who has ever thought about the consequences of using nuclear weapons?  Are people that naive?""While I'm sure many other people had read up on it, I'm equally as sure that that vast majority did not.  That much was readily apparent.  Such was the utility of this movie; to make people think about the un-thinkable.  And, insofar as that is concerned, it did a terrific job.Looking back, the FX of the bombs going off are not particularly impressive.  Of course, that was not the ""point"" of this made-for-TV movie.  It wasn't made as an ""excuse"" to show off great special-effects.  Rather, it was designed to show what the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation would be like.The best part of the movie is in how subtle some of its points are.  The ultimate point is this:  nuclear war is the great equalizer.  After such a war, it matters not how educated you are, how rich you are, how poor you are, whether you're gregarious or dislike other people, whether you hold an important social position, etc.  None of that matters.  Anarchy replaces order and chaos replaces our social mores.  The Darwininan instinct to survive trumps all else, even if it means hanging on to a life of grotesque radiation sickness.The film is nostalgic in that it has a young John Lithgow and an even younger Steve Guttenberg.  It had been so long since I saw it on TV that  I did not recall Guttenberg being in the movie.  Of course, he was yet to become a big name @ the time this was made.These days, THE DAY AFTER does not carry quite the same poignancy as it did in the 1980s.  The chances of an all-out nuclear war are fairly slim at this point in time.  The much greater concern now is a nuclear weapon(s) being detonated by a terrorist organization.  Still, IF that were to happen (and I hope it doesn't in my lifetime - or ever!!), much of what you see in this movie will be true-to-form.  Hence, 20+ years after its inception, this movie still bears a chilling warning about what scientists like to call ""tickling the dragon.""",5,Careful of pushing the buttons.....,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2624,"['movie', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'sophomore', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'unrest', 'dialogue', 'caused', 'was', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'talk', 'next', 'day', 'school', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'so', 'upset', 'recall', 'teachers', 'taking', 'time', 'class', 'discuss', 'topic', 'nuclear', 'war', 'say', 'least', 'movie', 'hit', 'nerve', 'had', 'read', 'articles', 'SCIENCE', 'magazine', 'had', 'done', 'extensive', 'research', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'was', 'disturbing', 'nothing', 'really', 'surprised', 'next', 'day', '@', 'school', 'looked', 'thought', 'myself', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'ever', 'thought', 'consequences', 'using', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'Are', 'people', 'naive', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'read', 'up', ""'m"", 'equally', 'sure', 'vast', 'majority', 'did', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'readily', 'apparent', 'Such', 'was', 'utility', 'movie', 'make', 'people', 'think', 'un-thinkable', 'insofar', 'concerned', 'did', 'terrific', 'job.Looking', 'back', 'FX', 'bombs', 'going', 'off', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'point', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'great', 'special-effects', 'Rather', 'was', 'designed', 'show', 'what', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'confrontation', 'would', 'be', 'like.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'how', 'subtle', 'points', 'are', 'ultimate', 'point', 'nuclear', 'war', 'great', 'equalizer', 'such', 'war', 'not', 'how', 'educated', 'are', 'how', 'rich', 'are', 'how', 'poor', 'are', ""'re"", 'gregarious', 'dislike', 'other', 'people', 'hold', 'important', 'social', 'position', 'etc', 'None', 'matters', 'Anarchy', 'order', 'chaos', 'replaces', 'social', 'mores', 'Darwininan', 'instinct', 'survive', 'trumps', 'else', 'even', 'hanging', 'life', 'grotesque', 'radiation', 'sickness.The', 'film', 'nostalgic', 'young', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'even', 'younger', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'saw', 'TV', 'did', 'not', 'recall', 'Guttenberg', 'being', 'movie', 'course', 'was', 'yet', 'become', 'big', 'name', 'time', 'was', 'made.These', 'days', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'not', 'carry', 'quite', 'same', 'poignancy', 'did', '1980s', 'chances', 'all-out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'are', 'fairly', 'slim', 'point', 'time', 'much', 'greater', 'concern', 'now', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 's', 'being', 'detonated', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Still', 'IF', 'were', 'happen', 'hope', ""n't"", 'lifetime', 'ever', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'true-to-form', 'Hence', '20+', 'years', 'inception', 'movie', 'still', 'chilling', 'warning', 'what', 'scientists', 'call', 'tickling', 'dragon']",N/A

With the movie that is, not the wimpy DVD, which has absolutely, no special features at all.  This movie was watched by close to half of the adult population of America!  That's phenomenal and you would think MGM could at least dig up some old commercials or news reports or something.  What about the Carl Sagen special that aired directly after the movie in which he compared nuclear war to ""two men standing waist deep in gasoline; one with three matches, the other with five.""  I would love to see that.Shot in a very low-key fashion the movie opens with different people and families living their everyday lives in Kansas.  We get some doctors, a few farmers, a few college students and a soldier.  In the background of all these stories we hear news reports on televisions and radios talking about trouble in Europe between Germany and Russia.  Things begin to escalate and next thing you know giant ICBM's are blasting out of the ground.  Everybody goes completely nuts.Then....BOOM!  The scenes of the missiles hitting had my eyes bugging out like a cartoon.  I couldn't believe it.  Horses blowing up.  Cows.  Kids.  Everybody's getting cooked.  The pitch-black clouds looked absolutely evil.The survivors (I personally believe that there will be very, very few survivors) do not have four arms and venom shooting tentacles like I had hoped, but they are pretty sick and only get sicker.  By the end everybody who's still alive looks like zombies.The aftermath part of the movie kinda drug a little, but I still found two scenes especially shocking.  One was were this man gets shot in the back and then the guy who shot him starts sharpening his knife!  The other is toward the very end when it shows the body of a burnt child impaled on a piece of rebar!  Yikes!

The fact that this was at the height of the Cold War era, and many people believed that Ronald Reagan was... well crazy enough and so were the Soviets made this broadcast so real.  Oddly enough though, the British managed to outdo it with THREADS, which made me about twice as physically ill when it aired on TV.The Broadcast was scary, and I remember after a panel of experts appearing on a special Nightline and a special call in to discuss issues.  - - Could it happen ?  Could anyone survive ?  Would the living envy the dead ?  - - and even more horrifyingly the fact that one of the more controversial elements of the broadcast was the arguement that the broadcast presented an OPTOMISTIC view of what it would be like to survive a nuclear holocaust.Though just a made for TV movie (in an era when made-for-TV movies were usually corny), I have found this broadcast to be the most disturbing movie I've ever scene because at the time it was such a real possibility.

The film is a ""horror"" story about nuclear war, which concentrates on areas around Kansas City. Jason Robards plays a doctor. He is one of the survivors who makes his way back to the hospital, which is being swamped with the injured and the sick.The scenes of the holocaust are quite spectacular (for their time) and this is the highlight of the film. After that the film seems to drag. Survivors wandering around hopelessly, getting sick and dying. I know this is what would happen in reality but I don't think the film needed to go on for as long as it did. It managed to be a disturbing story until I saw the British film ""Threads"", which was far more realistic and far less sentimental.When you analyze ""The Day After"" you start to wonder how realistic it really is. If nuclear war really happened, it's highly unlikely that a hospital would be able to help anyone. (That was put across quite graphically in ""Threads"".) Is a car really a safe place to hide from a nuclear explosion? If my memory serves me correctly, Jason Robards wasn't even scratched!

258377,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,6301620208,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[3, 3]","This made-for-TV movie originally aired the same year I graduated from high school and went off to college.  It was definitely a product of its time.  I don't think a movie like this could be made, much less broadcast on network TV, during any other period of American history.  It perfectly captured the mood of the day, and the fears that we all had back then.  The US-Soviet d&eacute;tente of the 1970s was well and truly over; and the Cold War was hotter than it had been at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The hawkish anticommunist crusader, Ronald Reagan, had been in the White House for over two years; and it would be another two years before the pragmatic reformer and peacemaker, Mikhail Gorbachev, would rise to the top position in the Kremlin.  Arms control negotiations between the two superpowers had broken down; and the nuclear arms race was rapidly escalating.  Reagan administration officials were openly discussing the notion of ""winnable nuclear war"" and the potential benefits of developing a ""first strike"" capability.  Meanwhile, Soviet troops were bogged down in Afghanistan, fighting a costly war against Islamist insurgents (or ""freedom fighters"" as we called them back then) covertly armed and equipped by the US.  And this was just one of the many ""proxy wars"" being waged around the globe between US-backed and Soviet-backed factions.  The public rhetoric between the US and USSR was often quite hostile.  Although it's hard to imagine today, back then it really did seem like the two superpowers were rapidly heading towards an inevitable confrontation that could very well end in nuclear war and the complete destruction of modern civilization.  I can recall, as a high school student in the early Reagan years, having casual conversations with my friends about where we'd rather be in the event of a nuclear war: at ground zero, where we'd be killed instantly and spared the tremendous suffering that survivors would have to face, or in a well-stocked fallout shelter far from ground zero, where we'd have a fighting chance of survival, but would face unimaginable horrors, unbearable hardships, and a very bleak future.  Okay, I'll admit that my friends and I were a little weird; but our concern about the possibility of nuclear war wasn't at all unusual back in the early-1980s.  Everyone back then was worried about nuclear war.  And this movie takes those worries and shows us what would happen if they came true.  The results are even more horrifying than you could imagine.Over the years, many movies have been made about nuclear war; but this movie is unlike any of those other films.  This movie isn't about the actions of politicians and generals.  It isn't about the unique experiences of submarine commanders or B-52 pilots.  It's not a spy thriller or a post-apocalyptic sci-fi film.  It's not a heroic tale of intrepid survivors beating the odds and rebuilding a new civilization from the rubble of the old.  Instead, it's a bleak, depressing, utterly heartbreaking portrait of what the experience of nuclear war would be like for ordinary citizens in America's heartland.  It is painfully realistic in its portrayal of the horrors of nuclear war.  It doesn't pull any punches.  But it doesn't make things seem worse than they really would be for dramatic effect, either.  What you see in this film is a pretty good approximation of the sort of things that actually would happen in a full-scale thermonuclear war.  In a way, this movie is much more frightening than any horror film; because this could really happen.  (Fortunately, the odds of it happening are much, much lower today than they were when this movie first aired; but there's still a chance it could happen.)  This is nightmare fuel.  If you're the sort of person who can't watch horror films because you find them too disturbing, then you probably shouldn't watch this.  Likewise, if you hate depressing movies that don't have happy endings, this really isn't the film for you.  Though, personally, I actually felt pretty good after watching this the other night.  It kinda lifted my spirits, in a perverse sort of way, by putting things into perspective.  After watching this, and seeing the absolute worst thing that realistically could happen, my life seems pretty good by comparison, and the problems I'm dealing with and challenges I'm facing seem almost trivial.  It was oddly therapeutic.  (Yeah, I know, I'm weird.)If you want to know what it would be like to live through a full-scale thermonuclear war, then this is definitely the movie to watch.  It's rather melodramatic in places; but that was fairly typical for TV shows and made-for-TV movies in the early '80s.  Like I said before, it was a product of its time.  So, I'm going to cut it some slack in terms of the melodrama, and say that it's a good film in spite of its frequent emotional clumsiness.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning more about the effects of nuclear war.",5,The ultimate horror movie,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,4993,"['made-for-TV', 'movie',

258383,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,6301620208,Jason N. Mical,"[6, 12]","Some films manage to catch the zeitgeist of a certain period in time so well, their very name becomes synonymous with the events and feelings of that time.  &#65533;The Day After&#65533; is one of those films.  Created at the height of Reagan-era nuclear posturing, the time in which the world was pushed as close to nuclear war as we were during the Cuban Missile Crisis (the Doomsday Clock was at one minute to midnight, for those that remember), &#65533;TDA&#65533; details the events leading up to and directly after a massive nuclear exchange between the US and the USSR.  The story sticks to one family of dirtfarmers in Missouri, an outcropping of students as the University of Kansas, an Air Force soldier who helped push the trigger, and a student who chose the wrong time to try and go home and see his parents.The reasons for the nuclear exchange are never explored, and it doesn&#65533;t matter: at the time this movie was made, everyone was aware of the reality of total annihilation every time the Teflon Cowboy in the White House shot off at the mouth.  The few days after the war show the debilitating, eroding effects of radiation, and although it was extremely visceral for a television movie, the actual effects would be much worse (see &#65533;Threads&#65533;).  Civil structure breaks down, creating a &#65533;might-makes-right&#65533; world where those with the guns create the rules &#65533; scary, considering who owns most of the guns in the USA right now.Some compare this movie to &#65533;Threads&#65533; and &#65533;Testament&#65533; and say those are better.  Don&#65533;t.  The comparison isn&#65533;t fair.  &#65533;Threads&#65533; explores the breakdown of social structure.  &#65533;Testament&#65533; explores the breakdown of community and family.  &#65533;TDA&#65533; explores the breakdown of the individual person.  They are three totally different films, each effective in their own way of showing the awful effects of nuclear war.  Although it seems that our leaders have finally wised up about the whole kill each other a dozen times over thing, I wouldn&#65533;t put it past some bozo to finally push the button one day, making &#65533;TDA&#65533; and other films of its kind just as important today as they were in the early 80s.  True, it&#65533;s not a great film &#65533; the acting is wooden in places and the special effects are pretty laughable, even for that time &#65533; but it is almost a snapshot of the horror many of us faced during the early 80s.This VHS, from the magical elves at Anchor Bay, is a fully-restored, video-length (longer than the original TV release) version of the movie.  According to the PR elves at Anchor Bay, a DVD release should happen in the next year or so &#65533; and here&#65533;s hoping.  Until then, this budget tape will more than tide you over.Final Grade: B+",4,"The Classic, Mainstream American Post-Nuke Film",1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,2846,"['films', 'manage', 'catch', 'zeitgeist', 'certain', 'period', 'time', 'so', 'well', 'very', 'name', 'synonymous', 'events', 'feelings', 'time', '65533', 'Day', '65533', 'one', 'films', 'Created', 'height', 'Reagan-era', 'nuclear', 'posturing', 'time', 'world', 'was', 'pushed', 'close', 'nuclear', 'war', 'were', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Doomsday', 'Clock', 'was', 'one', 'minute', 'midnight', 'remember', '65533', 'TDA', '65533', 'details', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'directly', 'massive', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'US', 'USSR', 'story', 'sticks', 'one', 'family', 'dirtfarmers', 'Missouri', 'outcropping', 'students', 'University', 'Kansas', 'Air', 'Force', 'soldier', 'who', 'helped', 'push', 'trigger', 'student', 'who', 'chose', 'wrong', 'time', 'try', 'go', 'home', 'see', 'parents.The', 'reasons', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'are', 'never', 'explored', '65533', 't', 'matter', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'everyone', 'was', 'aware', 'reality', 'total', 'annihilation', 'time', 'Teflon', 'Cowboy', 'White', 'House', 'shot', 'off', 'mouth', 'few', 'days', 'war', 'show', 'debilitating', 'eroding', 'effects', 'radiation', 'was', 'extremely', 'visceral', 'television', 'movie', 'actual', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'worse', 'see', '65533', 'Threads', '65533', 'Civil', 'structure', 'breaks', 'down', 'creating', '65533', 'might-makes-right', '65533', 'world', 'where', 'guns', 'create', 'rules', '65533', 'scary', 'considering', 'who', 'most', 'guns', 'USA', 'right', 'now.Some', 'compare', 'movie', '65533', 'Threads', '65533', '65533', 'Testament', '65533', 'say', 'are', 'better', 'Don', '65533', 't.', 'comparison', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'fair', '65533', 'Threads', '65533', 'breakdown', 'social', 'structure', '65533', 'Testament', '65533', 'breakdown', 'community', 'family', '65533', 'TDA', '65533', 'breakdown', 'individual', 'person', 'are', 'three', 'totally', 'different', 'films', 'effective', 'own', 'way', 'showing', 'awful', 'effects', 'nuclear', 'war', 'leaders', 'have', 'finally', 'wised', 'up', 'whole', 'kill', 'other', 'dozen', 'times', 'thing', 'wouldn', '65533', 't', 'put', 'bozo', 'finally', 'push', 'button', 'one', 'day', 'making', '65533', 'TDA', '65533', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'just', 'important', 'today', 'were', 'early', '80s', 'True', '65533', 'not', 'great', 'film', '65533', 'acting', 'wooden', 'places', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'laughable', 'even', 'time', '65533', 'almost', 'snapshot', 'horror', 'many', 'faced', 'early', '80s.This', 'VHS', 'magical', 'elves', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'fully-restored', 'video-length', 'longer', 'original', 'TV', 'release', 'version', 'movie', 'According', 'PR', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'release', 'should', 'happen', 'next', 'year', 'so', '65533', 'here', '65533', 's', 'hoping', 'then', 'budget', 'tape', 'will', 'more', 'over.Final', 'Grade', 'B+']",N/A

Well anyway this show caused quite a stir weeks before it even aired and was a  huge ratings bonanza for ABC network. I taped it and watched it a few  nights later, I was initially intrigued and in the second half bored. Well  I just watched this movie a week ago and seventeen years later I find the  same thing to be true. The film fails to satisfy anyone. For the sci-fi  doomsday fans there are no mutants, monsters, and other various items. For  the anti-nuke activist the film fails to convey the full &quot;horror&quot;  of an all out nuclear exchange and to the pro-defense conservative the  movie assumes a full out nuclear exchange with everyone launching their  entire stock of nukes.Which many felt was unrelistic by 1983. Plus for the  survivalist set there were no heroic survivors fighting hordes of bikers  and looters with their assault rifles and grenades. I found it intruiging  that there was no mention of the electromagnetic pulse phenomenon that is  caused by a nuclear burst. By 83 many think-tanks felt that a full exchange  might be stopped cold by just one nuke going off over the North Pole. In  other words everything electronic would shut off and very possible many a  nuclear equipped ICBM would simply come crashing down to the ground,  scattering nuclear garbage everywhere, but without the boom. Well whatever  the movie fails. I have to agree with the prior reviews. Too many  characters, weak writing, poor attention to technical details and very slow  moving. Considering that Nicholas Meyer directed it ( Star Trek II,and VI,  The Deceivers and The Seven Percent Solution-author) I would have expected  more.

Munson,"[4, 4]","Jason Robards stars in this movie about an all-out nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and the United States.The movie is set in and around Lawrence, Kansas.  There is an air force base nearby, as well as approximately 150 nuclear missile silos.  All in all, this part of the country has a huge target on it's back.  The Soviets have invaded West Germany, and tactical nuclear weapons have been used by each side.  But these tactical nukes are only the beginning, as each side eventually fires off their ICBMs.The lives of several families in Kansas are about to change forever.  Robards stars as Dr. Russell Oakes.  As soon as the missiles strike, he begins helping patients suffering from widely varying degrees of injuries.  Although injured himself, he, along with other doctors and nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams), continues to treat patients.John Cullum stars as Jim Dahlberg.  He and his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) own a farm very close to one of the missile silos.  Their daughter Denise (Lori Lethin) is planning her wedding day.  Suddenly, the peace is shattered as the missile silo near their home opens up and releases its deadly cargo.  Eve is upstairs making the bed as if nothing is happening.  Jim is forced to drag his wife, who's kicking and screaming, to the basement.  Meanwhile, Denise pauses to pick up her wedding dress, which she'll never be able to wear, on her way to the basement.  The Dahlbergs are joined later on by Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg), a University of Kansas student who was on his way home to see his parents when the missiles hit.John Lithgow stars as Joe Huxley, a professor who attempts to re-establish communications after the attack by placing a small receiver on the roof of a building.I was eighteen years old when this program was aired on network television. I can still remember being glued to the screen as the missiles were launched at the Soviets while the Soviet missiles destroyed Lawrence, Kansas.  The special effects, including the billowing mushroom clouds, are very good, and the other aspects of the attacks, such as the onset of nuclear winter and the devastating effects of radiation poisoning, are handled very well, too.I recommend this movie very highly.  The acting is very good, and the story is chilling.  Although the threat of nuclear war has greatly diminished in the years following the release of this movie, viewers can still get a glimpse of what could possibly happen.

It's not like some bombs drop, thousands of people die and then the survivors rebuild.  Not with nuclear war.  The fallout and radiation lasts much, much longer.  People's hair falls out, they break out in rashes and eventually die even if they survive the initial attack.

258388,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6301620208,JLind555,"[8, 9]","Probably the most heartbreaking scene in ""The Day After"" is the one where four missiles bearing nuclear warheads zoom into a crystalline blue sky on a glorious spring morning from a hidden bunker in Kansas, while doctors and nurses at a nearby hospital watch in shock as the impact of what those missiles mean gradually hits them.Watching this film, we pray that scene never comes true; if it does, we can kiss the world goodbye.  ""The Day After"" is probably the most gut-wrenching anti-war film ever made.  It's set sometime in the last quarter of the 20th century; the decades-long cold war has turned burning hot, and the news broadcasts are turning hourly worse.  We are in Lawrence, Kansas, the center of the United States, following the routines of ordinary people as they try to go about their lives while the world around them is going to hell -- a doctor and his wife, a farmer and his family, including his young daughter two days away from her wedding, a graduate student, a cynical college professor, and a young soldier about to be separated from his wife and baby.  The hostilities between Russia and the United States, meanwhile, have gone beyond the point of no return; and the decision is made: nuke 'em.  We watch the missiles being launched; we feel all the horror of the impending counterstrike, and then three stark words from an officer at the missile base: ""We have incoming.""  Incoming doesn't begin to describe it.  Two nuclear warheads hit nearby Kansas City, and the world explodes.  The resulting scenes of destruction are unbelievable; and yet, they are all too believable.  If the wrong finger hits the nuclear button, this could someday happen.The immediate scenes leading up to the nuclear strike are as compelling as the hit itself: shoppers at the supermarket grabbing up everything edible off the shelves; people bolting out of a college stadium in a panic dash for cover; a young bride-to-be coming downstairs to the family's fallout shelter carrying her wedding dress and her childhood teddy bear, the look of stark terror in her eyes competing with the realization that she will never wear that dress in any wedding; and her mother, grimly going about her business of making beds and tidying up the house, being carried kicking and screaming to shelter, refusing to accept the realization that her life as she knows it is finished.  And after the devastation of the nuclear strike, as ashes continue to rain down from the sky for days, we realize that those who died in the attack may have been the fortunate ones; the survivors are left to face a horrible slow death by radiation sickness, starvation and anarchy.Nicholas Meyer didn't direct this film for shock value, although the shocks keep coming and don't let up; in smaller but telling ways he makes us feel all the devastation of total war.  At the film's end, one of the survivors asks, ""Is anybody out there? Anyone at all?""  His guess is as good as ours.  There are no redeeming moments in this movie.  From the minute the first button was pushed, everything is gone.It's been said that ""The Day After"" is a dated film, but this is true only in the sense that the cold war, as we knew it from 1945 through the 1980s is over; as long as there are nuclear weapons around and anyone fanatic enough to even contemplate using them, it's a film with telling immediacy.  When the film was first shown, some viewers asked, why didn't they say who started the war?  Meyer shows us that the question is moot; no matter who started it, there will be precious few survivors left to point fingers.  We emerge from watching ""The Day After"" emotionally devastated, drained, realizing that in a nuclear war, everyone, even the victors, will be the losers.",4,The ultimate anti-war movie,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,3738,"['Probably', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'Day', 'one', 'where', 'four', 'missiles', 'bearing', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'zoom', 'crystalline', 'blue', 'sky', 'glorious', 'spring', 'morning', 'hidden', 'bunker', 'Kansas', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'nearby', 'hospital', 'watch', 'shock', 'impact', 'what', 'missiles', 'mean', 'gradually', 'them.Watching', 'film', 'pray', 'scene', 'never', 'true', 'can', 'kiss', 'world', 'goodbye', 'Day', 'probably', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'anti-war', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'set', 'sometime', 'last', 'quarter', '20th', 'century', 'decades-long', 'cold', 'war', 'turned', 'burning', 'hot', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'turning', 'hourly', 'worse', 'are', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'center', 'United', 'States', 'following', 'routines', 'ordinary', 'people', 'try', 'go', 'lives', 'world', 'going', 'hell', 'doctor', 'wife', 'farmer', 'family', 'including', 'young', 'daughter', 'two', 'days', 'away', 'wedding', 'graduate', 'student', 'cynical', 'college', 'professor', 'young', 'soldier', 'be', 'separated', 'wife', 'baby', 'hostilities', 'Russia', 'United', 'States', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'gone', 'point', 'return', 'decision', 'made', 'nuke', 'watch', 'missiles', 'being', 'launched', 'feel', 'horror', 'impending', 'counterstrike', 'then', 'three', 'stark', 'words', 'officer', 'missile', 'base', 'have', 'incoming', 'Incoming', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'Two', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'hit', 'nearby', 'Kansas', 'City', 'world', 'resulting', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'yet', 'are', 'too', 'believable', 'wrong', 'finger', 'nuclear', 'button', 'could', 'someday', 'happen.The', 'immediate', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'are', 'as', 'compelling', 'hit', 'shoppers', 'supermarket', 'grabbing', 'up', 'everything', 'edible', 'shelves', 'people', 'bolting', 'college', 'stadium', 'panic', 'dash', 'cover', 'young', 'bride-to-be', 'coming', 'downstairs', 'family', 'fallout', 'shelter', 'carrying', 'wedding', 'dress', 'childhood', 'teddy', 'bear', 'look', 'stark', 'terror', 'eyes', 'competing', 'realization', 'will', 'never', 'wear', 'dress', 'wedding', 'mother', 'grimly', 'going', 'business', 'making', 'beds', 'tidying', 'up', 'house', 'being', 'carried', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'shelter', 'refusing', 'accept', 'realization', 'life', 'finished', 'devastation', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'ashes', 'continue', 'rain', 'down', 'sky', 'days', 'realize', 'who', 'died', 'attack', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'ones', 'survivors', 'are', 'left', 'face', 'horrible', 'slow', 'death', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'starvation', 'anarchy.Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'film', 'shock', 'value', 'shocks', 'keep', 'coming', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'smaller', 'telling', 'ways', 'feel', 'devastation', 'total', 'war', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'survivors', 'asks', 'anybody', 'there', 'Anyone', 'guess', 'as', 'good', 'ours', 'are', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'movie', 'minute', 'first', 'button', 'was', 'pushed', 'everything', 'gone.It', 'been', 'said', 'Day', 'dated', 'film', 'true', 'only', 'sense', 'cold', 'war', 'knew', '1945', '1980s', 'over', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'anyone', 'fanatic', 'enough', 'even', 'contemplate', 'using', 'film', 'telling', 'immediacy', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'viewers', 'asked', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'started', 'war', 'Meyer', 'question', 'moot', 'matter', 'who', 'started', 'will', 'be', 'precious', 'few', 'survivors', 'left', 'point', 'fingers', 'emerge', 'watching', 'Day', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'drained', 'realizing', 'nuclear', 'war', 'everyone', 'even', 'victors', 'will', 'be', 'losers']",N/A

Mardis,"[1, 2]","At first I considered leading off this review with a pun like THE DAY AFTER was a ""blast"", but in all seriousness, I think the film warrants little humor. A powerful and devastating made-for-TV movie via the 80s, THE DAY AFTER depicts global thermonuclear war like it had never been seen before (or since). I first watched the picture sitting in my junior-high history class when I was 12 years old, and while I didn't remember any specifics of the film, I do remember it terrified me.

Touting a cast of veteran character actors including Jason Robards and Steve Guttenburg, the film attempts to portray the effects of the immediate prelude to and after-effects of a nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union.The first half of the picture is taut and engrossing, showing the town of Lawrence, Kansas trying to deal with the mounting crisis as students at the University of Kansas attempt to register for upcoming classes. The feelings of confusion, disbelief and helplessness experienced by the residents are effectively depicted.  The contrast between those who fatalistically prepare for the worst and those who refuse to accept the severity of the situation provides a powerful conflict of perspective.  This portion of the movie ends with an emotionally striking scene of the spectators at a football game staring upward in confusion and consternation as a flight of minuteman missiles from Whiteman Air Force Base leaves multiple arcing trails in the mid-day sky.The military footage, including the nuclear alert and response, is taken directly from a 1980 documentary series entitled &quot;The Defense of the United States.&quot; It is technically accurate and does a fairly good job of depicting the likely sequence of events as the ongoing conflict rapidly escalates from a European crisis into a general nuclear exchange.  The scenes of nuclear detonations and the immediate destruction caused are all stock footage which the viewer will recognize from countless other productions related to this subject.Once the nuclear blasts have ended, the story settles into a stock melodrama about ordinary people trying to cope with extra-ordinary events. Unfortunately, there are too many characters to allow any of them to be developed to a point where the viewer really cares what is happening or what will happen.The basic plot of trying to deal with a lack of supplies, communications, power and the breakdown of local society could come from any disaster movie.  The depiction of nuclear winter, which could have been a major central theme, is woefully inadequate and becomes just another undeveloped sidelight.In the final analysis, The Day After tries to do to much with too many characters and accomplishes virtually nothing.  If you have a strong interest in nuclear disaster movies, you may find the first half of the picture interesting.  Otherwise, there isn't much to recommend this film.",3,"Good cast, tepid movie. . .",948844800,"01 26, 2000",2000,2520,"['Day', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'short', 'goals', 'Touting', 'cast', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Steve', 'Guttenburg', 'film', 'attempts', 'portray', 'effects', 'immediate', 'prelude', 'after-effects', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union.The', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'taut', 'engrossing', 'showing', 'town', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'trying', 'deal', 'mounting', 'crisis', 'students', 'University', 'Kansas', 'attempt', 'register', 'upcoming', 'classes', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'disbelief', 'helplessness', 'experienced', 'residents', 'are', 'effectively', 'depicted', 'contrast', 'who', 'fatalistically', 'prepare', 'worst', 'who', 'refuse', 'accept', 'severity', 'situation', 'powerful', 'conflict', 'perspective', 'portion', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'striking', 'scene', 'spectators', 'football', 'game', 'staring', 'upward', 'confusion', 'consternation', 'flight', 'minuteman', 'missiles', 'Whiteman', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'multiple', 'arcing', 'trails', 'mid-day', 'sky.The', 'military', 'footage', 'including', 'nuclear', 'alert', 'response', 'taken', 'directly', '1980', 'documentary', 'series', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Defense', 'United', 'States.', 'quot', 'technically', 'accurate', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'likely', 'sequence', 'events', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'rapidly', 'European', 'crisis', 'general', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'scenes', 'nuclear', 'detonations', 'immediate', 'destruction', 'caused', 'are', 'stock', 'footage', 'viewer', 'will', 'recognize', 'countless', 'other', 'productions', 'related', 'subject.Once', 'nuclear', 'blasts', 'have', 'ended', 'story', 'stock', 'melodrama', 'ordinary', 'people', 'trying', 'cope', 'extra-ordinary', 'events', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'allow', 'be', 'developed', 'point', 'where', 'viewer', 'really', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'will', 'happen.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'trying', 'deal', 'lack', 'supplies', 'communications', 'power', 'breakdown', 'local', 'society', 'could', 'come', 'disaster', 'movie', 'depiction', 'nuclear', 'winter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'central', 'theme', 'woefully', 'inadequate', 'just', 'undeveloped', 'sidelight.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'Day', 'tries', 'do', 'much', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'accomplishes', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'have', 'strong', 'interest', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'movies', 'may', 'find', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'interesting', 'Otherwise', ""n't"", 'much', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

Yes, ""Threads"" was a good film, but quite a bit overrated.  Where ""The Day After"", I felt, was more powerful than ""Threads"" was in the suspensful build up to the initial attack, as well as the attack scenes themselves.  The attack scenes, particularly the actual nuclear detonations were far more realistic and frightening than those of ""Threads.""  In ""The Day After"", we see terrifying scenes of the missiles being launched, demonic mushroom clouds rising over the horizon, and huge walls of flame engulfing entire cities.  ""Threads"" merely showed a few building on fire and the actual explosions of the bombs looked like dynamite explosions in somemone's backyard, and were rather quite fake-looking.  Also, the cinematography really looks dated, as if was made in the early seventies.  I'd have to say that the main strong points of ""Threads"" were the fairly realistic aftermath scenes as well as the scientific information regarding the effects that the war would have on the earth. ""Threads"", overall, seemed to lack the frightful atmosphere that ""The Day After"" did so well in relaying.If anyone wants to see a truly worthy British effort, my advice is to check out ""The War Game.""  That film, I felt, was, far superior to ""Threads"" in that it contained a much more hard-hitting atmosphere and really did a marvelous job at showing the frightening amount of apathy that the general populace had toward a possible nuclear attack.  Also, the special effects were quite ahead of their time, especially for a film that was made in 1965.So, bottom line, for anyone that hasn't seen ""The Day After"", don't be fooled by some of the negative reviews given here by fans of ""Threads"".

258402,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,6301620208,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[7, 8]","Like many of the viewers here, I watched this movie when it first aired on TV, I was in junior high school. I remember the TV stations and media warning people not to watch it alone, and to not let little kids watch. I remember the little 'discussion groups' about it at school the next day. The main image that was left in my mind was almost everyone being vaporized when the bomb hits, and their skeletons showing through for a moment (especially the couple on their wedding day- that must have been kind of a drag).I was home from work sick a few months ago, and had nothing to watch. The movie hadn't started too long ago, and I figured what the heck, it would probably be interesting to see how 'dated' it looked, and how it wasn't even remotely scary anymore (especially since I wasn't 14 and impressionable, and one of the least of my worries as an adult is a nuclear war-I remember being scared it would happen on a regular basis for weeks after seeing the movie as a kid). I remember thinking that all the warnings to viewers were just really good publicity stunts by the networks to get people to watch. Maybe it would even be 'campy', right? Ha-ha! No.I watched the movie with only mild interest at first, but got more and more upset as it went on. This movie has not lost any of its impact, but actually disturbed me much more as an adult. Maybe its because I am now grown up, married, know how short life really is, and have more of a realistic idea about how horrible life would really be 'the day after'. I was actually shocked at how graphic and scary the movie was, especially to have been shown on prime time TV in the early 80's, even when watching in the middle of the day. There's a truly chilling scene when a main character has been in a bomb shelter too long and completely loses it, to bolt outside. She's so far gone that she just twirls around happily, as if she came out and the land they lived on looked exactly the same. Instead, the sky is grey, ash covers every surface, every single bit of plant life is dead, and the family dog and all the livestock lie flyblown and rotting (there is dead silence, expect for the sound of flies surrounding the bodies)...in another scene set in a hospital, there was a huge jump that made me hit the ceiling and left me muttering a curse afterwards.There are other images that I couldn't get out of my head for a long time, such as one of the last scenes where a man visits his ex-girlfriend in some sort of shelter for the radiation victims. They both end up sobbing, and the camera keeps pulling back until you see the other dead and dying people surrounding them number probably closer to the thousands than the 50 or so you thought were in the shelter at the beginning of the scene. It just keeps getting more and more depressing, grim, and scary, until the last incredibly depressing scene, which is made even sadder and more emotional because you see a character obviously insane and dying who you thought might be one of the ones to make it. Afterwards, I think I ended up having to watch &quot;Hairspray&quot; or something equally cheerful to cheer myself up and get my mind off it before I could take a nap.I always heard how &quot;Threads&quot; made &quot;The Day After&quot; look like an after school special, and had been looking for a copy for a long time (since when I hear that a movie is shocking and upsetting, it usually makes me want to see if it can live up to the buzz). I finally found a store that carries it, but you know what?

258404,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301620208,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[184, 196]","The political controversy over ""The Day After"" when it was first broadcast in 1983 had to do with the idea that a television movie about a nuclear war was an indictment of the policies of the Reagan Administration.  Of course ""The Day After"" was not an attack on a particular president, but rather it represented the liberal nightmare of the worst of all possible futures, with a full out nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Four years later the ultimate conservative nightmare was aired with the mini-series ""Amerika,"" in which the United States has been taken over by the Communists.  Both were predicated on questionable assumptions, the former on an escalation of a conflict over Berlin and the later on the effects of an electro-magnetic pulse, but those were both simply excuses to tell the story that wanted to be told.Ultimately ""The Day After"" is not so much a story as it is a depiction of what a nuclear war would be like that comes under the heading of ""seeing is believing.""  Prior to the airing of this television film Hollywood showed what it was like to live in the world after a nuclear war in films from ""On the Beach"" to ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,"" suggested that a nuclear war would be so horrible that a president would drop nuclear bombs on New York City rather than go to war in ""Fail Safe,"" and ended the Cold War satire of ""Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" with a series of atom bomb's exploding set to the popular song ""We'll Meet Again.""  But what they did not show was what that nuclear war would be like.  Even the ""Star Wars"" universe assumed there would be a nuclear war some day, as did I, but depicting the horrors of such a war was never really done until ""The Day After.""However, exploding mushroom clouds and the victims of radiation poison were not what was most memorable about ""The Day After.""  The icon image from the film became the shots of the missiles taking off, with the people of Lawrence, Kansas looking up into the sky at the ICBMs headed towards the Soviet Union knowing that their missiles were heading for us.  Suddenly it became clear that the true moment of horror would be when you saw those missiles because chances were you would never see the mushroom cloud that took your life.  In fact, given the choice between being incinerated and surviving long enough to watch your loved ones suffer horribly, I think most people would hope for the quick death.  This film turned those last few minutes of life from the old joke about how you need to bend over, put your head between your knees and kiss you ass goodbye into an enduring image of outright terror.The worst moments of this film are the painful period between the missiles taking off and the nukes exploding.  One of the silos is right next to the Dahlberg farm, and the emotion nadir of the film is Denise Dahlberg (Lori Lethin) comes down the stairs holding the wedding dress she will never get to wear and her father tells her to get into the storm cellar.  Then Jim Dahlberg (John Cullum) has to go upstairs and drag his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) screaming and crying away from the bed she is making in a desperate attempt to pretend that the world is not coming to an end.Jason Robards is Dr. Russell Oakes, who along with Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams) has to deal with the casualties following the detonations at a besieged hospital,  and Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) is the guy who takes refuge with the Dahlbergs.  Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) is the college professor who gets to supply most of the relatively small amount of exposition the story requires: a student thinks they are safe because Kansas is in the middle of nowhere, but the professor is the one who points out ""There's no 'nowhere' anymore"" since there is an Air Force base and 150 Minutemen Missile silos spread halfway down Missouri, all constituting ""an awful lot of bullseyes.""  When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched ""The Day After"" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a ""nuclear winter"" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen.  To say that this was a sobering idea to give an audience that was already depressed by what they had seen, would be an understatement.  Sagan, of course, was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons and condemned the arms race.  Speaking on the other side, which is to say in favor of the concept of nuclear deterrence, was William F. Buckley, Jr., and what we got to see in that debate (which is still available on video) was that both were right.It is rather amazing, given the history of humanity, that it has been almost sixty years since nuclear weapons have been used in war.  Ironically, we now live in a world where we still believe that those weapons are going to be used, although now we assume it will be the work of terrorists (or an attempt to stop terrorists) and not a war between East and West.  I would not be surprised if right now Hollywood is kicking around ideas of what it would be like the day after that sort of nuclear detonation, going beyond what we saw in ""The Sum of All Fears.""  Hopefully it would be as successful at forestalling our worst nightmares as ""The Day After"" has been these many years.",5,Watching the ICBMs take off and head for the Soviet Union...,1097712000,"10

It is in this context that The Day After sheds light (as it should do) on the much lessened, yet still relevant, threat of nuclear war and its deadly effects on mankind.

The film is filled with haunting images. Two of my favorites are people watching as American missiles take off, headed for the Soviet Union, knowing that there must be Soviet missiles headed for them. The other is an airial shot of the hospital, showing the grounds littered with the dead and dying-much like the similer scene in Gone With the Wind. Of course, The Day After should be seen in the contex of its times. It was 1983, the third year of the Reagan Administration, and the left had been whipped into a frenzy over the proposition that Reagan, by opposing the Soviet Union, was certain to start a nuclear war. Hundreds of thousands had marched for things like a nuclear freeze in Europe and the United States. The Day After was really supposed to show what would happen if Reagan was not stopped. The great irony is that the fears expressed by the makers of The Day After never came to pass. History has shown that Reagan was right. By opposing Soviet aggression, especially with his SDI proposal, President Reagan forstalled the horrific future of The Day After and brought into reality the real future, with the Soviet Empire in ruins and American triumphant.(...)",2,A Powerfully Filmed Work of Propeganda,989107200,"05 6, 2001",2001,1390,"['Day', 'divorced', 'contex', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'powerfully', 'filmed', 'movie.It', 'effect', 'ultimate', 'disaster', 'movie', 'instead', 'building', 'ship', 'entire', 'world', 'destroyed', 'film', 'filled', 'haunting', 'images', 'Two', 'favorites', 'are', 'people', 'watching', 'American', 'missiles', 'take', 'off', 'headed', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'knowing', 'must', 'be', 'Soviet', 'missiles', 'headed', 'other', 'airial', 'shot', 'hospital', 'showing', 'grounds', 'littered', 'dead', 'dying-much', 'similer', 'scene', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'course', 'Day', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'contex', 'times', 'was', '1983', 'third', 'year', 'Reagan', 'Administration', 'left', 'had', 'been', 'whipped', 'frenzy', 'proposition', 'Reagan', 'opposing', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'certain', 'start', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Hundreds', 'thousands', 'had', 'marched', 'things', 'nuclear', 'freeze', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'Day', 'was', 'really', 'supposed', 'show', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Reagan', 'was', 'not', 'stopped', 'great', 'irony', 'fears', 'expressed', 'makers', 'Day', 'never', 'came', 'pass', 'History', 'shown', 'Reagan', 'was', 'right', 'opposing', 'Soviet', 'aggression', 'especially', 'SDI', 'proposal', 'President', 'Reagan', 'forstalled', 'horrific', 'future', 'Day', 'brought', 'reality', 'real', 'future', 'Soviet', 'Empire', 'ruins', 'American', 'triumphant.']",N/A

Brookes,"[1, 1]","The Day After is one of those films that I'd always meant to get round to watching and never did, after re-watching Threads recently I decided to make a new effort to get hold of it. I'm glad I did, this is a very similar film to Threads (although it predates it by a few months) as it covers the same basic events but told from an American rather than British perspective.The film was made in the mid-eighties when the possibility of an all out nuclear war was still a common fear, it follows a more traditional narrative approach compared to Thread's documentary style. Its made for TV roots shows in the production, but don't let that put you off as it is an excellent, if grim film.It takes a while to get going, the build up is slow as you're introduced to the various characters (although they are all based in same region of the US). Besides the setting this is the main difference between the two films, Threads focused on one central character where here the cast is much larger (and there's quite a few known faces making it a fun who's who spotting exercise).Once the action gets going the change is stark, it's not quite as bleak as Threads but it is still a grim sequence of events. The actual nuclear attack is quite well done in a low budget way, but still effective. Only the immediate aftermath of the attack is shown (where Threads stretches further into the future), there is a comment at the end stating that the film probably understimates the impact of an all-out attack, which does drive the point home.For its time this was a very shocking film and while we have different fears these days it still illustrates the potential we have as a species to damage ourselves.

258418,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6301620208,Michael R Gates,"[3, 6]","The made-for-TV film THE DAY AFTER was enormously controversial when it was originally broadcast on ABC in November of 1983, primarily because it was promoted as being the first film to accurately and realistically depict a nuclear holocaust and its aftermath.  Political right-wingers didn't like it because they believed such a film would deter support of a strong U.S. military and a large nuclear arsenal.  Those on the left were concerned that it might promote the idea that a full-scale nuclear war could be survivable, thereby INCREASING support of the right-wing's push for a strong U.S. military and a large nuclear arsenal.  And both sides were worried that the film would be too graphic for the prime-time position in which it was slotted to air.  In fact, much of the controversy was vehement enough to worry the sponsors, so consequently not a single minute of commercial time was sold for the part of the film following the depiction of the nuclear war--the last half of the show was aired commercial free!Socio-political controversy aside, THE DAY AFTER is a very powerful and compelling drama.  In the tradition of great SF and horror films, it takes a real-life potentiality--in this case, nuclear holocaust--and portrays it as graphically and as realistically as possible, thereby allowing viewers to vicariously experience the nightmare. For this film, said nightmare takes place in the small towns surrounding Kansas City, one of the ground-zero targets for the enemy's hydrogen bombs.  But the real horror of it all is not the bombing itself.  The real horror is being a survivor and having to suffer through the aftermath with things like radioactive fallout, nuclear winter, contaminated food and water, political anarchy, and the like.Portraying survivors from various walks of life, the highly talented cast--which includes big names like Jason Robards, JoBeth Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and John Lithgow, to name a few--does a fantastic job running the gamut of human emotion as their characters come to grips with the traumatic and devastating situation. The excellent script for THE DAY AFTER was written by Edward Hume, a respected TV writer best known for his work on series greats like THE FUGITIVE, CANNON (which he also developed), and THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO.  And the film was directed by the venerable Nicholas Meyer, who has directed other SF greats such as 1979's TIME AFTER TIME, 1982's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, and 1991's STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY, and who has written the screenplays for other greats like 1976's THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION (having previously written the novel), 1986's STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME, and 1987's highly acclaimed FATAL ATTRACTION.  With such great talent behind it, it's not hard to defend the claim that THE DAY AFTER is ONE of the best films, if not THE best film, made specifically for TV.The DVD from MGM is a no-frills disc, meaning that it is without bonus material, but it does offer a nearly pristine digital transfer of THE DAY AFTER in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  And the asking price is very reasonable (especially with amazon.com's discount), so lovers of great films and good drama have no excuse for not having this gem in their collections.",5,Life As We Know It Ends...THE DAY AFTER,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,3266,"['made-for-TV', 'film', 'THE', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'was', 'enormously', 'controversial', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'November', '1983', 'primarily', 'was', 'promoted', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'accurately', 'realistically', 'depict', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'aftermath', 'Political', 'right-wingers', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'believed', 'film', 'would', 'deter', 'support', 'strong', 'U.S.', 'military', 'large', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'left', 'were', 'concerned', 'might', 'promote', 'idea', 'full-scale', 'nuclear', 'war', 'could', 'be', 'survivable', 'thereby', 'INCREASING', 'support', 'right-wing', 'push', 'strong', 'U.S.', 'military', 'large', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'sides', 'were', 'worried', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'graphic', 'prime-time', 'position', 'was', 'slotted', 'air', 'fact', 'much', 'controversy', 'was', 'vehement', 'enough', 'worry', 'sponsors', 'so', 'consequently', 'not', 'single', 'minute', 'commercial', 'time', 'was', 'sold', 'part', 'film', 'following', 'depiction', 'nuclear', 'war', 'last', 'half', 'show', 'was', 'aired', 'commercial', 'free', 'Socio-political', 'controversy', 'aside', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'very', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'drama', 'tradition', 'great', 'SF', 'horror', 'films', 'real-life', 'potentiality', 'case', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'graphically', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'vicariously', 'experience', 'nightmare', 'film', 'said', 'nightmare', 'place', 'small', 'towns', 'surrounding', 'Kansas', 'City', 'one', 'ground-zero', 'targets', 'enemy', 'hydrogen', 'bombs', 'real', 'horror', 'not', 'bombing', 'real', 'horror', 'being', 'survivor', 'having', 'suffer', 'aftermath', 'things', 'radioactive', 'fallout', 'nuclear', 'winter', 'contaminated', 'food', 'water', 'political', 'anarchy', 'like.Portraying', 'survivors', 'various', 'walks', 'life', 'highly', 'talented', 'cast', 'big', 'names', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'name', 'few', 'fantastic', 'job', 'running', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotion', 'characters', 'come', 'grips', 'traumatic', 'devastating', 'situation', 'excellent', 'script', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'was', 'written', 'Edward', 'Hume', 'respected', 'TV', 'writer', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'series', 'greats', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'CANNON', 'also', 'developed', 'THE', 'STREETS', 'OF', 'SAN', 'FRANCISCO', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'venerable', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'who', 'directed', 'other', 'SF', 'greats', 'such', '1979', 'TIME', 'AFTER', 'TIME', '1982', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'II', 'WRATH', 'OF', 'KHAN', '1991', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'VI', 'UNDISCOVERED', 'COUNTRY', 'who', 'written', 'screenplays', 'other', 'greats', '1976', 'SEVEN-PER-CENT', 'SOLUTION', 'having', 'previously', 'written', 'novel', '1986', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'IV', 'VOYAGE', 'HOME', '1987', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'not', 'hard', 'defend', 'claim', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'ONE', 'best', 'films', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'specifically', 'TV.The', 'DVD', 'MGM', 'no-frills', 'disc', 'meaning', 'bonus', 'material', 'offer', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'digital', 'transfer', 'THE', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'asking', 'price', 'very', 'reasonable', 'especially', 'amazon.com', 'discount', 'lovers', 'great', 'films', 'good', 'drama', 'have', 'excuse', 'not', 'having', 'gem', 'collections']",N/A

Unlike &quot;Testament&quot;, which worked inexorably on character development, &quot;The Day After&quot; blitzed through its two dozen characters in the Before time in short snippets, and as a result, when the Bombs fall (and there are more than one), we don't really know them that well, and as a consequence, it is hard to empathize with the individuals.  Jason Robards is one of the exceptions.The effects are excellent; the scenes of the missiles rising out of the plains are worth the watching, and the airbursts over a crowded highway are equally unmatched.  But for the most part, as the characters one-by-one develop radiation sickness, we see them as specimens and not individual people.  (The British films &quot;Threads&quot; and &quot;The War Game&quot; also suffer this problem).  The low-budget &quot;Testament&quot; with Jane Alexander succeeds where these films failed.Trivia point:  After the last episode, ABC ran a panel discussion which included the original Dr. Strangelove himself, Henry Kissinger. It was delightful to see Dr. K absolutely foaming at the mouth as he denounced the movie as fear-mongering.The film is now hopelessly dated, since it is entirely postulated upon a massive Soviet-US exchange.  Yes, both nations still have thousands of warheads, but our current threats, if equally serious, are not of this magnitude.",3,Anti Nuclear Film Needed Character Development,1066176000,"10 15, 2003",2003,1908,"['quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'answer', 'Reagan', 'Administration', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'quot', 'drumbeat', 'Conflicts', 'Central', 'America', 'Soviet', 'occupation', 'Afghanistan', 'largest', 'arms', 'buildup', 'post-war', 'period', 'generated', 'climate', 'genuine', 'fear', 'great', 'fanfare', 'expensive', 'press', 'campaign', 'ABC', 'screened', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'successive', 'nights', 'prime', 'time', 'television.A', 'number', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes', 'were', 'circulation', 'time', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'was', 'easily', 'biggest', 'not', 'best', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Testament', 'quot', 'worked', 'inexorably', 'character', 'development', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'blitzed', 'two', 'dozen', 'characters', 'Before', 'time', 'short', 'snippets', 'result', 'when', 'Bombs', 'fall', 'are', 'more', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'well', 'consequence', 'hard', 'empathize', 'individuals', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'one', 'exceptions.The', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'missiles', 'rising', 'plains', 'are', 'watching', 'airbursts', 'crowded', 'highway', 'are', 'equally', 'unmatched', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'one-by-one', 'develop', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'see', 'specimens', 'not', 'individual', 'people', 'British', 'films', 'quot', 'Threads', 'quot', 'quot', 'War', 'Game', 'quot', 'also', 'suffer', 'problem', 'low-budget', 'quot', 'Testament', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'where', 'films', 'failed.Trivia', 'point', 'last', 'episode', 'ABC', 'ran', 'panel', 'discussion', 'included', 'original', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'was', 'delightful', 'see', 'Dr.', 'K', 'absolutely', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'denounced', 'movie', 'fear-mongering.The', 'film', 'now', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'entirely', 'postulated', 'massive', 'Soviet-US', 'exchange', 'Yes', 'nations', 'still', 'have', 'thousands', 'warheads', 'current', 'threats', 'equally', 'serious', 'are', 'not', 'magnitude']",N/A

I remember there were several ""close calls"" where malfuntions or errors in the systems actually almost started nuclear attacks from both sides!The part about this movie that stands out is when the father/farmer/husband comes back on horseback to find stragglers having a bbq on his front yard eating dead and radiated cattle not caring if its contaminated.  He pulls out his shotgun and asks what they are all doing there and the people look frightening...all men and a young boy or two.

258426,ACGNP00TEIEV3,6301620208,Pat Dewees,"[4, 4]","European movie critics didn't like ""The Day After.""  They said that it was not well made and was poorly acted.  They may have been right.  But that was not the point.  This movie is brave in that it only tries to do one thing.  That is to show what would happen if there were a nuclear war.  Therefore, it deserves to be ranked as one of the best made-for-TV movies of all times.The setting is not New York or Los Angeles or any of the huge cities.  It is Kansas City and nearby Lawrence, Kansas, home of the University of Kansas.  The subplots of the characters lives are appropriately interrupted by the falling of the bombs.The first scene after the nuclear explosions is outdoor rubble and falling snow.  But it's not snow.  It's fallout.  The doctor character played by Jason Robards is overwhelmed by those needing treatment at the humble campus hospital which is the only remaining hospital for perhaps 100 miles.  People stand in line for a sip of uncontaminated water from a pump.  All of these images are horrifying but they are based on scientific research.When this movie was first aired on TV in November 1983 experts warned that those less than 13 years old should not be exposed to this film.  But the movie was so highly publicized before its airing that no parent could possibly be unaware of the content of ""The Day After"" let alone that it was going to be on TV.  The night it was on, it became one of the 20 highest rated television programs of all time.  The next morning schools across the country had classroom discussions about this movie.Since that time, Reagan and Gorbachev made massive reductions in nuclear arms.  The Soviet Union itself has disbanded.  The threat of a Cold War nuclear confrontation is now diminished.  But in some ways we are less safe.  The Soviet breakup left nuclear weapons scattered around several breakaway republics.  Russia brought those nukes home but their ability to keep these weapons secured from thieves is in doubt.And based on what happened on 9/11/01, there are people who may be crazy enough to use them.  Now anti-Western sentiment comes not from Communist controlled Eastern republics but from radical Islamic Jihadists who we know are actively seeking nuclear weapons.  If these terrorists had the opportunity to use a nuclear weapon in an attack in the United States, it would make the World Trade Center attack look like a firecracker in comparison.""The Day After"" is realistic with the following caveat.  A caption at the end of the movie tells us that the effects of a nuclear war would actually be worse than depicted here.

258427,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,6301620208,Patrick L. Randall,"[5, 6]","In the early 1980's, the United States and the Soviet Union were closer to the brink of nuclear war than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis (possibly even closer).  On one side, there was President Reagan referring to the USSR as the 'Evil Empire'.  On the other side, there was a steady succession of pre-Gorbachev Soviet Premiers (one seemed to die every several months) who stood fast to the hard line Communist party manifesto and constantly rattled their saber at the west.  During this period of the storm before the calm (brought about by Gorbachev's reforms), the world was on edge over the prospect of these two nations engaging in full-scale nuclear armageddon.  There were a number of television executives during this time who saw fit produce cautionary tales about the horrors of a nuclear war.  In Great Britain, a devastating made for TV film depicting horrific after effects of such a war called ""Threads"" was released (and shown in the states on TBS at considerable expense to the station's owner Ted Turner, because he thought it was too important not to be shown in the U.S.).  In the United States, two notable made-for-TV films were created dealing with this subject, ""Special Bulletin"" and ""The Day After"".  ""The Day After"" was the much more publicized of the two, owing to an all-star cast (Jason Robards and John Lithgow to name a few) and truly terrifying images of the actual attack.  As with any film that depicts very unsettling situations, ""The Day After"" generated its share of controversy.  Though, little of the controversy is remembered beyond the criticisms of the graphic nature of the attacks, and it does nothing to detract for chilling message it presents.The movie is set in Kansas City, Missouri; a place about as middle American as one get.  During the first half of the movie, we are introduced to a cross-section of KC's population, from a university hospital doctor (played by Robards) to a young Air Force Airmen and his family to a farm family preparing for the wedding of their oldest daughter.  There are many other characters and groups of characters introduced while, in the background, tension builds as frequent radio and television updates are received about a deteriorating military situation in East Germany that is rapidly bringing the United States and the Soviet Union to the nuclear brink.  This movie focuses little on the politicians who make the decision to go to war or the military men who fight the war.  It's about the innocent people who will have to live with the effects of these men's decisions.  The actual officers who execute the launches are depicted as impersonal machines of war, not human beings like the characters this movie highlights.  A radio speech by the president late in the movie betrays the faulty mindset of the politicians when he tries to give a rousing patriotic speech proclaiming victory over the evil aggressors while the people who listen are trying simply to survive and not fall victim to radiation sickness.The true climax of this movie occurs about midway through the film.  Reports are filtering of limited nuclear engagements in Europe which eventually lead to the full scale launch of all nuclear missiles.  The frightening scenes of the missiles taking off being viewed from a next door farm, the university hospital, and a football stadium are indescribable in the sense of panic they create.  Our missiles have been launched and will take 30 minutes to reach Russia, but so will theirs!  People try to find shelter.  They try to evacuate.  Yet, the question is posed, ""where does one go from Kansas City?"".  This is supposed to be the middle of nowhere, but with missile silos being placed any and everywhere across the country, no place is safe from attack.  Next, the horrifying images of the attacks beginning are easily seared into one's memory.  See the images of people vaporizing, fires engulfing everything, and the signature mushroom clouds of a nuclear detonation are not soon forgotten.  After the attack is over, ""The Day After"" engages in a lengthy denouement that deals with the unlucky people who managed to survive the war.  Radiation sickness impacts almost everyone, but not as much as the complete and total breakdown of infrastructure and society in general.  The horrors of the 'new world' are of the type that one should not be anxious to experience.  There is a note at the very end that claims that the events depicted in this movie are likely less severe than what really would occur in the event of an actual nuclear attack.  Given what IS depicted here, that is an absolutely horrifying thought.The only real criticisms for the ""The Day After"" center around two points.  First, there really are too many characters introduced.  Some barely even register because there isn't enough time to develop them.  Second, the denouement is a bit lengthy.  The message of how horrible the after effects of this nuclear war are could probably have been trimmed down to half the time without losing any of its impact.  Still, these minor gripes do not take anything away from the overall powerful message of this movie.  If more world leaders were forced to watch ""The Day After"" (and several of its companion films), the likelihood of nuclear war could drop significantly.",4,Devastating tale of nuclear war in middle

258430,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301620208,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","The Day After (Nicholas Meyer, 1983)Recently, motivated by a strong desire to see Threads again, I've been going through a kind of craving for nuclear-holocaust-flick nostalgia. Seeing The Day After again was my first foray back into the world of atom-bombs-blowing-stuff-up. I hadn't seen it since its original television broadcast more than twenty years previous, and was surprised at how well it holds up.The excellent ensemble cast is headed by the late Jason Robards (Magnolia, Enemy of the State, etc.) and John Lithgow (Shrek, Third Rock from the Sun, etc.) as a doctor and scientist, respectively, at two college campuses in the midwest in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. (Said nuclear holocaust happens, as one might expect, early in the film, but not as early as you might figure; unlike modern-day films, stuff made a quarter of a century ago actually took time to build its characters before getting into the plot.) Also along for the ride are Robards' right-hand nurse, played by JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist); a family whose house was close to one of the bombed missile silos, the Dahlbergs; Lithgow's right-hand man Aldo (Stephen Furst of Animal House fame), oh, we'll just run down some names: John Cullum, Bibi Besch, Steve Guttenberg, Lori Lethin, Amy Madigan, Jeff East, Dennis Lipscomb, Arliss Howard... you get the idea. This may have been a made-for-TV movie, but didn't shirk on the starpower. Also, look for uncredited appearances by Wayne Knight (Seinfeld's Newman), David Kaufman (Presidio Med, Pearl Harbor), John Lafayette (various movies based on Tom Clancy novels), and the late director Herk Harvey (in his first screen role since Carnival of Souls twenty years before, and the last before his death in 1996). Meyer and co. didn't scrimp on the casting budget.It shows. The whole thing is exceptionally well-acted, though sometimes it's a bit tough to believe these folks are really as devastated as one would think survivors of an all-out nuclear war should be (and that a house situated right next to a bombed missile silo would still be standing just because Steve Guttenberg happens to be hiding there provides a moment of unintentional humor). Robards is probably the best at communicating this, especially in the movie's final scene. The makeup job on Robards was also not scrimped on; by the end of the film, he could be something out of a Romero film. For that matter, the makeup crew did an all-around fantastic job; by the end of the flick, Steve Guttenberg was unrecognizable. (I have heard it opined-- well, okay, inside my own head-- that perhaps he should have kept the makeup on when doing Three Man and a Baby.)The point was brought up in a recent discussion that perhaps those born after the early eighties will probably be too young to really grasp the terrors of the Cold War to those of us old enough to remember ""Duck... and Cover!"" So perhaps not the best flick to get your kids to thinking about how bad off you were in the old days (for that, use Threads), but it's definitely worthwhile on the nostalgia-trip angle, or if you just like watching Jason Robards act with an equally fantastic cast around him. ****",4,Ensemble cast shines.,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,3172,"['Day', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', '1983', 'Recently', 'motivated', 'strong', 'desire', 'see', 'Threads', 'again', ""'ve"", 'been', 'going', 'kind', 'craving', 'nuclear-holocaust-flick', 'nostalgia', 'Seeing', 'Day', 'again', 'was', 'first', 'foray', 'back', 'world', 'atom-bombs-blowing-stuff-up', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'television', 'broadcast', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'previous', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'up.The', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'headed', 'late', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Magnolia', 'Enemy', 'State', 'etc', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'etc', 'doctor', 'scientist', 'respectively', 'two', 'college', 'campuses', 'midwest', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'Said', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'happens', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'early', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'early', 'might', 'figure', 'modern-day', 'films', 'stuff', 'made', 'quarter', 'century', 'actually', 'took', 'time', 'build', 'characters', 'getting', 'plot', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'Robards', 'right-hand', 'nurse', 'played', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'Poltergeist', 'family', 'house', 'was', 'close', 'one', 'bombed', 'missile', 'silos', 'Dahlbergs', 'Lithgow', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Aldo', 'Stephen', 'Furst', 'Animal', 'House', 'fame', 'oh', ""'ll"", 'just', 'run', 'down', 'names', 'John', 'Cullum', 'Bibi', 'Besch', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'Lori', 'Lethin', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Jeff', 'East', 'Dennis', 'Lipscomb', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'get', 'idea', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'shirk', 'starpower', 'Also', 'look', 'uncredited', 'appearances', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Seinfeld', 'Newman', 'David', 'Kaufman', 'Presidio', 'Med', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'John', 'Lafayette', 'various', 'movies', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'late', 'director', 'Herk', 'Harvey', 'first', 'screen', 'role', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'twenty', 'years', 'last', 'death', '1996', 'Meyer', 'co.', 'did', ""n't"", 'scrimp', 'casting', 'budget.It', 'shows', 'whole', 'thing', 'exceptionally', 'well-acted', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'tough', 'believe', 'folks', 'are', 'really', 'as', 'devastated', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'survivors', 'all-out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'house', 'situated', 'right', 'next', 'bombed', 'missile', 'silo', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'standing', 'just', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'be', 'hiding', 'there', 'moment', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'Robards', 'probably', 'best', 'communicating', 'especially', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'makeup', 'job', 'Robards', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'scrimped', 'end', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'Romero', 'film', 'matter', 'makeup', 'crew', 'did', 'all-around', 'fantastic', 'job', 'end', 'flick', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'was', 'unrecognizable', 'have', 'heard', 'opined', 'well', 'own', 'head', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'makeup', 'when', 'doing', 'Three', 'Man', 'Baby', 'point', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'recent', 'discussion', 'perhaps', 'born', 'early', 'eighties', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'grasp', 'terrors', 'Cold', 'War', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Duck', 'Cover', 'So', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'flick', 'get', 'kids', 'thinking', 'how', 'bad', 'were', 'old', 'days', 'use', 'Threads', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'nostalgia-trip', 'angle', 'just', 'watching', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'act', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'cast', '****']",N/A
258431,AQI9DAK2CX2B9,6301620208,Rokudan,"[1, 1]","I saw the previews on ABC television when this film was the talk of 1983. I was not at all primed for what I watched those next two uninterrupted hours. I remember President Reagan coming on immediately after the telecast admonishing the public to stay sober and that the country was nowhere near the stage of this film. Well, that's what politicians are supposed to say. I later read he was as shook up as everyone else. He sat depressed by himself for a long time after his private screening.There is a denominator commentary in the film that addresses our capacity to block out reminders of our mortality.The movie does not and nor should it apologize for its transparency of just how people are : sheeple . We witness the simplified bubble-like existance of Lawrence, Kansas, in seemingly mass denial that the unthinkable could happen literally in their back yard and why not literally since a missile silo is twenty yards to the right of the barn.But maybe Im being a bit harsh here. Maybe denial is the best coping mechanism when you live yards away from a live round underground missile silo currently being checked...twice.The story doesn't build with predictable speeches from brooding academics or senior cynics sitting on porches sipping cider. We get the story the way jaded America gets it : news flashes and testing signals from the emergency broadcasting system on TV screens in the backgrounds of various living rooms of the characters and they treat it as an afterthought...as we do. But select characters heard the breaking news about soviets closing in on Berlin and moiled over a mounting nuclear strike but not where they couldn't retreat to the comfort of the conventional wisdom of "" ...or maybe they will contain it"" and use those symphony tickets.But not the audience. The director keeps the TV loud enough in the background where we can hear and discern the urgency while the girls argue over who hid the birth control pills. There was a scene where little kids were watching TV where a reporter described missiles being air-burst over ""advancing soviet troops"" as they showed American air force pilots running to their bombers and what were their parents doing? Walked right by the TV to go have sex! The movie explores motivations in how the mind copes with the inevitable  by instinctively retreating to primal appetites like food and sex which illustrates mans deeper instinctive longing to be told what to do when a crisis hits. The whole essence of our faith in warning systems and voices over speakers telling where to hide and where to meet rides on it...that cocoon of cynical co-dependency finally fails in the face of a power that is sovereign and absolute in its destruction.And this was pretty much how the film revealed the story to us in the first hour...through news flashes and speculative conversations between the jaded and the seasoned everywhere from barbershops to university cafeteria to country kitchens prepping for life's rare highlight: the daughter's wedding.The second hour was not just a storm cloud of Iconic images and sounds of a population caught unprepared, it was an in your face frontal assault against our sensibilities.1)The  sounds we cherish like the quiet cornfields and rustling wheat violated by the unnerving radio squawking of "" We want to confirm...is this an exercise...negative..repeat..negative. Roger copy...this is not an exercise!""2) Downtown shoppers running in a panic horrified at the thought of not enough room in the shelters intercut with Eve setting the table while worrying is there enough potato salad for the guests. ...and then the blood scream as her husband snatches her from making the beds and carries her to the basement...she knows its over.3) The little boy in the backyard frozen with his mouth gaped open watching a missile emerge out of that fenced off sandbox yards away his parked bicycle.4) The disembodied voice in the chaotic supermarket yelling, ""just get the canned goods...the batteries.""5) Dr. Oats listening to emergency broadcast instructions while driving alone on the expressway as gridlock clogs the opposite direction.6) Doctors rush into the hospital courtyard to see missile trails overhead.7) A football game in a sold out stadium. The players stop. No movement in the  stands as three white smoke trails arc the sky.Intimacy. Innocence. Healing. The winning touchdown replaced with the touch down of an ICBM in twenty minutes. All society signposts vaporized.We are left with a slow disintegration of relationships for the rest of the film. No feel good bonding here. Again, the script doesn't let you exhale. The special effects were more implied than absolute.They didn't have to be absolute because it fit the movie's gritty saturated look of once vibrant colored reds and golds of a Kansas countryside seared into the dirty white ashen gray of an impending nuclear winter that could last six years. The director lingers the camera on scenes of suffering to where its uncomfortable and sometimes excruciating to watch. Self preservation runs amok. Man has thrown his two babies of moral and ethical facilities out with the bath water of commonsense. The rest is anarchy, sticks, and stones.""Is there anybody there...anybody at all."" The Professor asks over the CB radio as the movie ends. The film doesn't answer that question. It just takes its place as one of the great movie lines that addresses when man makes eye contact with the insurmountable...and it doesn't blink. Its been thirty years since ""The Day After"". The question remains unanswered.",5,...directly over downtown...the sun...exploding,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,5573,"['saw', 'previews', 'ABC', 'television', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'talk', '1983',

This movie is not anywhere near the realm of fantasy.The Day After could happen every second of every day that nuclear weapons exist.  Everything you know and love could be erased in a second of blinding light and searing heat.  Those close enough to the epicenter of any nuclear strike would be the lucky ones.  Those who survive would truly suffer.The sheer intensity of emotion and terror depicted in this film is almost nauseating.  Give me monsters, gore, chainsaw wielding maniacs and I'll be fine; show me the potential extinction of the human race as a consequence of politics and I'm sleeping with the lights on.It's hard to believe that this was a made for tv movie and that it was presented in its entirety.  It's doubtful that something this scathing could be shown on television in the current atmosphere of government sanctioned censorship.

The Day After accurately and intimately depicts the tragedy of a nuclear holocaust. Viewers end up thinking that the lucky ones are those that were killed immediately by the blast and, in no case, the actual survivors...The story is quite simple: a group of US citizens go through their daily occupations in a Mid-West city while, at the same time, political and military escalation between Russia and the US builds up. What must happen finally happens and, guess what, the nukes fly off and cross each other in the sky on their way to their respective targets.The movie goes on in its depiction of the war after the nukes actually detonate. The fate of the survivors is therefore shown in graphic, vivid and utterly realistic details. Each and every viewer is therefore capable of identifying him/herself to any of the featured characters, making for a closer personal proximity to the movie action and unfolding drama.The main originality and interest of this movie is that, first, unlike its predecessors and successors, this end-of-the-world tale goes beyond the actual act of the ICBM's lifting off their launch pads. It's like the movie finally dares lifting some veil off the real mystery and horror of the survivors' conditions and struggle to remain alive. The survivors are just human beings that constantly have to fight their radioactive ""illness"". We all know how futile and useless such a struggle is...Second, this movie was of almost historical reach when it was first released in 1983. Its shock-wave in the media and public opinion was so powerful that it made the headlines of newspapers back then. People talked about it with fear in their heart and mind. It certainly played a great role in making people accutely aware of the end results of a nuclear conflict, whereas most of them had never questioned its necessity until then. I have no doubt that this movie led to a greater level of awareness on this subject in the West and ultimately helped in negotiating the non-proliferation of nuclear WMD's treaties between the US and Russia throughout the 80's and early 90's.A must-see movie about what nukes can do and the conditions they would leave us in as a species -should they ever take to the skies...",5,A unique movie of historical reach!!,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2322,"['Quite', 'simply', 'only', 'handful', 'movies', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'one', 'Day', 'accurately', 'intimately', 'tragedy', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'Viewers', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'lucky', 'ones', 'are', 'were', 'killed', 'immediately', 'blast', 'case', 'actual', 'survivors', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'group', 'US', 'citizens', 'go', 'daily', 'occupations', 'Mid-West', 'city', 'same', 'time', 'political', 'military', 'escalation', 'Russia', 'US', 'up', 'What', 'must', 'happen', 'finally', 'happens', 'guess', 'what', 'nukes', 'fly', 'off', 'cross', 'other', 'sky', 'way', 'respective', 'targets.The', 'movie', 'depiction', 'war', 'nukes', 'actually', 'detonate', 'fate', 'survivors', 'therefore', 'shown', 'graphic', 'vivid', 'utterly', 'realistic', 'details', 'viewer', 'therefore', 'capable', 'identifying', 'featured', 'characters', 'making', 'closer', 'personal', 'proximity', 'movie', 'action', 'unfolding', 'drama.The', 'main', 'originality', 'interest', 'movie', 'first', 'predecessors', 'successors', 'end-of-the-world', 'tale', 'actual', 'act', 'ICBM', 'lifting', 'off', 'launch', 'pads', 'movie', 'finally', 'lifting', 'veil', 'real', 'mystery', 'horror', 'survivors', 'conditions', 'struggle', 'remain', 'alive', 'survivors', 'are', 'just', 'human', 'beings', 'constantly', 'have', 'fight', 'radioactive', 'illness', 'know', 'how', 'futile', 'useless', 'such', 'struggle', 'Second', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'historical', 'reach', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1983', 'shock-wave', 'media', 'public', 'opinion', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'made', 'headlines', 'newspapers', 'back', 'then', 'People', 'talked', 'fear', 'heart', 'mind', 'certainly', 'played', 'great', 'role', 'making', 'people', 'accutely', 'aware', 'end', 'results', 'nuclear', 'conflict', 'most', 'had', 'never', 'questioned', 'necessity', 'then', 'have', 'doubt', 'movie', 'led', 'greater', 'level', 'awareness', 'subject', 'West', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'negotiating', 'non-proliferation', 'nuclear', 'WMD', 'treaties', 'US', 'Russia', '80', 'early', ""90's.A"", 'must-see', 'movie', 'what', 'nukes', 'can', 'do', 'conditions', 'would', 'leave', 'species', 'ever', 'take', 'skies']",N/A

The acting is well done and the special effects were great for an early 80's television movie.Fast forward to the present day.

The effects of radiation are drastically underplayed, the effects of nuclear blasts on cities was also completely wrong--one just needs to see photos of Hiroshima to see that--and most of the characters should've been dead long before the ending.  It could've been a good film, but it focuses too much on characterization, undermines the concept of nuclear war and the chances of survival, as well as the long term side-effects on the environment, and leaves lots of loose ends in relation to many characters.  Radiation sickness has a variety of classic symptoms, it's surprising they went so far to omit them, probably because they'd be unpleasant to a television audience.  The actors attempt to do a good job with a bad script, but if one wants realism of nuclear war, the Day After is not a good choice.  While the closest thing to filmed realism of a nuclear explosion was probably Terminator 2, a 1984 animated feature called &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; is probably the best example of realism, far surpassing The Day After.",3,Where's the realism?,977529600,"12 23, 2000",2000,1134,"['When', 'first', 'aired', 'claimed', 'be', 'realistic', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'effects', 'radiation', 'are', 'drastically', 'underplayed', 'effects', 'nuclear', 'blasts', 'cities', 'was', 'also', 'completely', 'wrong', 'one', 'just', 'see', 'photos', 'Hiroshima', 'see', 'most', 'characters', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dead', 'long', 'ending', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'characterization', 'concept', 'nuclear', 'war', 'chances', 'survival', 'as', 'well', 'long', 'term', 'side-effects', 'environment', 'lots', 'loose', 'ends', 'relation', 'many', 'characters', 'Radiation', 'sickness', 'variety', 'classic', 'symptoms', 'surprising', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'omit', 'probably', ""'d"", 'be', 'unpleasant', 'television', 'audience', 'actors', 'attempt', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'bad', 'script', 'one', 'realism', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Day', 'not', 'good', 'choice', 'closest', 'thing', 'filmed', 'realism', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'was', 'probably', 'Terminator', '2', '1984', 'animated', 'feature', 'called', 'quot', 'When', 'Wind', 'Blows', 'quot', 'probably', 'best', 'example', 'realism', 'far', 'surpassing', 'Day']",N/A
