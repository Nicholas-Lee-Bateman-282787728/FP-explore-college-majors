1434249,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B004Z2PLZS,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","As the Alien(s) films taught us, the best horror comes from suspense, as in slowly and gradually introducing the viewer to the bad guy/killer/antagonist.  Any movie that goes for horror/suspense effect is well advised to understand the brilliance of this approach.  Unfortunately, Scream of the Banshee did not do so.  The movie started out great, and definitely built both intrigue and suspense, but then quickly devolved into a low quality horror.  We're presented with the banshee in its entirety way too early and this completely removes any future scare value.  Further, the banshee is a costumes/FX experiment gone bad; frankly, the banshee is more ridiculously funny than it is scary, further reducing the scare impact.  On the other perspective, you won't necessarily hate yourself for renting this film.  While the horror is low-impact and the banshee more funny than scary, the other production values (e.g., camerawork, photography, lighting, acting, etc.) are pretty decent, enough so that I'm quite disappointed it wasn't more effective of a story.  Lastly, for fans of Lance Henriksen (he is a great b horror staple), his screen time is very limited.Overall, ok rental, but buyer beware.",2,Mildly entertaining,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1201,"['Alien', 's', 'films', 'taught', 'best', 'horror', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'gradually', 'introducing', 'viewer', 'bad', 'guy/killer/antagonist', 'movie', 'horror/suspense', 'effect', 'well', 'advised', 'understand', 'brilliance', 'approach', 'Unfortunately', 'Scream', 'Banshee', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'definitely', 'built', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'then', 'quickly', 'devolved', 'low', 'quality', 'horror', ""'re"", 'presented', 'banshee', 'entirety', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'completely', 'future', 'scare', 'value', 'Further', 'banshee', 'costumes/FX', 'experiment', 'gone', 'bad', 'frankly', 'banshee', 'more', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'scary', 'further', 'reducing', 'scare', 'impact', 'other', 'perspective', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'hate', 'renting', 'film', 'horror', 'low-impact', 'banshee', 'more', 'funny', 'scary', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'e.g.', 'camerawork', 'photography', 'lighting', 'acting', 'etc', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'enough', ""'m"", 'quite', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'effective', 'story', 'Lastly', 'fans', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'great', 'b', 'horror', 'staple', 'screen', 'time', 'very', 'limited.Overall', 'ok', 'rental', 'buyer', 'beware']",Scream of the Banshee

Go figure.The story is simplicity itself, after a brief history lesson on the original containment of the Banshee, we are unceremoniously dumped in the present to spend time with an archeology professor (Lauren Holly) and two of her students.  A little banter, a gauntlet from an unknown admirer, a daughter with a penchant for knocking down weeping walls, and we are led to box number two: a box within a box.  It's a fancy box but not a hat box, it's a head box.  Heads being what they are, it screams and explodes.  Something nasty happens in a restroom.  Nightmares all around (LSD is suggested as a possible reason), and they are led on a merry chase to find Broderick Duncan (Lance Henriksen, in one of his more incomprehensible roles; I blame it on the writer).  Why he needed to be involved is anyone's guess as they already possessed everything required to take a Banshee down.The movie is adequate in what it set out to do.  The body count is quite low, a minor disappointment, I blame the Banshee who was definitely shirking her duties.  (I have high expectations when it comes to Banshees.)  The acting was professional (which doesn't automatically equate with good).  I didn't mind the creature design, I've seen worse.Can't really explain why I'm keeping it but I am.

1434252,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B004Z2PLZS,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 0]","By the production title, the story itself is not based on a book nor a remake of anything else. That doesn't mean it can't be based (no matter how loosely) on some kind of familiar mythology. In this case, the modern thought of banshees, screaming old hags that aren't exactly human.It starts with a prologue back in Limerick City, Ireland, not long before the 13th century (not the catchiest way of trying to do something differently than most horror movies trying to take place in the 13th), three knights sent off to catch a banshee, and the device used almost looks like a strange shield, but turns out to be a different kind of device than I'm used to seeing. Then, in modern times, a research group for a university ends up finding out a secret within their walls and discovers a box to go along with a mysterious gauntlet (that the nerd in the group loves playing with- who wouldn't ;). Opening the box releases an evil that can infect (okay, that's definitely not original and one reason I didn't get this movie for quite a long while, the typical-sounding cliche) and cause hallucinations. Unfortunately, the effects team tried too hard to make effective scares, causing the effects to be laughable unless you get scared by crappy costumes. Albeit, there were a couple emotional scenes that weren't perfect, but fit better in this story than much of the horror. And yet, there were a couple horror scenes that were actually decent. One involving many gallons of lood being poured onto the head researcher's daughter during a hallucination, and it got me wondering if she were going to die. Not saying if she did. And another woman's horrific scene, she didn't get to learn the secret of the banshee's scream, so she did die, quite horrifically, if you ask me. Also, not to forget, the sound editing for the soundtrack in the film seemed sloppy in a couple scenes (one of which had an abrupt cut-off rather than a decent transition to the next, that was rather dissappointing), and a continuity mistake in the middle was off-putting for me.Not only is there the typical releasing evil upon others by accident, there's the typical conspiracy-of-sorts by a loony bin of a failed proffesor. Who's also extremely paranoid and definitely didn't get under my skin like Jigsaw could in any of the SAW films.Aside from the horror, there's the couple substories, one dealing with two of the researchers falling for each other. The other deals with the head researcher and her daughter, physically close, though emotionally distant and daughter feeling like mom's pushing her farther and farther away and hinting what happened to the father (you never get the full story).Not everything is explained through the story (some of it's good enough to not need entire explanations, others could use further backstory elements), too many cheap special effects shots to enjoy thoroughly, quite frequent cliches throughout... Truly, the only originality in this film is that it's the first horror film centered around banshees, otherwise, there's a lot of unoriginality here.Then again, it is from Syfy, which went downhill several years ago after they changed the spelling of their name to fit mainstream thought. I feel that if they would've stuck with their original style-rather than change at all-this would have been a better movie.",3,Could've used some more work,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,3328,"['production', 'title', 'story', 'not', 'based', 'book', 'remake', 'anything', 'else', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'based', 'matter', 'how', 'loosely', 'kind', 'familiar', 'mythology', 'case', 'modern', 'thought', 'banshees', 'screaming', 'old', 'hags', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'human.It', 'starts', 'prologue', 'back', 'Limerick', 'City', 'Ireland', 'not', 'long', '13th', 'century', 'not', 'catchiest', 'way', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'differently', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'trying', 'take', 'place', '13th', 'three', 'knights', 'sent', 'off', 'catch', 'banshee', 'device', 'used', 'almost', 'strange', 'shield', 'out', 'be', 'different', 'kind', 'device', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Then', 'modern', 'times', 'research', 'group', 'university', 'up', 'finding', 'out', 'secret', 'walls', 'box', 'go', 'along', 'mysterious', 'gauntlet', 'nerd', 'group', 'playing', 'with-', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'Opening', 'box', 'evil', 'can', 'infect', 'okay', 'definitely', 'not', 'original', 'one', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'quite', 'long', 'while', 'typical-sounding', 'cliche', 'cause', 'hallucinations', 'Unfortunately', 'effects', 'team', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'effective', 'scares', 'causing', 'effects', 'be', 'laughable', 'get', 'scared', 'crappy', 'costumes', 'Albeit', 'were', 'couple', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fit', 'better', 'story', 'much', 'horror', 'yet', 'were', 'couple', 'horror', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'decent', 'One', 'involving', 'many', 'gallons', 'lood', 'being', 'poured', 'head', 'researcher', 'daughter', 'hallucination', 'got', 'wondering', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'Not', 'saying', 'did', 'woman', 'horrific', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'learn', 'secret', 'banshee', 'scream', 'did', 'die', 'quite', 'horrifically', 'ask', 'Also', 'not', 'forget', 'sound', 'editing', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'seemed', 'sloppy', 'couple', 'scenes', 'one', 'had', 'abrupt', 'cut-off', 'rather', 'decent', 'transition', 'next', 'was', 'rather', 'dissappointing', 'continuity', 'mistake', 'middle', 'was', 'off-putting', 'me.Not', 'only', 'there', 'typical', 'releasing', 'evil', 'others', 'accident', 'typical', 'conspiracy-of-sorts', 'loony', 'bin', 'failed', 'proffesor', 'Who', 'also', 'extremely', 'paranoid', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'skin', 'Jigsaw', 'could', 'SAW', 'films.Aside', 'horror', 'couple', 'substories', 'one', 'dealing', 'two', 'researchers', 'falling', 'other', 'other', 'deals', 'head', 'researcher', 'daughter', 'physically', 'close', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'daughter', 'feeling', 'mom', 'pushing', 'farther', 'farther', 'away', 'hinting', 'what', 'happened', 'father', 'never', 'get', 'full', 'story', '.Not', 'everything', 'explained', 'story', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'need', 'entire', 'explanations', 'others', 'could', 'use', 'further', 'backstory', 'elements', 'too', 'many', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'quite', 'frequent', 'cliches', 'Truly', 'only', 'originality', 'film', 'first', 'horror', 'film', 'centered', 'banshees', 'otherwise', 'lot', 'unoriginality', 'here.Then', 'again', 'Syfy', 'went', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'changed', 'spelling', 'name', 'fit', 'mainstream', 'thought', 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'original', 'style-rather', 'change', 'all-this', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie']",Scream of the Banshee

1434254,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004Z2PLZS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 13]","I won't contend that ""Scream of the Banshee"" is a terrible movie, only that in the horror realm--it lacks anything to really distinguish it from dozens of other films in an overcrowded genre.  Taking on a bit of Irish lore and unleashing the myth of the banshee upon a modern world seems like a solid enough concept.  But aside from that scream, the banshee might as well have been a ghost or demon or nightmare boogeyman for it has no real consistent mode of terror.  Sometimes it works in your mind driving you to insanity, sometimes it attacks you like a haggard Freddy Kreuger making your dreams a dangerous place, sometimes it is entirely corporeal wreaking havoc in a physical manifestation.  The whole thing just seems ill conceived and only moderately thought out.  The logic derives from the fact that if you hear the scream, it will kill you--after that, the movie makers tend to adopt an anything goes mentality.  That might be forgiven if, again, the kills had a creativity or innovation that seemed fresh.  But you've seen this movie before in various forms with various beasts, and there's just not much new here.Headed by Lauren Holly, a team of academics uncover a mysterious box in the school's archives.  It has been brought to their attention by a former scholar who seems to have bought a one way ticket to crazy-ville (an underutilized Lance Henrickson).  The banshee reveal is the film's biggest moment and its first cry after being released has a pleasingly eerie effectiveness.  However, from here on out--the picture plays out precisely as you would expect.  Anyone exposed to the initial scream or a recording of it are dispatched in an entirely random order in entirely random methods.  Is it real, is it a hallucination, is it both concurrently?  In truth, it really doesn't matter.  The final confrontation will bring the survivors together and, in reality, is a bit of an anticlimax.Holly, who I like at times, has little to work with here.  As the film spends little time investing in its characters, it's hard to muster much concern about who dies or lives.  The film feels so generic and familiar in the long run, I just wished something (anything) would have connected more vividly.  I didn't hate ""Scream of the Banshee""--it might be pleasant enough for a singular viewing.  I doubt, however, it will inspire many to recommend it as must-see entertainment.  Passable, if unimaginative, addition to the horror film canon that is easy to watch but just as easy to forget.

1434255,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004Z2PLZS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Many have talked about the fact that the Sy Fy channel makes terrible movies to run on their station. Usually it's some form of giant predatory snake, lizard, crocodile/alligator or dragon gone wild or pumped full of experimental drugs. With a touch of incredibly poor CGI effects, these movies are pumped out faster than the old AIP horror films.On rare occasions Sy Fy delves into movies of another kind as well. Their takes on horror have created a new low in that genre, the results of which offer movies whose special effects budgets (incredibly low at best) are better than what they spent on the script. Pick up a few genre actors looking for a quick check or an actor down on their luck when it comes to hot prospects and BAM, you have a Sy Fy original.SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE is one such flick. A part of the After Dark series (which while many bad mouth I've found to offer good and bad movies), the film concerns archeology professor Isla Whelan (Lauren Holly) and two of her students are in the midst of organized and recording a ton of artifacts located in the bowels of the university they're in. One recent acquisition delivered to Isla is an ancient metal glove that we saw a knight wearing at the start of the film when he and several other nights took on some creature in a flowing red gown.As they look over the item they're led to a secret room which holds a box hidden away some time previously. Being the smart college group that they are, they realize the glove is a key of sorts that opens the box. Hoping to find some serious treasure, they are rewarded only with a rotting head instead. After Isla leaves the 2 students behind for a bit, the head's mouth opens and releases a terrible scream that causes their ears to bleed as well as Isla's and the guard in the building. What they have done is unleash the banshee, trapped within the box for centuries and now free to do harm.Follow ups with several other clues lead the group to discover that there was a professor prior to them that had found the box and was searching for the glove. This professor (played by Frank Henriksen for perhaps a total of 9 minutes on screen) had the box taken from him by a student assistant, the one responsible for placing it in the wall. Henriksen's search for these items eventually drove him mad. Now it seems that the banshee wants to wreak havoc once again on an unsuspecting world and all that stands in the way are a professor and 2 students.A few other subplots are tossed in that no one cares about. Isla's daughter going through the usual teen difficulty of a mother that doesn't understand her and that she can't relate to. The assistants are fond of one another yet for some reason don't let on through most of the film. It's extras like these that round out the script or as I tend to consider it, pad out the script so a 30 minute movie lasts a near unbearable 90 minutes.What is most upsetting is seeing recognizable actors doing films like this. With Henriksen I can understand as he's done it more than once and most likely to make a quick paycheck. At 71 years old he's at the end of his career and probably wanting to leave something behind for his family. But Lauren Holly? This incredibly attractive actress has resorted to roles that were meant for women far younger. And if not, then the characters should be more concerned for their positions and such rather than how attractive they are. Holly looks good, but come on, how many professors make an attempt to dress with shirts unbuttoned enough to allow their students a life lesson they should have learned in the back seat of a Chevy while in high school. I for one would much rather see Holly playing characters her age and looking her age. To do otherwise is to assume that women over 40 can't be attractive on their own without the help of modern medicine or without doffing their clothes when the chance presents itself.On the whole this film leaves little to make it worthwhile. There are no scares with the exceptions of the expected jump scenes, those scenes where things are quiet and suddenly something jumps up accompanied by a loud and piercing sound effect of music at such a decibel that your ears bleed much as the characters in this film.

Production values are more direct-to-DVD level and the performances far below expectations.  Maybe the SyFy channel is focusing more on quantity rather than quality.The premise of the Irish banshee folklore has possibilities but a poorly written script and weak performances result in a sloppy execution.  Lauren Holly seems totally disinterested in her role as does the venerable Lance Henriksen who seems to do anything for a paycheck.  The lesser known actors are just awful.  There are a couple of jolts in the movie but nothing truly terrifying.  Also the sound mixing is terrible.  The sound effects blare out even making the banshee's scream more annoying than frightening and the dialogue obnoxiously soft.  Keep your remote handy.Hopefully After Dark originals coming up (AREA 51 and THE TASK) are better than this misfire.,2,SCREAM IS MERELY A WHIMPER,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,954,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'entries', 'AFTER', 'DARK', 'ORIGINALS', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'SCREAM', 'THE', 'BANSHEE', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'more', 'direct-to-DVD', 'level', 'performances', 'far', 'expectations', 'Maybe', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'focusing', 'more', 'quantity', 'rather', 'quality.The', 'premise', 'Irish', 'banshee', 'folklore', 'possibilities', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'weak', 'performances', 'result', 'sloppy', 'execution', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'totally', 'disinterested', 'role', 'venerable', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'who', 'do', 'anything', 'paycheck', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'are', 'couple', 'jolts', 'movie', 'nothing', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'Also', 'sound', 'mixing', 'terrible', 'sound', 'effects', 'blare', 'out', 'even', 'making', 'banshee', 'scream', 'more', 'annoying', 'frightening', 'dialogue', 'obnoxiously', 'soft', 'Keep', 'remote', 'handy.Hopefully', 'Dark', 'originals', 'coming', 'up', 'AREA', '51', 'THE', 'TASK', 'are', 'better', 'misfire']",Scream of the Banshee

Featuring a non-sensical plot involving a group of students and a recently dug-up evil banshee that is all the more hard to make sense of thanks to the fact that there appears to be problems with the boom-mic picking up the dialogue (either that or the actors talk so soft that you will be reaching for your remote A LOT), to the fact that said actors involved (most notably Lauren Holly) seem so disinterested in the proceedings that they're practically asleep in front of the camera.  Genre stalwart Lance Henriksen appears briefly as a bat-crazy one time scholar, and is the only thing in Scream of the Banshee that does anything worthwhile.

In 'Scream of the Banshee,"" she's never on the screen, and her name does not appear in the opening or end credits (and Amazon does not list her in the credits above). I don't know about the cutting room floor, but I'm betting Hale was never connected in any way with this production.As for this movie, it's not the worst I've seen and unfortunately seems fairly typical for what passes today for horror movies.  The high point would be Lauren Holly, who looks damned good and does as well as can be expected with the erratic material.  The low point would be Lance Henriksen, who does as badly as possible with the equally bad material he's given to work with.

She is dressed in white with a long flowing red cape. The color contrast is excellent. They managed to skewer the woman, who falls off her horse. The men move closer, and to my surprise she arises and they begin combat. One of the knights uses a special box to entrap the banshee, one with special markings, like a large ""Hellraiser"" puzzle box. At this point I am hooked as the movie shifts to modern times.A college professor (Lauren Holly) and her students are at work cataloging items when they come across the box and try to decipher the markings. At this point the plot isn't tough to figure out. They open the box, the banshee screams, all who hear it must die, starting with the black guy. yadda yadda yadda. Eventually someone figures out how to get the genii back in the bottle and it is just a matter of who lives, who dies, the peripheral subplots, and special effects that either make or break the movie.The attacks are a combination of real and psychological, so you never know what is happening. The professor gets stabbed by the banshee, but doesn't die as it wasn't ""real"" but has marks from the attack, which BTW are not in the same alignment (the blades marks are perpendicular) as the weapon that caused them.The acting was so-so. Marcelle Baer, who played Lauren Holly's daughter was Kristen Stewart bad and perhaps the worst in the lot.
