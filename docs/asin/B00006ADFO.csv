708817,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00006ADFO,Alex Udvary,"[12, 15]","""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is a crude, vulgar, at times I guess it can be described as an offensive movie. In other words it's a guy's movie lol. There's something inside me saying, it's wrong for me to like this movie. This is not a ""great"" movie. I know I've seen much better movies. I consider myself a filmbuff and have seen several American classics and well as several foreign films. But, still, for some reason, despite myself, I like this movie. Then again I always seem to go for movies like this. I like the ""American Pie"" films. I liked the first ""Scary Movie"". So there is a side of me that enjoys vulgar humor.""40 Days and 40 Nights"" as most people know is about a guy named Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) taking a vow of celibacy for the lenght the title says. He does this because as a friend tells him ""(He's) packed with issues!"" He can't seem to get over his girfriend. Every other person he is with he compares to his ex, Nicole (Vinesse Shaw). But, the odd thing is, his way of trying to deal with this problem is by sleeping with them. So, he decides if he can get his mind off sex all of his problems will go away and he'll forget about his ex. But, he meets a girl, Erica (Shannyn Sossamon). Who just further tempts him and makes things worst for him.One of the reasons I like ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is that it seems to have something to say about teen dating and the importance people (of any age) have placed on sex. The film shows how that seems to be the main thing on both guys and girls mind's. There was a line in the movie that Erica gives ""God!Why won't he just sleep with me!"" That one line is a key line to the film. Teens and other people sometimes refer to sex as merely a casual act. Something you wouldn't even give a second thought too. I could if I want go into a whole moral issues here like, you know there was a time when people actually waited to become intimate after they were married, but, I won't. This is a modern world, with a new set of standards, no matter how bad they may be. But, one of the problems with the film is, after it lightly touches these ideas it stops!Is this a movie everyone will enjoy? No. This is purely a ""teen movie"" If adults saw this they would just think to themselves ""Is this the way MY kids are!? That's it, they're not going out for a whole year!"" But, teens will like it, and who knows, if a couple goes to see this, it may even open a door to discuss what each of them thinks about sex. And plus girls will just like staring at Hartnett, so it no lost for them either.Bottom-line: A good funny ""teen movie"" that actually does have something to say.

It's about a guy who makes the ultimate sacrifice to forego sex or anything related to sex for the duration of Lent (40 days).  This started as a way for Matt (Josh Hartnett) to rid himself of his nightmares and sexual claustrophobia as he has ""meaningless"" sex with other women after he got dumped by his girlfriend.  The office gets wind of this peculiar act, or non-act, and decides that it's worth betting on.  In the course of not having sex, he meets a girl he falls in love with even without physically knowing her.  Things just get tougher when people have money at stake and want him to fail, so there are many temptations along the way.  Whether he makes it or not, you'll have to watch the film (or e-mail me) to find out.It's not a laugh-out-loud type of comedy.

708819,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006ADFO,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Ok, I'm going to be VERY honest here.  The only reason I sat through this entire film was because, after seeing her in `A Knights Tale', I became obsessed with Shannyn Sossamon.  She is nearly the perfect woman (OMG she is so hot) and so I'd watch her in anything.  This film is sadly beneath her.  The script is rather nonsensical (but most of these teen sex comedies are), but what makes it worse is that it doesn't really deliver on the `stupid funny' side of things either.  I actually found most of this film rather ridiculous to the point where it was irritating.  The concept of the film had promise, and it does at times make a point with regard to the differences between male and female interpretations of their own sexual needs, but overall the film remains very low-brow and somewhat ignorant of it's own message.  This film just serves as an excuse for horny guys to make a lot of sex jokes and wantonly look at barely clothed (sometimes not clothed at all) women.  Hey, I'm all for that as long as the film is funny.  This one isn't.  It isn't funny and it isn't smart.  Hartnett has talent and I have always liked him as an actor, so he sold me on his character despite the many holes presented by the script.  Still, the only reason to see this is for Sossamon.

Josh Hartnett once again proves that he can't act. He just has zero ability to act. The script is mindlessly puerile, and the male characters plain suck. I get so tired of this guy's lame sideburns. I feel like I want to jump into the picture and hold him down while I use a razor blade to straighten it up. Meanwhile, the topic of the movie isn't interesting for me, but watching it go down is as bad as watching grass to grow. I notice that there aren't any black people in the movie. I mean, I see probably all naked women that were white. No blacks. No Asians. In fact, there is just really nothing outside of the circle. That makes me to wonder if the blacks are ugly to the audience. There isn't any comedy found in 40 Days and 40 Nights. Another thing that makes 40 Days and 40 Nights to crumble is the characters that keep getting dropped like flies. So, it's hard to identify who's who. Clearly, 40 Days and 40 Nights is a candidate for workplace sexual harassment. There are so many lame moments, but one certainly tops them all: the parents talking about sex in front of their grown kids, even his son training for priesthood. I mean, how bizarre is that?

And hopefully the last. The difference with this movie is that it's neither sexy or funny. It's just downright embarresssing and almost unwatchable.Following breaking up with his girlfriend Matt Sullivan (Josh Harnett) decided promiscuity was  the way to ease his pain, but for some reason he chooses to go further and give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights (Why?): No touching, no kissing, no nibbling, no foreplay, no fooling around, no self gratification (NOT EVEN THAT?! Crikey, you'd go mad!). But during his period of abstinence Matt meets the girl of his dreams, which makes things harder for him (literally as well as figuratively). It's harder for the viewer to sit through this movie. I think another reason for the movie's title could be that trying to watch it the movie seems to last 40 days and 40 nights instead of 100 minutes. Just awful.Who keeps letting movies like this get made?

Well, he has proven me to be wrong! Shannyn Sossamon was equally great as his beautiful (though slightly offbeat) love interest. She definitely steals every scene she's in!Among the things I disliked about this movie was the totally unsympathetic character of Hartnett's roommate (""portrayed"" by the unsympathetic Paolo Costanzo who also managed to be the only negative thing I can recall about ""Road Trip""). Maybe I just don't like Costanzo...sorry!""40 Days..."" main problem though is that the romance between Hartnett and Sossamon loses credibility since it never really gets time to develop. They meet twice in this laundromat and suddenly they're in love. In my opinion the writers should have given their two leading characters more time (and scenes together) to connect.

708835,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00006ADFO,D. Litton,"[1, 3]","No, religious purists: ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is not a Biblical film, nor does it carry moral value. What it does have tucked under its sleeve is a wonderful brand of comedy that's a step up from such atrocities as ""Slackers,"" stemming from the situations of its main characters, played to perfection by an actor who throws himself into the role without hesitation.Think of it as ""American Pie"" in reverse: Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) has just broken up with his longtime girlfriend, Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), leading him to explore various sexual partners, all of which he finds himself comparing to his ex. He sneaks out of a lover's window while she steps into the bathroom; he ""fakes it"" when paired with a demanding, knows-what-she-wants aggressor; in his mind's eye, he sees his ceiling cracking open into a giant, black hole, a hole he considers his inner emptiness (it's goofy, but it provides a nice laugh).And then, one day, the answer hits him. After paying a visit to his brother, John (Adam Trese), a whose experience in seminary aide him in advising his sibling, Matt swears off sexual practices ranging from the whole nine yards to self gratification, his relinquishment for the season of Lent.At first, all seems to go well: he begins building model cars, throws out his magazines, videos, lubricants, etc, and crosses paths with a well-to-do girl, Erica (Shannyn Sossamon, ""A Knight's Tale""), in whom he finds a connection beyond the physical attraction that dominated his past flings. Of course, things go haywire when his work colleagues develop a web page featuring a bidding system on which day he will break down and ""do it,"" throwing his life out in the open with hilarious results.None of this would work if not for Hartnett's ability to throw caution to the wind and make us believe in the humor and embarrassment of Matt's situations. He does well in portraying his character as a normal, sexually healthy male with confidence and ego to boot, and then one-ups himself in his latter performance as a timid, nervous wreck whose every move triggers one calamity after another.Take, for instance, his confrontation with the slim lovelies he works with, one of whom Xeroxes a photocopy of her posterior with her phone number and offers him a good time. Two others, bound to restore ""the power"" to the female gender, begin making out in front of him, while the rest of the office waits outside for the results. And then there's his sex-starved boss, who accidentally downs a glass of orange juiced spiked with Viagra meant for Matt. Such situations aren't as risqu&eacute; as some of the more low-brow comedies we've seen populating theaters in the past, but gross doesn't always mean more laughs, and here, it's a bit of a relief to see a small level of taste put to good use.The trailers for ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" have made it abundantly clear that the movie is from the producers of ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" and while it lacks the charisma of that previous movie's British appeal, it provides an hour and a half of hearty laughs at it's main character's expense.

An anti-arabic phrase is used, a the female lead has a stupid conversation with her roommate ""He's treating me with consideration, like an equal."" ""Kinda sucks, doesn't it?"" ""Yeah, it sucks."" WTF? I'm not uber-feminist, but the entire movie seemed to be a religious, pro-abstinence, idiotic farce. It had some thinly veiled misogynistic messages, although they were against society's grain of misogyny. It's humor was strained and threadbare. It lacked any real insight into people or relationships. It had a catholic priest making out with a nun. What purpose did that scene really serve? This movie presupposes that everyone is an idiot. I really am left without much comprehensible to say. A big disappointment for the careers of Hartnett and Sossaman.Pointless.Absurd.Borderline Offensive.Juvenile.That about sums it up.In related news, Maggie Gyllenhaal, an excellent actress, played a lackluster supporting role in this movie. She shined as best as she could, but got mired in the absurd script.I had this DVD sitting around and felt recently encouraged due to the enormous success with ""chick movies"" I felt with ""He's just not that into you"". Which is an actual movie, not a piece of crap hiding in a genre. This movie's a big pass.

Josh Hartnett became a very hot property after ""Pearl Harbor"" so it was inevitable that he would get the lead in a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, it isn't a very good one.  The screenplay is a typically sex-obsessed teen flick with twenty-something characters.Matt (Hartnett) is trying to get over his ex-girlfriend Nicole (Vinessa Shaw) by having sex with every woman he meets.  When it dawns on him that this is superficial and fraught with anxiety, he decides to give up sex for lent.  Of course, as soon as he makes &quot;The Vow&quot;, he meets his dream girl Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) and he spends much of the ensuing time trying to come up with reasons not to have sex with her.  Meanwhile, his co-workers and half the internet have a pool on what day he will give in.  The comedy is mostly puerile, though there are a few funny lines sprinkled here and there.Director Michael Lehmann has plenty of experience with vacuous comedy, having directed ""Heathers"" and ""Airheads"".  He has done better on TV with ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and ""The West Wing"".  Lehmann keeps it light, but the material is just too jejune for him to do much.  To his credit, the cast seemed to be having fun with it.Josh Hartnett is an excellent dramatic actor.  However, as a buffoon he is just not that funny.  His true skills emerge in the romantic scenes with Shannyn Sossamon where his sincerity shines through.  Hartnett and Sossamon have terrific chemistry.  There is a very sensitive and endearing quality about their scenes together.  Sossamon is a bright young talent who might do well with the right scripts.  She is lovely and engaging with good acting ability.  Paul Costanzo provides much of the best comedy as Matt's sexually fixated roommate.This isn't a terrible comedy, but it is rather immature considering the age of the characters and the target audience.

I had a slight-chuckle somewhere, but the rest of the film was so bland that I truthfully can't even remember it.It's contains nothing but attempts at sex-related humour with the occasional nudity. Matt (Josh Hartnett) is an overly-aroused guy who gets with woman after woman. Because of his loss of an ex-girlfriend, he eventually decided that celibacy is something he should try and see if that helps him forget her somehow. So, for 40 days and nights, he vows to have no sex -- including masturbation. He puts away all of his porno stash (doesn't get rid of it, though) and tries to focus on other activities. It's working well for a while. Yet his buddies think he's going insane because a man just doesn't do what he's trying to do and are betting that he won't last. The even set up a website to track it all and women are trying to trick Matt to give-in so they can win the money.He meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) in the laundromat and seems to genuinely like her for who she is. Yet she's fully-boring and is a perfect match for Hartnett's character since she seems to only want sex, too. However, he wants to wait because his vow was important to him. The characters are horrible together. Now, if there really was a story and any character development, and he really wanted to change his ways, he should be searching for someone who was not seeking sex right away. This is just a brainless sex 'comedy', though, so what takes place in it is to be expected.SPOILERS: It ends with Matt being cuffed by both wrists to his bed by his roommate who then leaves with a girl for the evening. Why that happened, I'm not fully sure, but he told his buddy to leave the door to the apartment ajar so that Erica could get in at midnight. That's when the vow's time would be over and he was going to make-it with her. Well, the ex shows up earlier and has sex with Matt who apparently was able to sleep through it all (riiiigght). If he really was that out-of-it, she would have been guilty of raping the man. Many of the reviews says here that the ex raped him, but it doesn't seem like that. Matt wasn't fighting anything, wasn't drugged, was enjoying it and knew what was happening. It was a few minutes before the end of the final day, so he lost his vow of celibacy. That ex evidently won a lot of money since everyone was betting that Matt wouldn't make it all the way and she placed the final bet.Erica shows up and meets with the ex who's leaving Matt's apartment. Erica finds Matt handcuffed to the bed, hears him say that he was asleep...while he THEN proceeds to admit that he thought it was her that he was having relations with. He didn't look at all to see who was there? Stupid! Eventually, she doesn't care and forgives him after he gives some lame apologies (which show again that he knew he was having sex with his ex)...he and her have sex for the first time and are in the bedroom for a day or more...and nobody in the audience really cares. Did his celibacy mean anything? Is he now going to be a one-woman-man? We don't know and it's pointless. Also, it's lame, like in most any movie and in life, when folks meet and are having sex after they know nothing about each other.Here's a worthless, unfunny, insulting-to-men flick which has a core-idea that 'all men only think about sex all the time and it's the only thing they feel a woman is good for'. A guy who's like that isn't a respectable man at all but just a lustful jerk.I just saw this for the heck of it today on a VHS tape that I bought years ago somewhere for maybe 50c. I can't believe the sticker on it was $12.99 and that someone spent that amount on this pre-viewed dreck at BLOCKBUSTER back in the day. Ugh. I just chucked this thing in the garbage tonight and, in-line with the Biblical title, it'll be returning to dust (though that will take much-longer than 40 days and nights).

I figured she was there for Josh and the film would essentially be a vessel to appeal to the teenage-girl market. However the film pleasantly surprised me; it was witty, not overly gross and Josh Hartnett possessed comic poise.The film's premise is really quite simple, Matt (Hartnett), a man whose been living a fairly vacuous life filled with romantic disappointment and meaningless sex decides the only way to get over his ex Nicole is to become celibate for a period of 40 days, coinciding with lent. However this proves to be very difficult as Matt falls for Erica (Shannon Sossamon) at the Laundromat. Compounded with this is every woman trying to break his vow, and every man betting on the day he'll break his celibacy.What makes the film so funny is the series of ridiculous situations Matt finds himself in. Whilst this film is essentially one 90 minute long sex joke, it really does work. Unlike other teenpics ('American Pie', 'Road Trip') '40 days and 40 nights' has a slightly more classy approach to sex. Shock value is used at a bare minimum, and when it is it's pretty much unneeded. It is only these few moments that makes the film fall into cliched realms at times, but it is otherwise good.Josh Hartnett is truly funny in this film. His embodiment of the slow demise of a man who is kept from sex is very funny. It was a gamble to do comedy for a man who is known for two epic war films ('Pearl Harbor', and 'Black Hawk Down'). Everyone must agree that the movement from war films to comedy is like mixing oil and water; but it works seamlessly.  Other than Josh the supporting cast are all very funny, the betting scenes in particular are hilarious.'40 days and 40 nights' is a very welcome and impressive film. Slightly more intelligent that the standard teenpic, but not intelligent enough to stop it being escapist, essentially low brow comedy. This is not only a base teenpic comedy, but also a romantic comedy.

So to get his life back on track, he decided to give up sex for Lent, and that includes no bodily intimacy of any kind with women.  Unfortunately, he meets this incredible girl name Erica, and it becomes a test of will power for him to finish what he started.For a movie that deals with sex and is very bold about it, expect a lot of jokes and dialogues surrounding that topic.  Mix it up with some physical comedies and a great deal with sexual tension, that's pretty much what the film is about.  Josh Hartnett did a passable job as the lead, kind of a let down after his brilliant performance in Black Hawk Down.  Overall I got a few laughs from 40 Days & 40 Nights, but I thought the point of the movie (if there ever was one) sort of got lost towards the end.

Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[9, 12]","The plot of this movie has been described elsewhere, so I'll just get straight to my pros/cons in the movie.To me, it seemed like the person who wrote the script was not the same person who conceived it and began the project. Considering that this is a comedy-""romance"" marketed at teenagers, the plot is actually rather interesting. There are some good ideas, and occasionally the movie has a burst of humor.But then the rest of it is so chock-full of stupid ideas that I'm not sure what happened. It seems like any part of the script that attempted to say, ""Hey... sex ISN'T everything"" was erased and replaced by a lame joke.I give it 3 stars because some parts of it were actually funny, it is an interesting premise, and because the acting is actually all pretty good - even Josh Hartnett, of whom I'm always suspicious.But the way it switches it's message back and forth is irritating, and it seems to cheapen the point of the movie. Matt is supposed to be falling in love, yet they never seem to make a point of explaining what love is - in fact, the one time when they try to explain how Matt and Erica are in love is simply this: Erica can have an orgasm without Matt touching her.My biggest complaint, though, out of all of this... is that Erica is quite easily the absolute least understanding girlfriend character in the history of cinema. It seems like Matt can't do anything without her considering it an insult. The worst example of this is(Spoiler alert)when Matt is practically raped and Erica finds him in the aftermath, still bound to a bed. Instead of being sympathetic in the least, she accuses him of cheating and then storms away, leading to Matt's solemn attempts to ask for forgiveness.VIOLENT CONTENT - None.SEX/NUDITY CONTENT - Plenty. Toward the end, Matt has visions of naked breasts everywhere, and since the premise of the movie involves sex you can expect that there's a lot of talk about it.

Matt will give up sex for the 40 days and 40 nights of Lent.  He's not just giving up sex, he's going to give up all forms of sexual intimacy.  No kissing, no groping, nothing.  I don't know about anyone else, but that doesn't seem like much of a premise to me.  40 days is only a month, a week, and a couple of days.  That's not very long to go without sex.  Naturally, by the end of the movie Matt is about to turn into a quivering, raging lunatic....all from not having sex for 40 days.Be that as it may, I'll talk about the movie instead.  There are some funny moments, and there are some sweet moments, but as a whole, the movie did not quite live up to the expectation that I had for being funny.  We're not talking Oscar standard here, but this movie fell short (pun intended) of being good.  Early on during his 40 days of abstinence Matt is doing laundry on a friday night.  He meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) there and they start talking and begin a friendship.  They start dating, but nothing intimate.  Matt even freaks out and pulls back at an almost kiss.At the same time this is going on, at Matt's office his co-workers are having a betting pool on how long he can hold out from sex.  This spreads from a simple office pool to a web page about sex and Matt's sexual hiatus.  Did I mention that Erica's job is to search the internet for pornographic websites so that the sites can be blocked with software?  Naturally she discovers the site, freaks out, and this causes a rift between Matt and Erica.  For some reason, when they started getting closer, Matt couldn't tell Erica that he didn't want to have sex or even kiss in the first 40 days they knew each other.  Right.The movie wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good.  It was somewhat funny, maybe amusing is the better word.

Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life.Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?)However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she?Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from?Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness.

Though some of it must have been filmed in Vancouver or somewhere, for parts of it just rubbed me the wrong way (sorry).  In any case you all know the story how spurned by cruel, selfish Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), our hero Josh Hartnett decides to lay off all sex, even sex with himself, and all would have been fine except that he is surrounded by the biggest pig pack of friends I've ever seen in a movie, led by Paulo Costanzo who seems to be channelling Nixon here, Nixon at his most Machiavellian.  These friends make life miserable for Josh and I for one was appalled he didn't slam the door on all of them once his ordeals were finished.  With friends like Paulo Costanzo, who needs enemies?  Well, the movie just isn't as interesting as it thinks it is, and the sweat pouring from Josh's temples suggest a level of suffering that might have worked in Schindler's List (he fantasizes himself as Christ tempted in the desert, and a visual cue shows him as Christ crucified).  If it weren't so heavy-handed it might have been fun to watch him run the obstacle race to happiness, but I don't know, somewhere along the way it lost its fire.San Francisco also has more people of color than this film suggests--way more.  And it has people in it older than 29, even working people.  Here everyone is white and works for web companies who also hire a token Asian here and there.  It's bizarre.  The best thing in the movie is its stars, and even that has to be qualified by saying that for Josh Hartnett and Shannyn Sossamon, 40 Days and 40 Nights represented the peak of their careers, and everything they've done has been a disappointment commercially and critically since.

Unfortunately, once his roommate Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) finds out the deals this becomes the prefect opportunity to use the internet to get a pool going on how long Matt can, uh, last.Now, for the sake of argument we will assume that Matt has no discernable brain activity when he is asleep (despite scenes to the contrary), so that we can have the willing suspension of disbelief to go with the film's running gag that has the hero falling part as he goes longer and longer without relief.  In the real world this guy would be able to keep his vow and wake up without any major problems.  But writer Rob Perez and director Michael Lehmann (&quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;) want to milk this guy's discomfort for everything it is worth and, unfortunately, more.It dawned on me that this movie has is clearly bifurcated into the &quot;guy&quot; parts and the &quot;girl&quot; parts and the biggest problem with &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; is that the two halves do not fit together (as compared to &quot;50 First Dates,&quot; which overcomes a similar problem and combines comedy and sweetness).  Matt's friends and co-workers treat his vow as a joke and/or money making opportunity.  This allows for lots of jokes and some prosthetic humor that leads to the inevitable conclusion that all men are pigs.Where this film had potential was with the idea that Matt would have to date a woman without having sex, both before and after she finds out about THE VOW.  However, I find it hard to believe that finding out about such a thing would really be upsetting to a woman, especially if the guy knows how to handle a flower (and Matt really knows how to handle a flower; this film must have given lots of couples ideas for similar epsiodes of flower fun).  But if you stop and think about it the idea that a couple could have a good time on a date with sex or any form of physical contact has to be against just about everything Hollywood stands for (assuming, of course, they are in an upright position).I was planning on liking this 2002 comedy more, but then somebody bad does something really bad without consequences.  No comeuppance.  No joke at their expense.  No sense of outraged expressed by another character.  Nothing.  I was so ticked off by that turn of events that when the film cobbled together the requisite happy ending I was not really in the mood to enjoy it.  But the filmmakers do get props for coming up with a nice little gift as Matt's final act of contrition.Final Note:  &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; was certified for 11 year old in Sweden, 12 years old in the Netherlands and Portugal, 13 year olds in Spain, 14 years olds in Brazil and the cantons of Vaud and Geneva in Switzerland, 15 year olds in the United Kingdom, Finland and Norway, 16 year olds in Argentina and in the Swiss canon of Grisons.

Sure, it is kind of a silly movie, and yes, it sort of sets reality just off to the side, but come on, it is not meant to be taken seriously.Matt (Jose Hartnett) is a twenty-something guy who works for a web design company and is having trouble coming to terms with being dumped by his girlfriend.  It gets so bad that he starts to hallucinate when he is with other women.  So in a moment of divine inspiration he decides he will give up sex (even the alone kind) for lent, 40 days and 40 nights.  Shortly therafter in a chance encounter at a laundry mat he meets a girl named Erica (Shannyn Soosamon) who he finds irresistible.  The burning (maybe literally) question is can he keep his vow?  The odds aren't in his favor.This plot makes for some great situation comedy.  Hartnett does his best to play it straight.  I raised a brow at his choice for this role, but he pulls it off.  Paulo Costanzo is hillarious as Matt's roommate and the voice of promiscuity.  The director handles the whole film with a tongue-in-cheek stlye that fits the situation.Is this film for everyone?

708870,A228JH8V9Y700G,B00006ADFO,MortensOrchid,"[3, 4]","I picked up this movie just wanting some raunchy humor and some lite entertainment, but was absolutely positively shocked at an eerie parallel that it showed in my own life.  Years ago I was going out with the Matt character, who had a girlfriend (quite a while before he met me) named Nicole who dumped him, walked away and never spoke to him again.  I am not so vain and self centered to think that I was the ""girl of his dreams"", but I think I am a damned good woman.  He would not, could not stop talking about her.  He still sent her presents and letters, and told her that he would always be there for her.  When I asked him why he was doing this (he never kept it a secret from me), he said it was his duty to look after her and keep her safe even though everthing was returned to him unopened.  He was a deeply religious man who took the ""No sex for Lent"" to apply to all days of the year, and he spent many days and nights in extreme sexual frustration.  Finally, unable to commit to me after a year of whining codependence, sexual absenance, and being absolutely positively determined that someday somehow Nicole would come back to him, he broke it off to become a priest.  About a year later he married another woman who wasn't Nicole.  No really.This movie brings out a lot of things that are otherwise typical male fantasy and frustration.  Matt, the main character, is devistated that the old girlfriend Nicole broke up with him, and has decided the only way to get it out of his system is to abstain from sex for Lent.  He will not just not sleep with other women, but abstain from all aspects (porn, masterbation, etc.).  This is no easy feat for a man, as men are hardwired to think about nothing but sex at every waking moment.  The hilarity ensues with his friends taking bets on how long he can last, suddenly all women around him looking hotter, and all the sexual reference one can imagine.  He, naturally, meets the girl of his dreams and cannot break his promise until after said 40 days are over.  She gets annoyed, he gets insane, and it all works out in the end.I don't really know where I stand on this, except it was just an eerie coincidence as to something that happened to me in real life.  It struck me as being very self centered or maybe insecure of Matt to not tell his new girlfriend about this.  Had I been in her position I would have been as sympathetic as possible.  But Matt was at least likable and did not spend every waking moment whining to his friends and aquaintence ""Oh whoa is me, Nicole left me"".  Unlike some people.  He had a purpose, and did not lie to himself about his feelings or wants.  The rest of the movie is just filler, filled with smutty references and sex jokes that unfortunately sends this movie into the ""it's just ok"" field.I guess the biggest question here is if Matt emerged as a stronger, wiser person because of this choice.  To me, I didn't see it that way.  He seemed the same, except that he had successfully moved on from his old girlfriend to a new one.  He didn't earn the admiration of his friends who knew about it, instead they shook their heads and laughed at him behind his back.  And the new girlfriend didn't seem any different either, except she must have been glad they didn't have to wait anymore.  And of course, for me, I wondered where this all lead to the real people that this movie unknowingly imitated.  The ""Matt"" and ""Nicole"" real people are most likely still married to their spouses, the real ""Matt"" has probably conveniently forgotten about all these things from my perspective.  As the viewing audience, I can't help but feel bitter and hurt by it.  But that's the past.  I was the one who emerged the stronger from this experience.  I am no longer weak and eager to make others happy, I am strong.  And because I am strong, I met a wonderful man with who I am happy with who doesn't need a mother.",3,Art imitates life,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,3900,"['picked', 'up', 'movie', 'just', 'wanting', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'lite', 'entertainment', 'was', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'shocked', 'eerie', 'parallel', 'showed', 'own', 'life', 'Years', 'was', 'going', 'out', 'Matt', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'while', 'met', 'named', 'Nicole', 'who', 'dumped', 'walked', 'away', 'never', 'spoke', 'again', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'vain', 'centered', 'think', 'was', 'girl', 'dreams', 'think', 'am', 'damned', 'good', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'talking', 'still', 'sent', 'presents', 'letters', 'told', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'was', 'doing', 'never', 'kept', 'secret', 'said', 'was', 'duty', 'look', 'keep', 'safe', 'even', 'everthing', 'was', 'returned', 'unopened', 'was', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'No', 'sex', 'Lent', 'apply', 'days', 'year', 'spent', 'many', 'days', 'nights', 'extreme', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'Finally', 'unable', 'commit', 'year', 'whining', 'codependence', 'sexual', 'absenance', 'being', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'determined', 'someday', 'somehow', 'Nicole', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'broke', 'off', 'become', 'priest', 'year', 'later', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nicole', 'No', 'really.This', 'movie', 'out', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'male', 'fantasy', 'frustration', 'Matt', 'main', 'character', 'devistated', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Nicole', 'broke', 'up', 'decided', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'system', 'abstain', 'sex', 'Lent', 'will', 'not', 'just', 'not', 'sleep', 'other', 'women', 'abstain', 'aspects', 'porn', 'masterbation', 'etc.', 'easy', 'feat', 'man', 'men', 'are', 'hardwired', 'think', 'nothing', 'sex', 'waking', 'moment', 'hilarity', 'friends', 'taking', 'bets', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'last', 'suddenly', 'women', 'looking', 'hotter', 'sexual', 'reference', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'naturally', 'girl', 'dreams', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'promise', 'said', '40', 'days', 'are', 'annoyed', 'insane', 'out', 'end.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'stand', 'was', 'just', 'eerie', 'coincidence', 'something', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'struck', 'being', 'very', 'self', 'centered', 'maybe', 'insecure', 'Matt', 'not', 'tell', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Had', 'been', 'position', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'sympathetic', 'possible', 'Matt', 'was', 'least', 'likable', 'did', 'not', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'whining', 'friends', 'aquaintence', 'Oh', 'whoa', 'Nicole', 'left', 'people', 'had', 'purpose', 'did', 'not', 'lie', 'feelings', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'filler', 'filled', 'smutty', 'references', 'sex', 'jokes', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'just', 'ok', 'field.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'question', 'here', 'Matt', 'emerged', 'stronger', 'wiser', 'person', 'choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'seemed', 'same', 'had', 'successfully', 'moved', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'admiration', 'friends', 'who', 'knew', 'instead', 'shook', 'heads', 'laughed', 'back', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'different', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'anymore', 'course', 'wondered', 'where', 'lead', 'real', 'people', 'movie', 'unknowingly', 'imitated', 'Matt', 'Nicole', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'still', 'married', 'spouses', 'real', 'Matt', 'probably', 'conveniently', 'forgotten', 'things', 'perspective', 'viewing', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bitter', 'hurt', 'past', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'emerged', 'stronger', 'experience', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'weak', 'eager', 'make', 'others', 'happy', 'am', 'strong', 'am', 'strong', 'met', 'wonderful', 'man', 'who', 'am', 'happy', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'mother']",40 Days and 40 Nights

708873,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00006ADFO,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 4]","Yes, this film is very contrived, somewhat offensive/vulgar, and pretty formulaic in the ""romantic comedy"" genre...but for me, despite those flaws, what makes this film better than I expected are the great scenes of San Francisco and the unique beauty of Shannyn Sossamon.  I absolutely love her in this film...her look, her performance, her character...she is definitely my ideal woman (if there are any real women out there who resemble her).  I always thought it would be a cool thing to meet the love of your life in a laundromat, and this film has that scene in there.  Another thing I think is cool is riding the city bus all over the city as you observe the people on the bus, the route it takes, and the fresh perspective you get seeing a part of the city you might otherwise not see.  That was in there too.  San Francisco was the perfect city to set this film in and is very much a star of this film in its own right.I like the offbeat side characters, like the bicycle courier, who is typical of the ones I've met.  He was funny in nearly all of his scenes, so that added a lot to making this film better than its premise.  Now, about that premise...it just seems a bit overdone that Matt (Josh Hartnett) would go nearly crazy abstaining from sex for a mere 40 days.  I was in basic training for 9 weeks with 70 other guys in the company and no one went crazy from the lack of sexual opportunity.  Let's face it, Matt is probably a sex addict who should've checked into Betty Ford Clinic for 40 days.  Alas, he didn't, so we have the comedic antics as he attempts to keep his vow despite temptation rearing its ugly head in many different ways, from women on the street to advertisements to his co-workers' pranks as the office pool moneypot grows with bets taken on when he will break his vow.  I found it amusing that his female co-workers confronted Matt about taking the one power women have over men away from them by his vow of abstinence.  Its funny that so many people in the film seemed to take his vow personally, as if he made it for them instead of for himself.This film probably has the most unique love scene I've ever seen in a film, as Matt manages to keep his abstinence vow while bringing extreme sensual pleasure to Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) with the use of flower petals (I'm not kidding--it has to be seen to be believed, but even then people might want to try that trick at home to see how genuine that could actually be).  Unfortunately, like all romantic comedies, there has to be an exposure of the truth that causes one of them to flee the relationship and the inevitable groveling to win back one's true love.  Somehow, it didn't ring true for me in this film.  Like I said, this film is poorly contrived and is only saved because of some of its humourous scenes, the great scenes of San Francisco sites, and mostly because of the presence of Shannyn Sossamon who is an actress I hope to see in more movies, of higher quality.  She has a very unique look and style that I find lacking in many other actresses of our generation.  She had a small role in ""A Knight's Tale"", so this film she has more screen time, next will be to find a better film/script for her acting talent and presence.",4,Funny and contrived comedy for anyone with offbeat humour,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,3225,"['Yes', 'film', 'very', 'contrived', 'somewhat', 'offensive/vulgar', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'flaws', 'what', 'film', 'better', 'expected', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'San', 'Francisco', 'unique', 'beauty', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'absolutely', 'love', 'film', 'look', 'performance', 'character', 'definitely', 'ideal', 'woman', 'are', 'real', 'women', 'who', 'resemble', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'thing', 'meet', 'love', 'life', 'laundromat', 'film', 'scene', 'there', 'thing', 'think', 'cool', 'riding', 'city', 'bus', 'city', 'observe', 'people', 'bus', 'route', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'get', 'seeing', 'part', 'city', 'might', 'otherwise', 'not', 'see', 'was', 'there', 'too', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'perfect', 'city', 'set', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'star', 'film', 'own', 'right.I', 'offbeat', 'side', 'characters', 'bicycle', 'courier', 'who', 'typical', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'met', 'was', 'funny', 'nearly', 'scenes', 'added', 'lot', 'making', 'film', 'better', 'premise', 'Now', 'premise', 'just', 'bit', 'overdone', 'Matt', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'would', 'go', 'nearly', 'crazy', 'abstaining', 'sex', 'mere', '40', 'days', 'was', 'basic', 'training', '9', 'weeks', '70', 'other', 'guys', 'company', 'one', 'went', 'crazy', 'lack', 'sexual', 'opportunity', 'Let', 'face', 'Matt', 'probably', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'should', ""'ve"", 'checked', 'Betty', 'Ford', 'Clinic', '40', 'days', 'Alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'comedic', 'antics', 'keep', 'vow', 'temptation', 'rearing', 'ugly', 'head', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'women', 'street', 'advertisements', 'co-workers', 'pranks', 'office', 'pool', 'moneypot', 'bets', 'taken', 'when', 'will', 'break', 'vow', 'found', 'amusing', 'female', 'co-workers', 'confronted', 'Matt', 'taking', 'one', 'power', 'women', 'have', 'over', 'men', 'away', 'vow', 'abstinence', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'seemed', 'take', 'vow', 'personally', 'made', 'instead', 'himself.This', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'unique', 'love', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Matt', 'keep', 'abstinence', 'vow', 'bringing', 'extreme', 'sensual', 'pleasure', 'Erica', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'use', 'flower', 'petals', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'even', 'then', 'people', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'trick', 'home', 'see', 'how', 'genuine', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'be', 'exposure', 'truth', 'one', 'flee', 'relationship', 'inevitable', 'groveling', 'win', 'back', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'Somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'film', 'said', 'film', 'poorly', 'contrived', 'only', 'saved', 'humourous', 'scenes', 'great', 'scenes', 'San', 'Francisco', 'sites', 'mostly', 'presence', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'actress', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'higher', 'quality', 'very', 'unique', 'look', 'style', 'find', 'lacking', 'many', 'other', 'actresses', 'generation', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'film', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'next', 'will', 'be', 'find', 'better', 'film/script', 'acting', 'talent', 'presence']",40 Days and 40 Nights

He attempts to fill the void left in his life by having a series of unfulfulling one night stands. While talking to his brother, who is training to become a priest, he decides to take drastic action. Prompted by the arrival of Lent and also the realization that Nicole is recently engaged Matt decides to give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights. He isn't limiting it to intercourse any foreplay or self gratification is also off limits. No one close to him including his roommate, brother, or co workers believe he can go through with it and begin taking bets for how long he will last. To complicate matters he meets a beautiful young girl named Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) one night while doing laundry. The two begin an awkward romance with Erica left confused about why Matt isn't putting the moves on her. He doesn't tell her about the vow but eventually she finds out and is not happy about it. The film only works thanks to the beautiful Sossamon. Hartnett is good in their scenes together  but on his own he doesn't fare as well. The supporting cast is good with Griffin Dunne as Hartnett's boss who is miserable because he too isn't getting any, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sossamon's sassy roommate. Otherwise the film is a standard teen sex comedy that isn't real funny and that ends terribly. The director Michael Lehmann directed the great Heathers but hasn't directed a funny movie since. Decent enough for fans of either Hartnett or Sossamon but ultimately unsatisfying.",2,Everyone involved has done much better,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1566,"['Matt', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'just', 'ended', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Nicole', 'fill', 'void', 'left', 'life', 'having', 'series', 'unfulfulling', 'one', 'night', 'talking', 'brother', 'who', 'training', 'become', 'priest', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'Prompted', 'arrival', 'Lent', 'also', 'realization', 'Nicole', 'recently', 'engaged', 'Matt', 'give', 'up', 'sex', '40', 'days', '40', 'nights', ""n't"", 'limiting', 'intercourse', 'foreplay', 'self', 'gratification', 'also', 'off', 'limits', 'one', 'close', 'including', 'roommate', 'brother', 'co', 'workers', 'believe', 'can', 'go', 'begin', 'taking', 'bets', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'last', 'complicate', 'matters', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Erica', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'one', 'night', 'doing', 'laundry', 'two', 'begin', 'awkward', 'romance', 'Erica', 'left', 'confused', 'why', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'putting', 'moves', ""n't"", 'tell', 'vow', 'eventually', 'out', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'only', 'thanks', 'beautiful', 'Sossamon', 'Hartnett', 'good', 'scenes', 'together', 'own', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'Hartnett', 'boss', 'who', 'miserable', 'too', ""n't"", 'getting', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sossamon', 'sassy', 'roommate', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'standard', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'real', 'funny', 'terribly', 'director', 'Michael', 'Lehmann', 'directed', 'great', 'Heathers', ""n't"", 'directed', 'funny', 'movie', 'Decent', 'enough', 'fans', 'Hartnett', 'Sossamon', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying']",40 Days and 40 Nights
708881,A19BR7XJJ3NOLU,B00006ADFO,Ryan Norton,"[0, 1]",I had never seen this movie before and Everyone kept telling me it was a classic and that I needed to get it ASAP...I have 100's of DVD's in my collection so I thought what the heck I can sure use another one.  I got it and it was actually pretty good.The plot surrounds Josh Hartnett's Character who is basically just fed up with all of the one night stands he has been having lately (I know that is nuts right :P )...He is also trying to get over his ex girlfriend who just so happens to be getting married to someone else.  Seems as though she has gotten over him.  So in order to regain control over the woman in his life and in order to regain control of his own sexual life he decided to take a vow of abstinence!!!! YES I SAID ABSTINENCE!!!! Now everything is wonderful in the beginning but then things get a little weird.  He meets a girl who is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of his Ex Girlfriend and he actually starts to fall for her.  He wants to have sex with her but he can't because of the Vow.  And on top of all of that there is a friendly wager going on at his office with the date that he decides to give up as the center focus.  So while he is trying to refrain from sex all of his insanely sexy co-workers are trying to get him to give up so that they can win the very high jackpot from the bet.  It will have you laughing all the way up until the very end and it is a truly tasteful mix of comedy and romance :) I think any couple or just anyone who is bored will love this movie and I would recommend that you pick one up today while there are still some in stock :)And I would also ask that if you found this review helpful in your decision to purchase this item that you could click the button and let me know.

A collective guy like Matt finds himfelf contemplating what do about his sex-life. He's a religious kind of guy with the dubious-distinction of cooling things off with his (hormones) and his love-life with the ladies. Anyway, he gets with a Catholic Preist, dissussing with him the delicate-subject of ""celibacy"", on doing away with sex for 40 days and 40 nights, as a part of the [Catholic Church's] ""Lent Celebration."" Meanwhile, throughout the movie Matt befriends a beautiful woman (Erica) at the laundermat, where romantic-sparks fly and things start to heat-up. Matt and Erica eventually shack-up together and are subsequently sleeping in the same bed (you guessed it), they were - full-on - making-out with each other. Why is it, that this movie is a pathetic-means to ""going-against-the-grain"" with it's repugnant and repulsive story-line, (it's so contaridictory) the false pretenses (message) that it gives it's viewers, flutters their faith with what is morally right and justified with what the movie is really supposed to be about. The movie's chock-full of debauchery, and the devious sexual-sins being commited throughout. Matt (and a lot of the guys) in this movie find pleasure in masturbating incessantly, doing it, while looking at some pornographic magazines. (The dudes - can't help - but ""spank their monkey"" any chance they get.) This movie set in San Francisco, California, makes for a romantic setting. But The romantisisim between Matt and Erica fades into the 2nd-half of the movie with Matt's ulterior-motives to putting-off having sex with her. Little does she know, that Matt can't have sex for 40 days/nights. There are so many bare-breasted women in this movie, that makes it feel like your watching a porn-flick. (I thought it was totally unessecary.) All I have to say, is this movie comes-up way short. I loved watching the sparks-fly bettween the two - the truth of the matter is - that this movie was funny at the start (in the 1st-half) but lost some steam in the 2nd-half. I thought Matt was really going to be true to himself, and follow through on his commitments. Sadly, there's no redeeming-value to this movie.
