Nonetheless it is definitely entertaining to me to learn more about it whenever the opportunity presents itself.I felt this video was informative but I had a hard time with the format. I felt the narrator could have been more descriptive in the layouts and probably should have explained the cards first before doing mock intuitive readings right off the bat.I am an intuitive Healer by trade and felt that the way she presented the ""How Tos"" of developing your intuition were limited at best.  She probably is the real deal, however she came off a bit on the con artist side to me during those mock readings. Some of things that she spoke about contradicted her own words at times.  I'm sure many newbies might be turned off by the presentation of this video.Having said that, I still give it 3 stars based on the content alone.  I am a big fan of watching a video over reading to learn new information, so I did like how she went through each card in the entire deck and explained it.Gary Hopkins: Author of ""The Master Within - A Practical Guide to Energy Healing""",3,Informative but.......,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,1169,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'Tarot', 'understand', 'not', 'quite', 'vocation', 'holistically', 'Nonetheless', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'learn', 'more', 'whenever', 'opportunity', 'itself.I', 'felt', 'video', 'was', 'informative', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'format', 'felt', 'narrator', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'descriptive', 'layouts', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'explained', 'cards', 'first', 'doing', 'mock', 'intuitive', 'readings', 'right', 'bat.I', 'am', 'intuitive', 'Healer', 'trade', 'felt', 'way', 'presented', 'How', 'Tos', 'developing', 'intuition', 'were', 'limited', 'best', 'probably', 'real', 'deal', 'however', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'con', 'artist', 'side', 'mock', 'readings', 'things', 'spoke', 'about', 'contradicted', 'own', 'words', 'times', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'newbies', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'presentation', 'video.Having', 'said', 'still', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'based', 'content', 'alone', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'watching', 'video', 'reading', 'learn', 'new', 'information', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'went', 'card', 'entire', 'deck', 'explained', 'it.Gary', 'Hopkins', 'Author', 'Master', 'Within', 'Practical', 'Guide', 'Energy', 'Healing']",N/A
905796,AAXIW3SRA0S4R,B0009I7DA8,"Laura De Giorgio ""hypnotherapist""","[5, 5]","The main thing that this DVD is trying to teach you is the difference between mechanical reading of tarot cards and an intuitive reading.  If you are an experienced tarot card reader, you would have already developed intuitive feel for the cards through practice; if you are new to reading tarot cards, the ultimate way for developing the intuitive feel for tarot cards is through practice.What you may get from this DVD are some pointers related to the care for the cards, how you may read 4 different spreads, and you may get the idea of several different ways in which each card of tarot deck may be interpreted. The possibilities for card interpretation would depend on what is it that you are reading for, what are the other cards involved, where are they positioned, as well as on your intuitive feeling for the cards and the situation.At the end of the video is an overview of 14 different card spreads for example, how to get yes and now answer, how to do a relationship spread, Celtic cross spread, how to attain your desires in life, how to do weekly spread, how to do monthly spread, how to do reading for your love life, how to do reading related to your children, even how to do reading for your pet, and few other spreads.",5,Intuitive tarot reading best suited for beginners,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,1236,"['main', 'thing', 'DVD', 'trying', 'teach', 'difference', 'mechanical', 'reading', 'tarot', 'cards', 'intuitive', 'reading', 'are', 'experienced', 'tarot', 'card', 'reader', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'developed', 'intuitive', 'feel', 'cards', 'practice', 'are', 'new', 'reading', 'tarot', 'cards', 'ultimate', 'way', 'developing', 'intuitive', 'feel', 'tarot', 'cards', 'may', 'get', 'DVD', 'are', 'pointers', 'related', 'care', 'cards', 'how', 'may', 'read', '4', 'different', 'spreads', 'may', 'get', 'idea', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'card', 'tarot', 'deck', 'may', 'be', 'interpreted', 'possibilities', 'card', 'interpretation', 'would', 'depend', 'are', 'reading', 'what', 'are', 'other', 'cards', 'involved', 'where', 'are', 'positioned', 'as', 'well', 'intuitive', 'feeling', 'cards', 'situation.At', 'end', 'video', 'overview', '14', 'different', 'card', 'spreads', 'example', 'how', 'get', 'yes', 'now', 'answer', 'how', 'do', 'relationship', 'spread', 'Celtic', 'cross', 'spread', 'how', 'attain', 'desires', 'life', 'how', 'do', 'weekly', 'spread', 'how', 'do', 'monthly', 'spread', 'how', 'do', 'reading', 'love', 'life', 'how', 'do', 'reading', 'related', 'children', 'even', 'how', 'do', 'reading', 'pet', 'few', 'other', 'spreads']",N/A

But, to those of you who are picking up the Tarot for the first time these two DVD's are extremely beneficial. She does not talk to fast. If she talked any faster I would have had to rewind. The key point that is so helpful, is that why she is talking she has a card up in the upper left hand corner of her screen - and as she talks she highlights certain parts of the card and explains to you the meaning of why the image is there. She lays out spreads and shows you how to do a mechanical reading and then using the same cards shows you how it would look intuitively - which I found very helpful. I believe her method of teaching was refreshing and will help others too, in further understanding their own spreads. I suppose it's mainly meant for beginners, though I don't feel I'm a beginner and I felt I received wonderful information that was very enlightening. It also gave me insights into certain cards that I had not thought of myself. Out of all the Tarot books I've read to-date I would highly recommend: Joan Bunning's - Learning the Tarot - as she not only gives lessons and exercises in her book to practice, along with a page devoted to each card - her book (in full) is online as well, so you can print out the exercises which is very beneficial. Also, if you check with Barnes and Nobles they offer a FREE online course that uses this same book and further helps you in your studies, with support and students too boot, all for free. However, with all of these tools, the Tarot is still a very difficult study for so many, which is the reason so many give up. These two DVD's offer insights that the free B&N course and books don't give you. And to boot they give you a feeling of sitting with a professional reader that you won't get from any book. I believe these two DVD's complimented the Joan Bunning approach and taught me new ways of viewing the Tarot. I highly recommend both DVD's. Most Tarot courses tell you not to stop your studies with their book, so to me I found these three courses most helpful as the free online course (which I think comes out each spring), but you have to check B&N for the dates, gives you support from other beginning students the book is online and follows the course and these two DVD's give you new and exciting insights - personally after all my studies these are the three things I would recommend for beginners as they all compliment each other, and all offer something different. Good luck and may the Spirit of the Tarot guide you to the books and programs that will best help you become the best Tarot Reader you can be...",5,Enlighten your Tarot Studies!,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2634,"['suppose', 'people', 'found', 'DVD', 'unhelpful', 'who', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'Tarot', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'DVD', 'are', 'extremely', 'beneficial', 'not', 'talk', 'fast', 'talked', 'faster', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'rewind', 'key', 'point', 'so', 'helpful', 'why', 'talking', 'card', 'up', 'upper', 'left', 'hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'highlights', 'certain', 'parts', 'card', 'meaning', 'why', 'image', 'there', 'spreads', 'how', 'do', 'mechanical', 'reading', 'then', 'using', 'same', 'cards', 'how', 'would', 'look', 'intuitively', 'found', 'very', 'helpful', 'believe', 'method', 'teaching', 'was', 'refreshing', 'will', 'help', 'others', 'too', 'further', 'understanding', 'own', 'spreads', 'suppose', 'mainly', 'meant', 'beginners', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'m"", 'beginner', 'felt', 'received', 'wonderful', 'information', 'was', 'very', 'enlightening', 'also', 'gave', 'insights', 'certain', 'cards', 'had', 'not', 'thought', 'Tarot', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'to-date', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Joan', 'Bunning', 'Learning', 'Tarot', 'not', 'only', 'lessons', 'exercises', 'book', 'practice', 'page', 'devoted', 'card', 'book', 'full', 'online', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'print', 'out', 'exercises', 'very', 'beneficial', 'Also', 'check', 'Barnes', 'Nobles', 'offer', 'FREE', 'online', 'course', 'same', 'book', 'further', 'helps', 'studies', 'support', 'students', 'too', 'boot', 'free', 'However', 'tools', 'Tarot', 'still', 'very', 'difficult', 'study', 'so', 'many', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'give', 'up', 'two', 'DVD', 'offer', 'insights', 'free', 'B', 'N', 'course', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'boot', 'give', 'feeling', 'sitting', 'professional', 'reader', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'book', 'believe', 'two', 'DVD', 'complimented', 'Joan', 'Bunning', 'approach', 'taught', 'new', 'ways', 'viewing', 'Tarot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Most', 'Tarot', 'courses', 'tell', 'not', 'stop', 'studies', 'book', 'so', 'found', 'three', 'courses', 'most', 'helpful', 'free', 'online', 'course', 'think', 'out', 'spring', 'have', 'check', 'B', 'N', 'dates', 'support', 'other', 'beginning', 'students', 'book', 'online', 'course', 'two', 'DVD', 'give', 'new', 'exciting', 'insights', 'personally', 'studies', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'compliment', 'other', 'offer', 'something', 'different', 'Good', 'luck', 'may', 'Spirit', 'Tarot', 'guide', 'books', 'programs', 'will', 'best', 'help', 'become', 'best', 'Tarot', 'Reader', 'can', 'be']",N/A
