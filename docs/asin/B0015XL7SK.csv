Neel had a unique ability to capture the essence of a person.  Unfortunately, she fell beneathe the radar of public notice in recent years.  The film drags a bit, but is a ""must see""  for anyone who cares about art and the true (not just representational) portrait of another human being.",4,A Must See,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,376,"['caught', 'early', 'screening', 'film', 'department', 'College', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Neel', 'had', 'unique', 'ability', 'capture', 'essence', 'person', 'Unfortunately', 'fell', 'beneathe', 'radar', 'public', 'notice', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'bit', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'art', 'true', 'not', 'just', 'representational', 'portrait', 'human', 'being']",Alice Neel Documentary

What could have been great ends up merely good. While a loss, very little produced in the arts fails as well as this film so bear that in mind through the frustrating moments. In this way, the film oddly recapitulates its subject's existence. Good for it, good for us, but for the filmmaker a mixed bag, as the film never recapitulates the complexity of its subject; as if it really could....",4,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,573,"['Alice', 'Neel', 'film', 'overall', 'worthy', 'film', 'see', 'director', 'Neel', 'needed', 'step', 'back', 'let', 'personal', 'issues', 'evaporate', 'then', 'really', 'give', 'good', 'hard', 'edit', 'film', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'up', 'merely', 'good', 'loss', 'very', 'little', 'produced', 'arts', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'so', 'bear', 'mind', 'frustrating', 'moments', 'way', 'film', 'oddly', 'subject', 'existence', 'Good', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'mixed', 'bag', 'film', 'never', 'complexity', 'subject', 'really', 'could']",Alice Neel Documentary

I knew very little of her life, but her art woke me. Through her eyes I began to see the colors. I looked at skin and saw the many colors that make up something as simple as skin tone. She blew up the color spectrum for me and taught me in one afternoon to see.  So often in life we see what we think we should see, Alice saw what was there, and then she saw through what was there to the essence of the person.  Her portraits were both reductive and complex.This excellent documentary was a revelation. I learned a great deal about Alice Neel, her art, her life and her place in art history.  It is an unflinching look at Alice's life and art, and how they inform each other. Alice Neel holds a place in the iconography of American artists and this documentary will introduce you to her rare and steadfast visual genius.",5,Alice Neel - a great American icon,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,933,"['first', 'introduction', 'Alice', 'Neel', 'work', 'was', 'show', 'Alice', 'Neel', 'Paintings', '1933-1982', 'Loyola', 'Marymount', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'life', 'art', 'woke', 'eyes', 'began', 'see', 'colors', 'looked', 'skin', 'saw', 'many', 'colors', 'make', 'up', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'skin', 'tone', 'blew', 'up', 'color', 'spectrum', 'taught', 'one', 'afternoon', 'see', 'So', 'often', 'life', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'should', 'see', 'Alice', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'there', 'then', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'there', 'essence', 'person', 'portraits', 'were', 'reductive', 'complex.This', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'was', 'revelation', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'Alice', 'Neel', 'art', 'life', 'place', 'art', 'history', 'unflinching', 'look', 'Alice', 'life', 'art', 'how', 'inform', 'other', 'Alice', 'Neel', 'place', 'iconography', 'American', 'artists', 'documentary', 'will', 'introduce', 'rare', 'steadfast', 'visual', 'genius']",Alice Neel Documentary
