The Sleeper is basically Black Christmas, the original, with a few gory kills. The first kill had me worried because it was done so poorly. The Sleeper (his nickname) hits a girl in the face & it caves in, the second kill didn't make much sense either. Aside from the decent gore, the killer did a good job. His face was never hidden & he looked like one of hundred of maniac's you'd see in an 80's horror flick. A reviewer pointed out some other slasher films he looks like he was from. While I agree those aren't the best slashers, this guy does a better job. Highly recommend this if you're a fan of 80's slashers, this looks like it came out in 1982.",4,The Sleeper,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,798,"['horror', 'movies', 'promise', '80', 'feel', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'one', 'delivers', 'creepy', 'score', 'sound', 'effects', 'few', 'tense', 'moments', 'Sleeper', 'basically', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'original', 'few', 'gory', 'kills', 'first', 'kill', 'had', 'worried', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'poorly', 'Sleeper', 'nickname', 'girl', 'face', 'second', 'kill', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'either', 'Aside', 'decent', 'gore', 'killer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'face', 'was', 'never', 'hidden', 'looked', 'one', 'hundred', 'maniac', ""'d"", 'see', '80', 'horror', 'flick', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'other', 'slasher', 'films', 'was', 'agree', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'slashers', 'guy', 'better', 'job', 'Highly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'fan', '80', 'slashers', 'came', 'out', '1982']",The Sleeper

I love 80s horror movies, not because they were all that great, but because there's a bit of nostalgia there.  This film kind of captures some of that, if only in the music.  Very few of the people actually looked like they were living in 1981 actually, and the dance scene...what?What was the point of the opening scene?  So the guy killed a girl in that house a few years before the events of the movie...so what?  It was never discussed, referenced, or anything.  Nobody said, ""hey, you know a girl was murdered here in 1979.""  Nothing...why even put it in?How many sophomore girls join sororities?  Isn't that what freshmen do?  And why would that sorority just invite a random girl on the street?So the main character's roommate and best friend...why was she dressed up as a goth girl?That was one happening party though...watchout...all 8 people!!  Where were the other pledges?Why didn't anyone ever lock a door in this movie?  Even when the cops ""secured"" the sorority house, both the front and back doors are open for both the boyfriend and the killer to just waltz right in.Are there only 4 cops on a university or in a town like that?  And why would the cop keep sending the main character out on the street...alone?What did he do with all the bodies?  He killed around ten people or so in a 24-hour period.  No way he could drag them all back to his ""lair"" which also happens to be the basement of a heavily-used academic building accessible by a well-lit staircase...nobody saw this guy down there?...So the pool nudity scene...what?  She makes out with the guy after pulling him into the pool, takes her top off, makes out some more and then ditches him to get dressed...what???Why was the guy's hammer always spotless, even after he just killed someone?Look, 80s horror films were never known for their deep plots, but this movie has just too many holes to follow.  The special effects are a joke...I laughed more than I cringed...come to think of it, I never cringed.  From the girl's head magically becoming a rubber mask as the guy hammers her to death, to the obvious ""trick"" of not showing someone get hit by a hammer or knife because they couldn't afford fake weapons that would splatter blood or something.Oh and the acting was terrible.This was a family/friends production and it shows.  Some tips:If you are having a ""party"" at a sorority house, go to the local college and recruit some kids to act as extras.If you are setting your movie in the 80s...have your actors/actresses look like they are in the 80's.  Just look at a yearbook from the early 80s to get an idea of how they looked.Explain WHY your killer is doing this.  Give him some background...even if you don't give us everything, provide a motive.  Was he rejected by sorority girls a while back?  They could have done a ""vision"" scene where the killer remembers getting made fun of by sorority girls.Create some suspense...the deaths were all easy to see coming.  I actually was bored during the part where she was hiding in the auditorium.If you are doing an homage to 80's horror movies, the best you can hope to do is parody them.  It'd be like trying to a 50's or 60's horror movie...they worked for their time, but today it just doesn't fly.  You can have your movie set in the 80's, but you need to not have so many plot holes and everything mentioned above.

1515420,ADRPRLXG3UN90,B006H3NO5M,D. K.,"[1, 1]","I ordered the limited box set with the VHS directly from the company and it came in the mail the day of it's release. The packaging is supposed to resemble a 'big box' VHS although only slightly larger than a DVD case. The size seems to be a problem with a lot of the companies doing retro releases on VHS. Camp put out The Basement which was the right height and thickness and too wide so it stuck out an inch past the rest of the tapes. Mondo put out Things which was way taller than any other clamshell case. This one is smaller than regular big boxes but at least fits on a regular shelf with the rest of your tapes and the spine blends in nicely with the rest.The tape itself is red with a faux '50c charge if not returned rewound' sticker for added touch. The intro FBI warning and rating look just like the real thing and the movie itself has the look and feel of a genuine 80's VHS pretty close. Another nice touch is one of the fliers the girls are passing out is also included with the set so for the price it's definitely worth it if you're into VHS.Now for the movie itself, I liked the movie a lot. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but neither were movies it's paying homage to. The dark and shaky camera work has a pretty good feel and looks authentic. The grain is right too, it's just enough and doesn't overdo it like the Grindhouse movies did. The score is great and I was happy to watch a new movie with a real score instead of just shoving random bands in anywhere they could. The only thing that bothered me was the fashion, the clothes didn't really scream 80's to me and the eyebrows most of all looked too thin and modern, which is really a small gripe in the grand scheme lol. And a HUGE plus for me was the cameo by JOE BOB BRIGGS! I grew up on Monster Vision on TNT so I was very happy to see him.This is a really good movie and well worth the asking price. It doesn't feel like a gimmick, more like a real homage by someone who loves the genre.

Boy, was I disappointed.  Nothing about this movie made me feel that it took place in the late 70's/early 80's except for the oh-so-desperate basketball & (really bad) disco cheesefests that occur within the movie as a reminder that the horrible acting and lame script are okay because it's supposed to be an ""homage"". No, don't let the shiny disco ball, tube socks, and countless rotary phones fool you: this movie just sucks.  The killer giggles/cries/whimpers like a hyena throughout half of the movie, and the acting in every single frame was beyond horrible.

1515425,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B006H3NO5M,G. Garner,"[4, 6]","Seriously, if you're gonna make a film that is a deliberate ripoff of early 80's slasher movies, why stop at 98%? Why not simply go all the way? This film is packed, from beginning to end, with all sorts of borrowed elements from traditional slasher movies. A typical weapon-a hammer. A traditional setting-a sorority house. A typical cast-lots of attractive, unknown youngsters. Mysterious, threatening phone calls. Hell, they even set the thing in the early 80's, the pinnacle of the golden era for slasher movies.Now, if you're gonna go THAT far...........why not just go all the way, and put the killer IN A MASK!!!! What? Were they trying to be original? In a movie where virtually EVERY SINGLE OTHER ELEMENT is borrowed? What on Earth was the point in this omission? Killers in these types of movies need to be mysterious. They need to have a cryptic aura about them. Very few of them are effective when they are presented without the mask. A mask just suits this whole motif. It works.For me, it makes the difference between crafting a rock solid slasher film-which this IS-and the chance at making a really outstanding one, which this COULD have been.If you like this type of film, think 'Black Christmas', but with a faster pace and more overt violence. It's a legitimately good movie. I am just somewhat disapointed, because I think it could have just as easily been substantially better.On the plus side, however, the brunette in the swimming pool scene is worth the price of the dvd.(perhaps 2 or 3 dvds!)Of course, casting a sexy girl in a movie is nothing new.

Since I love horror films I thought I'd give this one a chance. I'm sure glad I did. I thought it was entertaining from beginning to end, with some legitimately tense scare scenes. The characters were mostly likeable and the acting was good for a movie like this one. The final girl in the film (Amy) was a cute girl-next-door type that you couldn't help rooting for.The movie is set up to look like a lost film from the early 1980s. I think it did a great job accomplishing that look and feel. Actually, it tricked me until I looked for more information about it on the Internet. It reminded me of the original ""Black Christmas"" and ""Prom Night"" movies. I think it was actually better than ""Black Christmas"" and on par with ""Prom Night"". My favorite scene was actually a fun disco dancing sequence that came out of nowhere and made me smile from ear to ear.My only complaint is that we never get full closure for two of the characters in the movie. The audience probably should assume that one of the girls and one of the guys has been murdered like the others, but we never see their bodies or a clear attack. That kind of left me wondering what happened to them, especially since these were two of the more memorable characters in the story. That's a minor complaint though, since they have been most likely killed by the Sleeper.If you like slasher movies from the late 70s/early 80s, you will most likely enjoy this movie.

1515428,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B006H3NO5M,Joe Smart,"[5, 9]","This is intended to be a fake 80's slasher pic in much the same way that Ti West's House of the Devil was a fake early 80's horror pic.  Unfortunately writer/director Justin Russell doesn't have the eye for detail that West has, so it's not likely that anyone would ever confuse The Sleeper with the real thing.  Russell does get a couple of things right--the movie looks very dark like an early 80's cheapie along the lines of Don't Answer the Phone (one obvious inspiration even though it's not actually a very good film) and Night School.  The synth soundtrack by Gremlin (which is probably meant as a parody of Goblin, a band that did a lot of horror soundtracks in the 70's and 80's) also sounds about right.  Unfortunately, The Sleeper pretty much gets everything else wrong.  First there is the nudity--almost none.  Early in the film there is a sex scene and a shower scene which are both shot carefully to show no actual nudity.  This coyness with naked skin is a dead giveaway that this isn't a real 80's horror flick--the classic slasher pics included nudity pretty freely.  When I was a young teen and saw those movies in the theater that was part of the appeal--you got to see a lot of naked breasts along with the gore.  Then there's the hair.  There's no feathered hair or signs of blow drying or hair spray or hair gel--in short none of the actors has a hairstyle that you were likely to see in the 80's.  Then there's the period detail--other than an occasional shot of a cassette player or an old TV there really is none.  Then there's the fact that director Russell shows his killer's face early in the movie and shows it often after that.  Unless you're talking about a masked killer movie like Halloween or Friday the 13th a real 80's slasher movie would not show the face of the killer until the end of the film, and maybe not even then.  That's a really big no-no because you generally don't know who the killer is in these films and usually there is at least one red herring character who might be the killer but isn't.  So The Sleeper never actually comes close to working as a fake 80's movie the way the far superior House of the Devil does.  Taken as a homage to 80's horror or just as a slasher pic it still isn't all that good.  There's not much suspense and minimal gore which tends to look more fake that it needs to, as if the filmmaker was more concerned with getting a campy laugh than in filming a good gore sequence.  The makers of this film probably could have gotten 80's make-up artist Tom Savini for a six pack of beer and a pizza--I've seen him at horror conventions selling off his laserdisc collection and signing autographs, so if the filmmakers had wanted gore that looked like something you would have seen in a good 80's slasher pic they certainly could have gotten it.  But The Sleeper doesn't even really aspire to be a good 80's style horror film--quality-wise it feels like something that might have been put out by Crown International (like, say, Don't Answer the Phone).  I'm sure some people will enjoy this but as someone who grew up watching real 80's slasher pics I was disappointed.",2,So-so fake 80's slasher pic,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,3141,"['intended', 'be', 'fake', '80', 'slasher', 'pic', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Ti', 'West', 'House', 'Devil', 'was', 'fake', 'early', '80', 'horror', 'pic', 'Unfortunately', 'writer/director', 'Justin', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'have', 'eye', 'detail', 'West', 'not', 'likely', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'confuse', 'Sleeper', 'real', 'thing', 'Russell', 'get', 'couple', 'things', 'right', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'early', '80', 'cheapie', 'lines', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Answer', 'Phone', 'one', 'obvious', 'inspiration', 'even', 'not', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Night', 'School', 'synth', 'soundtrack', 'Gremlin', 'probably', 'meant', 'parody', 'Goblin', 'band', 'did', 'lot', 'horror', 'soundtracks', '70', '80', 'also', 'about', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'Sleeper', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'wrong', 'First', 'nudity', 'almost', 'none', 'Early', 'film', 'sex', 'scene', 'shower', 'scene', 'are', 'shot', 'carefully', 'show', 'actual', 'nudity', 'coyness', 'naked', 'skin', 'dead', 'giveaway', ""n't"", 'real', '80', 'horror', 'flick', 'classic', 'slasher', 'pics', 'included', 'nudity', 'pretty', 'freely', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'teen', 'saw', 'movies', 'theater', 'was', 'part', 'appeal', 'got', 'see', 'lot', 'naked', 'breasts', 'gore', 'Then', 'hair', 'feathered', 'hair', 'signs', 'blow', 'drying', 'hair', 'spray', 'hair', 'gel', 'short', 'none', 'actors', 'hairstyle', 'were', 'likely', 'see', '80', 'Then', 'period', 'detail', 'other', 'occasional', 'shot', 'cassette', 'player', 'old', 'TV', 'really', 'none', 'Then', 'fact', 'director', 'Russell', 'killer', 'face', 'early', 'movie', 'often', ""'re"", 'talking', 'masked', 'killer', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'real', '80', 'slasher', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'face', 'killer', 'end', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'then', 'really', 'big', 'no-no', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'killer', 'films', 'usually', 'least', 'one', 'red', 'herring', 'character', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'killer', ""n't"", 'So', 'Sleeper', 'never', 'actually', 'close', 'working', 'fake', '80', 'movie', 'way', 'far', 'superior', 'House', 'Devil', 'Taken', 'homage', '80', 'horror', 'just', 'slasher', 'pic', 'still', ""n't"", 'good', 'not', 'much', 'suspense', 'minimal', 'gore', 'look', 'more', 'fake', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'getting', 'campy', 'laugh', 'filming', 'good', 'gore', 'sequence', 'makers', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', '80', 'make-up', 'artist', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'six', 'pack', 'beer', 'pizza', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'conventions', 'selling', 'off', 'laserdisc', 'collection', 'signing', 'autographs', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'wanted', 'gore', 'looked', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'good', '80', 'slasher', 'pic', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'Sleeper', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'aspire', 'be', 'good', '80', 'style', 'horror', 'film', 'quality-wise', 'feels', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'Crown', 'International', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Answer', 'Phone', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'real', '80', 'slasher', 'pics', 'was', 'disappointed']",The Sleeper

I was kind of impressed by the way this movie starts out and by the bold attempts at shocking closeups of facial and head attacks with its limited special effects budget. The look and feel of the retro 1981 film stock was a good match for that era. The story was not as well thought out nor did they do any reserch on Police Dept protocols or internal medicine. Again, I started out liking this movie, but it didn't take long before i started to chuckle at the killer, students , den mother and the detective for their actions and their correct dialogue (seriously, no I really mean seriously) that doesn't show up for at least another decade and a half. The production was not bad across the board, but the story, direction and the acting all needed a little to a lot of help. The killer and the victims looked staged for their attack scenes and you could see either the killers shadow or reflection from an angle the victim can see and could have reacted to the attacker. The victims do little to try and escape the evil clutches of the killer or to fight back and the attacks are way to short for the method being used in some scenes.The cast will act afraid when there is no cause for alarm and not when there is cause for alarm? The detective was my next big problem. He tells a girl who has been threatened to walk unescorted from her dorm to his location??? He arrives in a squad car??? Detectives rarely if ever use them. He again asks the girl to go and find a phone that works to call for backup unescorted nor does he use the radio in his squad car??? He doesn't wait for backup to go after the bad guy??? There is a song that is playing in the bar that sings about vinyl records, cassettes tapes and cd's, but according to Wikipedia cd's don't go on sale commercially until 1982. There was just way to many things that bugged me about this production and its high ratings that mislead me into thinkig I was going to watch a really well made horror flick NOT!!! I will give it 1.7 stars for trying to be a good movie. Was it worth  the time?

I was born in 1974 so I have been there from the beginning. I heard about this film from Amazon, while searching for something to watch. I saw this a read how it was a homage to the 80s. I figured why not give it a try. It hit that time period right on the head. This is not a movie that takes place in 80s, no this is a movie with the feel of the 1980s. From the clothes to the cars and music. The story is pretty good too. The killings are similar to the killings in the ""Slumber Party Massacre"", but just a little more gory than what they would have been if this was filmed in the 80s. I think it's just that fake blood must just look better.",5,You would never know this wasn't from the 80s,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,762,"['will', 'be', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'sucker', '80s', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'especially', 'ones', 'early', '80s', 'was', 'born', '1974', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'beginning', 'heard', 'film', 'Amazon', 'searching', 'something', 'watch', 'saw', 'read', 'how', 'was', 'homage', '80s', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'try', 'hit', 'time', 'period', 'right', 'head', 'not', 'movie', 'place', '80s', 'movie', 'feel', '1980s', 'clothes', 'cars', 'music', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'killings', 'are', 'similar', 'killings', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'gory', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'filmed', '80s', 'think', 'just', 'fake', 'blood', 'must', 'just', 'look', 'better']",The Sleeper

It takes place during those obscure years tucked in between disco and Big Hair bands. America was still recovering from the shock of having elected an actor as President, an actor I would say was far better than any that appeared in this roughly edited film.The movie uses the ""killer's point of view"" technique which means they jerk the camera around during some of the scenes, but they don't use the technique effectively. There was no character build-up and while we saw the killer, they didn't drop clues as to why he was knocking off the girls.? What was that line dance thing? And did we have to see the whole thing? Sex and shower scenes with no nudity and they dare to compare it to an 80's slasher film. It falls short of an 80's style slasher.
