If you like anything that Dejohnette, Hancock and Metheny have done then you must check this out. Holland was a special surprise to say the least. It really is that good.",5,Worth every penny,988934400,"05 4, 2001",2001,307,"['Excellent', 'production', 'Pioneer', 'really', 'did', 'one', 'right', 'mostly', 'purchased', 'Pat', 'was', '_very_', 'pleased', 'whole', 'concert', 'like', 'anything', 'Dejohnette', 'Hancock', 'Metheny', 'have', 'done', 'then', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'Holland', 'was', 'special', 'surprise', 'say', 'least', 'really', 'good']",N/A

It's much closer in style to Metheny's 'Question & Answer' CD, which was recorded in the year preceding this concert. Add in Hancock's unique keyboards style and it's a very acquired taste.I saw this quartet perform at the Royal Festival Hall in London in the year this DVD was recorded. I was actually sitting behind the band, which was an unusual but involving experience.This was possibly the last occasion that the British audience saw Metheny's long, bushy hair in its natural silvery state. On his return, it had acquired a mysterious auburn sheen.The DVD notes mention the fact that this quartet weren't getting on with each other in the early days of the tour. By the time of the recording, they were clearly coping with one another, but I wouldn't put it more strongly than that. To my knowledge, none of them has recorded much with any of the others in the 15 years since.So get this as a document of four jazz superstars, each playing well if not their very best, a selection of tunes, only one of which is a true jazz great.",3,"Not to everyone's taste, but good, all the same",1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,1205,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'Jack', 'DeJohnette', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'Standards', 'trio', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'music', 'superstar', 'quartet', 'much', 'closer', 'style', 'Metheny', ""'Question"", 'Answer', 'CD', 'was', 'recorded', 'year', 'preceding', 'concert', 'Add', 'Hancock', 'unique', 'keyboards', 'style', 'very', 'acquired', 'taste.I', 'saw', 'quartet', 'perform', 'Royal', 'Festival', 'Hall', 'London', 'year', 'DVD', 'was', 'recorded', 'was', 'actually', 'sitting', 'band', 'was', 'unusual', 'involving', 'experience.This', 'was', 'possibly', 'last', 'occasion', 'British', 'audience', 'saw', 'Metheny', 'long', 'bushy', 'hair', 'natural', 'silvery', 'state', 'return', 'had', 'acquired', 'mysterious', 'auburn', 'sheen.The', 'DVD', 'mention', 'fact', 'quartet', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'other', 'early', 'days', 'tour', 'time', 'recording', 'were', 'clearly', 'coping', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'more', 'strongly', 'knowledge', 'none', 'recorded', 'much', 'others', '15', 'years', 'since.So', 'get', 'document', 'four', 'jazz', 'superstars', 'playing', 'well', 'not', 'very', 'best', 'selection', 'tunes', 'only', 'one', 'true', 'jazz', 'great']",N/A
