1357056,A1CK5G1VZ7QDRD,B003Q6D200,A. Thurston,"[1, 3]","Actually there's several morals to this complex tale of one of the pioneers of the online billing services.Think Paycom or Paypal and any site that you use a credit card on to pay for something. The story revolves around 3 main characters business man and general wheeler dealer Jack Harris( Luke Wilson) and two spaced out ,kind of dumb near do wells named Wayne(Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck ( Gabriel Macht)Harris is a happily married Texan who lives in Houston with his wife Diana (Jacinda Basset) and kids.Jack's role in life is to fix broken deals and broker settlements and solve problems.. Wayne and Buck meet in L.A. and become friends,room mates and business partners. Neither has accomplished much Buck worked for NASA and is smart but has drug issues and Wayne was also fired from his job as a vet for using animal tranquilizers .While fixing up a failed night club out in L.A. for a friend Jack meets sleazy to the max lawyer Jerry Haggerty (James Caan) .Meanwhile Buck and Wayne get the idea to upload nude photos online and charge people monthly membership fees.Buck creates a program where a person can discreetly be billed via an online credit card service. Problems begin when they need fresh content for their site to keep members coming back.The boys clumsily approach Russian Mobster Nikita Sokoloff (Rade Serbedzija) who owns a large strip club .They awkwardly propose a business deal where they shoot the clubs girls for their website and in return give Sokoloff a 25% cut .The mob agrees to allow them to and things soon take off.But as fate has it Buck and Wayne are lousy businessmen and strung out often and fall behind on payments.Enter Haggerty who meets with Jack  and convinces him to meet with Wayne and Buck and help them settle up with the mob and get a successful business plan in place.In theory the idea makes sense as Jack is a straight arrow businessman who sees a ton of money making potential with Bucks on line billing services. But Jack is married and reluctant to get involved with pornography and also is wary of Buck and Wayne and the Russian mob as well.After a lot of hemming and hawing Jack agrees to work as a middleman for all parties .Things really boom the online porn takes off,the billing service expands and money is coming in hand over fist. But Jack is not happy as he's away from home often and estranged from Diana and the kids. The business takes a toll on his marriage and he seperates from Diana and stays in L.A. Meanwhile Buck and Wayne become jealous of Jacks sudden new found fame and feel like second bananas.They and Jerry broker a side deal with sleazy pornographer Denny Z (Jason Anton) to run his content alongside their own without Jack's knowledge. Meanwhile as his marriage falls apart Jack gets involved with sexy,jaded,streetwise porn star/web girl Audrey Dawns( Laura Ramsey) .Dawns is about half his age and knows her way around but Jack is attracted to her and they move in together. The story gets complicated at times as there's also a murder,Jack's sons arrest for computer hacking.Audrey's infidelity ,double crossing ,a terrorist connection to Audrey's website and the FBI looking to bring anyone and everyone down. Jack gets shaken down by a sleazy District Attorney in Houston played by Kelsey Grammar and also gets involved with the FBI via agent Allmans(Kevin Pollak) .There's so much going on that you forget at his core Jack is really a good guy and wants his normal life back.No more porn stars,pornographers or mobsters. And Wayne and Buck face legal issues as Denny Z is using their site to upload kiddie porn with under aged girls.I guess the best way to sum it up is the moral of the story is go with your initial gut feelings.If you cannot tell people what it is you do for a living then you likely should stop doing it. Audrey has no guilt and Haggerty would sell drugs to kids if he could make a buck. The Russian mob only sees money to be made and Buck and Wayne enjoy what they do and the perks that come with it. In closing Middle Men is an interesting view of the origins of online billing and the beginning of the internet porn business. The acting is top notch Wilson,Ribisi,Macht,Caan,Ramsey and Basset are all great in their respective roles. If you are not put off by the subject matter and it's many masterbation references you will find Middle Men both funny and dramatic,sleazy and interesting.",4,And the moral of the story is..,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,4401,"['Actually', 'several', 'morals', 'complex', 'tale', 'one', 'pioneers', 'online', 'billing', 'services.Think', 'Paycom', 'Paypal', 'site', 'use', 'credit', 'card', 'pay', 'something', 'story', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'business', 'man', 'general', 'wheeler', 'dealer', 'Jack', 'Harris', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'two', 'spaced', 'kind', 'dumb', 'do', 'wells', 'named', 'Wayne', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Buck', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Harris', 'happily', 'married', 'Texan', 'who', 'Houston', 'wife', 'Diana', 'Jacinda', 'Basset', 'kids.Jack', 'role', 'life', 'fix', 'broken', 'deals', 'broker', 'settlements', 'solve', 'problems..', 'Wayne', 'Buck', 'meet', 'L.A.', 'become', 'friends', 'room', 'mates', 'business', 'partners', 'accomplished', 'much', 'Buck', 'worked', 'NASA', 'smart', 'drug', 'issues', 'Wayne', 'was', 'also', 'fired', 'job', 'vet', 'using', 'animal', 'tranquilizers', '.While', 'fixing', 'up', 'failed', 'night', 'club', 'L.A.', 'friend', 'Jack', 'sleazy', 'max', 'lawyer', 'Jerry', 'Haggerty', 'James', 'Caan', '.Meanwhile', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'get', 'idea', 'upload', 'nude', 'photos', 'online', 'charge', 'people', 'monthly', 'membership', 'fees.Buck', 'program', 'where', 'person', 'can', 'discreetly', 'be', 'billed', 'online', 'credit', 'card', 'service', 'Problems', 'begin', 'when', 'need', 'fresh', 'content', 'site', 'keep', 'members', 'coming', 'back.The', 'boys', 'clumsily', 'approach', 'Russian', 'Mobster', 'Nikita', 'Sokoloff', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'who', 'large', 'strip', 'club', '.They', 'awkwardly', 'propose', 'business', 'deal', 'where', 'shoot', 'clubs', 'girls', 'website', 'return', 'give', 'Sokoloff', '25', '%', 'cut', '.The', 'mob', 'allow', 'things', 'soon', 'take', 'off.But', 'as', 'fate', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'are', 'lousy', 'businessmen', 'strung', 'out', 'often', 'fall', 'behind', 'payments.Enter', 'Haggerty', 'who', 'Jack', 'meet', 'Wayne', 'Buck', 'help', 'settle', 'up', 'mob', 'get', 'successful', 'business', 'plan', 'place.In', 'theory', 'idea', 'sense', 'Jack', 'straight', 'arrow', 'businessman', 'who', 'ton', 'money', 'making', 'potential', 'Bucks', 'line', 'billing', 'services', 'Jack', 'married', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'pornography', 'also', 'wary', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'Russian', 'mob', 'well.After', 'lot', 'hemming', 'hawing', 'Jack', 'work', 'middleman', 'parties', '.Things', 'really', 'boom', 'online', 'porn', 'billing', 'service', 'expands', 'money', 'coming', 'hand', 'fist', 'Jack', 'not', 'happy', 'away', 'home', 'often', 'estranged', 'Diana', 'kids', 'business', 'toll', 'marriage', 'Diana', 'stays', 'L.A', 'Meanwhile', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'become', 'jealous', 'Jacks', 'sudden', 'new', 'found', 'fame', 'feel', 'second', 'bananas.They', 'Jerry', 'broker', 'side', 'deal', 'sleazy', 'pornographer', 'Denny', 'Z', 'Jason', 'Anton', 'run', 'content', 'alongside', 'own', 'Jack', 'knowledge', 'Meanwhile', 'marriage', 'apart', 'Jack', 'involved', 'sexy', 'jaded', 'streetwise', 'porn', 'star/web', 'girl', 'Audrey', 'Dawns', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', '.Dawns', 'age', 'way', 'Jack', 'attracted', 'move', 'together', 'story', 'complicated', 'times', 'also', 'murder', 'Jack', 'sons', 'arrest', 'computer', 'hacking.Audrey', 'infidelity', 'double', 'crossing', 'terrorist', 'connection', 'Audrey', 'website', 'FBI', 'looking', 'bring', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'down', 'Jack', 'shaken', 'down', 'sleazy', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Houston', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'also', 'involved', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Allmans', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'forget', 'core', 'Jack', 'really', 'good', 'guy', 'normal', 'life', 'back.No', 'more', 'porn', 'stars', 'pornographers', 'mobsters', 'Wayne', 'Buck', 'face', 'legal', 'issues', 'Denny', 'Z', 'using', 'site', 'upload', 'kiddie', 'porn', 'aged', 'girls.I', 'guess', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'moral', 'story', 'go', 'initial', 'gut', 'feelings.If', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'people', 'what', 'do', 'living', 'then', 'likely', 'should', 'stop', 'doing', 'Audrey', 'guilt', 'Haggerty', 'would', 'sell', 'drugs', 'kids', 'could', 'make', 'buck', 'Russian', 'mob', 'only', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'enjoy', 'what', 'do', 'perks', 'come', 'closing', 'Middle', 'Men', 'interesting', 'view', 'origins', 'online', 'billing', 'beginning', 'internet', 'porn', 'business', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Wilson', 'Ribisi', 'Macht', 'Caan', 'Ramsey', 'Basset', 'are', 'great', 'respective', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'subject', 'matter', 'many', 'masterbation', 'references', 'will', 'find', 'Middle', 'Men', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'sleazy', 'interesting']",N/A

Still, the story was kind of annoying at times. For the working class people out there, watching this many jack-asses piss away this much money is just a approx. 2 hour reminder of how stupid, disproportional, and poorly distributed the distribution of wealth is. Still, you kind of expect that before watching a movie about the establishment of the online porn industry. You find yourself asking if anyone should be able to get this wealthy off of a few minutes of work on anything? Anyway, I am trying to divorce my own beliefs from my critique of the movie, but the characters and story pissed me off from time to time. In many ways it is a story about 15 minutes of brilliance followed by half a decade of pure stupidity.

In the process, the hero gets involved in an affair, many quite daft people and some dodgy characters. He is lucky and manages to escape before the police move in and keeps his marriage going.

1357060,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Q6D200,Chris Pandolfi,"[46, 54]","A section in the end credits for ""Middle Men"" asserts that, although it was inspired by a true story, the film is, in fact, a work of fiction. I've tended to find this annoying, especially in relation to horror movies. In the case of ""Middle Men,"" however, the assertion fascinates me, for Christopher Mallick, the film's producer, has claimed that much of what we see - 80%, apparently - is based on his own experiences. A former chief executive of Paycom, the Texas-born entrepreneur was a key player in bringing the adult entertainment industry to the internet, pioneering the technology that makes online purchases, especially monthly memberships to porn sites, easy and secure. In essence, he was a middle man. His efforts have paid off; according to a set of statistics published by Jerry Ropelato in 2006, the annual revenue of internet porn was nearly $3 billion in the United States alone. I have no doubt that the rate has increased since then.As to how much of this film is true, as to what facts have been embellished or altered or altogether made up, I obviously have no way of knowing. That, of course, only makes it that much more irresistible. In the film, Mallick is reinterpreted as Jack Harris (Luke Wilson), who begins as a respectable and competent businessman, having a knack for talking and negotiating with people of every flavor, including mobsters that enjoy busting people's kneecaps with baseball bats. Sometime between the mid to late 1990s, he becomes involved with Wayne Beering (Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck Dolby (Gabriel Macht), two Los Angeles cokeheads who realized they could build an empire by scanning dirty pictures onto their computer, posting them on the internet, and selling them for $9.99. They have absolutely no business sense and are basically idiots, and never mind that Dolby was formerly a rocket scientist and has an IQ of 183.What begins as a straight-and-narrow handling of affairs quickly escalates into something grander, Harris, Beering, and Dobly becoming wealthy entrepreneurs over the space of five years. It also becomes far more dangerous, Beering and Dolby having gotten involved with a Russian mobster (Rade rbedzija); he owns a strip club, you see, and they generate new content for their site by posting videos and photos of his girls. You know how it is with mobsters. They want their cut of the profits pronto. But you also know how it is with guys like Beering and Dolby. They blow off all their money on drugs. They don't know any better, not even when their faces are smashed in or their heads are shoved into toilets.Harris, meanwhile, will have to use his business smarts to contend with a shady Las Vegas lawyer (James Caan), a spiteful young adult actress he has fallen in love with (Laura Ramsey), and a team of federal agents, led by Kevin Pollack, who want to use the adult actress as a weapon against international terrorism (and of all the movies I've ever seen, this is definitely a new one for me). He must also come to terms with the fact that he still has a family back home in Texas, and that, despite his wealth affording them the good life, he hasn't been there for him. Matters are complicated even further when Beering and Dolby, never able to think before they act, learn that they have unknowingly been exploiting underage models.I grant you that this is a lot to take in. The director and co-writer George Gallo is reported to have written an expletive followed by the words, ""keep up,"" on the front page of the screenplay as a reminder that, should the audience leave the theater for even a minute, they will miss something important. I don't particularly agree with the first part of his mantra (which I can't repeat), but the second part is spot on. You have to keep up. The thing is, that shouldn't be a problem; this movie is so well structured, so finely acted, and so cleverly written that you're libel to get hooked within the first ten minutes. It plays like a cross between ""Boogie Nights"" and a Guy Ritchie film, seamlessly interweaving comedy, crime, and mystery into a character-driven plot, the Harris character serving not only as the film's narrator and main player, but also as the emotional center.Indeed, there is something oddly compelling about Jack Harris, the way an all-around respectable guy can allow himself to be so corrupted by the pursuit of the American Dream. His continuous narration is filled with regret, but there's also a certain dry, sardonic twist to his words, as if to suggest that the whole thing is utterly ridiculous. Well, it IS utterly ridiculous. And yet, a lot of it is true - if you're willing to take Christopher Mallick's word for it, that is. That blurring of fact and fiction, that inability to distinguish reality from fantasy, is part of why ""Middle Men"" was so enjoyable for me. That, and the fact that it's simply a fine movie. I liked the humor. I liked the intrigue. I liked the performances. And I really liked the screenplay; not only is it founded on an engaging premise, it's also refreshingly honest about what the internet really is for.",4,The Internet is for Porn,1281312000,"08 9,

It was due to porn that the home VCR took off. Porn drove hotel rental movies and porn drove home rental movies. Porn drove DVD to replace VHS. And porn drove the internet, at least initially, in the 1995-2000 period. In this very well done movie it's seen that porn also brought about the all important financial backoffice of the internet, secure online payment processors through which porn consumers could transfer fees to porn producers without dealing directly.The movie is excellent, highly entertaining and very well produced, with a laid-back slightly ironic persona (think My Name is Earl) supported by a number of grade A peformances (James Caan, etc.). Even more interesting is the real life saga behind the story.Actually, it turns out there are two sagas. The first is that the movie, while fictionalized, is based on the invention of online secure transactions, without which online porn could never have become a huge moneymaker. Chris Mallick, the producer of the film, is telling essentially his own story - although embellished with a number of fictional plot twists to make a good tale such as Russian mafia, murders, etc. The transaction processor firm was called ePassporte.com, and it got a small cut of each buy and sell. It added up fast.The second backstory is that it seems Mr. Mallick, whose business background is littered with lawsuits and slightly off kilter enterprises, took rather a risk to finance the $22M it cost to produce this film. Counting on theatre returns after release, he borrowed the development money from - the account holders of ePassporte.com. Without their permission. (He controlled the deposits via a bank in Netherland Antilles.) Unfortunately the film - which was only released a year ago - did not receive the expected strong audience receipts. I'm not sure why, because it's well done and highly entertaining, but it bombed. So Mallick and ePassporte got jammed up in what essentially turned up as a fraud and Ponzi scheme.Account holders, most of them porn content developers around the world, lost millions when VISA pulled the plug. They are still trying to get it back. Mr. Mallick travels with a bodyguard and issues various deceptive statements from time to time.

1357069,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Q6D200,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 4]","Middle Men barely slipped quietly into theatres, grossed $733,000 on a $20 million budget, and eventually slipped quietly onto DVD in early February. Critics hardly bothered with the film, audiences didn't care, and with such a quiet release you'd think the studio was under the impression they had an embarrassment on their hands. Well, let me just say that this is not a bad film. I don't suspect the filmmakers behind Middle Men were trying to win an Oscar and I'm sure that this film never intended to do anything but entertain, which in its 110-minute running time it does quite well being much-better than its low-profile release implies. The only major flaw is the familiarity of the story and even more so in the way it is told.Opening with the title card ""Inspired by a True Story,"" you know you're in for something wholly unbelievable. Luke Wilson plays Jack Harris, who, in the opening scene, is en route to deliver money to some Russian mobsters. Jack narrates the film in the matter-of-fact, but slightly comedic manner reminiscent of the more recentConfessions of a Dangerous Mindand the much betterGoodFellas. Through his opening narration, he tells us that he's involved in the mess he's in because he helped make it easier for ""men to **** off."" Next, we meet Buck (Gabriel Macht) and Wayne (Giovanni Ribisi), two cocaine-fueled friends living in Los Angeles. Wayne comes up with the idea of putting adult pictures on the world-wide web and charging a monthly subscription for it; Buck develops a code that allows people to charge their credit cards online, which we're told he does before any major company had. When their site takes off, Buck and Wayne get involved with Russian mobster Nikita Sokoloff (Rade Serbedjiza), and Jack is eventually called in to straighten out the business issues that Buck and Wayne can't handle. Jack is a family man and doesn't want to be involved with pornography, but it is he who comes up with the idea of billing customers under discreet names and soon he's making everyone rich.All of this is set to a great soundtrack featuring The Rolling Stones, Stone Temple Pilots, 2Pac, and Hall & Oates. With this soundtrack, it seems plausible that a significant portion of that $20 million budget was used to secure song rights even with the all-star cast this movie boasts. The impressive cast also features Terry Crewes, Kevin Pollak, Kelsey Grammer, screen veteran Robert Forster, and screen legend James Caan. The acting is easily the highlight of the entire film. Wilson is terrific as the conflicted family man, giving one of his best performances in a long time. It's not Oscar-caliber stuff, but it's an admirable performance. Ribisi's high-energy, hilarious performance as the paranoid, anxiety-ridden Wayne is a delightful slice of overacting. Crewes does what he always does, but brings great charisma and presence to his role and Forster is an actor who's presence in a film is enough to make you smile. Of course, seeing the legend that is James Caan may be enough for some people to check this movie out. As Jerry Haggerty, a sleazy lawyer facing a federal indictment, it's a joy to see Caan doing something substantial and unlike most aging actors of his stature, he gives a real performance rather than just phoning it in.Despite using porn as a background, there's no sex and a surprisingly tame amount of nudity. Director George Gallo doesn't exploit the subject matter and puts his focus on the story, but contrived twists (the FBI enlists Jack to help locate terrorists with his website), stock characters (Sokoloff is the archetypal Russian mob boss, but Serbedjiza makes it fun to watch), and recycled story arcs are what ultimately bring the film down. Anyone looking for insight into the story behind the online porn industry will want to look elsewhere as Middle Men simply uses this as a backdrop, since the porn industry has enough mob connections and intrigue to fuel this type of film. It plays like a comedy with dark overtones, but never gets too heavy. You can file this in the same category (but not league) of films like the aforementioned Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Matchstick Men,Casino, and others. It's not poorly written and its screenplay is fast-paced and wickedly entertaining, with well-developed, yet familiar characters; it just plays like an Elmore Leonard novel with less depth.While it follows a familiar template and offers nothing new in terms of theme, story, or style it is effective as amusing, dark-toned entertainment. There are several reasons to see Middle Men, but the biggest problem with it is that it's been done before and it's been done better.GRADE: B",4,Wickedly Entertaining,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,4669,"['Middle', 'Men', 'barely', 'slipped', 'quietly', 'theatres', 'grossed', '733,000', '20', 'million', 'budget', 'eventually', 'slipped', 'quietly', 'DVD', 'early', 'February', 'Critics', 'hardly', 'bothered', 'film', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'such', 'quiet', 'release', ""'d"", 'think', 'studio', 'was', 'impression', 'had', 'embarrassment', 'hands', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'filmmakers', 'Middle', 'Men', 'were', 'trying', 'win', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'never', 'intended', 'do', 'anything', 'entertain', '110-minute', 'running', 'time', 'quite', 'well', 'being', 'much-better', 'low-profile', 'release', 'implies', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'familiarity', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'way', 'told.Opening', 'title', 'card', 'Inspired', 'True', 'Story', 'know', ""'re"", 'something', 'wholly', 'unbelievable', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Jack', 'Harris', 'who', 'opening', 'scene', 'en', 'route', 'deliver', 'money', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'Jack', 'film', 'matter-of-fact', 'slightly', 'comedic', 'manner', 'reminiscent', 'more', 'recentConfessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mindand', 'much', 'betterGoodFellas', 'opening', 'narration', 'involved', 'mess', 'helped', 'make', 'easier', 'men', '****', 'off', 'Next', 'meet', 'Buck', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Wayne', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'two', 'cocaine-fueled', 'friends', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Wayne', 'up', 'idea', 'putting', 'adult', 'pictures', 'world-wide', 'web', 'charging', 'monthly', 'subscription', 'Buck', 'code', 'people', 'charge', 'credit', 'cards', 'online', ""'re"", 'told', 'major', 'company', 'had', 'When', 'site', 'off', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'get', 'involved', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'Nikita', 'Sokoloff', 'Rade', 'Serbedjiza', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'called', 'straighten', 'out', 'business', 'issues', 'Buck', 'Wayne', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Jack', 'family', 'man', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'pornography', 'who', 'up', 'idea', 'billing', 'customers', 'discreet', 'names', 'soon', 'making', 'everyone', 'rich.All', 'set', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Stone', 'Temple', 'Pilots', '2Pac', 'Hall', 'Oates', 'soundtrack', 'plausible', 'significant', 'portion', '20', 'million', 'budget', 'was', 'used', 'secure', 'song', 'rights', 'even', 'all-star', 'cast', 'movie', 'impressive', 'cast', 'also', 'Terry', 'Crewes', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'screen', 'veteran', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'screen', 'legend', 'James', 'Caan', 'acting', 'easily', 'highlight', 'entire', 'film', 'Wilson', 'terrific', 'conflicted', 'family', 'man', 'giving', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'Oscar-caliber', 'stuff', 'admirable', 'performance', 'Ribisi', 'high-energy', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'paranoid', 'anxiety-ridden', 'Wayne', 'delightful', 'slice', 'overacting', 'Crewes', 'what', 'always', 'great', 'charisma', 'presence', 'role', 'Forster', 'actor', 'who', 'presence', 'film', 'enough', 'make', 'smile', 'course', 'seeing', 'legend', 'James', 'Caan', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'people', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'Jerry', 'Haggerty', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'facing', 'federal', 'indictment', 'joy', 'see', 'Caan', 'doing', 'something', 'substantial', 'most', 'aging', 'actors', 'stature', 'real', 'performance', 'rather', 'just', 'phoning', 'in.Despite', 'using', 'porn', 'background', 'sex', 'surprisingly', 'tame', 'amount', 'nudity', 'Director', 'George', 'Gallo', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'subject', 'matter', 'focus', 'story', 'contrived', 'twists', 'FBI', 'Jack', 'help', 'locate', 'terrorists', 'website', 'stock', 'characters', 'Sokoloff', 'archetypal', 'Russian', 'mob', 'boss', 'Serbedjiza', 'watch', 'recycled', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'what', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'film', 'down', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'insight', 'story', 'online', 'porn', 'industry', 'will', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Middle', 'Men', 'simply', 'backdrop', 'porn', 'industry', 'enough', 'mob', 'connections', 'intrigue', 'fuel', 'type', 'film', 'comedy', 'dark', 'overtones', 'never', 'too', 'heavy', 'can', 'file', 'same', 'category', 'not', 'league', 'films', 'aforementioned', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'Casino', 'others', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'screenplay', 'fast-paced', 'wickedly', 'entertaining', 'well-developed', 'yet', 'familiar', 'characters', 'just', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'novel', 'less', 'depth.While', 'familiar', 'template', 'nothing', 'new', 'terms', 'theme', 'story', 'style', 'effective', 'amusing', 'dark-toned', 'entertainment', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'see', 'Middle', 'Men', 'biggest', 'problem', 'been', 'done', 'been', 'done', 'better.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

Luke Wilson, who I absolutely love, was in my opinion badly miscast.  He in any form would have a difficult time convincing me as a character that could stand up to the mob, of any sort or size.  Setting that flaw aside, the movie meandered along through most of the scenes in a monotone soliloquy, narrated by our miscast actor, who plays the main character.  Other than flashing a few breasts now and then, there was really little suspense, drama, or enticement.  I will say that the story was intriguing and if it had been better cast and directed, it might have drawn me into the movie a little better.Luke Wilson plays Jack Harris, an all around fix it man.  If you have a problem with your business, you call Jack and he will fix it for you.  Giovanni Ribisi and Gabriel Macht are two guys that own a business, and they are doing a fantastic job of screwing it up.  You see the internet is just getting off of the ground and nobody has any idea how to capitalize from it.  These two brilliant idiots figure out how to charge credit cards online for viewers who want to watch a little porn.  Not a bad business plan as we know all too well today.Their first problem is how to get the porn.  So they enlist the Russian mob to help them out.  The Russian mob happens to own a strip club and they are all about broadcasting nudity over the web, as long as they get a very large cut of the funds.  Our two heroes start out well, but they get a little to intrigued stuffing drugs up their noses and the next thing they know, the mob is threatening to kill them.  Are you following along?  Somehow a very very very old looking James Caan hooks them up with Luke Wilson and he rides in to save their asses.Unfortunately Luke pisses off James Caan by cutting him out of the deal, accidently pisses off the Russian mafia by snuffing a guy out, and generally has his hands full with the two idiots who started the business to begin with.  Throw in the fact that he is made of flesh and blood and gets a little too caught up in the smoking hot women side of things, and you have a melting pot that is ready to explode, it is just a matter of time.The story is intriguing and it has more naked breasts than any movie I can think of in a long time (not that this is my barometer for a good movie), but it was just too much on the slow and boring side.  It seems I might be in the minority but when I looked around the theater, very few people were sitting up in their seats.  Most of them were fighting to keep their eyes open.I would give it a mediocre rating, three stars at best.  If you wait to watch it on DVD you would be better served than seeing this one in the theater.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 4]","Middle Men relates the story of Jack Harris, a family man, with the perfect wife, perfect family, and a successful businessman.It's 1995, and the internet is taking off. Two foolish geniuses hit upon a multi million dollar idea to market porn over the internet.  Unfortunately, they have partnered with the wrong people, and are in over their head.  One of them has written a very valuable computer program, which I agree is very smart and revolutionises the way business is done over the internet.When Jack is asked to bail these guys out, he sees a huge opportunity, and gets into business with them, and is extremely successful. However, complications ensue, and Jack's values, and his family life come under threat, and he ends up in some potentially compromising positions, some of his own making, and some through the wildcard players he has become involved with.You may wonder who Audrey Dawn is. She is a porn star, convincingly played by Laura Ramsay, the hottest sexiest blonde I have seen in a while, and who gives a very convincing performance here.  Definitely one to watch for in the future.I came to the movie knowing vaguely that it was about the porn business, so I did not know what to expect, or even have high expectations.  It turned out to be much better than I imagined.  The fact that it is based on a true story added to my enjoyment, as otherwise it would have been quite unbelievable. The real character on whom this is based, Christopher Mallick is a also a producer of the movie.Here is a quote from Jack Harris: Business is a lot like sex getting in is easy, pulling out is hard.You may wonder what porn has to with the 'War on Terror.' It's a good thing to wonder, and you may be surprised by the answer.  I think this movie would be okay for couples.It stars Luke Wilson as Jack Harris, and Giovanni Ribisi as one of the duo. James Caan plays a shady fixer.  Kelsey Grammer has a short but memorable turn as an ambitious District Attorney.It's well worth a look, and one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in a while.

The always thriving pornography industry was poorly marketed on-line but thanks to Wayne Beering (Giovanni Ribisi), Buck Dolby (Gabriel Macht) and Jack Harris (Luke Wilson) that changed.  Wilson narrates the film throughout which gives his character a bit of sympathy I guess.  He was the business ""turnaround specialist"" that was needed to help the technical geniuses (Wayne and Buck) structure their venture.  Even though the two thrive in their geekiness, they are also at each other's throats like brothers.  Even worse, they are social misfits and unbelievably nave.  They get hooked up with the Russian mob and have a real problem getting unhooked.  Director George Gallo's film opened with a thud which is often the case when serious films about porn are made.  The movie has more than its fair share of bare breasts of all shapes and sizes, but doesn't go much beyond that.  Comedies tend to fare better with boobs.  Still, that isn't the focus.  How much of the story is accurate is questionable, but it clearly has some basis in reality.  The movie is well acted with supporting roles from James Caan as a smarmy lawyer, Rade Sherbedgia and the mob chieftan and Laura Ramsey as an always clothed porn star and part time sex partner for Jack.

So rediculous in fact that it's a total sin, because this film should have been on the list of 2009's nominated best picture Oscar picks. It's that good. It may have had a solid chance of carrying away the oscar in fact. So what could have happened? I really don't know, but I have some theories. For one thing this film consistantly and blatantly rips off Scorsese's Goddfellas. Not so much in the arena of the over all mob story, but in the voice over naration where the central character sounds almost exactly like Ray Liotta. And he also uses the same vocal manarisms Liotta did in Goodfellas. This seems kind of embarrassin in a way. There is also the use of music, freeze-framing, and other elements in an identicle style that Scorsese used in Goodfellas and Casino. However it's done so perfectly that though it feels like it should be an embarrassement to the film, it's completely forgivable because it's done absolutely perfect. The story is also unbelievable. All based on actual events you'll sit there blown away that you never knew all this happened. And the entire thing started with a couple of real idiotic screw-ups how created the very first internet porn site and through that made hundreds of millions of dollars with the help of a witty and cautious partner they hook up with. Along for the ride is James Cann who played Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, once again brilliant here as a corrupt Lawyer. This film was simply fantastic. Just fantastic.

Okay, maybe it wasn't like Social Network, other than the fact it is more popular, although no one admits to using it. This is ""inspired"" by a true story which means all the dialouge and most of the characters are fictional. Two genius drug user live together (Giovanni Ribisi plays an excellent paranoid on coke) and can't get any decent porn on the Internet so they decide to create their own web site and invent a program that allows people to pay on line with a credit card. They opt to get new material so they enlist the help of the Russian mafia. Luke Wilson plays a businessman and family man whose narration frequents the movie. He turns their web site into an Internet sensation by allowing access to multiple sites through their billing system.There is nudity and sex, but nothing that is over the top erotic. Was that Jesse Jane as one of those girls in the background?The film is front loaded with comedy. The movie starts to drag near the end, in fact whenever James Caan was on the screen, the movie went south.

After two slackers (Ribisi & Gabriel Macht) make over a million dollars in two months by coming up with a program to make money off of internet porn the russian mob wants thier cut.  They become partners with Jack Harris (Wilson) who takes thier business in to a legit area and makes them more money then they dreamed of.  This movie really surprised me in the fact that I was expecting a straight comedy.  While this movie had its really funny moments its also dramatic throughout.  An amazing cast helps tell the story of someone other then Mark Zuckerberg getting rich off the internet.  The events that happen in the movie made me wonder why I've never heard of this guy before.
