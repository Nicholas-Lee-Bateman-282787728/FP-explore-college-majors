Zaworski,"[11, 12]","I quite enjoyed this variation on the seven year itch....very entertaining, Yayaon!Peter Sellers stars in this humorous 1960s Black and White comedy about temptation, and the seven year itch, in marriage.  He almost commits adultery in this light hearted film, but all kinds of quirky and ironic situations combine against his success in this effort and endeavor.  He finally realizes that his one true love is his wife, and that she is the woman of his desires.4 stars!",5,Another twisted Peter Sellers classic!,947980800,"01 16, 2000",2000,470,"['quite', 'enjoyed', 'variation', 'seven', 'year', 'itch', '.very', 'entertaining', 'Yayaon', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'humorous', '1960s', 'Black', 'White', 'comedy', 'temptation', 'seven', 'year', 'itch', 'marriage', 'almost', 'adultery', 'light', 'hearted', 'film', 'kinds', 'quirky', 'ironic', 'situations', 'combine', 'success', 'effort', 'endeavor', 'finally', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'wife', 'woman', 'desires.4', 'stars']",N/A
337061,A1W6AMIGHPX3UQ,630280633X,J. Merritt,"[9, 9]","""Only Two Can Play"" is an underrated and overlooked slice of early Peter Sellers, before success in America thinned his body and inflated his comic style. Its plot is simple enough: Sellers is a theater critic and librarian with a wife (Virginia Maskell) and two kids, but this doesn't keep his eye from wandering, especially to a married but still entirely willing socialite (Mai Zetterling). From this straightforward triangular premise, the film works into the kind of subtle and intelligent sex comedy that England was so proficient at producing in the 50's and 60's. The comic effect is aided in no small part by Richard Attenborough's priceless portrayal of a foppish, pretentious poet (pardon the alliteration). Pick up a copy if you can track one down. For fans of Sellers and/or classic British comedies, it's an undiscovered gem.",5,The Glory Days of British Comedy,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,839,"['Only', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'underrated', 'overlooked', 'slice', 'early', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'success', 'America', 'thinned', 'body', 'inflated', 'comic', 'style', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Sellers', 'theater', 'critic', 'librarian', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Maskell', 'two', 'kids', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eye', 'wandering', 'especially', 'married', 'still', 'entirely', 'willing', 'socialite', 'Mai', 'Zetterling', 'straightforward', 'triangular', 'premise', 'film', 'kind', 'subtle', 'intelligent', 'sex', 'comedy', 'England', 'was', 'so', 'proficient', 'producing', '50', '60', 'comic', 'effect', 'aided', 'small', 'part', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'priceless', 'portrayal', 'foppish', 'pretentious', 'poet', 'alliteration', 'Pick', 'up', 'copy', 'can', 'track', 'one', 'down', 'fans', 'Sellers', 'and/or', 'classic', 'British', 'comedies', 'undiscovered', 'gem']",N/A
337062,A326BYJNA17NB1,630280633X,Paul Beauparlant,"[1, 1]","John Lewis (Sellers) is a real smooth operator when it comes to the ladies. With an undisciplined roving eye, he flirts and fantasizes, much to the chagrin of his loving wife,played by Virginia Maskell,who nevertheless has come to overlook it.True, he is a loving husband and father but can not resist a tryst or two...cue entrance of Mrs. Griffith-Williams (Mai Zetterling)who wants to 'help' him secure a higher position at the library where he works.  And that would be the Aberdarcy Public library in Aberdarcy, Wales which is where this film is set. The Lewis family live in a modest home back when your morning milk was waiting for you on your front step and you shared your toilet, of the pull chain from a box high on the wall variety, with the other tenants of your building. Naturally, the Lewis' could use the extra income pending John awarded the new position.There is much to enjoy with Only Two Can Play but is only available on videotape here in the U.S.Some of the things I enjoyed....a witty screenplay with Peters very sharp, as always, sparring with his neighbor, his co-workers and the loves of his life. Virginia Maskell is very attractive as his wife and in my opinion, more fetching than the current apple of Mr. Lewis' eye, the reptilian Zetterling. John has an adorable daughter who does not fail to let daddy know that her immaginary friend Bulky needs a goodbye kiss too. I found it curious and enjoyable to hear Sellers and other characters ending their sentences with 'you see'  as in, ""I'm realistic, you see.""  They end their sentences frequently with the added on 'you see'.And the Swansea, Wales locations, where this was filmed, are lovely. There is one scene wherein a local play is put on at a venue called the Glendower Hall, for all you Best Video lovers.",4,videocassette only,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1793,"['John', 'Lewis', 'Sellers', 'real', 'smooth', 'operator', 'when', 'ladies', 'undisciplined', 'roving', 'eye', 'much', 'chagrin', 'loving', 'wife', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Maskell', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'come', 'overlook', 'it.True', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'tryst', 'two', 'cue', 'entrance', 'Mrs.', 'Griffith-Williams', 'Mai', 'Zetterling', 'who', ""'help"", 'secure', 'higher', 'position', 'library', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'Aberdarcy', 'Public', 'library', 'Aberdarcy', 'Wales', 'where', 'film', 'set', 'Lewis', 'family', 'live', 'modest', 'home', 'back', 'when', 'morning', 'milk', 'was', 'waiting', 'front', 'step', 'shared', 'toilet', 'pull', 'chain', 'box', 'high', 'wall', 'variety', 'other', 'tenants', 'building', 'Naturally', 'Lewis', 'could', 'use', 'extra', 'income', 'pending', 'John', 'awarded', 'new', 'position.There', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Only', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'only', 'available', 'videotape', 'here', 'U.S.Some', 'things', 'enjoyed', '.a', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'Peters', 'very', 'sharp', 'always', 'sparring', 'neighbor', 'co-workers', 'loves', 'life', 'Virginia', 'Maskell', 'very', 'attractive', 'wife', 'opinion', 'more', 'fetching', 'current', 'apple', 'Mr.', 'Lewis', 'eye', 'reptilian', 'Zetterling', 'John', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'who', 'not', 'fail', 'let', 'daddy', 'know', 'immaginary', 'friend', 'Bulky', 'goodbye', 'kiss', 'too', 'found', 'curious', 'enjoyable', 'hear', 'Sellers', 'other', 'characters', 'ending', 'sentences', ""'you"", 'see', ""'m"", 'realistic', 'see', 'end', 'sentences', 'frequently', 'added', ""'you"", ""see'.And"", 'Swansea', 'Wales', 'locations', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'are', 'lovely', 'one', 'scene', 'local', 'play', 'put', 'venue', 'called', 'Glendower', 'Hall', 'Best', 'Video', 'lovers']",N/A

And then the mistress's dangerous driving which causes cars to go off the road as in the end chase scene of Panther. I want to see the whole movie and see what else Edwards stole.This was a very smart, clever, adult comedy, well-acted and cast. However, the woman who plays Seller's wife is much too pretty for any man to cheat on. I guess it was her dark hair which put him off? He needed a fat, sloppy shrew to play his wife, you know, the Rosanne Barr type!  I also wish it could have been made in color.Smart movie, apparently made a ton of money and Sellers, who had had no faith in it, sold off his shares before it came out.
