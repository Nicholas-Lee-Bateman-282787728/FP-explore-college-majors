There aern't enough words in the English dictionary to describe this atrocity! I tried, I mean, I REALLY TRIED to give this movie a chance but there was NOT ONE redeeming quality! The actors/actresses not only had FAR below poor acting skills, but were also beat severely with the ugly stick! I'm not a super shallow person or anything, I advocate the use of everyday-looking people in movies for a more authentic sense of quality, but when everyone in the movie looks like they came from a low-income, white-trash town in the Middle of Nowhere somewhere from the Midwest, you have to draw the line somewhere! I didn't have high expectations to begin with, in fact, I didn't have ANY! I even have an appreciation for some bad zombie movies, but this one just surpasses them all in how ridiculously stupid this was! I am a sucker for cover art and this lured me in to waste my $$$ AND time on this garbage. It looks like a film student's first project (I would grade this F- and ban that student from taking the rest of the class bc that motard obviously doesn't know anything about film making). I can't believe that some people found this at the very least tolerable, much less even enjoyable! Some other viewers stated that it is a good movie to watch when you're inebriated. WHAT WERE THEY DRINKING??? It must have altered their ability to recognize awfulness! AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! DON'T EVEN BOTHER RENTING OR ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADING!

1287308,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B002SLD27C,Howard M. Kindel,"[7, 7]","I may be the only reviewer who really liked ""Zombie Apocalypse"" - and needed no brew to help me form that opinion.  It's a terrific movie.  I've totally given up going by Amazon reviews for zombie movies - for other kinds of movies, especially sci-fi, the reviews are usually right on; but for zombie movies they're usually a million miles off the mark.  This movie was well made - I could see that from the very first scene.  It was dark, foreboding, dramatic and immediately piqued my interest.  That opening scene introduced both the main character - the action hero who dominated the movie - and his mysterious nemesis, who only re-emerged briefly about half way through then, finally, came to dominate the wrap-up.""Zombie Apocalypse"" was in some ways a zombie comedy as well as a traditional fight and flight flick.  But the comedy wasn't in your face funny; it was more subtle.  The action hero, who looked and sounded Hispanic, was named Dwight Miller - about as far from an action hero's name as from an Hispanic name.  The chick, named Raven, who eventually came to be the movie's heroine, started out as an airhead whose greatest concern was capturing the zombies on film - not the standard video film but regular point-and-shoot camera pictures, which she planned to work into a montage once this zombie attack was over.  Of course, she didn't realize then that zombie attacks are never over.  The two college guys, named Tom and Mark, were a kind of Felix and Oscar Odd Couple, the rational one always asking how doing such-and-such a stupid thing would help the situation.  Eventually, Dwight, Raven and the two college guys worked their way to a haven of survivors - led, not by a tough military man named Bull or Rope or Sarge but by a kid named Kevin - the very college freshman, in fact, who stole Mark's girlfriend.The climax of the movie was the inevitable fight to the death between Miller and his nemesis, named only Net.  The fight sequence was well staged, if a bit over-drawn, with Net first running Miller through with his own machete then pulling out one of his eyes.  But, not to worry, his wounds weren't fatal; but his fighting days, alas, were about over.Another thing just right about the movie was the music; and, as mentioned, the atmosphere - dark, creepy and, of course, heavily wooded - was perfect for a zombie movie.  And, as with any good zombie movie, the ending was ambiguous.  I'm sorry reviewers, but this was a really good movie.",4,To Each His Own,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2473,"['may', 'be', 'only', 'reviewer', 'who', 'really', 'liked', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'needed', 'brew', 'help', 'form', 'opinion', 'terrific', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'totally', 'given', 'up', 'going', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'zombie', 'movies', 'other', 'kinds', 'movies', 'especially', 'sci-fi', 'reviews', 'are', 'usually', 'right', 'zombie', 'movies', ""'re"", 'usually', 'million', 'miles', 'mark', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'could', 'see', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'dramatic', 'immediately', 'piqued', 'interest', 'opening', 'scene', 'introduced', 'main', 'character', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'dominated', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'nemesis', 'who', 'only', 're-emerged', 'briefly', 'half', 'way', 'then', 'finally', 'came', 'dominate', 'wrap-up', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'was', 'ways', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'traditional', 'fight', 'flight', 'flick', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'face', 'funny', 'was', 'more', 'subtle', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'looked', 'sounded', 'Hispanic', 'was', 'named', 'Dwight', 'Miller', 'about', 'far', 'action', 'hero', 'name', 'Hispanic', 'name', 'chick', 'named', 'Raven', 'who', 'eventually', 'came', 'be', 'movie', 'heroine', 'started', 'out', 'airhead', 'greatest', 'concern', 'was', 'capturing', 'zombies', 'film', 'not', 'standard', 'video', 'film', 'regular', 'point-and-shoot', 'camera', 'pictures', 'planned', 'work', 'montage', 'once', 'zombie', 'attack', 'was', 'over', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'then', 'zombie', 'attacks', 'are', 'never', 'two', 'college', 'guys', 'named', 'Tom', 'Mark', 'were', 'kind', 'Felix', 'Oscar', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'rational', 'one', 'always', 'asking', 'how', 'doing', 'such-and-such', 'stupid', 'thing', 'would', 'help', 'situation', 'Eventually', 'Dwight', 'Raven', 'two', 'college', 'guys', 'worked', 'way', 'haven', 'survivors', 'led', 'not', 'tough', 'military', 'man', 'named', 'Bull', 'Rope', 'Sarge', 'kid', 'named', 'Kevin', 'very', 'college', 'freshman', 'fact', 'who', 'stole', 'Mark', 'girlfriend.The', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'inevitable', 'fight', 'death', 'Miller', 'nemesis', 'named', 'only', 'Net', 'fight', 'sequence', 'was', 'well', 'staged', 'bit', 'over-drawn', 'Net', 'first', 'running', 'Miller', 'own', 'machete', 'then', 'pulling', 'out', 'one', 'eyes', 'not', 'worry', 'wounds', 'were', ""n't"", 'fatal', 'fighting', 'days', 'alas', 'were', 'over.Another', 'thing', 'just', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'music', 'mentioned', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'creepy', 'course', 'heavily', 'wooded', 'was', 'perfect', 'zombie', 'movie', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'ambiguous', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'reviewers', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

She joins the group. As fate would have it these 4 end up together. We find out the man in cuffs is some kind of government agent who was supposed to have been killed by the zombie attack. Mark has issues with his former roommate Kevin, who is sleeping with his gf, or ex-gf. Kevin looks like a young Val Kilmer.The movie has some real bad acting, like the bouncer at the bar who has ""SECURITY"" on his t-shirt. Fortunately the worse actors get eaten early. There seems to be a serious lack of guns for rural Michigan. There is one scene with some comical Dr. Evil diabolical laughter.
