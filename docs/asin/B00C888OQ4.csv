1644498,A1WDS3U185610U,B00C888OQ4,Aanel Victoria,"[6, 6]","Jake Shimabukuro is not a ""ukulele player"" -- he's a world-renowned musical virtuoso who blows away anyone who hears his music. He is in the same pantheon as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Bela Fleck, and even great classical musicians such as Yo-Yo Ma and Hilary Hahn. Jake, more than any musician I know of, transcends his instrument and creates pure music, touching the souls of his listeners.A well-kept (though award-winning) Hawaiian and Japanese secret until 2006, Jake burst upon the world stage when someone posted the now-famous video of him playing ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" on YouTube. The video instantly went viral, and Jake became a international star, receiving concert requests from around the world, and playing with and opening for such stars as Jimmy Buffett, Bela Fleck, Ziggy Marley, and Bette Midler, and being produced by Alan Parsons.All while retaining his youthful humility and disarming openness and lack of pretense. This movie is a lovely look into his life, both for Jake fans, and for those who have never heard of him. The film is by turns fascinating, jaw-dropping, inspiring, funny, touching, and moving. It's a well-rounded and expertly done piece of cinema by a very experienced Japanese-American documentarian, who strives to bring the human touch to his work. The film should appeal to anyone, regardless of age, nationality, or musical interest (or lack thereof). Jake's life alone is fascinating, never mind his brilliant music (which we are given glorious exposure to).Jake has a special connection with Japan, both through his heritage and because his longtime manager is from Japan. Thus, he's an even bigger star in Japan than in the U.S. Hopefully, this wonderful film will open the eyes of further music lovers in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.By the way, this hour-long documentary is viewable for free until August 8, 2013 on the PBS site.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[17, 17]","I saw this film yesterday at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia (coordinated by the Philadelphia Film Society).  It is making the round of film festivals now and is due on DVD in July 2013.I've followed ukulele prodigy Jake Shimabukuro's career of 11 years now (from his early albums with a band). Now he goes it alone and can hold an audience of 3,000 or more for two hours with just his ""jumping flea"" (English translation of the word ""ukulele). Watching this 58-minute film, made in 2011 and released in 2012, I still learned new things about Jake. We get to see his mother and brother as well as his new wife and his now-former manager, Kaz Flanagan. He's a father now but his son was born after the film was completed. Luckily Jake was filmed throughout his long career (he's only in his early 30s but started playing at age four.) and a lot of that footage was used by the filmmakers.If you know Jake and his music you'll really enjoy this film (I loved it!) and if you've only heard his name - or maybe are one of the THREE MILLION people who have seen the YouTube video of him in Central Park playing ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", then - after watching this film, you'll probably run out and buy Jake's CDs. And then tell your friends about it.I'm hoping there were be bonus performances when the DVD is released (and I'll update my review then) but , for now, catch it on the big screen if you have the opportunity.UPDATE (6/21/13): I've now seen the DVD and, sadly, there are no bonus features (even outtakes) included. I'm still giving the DVD five stars but sure wish they included full performances so you could watch on your TV in HD or at least big screen.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Playing Film Festivals now- On DVD in July 2013,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1774,"['saw', 'film', 'yesterday', 'WXPN', 'Music', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Philadelphia', 'coordinated', 'Philadelphia', 'Film', 'Society', 'making', 'round', 'film', 'festivals', 'now', 'due', 'DVD', 'July', '2013.I', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'ukulele', 'prodigy', 'Jake', 'Shimabukuro', 'career', '11', 'years', 'now', 'early', 'albums', 'band', 'Now', 'alone', 'can', 'hold', 'audience', '3,000', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'just', 'jumping', 'flea', 'English', 'translation', 'word', 'ukulele', 'Watching', '58-minute', 'film', 'made', '2011', 'released', '2012', 'still', 'learned', 'new', 'things', 'Jake', 'get', 'see', 'mother', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'wife', 'now-former', 'manager', 'Kaz', 'Flanagan', 'father', 'now', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'Luckily', 'Jake', 'was', 'filmed', 'long', 'career', 'only', 'early', '30s', 'started', 'playing', 'age', 'four', 'lot', 'footage', 'was', 'used', 'filmmakers.If', 'know', 'Jake', 'music', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'loved', ""'ve"", 'only', 'heard', 'name', 'maybe', 'are', 'one', 'THREE', 'MILLION', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'YouTube', 'video', 'Central', 'Park', 'playing', 'My', 'Guitar', 'Gently', 'Weeps', 'then', 'watching', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'Jake', 'CDs', 'then', 'tell', 'friends', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'were', 'be', 'bonus', 'performances', 'when', 'DVD', 'released', ""'ll"", 'update', 'review', 'then', 'now', 'catch', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'opportunity.UPDATE', '6/21/13', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'are', 'bonus', 'even', 'outtakes', 'included', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'sure', 'wish', 'included', 'full', 'performances', 'could', 'watch', 'TV', 'HD', 'least', 'big', 'screen.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Jake Shimabukuro: Life on Four Strings
