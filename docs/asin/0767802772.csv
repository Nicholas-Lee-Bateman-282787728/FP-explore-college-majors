7100,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0767802772,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","I was expecting this to be a mindless romantic comedy that would be fun to mock but it was really very good. Salma Hayek elevated the situation comedy hijinks to a much higher level with her portrayal of Isabel Fuentes--plus she is muy caliente. She flirts with Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), ostensibly to cut in line for the bathroom in a Las Vegas restaurant, and we learn that she is the youngest child in a family with five older brothers--a little headstrong, but down to earth, if a bit superstitious.Whitman is a typical Chandler Bing character, clever but self deprecating in his humor, and at least he has a cool job, as he is in Las Vegas to build and manage a night club. The name ""Whitman,"" just one letter away from Whiteman, should be a tip off that these fools are rushing in to a cultural clash of epic proportions, and that is exactly what happens when their one night stand results in pregnancy. The headstrong Isabel, who sneaked away the morning after, comes back to inform him that she is going to keep the child herself. She only wants him to meet her family so that afterwards, when they ask her who the father was, she can tell them that they already met him. She assumes that they will disapprove of him right off the bat, and so later they won't pressure her to marry him.Alex doesn't make such a great impression, but he keeps trying his best as he has fallen for the lovely senorita. The culture clash plays out against the backdrop of Las Vegas, but also the desert that Isabel and her familia love. You get the bright lights, big city with a Rat Pack soundtrack with Dean Martin; Viva Las Vegas and other tunes from Elvis; and Dankeshan from Wayne Newton; along with sizzling Latin sounds from Mariachi music to salsa for the desert scenes.

Matthew Perry shows very little range, simply playing Chandler without the rest of his friends.  It's not necessarily a knock on his acting prowess, he's simply delivering what the part called for.  Salma is as enticing as ever, and as a result, the chemistry suffers a little.  Chandler, all smarm and no charm, doesn't seem to deserve a woman as spectacular as Isabel (Salma).  The awkward chemistry doesn't necessarily take anything away from the film, but it doesn't really add any punch, either.  Chandler's parents actually bring a lot to the table in this film, especially his afternoon-alcoholic mother.

But, nonetheless, this is one of those romantic love stories with a touch of comedy and a whole lot of drama, like a soap opera, but only better. The plot centers around a consultant of an architectural firm, Alex (Matthew Perry), who, by fate, meets a single Mexican woman named Isabel (Salma Hayek). After spending the night together, Isabel becomes pregnant with Alex's child, but is quite shocked about the news at first, and isn't sure whether or not she wants to continue their relationship. As time progresses, the couple get to know each other better and Isabel introduces Alex to her family, the Fuenteses (including an angry chihuahua named Che, who, at first, displays an intense dislike for Alex, but softens up to him later), and, likewise, Isabel later meets Alex's parents. At first, their parents don't agree with the idea of Alex and Isabel going steady, because of the cultural differences of both families.

The result is marriage by osmosis; the somewhat anal Alex tries to adjust to the free-spirited Isabel.

On the surface, it seems like it doesn't.  But what would be the end result of watching this - would a person be more or less likely to start a relationship physically?

Isabel leaves before Alex wakes up and he doesn't see her again until she turns up on his doorstep and tells him she's pregnant.Although she doesn't want help, Alex eventually proposes and they get married, falling in love along the way.  The course of true love however, never runs smooth and they hit some hefty bumps during their marriage.They both come from very different backgrounds - him from Anglo and her from Mexican stock and this also provides good friction between both the characters and their relatives who all seem to want a say in how and where they should live.This probably sounds like a very dramatic film and in places it is.  But, there's also alot of outright laughs coupled with a more gentle humour that stops it all being too intense.Great piece of acting from Selma Hayek as the lovely Isabel who has a charming innocence and simplicity about what she wants from life.  You really feel what she goes through.And Matthew Perry is excellent as Alex who's life is practically ruled by his work to the point where it almost ruins everything. His comic touches are their usual high standard and his dramatic scene's are wonderfully touching.  If you look past the comedy, you'll notice what a great actor he really is.Both actors are fantastic together and the film has a lot of heart that takes the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.Definitely one to watch again and again, and look out for the part where Isabel takes Alex to meet her parents and entire family for dinner and he meets the ex-boyfriend - it's one of the quickest, funniest lines I've heard in a long time.",4,Lovely Romance,985824000,"03 29, 2001",2001,1708,"['really', 'liked', 'film', 'word', 'go', 'Alex', 'Isabel', 'meet', 'chance', 'have', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Isabel', 'Alex', 'up', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'up', 'doorstep', 'pregnant.Although', ""n't"", 'want', 'help', 'Alex', 'eventually', 'get', 'married', 'falling', 'love', 'way', 'course', 'true', 'love', 'however', 'never', 'smooth', 'hit', 'hefty', 'bumps', 'marriage.They', 'come', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Anglo', 'Mexican', 'stock', 'also', 'good', 'friction', 'characters', 'relatives', 'who', 'seem', 'want', 'say', 'how', 'where', 'should', 'live.This', 'probably', 'very', 'dramatic', 'film', 'places', 'also', 'alot', 'outright', 'laughs', 'coupled', 'more', 'gentle', 'humour', 'being', 'too', 'intense.Great', 'piece', 'acting', 'Selma', 'Hayek', 'lovely', 'Isabel', 'who', 'charming', 'innocence', 'simplicity', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'through.And', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'excellent', 'Alex', 'who', 'life', 'practically', 'ruled', 'work', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'everything', 'comic', 'touches', 'are', 'usual', 'high', 'standard', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'touching', 'look', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'really', 'is.Both', 'actors', 'are', 'fantastic', 'together', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'viewer', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'emotions.Definitely', 'one', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'look', 'out', 'part', 'where', 'Isabel', 'Alex', 'meet', 'parents', 'entire', 'family', 'dinner', 'ex-boyfriend', 'one', 'quickest', 'funniest', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'long', 'time']",N/A

Before he even knows it, she is gone, never to be heard from again, until she shows up on his door step three months later to announce that she is pregnant with his baby.Alex tells her that he supports her right to choose. Isabel chooses to have the baby. She asks nothing from him other than he meet her family, so that it is not such a shock when she announces that she is pregnant. He agrees to do so. He meets her traditional, Mexican-American family and is taken by their warmth, a quality that is sorely lacking in his family.

The first formula is for a couple to start off disliking each other and end up loving each other. The second is for the couple to meet, be tested by an adversity, overcome it and live happily ever after. And one thing these two formulas share in common too often is the rush to have sex.

The film focuses the trials and tribulations and cultural clash that follows a one-night stand in Vegas that leaves Isabelle Fuentes pregnant. Salma Hayek plays the fiesty Mexican-American photographer who hooks up with Alex Whitman (played by Matthew Perry), an uptight and nerdy WASP architect from New York City who is on a business trip in Nevada.Hayek and Perry both deliver outstanding performances, and despite the fact that this movie is a comedy, it also contains a few sentimental moments as well. The film's ending is predictable, but the movie itself does raise some important issues regarding inter-ethnic dating and marriage - such as dealing with parents and in-laws, inevitable culture clash, disputes over the child's religious upbringing, and societal prejudice.Men and women can equally relate to the events in the storyline. This film will resonate with anyone who has ever faced rejection from someone they were truly in love with; it will likewise resonate with those who have callously brushed aside someone who truly loved them.In the final analysis, this film works so well because Hayek and Perry are such total opposites.
