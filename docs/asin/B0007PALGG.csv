If you consider the human anatomy we are they only creature designed to make sex a satisfying physical and psychological activity.The two disc movie is the one to go for if you are interested in the background to Kinsey's life. He told people the truth and many of us as Jack Nicholson  once put it ""you can't handle the truth."" Liam Neeson gave a great performance as the socialy and physically awkward poineer in sex reserach. Laura Linney, was warm and powerful as his wife ""Mac"" and John Lithgow was superb as both the priggish father of the young Kinsey and the sour and frail old man who at last gives his son the clue as to why he was so alienated from the human race.Let me just suggest that self-alienation begins with genital-alienation argument was inflicted on Kinsey's father at 10. A man so soured by this horrible abuse that he could attribute the ""fall of the Roman Empire to, to frequent bathing,"" or claim ""that rapmant adultary was the cause of earthquakes.""This isn't telling much you about this wonderful film and nothing about  Carter Buewell's haunting music that conveyed so much of the sense of emotional  isolation people felt in not being able to discuss their deepest drives.We should not forget the casting of Tim Curry (Dr. Frank-N-Furter) as the stuffy Dr. Thurman Rice who thought he'd covered sex well enough in his sex hygiene class ~ the sort of tragic comic relief.At the end of the film when the embittered KInsey turns on Lynn Redgrave, his last interview when she says things have gotten a lot better and demands to know what happened to make things better.She takes his hand and replies, ""Why, you happened. You saved my life,sir.""Just get the film, you'll find it one of the most satisfying journeys of your life.",5,AM I NORMAL?,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1878,"['was', 'question', 'suggest', 'people', 'wanted', 'Kinsey', 'answer', 'course', 'human', 'powerful', 'sex', 'drive', 'consider', 'human', 'anatomy', 'are', 'only', 'creature', 'designed', 'make', 'sex', 'satisfying', 'physical', 'psychological', 'activity.The', 'two', 'disc', 'movie', 'one', 'go', 'are', 'interested', 'background', 'Kinsey', 'life', 'told', 'people', 'truth', 'many', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'once', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'truth', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'socialy', 'physically', 'awkward', 'poineer', 'sex', 'reserach', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'was', 'warm', 'powerful', 'wife', 'Mac', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'was', 'superb', 'priggish', 'father', 'young', 'Kinsey', 'sour', 'frail', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'last', 'son', 'clue', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'alienated', 'human', 'race.Let', 'just', 'suggest', 'self-alienation', 'genital-alienation', 'argument', 'was', 'inflicted', 'Kinsey', 'father', '10', 'man', 'so', 'soured', 'horrible', 'abuse', 'could', 'attribute', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'frequent', 'bathing', 'claim', 'rapmant', 'adultary', 'was', 'cause', 'earthquakes', ""n't"", 'telling', 'much', 'wonderful', 'film', 'nothing', 'Carter', 'Buewell', 'haunting', 'music', 'conveyed', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'people', 'felt', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'discuss', 'deepest', 'drives.We', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'casting', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Dr.', 'Frank-N-Furter', 'stuffy', 'Dr.', 'Thurman', 'Rice', 'who', 'thought', ""'d"", 'covered', 'sex', 'well', 'enough', 'sex', 'hygiene', 'class', 'sort', 'tragic', 'comic', 'relief.At', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'embittered', 'KInsey', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'last', 'interview', 'when', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'better', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'make', 'things', 'better.She', 'hand', 'replies', 'Why', 'happened', 'saved', 'life', 'sir', 'Just', 'get', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'journeys', 'life']",N/A

I saw it yesterday and was disappointed.I found the subject of sexuality and that period of time fascinating, the parallels between now and then telling, and Dr. Kinsey's character all very juicy. But the film weakly investigated all of them.Kinsey's passion for his subjects is amazing, but the rationale as it relates to the man was limp, (why the drive?). The obvious fear and irony which results from Dr. Kinsey and his colleague's discoveries not withstanding, what it meant to the world and who these people were remained uninteresting throughout. The historical place of Dr. Kinsey's work is left to us to acknowledge (or not), and that leaves doubts about the social depth of the film.I found the performances by and large suffered from poor character depth, and the make up and hair obvious and distracting. Liam Neeson is good, not great and Linney was limited by a scat investigation of her marriage and personality as well as their family's experience.Perhaps expectations got the better of me. 3 stars for the ""touchy"" subject, the subversive nature of which remains ironic, and dealing with sexuality and all its complexities on a public stage.",3,Un-satisfying,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,1240,"['am', 'bit', 'baffled', 'wide', 'ranging', 'pronouncements', 'excellence', 'Kinsey', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'was', 'disappointed.I', 'subject', 'sexuality', 'period', 'time', 'fascinating', 'parallels', 'now', 'then', 'telling', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'character', 'very', 'juicy', 'film', 'weakly', 'investigated', 'them.Kinsey', 'passion', 'subjects', 'amazing', 'rationale', 'man', 'was', 'limp', 'why', 'drive', 'obvious', 'fear', 'irony', 'results', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'colleague', 'discoveries', 'not', 'withstanding', 'what', 'meant', 'world', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'remained', 'uninteresting', 'historical', 'place', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'left', 'acknowledge', 'not', 'doubts', 'social', 'depth', 'film.I', 'found', 'performances', 'large', 'suffered', 'poor', 'character', 'depth', 'make', 'up', 'hair', 'obvious', 'distracting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Linney', 'was', 'limited', 'scat', 'investigation', 'marriage', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'experience.Perhaps', 'expectations', 'got', 'better', '3', 'stars', 'touchy', 'subject', 'subversive', 'nature', 'ironic', 'dealing', 'sexuality', 'complexities', 'public', 'stage']",N/A

Not because I found the material offensive in any way, but because I thought it would be boring -- I was wrong.  This film allows us an opportunity to understand the man who revolutionized the way in which we think about sex and gave conservatives a reason to howl (that alone is enough to enjoy the film).  One of the great things about this film is that the makers chose to present a full picture of Alfred Kinsey, warts and all.  We see this driven man who feels that society's attitudes towards sex are not only outdated, but unhealthy.  We also see how this man alientated the people around him, how he hurt his wife and children, and how he didn't see the emotional toll his research was taking on all those around him.  Liam Neeson gives his best performances in a very, very long time; Laura Linney is, as usual, fantastic; and the supporting cast is wonderful, chief among them Peter Sarsgaard as Kinsey's assistant and lover.

885983,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0007PALGG,Andrew Desmond,"[6, 10]","""Kinsey"" was a thoroughly absorbing film that I can recommend to serious movie goers.In brief, ""Kinsey"" documents the live of Alfred Kinsey, the American academic who spent the greater part of his life documenting the sexual habits of the American public.  He was no voyeur but a serious scientist trying to come to grips with human behaviour.  Of course, at the time (1940s and 1950s) Kinsey was regarded as a pervert by some of the more conservative local commentators.  In Australia, such people would be described as wowsers.  Yet they still exist today and seek to impose their own moral standards upon others.  The thought of freedom is anathema to them.  The American religious right is their present guise.  In the 1950s, they would have hidden behind the authority of McCarthyism.Liam Neeson who plays Kinsey is marvelous as is Laura Linney who plays his wife.  These two seem to have a real and plausible bond.  Their efforts should not go without recognition in due course.  The large supporting cast is also strong and the director is brilliant with his recreation of post war America.There are many who will not see this film due to their own moral ambiguities.  For the rest, make an effort to view this great work.  Freedom may seem scary to some.  It is, however, far better than the imposition of morals by those whose believe that they speak for a wider world.",5,Post War America Leaves the Closet,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1378,"['Kinsey', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'film', 'can', 'recommend', 'serious', 'movie', 'goers.In', 'brief', 'Kinsey', 'documents', 'live', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'American', 'academic', 'who', 'spent', 'greater', 'part', 'life', 'documenting', 'sexual', 'habits', 'American', 'public', 'was', 'voyeur', 'serious', 'scientist', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'human', 'behaviour', 'course', 'time', '1940s', '1950s', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'regarded', 'pervert', 'more', 'conservative', 'local', 'commentators', 'Australia', 'such', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'described', 'wowsers', 'still', 'exist', 'today', 'seek', 'impose', 'own', 'moral', 'standards', 'others', 'thought', 'freedom', 'anathema', 'American', 'religious', 'right', 'present', 'guise', '1950s', 'would', 'have', 'hidden', 'authority', 'McCarthyism.Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'Kinsey', 'marvelous', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'wife', 'two', 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'plausible', 'bond', 'efforts', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'recognition', 'due', 'course', 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'director', 'brilliant', 'recreation', 'post', 'war', 'America.There', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'due', 'own', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'rest', 'make', 'effort', 'view', 'great', 'work', 'Freedom', 'may', 'seem', 'scary', 'however', 'far', 'better', 'imposition', 'morals', 'believe', 'speak', 'wider', 'world']",N/A
885984,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007PALGG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","It's funny to me that in the year that has been labeled `the year of the biopic' it was the better of them all that was shunned by Oscar.  Sure, `Kinsey' is a very blunt and somewhat offensive biopic, but it is one of the better crafted and superbly constructed of the many that were dropped on us in 2004.  It is superior to `Finding Neverland' in the acting department; it is superior to `The Aviator' is its ability to grasp the sense of character and it is superior to `Ray' in its technical construction, allowing the audience to delve into Alfred Kinsey without hesitation.  The three aforementioned films all received a Best Picture nomination at the 2004 Oscars, and while I can't say that I would have nominated any of these films in that category (such a strong year fro film) I can honestly say that `Kinsey' is the better film overall*.The film tells the story of Alfred Kinsey, a professor who indulged his own sensual cravings by creating a study of human sensuality (it's really hard to write a review about this film when the most harmless of descriptive words can get your review banned).  His strict religious parents are much apposed to his lifestyle but this doesn't stop him from exploring a subject that so many see as taboo.  Enlisting the help of some eager young students (not to mention his understanding yet suppressed wife Clara) Kinsey interviews thousands of men and women for his study, asking very frank yet very pertinent questions.The film is much more than a film about sensuality, it is a film about humanity and the blinders that some of us put up in order to justify our passions.  As Kinsey pushes forward with his study he begins to push those around him away as the emotionally destructive course they set for themselves begins to crush in around them.  Kinsey finds himself unaffected by the emotional weight, but he cannot help but be affected by the distance between himself and lovers.Liam Neeson is outstanding as Kinsey, devouring whole this mans every inhibition.  He delivers one of the strongest performances of the year, so strong that it baffles me Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio and especially Johnny Depp received Oscar nominations over Neeson.  His sincerity and honesty is seen all over his face as the weight of his project begins to sink in.  Laura Linney (the sole Oscar nominee in the bunch) is very good here, if not a bit overrated.  I hate saying this, because she is lovely, but she is not the films standout.  She delivers a relatable and likable performance, but she tends to float out of focus when sharing the screen with the films other stars.  Chris O'Donnell actually turns out a very good performance, as does John Lithgow (who just shines with all sorts of blessed light) who portrays Alfred's father with tremendous power. Oliver Platt and Tim Curry and Timothy Hutton all take their limited roles and make them bigger than they really are......but I want to take a few minutes to bask in the greatness that is Peter Sarsgaard.  I mean, seriously, this young man may be the actor of our generation.  Every performance he has delivered has been strong and admirable, and yet the Academy still insists on snubbing him (from `Boys Don't Cry' to `Shattered Glass' to `Kinsey' and `Jarhead' this young man should be a four time nominee at this point).  His portrayal of Kinsey's lapdog Clyde is phenomenal.  His lusting for Kinsey is desirable and believable; his tenderness as a friend and lover is endearing and his frustrated feeling of betrayal is heartbreaking.  He delivers such a well rounded and grounded performance that I am ashamed he was snubbed come Oscar time.And then there is his ""would you like to?"" line to Kinsey in the hotel room; the single greatest line reading of the entire year.  That scene took my breath away, and that is not too easy to do.`Kinsey' is a very blunt film.  There are a lot of conversations and graphic depictions that may turn some heads and leave you feeling a little offended (there is one particular interview, one for which Wardell actually gets up and leaves, that left me feeling quite uneasy).  If you can look past the films in-your-face qualities though, you can see the beauty that lies within each frame.  This is one of those biopic's that gets it all right and delivers a truly satisfying and memorable movie experience.*Looking back over my reviews I noticed that I gave some pretty high ratings to the three Oscar nominated biopic's, none of which really deserved the love I showered on them.  I gave `Finding Neverland' an A, which is quite extreme.  I am not really hating myself for it (it is a children's biopic, and a very sweet family film) but it doesn't deserve five stars, maybe four would be better.

After he marries Clara McMillen (Laura Linney), or Mac for short, the virgin newlyweds discover some unanticipated problems while trying to consumate their relationship.  Kinsey is surprised that very few doctors are available, but he is even more surprised when he is unable to answer students' questions about sex, which is a natural and biological act.  So Kinsey decides to start researching human sexuality, and for about 15 years, he and his team of researchers (comprised of Peter Sarsgaard, Chris O'Donnell, and Timothy Hutton) go across the country interviewing tens of thousands of people about their sex lives.Other actors in this movie include John Lithgow as Kinsey's extremely conservative father (it was so strange to see Lithgow in such a serious role when pretty much the only other things I've seen him have been 3rd Rock From the Sun and Shrek), Dylan Baker as the head of the Rockefellar Foundation, and Oliver Platt as the President of Indiana University.I must admire the filmmakers of this movie; unlike many biopics, they neither portrayed Kinsey as a lunatic nor as a complete genius.  They were able to show both his strengths and his faults.  Also, they were able to prove some of Kinsey's points through the movie; I'm pretty sure most everyone I saw this movie with shifted in their seats at least once.  While this movie won't become a classic or anything like that (or obtain the praise of A Beautiful Mind, which I found some similarities to), I would still reccomend seeing this film... if you aren't easily offended.",4,Let's Talk About This Movie,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,2094,"['Let', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'are', 'even', 'slightly', 'offended/discomforted', 'people', 'talking', 'kind', 'sex', 'traditional', 'kind', 'nudity', 'homosexuality', 'anything', 'DO', 'NOT', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'subjects', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'relevant', 'are', 'focus', 'film.The', 'story', 'biologist', 'Alred', 'Kinsey', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'man', 'who', 'earned', 'degree', 'zoology', 'Harvard', 'went', 'teach', 'Indiana', 'University', 'movie', 'place', '40', '50', 'so', 'Bobby', 'Knight', 'fans', 'are', 'luck', 'Clara', 'McMillen', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Mac', 'short', 'virgin', 'newlyweds', 'discover', 'unanticipated', 'problems', 'trying', 'consumate', 'relationship', 'Kinsey', 'surprised', 'very', 'few', 'doctors', 'are', 'available', 'even', 'more', 'surprised', 'when', 'unable', 'answer', 'students', 'questions', 'sex', 'natural', 'biological', 'act', 'So', 'Kinsey', 'start', 'researching', 'human', 'sexuality', 'about', '15', 'years', 'team', 'researchers', 'comprised', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'go', 'country', 'interviewing', 'tens', 'thousands', 'people', 'sex', 'lives.Other', 'actors', 'movie', 'include', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Kinsey', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'strange', 'see', 'Lithgow', 'such', 'serious', 'role', 'when', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'been', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Shrek', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'head', 'Rockefellar', 'Foundation', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'President', 'Indiana', 'University.I', 'must', 'admire', 'filmmakers', 'movie', 'many', 'biopics', 'neither', 'portrayed', 'Kinsey', 'lunatic', 'complete', 'genius', 'were', 'able', 'show', 'strengths', 'faults', 'Also', 'were', 'able', 'prove', 'Kinsey', 'points', 'movie', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'most', 'everyone', 'saw', 'movie', 'shifted', 'seats', 'least', 'once', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'classic', 'anything', 'obtain', 'praise', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'found', 'similarities', 'would', 'still', 'reccomend', 'seeing', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'offended']",N/A
885986,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0007PALGG,Andy Orrock,"[4, 7]","The 'biopic' is always a risky chance in Hollywood.  Not too many draw big box office, and there's the risk of the creators - in wanting to jazz up the film - will start messing with the details of the character's live.  Most egregiously, we have the recent 'Finding Neverland,' in which Kate Winslet's character in real life was most decidely NOT widowed when J M. Barrie entered her life (which just blows the entire premise of the story out of the water, thank you very much).  And, thinking back, there was 'The Hurricane' in which the storytellers decided (I still can't figure out why they felt compelled to do this) that they had to somehow spice up an already incredible life by inventing a ficticious Patterson PD Detective called Sgt. Della Pesca (the excellent Dan Hedaya), who appears to nurse a serious grudge against the story's protagonist (ummm...that guy never existed; a problem, you think?).So, let's hear it for an honest biopic!  We should expect no less from the outstanding talent of Bill Condon.  His 'Gods and Monsters' is still one of my favorites.  The work ethic of 'Kinsey' is, apropos enough, much like its subject...indefatigable.  I love the way the movie builds the 'Kinsey' character well before the movie turns to sex.  In the first 45 minutes or so of the film, ""Kinsey"" focuses on the professor's obsessions with the gull wasp.  We see there the habits that later served him so well when it turned to matters of cataloguing sexual behavior.  This is wonderful movie-making.  This attention to detail and story-telling has to be rewarded.  Indeed, Condon's movie is showing up now on many Top 10 lists and deservedly so.The movie focuses a lot on an inner circle of Kinsey's researchers, played by an impressive trio of Timthy Hutton (underutilizied), Chris O'Donnell (good here, but wow, where did this guy go?) and - most notably - Peter Sarsgaard, who deserves an Oscar for bravery alone (love scene with Liam Neeson, and two Ewan MacGregor-style full frontal nudity scenes).  Interestingly, simultaneous to the movie's release, there's also T.C.

885990,AXA7OH47LBXZ7,B0007PALGG,"A Positive Guy ""Jay""","[0, 1]","but it can't be denied that Dr. Alfred Kinsey made some important contributions in our understanding of Sexuality.  This movie probably glosses over and rounds off some of the hard edges of the man and his work.Liam Neeson and Laura Linney play their parts superbly.  What struck me the most about this film was the way Kinsey doggedly and dogmatically went about his research-perfecting it in every way as the years went by.  His first volume ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" was probably accepted better than his follow-up ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" because America was a little more apt to admit that the men were, well just being men.  But when histories came out about women, it was shocking and scandalous.  I mean, didn't people think that females were so very different than men?  While I do believe there are subtle nuances between the two sexes, I think we are probably more alike than we like to admit, whether in 1948 or 2008.If Kinsey pushed the door open half-way with his work, the sexual revolution of the 1960's and the discovery of the birth control pill smashed it to pieces.  And where are we today?  I think it is a mixed bag.  Certainly to be more comfortable with our bodies, feelings etc., is a good thing.  Also the obnoxious moralizing from the Victorian era is largely a thing of the past.  By and large we seem more comfortable with ourselves.  We now know of the agendas of the closed-minded people who claimed to speak under the seal and shield of God and did so with authoritarian bigotry and for the most part, impunity.Yet we still exploit sex and do it more than we ever have.  We act as if it is not that big a deal and thereby trivialize it.  If there is anything to learn from the film and from Kinsey himself, it's that the controls must come from inside.  No attempt to legislate, engender guilt or shame, or any other force without is ultimately successful.  Sex can greatly and supremely enhance a person's life or destroy it.With Kinsey, science met humanity and it seemed a perfect marriage.  Yet, it still left some residual discomfort that is being felt to this day.  I think this movie says to us, ""Don't shoot the messenger.""  Kinsey simply shed light on a 'taboo' subject.  Was his research skewed?  That is argued to this day.  Was it mostly accurate?  I would say probably yes.  But ultimately, can we ever know with any certainty what goes on in our neighbor's head/bedrooms?Kinsey's work probably appealed to the voyeur inherent in a lot of people.  I am sure it liberated some people who desparately needed it.  In other cases I think it probably gave a certain 'license' to those who live on the fringe of society such as sex abusers, the emotionally unstable, and the libertine.  But with an atmosphere that was present in the late 1800's and early 1900's, who can blame everyday people for wanting to throw off the shackles of igornance and Puritanism?  Doctors-men of science dispensed some of the most idiotic and dangerous advice under the guise of keeping people 'pure.'  Today, all but the most ignorant and rabid fundamentalists accept the role of sex in a well-rounded person.When viewing this movie, remember the context and the frame of time in which it was set.  In some ways it is charmingly naive, and in others very frank and 'in your face.'  As Kinsey said, ""Love is the ultimate answer, but in the meantime, sex raises some very interesting questions.""

When he and Clara attempt to engage in sex for the first time after getting married, they find themselves very frustrated, as they don't know how the act is performed. They receive counseling from a sex therapist, and soon, Kinsey finds himself trying to be a therapist as well when students come to him for sexual advice. There is not too much information on the subject as Kinsey finds out, and as a scientist, he knows that there has to be answers somewhere. That is when he takes the opportunity of a lifetime: finding out about sex as nobody has really done before.He approaches the subject with utmost objectivity. Sex is a topic that is easily to have feelings and opinions about, and Kinsey knows that. It is amazing to see him talk about the subject and literally disregard all societal norms that make only monogamous heterosexual sex acceptable. That, along with his techniques to relax the people he interviews, helps him get to the truth. His years of research involve interviewing people from all over the United States with the help of his research team, including one of his students. The team asks the same series of 200+ questions to everyone they meet. With a large collection of sexual histories, Kinsey is able to produce a book about male sexuality that puts the subject in a whole new light.The film is both engrossing and enlightening about sexuality in the early 20th century. It does contain plenty of explicit content, including some depictions of masturbation and a brief homosexual kissing scene. Other than that, Kinsey is a film that is well made for the same reasons other biographical films deserve praise. It tells about a person who is strong and does not back down in the face of opposition.

885992,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0007PALGG,Benjamin,"[1, 3]","KINSEY, written and directed by Bill Condon, has the same things going for it that his previous works, GODS AND MONSTERS and CHICAGO (for which he wrote the screenplay) did. KINSEY contains more clever storytelling techniques, like the use of an interview-training session as a means to introduce flashbacks in the life of its subject matter, and crisp, funny dialogue. It's a fun movie that remains compelling, even though it's a biopic about a nerdy, bowtie-wearing zoologist.Of course, Alfred Kinsey was no ordinary zoologist. And the subject matter that he chose to study after finishing his examination of the gall wasp is the sort of thing that fascinates everyone, so this isn't a story of simple science. However, the film's approach to the science behind the study is what makes it most interesting.Liam Neeson is excellent as Kinsey, playing him as a man obsessed with experiments and studies. He's interested in studying behavior, finding and reporting facts and increasing knowledge. When it came to the study of sex, he found that there was a dearth of accurate information regarding it and no way to answer questions his students were posing, so he decided to come up with a list of questions that would give him an idea of what human beings actually do sexually.To do the study from a scientific perspective - and interviewing people without appearing judgmental, he thought, kept his work free from moral constraints.However, he wasn't entirely prepared for the impact his study would have on the culture. Or, on a smaller scale, his own sexual behavior or the behavior of his students.The film shows how the study came about, how the study changed Kinsey's life and his family's life - and the life of his co-workers.Peter Skaarsgard and Laura Linney, playing his closest associate and his wife, give excellent performances. Their characters both become involved in the study and show Kinsey that it's not entirely possible to separate sex from emotion. They also help him weather the many storms that his work causes once ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" is published.""Kinsey"" is a fantastic movie, well-written and well-acted.

885993,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B0007PALGG,Bitcetc,"[0, 0]","Wow. Whoa. Wow.Having just seen a preview of the movie, I may still be too engrossed in ""processing"" it to be fair to it on any level other than as an indie film based on a true story. There's far more to this film than that, but how much of it is understanding the impact that Alfred Kinsey, ""Prok"" (short for ""Professor K""), had on our society, and how much is the profundity of Liam Neeson's brilliant protrayal of the man, I am still sorting out.I felt an instant kinship with Kinsey the character at the beginning of the film. His fascination with the gall wasp because of each individual wasp's uniqueness is the same chord that drove me to major in biology in college. The fundamental truth of biology, as Professor Kinsey joyfully points out to his class, is that in the commonality of the species, the miracle of individual variation reigns. Yet that awe inspired by individual variation was the same drive that led him to try to describe the average, the median, and the mean of ""normal"" human sexual behavior.It also empowered him to conduct individual interviews with respect for the individual in a way that had never been contemplated before. I just read a very unintentionally funny ""conservative"" editorial criticizing the film for exalting a man whose scientific methods were so flawed. Criticize the man or the film on whatever moral grounds you choose, the fact is that Kinsey was a pioneer not only in gathering data about human sexual behavior, he was also a pioneer in developing  the methodology of gathering data by individual survey. Of course his methods were flawed! His surveying technique was all about ""on the job"" training, and he had to learn from his own mistakes. And many, many others, in other fields of endeavor, have learned both from his mistakes and from his successes.Showing the novelty of his ideas in an era of sexual repression; mentioning Edgar Hoover and the FBI both wanting to use Kinsey and to vilify him; and learning that it was the Rockefeller Foundation which initially funded his work, while his university was at first timid about sponsoring him; hearing his father's outrageously repressive sermons juxtaposed with Alfred Kinsey's insistence on plain if shocking words, not euphemisms, for sex, define his place in our culture by highly contrastive ideas and  experiences. It is clear that society wanted to know about sex; it is also clear that they didn't know how much more they wanted to know.Liam Neeson is so good that even a great fan of his, which I am, can forget they are watching Neeson the actor, and watch him give Kinsey, this odd, eerily ""objective"" scientific observer, a characterization which makes him completely, humanly real, and strangely charming. Kinsey's imperviousness to others' reactions to him is the strength that enabled him to pioneer studying a field that previously had not even been discussed in polite society.  The odd mix of courage and blindness to the outrage he left in his wake, the tactless curiosity and the respect for the individual that allowed his subjects to talk to him with fewer inhibitions than they had ever had, and the genuine love and caring he felt for his wife coupled with the self-righteousness he felt about his studies when his investigations into his own and others' feelings hurt her, were some of the  paradoxes that describe a man who thoroughly changed our culture. Whatever his studies showed, his legacy is that we can now talk about sex, and how profoundly that influenced the sexual revolution must be the study of historians, sociologists, and psychiatrists (not to mention politicians) everywhere.Neeson should almost certainly be on the  Oscar ""best actor"" nominee list. Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Kinsey's assistant Clyde Martin, will, I hope, finally receive an overdue nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Laura Linney as Kinsey's wife Clara McMillen is very, very good, but though there is ""Oscar buzz"" about her performance, and she is wonderful, I think her performance is slightly less awe-inspiring than Neeson's and Sarsgaard's. I enjoyed the ironic deliciousness of Tim Curry playing the professor who decried the salaciousness of Kinsey's work, and have come to depend on Oliver Platt to be good in good movies. Lynne Redgrave as the final interviewee was dessert, a little lagniappe on top of every other fine detail.The music was half-and-half; half very good, half ""off"" and distracting. The first minutes of the film which were not involved with the interview of Kinsey by his assistants were so disconnected that I had the sense the entire movie would be jumpy, which it was not: it was fascinating. I don't know that we needed quite so many young Kinseys to illustrate his growing up, but that is a very small flaw in a very good movie. Not only did I enjoy the movie, I learned from it.

Considered a pioneer, Kinsey threw himself into his work, bringing several ""taboo"" practices into his own marriage and into the lives of his co-workers, students and assistants.Hailed as a genius for some time, his work eventually suffered a serious backlash - not only in society, but also within the close relationships he had developed with his co-workers, colleagues, and peers.It would be some time afterwards that he was once again respected for the work and research he dedicated his life too.Kinsey is an intriguing, fascinating portrait all the way around.

However, if the facts of the movie are largely true, it seems that Kinsey fell victim to the same basic fallacy as Ayn Rand. Kinsey seemed to believe that just because something - in this case sex - can be described and studied objectively, that it can and should be practiced objectively. For example, Kinsey plunged into a homosexual affair with his assistant - with his wife's full knowledge - because he wanted to explore a side of himself he felt he had been repressing. His wife seems quite hurt by the revelation, but later she embarks on an affair with the same assistant when he tires of her husband,apparently with Kinsey's encouragement. Maybe this worked for the Kinseys, but for most people this type of behavior would break a relationship. It also seemed odd that Kinsey was as insistent and preachy about adults being sexually liberated as his father had been with the opposite viewpoint, ultimately alienating his own son just as his father had alienated him.In the long run Kinsey's work was key to decriminalizing all kinds of sexual behavior that had been considered deviant up to that time.

B Collins Jr.,"[4, 8]","It is amazing that even after 50 years, Kinsey's research remains controversial and outrages conservatives in this country.Yet, as this DVD reveals, Dr. Kinsey used scientific methodology to uncover behaviors that were hidden and repressed by societal taboo.There were 3 major strenghts to the film:First, I thought the DVD of Kinsey did a great job of demonstrating the power of observational science, whether in the biological sciences, anthropology, sociology or psychology. To some extent Kinsey's work uses methodology from all four of these academic disciplines. The film even made such topics as questionnaire development interesting.Second, the film did a great job of discussing the basic sexual knowledge that Kinsey was able to detect, including the vast range of sexual orientations, behaviors, erotic responses, and especially the fluid nature of sexual attraction and behavior over the human life span.His two major works, Sexual Behavior in hte Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953) were groundbreaking. In the sciences we are most concerned with whether a hypothesis leads to new understanding, further refined questions and the generation of new hypotheses. Even though Kinsey was not correct on all counts, his work lead to new understanding that actually was of great benefit to a large number of people over the years.Third, the film gave an accurate and realistic view of the way moralistic crusaders will demonize and try to destroy anyone who threatens their power over the thoughts of their fellow citizens. Kinsey's research continues to be a threat because he grounded his work in biology rather than theology.

While it doesn't point any fingers, it slightly eludes to the fact that our parents and grandparents are to blame for the outbreak of S.T.D.'s in America because of their not explaining the risks of sex to their children and instead condemning any kind of sexual act.While this movie might serve well as a good movie, it lacked passion from the characters and in the end I found myself not really caring about Kinsey or his wife.

Though Alfred Kinsey was a brilliant scientist who collected and catalogued thousands of gall wasps, and wasn't too shabby on the piano, either, even the smartest people have blind spots. One of his was that he couldn't accept that his son was more interested in athletics than science, and he was repeating the pattern of his own father, who also tried to force him into a mold that he didn't fit. Mac, his wife, played by Laura Linney, could see this plainly, as well as many other quirks and blind spots, but she loved him just the same. For instance, when he turned his attention from wasps to human sexuality she could see that the reaction of society at large would make things very difficult, but she stood by him nevertheless. Linney is very good at playing the understanding wife, as her performance as Abigail Adams in John Adams adamantly demonstrates.""Kinsey"" paints a portrait of a scientist, and it also places him in an historical context that shows how his groundbreaking work changed things forever. Kinsey thought he was a rational scientist who just wanted to measure and record things, but with a subject like human sexuality he was opening a Pandora's Box that would have a devastating effect on him, his family, and his colleagues on the project; not to mention the country, and the whole world. Such a provocative subject made for a fascinating film.Along with the excellent performances by the two leads there was ample support from John Lithgow, as Kinsey's father; and Tim Curry, who played Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the cult film ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in an ironic twist, as a priggish professor who undercuts the progressive ideas of Kinsey at every opportunity. Oliver Platt plays a more supportive faculty member. Peter Sarsgaard, Timothy Hutton, and Chris O'Donnell play research assistants who can't help but bring their work home on occasion.----------Alfred Kinsey: Mac, did I ever tell you about the Mbeere?Clara McMillen: No, not that I recall.Alfred Kinsey: They're an ancient East African tribe.

Alfred Kinsey went from studying bugs to teaching, and studying about sex; all the while he goes from not having sex untill after he's married, to openly engaging and encouraging non-emotionally connected sex acts, including some of his own on the bisexual nature. Ultimently, for all the controvesry of whether he abused children (which I believe were false rumors creaded by ultra-religous purists), to his questionable researching methods, he may have done the best sex study ever in our history. By using up close interviews, as non-judgemental as possible, with thousands of subjects, he closed the limited, though certainly didn't eliminate all together, the fact that when people are asked about sex they often lie. Ultimently, however, he was mocked and brought down, and his study was never completed the way he hoped, as society seemed still not ready.Liam Neason, as Kinsey, gives one of the best performances of his career. Kinsey was a pretty dull man, but he's depicted with pure underlying emotion, from be secluded in his bug days, to being a pioneer of sex that believed strongly in what he was doing. Laura Liney, as his wife, is also great as a woman who finds it in her heart to love him and stay with him despite questionable permiscuity. Actors like Chris Odonald, Peter Sarsgaurd, and John Lithgow as Kinsey's conservative father, among others round out an exceptionally casted flick with a strong screenplay behind it. The time line the movies flows with is a bit unorthodox, as years pass without ever realising it, but it still works due to the direct, meaningful nature every scene encompases.How much one appreciates this movie should not be directly connected to how much one appreciates Kinsey himself. It's a story about breaking boundaries at a time when many weren't ready, and about a person who took to a new style of thought that even today many would find objectionable.

That said, it's not a particularly good film, either. This is the follow up film to Condon's Gods And Monsters, and where that film, about Frankenstein director James Whale, made the good choice to focus only on a small portion of its subject's life, this film, again, makes the predictable error of trying to be far too encompassing. It also is awash in Freudian psychobabble, trying to pin sex researcher Alfred Kinsey's sex obsession on, variously, his stern father (John Lithgow, who was woefully miscast)- who is later revealed as having suffered sexual humiliation for a boyhood masturbation fetish, his sexually inexperienced wife Clara McMillen- aka Mac (Laura Linney), and his own latent bisexuality, among many causes. Kinsey's sex research from the middle of last century has made both it and its compiler the subject of controversy. The fallacious claims he made about ten percent of the population being homosexual have long been debunked, and serious errors he made in compiling information, as well as poorly selected study subjects is well known. However, discrediting the man's scientific prowess has not been enough for many on the reactionary Right. Latter day myths about Kinsey's involvement in pedophilia and child abuse in researching childhood sexuality have no basis in fact, and the person, Dr. Judith Reisman, who first made the claims in 1981, then followed up with a whole 1990 book, called Kinsey, Sex, and Fraud, co-written with Edward Eichel, was proved to be the liar. The Kinsey Institute denied the charges, Reisman filed a defamation lawsuit in 1991 against them, but, in1994, the suit was dismissed with prejudice, means Reisman cannot refile- de facto meaning her suit was nonsense.

Masturbation, intercourse with small animals, tongasaming your boyfriend's best friend...it was all hush-hush. Wait. Huh. Actually that time sounds a lot like nowadays. Anyway, though, insofar as society has changed, much of the credit for the country's sexual great awakening can be traced back to the work of one pioneering academic, the fearless, mild-mannered, bowtie-clad Alfred Kinsey.Bill Condom's, I mean, Condon's well-made Kinsey is one of those biopics that tells the truth but leaves out enough selective facts to come off as more than a little disingenuous. (For instance, ever read about Kinsey's research into sex responses in infants? Well you won't hear about it in this film.) Liam Neeson and the great Laura Linney do expectedly well here, and I think Neeson's portrayal of the scholarly Kinsey nailed the man to a T (based on everything I've read about him). Chris ""Please Don't Call Me Robin"" O'Donnell took a bullet for the team and placed a passionate half-minute-long liplock on Neeson, his onscreen mentor, and also bravely bared his dingle, showing men of small stature everywhere that it's OK to be a good-looking guy with a small caliber tool. In fact, ""it's OK to be you...and to go have sex while you're at...then talk about the sex"" pretty much sums up Kinsey the man and Kinsey the movie.Go see this thing.

886008,AQ990HW13DP08,B0007PALGG,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[7, 9]","In 1938 Alfred Kinsey, a young Harvard-trained zoologist whose speciality was the gall wasp, took over a course on ""marriage"" at Indiana University and, based upon his relentless curiosity and unapologetically scientific treatment of the subject, turned the class into something akin to sexology. He subsequently published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), based upon 18,000 sexual histories he and his staff collected. For the first time ever, sex was scientifically-situated. This biographical dramatization reminded me of Ray, in the sense of an overwhelming human force who grappled with a perennial subject and in the process shaped American culture. The main message of the film, if it has one, seems to be that repression and taboo melt in the light of frankness and tolerance of difference, no matter how quirky: ""We are the recorders and reporters of facts--not the judges of the behaviors we describe,"" insisted Kinsey. But the film is careful to show in some deeply painful moments like pedophilia, sex encouraged among staff members, Kinsey's bi-sexual experimentation, and broken marriages that human sexuality is far more, and more complex, than the mere scientific documentation of its parts. Fidelity, intimacy, integrity and love define sexuality as much as our habits.

This docu-drama showcases the work of Dr. Kinsey and his staff as they researched individual sex histories of Americans during the past 6 decades. Liam Neeson who plays the part of Alfred Kinsey, does a remarkable job in his portrayal of the famed researcher. He is backed by an awesome cast to make this movie a standout in the 2004 box office lineup.There is something in this film for absolutely everyone unless you just simply have no interest whatsoever in sex (of some kind). Casting, acting, video and audio quality, scenery, props, the whole works are top notch and the story is very well expounded in this production.

After watching this movie, it seemed even more timely considering the current political climate, with the pendulum swinging back to the conservative right.  Bill Condon starts us early on in Kinsey's life, seeing young Alfred living under the overbearing eye of his father (played wonderfully by John Lithgow).  Through glimpses of his past we see Kinsey's father preaching against the dangers of immorality and how badly he treated his own family.  Alfred finally breaks free of his father's grasp, leaving the university his father approves of and attending another to study his true love, biology.By the time he is teaching in college, Kinsey is extremely dedicated to his study of biology but neglectful of his own life.  Eventually he meets ""Mac"", his wife (played by the conisistently entertaining Laura Linney).  After trouble during their first sexual experience and realizing the problems other people face in sexuality, Kinsey becomes interesting in studying human sexuality.  Once he begins teaching, his classes fill up and his dedication to statistics and data intensify as he and the students who work with him delve through America's sexual diversity.Kinsey utilizes the gay community to tap into an unused resource of sexuality and begins to break through such taboo subjects as oral sex, extra marital sex, etc.  Once he begins transversing the country, his data gets grows and his published work of male sexuality becomes a best seller.The film is full of good performances.  Neeson in the main role does a good job, presenting a man that is so consumed by facts and statistics that he often looks over the emotional facets of sexuality.  His portrayal is charming and one of his best to date.  Laura Linney, again gives a really good performance.  She is an oft overlooked actress who deserves to be recognized by the academy.  Peter Saarsgard is also good as the student who seduces Kinsey and gives him his first homosexual experience.  Tim Curry, John Lithgow, Timothy Hutton and Chris O'Donnell also do good jobs in their roles.  One standout in those ""subjects"" who are questioned, is Lynn Redgrave as on older lesbian.  The scene she is in, though very short, pretty much sums up how his information helped society better understand sexuality and gave those who were not considered ""normal"" hope that there were others out there just like them.I highly recommend this film.

886013,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0007PALGG,David Anderson,"[6, 9]","""Kinsey"", starring Liam Neeson and Laura Linney, explores the true story of sex researcher Dr. Alfred Kinsey.  It received three Golden Globe nominations and one Oscar nomination for 2004.  As Kinsey discovers more information on the truths about sex, many people around the country either loved him or hated him.  Regardless, everybody knew who he was in the early to mid 1900's.  His teachings as a professor influenced his students and his audiences.  Meanwhile, some people try to stop him from continuing his studies.  Through everything, he stays true to his word and works harder to teach people that sex is perfectly natural.  In fact, some sex acts which some consider taboo are performed much more often than they think.Bill Condon directed and wrote this film brilliantly.  Much of it was adapted from Kinsey's books ""Sexual Behavior In the Human Male"" and ""Sexual Behavior In the Human Female"".  Through the exploration of Kinsey's discoveries, it unveals how he became so influencial to millions and how he compiled the information.  This film presents these details in a graphic sense that forces audiences to step out of their comfort zone.  Many other film creators have been hesitant to express these sexual desplictions in this manner.  All are necessary to share Kinseys methods and inner thoughts.  Beyond the autobiographical details is the emotional value placed within the characters and the storyline.  It shows the struggles the many of the lead characters endured during this life journey, namely through the family.  Therefore, the inner intentions are presented well.Liam Neeson plays Dr. Alfred Kinsey beautifully.  Words cannot possibly describe his wonderful performance in this film.  Neeson's research for his role is obvious as he mastered many of Kinsey's real-life mannerisms.  The emotional value through Kinsey's actions are beautifully acted.  Equally impressive is Laura Linney's performance as Alfred's wife, Clara Kinsey.  Through the last few years, she's evolved greatly as an outstanding actress.  This film and ""P.S."", also of 2004, proves the extent.  Though all the other performers present their strengths greatly through their roles (Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, Dylan Baker, Tim Curry, Peter Sarsgaard, and others), Neeson and Linney stand out.Such tremendous film quality makes ""Kinsey"" worth watching multiple times.  New film details (there are several) will be discovered through multiple viewings.

886014,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0007PALGG,David E. Levine,"[5, 9]","Alfred Kinsey was a pioneer in the study of human sexuality. He was a professor at Indiana University and spent the first 20 years of his career studying an insect, the ""gall wasp."" This movie, starring Liam Neeson in the title role, depicts Dr. Kinsey as having an obsession with his study of the gall wasp, collecting hundreds of thousands of specimens and devoting his life to studying this species. Tapped to teach a course on marriage and the family, Kinsey developed an interest in human sexuality and he bacame as obsessive in this study as he was in his earlier endeavor. He was driven and pushed his staff hard. He employed interviewers who spoke with thousands of people in taking sexual histories. Kinsey was very hands on as he personally instructed his staff on how to put subjects at ease as they conducted the interviews.Dr. Kinsey was the son of a morally strict father, convincingly played by John Lithgow. Neeson's depiction of Dr. Kinsey shows the results of this upbringing. His characterization of Kinsey comes across as very stiff and uptight. He is not one to really let his hair down yet, in his groundbreaking study, there is no taboo that he is unwilling to explore. Indeed, he explores his own sexuality as he has an extramarital gay affair. Despite serious misgivings at first, his wife, played by Laura Linney, is accepting.The studies were very controversial, having been done in the 1940s, long before the ""sexual revolution."" Some people found his findings to be very liberating in that they discovered that they were not alone in their sexual feelings. Other people were shocked, believing that the subject was taboo and should not be discussed. There is one brief scene in which a woman, who agonized over her lesbian inclinations, was liberated by Dr. Kinsey's findings and, thereby allowed herself to enter into a relationship. Others, including Kinsey's father, were scandalized.

To be blunt, this movie presents a false picture regarding this controversial figure.  And there is simply no excuse for this to occur.

Laura Linney, Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard are all superb in their roles, at least as far as the script permits them to be.  But the script is problematic.  I think writer-director Bill Condon went out of his way to mollify the religious-conservative anti-Kinsey forces both by showing flaws in Kinsey's character (which are interesting to know about) and by failing to really give a good, proper context for Kinsey's work and his impact on American society.At the film's start, we get a sense of how literally in the dark young people were about sexuality at the start of the 20th Century, with little idea of how to have sex, and tremendous free-floating fear about its consequences.  While venereal disease was common then (as it is now), other maladies, such as onanistic blindness were pure fiction, scare stories to keep kids from getting ""in trouble.""  Kinsey's research unravelled many negative myths about sexuality, while also paving the way for the so-called Sexual Revolution of the '60s and '70s, a tectonic shift in societal mores that had many consequences, both positive and negative.  Where this movie fails, though, is in placing Kinsey's work inside the continuum of social change -- the impact he had is alluded to, but not really fleshed out.  Midway through the film, for example, you realize that although Kinsey's character is now globally famous, you have no idea what decades various scenes are taking place in... Kinsey published his first landmark volume in 1948 and he died in 1956, but you'd never know it from watching this film.  No chronological signposts are given, no reference made to any events outside of Kinsey's personal and professional circles, no sense of what is happening in the world around them, and this microcosmic approach undercuts the viewer's ability to grasp what Kinsey's legacy was really about.  Also, the portrait of Kinsey as an emotional cripple seems a little overblown; I don't know much about his personal life, but the way this played out in the film rang false and flat... It just didn't work as well dramatically as it might have, though again Neeson does a fabulous job making this version of Kinsey live onscreen.Obviously a man who would undertake such a gigantic statistical survey as his life's work was a person of immense personal power and drive, but we don't really see that man here... I think there is value in acknowledging the flaws of historical figures, but this film wallows in Kinsey's flaws, and glosses over his importance in a strange, subtle way.

Also fascinating are the depictions of a world not-too-long past where sexuality was taboo, and everyone was pretty much ""in the closet"" as regards that part of life. This movie provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on how this modern world, with the drawbacks it undoubtedly has, is at least blessed in that we can be more open and honest about these most basic and human topics. It gives us a chance to thank the people who made such a transition possible, and enlarge the scope of tolerance.I am glad for this movie. It had to be made.However, the execution of the film leaves a little something to be desired. Not the acting--the acting is fine. But (and whether it happened in the writing or the directing or editing room, I don't know), the movie itself is all over the place. There are needless flashbacks, and needless black and white sequences, and the pacing is inconsistent. Also, there seems to be no climax (pun unintended). The movie just sort of ends, without answering the questions that it appears to ask. Instead of being one film with beginning, middle and end, Kinsey appears to be a string of vignettes revolving around the man and his work.

886023,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B0007PALGG,dooby,"[9, 12]","This is a fine biopic on the pioneering sex researcher of our time. It focuses mainly on Kinsey's efforts to produce his two seminal studies ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" (1948) and ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" (1953). It also gives brief glimpses as to why he chose this particular career path. Kinsey was born into a strict Methodist family with a Preacher for a father and the expectation that he himself would follow in the same footsteps. Kinsey spurned his father's ambitions for him and proceeded to study the biological sciences. After earning degress in biology, psychology and finally entomology, he took up an apparently harmless pursuit - the study of gall wasps, before assuming a research/teaching post at Indiana University where he was appalled when confronted with the almost laughable sexual ignorance of the undergraduates. That set him off on his groundbreaking studies on human sexuality. What he unleashed was a sexual revolution in America that outraged conservatives and set moralists on a crusade to demonise him in every way they could. How telling that this film, based on events of fifty years ago, still resonates and divides audiences today. It is a sad comment on our times that we still confront the same issues that Kinsey did over half a century ago.Liam Neeson is excellent as the awkward, wooden, diffident, even brusque Kinsey who nonetheless had the ability to put total strangers at ease and have them openly volunteer intimate secrets to him. Laura Linney is equally good as his wife who with her warmth and obvious love for the gangly older man becomes the emotional foil for the movie. Although it delves into a topic that can easily descend into salaciousness, it does not. Neither is it a dry biography. It is engaging throughout due to the general excellence of the combined cast. Don't miss the two minute long cameo near the end by Lynn Redgrave where she gives a quiet yet stunning performance as a study-participant who thanks a dejected Kinsey for saving her life. In his accompanying director's commentary, Bill Condon hails her performance as a masterclass in acting. Towards the end, one of his proteges, Clyde Martin asks Kinsey where love figures in all this obsession with sex, and Kinsey replies that as love cannot be measured or quantified, it is something that science cannot in the end explain. This segues into the lovely final sequence, a poetic evocation and affirmation of love, with the elderly couple walking off amongst the majestic redwoods of California's Muir Wood. It holds a double meaning for viewers who know that Kinsey visited the Muir Wood just before his death.If you intend buying this, I would recommend getting the 2-disc Special Edition. The only reason to buy the standard edition would be if you want to watch it in fullscreen pan & scan format. And this movie is definitely not meant to be viewed in pan & scan. The film with its lovely cinematography by Frederick Elmes, has been given an excellent transfer to DVD in its original 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio. Picture quality is very good, the print is clean and sharp. Black levels are just right. Audio is in DTS 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 with alternate French and Spanish tracks in Dolby 2.0. As this is a dialogue driven movie, the surround audio benefits mainly the music score which blossoms with an understated, quiet majesty.Extras begin with an excellent director's commentary on the first disc. On the second disc, the bulk of the material is the 1hr 23min long documentary, ""The Kinsey Report: Sex On Film"" which could have benefited from some judicious trimming but gives a fairly good background to the making of the film as well as the controversy that Kinsey stirred fifty years ago and the angst that he still engenders today. It details the efforts by outraged moralists to get the film stopped just as fifty years ago they tried to get his studies dropped. It debunks the ""information"" put forth by Kinsey opponents who have labelled him everything from a Nazi to a pedophile. It mentions Dr Judith Reisman (PhD in Communications) of RSVPAmerica (Restoring Social Virtue & Purity to America) who has become a hero of the Right in her quest to demolish Kinsey and his findings. Actually there is more inflammatory material here in the documentary than in the main feature. There is an accompanying 6 minute tour of the Sex-Ed. collection at the Kinsey Intitute. There are 20 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, including the cheaper alternate ending (before they got a larger budget) which closes with the elderly Kinseys sitting on a bench in New York's Gramercy Park instead of walking off through the majestic redwood forests of California. All the interview sequences which were stripped from the middle of the movie are found here. Among the deleted scenes is a very good one which shows Kinsey's death, just after the millionaire, Huntington Hartford, turns down his plea for financial aid, and how his three proteges subsequently continue his work, beginning with a publicity interview given to the New York Times. There is a three minute long gag reel which is quite funny. There are three theatrical trailers. And there is an Interactive Sex Questionnaire, titled ""Turning On, Turning Off"" - ""How easily are you aroused, how easily inhibited?"" You get the chance to assess how easily aroused or inhibited you are based on the Kinsey Institute's latest ""Dual Control Model of Sexual Response"". After answering 45 questions, it places your personal score on a distribution curve of other prior survey participants. Not particularly useful but a pretty fun gimmick nonetheless.

886026,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007PALGG,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","Since its publication 56 years ago, the Kinsey Report (real title: ""Sexual Behavior of the Human Male"") has taken on mythic proportions for its groundbreaking look at never-before-examined human sexual habits. Dr. Alfred Kinsey is certainly worthy of a film biopic, and writer-director Bill Condon embraces the idea with a healthy respect for his subject, a strong sense of period atmosphere and the same wry sense of humor he displayed in his fanciful James Whale tale, ""Gods and Monsters"". Condon effectively uses as a black-and-white framing device, the preparation for the interview process by which Kinsey and his staff surveyed people about their sexual habits. The director shows how Kinsey painstakingly teaches his research team how to get their hundreds of interview subjects to open up and speak freely about their sexual histories and as a result, revolutionized the way we think about sex. But Condon does not shy away from the double standards that exist to this day regarding the candor and explicitness of Kinsey's findings. What resonates most is how Kinsey strove to break down barriers and taboos and social conventions, and yet, he continues to be a flashpoint for the religious right as the instigator of the sexual revolution and the downfall of morality. One rather major flaw with the film is that Condon chose not to provide more of the historical context of Kinsey's work for the uninitiated, much is assumed on the part of the viewer. The film also falters somewhat during the darker denouement after Kinsey falls ill, but overall it's a story that stirs passion and initiates debate. Just exactly Kinsey would have wanted.The acting by the two leads is superb and unexpected. Liam Neeson gives a fierce, fearless performance in the title role, an obsessive-compulsive biologist who doesn't bat an eyelash when he translates the methodology he used in studying gall wasps into his forbidding survey of human sexuality. Neeson pitches his characterization between eccentric and megalomaniac and lets the doctor's maddening genius pour out of him without caution. As his plainspoken wife, Clara McMillen, Laura Linney continues to solidify her reputation as one of our finest actresses. She imbues what could have been a passive role with a searching intelligence as she willingly stands by her brilliant husband but not without injecting her own sensibilities into their marriage. She and Neeson manage a terrific rapport based on a mutual respect and intellectual fascination. They play out their first sexual experience with honesty and conviction, though truthfully, both are way too long in the tooth to be credible as college students early in the story. Critics' darling Peter Sarsgaard seems to be continuing his upward career trajectory with his subtle, often incisive portrayal of Clyde Martin, the bisexual researcher who successfully seduces both Kinsey and his wife but ultimately falters when he marries and finds his wife cheating on him.Familiar faces round out the cast and not always for the better. As Clyde's fellow research colleagues, Chris O'Donnell is the swaggering Wardell Pomeroy and Timothy Hutton is the slick, mustachioed Paul Gebhard, but neither leaves that much of an impression since their characters are designed as male archetypes rather than full-blooded characters. Oliver Platt plays his usually facile, comic self as Kinsey's one consistent supporter, Indiana University president Herman Wells, especially when Kinsey's work became too notorious for public figures to become sponsors or even to associate with him. Tim Curry seems to be making fun of his own Rocky Horror past by playing an uptight professor jealous of Kinsey's success. I think the weakest scenes in the film are the predictably drawn flashbacks to Kinsey's childhood, when he experienced an unfulfilled crush on an Eagle Scout, masturbated in shame and eventually left home in rebellion against a brutally puritanical father. The father is played with fire-and-brimstone fury by John Lithgow, who seems to be channeling the same role he played in ""Footloose"" twenty years ago. The scene where he reveals his own sexual secrets years later with his son seems particularly contrived. And in little more than cameo roles that turn into memorable turns, the film includes William Sadler as a sexual satyr, John McMartin as philanthropist Huntington Hartford and Lynn Redgrave as a lesbian thankful to Kinsey for his research. Highly recommended despite its flaws for anyone interested in how the so-called sexual revolution started.",4,Sexual Revolution Begins in Earnest in Fascinating Biopic,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,4562,"['publication', '56', 'years', 'ago', 'Kinsey', 'Report', 'real', 'title', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'taken', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'groundbreaking', 'look', 'never-before-examined', 'human', 'sexual', 'habits', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'film', 'biopic', 'writer-director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'idea', 'healthy', 'respect', 'subject', 'strong', 'sense', 'period', 'atmosphere', 'same', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'displayed', 'fanciful', 'James', 'Whale', 'tale', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'Condon', 'effectively', 'black-and-white', 'framing', 'device', 'preparation', 'interview', 'process', 'Kinsey', 'staff', 'surveyed', 'people', 'sexual', 'habits', 'director', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'painstakingly', 'research', 'team', 'how', 'get', 'hundreds', 'interview', 'subjects', 'open', 'up', 'speak', 'freely', 'sexual', 'histories', 'result', 'revolutionized', 'way', 'think', 'sex', 'Condon', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'double', 'standards', 'exist', 'day', 'regarding', 'candor', 'explicitness', 'Kinsey', 'findings', 'What', 'most', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'strove', 'break', 'down', 'barriers', 'taboos', 'social', 'conventions', 'yet', 'be', 'flashpoint', 'religious', 'right', 'instigator', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'downfall', 'morality', 'One', 'rather', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'Condon', 'chose', 'not', 'provide', 'more', 'historical', 'context', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'uninitiated', 'much', 'assumed', 'part', 'viewer', 'film', 'also', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'denouement', 'Kinsey', 'ill', 'overall', 'story', 'passion', 'initiates', 'debate', 'Just', 'exactly', 'Kinsey', 'would', 'have', 'wanted.The', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'superb', 'unexpected', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'fierce', 'fearless', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'biologist', 'who', ""n't"", 'bat', 'eyelash', 'when', 'methodology', 'used', 'studying', 'gall', 'wasps', 'forbidding', 'survey', 'human', 'sexuality', 'Neeson', 'characterization', 'eccentric', 'megalomaniac', 'doctor', 'maddening', 'genius', 'pour', 'caution', 'plainspoken', 'wife', 'Clara', 'McMillen', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'solidify', 'reputation', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'passive', 'role', 'searching', 'intelligence', 'willingly', 'brilliant', 'husband', 'not', 'injecting', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'marriage', 'Neeson', 'manage', 'terrific', 'rapport', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'intellectual', 'fascination', 'play', 'out', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'honesty', 'conviction', 'truthfully', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'credible', 'college', 'students', 'early', 'story', 'Critics', 'darling', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'be', 'continuing', 'upward', 'career', 'trajectory', 'subtle', 'often', 'incisive', 'portrayal', 'Clyde', 'Martin', 'bisexual', 'researcher', 'who', 'successfully', 'Kinsey', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'falters', 'when', 'wife', 'cheating', 'him.Familiar', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'not', 'always', 'better', 'Clyde', 'fellow', 'research', 'colleagues', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'swaggering', 'Wardell', 'Pomeroy', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'slick', 'mustachioed', 'Paul', 'Gebhard', 'much', 'impression', 'characters', 'are', 'designed', 'male', 'rather', 'full-blooded', 'characters', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'usually', 'facile', 'comic', 'self', 'Kinsey', 'one', 'consistent', 'supporter', 'Indiana', 'University', 'president', 'Herman', 'Wells', 'especially', 'when', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'became', 'too', 'notorious', 'public', 'figures', 'become', 'sponsors', 'even', 'associate', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'be', 'making', 'fun', 'own', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'playing', 'uptight', 'professor', 'jealous', 'Kinsey', 'success', 'think', 'weakest', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'predictably', 'drawn', 'flashbacks', 'Kinsey', 'childhood', 'when', 'experienced', 'unfulfilled', 'crush', 'Eagle', 'Scout', 'masturbated', 'shame', 'eventually', 'left', 'home', 'rebellion', 'brutally', 'puritanical', 'father', 'father', 'played', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'fury', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'be', 'channeling', 'same', 'role', 'played', 'Footloose', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'scene', 'where', 'own', 'sexual', 'secrets', 'years', 'later', 'son', 'particularly', 'contrived', 'little', 'more', 'cameo', 'roles', 'turn', 'memorable', 'turns', 'film', 'William', 'Sadler', 'sexual', 'satyr', 'John', 'McMartin', 'philanthropist', 'Huntington', 'Hartford', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'lesbian', 'thankful', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'flaws', 'anyone', 'interested', 'how', 'so-called', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'started']",N/A

886029,AS62A5MC52IEH,B0007PALGG,Floyd the Barber,"[22, 57]","Like the ""Human Stain,"" this movie is all about people you don't like doing things that are immoral and unscrupulous in the name of some higher pursuit only the authors, screenwriters and producers who had anything to do with this ""cinematic stain"" know of.  Alfred Kinsey comes from a straightlaced Protestant background, loving and hating his father and (inevitably for Hollywood) becoming bisexual.  (Apparently bisexuals are the new heroes of Hollywood.)  Kinsey's psychology is so screwed up he cannot relate to people unless sexually.  Thus he arrives at the greatest scam - er, scholarly project of his time:  a ""scientific study"" of human sexuality.  Since there is no data, he and his posse must generate it, sleeping with whomever and whatever in the name of science.  In fact, this simply allowed the Kinseyites to do what repressed midwesterners of the late 1940-1950s apparently always wanted to do:  have sex with abandon and talk about it.  (Hey, Kinsey was a zoologist not a behavioral psychologist.)The problem with the story, the actual characters, and the movie is that it, like ""Human Stain,"" simply shows what is ugly in people without any story to accompany it or explanation why we should be at all interested.  Oh at the end, we have a lesbian lady thanking the ""great man"" for allowing her to be lesbian, but really?  Kinsey?  Come on.  Kinsey is revered now by only a few.  The real sexual revolution came not because of his work, but afterword in the 1960s, from which time (*Playboy's* deification of Kinsey aside), and not really before, Kinsey was deemed a pioneer.  What the movie depicts - whether or not it's altogether true:  see the response of the Kinsey Institute to the film - is depressing and lurid.  Much more celluloid is given the sexual encounters and popular reaction to the Kinsey Report than to what it actually meant.  At the end, we want Kinsey to die from his bad ticker.Liam Neeson struggles with the part and I suspect embarrassment.  Laura Linney, always good, does yeoman work in the part of Kinsey's wife (way smarter than he, if the film is proximate to the truth:  certainly Linney seems as if she could run rings around Neeson.).

886031,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0007PALGG,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 8]","The name of Alfred Kinsey conjures up many different kinds of images and preconceived notions, many of which don't fit the reality of his research and situation.  The Kinsey Institute, located on the campus of my undergraduate university in Indiana, is known the world over as a research centre devoted to looking at sex in humans.  This can still be a controversial topic, but certainly for middle America during the middle of the twentieth century - this was the protestant 'Bible Belt', and sex was not a topic of proper conversation among educated people.Written and directed by Bill Condon, this film recounts the tale of Kinsey's professional career, from his early days as a Harvard researcher looking at gall wasps through his career at Indiana University, first as a biologist, and then as director of the research project and institute that today bears his name.Kinsey is a complex character - perhaps the only way he could get away with his study in the environment of mid-century America was that he was the quintessential academic, in dress, demeanor, and attitude.  His process of research, be it on gall wasps or on human subjects, was exactingly clinical.  The essence of this devotion and adherence to objective procedure is captured in the film (both in terms of wasps and in terms of people).One exchange between Kinsey and his fellow researcher Clyde Martin illustrates the point:Alfred Kinsey: 'The doctors say my heart sounds like a cement mixer.'Clyde Martin: 'At least they found one.'Kinsey was aided by his wife, the free-thinking graduate student Clara McMillan.  While a biology professor, Kinsey's openness made him a magnet for students to seek him out; sometimes their questions were regarding personal problems.  When Kinsey sought out guidance in clinical research, he was frustrated to find there was none, even in medical literature, to help guide him in his counseling for the students.  This inspired Kinsey to research, and even to offer classes dealing with the subject (these human sexuality classes are still offered at Indiana University, as well as other universities across the country).Kinsey's work derived from interviews with literally thousands of subjects, data from whom was collected and compiled, and finally distilled into a major report, 'Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male', published in 1948.  While Kinsey had assured the university and those funding his research that his report would be objective and descriptive rather than prescriptive, it was perhaps inevitable that Kinsey would climb down from this pedestal and make the statement that, based on the observable evidence, there is a much wider range to what constitutes 'being normal' than was previously held (particularly in polite, post-Victorian-morality society).  This set off a firestorm of controversy the engulfed his research at the same time as the 'red scare' was becoming a prominent issue in the United States.Kinsey's follow-up volume on human sexuality in females was seen as an attack on family values and 'the American way', and Kinsey's faith in his own processes and work was tested as his health began to falter at the same time.  However, the groundwork had been laid, and the field continued to grow and flourish through the rest of the century, both through Kinsey's own institute as well as others founded later.Condon's direction and writing is very clever, edging between documentary form at times and dramatic play at others.  It includes a bit of irony in one exchange:Reporter: 'Any plans on a Hollywood picture based on the book?'Alfred Kinsey: 'I can't think of anything more pointless.'Condon interviewed many of Kinsey's colleagues prior to writing, in essence using Kinsey's own technique.  Liam Neeson plays the title role well, with clinical detachment and academic concern held in balance with his obvious passion for his subject.  Laura Linney turns in a great performance as Clara; the three other roles of note include Tim Curry as the jealous faculty colleague, Peter Sarsgaard as close research colleague Clyde Martin (who lets his own personal involvement with both Kinsey and his wife create a bit of trouble for the group), and Oliver Platt, who plays the late, great Herman Wells, the visionary leader of Indiana University who hid his own sexual secrets fairly well through his career (for a gay man to be successful in Indiana during that time was a remarkable feat; that one should embrace controversies such as Kinsey, which was courting disaster, was astonishing).The style of the film is very true to the mid-century; sets, costumes, vehicles, manners - all of these things combine to give a very good depiction of the time and place.  This in many ways blunts the subject, but in other ways reinforces it - sexuality is not the domain just of the young, or just of the modern, or just of anything, but can be found in every time and place, including the more antiseptic and conservative of locations.  Perhaps this is also part of Condon's point with the film, being produced at a time of resurgent conservatism in North America.-------------------------------------DVD Extras-------------------------------------There is a single-disc and double disc version available.

Even while I was a teenager, Kinsey's ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" was on my bookshelf, and had pride of place.Over the years, details about the man himself have become more public, and it becomes clear that Kinsey was (surprise!) not actually a perfect human being.  Well, my own search for one of those still continues.  :-)It should not be surprising to learn that Kinsey was a driven man (""relentless"").  He was a workaholic.  Before even beginning his research into sex, he collected a MILLION specimens of the gall-wasp, and made his reputation as a biologist.  Something else the film pays little attention to: he wrote one of the standard college textbooks on biology, which sold very well for decades and made him a much more independent man.I'm not sure that the film deals completely with Kinsey's apparent awakening to his own homosexuality.  But it certainly does not skate over this interesting fact.Kinsey's sexual orientation was not his fatal flaw, in my opinion.  That flaw may be summed up in one simple sentence: ""I can live without sex, but I can't live without love.""  Kinsey was a man of his times, and so he was a behaviorist.  He refused to deal with love, because he couldn't measure it.  (And there's a nice question: how indeed can you measure the infinite?)  So Kinsey collected samples, and counted.  His entire research on one human being was reduced to one Hollerith card (AKA ""IBM punch card,"" something which I believe no longer exists).But still --- the man was not a devil; he was basically a worker-bee.  Who else could have produced his two monumental works on ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" and ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female?""  Mistitled works, though: they should have been called ""Sexual Behavior in the White American Male"" and ""Sexual Behavior in the White American Female.""All of this complexity is on view in this film, which really surprised me.  The film avoids painting Kinsey as a Great Liberator, and it also avoids painting him as a Great Satan.  What he was is quite obvious: a man who did objective research into things which had previously been unmentionable in Puritan America.An excellent movie!",5,Much better than I expected,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,2361,"['Just', 'truth', 'reviewing', 'have', 'state', 'Kinsey', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'heroes', 'just', 'was', 'hero', 'final', 'interviewee', 'film', 'who', 'blessed', 'saving', 'life', 'Even', 'was', 'teenager', 'Kinsey', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'was', 'bookshelf', 'had', 'pride', 'years', 'details', 'man', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'public', 'clear', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'surprise', 'not', 'actually', 'perfect', 'human', 'being', 'Well', 'own', 'search', 'one', 'still', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'learn', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'driven', 'man', 'relentless', 'was', 'workaholic', 'even', 'beginning', 'research', 'sex', 'collected', 'MILLION', 'specimens', 'gall-wasp', 'made', 'reputation', 'biologist', 'Something', 'else', 'film', 'little', 'attention', 'wrote', 'one', 'standard', 'college', 'textbooks', 'biology', 'sold', 'very', 'well', 'decades', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'independent', 'man.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'deals', 'completely', 'Kinsey', 'apparent', 'awakening', 'own', 'homosexuality', 'certainly', 'not', 'skate', 'interesting', 'fact.Kinsey', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'was', 'not', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'opinion', 'flaw', 'may', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'simple', 'sentence', 'can', 'live', 'sex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'love', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'man', 'times', 'so', 'was', 'behaviorist', 'refused', 'deal', 'love', 'could', ""n't"", 'measure', 'nice', 'question', 'how', 'indeed', 'can', 'measure', 'infinite', 'So', 'Kinsey', 'collected', 'samples', 'counted', 'entire', 'research', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'reduced', 'one', 'Hollerith', 'card', 'AKA', 'IBM', 'punch', 'card', 'something', 'believe', 'no', 'longer', '.But', 'still', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'devil', 'was', 'basically', 'worker-bee', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'produced', 'two', 'monumental', 'works', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Female', 'Mistitled', 'works', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'White', 'American', 'Male', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'White', 'American', 'Female', 'complexity', 'view', 'film', 'really', 'surprised', 'film', 'avoids', 'painting', 'Kinsey', 'Great', 'Liberator', 'also', 'painting', 'Great', 'Satan', 'What', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'objective', 'research', 'things', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'unmentionable', 'Puritan', 'America.An', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A
886033,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007PALGG,Grady Harp,"[4, 7]","KINSEY is a triumph, not only for writer and director Bill Condon, but also for a first class portrayal of one of the more significant minds of the 20th Century - Alfred Kinsey, brought vigorously to life by Liam Neeson in one of the finest performances of the year.  It is difficult to believe that Kinsey's opening of the Pandora's Box of human sexuality occurred only fifty years ago.  And while Kinsey's name is one known to everyone, Kinsey's struggles as a person have not been explored until recently:  credit TC Boyle's fine novel THE INNER CIRCLE for some of the attendant interest in this film.The fact that the techniques of data gathering were quintessentially important to Kinsey's scientific investigation is acknowledged from the start of his film:  Kinsey is being interviewed about his sex life by one of his well trained associates.  Kinsey's early formative years are shown to be those of a child fascinated by observing nature while struggling with a controlling father (John Lithgow).  A man of vision from the beginning, Kinsey follows his desire to be a biologist and joins the faculty of Indiana University where he concentrates on the behavior and classification of Gall Wasps.  One of his students Clyde (Peter Sargaard) becomes his private pupil, Kinsey meets and marries Mac (Laura Linney), and partially because of his failure at consummating his marriage while being consumed at the scientific variations in his Gall Wasps he begins to explore the variations in human sexuality, opening the door to his monumental studies.Once conquering his sexual problem with Mac, he proceeds to sire four children, take on a staff (Sarsgaard, Chris O'Donnell, and  Timothy Hutton), spreading his sexual interviews from the campus student body to various cities throughout the USA.  Along the way he explores the homosexual aspect of his own sexuality, encourages his sexual consort Clyde to expand his horizons by having sex with Mac, and in general creates a loose atmosphere that begins to concern his College administrators (Oliver Platt, Dylan Baker, Tim Curry).Eventually finding funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Kinsey Report is completed and published to overwhelming success.  It is the second volume exploring FEMALE sexuality that is difficult for the college and the public alike to tolerate and Kinsey slowly falls out of favor, but not without continuing some of his finest most controversial work.Each of the cast members is superb with special kudos being given to Liam Neesom and Laura Linney, but also with very special mention to the relatively small roles by John Lithgow and a cameo by Lynn Redgrave that is one of the most sensitive few minutes on film.  See the film for discovering the extensive implications of Kinsey's work, for the fineness of the script and the actual movie, and for an appreciation of how far we have come in the past fifty years!

886034,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B0007PALGG,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[9, 26]","Janice Shaw is typical of those who have problems with Kinsey. She writes, ""The most-egregious aspect of Kinsey's methodology was his use of children as subjects. He used over 300 children, including babies, in his studies of female orgasm. Some critics legitimately accuse Kinsey of child molestation. The American Board of Pediatrics argues that his data are not the norm; that he used unnatural stimulation and, even then, did not prove his point. Using pedophiles, he charted the length and frequency of infants' and children's supposed ""orgasms."" When questioned about how he knew whether a baby had an orgasm, he said he measured by their crying. Five of these infants and children were subjects for months or years, and it is reported that much of the ""testing"" occurred when they were either strapped or held down. There is no evidence that the institute followed up to see whether they were adversely affected as a result of this sexual abuse/experimentation. We do know that today many of the adult ""subjects"" refuse to discuss Kinsey's research; some 50 years later, they don't even want to talk about the horrific experience.""But this film shows us that he can be still worshipped as another liberal hero! I mean, who cares about all that child abuse stuff? Most viewers will not even hear about it in the film, and rightly so. Why sully his name? The important thing is, like Hitler's scientists who performed those gruesome human experiments, Kinsey DARED to follow his militant atheism and its implications for life. After all, who cares about someone else's babies being abused? They're not his own genes, not his legacy. And what is the purpose of life? To help your fellow man? Pshaw! Kinsey saw through all that.

886035,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B0007PALGG,Guy De Federicis,"[4, 8]","Three lesbians walk into a bar ... no, seriously. Like adolescents first discussing sexuality, ""Kinsey"" is funny. It's dramatic as well, sometimes boldly so, especially a scene where sex researcher Alfred Kinsey's father, (John Lithgow) reveals to his son, (Liam Neeson) the punishment endured as a child for exploring his own sexuality. But mostly ""Kinsey"", while very serious minded, contains a constant giddiness, like those adolescents determining the rules of pregnancy, and very much in tune to the social taboo of discussing sex openly, especially the generation first exposed to Kinsey's research. It seems everyone in the movie has their moment of 'schtick', as the serious study of the human body's sexual nature begs for a tension relieving laugh. It starts when the newlywed Kinseys turn to a conventional doctor to discuss their physical incompatiblity, and the doctor says to the bride, upon hearing the size of Mr. Kinsey's sexual organ, as if shattering a Norman Rockwell image, ""I'm surprised you didn't pass out."" It continues in Kinsey's first day teaching his infamous college class on human sexuality, when he begins the lecture by asking the class, what body organ can enlarge itself 100 times it's size?, to which the class uncomfortably squirms in their seats, until he replies, ""the pupil"". And when conducting sex interviews to make a census of American sexual behavior, an immigrant in broken english reveals he had, ""sex with horse"", to which the interviewer tries to retain composure and interrogate him further, and the immigrant replies, ""No, I had sex with Horace. Horace!"" These laughs keep coming as if relieving us of nervous energy before the serious nature of human sexuality is explored. This is still a complicated subject, prone to conservative vs. liberal values, made all too clear when the sex researchers reach a zenith of human data, and are stopped in their tracks by one subject's admission to having sex with hundreds of pre-adolescent boys and girls. Suddenly odd behavior becomes criminal behavior.Kinsey's report on human sexuality was the first American study to confront the subject in a purely scientific level, as opposed to a moral one.

886036,A2BWQ2C3QW32YP,B0007PALGG,"GZA ""gza""","[1, 3]","Kinsey bears a striking resemblance to Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind: both are biopic's of controversial historical figures whose single minded pursuit of the ""truth"" in their chosen fields went against the grain of social convention; both are simplistic, overly sentimental accounts designed as much to tug at the audience's heart strings as to paint a balanced portrait of a complex figure.Liam Neeson is solid in the lead role as Alfred Kinsey, the man who revolutionised what we know of, and how we view, sex in the western world, while Laura Linney is excellent as his loving, long-suffering wife.The film shows us Kinsey's formative years being brought up by an overbearing and puritanical father, which lead to a certain lack of social grace and empathy for others in later life, when he becomes an expert etomologist. Kinsey's lack of sexual experience leads to a disastrous wedding night, and he realises that there is almost no scientific material on human sexual practice. This, coupled to a realisation that being an expert on wasps isn't likely to lead to widespread scientific acclaim, is the lightbulb moment when he decides his life's work should be to collect data on human sexuality - starting with students of his sex education college class.I found the almost universal willingness of Kinsey's subjects to reveal all about their sex lives without so much as blushing, difficult to believe. Bearing in mind this was the conservative 1940s and no such exercise had ever been undertaken, many people would undoubtedly find such personal questions highly embarassing and even immoral. I also found the ease with which Kinsey persuades both his College and the Rockefeller Foundation to support and fund his studies just a little too convenient. As the film goes on to show, Kinsey's work led to a good deal of controversy which I can't believe wasn't there at the outset.Bill Condon's direction is somewhat simplistic (for instance the montage scenes of talking heads juxtaposed onto a map of the USA) and his characterisation a little shallow, while the script is no more than adequate - some of the dialogue jars, especially the scene of Kinsey's family openly discussing sex at the dinner table, to the disgust of his son.Neeson is a fine actor, but ultimately Kinsey doesn't give him the opportunity to show much subtlety and nuance in a fairly one-dimensional portait of an important 20th century figure.",3,Lacking in subtlety,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,2425,"['Kinsey', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'are', 'biopic', 'controversial', 'historical', 'figures', 'single', 'minded', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'chosen', 'fields', 'went', 'grain', 'social', 'convention', 'are', 'simplistic', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'accounts', 'designed', 'as', 'much', 'tug', 'audience', 'heart', 'paint', 'balanced', 'portrait', 'complex', 'figure.Liam', 'Neeson', 'solid', 'lead', 'role', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'man', 'who', 'revolutionised', 'what', 'know', 'how', 'view', 'sex', 'western', 'world', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'excellent', 'loving', 'long-suffering', 'wife.The', 'film', 'Kinsey', 'formative', 'years', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'overbearing', 'puritanical', 'father', 'lead', 'certain', 'lack', 'social', 'grace', 'empathy', 'others', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'expert', 'etomologist', 'Kinsey', 'lack', 'sexual', 'experience', 'disastrous', 'wedding', 'night', 'almost', 'scientific', 'material', 'human', 'sexual', 'practice', 'coupled', 'realisation', 'being', 'expert', 'wasps', ""n't"", 'likely', 'lead', 'widespread', 'scientific', 'acclaim', 'lightbulb', 'moment', 'when', 'life', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'collect', 'data', 'human', 'sexuality', 'starting', 'students', 'sex', 'education', 'college', 'class.I', 'found', 'almost', 'universal', 'willingness', 'Kinsey', 'subjects', 'reveal', 'sex', 'so', 'much', 'blushing', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Bearing', 'mind', 'was', 'conservative', '1940s', 'such', 'exercise', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'undertaken', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'find', 'such', 'personal', 'questions', 'highly', 'embarassing', 'even', 'immoral', 'also', 'found', 'ease', 'Kinsey', 'College', 'Rockefeller', 'Foundation', 'support', 'fund', 'studies', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'film', 'show', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'led', 'good', 'deal', 'controversy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'outset.Bill', 'Condon', 'direction', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'instance', 'montage', 'scenes', 'talking', 'heads', 'juxtaposed', 'map', 'USA', 'characterisation', 'little', 'shallow', 'script', 'more', 'adequate', 'dialogue', 'jars', 'especially', 'scene', 'Kinsey', 'family', 'openly', 'discussing', 'sex', 'dinner', 'table', 'disgust', 'son.Neeson', 'fine', 'actor', 'ultimately', 'Kinsey', ""n't"", 'give', 'opportunity', 'show', 'much', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'portait', 'important', '20th', 'century', 'figure']",N/A

Lynn Redgrave, thought in a very small role, in her scene with Kinsey near the end of the movie will make your eyes burn with her poignant ""Sir, you saved my life."" My only complaint about casting is that John Lithgow as Kinsey's father is too close to Neeson's age to be believable.The score for the film by Carter Burwell is beautifully appropriate. Many of the obligatory interviews that Kinsey and his staff perfected are shot in black and white, a very nice touch.Condon manages to make Kinsey a very complex figure who is relentless, sensitive, objective, a wise mentor, a loving husband.

Heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, bestiality, pedophilia and other forms of sexual activities perfumed by the Human animal and the scientist (Dr. Kinsey) that studied them and his life are at the core of this film. The film also tries to answer the question of love and its relationship to sex and the consequences of sex. Yup, it's all about sex, folks!At a time when ""morality"" and ""sex"" are pretty high in the collective American psyche, this film can be safely deemed the timeliest film of the year.

It's an intimate, very personal issue that most people are reluctant to tackle openly. Dr. Kinsey's argument, thus the movie's, is that it's very natural for a single human being to experience different sexual desires. Whether or not it is ""legal"" to act on those desires is another issue.The film is very bold and honest in its portrayal of Dr. Kinsey's life and research.

886041,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007PALGG,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[10, 15]","Liam Neeson delivers an extraordinary performance as Dr. Alfred Kinsey, the man generally regarded as the father of sexology, which is the systematic, scientific study of human sexuality. The biologist/entomologist/zoologist's groundbreaking 1948 publication, ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,"" and his 1953 study ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,"" generated tremendous controversy throughout post-World War II America. His research on human sexuality profoundly influenced social and cultural values in the United States especially in the late 1960's, and was an important influence on the sexual revolution. Laura Linney, as Kinsey's wife Clara, is equally superb, as are writer-director Bill Condon's, (""Gods and Monsters""), creative efforts. Condon effectively captures the complex person who was Alfred Kinsey, with all his inconsistencies, as a man and as a scientist.Kinsey conducted his studies, which had never been performed before, because he felt so strongly that some kind of ""hard evidence"" was needed to inform the pubic about sexuality and ""normalcy,"" especially given the untruths and rumors about this topic which so effects all of our lives. Before Kinsey's studies, most information that was circulated about sex was born of ignorance, prudishness and religious zealotry. People do not realize today how naive, confused, and forgive me, but absolutely ignorant, many were in the 1930's, 40's, and 50's about sex. Misconceptions far outnumbered accurate information. These untruths had negative, sometimes disastrous repercussions on many marriages. The sociological aspects of the film are as interesting as the biographical.Kinsey's early years are portrayed with accuracy and sensitivity. The son of a rigid, authoritarian engineering professor and Sunday preacher, (a downright nasty person, actually), Kinsey eventually rebelled and left engineering school and home, against his father's wishes, to become a Harvard-educated zoologist obsessed with the gall wasp. Kinsey's obsessive behavior is one of his major characteristics, which director Condon occasionally gives a humorous slant to. Also brought out in the film is Kinsey's sickly and lonely boyhood, and his love of the natural world, where he found emotional as well as physical release through hiking, climbing, swimming and observing creatures in the wild. He is given the nickname Prok, (PROfessor K), while teaching at the University of Indiana, where he meets his Clara (McMillan), a warm, witty wonderful woman who loves him enough to be patient and understanding with his genius.Both are virgins on their wedding night, and uninformed about sex except for the basics. Their difficulties and the manner in which they resolve them, turn Kinsey's focus from the wasp to human sexuality. He recruits a team of researchers, among whom are Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard), Wardell Pomeroy (Chris O'Donnell), and Paul Gebhard (Timothy Hutton), who all excel in their roles.Although much of the bio-pic deals with the research, this is anything but boring cinema! The sheer chemistry between Linney and Neeson, who have worked together before, is palpable. Together they make it obvious that while love cannot be measured scientifically, deep abiding love, which endures, is what counts ...and lasts!There is a cameo appearance by Lynn Redgrave in ""Kinsey"" which is as moving as it is meaningful. It earned her an Academy Award nomination. On a personal note, I was a kid in the 1950's and early 60s, and remember clearly my early, basic sexual education (outside the home - not from my relatively open  parents), and society's prudishness, (from my small window), about all things sexual. Even though I grew up in a home with ""liberal views"" about providing accurate sexual information, one picks up a lot from one's peers. Many of the young men I dated, although they definitely pushed for premarital sex, only wanted to marry virgins. And both male and female friends thought a variety of sexual practices, which we now consider quite ""normal,"" were bizarre. Kinsey's studies, and the changes in sexual attitudes and mores in the late 1960's and 1970's, were and are so beneficial to our society.

886042,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0007PALGG,Jean E. Pouliot,"[4, 9]","""Kinsey"" celebrates the life and work of Alfred Kinsey -- and obscure gall wasp researcher turned sex scientist. Kinsey, son of a puritanical and emotionally abusive minister, is shown struggling with the inaccuracy of information about sex in the first half of the 20th century. In his day, sexual expression outside of marriage, as well as non-procreative sex within marriage, were considered immoral, even though widely practiced. Illicit sex was burdened by guilt, and discouraged by lurid (mostly false) tales of the horrible consequences of engaging in it: blindness, infertility, madness and disease. The film shows Dr. Kinsey attempting to learn the truth about sex and communicate it first to his students, and finally to the entire world via his landmark studies on male and female sexuality.The film is very frank about its subjects and very graphic visually. Kinsey (portrayed marvelously by Liam Neeson) is a scientific hero, battling forces of ignorance and mediocrity. He is also rather naive emotionally, unable to perceive the emotional, moral and spiritual facets of sexuality. His wife Clara (Laura Linney -- great job!) is his able and open partner, encouraging his research and suffering the toll of Kinsey's sexual experimentation using himself as a subject. Kinsey's research staff, the first subjects of his ""sex histories,"" lack Kinsey's self-restraint about sex, and confuse crudely sexual speech with frankness about the subject.""Kinsey"" is a thought-provoking, even a disturbing film. It shows that science is not simply a broom that sweeps clean, but leaves a long-lasting choking cloud of dust, even as it clears old and grime-encrusted rooms. ""Kinsey"" rightly exalts the scientific method, but I am pleased that it also shows its limits. Science can count things very well -- the number of homosexuals in a community; the prevalence of various sexual behaviors -- but it can't tell us which are morally correct, and in which contexts. ""Kinsey"" is a bold, honest movie about a subject that continues to perplex us.",5,Honestly exploring the limits of science and morality,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,2044,"['Kinsey', 'life', 'work', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'obscure', 'gall', 'wasp', 'researcher', 'turned', 'sex', 'scientist', 'Kinsey', 'son', 'puritanical', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'minister', 'shown', 'struggling', 'inaccuracy', 'information', 'sex', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'day', 'sexual', 'expression', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'non-procreative', 'sex', 'marriage', 'were', 'considered', 'immoral', 'even', 'widely', 'practiced', 'Illicit', 'sex', 'was', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'discouraged', 'lurid', 'mostly', 'false', 'tales', 'horrible', 'consequences', 'engaging', 'blindness', 'infertility', 'madness', 'disease', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'attempting', 'learn', 'truth', 'sex', 'communicate', 'first', 'students', 'finally', 'entire', 'world', 'landmark', 'studies', 'male', 'female', 'sexuality.The', 'film', 'very', 'frank', 'subjects', 'very', 'graphic', 'visually', 'Kinsey', 'portrayed', 'marvelously', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'scientific', 'hero', 'battling', 'forces', 'ignorance', 'mediocrity', 'also', 'rather', 'naive', 'emotionally', 'unable', 'perceive', 'emotional', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'facets', 'sexuality', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'great', 'job', 'able', 'open', 'partner', 'encouraging', 'research', 'suffering', 'toll', 'Kinsey', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'using', 'subject', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'staff', 'first', 'subjects', 'sex', 'histories', 'lack', 'Kinsey', 'self-restraint', 'sex', 'confuse', 'crudely', 'sexual', 'speech', 'frankness', 'subject', 'Kinsey', 'thought-provoking', 'even', 'disturbing', 'film', 'science', 'not', 'simply', 'broom', 'clean', 'long-lasting', 'choking', 'cloud', 'dust', 'even', 'old', 'grime-encrusted', 'rooms', 'Kinsey', 'rightly', 'scientific', 'method', 'am', 'pleased', 'also', 'limits', 'Science', 'can', 'count', 'things', 'very', 'well', 'number', 'homosexuals', 'community', 'prevalence', 'various', 'sexual', 'behaviors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'are', 'morally', 'correct', 'contexts', 'Kinsey', 'bold', 'honest', 'movie', 'subject', 'perplex']",N/A
886043,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0007PALGG,Jeffery Mingo,"[18, 25]","I liked this movie, but I have to mention the big flaw first.  In human sexuality courses that I took, I was always told that Kinsey excluded black people from his research.  Some say he did it innocently because he felt that he didn't have a large enough sample.  Please see Brett Beemyn's book ""Queer Subjects"" for more info on this.  So it's odd that this film shows a black man and a black woman telling of their sexual experience.  This is diversity we love and expect now, but it probably wasn't the case during the pre-Civil Rights and post-Reconstruction era.  If people can fault ""A Beautiful Mind"" for its erasure of bisexuality, then they must note the inaccuracy taking place in this film.People will be thrilled by this film. When I saw it, the audience cracked up at the humor and clapped heartily at the end.  Visually, this film looks just like Norman Rockwell's paintings.  Literally, it's fascinating hearing conservative, prudish people talking about explicit subjects.  This film is both innocent and risque, just like ""Grease.""  This is a fascinationg study of Michel Foucault's repressive hypothesis.It's about time that someone made this film.  The world must thank Kinsey for showing that sexuality can be studied scientifically.  So much of marital counseling, pro-choice options, and gay rights would not have happened without him.  He is a godfather for both sex education classes and gay studies.  I would add feminism too.  This movie shows how studying men sexually was somewhat acceptable, but Kinsey was punished for studying women.  This double-standard is one of the points where I was most heartbroken in the film.  Neesom effectively shows how determined Kinsey was.  This made for a dynamic look at the actions and minds of geniuses and pioneers.Believe it or not, many people will be able to put themselves in Kinsey's shoes.  This film shows how hard it is for any fundraiser (whether for non-profits or for research) to pay for their work or make their goals happen.  This also shows the difficulty in trying to not get wrapped up into that which you are studying.  It also shows how scientists do not want to have their research just sit in outer space; they want to affect policy, to have their results mean something outside of the library.  It explores the difficulty in facing the fire without getting burnt.In this film, we see how Kinsey did so much that would help gay men and lesbians, but it was also just one of many subjects that he broached.  This film shows gays, bisexuals, and heterosexuals in a positive light.  No one will be offended.  Also, there is a love triangle in this film where all 3 persons (of both biological sexes, and different sexual identities) have agency and choice, are made to look good.The actors here are amazing.  Tim Curry plays a prudish professor.  It's almost the exact opposite of his Frankenfurter role from ""Rocky Horror.""  Still, he manages to be the character, again, that audiences love to hate.  Equally important, John Lithgow shows his incredible acting range.  I associate him with his friendly, wholesome telephone ads.  However, his roles in this movie, ""Garp,"" and ""RIcochet"" show that he is great at pushing the envelope and exploring many provocative roles.  Chris O'Donnell does go outside of his typical, boyish roles, but I think he could have done more.This film is sexy, but not obscene at all.  There are things that Kinsey and his research assistants do that would now be considered unethical.  Still, Neeson's emaciated, oily body could not ever be deemed erotic.  For some reason, he and his wife age little in this film though they have children one scene and the children are adults two minutes later.  Neesom looks so much like Ralph Fiennes (""Maid in Manhattan,"" ""Red Dragon"") that I would not know it was Neesom if he weren't at the Chicago premiere.My biggest critique is that this film has no ending.  Unlike ""Motorcycle Diaries,"" ""Boycott,"" ""10,000 Black Men Named George,"" and many other biopics, there is no biographical information written at the end.  This begs far more questions then it answers and leaves the audience hanging.Still, every adult across the globe needs to see and think seriously about this work.",4,You must see this!,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,4235,"['liked', 'movie', 'have', 'mention', 'big', 'flaw', 'first', 'human', 'sexuality', 'took', 'was', 'always', 'told', 'Kinsey', 'excluded', 'black', 'people', 'research', 'say', 'did', 'innocently', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'enough', 'sample', 'Please', 'see', 'Brett', 'Beemyn', 'book', 'Queer', 'Subjects', 'more', 'info', 'odd', 'film', 'black', 'man', 'black', 'woman', 'telling', 'sexual', 'experience', 'diversity', 'love', 'expect', 'now', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'pre-Civil', 'Rights', 'post-Reconstruction', 'era', 'people', 'can', 'fault', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'erasure', 'bisexuality', 'then', 'must', 'note', 'inaccuracy', 'taking', 'place', 'film.People', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'film', 'When', 'saw', 'audience', 'cracked', 'up', 'humor', 'clapped', 'heartily', 'end', 'Visually', 'film', 'just', 'like', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'paintings', 'Literally', 'fascinating', 'hearing', 'conservative', 'prudish', 'people', 'talking', 'explicit', 'subjects', 'film', 'innocent', 'risque', 'just', 'Grease', 'fascinationg', 'study', 'Michel', 'Foucault', 'repressive', 'hypothesis.It', 'time', 'someone', 'made', 'film', 'world', 'must', 'thank', 'Kinsey', 'showing', 'sexuality', 'can', 'be', 'studied', 'scientifically', 'So', 'much', 'marital', 'counseling', 'pro-choice', 'options', 'gay', 'rights', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'godfather', 'sex', 'education', 'classes', 'gay', 'studies', 'would', 'add', 'feminism', 'too', 'movie', 'how', 'studying', 'men', 'sexually', 'was', 'somewhat', 'acceptable', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'punished', 'studying', 'women', 'double-standard', 'one', 'points', 'where', 'was', 'most', 'heartbroken', 'film', 'Neesom', 'effectively', 'how', 'determined', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'made', 'dynamic', 'look', 'actions', 'minds', 'geniuses', 'pioneers.Believe', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'Kinsey', 'shoes', 'film', 'how', 'hard', 'fundraiser', 'non-profits', 'research', 'pay', 'work', 'make', 'goals', 'happen', 'also', 'difficulty', 'trying', 'not', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'are', 'studying', 'also', 'how', 'scientists', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'research', 'just', 'sit', 'outer', 'space', 'want', 'affect', 'policy', 'have', 'results', 'mean', 'something', 'library', 'difficulty', 'facing', 'fire', 'getting', 'burnt.In', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'help', 'gay', 'men', 'lesbians', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'subjects', 'broached', 'film', 'gays', 'bisexuals', 'heterosexuals', 'positive', 'light', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'Also', 'love', 'triangle', 'film', 'where', '3', 'persons', 'biological', 'sexes', 'different', 'sexual', 'identities', 'have', 'agency', 'choice', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'good.The', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'amazing', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'prudish', 'professor', 'almost', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Frankenfurter', 'role', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Still', 'be', 'character', 'again', 'audiences', 'love', 'hate', 'Equally', 'important', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'incredible', 'acting', 'range', 'associate', 'friendly', 'wholesome', 'telephone', 'ads', 'However', 'roles', 'movie', 'Garp', 'RIcochet', 'show', 'great', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'exploring', 'many', 'provocative', 'roles', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'go', 'typical', 'boyish', 'roles', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more.This', 'film', 'sexy', 'not', 'obscene', 'are', 'things', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'assistants', 'do', 'would', 'now', 'be', 'considered', 'unethical', 'Still', 'Neeson', 'emaciated', 'oily', 'body', 'could', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'deemed', 'erotic', 'reason', 'wife', 'age', 'little', 'film', 'have', 'children', 'one', 'scene', 'children', 'are', 'adults', 'two', 'minutes', 'later', 'Neesom', 'so', 'much', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'Neesom', 'were', ""n't"", 'Chicago', 'premiere.My', 'biggest', 'critique', 'film', 'ending', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'Boycott', '10,000', 'Black', 'Men', 'Named', 'George', 'many', 'other', 'biopics', 'biographical', 'information', 'written', 'end', 'begs', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'then', 'audience', 'hanging.Still', 'adult', 'globe', 'see', 'think', 'seriously', 'work']",N/A

And listen to them chat about it in endless, clinical fashion when they're not engaging in it? Well friends, do I have a drawn-out, fake-bio for you! Like many Hollywood movies today, it strives to make a hero out of a guy who really wasn't. Liam Neeson portrays Alfred Kinsey, the researcher who wrote the famous human sexuality books in the 40s. The writers of the film would have you believe people were not enjoying or speaking about sex until Kinsey was brave enough to write about. That seems a bit specious, especially since my great-grandparents owned a thriving sex shop on Nantucket in the 30s... I think... maybe it was a cheese shop. Anyway, Kinsey was just a nerdy, pervy guy who enjoyed interviewing people about their sexual positions and proclivities and writing boring tomes about his findings - a good job if you can get a major university to fund it. The film tried unsuccessfully to be both cute and serious, but did succeed in being long, predictable and unsightly. Now I could be wrong, but I'm pretty certain not everyone was startlingly homely in the olden day, but geez Louise, the casting agent for this over-hyped dud made sure to fill the film with a bunch of serious ugs (check out all his assistant's wives... yikes!).

Wrenn,"[7, 13]","""Kinsey"" is a fantastic, though polarizing biopic about the controversial Dr. Alfred Kinsey (played by Liam Neeson), a rather square entomologist from Indiana, who eventually discovered that the sexual habits of humans were much more complex than anyone was willing to admit.With the challenge of telling Kinsey's life story, writer/director Bill Condon covers a lot of ground, and develops Alfred from his repressed childhood and through his boring adult phase leading into the inspired controversial figure who was a hero to some and a social menace to others.  His realization that the truth about human sexual behaviour defied public opinion fueled a national research campaign that led to his bestselling publication ""The Sexual Behavior in the Human Male.""  The reserch for the book supplies some of the most hilariously frank dialouge about sex that i've ever seen, as well as some of the saddest confessionals.  Suffice to say, the book raised some issues, eyebrows, and tempers.Though the controversy is the vehicle of the film, Condon steers Kinsey through his darkly personal stages of ambition, turbluance, and deterioration.  Eventually, craving a more subjective perspective, Kinsey starts to experiment on himself, triggering a pattern of self destruction that he never fully recovers from.The film cuts through time as to spare us the potential danger of boredom that comes with every biopic.

886048,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007PALGG,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","""Kinsey"" is the story of Alfred Kinsey, the very controversial sex researcher of the 1950's. At a time when the only sex education that was being taught was abstinence and only in a general health class, Dr. Kinsey was feeling the lack of information and that amount of rubbish that was being taught as fact. People just didn't have any information about sex, who does it, who does what, what is permissible, and what is possible. His interest in the subject came because of some sexual issues early in his marriage and his need as scientist to know the solution. There is also a deep undercurrent of sexual repression from his father.Dr. Kinsey initially starts to advise some of his science students and then more and more start coming to him and Dr. Kinsey inquires about a sexual education class that could be held at his University. He also begins an exhaustive study (pun intended) into the sexual behavior of human males with a follow up study on females to come later. Any question that could be asked is asked and the findings are shocking to many, though not likely shocking to today's audience.My expectation for the movie that it would be start to finish sex and nudity. I think this is from some of the negative, one sided reviews that portrayed this movie through a certain moral lens. It isn't. The movie is filled with talk about sex, and as it should be considering the subject. There is sex and nudity, though not nearly as much as one would expect. While there is a good deal of sex as the movie progresses, it is far less revealing than it could have been.The real surprise that I had was that this was a good movie, better than I had anticipated. I was all ready to dislike the movie and I couldn't. Well made, well told, and while it does celebrate Kinsey and his work (ending with a woman telling an older Kinsey that his work saved her life and helped her to have a healthy relationship with another woman), ""Kinsey"" does not hide his faults, obsessions, and uncomfortable beliefs (such as that there is nothing wrong or immoral about pedophilia). The film shows the great strides Dr. Kinsey helped America take in sexual education even when America wasn't truly ready, but doesn't hide the negative.-Joe Sherry",4,"with a hint of prudishness, this is far better than I expected",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,2235,"['Kinsey', 'story', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'very', 'controversial', 'sex', 'researcher', '1950', 'time', 'when', 'only', 'sex', 'education', 'was', 'being', 'taught', 'was', 'abstinence', 'only', 'general', 'health', 'class', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'feeling', 'lack', 'information', 'amount', 'rubbish', 'was', 'being', 'taught', 'fact', 'People', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'information', 'sex', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'what', 'permissible', 'what', 'possible', 'interest', 'subject', 'came', 'sexual', 'issues', 'early', 'marriage', 'need', 'scientist', 'know', 'solution', 'also', 'deep', 'undercurrent', 'sexual', 'repression', 'father.Dr', 'Kinsey', 'initially', 'advise', 'science', 'students', 'then', 'more', 'more', 'start', 'coming', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'sexual', 'education', 'class', 'could', 'be', 'held', 'University', 'also', 'exhaustive', 'study', 'pun', 'intended', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'human', 'males', 'follow', 'up', 'study', 'females', 'come', 'later', 'question', 'could', 'be', 'asked', 'asked', 'findings', 'are', 'shocking', 'many', 'not', 'likely', 'shocking', 'today', 'audience.My', 'expectation', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'start', 'finish', 'sex', 'nudity', 'think', 'negative', 'one', 'sided', 'reviews', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'certain', 'moral', 'lens', ""n't"", 'movie', 'filled', 'talk', 'sex', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'subject', 'sex', 'nudity', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'good', 'deal', 'sex', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'revealing', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'real', 'surprise', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'better', 'had', 'anticipated', 'was', 'ready', 'dislike', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'Well', 'made', 'well', 'told', 'celebrate', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'ending', 'woman', 'telling', 'older', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'saved', 'life', 'helped', 'have', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Kinsey', 'not', 'hide', 'faults', 'obsessions', 'uncomfortable', 'beliefs', 'such', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'immoral', 'pedophilia', 'film', 'great', 'strides', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'helped', 'America', 'take', 'sexual', 'education', 'even', 'when', 'America', 'was', ""n't"", 'truly', 'ready', ""n't"", 'hide', 'negative.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

Like A Beautiful Mind, Ron Howard's shiny reflection of mathematician John Nash, Kinsey doesn't pretend to a definitive portrait. Instead, it opens up avenues of discussion that will continue long after the film ends.Most people of my generation know more about the outcome of Kinsey's studies than the man himself. Writer-director Bill Condon, whose examination of Frankenstein director James Whale in Gods and Monsters was both entertaining and involving, does an adequate job of humanizing a man considered by many to be immoral and opportunistic.I would love to have been a fly on the wall as the censors, excuse me, the ratings board, argued about the film's content. How do you accurately depict the work and findings of a pioneering sex researcher within the confines of an R rating? Is sex, both the act and still images, considered obscene within context? How much sex talk is acceptable? How graphic? Within what boundaries?Show too much and Kinsey becomes pornographic (not my term but one usually used by groups with the word Family in the title), show too little and Kinsey becomes titillating. Kinsey is like The Three Bears, each taking a poke at poor Goldilocks. Too much, too little, just right. Condon and his talented cast are the perfect fit. Each and every character arrives with purpose and emotional weight.Liam Neeson musters just the right amount of authority and inquisitiveness as Kinsey, whose repressed childhood (under the stern guidance of father John Lithgow, channeling himself from Footloose) leads him on a life-long journey to uncover the sexual secrets of the world. Laura Linney is exceptional as his prim but sexually enthusiastic wife Clara, whose love and understanding provides Kinsey the freedom to explore his bisexuality with research assistant Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard), who in turn finds himself attracted to Clara.With Kinsey, Condon reaffirms an ability to draw honest performances out of a cast. Even small roles, like Lynn Redgrave's heartfelt lesbian, are extremely powerful. In one microscopic moment, with minimal dialogue, Redgrave exposes every vulnerability of a woman trapped by societal fears.Detractors will argue that Condon fails to adequately address Kinsey's illegal sexual proclivities. It's not a complete whitewash (this isn't Fox News, and Kinsey isn't Bush), but it does compel the viewer to seek out of the facts.",5,SEX EDUCATION 101,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2520,"['Taken', 'face', 'value', 'Kinsey', 'funny', 'touching', 'occasionally', 'disturbing', 'look', 'man', 'name', 'became', 'synonymous', 'sex', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'shiny', 'reflection', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash', 'Kinsey', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'definitive', 'portrait', 'Instead', 'up', 'avenues', 'discussion', 'will', 'continue', 'long', 'film', 'ends.Most', 'people', 'generation', 'know', 'more', 'outcome', 'Kinsey', 'studies', 'man', 'Writer-director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'examination', 'Frankenstein', 'director', 'James', 'Whale', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'was', 'entertaining', 'involving', 'adequate', 'job', 'humanizing', 'man', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'immoral', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'fly', 'wall', 'censors', 'ratings', 'board', 'argued', 'film', 'content', 'How', 'do', 'accurately', 'depict', 'work', 'findings', 'pioneering', 'sex', 'researcher', 'confines', 'R', 'rating', 'sex', 'act', 'still', 'images', 'considered', 'obscene', 'context', 'How', 'much', 'sex', 'talk', 'acceptable', 'How', 'graphic', 'what', 'boundaries', 'Show', 'too', 'much', 'Kinsey', 'pornographic', 'not', 'term', 'one', 'usually', 'used', 'groups', 'word', 'Family', 'title', 'show', 'too', 'little', 'Kinsey', 'titillating', 'Kinsey', 'Three', 'Bears', 'taking', 'poke', 'poor', 'Goldilocks', 'Too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'just', 'right', 'Condon', 'talented', 'cast', 'are', 'perfect', 'fit', 'character', 'purpose', 'emotional', 'weight.Liam', 'Neeson', 'musters', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'authority', 'inquisitiveness', 'Kinsey', 'repressed', 'childhood', 'stern', 'guidance', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'channeling', 'Footloose', 'life-long', 'journey', 'uncover', 'sexual', 'secrets', 'world', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'exceptional', 'prim', 'sexually', 'enthusiastic', 'wife', 'Clara', 'love', 'understanding', 'Kinsey', 'freedom', 'explore', 'bisexuality', 'research', 'assistant', 'Clyde', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'turn', 'attracted', 'Clara.With', 'Kinsey', 'Condon', 'ability', 'draw', 'honest', 'performances', 'cast', 'Even', 'small', 'roles', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'heartfelt', 'lesbian', 'are', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'one', 'microscopic', 'moment', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'Redgrave', 'vulnerability', 'woman', 'trapped', 'societal', 'fears.Detractors', 'will', 'argue', 'Condon', 'adequately', 'address', 'Kinsey', 'illegal', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'not', 'complete', 'whitewash', ""n't"", 'Fox', 'News', 'Kinsey', ""n't"", 'Bush', 'compel', 'viewer', 'seek', 'facts']",N/A

Our society's fanatical dedication to pleasuring ourselves also resulted.  The core question:  are we happier?  The character portrayed by Lynn Redgrave would certianly say yes.  I wonder if all would agree as unreservedly.My only carp:  the movie sells Kinsey to such an extent as to exclude other very significant ""sexual taxonomists,"" such as Krafft-Ebbing and Havelock Ellis.

886051,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0007PALGG,Jonathan Appleseed,"[11, 15]","KINSEY is so well acted that it seems nearly the most perfectly scripted documentary in the history of film. The acting performances were stunning. Liam Neeson was strong, confident, and zealous, and Laura Linney was entirely believable as a spouse that married a collector of bugs and became the spouse of a man who collected `scientific data' on people's sex lives. Although that does not do Kinsey's work justice. In my opinion, his work was some of the most important scientific/sociological work performed in the 20th century.What struck me through nearly every moment of the film was how strikingly similar the climate of his day is to today's social climate. Second to that, I was amazed that society was progressive enough to allow Kinsey to conduct his work, although in the end his funding from the Rockefeller Foundation was cut - yet another ""Hey, Thanks!"" to good ol' McCarthy (the nut job).Today we're seeing heightened conservatism with regard to sexuality. Some of that has to do with disease - specifically, AIDS. Some of that is also related to recent attempts by many gay groups to make gay marriage legal. (This is something, by the way, that one day society will look back on and say, ""duh!"", just like interracial marriages, and giving African Americans and women the right to vote. How so many people don't understand that boggles the mind. [That should get me some negative votes!]) So the release of this film, at this particular time, illustrated how most events are cyclical. I drew hope from the film, because looking back on history I know that the McCarthy nonsense went away, and today is spoken of mostly in embarrassed tones. I believe that in the next decade, we will see a similar shift in ""morality"".I read the Kinsey Report in high school, and remember thinking - by gosh, I'm normal! I'm not going to go blind after all, or grow hair on my palms! I found out that on a ""normal"" scale, if there was such a thing, I was far closer to normal than I had ever believed. Like the last scene in the film, a touching two minute ""interview"" with a character played by Lynn Redgrave, it changed my life.This movie was full of surprises. I don't know if the depictions of Kinsey being as strict and preachy and zealous as he was in the film are correct, but if they are, then Neeson really hit the mark. He does such a good job when playing real people: Schindler's List, Michael Collins, Kinsey. He is able to immerse himself into the reality of the situation, and what we see on the screen isn't acting - we see the person he is representing. That takes talent, and he has it in spades.Like the social climate I mentioned above, the movie itself is cyclical, coming full circle. It begins by showing Kinsey's love, even as a young boy, of observing and noting nature, and ends on the same note. He is still working on his ""sex studies"", of course, but we see him appreciating the thing that interested him in science in the beginning, and we're simply reminded of it at the end.Of all the wonderful performances, there was one other standout. John Lithgow - always wonderful - played Kinsey's father: a preacher, a domineering husband and father, and an all around jerk. (There's a better word, but I doubt Amazon would publish this review if I used it.) If he doesn't get an Oscar nod, it's only because he wasn't on the screen long enough. But whenever he was, he stole every scene.But he was so basely mean that at his own wife's funeral, when offered condolences, he remarked, ""Well it won't be as if I'm alone. My overweight daughter has no marriage prospects, and my other son has moved back home because he [failed at something]. Prock [Albert Kinsey's nickname] is working on some ridiculous study..."" Basically, he humiliated his children at their mother's wake.In a typical Kinsey moment, he placed his hands on his hips and directed the full intensity of his character at his father (which is, trust, me, significant). ""Do you want to know what I'm working on? It's a sex study, and I'd like you to participate in it.""Oddly enough, the father agreed, and when the topic of manual stimulation came up the answer was one of the most shocking things that's even passed through these ears. You'll have to hear it yourself to believe it.This is one of the best movies I've seen depicting a true story that I've ever seen.",5,"Morality, McCarthy, and science - oh MY!",1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,4356,"['KINSEY', 'so', 'well', 'nearly', 'most', 'perfectly', 'scripted', 'documentary', 'history', 'film', 'acting', 'performances', 'were', 'stunning', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'was', 'strong', 'confident', 'zealous', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'was', 'entirely', 'believable', 'spouse', 'married', 'collector', 'bugs', 'became', 'spouse', 'man', 'who', 'collected', 'scientific', 'data', 'people', 'sex', 'not', 'do', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'justice', 'opinion', 'work', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'scientific/sociological', 'work', 'performed', '20th', 'century.What', 'struck', 'nearly', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'climate', 'day', 'today', 'social', 'climate', 'Second', 'was', 'amazed', 'society', 'was', 'progressive', 'enough', 'allow', 'Kinsey', 'conduct', 'work', 'end', 'funding', 'Rockefeller', 'Foundation', 'was', 'cut', 'yet', 'Hey', 'Thanks', 'good', 'ol', 'McCarthy', 'nut', 'job', '.Today', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'heightened', 'conservatism', 'regard', 'sexuality', 'do', 'disease', 'specifically', 'AIDS', 'also', 'related', 'recent', 'attempts', 'many', 'gay', 'groups', 'make', 'gay', 'marriage', 'legal', 'something', 'way', 'one', 'day', 'society', 'will', 'look', 'back', 'say', 'duh', 'just', 'interracial', 'marriages', 'giving', 'African', 'Americans', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'How', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mind', 'should', 'get', 'negative', 'votes', ']', 'release', 'film', 'particular', 'time', 'illustrated', 'how', 'most', 'events', 'are', 'cyclical', 'drew', 'hope', 'film', 'looking', 'back', 'history', 'know', 'McCarthy', 'nonsense', 'went', 'away', 'today', 'spoken', 'mostly', 'embarrassed', 'tones', 'believe', 'next', 'decade', 'will', 'see', 'similar', 'shift', 'morality', 'read', 'Kinsey', 'Report', 'high', 'school', 'remember', 'thinking', 'gosh', ""'m"", 'normal', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'blind', 'grow', 'hair', 'palms', 'found', 'out', 'normal', 'scale', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'was', 'far', 'closer', 'normal', 'had', 'ever', 'believed', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'touching', 'two', 'minute', 'interview', 'character', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'changed', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'surprises', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'depictions', 'Kinsey', 'being', 'strict', 'preachy', 'zealous', 'was', 'film', 'are', 'correct', 'are', 'then', 'Neeson', 'really', 'hit', 'mark', 'good', 'job', 'when', 'playing', 'real', 'people', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'Kinsey', 'able', 'immerse', 'reality', 'situation', 'what', 'see', 'screen', ""n't"", 'acting', 'see', 'person', 'representing', 'talent', 'spades.Like', 'social', 'climate', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'cyclical', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'showing', 'Kinsey', 'love', 'even', 'young', 'boy', 'observing', 'noting', 'nature', 'same', 'note', 'still', 'working', 'sex', 'studies', 'course', 'see', 'appreciating', 'thing', 'interested', 'science', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'simply', 'reminded', 'end.Of', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'standout', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'always', 'wonderful', 'played', 'Kinsey', 'father', 'preacher', 'domineering', 'husband', 'father', 'jerk', 'better', 'word', 'doubt', 'Amazon', 'would', 'publish', 'review', 'used', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'only', 'was', ""n't"", 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'was', 'stole', 'scene.But', 'was', 'so', 'basely', 'mean', 'own', 'wife', 'funeral', 'when', 'offered', 'condolences', 'remarked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', ""'m"", 'alone', 'overweight', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'prospects', 'other', 'son', 'moved', 'back', 'home', 'failed', 'something', ']', 'Prock', '[', 'Albert', 'Kinsey', 'nickname', ']', 'working', 'ridiculous', 'study', 'Basically', 'humiliated', 'children', 'mother', 'wake.In', 'typical', 'Kinsey', 'moment', 'placed', 'hands', 'hips', 'directed', 'full', 'intensity', 'character', 'father', 'trust', 'significant', 'Do', 'want', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'working', 'sex', 'study', ""'d"", 'like', 'participate', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'father', 'agreed', 'when', 'topic', 'manual', 'stimulation', 'came', 'up', 'answer', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'things', 'even', 'passed', 'ears', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hear', 'believe', 'it.This', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'depicting', 'true', 'story', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

886053,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0007PALGG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","""Kinsey"" is written and directed by Oscar winner Bill Condon and has an all-star (and a great) cast featuring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Peter Sarsgaard,Chris O'Donnel, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, and Oliver Platt. ""Kinsey"" scored 3 Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture and an Oscar nomination for Laura Linney. The movie is based on the life of Alfred Kinsey, a person I had no knowledge of prior to viewing this film. The movie is very entertaining, well told with some great dialouge and acting (for a bio-pic anyway). But, anyway Neeson (who should've got an Oscar nomination)plays Professor Alfred Kinsey, nicknamed Prok by his students. Prok studies and teaches about gall wasps and meets a student named Clara (Linney) who is one of the few women expressing interest in wasps herself. Clara eventually aquires the nickname Mac and the two get married. Both are virgins and after experiencing sex, Prok becomes fascinated with it and the ignorance of sex that people have. Kinsey takes it on himself to teach people about it and only becomes more and more interested as times goes on. The movie takes some weird turns, like when Prok hires his first assistant Clyde (Sarsgaard, who I usually like but for some reason acts better in independent films) and the two begin to have a homosexual relationship. At one point, Clyde even has sex with Mac. Eventually Kinsey recruits two other assistants(Hutton & O'Donnel, both great) and so on. As I said the movie is well told, entertaining throughout. Not only is the movie interesting, but the lessons Kinsey (Neeson) teaches in the movie are interesting too. A few scenes had me busting up laughing (think the mexican guy.

Condon is a natural at writing smart dialogue and gripping characters.  Also like Gods and Monsters, the subject of this film is someone whom society would view as a sexual deviant.It tells the story of Alfred Kinsey - a zoologist specializing in bugs.  In middle age, he developed an interest in human sexuality and taught a college course on the subject.  Soon, he became a pioneer is sex research.It is wonderful to see Liam Neeson in a movie that will actually let him ACT again.  He portrays Kinsey, not as a pervert, but as a scientist who is doing socially beneficial work.  In the times in which Kinsey lived, newlywed women still did not know where babies came from.  What he was most interested in was doing away with the shame that most people felt from believing that they were not ""normal"" sexually.  However, his life takes a turn for the weird when he becomes personally involved with his research.The movie presents us with a character who is a bit morally ambivalent.  Yes, he did have good motives and he did accomplish a lot of good.  On the other hand, I think most scientists nowadays would agree that the methods he used were unethical.  Furthermore, there are some aspects of conventional society that are worth preserving.

I haven't seen a good one since LADY SINGS THE BLUES and even that wasn't awfully good, though it was fascinating. So is KINSEY, I expect, though people don't seem to want to go to it. Me and my friend Wayne went last night and three women sitting behind us and to the left were laughing at themselves and their own naivete because, as it turned out, they had come to the theater thinking they were seeing ""Kinsey Millhone,"" the Sue Grafton heroine, brought to life by Laura Linney. They didn't know whether to laugh or cry when they discovered they were in for a picture showing how America gradually opened up to the idea of sex when supported by science.Another rule of thumb is, most movies starring John Lithgow and Veronica Cartwright as the parents are probably going to be pretty overplayed. This was the case here. Seeing this movie was like going into a time tunnel of the cinema--so many of the actors haven't been in an ""A"" movie in ages. Timothy Hutton, Lynn Redgrave, John Lithgow, Katherine Houghton (the young girl from GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, now looking unimaginably aged) and even Chris O'Donnell from the Batman movies. How did he get another job? He's looking good. But Peter Sarsgaard provokes most of the attention by slipping out of his clothes in a cheap hotel room and heading for the shower. Kinsey doesn't know which way to look but you can see where his eyes are straying to. Peter Sarsgaard isn't the luckiest guy in tbe size department, but he's got nothing to complain about, and once his pants come down, you can predict what's going to happen through the rest of the movie. I wonder if the real Clyde Martin is still alive? If so you'd think he'd ask for someone with a bigger endowment to play him. Oh well, he (Sarsgaard) is extremely good in the movie and many fans will beat a path to his door.Linney and Neeson are good, too, but they are often harshly lit and madeup to look awful. Laura Linney in particular has been given some nice hairdos and 30s and 40s dresses, but then they blotch her skin with a disgraceful aging makeup that makes it hard to believe she's not supposed to be playing a homeless person without access to moisturizer or even soap. As for Neeson, how old is he anyhow? Playing a young man he looks older than Walter Huston, and he doesn't get any better as he ages.All in all the movie is too ambitious and tries to cover too much territory. GODS AND MONSTERS, Bill Condon's previous biopic, took the subtler approach of limiting the story to the events of the last days of James Whale's life. This story might have worked better with a little restraint, though I can see Condon pushing for that epic feel which he just misses--what a pity.",4,Biopics are always a little disappointing . . .,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,2820,"['matter', 'how', 'well', 'scripted', ""'re"", 'hidebound', 'having', 'stick', 'outward', 'facts', 'subject', 'life', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'good', 'one', 'LADY', 'SINGS', 'THE', 'BLUES', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'awfully', 'good', 'was', 'fascinating', 'KINSEY', 'expect', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'go', 'Me', 'friend', 'Wayne', 'went', 'last', 'night', 'three', 'women', 'sitting', 'left', 'were', 'laughing', 'own', 'naivete', 'because', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'come', 'theater', 'thinking', 'were', 'seeing', 'Kinsey', 'Millhone', 'Sue', 'Grafton', 'heroine', 'brought', 'life', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'cry', 'when', 'discovered', 'were', 'picture', 'showing', 'how', 'America', 'gradually', 'opened', 'up', 'idea', 'sex', 'when', 'supported', 'science.Another', 'rule', 'thumb', 'most', 'movies', 'starring', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'parents', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'overplayed', 'was', 'case', 'here', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'tunnel', 'cinema', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'A', 'movie', 'ages', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'young', 'girl', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'COMING', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'now', 'looking', 'unimaginably', 'aged', 'even', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Batman', 'movies', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'job', 'looking', 'good', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'most', 'attention', 'slipping', 'clothes', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'room', 'heading', 'shower', 'Kinsey', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'look', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'eyes', 'are', 'straying', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', ""n't"", 'luckiest', 'guy', 'tbe', 'size', 'department', 'got', 'nothing', 'complain', 'once', 'pants', 'come', 'down', 'can', 'predict', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'rest', 'movie', 'wonder', 'real', 'Clyde', 'Martin', 'still', 'alive', 'so', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'ask', 'someone', 'bigger', 'endowment', 'play', 'Oh', 'well', 'Sarsgaard', 'extremely', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'beat', 'path', 'door.Linney', 'Neeson', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'often', 'harshly', 'lit', 'madeup', 'look', 'awful', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'particular', 'been', 'given', 'nice', 'hairdos', '30s', '40s', 'dresses', 'then', 'blotch', 'skin', 'disgraceful', 'aging', 'makeup', 'hard', 'believe', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'homeless', 'person', 'access', 'moisturizer', 'even', 'soap', 'Neeson', 'how', 'old', 'anyhow', 'Playing', 'young', 'man', 'older', 'Walter', 'Huston', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'movie', 'too', 'ambitious', 'tries', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'territory', 'GODS', 'MONSTERS', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'previous', 'biopic', 'took', 'subtler', 'approach', 'limiting', 'story', 'events', 'last', 'days', 'James', 'Whale', 'life', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'little', 'restraint', 'can', 'see', 'Condon', 'pushing', 'epic', 'feel', 'just', 'what', 'pity']",N/A
886059,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0007PALGG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","For whatever reason, American cinema is notoriously prudish about sex.  Frank, adult films with strong sexual content are few and far between--and generally quite controversial.  In an era where any amount of violence, gore and brutality is commonplace--I find it odd that religious pundits and the ratings board are primarily on the attack against sexual material.  So, with a great deal of interest, I approached ""Kinsey"" when it arrived in theaters.  I wondered how a major studio would handle a conventional biopic about a sexual pioneer.I was thrilled with the result--Bill Condon crafted a serious, challenging film.  It had been a long time since I'd seen a relevant movie that spoke openly about sex.  My recent experience re-watching ""Kinsey"" has only strengthened my resolve to proclaim it a significant and brilliant film.  It's hard to imagine the bulk of this film is set in the forties, because much of the conversation is as taboo to today's society (at least how it is represented in film) as it was then.  Kinsey, an unlikely candidate to become America's best known sex researcher, is played in a stunning warts-and-all portrayal by Liam Neeson.  Equally motivated by science, the animal kingdom, and his own sexual ineptitude--we see every step of Kinsey's own liberation.  As we learn about the habits, passions, and frustrations of others--so too do we learn more about ourselves.The screenplay, also by Condon, is extremely literate and thoughtful.  This is a grown-up movie made for intelligent adults.  Imagine!  Neeson, as I've mentioned, is perfection.  Laura Linney, as Kinsey's wife, was the film's sole Oscar nomination.  She is solid, as usual--always an interesting blend of need and strength.  Along with Neeson, Peter Sarsgaard also deserved acting recognition.  A real actor's actor, Sarsgaard is often overlooked and undervalued--but here he is a revelation as the man who beds both of the Kinsey's.  Even the smaller roles are fleshed out with intelligence including John Lithgow, Chris O'Donnell and Timothy Hutton all doing fine work.A minor hiccup doesn't change my overall passion for ""Kinsey""--but the ending was a bit conventional for such a special film.  In a different world, this movie would have been a commercial hit!  It would have garnered an Oscar nod for Best Picture.  Along with Linney, Neeson and Sarsgaard would have been acting nominees.  And Condon would have been up for Writing and Directing.  Sadly, I don't live in that world for it's a world where movies are made for grown-ups and quality triumphs!

886060,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007PALGG,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 10]","Galileo Galilei and scientists alike announced through in-depth research that the Earth was not flat and faced heavy persecution.  Their different thinking broke the standards of the 16th century pious beliefs, which had been used a long time before scientists questioned the validity and reliability in what they observed.  This offended the Catholic Church who proclaimed that they held the highest truth, a truth deeply rooted in unquestioned morality.  The questioning of the religious beliefs triggered a witch-hunt of the scientists that disagreed with the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.  However, the truth eventually emerged, as Galileo's theories are still the instruments of current astronomical research that continues to evolve the human existence beyond the earth.The Catholic Church and Lutheran Church persecuted people with different ideas of Christianity.  Those who desired to exercise their own freedom of religion sought refuge in America where they could exercise their freedom to express their own ideas of religion.  After the War of Independence, the founding fathers formed the Congress that drafted the 10 amendments.  The first amendment brings the people freedom of speech, which includes religion.  However, the very same ideas that sought freedom in America later turned from being the persecuted to the persecutor, as these notions harassed new different thinkers.  The notion of cyclical history comes to mind when scientists like Alfred Kinsey are being silenced based on morality and unfounded facts.Kinsey (Liam Neeson), a biologist, was brought up under strict puritan rules, as his father consistently proclaimed being the ultimate source of knowledge.  In a sense he grew up with similar persecuting standards as Galileo, but instead of conforming to the rules he broke the bond with his father when he accepted a partial scholarship to Bowdoin to study biology.  Kinsey's father wanted him to become an engineer, which has a certain level of irony to it, as his father believed that all modern inventions at the beginning of the 20th century were evil.  The pursuit of the biology degree brought him through Harvard to Indiana University where he took a position as an assistant professor while studying stag beetles and later the American Cynipidae also known as the gall wasp.Years of research and collecting the American Cynipidae allowed Kinsey to meticulously catalogue his gall wasp library.  During this time Kinsey met his wife Clara (Laura Linney) with whom he had three children.  However, before having the children they had difficulties in the bedroom, as Clara assumed it was because they physically would not fit together.  This was an unacceptable answer for Kinsey who approached the problem, as if there were an answer, which there was.  It simply was painful for Clara to have sex as her hymen was too thick, and with a quick procedure by a doctor she had this fixed.  Consequently, Kinsey continued to help other couples with problems of sexual nature, but realized that he did not have any real answers to the questions that were posed to him.In the 1940s, Kinsey got his chance to do teach a marriage course in regards to sex and the social aspects of sex between husbands and wives.  As the class went on his interest deepened through the vast number of questions people asked in regards to sex.  This concluded in Kinsey beginning to research the taboo ridden topic, which so many have been taught to avoid at all costs except for the purpose of having children.  Kinsey opposed the abstinence with his statement, ""society has interfered with what should be a normal biological development...""The sex research forced Kinsey to travel uncharted waters, as he had to find a way to collect data that were valid and reliable.  Through this process he design an interview style that had to be nonjudgmental in order for the interviewee to reveal everything without having to feel any negative feelings.  This process gave them surprising facts about sex, as they also encountered homosexuality, extramarital affairs, and premarital affairs.  They also found evidence of deviant sexual practices, which most of the society rightfully did not tolerate such as pedophilia.  An important note to this is that Kinsey was only collecting data, he did not advocate harmful sexual practices.  However, in the eyes of the society Kinsey was in the end drawn into the mud, as much of his intentions was misunderstood.Nonetheless, Kinsey helped breaking the ice of the forbidden issue that in the end opened up the society to understanding this hushed, but normal behavior.  If Kinsey did not push the envelope the society might have continued its intolerance towards sexual issues, an intolerance that would force many to hide their true identity in the fear of repercussions and prejudice based on hatred and fear.  For example, John Edgar Hoover created a profiling center for homosexuals and other undesirables.  The very same intolerance would function as a shield that would have protected many of the Catholic priests that have been uncovered to molest children.  It is thanks to Kinsey and researchers alike that it has become acceptable to discuss this taboo topic in media, where horrendous crimes such as child molesting can be caught.  Yet, there are still many who believe that Kinsey was wrong to do what he did, and they are naturally free to have their own opinions.  As they should let the truth be unveiled from darkness and not let erotophobia, i.e., learned negative emotional response to information of sexual nature, affect any decision-making that could help human beings discover a better future.Kinsey is a political and potent film that will undoubtedly make many feel awkward and uncomfortable.  Yet, it is also an important film, as it displays the importance of learning the truth and not hiding behind groundless rules and laws based on fictionalized morality.  The film also has historical value to our contemporary society where many laws often are passed based on morality, which ends up hurting a fraction of the society and slows the progress of humanity.  When this happens, history seems to be have drifted into oblivion as prejudice and intolerance continues to haunt the society.  Hopefully, the film Kinsey offers an opportunity for debate and insightfulness, and not continued narrow-mindedness.",5,Potent Film with Certain Foundation for Heated Debate...,1117152000,"05 27,

886061,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,B0007PALGG,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[4, 5]","Dr. Alfred Kinsey's pioneering research into the sexual behavior of humans, resulting in two monumental books that appeared after World War II, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, is acknowledged both by his supporters and detractors to have been one of the seminal causes of the so-called Sexual Revolution in America. It is to Bill Condon's credit that in writing and directing this film biography he has avoided sensationalizing its subject while not shying away from its discomforting aspects.Using Kinsey's technique of face-to-face interviews with his subjects as a framing device, his life work is shown together with the complex nature of the man himself and his personal relationships. Liam Neeson in the title role conveys Kinsey's bluster, single-minded obsessiveness, tenderness and frailty all rolled together into a superb performance, with Laura Linney matching him in commitment as Clara ""Mac,"" his wife. An unusually large and lustrous supporting cast surrounds them, among them luminaries such as Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Tim Curry and, in an unexpected and moving cameo near the end, Lynn Redgrave. Peter Sarsgaard, as Clyde Martin, Kinsey's assistant and sometime lover both to him and his wife, must be singled out for his nuanced interpretation of a complex character, which includes a male-to-male seduction scene of a frankness and complexity rarely seen in American film. It is startling to realize that this is the same actor who played Hilary Swank's brutal rapist and murderer in Boys Don't Cry. While the pacing is occasionally over-stately, and the biopic format results in some rather formulaic film devices, such as the montage of talking heads superimposed on a U.S. map representing the extent of the Kinsey team's research, the look and feel of the entire film unobtrusively but superbly conveys the period and Midwestern academic locale (one is surprised to learn that much of it was shot in New York and the Tri-State area). Without heavy-handed preaching, Kinsey makes us aware both of how far society has come since the days of his research and, sadly, how far it still has to go.The latest DVD release, a deluxe two-disc set, is worth having mainly for the engrossing hour-and-a-half documentary about the making of the film, in which interviews with director Bill Condon and producer Gail Mutrux tie together a multitude of topics including the conception of the original idea, difficulties in financing the film, and most vividly the trials involved in doing a major production on a tight budget and severely constrained shooting schedule. The rest includes the usual packages of deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers and--rather more interesting--a viewer's own do-it-him/herself sex survey.",5,"Carefully crafted, engrossing film biography",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2792,"['Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'pioneering', 'research', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'humans', 'resulting', 'two', 'monumental', 'books', 'appeared', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Female', 'acknowledged', 'supporters', 'detractors', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'seminal', 'causes', 'so-called', 'Sexual', 'Revolution', 'America', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'credit', 'writing', 'directing', 'film', 'biography', 'avoided', 'sensationalizing', 'subject', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'discomforting', 'aspects.Using', 'Kinsey', 'technique', 'face-to-face', 'interviews', 'subjects', 'framing', 'device', 'life', 'work', 'shown', 'together', 'complex', 'nature', 'man', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'title', 'role', 'conveys', 'Kinsey', 'bluster', 'single-minded', 'obsessiveness', 'tenderness', 'frailty', 'rolled', 'together', 'superb', 'performance', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'matching', 'commitment', 'Clara', 'Mac', 'wife', 'unusually', 'large', 'lustrous', 'supporting', 'cast', 'luminaries', 'such', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'unexpected', 'moving', 'cameo', 'end', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Clyde', 'Martin', 'Kinsey', 'assistant', 'sometime', 'lover', 'wife', 'must', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'nuanced', 'interpretation', 'complex', 'character', 'male-to-male', 'seduction', 'scene', 'frankness', 'complexity', 'rarely', 'seen', 'American', 'film', 'startling', 'realize', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'brutal', 'rapist', 'murderer', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'pacing', 'occasionally', 'over-stately', 'biopic', 'format', 'results', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'film', 'devices', 'such', 'montage', 'talking', 'heads', 'superimposed', 'U.S.', 'map', 'representing', 'extent', 'Kinsey', 'team', 'research', 'look', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'unobtrusively', 'superbly', 'conveys', 'period', 'Midwestern', 'academic', 'locale', 'one', 'surprised', 'learn', 'much', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'Tri-State', 'area', 'heavy-handed', 'preaching', 'Kinsey', 'aware', 'how', 'far', 'society', 'come', 'days', 'research', 'sadly', 'how', 'far', 'still', 'go.The', 'latest', 'DVD', 'release', 'deluxe', 'two-disc', 'set', 'worth', 'having', 'mainly', 'engrossing', 'hour-and-a-half', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'interviews', 'director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'producer', 'Gail', 'Mutrux', 'together', 'multitude', 'topics', 'including', 'conception', 'original', 'idea', 'difficulties', 'financing', 'film', 'most', 'vividly', 'trials', 'involved', 'doing', 'major', 'production', 'tight', 'budget', 'severely', 'constrained', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'rest', 'usual', 'packages', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'trailers', 'rather', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'own', 'do-it-him/herself', 'sex', 'survey']",N/A
886062,AFK9D6U1HKQER,B0007PALGG,Konstantin,"[11, 44]","Good news: relatively good filming, camera, etc.Bad news: everything else, especially concerning the historical/ethical/intellectual content of this trash...ok. I first learned about Kinsey-the-pervert while watching ""The Kinsey Syndrome"" documentary. Please note! It was a documentary, in comparison to this deifying fairy tale of seemingly smart pseudo-intellectual ""scientist"". Surely, producers 'made' him look smart, which is evident by the control over the persons he has dialogues with. THE PERVERT is presented obviously smarter.Furhtermore, the sane people with sane morals are presented as  ""religious fundamentalists"" idiots with phobia of technology. As ironic as it can get, technology indeed multiplied perverts' influence. Without going to details, consider the fact that the third of Internet content is porn. But that's ok nowadays. Science has liberated people.To establish THE PERVERT's credibility what better than biology can be used? duh! Isn't the greatest men, like Charlie Darwin was also revolutionary scientist???!!! So, by sticking THE PERVERT (Kinsey) with love of science of biology (which became 'his sanctuary')- magic happens. This of course leads to the great science of the sort like measuring the shape of a human scull (obviously scientific process, because it involves measurement) to derive the intellectual capacities of an individual. This is sort of ""science"" THE PERVERT and CO. used on gullible Americans. To put it in the historical context, consider using stop-watches to 'measure' length of 'orgasms' in children as young as several months, as if it were 'scientific' method being applied to human psyche, when in reality it is simply child rape, molestation, and abuse being documented.So, if you know what Find-and-replace function in computer application is, then consider following(find-and-replace function simply finds one word or expression and substitutes it for another by user's request):get THE PERVERT's typed documentation [sort of like the ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"") and substitute every word ""orgasm"" when it related to a child for ""rape"", ""molestation"", etc. What THE PERVERT and CO. did, was simply playing with, and substituting the words, but the poor, defenseless children being raped did not feel any better back then (in  1930s-1950s), ..then what they would feel nowadays. The disgusting rapes which ruined lives of children recorded as ""scientific"" observable facts in way that 'ducks do not sink, and hatch eggs' is observable fact of biology.-What happens when a thief gets a PhD? Does he stop stealing? no. He is now ""white collar"" thief, and steals in greater quantities.-What happens when a Nazi gets a PhD? Does he become humane? no. He writes his dissertation on how much is there porphological evidence to support that all his opponents (jews, slavs, blacks) are sub-human.ok, now. THE PERVERT in the movie says ""consider the implications. If every single living thing is different from every other living thing, then DIVERSITY becomes life's one irreducible fact. Only variations are real. You simply have to open your eyes."". Hmmm, did I hear 'irreducible complexity' from the sicko atheist? ;)[...]- The diversity is in NO WAY a prescriptive. ok? The diversity is only a inference from the observation of events around. There is nothing about diversity that makes it normative. Diversity simply is. But SHOULD it be?Now, if I were to survey various human views about other human beings, and if I were to survey actions of human beings in relation to other human beings, I would find a DIVERSITY of views and actions. For instance: KKK, Satanism, cannibalism, hugging, kissing, giving gifts, and donating blood, killing, raping, stealing, throwing fetuses in trash can, eating aborted fetuses, eating hamburgers, eating only vegetables, watching sport, buying a car, and buying a slave-sex on slave market.... etc. Now, what does it tell me about the DIVERSITY? Is the list provided gives the normal, permissible, list of human affairs?I hope not. Alright? There is HUGE if not uncrossable difference between what action IS and what action OUGHT to be. The difference is between descriptive statement about some action and the prescriptive statement about some action. For instance, people DO kill their parents (if you follow news, you know that), but SHOULD they?Same about homosexuality, pedophilia, necrophilia, incest, beastiality, polygamy etc. All those can be found around. So, by the virtue of diversity being the 'holy rule' should we now legalize marriage between a corpse and a male simply because it does not harm anyone?'Diversity' has NOTHING to do with normative statements or even comforting statements about the world, like 'look I am pedophile, how diverse am I'.This 'movie' is a shameful entry on actors' resume and blow to any respect of them.

There's also general discussion about bestiality and admissions of participation in same. Sound like your cup of tea?Liam Neeson plays the obsessed researcher, the product of a repressed and unyielding household who, like his father -- played very well by John Lithgow -- has no capability to see, understand or accept behavior beyond his personal frame of reference.While the biopic concentrates on the way Kinsey moved from biology to sexual researched and the way his work changed the world, it is his intolerance that most characterizes Kinsey in the film. Neeson, who is something of a johnny one note as an actor, is exceptionally well suited to play the role this way.The movie industry loved this flick and, to enusre it got some notoriety, the Motion Picture Academy nominated Laura Linney -- who played Mrs. Kinsey -- for a best actress award. Linney was fine in her role but I thought she was better and more meaningful in Showtime's made-for-cable flick ""Wild Iris"", where she received no press or awards.Bill Condon wrote the script and directed the film, which was largely shot at New York's Columbia University, a time zone and far cry from the Indiana University campus where most of the action takes place.

886064,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007PALGG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","Despite the fact that my background in science is so monumentally limited that all of my friends and families know to keep sticking me with science questions at the end of a game of Trivial Pursuit, I found myself thinking in scientific terms while watching ""Kinsey.""  This 2004 film written and directed by Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"") tells the story of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, a professor of entomology and zoology who published a study of human sexual behavior in 1948 and founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University, which is now known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction.  Kinsey is remembered because his research on human sexuality is credited with (or blamed for) the sexual revolution of the 1960s.  In this film we learn how and why Kinsey (Liam Neeson) shifted from studying gall wasps to human sexuality.  The ""how"" was primarily by conducting face-to-face interviews with everybody who would submit to the questionnaire he had put together.  The ""why"" was because apparently nobody in American really knew what they were doing when it came to sex and Kinsey thought whatever he found out from his surveys would be worth knowing.By main thought about Kinsey's research along scientific lines was about the Heisenberg effect, which declares that the observation or measurement of something changes that which is being observed or measured.  I have no problem with the idea that Kinsey's research has flaws in it, since such things are inherent in any study that is either groundbreaking or based on volunteers (and this one was both).  But I think he had to be in the ballpark and before him that is no substantive body of research to challenge him one way or the other.  The chief argument against Kinsey's data has been that in studying sex the way he did he affected his data and skewed it to his own tastes, which were apparently quite liberal.  But it is hard to argue with the ideas advanced in this film that most Americans were woefully ignorant about sex and that ""normal"" is a statistical consideration rather than a moral dictate.The main thing that makes us raise an eyebrow at Kinsey's research is not his subject matter, but rather the participation he encouraged on the part of his researchers.  There is an impulse to consider this sexual permissiveness as a prelude to the sexual revolution, but you have to remember that at this point in time in the social sciences participation could be considered as valid an approach as empirical observation.  Still, there is no denying that a ""scientific"" approach to sexuality, freed from moral strictures (puritanical or otherwise) and reduced to a biological imperative, results by definition in permissiveness.  In breaking new ground it is not surprising that Kinsey showed naivet&eacute; in thinking that the simple rules that nobody should ever do anything they did not want to do and that nobody should ever be hurt (e.g., ""romantic entanglements"" were only for spouses) were going to work with human beings having sex.However, Kinsey's mantra on sex in this film is reduced to the key idea that everybody's sin is nobody's sin, with the corollary that sins should not be crimes.  Beyond that Kinsey insists that, just like gall wasps, everybody is different, although he recognizes there is a human desire to be like everybody else.  That certainly reduces human sexuality to the level of an oxymoron.  Granted, Kinsey was a flawed human being whose own sexual practices could be considered suspect, but his key sexual experience in ""Kinsey"" is the disastrous wedding night with his wife Clara (Laura Linney).  It is important because neither one of them knows what they are doing or what they should be doing.  Kinsey's big breakthrough is that they decided to go see an expert, who explains why they are having problems and what they can do to solve the problem.That forgotten doctor becomes the important symbolic figure fir ne in this story because he represents the fact that the truth was out there all the time.  There were doctors who could answer questions about sex and who could help solve problems, both physiological and psychological.  All people had to do was ask, but, as the movie clearly indicates, that was a problem.  In the end the Kinsey legacy is not the idea that anything goes but rather that ignorance and repression have been doing a lot of harm.  That is a valid point to raise today as the polarization of the nation into ""red"" states and ""blue"" states accelerates.  If there is one irreducible lesson to be taken from ""Kinsey,"" the film or the man, it is that people should at least be able to talk about sex with their partners and their doctors.  That might be a slim area of agreement, but it is certainly worth preserving.",5,According to Kinsey talking about sex would be a good thing,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,4787,"['fact', 'background', 'science', 'so', 'monumentally', 'limited', 'friends', 'families', 'know', 'keep', 'sticking', 'science', 'questions', 'end', 'game', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'found', 'thinking', 'scientific', 'terms', 'watching', 'Kinsey', '2004', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'C.', 'Kinsey', 'professor', 'entomology', 'zoology', 'who', 'published', 'study', 'human', 'sexual', 'behavior', '1948', 'founded', 'Institute', 'Sex', 'Research', 'Indiana', 'University', 'now', 'known', 'Kinsey', 'Institute', 'Research', 'Sex', 'Gender', 'Reproduction', 'Kinsey', 'remembered', 'research', 'human', 'sexuality', 'credited', 'blamed', 'sexual', 'revolution', '1960s', 'film', 'learn', 'how', 'why', 'Kinsey', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'shifted', 'studying', 'gall', 'wasps', 'human', 'sexuality', 'how', 'was', 'primarily', 'conducting', 'face-to-face', 'interviews', 'everybody', 'who', 'would', 'submit', 'questionnaire', 'had', 'put', 'together', 'why', 'was', 'because', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'American', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'came', 'sex', 'Kinsey', 'thought', 'whatever', 'found', 'out', 'surveys', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'knowing.By', 'main', 'thought', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'scientific', 'lines', 'was', 'Heisenberg', 'effect', 'observation', 'measurement', 'something', 'changes', 'being', 'observed', 'measured', 'have', 'problem', 'idea', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'flaws', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'inherent', 'study', 'groundbreaking', 'based', 'volunteers', 'one', 'was', 'think', 'had', 'be', 'ballpark', 'substantive', 'body', 'research', 'challenge', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'chief', 'argument', 'Kinsey', 'data', 'been', 'studying', 'sex', 'way', 'did', 'affected', 'data', 'skewed', 'own', 'tastes', 'were', 'apparently', 'quite', 'liberal', 'hard', 'argue', 'ideas', 'advanced', 'film', 'most', 'Americans', 'were', 'woefully', 'ignorant', 'sex', 'normal', 'statistical', 'consideration', 'rather', 'moral', 'dictate.The', 'main', 'thing', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'rather', 'participation', 'encouraged', 'part', 'researchers', 'impulse', 'consider', 'sexual', 'permissiveness', 'prelude', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'have', 'remember', 'point', 'time', 'social', 'sciences', 'participation', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'valid', 'approach', 'empirical', 'observation', 'Still', 'denying', 'scientific', 'approach', 'sexuality', 'freed', 'moral', 'strictures', 'puritanical', 'otherwise', 'reduced', 'biological', 'imperative', 'results', 'definition', 'permissiveness', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'not', 'surprising', 'Kinsey', 'showed', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'thinking', 'simple', 'rules', 'nobody', 'should', 'ever', 'do', 'anything', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'nobody', 'should', 'ever', 'be', 'hurt', 'e.g.', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'were', 'only', 'spouses', 'were', 'going', 'work', 'human', 'beings', 'having', 'sex.However', 'Kinsey', 'mantra', 'sex', 'film', 'reduced', 'key', 'idea', 'everybody', 'sin', 'nobody', 'sin', 'corollary', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'crimes', 'Beyond', 'Kinsey', 'just', 'gall', 'wasps', 'everybody', 'different', 'human', 'desire', 'be', 'everybody', 'else', 'certainly', 'human', 'sexuality', 'level', 'oxymoron', 'Granted', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'own', 'sexual', 'practices', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'suspect', 'key', 'sexual', 'experience', 'Kinsey', 'disastrous', 'wedding', 'night', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'important', 'one', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'Kinsey', 'big', 'breakthrough', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'expert', 'who', 'why', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'solve', 'problem.That', 'doctor', 'important', 'symbolic', 'figure', 'fir', 'ne', 'story', 'fact', 'truth', 'was', 'there', 'time', 'were', 'doctors', 'who', 'could', 'answer', 'questions', 'sex', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'solve', 'problems', 'physiological', 'psychological', 'people', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'ask', 'movie', 'clearly', 'was', 'problem', 'end', 'Kinsey', 'legacy', 'not', 'idea', 'anything', 'rather', 'ignorance', 'repression', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'lot', 'harm', 'valid', 'point', 'raise', 'today', 'polarization', 'nation', 'red', 'states', 'blue', 'states', 'one', 'irreducible', 'lesson', 'be', 'taken', 'Kinsey', 'film', 'man', 'people', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'sex', 'partners', 'doctors', 'might', 'be', 'slim', 'area', 'agreement', 'certainly', 'worth', 'preserving']",N/A

I am struck by the candor, the directness, the calling a spade-a-spade frankness of the entire scene.What is unfortunately sad and hurtful about the scene is that it would never happen today: 50 years later.With the FCC cracking down on what is said or shown on TV, PBS stations refusing to air certain sexually explicit scenes and the Moral Majority generally railing against anything sexual, it is obvious that we have taken a large step back from Kinsey's time even though, to be honest, Kinsey was himself, after not too long, taken down by a number of academic and governmental agencies himself. He and his groundbreaking work, of course have since been vindicated.Whether or not,""Kinsey's"" director Bill Condon (the superb ""Gods and Monsters"") wanted to make a comment on Life 2005, he has by the sheer weight and breath of his subject matter as presented on the screen.Alfred Kinsey and Clara Kinsey were bigger than life and though Kinsey was a Dr. of Zoology his warm demeanor and deep sense of caring soon brought his students to his office with questions and advice about life, society and particularly Sex. And so Kinsey began his quest to enlighten and remove barriers about the then (and now, really) taboo subject of Sex.Liam Neeson does a remarkable job in the difficult role of Kinsey: driven and driving as well as warm yet brittle and cold when need be. His Kinsey is a man conflicted about what he is doing yet does it because his need to teach and enlighten is stronger than his natural tendency to be shy and out of the limelight.Laura Linney as Clara Kinsey is not called on to do much but be supportive, but she has a couple of scenes with Peter Sarsgaard (as one of Kinsey's assistants, Clyde Martin) that are jewel boxes full of intuitive and understated yet demonstrative acting.If there is anything amiss in ""Kinsey"" it is the scene with a sexual predator and psychotic,Kenneth Braun (William Sadler), which seems out-of-place and tacked on in order to add more fuel to the fire, as it were.""Kinsey"" is an extremely important film particularly in these times of repression and censure.

886074,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007PALGG,mirasreviews,"[6, 8]","""Kinsey"" is the story of the life and research of Dr. Alfred Kinsey, the University of Indiana zoology professor whose 1948 study ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" got Americans talking about sex. Writer/director Bill Condon consulted Kinsey biographies, the Kinsey Institute, and some of those who knew the man in writing Kinsey's life story for the screen. The film uses the device of Kinsey (Liam Neeson) giving his sex history to an interviewer -which he did many times in training his researchers- to frame and pace the narrative. This provides a convenient means of exploring significant events in Kinsey's life while skipping over others without seeming clumsy. ""Kinsey"" follows the professor's life from his childhood as the son of a puritanical Methodist minister, through his 20-year study of gall wasps, his relationship with his wife Clara ""Mac"" McMillen (Laura Linney), teaching UI's first ""marriage course"" that was Kinsey's introduction to sex research and the beginning of his crusade for education, through the research for his best-selling book on male sexuality and the public wrath brought by his book on female sexuality.Needless to say, Liam Neeson doesn't look like Alfred Kinsey, but he conveys just the right combination of academic nerdiness and enthusiastic curiosity to make the audience understand why Kinsey embraced sex research and education with the same obsessive zeal that he approached all of his projects. Laura Linney is wonderful as his perceptive and tolerant wife, through whom the film puts Kinsey and his research in perspective. The supporting cast is like a who's who of New York stage actors and Hollywood character actors. Peter Sarsgaard always brings something interesting to his characters, and here he is Kinsey's seductive assistant Clyde Martin. Timothy Hutton and Chris O'Donnell play the other research assistants whose interviews of various volunteers give the film some laugh-out-loud moments. John Lithgow makes Kinsey's father an interesting character to watch even though the man seems one-dimensional, rather like a broken record. ""Kinsey"" is a biopic that reveals the story and the personalities behind America's most famous sex study, as well as the impact that boiling everything down to numbers had on the researchers and their families.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 single disc release): Although there is a 2-disc Special Edition available, the only bonus feature on the single disc is an audio commentary by writer/director Bill Condon. The commentary is heavy on the process of getting the film financed and made, with occasional analysis of scenes, discussion of characters, themes, and style.

Kinsey's respondents in his survey were all self-selected, as opposed to a randomly sampled selection of participants.  Self-selected participants of a sex survey in 1948 were, not surprisingly, an abberrent representation of the population.  Additionally, as it was so difficult finding respondents, Kinsey redefined ""married"" women as any woman cohabitating with a man for more than a year.  This resulted in prostitutes and others on the margins of society being labeled as typical American housewives.Kinsey set out to prove that all children are sexual from the moment of birth, and that only ""repressive"" societal attitudes precluded children from enjoyment as sexual beings.  He enlisted pedophiles to violate young children, and record their results.  To read the data about the systematic rape and molestation of children and infants as young as 2 months old is to be sickened.Judith Reisman has written numerous books on Kinsey, and many of her articles and op-eds can be found online.

That's the impression one can get from the opening scenes--but fortunately, the film improves as it goes on.The film is structured as a series of vignettes based on the sort of questions that were posed in the Kinsey Report which was widely read and published in the '50s--and to some degree it works. We see how Kinsey himself came to regard sex and the study of it.JOHN LITHGOW is his puritan, uptight father (""The decline of the Roman Empire was due to too frequent use of bathing""), revealed through questions posed by CHRIS O'DONNELL and TIMOTHY HUTTON as Kinsey workers being trained to ask the probing questions. LIAM NEESON has the title role as the professor with the bold teaching methods unafraid to talk about sex. LAURA LINNEY is the forthright student who encounters Kinsey at college and forms a relationship with him. She's a brilliant scholar, a free thinker with a profound love of nature.Unfortunately, watching some of the scenes unfold are like watching paint dry despite sincere performances by Neeson and Linney who hold the story together. The first awkward sexual experience between Neeson and Linney in marriage is almost painfully awkward and unsettling to watch. We realize while watching the early portions of the film that we were really in the dark about sexuality until Kinsey boldly brought forth talk about masturbation, homosexuality, oral sex, etc., which all were taboo subjects that kept everyone in the dark until his study was released.Despite all the graphic sex talk, the film itself manages to be rather more dry than might be expected--and preachy, at that, when dealing with the regulations that governed sexual conduct in the 1950s and long before we treated sex as candidly as we do today in the media.But it has to be commended for making a strong point about raising a significant question: What is normal? Until ""The Kinsey Report"" came out, nobody had the foggiest idea, so enormous was his contribution. Everybody read the report to find out if they were normal! We've come a long way since then. There's a lot to be said for the kind of enlightenment that came with ""the report"" that took most Americans out of the dark ages.But oddly enough, with all the sex talk, the film is largely non-stimulating. Too bad there weren't more scenes like the one between JOHN LITHGOW and LIAM NEESON when Neeson convinces his father to be a subject for his report. OLIVIER PLATT gives a good performance as a fellow scientist and all of the supporting roles are well played by a fine cast. Nice work by LYNN REDGRAVE as a woman who, thanks to Kinsey, realizes she's not the only woman in the world to experience Lesbian tendencies and find fulfillment with a woman. And PETER SARSGAARD is wonderful as the bisexual who shares a torrid kissing scene with Neeson.Summing up: Uneven film has many moments of truth leading up to publication of ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male""--and later, an equally well read study of the female--which became huge best-sellers and delivered a lot of folks from a life of ignorance about a topic dearest to their hearts.",4,Puritan America's sexual awakening through Kinsey...,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3225,"['never', 'occurred', 'watching', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Kinsey', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'dry', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'impression', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'opening', 'scenes', 'fortunately', 'film', 'on.The', 'film', 'structured', 'series', 'vignettes', 'based', 'sort', 'questions', 'were', 'posed', 'Kinsey', 'Report', 'was', 'widely', 'read', 'published', ""'50s"", 'degree', 'see', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'came', 'regard', 'sex', 'study', 'it.JOHN', 'LITHGOW', 'puritan', 'uptight', 'father', 'decline', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'was', 'due', 'too', 'frequent', 'use', 'bathing', 'revealed', 'questions', 'posed', 'CHRIS', ""O'DONNELL"", 'TIMOTHY', 'HUTTON', 'Kinsey', 'workers', 'being', 'trained', 'ask', 'probing', 'questions', 'LIAM', 'NEESON', 'title', 'role', 'professor', 'bold', 'teaching', 'methods', 'unafraid', 'talk', 'sex', 'LAURA', 'LINNEY', 'forthright', 'student', 'who', 'Kinsey', 'college', 'relationship', 'brilliant', 'scholar', 'free', 'thinker', 'profound', 'love', 'nature.Unfortunately', 'watching', 'scenes', 'are', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'sincere', 'performances', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'who', 'hold', 'story', 'together', 'first', 'awkward', 'sexual', 'experience', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'marriage', 'almost', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'unsettling', 'watch', 'realize', 'watching', 'early', 'portions', 'film', 'were', 'really', 'dark', 'sexuality', 'Kinsey', 'boldly', 'brought', 'forth', 'talk', 'masturbation', 'homosexuality', 'oral', 'sex', 'etc.', 'were', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'kept', 'everyone', 'dark', 'study', 'was', 'released.Despite', 'graphic', 'sex', 'talk', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'more', 'dry', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'preachy', 'when', 'dealing', 'regulations', 'governed', 'sexual', 'conduct', '1950s', 'long', 'treated', 'sex', 'as', 'candidly', 'do', 'today', 'media.But', 'be', 'commended', 'making', 'strong', 'point', 'raising', 'significant', 'question', 'What', 'normal', 'Kinsey', 'Report', 'came', 'out', 'nobody', 'had', 'foggiest', 'idea', 'so', 'enormous', 'was', 'contribution', 'Everybody', 'read', 'report', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'normal', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', 'then', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'kind', 'enlightenment', 'came', 'report', 'took', 'most', 'Americans', 'dark', 'ages.But', 'oddly', 'enough', 'sex', 'talk', 'film', 'largely', 'non-stimulating', 'Too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'scenes', 'one', 'JOHN', 'LITHGOW', 'LIAM', 'NEESON', 'when', 'Neeson', 'father', 'be', 'subject', 'report', 'OLIVIER', 'PLATT', 'good', 'performance', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'fine', 'cast', 'Nice', 'work', 'LYNN', 'REDGRAVE', 'woman', 'who', 'thanks', 'Kinsey', 'not', 'only', 'woman', 'world', 'experience', 'Lesbian', 'tendencies', 'find', 'fulfillment', 'woman', 'PETER', 'SARSGAARD', 'wonderful', 'bisexual', 'who', 'shares', 'torrid', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Neeson.Summing', 'up', 'Uneven', 'film', 'many', 'moments', 'truth', 'leading', 'up', 'publication', 'Sexual', 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'later', 'equally', 'well', 'read', 'study', 'female', 'became', 'huge', 'best-sellers', 'delivered', 'lot', 'folks', 'life', 'ignorance', 'topic', 'dearest', 'hearts']",N/A
886079,A1129LM24YWSZV,B0007PALGG,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[3, 4]","Before I watched this film, I already knew a little bit about Kinsey. I took a course on human love and sexuality in college, and we talked quite a bit about his work as part of that curriculum. I thought a dramatization of his life and work would be fascinating, and it was.Kinsey was a biologist who broke from studying gall wasps in the 1940s to focus on human sexuality. He'd noticed that there was no actual scientific research on the subject, and he was appalled at the misinformation (and moral stranglehold) on the subject in society. He conducted thousands of face-to-face interviews with subjects about their sex histories, and he published two volumes about sexual behavior (male and female). The Kinsey Institute (which studies sex, gender, and reproduction) still operates today at Indiana University.I freely acknowledge that the film, at times, can be difficult to watch. Kinsey definitely contains nudity and sensitive subject matter. However, the grounding force of it all became Liam Neeson, in an inspired turn as the troubled scientist. He becomes the mouthpiece for many of Kinsey's actual complaints - how the subject of sex was closeted in American society, how difficult it was to find funding for sex research because of moral overtones, how we as a society could not begin to discuss sex with any certainty because we hadn't studied it, etc. Neeson played Kinsey with such sensitivity, such professionalism; he was the heart of the film.I also appreciated how the film dealt with the personal issues/problems of the various characters, including Kinsey, his wife, and the members of his research staff. It illustrated how difficult it probably was for all of them to study sex, think about sex, talk about sex all the time without it affecting them in adverse ways. It showed how difficult it was for them to separate the sex act from the idea/feeling of love. (There was a wonderful premise introduced early in the film about how Kinsey decided that love couldn't be studied because it was impossible to measure. So Kinsey studied sex, the closest thing to love that he could study. I like that sentiment, for some reason.)Anyway, if you are interested in Kinsey, his life, and his work, I think this film is a fairly accurate treatment of the man. Be prepared for nudity and adult issues, but most of all, be prepared to ask yourself questions and re-examine what you think about sex, love, and society.",4,Let's talk about sex.,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2431,"['watched', 'film', 'already', 'knew', 'little', 'bit', 'Kinsey', 'took', 'course', 'human', 'love', 'sexuality', 'college', 'talked', 'quite', 'bit', 'work', 'part', 'curriculum', 'thought', 'dramatization', 'life', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'was', 'biologist', 'who', 'broke', 'studying', 'gall', 'wasps', '1940s', 'focus', 'human', 'sexuality', ""'d"", 'noticed', 'was', 'actual', 'scientific', 'research', 'subject', 'was', 'appalled', 'misinformation', 'moral', 'stranglehold', 'subject', 'society', 'conducted', 'thousands', 'face-to-face', 'interviews', 'subjects', 'sex', 'histories', 'published', 'two', 'volumes', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'male', 'female', 'Kinsey', 'Institute', 'studies', 'sex', 'gender', 'reproduction', 'still', 'today', 'Indiana', 'University.I', 'freely', 'acknowledge', 'film', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Kinsey', 'definitely', 'nudity', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'However', 'grounding', 'force', 'became', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'inspired', 'turn', 'troubled', 'scientist', 'mouthpiece', 'many', 'Kinsey', 'actual', 'complaints', 'how', 'subject', 'sex', 'was', 'closeted', 'American', 'society', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'find', 'funding', 'sex', 'research', 'moral', 'overtones', 'how', 'society', 'could', 'not', 'begin', 'discuss', 'sex', 'certainty', 'had', ""n't"", 'studied', 'etc', 'Neeson', 'played', 'Kinsey', 'such', 'sensitivity', 'such', 'professionalism', 'was', 'heart', 'film.I', 'also', 'appreciated', 'how', 'film', 'dealt', 'personal', 'issues/problems', 'various', 'characters', 'including', 'Kinsey', 'wife', 'members', 'research', 'staff', 'illustrated', 'how', 'difficult', 'probably', 'was', 'study', 'sex', 'think', 'sex', 'talk', 'sex', 'time', 'affecting', 'adverse', 'ways', 'showed', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'separate', 'sex', 'act', 'idea/feeling', 'love', 'was', 'wonderful', 'premise', 'introduced', 'early', 'film', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'decided', 'love', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'studied', 'was', 'impossible', 'measure', 'So', 'Kinsey', 'studied', 'sex', 'closest', 'thing', 'love', 'could', 'study', 'like', 'sentiment', 'reason', 'Anyway', 'are', 'interested', 'Kinsey', 'life', 'work', 'think', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'treatment', 'man', 'Be', 'prepared', 'nudity', 'adult', 'issues', 'most', 'be', 'prepared', 'ask', 'questions', 're-examine', 'what', 'think', 'sex', 'love', 'society']",N/A

886081,A3D3YRAOMY3J12,B0007PALGG,"paygenie ""Pianist and sheet music collector""","[4, 5]","This review discusses: The content of T.C. Boyle's 2004 novel ""The Inner Circle,"" the performance of it by Richard Kramer (the book on tape), and Bill Condon's 2004 film, ""Kinsey.""Given that both Boyle and Condon each fictionalized their own accounts of famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, it is surprising how similar ""The Inner Circle"" and ""Kinsey"" are. The film is a Cliffs Notes version, while the book more thoroughly chronicles Kinsey's beginnings as a biologist studying gall wasps to eventually becoming an international celebrity with his groundbreaking work in sex research. Boyle, who has approximately 400 pages to cover the subject, gives a much more detailed account than Condon, who only had the space of a 2-hour film. But Condon still manages to include a lot of the same highlights Boyle hits upon regarding Kinsey's research and his struggle to get it. Both the book and film pick out important aspects of Kinsey's research like talking to prostitutes, his interviewing techniques to gather sexual histories, talking to child molesters, etc. Both works also address his sexual relationships with his three male research assistants.Though similar, Boyle and Condon do present much different pictures of Kinsey. Boyle tells his story via the fictional John Milk, a virginal college student who becomes Kinsey's first assistant, and so this portrayal is almost God-like, as it is told through the eyes of a young protege who sees Kinsey as a daring scientist. The film, however, speaks omnisciently, better showing Kinsey's fragilities and even portraying Kinsey's slight sex shyness (while in the book Kinsey has no sexual hesitation at all). Kinsey's wife, ""Mac,"" comes off as loose and carefree in the book; in the film, she is tightly wound, nervous, and more concerned with conforming with the conservative society around her. In the book, Kinsey's first research assistant, Milk, is curious about and inexperienced with sex; in the film, the equivalent character is sexually adventurous and promiscuous from the get-go. In the book, Kinsey and Milk till a garden in the nude; in the film, they merely go shirtless.For a basic and rough intro of Kinsey, see the film, ""Kinsey."" In addition to the film's history lesson, film lovers will enjoy two very fine performances by Liam Neeson (as Kinsey) and Laura Linney (as Kinsey's wife, ""Mac.""). For a more thorough look, read the book, ""The Inner Circle."" If you are considering listening to the book on tape, a warning: Richard Kramer's performance is a bit monotonous. Yes, the character John Milk, who is narrating, is supposed to be mild-mannered, but Kramer's reading is a bit dead. I really think that T.C. Boyle himself should have read for the audiobook (I've seen him read from ""The Inner Circle,"" and he breathes life into it.)Overall, ""The Inner Circle"" is lackluster compared to Boyle's other works. It does a good job of telling history (a fictionalized version), but lacks the usual momentum of Boyle's page-turning style. The characters are a bit flat and unmemorable. Nonetheless it's clearly written the way Boyle writes. Expect his lucid narrative, his New Yorker-magazine-like vocabulary (i.e. succurus, insouciant, macaroni et formage), and his chapter/section endings that leave you in suspense.I saw the film ""Kinsey"" on the single-disc DVD. Let me tell you there are absolutely no special features on it, just the director commentary. Not even the trailer is on it! There's only a preview for an Orlando Bloom/Liam Neeson film, and you can watch the film with English or SPanish subtitles, and audio track in Spanish or English 5.1 or English DTS. The producers, wickedly so, also released a two-disc special edition DVD the same time as the single disc. The special edition has loads of special features. So if you're not sure if you'll end up loving the film, you might want to rent it first, and then if you love it, buy the 2-disc edition.

886082,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B0007PALGG,"Phred ""Phred""","[1, 1]","Placing stars on the movie Kinsey may be a mistake. This is one of the most complex movies I have ever attempted to analyze. The fact that an American tried to be this complex justifies five stars. Kinsey is ambitious but given the practical limitations of a commercial film complexities are introduced then either ignored, tabled or briefly discussed.First a little history: Dr. Alfred Kinsey led a team of researchers who in 1948 published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and followed that book with  Sexual Behavior in the Human Female in 1953. At that time these books represented a revolution that would challenge every American to think differently about human sexuality. Its text has been used to support changes in and thinking, counseling and legislating law. In America there had been nothing like this since Sigmund Freud. In the same way that Prof.  Freud would be controversial so would be the Kinsey report.Alfred Kinsey the man, was a zoologist indirectly if not hesitantly moved to study human sexuality. It is not too much to say that he invented this field of study.Given that the science of statistics in the 40s and 50s were not has finally developed as they are now Kinsey's solution to creating a research base to validate his eventual findings was to interview large numbers of people. This may have been a valid approach when he began his research. Ultimately his survey's cannot be considered as being random and therefore his finding suspect.Along the way he would build a team charged with finding ever more individuals to survey and to assist him in conducting experiments. There were no precedents for laboratory experiments conducted by directly observing and measuring via electronic instruments human beings engaged in various sexual activities.It is entirely possible that the real Alfred Kinsey lost his ability to maintain a distance from himself and his research. He would attempt to impose on his research team a science driven view of sex that disregarded human emotions. There is also evidence that he would either find his own real sexuality or allow his scientific curiosity to take him beyond who he really was.To return to the movie all of the above themes are at least attempted. Writing directing and acting all emphasize letting the story tell itself. It is left to the viewer to decide for themselves the degree to which science has been served and to ask if morality was ignored. This is not a movie for a person who is not prepared to think. Kinsey is not a movie for those who are offended by nudity or anything vaguely kinky. This is a movie that will demand that you pay attention to what is said to carry the discussions beyond what is said. Among the ambiguities are the ultimate value of Kinsey's work and the possibility that the man had compromised himself. It is to the movie's credit that the viewer is assumed to be intelligent write their own conclusions.Kinsay is a valid and valiant effort to tell an important history. The events flowing from the Kindsey Report and the methods used to conduct this investigation mattered and continue to matter. The movie gives you a taste of how America was asked to think about its sexual identity and values. The movie also reports on the human costs to make this a public discussion.  Kinsey attempts more than is accomplished.  This movie should be honored for the effort.",4,Lets Talk About Sex.

886083,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0007PALGG,Ping Lim,"[1, 2]","Initially, I thought the movie is about shock value.  The catchphrase of the movie is, ""Kinsey: Let's Talk About Sex"", is it not?  However, the movie turns out to be anything but.  It shows Kinsey (plays brilliantly by the underrated Liam Neeson) as a Professor obsessed with wasp only to shift his attention to sex later as he discovers that many people have misconceptions about the very same topic.  As the movie would divulge to us, his motivation is due to his own difficulty in fulfilling his marital vow in the very beginning.  Anyway, Kinsey is best described as ""Dr Spock"" from Star Treks, where everything needs to be logical, measurable and thus, the definition of it being science.  He is joined by his understudies (all top rated actors in the form of Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, Skaasgard) and for some viewers, they might find it repulsive to have their own sexual activities been monitored in the name of studying sexual behaviour and their abilities to segregate between love and sex.  In the first phase, he's supported by his university Head (Oliver Platt) and yet, he also has a strong opposition from another Professor in the form of Tim Curry.  Last but not least, the movie also reveals to us the estranged relationship between Kinsey and his father (John Lithgow who shows us his versatility to play a dramatic role) and how they reconcile with one another in the end.  The movie carries on until the latter stage of his life when support for Kinsey wanes and McCarthy's phobia on communism brings on the heat preventing Rockefeller Foundation from continuing on their support on Kinsey's research.  Still, one true thing remains, his staunch and supportive wife who continuously loving him till the very end (Laura Linney).  A gentle and tender movie that tries to be even-footed.  This is THE movie that enables us to see how much USA has evolved over the half century.  What used to be a no-no is now a common thing where people talk about sex openly as we can see in young people's MTV and TV programs such as Sex & The City and Desperate Wives.  I wish I get the 2 Disc edition in order to study more about Kinsey but this one disc edition is simply a movie and a movie only.

886084,A1S3IEVZI29T7H,B0007PALGG,"Raider Jack ""Jackie D Gray-Romeyn""","[3, 4]","Kinsey is a powerful presentation whose major strength lies in the issues it forces us to confront and the surprise we experience when we realize that while indeed sexual attitudes have relaxed somewhat, one would have thought we would have come infinitely further these days - it is quite an eye-opener when we see that we indeed still have a ways to go.Liam Neeson and Laura Linney are a powerful pair giving wondrous performances as they personify the sex doctor and his intelligent wife.  The supporting cast rounds out the project to present a compelling look at sexual research and the price the man who tried to demystify sexual behavior had to pay for that research.Of course Dr Kinsey, in his quest to learn, totally discounted the emotional aspect of his study so that at times even his wife as well as a male liaison could not tell if he genuinhely cared about them or if they were simply subjects to be studied.  It is also a very interesting dichotomy that he ended up mistreating his own son exactly the way his father had mistreated him.The film should certainly spark discussion and I had to smile at myself when the realization set in that even some of the sexual issues addressed made me uncomfortable at first simply because they were so frankly dealt with.  I can imagine it must have been a REAL struggle in the 50s to tackle some of these subjects.Of course one of the biggest drawbacks to Dr Kinsey's research is that while he tried, almost blindly, to maintain objectivity in his quest for understanding sexual behavior, he unintentionally provided an avenue for those who had true seuxal dysfunctions that needed to be addressed in individual  therapy sessions, to compromise the integrity of the research.However, the biggest thing I applaud this film for exemplfying is that it very adequately supports my stance that in the final analysis sexual/emotional connection transcends sexual preference but is about the intimacy and timbre of the relationship itself.  Even in 2006 that is still a very powerful lesson to learn.I HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!!",5,Thought Provoking!!!!,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2074,"['Kinsey', 'powerful', 'presentation', 'major', 'strength', 'issues', 'confront', 'surprise', 'experience', 'when', 'realize', 'indeed', 'sexual', 'attitudes', 'have', 'relaxed', 'somewhat', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'infinitely', 'further', 'days', 'quite', 'eye-opener', 'when', 'see', 'indeed', 'still', 'have', 'ways', 'go.Liam', 'Neeson', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'powerful', 'pair', 'giving', 'wondrous', 'performances', 'personify', 'sex', 'doctor', 'intelligent', 'wife', 'supporting', 'cast', 'out', 'project', 'present', 'compelling', 'look', 'sexual', 'research', 'price', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'demystify', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'had', 'pay', 'research.Of', 'course', 'Dr', 'Kinsey', 'quest', 'learn', 'totally', 'discounted', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'study', 'so', 'that', 'times', 'even', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'male', 'liaison', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'genuinhely', 'cared', 'were', 'simply', 'subjects', 'be', 'studied', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'dichotomy', 'ended', 'up', 'mistreating', 'own', 'son', 'exactly', 'way', 'father', 'had', 'mistreated', 'him.The', 'film', 'should', 'certainly', 'spark', 'discussion', 'had', 'smile', 'when', 'realization', 'set', 'even', 'sexual', 'issues', 'addressed', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'first', 'simply', 'were', 'so', 'frankly', 'dealt', 'can', 'imagine', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'REAL', 'struggle', '50s', 'tackle', 'subjects.Of', 'course', 'one', 'biggest', 'drawbacks', 'Dr', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'tried', 'almost', 'blindly', 'maintain', 'objectivity', 'quest', 'understanding', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'unintentionally', 'provided', 'avenue', 'who', 'had', 'true', 'seuxal', 'dysfunctions', 'needed', 'be', 'addressed', 'individual', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'compromise', 'integrity', 'research.However', 'biggest', 'thing', 'applaud', 'film', 'exemplfying', 'very', 'adequately', 'stance', 'final', 'analysis', 'sexual/emotional', 'connection', 'sexual', 'preference', 'intimacy', 'timbre', 'relationship', 'Even', '2006', 'still', 'very', 'powerful', 'lesson', 'learn.I', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend']",N/A
886085,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B0007PALGG,R. A Rubin,"[3, 7]","I remember giggling about The Kinsey report in Jr. High School back in the fifties.  I was not sure exactly what it was about, but was also sure it had to do with excessive amounts of saliva.  The sexual revolution came thereafter and folks realized that knowledge is power, but knowledge is not always emotionally authentic.I do not know if Kinsey is true to Kinsey's life.  Kinsey seems to have discovered from the physiology route what Freud had already suggested from the psychological.  Using Freudian terms, civilization by its nature inhibits men and women for the practical systems, namely, the need for the father to know he has sired his own children in a non-incestuous marriage.  Anything that interferes with the propagation of offspring is subdued, namely homosexuality, pleasure, or any perversion that interferes with civilization.Another interesting discovery of Kinsey, in this script, Kinsey realizes that all of civilized humankind is striving to be normal sexually.  This herd instinct is in truth flying in the face of reality.  After thousands of interviews, the only conclusion that is absolute about sexuality in an inhibited world is its variance, vast variance.As for the story, a bio-flic, nothing very exciting happens.  After all, this is a stodgy man doing non-stodgy research.  His insufferable father molds the future bi-sexual.  The wife is a free spirit, and various sexual partners of both sexes make their appearances.  The research team is a bit too randy, and then Kinsey gets old and dies.  That is the plot.

This is an ""indie"" but I never would've realized that. The photography by Frederick Elmes was exquisite; period detail was completely caught by costumer Bruce Finlayson and set designer Richard Sherman. Especially impressive was the editing by Virginia Katz, keeping the narrative frantic, or calm & sweet, as necessary. Liam Neeson was perfect, as was Laura Linney as his wife. Excellent chemistry. Also were excellent performances from Peter Sarsgaard, Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Oliver Platt & Tim Curry (as a prude?). Two performances really blew me away: William Sadler as the ultimate sex-offender was so subtle and natural in his delivery that it was unsettling. Also, at the very end, a stunning and beautifully created cameo from Lynn Redgrave, giving Mr. Kinsey a sense of renewal. It's very hard for me to believe that there are people out there who don't realize that Mr. Kinsey meant well.

Kinsey the movie explains what motivated Kinsey the man, and the audience is allowed to see him as the flawed man he was while appreciating what he did for our understanding of ourselves. Liam Neeson and Laura Linney are excellent as the title character and his patient wife. The first hour of the film, especially, hums with energy, driven forward by a very effective framing device: the two of them answering the very sex questionnaire that we later see Kinsey developing for his first-of-its-kind study of sex. The second hour has a few stalls, as the framing device is sometimes abandoned for long stretches and time within the movie begins to pass more quickly and, occasionally, abruptly.Overall, the movie could use a bit more emotion--there's a sense of distancing in some of the performances--but the subject is undeniably interesting and simply watching Kinsey and his research team and how their study both enriches and complicates their lives is fascinating stuff. The movie ends with a pair of scenes that place both the man and his accomplishments in their proper perspective; watch for a virtuoso two-minute performance from Lynn Redgrave as she offers a benediction for Kinsey as his career begins to wane.This may be only the second-best mainstream biographical film of 2004--Ray would be hard to beat--but it's definitely worth watching.",4,"Imperfect, but Fittingly So",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,1468,"['difficult', 'review', 'movie', 'reviewing', 'man', 'accomplishment', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'Kinsey', 'movie', 'what', 'motivated', 'Kinsey', 'man', 'audience', 'allowed', 'see', 'flawed', 'man', 'was', 'appreciating', 'what', 'did', 'understanding', 'ourselves', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'excellent', 'title', 'character', 'patient', 'wife', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'especially', 'hums', 'energy', 'driven', 'forward', 'very', 'effective', 'framing', 'device', 'two', 'answering', 'very', 'sex', 'questionnaire', 'later', 'see', 'Kinsey', 'developing', 'first-of-its-kind', 'study', 'sex', 'second', 'hour', 'few', 'stalls', 'framing', 'device', 'sometimes', 'abandoned', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'movie', 'pass', 'more', 'quickly', 'occasionally', 'abruptly.Overall', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'emotion', 'sense', 'distancing', 'performances', 'subject', 'undeniably', 'interesting', 'simply', 'watching', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'team', 'how', 'study', 'enriches', 'lives', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'movie', 'pair', 'scenes', 'place', 'man', 'accomplishments', 'proper', 'perspective', 'watch', 'virtuoso', 'two-minute', 'performance', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'benediction', 'Kinsey', 'career', 'wane.This', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'second-best', 'mainstream', 'biographical', 'film', '2004', 'Ray', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'beat', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

886090,AK6B5SYVL6I39,B0007PALGG,"Robert Lachman ""secretpilgrim""","[4, 6]","In 1948 Alfred Kinsey (Liam Neeson), a Harvard-educated zoologist and teacher at Indiana University, wrote the first and only in-depth study of American sexual behavior ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male."" It was a huge best-seller and opened the door to the truth behind sexuality that had for so long been hidden by puritanical forces in the government and the pulpit. It also caused problems in Kinsey's own life once he published its companion piece, ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female."" He also created the famous Kinsey scale that rates sexual orientation: 0 being exclusively heterosexual and 6 being exclusively homosexual with all matter of bi-sexuality in between.The film ""Kinsey"" is a tribute to the man who single-handedly brought sexuality kicking and screaming into the 20th Century. It is also a humorous and detailed study into Kinsey's life and how he pioneered the first in-depth study of sexuality in humans.The film begins with Kinsey's formative years. The son of a domineering Methodist who decries anything that has to do remotely with sex, Kinsey found freedom in the great outdoors, studying animals and insects. As a zoologist specializing in the study of gall wasps, Kinsey is hired to teach biology at Indiana University where he marries a freethinking female student, Clara McMillen (Laura Linney, ""Mystic River,"" ""Love Actually"").""Human beings are just bigger, more complicated gall wasps,"" he says.In the course of his teaching he finds himself confronted by a newly married student couple with sexual problems. She thinks she's frigid and her husband is afraid to pleasure her orally because he read somewhere that it will make her sterile.As Kinsey discovers other students with similar problems he realizes no one has ever done the proper clinical research to answer their questions properly, so he decides to be the first to explore sex from a scientific point of view. He recruits a team of researchers from the student body and they invent an interviewing technique which helps people deal with the shame and guilt they've been taught to feel when they discuss sex.The original study is more than a hit, it's an explosion, which the press compares with the dropping of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, his follow-up study on women, written later during the Cold War, is seen as an attack on motherhood and family values, causing Kinsey to be ostracized by those who championed the first study.At the same time, his researchers begin to question his idea that sex for humans should be no different than it is for animals. No guilt, no shame, just sex. The film tells us that Kinsey not only pioneered the study of sex, but used his young researchers and their mates as sexual guinea pigs to help the studies along.There is one unsettling scene where Kinsey interviews a man who has spent ten years compiling his own survey of sexual proclivities. The man claimed to have slept with 8,412 people, members of his own family, animals and 636 pre-adolescents, yet Kinsey, preparing his third book on sex offenders, takes it all in stride, fascinated by how far people will go for sexual gratification.Peter Sarsgaard (""Shattered Glass"") plays Clyde Martin, Kinsey's chief researcher and occasional lover. He gets upset when he realizes that more trouble comes from wife-swapping than Kinsey has ever suggested.Neeson is excellent as the researcher who did so much to awaken the collective libido of America to the potential of sexual experience, yet couldn't come to grips with his own sexual impulses.Neeson is excellent as the researcher who did so much to awaken the collective libido of America to the potential of sexual experience, yet couldn't come to grips with his own sexual impulses.Laura Linney (""Love Actually,"" ""Mystic River"") is a delight as his wife Clara who stands by him through everything, even when she finds out he has had a homosexual affair with Clyde Martin.The rest of the cast is equally good, with John Lithgow solid as Kinsey's pious father and Timothy Hutton and Chris O'Donnell fine as the two other researchers, Paul Gebhard and Wardell Pomeroy.Writer/Director Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"") has fashioned a strong and thoughtful film with ""Kinsey."" He keeps the action moving with visual techniques such as Kinsey's famous sex interviews and montages to help tell the story and gets quality performances from all his actors.Richard Sherman's production design captures the look of the 1940s and `50s through clothing, old television shows, magazine covers and automobiles, while cinematographer Frederick Elmes (""Coffee and Cigarettes,"" ""Hulk"") does a brilliant job of bringing both Kinsey's childhood and the collegiate atmosphere of Indiana University, where Kinsey compiled his survey, to life.In the end, after he has fought ill health, lost his grant money and is in real trouble, he muses on his apparent inability to deal with the connections between sex and love.""It's impossible to measure love,"" he says. ""When it comes to love we're all in the dark.""""Kinsey"" is a powerful film that explores something that we are bombarded with every day, but still seem to be ignorant of ... sex. It shines the bright light of truth on the varieties of human sexual behavior that many of us are still afraid to acknowledge.[...]",4,"It's all about sex, stupid",1130630400,"10 30,

886091,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007PALGG,Robert Moore,"[22, 31]","Of all the films coming out this holiday movie season, KINSEY was near the top of my list. Despite an absolutely superb cast, I have to confess that I found this film someone disappointing. The truth is that there simply wasn't a lot of story to tell, or at least not a lot if you were already familiar with Alfred Kinsey's story. Briefly, Kinsey achieved fame as an entomologist who accidentally became the first American sex researcher. Many on the regressive side of the cultural wars focus on him as a satanic figure, but most people are going to view him as an important figure in pulling American attitudes and knowledge of sex out of the Victorian period. The film does a good job of hinting at the degree of ignorance about sex that existed in many places even in mid-century (reminding one of Virginia Woolf's comments a few decades earlier of an incident in one of E. M. Forster's novels -- Woolf expressed doubt as to whether Mr. Forster was acquainted with the facts of life, since she was uncertain whether one character became pregnant from a male character or his umbrella). It would be hard to argue that the ignorance that existed did a great deal of harm. Kinsey's achievement was to bring sex into the realm of public discussion and assess it scientifically through a massive accumulation of information acquired through face to face interviews. Historically, his main achievement was in originating the social scientific study of sex, though his work has been entirely superceded by other researchers. Most view his methodology as hopelessly flawed, for instance including a vast number of interviews with incarcerated individuals, which unquestionably skewed the overall figures in ways that didn't represent the populace as a whole. Nonetheless, Kinsey was pivotal in moving the discussion of sex from the realm of morals to that of the laboratory. Anyone wanting a very brief but excellent account of Kinsey's career can find a succint one in the relevant chapter in David Halberstam's THE FIFTIES.Alongside this story of Kinsey's study of sex is the story of the main characters own struggle with their sexuality, something that threatened the separation between his private and personal life. Kinsey ends up not only experimenting with his own sexuality, but encourages his wife and his colleagues and their wives to do so as well. This part of the film reveals the naivet&eacute; of much of their personal activity and the self-serving nature of much of their research.If anything, the film understates the turmoil Kinsey's work threw America into, though it does correctly record that while his first book on male sexuality did indeed create a sensation, it was his second book on female sexuality that created a massive reaction on the part of his critics.The problem is that most of this lacks a great deal of narrative tension and the filmmakers did not manage to transcend the material. While they do a great job of creating a period feel and bringing forth many of the big issues of the day, the outlines of the story are easy to state briefly. In other words, the Kinsey story is interesting up to a point, but only up to that point. The cast does its best, with Liam Neeson almost certain to get an Oscar nomination for the title role. Laura Linney, an immensely talented actress who has never gotten as many prominent roles as I would have liked, delivered an equally nuanced performance as Kinsey's wife. The cast was rounded out by a talented group, though one of my favorites, Oliver Platt, gets only a straightforward role that gives him no room to expand.Except for those who are easily offended by rather graphic sexual content, I can definitely recommend this film, but I do not do so with a red hot passion. It is a good, but certainly not great film on an interesting, but not quite fascinating, moment in American history.",4,Exceptional cast fleshes out a rather slim story,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,3867,"['films', 'coming', 'out', 'holiday', 'movie', 'season', 'KINSEY', 'was', 'top', 'list', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'cast', 'have', 'confess', 'found', 'film', 'someone', 'disappointing', 'truth', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'story', 'tell', 'least', 'not', 'lot', 'were', 'already', 'familiar', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'story', 'Briefly', 'Kinsey', 'achieved', 'fame', 'entomologist', 'who', 'accidentally', 'became', 'first', 'American', 'sex', 'researcher', 'Many', 'regressive', 'side', 'cultural', 'wars', 'focus', 'satanic', 'figure', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'view', 'important', 'figure', 'pulling', 'American', 'attitudes', 'knowledge', 'sex', 'Victorian', 'period', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'hinting', 'degree', 'ignorance', 'sex', 'existed', 'many', 'places', 'even', 'mid-century', 'reminding', 'one', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'comments', 'few', 'decades', 'earlier', 'incident', 'one', 'E.', 'M.', 'Forster', 'novels', 'Woolf', 'expressed', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'Forster', 'was', 'acquainted', 'facts', 'life', 'was', 'uncertain', 'one', 'character', 'became', 'pregnant', 'male', 'character', 'umbrella', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'argue', 'ignorance', 'existed', 'did', 'great', 'deal', 'harm', 'Kinsey', 'achievement', 'was', 'bring', 'sex', 'realm', 'public', 'discussion', 'assess', 'scientifically', 'massive', 'accumulation', 'information', 'acquired', 'face', 'face', 'interviews', 'Historically', 'main', 'achievement', 'was', 'originating', 'social', 'scientific', 'study', 'sex', 'work', 'been', 'entirely', 'superceded', 'other', 'researchers', 'Most', 'view', 'methodology', 'hopelessly', 'flawed', 'instance', 'including', 'vast', 'number', 'interviews', 'incarcerated', 'individuals', 'unquestionably', 'skewed', 'overall', 'figures', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'represent', 'populace', 'whole', 'Nonetheless', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'pivotal', 'moving', 'discussion', 'sex', 'realm', 'morals', 'laboratory', 'Anyone', 'wanting', 'very', 'brief', 'excellent', 'account', 'Kinsey', 'career', 'can', 'find', 'succint', 'one', 'relevant', 'chapter', 'David', 'Halberstam', 'THE', 'FIFTIES.Alongside', 'story', 'Kinsey', 'study', 'sex', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'own', 'struggle', 'sexuality', 'something', 'threatened', 'separation', 'private', 'personal', 'life', 'Kinsey', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'experimenting', 'own', 'sexuality', 'wife', 'colleagues', 'wives', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'part', 'film', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'much', 'personal', 'activity', 'self-serving', 'nature', 'much', 'research.If', 'anything', 'film', 'turmoil', 'Kinsey', 'work', 'threw', 'America', 'correctly', 'record', 'first', 'book', 'male', 'sexuality', 'did', 'indeed', 'create', 'sensation', 'was', 'second', 'book', 'female', 'sexuality', 'created', 'massive', 'reaction', 'part', 'critics.The', 'problem', 'most', 'great', 'deal', 'narrative', 'tension', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'manage', 'transcend', 'material', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'period', 'feel', 'bringing', 'forth', 'many', 'big', 'issues', 'day', 'outlines', 'story', 'are', 'easy', 'state', 'briefly', 'other', 'words', 'Kinsey', 'story', 'interesting', 'up', 'point', 'only', 'up', 'point', 'cast', 'best', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'almost', 'certain', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'title', 'role', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'immensely', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'many', 'prominent', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'delivered', 'equally', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Kinsey', 'wife', 'cast', 'was', 'rounded', 'out', 'talented', 'group', 'one', 'favorites', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'only', 'straightforward', 'role', 'room', 'expand.Except', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'rather', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'content', 'can', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'red', 'hot', 'passion', 'good', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'interesting', 'not', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'moment', 'American', 'history']",N/A

886093,A387BD735MI50R,B0007PALGG,R. Schultz,"[14, 15]","I was prepared to have my negative feelings about Kinsey confirmed in this movie. I'd heard that he took a cold accounting approach to his sex studies, that he had basically been a taxonomist/entomologist who had transferred his skills at categorizing and dissecting insects (specifically gall wasps) to tallying human behavior. But this movie introduced me to someone a lot more sympathetic, innocent, and complicated than that. It introduced me to someone never quite in on the joke.The film does inform viewers about Kinsey's working methods and the dynamics of his relationship with the graduate students he recruited to help with the burgeoning workload as he sought to interview a huge cross-section of the American population about their sexual habits and preferences. It shows how he attempted to train his associates in impassive objectivity, so as not to frighten any of their interview subjects into falsifications.I would like to have learned more about how Kinsey translated the sometimes almost stream-of-consciousness reflections he elicited from study subjects (including one particularly repulsive, absolutely unrepentant pedophile) - into the crisp numeric tallies on his sheets of paper. But perhaps such details of his study are best left to documentaries about his life.This movie wasn't meant to be a documentary. It was meant to provide some emotional insight into the man himself. The heart of the movie is his relationship with his wife, and the heart of that relationship is Laura Linney's portrayal of Clara. They had an unconventional romance from the start. One of the most touching scenes shows Kinsey celebrating Clara by giving her a clumpy pair of walking shoes. She greets these with sincere pleasure. She shines in anticipation of all the places they can tramp together, with her in such a ""sensible"" pair of shoes.The movie proceeds to take us through some of the ups and downs of their open marriage. Kinsey is a pioneer in equality, wondering why his wife isn't getting as much pleasure out of their sexual relationship as he is - a question few husbands in that era would even think to ask. He sets out to investigate the process of pleasure scientifically and to set things right. As their marriage matures, Kinsey has his affairs - with both men and women. Then when Clara decides she might like to try an outside adventure on her own - the play of subtle emotions on the actors' faces tells a story in itself.Those shoes come to represent their relationship throughout their lives - through their accommodations with each other, through their estrangements, through their essential affection for each other. In the end, as in the beginning, they enjoy their explorations together, in sensible shoes.This movie will take you in unexpected directions.",4,A Surprising Love Story,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,2791,"['was', 'prepared', 'have', 'negative', 'feelings', 'Kinsey', 'confirmed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'heard', 'took', 'cold', 'accounting', 'approach', 'sex', 'studies', 'had', 'basically', 'been', 'taxonomist/entomologist', 'who', 'had', 'transferred', 'skills', 'categorizing', 'dissecting', 'insects', 'specifically', 'gall', 'wasps', 'tallying', 'human', 'behavior', 'movie', 'introduced', 'someone', 'lot', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'innocent', 'complicated', 'introduced', 'someone', 'never', 'quite', 'joke.The', 'film', 'inform', 'viewers', 'Kinsey', 'working', 'methods', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'graduate', 'students', 'recruited', 'help', 'burgeoning', 'workload', 'sought', 'interview', 'huge', 'cross-section', 'American', 'population', 'sexual', 'habits', 'preferences', 'how', 'attempted', 'train', 'associates', 'impassive', 'objectivity', 'so', 'not', 'frighten', 'interview', 'falsifications.I', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'how', 'Kinsey', 'translated', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'reflections', 'elicited', 'study', 'subjects', 'including', 'one', 'particularly', 'repulsive', 'absolutely', 'unrepentant', 'pedophile', 'crisp', 'numeric', 'tallies', 'sheets', 'paper', 'perhaps', 'such', 'details', 'study', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'documentaries', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'documentary', 'was', 'meant', 'provide', 'emotional', 'insight', 'man', 'heart', 'movie', 'relationship', 'wife', 'heart', 'relationship', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'portrayal', 'Clara', 'had', 'unconventional', 'romance', 'start', 'One', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Kinsey', 'celebrating', 'Clara', 'giving', 'clumpy', 'pair', 'walking', 'shoes', 'sincere', 'pleasure', 'anticipation', 'places', 'can', 'tramp', 'together', 'such', 'sensible', 'pair', 'shoes.The', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'take', 'ups', 'downs', 'open', 'marriage', 'Kinsey', 'pioneer', 'equality', 'wondering', 'why', 'wife', ""n't"", 'getting', 'as', 'much', 'pleasure', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'question', 'few', 'husbands', 'era', 'would', 'even', 'think', 'ask', 'out', 'investigate', 'process', 'pleasure', 'scientifically', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'marriage', 'matures', 'Kinsey', 'affairs', 'men', 'women', 'Then', 'when', 'Clara', 'might', 'like', 'try', 'outside', 'adventure', 'own', 'play', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'actors', 'tells', 'story', 'itself.Those', 'shoes', 'come', 'represent', 'relationship', 'lives', 'accommodations', 'other', 'estrangements', 'essential', 'affection', 'other', 'end', 'beginning', 'enjoy', 'explorations', 'together', 'sensible', 'shoes.This', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'unexpected', 'directions']",N/A
886094,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0007PALGG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[7, 8]","Recent years have seen a stellar crop of biopics coming out of Hollywood.  From ""Ray"" to ""Walk the Line"" to ""Capote"" (just to name a few), we have been treated to great actors and writers telling the stories of fascinating people.  ""Kinsey"" does not quite rise to that level, but is a solid movie in its own right and features two stellar performances in Liam Neeson and Laura Linney.Neeson, one of my favorite actors, plays against type as the titular Alfred Kinsey.  It is odd to see Neeson play, without putting too fine a point on it, a complete and utter nerd.  Neeson has conveyed intelligence before, but it was always a dashing intelligence.  Here, Neeson plays the rooster-haired taxonomist with a single-minded zeal for scientific discovery but only rare outbursts of genuine human emotion.  Kinsey is as close as a human being has come to our favorite Vulcan, Mr. Spock - even his ears are kinda pointy.Kinsey meets his soulmate in his student, Clara ""Mac"" McMillen, who Linney plays with infinite patience, a lot of intelligence, but with quite a bit more emotion than her husband.  Perhaps the only bad choice Linney made in the entire movie is to wear colored contact lenses that made her eyes almost completely black, masking her baby blues.  Other than that, Linney is flawless.The movie goes to great lengths to show how important Kinsey was to American culture.  The movie's thesis - and it seems to be largely correct - is that America's sexual education came not from self-styled promoters like Hugh Hefner, but from the academic Kinsey and the University of Indiana.  Shocked that his university students are sexual illiterate, Kinsey convinces a reluctant university president, played by Oliver Platt, to allow Kinsey to teach a ""sex course.""  From this foundation, Kinsey develops a little faculty of his own and goes on to publish two landmark books about sex and the American male and female.  Initially hailed as a hero after the publishing of his book on men, Kinsey is ostracized after publishing his book on women and is dubbed a corrupter of America's youth by the prudes who dominate American culture.So, why the three-star review?  Maybe I've just seen too many movies, but the scenes that deal with the depths of America's sexual puritanism seem to have been done before.  Attacking American sexual mores, circa 1950, is like shooting fish in a barrel - it's just too easy.  We've heard a thousand times the stupid theories of the day, from high heels causing sterility to pregancy being caused by heavy petting.  The pioneers of sexual freedom are always shown to be reasonable, and the opponents are always the ridiculous prudes and their unfortunate victims.It was perhaps inspired casting to put John Lithgow in the role of Kinsey's hyper-repressed-and-restrictive father.  It was Lithgow, after all, who played the hyper-restrictive father in ""Footloose.""  While we eventually see old Dad as a sympathetic character, ""Kinsey"" also breaks down the characters into prudes=bad, Kinseyans=good.There is a bit of a struggle toward the end of the movie about the consequences of sexual liberation as Kinsey's staff -- who engage in more than a bit of ""free love"" -- get a little miffed at each other.  But in general, the movie's dichotomy remains its trademark.This isn't to say that ""Kinsey"" is a bad film, and that it's perspective is not valid.  It's just that this theme is something that I, as a teenager in the 1980's, have heard countless times before.The movie also squanders a couple of prime opportunities.  Oliver Platt is given remarkably little to do as the university president, and Tim Curry even less as a university ""hygiene professor"" whose lectures on sexual conduct border on the criminal.  These two outrageous actors could have been used to astounding effect in a movie about sexual repression and freedom, and yet may as well not have been used at all other than to build up and dash our hopes.As far as it goes, ""Kinsey"" is a solid, well-made movie.  But, aside from some pitch-perfect acting by Neeson and Linney, there is nothing about ""Kinsey"" that separates it from the conventional biopic.",3,Liam Neeson and Laura Linney shine in pedestrian tale of America's prudery,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,4151,"['Recent', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'stellar', 'crop', 'biopics', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'Ray', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Capote', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'great', 'actors', 'writers', 'telling', 'stories', 'fascinating', 'people', 'Kinsey', 'not', 'quite', 'rise', 'level', 'solid', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'features', 'two', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Laura', 'Linney.Neeson', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'plays', 'type', 'titular', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'odd', 'see', 'Neeson', 'play', 'putting', 'too', 'fine', 'point', 'complete', 'utter', 'nerd', 'Neeson', 'conveyed', 'intelligence', 'was', 'always', 'dashing', 'intelligence', 'Here', 'Neeson', 'rooster-haired', 'taxonomist', 'single-minded', 'zeal', 'scientific', 'discovery', 'only', 'rare', 'outbursts', 'genuine', 'human', 'emotion', 'Kinsey', 'as', 'close', 'human', 'being', 'come', 'favorite', 'Vulcan', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'even', 'ears', 'are', 'kinda', 'pointy.Kinsey', 'meets', 'soulmate', 'student', 'Clara', 'Mac', 'McMillen', 'who', 'Linney', 'infinite', 'patience', 'lot', 'intelligence', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'emotion', 'husband', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'bad', 'choice', 'Linney', 'made', 'entire', 'movie', 'wear', 'colored', 'contact', 'made', 'eyes', 'almost', 'completely', 'black', 'masking', 'baby', 'blues', 'Other', 'Linney', 'flawless.The', 'movie', 'great', 'lengths', 'show', 'how', 'important', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'American', 'culture', 'movie', 'thesis', 'be', 'largely', 'correct', 'America', 'sexual', 'education', 'came', 'not', 'self-styled', 'promoters', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'academic', 'Kinsey', 'University', 'Indiana', 'Shocked', 'university', 'students', 'are', 'sexual', 'illiterate', 'Kinsey', 'reluctant', 'university', 'president', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'allow', 'Kinsey', 'teach', 'sex', 'course', 'foundation', 'Kinsey', 'little', 'faculty', 'own', 'publish', 'two', 'landmark', 'books', 'sex', 'American', 'male', 'female', 'Initially', 'hailed', 'hero', 'publishing', 'book', 'men', 'Kinsey', 'ostracized', 'publishing', 'book', 'women', 'dubbed', 'corrupter', 'America', 'youth', 'prudes', 'who', 'dominate', 'American', 'culture.So', 'why', 'three-star', 'review', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'scenes', 'deal', 'depths', 'America', 'sexual', 'puritanism', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Attacking', 'American', 'sexual', 'mores', 'circa', '1950', 'shooting', 'fish', 'barrel', 'just', 'too', 'easy', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'thousand', 'stupid', 'theories', 'day', 'high', 'heels', 'causing', 'sterility', 'pregancy', 'being', 'caused', 'heavy', 'petting', 'pioneers', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'are', 'always', 'shown', 'be', 'reasonable', 'opponents', 'are', 'always', 'ridiculous', 'prudes', 'unfortunate', 'victims.It', 'was', 'perhaps', 'inspired', 'casting', 'put', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'role', 'Kinsey', 'hyper-repressed-and-restrictive', 'father', 'was', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'played', 'hyper-restrictive', 'father', 'Footloose', 'eventually', 'see', 'old', 'Dad', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Kinsey', 'also', 'down', 'characters', 'prudes=bad', 'Kinseyans=good.There', 'bit', 'struggle', 'end', 'movie', 'consequences', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'Kinsey', 'staff', 'who', 'engage', 'more', 'bit', 'free', 'love', 'get', 'little', 'miffed', 'other', 'general', 'movie', 'dichotomy', 'trademark.This', ""n't"", 'say', 'Kinsey', 'bad', 'film', 'perspective', 'not', 'valid', 'just', 'theme', 'something', 'teenager', '1980', 'have', 'heard', 'countless', 'times', 'before.The', 'movie', 'also', 'couple', 'prime', 'opportunities', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'given', 'remarkably', 'little', 'do', 'university', 'president', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'even', 'less', 'university', 'hygiene', 'professor', 'lectures', 'sexual', 'conduct', 'border', 'criminal', 'two', 'outrageous', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'astounding', 'effect', 'movie', 'sexual', 'repression', 'freedom', 'yet', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'other', 'build', 'up', 'dash', 'hopes.As', 'far', 'Kinsey', 'solid', 'well-made', 'movie', 'aside', 'pitch-perfect', 'acting', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'nothing', 'Kinsey', 'conventional', 'biopic']",N/A

Was I ever wrong!  The dialogue in the movie was crisp and unexpectedly funny and the acting was stellar. (What else could be expected from Liam Neeson, Chris O'Donnel and Laura Linney?)The movie traced the puritanical and oppressive upbringing that poor Kinsey endured as a boy who was born in 1894 and raised by a fire and brimstone, preacher father.  Those were the days when no one talked about [...] and it was widely thought to cause blindness or insanity; oral sex was feared in the event that it resulted in infertility; and no one knew a [..] from a clavicle!Kinsey was one of the first to break down those barriers in the 1920s and 1930s.  He started classes at university for young couples who were about to get married in order to give them proper sex education, rather than the abstinence message that they had been receiving in their hygiene class.He interviewed 18,000 people and wrote books about his findings, for which he was widely criticized because what he found was that there was a large disconnect between what people said was ""moral"" sexual behavior, and what they actually practiced behind closed doors.  Moreover, he stated that ""37 percent of U.S. men (and 13 percent of women) had had at least one homosexual experience, while 62 percent of women (and 92 percent of men) masturbated. Premarital sex was common. Half of marriedmen and a quarter of married women had cheated on their spouses."" [Source -- National Geographic News]In addition, Kinsey concluded that the majority of people were bisexual.  This was during an era when adultery, homosexuality and oral sex were illegal in many states!Kinsey had two great failings: firstly, as a zoologist, he could never understand that the human mammal with different from other animals.  Humans had feelings that were intricately tied to their sexuality.Animals did not.  Secondly, Kinsey's research methodology was questioned by many sources as being skewed and lacking objectivity.  He interviewed most of his people face-to-face and then transcribed his findings.  At least one quarter of his subjects were prison inmates, 5% were male prostitutes and they were all volunteers.  A good research design should have a randomized study, preferably double blind so that the researcher and his assistants did not directly interpret data from subjects in order to avoid potential bias on their parts.The movie clearly discussed Kinsey's first failing but was not explicit enough about the second one regarding research methodology.Having said that, Alfred Kinsey was an amazing man and this is an awesome movie.

Best ""Avid Reader""","[3, 4]","The story of Alfred Kinsey and his reports on human sexuality is difficult to comprehend, but director Bill Condon does a great job trying to explain it all.  While leaving a few questions unanswered, it is for the most part an excellent film with an excellent cast.The film portrays Kinsey as an authority on sex, but there is no indication on HOW he became an expert.  Suddenly he is giving sexual advice to students and the audience is left to ask how this occurred.  And closely related to this enigma is why did people believe his background in biology qualified him for the psychological aspects of sexual relations?  The film on occasion broaches this subject by a character asking of his qualifications, and we are led to believe that his knowledge of biology suffices...which is patently nonsensical.  While sex is a biologic function, it also is a deeply-rooted emotional one; and gathering data to prove WHAT people do in bed doesn't help explain WHY people do the things they do in bed.The film, however, brilliantly explores the fact that society became conditioned to believe that sex for any purpose other than reproduction was prurient.  Kinsey proved the hypocrisy of American society by showing that a great percentage of Americans...both male and female...were doing all of the things society wasn't supposed to discuss.Conversely, the film shows the inherent problem of relegating sex exclusively to its biology and ignoring the psychology of it by portraying Kinsey's researchers as being immune to the privacy of sex.  They boorishly discuss sexual acts in public and (even more boorishly), discuss with others the intimate details of their own sex lives, often with their wives present.The film (being a product of the 21st century) portrays those who disagreed with Kinsey as puritanical prudes.

He becomes a brilliant, if nerdy professor, and his future wife Clara (one of his students) has to practically throw herself at him to get his attention. Once they marry, she gives up her studies to raise four children (one died, but this isn't shown), and stand by her man.  Kinsey become interested in sex research due to problems encountered by young married students, and the silly myths that they hear, believe and contintue to propagate.He hires some students to begin the surveys.

Kinsey has an affair with one of his helpful researchers, but since the actors portraying Wardell and Clyde were so similar, I couldn't tell them apart.  His wife later has an affair with the same man.  In the movie that's that, but in real life, they had an open marriage.The film insults the movie-goer's intelligence toward the end, when Kinsey interviews his strait-laced, critical father after his mother's funeral. In reality, his moralistic father divorced his mother in 1930, and Kinsey never spoke to him after that.Kinsey (as shown in the movie) seems a bit confused by his  sexual research - on the one hand he wants to keep it clinical, purely physical, on the other, he comes to the realization that all this playing around can end up getting someone hurt.

In this case, the controversy is between those who identify most closely with the late sexual revolution and those in the camp of the ongoing counter sexual revolution. As this film has a highly sympathetic take on Kinsey's story, those counter revolutionaries are best advised to avoid it, unless they wish to use it to work themselves into righteous outrages. Those like me, whose sympathies lie with the spirit of the sexual revolution will find not outrage, but a fine film.The film deftly weaves together Kinsey's personal and professional lives, showing one as the natural extension of the other. Much of his motivation is explained through two important family relationships - his rejection of his father, portrayed here by John Lithgow as an insufferably puritanical prig, and his extraordinary, unorthodox marriage partnership with a remarkable, free thinking woman, a role played superbly by Laura Linney (who deserved to win the best actress Oscar for which she was nominated). Liam Neeson played Kinsey as obsessively focused and driven, often domineering, and nearly evangelical in his quest to liberate sexuality from the darkness of Puritanism and prudishness into the light of pure science. It is through his relationships with his family that he emerges as such a sympathetic character. Even his research assistants are shown as becoming a sort of extended family to him, continuing that theme.The film does not present Kinsey as a faultless hero. He is portrayed as sometimes so obsessed with his quest as to become myopic; unable to foresee how his research would release certain raging wild fires into a society long accustomed to the restrains of Puritan social mores. It even touches on the possibility of irregularities within his research, but here it is shown as a small problem easily overcome rather than the overwhelming fault that would discredit the entirety of the man and his research as his detractors like to imagine. But these faults humanize rather than destroy the legend of a man who dedicated his life to bringing rationality to human sexuality.Scattered throughout the film are several devices used to tell the story, including flashbacks and black and white footage of practice interviews Kinsey conducted with his researchers, but despite this, the film still flows along nicely. In addition to the outstanding leads of Neeson and Linney, the supporting roles are strong, including a notable performance from Peter Sarsgaard as Kinsey's principle research assistant. It is a good tale, and a fine film, and has my recommendation.Theo Logos",5,Puritan Buster,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2805,"['Kinsey', 'film', 'story', 'sex', 'researcher', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'will', 'like', 'most', 'films', 'controversial', 'characters', 'recent', 'history', 'affect', 'viewers', 'largely', 'according', 'how', 'come', 'down', 'controversy', 'case', 'controversy', 'who', 'identify', 'most', 'closely', 'late', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'camp', 'ongoing', 'counter', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'film', 'highly', 'sympathetic', 'take', 'Kinsey', 'story', 'counter', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'best', 'advised', 'avoid', 'wish', 'use', 'work', 'righteous', 'outrages', 'sympathies', 'lie', 'spirit', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'will', 'find', 'not', 'outrage', 'fine', 'film.The', 'film', 'deftly', 'together', 'Kinsey', 'personal', 'professional', 'lives', 'showing', 'one', 'natural', 'extension', 'other', 'Much', 'motivation', 'explained', 'two', 'important', 'family', 'relationships', 'rejection', 'father', 'portrayed', 'here', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'insufferably', 'puritanical', 'prig', 'extraordinary', 'unorthodox', 'marriage', 'partnership', 'remarkable', 'free', 'thinking', 'woman', 'role', 'played', 'superbly', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'deserved', 'win', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'was', 'nominated', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'played', 'Kinsey', 'obsessively', 'focused', 'driven', 'often', 'domineering', 'nearly', 'evangelical', 'quest', 'liberate', 'sexuality', 'darkness', 'Puritanism', 'prudishness', 'light', 'pure', 'science', 'relationships', 'family', 'such', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Even', 'research', 'assistants', 'are', 'shown', 'becoming', 'sort', 'extended', 'family', 'continuing', 'theme.The', 'film', 'not', 'present', 'Kinsey', 'faultless', 'hero', 'portrayed', 'sometimes', 'so', 'obsessed', 'quest', 'become', 'myopic', 'unable', 'foresee', 'how', 'research', 'would', 'release', 'certain', 'raging', 'wild', 'fires', 'society', 'long', 'accustomed', 'restrains', 'Puritan', 'social', 'mores', 'even', 'possibility', 'irregularities', 'research', 'here', 'shown', 'small', 'problem', 'easily', 'rather', 'overwhelming', 'fault', 'would', 'discredit', 'entirety', 'man', 'research', 'detractors', 'imagine', 'faults', 'humanize', 'rather', 'destroy', 'legend', 'man', 'who', 'dedicated', 'life', 'bringing', 'rationality', 'human', 'sexuality.Scattered', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'devices', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'including', 'flashbacks', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'practice', 'interviews', 'Kinsey', 'conducted', 'researchers', 'film', 'still', 'nicely', 'addition', 'outstanding', 'leads', 'Neeson', 'Linney', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'strong', 'including', 'notable', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Kinsey', 'principle', 'research', 'assistant', 'good', 'tale', 'fine', 'film', 'recommendation.Theo', 'Logos']",N/A
886104,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0007PALGG,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 2]","Giving a bravura performance as Dr Alfred Kinsey, Liam Neeson elevates ""Kinsey"" beyond the rather dry source material. In real life, Dr Kinsey was an analyst who researched his subjects with a disconnect that helped him separate statistics from the mores of the days. Intellectually, this was nothing short of groundbreaking, but otherwise, it's like reading a college textbook.With a script that picks up speed as it progresses, Director/Writer Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) takes the analytical Kinsey and surrounds him with all the things he isn't. The two best roles belong to the the seducing Peter Sarsgaard as Clyde Martin, a bisexual who seduces both Dr Kinsey and his wife, but then himself destroyed when he finds his wife is cheating on him. Mrs Kinsey is played as a loyal if somewhat flustered wife by Laura Linney, who shades her performance with the struggle of emotionally understanding and loving a man that can barely do either.In other, smaller roles, the cast is exemplary. Tim Curry plays a prudish academic who is jealous of Dr Kinsey's breakthrough. Oliver Pratt does a good job as the President of Indiana University, delighted that Kinsey's book (Sexual Behavior in the Human Male) is helping to fill the university's coffers but nervous about the controversy. William Sadler appears as a insatiable sex-addict who breaks Kinsey's reserve about judging his subject. And finally, there is a final film stealing cameo from Lynn Redgrave, who brings the full import of what Kinsey accomplished into focus, while giving Dr Kinsey a lesson in the humanities.The combination of characters and direction makes ""Kinsey"" both informative and entertaining. As you watch the young Albert Kinsey trying to break away from a repressive religious upbringing (from under a stern and emotionally brutalizing John Lithgow), you can see how he grew up both rebellious and dispassionate.

886106,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007PALGG,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 9]","The director of critically acclaimed 'Gods and Monsters' Bill Condon made another bio-pic about a historical figure whose name everyone knows through his `reports,' but few people actually know about himself.  Well, the personality Alfred Kinsey is, according to the film, very unique.The film is about the life of Alfred Kinsey, entomologist of Indiana University before he was known for what he became later.  After studying and collecting thousands of bees (yes, thousands and more), he volunteers to give a lecture about marriage, or sex if you like, for the students in 1938.  The course was a popular one, which led him to another study on the behavior of humans - 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Male' published in 1948.But the film is not about his study, but his unbelievable personality, and very complicated relations between the people surrounding him, especially his wife Clara.  If the film is true (and I believe Bill Condon must have done a through research), Alfred Kinsey led a life (this case, sexually) that even the hippies in the 60s free love movement would not dare to follow.  And Kinsey died in 1956.However, you may not believe me, but for all its subject matter, 'Kinsey' is not as controversial or shocking as it looks.  That's partly because some descriptions of the film are clearly subdued (or some say whitewashed), but the main reason for the film's well-balanced look on him is that the film never glorifies Kinsey as a man.  'Kinsey' doesn't refuse to show the negative side of his character, or at least it shows quite blatantly his eccentric personality, which often makes you smile, but is sometimes very off-putting even today.  While the film implies Alfred as a boy is tormented by his religious father and his creed, Alfred ironically himself turns out the presence like his father before his own children, with his too much zeal for study.  In one sense, it looks as if Kinsey got his fame as the pioneer because he is hopelessly nave.Another merit of the film is unanimously good acting.  Liam Neeson plays an American scholar convincingly, and Laura Linney is also very good as his wife Clara.  There are many supports from Chris O'Donnell, Peter Sarsgaard, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Tim Curry, Oliver Platt, Dylan Baker, and Lynn Redgrave.  Some actors are effectively cast against type, and if you remember his role as child molester in `Happiness,' you know Dylan Baker as Dr. Allan Gregg who worries about the `shocking' and `immoral' nature of Kinsey's book is intentionally cast.I like the film's re-creation of the period before WW2, but in the latter half of the film 'Kinsey' stops showing the feeling of the contemporary period, and starts to concentrate on depicting the struggles of the Kinseys and his researchers themselves.  It's strange, but you scarcely hear the news of wars, hot or cold.  The film treats the battles between the opposing forces and Kinsey out of the historical context, and that attitude undermines the power that the film might have had.  Though the conflict between the people over freedom and moral is an on-going matter, what happened about 50 years ago cannot be the same as the one in modern times, in which people can talk about sex more freely.  Showing the feeling of the time is not just about old cars and costumes; it's about putting the subject matter in the right context.But all in all I think 'Kinsey' is a good film, and you can call it a good comedy at times.  Don't miss its occasional humor thrown in, like the pun about `horses' and something else.  'Kinsey' is a well-made drama about the interesting characters with unique personalities.",4,"Well-Made Bio-Pic about Alfred Kinsey, Whose Life is as Interesting as His Reports",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,3644,"['director', 'critically', 'acclaimed', ""'Gods"", 'Monsters', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'made', 'bio-pic', 'historical', 'figure', 'name', 'everyone', 'reports', 'few', 'people', 'actually', 'know', 'Well', 'personality', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'according', 'film', 'very', 'unique.The', 'film', 'life', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'entomologist', 'Indiana', 'University', 'was', 'known', 'what', 'became', 'later', 'studying', 'collecting', 'thousands', 'bees', 'yes', 'thousands', 'more', 'give', 'lecture', 'marriage', 'sex', 'like', 'students', '1938', 'course', 'was', 'popular', 'one', 'led', 'study', 'behavior', 'humans', ""'Sexual"", 'Behavior', 'Human', 'Male', 'published', '1948.But', 'film', 'not', 'study', 'unbelievable', 'personality', 'very', 'complicated', 'relations', 'people', 'surrounding', 'especially', 'wife', 'Clara', 'film', 'true', 'believe', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'led', 'life', 'case', 'sexually', 'even', 'hippies', '60s', 'free', 'love', 'movement', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'follow', 'Kinsey', 'died', '1956.However', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'controversial', 'shocking', 'partly', 'descriptions', 'film', 'are', 'clearly', 'subdued', 'say', 'whitewashed', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'well-balanced', 'look', 'film', 'never', 'Kinsey', 'man', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'show', 'negative', 'side', 'character', 'least', 'quite', 'blatantly', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'often', 'smile', 'sometimes', 'very', 'off-putting', 'even', 'today', 'film', 'implies', 'Alfred', 'boy', 'tormented', 'religious', 'father', 'creed', 'Alfred', 'ironically', 'out', 'presence', 'father', 'own', 'children', 'too', 'much', 'zeal', 'study', 'one', 'sense', 'Kinsey', 'got', 'fame', 'pioneer', 'hopelessly', 'nave.Another', 'merit', 'film', 'unanimously', 'good', 'acting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'American', 'scholar', 'convincingly', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'wife', 'Clara', 'are', 'many', 'supports', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'actors', 'are', 'effectively', 'cast', 'type', 'remember', 'role', 'child', 'molester', 'Happiness', 'know', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Dr.', 'Allan', 'Gregg', 'who', 'shocking', 'immoral', 'nature', 'Kinsey', 'book', 'intentionally', 'cast.I', 'film', 're-creation', 'period', 'WW2', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'stops', 'showing', 'feeling', 'contemporary', 'period', 'concentrate', 'depicting', 'struggles', 'Kinseys', 'researchers', 'strange', 'scarcely', 'hear', 'news', 'wars', 'hot', 'cold', 'film', 'battles', 'opposing', 'forces', 'Kinsey', 'historical', 'context', 'attitude', 'power', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'conflict', 'people', 'freedom', 'moral', 'on-going', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'one', 'modern', 'times', 'people', 'can', 'talk', 'sex', 'more', 'freely', 'Showing', 'feeling', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'old', 'cars', 'costumes', 'putting', 'subject', 'matter', 'right', 'context.But', 'think', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'call', 'good', 'comedy', 'times', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'occasional', 'humor', 'thrown', 'pun', 'horses', 'something', 'else', 'well-made', 'drama', 'interesting', 'characters', 'unique', 'personalities']",N/A

Seeing it for the first time, in a theatre, with a full-size large audience who was laughing, applauding and generally enjoying this relatively frank film about sex, was a testament to the work of Alfred Kinsey; to make the general public aware about sexuality, and be able to discuss it honestly and unashamed.This is one hell of a film. Liam Neeson and Laura Linney are stellar as Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey...the greatest performances I've seen from either of these wonderful actors. Peter Sarsgaard is also a revelation as Kinsey's primo assistant. His delivery with these two other actors is flawless. What a shame that none of these actors were awarded an Oscar for their roles in this stellar film.The film weaves Kinsey's background back and forth through his personal life, his struggles, and his studies. It shows us that despite his devotion to work, he was also human and capable of the same frustrations that many of his subjects encountered. The film dares to take a (still) sensitive subject for many, and place it in their laps...showing that there really isn't anything more frightening or alarming then allowing oneself to remain in the dark.The SE DVD of this film, comes with a very nice anamorphic transfer of the film, as well as a wealth of bonus extras. The most enjoyable of these are 20 scenes/segments which were edited from the final print. The most interesting of these are the clips with Chris O'Donnell, which suggest he had a slightly more substantial role in the film, but much of it was needed to be cut for pacing. Unlike many ""deleted scenes"" some DVDs claim, these are actually valuable to the film as a whole, and worth watching. It's fascinating to see how some of these clips add to the story and/or alter what is actually in the finished film.Also included is a visual tour of the Kinsey archives, a really humorous ""gag reel"", and an optional director commentary on the soundtrack throughout the film. A wonderful film, that is worth owning on DVD. It's one of the few films in recent years that I actually care to own and review.",5,Enlightening Filmmaking,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2153,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'movie', 'theatre', 'Seeing', 'first', 'time', 'theatre', 'full-size', 'large', 'audience', 'who', 'was', 'laughing', 'applauding', 'generally', 'enjoying', 'relatively', 'frank', 'film', 'sex', 'was', 'testament', 'work', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'make', 'general', 'public', 'aware', 'sexuality', 'be', 'able', 'discuss', 'honestly', 'unashamed.This', 'one', 'hell', 'film', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'stellar', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Kinsey', 'greatest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'also', 'revelation', 'Kinsey', 'primo', 'assistant', 'delivery', 'two', 'other', 'actors', 'flawless', 'What', 'shame', 'none', 'actors', 'were', 'awarded', 'Oscar', 'roles', 'stellar', 'film.The', 'film', 'Kinsey', 'background', 'back', 'forth', 'personal', 'life', 'struggles', 'studies', 'devotion', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'human', 'capable', 'same', 'frustrations', 'many', 'subjects', 'encountered', 'film', 'take', 'still', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'many', 'place', 'laps', 'showing', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'frightening', 'alarming', 'then', 'allowing', 'remain', 'dark.The', 'SE', 'DVD', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'wealth', 'bonus', 'extras', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'are', '20', 'scenes/segments', 'were', 'edited', 'final', 'print', 'most', 'interesting', 'are', 'clips', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'suggest', 'had', 'slightly', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'film', 'much', 'was', 'needed', 'be', 'cut', 'pacing', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVDs', 'claim', 'are', 'actually', 'valuable', 'film', 'whole', 'worth', 'watching', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'clips', 'add', 'story', 'and/or', 'alter', 'what', 'actually', 'finished', 'film.Also', 'included', 'visual', 'tour', 'Kinsey', 'archives', 'really', 'humorous', 'gag', 'reel', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'wonderful', 'film', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'actually', 'care', 'own', 'review']",N/A

I agree with reviewers who say that the director had tricky material to cover and tried to do so in a way that wouldn't offend too many different groups of people. I'd recommend people read The Inner Circle by TC Boyle. It's also about Kinsey, but Boyle clearly enjoys the kinkier side of Kinsey's character. He makes the group around Kinsey to all be very sexually active and experimental, while trying to maintain an outward appearance of respectability. This strikes me as more to the truth. If you're talking sex, sex, sex all day with multiple people it's going to possess greater portions of your energy than this film suggests. Also, Boyle's book makes clearer some of the controversal aspects of Kinsey's research. For example, he interviewed people he knew where active pedophiles. He knew that these people would walk out of the interview and go on to molest children, and yet he didn't turn them in. He argued that he couldn't turn them in because that would ruin the research. Knowing the information was more important than protecting the victims. I understand what he means, and to me this is an issue that should've been dealt with more in the movie. It's complicated and unseemly. I guess I wish that this film had likewise been more complicated and unseemly. It provides an important introduction to social/historical realities around Kinsey and our attitudes toward sex, but it doesn't go beyond that to make this the difficult, thoughtful and challenging movie it might have been.",4,"Good, but not as challenging as it might have been",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,1632,"['might', 'be', 'just', 'four', 'stars', 'certainly', 'decent', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'not', 'tremendous', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'director', 'had', 'tricky', 'material', 'cover', 'tried', 'do', 'so', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'offend', 'too', 'many', 'different', 'groups', 'people', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'people', 'read', 'Inner', 'Circle', 'TC', 'Boyle', 'also', 'about', 'Kinsey', 'Boyle', 'clearly', 'kinkier', 'side', 'Kinsey', 'character', 'group', 'around', 'Kinsey', 'be', 'very', 'sexually', 'active', 'experimental', 'trying', 'maintain', 'outward', 'appearance', 'respectability', 'more', 'truth', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'day', 'multiple', 'people', 'going', 'possess', 'greater', 'portions', 'energy', 'film', 'Also', 'Boyle', 'book', 'clearer', 'controversal', 'aspects', 'Kinsey', 'research', 'example', 'interviewed', 'people', 'knew', 'where', 'active', 'pedophiles', 'knew', 'people', 'would', 'walk', 'interview', 'go', 'molest', 'children', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'argued', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'would', 'ruin', 'research', 'Knowing', 'information', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'protecting', 'victims', 'understand', 'what', 'issue', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'more', 'movie', 'complicated', 'unseemly', 'guess', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'likewise', 'been', 'more', 'complicated', 'unseemly', 'important', 'introduction', 'social/historical', 'realities', 'Kinsey', 'attitudes', 'sex', ""n't"", 'go', 'make', 'difficult', 'thoughtful', 'challenging', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

886112,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0007PALGG,William Hare,"[5, 9]","Bill Condon is to be commended as a filmmaker willing to tackle controversy in the pursuit of truth.  ""Kinsey"" was one of the top films of 2004.  It entertained while at the same time filling in important details about the life of a man who opened America's and ultimately the world's eyes concerning what sex was really all about, shattering long held myths in the process.Liam Neeson plays the role of Kinsey with spirited conviction.  His Kinsey is a man constantly pursuing knowledge, unafraid to venture where the frightened followers of tradition feared to tread.  Early in his career as a biology professor Kinsey recognizes how many traits the creatures he microscopically analyzes resemble the conduct of humans.  The problem was that people so frequently tended to shy away from their actual feelings for fear of being ostracized.  A rigid and destructive conformity rooted in guilt prevailed.  So many acts practices considered now considered normal by enlightened psychiatric opinion were denounced as verboten, aberrant, and ultimately depraved.One of the most fascinating segments of this thought provoking film relates to the rocky relationship of truth seeking Neeson and his father, a hellfire and brimstone Christian preacher played by John Lithgow.  The haughty and chauvinistic Lithgow loves putting down both his son and his wife.  He achieves a badly needed humility after Kinsey asks him probing questions about his own sexuality, as a result of which he faces basic truths concerning himself for the first time.Neeson's pursuit of sexual freedom through liberating truth is enhanced by his successful marriage to a bright and inquisitive spouse.  Laura Linney becomes attracted to Neeson while a student of his at Indiana University.  She is able to penetrate his initial stuffiness and help to make him a better-rounded individual.  Linney assists him in his personal sexual explorations as they use their own marriage as a laboratory to learn about their own erogenous zones and how to maximize sexual pleasure.A touching element of the film occurs when a tormented lesbian woman thanks Neeson for saving her life.  She had believed prevailing psychiatric dogma about her own feelings and was considering suicide.  Kinsey's enlightened teachings made her feel like a human being and enabled her to overcome sexual guilt feelings that had previously paralyzed her.",5,A Daring Film on a Daring Man of Genius,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2389,"['Bill', 'Condon', 'be', 'commended', 'filmmaker', 'willing', 'tackle', 'controversy', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'Kinsey', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'films', '2004', 'entertained', 'same', 'time', 'filling', 'important', 'details', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'opened', 'America', 'ultimately', 'world', 'eyes', 'concerning', 'what', 'sex', 'was', 'really', 'shattering', 'long', 'held', 'myths', 'process.Liam', 'Neeson', 'role', 'Kinsey', 'spirited', 'conviction', 'Kinsey', 'man', 'constantly', 'pursuing', 'knowledge', 'unafraid', 'venture', 'where', 'frightened', 'followers', 'tradition', 'feared', 'tread', 'Early', 'career', 'biology', 'professor', 'Kinsey', 'how', 'many', 'creatures', 'microscopically', 'resemble', 'conduct', 'humans', 'problem', 'was', 'people', 'so', 'frequently', 'tended', 'shy', 'away', 'actual', 'feelings', 'fear', 'being', 'ostracized', 'rigid', 'destructive', 'conformity', 'rooted', 'guilt', 'prevailed', 'So', 'many', 'acts', 'practices', 'considered', 'now', 'considered', 'normal', 'enlightened', 'psychiatric', 'opinion', 'were', 'denounced', 'verboten', 'aberrant', 'ultimately', 'depraved.One', 'most', 'fascinating', 'segments', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'relates', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'truth', 'seeking', 'Neeson', 'father', 'hellfire', 'brimstone', 'Christian', 'preacher', 'played', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'haughty', 'chauvinistic', 'Lithgow', 'putting', 'down', 'son', 'wife', 'badly', 'needed', 'humility', 'Kinsey', 'probing', 'questions', 'own', 'sexuality', 'result', 'basic', 'truths', 'concerning', 'first', 'time.Neeson', 'pursuit', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'liberating', 'truth', 'enhanced', 'successful', 'marriage', 'bright', 'inquisitive', 'spouse', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'attracted', 'Neeson', 'student', 'Indiana', 'University', 'able', 'penetrate', 'initial', 'stuffiness', 'help', 'make', 'better-rounded', 'individual', 'Linney', 'personal', 'sexual', 'explorations', 'use', 'own', 'marriage', 'laboratory', 'learn', 'own', 'erogenous', 'zones', 'how', 'maximize', 'sexual', 'pleasure.A', 'touching', 'element', 'film', 'when', 'tormented', 'lesbian', 'woman', 'thanks', 'Neeson', 'saving', 'life', 'had', 'believed', 'prevailing', 'psychiatric', 'dogma', 'own', 'feelings', 'was', 'considering', 'suicide', 'Kinsey', 'enlightened', 'teachings', 'made', 'feel', 'human', 'being', 'enabled', 'overcome', 'sexual', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'had', 'previously', 'paralyzed']",N/A

It's filled with funny, provocative, and stimulating sexual contents that's on a league of it's own. The performances from Liam Neeson and Laura Linney are mesmerizing! Even the supporting actors are terrific, especially Peter Sarsgaard's scene stealing performance.The story chronicles the professional and married life of Kinsey(Neeson). He started his study in biology, and devoted years in learning about insects. He married his student Clara(Linney), and they did not have premarital intercourse. It was kind of funny how it turned out the first time they had sex. It was too painful for Clara to receive him, because he was too well-endowed! He eventually got interested in human sexual behviours and became an expert in the field after many interviews and research.He went as far as having an affair with his assistant Clyde(Sarsgaard). When he confessed it to Clara, she was devastated, but she knew it was inevitable that he would sleep with another man. This was probably Linney's best scene, and she's great when she cries until her eyes turn red. She eventually made a deal and gets to do the same by sleeping with Clyde, so they are even, and they will be happy again.The book Kinsey wrote became an international best-seller. Unfortunately, the sequel, a research on women was poorly received, and barshed by mainstream society. He was experiencing the fall of his career, but he just kept on going at it....The funniest moments came in when he was interviewing people, or when his co-researchers were interviewing him. The tender moment was when he interviewed his estranged father(John Lithgow) who was sexually traumatized and repressed.I strongly see Liam Neeson getting a best actor nomination, because it's his best work since Rob Roy and Les Miserables .
