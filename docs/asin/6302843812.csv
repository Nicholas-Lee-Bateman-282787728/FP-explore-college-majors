340709,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,6302843812,A fellow with a keyboard,"[1, 2]","This is the only Errol Morris film that I will give less than 5 stars. It's hard to believe I'm going all the way down to 1. That needs explaining.This film could have been equally as good if not better than all the rest. Morris had heard about a rural town in Florida where people had been severing their limbs in order to receive insurance benefits. Certainly there's some substance there - something interesting - not just in the brutality or absurdity but in what it says about us inhabitants of Late Capitalism.But then once he got to Vernon, FL and started filming, he found extreme resistance-- he actually received death threats warning him against including anything related to limb-severing in the film. Understandably, he abandoned the storyline. The result is a movie that is literally about nothing.What's worse is that the movie ends up having a thick whiff of elitism. That's because Morris salvaged his funds by interviewing local eccentrics and including their goofiest quotes in the final cut. Because there're no events and no storyline, we don't get to see who the people really are; we only get to laugh at their surface personas. It's as though we're people-gazing from the sidewalk.  If this movie appeals to us at all, it appeals to the worst parts of us.This was the first Errol Morris movie I had seen and I was so un-smitten that it was years before I tried any of his other films, and, for me, that's this movie's most reprehensible crime. It is seriously disturbing that Vernon, Florida is more popular and more highly-rated thanGates of Heaven, which Roger Ebert has long kept in his top-10-of-all-time list, or thanMr. Death, which might be both the most well-crafted and most meaningful movie I've seen, or thanTabloid, which is the single best ""love"" (quotes deserved) story that I've heard, and includes two of the best moments in recent film memory.If you choose to watch Vernon, Florida, please keep these things in mind.",1,This is the only Errol Morris film that I will give less than 5 stars,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1957,"['only', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'hard', 'believe', ""'m"", 'going', 'way', '1', 'explaining.This', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'rest', 'Morris', 'had', 'heard', 'rural', 'town', 'Florida', 'where', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'severing', 'limbs', 'order', 'receive', 'insurance', 'benefits', 'Certainly', 'substance', 'something', 'interesting', 'not', 'just', 'brutality', 'absurdity', 'what', 'inhabitants', 'Late', 'Capitalism.But', 'then', 'once', 'got', 'Vernon', 'FL', 'started', 'filming', 'found', 'extreme', 'resistance', 'actually', 'received', 'death', 'threats', 'warning', 'including', 'anything', 'related', 'limb-severing', 'film', 'Understandably', 'abandoned', 'storyline', 'result', 'movie', 'literally', 'nothing.What', 'worse', 'movie', 'up', 'having', 'thick', 'whiff', 'elitism', 'Morris', 'salvaged', 'funds', 'interviewing', 'local', 'eccentrics', 'including', 'goofiest', 'quotes', 'final', 'cut', ""'re"", 'events', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'who', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'only', 'get', 'laugh', 'surface', 'personas', ""'re"", 'people-gazing', 'sidewalk', 'movie', 'appeals', 'appeals', 'worst', 'parts', 'us.This', 'was', 'first', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'so', 'un-smitten', 'was', 'years', 'tried', 'other', 'films', 'movie', 'most', 'reprehensible', 'crime', 'seriously', 'disturbing', 'Vernon', 'Florida', 'more', 'popular', 'more', 'highly-rated', 'thanGates', 'Heaven', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'long', 'kept', 'top-10-of-all-time', 'list', 'thanMr', 'Death', 'might', 'be', 'both', 'most', 'well-crafted', 'most', 'meaningful', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thanTabloid', 'single', 'best', 'love', 'deserved', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'two', 'best', 'moments', 'recent', 'film', 'memory.If', 'choose', 'watch', 'Vernon', 'Florida', 'please', 'keep', 'things', 'mind']","Vernon, Florida VHS"

Hunting, fishing, preaching, worm farming, are some of the things that occupy some of them.One old man boasts of buying his house for twenty two hundred dollars, and says he pays no real estate tax on it due to his old age. He looks very content and pleased at this.I personally loved this.  I love to see how people live in this country that is different from how I live.  There is a true wierdness here and it fascinates me.  The accents are rural and take some getting used to.  The inhabitants sound like they aren't terriby bright but I am guessing that no one would be after a lifetime spent in a place like this.  It's a beautiful natural area.  The men here seem to enjoy the experience of telling their thoughts to a camera.  If you like seeing slightly odd places and people in the USA you will enjoy this.One man is obsessed with hunting turkeys and even has the feet and ""beards"" of turkeys he shot mounted and displayed on the outside of his pink trailer and will happily repeat the stories of exactly how he killed them for anyone willing to listen.Vernon Florida was once a laughingstock for being nicknamed ""Nub City"", for having the highest rate of self inflicted mutilations to collect insurance money.  This tiny town of less than eight hundred people had the highest rate of accidental amputations in the country.When a reporter asked a city counselwoman how her husband had lost a hand, she replied""I think you know.""It was for this reason that the filmaker originally was drawn to Vernon as a place to film a movie.  He had lined up some of the people with missing limbs who had collected insurance money but had to abandon this theme when he was threatened with murder.

Renowned documentarian Errol Morris brought his camera to this town -- I don't know how he did it but the people reveal depth and demons that you wouldn't think they would express even before close friends.  The town cop hates giving tickets and hopes that he and his squad car ""just over the bridge coming into town"" will be enough deterrent to speeders.  A local minister seems blissfully unaware that the word ""therefore"" to illustrate linkage in the King James Bible was chosen not by St. Paul but by a panel of early 17th-Century academics --  until he turns around and scores with a novel interpretation. A nice couple relates that their one major vacation has been to the White Sands proving ground in New Mexico, and other than snow-bound mountains it's hard to find a place in the continental USA more unlike Vernon, with its year-round warmth and humidity and pervasive fecundity.  As a souvenir, the couple brought back a mayonnaise jar of (what else?) white sand with claimed unusual properties.The most stunning and significant revelations come from the most far-out Vernonites, the old sage men who are so open they'll tell of any aspect of their lives, from dry heaves to the finer points of wild-turkey hunting.  On a pristine lake in late afternoon one man claims he can hear the buzzards (turkey vultures) murmuring in the trees (or is he trying to put us on?).  At sundown in a tea-stained bayou an even older man noiselessly paddles around drowned trees and ruminates on life, while the changing light and color put us viewers into nearly a transcendent state from the sheer beauty of it all.  It's at those times the interviews stop sounding like auditions for ""Hee-Haw"" and more like a real-life ""Spoon River Anthology.""  What could have been a city-slicker's satire becomes instead a meditation on grace and how it happens, the subtle charms and profundities of the American backwoods, not specifically Florida.VERNON, FLORIDA is a short film, less than an hour, but it contains a lot.

Initially, the legend goes, Morris was drawn to Vernon- a Panhandle town, because, over the prior quarter century dozens of residents had taken up the bizarre practice of cutting off assorted limbs of theirs to collect large insurance payments. The working title of the film was Nub City, but Morris changed the title and focus once several people threatened his life. Morris is said to have chimed in, `They literally became a fraction of themselves to become whole financially.' Yet, the truth is that the sorts of wacky folk portrayed live all over America, and the world- I saw them growing up in New York City, I've seen them in Midwestern suburbs and Great Lakes fishing towns, as well as the heart of Texas. Thus, the thing that I found the most interesting was that this 56 minute long film was not originally a theatrical release, but made for WNET, the New York City public television station.

340722,A32HH93JPN3TVV,6302843812,Miss Ivonne,"[5, 11]","Errol Morris made this documentary in 1982. I loved his Thin Blue Line, one of the most remarkable documentaries ever. Of course, that movie is notable because it succeeded in freeing an innocent man from Texas' Death Row. However, it's a mesmerizing movie on its own merits.Not so with Vernon, Florida. The documentary is simply a patchwork quilt of various of the town's quirky residents just blathering away. One fellow just drones on and on about turkey hunting in the most repetitive fashion. I felt like the one who gets stuck listening to ancient Uncle Joe at the family reunion retell the same pointless stories over and over again. Another man, an octagenarian at the very least, keeps a menagerie of Southern wildlife. A Chicago-born transplant drones on -- well, about the nearby river and not much in particular. The only interesting interview was with the local Dogberry, who basically admits to staging a few speed traps around town.I feel very unkind in not liking what was clearly a labor of love on Morris' part; however, I couldn't see the point of the movie. Life is different in small towns, quirkier somehow? We've lost this sort of slow-paced lifestyle and chatter in America?

Those that despise them - an those, like myself who relish every moment of any  Erroll Morris film.Best known for ""Gates Of Heaven"" which Rodger Ebert considers on the best films ever made - and although I love that film I find Vernon Florida to equally - if not more engaging.It would be dismissive to call this film a comedy, it's a detailed study of ordinary people in a small rural town who, considering their eccentricities are anything but ordinary. The film is quite like being pulled into a still photograph. There's an odd sense of familiarity about it. Regardless of where you're from, or the life you lead. Morris excels where he always does - and that's his sharp, unblinking eye to the human condition and experience.All is never what it appears to be in Vernon, Florida, the dying art of fine story telling, odd and quirky people who remind us not only of the characters who've shaped our lives - but of ourselves. Morris holds up a mirror here - we catch a glimpse of ourselves from time to time and smile.It's simple, but still waters run deep. Vernon, Florida is more than a solid documentary.

The couple with the growing sand, the keeper of the gopher tortise and the turkey hunter are especially hilarious. The turkey hunter is probably the most quoteable character in a movie that I've seen since Carl Childers. He is also the most interesting and likeable. Many, many people who watch this movie find hunting a repellent activity. The extended time given to the turkey hunter in ""Vernon"" gives the open-minded viewer a chance to at least appreciate how much this ""sport"" can mean to someone. Maybe he is obsessed to some unhealthy degree, but I tend to think that's just the way he his.The characters portrayed here remind me of some of the legendary eccentrics in west Iron County, Mich.

340725,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6302843812,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""Vernon, Florida"" is an extremely quirky stream-of-consciousness documentary by Errol Morris about a tiny Florida town that time forgot, and the people who live there. The film's narrative is told through interviews with several loveable and unusual people, who have often-amazing viewpoints. Most heavily featured is a turkey hunter, who has some odd thoughts, expressed in various degrees of eloquence, but whose conversational dialogue is eminently memorable for both his observations and his turns of phrase. I was also taken by the police officer who sat in a conspicuous spot to deter speeding, but who couldn't do anything about it as his radar gun had been sent out of town for calibration. I appreciated his work ethic of pursuing a noble cause, even when his hands were technologically tied behind his back.Probably my favorite character was the gentleman who explained about gemstone examination and how he took a picture of the sky through a camera held next to a pair of opera glasses (""I don't know if it's the moon or not; it looks like some clouds."") He was genuinely mesmerizing to listen to and I would have loved to have seen all the interview footage he participated in. I also loved the old gentleman with the unusual pets. I laughed out loud when he explained he wasn't holding a turtle, but rather a gopher, and that he was hoping to sell his pet opossum at auction for between $1200 and $1500. Understand that I didn't think these men were laughable, I thought they were loveable characters, and supremely interesting. Likewise at the end, I enjoyed the couple explaining how they took a driving vacation to the White Sands Missile Range, and collected some sand in a jar. They were absolutely convinced the sand was growing, and would soon outgrow the jar it was kept in. (""It grows!"")I found the characters absolutely wonderful and was sympathetic to all of them. They reminded me of many of the vanishing small towns in America, and I found their tales disjointed and delightful. From the elderly pet owner to the preacher who earnestly prayed for a van (and got one), I would easily give the entire group of people interviewed five stars. I was sometimes uneasy that the final film may have been condescending to these people, and was encouraging entertainment through mocking these wonderful people with their strange habits, hobbies, pastimes, and beliefs. I think these people are wonderfully refreshing, and this is a documentary that's well worth seeing. It's certainly like no other.",4,"""When You Hear A Turkey Gobble You Can Forget All About Diarrhea.""",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2517,"['Vernon', 'Florida', 'extremely', 'quirky', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'documentary', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'tiny', 'Florida', 'town', 'time', 'forgot', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'film', 'narrative', 'told', 'interviews', 'several', 'loveable', 'unusual', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'often-amazing', 'viewpoints', 'Most', 'heavily', 'featured', 'turkey', 'hunter', 'who', 'odd', 'thoughts', 'expressed', 'various', 'degrees', 'eloquence', 'conversational', 'dialogue', 'eminently', 'memorable', 'observations', 'turns', 'phrase', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'sat', 'conspicuous', 'spot', 'deter', 'speeding', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'radar', 'gun', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'town', 'calibration', 'appreciated', 'work', 'ethic', 'pursuing', 'noble', 'cause', 'even', 'when', 'hands', 'were', 'technologically', 'tied', 'back.Probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'gentleman', 'who', 'explained', 'gemstone', 'examination', 'how', 'took', 'picture', 'sky', 'camera', 'held', 'next', 'pair', 'opera', 'glasses', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'moon', 'not', 'clouds', 'was', 'genuinely', 'mesmerizing', 'listen', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'interview', 'footage', 'participated', 'also', 'loved', 'old', 'gentleman', 'unusual', 'pets', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'explained', 'was', ""n't"", 'holding', 'turtle', 'rather', 'gopher', 'was', 'hoping', 'sell', 'pet', 'opossum', 'auction', '1200', '1500', 'Understand', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'men', 'were', 'laughable', 'thought', 'were', 'loveable', 'characters', 'supremely', 'interesting', 'Likewise', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'couple', 'explaining', 'how', 'took', 'driving', 'vacation', 'White', 'Sands', 'Missile', 'Range', 'collected', 'sand', 'jar', 'were', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'sand', 'was', 'growing', 'would', 'soon', 'outgrow', 'jar', 'was', 'kept', 'found', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'reminded', 'many', 'vanishing', 'small', 'towns', 'America', 'found', 'tales', 'disjointed', 'delightful', 'elderly', 'pet', 'owner', 'preacher', 'who', 'earnestly', 'prayed', 'van', 'got', 'one', 'would', 'easily', 'give', 'entire', 'group', 'people', 'interviewed', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'sometimes', 'uneasy', 'final', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'condescending', 'people', 'was', 'encouraging', 'entertainment', 'mocking', 'wonderful', 'people', 'strange', 'habits', 'hobbies', 'pastimes', 'beliefs', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'refreshing', 'documentary', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'certainly', 'other']","Vernon, Florida VHS"
