1078550,A38IRL0X2T4DPF,B000R349H0,bob turnley,"[0, 0]",It doesn't really seem plausible that Fitz could survive away from Manchester's Police department. Presumably he's found similar work in Australia. My only problem with the story was his embarassing performance at his daughter's wedding reception. It seems a bit of a cliche at this point. Otherwise it was an interesting turn to see the whole 9-11 issue from the outside looking in. The problem most people have with this approach lies in facing the fact that all actions (or inactions) have consequences. You can condemn those consequences but you can't honestly deny their causes.,5,The same but different,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,583,"[""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'plausible', 'Fitz', 'could', 'survive', 'away', 'Manchester', 'Police', 'department', 'Presumably', 'found', 'similar', 'work', 'Australia', 'only', 'problem', 'story', 'was', 'embarassing', 'performance', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'reception', 'bit', 'cliche', 'point', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'interesting', 'turn', 'see', 'whole', '9-11', 'issue', 'outside', 'looking', 'problem', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'approach', 'facing', 'fact', 'actions', 'inactions', 'have', 'consequences', 'can', 'condemn', 'consequences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'deny', 'causes']",N/A

Robbie Coltrane brought this gritty character to life, but, at best, he was just an afterthought  in this episode.  This wasn't a Cracker episode, it was a ""let's bash the Americans"" diatribe.  The nasty Americans funded terrorism in Northern Ireland and then the terrorists came to America; Serves them right!  This is the message being beaten out throughout this episode.  Meanwhile, we're supposed to feel sorry for the killer because the nasty, bad Americans have turned him into a vigilante-killing cop.  Give me a break.  Don't preach your ethics to me and then expect me to sympathize with yet another form of law-breaking terrorist!  If you're a fan of the first 4 seasons/episodes, don't waste your time on this one.  You won't enjoy it if you're hoping to visit with your old friend Fitz.  He's barely a blip on the radar.In regards to Ireland, the Brits are not without blood on their hands.  Read your history people, and might I suggest starting with the executions that followed the Easter Uprising of 1916.  Don't use the Americans as a scapegoat for what the Brits started in Ireland hundreds of years ago.And, by the way, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 killed 8 children under the age of 12.

But you've been warned.This story is ruined by copying American cop show cliches (both in the subject matter of the story and in the TV techniques used to tell it).There's the extended brutality of a junkie being beaten senseless.After flashbacks of a killer's memory of dead children lying on a floor, we see our hero climb stairs to where he knows there are children. We see the legs of the children on the floor, motionless, then we see our hero's pained face, then we see the children alive and smiling, watching TV (just like we are at this point). Why the horrified expression on our hero if the kids are all right? It's just a gimmick.One of the things this story supposedly tries to do is make Americans look bad.One of the victims is an American who's ""sniffing around our women"" and who treats the Manchester police like valets (in the American, not the British, sense of the word).Most of the killer's victims are Americans who show a lack of respect for  the British military. (It's a joke about the British in Northern Ireland that triggers the first murder, not anything to do with Bush's war in Iraq or his ""lap dog"" Tony Blair.)In fact, the cause of all these murders is Britain's occupation of Belfast, not the U.S. occupation of Iraq.As it turns out, the Manchester police would have found the killer just as soon even if they hadn't enticed Fitz away from his family.Of course Fitz confronts the killer and gets him to admit to trying to get the police to kill him because he's afraid to commit suicide. But it looks to me like it's Fitz who's trying to get the killer to kill him, because Fitz can't deal any more with being a drunk and a compulsive gambler who's driven all the people who love him away. (This scene is a cheat, too, making it seem the killer may be granting Fitz his self-destructive wish, but you know he can't be.)This whole story could have been told if the attacks on September 11 had never happened. I think the producers just wanted to make the story more relevant by tying it to what what Robert Harris inThe Ghost: A Novelcalled ""a new Hundred Years War.""",3,Cracker: But an OLD Terror,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,2299,"['surprise', 'third', 'show', 'cop', 'story', 'so', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'talking', 'detail', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'important', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned.This', 'story', 'ruined', 'copying', 'American', 'cop', 'show', 'cliches', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'TV', 'techniques', 'used', 'tell', 'extended', 'brutality', 'junkie', 'being', 'beaten', 'senseless.After', 'flashbacks', 'killer', 'memory', 'dead', 'children', 'lying', 'floor', 'see', 'hero', 'climb', 'stairs', 'where', 'are', 'children', 'see', 'legs', 'children', 'floor', 'motionless', 'then', 'see', 'hero', 'pained', 'face', 'then', 'see', 'children', 'alive', 'smiling', 'watching', 'TV', 'just', 'are', 'point', 'Why', 'horrified', 'expression', 'hero', 'kids', 'are', 'right', 'just', 'gimmick.One', 'things', 'story', 'supposedly', 'do', 'make', 'Americans', 'look', 'bad.One', 'victims', 'American', 'who', 'sniffing', 'around', 'women', 'who', 'Manchester', 'police', 'valets', 'American', 'not', 'British', 'sense', 'word', '.Most', 'killer', 'victims', 'are', 'Americans', 'who', 'show', 'lack', 'respect', 'British', 'military', 'joke', 'British', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'first', 'murder', 'not', 'anything', 'do', 'Bush', 'war', 'Iraq', 'lap', 'dog', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'fact', 'cause', 'murders', 'Britain', 'occupation', 'Belfast', 'not', 'U.S.', 'occupation', 'Iraq.As', 'out', 'Manchester', 'police', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'killer', 'just', 'soon', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'enticed', 'Fitz', 'away', 'family.Of', 'course', 'Fitz', 'killer', 'admit', 'trying', 'get', 'police', 'kill', 'afraid', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Fitz', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'killer', 'kill', 'Fitz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'more', 'being', 'drunk', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'who', 'driven', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'away', 'scene', 'cheat', 'too', 'making', 'seem', 'killer', 'may', 'be', 'granting', 'Fitz', 'self-destructive', 'wish', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'attacks', 'September', '11', 'had', 'never', 'happened', 'think', 'producers', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'relevant', 'tying', 'what', 'what', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'Ghost', 'Novelcalled', 'new', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War']",N/A

Schwartz,"[0, 0]","This might have been called 'the Return of Cracker', since Fitz has been in Australia for a decade and returns to find a new Manchester.  This one is fueled by drug money.  The atmospherics are created by a series of quick-cut montages with loud news reports in the background, all of them focusing on war, terrorism and the politicians held responsible for them.  In the subsidiary material on the DVD, Robbie Coltrane points out that the writer (Jimmy McGovern) is motivated to write by his personal experience and personal anger.  In this case, he's angry about Iraq (and still angry about the work of the IRA in Ulster and beyond).  Presumably, he's also angry about what's happened to Manchester and the cause of all of these problems and issues is, in his judgment, the US.  This will seem strange to American audiences, for my guess is that the strongest supporters of the war in Iraq do not overlap significantly with the American supporters of the IRA, i.e., those who have supported the IRA with American dollars.  They're both American, of course, but the point is that blind blame of the 'USA' lacks nuance, since many Americans do not support the effort in Iraq and many find the actions of the IRA horrific (along with the support of it by American citizens).This is important to the film since the murderer (superbly played by Anthony Flanagan) has been a soldier in Ulster and is haunted by the memories of his experience there.  The problem is that he comes across as a decent, even likeable man whose actions are explainable, if not justified, by his experience.  In many ways he carries the film, since he is on screen almost constantly.  It is an old rule of narrative that we come to like prominent villains because we have come to know them well.  That is certainly the case here, particularly when his victims are unpleasant types who deserve some punishment (if not in the form that they receive).  The bottom line is that Fitz is brilliant but unpleasant and irresponsible (as always) and his antagonist in this story has many redeeming features, while the cause of his condition and the blame (totally) laid at the feet of the US seems to lack nuance.  The wonderful psychological complexities of both the protagonist and antagonist are undercut by the political screed which constitutes the historical backdrop for the action and atmospherics of the setting.  It's worth watching, but--to this viewer--off the mark in its effects on the audience.",3,Fitz is back,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2473,"['might', 'have', 'been', 'called', ""'the"", 'Return', 'Cracker', 'Fitz', 'been', 'Australia', 'decade', 'returns', 'find', 'new', 'Manchester', 'one', 'fueled', 'drug', 'money', 'atmospherics', 'are', 'created', 'series', 'quick-cut', 'montages', 'loud', 'news', 'reports', 'background', 'focusing', 'war', 'terrorism', 'politicians', 'held', 'responsible', 'subsidiary', 'material', 'DVD', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'points', 'out', 'writer', 'Jimmy', 'McGovern', 'motivated', 'write', 'personal', 'experience', 'personal', 'anger', 'case', 'angry', 'Iraq', 'still', 'angry', 'work', 'IRA', 'Ulster', 'Presumably', 'also', 'angry', 'what', 'happened', 'Manchester', 'cause', 'problems', 'issues', 'judgment', 'US', 'will', 'seem', 'strange', 'American', 'audiences', 'guess', 'strongest', 'supporters', 'war', 'Iraq', 'do', 'not', 'overlap', 'significantly', 'American', 'supporters', 'IRA', 'i.e.', 'who', 'have', 'supported', 'IRA', 'American', 'dollars', ""'re"", 'American', 'course', 'point', 'blind', 'blame', ""'USA"", 'lacks', 'nuance', 'many', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'effort', 'Iraq', 'many', 'find', 'actions', 'IRA', 'horrific', 'support', 'American', 'citizens', '.This', 'important', 'film', 'murderer', 'superbly', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Flanagan', 'been', 'soldier', 'Ulster', 'haunted', 'memories', 'experience', 'there', 'problem', 'across', 'decent', 'even', 'likeable', 'man', 'actions', 'are', 'explainable', 'not', 'justified', 'experience', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'screen', 'almost', 'constantly', 'old', 'rule', 'narrative', 'come', 'like', 'prominent', 'villains', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'well', 'certainly', 'case', 'here', 'particularly', 'when', 'victims', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'types', 'who', 'deserve', 'punishment', 'not', 'form', 'receive', 'bottom', 'line', 'Fitz', 'brilliant', 'unpleasant', 'irresponsible', 'always', 'antagonist', 'story', 'many', 'redeeming', 'features', 'cause', 'condition', 'blame', 'totally', 'laid', 'feet', 'US', 'lack', 'nuance', 'wonderful', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'are', 'undercut', 'political', 'screed', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'action', 'atmospherics', 'setting', 'worth', 'watching', 'viewer', 'mark', 'effects', 'audience']",N/A

It stars, as usual, Robbie Coltrane, who since this 1990s TV triumph that first made him famous, has gone on to burnish his name on the bigger screen inOcean's Twelve; the ""Harry Potter"" series, and a couple of ""James Bond 007s.""  It is billed as the final episode of ""Cracker,"" though some of us surely hope not.In this feature-length production, Coltrane reprises his title role as Dr. Edward ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald, controversial criminologist, abrasive, arrogant and brilliant psychologist.  Coltrane dominates the film, of course, with his powerful portrayal of his character.  At any rate, Fitz, his long-suffering wife Judith (Barbara Flynn), and their youngest son supposedly have lived as ex-pats in Australia for nearly a decade, while he grapples with his addictions to drink, cigarettes and gambling.  They now return to their hometown, Manchester, for the wedding of his daughter.  Fitz is, of course, older, fatter, and grayer, and, as a further result of his heavy indulgences, he's looking into Viagra.  But he's still capable of rising to the occasion: he can mortify his daughter at her wedding; and get himself involved in helping the local police solve a puzzling murder case.Fitz finds England much changed in the aftermath of America's horrendous 9/11 terrorist experience; and we are given frequent big bites of TV news shows dealing with American President George Bush, English Prime Minister Tony Blair, and our war in Iraq. Fitz also finds Manchester, a beautiful and interesting city that we don't generally see over here, greatly changed since he left: taxi drivers tell him the changes are due to American, Irish, and drug money: that the city's awash in drugs.  The city's also awash in its own accent, that we on these shores would find difficult; happily, the DVD offers unadvertised closed captioning, among its advertised extra features: interviews with Coltrane, Flynn, McGovern, and other cast members, etc.The murder investigation centers on a handsome, unusually sensitive young local cop, Kenny Archer, played by Anthony Flanagan.  He appears to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his previous service in the bloody, long-running war in Northern Ireland.  And he's come up with a series of interesting theories that blame everything on the U.S.  We're responsible for the Northern Ireland war, as we -- mainly our Irish-Americans, of course-- bankrolled it. (And there are a couple of anti-Irish cracks in the film's text, too.) The terrorist attacks of 9/11 are nothing more than the terrorism we sponsored in Northern Ireland come home to haunt us, as well.  We're also responsible for Manchester's drug problem, as we then threw the Taliban, the ruling clique of anti-American,Islamic crazies, who were controlling the drug trade, out of Afghanistan.  Almost needless to say, finally, we're responsible for the mess in Iraq, and the deaths of British troops there.  Did I mention that, beyond its undoubted competence as a mystery/thriller, the film is very anti-American, and will infuriate some possible viewers, who'd best give it a miss?",3,Some Viewers Had Best Give It a Miss,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,3638,"['Cracker', 'New', 'Terror', 'free-standing', 'episode', 'highly-popular', 'highly-acclaimed', 'award-winning', 'British', '1990', 'television', 'detective', 'series', 'made', 'initial', 'debut', '1993', 'was', 'made', 'Granada', '2006', 'British', 'Independent', 'Television', 'ITV', 'was', 'seen', 'United', 'States', 'BBC', 'America', 'released', 'here', 'DVD', 'late', '2007', 'mystery/thriller', 'was', 'written', 'veteran', 'Jimmy', 'McGovern', 'creator', 'series', 'writer', 'strongest', 'episodes', 'directed', 'Antonia', 'Bird', 'Hamburg', 'Cell', 'usual', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'who', '1990s', 'TV', 'triumph', 'first', 'made', 'famous', 'gone', 'burnish', 'name', 'bigger', 'screen', 'inOcean', 'Twelve', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'couple', 'James', 'Bond', '007s', 'billed', 'final', 'episode', 'Cracker', 'surely', 'hope', 'feature-length', 'production', 'Coltrane', 'title', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Edward', 'Fitz', 'Fitzgerald', 'controversial', 'criminologist', 'abrasive', 'arrogant', 'brilliant', 'psychologist', 'Coltrane', 'film', 'course', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'character', 'rate', 'Fitz', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Judith', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'youngest', 'son', 'supposedly', 'have', 'lived', 'ex-pats', 'Australia', 'nearly', 'decade', 'addictions', 'drink', 'cigarettes', 'gambling', 'now', 'return', 'hometown', 'Manchester', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Fitz', 'course', 'older', 'fatter', 'grayer', 'further', 'result', 'heavy', 'indulgences', 'looking', 'Viagra', 'still', 'capable', 'rising', 'occasion', 'can', 'mortify', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'get', 'involved', 'helping', 'local', 'police', 'solve', 'puzzling', 'murder', 'case.Fitz', 'England', 'much', 'changed', 'aftermath', 'America', 'horrendous', '9/11', 'terrorist', 'experience', 'are', 'given', 'frequent', 'big', 'bites', 'TV', 'news', 'shows', 'dealing', 'American', 'President', 'George', 'Bush', 'English', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Fitz', 'also', 'Manchester', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'city', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'see', 'here', 'greatly', 'changed', 'left', 'taxi', 'drivers', 'tell', 'changes', 'are', 'due', 'American', 'Irish', 'drug', 'money', 'city', 'awash', 'drugs', 'city', 'also', 'own', 'accent', 'shores', 'would', 'find', 'difficult', 'happily', 'DVD', 'offers', 'unadvertised', 'closed', 'captioning', 'advertised', 'extra', 'features', 'interviews', 'Coltrane', 'Flynn', 'McGovern', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'etc.The', 'murder', 'investigation', 'centers', 'handsome', 'unusually', 'sensitive', 'young', 'local', 'cop', 'Kenny', 'Archer', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Flanagan', 'be', 'suffering', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'result', 'previous', 'service', 'bloody', 'long-running', 'war', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'come', 'up', 'series', 'interesting', 'theories', 'blame', 'everything', 'U.S.', ""'re"", 'responsible', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'war', 'mainly', 'Irish-Americans', 'course', 'bankrolled', 'are', 'couple', 'anti-Irish', 'cracks', 'film', 'text', 'too', 'terrorist', 'attacks', '9/11', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'terrorism', 'sponsored', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'come', 'home', 'haunt', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'also', 'responsible', 'Manchester', 'drug', 'problem', 'then', 'threw', 'Taliban', 'ruling', 'clique', 'anti-American', 'Islamic', 'crazies', 'who', 'were', 'controlling', 'drug', 'trade', 'Afghanistan', 'Almost', 'needless', 'say', 'finally', ""'re"", 'responsible', 'mess', 'Iraq', 'deaths', 'British', 'troops', 'there', 'Did', 'mention', 'undoubted', 'competence', 'mystery/thriller', 'film', 'very', 'anti-American', 'will', 'infuriate', 'possible', 'viewers', 'who', ""'d"", 'best', 'give', 'miss']",N/A
1078564,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000R349H0,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[4, 4]","Recently, AV Club had an article decrying the anti-hero as an overused trope. Dr. House, Tony Soprano, Nurse Betty, Larry David have taken over and now no one can be simply heroic without having a major drug problem or being a sociopath. While I don't completely agree with the article, I kept thinking about when I saw this creation.Robbie Coltrane who is usually quite funny and amusing is straitjacketed by this character. He's surly and mean. His drunken rants which embarrass his daughter at her wedding and lead him to ignore his wife and kid would be endearingly iconoclastic if he wasn't so nasty about it. He's like those people whom you think are being amusingly cranky for effect (Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Seasons 1-6has Larry David swearing and cursing his way through life for example) but then turn out to be just meanspirited. This is a shame since Hugh Laurie has a similar character with Dr. House and yet he makes the cranky vicodin addict strangely endearing (and sometimes agonizingly repentant and human). Maybe the series was better, but I have only this DVD to judge. And in this particular two hour movie, he's just an awful unpleasant crank. If I want to spend two hours with awful unpleasant drunks, I'll visit my cousins more often.However, the horrible main character is only part of the problem. The show would even rate a couple of stars if only the story wasn't so dull. Moving at a snail's pace, the story about a former British soldier dealing with his PTSD by killing Americans plods along with a horrible dullness. He's not an engaging villain. The tension is non-existent and everything is just leading to an inevitable confrontation without surprises.But what really makes this show unbearable is the way the screenwriter injects his politics into every single scene. My British friends tell me that this show was praised for being political, but there's a right way and a wrong way to deal with political issues. See The Wire: The Complete Series where drug enforcement, unions, municipal politics, school systems and newspapers are roasted with the ferocity of a thwarted idealist and yet the humanity comes through and the writer knows that it's about characters.There is no character in this movie. There's only one guy ranting and raving about all those darn Americans and their hypocrisy. The Iraqi war is wrong. The Afghanistan war is wrong. America had 9/11 coming to it. Americans are hypocrites for funding the Irish Republican Army and its campaign of terror and then getting angry when other terrorists attack America (we also funded the Zionists who ran a much more successful campaign of terror against the British in 1947 when they wouldn't get out of Israel - thankfully, the screenwriter is merely tedious and not anti-semitic). The show even outright lies in places, like when the villain claims that Manchester was much more peaceful when the Taliban was in Afghanistan because the Taliban stopped the drug trade to Manchester but then the Americans ruined it. Considering that the Taliban funded their operations from their heroin trade, that's not only a lie, but it's a stupid lie since anyone who actually reads newspapers can see through it.But that doesn't matter to the screenwriter. Instead, he cares about the fact that America is bad. And he's angry, gosh darnit. Forget about telling a compelling story with interesting characters. He would prefer to rant and rave against the evil America.
