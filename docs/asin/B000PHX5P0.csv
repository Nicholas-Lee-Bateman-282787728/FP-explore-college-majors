Tommy boy is such a classic of a movie. It has a great feel through the whole movie and it WILL keep you laughing. Black Sheep is a bit wackier then Tommy Boy and lacks that good feeling, however, the guys still deliver and its hilarious. I was hoping for remastered but it seems both of these were just up-scales of the original. But if you enjoy these movies you should get them on blu ray its always nice to watch something you enjoy in a better quality i suppose. It has great special features for Tommy Boy.
