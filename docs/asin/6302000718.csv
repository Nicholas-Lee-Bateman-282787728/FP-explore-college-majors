290038,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,6302000718,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[2, 3]","This film came out in 1959, and the then 20 year old Sal Mineogives what I think is one of the defining performances of hisbrief and all-too-tragic career!I have posted several reviews on the work of Sal Mineo...he was an amazing and highly underappreciated talent in his lifetimewho had a few moments in great films where he really got to show theworld a glimpse of what he was made of!He was a talent far beyond his years who worked really hard to developand inhabit the characters he played in a time when that was unheard of!In his written and televised biographies, his sister Sarina recants thatSal Mineo became so deeply immersed in Gene Krupa that he taught himself howto play drums to almost the same intensity level of Gene Krupa,who was one of the first virtuoso drum soloists in jazz history!He hang out a lot with Krupa to absorb his story and to get a feel forhis fiery personality, and the two struck up a lifelong friendship.All this becomes evident when you see Sal's amazing performance in one of thefew big screen movies where he was featured as the headliner.He is supported by the beautiful Susan Kohner, who played the troubledSara Jane, the self-hating mulatto child in another 1959 classic, ""Imitation Of Life"".She plays his principle love interest in this.Other supporting cast members include James Darren, Susan Oliver and others whowould become big stars later on. I'll allow you to discover them for yourselfwhen you see this film. (-:Sal Mineo was on top of the world during this time and recieved great reviewsand accolades from his peers for this role. It's a shame that he only had one otherbig role after this one in the 1960 Otto Preminger film, EXODUS, in which he wona golden globe for that role as ""Dov"", the nazi-hating jewish radical.Even though he was nominated for 2 oscars and won a golden globe, Sal Mineo's careerwas plunged into a tailspin when the powers that be in Hollywood of that time decidedthat he was a has-been at 22. He spent the rest of the 60's into the mid 70'strying to regain the place in the industry that he had once held,turning in some very interesting and ahead of their time performances whichmade some very uncomfortable ( Who Killed Teddy Bear? and Fortune In Men's Eyes)during those wild in some ways, but still very much conservative in other ways, times.Sal Mineo was a masculine, attractive, talented man that was forward-thinking enough todare to live openly as a gay man at a time when that was career suicide for an actor!But he forged on in spite of this, eeking out a living in TV, commercials, off broadway playsand was at threshold of a triumphant comeback when he was murdered by a random manin an attempted robbery in February of 1976.So much talent & promise misused and lost forever!That's why it's great to go back and see movies like this one,to ponder what might've been had he been given a chance back then in his youth.A very good classic film for those who love classic films.",5,Sal Mineo Sparkles In The Late 1950's Bio-Pic About The Great Gene Krupa!!,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2966,"['film', 'came', 'out', '1959', 'then', '20', 'year', 'old', 'Sal', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'defining', 'performances', 'hisbrief', 'all-too-tragic', 'career', 'have', 'posted', 'several', 'reviews', 'work', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'was', 'amazing', 'highly', 'underappreciated', 'talent', 'lifetimewho', 'had', 'few', 'moments', 'great', 'films', 'where', 'really', 'got', 'show', 'theworld', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'talent', 'far', 'years', 'who', 'worked', 'really', 'hard', 'developand', 'inhabit', 'characters', 'played', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'unheard', 'written', 'televised', 'biographies', 'sister', 'Sarina', 'recants', 'thatSal', 'Mineo', 'became', 'so', 'deeply', 'immersed', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'taught', 'howto', 'play', 'drums', 'almost', 'same', 'intensity', 'level', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'virtuoso', 'drum', 'soloists', 'jazz', 'history', 'hang', 'out', 'lot', 'Krupa', 'absorb', 'story', 'get', 'feel', 'forhis', 'fiery', 'personality', 'two', 'struck', 'up', 'lifelong', 'friendship.All', 'evident', 'when', 'see', 'Sal', 'amazing', 'performance', 'one', 'thefew', 'big', 'screen', 'movies', 'where', 'was', 'featured', 'headliner.He', 'supported', 'beautiful', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'who', 'played', 'troubledSara', 'Jane', 'self-hating', 'mulatto', 'child', '1959', 'classic', 'Imitation', 'Life', '.She', 'principle', 'love', 'interest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'James', 'Darren', 'Susan', 'Oliver', 'others', 'whowould', 'become', 'big', 'stars', 'later', ""'ll"", 'allow', 'discover', 'yourselfwhen', 'see', 'film', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'was', 'top', 'world', 'time', 'recieved', 'great', 'reviewsand', 'accolades', 'peers', 'role', 'shame', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'otherbig', 'role', 'one', '1960', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'film', 'EXODUS', 'wona', 'golden', 'globe', 'role', 'Dov', 'nazi-hating', 'jewish', 'radical.Even', 'was', 'nominated', '2', 'oscars', 'won', 'golden', 'globe', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'careerwas', 'plunged', 'tailspin', 'when', 'powers', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'was', 'has-been', '22', 'spent', 'rest', '60', 'mid', ""70'strying"", 'regain', 'place', 'industry', 'had', 'once', 'held', 'turning', 'very', 'interesting', 'ahead', 'time', 'performances', 'whichmade', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'Fortune', 'Men', 'Eyes', 'wild', 'ways', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'conservative', 'other', 'ways', 'Mineo', 'was', 'masculine', 'attractive', 'talented', 'man', 'was', 'forward-thinking', 'enough', 'todare', 'live', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'career', 'suicide', 'actor', 'forged', 'spite', 'eeking', 'out', 'living', 'TV', 'commercials', 'off', 'broadway', 'playsand', 'was', 'threshold', 'triumphant', 'comeback', 'when', 'was', 'murdered', 'random', 'manin', 'attempted', 'robbery', 'February', '1976.So', 'much', 'talent', 'promise', 'misused', 'lost', 'forever', 'why', 'great', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'movies', 'one', 'ponder', 'what', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'back', 'then', 'youth.A', 'very', 'good', 'classic', 'film', 'who', 'love', 'classic', 'films']",N/A
290039,A3D6DPWQW509R9,6302000718,John Seger,"[34, 36]","At long last, &quot;The Gene Krupa story&quot; has been released on DVD by Sony/Columbia home video. Rather than review the actual film, this review concentrates on the DVD format as I am very pleased with this edition!The DVD is nicely packaged with a color picture on the front of the box.The film's glorious black and white has been digitally remastered and the clarity is just amazing. Even more important, the film is presented in full &quot;widescreen&quot; so you can view the film the way it was originally presented in theatres. This allows you to view the entire scope of the screen, instead of having the left and right sides of the screen chopped off into a crappy traditional &quot;square&quot; television format. You can see so much more as we all know how wonderful wide screen is.Although the soundtrack is still &quot;mono,&quot; Sony has digitally remastered it, and presents it on this disc in &quot;Dolby Digital.&quot; This makes a huge difference as the sound is deeper, lusher, and does great justice to the music.This is simply a beautiful presentation of this film.There are no &quot;special features&quot; such as behind the scenes or out takes, however it does have an interactive menu complete with chapter search.This DVD version of the film blows the old VHS version out of the water! For me, this DVD gave me a fresh new viewpoint of the film. The widescreen format compliments Sal's drumming so much that the VHS version could never come close to doing.I rate this DVD a 10+ on the scale of 1-10!If you love this film as much as I do, BUY THE DVD! Now, if only &quot;Who Killed Teddy Bear&quot; could be released on DVD..Now that would be a treat!I am concluding this review with some technical specs:Screen Formats: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1Closed Captioned Language and Sound: English: Dolby Digital MonoOriginal Release Date in theatres: 1959.Released to DVD in May, 2004",5,FINALLY ON DVD!!!!

290044,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302000718,Only-A-Child,"[12, 17]","Imagine that it is 1970 and they have just released ""The Frank Sinatra Story"" with then 20 year-old David Cassidy playing the Italian crooner from ages 17 through 47. If that sounds weird imagine that the production designer on the film never shows up and they film it as if everything from 1935 to 1965 looks (and everyone talks) like it is set in 1970. Finally imagine that to preserve the 1970's look, all the action takes place inside, with one short scene on an indoor sound stage with fake grass and trees.That is essentially ""The Gene Krupa Story"", with bobby soxer heartthrob Sal Mineo replacing Cassidy, Krupa replacing Sinatra, and the look of 1959 replacing 1970. Mineo was the Cassidy of his generation, with about the same level of acting talent but harder working and more willing to take direction.Like the imagined ""Cassidy as Sinatra"" film, the idea was to expand the target audience by including someone who would attract teen and pre-teen girls. In this ""The Gene Krupa Story"" was successful and the film had good box office. The downside was that big band fans generally considered the whole production laughable. My father was a huge Krupa fan and he hated this film with an unprecedented passion. In part for the cheap production design and in part because of Mineo and the reasons for his casting, but largely because of the many factual omissions and distortions. To him the only saving grace was that they used Krupa's actual drumming, to which Mineo is generally in sync although there are times when he is beating a tom and the sound is that of a cymbal.Like most Hollywood bio movies (""The Lou Gerhig Story"", ""The Al Jolson Story"", etc.) Krupa's mother was violently opposed to her son's ambitions, in this case she and her husband want him to be a priest. But he leaves the seminary to set out for New York with Eddie Sirota (James Darren) and Eddie's composer girlfriend, Ethel (Susan Kohner). After a rough three months Ethel is forced to take a job as a telephone operator and her romantic interest switches to Gene.Gene's career takes off and he begins running with a fast crowd of 1930's musicians (who sound strangely like a Maynard G. Kreb's take on the 1950's beat scene). A jazz singer named Dorissa Dinell (Susan Oliver) connects him with some dope dealers and the film gets a lot like ""Reefer Madness"" (but with a 1959 setting). Which may account for a surreal montage of newspaper headlines chronicling his rise to national fame and his fall in a drug bust. There is even an ""I told you so"" phone call from mom. This has ramifications beyond Krupa as the entire jazz world is outed as dope fiends and corrupter of America's youth. When the chips are down, Dorissa bails on Gene with the classic exit line: ""Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a town I'd better get out of."" Gene is reduced to playing in strip clubs with other beatnik musicians wearing dark glasses. When it seems like he can't go on another day Ethel re-enters his life and things begin to break his way once again.For the aging sequences Mineo could draw upon the example James Dean, who he worked with in both ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Giant"". Dean was faced with the same challenge in ""Giant"" and Mineo's attempt here is clearly superior. So much so that what could have been the film's biggest liability is actually a strength. And Mineo successfully mimics Krupa distinctive drumming style and facial expressions, details that he worked on with Krupa himself. There are seven drum solo set pieces, mostly medium shots that capture the spirit if not the actual magic of a Krupa performance.Susan Kohner shows considerable range in two of her 1959 films, this one and ""Imitation of Life"". Here she will remind you of Eva Marie Saint's ""On the Waterfront"" character, a considerable contrast with the overwrought racially conflicted daughter she played in the other film. The likable James Darren (later to star in television's ""The Time Tunnel"") is a better singer than an actor. His scenes with Mineo are pretty awful, certainly the film's worst moments, and the fault does not lie with Mineo who tends to play up or down to the level of whoever he shares a scene. The hard working Mineo simply did not have enough talent or training to salvage a scene gone bad and really needed to be surrounded by a strong cast to help him sell his characterizations.

290047,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302000718,Simon Davis,"[30, 31]","For jazz and music lovers &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;, is unsurpassed entertainment of the first order and contains some of the best ever work by talented actor Sal Mineo. Sal took on his first real solo starring role in this biography of the legendary Gene Krupa who as the percussionist for the Benny Goodman Quartet became the first real jazz heartthrob developing a legion of besotted fans. A major part of his legend was his innovative playing of the drums and in this film Sal Mineo manages to recreate that special magic, with some of the most amazing precussion work ever caught on screen. Having gained stardom for his sensational work in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, Sal Mineo was at just the right age and level of acting experience to tackle this major acting role and to his credit he manages all the stages in Krupa's life in a totally believable manner with a minimum of sentiment. Mineo's level of understanding of both the sheer genius of Krupa's ability and also his darker personal side makes for a wonderful screen performance that stays in the mind and makes &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;, a viewing experience to treasure.The film traces Krupa's life from his humble beginnings in Chicago as the youngest child of working class parents who live by the rules of traditional life based around family and the church. We get a very early glimpse of the conflict already existing in young Gene when he brings home a set of drums which his angry father smashes as unsuitable for his son to be wasting his time on. After his father's death Gene however bows to the expectations of his family and joins the priesthood but after a year realises that it is not the life for him. He joins up with friend Eddie Sirota (James Darren) and his band and begins playing in many of Chicago's speakeasies. Eddie has a girlfriend Ethel (Susan Kohner), however soon a real attraction develops between her and Gene. Determined to succeed Gene soon pursuades Eddie to make a stab at work in New York's jazz scene. After a rough start and surviving on little money Gene through the force of his personality and sheer talent , manages to get a break which sees him climbing to stardom as the most electrifying performer in New York's big band scene. However stardom with all its adulation and material benefits also reveals its dark side as Gene begins to become involved in the heavy drug and drinking culture of the musicians world. His success also sees him begin to loose sight of the people who are important to him as he becomes alienated from Ethel who after committing herself to Gene finds herself forgotten. Best friend Eddie also drifts away as he doesn't approve of his friends free wheeling drug laden lifestyle. After being set up on a drug charge Gene's world rapidly crumbles before his eyes and he serves a jail term for possession which sees all those people, like selfish singer Dorissa Dinell, supposedly his lover abandon him in his hour of need. Upon release Gene experiences the full force of being considered a &quot;has been&quot;, as he is reduced to performing in strip clubs and gambling houses. The hard times however refuel Gene's earlier love of music for the sheer joy of it and ever faithful Ethel comes back into his life as the steadying force she always was in the hard times. The conclusion sees Gene reunited with Eddie's band and setting out on a new life as the talented drummer that he is but this time with a more level view of what is important in life, which in his case is the devoted love of Ethel.Sal Mineo is perfectly cast as Gene Krupa and he actually received the wholehearted blessing of the jazz legend to play him in the film. Mineo worked with Krupa to perfect his drum playing and the result on screen is sensational as Sal Mineo gives his heart and sole to his playing. The drum playing was actually recorded by Krupa however Mineo had the difficult task of matching that on screen which he does admirably. Totally devoted to perfecting his craft as an actor Mineo died far too young and sadly saw his star eclipsed long before it should have. This film along with &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, and &quot;Exodus&quot;, among others is this talented actors legacy to the movie going public and he will be remembered always for his great work in them. The supporting cast is uniformily fine with James Darren as Krupa's best friend Eddie, the before mentioned Susan Kohner as Ethel, and Susan Oliver in the hard driven role of Dorissa really shining and they perfectly compliment Sal Mineo's work. Appearances by real life jazz performers Buddy Lester, Red Nichols and Anita day also add an authentic ring to the story depicted. Character actress Celia Lovsky also has a memorable role as Gene's disapproving mother who is mystified by her son's obsession with the drums. The photography in &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;, is top flight with the often seedy black and white photography highly effective in particular in both Gene's pre stardom scenes and those depicted in his fall from grace when much of the action takes place in seedy &quot;greyish&quot;, surroundings. Mineo's supreme concentration on his playing of the drums is a marvel to watch and is guaranteed to leave you breathless.The great thing about &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;,  is that you dont have to be a jazz enthusiast to enjoy the story or the music. For any lover of the drums it makes compulsory viewing and the golden age of jazz in the 30's is authentically recreated in this Columbia studios production. For me the best thing about the film will always be seeing the extraordinary talent of Sal Mineo on display. He combines strength and a touching vulnerability in his playing of Gene Krupa that leaves you rooting for him right through. I highly recommend this film to all lovers of jazz/swing and to those that like the less sentimental kind of performer film biography. Enjoy Sal Mineo at his electrifying best in &quot;Columbia's &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;.",5,One Of Sal Mineo's Finest Performances,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,6025,"['jazz', 'music', 'lovers',

290048,A1UNXGWM0060AG,6302000718,"Spunkychk ""Book Freak""","[1, 1]","Sal Mineo was perfect for this part, and Krupa must have been thrilled. Apparently the actor trained with Krupa for a year before the filming. Mineo's physical drumming is almost as amazing as the great drummer himself. And what floors me is that Krupa actually played the sound track!After the film's release, many criticized it for its inaccuracies, and naturally that's a darn shame. On one hand I can't imagine Krupa was too pleased by this, but those who played with him have stated that the scene where he drops his drumstick while playing with Tommy Dorsey during his comeback after serving jail time was spot on. That's good enough for me.Unlike the flicks ""The Glenn Miller Story"" and ""The Benny Goodman Story"", Krupa's ""story"" didn't hesitate to show the man as he truly was... blemishes and all. I like that and it's rare in those '50s movies.My only complaint is the dramatic scenes with his girlfriend (who actually was his wife TWICE) got draggy... but somehow I trust Krupa wanted the world to know just how important his love and gratitude for her was. Ethyl Krupa died in '55, four years prior to the film's release.Of course no one can replicate Krupa's dynamic off-stage personality which drew the top musicians of the Swing Era to him, but Sal Mineo certainly gave it a shot and deserves the praise the critics gave him. From my investigations everyone around Krupa loved performing with him... he had a way of bringing out their best talents because they liked him so much. That didn't come across strongly enough in the film to me - but who cares?
