Although this film suffers, in part, from a lack of a bigger budget, there's certainly no poverty of interesting ideas in the story. PROJECT X is a combination of Science-fiction thriller and espionage thriller, and the two elements blend together rather cleverly. What's also interesting about this movie is that Castle got the services of Hanna-Barbera to do some very fascinating special-effects sequences. I remember seeing this movie at Steel Pier in Atlantic City when I was 15 years old, and always had fond memories of it. When I finally obtained, after hunting this down for years, a copy of the movie on DVD, I played it and was not disappointed-it's still lived up to those memories.",5,Fascinating William Castle Sci-FI Thriller,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,938,"['Most', 'director/producer', 'William', 'Castle', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'either', 'straight', 'horror', 'light', 'macabre', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'so', 'unusual', 'science-fiction', 'entry', 'long', 'list', 'films', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'genre', 'film', 'suffers', 'part', 'lack', 'bigger', 'budget', 'certainly', 'poverty', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'story', 'PROJECT', 'X', 'combination', 'Science-fiction', 'thriller', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'two', 'elements', 'blend', 'together', 'rather', 'cleverly', 'What', 'also', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Castle', 'got', 'services', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'do', 'very', 'fascinating', 'special-effects', 'sequences', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Steel', 'Pier', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'when', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'always', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'When', 'finally', 'obtained', 'hunting', 'down', 'years', 'copy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'played', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed-it', 'still', 'lived', 'up', 'memories']",N/A

There are now bonus features as this is a bare bones release.  I must comment Olive Films on the quality. For a film of it's age the film is very crisp, clear, and completely acceptable.  The film is also presented in it's original widescreen ratio which is quite refreshing after seeing it in pan and scan format on broadcast tv for many years.For what you get the price of the dvd is also very reasonable.  Well done Olive.  keep these rare, quality releases coming!It's about time this classic William Castle scifi thriller from the 60s had was released!  This film should appeal to film buffs of 60sc scifi flicks a well as fans of Irwin Allen as there is alot in this film that was borrowed from IA including the style of SFX to the tech hardware used in the movie.  For me this film is a must have and I never expectedto see it released on dvd let alone Blu Ray.I'll update my review with a rating on the quality and technical aspects of this release when I recieve it.",5,It's About Time!!!,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1078,"['UPDATE', 'Now', 'ahve', 'received', 'blu', 'ray', 'here', 'brief', 'review', 'actual', 'quality', 'disc', 'are', 'now', 'bonus', 'features', 'bare', 'bones', 'release', 'must', 'comment', 'Olive', 'Films', 'quality', 'film', 'age', 'film', 'very', 'crisp', 'clear', 'completely', 'acceptable', 'film', 'also', 'presented', 'original', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'seeing', 'pan', 'scan', 'format', 'broadcast', 'tv', 'many', 'years.For', 'what', 'get', 'price', 'dvd', 'also', 'very', 'reasonable', 'Well', 'done', 'Olive', 'keep', 'rare', 'quality', 'releases', 'coming', 'time', 'classic', 'William', 'Castle', 'scifi', 'thriller', '60s', 'had', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'should', 'appeal', 'film', 'buffs', '60sc', 'scifi', 'flicks', 'well', 'fans', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'alot', 'film', 'was', 'borrowed', 'IA', 'including', 'style', 'SFX', 'tech', 'hardware', 'used', 'movie', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'never', 'expectedto', 'see', 'released', 'dvd', 'let', 'alone', 'Blu', 'Ray.I', ""'ll"", 'update', 'review', 'rating', 'quality', 'technical', 'aspects', 'release', 'when', 'recieve']",N/A

Smith ""JThree""","[0, 0]","Ok. &#34;Project X&#34; is not a deep, philosophical film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is fun and not particularly as violent as today's films.I enjoyed the film. I saw it when it was on the CBS Late Night Movie years ago. Probably that's why the film aroused my curiosity when I had the chance to view it as an adult.The plot is somewhat a mishmash. Set about a hundred years in the future, Christopher George stars as a futuristic secret agent who has lost his memory (due to an amnesia inducing drug that was given to him if he was tortured) and the far-out and totally hysterical plan by a group of scientists (led by Henry Jones) to recover the secrets George's character lost. And, of course, the safety of the world depends on it.The late Henry Jones, a sixties and seventies TV and film star, was a far better actor than given credit for. Granted, he was never the &#34;star,&#34; but he was a fine supporting player who really brought a great performance to what ever TV and movie production he was working on.The sixties elements are in fine form here; the psychedelic opening credits, the animation, the cheesy human brain in a transparent globe, the outlandish outfits. They all scream the sixties.I didn't realize until recently this was a William Castle production. But now that I know, it's so obvious.  But I still find it more original with some of its ideas than more contemporary films.Hey! If we're tortured and we lose our memory, let's all be reprogrammed with a new identity and personality and given a beautiful new wife.  Who cares about our former lives and family?
