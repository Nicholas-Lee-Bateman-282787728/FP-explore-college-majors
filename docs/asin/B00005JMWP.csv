Is there a connection between them? (Is the height of 5'10"" average?) Then a woman goes to the police, she has seen her dangerous son. The Montreal police have sent for an expert; she gives her opinions about the killer (profiling). Then there is a fresh killing with a witness. The police question the witness about the murder. [Is there corroboration?] A tip brings them to a suspect's empty apartment. But is it empty? More leads turn up and have to be investigated. One involves exhuming a body, the bones testify to an identity. Special Agent Scott discovers a clue about the killer, and theorizes what caused the murders.Will the trap set by the police catch the killer? If it fails will they try again? There is a very dramatic scene and a chase that seems too clever. The plan to send the witness away goes awry. The scenes seem incredible, as if the story was changed for dramatic action. [But the time element says there is more to this story.] We soon learn about the shocking surprise to this story. The chase is on again. Can they find a needle in the haystack? Agent Scott leaves for a new life. [Believable?] There is another shocking surprise at the end of this story. [Credible to you?]A better plot, less overly complicated and more believable, would make a better film.

622871,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JMWP,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","Angelina Jolie dives headfirst into the role of FBI Agent Scott called upon by the Canadian police to help them investigate a series of murders.  What begins as a normal homicide, eventually turns dark as a witness by the name of Costa (Ethan Hawke) is found at the scene of the latest murder.  Claiming to have seen the murderer, Costa becomes the only witness the in this bizarre story.  Everything turns upside down as Jolie investigates the possibility of a ""chameleon"" killer, one that takes the body of another and lives the life they have built.  As her hunt develops, she draws an attraction to Costa that will blur her image of reality.  This seemingly innocent relationship will cause Scott to realize that emotions and crime fighting do not mesh.  Keifer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, and Olivier Martinez finish out the rest of the case of this superbly filmed, poorly acted, and choppy story known as Taking Lives.This is one of those classic cases of amazing cinematography, but sterile story.  It is obvious from the opening scene that DJ Caruso has the ability to capture the obscure and translate it to the screen, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for his ability to lead the actors.  This could have been a very stylish thriller, but instead if falls very short because the actors do not have a leader to guide them.  Jolie's character is never fully developed or explained as we watch her do everything from sleep in graves to eat her Cheerios with pictures of corpses.  Why does she do this?  It is never detailed or explained anywhere in this film.  She is the best in her class with cases like this, yet she continually slips up and causes errors that push the police further and further away.  It is inconsistencies like this that made me question the plausible nature of her character.Hawke wears his character's shoes well, but he gives too much away.  Sutherland is lost and Rowlands seemed to be reading her lines from cue cards off-screen.  Combine this amateurish acting with a sloppy script that never quite peaks at any moment and you have Taking Lives.  I wanted so much more from this film due to the caliber of the actors, but they seemed to just walk through their parts.  I needed stronger direction from a leader that seemed to just sit back and relax instead of create art.  Nothing seemed to fit, and eventually it all fell apart.Grade:  *  out of **** (due to the cinematography)",2,He would kill to be you.,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2425,"['Angelina', 'Jolie', 'headfirst', 'role', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Scott', 'called', 'upon', 'Canadian', 'police', 'help', 'investigate', 'series', 'murders', 'What', 'normal', 'homicide', 'eventually', 'dark', 'witness', 'name', 'Costa', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'found', 'scene', 'latest', 'murder', 'Claiming', 'have', 'seen', 'murderer', 'Costa', 'only', 'witness', 'bizarre', 'story', 'Everything', 'upside', 'down', 'Jolie', 'possibility', 'chameleon', 'killer', 'one', 'body', 'life', 'have', 'built', 'hunt', 'develops', 'attraction', 'Costa', 'will', 'blur', 'image', 'reality', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'relationship', 'will', 'cause', 'Scott', 'realize', 'emotions', 'crime', 'fighting', 'do', 'not', 'mesh', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'finish', 'out', 'rest', 'case', 'superbly', 'filmed', 'poorly', 'acted', 'choppy', 'story', 'known', 'Taking', 'Lives.This', 'one', 'classic', 'cases', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'sterile', 'story', 'obvious', 'opening', 'scene', 'DJ', 'Caruso', 'ability', 'capture', 'obscure', 'translate', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'ability', 'lead', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'instead', 'falls', 'very', 'short', 'actors', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'leader', 'guide', 'Jolie', 'character', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'explained', 'watch', 'do', 'everything', 'sleep', 'graves', 'eat', 'Cheerios', 'pictures', 'corpses', 'Why', 'do', 'never', 'detailed', 'explained', 'anywhere', 'film', 'best', 'class', 'cases', 'yet', 'continually', 'up', 'errors', 'push', 'police', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'inconsistencies', 'made', 'question', 'plausible', 'nature', 'character.Hawke', 'character', 'shoes', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Sutherland', 'lost', 'Rowlands', 'seemed', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'cue', 'cards', 'off-screen', 'Combine', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'sloppy', 'script', 'never', 'quite', 'peaks', 'moment', 'have', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'due', 'caliber', 'actors', 'seemed', 'just', 'walk', 'parts', 'needed', 'stronger', 'direction', 'leader', 'seemed', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'instead', 'create', 'art', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'fit', 'eventually', 'fell', 'apart.Grade', '*', '****', 'due', 'cinematography']",N/A

Perhaps it's time to add, ""Film murder mysteries are Canadian.""  Test this theory out sometime.  The next time you're watching an alleged thriller and find yourself checking to see if Reno 911 is on, look carefully for telltale signs of Canadian-ism.  Casual flipping back and forth between French and English?  An uncomfortably high number of ice hockey references?  Back bacon omnipresent?  If your thriller has had a thrill-ectomy, chances are good it's flying a maple leaf flag.As with comedy, cliff diving, and juggling machetes - thrillers live or die with timing.  Canadian thrillers almost invariably use 10 beats where 4 would have been too many and 2 not quite enough.  Dramatic tension, creepiness, and anxiety must be cared for and nourished, like pets, if one expects them to survive the long fallow periods separating gruesome revelations.  Take a movie like Seven, for instance - almost a textbook example of perfect timing and the gradual escalation of anxiety until it reaches unbearable extremes.  If 7 is a 10, Taking Lives is a 4 in the timing department.The biggest disappointment of this film is that it squanders a very interesting idea.  The killer sheds identities like snakeskins, taking over the lives of his victims, moving sequentially through an ongoing chain of assumed personalities.  This is a fascinating psychological profile, way above average for films of this genre.  It would have been very interesting to see more of what this involved as our killer grew into the shoes of various people.  (You will never again be able to hear the phrase, ""Hey, I just noticed we're about the same height,"" in the same way.)  Unfortunately the story is told primarily from the perspective of Angelina Jolie, an American FBI profiler brought in specially for the case because all the Canadian profilers went moose hunting that week.This movie is not bad, but it's not good either.  The location is often underutilized and even misrepresented.  Ethan Hawke is good enough; Kiefer Sutherland sticks around long enough to pick up his check, and it's a pleasure to see the great Gena Rowlands, or what's left of her.  Taking Lives is dressy to watch and has the requisite number of plot twists, albeit improbable ones.  It's good enough to be entertaining.  But as far as being a thriller goes, be prepared to get your thrills at about the same pace as maple syrup descends from the lip of an earthenware jug.",3,Killing Time,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2558,"['old', 'expression', 'Hell', 'chefs', 'are', 'English', 'engineers', 'are', 'Italian', 'comedians', 'are', 'Swiss', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'add', 'Film', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'are', 'Canadian', 'Test', 'theory', 'sometime', 'next', 'time', ""'re"", 'watching', 'alleged', 'thriller', 'find', 'checking', 'see', 'Reno', '911', 'look', 'carefully', 'telltale', 'signs', 'Canadian-ism', 'Casual', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'French', 'English', 'uncomfortably', 'high', 'number', 'ice', 'hockey', 'references', 'Back', 'bacon', 'omnipresent', 'thriller', 'had', 'thrill-ectomy', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'flying', 'maple', 'leaf', 'flag.As', 'comedy', 'cliff', 'diving', 'juggling', 'machetes', 'thrillers', 'live', 'die', 'timing', 'Canadian', 'thrillers', 'almost', 'invariably', 'use', '10', 'beats', 'where', '4', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', '2', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'Dramatic', 'tension', 'creepiness', 'anxiety', 'must', 'be', 'cared', 'nourished', 'pets', 'one', 'survive', 'long', 'fallow', 'periods', 'separating', 'gruesome', 'revelations', 'Take', 'movie', 'Seven', 'instance', 'almost', 'textbook', 'example', 'perfect', 'timing', 'gradual', 'escalation', 'anxiety', 'unbearable', 'extremes', '7', '10', 'Taking', 'Lives', '4', 'timing', 'department.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', 'killer', 'identities', 'snakeskins', 'taking', 'over', 'lives', 'victims', 'moving', 'sequentially', 'ongoing', 'chain', 'assumed', 'personalities', 'fascinating', 'psychological', 'profile', 'way', 'average', 'films', 'genre', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'involved', 'killer', 'grew', 'shoes', 'various', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'phrase', 'Hey', 'just', 'noticed', ""'re"", 'same', 'height', 'same', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'told', 'primarily', 'perspective', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'American', 'FBI', 'profiler', 'brought', 'specially', 'case', 'Canadian', 'profilers', 'went', 'moose', 'hunting', 'week.This', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'location', 'often', 'underutilized', 'even', 'misrepresented', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'good', 'enough', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'sticks', 'long', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'check', 'pleasure', 'see', 'great', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'what', 'left', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'dressy', 'watch', 'requisite', 'number', 'plot', 'twists', 'improbable', 'ones', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'entertaining', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'thriller', 'be', 'prepared', 'get', 'thrills', 'same', 'pace', 'maple', 'syrup', 'descends', 'lip', 'earthenware', 'jug']",N/A

622875,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JMWP,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[0, 0]","Let me start by saying I enjoyed this movie, and think it is one of the better murder/mystery/whodunnit style thrillers of late. Angelie Jolie smoulders less than usual, and is believable as an FBI specialist brought in to help solve a serial killer case in Canada, after the local police chief gets nowhere. Her arrival brings some hostility from one of the local officers, but gradually she works her way to help try and solve the case. I'm not going to spoil the movie, which has one or two good twists, and several scary unexpected moments, including a truly eye popping introductory five minutes. All that said, I found the plot a little too transparent, and the target audience who have probably seen many similar movies, will probably feel the same. The Director tries to throw plenty of red herrings in the mix along the way, but most of the story was all too apparent from about 20 minutes into the picture. Sadly the necessary ""weaknesses"" of the otherwise stalwart female agent have to be played out, along with an obligatory sex scene, which really adds nothing - and the final part of the movie though tense, is overly contrived. Probably good for a couple of repeat viewings, despite knowing the ending, this is a good but not great effort. Some nice extra's on the DVD round out the package, and Jolie fans will probably clamour to get this in their collection.

622876,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B00005JMWP,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[1, 1]","A strange movie to give thumbs up or down. Another in the genere of totally over the top killer movies. Is there like a ""serial killer school"" where they go to invent increasingly elaborate plots to kill? Angelea Jolie is very good as an FBI agent in Qubec on the trail of a serial murder there.  Although you wonder why she is the only one? Eventually a prime suspect falls into her lap but she discounts him for what sound like very good reasons, but the audience is dubious. The rest of the thriller is standard form thriller with red herrings thrown in for good measure.A big red herring involves what looked to be a very sexist FBI when Jolie sleeps with someone in the investigation and is fired, I was annoyed and thought was totally sexist. How many cops have slept with suspects over the years? In the end this plays into the climax twist so that made me happy but annoyed that the so smart killer didn't question the FBI firing Jolie for that.The final twist is preposterous but in a way I liked it. It was a totally new twist on capturing the serial killer and one that could not have been achieved without a woman, and without the woman investigator having sex with the suspect. Both of which are usually considered ""disasterous errors"" on the part of the woman in a man's world of crime investigation. But Jolie's character seemingly turned a disaster into a positive and I did like that.

622879,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JMWP,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","`Taking Lives', a serial killer thriller in the same vein as `Seven' has several successful surprises, two really good performances, and a little homage to the granddaddy of all thrillers, with music to match, but it just doesn't quite pull off it's biggest surprise.For starters, the cast contributes much to the story. Angelina Jolie is true to her role, with no taste of her puffy lipped persona from the Laura Croft movies or even her similar bad girl loving excitement role in `Gone in 60 Seconds'. She plays the very intuitive, very professional, yet very vulnerable FBI criminal profiler assisting Quebec police in finding a serial killer whose crimes, it turns out, span close to 20 years. She even succeeds in making us believe a Canadian province would go south of the border for help with a local criminal case, and get such a fragile agent to assist in an international case.Ethan Hawke is spectacular in the lead male role of Quebec art gallery manager who is an eyewitness to the serial killer's latest attack. I keep seeing Matt Damon or Brad Pitt in this role, as I keep seeing Ethan Hawke doing a better job than I believe either of these contemporary stars could pull off. It is Hawke's role that drives the action in over 80% of the movie. And, it is not due to any weakness in his performance that the movie gives away its big surprise earlier than it would have liked.The giveaway is partly based on the casting of highly recognizable Keifer Sutherland in the role of suspect. He first appears in what I must believe to be a scene that is an homage to the first appearance of Orson Wells as Harry Lime in the great 1940s thriller `The Third Man'. As we are doomed to be able to think outside the movie, seeing a well-known actor in what turns out to be a minor role is a dead giveaway that while this character is an obvious suspect, he is probably not the true perp. The casting is done to lend weight to the role to throw us off the scent.Another casting which helps give away the surprise is Gena Rowlands as the mother of the perp (?) victim. You don't cast this high powered talent in a minor role if you don't plan to have it play an important part in revealing the secret of the movie. One review even went so far as to say that even in this minor role, Ms. Rowlands practically steals the movie out from under the noses of the leads.I was especially happy to see Tcheky Karyo cast as the Quebec police captain who requests Jolie's services from the FBI. I suspect he has been making a good living in French and Canadian films over the past few years, but I have not seen him since his role in the knockout French action film `La Femme Nikita'. Like the two detectives working on the case, it was really good to see genuine French speaking actors cast in the roles of French speaking policemen. The two lesser policemen were acted well, but I confess they did not have enough dialogue for me to distinguish one from the other, especially with their matching black leather jackets, short black hair, and George Cloony shadow.In spite of giving away the big surprise a little too early in the game, there are several minor surprises that succeed in having you jump out of your seat. But, it is the script that, in the end fails to support the suspense.There were a few things that offended my sense of tidiness in story lines. There is a search of the Rowlands' character's house that yields a major if cheap surprise, with practically no explanation of what the FBI agent found there. Another thing which was very confusing was the fact that the action appears to take place in the city of Montreal, yet several important scenes occur in Quebec city, obvious from the appearance of the Hotel Fontenac, and there is little explanation of the relation of the action in the two cities except for the fact that the Rowlands character is being hidden away from the perp by being boarded in the famous four star hotel.This is the second or third movie I have seen recently with score done by major classical composer Philip Glass. I confess the score seemed to give less to this movie than Howard Shore's memorable music contributed to `Lord of the Rings', but then, this is not an epic fantasy. Let's just say Glass did not come up to the level of the memorable music in `The Third Man'. I might also mention that the chase scene in this movie also did not come close to matching the drama of `The Third Man' chase through the sewers of Vienna.I hope I have not given too much away, because there is plenty of suspense to go around in this movie. Especially effective is the scene where Jolie's weaknesses get the better of her.Very good thriller.Not a lot of extras on the DVD.

Her unique skills is used to the vexing case of this unknown murderer. COSTA (played by Ethan Hawke) is the killer's next alleged victim. Illeana's only suspect is CHRISTOPHER HART (played by Kiefer Sutherland).

It features some beautiful Quebec City locations (although the producers set the film in Montreal), a killer with a gruesome, obsessive M.O., and the always lovely Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately, it also features an incoherent script designed mainly to get its audience to jump every five minutes. Angelina Jolie's given nothing to do but act alternately icy and eerie as an American detective sent to Canada to catch a serial killer.This could have been a fun popcorn movie despite the flaws listed above. Unfortunately, ""Taking Lives"" veers into truly offensive territory in an attempt to keep the shocks coming. Jolie's supposedly brilliant detective character not only behaves stupidly, but is professionally demeaned and degraded by her superiors. I was very disappointed that after having a strong female character outlined in the opening scenes of the film, the producers, writers, and directors would reduce her to the level of an immature brat. There's an even more offensive moment towards the end of the film, in which we get to witness simulated violence against a pregnant character. This is totally out of line for what was previously an eerie, lightweight thriller.Ironically, ""Taking Lives"" is also very forgettable. Almost nothing about the film is memorable.If you'd really like to see Quebec City on DVD, buy a travel video.

I know a lot of you will probably buy the movie just for that reason, but looking past that, you will find a good, but predictable, thriller.Angelina Jolie plays a FBI detective assigned to a serial killer case in Canada. In 1983 the a young man killed another young man on a country road, made it look like his own death, and took the other man's identity. He then lives that identity for awhile and then starts the cycle over again. For twenty years the police can't seem to catch him. That is where Jolie's character comes in. Ethan Hawke plays a man that says he witnessed the killer doing his thing on his last victim. He works very closely with the police and Jolie's character. Along the way we run into Kiefer Sutherland's mysterious and creepy character. Basically this is a ""who-dunit"" movie where you try to figure out who the killer is before the movie finally shows you. That's where the problem is with the flick.I guessed the killer long before the movie revealed it. The movie started off really good. Sure it's a rip off of ""Se7en"", but it was a good one. Even the opening credits are a complete rip off of ""Se7en""'s opening. Through the first hour of the film, you are intrigued by the storyline & the characters. Then toward the end of the movie, it falls into a trap of absurdity. The moment you see the scene where someone dies in an elevator, you will say to yourself....""What the $#%@?"". I still think this is a good movie, but it could have been so much better. I don't really think it was the director's (DJ Caruso) fault as much as it was the script.The acting is pretty good though. Jolie carries most of the movie on her back. I have always liked her as an actress and she does a good job here. Hawke plays his role pretty well, too. Oliver Martinez, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hugues, Gina Rowlands, & Kiefer Sutherland round out the cast. Sutherland's character is particularly frustrating, because we don't see very much of him. He is only in the movie for about 10 min. and it's a shame. I hate seeing that good of an actor wasted like this.I really liked ""Taking Lives"" through the first 3/4 of the movie. Toward the end, it unravels and it's a shame. What could have been a very memorable movie like ""Se7en"", turns out to be a good, but not great knock-off of that outstanding thriller.Special Features: The special features here are pretty good, though. There are 4 featurettes about the making of the film. They are all decent and longer than I thought they would be. The gag reel is watchable as well. I have always loved seeing these put on DVD's.

Packed to the hilt with cheap thrills and unnecessary horror, its the story of an FBI agent (Angelina Jolie) who goes after a serial killer in Eastern Canada. Going from plain strange to outright weird, this serial killer has been going around for twenty years assuming the identities of the people he kills. Ethan Hawke is a young art dealer who appears to be the killer's next victim, and Kiefer Sutherland has a brief moment in the spotlight, whose appearance seems completely off-the-wall. Who is he? The movie never quite makes this clear until quite a ways through.  On-the-spot sex between the two lead characters doesn't make Taking Lives any better, either.While the psychological stuff is, I admit, fascinating, there's too much of the grotesque about this movie to make even so much as plausible. There's a lot of this that doesn;t make sense. Why is a US FBI agent dealing with a crime that seems routine enough (to begin with), in Canada? And why on earth is she crawling around in empty basements by herself? This tough I-can-do-anything attitude will get he in trouble in the end. Angelina Jolie's character is too cocky, too sure of herself, leading her to make some serious mistakes.

The roles/films she has chosen have simply not been very good, and 'Taking Lives' is a prime example.  It is a gory, derivative mess of a film.The plot is essentially 'a young man grows to adulthood murdering other men to adopt their lives'.  He (Ethan Hawke) finds men who are serial wanderers (no pun intended) who conveniently have no friends or family - really - then murders them in a most vicious fashion.  He then 'assumes' their identity until he fancies someone else.  Apparently the Montreal, Quebec police are too incompetent to figure this out, so they need Jolie's FBI agent to essentially perform the investigation for them.  The Jolie character then proceeds to fall in love with the 'witness' to one of the murders - another instance where the woman cannot be in a film without falling in love with someone.  This blew the movie out of the water for me.The story is a direct derivation of two films: 'Silence of the Lambs' (female FBI agent), and 'Seven' (dark, ugly sets, gore, and general feeling of depression), both of which were done far better than this film.  It's not that hard to figure out that the Ethan Hawke character is the culprit within the first hour of the film, even though the scriptwriters try to throw curves at the viewer to heighten the 'suspense'.The gore is extreme.  There are faces smashed in with rocks, stabbings, beatings and decapitations, all depicted in graphic detail.  There is also the obligatory morgue/autopsy scene (again clearly lifted from 'Lambs').I cannot recommend this film; it is simply too derivative and stereotypical.  It disrepects Angelina Jolie's FBI agent character by having her get romantically involved with a witness in a murder case (another cliche that already been done elsewhere).  The extra feature sections then proceed to behave as if the film is a marvelously original creation.

The story opens with an incident that we later discover is a modus operandi for a serial killer.  The twins, sons of mother played be Gena Rowlands,  are not exactly identified until the latter part of the movie.  But in a boating 'accident' one of the twins (the good one of course) was killed by the other twin.  Since that time the surviving twin has usurped the identity and lives of his victims, making for an interesting mystery as to who the real twin is.  To investigate this Canadian murder spree comes Angelina Jolie, who has a history that is a bit dark herself. The other detectives are well played by Olivier Martinez and Tcheky Karyo.  One of the intended next victims is an art dealer (Ethan Hawke) who seems to fear and suspect Kiefer Sutherland for reasons unclear.  Stir this serial killer mystery pot and you come up with some pretty convincing chases, lethally ugly murders, and steamy sex.  In all, Angelina Jolie is fairly on target as the FBI gal, playing with more understated acting than her recent films.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[47, 56]","""Taking Lives"" stars Angelina Jolie as FBI profiler Illeana Scott who is assigned to Montreal, and the case of a particularly vicious serial murderer. The killer has been taking lives for 20 years, since his teens, assuming his victims' identities with each crime. There's a line in the movie to the effect that he's ""like a hermit crab - when he grows out of his shell, (home), he moves on."" OK! So it's not brilliant dialogue, but until we reach the film's halfway mark it is forgivable. After the 1st hour, or so, this scary, chiller-thriller loses its edge in a serious way. The last scenes are really contrived - just not believable by any stretch of the imagination.Jolie is her usual sexy self as the loner, fast-track agent from Washington, DC. She is welcomed by her old friend and colleague, Captain Hugo Leclair, (Tch&eacute;cky Karyo), of the Montreal Sret&eacute;, but is resented by macho detective Paquette, (Olivier Martinez), who is handsome in a surly kinda way. Illeana's approach to crime solving is extremely intuitive and unconventional, to say the least - but her unorthodox methods get results, and this case is no different. She quickly comes up with some leads that her Canadian counterparts have missed. Then art gallery owner James Costa, (Ethan Hawke), an actual murder witness, steps in to help the detectives. Costa, who has some artistic talent, is able to sketch the suspect. The hunt picks up speed, and the plot begins to twist, turn and occasionally surprise. I had at least one major scare! There's a decent car chase, a steamy love scene, (super steamy in the Director's Cut), and an unusual take on Illeana's character - all pluses.The cast is excellent.

Jolie overexposed there is no redeeming aspect of spending the time watching this mis-fire of a movie. Too bad, because it could'a would'a been pretty OK with a little more thoughtful editing of the screenplay. The holes in this plot are way too numerous & obvious to list (plus would be considered Spoilers by anyone who watches it in spite of all these negative reviews.) But the one that really killed it for us was having the female lead (supposedly a very intelligent & professional top FBI agent) literally jump on the male lead, having never so much as touched each other - not even a kiss - nor generating any believable chemistry/tension between the characters. (Is that supposed to make it ""hot?"" Thumbs down.) Plus, if she was such a good Agent, she'd have known the truth about him already & never gone there. By that point it was already obvious... The mostly indiscernible muttering of the French-Canadien English-speaking policemen didn't help either. Looking for a REAL good thriller? 'Seven' is obvious, 'Fargo' is another.

So...Flashback two hours earlier to the beginning of the movie ""Taking Lives"" (a very pregnant title):The kid on the bus is just so pitiful--shaggy hair, thick glasses, hang-dog look, a sure target of a serial killer, if one happens to be on the bus. (Because this is a movie about a serial killer, that scenario will likely happen.) The bus blows a tire, the kid and the friendly guy taking the seat next to him buy a dilapidated old car, and off they go. The car also blows a tire. Then the viewer gets to witness just how the serial killer uses an opportunity to his advantage to take another life, both literally and metaphorically.Angelina Jolie with her Dolly Parton lips (over-sized--if those are her born-with-them lips, I apologize, but I suspect she supersizes them) is an FBI profiler and long-time friend of the department chief in Montreal where the body from the opening scene is found. He invites her onto the case.The killer's favorite ruse is to smash his victim's face, among other horrifics he inflicts, and take his identity. The viewer learns later why this identity theft is a psychological necessity.When Ethan Hawke's character, an art gallery owner, is brought in for questioning--he actually sees the alleged murderer--the question becomes: Is he the serial killer? Jolie's character shows why he isn't.Stop. That's the first hour, the good hour, when the viewer thinks the film may reach classic proportions, when Hawke's character is released.Most other reviewers will tell you why this movie dies from a wrong turn. I think it dies because the viewer is forced in the second hour to watch Jolie with her mouth hanging open, a technique she seems to favor because it is there in all her movies.If you find my reason biased and repugnant, how about the implausibility of the contrived sex scene between an agent and a cleared suspect. OK, sex happens--maybe not so implausibly. Still, a question. Kiefer Sutherland is a suspect. He dies in a kidnapping accident. How convenient that he should die exactly at this point. There should be a question here.That's how the second hour goes--questions are raised, but not in the proper context and not the right questions about the right things.Gena Rowland plays the killer's mean-spirited mother, allowing the viewer a look into the neglected, destroyed heart of a killer, son of an emotional killer. Rowland inhabits that role.While initially presenting a truly promising and very dark story, ""Taking Lives"" also takes the viewer on a death trip of sorts, that of a trip to disappointment.

The marketing for this movie seemed  to give away any surprises that could possibly be in this movie.  It appeared that the villain was going to be Keifer Sutherland (no surprise there), Angelina would team up with Ethan Hawke and solve the crime, and then the movie would end and the audience would be left feeling like ""been there, seen that"".  However, this movie is thoroughly entertaining, and has plenty of twists to keep you wondering just what exactly is going on.I can't tell you much about this movie without ruining some plot points, but I can give a semi-rough outline of the film.  The basic premise of ""Taking Lives"" is that someone is murdering people and then leaving a corpse that cannot be easily identified, then steals their I.D. and any credit cards or whatever, and assumes their identity.  So to solve the crime, the authorities bring in a forensics expert (Angelina Jolie) to solve the crime.The movie is an excellent thrill ride that surpasses expectations.  A great story, that is wonderfully acted by all of the stars.  Keifer Sutherland and Ethan Hawke are great in their supporting roles, giving depth and credibility to their respective roles.  Ethan plays an artist, which he fits the look perfectly and Keifer is a suspicious art dealer, and Keifer always does great with shifty characters.Basically, if you're in the mood for a great thrill ride, then ""Taking Lives"" is the movie for you, I recommend the unrated version, simply because it's a personal preference of mine that anytime a movie has an unrated version, then that's the one to see, because you are seeing the movie as it was intended to be.""Taking Lives: Unrated"" contains violence, language, grisly images, and sexuality/nudity.",5,Superbly Crafted Thriller...,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1840,"['When', 'watching', 'previews', 'movie', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'marketing', 'movie', 'seemed', 'give', 'away', 'surprises', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'movie', 'appeared', 'villain', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'surprise', 'there', 'Angelina', 'would', 'team', 'up', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'solve', 'crime', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'been', 'there', 'seen', 'However', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'twists', 'keep', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'movie', 'ruining', 'plot', 'points', 'can', 'give', 'semi-rough', 'outline', 'film', 'basic', 'premise', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'someone', 'murdering', 'people', 'then', 'leaving', 'corpse', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'identified', 'then', 'I.D', 'credit', 'cards', 'whatever', 'identity', 'So', 'solve', 'crime', 'authorities', 'bring', 'forensics', 'expert', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'solve', 'crime.The', 'movie', 'excellent', 'thrill', 'ride', 'expectations', 'great', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'stars', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'giving', 'depth', 'credibility', 'respective', 'roles', 'Ethan', 'artist', 'look', 'perfectly', 'Keifer', 'suspicious', 'art', 'dealer', 'Keifer', 'always', 'great', 'shifty', 'characters.Basically', ""'re"", 'mood', 'great', 'thrill', 'ride', 'then', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'movie', 'recommend', 'unrated', 'version', 'simply', 'personal', 'preference', 'mine', 'movie', 'unrated', 'version', 'then', 'one', 'see', 'are', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'Unrated', 'contains', 'violence', 'language', 'grisly', 'images', 'sexuality/nudity']",N/A

Years ago Pauline Kael pronounced that ""By now Jane Fonda has become a complete reason for going to the movies"" (probably around the time of KLUTE) and it's been apparent for some time that Jolie is the spiritual descendant of Jane Fonda.  Think of them, each one the wild, tormented daughter of a great matinee idol with a cleancut image.  And neither one with a super great range, but both excellent at what they do: Jane was terrific at denoting ""modernity"" (to Kael, she carried forth Bette Davis' attitude of purring like a perfectly kept motor), while Jolie is all about being the ""wife's worst nightmare.""TAKING LIVES is only about one inch deep, and the trailer tells it all, but why not see it anyhow?  Either you're in thrall to her giant lips and long arms, her downcast gaze and humungous tattoos (here covered up for the most part)--or you're not.  Playing Ileanna Scott, ace FBI profiler in serial murders, isn't much of a stretch for Jolie, for nowadays all you have to do is immerse yourself in a room filled with horrid photos of the killer's crimes and then drift into a trance state where you become the killer; then you wake up gasping like a fish and you shout out, ""He uses toothpaste to sedate them!"" and everyone goes on the alert for Crest sales.Ileanna's pregnancy is a dilly especially watching the film in early 2006, a time of great world strife during which no magazine cover appears without a mention of Brad and Angelina's forthcoming baby.  One of the few shock moments of the movie involve a threat to Ileanna's baby, too gross to go into here.I remember during the filming of this movie the paparazzi caught a tender moment between Jolie, her son Maddox, and her French co-star here Olivier Martinez, best known for dating the Australian pop star Kylie Minogue.

(The Bone Collector, Kiss the Girls, Highwaymen, etc.)Now, I happen to be a sucker for these types of movies, but obviously, some are better than others. To me, usually it seems like alot of these movies arn't that original, which is ok because, lets face it, how many hollywood movies are these days? So alot of the time, the outcome of the movie depends on the cast, director, and other things not actually pertaining to the script itself. Now don't get me wrong, the plot of the movie is important, but usually thats not the deciding factor. In ""Taking Lives,"" the script isnt great. It's not a bad story, but its a little confusing and really takes way to many twists and turns. Not to mention, alot of it's been done many times before. However, the performance by the Angelina Jolie just takes the film to a whole other level. She is undoubtedly one of the best actresses around (despite her recent lack of movie choices. coughtombraider2cough) She propells the movie foreward and brings her own life to the character, rather than just playing the cardboard cut-out character we see in every other movie. The rest of the cast does a good job aswell. The direction was amazing and really brought you into the film and set the mood perfectly. Taking lives is not just another mainstream blockbuster, it's an entertaining movie, with all-around great performances by the cast and crew.Direction: AActing: AFun: BPlot: CSpecial Effects: B+Overall: B+Unrated: contains Scenes of pervasive violence, disturbing images, language and some sexual content/nudity",4,"Without Jolie, this film would just be an average thriller",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,1661,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'rush', 'serial', 'killer', 'thillers', 'invading', 'box', 'office', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'Highwaymen', 'etc', 'Now', 'happen', 'be', 'sucker', 'types', 'movies', 'obviously', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'usually', 'alot', 'movies', 'ar', ""n't"", 'original', 'ok', 'face', 'how', 'many', 'hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'days', 'So', 'alot', 'time', 'outcome', 'movie', 'cast', 'director', 'other', 'things', 'not', 'actually', 'pertaining', 'script', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'plot', 'movie', 'important', 'usually', 'not', 'deciding', 'factor', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'script', 'isnt', 'great', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'little', 'confusing', 'really', 'way', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'Not', 'mention', 'alot', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'However', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'just', 'film', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'recent', 'lack', 'movie', 'choices', 'coughtombraider2cough', 'movie', 'foreward', 'own', 'life', 'character', 'rather', 'just', 'playing', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'character', 'see', 'other', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'aswell', 'direction', 'was', 'amazing', 'really', 'brought', 'film', 'set', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'Taking', 'lives', 'not', 'just', 'mainstream', 'blockbuster', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'all-around', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'crew.Direction', 'AActing', 'AFun', 'BPlot', 'CSpecial', 'Effects', 'B+Overall', 'B+Unrated', 'contains', 'Scenes', 'pervasive', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'images', 'language', 'sexual', 'content/nudity']",N/A

The video press hasn't linked Hawke to Jolie -- as it has linked Brad Pitt to Jolie and tied the two to his divorce from Jennifer Aniston -- but the apparent smoldering chemistry between the two in this flick may or may not be real.About the movie ... it's something about a two decade old string of murders committed by a fanatic that then takes the identity of his victims. His mother sees him in town one day, goes to the cops, and begins a search that reveals him. A showdown with Jolie (badly portraying an FBI profiler) at the end of the flick may give some satisfaction to wounded female viewers. It didn't do much for me but my wife liked it.There are a couple scary scenes that may grab you but, for the most part, this movie is predicatable and bland. Hawke gets better later in the movie and Jolie is never very convincing as an FBI agent. She tries to downplay her model image but doesn't succeed. The best acting is turned in by a French Canadian cop from Montreal who looks like Hawke.So don't rush out to rent or buy this unless you really like one of the principals actors or are a completist of their work.

622933,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMWP,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","There are movies where what you really want to write is a critique and not a review, the key difference being that a review is written for those who have not seen a film and require you not to give the game away, whereas in a critique you know you are talking to those in the know.  With movies like ""The Crying Game,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Executive Decision,"" ""Memento,"" ""The Village,"" and the like you have to be circumspect with what you say.  You can say that you liked (or hated) the way in which you were fooled (or not), but the fact that you acknowledge being fooled is part of the game can be giving away too much and saying that ""Taking Lives"" set you up before you ever see the movie might be about as cryptic as you can get away with in this regard.At least with ""Taking Lives"" you know that we are dealing with a cat and mouse game between a serial killer and the FBI profiler, Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) trying to bring him to justice.  The title of the film has a double meaning because not only does this killer take the lives of his victim, as in making them dead rather that alive, but he also takes over their lives, assuming their identities until he becomes bored and moves on to his next victim.  That means that each of his victims is older than the previous ones, whose only real common denominator is that if and when they are found their identities are destroyed (e.g., hands are missing so no fingerprints).At this point I must digress.  The criminal trial of O.J. Simpson not only signaled the end of the paradigm by which science provided all answers, it gave common folk an education on DNA evidence.  I can remember watching ""Basic Instinct"" and knowing that even the forensic lab for the L.A.P.D. would be able to figure out from all the fluids found on the murder scene at the start of the film that Sharon Stone had been there.  So while watching ""Taking Lives"" I knew I was going to have to play along and pretend for the sake of the narrative that it is ""easy"" to make it impossible to identify a body.  But then look at all the times movies and television shows have people still trying to beat a trace when the telephone in your home can tell you the number that is calling you before you pick up the phone.The point is that movies like ""Taking Lives"" have their own internal logic.  They are going to try and fool us as well as the main characters and so we expect that, which becomes part of the equation for trying to fool us.  Part of the problem is that just because you are spinning through all the possible twists and turns the film might take you simply have to get some of them right by sheer luck.  Ultimately the big question becomes what makes watching the more movie enjoyable for you: going along for the ride or getting ahead of the game?This is actually a film where the hero might be more interesting than the villain.  To be a good profiler you have to be able to think in the same demented ways as the killers you are tracking, and Illeana Scott is pretty good at that.  When we first meeting her she is lying in an open grave.  You first thought is that she is just weird, but then she comes up with a couple of insightful deep thoughts that impress the Montreal cops she is helping with the case (we know that a lot of movies are filmed in Canada because it is cheaper so it is interesting to see one that admits to being there and picks Quebec so that the supporting characters can have French-Canadian accents).This is also one of those thrillers where the cop becomes emotionally involved with a witness, although with the gender reversals the femme fatale here is an art dealer named Costa (Ethan Hawke).  He might actually have seen the killer, interrupting him during his latest attempt at murder, which would be a pretty big break.  But the police also have another one when a Mrs. Asher (Gena Rowlands) show sup and insists that she has seen her son, who was supposedly killed in a traffic accident long ago and far away.  After years of getting only bits and pieces of evidence, things are coming to a head pretty fast for Illeana.There is always an attempt to give the cop in such stories additional personal burdens that come into play as they try to solve the crime.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is certainly a classic example of where that works, and ""Taking Lives"" has the same aspirations.  There is a nude scene involving Illeana and my daughter daughter asked if this was an old movie from earlier in Jolie's career as an explanation for why she was doing it, but the reason is that it speaks to the character she is playing.  The fact that she has strengths and flaws is reinforced by the two Canadian cops she is working with, one of who respects her work and the other who dismisses her as causing problems; to some degree, both are right.  The point here is not simply that in the end Illeana wins the game, but how she does so, which is the real purpose of the film's end game, and that our heroine can give as good as she gets.D.J. Caruso has directed a stylish thriller, with a script by Jon Bokenkamp based on the novel by Michael Pye.  I was surprised that this movie was only 109 minutes long (the director's cut is about six minutes longer than the theatrical release), because there is a lot happening in this film.  This was rather surprising because there are lots of shots of Jolie's eyes as he character is thinking deep thoughts and putting together the pieces.  So ""Taking Lives"" gets bonus points for being fast paced and we are back to the question of whether or not you will appreciate its twists and turns.  I have to think that few veiwers will not appreciate at least going along for the ride.",4,"Both ways of ""Taking Lives"" apply to this serial killer",1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,5695,"['are',

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","I suspect that if you sum all the movies about serial killers that you would have more movies than there either are or perhaps ever have been serial killers.  ""Taking Lives"" is just one more variation on a theme that starts with a lot of potential, but ultimately collapses under its own weight.Illeana (Angelina Jolie) is an FBI agent with special talents as a profiler.  A Canadian police department asks Illeana to assist in a murder investigation.  The activity revolves around Costa (Ethan Hawke), apparently the killer's next victim.  If you have seen any of the numerous movies in this genre, you can already guess many of the elements.  There will be resentment of Illeana by someone in the Canadian police department.  There will be attempted mis-direction as to who the actual killer is.  There will be at least one action scene involving the killer somewhere about halfway or two-thirds of the way through the movie.  The final showdown with the killer will require Illeana's involvement, whether it is truly necessary or not.  If you had guessed many of these elements, you probably could have written the plot.For fans of ""CSI,"" a number of the events in this movie just seem at least implausible, if not absurd.  I admit that a person could cover up one crime scene, but the number of scenes and people involved over a decade and a half would seem to admit itself of a mistake somewhere.  Also, the end scene was completely absurd and I was guessing answers to questions before they were asked.In fairness to the movie, I liked two things about the movie.  The logic behind the serial killer's murders was intriguing.  However, his ability to get away with multiple murders was absurd.  There was a scene on a train where you could see what the serial killer was doing, and had I been the person he was talking to I would have been offended and excused myself from his presence.  The other scene I liked was where the killer attacked Illeana.  I knew it was going to happen, but I still jumped when it did happen.  That particular scene is my favorite from the movie.  Since I only had one favorite scene, it is easy to spot.This movie is like rice cereal.  It looks like a lot, but after eating a bowl of it you are left unfilled.  If you have an interest in movies about serial killers, then you should watch this one.  However, I recommend you rent it first before spending the money to buy it.  Either that or wait until it hits the bargain bins; I doubt it will take long to reach them.",3,Predictable Re-Tread,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2505,"['suspect', 'sum', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'movies', 'are', 'perhaps', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'serial', 'killers', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'variation', 'theme', 'lot', 'potential', 'ultimately', 'own', 'weight.Illeana', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'FBI', 'agent', 'special', 'talents', 'profiler', 'Canadian', 'police', 'department', 'Illeana', 'assist', 'murder', 'investigation', 'activity', 'Costa', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'apparently', 'killer', 'next', 'victim', 'have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'movies', 'genre', 'can', 'already', 'guess', 'many', 'elements', 'will', 'be', 'resentment', 'Illeana', 'someone', 'Canadian', 'police', 'department', 'will', 'be', 'attempted', 'mis-direction', 'who', 'actual', 'killer', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'action', 'scene', 'involving', 'killer', 'somewhere', 'halfway', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'final', 'showdown', 'killer', 'will', 'require', 'Illeana', 'involvement', 'truly', 'necessary', 'not', 'had', 'guessed', 'many', 'elements', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'plot.For', 'fans', 'CSI', 'number', 'events', 'movie', 'just', 'seem', 'least', 'implausible', 'not', 'absurd', 'admit', 'person', 'could', 'cover', 'up', 'one', 'crime', 'scene', 'number', 'scenes', 'people', 'involved', 'decade', 'half', 'would', 'seem', 'admit', 'mistake', 'somewhere', 'Also', 'end', 'scene', 'was', 'completely', 'absurd', 'was', 'guessing', 'answers', 'questions', 'were', 'asked.In', 'fairness', 'movie', 'liked', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'logic', 'serial', 'killer', 'murders', 'was', 'intriguing', 'However', 'ability', 'get', 'away', 'multiple', 'murders', 'was', 'absurd', 'was', 'scene', 'train', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'doing', 'had', 'been', 'person', 'was', 'talking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'excused', 'presence', 'other', 'scene', 'liked', 'was', 'where', 'killer', 'attacked', 'Illeana', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'still', 'jumped', 'when', 'did', 'happen', 'particular', 'scene', 'favorite', 'movie', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'favorite', 'scene', 'easy', 'spot.This', 'movie', 'rice', 'cereal', 'lot', 'eating', 'bowl', 'are', 'left', 'unfilled', 'have', 'interest', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'then', 'should', 'watch', 'one', 'However', 'recommend', 'rent', 'first', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'wait', 'bargain', 'doubt', 'will', 'take', 'long', 'reach']",N/A

A Hutter ""mahutter""","[2, 3]","Unless you are among the millions of people who cannot get enough of seeing Angelina Jolie naked, this movie is a complete waste of time.  The movie opens with a shameless rip-off of the opening sequence from 'Seven' (a brilliant film and possibly the best 'serial killer' film ever made).  Perhaps the director thought that if he opened with a sequence from a great movie, it would make his horrible, piece of crap movie less so.  But not even some borrowed brilliance from 'Seven' could improve the tired plot, embarrasingly predictable ending, and sub-par acting. I think Ethan Hawke has delivered some great performances (Gattaca, Training Day, Great Expectations) but his performance rises to the same level of his 'Taking Lives' cast members, which is to say somewhere between 'low' and 'very low'.  Angelina Jolie is nice to look at, but if she has some serious acting ability, I haven't seen it, and it certainly doesn't show up here.  The cast also boasts Gena Rowlands and Kiefer Sutherland in parts that were ultimately of no consequence and could/should have been played by just about any other actor.  Their casting is just as puzzling as to the reasons this film was made in the first place.  But the acting/casting of 'Taking Lives' is just a part of what made this such a terrible trainwreck of a movie.  As stated before the 'shocking ending' is 'shockingly predictable'. Unless you are 2 years old, mentally challenged (in a very severe way), or just incredibly stupid, the 'shocking ending' is made very apparent about 10 min. into the film. When working in such a diluted genre, such as the 'serial killer/thriller' genre, it may take a bit more on the part of the filmmaker to really make his work stand out.  But, even when grading on a curve, 'Taking Lives' gets a D at best.",1,Terrible! And terribly derivative!

It divided actors, directors, writers and craftsmen into either the `A' list or the `B' list. Those in the `A' list were giving the best projects and the biggest budgets. Those on the `B' were left basically to improvise. The list was fluid. One could move up or down as critical and boxoffice success dictated. Today, many of those `A' pictures are considered nearly un-watchable, but some on the old `B' list are now considered classics.I mention this system because today, with studios, it's all `A' list or bust. But talent, not having much changed in the last 50 years, remains either `A' list or `B' list. Thus, we have today many movies that are `B' list being sold as `A' list. ""Taking Lives"" is a case in point.While there is nothing at all that makes the movie special, in the old days it would have been regarded as a superior `B' or `programmer' flick.Here, we have the dame [Angelina Jolie] out to make a name for herself as a FBI special agent. She has a startling case in which a serial killer assumes the identity of his victims. She has the perfect eyewitness [Ethan Hawke]. She has the perfect foil [Oliver Martinez], the local detective.

I'm glad I did now, and was surprised when I didn't get yelled at for buying it :)This film has a very strange, and very OTT storyline, and not much of it makes sense to a person who only bought the film to see her favourite actress Angelina. I was quite shocked at the start of it to discover, that the wee geeky guy from Girl Next Door, Paul Dano. (Who's quite a nice looking guy when he takes his glasses off.) The film starts with him befriending a guy, and then pushing him in front of a truck. It snowballs from there.What puzzled me most about this film, is the lack of decent characters in it. OK, Angelina was fabulous as ever, and actually suited her character, of someone who's kinda psychic, and can see what happened to dead people etc. Oliver Martinez & Ethan Hawke were horribly miscast, and just plain horrible too. I just don't find French accents sexy (despite the fact that most of the time he had very little to say in the film), and is it just me, or does anyone else find Ethan Hawke very rat-like? Charming image I know. Kiefer Sutherland I thought suited the role he was in, I've only previously seen his blink-and-you'll-miss-him role in Phone Booth, and he comes across as that kinda guy - suitably creepy. (Haven't seen 24.)Angelina gets her kit off in this film, so if you want a good look at nearly everything, then guys, you'd better get this film. I dread to think how long she had to spend in makeup for this scene, to cover up her numerous tattoos that she has.Some say the finale of this film was a let down, to be honest, I didn't think so. Oh my GOD!!! The finale was in your face, and totally unexpected, and I couldn't believe what was happening. It made up for certain other points of the movie lacking, although I did jump out my seat at least 3 times, and screamed cos there are some scenes where you get such a fright.This is basically a must-see for any Angelina fans.

The befriended guy gets out to change the tire.  While he is doing so a truck is head towards them on the highway.  The other team looks at the truck and just as it is about to pass them, the teen shoves the tirechanger in front of the truck.  The truck hits the tirechanger and crashes.  The teen first checks that the trucker is dead then goes back to the tirechanger to ensure he is dead too.  He stirs and the teen finishes the job by smashing him in the face with a stone.

The killer is one who kills similar looking loner guys and then assumes their identities.  He repeats this each time he gets bored with the life he is leading.I don't want to give away the rest of the story because just about anything would be a spoiler, except the director seemed to make you think everything was wrapped up about halfway through the movie.

622945,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JMWP,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","I have no idea why this movie was on my Netflix list, but after watching all those Ashley Judd movies I figure Angelina Jolie deserves at least as much of a chance.Taking Lives is the usual FBI agent stalks the serial killer plot.  Pretty/creepy FBI agent, Illeana (Angelina Jolie) is a drop-dead hottie who wears a wedding ring to avoid men asking her out, turns down everyone who asks her out, and likes to sleep in graves to literally walk in the footsteps of her victims.  You see, Illeana is the best agent for this sort of case, and presumably anyone interested in catching a serial killer has to be a little strange herself.  This supposed brilliance almost never actually appears in the film, unless you count breathless close-ups of Illeana staring at pictures or laying in graves.Illeana is pursuing a serial killer.  This serial killer takes peoples' lives and lives in them, ""like a hermit crab.""  He looks for single men with few attachments who won't be missed for months at a time.  Why? Because his mother, Mrs. Asher (Gena Rowlands), believed her son killed his twin brother in a boating accident and kept him locked up in the basement for years at a time.  So our bad guy wants to live other peoples' lives because...he has really, really low self-esteem.  Sure, okay.For reasons that seem only to further muddle the plot, all this takes place in Canada.  There are several actors in Taking Lives who are most assuredly esteemed thespians in their home country but come off stilted, hostile, and apathetic when speaking English.  These angry Canadians are unhappy about an American taking over their case and they're not afraid to speak French around Illeana to let her know it.  They showed her!There are a multitude of problems with this film.  It has a really cool ending which doesn't make up for the plodding pace, the ridiculous plot twists, or the leaden acting.  Phillip Glass is not the composer for a neo-noir film that needs a dramatic, slow build - his music is too sweeping, too lighthearted, too commercial.  There's also a crazy violent sex scene that shows quite a bit of Jolie and seems to exist primarily to boost interest in the film at its nadir.Taking Lives performs more acrobatics than Illeana in the bedroom to convince us of its plot twists.  At one point, a supposedly dead character is propped up by the real bad guy to look like he's committing a crime.  Only the shot is CLEARLY of a living person holding a gun to the faux victim's head, and a flashback shows quite a different scene.  In other words, Taking Lives simply cheats to pull off its plot twist that we all saw coming  a mile away because there's no way the film is going to end in just an hour.With a subdued Jolie, a bizarre appearance by Kiefer Sutherland, lack of chemistry between the two leads, and a supporting cast that doesn't speak English as their first language, Taking Lives would make for a boring movie even if it were an action film.  As a slow-building drama it can barely stir to life.",2,Taking Time,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3012,"['have', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'Netflix', 'list', 'watching', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'movies', 'figure', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'least', 'much', 'chance.Taking', 'usual', 'FBI', 'agent', 'serial', 'killer', 'plot', 'Pretty/creepy', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Illeana', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'drop-dead', 'hottie', 'who', 'wedding', 'ring', 'avoid', 'men', 'asking', 'out', 'down', 'everyone', 'who', 'out', 'likes', 'sleep', 'graves', 'literally', 'walk', 'footsteps', 'victims', 'see', 'Illeana', 'best', 'agent', 'sort', 'case', 'presumably', 'anyone', 'interested', 'catching', 'serial', 'killer', 'be', 'little', 'strange', 'herself', 'supposed', 'brilliance', 'almost', 'never', 'actually', 'film', 'count', 'breathless', 'close-ups', 'Illeana', 'staring', 'pictures', 'laying', 'graves.Illeana', 'pursuing', 'serial', 'killer', 'serial', 'killer', 'peoples', 'lives', 'lives', 'hermit', 'crab', 'single', 'men', 'few', 'attachments', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'months', 'time', 'Why', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Asher', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'believed', 'son', 'killed', 'twin', 'brother', 'boating', 'accident', 'kept', 'locked', 'up', 'basement', 'years', 'time', 'So', 'bad', 'guy', 'live', 'other', 'peoples', 'lives', 'really', 'really', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'Sure', 'okay.For', 'reasons', 'seem', 'only', 'further', 'muddle', 'plot', 'place', 'Canada', 'are', 'several', 'actors', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'assuredly', 'esteemed', 'thespians', 'home', 'country', 'come', 'off', 'stilted', 'hostile', 'apathetic', 'when', 'speaking', 'English', 'angry', 'Canadians', 'are', 'unhappy', 'American', 'taking', 'over', 'case', ""'re"", 'not', 'afraid', 'speak', 'French', 'Illeana', 'let', 'know', 'showed', 'are', 'multitude', 'problems', 'film', 'really', 'cool', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'plodding', 'pace', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'twists', 'leaden', 'acting', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'not', 'composer', 'neo-noir', 'film', 'dramatic', 'slow', 'build', 'music', 'too', 'sweeping', 'too', 'lighthearted', 'too', 'commercial', 'also', 'crazy', 'violent', 'sex', 'scene', 'quite', 'bit', 'Jolie', 'exist', 'primarily', 'boost', 'interest', 'film', 'nadir.Taking', 'Lives', 'performs', 'more', 'acrobatics', 'Illeana', 'bedroom', 'convince', 'plot', 'twists', 'one', 'point', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'character', 'propped', 'up', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'look', 'committing', 'crime', 'Only', 'shot', 'CLEARLY', 'living', 'person', 'holding', 'gun', 'faux', 'victim', 'head', 'flashback', 'quite', 'different', 'scene', 'other', 'words', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'simply', 'cheats', 'pull', 'off', 'plot', 'twist', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'way', 'film', 'going', 'end', 'just', 'hour.With', 'subdued', 'Jolie', 'bizarre', 'appearance', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'first', 'language', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'would', 'make', 'boring', 'movie', 'even', 'were', 'action', 'film', 'slow-building', 'drama', 'can', 'barely', 'stir', 'life']",N/A

LeClaire (Tcheky Karyo) requests the assistance of FBI profiler Ileana Scott (Angelina Jolie) to solve the crime before more people die. Shortly after Special Agent Scott arrives, the killer strikes again, this time leaving a witness. An art dealer (Ethan Hawke) happened upon the scene just as the murderer was finishing off his victim. Using the description provided by the witness, Agent Scott and the Montreal detectives might be able to put aside their differences long enough to track down a serial murderer.""Taking Lives"" is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Pye. With its  charismatic lead actors and interesting supporting cast, -Tcheky Karyo and Olivier Martinez as Montreal police detectives, Gena Rowlands as the killer's mother, and Kiefer Sutherland- I expected a more engaging film. ""Taking Lives"" is just too predictable. We can see everything coming an hour away. Director D.J. Caruso has tried to include some interesting camera work, but it's so heavy-handed that it comes across as self-conscious. When a film is just uninteresting, oddities like French Canadian police officers conversing amongst themselves in English just make it worse. There is an interesting dynamic between Ethan Hawke's character, Jim, and Angelina Jolie's Ileana Scott. I wish ""Taking Lives"" had explored that more fully instead of falling back on a paint-by-numbers plot.The DVD: Bonus features include ""Crime Lab: A Taking Lives Documentary"", a 3-minute gag reel, and a theatrical trailer. ""Crime Lab"" is a 21-minute featurette in four parts. The first part introduces us to the various parties who collaborate on the film; the second part is about director D.J. Caruso's work on the film; the third discusses how the characters play off one another, and the fourth is about the work of the film's editor, Anne Coates. The first three parts feature interviews with ""Taking Lives' director, producer, and principal cast. Anne Coates is interviewed in the forth part. ""Crime Lab"" is worthwhile if you enjoyed the movie and deserves some credit for featuring the work of the editor so prominently.

This movie was good, but it slowly but surely discintigrates into a ridiculous ending.Angelina Jolie plays an FBI agent looking for a killer in Montreal.

She is clearly haunted by her past, just like Clairise, and becomes so closely attached to her victims / witnesses that she almost faulters.  Just like Clairise.

Instead, the viewer is subject to a tired story about a mysterious killer who takes over the identities of his victims.  It's a been-there-done-that sort of movie.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 1]","Beginning with an excellently moody and gloomy atmosphere and some solid shocks, Taking Lives appears to be a film to rank right up there with Silence of the Lambs and Seven.  However, just like the film's screenplay, there are loads of twists that nearly take the film to the realm of absurdity, but it's gripping enough to keep you watching.  Angelina Jolie plays an FBI profiler summoned to Montreal to help find a serial killer who assumes the identities of those he kills.  An eyewitness (Ethan Hawke) holds the key to the killer's identity, and Kiefer Sutherland gives a great performance as a creepy suspect, but the film gets too predictable after it's mid-point.

Perhaps with that movie in mind, it raised the bar of how thrillers should be, making me feel very unsatisfied with this movie.Ileana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is a crime expert for the FBI. She is called to Montreal by the captain because a recent murder follows a pattern of serial killing that Scott was investigating, of course this does not sit well with the local detectives already on the case. Meanwhile, James Costa (Ethan Hawke) is the witness of the last murder and Scott believes that the killer is after him next. Throw in an old creepy lady, believed to be the murderer's mom, a love scene and some very predictable plot twists...and we have ""Taking Lives"".Like many of the reviewers here mentioned, the movie started very well. It set the tone for the rest of the movie, unfortunately it just spirals downhill from there. Jolie is a good actress but there was nothing special about Agent Scott, never once did I believe she's an expert in criminology. Yeah, so she lies down in dirt and pastes murder pictures around her apartment. She struck me more of a sicko than someone dedicated to her job. Ethan Hawke plays James Costa pretty well, basically because nothing much is required from that character. Kiefer Sutherland, who I feel is one of Hollywood's greatest actors, is underused here. I wonder what made him do this movie in the first place. Maybe he lost a bet with the director or something.Ultimately, even with the talent they roped in...it could not save the movie because of it's predictability and lack of excitement. Most movies that I find good, I credit the writers first because that's the backbone of any movie, especially movies like this. This movie was alright, but nothing to shout about.

And I think that is a covering word as a review of the story, the plot -the idea behind Taking Lives.I really wanted to like this movie, this because I really enjoyed (the perhaps a bit overrated) Seven (Freeman,Pit), and Taking Lives sets out to be something like it. It's not.Though it might fool you a little in the start, it has potential -and it contains the necasarry thriller-atmosphere required in these movies to be convinsing. The camera-work and picture-quality works, but after a while it seems to be the only thing to this movie that reminds you of a desent thriller. Because it's all been seen before, and I very soon got a little bored. Alone in dark and secret rooms with a flashlight, no electricity -searching for traces, creepy music in the background, the only thing missing is that there's a cat in here who suddenly makes an awful sound to make the audience jump in their seats. Though not quite, very close.Another big problem (for me) is Ethan Hawke, I don't care much for this man as an actor. He's a little boring actually, seems he is made for love-movies (the Sandra Bullock-kind) -and was a mistace for his role in this movie. He never convinsed me anyway. He is far from being the new ""Hannibal""!The story, very unoriginal by the way, has been ""heard"" too many times before. And of course it crossed my mind who the killer was many times before he was ""revealed"". Predictable? Yes!When it gets to the end, well, now I'm not even sure if it deserves two stars at all. So unrealistic, so thin, so ridicolous!Angelinas' character (she plays an investigator, not bad, but not much to work with it seems) fakes her pregnancy to wait for the killer far out on the country and far away from back-up (waiting for the killer as a ""live-bate"" who she mistacenly has had a love-affair with, and the killer now believes she is carrying his child), and when he shows up she lets him ""kill"" her and the child (he sticks a knife in her fake tummy of course) and all this as a part of some ""original"" set-up-plan, and when it's all over, she calls her companion to ""mention"" that everything went after the plan.

622961,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JMWP,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","I'm a sucker for ""serial killer"" movies.  I'm always on the search for the new SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the new MANHUNTER, even the new SEVEN.  But I am so often disappointed!  Sometimes the movie fails to generate really good tension or suspense, and sometimes the movie fails to deliver a properly insane or creepy killer.TAKING LIVES fails on both counts.  It is never really exciting or interesting in terms of the ""chase.""  And the killer, both when he is a mystery figure and when he is known to us, is not very threatening or interesting.The film starts well enough.  We meet two young men riding together on a bus, one played by troubled looking Paul Dano and the other by easy-going, devil-may-care Justin Chatwin.  They have an easy, believable meeting of the minds, and as they journey on together, Dano kills Chatwin (in a startling, effective scene) and takes his identity.  He takes his life, if you will (explaining the title).  Years later, the killer is still at it, jumping lives.  We don't know who he is anymore (Dano is out of the picture now, because his killer is now probably around 40 years old).  The killer is working Canada, and the police there bring in the help of acknowledged serial-killer expert Angelina Jolie.She dives into the case, and eventually unravels it and then much of the movie is spent in an effort to trap their man.  There's very little serial-killing and lots of ""oops, we just missed him"" chase scenes.  None are interesting.The killer is very average in his cravings, and has no ""fun"" twists to his persona.  Just a guy who kills people to take their identities.  (And don't accuse me of callowness...this is entertainment, after all.  In real life, sure, a killer like this is PLENTY scary enough.)When the film was nearly over, it occurred to me that Jolie's character really did very little successful detective work.  She interpreted a couple of clues, gave the Canadian police a very sketchy profile and then gets very lucky when a witness (Ethan Hawke) comes forward.  If not for this witness, I don't think she would ever have caught her man.  In many ways, the movie is about the developing relationship between Jolie and Hawke.  Their interest gets very physical (and thus, Jolie becomes very unprofessional)...and I guess if you'd like to see a few moments of Jolie in a topless sex scene...this movie is ever slightly less bad than ORIGINAL SIN.Olivier Martinez (who was once on his way to stardom after UNFAITHFUL...what happened there?) is on hand as a cop who deeply disapproves of Jolie.  Keifer Sutherland is there as a suspect in about three scenes...and he speaks about five lines.  Gena Rowlands appears as the killer's mother...I hope she was paid well, because her role is somewhat embarrassing.Frankly, everyone should be mildly embarrassed.  Sutherland looks deeply unhappy.  Martinez just looks vaguely like he needs a bath.  Ethan Hawke has no gravitas (and looks vaguely like he needs a bath).  Frankly, Jolie seems more masculine than him.  When he realizes that he and Jolie have a strong likelihood of having sex...he looks like a 13 year old boy who was given a $100 gift certificate for a candy store, not a man about to get lucky with a very beautiful woman.  And Jolie tries so hard to be a serious, intelligent, hard-working detective...but somehow is not convincing for one single minute.  I believe that she IS a serious and intelligent actress...but her performance just comes across as stiff and wooden.  Later, she is allowed to let down her faade and just be ""hot"", but then she is no longer credible as a detective.  There are no shades of grey in this performance...which is not helped by director D.J. Caruso's efforts to dwell on her striking features.  It can be done...Eastwood directed her in CHANGELING and certainly his camera showed a lot of her...yet he was able to avoid the feeling that he was dwelling on her face just for the sake of dwelling.  Caruso clearly just couldn't believe he was lucky enough to have this star in his film.The film has a twisty ending...but it isn't really a surprise if you've seen even one or two other ""thrillers"" in your life.  Even the Canadian locations, which could have been lovely, are mostly muddy and generic.  That's the movie for you...generic.",2,"Uninspired, unconvincing and unexciting.",1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,4286,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', ""'m"", 'always', 'search', 'new', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'new', 'MANHUNTER', 'even', 'new', 'SEVEN', 'am', 'so', 'often', 'disappointed', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'generate', 'really', 'good', 'tension', 'suspense', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'deliver', 'properly', 'insane', 'creepy', 'killer.TAKING', 'LIVES', 'counts', 'never', 'really', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'terms', 'chase', 'killer', 'when', 'mystery', 'figure', 'when', 'known', 'not', 'very', 'threatening', 'interesting.The', 'film', 'well', 'enough', 'meet', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'riding', 'together', 'bus', 'one', 'played', 'troubled', 'looking', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'other', 'easy-going', 'devil-may-care', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'have', 'easy', 'believable', 'meeting', 'minds', 'journey', 'together', 'Dano', 'Chatwin', 'startling', 'effective', 'scene', 'identity', 'life', 'will', 'explaining', 'title', 'Years', 'later', 'killer', 'still', 'jumping', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'anymore', 'Dano', 'picture', 'now', 'killer', 'now', 'probably', '40', 'years', 'old', 'killer', 'working', 'Canada', 'police', 'there', 'bring', 'help', 'acknowledged', 'serial-killer', 'expert', 'Angelina', 'Jolie.She', 'case', 'eventually', 'unravels', 'then', 'much', 'movie', 'spent', 'effort', 'trap', 'man', 'very', 'little', 'serial-killing', 'lots', 'oops', 'just', 'missed', 'chase', 'scenes', 'None', 'are', 'interesting.The', 'killer', 'very', 'average', 'cravings', 'fun', 'twists', 'persona', 'Just', 'guy', 'who', 'people', 'take', 'identities', 'do', ""n't"", 'accuse', 'callowness', 'entertainment', 'real', 'life', 'sure', 'killer', 'PLENTY', 'scary', 'enough', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'nearly', 'over', 'occurred', 'Jolie', 'character', 'really', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'successful', 'detective', 'work', 'interpreted', 'couple', 'clues', 'gave', 'Canadian', 'police', 'very', 'sketchy', 'profile', 'then', 'very', 'lucky', 'when', 'witness', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'forward', 'not', 'witness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'caught', 'man', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Jolie', 'Hawke', 'interest', 'very', 'physical', 'thus', 'Jolie', 'very', 'unprofessional', 'guess', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'few', 'moments', 'Jolie', 'topless', 'sex', 'scene', 'movie', 'ever', 'slightly', 'less', 'bad', 'ORIGINAL', 'SIN.Olivier', 'Martinez', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'way', 'stardom', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'what', 'happened', 'hand', 'cop', 'who', 'deeply', 'disapproves', 'Jolie', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'there', 'suspect', 'three', 'scenes', 'five', 'lines', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'killer', 'mother', 'hope', 'was', 'paid', 'well', 'role', 'somewhat', 'embarrassing.Frankly', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'mildly', 'embarrassed', 'Sutherland', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'Martinez', 'just', 'vaguely', 'bath', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'gravitas', 'vaguely', 'bath', 'Frankly', 'Jolie', 'more', 'masculine', 'When', 'Jolie', 'have', 'strong', 'likelihood', 'having', 'sex', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'given', '100', 'gift', 'certificate', 'candy', 'store', 'not', 'man', 'get', 'lucky', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Jolie', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'hard-working', 'detective', 'somehow', 'not', 'convincing', 'one', 'single', 'minute', 'believe', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'actress', 'performance', 'just', 'across', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'Later', 'allowed', 'let', 'down', 'faade', 'just', 'be', 'hot', 'then', 'no', 'longer', 'credible', 'detective', 'are', 'shades', 'grey', 'performance', 'not', 'helped', 'director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'efforts', 'dwell', 'striking', 'features', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'CHANGELING', 'certainly', 'camera', 'showed', 'lot', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'avoid', 'feeling', 'was', 'dwelling', 'face', 'just', 'sake', 'dwelling', 'Caruso', 'clearly', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'star', 'film.The', 'film', 'twisty', 'ending', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'thrillers', 'life', 'Even', 'Canadian', 'locations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lovely', 'are', 'mostly', 'muddy', 'generic', 'movie', 'generic']",N/A

When bodies start piling up in the Montreal area, the agent - an expert in serial killer profiling - is brought in to assist the local authorities in finding the culprit.  The perpetrator's modus operandi is to target men roughly his own age and build, murder them in cold blood, then assume their identities.  Once he grows tired of living their lives, he proceeds to his next victim.  Ethan Hawke plays a man who's witnessed the most recent of the killings and who may now be next in line on the man's hit list.""Taking Lives"" sticks pretty much within the confines of its overworked genre.  We have the disgruntled local cop who resents interference from a hotshot outsider; the prime suspect who turns out to be just another of the killer's many victims; and the double twist resolution which really isn't all that hard to see coming twenty minutes or so into the movie.  Jolie gives her usual wooden performance as the FBI agent, barely managing to register a single convincing emotion throughout the course of the film.

622970,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B00005JMWP,S. Harris,"[0, 2]","""Taking Lives"" starts out promisingly enough, with a young serial killer to be coldly killing, and then absorbing his victim's personality.  Roll it forward twenty years or so, and you have bodies being dug up by the police in Canada.  FBI agent Jolie is called in to help the helpless Canadian cops find their man.  A witness is found to one of the murders, and the game begins.  Other movies come to mind, and often, when watching ""Taking Lives.""  Caruso, who directed the admirable ""Salton Sea,"" has resorted to blatant ripoffs in ""Lives.""  If you are familiar with ""Manhunter,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Seven,"" and even the wild Japanese effort, ""Audition,"" you will find those films in scene after scene of ""Taking Lives.""  So much so, that the movie never really develops its own heart as far as a story goes. It's too busy, like the killer ironically enough, absorbing the best parts of other films.The acting, however, is pretty good.  But you can only do so much without an intelligent script.  Jolie, in particular, is hurt by this.  In one scene, she confesses to Hawke, why she is an agent - and it lands with a real dramatic thud.  No doubt the thought was that her ""secret"" for being an agent leaves her vulnerable to the wiles of the killer.  Again, shades of Hannibal and Jodie here.  Heck, Jolie is even a country girl, just like agent Starling.  Problem is that Jolie's secret is tossed in in such a way as to be unbelievable. And for the seduction to work, you need that dramatic hinge. Whatever.  There are plenty of other problems in this film, and this is just one of them.

Taking Lives must've been among the most stunning productions of 2004, no doubt, yet it shall remain relegated to oblivion because it sets up a textured plot only to falter before the credits roll. It's almost as if the team was so busy finessing the product they ran out of time and shipped it before it was fully done.Angelina Jolie plays a psychological profiler from the FBI called upon to solve seemingly connected murders in French-speaking Montreal. She works alongside a couple of cardboard cops -- one a tightly wound incompetent, the other a doting ex-colleague -- to come up with desperately needed leads. Enter Ethan Hawke, an art dealer, a witness to one of the murders. An actor clearly in full command of his art, he is fascinating in long monologues. As this happens, Keifer Sutherland lurks in the shadows on street corners. He has remarkable screen presence, I'm increasingly impressed with the man and hope he bags roles with more meat in the future, but his bit here is sadly inadequate, more of a twist than a role really.On a positive note, the film unfurls with hypnotic rhythm. The acid-jazzy score lends richly to the overall elegance. You may want to postpone your dinner though, the murders are gruesome and the director doesn't wince in showing open cadavers. Which I thought was needless, as was an utterly skippable intimate interlude between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, tossed in for no conceivable reason because it is soon followed by an ending that feels almost like a different film. Cramped into less than 10 minutes, it all but kills the delicate cadence of the movie that preceded it, and it's as idiotic a finale as you've seen in recent memory.Net net, the film may boast top-notch production values, but as they say: give them a strong last impression and you have a hit, goof it up and you're dead as disco.

Hollywood 's entire history, for better or worse, is based on studios, producers, directors, even actors, tapping into that which is au courant and using to their own best advantage. It's only when a moviemaker so blatantly rips off another that a hew and cry goes up about cinematic plagiarism (re: Brian DePalma's unabashed love affair with all things Alfred Hitchcock, so vividly on display in such films as ""Carrie"", ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Body Double"") Even then, while those films can be accused of being rip-offs of their superior progenitors, at least they are good rip-offs. DePalma's brand of obsessiveness appears to have afflicted director D.J. Caruso with his sophomore effort, the new suspense thriller, ""Taking Lives"", starring Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke and Kiefer Sutherland. Caruso's work reeks of so many other latter day suspense classics (such as ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""), yet he doesn't appear to have learned his lessons well from the masters.  Jolie is a special agent for the FBI who is called to Canada to help with an investigation into a series of killings that appear to be connected. Jolie's character, we are told, has a special affinity for this kind of work. She's the type who garners clues as to the psyche and motivations of the unknown killer by lying down in the site where a victim was found. Ostensibly, she has some kind of extra sense about serial killers, something known to the Canadian Chief of Police, a former comrade (and possibly lover) of hers when they trained together at the FBI, and a trait that some other, highly chauvinistic Montreal cops (i.e. ""Unfaithful""'s Olivier Martinez) don't buy into. Her investigation leads her to a woman who tells police she has just seen the son she thought died nearly twenty years, a young man she admits is very dangerous, a shaky eyewitness to the most recent of the serial killings, an art dealer played by Hawke, and a suspicious and mysterious man played by Sutherland. The police believe they have zeroed in on the killer, who has some connection to Hawke, so they use him as bait, but as is the case with these movies, all is not what it appears.Director Caruso borrows heavily from the look and feel of such films as Silence of the Lambs and Seven. Much of Taking Lives is shot in dark, dank basements or closeted rooms, shards of light penetrating through cracks in the walls. Dismembered and/or rotted bodies tumble from secret hiding places, dropping into frame right on cue for the maximum on the scare monitor. The problem is, we've seen all of this before, and most people get a weekly dose of this kind of ghoulish forensic foray on television with CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, so the scare tactics never really initiate the same fright sensibility.  The all-star cast does their best to rise above the pedestrian screenplay, but even they are hamstrung by the script's mediocrity. Jolie, putting in perhaps the most mainstream performance of her career, is sensual, sexy, tough and determined, the quintessential female heroine in the mold of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. Unfortunately, her character has too many vestiges of Foster's, with the exception of the eroticism that simply comes with being Angelina Jolie. Hawke is all nervous ticks and twitches that almost give away too much, while Sutherland, on hiatus from his heroics in TV's 24, gives perhaps the film's most subtle performance, seductively menacing.  ""Taking Lives"" has everything it takes to be a first-class suspense thriller, but somehow falls short, particularly in the film's climactic moments. The denouement is nowhere near as satisfying as one hope for, the suspense long since having been played out so the life is taken out of ""Taking Lives"".",2,Taking Lives  (2004),1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,4040,"['Director', 'D.J', 'CarusoCast', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Oliver', 'Martinez', 'Tcheky', 'Karyo', 'Jean-Hughes', 'Anglade', 'Paul', 'Dano.Running', 'Time', '109', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'gore', 'language', 'nudity', 'scene', 'sex.It', 'crime', 'emulate', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'entire', 'history', 'better', 'worse', 'based', 'studios', 'producers', 'directors', 'even', 'actors', 'tapping', 'au', 'courant', 'using', 'own', 'best', 'advantage', 'only', 'when', 'moviemaker', 'so', 'blatantly', 'hew', 'cry', 'up', 'about', 'cinematic', 'plagiarism', 're', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'unabashed', 'love', 'affair', 'things', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'so', 'vividly', 'display', 'such', 'films', 'Carrie', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'Body', 'Double', 'Even', 'then', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'rip-offs', 'superior', 'progenitors', 'least', 'are', 'good', 'rip-offs', 'DePalma', 'brand', 'obsessiveness', 'have', 'afflicted', 'director', 'D.J', 'Caruso', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'new', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'starring', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Caruso', 'work', 'reeks', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'latter', 'day', 'suspense', 'classics', 'such', 'Seven', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'yet', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'learned', 'lessons', 'well', 'masters', 'Jolie', 'special', 'agent', 'FBI', 'who', 'called', 'Canada', 'help', 'investigation', 'series', 'killings', 'appear', 'be', 'connected', 'Jolie', 'character', 'are', 'told', 'special', 'affinity', 'kind', 'work', 'type', 'who', 'clues', 'psyche', 'motivations', 'unknown', 'killer', 'lying', 'down', 'site', 'where', 'victim', 'was', 'found', 'Ostensibly', 'kind', 'extra', 'sense', 'serial', 'killers', 'something', 'known', 'Canadian', 'Chief', 'Police', 'former', 'comrade', 'possibly', 'lover', 'hers', 'when', 'trained', 'together', 'FBI', 'trait', 'other', 'highly', 'chauvinistic', 'Montreal', 'cops', 'i.e', 'Unfaithful', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'investigation', 'woman', 'who', 'police', 'just', 'seen', 'son', 'thought', 'died', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'dangerous', 'shaky', 'eyewitness', 'most', 'recent', 'serial', 'killings', 'art', 'dealer', 'played', 'Hawke', 'suspicious', 'mysterious', 'man', 'played', 'Sutherland', 'police', 'believe', 'have', 'zeroed', 'killer', 'who', 'connection', 'Hawke', 'use', 'bait', 'case', 'movies', 'not', 'what', 'appears.Director', 'Caruso', 'borrows', 'heavily', 'look', 'feel', 'such', 'films', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Seven', 'Much', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'shot', 'dark', 'dank', 'basements', 'closeted', 'rooms', 'shards', 'light', 'penetrating', 'cracks', 'walls', 'Dismembered', 'and/or', 'rotted', 'bodies', 'tumble', 'secret', 'hiding', 'places', 'dropping', 'frame', 'right', 'cue', 'maximum', 'scare', 'monitor', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'most', 'people', 'get', 'weekly', 'dose', 'kind', 'ghoulish', 'forensic', 'foray', 'television', 'CSI', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Investigation', 'scare', 'tactics', 'never', 'really', 'initiate', 'same', 'fright', 'sensibility', 'all-star', 'cast', 'best', 'rise', 'pedestrian', 'screenplay', 'even', 'are', 'hamstrung', 'script', 'mediocrity', 'Jolie', 'putting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'mainstream', 'performance', 'career', 'sensual', 'sexy', 'tough', 'determined', 'quintessential', 'female', 'heroine', 'mold', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'too', 'many', 'vestiges', 'Foster', 'exception', 'eroticism', 'simply', 'being', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Hawke', 'nervous', 'ticks', 'twitches', 'almost', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Sutherland', 'hiatus', 'heroics', 'TV', '24', 'perhaps', 'film', 'most', 'subtle', 'performance', 'seductively', 'menacing', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'everything', 'be', 'first-class', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'somehow', 'short', 'particularly', 'film', 'climactic', 'moments', 'denouement', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'satisfying', 'one', 'hope', 'suspense', 'long', 'having', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'life', 'taken', 'Taking', 'Lives']",N/A

What begins as a normal homicide, eventually turns dark as a witness by the name of Costa (Ethan Hawke) is found at the scene of the latest murder. Claiming to have seen the murderer, Costa becomes the only witness the in this bizarre story. Everything turns upside down as Jolie investigates the possibility of a 'chameleon' killer, one that takes the body of another and lives the life they have built. As her hunt develops, she draws an attraction to Costa that will blur her image of reality. This seemingly innocent relationship will cause Scott to realize that emotions and crime fighting do not mesh. Keifer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, and Olivier Martinez finish out the rest of the case of this well-filmed, but somewhat poorly-acted, movie.Overall, Jolie was just a little too smart for my tastes as she would dramatically go into a near trance to think about the crimes and all of a sudden pull out an answer that had somehow evaded the experienced detectives.The movie is predictable but does provide a few jump out of your seat momemts although the ending could be seen from a mile away.

622981,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMWP,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","This is (yet another) serial killer suspence starring Anglina Jolie as FBI agent sent to Montreal, where a maimed dead body was found at a construction site.  Profiler Illeana (Jolie in designer's clothes) investigates the case using her unique method -- such as lying at the exact place where the body was -- before another guy was found dead.  But this time, she got a witness.Now, let me be honest with you.  The story about a serial killer (this time who 'takes lives') is nothing new these days, and things do not change much after watching this one.  Not that this is a waste of time.  Director DJ Caruso shows unmistakable talent in establishing the mood, with stylish lightening and very effetive storytelling.  Sometimes unprepared audiences would jump in their seats for at the unexpected moment they see very unexpected things happen.But the story?  Sorry, no surprise.  Or, I should say, the first two-thirds are pretty fascinating (though conventional), because the film succeeds in creating the suspenceful mood fairly well.  Then, oh my ... the last 30 minutes are utterly nonsense, which I refuse to reveal here, not because I might spoil your fun, but because, if written on paper, you just wouldn't believe it.  The ending is THAT silly.  So silly.You got impressive cast and stylish direction here -- Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez, Jean-Hughes Anglande, Tcheky Karyo, plus Gena 'Gloria' Rowlands.  The photography is great (thanks to Amir Mokri), and the music is none other than Philip Glass! (and it is reported that some of the ex-FBI profilers gave advice to the crew.  That means, wow, Does FBI does that?)Good for killing time, and I don't deny its entertainment value, but ultimately 'Taking Lives' proves only two thing: one, Angelia Jolie is as gorgeous as ever (which doesn't mean her choice is not a suspect); two; it's getting harder every year to make this kind of serial killer thriller.

Marshall,"[1, 2]","This film is a great suspenseful thriller with a decent enough cast to be more than interesting, but it is also superfluous and irritating at times.The story is a real twister and will keep you guessing until the very end. Murders are being committed in Montreal and a team of experts sets out to solve them. As a viewer you are left guessing, then suspecting, and then guessing again. The actors are well cast and appealing in their individual roles with each contributing something worthy to the film. The three French detectives, played by Olivier Martinez, Tcheky Karyo and Jean-Hugues Anglade, are all great in their nose-to-the-grindstone tenacity. Martinez stands out as the sexy mysterious one that stirs a few questions. Kiefer Sutherland appears in an eerie way sending all sorts of messages to your senses and always playing such a part perfectly natural. Ethan Hawke is a witness who seems legitimate but also has an edge to his realm. Gena Rowlands is excellent as a worried mother who believes her evil son may have been the killer of so many young men. So the plot is set get ready for the ride.Of course the star of this movie is Angelina Jolie, a woman who is either amazingly lovely or downright irritating in her roles. Jolie begins this film as an incredibly strong and independent FBI agent/profiler who is appointed to help the Canadian detectives solve the murder mysteries at hand. She is great in the beginning of this film exhibiting a toughness that she sometimes lacks despite the attempt. Jolie is distant and constantly thinking, placing herself in the killer's shoes and attempting to master his/her thoughts. So what happens half-way through this film? Jolie suddenly becomes a stupid inane idiot, falling for someone who has danger signs written all over him, simply because she is lonely. She lowers herself to an entirely gratuitous sex scene and spends all of her close ups concentrating on how enormous her lips are and how much waterproof mascara she can wear. Needless to say I wasn't shocked to find out the director of this film was a man! Jolie's role goes from strength and wisdom to barefoot and pregnant and her integrity almost goes down the drain too. But thankfully with an ending twist she is revived to some degree as the woman she started out to be. Enough with the close-ups we all know she has lips, let her act already.For thriller and murder mystery fans this movie is a perfect treat. For lovers of gore and slasher films this movie contains enough to wet your whistle. Sadly even lovers of Jolie get more than they ever bargained for, much to her disgrace. The director does an excellent job at adding some scare tactics that will leave you jumping as well as a few chase scenes filled with excitement. Overall this film is pretty good but it could have been better if treated with a bit more care and respect for Jolie who ended up taking a few punches along the way.",4,Thrilling,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2925,"['film', 'great', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'decent', 'enough', 'cast', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'also', 'superfluous', 'irritating', 'times.The', 'story', 'real', 'twister', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'Murders', 'are', 'being', 'committed', 'Montreal', 'team', 'experts', 'sets', 'out', 'solve', 'viewer', 'are', 'left', 'guessing', 'then', 'suspecting', 'then', 'guessing', 'again', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'appealing', 'individual', 'roles', 'contributing', 'something', 'worthy', 'film', 'three', 'French', 'detectives', 'played', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'Tcheky', 'Karyo', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'are', 'great', 'nose-to-the-grindstone', 'tenacity', 'Martinez', 'out', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'one', 'few', 'questions', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'eerie', 'way', 'sending', 'sorts', 'messages', 'senses', 'always', 'playing', 'such', 'part', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'witness', 'who', 'legitimate', 'also', 'edge', 'realm', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'excellent', 'worried', 'mother', 'who', 'evil', 'son', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'killer', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'plot', 'set', 'get', 'ready', 'ride.Of', 'course', 'star', 'movie', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'woman', 'who', 'amazingly', 'lovely', 'downright', 'irritating', 'roles', 'Jolie', 'film', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'independent', 'FBI', 'agent/profiler', 'who', 'appointed', 'help', 'Canadian', 'detectives', 'solve', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'hand', 'great', 'beginning', 'film', 'exhibiting', 'toughness', 'sometimes', 'attempt', 'Jolie', 'distant', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'placing', 'killer', 'shoes', 'attempting', 'master', 'thoughts', 'So', 'what', 'half-way', 'film', 'Jolie', 'suddenly', 'stupid', 'inane', 'idiot', 'falling', 'someone', 'who', 'danger', 'signs', 'written', 'simply', 'lonely', 'entirely', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scene', 'close', 'ups', 'concentrating', 'how', 'enormous', 'lips', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'waterproof', 'can', 'wear', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'man', 'Jolie', 'role', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'barefoot', 'pregnant', 'integrity', 'almost', 'down', 'drain', 'too', 'thankfully', 'ending', 'twist', 'revived', 'degree', 'woman', 'started', 'out', 'be', 'Enough', 'close-ups', 'know', 'lips', 'let', 'act', 'already.For', 'thriller', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fans', 'movie', 'perfect', 'treat', 'lovers', 'gore', 'slasher', 'films', 'movie', 'enough', 'wet', 'whistle', 'Sadly', 'even', 'lovers', 'Jolie', 'get', 'more', 'ever', 'bargained', 'much', 'disgrace', 'director', 'excellent', 'job', 'adding', 'scare', 'tactics', 'will', 'leave', 'jumping', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'chase', 'scenes', 'filled', 'excitement', 'Overall', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'treated', 'bit', 'more', 'care', 'respect', 'Jolie', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'few', 'punches', 'way']",N/A

It is definitely worth your money.The movie starts in a brutal manner with two teenagers and we think that the movie is a classical maniac killer guy thing, who is killing people because his mama didn't pay too much attention to him when he was little. Classical excuse for all irresponsible psychopaths out there! Everybody is looking for the killer who is very angry and destroys his victims faces. Half way through the movie, the director gives you a hint about the killer. It is a minuscule detail that people who pay attention will get it. I had to rewind the movie to make sure.Jolie plays an FBI profiler that has a problem focusing on the case. We don't know her family background exactly, but she has problems too. Slowly the movie takes off and it is becoming really intense. She finally gets closer to the killer, only to lose him forever. Or this is what we think...The final 60 seconds of the movie are really intense and make everything clear.The only problem with the movie is Olivier Martinez. He is just a terrible actor, and he is pushing his French accent too much. I have not seen Martinez in any French movie yet, but have seen him in few movies on this side of the pond and he is a terrible. And the accent that he is pushing doesn't help. I know that the movie is made in Montreal and people are supposed to speak with a French accent, but Tchecky Karyo and Jean-Hughe Anglade are really good. And they have a decent French accent. In addition, his role/person is totally irrelevant to the plot and the entire movie. If his character was to be eliminated from the plot, nothing would have changed. Even Kieffer Sutherland and Gena Rowlands who have minimal roles in this movies are much better and more relevant than Martinez. Of course Sutherland has always an ambiguous role and we get it by the end of movie.I was really torn between giving the movie three stars because of the performance of Olivier Martinez, or five stars because of the plot, the acting of everybody else and the great unexpected ending. If we just ignore the annoying performance of Martinez, it is a five stars all the way because of the great unexpected ending and Angelina Jolie's performance.",5,One of best Jolie's movies!
