90994,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,0790729644,A Customer,"[1, 4]","It had been ages since I'd watched this. I saw it in a theater in the U.S. when it was new. And I was carrying many memories which were quite vague beyond the words, ""This is great."" Remembering more detail than that was kinda like Clint's character, William Munny, trying to remember everybody he killed. It's been a long time, a lot of miles, and a whole lot of drinkin'.So, what are my thoughts on UNFORGIVEN this week, all these years later, watching the DVD at my home in China?First scene, a bad guy slices a whore's face. I was appalled. I thought that perhaps it was a good movie but maybe that scene was gratuitous. Or maybe they just wanted to show us, ""That guy needed killin,"" which is still a valid defense in the South. So, I decided to let it play.A bit later, Gene Hackman's kicking the mess out of Richard Harris. I was appalled again. And this film never got any kinder or gentler. But isn't Gene Hackman wonderful? What a performance. Has he ever made a bad movie? None I've seen.Finally, I remembered. This appalling, ugly violence was deliberate. When I first saw this movie, I'd been ingesting a steady diet of Hollywood, and I got the message even back then. I've been away from that diet a long time, and the message was even more obvious.(Too obvious? Not for the crowd that admires Dirty Harry.)Violent deeds carry heavy consequences. Gawd, that looks so flat as I type it. So trite. But heck, maybe you've seen some real world violence yourself. And then you see the Hollywood version. So different. This film did try to show us just how divergent the two are.A soldier in Iraq claimed that whenever you kill somebody, you kill a piece of yourself. True, and yet a slight bit simplistic at the same time. To explain why I write that would be to sermonize ad nauseum, which is something the film never does. It is what it is, folks. Watch it.The DVD also contains some very cool stuff about how it was made.",5,Unforgiven,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,1933,"['had', 'been', 'ages', ""'d"", 'watched', 'saw', 'theater', 'U.S.', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'carrying', 'many', 'memories', 'were', 'quite', 'vague', 'words', 'great', 'Remembering', 'more', 'detail', 'was', 'kinda', 'Clint', 'character', 'William', 'Munny', 'trying', 'remember', 'everybody', 'killed', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'lot', 'miles', 'whole', 'lot', ""drinkin'.So"", 'what', 'are', 'thoughts', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'week', 'years', 'later', 'watching', 'DVD', 'home', 'China', 'First', 'scene', 'bad', 'guy', 'whore', 'face', 'was', 'appalled', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'scene', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'show', 'guy', 'needed', 'killin', 'still', 'valid', 'defense', 'South', 'So', 'decided', 'let', 'play.A', 'bit', 'later', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'kicking', 'mess', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'was', 'appalled', 'again', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'kinder', 'gentler', ""n't"", 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'wonderful', 'What', 'performance', 'ever', 'made', 'bad', 'movie', 'None', ""'ve"", 'seen.Finally', 'remembered', 'appalling', 'ugly', 'violence', 'was', 'deliberate', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', ""'d"", 'been', 'ingesting', 'steady', 'diet', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'message', 'even', 'back', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'away', 'long', 'time', 'message', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'Too', 'obvious', 'Not', 'crowd', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Violent', 'carry', 'heavy', 'consequences', 'Gawd', 'so', 'flat', 'type', 'So', 'trite', 'heck', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'world', 'violence', 'then', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'So', 'different', 'film', 'did', 'try', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'divergent', 'two', 'are.A', 'soldier', 'Iraq', 'claimed', 'whenever', 'kill', 'somebody', 'kill', 'piece', 'True', 'yet', 'slight', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'same', 'time', 'explain', 'why', 'write', 'would', 'be', 'sermonize', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'something', 'film', 'never', 'what', 'folks', 'Watch', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'stuff', 'how', 'was', 'made']",Unforgiven Snap Case

This sad excuse for a tale of western action and drama falls far short of anyone's expectations for an Oscar caliber film.My primary complaint is the lack of action.  Throughout the movie I found myself waiting in vain for bloody death, when all i received was a few quick and conservative deaths.Secondly, the geriatric cast seemingly had difficulty with the scenes involving weapons, as the action crawled to a near stop at the moivie's climax.  Even the most devoted of western movie fans with impeccable concentration will find himself fidgeting in his seat as the bullets go flying by, ONE AT A TIME, seldom hitting any target.The cinematography was painfully disruptive as one scene in particular continually switched from glaringly bright to dismally black so quickly that my retinas still are recovering from the shock.Finally, the writing so terribly sappy and predictable, that I could have sworn the writer was trying to disappoint the audience with tacky lines and dismal revelation.

91000,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790729644,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","It's really no wonder it's taken me this long to finally see `Unforgiven'.  I've stated before that westerns were never really my thing, and it's not like Eastwood has a huge draw on me either.  He's serviceable at best in my opinion, only on rare occasions having his overly gruff mannerisms pay off with brilliance.  After the amazing year westerns in general had last year (`3:10 to Yuma', `No Country for Old Men' and `...Jesse James...' all making my top ten of the year) I figured that maybe I should research this Oscar winning classic to see if the films iconic status was justified.Watching `Unforgiven' has really made me realize that you should never judge a film before you see it, because you never truly know what's in store for you.`Unforgiven' opens with a sharp pain of brutality as two men victimize a woman.  When the sheriff doesn't do anything more than slap the men's wrists the women of the community put out a reward for the men's head.  William Munny, a former murderer turned caring father and widower, hears of the reward and, hesitantly, decides to pursue it in order to better take care of his two children.  Along with his former sidekick Ned Logan and an overly confident young gunslinger going by the name of The Schofield Kid, Munny makes his way into town with his horse and his gun and the smell of blood.Eastwood really went all out with this production.  The overall feel of the film is very gritty and dark and adds weight to the moral that is brought to the full as the curtains close so-to-speak.  The film is violent, but in a repressed sort of way, allowing the majority of the film to ride on the anticipation of bloodshed and only truly rearing its head in short explosions of brutality.  This allows `Unforgiven' to become more than just an action film or a bloodbath but creates a film that is as deep and poignant as it is entertaining.The acting is also golden here.  Morgan Freeman seems to just coast through his scenes, but his companionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.  He just has such a natural talent that even when he isn't doing anything exceptional he is still amazing.  Clint has never really sold it for me.  I was impressed with him in `Million Dollar Baby' because I felt as though he made his harshness work to his advantage.  He does that here as well.  Next to `Million Dollar Baby' this has got to be his finest performance.  Gene Hackman steals the whole show though as Bill Daggett, the ruthless sheriff.  His savagery is embellished by his sick sense of justification and that makes Hackman's character development nothing short of extraordinary.In the end I'm pleased to say that `Unforgiven' stands up as worthy of the praise and attention it has received.  I can't say if it was the best film of the year (92 was such a fantastic year for film) but it most definitely ranks in my top ten and surely will stand the tests of time as one of the most effective westerns of all time, defining everything that makes the genre what it is.  I may not be an avid supporter of the genre as a whole, but when a western is done right it can be nothing short of amazing.  `Unforgiven' is done very, very right.",5,There is nothing to forgive; everything is pitch-perfect...,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3171,"['really', 'wonder', 'taken', 'long', 'finally', 'see', 'Unforgiven', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'westerns', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'thing', 'not', 'like', 'Eastwood', 'huge', 'draw', 'serviceable', 'best', 'opinion', 'only', 'rare', 'occasions', 'having', 'overly', 'gruff', 'mannerisms', 'pay', 'off', 'brilliance', 'amazing', 'year', 'westerns', 'general', 'had', 'last', 'year', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Jesse', 'James', 'making', 'top', 'ten', 'year', 'figured', 'maybe', 'should', 'research', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'classic', 'see', 'films', 'iconic', 'status', 'was', 'justified.Watching', 'Unforgiven', 'really', 'made', 'realize', 'should', 'never', 'judge', 'film', 'see', 'never', 'truly', 'know', 'what', 'store', 'you.', 'Unforgiven', 'sharp', 'pain', 'brutality', 'two', 'men', 'victimize', 'woman', 'When', 'sheriff', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'slap', 'men', 'wrists', 'women', 'community', 'put', 'out', 'reward', 'men', 'head', 'William', 'Munny', 'former', 'murderer', 'turned', 'caring', 'father', 'widower', 'hears', 'reward', 'hesitantly', 'decides', 'pursue', 'order', 'better', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'former', 'sidekick', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'overly', 'confident', 'young', 'gunslinger', 'going', 'name', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'Munny', 'way', 'town', 'horse', 'gun', 'smell', 'blood.Eastwood', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'production', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'gritty', 'dark', 'weight', 'moral', 'brought', 'full', 'curtains', 'close', 'so-to-speak', 'film', 'violent', 'repressed', 'sort', 'way', 'allowing', 'majority', 'film', 'ride', 'anticipation', 'bloodshed', 'only', 'truly', 'rearing', 'head', 'short', 'explosions', 'brutality', 'Unforgiven', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'action', 'film', 'bloodbath', 'film', 'deep', 'poignant', 'entertaining.The', 'acting', 'also', 'golden', 'here', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'just', 'coast', 'scenes', 'companionship', 'Eastwood', 'unmatchable', 'just', 'such', 'natural', 'talent', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'exceptional', 'still', 'amazing', 'Clint', 'never', 'really', 'sold', 'was', 'impressed', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'felt', 'made', 'harshness', 'work', 'advantage', 'that', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Next', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'got', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'whole', 'show', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'ruthless', 'sheriff', 'savagery', 'embellished', 'sick', 'sense', 'justification', 'Hackman', 'character', 'development', 'nothing', 'short', 'extraordinary.In', 'end', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'Unforgiven', 'up', 'worthy', 'praise', 'attention', 'received', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'year', '92', 'was', 'such', 'fantastic', 'year', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'top', 'ten', 'surely', 'will', 'stand', 'tests', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'westerns', 'time', 'defining', 'everything', 'genre', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'avid', 'supporter', 'genre', 'whole', 'when', 'western', 'done', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'Unforgiven', 'done', 'very', 'very', 'right']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91007,ARA48345JZPZR,0790729644,Archmaker,"[14, 16]","Clint Eastwood held onto the David People's script for Unforgiven for over 10 years.  Knowing it was something special, he wanted to be mature enough, as both an actor and a director, to do it justice.  It was a wise decision.Eastwood aged into the character of William Munny, chiseled, worn-looking, and I was quite surprised at how well he did with the role.  Munny is a haunted man, burdened with the memories of a violent past and the ghosts of many murders.  His denials &quot;I was drunk&quot; or &quot;I don't remember&quot; are belied by the guilty flicks of his eyes or the thousand yard stare when memory does come back &quot;remember that drover I shot...whose teeth came out the back of this neck?  He didn't do anything....&quot;.  It is all there in Eastwood's face and eyes when later in the film in his fever delirium William Munny sees the Hell he fears is waiting for him for his sins.Reformed by a beloved wife, now dead, and raising 2 children on a failing pig farm, Munny and his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) are lured out of retirement for one more killing for money.  But these old outlaws are different men now, older &amp; tired and domesticated, and it seems unlikely they can do the job.  We, like their young gunsel partner, the Scofield Kid, can't see the legendary hell-raiser and killer Munny in this haggard old man.I note that some were put-off by Unforgiven, expecting a Clint Eastwood type western.  Unforgiven really isn't a typical Western...it is more a character study wrapped in a meditation on violence.The violence in Unforgiven is not stylized or glamorized.  When the gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) gets the living tar kicked out of him by the sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman), he doesn't pop-up all fine an hour later.  Instead he is layed-up in a jail cell, bloody, swollen, and in pain.  When Little Bill dishes out the same to Eastwood later, William Munny is out for days and is scabbed and scarred afterward.  When Eastwood ambushes a cowboy, he dies slowly, in thirst and in pain. When Little Bill starts in on Ned, we and he know that it will be a long night of torture and pain.  When the Scofield Kid shoots a man in the privy, he is sickened by it and so should we be.Violence begets more violence.  From the initial cutting of the prostitute that sets it all in motion, to the beatings and shootings, the violence here only causes more violence and most of it out of proportion to the crime and most of it, even the sanctioned violence of the Law, has little or nothing to do with justice.Gene Hackman's Little Bill Dagget is a sadistic bully with a badge, his amiable facade masks a ruthless and mean killer.  The bemused twinkle in his eye can turn to a savage taunt in an instant. He enjoys beating people just a little too much, and he has the town cowed under his benevolent tyranny.  Hackman is great and deserved his Oscar.The only nod to the conventions of the Western is in the last act, but we are ready for it.  As  William Munny swigs the first whiskey he's had since his wife reformed him we watch him become distant, stronger, icier and resolved, the legendary stone-cold killer we've been hearing about throughout the movie is now before us and out for revenge.The rainy ride into town and the total surprise of the laughing and confident posse-in-the-making, the cool malevolence... &quot;he better arm himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend&quot;... and the chaotic, awkward, chance and luck shootout that kills the guilty and the innocent indiscriminately, caps the theme of the film... &quot;deserve's got nothin to do with it&quot;.  Violence is just violence, it is haphazard and unfair.  It isn't pretty and it isn't justice.And killers leave death in their wake and go on to &quot;prosper in Dry Goods&quot;.This is a beautifully realized film with a great cast. Eastwood's direction is fine.  His pacing here is deliberate, but may be off-putting to those expecting a more action-oriented film.  This is a mature work, it improves on repeat viewings. Each scene fits to lay the foundation for the climactic confrontation,which is one of the best ever.  The dialogue is nuanced and revealing of character and motivation.  This is first-rate filmaking.",5,....and now I'm here to kill you Little Bill.......,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,4273,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'held', 'David', 'People', 'script', 'Unforgiven', '10', 'years', 'Knowing', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'wanted', 'be', 'mature', 'enough', 'actor', 'director', 'do', 'justice', 'was', 'wise', 'decision.Eastwood', 'aged', 'character', 'William', 'Munny', 'chiseled', 'worn-looking', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'role', 'Munny', 'haunted', 'man', 'burdened', 'memories', 'violent', 'past', 'ghosts', 'many', 'murders', 'denials', 'quot', 'was', 'drunk', 'quot', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'quot', 'are', 'belied', 'guilty', 'flicks', 'eyes', 'thousand', 'yard', 'stare', 'when', 'memory', 'come', 'back', 'quot', 'remember', 'drover', 'shot', 'teeth', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'neck', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'quot', 'there', 'Eastwood', 'face', 'eyes', 'when', 'later', 'film', 'fever', 'delirium', 'William', 'Munny', 'Hell', 'waiting', 'sins.Reformed', 'beloved', 'wife', 'now', 'dead', 'raising', '2', 'children', 'failing', 'pig', 'farm', 'Munny', 'old', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'lured', 'retirement', 'one', 'more', 'killing', 'money', 'old', 'outlaws', 'are', 'different', 'men', 'now', 'older', 'amp', 'tired', 'domesticated', 'unlikely', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'young', 'gunsel', 'partner', 'Scofield', 'Kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'legendary', 'hell-raiser', 'killer', 'Munny', 'haggard', 'old', 'man.I', 'note', 'were', 'put-off', 'Unforgiven', 'expecting', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'type', 'western', 'Unforgiven', 'really', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Western', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'wrapped', 'meditation', 'violence.The', 'violence', 'Unforgiven', 'not', 'stylized', 'glamorized', 'When', 'gunfighter', 'English', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'living', 'tar', 'kicked', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Dagget', 'Gene', 'Hackman', ""n't"", 'pop-up', 'fine', 'hour', 'later', 'Instead', 'layed-up', 'jail', 'cell', 'bloody', 'swollen', 'pain', 'When', 'Little', 'Bill', 'out', 'same', 'Eastwood', 'later', 'William', 'Munny', 'out', 'days', 'scabbed', 'scarred', 'afterward', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'cowboy', 'slowly', 'thirst', 'pain', 'When', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Ned', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'night', 'torture', 'pain', 'When', 'Scofield', 'Kid', 'man', 'privy', 'sickened', 'so', 'should', 'be.Violence', 'begets', 'more', 'violence', 'initial', 'cutting', 'prostitute', 'motion', 'beatings', 'shootings', 'violence', 'here', 'only', 'more', 'violence', 'most', 'proportion', 'crime', 'most', 'even', 'sanctioned', 'violence', 'Law', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'justice.Gene', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Dagget', 'sadistic', 'bully', 'badge', 'amiable', 'facade', 'masks', 'ruthless', 'mean', 'killer', 'bemused', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'can', 'turn', 'savage', 'taunt', 'instant', 'beating', 'people', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'town', 'cowed', 'benevolent', 'tyranny', 'Hackman', 'great', 'deserved', 'Oscar.The', 'only', 'conventions', 'Western', 'last', 'act', 'are', 'ready', 'William', 'Munny', 'swigs', 'first', 'whiskey', 'had', 'wife', 'reformed', 'watch', 'become', 'distant', 'stronger', 'icier', 'resolved', 'legendary', 'stone-cold', 'killer', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'movie', 'now', 'revenge.The', 'rainy', 'ride', 'town', 'total', 'surprise', 'laughing', 'confident', 'posse-in-the-making', 'cool', 'malevolence', 'quot', 'better', 'arm', 'going', 'decorate', 'saloon', 'friend', 'quot', 'chaotic', 'awkward', 'chance', 'luck', 'shootout', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'indiscriminately', 'theme', 'film', 'quot', 'deserve', 'got', 'nothin', 'do', 'quot', 'Violence', 'just', 'violence', 'haphazard', 'unfair', ""n't"", 'pretty', ""n't"", 'justice.And', 'killers', 'leave', 'death', 'wake', 'go', 'quot', 'Dry', 'Goods', 'quot', '.This', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'fine', 'pacing', 'here', 'deliberate', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'expecting', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'film', 'mature', 'work', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'scene', 'lay', 'foundation', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'dialogue', 'nuanced', 'revealing', 'character', 'motivation', 'first-rate', 'filmaking']",Unforgiven Snap Case

An ode to a dying genre, Unforgiven is a poetic justice to dispel many of the misconceptions that numerous Western movies have established. I can see the blind-as-a-bat boy who fills in the place for the audience members while the old-timer veterans of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman show literally what the life in the West is truly like. This is a clear-cut difference between men and boys. I love the acting, the mood, the somber setting, and the unique story of Unforgiven. What makes Unforgiven so great is how realistic the movie feels while depending on the mystique of the legend out of William Munny, played adeptly by no one other than Clint Eastwood, while it becomes a monster in the final climax. There is a great sense of humor throughout the film. Moreover, Morgan Freeman once again proves that he makes a perfect supporting actor with Clint Eastwood. I am impressed with everything about Unforgiven, and it will stand out as one of the most enduring Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood deservingly gets recognition for this picture and also for Million Dollar Baby. I've always knew that Clint Eastwood was a true filmmaker, and this one, he proved his mark. While nobody had paid attention to this man, Jaimz Woolvett gave a standout performance as the Schofield Kid. What he did deserves accolades. All in all, Unforgiven is a genuine Western film noir.8/11: Nearly the last true Western made, Unforgiven rights the wrongs that many Westerns in the past have committed, further mythologizing the Old West for something that it's really not. Unforgiven boasts of an all around cast including Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman. These three are the reason why you watch the film. It is as good as it gets. More important, Clint brings a resume with him when it comes to Western films, many of them quite bad, so it is obviously he set his heart on making the best Western as possible and leave his mark in the now dead genre. One underrated performance, never lauded by anyone, is by Jaimz Woolvett as the blind-as-a-bat Scholfield Kid. It's too bad he went empty that year.

91012,ALR35EFI69S5R,0790729644,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[3, 3]","What most strikes me about this film, given the fact it is essentially one of the best and most thoughtful westerns ever filmed, is the unexpected level of thoughtful comment it makes about the underlying effects of violence for everyone that encounters it. Clint Eastwood wanted to make this film his coda for what he thought was an accurate and faithful portrait of the west, violence, squalor and all. Of course, in so doing, he succeeds beyond all reasonable expectations. Clintwood plays the central character of William Munney, a reformed alcoholic ex-gunslinger who is miserably flailing about in vain as he attempts to continue along the straight and narrow path he has maintained to remain on since his reformation, and he is a flop as a dirt farmer, left alone to raise his two children after the death of his much-adored wife. When the notion of a way out is thrown unexpectedly in his lap, it takes him little time to recognize the opportunity as a lifeline must grab in his desperate circumstances. Unfortunately, it means he must regress to all of the horrors of a life his wife had originally rescued him from.Eastwood is supported by one of the most creatively talented casts in recent memory, from Gene Hackman playing his protagonist, the corrupt sheriff Little Bill Daggett, to Munny's old trail companion Ned Logan, underplayed masterfully by a mostly stone-faced Morgan Freeman, to a egocentric young killer-wannabe, played convincingly by a youthful Jaimie Woolvett. Richard Harris is also excellent as an English gunfighter, as is Saul Rubinek as an over-eager and somewhat nave yellow journalist who aims to make his journalistic bones in the literary world by writing stories about Little Bill. Yet amid all the action and carnage, one of the most memorable (and profound) scenes in the film consists of a simple conversation between Eastwood and Woolvett, in which Eastwood wastes no words describing the horror of killing someone, thereby robbing the person of all he is and all he ever can be. In the electric silence that follows, one begins to realize what Eastwood is really talking about, and it isn't just about the wild frontier. Another comment later on to his protagonist Little Bob is similarly something one has to experience to appreciate in terms of its philosophical import.Of course, Eastwood uses the camera to great cinematic advantage, employing every aspect of the local topography to shower us with both a mind-boggling backdrop by way of the landscape itself and an epic drama threading toward its fateful conclusion in the dust-filled trail ways and smoke-filled saloons native to the area. This movie must mark the last of a long series of progressively more sophisticated and memorable Eastwood epics portraying the west and its settling, for it is hard to see how he could improve on this film, which is certainly going to become a classic among western films. There is little doubt that this is a captivating, thought-provoking, and worthwhile movie, and one I am sure you would want to have in your library of films.

91013,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,0790729644,Barry C. Chow,"[7, 10]","""Unforgiven"" is no more a western than ""Citizen Kane"" is a biography. To reduce such complex films to such simple classifications would be to overlook everything important in them. ""Unforgiven"" is equal parts morality play, psychoanalysis, social critique and character study. But most of all, like ""Citizen Kane"", it is tragedy. It strives to show its central characters brought to ruin or death through tragic flaws: people doing horrible things not because they are evil, but because they cannot or will not overcome the worst of their natures. Eastwood's genius consists in his taking character flaws and turning them into moral flaws. This is the meaning of the title--what could easily have been called ""Unredeemed"" is transformed into ""Unforgiven"", because the rejection of redemption is unforgivable.This extra insight is what makes the film great and allows it to transcend its genre. Prior to ""Unforgiven"", many westerns had already adopted the conventions of noire and showed anti-heroes unredeemed, riding off into the sunset, in no sense good men but generally none the worse for having killed others. In ""Unforgiven"", Eastwood shows us men who lose pieces of their souls every time they kill, and he doesn't shrink from applying this imperative to the anti-hero himself. Munny loses not only his old friend Ned, but the redemption that his wife had gifted him and that he had earned in turning his back on his past. This is the boldest statement that a man like Eastwood could make--as a director Eastwood figuratively disavows the characters that made him famous as an actor. This is no Man With No Name or Dirty Harry wreaking divine vengeance or cathartic retribution. This is a man who, in accepting his last bounty, kills unjustifiably, causes the death of a friend, and surrenders forever the right to forgive himself.Eastwood would go on to make further films of incredible depth and stature. It is one of the most wonderful things to see a man, late in life, transformed from a one-note actor into a virtuoso director of subtle and almost infinite expression. ""Unforgiven"" is the first in a string of Eastwood triumphs, many of almost Shakespearean depth. But ""Unforgiven"" remains Eastwood's most well told story and richly deserves the boatload of awards that it harvested.",5,Unforgettable,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,2296,"['Unforgiven', 'more', 'western', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'biography', 'reduce', 'such', 'complex', 'films', 'such', 'simple', 'classifications', 'would', 'be', 'overlook', 'everything', 'important', 'Unforgiven', 'equal', 'parts', 'morality', 'play', 'psychoanalysis', 'social', 'critique', 'character', 'study', 'most', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'tragedy', 'show', 'central', 'characters', 'brought', 'ruin', 'death', 'tragic', 'flaws', 'people', 'doing', 'horrible', 'things', 'not', 'are', 'evil', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'overcome', 'worst', 'natures', 'Eastwood', 'genius', 'taking', 'character', 'flaws', 'turning', 'moral', 'flaws', 'meaning', 'title', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Unredeemed', 'transformed', 'Unforgiven', 'rejection', 'redemption', 'unforgivable.This', 'extra', 'insight', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'transcend', 'genre', 'Prior', 'Unforgiven', 'many', 'westerns', 'had', 'already', 'adopted', 'conventions', 'noire', 'showed', 'anti-heroes', 'unredeemed', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'sense', 'good', 'men', 'generally', 'none', 'worse', 'having', 'killed', 'others', 'Unforgiven', 'Eastwood', 'men', 'who', 'lose', 'pieces', 'souls', 'time', 'kill', ""n't"", 'shrink', 'applying', 'imperative', 'anti-hero', 'Munny', 'not', 'only', 'old', 'friend', 'Ned', 'redemption', 'wife', 'had', 'gifted', 'had', 'earned', 'turning', 'back', 'past', 'boldest', 'statement', 'man', 'Eastwood', 'could', 'make', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'figuratively', 'characters', 'made', 'famous', 'actor', 'Man', 'Name', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'wreaking', 'divine', 'vengeance', 'cathartic', 'retribution', 'man', 'who', 'accepting', 'last', 'bounty', 'unjustifiably', 'death', 'friend', 'surrenders', 'forever', 'right', 'forgive', 'himself.Eastwood', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'further', 'films', 'incredible', 'depth', 'stature', 'one', 'most', 'wonderful', 'things', 'see', 'man', 'late', 'life', 'transformed', 'one-note', 'actor', 'virtuoso', 'director', 'subtle', 'almost', 'infinite', 'expression', 'Unforgiven', 'first', 'string', 'Eastwood', 'triumphs', 'many', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'depth', 'Unforgiven', 'Eastwood', 'most', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'richly', 'boatload', 'awards', 'harvested']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The Oscars and countless other awards for this film were entirely merited.Eastwood gives heroism and old Western clichees a  backseat and gives his movie a more realistic tone.

It brings in consequence.  The &quot;Kid&quot; realizing that there are consequences to taking a person's life.  So many movies today present violence with a &quot;fire &amp; forget&quot; attitude.  It's shocking to see it so raw and to see the characters reacting to the violence: Freeman's character not being able to finish someone off and the &quot;kid&quot; deciding that he was finished with guns.  Eastwood's performance, particularly the last sequence, is startling.  It contrasts with his actions in most the movie.  We only hear that he was once a ruthless killer.  This makes it all the more potient.  Yes, he could kill anybody that got in his way.  His cold stare at Hackman just before he pulls the trigger will never leave my mind.  Now...as for the DVD presentation.  The sound is perfect.  Rain, horses, jingling spirs, gunshots, wind thru the grass, it's all there.  As for the picture it's a mixed bag.  The color occationally doesn't seem right.  People's faces are unnaturally pinkish and even purple.  At times there seems to be a double image or outline.  I was unable to watch it in the dark (perferred) because many scenes have areas that come off too bright and hurt my eyes.  Finally, the extras.  Or lack thereof.  Movie is a 4.5.  The DVD is a 3.5.

I thought they said the same thing for ""Flag of Our Fathers,"" or was that ""Pretty Baby""? No, wait, the Dirty Harry series? Please. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the brutal sheriff trying to keep his town gun-free. Morgan Freeman plays his gentle and wise buddy role, yet again.

This movie just takes that concept to its logical extreme, where every one of the three main characters turns out to be the opposite of what they first appeared to be.  It's just too predictable.  It's also just dull.  The whole ""English Bob"" storyline serves no purpose at all, I find it puzzling why a story would throw in what appears to be a main character, only to then shut him down completely and have him ridden out of town on a rail. It's to show how mean Gene Hackman's character is,  but it could have been done much better and with much less wasted time.  The writer who seems to be in the movie only for comic relief is another waste of time.  He's not really funny, just predictable.  Just another character undergoing personality changes, from naive writer to experienced opportunist.  And the ending wasn't nearly as satisfying as just about any other Eastwood film you care to mention.  It was too concerned with Clint's character's personal journey from responsible, hard-working pig farmer to whiskey drinking gunslinger to worry much about impact.  In short, it was like reading a very long novel where the whole climax is on the very last page of the book.  If we read a thousand page book, we need at least a 100 page ending, not something so quick as this.  Considering all the time that's been spent delving into every facet of Hackman's character, he wasn't really much of a player in the end.  Just another guy.  It had a real deus ex machina feel to it - they spent the whole movie showing Clint as an old (62 years old in  real life, and he looked it) pig farmer who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a six shooter, then at the end, well, lets just say all that character establishment didn't have anything to do with the ending.  The only character development seemed to come from taking up whiskey drinking again, which improves one's reflexes and aim apparently.  There are the usual quotes, ""I don't deserve this"", ""Deservin' ain't got nothin' to do with it"", but after sitting through this long dull thing, they don't have the usual impact.I have to agree with the others who have said that all the awards this movie gathered are more of a lifetime achievement award for Clint.  He deserves them for a lot of movies he's made, but certainly not this one.

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[1, 3]","&quot;Unforgiven&quot; contains a gritty realism and psychological insight that is distinct in any film, not just in Westerns. In this sense, the film is a tremendous accomplishment for Clint Eastwood as an actor and a director. Eastwood plays a gun fighter whose career has largely subsided as the civilizing process has begun to displace the frontier mentality in the American West. Eastwood is hired by some prostitutes to settle a score with an abusive client. He and his party gun down the person but in the process they run afoul of the town's sheriff (masterfully played by Gene Hackman) who has legally sanctioned gun fighting of any sort. When Eastwood's partner is killed by the sheriff's posse, Eastwood returns to the town and single-handedly confronts them. The battle that ensues is somewhat unrealistic (Eastwood kills several men including the sheriff) but makes sense on a symbolic level. The untrammeled spirit of the frontier confronts its civilizing nemesis and wins even as it becomes an extinct phenomenon. The intense realism and Eastwood's subtle, understated performance are what make the film work. So much of the film is presented in a plain understated fashion, that by the time we get to the symbolic conclusion we still believe it is real.After the gun battle, Eastwood pours himself a whiskey with his back to the door and his unloaded shotgun under his arm as the terrified survivors of the posse hide between buildings outside. When he is ready to leave, Eastwood shouts a warning that he will kill anyone he sees and if he is opposed, he will kill the individual and his wife. He leaves the bar, mounts his horse and rides off into the darkness in full view of the terrified posse.Eastwood's departure is more than just a finale for the film. As he rides into the darkness he takes with him the individual will to settle disputes with violence. The defeated and humiliated posse survives with its mandate to expropriate the individual's recourse to violence. Eastwood may have won the last gunfight, but even he cannot prevent the elimination of private justice and the state's consolidation and ownership of violence.",5,"Great as a film, not just a Western",980899200,"01 31, 2001",2001,2152,"['quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'gritty', 'realism', 'psychological', 'insight', 'distinct', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'Westerns', 'sense', 'film', 'tremendous', 'accomplishment', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'actor', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'gun', 'fighter', 'career', 'largely', 'subsided', 'civilizing', 'process', 'begun', 'displace', 'frontier', 'mentality', 'American', 'West', 'Eastwood', 'hired', 'prostitutes', 'settle', 'score', 'abusive', 'client', 'party', 'gun', 'person', 'process', 'run', 'afoul', 'town', 'sheriff', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'legally', 'sanctioned', 'gun', 'fighting', 'sort', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'partner', 'killed', 'sheriff', 'posse', 'Eastwood', 'town', 'single-handedly', 'confronts', 'battle', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'Eastwood', 'several', 'men', 'including', 'sheriff', 'sense', 'symbolic', 'level', 'untrammeled', 'spirit', 'frontier', 'confronts', 'civilizing', 'nemesis', 'wins', 'even', 'extinct', 'phenomenon', 'intense', 'realism', 'Eastwood', 'subtle', 'understated', 'performance', 'are', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'presented', 'plain', 'understated', 'fashion', 'time', 'get', 'symbolic', 'conclusion', 'still', 'believe', 'real.After', 'gun', 'battle', 'Eastwood', 'whiskey', 'back', 'door', 'unloaded', 'shotgun', 'arm', 'terrified', 'survivors', 'posse', 'hide', 'buildings', 'outside', 'When', 'ready', 'leave', 'Eastwood', 'warning', 'will', 'kill', 'anyone', 'opposed', 'will', 'kill', 'individual', 'wife', 'bar', 'horse', 'rides', 'off', 'darkness', 'full', 'view', 'terrified', 'posse.Eastwood', 'departure', 'more', 'just', 'finale', 'film', 'darkness', 'individual', 'will', 'settle', 'disputes', 'violence', 'defeated', 'humiliated', 'posse', 'survives', 'mandate', 'expropriate', 'individual', 'recourse', 'violence', 'Eastwood', 'may', 'have', 'won', 'last', 'gunfight', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'prevent', 'elimination', 'private', 'justice', 'state', 'consolidation', 'ownership', 'violence']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91033,A2DE249NY4SMSN,0790729644,Chad Taylor,"[3, 4]","In a true sense, Clint Eastwood & writer David Peoples have created the first Anti-western in this tale of violence, vengeance and half-truths. Eastwood plays the anti-hero William Munny, once a vicious killer, now reformed eking out an existence for his two motherless children by pig farming. To save his children from this hapless fate he agrees to go on one last mercenary killing to avenge a prostitute whose face, eyes, ears and teets were cut up by some clients or so he's heard. But the truth of it is less than the fiction as the whore's story, like so many tales from the old west, is continually embellished. Urged on by the raging Schofield Kid, a haplessly poor-sighted lad who only dreams of the notoriety his killing might bring, Munny enlists the aid of Morgan Freeman, his old partner. Munny so rusty he can no longer aim well and so long out of the saddle he can't even stay on his horse, he heads out with the other two avenging or fallen angels to Big Whiskey to hunt down the killers for the promise of the whore's gold. Although some might consider the character insignificant, Richard Harris, as English Bob, the Duke (Duck) of Death, further illustrates the fallacy of the old west allure. Gene Hackman as the sadistic Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff of Big Whiskey, further blurs the lines between good and evil as the townspeople wince from the pain he inflicts on English Bob, Munny and finally on Ned Logan (Freeman). Frances Fisher, a lone voice crying in the wilderness, demands justice for the unfortunate girl and all women despite their station in life. Saul Rubinek as an old west biographer, is reminiscent of those mesmerized by car wrecks or burning buildings. A cub-reporter, only concerned for the most engrossing story, he hops from supposed hero to supposed hero never once looking beneath the surface of their stories. In his review, Leonard Maltin feels the movie drags in the middle, but the slow paced path the trio takes amidst the beautiful countryside, like the gentle but haunting score, only serves as the antithesis to the movie's impending violent conclusion. When I first saw this movie at the theater, I whispered to my companion ""this is going to win best picture."" It also went on to win Eastwood best director and Hackman best supporting actor. Whether you love westerns or hate them this film will satisfy you. There's no glamour in killing, but Munny (Eastwood), whether fueled by his sense of justice or just whiskey, marshals up the malicious character buried deep within him and perhaps buried deep within all of us. Finally, as this morality play draws to a close, we are asked the question why Claudia, Munny's deceased wife a woman not without prospects, ever ""loved"" such a desperate character. Perhaps he, like all the characters, had it coming. Just like we all do, even if we are unforgiven.D Wood & J Mark see this as some allegory for America or banter that it's liberals playing conservatives.  They need to grow up just like the Western did.  For years Hollywood portrayed the Western as a pristeen fantasy place with white hats chasing after the black hats, but it's just not that clear cut except in their own little minds emphasis on little.  One moral they seem to have missed from Unforgiven is that although killing is a terrible thing to do, sometimes it's the only thing that you must do, but it's not the ONLY thing you should do.  I am sure these idiots would bring popcorn and raisinettes to an execution because they're just those types of people.  And those who find it slow (and you know who you are), you're probably under the age of 10 or at least mentally under 10 and can't see that it's more exciting to be lead down a prim rose path and then shockingly be pelted with individual or random acts of violence instead of your typical slasher movie with a spewing of blood every minute.  If you didn't wince from what Sheriff Bill Dagget did to the Duck or William Munny, you've never experienced pain.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Lone Wolf & Cub series with its spew after spew of blood, but you really can't take them too seriously.

91034,ACBFF25XJC2T7,0790729644,Choice Critic,"[1, 1]","This is the rare, modern western masterpiece that Hollywood seems otherwise incapable of producing anymore. The plot is spare. A notorious ex-killer, William Munny (Clint Eastwood), reformed by his now-deceased wife, is running an unsuccessful pig farm when he is recruited by an aspiring young gun, Kid Schofield (James Woolvet).Kid wants Munny to join him to kill two ranch hands in order to collect a $500 bounty. The reward is offered by the prostitutes of a brothel.  One of the ranch hands has disfigured the face of one of their girls. Reluctant at first because of the memory of his beloved wife, Munny decides to join the Kid in order to collect the money in order to try to save his farm and provide for two children.  Munny then recruits his friend, former partner, and expert rifleman Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).Gene Hackman, as ""Little Bill"", the town sheriff of Big Whiskey, Wyoming where the crime took place is the formidable obstacle standing in their way.  He has already meted out his form of justice to the ranch hands and is not about to countenance someone else doing so.  This is vividly and violently seen in a cameo by Richard Harris who is the first bounty hunter to arrive.  Hackman's performance, combining his easy charm with a vicious ruthlessness is terrific.  He deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.The dialogue is simple and direct in the John Wayne tradition.  However, Eastwood's Munny is no Hondo out to tame the wild west.  He is a product of the dark side of his time and environment. The mood is dark (technically, sometimes the lighting is too dark).  At his age Eastwood is the perfectly grizzled cowboy and has an unforgiving, cold-eyed meanness that slowly reemerges as the movie progresses. It fully emerges in a breathtakingly violent, unrelenting brutality in the final scene in the bar at Big Whiskey where the prostitutes reside and ply their trade.Woolvetz and Freeman are excellent in their supporting roles.  But this classic is dominated by the outsize personas of Eastwood and Hackman.  If you like the old cowboy movies, where the emphasis is on old west mores and not computer-generated pyrotechnics, you will treasure this movie as we treasure the old western mythology.",5,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2248,"['rare', 'modern', 'western', 'masterpiece', 'Hollywood', 'otherwise', 'incapable', 'producing', 'anymore', 'plot', 'spare', 'notorious', 'ex-killer', 'William', 'Munny', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'reformed', 'now-deceased', 'wife', 'running', 'unsuccessful', 'pig', 'farm', 'when', 'recruited', 'aspiring', 'young', 'gun', 'Kid', 'Schofield', 'James', 'Woolvet', '.Kid', 'Munny', 'join', 'kill', 'two', 'ranch', 'hands', 'order', 'collect', '500', 'bounty', 'reward', 'offered', 'prostitutes', 'brothel', 'One', 'ranch', 'disfigured', 'face', 'one', 'girls', 'Reluctant', 'first', 'memory', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Munny', 'join', 'Kid', 'order', 'collect', 'money', 'order', 'try', 'save', 'farm', 'provide', 'two', 'children', 'Munny', 'then', 'friend', 'former', 'partner', 'expert', 'rifleman', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '.Gene', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'crime', 'took', 'place', 'formidable', 'obstacle', 'standing', 'way', 'already', 'meted', 'out', 'form', 'justice', 'ranch', 'hands', 'not', 'countenance', 'someone', 'else', 'doing', 'so', 'vividly', 'violently', 'seen', 'cameo', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'who', 'first', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'arrive', 'Hackman', 'performance', 'combining', 'easy', 'charm', 'vicious', 'ruthlessness', 'terrific', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor.The', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'direct', 'John', 'Wayne', 'tradition', 'However', 'Eastwood', 'Munny', 'Hondo', 'tame', 'wild', 'west', 'product', 'dark', 'side', 'time', 'environment', 'mood', 'dark', 'technically', 'sometimes', 'lighting', 'too', 'dark', 'age', 'Eastwood', 'perfectly', 'grizzled', 'cowboy', 'unforgiving', 'cold-eyed', 'meanness', 'slowly', 'movie', 'fully', 'breathtakingly', 'violent', 'unrelenting', 'brutality', 'final', 'scene', 'bar', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'where', 'prostitutes', 'reside', 'ply', 'trade.Woolvetz', 'Freeman', 'are', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'classic', 'dominated', 'outsize', 'personas', 'Eastwood', 'Hackman', 'like', 'old', 'cowboy', 'movies', 'where', 'emphasis', 'old', 'west', 'mores', 'not', 'computer-generated', 'pyrotechnics', 'will', 'treasure', 'movie', 'treasure', 'old', 'western', 'mythology']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91043,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,0790729644,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Despite the fact he's one of the most respected actors/directors around, the films that I've seen him direct haven't really been that good for me. I despised Mystic River and I didn't get why there was so much love for Million Dollar Baby. However, most people will just end up saying ""well then watch Unforgiven"" so not being one to dismiss something outright, I thought sure, why not? Well I don't regret it one bit. While it's certainly a different western than others I've seen, that's kind of what makes it unique as well: a character-based study set in the West as opposed to outlaws tearing up the Wild West.After being ridiculed by the size of his manhood, Quick Mike cuts up a prostitute named Delilah, leaving her face scarred. Quick Mike and his partner however get punished by the town sheriff, Little Bob, by giving up some of their ponies. Outraged at the lack of severity in the punishment, the mother figure Alice gets the other women to pool their savings and offer a bounty on the 2.Reluctantly answering the call is William Munny, a pig farmer living with his 2 children. It's a different life for him and one he desperately needs since not only did his wife pass but he used to be a very ruthless killer once. Since the money's too good to pass up, he goes for it and along the way, he brings his buddy Ned, who's quite the sharpshooter. Only things don't go exactly as planned since not only is a no firearm policy heavily enforced but the 2 men are actually protected. For both this is not just a simple bounty and the whole thing plays out like a morality play with no clear winners.One thing that first hits you about the film is how untypical of a western it is. Unlike, let's say, Tombstone, this town almost seems eerily quiet and without life. There's a stillness that's new to me and I liked seeing it. Reminded me of visiting my grandparent's cabin where it was just you and nothing else. It's also perfectly shot with very lush camera shots of valleys and the skies. Also, the film doesn't really have that huge gun shootout you often see. For some, it might be disappointing since gun battles are brief and not as dynamic as say, Open Range's is or other ones. It does set the film from most other ones since there's not really a melancholy but a certain relaxed feeling or a subdued feeling rather than big dynamic Wild West gunplay.Acting of course is spot-on from Eastwood to Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. While Richard Harris does do a great job in his scenes, the actual character can probably be taken out and it wouldn't do a huge blow to the film. It mainly shows what happens to people who try to go for the bounty or break the no firearm policy but it's not ultimately that important. Also, there's a young sidekick William and Ned take along with them that was so irritating I wish one of them would shoot him and say ""shut up already"". The pacing also might get people, since as I said, it's more subdued than the more energetic Tombstone was. Besides the might-be troublesome pacing and that annoying brat, the film's quite great regardless.The film in a way isn't like most Best Picture winners where they're larger-than-life and big and epic but it's also well-made with surprising direction by Eastwood and a good message concerning guns. So far it's the best Eastwood film I've seen although I haven't seen Flags or Iwo Jima yet.",5,"One of the best westerns around?

91045,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0790729644,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 9]","Unforgiven is a strong, bleak movie. It's also a credit to Clint Eastwood's self confidence as a producer/director and ability as an actor that he cast Gene Hackman in such a showy role and then was able to stand up to Hackman's performance. For me, it was those two heavy-weight performances, balancing each other, that gave the movie its energy.However, like so many movies today, it is lo-o-ong. I think it could have lost 20 minutes and been an even better movie, just by trimming a minute or two, or more, from almost every scene.I'm not sure how vital the Morgan Freeman role is to the movie, other than providing a kind of weary humanity. He provides the excuse for Eastwood to throw off the skin of good citizen that his wife made him wear and become the killer he always was, but I think almost anything could have been used to do that. Without Freeman, I could see Little Bill bringing the madam and the scar-faced prostitute to the bar to once and for all find out where Eastwood and the kid are. They are secretly followed by one of the other prostitutes. Little Bill hits them a few times while his pals watch, then the madam loses her temper and refuses to be intimidated anymore by Little Bill's bullying. She attacks him verbally and accuses him in front of the others of being impotent whenever he has sneaked into the whorehouse. This enrages Little Bill. He grabs his whip and beats them to death in a pscho-sexual rage. The more he beats them the more he sweats and gets red in the face. It obvious he's having a sexual release while he's hitting them. Even his pals are uneasy and finally pull him away. The prostitute who had been secretly watching is horrified and scared to death. She knows where Eastwood is and goes to find him. Eastwood had sympathy for the madam and the other prostitute; he saw them as life's losers just as he was. And he decides to hell with trying to play by the rules. He mounts up and heads for the show down.I'm only half joking. Some sort of sexual inadequacy would help explain Little Bill's character and his need to be the alpha male. I can't remember if there was any explanation for Little Bill's behavior other than that he was just a bad guy.I think Unforgiven deserved the acclaim it received, and certainly Eastwood did.",5,A First-Rate Movie That Just Happens To Be A Western,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2282,"['Unforgiven', 'strong', 'bleak', 'movie', 'also', 'credit', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'self', 'confidence', 'producer/director', 'ability', 'actor', 'cast', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'such', 'showy', 'role', 'then', 'was', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'Hackman', 'performance', 'was', 'two', 'heavy-weight', 'performances', 'balancing', 'other', 'gave', 'movie', 'energy.However', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'lo-o-ong', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'lost', '20', 'minutes', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'just', 'trimming', 'minute', 'two', 'more', 'almost', 'scene.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'vital', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'role', 'movie', 'other', 'providing', 'kind', 'weary', 'humanity', 'excuse', 'Eastwood', 'throw', 'off', 'skin', 'good', 'citizen', 'wife', 'made', 'wear', 'become', 'killer', 'always', 'was', 'think', 'almost', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'do', 'Freeman', 'could', 'see', 'Little', 'Bill', 'bringing', 'madam', 'scar-faced', 'prostitute', 'bar', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'kid', 'are', 'are', 'secretly', 'followed', 'one', 'other', 'prostitutes', 'Little', 'Bill', 'few', 'times', 'pals', 'watch', 'then', 'madam', 'temper', 'be', 'intimidated', 'anymore', 'Little', 'Bill', 'bullying', 'verbally', 'front', 'others', 'being', 'impotent', 'whenever', 'sneaked', 'whorehouse', 'Little', 'Bill', 'grabs', 'whip', 'beats', 'death', 'pscho-sexual', 'rage', 'more', 'more', 'red', 'face', 'obvious', 'having', 'sexual', 'release', 'hitting', 'Even', 'pals', 'are', 'uneasy', 'finally', 'pull', 'away', 'prostitute', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'secretly', 'watching', 'horrified', 'scared', 'death', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'find', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'sympathy', 'madam', 'other', 'prostitute', 'saw', 'life', 'losers', 'just', 'was', 'hell', 'trying', 'play', 'rules', 'up', 'heads', 'show', ""'m"", 'only', 'half', 'joking', 'sort', 'sexual', 'inadequacy', 'would', 'help', 'explain', 'Little', 'Bill', 'character', 'need', 'be', 'alpha', 'male', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'explanation', 'Little', 'Bill', 'behavior', 'other', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'guy.I', 'think', 'Unforgiven', 'deserved', 'acclaim', 'received', 'certainly', 'Eastwood', 'did']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91048,A3DN9249F3X716,0790729644,Corey Lidster,"[1, 1]","There are few moments in the history of film more gripping than the final act of Unforgiven, beginning with the moment Munny (played by Eastwood) realizes that Ned is, in fact, dead, and takes the whiskey bottle from the hands of the Schofield kid without saying another word. There is a nihilistic thrill as William Munny embraces alcohol and firearms and rides back into town, something that taps the oldest parts of our reptile brain, accessing archetypal memories of heroes like Achilles, who did nothing particularly 'heroic' in the modern sense -- he was an (almost) indestructible killing machine, who sulked and retired from the killing field after Agamemnon took the slave he won in battle. He returned to it as an avenging angel, chasing down and killing the noble Hector after the Trojan prince defeated the Achaean's cousin Patrocles in single combat, mistaking him for Achilles when the frustrated young warrior, tired of watching the battle rage without him, donned the famous armor and helm belonging to the son of Peleus. In the same way, William Munny the infamous gunslinger who has 'killed everything that walks or crawls, at one time or another', retired from his days as an alcoholic killer after falling in love with the young woman who introduced him to the Bible, becoming his wife and the mother of his children, is enticed to return to the way of the gun after a wannabe-outlaw suggests they join forces to assassinate two men with money on their heads. Although the sweet-natured young prostitute who is mutilated by a drunken cowboy is certainly no Helen of Troy, the Schofield Kid no Odysseus, Ned Logan no Patrocles, Little Bill Daggett no Hector, and William Munny no Achilles, screenwriter David Peoples created a story with all the power and tragic grandeur of The Iliad, a myth of the American West that loosely and perhaps unconsciously derives from Homer's first masterpiece. But Unforgiven's raw, visceral power comes from the brilliantly-scripted dialogue and character development Peoples maps out. His entire story is a deconstruction of the mythologies of the Old West, where brave lawmen keep the peace, enforcing a rough justice in which Outlaws who choose to live by the gun die by the gun. In the character of the Big-city reporter we see the origins of these myths. He follows the cold-blooded English Bob, a deadly gunslinger who works for the railroads, faithfully copying Bob's tales of his own heroic gunfights. When the train arrives in Big Whiskey, however, the town run by Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff employs one of his typically inconsistent punishments, beating English Bob brutally for failing to give up his guns, in defiance of a town ordinance, when first asked by one of Bill's deputies. The reporter-biographer abandon's Bob to make Little Bill his new subject, who is very forthcoming about the failings of anyone but himself. His accounts of some of English Bob's exploits peel back the shiny surface of lies, to reveal a psychopath with a steady hand who worked for the railroads so he could murder Chinese laborers and slake his thirst for blood. Little Bill, played by Gene Hackman in one of my all-time favorite performances, is a complex character based on legendary lawmen like Wyatt Earp. His confidence and charisma inspires loyalty in his deputies and townsfolk, and the biographer -- played by Saul Rubinek in another standout performance -- believes he has finally worked his way up the food chain to find the sort of feared and fearless lawman he's been looking for. Bill pulls back the curtain on the realities of a gunfight, and avoids braggadocio in a manner that suggests he doen't need it. But Bills' heavy-handed and arbitrary punishments are the catalyst for all the bloodshed that follows. His view of law and justice are reflected in his attempts at home-building; his out-of-square walls, uneven floor, and leaking roof are not enough to convince him that his attempt at carpentry was a failure. And when the poor young prostitute has had har hard life made a thousand times harder by the cowboy who cuts up her face, Little Bill decides that the penalty will be a fine, a few horses, paid not to the injured girl, but to Skinny the brothel owner. This blatant injustice, and the fact that Little Bill views them as property no better than horses, inspires the women at the brothel to place a bounty on both cowboys' heads, despite the other man's attempt to stop his partner and disgust at what he did. Nevertheless, he will die unforgiven. The prostitutes will be unforgiven for who they are and what they did. Ned will die unforgiven, simply for riding with Munny. And when Munny rides back into Big Whiskey, no one is forgiven, least of all Daggett, who tortured, killed and displayed the corpse of Ned Roundtree, Munny's only friend. After wounding Bill, killing his deputies, and sending the rest of the posse fleeing into the night, Munny realizes Bill is alive and steps on a wrist before he can aim his pistol. He then points the shotgun into Daggett's face. &#34;I don't deserve this... I built a house...&#34; Little Bill rasps, staring into the double-barrel inches away. After emptying the bottle of liquor on the ride, William Munny seems more terrifyingly sober than we've yet seen him. In Eastwoods' inimitable whisper, he delivers the line that sums up the centuries of bloodshed that accompanied the settling of the American frontier: &#34;Deserves got nothing to do with it.&#34;

91056,A1R8AO9XASQ15C,0790729644,Daniel A. Marsh,"[6, 8]","That's how I would describe &quot;Unforgiven&quot; -- as hard as the title implies. It's a classic, no doubt, every bit as good as Eastwood's other great film, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&quot; maybe a little better.It's taken me years to fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of this movie. Eastwood himself refused to make it until after he'd reached a certain age, and it takes a certain level of maturity to accept that this movie HAS NO HEROES, that it is about death and dying, that it is about a way of life that has long vanished ... a way that, in the hardboiled view of this movie, wasn't all that great to begin with.&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the few successful films that has no sympathetic characters. Eastwood's William Munny is a criminal, a thug whose late-in-life recognition of his own dastardly deeds does not necessarily clear him of them (hence the title). His buddy, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is no saint either, simply too old and guilt-ridden to live the outlaw life any longer. Likewise, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett, and whatever happened to him?) is the cowboy equivalent of a punk, a gangsta wannabe with more mouth than guts (he's the only character in the movie to experience a moral revelation).Which brings us to the &quot;bad guy,&quot; Little Bill Daggett, played with clear-eyed hate by Gene Hackman. What a complex character. The guy just wants to build a house and watch the sunset over his coffee. He can't hammer two nails into a board. He wants law and order in his frontier town, and he'll get it if he has to beat a man to death. He's cowardly -- once he's disarmed a man and surrounded him with trigger-happy &quot;deputies,&quot; then he lets fly with his fists -- but maybe he's just playing a dangerous game the smart way. And he is smart. Smarter than Will Munny, only not quite as lucky.Let us not forget the prostitutes who set the plot in motion. Strawberry Alice seems to desire bloody revenge far more than Delilah, the girl whose face is slashed by the cowboys. All of the women in the film are hard, brutal, deceptive, obsessed with avenging themselves of the very livelihood that pays the bounty. Not a likeable or sympathetic character in the bunch.Finally, there's English Bob (Richard Harris). Eastwood establishes that he's come to Big Whiskey for the bounty so subtly that, believe it or not, I missed it the first time I saw the movie. (Maybe it's a little too subtle -- no dialogue refers to his motivation.) English Bob gits the tar whupped out of him, but he's not a good guy, just a &quot;living legend&quot; whose legend has finally caught up with him.There is a journey in the movie, but it's an anti-heroic journey with only one outcome: that Will Munny will actually lose his battle with his demons and commit murder in exchange for filthy lucre. (The character's name is not a coincidence.) Not exactly a healthy outlook on the human condition.&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is what certain critics mean when they describe a movie as &quot;dark,&quot; only here the description actually applies. It is dark, and it does not contain a glimmer of hope for anything or anyone. &quot;Deserve's got nothing to do with it,&quot; Munny tells Little Bill. And yet everybody in the movie gets exactly what they deserve ... including Will Munny, who's left alone with the demons of his past.The movie is great precisely because of its pessimism; I don't know another way to put it. It is the death of the Western; it is also sad and moving, physically beautiful and vividly acted. Ten years ago, I sorta kinda felt &quot;Unforgiven&quot; didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar.

91057,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,0790729644,Daniel Hurley,"[4, 5]","This is Eastwood's best film, a purely adult western epic. It is a gritty portrayal of the real west of the 1880's. Eastwood plays an aging reformed notoriously violent and alcoholic outlaw who has reformed due to the love and care of a ""good woman"" who has long since died. Widowed with children and down on his luck, Eastwood is tempted to ride again one more time for a money stake to help his family escape his failing economic situation. The story intially takes place in a fledging frontier twon called Big Whiskey, Wyoming. The film starts abruptly and violently as a cowboy defaces a prostitute, termed ""whore"". He and his less guilty and innocent partner are pardoned by sheriff ""Litle Bill"" who, in ironic contrast to once bad guy Eastwood, has a violent, spontaneous sadistic temper. The whores are taken back by the injustice and they place a bounty on the heads of the cowboys and that sets the stage for Eastwood's rentry into one last violent run with the aide of his longtime and also reformed colleague played by Morgan freeman. The two reformers killed and robbed many years ago and are rusty mechanical and with the business of committing violence that is slowly evident. Sparking Eastwood back to this mission is the young punk nephew, played by very well by Jaimz Woolvett, of an old friend who seeks out the legendary killer William Muney (Eastwood) to assist in killing the cowboys and collecting the bounty. And there is the seeds of your story, a reformed rusty old gunman with his veteran partner catching up to a young hot headed kid headed for a collision with Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman). The ironic twist is that good guy Hackman can break into an abusive violent rage that Eastwood gave up in his past along with, perhaps the fuel that opened him to violence, alcohol.The other irony is the introduction of a writer who folows, with limited loyalty, one legendary western folk heroe after another, writing stories that he later finds could be contrived or gross exagerations, which the writer even allows may be exagerated even when the real truth is known. Like many a true alcoholic, Eastwood can barely remember his past (reformed alcoholic comic actor Sid Ceasar wrote in his biography that he suffered blackout and couldn't remember his own best skits) but everyone else can as his past ; however incredible, was fact not fiction. This film is a sensitive portrayal of the wst and two different men, Eastwood and Hackman, ironically trying to live peaceful lives that collide violently due to circumstances. This is not an action film, although there is plenty at the end, but an adult look at life and death where killing is not easy, simple and without remorse and people simply don't die suddenly and disappear like in a Rambo movie.The climax builds into over the last 30 minutes and the action suddenly accelerates as Eastwood is forced to take on a vengeance role, transforming to his past, as he contemplates his direct confrantation with Hackman, two men now with the equal potential for extraordinary violence. Some people miss the point of this film, thus it is worth watching at least twice. Individuals don't always react heroically to confrontation, as Hackman's Little Bill character points out during the early part of the film, and when confronted with a truely violent and notorious outlaw, you will see different reactions unfold, that although a movie, they are not too surprising.The dialogue is vintage Eastwood, a lot said in a few words, and those lines are memorable such as when the kids says ""I guess he had it coming"", Eastwood responds, ""We all have it coming kid"".Richard Harris is also excellent as ""English Bob"" and his encounter with Hackman early in the film helps reveal the true character of Little Bill, his good and efficient side and the uncontrollable temper that can erupt.The DVD has wide screen and regular TV viewing.",5,"""It's a hell of a thing, killing a man""",1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,3903,"['Eastwood', 'best', 'film', 'purely', 'adult', 'western', 'epic', 'gritty', 'portrayal', 'real', 'west', '1880', 'Eastwood', 'aging', 'reformed', 'notoriously', 'violent', 'alcoholic', 'outlaw', 'who', 'reformed', 'due', 'love', 'care', 'good', 'woman', 'who', 'long', 'died', 'Widowed', 'children', 'down', 'luck', 'Eastwood', 'tempted', 'ride', 'again', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'money', 'stake', 'help', 'family', 'escape', 'failing', 'economic', 'situation', 'story', 'intially', 'place', 'fledging', 'frontier', 'twon', 'called', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Wyoming', 'film', 'abruptly', 'violently', 'cowboy', 'prostitute', 'termed', 'whore', 'less', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'partner', 'are', 'pardoned', 'sheriff', 'Litle', 'Bill', 'who', 'ironic', 'contrast', 'once', 'bad', 'guy', 'Eastwood', 'violent', 'spontaneous', 'sadistic', 'temper', 'whores', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'injustice', 'place', 'bounty', 'heads', 'cowboys', 'stage', 'Eastwood', 'rentry', 'one', 'last', 'violent', 'run', 'aide', 'longtime', 'also', 'reformed', 'colleague', 'played', 'Morgan', 'freeman', 'two', 'reformers', 'killed', 'robbed', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'rusty', 'mechanical', 'business', 'committing', 'violence', 'slowly', 'evident', 'Sparking', 'Eastwood', 'back', 'mission', 'young', 'punk', 'nephew', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'out', 'legendary', 'killer', 'William', 'Muney', 'Eastwood', 'assist', 'killing', 'cowboys', 'collecting', 'bounty', 'seeds', 'story', 'reformed', 'rusty', 'old', 'gunman', 'veteran', 'partner', 'catching', 'up', 'young', 'hot', 'headed', 'kid', 'headed', 'collision', 'Sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'ironic', 'twist', 'good', 'guy', 'Hackman', 'can', 'break', 'abusive', 'violent', 'rage', 'Eastwood', 'gave', 'up', 'past', 'perhaps', 'fuel', 'opened', 'violence', 'other', 'irony', 'introduction', 'writer', 'who', 'limited', 'loyalty', 'one', 'legendary', 'western', 'folk', 'heroe', 'writing', 'stories', 'later', 'could', 'be', 'contrived', 'gross', 'exagerations', 'writer', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'exagerated', 'even', 'when', 'real', 'truth', 'known', 'many', 'true', 'alcoholic', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'past', 'reformed', 'alcoholic', 'comic', 'actor', 'Sid', 'Ceasar', 'wrote', 'biography', 'suffered', 'blackout', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'own', 'best', 'skits', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'past', 'however', 'incredible', 'was', 'fact', 'not', 'fiction', 'film', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'wst', 'two', 'different', 'men', 'Eastwood', 'Hackman', 'ironically', 'trying', 'live', 'peaceful', 'lives', 'collide', 'violently', 'due', 'circumstances', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'plenty', 'end', 'adult', 'look', 'life', 'death', 'where', 'killing', 'not', 'easy', 'simple', 'remorse', 'people', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'Rambo', 'movie.The', 'climax', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'action', 'suddenly', 'Eastwood', 'forced', 'take', 'vengeance', 'role', 'transforming', 'past', 'direct', 'confrantation', 'Hackman', 'two', 'men', 'now', 'equal', 'potential', 'extraordinary', 'violence', 'people', 'miss', 'point', 'film', 'thus', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'twice', 'Individuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'react', 'heroically', 'confrontation', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'character', 'points', 'out', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'confronted', 'truely', 'violent', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'will', 'see', 'different', 'reactions', 'unfold', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'surprising.The', 'dialogue', 'vintage', 'Eastwood', 'lot', 'said', 'few', 'words', 'lines', 'are', 'memorable', 'such', 'when', 'kids', 'guess', 'had', 'coming', 'Eastwood', 'have', 'coming', 'kid', '.Richard', 'Harris', 'also', 'excellent', 'English', 'Bob', 'encounter', 'Hackman', 'early', 'film', 'reveal', 'true', 'character', 'Little', 'Bill', 'good', 'efficient', 'side', 'uncontrollable', 'temper', 'can', 'erupt.The', 'DVD', 'wide', 'screen', 'regular', 'TV', 'viewing']",Unforgiven Snap Case

And best of all this movie has QUITE the payoff.  It WORKS.  Mostly Hollywood stinks.  Not here.  And frankly, Clint Eastwood rocks.  He plays his part to the T.Okay, two more little criticisms:1) The scene where Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood discuss sex and masturbation came out of left field and deflated the reality of the moment.

I doubt anyone can direct a real western after this one. The whole american mythology created around the 1830-1890 period is  visited by Eastwood and exorcised. Heroes are no more than lousy  story-tellers, gunfighters must have glasses to shoot right and there  aren't good guys and bad guys anymore : there are only human beings like  you and me who kill for money or revenge. If the hero does survive in a  fight, it's only because he's lucky and not because he's the good one.

K,"[0, 0]","UNFORGIVEN**** Out of 5Release Date- August 7th, 1992Running Time- 131-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- David Webb PeoplesDirector- Clint EastwoodStarring- Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Frances Fisher, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Anna Levine and Gene Hackman as Little Bill DaggettUnforgiven was Clint Eastwood's big return to the Western genre and is by considered by many as one of the all time greats of the genre and won four Academy Awards, which included best editing for Joel Cox, Gene Hackman for best supporting actor, best director for Eastwood and best picture and while Unforgiven is deserving of it's praise the movie isn't without it's flaws and quite honestly as much as I liked the movie it wouldn't make my top 5 Eastwood movies.The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is quite solid with some really great characters. Unforgiven does feature plenty of action, but the movie is driven more by the characters rather than the action. The characters are all mostly well written for, but some aren't as interesting as others. None of the characters are boring or anything, but some work better than others. The script is well thought out and works on pretty much every levelClint Eastwood won his first Oscar for Unforgiven and he delivers a very well made movie. As I stated even with the action, Unforgiven is much more driven by the characters and Eastwood does a great job at brining the script to life. His scenes are generally well paced and he delivers some great action, suspense and real life human emotions. The only problem I really had was the running time. I personally felt the 134-minute running time was a little overly long. While none of the scenes are filler scenes and they all add to the plot and to the characters I did feel a few minutes here and there could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie at all.But regardless Eastwood delivers an excellent movie and the final act was nothing short of brilliant. The suspense level is excellent and while the shoot outs don't drag out, but they aren't too brief either and while the whole movie was well done I think the final act is where Eastwood really shines as director.Besides directing and producing Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny and this might be the best character Eastwood has ever played or at least the most complex. The thing about Eastwood is he is a great actor in the sense that he's best known for that tough guy role and even in his lighter movies he still has that tough guy persona and you'll be hard pressed to find someone better at that role than Eastwood, but he doesn't have a lot of range as an actor. That isn't a knock against him since he's great at what he does, but in Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood shows more range than anything before or after this movie.William Munny was a cold blooded killer who once married changed his ways and is seeking a sort of redemption. He knows what he's done in the past and he knows it was wrong, but what's done is done and in many ways William Munny is a broken man since the death of his wife. William Munny may not be as cool and entertaining as say Dirty Harry, but like I said he is the most complex of all Eastwood's characters. There was a lot of depth to William Munny and Eastwood really delivers a performance of a lifetime. We've seen characters like this before, but Eastwood as director and actor manages to make it seem fresh and different. Clint was nominated for best actor, but lost out to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman, but I personally feel of all the nominated actors that year Eastwood was by far the best with a very complex character.The supporting cast is excellent with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, who like Munny has done bad things in the past and is trying to put it behind him. Gene Hackman like always is great and was very deserving of his Oscar win, but I don't understand how Freeman wasn't nominated. Jaimz Woolvett as The Schofield Kid nearly steals the show as a wannabe gunslinger.Like I said Unforgiven is a great picture and it's one of those movies as I think back to I like it even more, but still wouldn't place it in my top 5 Eastwood flicks. Unforgiven though is a really complex movie with excellent characters and like I said Eastwood is great at what he does, but doesn't have a lot of range, but here he shows all that range and more. William Munny is truly a great character and despite any problems I had with Unforgiven it comes highly recommended to Eastwood and Western fans.The Blu-ray has excellent quality and makes the movie look like it was done recently and not in 1992. The extra features are great with some good behind the scenes, plus the documentary Eastwood on Eastwood, which is a must see for fans of the Iconic actor.",4,Excellent,1233446400,"02 1,

91066,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790729644,David Baldwin,"[3, 4]","In the twilight of Clint Eastwood's career an epiphany came to him.  The western types that he played in most of his films were essentially bad people.  This film is something of an atonement for those films.  His character, William Munney, after a life as a killer, is amidst his new life following the death of his sainted wife as an unsuccessful farmer.  Word comes to him that in a nearby town that a prostitute was mutilated by a some cowhands and a reward is being offered by her co-workers for the murder of the cowpokes.  Munney rationalizes taking up this offer by thinking that these boys are vicious and deserve to die and that doing so would not make him a bad man.  Before Munney can collect his reward, though, he has to get through the peace-loving sheriff, Little Bill, who will make sure nobody collects on the reward no matter how many beatings he has to administer.  The cynic could say that Eastwood made his bread and butter off violent western types and this is an attempt to cater to politically correct types.  I give Eastwood the benefit of the doubt here because this may be the best performance of his career and this film is so well crafted.  Gene Hackman is more than his equal as the sadistic sheriff.

First is its brutally realistic depiction of violence and killing in the Old West.  Second is the situation of causing a reformed man to revisit the behavior of his past in order to survive.There are no glorious killings in Unforgiven.  This movie lays to rest the notion of high-noon showdowns or fighting for honor.  Executions, ambushes, and agonizing gut-wounds are the staple methods of attack.  Alcohol, pride, and gold fuel most of the violence in the town of Big Whisky.  Most of the scenes with violence are very one-sided, further lending credence to this film.The main character is almost certainly a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Through the efforts of his late wife, he has been able to eliminate his psychopathic tendencies, fueled for the most part by alcohol.  His sober days are blanched by regret and remorse over the people he has killed.  He is for all intents and purposes an unsuccessful farmer out trying to collect a bounty.  But when things go horribly wrong, he is forced to return to the behavior and actions of his past to survive.

It's gritty, rugged, brutal, dirty, inhumane--yet tender and poignant when it needs to be.  You can't beat Clint Eastwood as both actor and director; fellow cinematic heavyweights Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris give UNFORGIVEN plenty of star power.  And the story--a former bounty hunter coming out of retirement to avenge the disfigurement of a working girl--is as compelling as the day is long.  So what is it about UNFORGIVEN that so disappointed me, and continues to disappoint each time I pull up a chair to watch this very well-made film?Dichotomy.  It's a trait we all possess, to some degree.  It's certainly present with Hackman's character as Sheriff Little Bill Daggett--a dedicated public servant on the one hand and brutal thug and bully on the other.  That's a character contrast that's believable; we can see, and understand, both sides of the coin Little Bill represents.  But Eastwood's character presents a whole new set of problems (for me, anyway).  Bill Munny is a quiet, soft-spoken, gentle widower with two young children.  From his mannerisms it becomes evident he wouldn't harm a fly; he reluctantly agrees to accept the bounty because he's so desperately poor, but approaches the job with dread and despair.  As this film moves to its violent climax the viewer is treated to such a transformation of Bill Munny that I was unable to suspend disbelief.  The wild-eyed, almost evil incarnate killer Munny became was simply too much--even after he was so savagely provoked.  Thus I was aptly disappointed in UNFORGIVEN, a great visual epic with too much to digest.--D.

The sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman) decided that the two men responsible for the crime should pay the brothel's owner a couple of horses since the prostitute won't be able to work anymore with a cut up face. The other prostitutes are upset that the men are not punished more severely. One of the prostitutes, Alice gets the other girls to put their money together as a reward for whoever kills the two. The &quot;Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett) gets William Munny (Clint Eastwood) interested in killing them for the money. William had been a ruthless killer back in the day but since getting married and giving up whisky, he became a gentle pig farmer. He does not want to go at first but he has two children and he is poor. He knows he can use the money to provide for his children. He leaves his two very young children home alone in their cabin and then gets Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to go with him. English Bob (Richard Harris) along with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) also want the reward.  Gene Hackman gives a great performance in it. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film. There is a good funny scene where Bill insults English Bob by mispronouncing the title of the book about him by calling it the 'The Duck of Death&quot; instead of the &quot;Duke of Death&quot; and tells Beauchamp the 'true' version of one of the stories in the book about English Bob.

Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty.

Eastwood directs and stars as one William Munny, retired gunman and formerly notorious killer, now in unsuccessful retirement as a pig-farming widower with two small children.  The opportunity to make some money comes in the person of the Schofield Kid, a young, cocky, and inexperienced gunman wanna-be headed to Wyoming to collect the bounty for a revenge killing in the small town of Big Whiskey.  Munny goes along, and recruits his former side-kick Ned Logan (played by Morgan Freeman), also retired.Big Whiskey is run by its tough-talking, preening sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, played with smooth menace by Gene Hackman.  For Little Bill, the free ranging gunmen of an earlier era are meant to be a dying breed, and he runs out of town the first man who shows up to collect the revenge killing bounty (Richard Harris in a nice cameo).Munny, Logan, and the Schofield Kid reach Big Whiskey and promptly run afoul of the sheriff, who abuses a sick Munny and murders Logan, while the Kid discovers killing is not all it's cracked up to be in the dime novels.  Munny will seek his revenge on Little Bill in a final, blazing gunfight in the middle of a thunderstorm.Eastwood purposely deglamorizes the Western myth.  Big Whiskey is barely a muddy wide spot in the run, easily run by a bullying sheriff with a big ego, who tolerates prostitution and the abuse of the prostitutes by ranch hands.  Munny and Logan are well past their prime; their killing of two ranch hands for the bounty money is painful in its ineptitude.  Munny's final confrontation with Little Bill is fueled by whiskey and grief over Logan's death.Eastwood's direction is spare and straightforward.  The dialogue is laconic but authentic to the period.  The cast, beyond the headlining actors, does a nice job of portraying the dreams and struggles of people in a small place.  This movie is highly recommended as a masterpiece of Eastwood's movie-making art and as perhaps his last look at the movie cowboy.",5,"A Western, One Last Time...",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2082,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'revisited', 'movie', 'cowboy', 'roots', 'one', 'last', 'time', '1992', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Unforgiven', 'Eastwood', 'directs', 'stars', 'one', 'William', 'Munny', 'retired', 'gunman', 'formerly', 'notorious', 'killer', 'now', 'unsuccessful', 'retirement', 'pig-farming', 'widower', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'opportunity', 'make', 'money', 'person', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'young', 'cocky', 'inexperienced', 'gunman', 'wanna-be', 'headed', 'Wyoming', 'collect', 'bounty', 'revenge', 'killing', 'small', 'town', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Munny', 'along', 'former', 'side-kick', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'also', 'retired.Big', 'Whiskey', 'run', 'tough-talking', 'preening', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'played', 'smooth', 'menace', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'free', 'ranging', 'gunmen', 'earlier', 'era', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'dying', 'breed', 'town', 'first', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'collect', 'revenge', 'killing', 'bounty', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'nice', 'cameo', '.Munny', 'Logan', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'reach', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'promptly', 'run', 'afoul', 'sheriff', 'who', 'sick', 'Munny', 'murders', 'Logan', 'Kid', 'discovers', 'killing', 'not', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'dime', 'novels', 'Munny', 'will', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Little', 'Bill', 'final', 'blazing', 'gunfight', 'middle', 'thunderstorm.Eastwood', 'purposely', 'Western', 'myth', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'barely', 'muddy', 'wide', 'spot', 'run', 'easily', 'run', 'bullying', 'sheriff', 'big', 'ego', 'who', 'prostitution', 'abuse', 'prostitutes', 'ranch', 'hands', 'Munny', 'Logan', 'are', 'well', 'prime', 'killing', 'two', 'ranch', 'hands', 'bounty', 'money', 'painful', 'ineptitude', 'Munny', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Little', 'Bill', 'fueled', 'whiskey', 'grief', 'Logan', 'death.Eastwood', 'direction', 'spare', 'straightforward', 'dialogue', 'laconic', 'authentic', 'period', 'cast', 'headlining', 'actors', 'nice', 'job', 'portraying', 'dreams', 'struggles', 'people', 'small', 'place', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'masterpiece', 'Eastwood', 'movie-making', 'art', 'perhaps', 'last', 'look', 'movie', 'cowboy']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The story is about a group of prostitutes in a small Western town in the 19th century.  A customer with not a lot under the hood overreacts to his rent-a-mate's comment on this and slices up her face with a knife.  After the sheriff shows up and gives less than a slap on the hand for this offense, the ladies get together, pool their money, and get the word out that they'll pay a reward to the party that brings a more ""eye for and eye"" to the cutter and his companion.Now it's not this original scene of violence that makes it special.  It's the portrayal of old Western life that does.  While the otherwise masterful ""Lonesome Dove"" has one of the most beautiful faces in movies in Diane Lane as it's prostitute, the ladies here are, for the most part, very ordinary looking.  More than that, they portray a weariness that shows that their life is not that easy.  In the hands of other Hollywood powers, the ladies would have been Charlie's Angels.Cut to the existence of the movie's main character, played by Clint Eastwood.  He's a former outlaw and killer, reformed by his now dead wife, and faced with the responsibility of raising two children.  The only thing good that can be said of his home is that it's slightly better than the pen where he keeps the hogs he raises, and that's not saying much.  The Ponderosa it ain't.What Clint Eastwood seemed to want to do in his directorial masterpiece is to turn everything he represented in his previous years of acting and turn in on it's head.  In scene after scene you anticipate the old Clint rearing back and wiping out half a town just to get an appetite up for breakfast.  But time after time we are surprised to see a man who can't even mount his horse properly, and can't hit a target with a pistol from ten feet away.  We see that all his lifestyle has led to is wretched poverty.The movie grows on you the more you watch it, and the memorable characters have stood the test of time.  Morgan Freeman, as always, brings a knowing weariness in his role as Eastwood's partner.  Richard Harris has a terrific role as an English gunfighter who hires a writer to build his own legend, but has it totally taken apart by the sheriff of the movie's central town.  And Gene Hackman deserves his Oscar as the sheriff who is somehow portrayed as the bad guy when most of the other lead male characters are in the plot for the sole purpose of committing murder.

91099,ACJTUFZEUCCBL,0790729644,"Eolake ""eolake (.com)""","[3, 5]","""Unforgiven"" certainly looks beautiful, especially in HD. And I admit it is a very good film with a lot of good points, perfect timing, excellent acting, good characters, the works. And it has a lot more nuance than westerns normally have.But I will contend that ultimately it still boils down to the same old thing: admiration for a killer.When William Munny, in the charismatic and handsome frame of Clint Eastwood, rides out of Big Whiskey in the end, saying that if anybody hurt the prostitutes for putting up the blood money, he will come back and kill everybody, there is pretty much not anybody watching who does not feel deep in his/her gut: ""my god, there is a MAN!"" You just can't help it, it's in our dark nature.And you can even see this excemplified in the admiring and longing looks given him by the writer fellow and by the prostitute with the scars, as they watch him leave.There is no way around it: it is gut-level admiration for a man who by his own admission has killed many innocent men, and women, and children, and who killed several more just minutes ago. And the film aims for it, it is where it gets its marketing power.I am shocked that I've been unable to find any other reviewers (professional or amateur) who really question this. It is not a ""great wrong"", but there's certainly nothing beautiful about it, and it needs to be recognized.In a documentary about Eastwood, the narrator says about Unforgiven: ""the sherif has tortured and killed Will's best friend. He has no choice but vengeance."" And that's the exact untruth to be uncovered. There is always a choice. Violence begets violence, and he who breaks the chain, wins.Don't get me wrong, I am not villainizing ""the Clint"" here. His hyper-violent movie characters are merely reflecting an important aspect of human nature. I'm just saying it's an aspect we'd do well to look at some more.Another way to express my problem with it: if you listen to the movie, it is clearly against violence. The characters say it many times. But if you look at the movie, it is clearly for it. The violence is presented in a way so it is enjoyable. A friend of mine said that the final big gun battle was ""like an orgasm"".By the way, I'm just watching the documentary about the film, and DW Peoples (the writer) does say that the reason people think it's an anti-violence movie is that most other movies are ""pro-violence"" in the sense that if it is the good guy doing it to the bad guy, it's OK. But that reality is more complex, and that it's often difficult to pinpoint who's the ""good guy"" and who's the ""bad guy"". Which I think is wise. You'll notice that each participant in a fight always thinks of himself as the good guy.I will concede that within the framework of a big, popular, Hollywood movie, this film is probably as far as we can currently go towards an anti-violence movie. If you'd made a movie like this and not made the violence seductive and aesthetic, it would instantly have lost 90% of its audience.

This is the first one that I didn't feel like I was watching Dirty Harry's great grandfather or the return of the Highplains Drifter.  Of course that is my opinion and I'm entitled to it.  In this movie Eastwood has gotten the period mostly correct, not only in clothing but speech and how people felt, reacted, to and about things in the era in which the film takes place.  The ever increasing injuries to the Prostitute as the story gets told over and over, I think this was common at a time when word of mouth was the only way news traveled.  I believe it to be true that a lot of bad men were bad men when they were drunk and maybe not quite so bad when they weren't. I think very few movies have ever touched on how much alcohol played a part in making brave men. Not only the bad ones but the good ones too.  This movie deals with the act of killing someone like few westerns before it ever had. It's not glamourous to kill someone as Jaimz Woolvett's charactor discovered.  Eastwood's portrayal of Will Munny is, I think one of his best.

The classic response, when told he had shot an unarmed man, ""Well, he should have armed himself,"" is close to the reality of the situation.  The motion picture has excellent acting and deserved academy awards.The motion picture deals with the question of white slavery, i.e., holding women in bondage as prostitutes.  This practice continued into the 20th century.  Their pimp questions how they obtained money to hire gunmen, who are brought in to take vengence on two men they hold responsible for disfiguring one of the women (note that no punishment was meted out to the men, other then making them reimburse the pimp for the value of the woman - an indication of the prevailing attitude).The gunmen are two paid assassins, coming out of retirement to earn some much needed money, plus a young man thinking to make a name for himself.  The story deals with tracking down their assigned targets, executing them (don't expect a fair fight, one gets whacked while sitting in an outhouse), and the aftermath.  Life will not be the same for the survivors, and the Eastwood character rides off into the sunset and back into obscurity.Anyone wanting to study the real west, rather than the make believe usually presented, should watch this motion picture.

91108,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,0790729644,Frederick Baptist,"[1, 2]","There is no doubt in my mind that this is Clint Eastwood's best ever film effort and it is a testament to this movie's greatness that it has aged so well over the years and I'd wager will continue to do so for years to come.  The themes involved are timeless such as coming to grips with your true self, making sacrifices and hard choices for the good of your dependents, regret for life's past indiscretions, retribution/revenge and like in any true western justice meted out in dramatic fashion at the end as ""good"" triumphs over abject evil as personified in the form of sadistic sheriff Hackman.This film is so great as well because it blurs the lines between what is good and evil and does man really have the right to mete justice when as Eastwood's character so aptly puts it: ""deserves got nuthin' to do with it.""  Did both cowboys deserve to die or was it just the unrepentent slasher for example?  How about Ned?  Many issues such as these are addressed in this movie and because it is not just the usual cut and dried western where the lines are clear this brilliant movie that engages the viewer on a more cerebral level makes this not only an excellent western but also a brilliant film regardless of genre to be enjoyed over and over again like a true classic should.I've watched this film a few times and I never tire of doing so in contrast with say ""Silence of the Lambs"" which I watched recently and realised that it doesn't reward repeated viewing as much although I have to say I enjoyed it a lot when I first saw it for example.  This is why ""Unforgiven"" ranks among the top 5 films that I have ever seen.The unfortunate thing though is the poor quality of the dvd.  The sound quality was okay at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround but the picture quality was very poor and certainly not commensurate with the sound quality.  The widescreen version side of the disc is the way to view it as the fullscreen side was pathetic as too much of the picture is excluded and for some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.Updated 23 Aug 2011:Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of ""Maverick"" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.Recommended.",3,My Favourite Western And Among My Favourite Movies of All Time!

Munny is to assist this young gunslinger in killing a couple of men, with bounties on their heads, for beating a hooker. Munny reluctantly accepts the job, desperately in need of cash. He and The Schofield Kid are joined by Munny's old partner (Morgan Freemen) as they set out on their journey. The only thing that stands in there way is the sinister sheriff (Gene Hackman) of a small townUnforgiven is a unique western in that where most westerns glorify violence and bloodshed, Unforgiven examines the psychological effects of violence, the finality of murder, and the fragility of life. One death, in particular, is drawn out and made quite unpleasant without being gratuitous. The film is meticulously paced, which allows the viewer to think and reflect on how easily violent acts can be committed and the impact they have on the perpetrator and those close to the victims. Munny is haunted by the ghosts of those he has killed. Having committed the act of murder, The Schofield Kid is horrified and disgusted with himself. Gunslinging isn't what it's cracked up to be.David Webb Peoples's original screenplay allows the film's characters to develop and break free of their western clich&eacute;s. Eastwood's character represents a deconstruction of his famed tough guy career. Eastwood sheds his ""Dirty Harry"" persona to play a man who has grown weary and regretful of the crimes and the murders he committed in his past. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, a character who - on the surface - appears to be the formulaic cocky gunslinger; but is actually a richly developed character with many unseen truths. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freemen, and Richard Harris round out the superb cast.Unforgiven's impeccable period detail greatly adds to the film's realism. The lack of vibrancy in the film's color palette and the heavy use of shadows greatly contribute to the state of the dismal characters and the heaviness of the subject matter.Unforgiven is very much unlike Sergio Leone's bold and operatic westerns, which are wonderful films in their own right.

Further viewings (including a recent one) have made me changed my mind and hang my head in shame.  This is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and one of Eastwood's crowning achievements as a filmmaker and as an actor.The film is uncommonly dark, even for an Eastwood film.  It starts off with a brutal rape scene, and ends with a shootout.  The cinematography is masterful, arguably the best in any Eastwood film.  Eastwood's character, Billy, is really trying to go straight after spending a lifetime of killing, whoring, and maiming.  His wife is dead, his farm is failing, and he's worried about his children.  He gets a chance to get some money, but he has to find and kill the people who raped and beat up(and got away with it) a prostitute at the beginning of the film.  Over the course of the film, Eastwood's quest becomes more brutal and darker, concluding in what has to be the best, most brooding scene in all of Eastwood's work.  The final scene takes place in the bar/brothel where the rape/assault took place.  The scene starts in a wide shot, then you see Eastwood's rifle make an entrance, but it's only his rifle.  It's a brilliant entrance, one of the greatest in Western movie history, and the concluding shootout is as menancing and as cruel as the West could be.This film won Eastwood his first Oscar, and it's a film that deserved all its accolades.  Most Best Picture Oscar winners are rather safe and tame films, but this is one of the exceptions where an uncommonly dark film swept the awards.  It also rejuvinated Eastwood's career a bit.  He had just directed and starred in The Rookie, a film that is considered his worst film by mostly everyone, including fans (for the record, it's not that bad of a film.  Pink Cadillac is Clint's worst movie).  The Rookie was a box office and critical bomb.  So when this film appeared, it really brought Eastwood back, and he's been there ever since.  Unforgiven is considered one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and deservedly so.For the record, buy the 2 disc special edition DVD, not the single disc edition.  The single disc edition (which is thankfully out of print) is a very poor edition, with an unremarkable, grainy transfer, no special features, and a bizarre scene selection menu that is impossible to navigate.

91119,A2BWQ2C3QW32YP,0790729644,"GZA ""gza""","[0, 0]","Now this is a film. Eastwood's seminal Western should really have marked the end of the genre - 'Unforgiven' says all there is to say about a time that has been eulogised as some kind of mythical golden age throughout the history of Hollywood. The fact that he hasn't made a film fit to wipe the shoes of this 1992 classic since emphasises it's power: when 'Unforgiven' ends it feels as though something in the air has changed - as though an era has ended. This is moviemaking at it's darkest, starkest and most brutally honest. The resonance of Unforgiven carries greater weight because Eastwood's name is attached to it - the most famous cowboy of the silver screen, bar John Wayne, spends the first ten minutes of the film rolling around on his backside in a pigsty, and the last 30 minutes ranting deliriously while in a fever.  William Munny is no hero - he is the kind of ruthless killer that Eastwood would have blown away in a stylised hail of lightning-fast bullets in earlier films. Munny is an aged, poverty-stricken widower who is utterly ashamed of his violent past and briefly found redemption through love.  However, his wife is now dead, and the only way he can see to support his children is to take on one last bounty hunting job.  The fact that the wanted men are responsible for mutilating a prostitute seems to lend justice to the quest, and Munny succeeds in drumming up the support of his old partner, played by Morgan Freeman. Together with a young would-be gunslinger who is full of the bravado of youth, the three head for the hills and straight into the hands of Little Bill, the corrupt and sinister sherriff (played by Gene Hackman in Oscar-winning form), another killer from the old days. From their first meeting, a sense of impending doom casts its shadow over the film. We learn that the most effective killers are the ones who shoot their opponents in the back, or unarmed - the ones who keep a straight head, not the best looking ones who are fastest on the draw.  Eastwood, aided with a brilliant script by David Webb Peoples, constantly undermines the traditional values of the old Westerns. There is no clear cut sense of good versus evil or justice prevailing over malice. When the kid, clearly feeling greater remorse than he had anticipated after shooting one of the wanted men, and in an attempt to justify his act, says to Munny ""he had it coming"" , Munny replies ""we all have it coming kid"". And later Munny, describing what it is like to destroy another human being, however much they ""deserved"" it, says ""it's a hell of a thing killing a man, taking away all he's got - and all he's ever gonna have"". This is the crux of `Unforgiven' - death is final, irreversible, and comes to us all whether we deserve it or not.Unforgiven is a beautifully shot movie.  The gorgeously evocative cinematography displays the colours of autumn at their most poignant and the descent into winter clearly mirrors the coldness at the heart of the film: vengeance must be bought, but at a high price -  their can be no redemption for the avengers, no satisfaction for the avenged. In fact nobody benefits from the terrible denouement, and all we are left with is the knowledge that, even when men do evil things for good reasons, the things they do are still evil.",5,It's a hell of a thing killing a man.....,972864000,"10 30, 2000",2000,3289,"['Now', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'seminal', 'Western', 'should', 'really', 'have', 'marked', 'end', 'genre', 'say', 'time', 'been', 'eulogised', 'kind', 'mythical', 'golden', 'age', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'fact', ""n't"", 'made', 'film', 'fit', 'wipe', 'shoes', '1992', 'classic', 'power', 'when', ""'Unforgiven"", 'something', 'air', 'changed', 'era', 'ended', 'moviemaking', 'darkest', 'starkest', 'most', 'brutally', 'honest', 'resonance', 'Unforgiven', 'greater', 'weight', 'Eastwood', 'name', 'attached', 'most', 'famous', 'cowboy', 'silver', 'screen', 'bar', 'John', 'Wayne', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'rolling', 'around', 'backside', 'pigsty', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'ranting', 'deliriously', 'fever', 'William', 'Munny', 'hero', 'kind', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'have', 'blown', 'away', 'stylised', 'hail', 'lightning-fast', 'bullets', 'earlier', 'films', 'Munny', 'aged', 'poverty-stricken', 'widower', 'who', 'utterly', 'ashamed', 'violent', 'past', 'briefly', 'found', 'redemption', 'love', 'However', 'wife', 'now', 'dead', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'support', 'children', 'take', 'one', 'last', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'job', 'fact', 'wanted', 'men', 'are', 'responsible', 'mutilating', 'prostitute', 'lend', 'justice', 'quest', 'Munny', 'drumming', 'up', 'support', 'old', 'partner', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Together', 'young', 'would-be', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'full', 'bravado', 'youth', 'three', 'head', 'hills', 'straight', 'hands', 'Little', 'Bill', 'corrupt', 'sinister', 'sherriff', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Oscar-winning', 'form', 'killer', 'old', 'days', 'first', 'meeting', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'shadow', 'film', 'learn', 'most', 'effective', 'killers', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'shoot', 'opponents', 'back', 'unarmed', 'ones', 'who', 'keep', 'straight', 'head', 'not', 'best', 'looking', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'fastest', 'draw', 'Eastwood', 'aided', 'brilliant', 'script', 'David', 'Webb', 'Peoples', 'constantly', 'traditional', 'values', 'old', 'Westerns', 'clear', 'cut', 'sense', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'justice', 'prevailing', 'malice', 'When', 'kid', 'clearly', 'feeling', 'greater', 'remorse', 'had', 'anticipated', 'shooting', 'one', 'wanted', 'men', 'attempt', 'justify', 'act', 'Munny', 'had', 'coming', 'Munny', 'have', 'coming', 'kid', 'later', 'Munny', 'describing', 'what', 'destroy', 'human', 'being', 'however', 'much', 'deserved', 'hell', 'thing', 'killing', 'man', 'taking', 'away', 'got', 'ever', 'gon', 'have', 'crux', 'Unforgiven', 'death', 'final', 'irreversible', 'deserve', 'not.Unforgiven', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'movie', 'gorgeously', 'evocative', 'cinematography', 'colours', 'autumn', 'most', 'poignant', 'descent', 'winter', 'clearly', 'coldness', 'heart', 'film', 'vengeance', 'must', 'be', 'bought', 'high', 'price', 'can', 'be', 'redemption', 'avengers', 'satisfaction', 'avenged', 'fact', 'nobody', 'benefits', 'terrible', 'denouement', 'are', 'left', 'knowledge', 'even', 'when', 'men', 'do', 'evil', 'things', 'good', 'reasons', 'things', 'do', 'are', 'still', 'evil']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91123,A457S8SW690NM,0790729644,hi,"[3, 8]","If you're in a hurry, don't even read any of these reviews. Not even mine. The fact that this movie won 4 academy awards including best director, best picture and best supportng actor (Gene Hackman) should make you watch it. Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this western with a great cast and a great moral. Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, 3 of the best actors ever, now all past 50 years of age, are united in this masterpiece. That should also make you want to see it, because you see these absolutely extraordinary actors all in one extraordinary movie, together.The film opens with a brutal scene, in which a man badly cuts up a prostitute in her face. He does this because she laughed at ""the size of his pecker"". The man and his accomplice are then released without any physical punishment with only a fine as their punishment by Lil Bill (Gene Hackman), the sheriff.On top of it, the owner of the place doesn't care about the prostitute, and just cares about losing money because of one of the prostitutes' face. But, the other prostitutes can't live after what happened to their friend. So, they combine their money to form $1000.00 and place bounties on the two men's lives. But Lil Bill and his troops are prepared to stand their ground in their town of Big Whiskey.And then come Ned (Morgan Freeman), William (Clint Eastwood) and Schofeild Kid. Ned and Will are partners that used to be killers. The Kid claims that he's a killer and acts tough. All of them need that money.But Lil Bill is a corrupt sheriff and a violent man that ridiculizes anyone trying to kill the two men. Gene Hackman is absolutely brilliant and definitely deserved that academy award. He is a violent man that thinks that he can use this violence becuase he is a figure of authority. After beating up English Bob, a man trying to kill the two men for the money, Bill calls him the Duck instead of the Duke in a highly comical scene that is very memorable.William is a troubled man, traumatized by his killings. He is scared of death and is a poor soul that misses his dead wife.The movie is so excellent because of the cast, the character development and the execution of the movie. The characters are brilliantly made. Lil Bill is a corrupt man and usually is the vilain. William is the protagonist and hero of the movie but at times, you feel horrified by all of his murders in the past but do pity him also. He's a haunted man trying to change and erase all of the bad he has done. But in the end of the movie, he ends up needing to confront this and needs to decide whether to stop doing what he did or continue doing it.Schofield Kid is a character that is a mystery. He acts all tough but deep down inside, he ends out being a puny little guy trying to disguise his real self for the whole movie and adventure.Ned is brought to life by Morgan Freeman and seems the sweetest and most sensitive of the trio. And of course, you've just got to love the amazing Morgan Freeeman.This movie is a masterpiece with an excellent moral and that needs to be seen. It is in my opinion the best western EVER MADE that is usually sad, funny at times and ends out being a unique and memorable film that should be purchased and rewatched and cherished forever. Movies like this are hard to come around so we should cherish it.",5,Clint Eastwood's unforgettable masterpiece,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,3317,"[""'re"", 'hurry', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'reviews', 'Not', 'even', 'mine', 'fact', 'movie', 'won', '4', 'academy', 'awards', 'including', 'best', 'director', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'supportng', 'actor', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'should', 'make', 'watch', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'starred', 'western', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'moral', 'Eastwood', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '3', 'best', 'actors', 'ever', 'now', 'past', '50', 'years', 'age', 'are', 'united', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'also', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'see', 'absolutely', 'extraordinary', 'actors', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'together.The', 'film', 'brutal', 'scene', 'man', 'badly', 'up', 'prostitute', 'face', 'laughed', 'size', 'pecker', 'man', 'accomplice', 'are', 'then', 'released', 'physical', 'punishment', 'only', 'fine', 'punishment', 'Lil', 'Bill', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'sheriff.On', 'top', 'owner', 'place', ""n't"", 'care', 'prostitute', 'just', 'cares', 'losing', 'money', 'one', 'prostitutes', 'face', 'other', 'prostitutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'what', 'happened', 'friend', 'So', 'combine', 'money', 'form', '1000.00', 'place', 'bounties', 'two', 'men', 'lives', 'Lil', 'Bill', 'troops', 'are', 'prepared', 'stand', 'ground', 'town', 'Big', 'Whiskey.And', 'then', 'come', 'Ned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'William', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Schofeild', 'Kid', 'Ned', 'Will', 'are', 'partners', 'used', 'be', 'killers', 'Kid', 'killer', 'tough', 'need', 'money.But', 'Lil', 'Bill', 'corrupt', 'sheriff', 'violent', 'man', 'anyone', 'trying', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'academy', 'award', 'violent', 'man', 'can', 'use', 'violence', 'becuase', 'figure', 'authority', 'beating', 'up', 'English', 'Bob', 'man', 'trying', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'money', 'Bill', 'Duck', 'instead', 'Duke', 'highly', 'comical', 'scene', 'very', 'memorable.William', 'troubled', 'man', 'traumatized', 'killings', 'scared', 'death', 'poor', 'soul', 'dead', 'wife.The', 'movie', 'so', 'excellent', 'cast', 'character', 'development', 'execution', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'Lil', 'Bill', 'corrupt', 'man', 'usually', 'vilain', 'William', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'movie', 'times', 'feel', 'horrified', 'murders', 'past', 'do', 'pity', 'also', 'haunted', 'man', 'trying', 'change', 'erase', 'bad', 'done', 'end', 'movie', 'up', 'needing', 'confront', 'decide', 'stop', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'continue', 'doing', 'it.Schofield', 'Kid', 'character', 'mystery', 'tough', 'deep', 'inside', 'out', 'being', 'puny', 'little', 'guy', 'trying', 'disguise', 'real', 'self', 'whole', 'movie', 'adventure.Ned', 'brought', 'life', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sweetest', 'most', 'sensitive', 'trio', 'course', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'love', 'amazing', 'Morgan', 'Freeeman.This', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'excellent', 'moral', 'be', 'seen', 'opinion', 'best', 'western', 'EVER', 'MADE', 'usually', 'sad', 'funny', 'times', 'out', 'being', 'unique', 'memorable', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'purchased', 'rewatched', 'cherished', 'forever', 'Movies', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'around', 'should', 'cherish']",Unforgiven Snap Case

After it there will only be placebo westerns. The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquify into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation  of the guilty, and not the reverse.

I won't discuss its merits as a western, which is a classic and worthy of 5 stars.  This BD disk is 3 stars for its technical quality.The BD version is worth buying if you don't own the 2 disk special edition, which has the better DVD transfer, and cost more, even after discounts! But if you own the better DVD version and are looking to own the best version for home viewing, hold on.While the audio is crisp and clear, there is no magic in its mastering or imaging, its just clearer sound than the DVD.The BD transfer is generally sharp, but there are moments so dull, I thought I was running the DVD version.  The high resolution of BD removes jaggies seen in diagonal lines and pixelation revealed by DVD resolution projected into a large HDTV, but this BD's colors are often washed out, and edges of objects blurred.  This lack of resolution is much worse in the night scenes including the finale scene, and is 80% less during daylight shots.  Some of the daylight shots do appear as blurry as the night shots. Unlike better BD out there, overall the background elements do not have more striking detail over the DVD. By comparison, a stellar transfer exists even in old movies.  If you are a fan of WWII airplanes, see the 1969 'Battle of Britain' or the classic 2001: Space Odyssey.However, if you don't own the 2 disk set, this BD disk incorporates all the extras of the 2 disk set into one disk, and a better buy than the original DVD release.",3,"A blu-ray dissapointment, but a wonderful movie",1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,1562,"['are', 'plethora', 'reviews', 'movie', 'review', 'mostly', 'comparison', 'BD', 'vs', 'DVD', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'merits', 'western', 'classic', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'BD', 'disk', '3', 'stars', 'technical', 'quality.The', 'BD', 'version', 'worth', 'buying', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', '2', 'disk', 'special', 'edition', 'better', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'cost', 'more', 'even', 'discounts', 'own', 'better', 'DVD', 'version', 'are', 'looking', 'own', 'best', 'version', 'home', 'viewing', 'hold', 'audio', 'crisp', 'clear', 'magic', 'mastering', 'imaging', 'just', 'clearer', 'sound', 'DVD.The', 'BD', 'transfer', 'generally', 'sharp', 'are', 'moments', 'so', 'dull', 'thought', 'was', 'running', 'DVD', 'version', 'high', 'resolution', 'BD', 'jaggies', 'seen', 'diagonal', 'lines', 'pixelation', 'revealed', 'DVD', 'resolution', 'projected', 'large', 'HDTV', 'BD', 'colors', 'are', 'often', 'washed', 'out', 'edges', 'objects', 'blurred', 'lack', 'resolution', 'much', 'worse', 'night', 'scenes', 'including', 'finale', 'scene', '80', '%', 'less', 'daylight', 'shots', 'daylight', 'shots', 'do', 'appear', 'as', 'blurry', 'night', 'shots', 'better', 'BD', 'there', 'background', 'elements', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'striking', 'detail', 'DVD', 'comparison', 'stellar', 'transfer', 'even', 'old', 'movies', 'are', 'fan', 'WWII', 'airplanes', 'see', '1969', ""'Battle"", 'Britain', 'classic', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', '2', 'disk', 'set', 'BD', 'disk', 'extras', '2', 'disk', 'set', 'one', 'disk', 'better', 'buy', 'original', 'DVD', 'release']",Unforgiven Snap Case

I read that nearly 1/2 of the soldiers in the revolutionary war didn't shoot at other soldiers.  The taboo of killing another human being was so strong that they would purposefully fire over the heads of the enemy soldiers instead of at them.  Some soldiers that were killed were found with many balls still in their muskets; they would act like they were firing but not pull the trigger and would have to ""reload"" to keep up appearances.",5,"It's a hell of a thing, killing a man",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1270,"['take', 'away', 'got', 'ever', 'gon', 'have', 'Unforgiven', 'one', 'greatest', 'MOVIES', 'time', 'None', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'completely', 'good', 'none', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'completely', 'bad', 'investigation', 'morality', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking.This', 'most', 'realistic', 'western', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'gunslinging', 'superheros', 'Outlaw', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'characters', 'here', 'can', 'do', 'miss', 'make', 'mistakes', 'When', 'Munny', 'was', 'lucky', 'order', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'lucky', 'when', 'killin', 'folk', 'know', 'reason', 'survived', 'not', 'superhuman', 'talent', 'quickness', 'gun.Also', 'realistic', 'way', 'gunbattle', 'unfolds', 'where', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'fire', 'one', 'guy', ""n't"", 'fire', 'when', 'safe', 'clear', 'shot', 'read', 'nearly', '1/2', 'soldiers', 'revolutionary', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'other', 'soldiers', 'taboo', 'killing', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'would', 'purposefully', 'fire', 'heads', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'instead', 'soldiers', 'were', 'killed', 'were', 'found', 'many', 'balls', 'still', 'muskets', 'would', 'act', 'were', 'firing', 'not', 'pull', 'trigger', 'would', 'have', 'reload', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The performances, especially by Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Eastwood, are superlative. Hackman's ""Little Bill"" is easily his most memorable character since Popeye Doyle in ""French Connection"" (Too bad he had to do a caricature of it a couple years later in ""The Quick and the Dead""). Cinematography, editing and most of the dialogue are also excellent.My problem is with the plot. So Eastwood's Bill Munny, after arriving in Big Whiskey, has a dark epiphany of sorts in which he sees the harsh reality of death and the terrible consequnces of his murderous past. Yet he then almost casually goes through with the contract killings, even though he now knows that the account of the mutilation of the prostitute that he is supposedly exacting revenge for was exaggerated. To me, this makes all his dark visions and revelations meaningless; they had no effect. Despite all the pretensions of the script, in the end this becomes just another conventional western, with the ""good guy"" shooting all the bad guys. Despite all his character falws and all the nuances, in the end Eastwood is presented as just another avenging hero like his mid-seventies characters.",3,"Greatly executed, ethically challenged",1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1214,"['Technically', 'acting-wise', 'great', 'movie', 'performances', 'especially', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Eastwood', 'are', 'superlative', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'easily', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'Popeye', 'Doyle', 'French', 'Connection', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'do', 'caricature', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Quick', 'Dead', 'Cinematography', 'editing', 'most', 'dialogue', 'are', 'also', 'excellent.My', 'problem', 'plot', 'So', 'Eastwood', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'arriving', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'dark', 'epiphany', 'sorts', 'harsh', 'reality', 'death', 'terrible', 'consequnces', 'murderous', 'past', 'then', 'almost', 'casually', 'contract', 'killings', 'even', 'now', 'account', 'mutilation', 'prostitute', 'supposedly', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'was', 'exaggerated', 'dark', 'visions', 'revelations', 'meaningless', 'had', 'effect', 'pretensions', 'script', 'end', 'just', 'conventional', 'western', 'good', 'guy', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'character', 'falws', 'nuances', 'end', 'Eastwood', 'presented', 'just', 'avenging', 'hero', 'mid-seventies', 'characters']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91141,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,0790729644,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[3, 4]","When talking about westerns you couldn't begin to muster a word without first mentioning Clint Eastwood. Eastwood didn't start the most popular genre in American cinema but he helped to romanticize the idea of a gunslinger with a heart of stone to people the world over with his ""man with no name"" series directed by Sergio Leoni.  My personal favorites of all the spaghetti westerns were his.  He continued this tradition when he stared directing westerns of his own like High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, and the Outlaw Josie Wales to name a few.  He began to come into his own as not just an actor on screen but as a storyteller to.The Unforgiven is Eastwood at his peak as a storyteller and his first real master piece as a director.  He sheds his badass, no fear, bent on revenge gunslinger persona that he made famous behind for a character with more depth.  A man with more demons and layers upon layers of baggage, fears and insecurities.  In this film Eastwood Plays William Muddy, an ex outlaw turned family man and pig farmer from Missouri.  William has a bit of a past that he has long left behind, mayhem, gambling, boozin' and of course killing folks.  His long dead wife cured him of those evils and he is just a simple yet inept farmer.  William has two youngins that he is struggling to provide for when a young gunslinger wanna be comes riding in, looking to team up with Muddy, to collect on a reward offered by a whore who was disfigured by two cowboys.Muddy who is flat broke with children to tend to feels he has no choice and agrees to help find and kill these men but only if he can also team up with his old partner, Ned (Morgan Freeman). The three men soon find out this bounty has many more obstacles to over come besides just finding and killing these men.  The biggest being the Sheriff of Old Whiskey, Little Bill (Gene Hackman). Little Bill keep a tight hold on what goes on in his town and outlaws all fire arms in city limits.  He has little respect for assassins and hired guns and enforces his law with the most brutal of measures.The thing that makes this film so different that the other Eastwood films is the depth of the characters, mainly Muddy played by Eastwood himself.  In the beginning he is old, out of shape and soft spoken farmer who hasn't even held a pistol in a decade.  He has lost all taste for killing and wants to leave the past where it belongs, in the past.  Muddy is not only regretful and ashamed of  his past but has become fearful of it as well.  On the servace he almost looks like a coward... but no, he's no coward.  Muddy is afraid of letting out the monster he was in his youth, knowing full well there is no turning back, if your gonna kill someone you have to be all in or all out.  His partners learn this the hard way when you set to kill a man, a bit your own soul dies with it.The progression and transformation this character takes is amazing done and explodes in the films climax.  Eastwood took a huge chance gracing the film for an hour and a half before ever giving what the true fans want.  When Eastwood finally delivers with the goods its well worth the wait and you find out that he is meaner, nastier than you could have ever dreamed. This film has superb directing, writing, acting and pacing, nothing in this movie is off in the slightest and each character is more fleshed out and deep than any other western that I've ever seen.This movie is about more than just badass gunslingers, this movie has a message about what killing does to a man and how few people have the stomach for it.  Even the badest of them all is kept awake at night from the horrors he's inflicted on others.You will not find a better modern day western.  Even if you're not a fan of this genre you will enjoy this film immensely and walk away feeling satisfied.The title of this move sums up Eastwood character to a tee...Unforgiven.  Not just by others but himself as well.  You can change yourself all you want but something you do in life will follow you and haunt you for the rest of your days. One of the best lines of Eastwood's in the movie that really sums up what it's about is when the kid said that they had it comin' to `em, and Eastwoon responds, ""We All have it comin' kid.""",5,"""It's a hell of thing, Killin' a man.""",1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,4245,"['When', 'talking', 'westerns', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'muster', 'word', 'first', 'mentioning', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Eastwood', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'most', 'popular', 'genre', 'American', 'cinema', 'helped', 'romanticize', 'idea', 'gunslinger', 'heart', 'stone', 'people', 'world', 'man', 'name', 'series', 'directed', 'Sergio', 'Leoni', 'personal', 'favorites', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'were', 'continued', 'tradition', 'when', 'stared', 'directing', 'westerns', 'own', 'like', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'Outlaw', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'name', 'few', 'began', 'come', 'own', 'not', 'just', 'actor', 'screen', 'storyteller', 'to.The', 'Unforgiven', 'Eastwood', 'peak', 'storyteller', 'first', 'real', 'master', 'piece', 'director', 'badass', 'fear', 'bent', 'revenge', 'gunslinger', 'persona', 'made', 'famous', 'character', 'more', 'depth', 'man', 'more', 'demons', 'layers', 'layers', 'baggage', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'Plays', 'William', 'Muddy', 'ex', 'outlaw', 'turned', 'family', 'man', 'pig', 'farmer', 'Missouri', 'William', 'bit', 'past', 'long', 'left', 'behind', 'mayhem', 'gambling', 'boozin', 'course', 'killing', 'folks', 'long', 'dead', 'wife', 'cured', 'evils', 'just', 'simple', 'yet', 'inept', 'farmer', 'William', 'two', 'youngins', 'struggling', 'provide', 'when', 'young', 'gunslinger', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'riding', 'looking', 'team', 'up', 'Muddy', 'collect', 'reward', 'offered', 'whore', 'who', 'was', 'disfigured', 'two', 'cowboys.Muddy', 'who', 'flat', 'broke', 'children', 'tend', 'feels', 'choice', 'help', 'find', 'kill', 'men', 'only', 'can', 'also', 'team', 'up', 'old', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'three', 'men', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'bounty', 'many', 'more', 'obstacles', 'come', 'besides', 'just', 'finding', 'killing', 'men', 'biggest', 'being', 'Sheriff', 'Old', 'Whiskey', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'keep', 'tight', 'hold', 'what', 'town', 'outlaws', 'fire', 'arms', 'city', 'limits', 'little', 'respect', 'assassins', 'hired', 'guns', 'law', 'most', 'brutal', 'measures.The', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'depth', 'characters', 'mainly', 'Muddy', 'played', 'Eastwood', 'beginning', 'old', 'shape', 'soft', 'spoken', 'farmer', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'held', 'pistol', 'decade', 'lost', 'taste', 'killing', 'leave', 'past', 'where', 'past', 'Muddy', 'not', 'only', 'regretful', 'ashamed', 'past', 'become', 'fearful', 'as', 'well', 'servace', 'almost', 'coward', 'coward', 'Muddy', 'afraid', 'letting', 'out', 'monster', 'was', 'youth', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'turning', 'back', 'gon', 'kill', 'someone', 'have', 'be', 'out', 'partners', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'when', 'set', 'kill', 'man', 'bit', 'own', 'soul', 'it.The', 'progression', 'transformation', 'character', 'amazing', 'done', 'explodes', 'films', 'climax', 'Eastwood', 'took', 'huge', 'chance', 'gracing', 'film', 'hour', 'half', 'ever', 'giving', 'what', 'true', 'fans', 'want', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'finally', 'goods', 'well', 'wait', 'find', 'out', 'meaner', 'nastier', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'film', 'superb', 'directing', 'writing', 'acting', 'pacing', 'nothing', 'movie', 'slightest', 'character', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'deep', 'other', 'western', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.This', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'badass', 'gunslingers', 'movie', 'message', 'what', 'killing', 'man', 'how', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'stomach', 'Even', 'badest', 'kept', 'awake', 'night', 'horrors', 'inflicted', 'others.You', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'better', 'modern', 'day', 'western', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'immensely', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'satisfied.The', 'title', 'move', 'up', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'tee', 'Unforgiven', 'Not', 'just', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'change', 'want', 'something', 'do', 'life', 'will', 'follow', 'haunt', 'rest', 'days', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'what', 'about', 'when', 'kid', 'said', 'had', 'comin', 'em', 'Eastwoon', 'responds', 'have', 'kid']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91154,A7FDSGMP1F8PA,0790729644,John M. Thompson,"[8, 10]","Clint Eastwood's career in Westerns has pushed the envelope, for the style of cinematography, the moral indifference of its hero, and the way that each one has taken the dominant paradigm of the Western and reversed it to say something significant about the genre.Eastwood's character, William Munny, is as unremarkable a man as he has ever portrayed: a failed pig farmer who turned away from a life of robbery and murder for the love of a wife who died and left him with two children.  Nothing about him suggests the sort of unholy strength which is the one trait all his characters had in common.  It is fully possible to pity Munny as a broken man whose best chance for happiness passed with his wife's death, and whose children's future depends on him returning to his former life as a killer.  When he sets out with Morgan Freeman and Jaimz Woolvett, you wonder if he won't be killed within the first few seconds of a confrontation.Over the course of the film, the events suggest no clear relationship between what people receive and what they deserve.  Even with the cowboys that maimed her dead, the prostitute that they scarred for life will never reclaim her beauty, and her employment at the bordello will be for the little wages she can get as a maid.  Morgan Freeman, who killed no one and gave up his wages for partial absolution of his guilt, is tortured and killed.  In the words of Eastwood's character, &quot;we all have it coming,&quot; it being misery out of proportion to our failures and sins in this life.Arguably, the climax of this film is as powerful as any he has ever done:  the mild-mannered farmer of the past is replaced by a feral hardness as Eastwood drinks the first whiskey he has had since his marriage.  He rides into town, and finds Gene Hackman and his entire posse celebrating with Morgan Freeman's body on display in front of the bordello.  Like a force of nature, he kills them all in turn, which is not what should happen with the sheer weight of numbers against him.  As the sheriff gasps his last few breaths, he protests angrily that he didn't deserve it, and that he had built a house.  Eastwood restates the theme with a terse, &quot;Deservin's' got nothin' to do with it,&quot; and kills him for the cruelty that his job demanded of him.Virtually every other Western, even if the hero dies in the end, reinforces some meaning for the hero's life; Josey Wales gains closure with his past, Shane died protecting the lives of other people, Will Kane stands up alone for the town that he believes in.  This film advances the dangerous idea that nothing needs to matter or make sense, and that hell has room enough for all of us whether or not we deserve to go.Well worth seeing, even for people who dislike the genre.",5,"I understand the negative reviews, but...",987206400,"04 14, 2001",2001,2761,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'Westerns', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'style', 'cinematography', 'moral', 'indifference', 'hero', 'way', 'one', 'taken', 'dominant', 'paradigm', 'Western', 'reversed', 'say', 'something', 'significant', 'genre.Eastwood', 'character', 'William', 'Munny', 'unremarkable', 'man', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'failed', 'pig', 'farmer', 'who', 'turned', 'away', 'life', 'robbery', 'murder', 'love', 'wife', 'who', 'died', 'left', 'two', 'children', 'Nothing', 'sort', 'unholy', 'strength', 'one', 'trait', 'characters', 'had', 'common', 'fully', 'possible', 'pity', 'Munny', 'broken', 'man', 'best', 'chance', 'happiness', 'passed', 'wife', 'death', 'children', 'future', 'returning', 'former', 'life', 'killer', 'When', 'out', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'wonder', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'confrontation.Over', 'course', 'film', 'events', 'suggest', 'clear', 'relationship', 'what', 'people', 'receive', 'what', 'deserve', 'Even', 'cowboys', 'maimed', 'dead', 'prostitute', 'scarred', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'reclaim', 'beauty', 'employment', 'bordello', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'wages', 'can', 'get', 'maid', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'killed', 'one', 'gave', 'up', 'wages', 'partial', 'absolution', 'guilt', 'tortured', 'killed', 'words', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'quot', 'have', 'coming', 'quot', 'being', 'misery', 'proportion', 'failures', 'sins', 'life.Arguably', 'climax', 'film', 'as', 'powerful', 'ever', 'done', 'mild-mannered', 'farmer', 'past', 'replaced', 'feral', 'hardness', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'whiskey', 'had', 'marriage', 'town', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'entire', 'posse', 'celebrating', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'body', 'display', 'front', 'bordello', 'force', 'nature', 'turn', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'happen', 'sheer', 'weight', 'numbers', 'sheriff', 'gasps', 'last', 'few', 'breaths', 'angrily', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'had', 'built', 'house', 'Eastwood', 'theme', 'terse', 'quot', 'Deservin', 'got', 'nothin', 'do', 'quot', 'cruelty', 'job', 'demanded', 'him.Virtually', 'other', 'Western', 'even', 'hero', 'end', 'meaning', 'hero', 'life', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'gains', 'closure', 'past', 'Shane', 'died', 'protecting', 'lives', 'other', 'people', 'Will', 'Kane', 'up', 'alone', 'town', 'film', 'dangerous', 'idea', 'nothing', 'needs', 'matter', 'make', 'sense', 'hell', 'room', 'enough', 'not', 'deserve', 'go.Well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'dislike', 'genre']",Unforgiven Snap Case

Directed by Clint Eastwood, this western stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher, and Anna Thompson.Gene Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett.There have been so many great reviews written, so I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.The story itself is intriguing.  It's basically about two retired outlaws who come out of retirement to collect a bounty.  A group of prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming offer $1,000.00 to anyone who can kill two cowboys that had disfigured one of the prostitutes.  The local sheriff does not like what's going on, as he does not allow firearms or assassins in his town.In Kansas, William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is visited by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who tries to recruit Munny to kill the cowboys.  Munny recruits his old riding partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  Together they head west to Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Do they get the job done?  Watch to find out.The atmosphere and feel of the Old West town was captured very thoroughly.  The scenery is breathtaking throughout the movie.  This DVD's clarity is outstanding.The best acting comes from Gene Hackman, in my opinion.  He plays a mean and heartless sheriff very well.  Clint Eastwood is outstanding as well, as is Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, Richard Harris, and Frances Fisher.  Really, EVERYBODY in the movie gives great acting performances.  EVERYBODY.  There are a lot of memorable lines spoken by many of the actors, particularly Eastwood, Hackman, Woolvett, and Harris.  I think Jaimz Woolvett's acting performance is exceptional as the ""Schofield Kid"".One of the things I really like about this movie is the darkness throughout.  The nighttime scenes and the scenes in which it's raining remind me of film noir, only this movie is in color.  Really, it's modern day film noir.  I really like the musical score as well.

""The Unforgiven"" in many ways, is one of his best movies and one of the most visual in its depiction of what a man is, and especially, what a man was in the Wild West, and the transitions that man tried to make, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not.His morality is pure in this film.  He is an ex-gunfighter who has seen the good way of the Lord, thanks to his wife.  He is in some financial difficulties, and so, he takes a job that is a ""kill for hire"" job.  The film portrays beautifully, the conflict within a man, as he faces the option of actually killing another man.  In several ways, Clint makes this point.And while Clint and his partners get paid, it seems a very bittersweet ending as in the process, the great tragedy of the loss of his friend's life to torture occurred.  So little is known really about what makes a person do some of the things they do, and yet, Clint makes these almost ephemeral feelings come to life visually, in this film.In some ways, perhaps Clint's very best film, ""The Unforgiven"" is not only a wonderful ""period piece"" but also, truly a statement on the character of people.",5,Many Unforgiven,1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1261,"['who', 'are', 'fans', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'know', 'when', 'Clint', 'movie', 'always', 'saying', 'something', 'what', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'Unforgiven', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'one', 'most', 'visual', 'depiction', 'what', 'man', 'especially', 'what', 'man', 'was', 'Wild', 'West', 'transitions', 'man', 'tried', 'make', 'sometimes', 'successfully', 'sometimes', 'not.His', 'morality', 'pure', 'film', 'ex-gunfighter', 'who', 'seen', 'good', 'way', 'Lord', 'thanks', 'wife', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'so', 'job', 'kill', 'hire', 'job', 'film', 'beautifully', 'conflict', 'man', 'option', 'actually', 'killing', 'man', 'several', 'ways', 'Clint', 'point.And', 'Clint', 'partners', 'get', 'paid', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'process', 'great', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'friend', 'life', 'torture', 'occurred', 'So', 'little', 'known', 'really', 'what', 'person', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'yet', 'Clint', 'almost', 'ephemeral', 'feelings', 'come', 'life', 'visually', 'film.In', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'Clint', 'very', 'best', 'film', 'Unforgiven', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'period', 'piece', 'also', 'truly', 'statement', 'character', 'people']",Unforgiven Snap Case

It's also directed by two-time Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood(Best Director, ""Unforgiven"" & ""Million Dollar Baby""), who also stars.It also features two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman (Best Actor, ""The French Connection"" and Best Supporting Actor, ""Unforgiven"") andOscar winner Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, ""Million Dollar Baby""). I've never been a big fan of westerns and never really had a desire to see this movie, until I got into the HBO show ""Deadwood"" which made me want to look back at some western films. Well, ""Unforgiven"" is a masterpiece on many levels...Not just as a western. As scripted by David Webb Peoples, ""Unforgiven"" opens as two men viciously cut a prostitute's face with a knife in the town of Big Whiskey. When the sheriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) shows up he hands down their punishment. Give the owner of the house a few horses. Outraged, the prostitutes begin to offer men $1000 dollars to kill the men who did it. Jump over to Kansas and we meet Bill Munney (Eastwood, in one of his best performances), a former outlaw, who has changed his ways since getting married. But, now, his wife is dead and he's left with his two young children. One day, a kid (about 20) shows up at his house identifying himself as The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The Kid tells Bill about the prostitute's offer and asks Bill to be his partner; Bill quickly turns him down, but eventually changes his mind and rides out into the country to catch up with the Kid. Along the way, Bill stops at his old friend Ned's (Freeman) place and Ned joins him. The late Richard Harris co-stars as a killer-for-hire named English Bob, who's character pretty much could've been erased. Anyway, this movie is probably my third favorite film directed by Eastwood; It's right below Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie is entertaining, dramatic, and features Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman giving some of the best performances of their careers. The chances of someone being disappointed with a film like this are very slim; this is just really one of the great movies of the last 20 years.GRADE: A",5,One of the Best Western Films Ever Made,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2259,"['Unforgiven', 'took', 'home', '4', 'Acadmemy', 'Awards', 'back', '1992', 'number', '98', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', 'milestone', 'western', 'cinema', 'also', 'directed', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Best', 'Director', 'Unforgiven', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'who', 'also', 'stars.It', 'also', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Best', 'Actor', 'French', 'Connection', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Unforgiven', 'andOscar', 'winner', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'westerns', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'movie', 'got', 'HBO', 'show', 'Deadwood', 'made', 'want', 'look', 'back', 'western', 'films', 'Well', 'Unforgiven', 'masterpiece', 'many', 'levels', 'Not', 'just', 'western', 'scripted', 'David', 'Webb', 'Peoples', 'Unforgiven', 'two', 'men', 'viciously', 'cut', 'prostitute', 'face', 'knife', 'town', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'When', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Dagget', 'Hackman', 'up', 'down', 'punishment', 'Give', 'owner', 'house', 'few', 'horses', 'Outraged', 'prostitutes', 'begin', 'offer', 'men', '1000', 'dollars', 'kill', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'Jump', 'Kansas', 'meet', 'Bill', 'Munney', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'former', 'outlaw', 'who', 'changed', 'ways', 'getting', 'married', 'now', 'wife', 'dead', 'left', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'One', 'day', 'kid', '20', 'up', 'house', 'identifying', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'Kid', 'Bill', 'prostitute', 'offer', 'asks', 'Bill', 'be', 'partner', 'Bill', 'quickly', 'down', 'eventually', 'mind', 'out', 'country', 'catch', 'up', 'Kid', 'way', 'Bill', 'old', 'friend', 'Ned', 'Freeman', 'place', 'Ned', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'co-stars', 'killer-for-hire', 'named', 'English', 'Bob', 'who', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'erased', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'probably', 'third', 'favorite', 'film', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'right', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'features', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'Hackman', 'giving', 'best', 'performances', 'careers', 'chances', 'someone', 'being', 'disappointed', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'slim', 'just', 'really', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'last', '20', 'years.GRADE']",Unforgiven Snap Case

In that movie, there was one hero anyway, well maybe 2 if you count Will Kane's wife when the story ends. At the end of this violent Western epic, everyone has blood on their hands. It tells the truth of violence, legal or illegal. There are no heroes when one is dealing violence and death. The entire cast is one of the finest ensembles ever brought together. It is surely the equal of the cast of The Wild Bunch, and maybe even superior. Gene Hackman is brilliant as the psycopathic bully of a Town Sherrif. Richard Harris is chilling as a murderous Bounty Hunter. He is traveling with his own personal so-called biographer who is writing his exploits for the pulp novels. Then there is Morgan Freeman, one of his finest most complex performances in his career as Eastwood's friend and partner in murder. In the end, though, this film is about Clint Eastwood. We first meet him as a sod buster farming the ruins of a life, caring for his two children and mourning his deceased wife. He can barely speak above a whisper he is so gentle and cowed. But we soon learn he is a man of violent past deeds of mayhem and murder. He admits to killing one of everything that ever walked on the earth and more. Hired on by a young wanna-be gun slinger, he and Freeman head off to avenge the stabbing, not fatal, of a prostitute on a frontier town. The film is incredibly violent, and matter of fact about it as well. It is filmed with a very dark palette, with dark night scenes and dimly lit interiors that add an almost palpable sense of the times.

91167,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0790729644,K. Driscoll,"[11, 14]","This is great filmmaking. The acting of Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Clint Eastwood is as good as these four greats can get and they are supported by a highly dedicated cast. The screenplay is perfectly written with as much memorable dialogue as some of the greatest films ever made. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest films ever made.The entire film draws a clear definition of William Munney as perhaps the evilest man to ever live and what we the audience sees is a person we can relate to on many levels. In Eastwood's character we see our own darkest sides, our own mistakes and the unintended consequences that unknowingly follow our decisions.At the beginning we see a struggling man looking to avoid the ways of his past, something which he may have seen as the easy road at the time but now is or has been in his self administered rehabilitation with his farm and his children. Here the struggle may be too much to handle and he justifies his decision in returning to his old ways to make it through the impoverished times that have followed his wife's death. The psychology is not obvious in this film but runs far deeper than most films by a mile. We set the stage to see an efficient assassin that has turned around return to the world he did everything to avoid, and return he does.The most incredible dynamic here is that Munney is the clear villain in perspective, but that Hollywood cliche is more blurred here than any other movie I have ever seen (even the Godfather). The man we essentially find ourselves rooting against (Hackman) is a man of the law but ironically we find ourselves caring for the killer played by Eastwood. He is an anti-hero in which we must question our justification in liking him. The idea of revenge seems as natural as breathing in this setting, so we cheer as this killer steps onto his stage one last time to show his would be contenders who is the baddest cowboy of them all.

91169,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,0790729644,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 8]","I don't consider myself a particularly big fan of Clint Eastwood, at least as an actor. To me, he always seems to play the same kind of character in nearly every movie he's in. Occasionally, he'll find some fresh notes to play within his narrow range, but, despite his legendary status in Hollywood, I would hardly classify him as one of the finest actors of our time (although that probably won't stop Hollywood award shows from honoring him for Lifetime Achievement awards and such). That said, with the films that he's directed that I've seen, I'd dare to say that he might be a better director than actor. I have yet to see his most recent (and much-hyped) film MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but I was deeply sobered by his near-great MYSTIC RIVER (despite its total washout of a mystery plot), and, seeing this Academy Award-winning 1992 film recently, I was no less impressed by this film.UNFORGIVEN is as de-glamorized a Western movie as you are likely to see. There is no real nobility to be found in any of these characters the way there was with, say, Gary Cooper's Will Kane in HIGH NOON. Eastwood's William Munny, for example, is not a hero, but a broken-down, desperate man who is trying to escape his troubled past. Visually, there are some beautifully pictorial shots of the wide open spaces of the plains bathed in (rather mild) sunlight, but most of the time Eastwood and cinematographer Jack N. Green light the proceedings in a doom-filled atmosphere that might come off as heavy-handed to some, but is totally befitting its theme: how physical violence can be violent to the human soul. On the level of action, there is no exciting buildup to the final showdown, and even as it occurs, there is no glamor to be found, no catharsis. Instead of exhilaration, there is a profound note of tragedy as this film ends. A lot of action movies make you believe that taking violent revenge on someone is a satisfying way of closure. In UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood makes clear that there is no real satisfaction to be found in any kind of violence, provoked or not. This is perhaps an important film to see simply as a startling corrective to all the soulless spectacles of violence that seem to be the trademark of action films these days, movies that make you cheer violence and gets you in a sadistic mood, whereas Eastwood stresses its ugliness, both physically and mentally.UNFORGIVEN is helped immensely---for once---by Eastwood's own performance. Technically, he approaches his role in basically the same way he did with his Man With No Name performances in those Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns---tough, gruff, distanced. This William Munny is not much of a stretch for him. And yet there is an extra weariness to his performance here; you get the sense that he is trying to resist his more violent impulses, that he is always trying to tell himself, ""I'm just here to get money, I'm just here to get money."" Eastwood also has one scene which seems to cut through his steely persona: as he is in the midst of a delirious fever, there is a real, poignant touch of desperate emotion in his voice as he exclaims that he sees his own late wife, among other delirium-induced visions. That one scene is perhaps the closest I've seen Eastwood as an actor approach some emotion other than just anger. The other performances are good, but Eastwood's, in its own way, is rather special.UNFORGIVEN is admittedly a little plodding, but then Eastwood has never been one of those showboating directors who indulge in style for its own sake. He is more concerned with characters than with mere action here, and his deliberate approach to the material gives his themes room to breathe and grow in the mind of the receptive viewer. This is a powerful examination of the ugliness of violence, and it will certainly stay with you after it's over.

This movie is simple, dark and yet highly complex in its superb script and the outstanding performances by all concerned.  Few westerns will draw you into the lead characters as this one does.  Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the sorely missed Richard Harris all deserved awards for their collective performances.  What is a western without Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman!The premise:Welcome to Big Whiskey Wyoming, where in a small ""billiards"" saloon, a cowboy gets angry at a whore and, with the help of his buddy, cuts her face up.  The other ""women"" of the establishment, pool their money and start telling everybody that they're offering a reward to whoever kills these two young cowboys.  This is precipitated by Gene Hackmans character Little Bill, who essentially doesn't punish them for their crime.Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, who in his earlier days was every bit one of the worst, meanest gunslingers in the west.  Some ten years prior to the events at the beginning of this fine film, William Munny met his wife Claudia, who turned this serious gunslinger into a family man, unfortunately for him and his little children, his wife died three years prior.  He is now a poor pig farmer, with two little children.The son of one of his old riding buddies has heard about this reward and seeks out William Munnys assistance in tracking down these unpunished criminals.  After some hesitation, he seeks out his friend Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, one of the finest actors of our day.  The three of them head north to seek out the reward.What follows is clearly a movie that while, for the better part is melodramatic; it is that melodrama that is gripping.  All those who received accolades for this fine film, richly deserved those accolades.This exceptional film that graced the silver screen so beautifully and then the home theater, deserves a hallowed place on ones DVD rack and is perfectly well suited to repeated viewings.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all, even those who may not find themselves interested in westerns will find this film highly compelling.  {ssintrepid}",5,Unforgiven - 1992's Best Picture winner!,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,2189,"['Unforgiven', 'clearly', 'top', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'simple', 'dark', 'yet', 'highly', 'complex', 'superb', 'script', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'concerned', 'Few', 'westerns', 'will', 'draw', 'lead', 'characters', 'one', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'deserved', 'awards', 'collective', 'performances', 'What', 'western', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'premise', 'Welcome', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'small', 'billiards', 'saloon', 'cowboy', 'angry', 'whore', 'help', 'buddy', 'face', 'up', 'other', 'women', 'establishment', 'pool', 'money', 'start', 'telling', 'everybody', ""'re"", 'offering', 'reward', 'whoever', 'kills', 'two', 'young', 'cowboys', 'precipitated', 'Gene', 'Hackmans', 'character', 'Little', 'Bill', 'who', 'essentially', ""n't"", 'punish', 'crime.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'William', 'Munny', 'who', 'earlier', 'days', 'was', 'bit', 'one', 'worst', 'meanest', 'gunslingers', 'west', 'ten', 'years', 'prior', 'events', 'beginning', 'fine', 'film', 'William', 'Munny', 'met', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'who', 'turned', 'serious', 'gunslinger', 'family', 'man', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'children', 'wife', 'died', 'three', 'years', 'prior', 'now', 'poor', 'pig', 'farmer', 'two', 'little', 'children.The', 'son', 'one', 'old', 'riding', 'buddies', 'heard', 'reward', 'out', 'William', 'Munnys', 'assistance', 'tracking', 'down', 'unpunished', 'criminals', 'hesitation', 'out', 'friend', 'Ned', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'day', 'three', 'head', 'north', 'seek', 'out', 'reward.What', 'clearly', 'movie', 'better', 'part', 'melodramatic', 'melodrama', 'gripping', 'who', 'received', 'accolades', 'fine', 'film', 'richly', 'deserved', 'accolades.This', 'exceptional', 'film', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'so', 'beautifully', 'then', 'home', 'theater', 'hallowed', 'place', 'ones', 'DVD', 'rack', 'perfectly', 'well', 'suited', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'highly', 'recommend', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'interested', 'westerns', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'highly', 'compelling', 'ssintrepid']",Unforgiven Snap Case

I am so impressed with it.  I've been watching the movies that made Time Magazine's list of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and very few of them can compare to this one, which happens to be on their list.  Their list should be honored to include Unforgiven, and not the other way around, because the Time Magazine list also includes a lot of inferior films to this one, like Citizen Kane, which can't hold a candle to Unforgiven.Clint Eastwood is a retired gunslinger raising two small children alone because his beloved wife died.  He accepts a job to kill two vicious men who mutilated a whore.  The bounty, raised by the whore's co-workers, is $1,000.  He has two other gunslingers to help with the job - Morgan Freeman and some young punk with bad vision.Gene Hackman plays the brutal sheriff who refuses to punish the evildoers.  He lets them go free, with a fine.  This infuriates the other whores, resulting in their offering a bounty.Character development and realism are two of the strongest traits of this great film.  It has a satisfying ending as well, which is important to me.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  You've found one of the greatest films ever made.

It well deserves this ranking, if not a higher one. The movie features stellar acting, amazing dialogue, gorgeous landscapes, and a compelling story of a gunfighter who is trying to ""do right"" and leave behind his previous life of violence.Eastwood is only lured back into strapping on his guns because his children are near starving, and the cause is just - a prostitute was cruelly sliced up by a cowboy. He enlists friend Freeman to help him with his task. Hackman and Harris are superb as other gun-wearing characters in this investigation of motives and characters.Every person here feels authentic and real. The Sheriff wants to keep the peace, but can be a bully in his task. He has a quiet home he's trying to build, and he enjoys sharing his experiences. Freeman's relationship with his wife, the gentle way he deals with Woolvett, how he handles the shooting scene, are all amazing to watch. In each case the watcher gets drawn into what is happening through the subtle dialogue and the character's actions, rather than with bland statements found in many other westerns.It's interesting that I watched this back-to-back with Shane. I am still surprised that Unforgiven ranks ""worse"" than Shane on the AFI lists. They handle extremely similar topics - how an ex-gunfighter copes with a world that has moved on around him. But Unforgiven is full of rounded characters, of powerful dialogue, and of a world we can immerse in. When Eastwood returns home at the end, it's an extremely powerful moment, and there was a real sense of the transformation which had occurred over the course of the film.Unforgiven also gets great credit for how well it involves women in the storyline. Many westerns seem to feel that women were non-existent in the West, only there to be stolen by ""wild Indians"" or to scream in horror as their menfolk went off to do some fighting. In Unforgiven, we get a range of very powerful female characters. The main group are the prostitutes, who take a stand against being treated like property and who end up having an impact with their actions. Even Freeman's wife gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the reluctant one left behind.Well deserving of winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Supporting Actor for Hackman's Sheriff character. To me this is what a western should be all about. The challenges of living in a rough land, the challenges of dealing with the tumultuous societal changes that were going on, the clashes between different groups of people, and the rough, wild, fantastically beautiful scenery that it was all set in.",5,A True Western Classic,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,2697,"['Unforgiven', 'earned', '98', 'spot', 'initial', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'listing', 'moved', 'up', '68', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'revote', 'well', 'ranking', 'not', 'higher', 'one', 'movie', 'stellar', 'acting', 'amazing', 'dialogue', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes', 'compelling', 'story', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'leave', 'previous', 'life', 'violence.Eastwood', 'only', 'lured', 'back', 'strapping', 'guns', 'children', 'are', 'starving', 'cause', 'just', 'prostitute', 'was', 'cruelly', 'sliced', 'up', 'cowboy', 'friend', 'Freeman', 'help', 'task', 'Hackman', 'Harris', 'are', 'superb', 'other', 'gun-wearing', 'characters', 'investigation', 'motives', 'characters.Every', 'person', 'here', 'authentic', 'real', 'Sheriff', 'keep', 'peace', 'can', 'be', 'bully', 'task', 'quiet', 'home', 'trying', 'build', 'sharing', 'experiences', 'Freeman', 'relationship', 'wife', 'gentle', 'way', 'Woolvett', 'how', 'shooting', 'scene', 'are', 'amazing', 'watch', 'case', 'watcher', 'drawn', 'what', 'happening', 'subtle', 'dialogue', 'character', 'actions', 'rather', 'bland', 'statements', 'found', 'many', 'other', 'westerns.It', 'interesting', 'watched', 'back-to-back', 'Shane', 'am', 'still', 'surprised', 'Unforgiven', 'worse', 'Shane', 'AFI', 'lists', 'handle', 'extremely', 'similar', 'topics', 'how', 'ex-gunfighter', 'copes', 'world', 'moved', 'Unforgiven', 'full', 'rounded', 'characters', 'powerful', 'dialogue', 'world', 'can', 'immerse', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'home', 'end', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'moment', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'sense', 'transformation', 'had', 'occurred', 'course', 'film.Unforgiven', 'also', 'great', 'credit', 'how', 'well', 'women', 'storyline', 'Many', 'westerns', 'seem', 'feel', 'women', 'were', 'non-existent', 'West', 'only', 'be', 'stolen', 'wild', 'Indians', 'scream', 'horror', 'menfolk', 'went', 'do', 'fighting', 'Unforgiven', 'get', 'range', 'very', 'powerful', 'female', 'characters', 'main', 'group', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'take', 'stand', 'being', 'treated', 'property', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'impact', 'actions', 'Even', 'Freeman', 'wife', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'reluctant', 'one', 'left', 'behind.Well', 'deserving', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Hackman', 'Sheriff', 'character', 'what', 'western', 'should', 'be', 'challenges', 'living', 'rough', 'land', 'challenges', 'dealing', 'tumultuous', 'societal', 'changes', 'were', 'going', 'clashes', 'different', 'groups', 'people', 'rough', 'wild', 'fantastically', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'was', 'set']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The 1992 movie is complex, it examines what is good and evil, the viewpoints of age and youth, finding courage, doing what is important while feeling guilt and yet finding redemption through change.This is a Western set in Kansas and Big Whisky, Wyoming.  The opening scene is in Kansas and shows William Munny, a retired gunslinger, chasing pigs with his two young children, a girl and a boy.  Munny is also a widower and has to make do on his small farm.  He has sworn off gun-slinging and wild women to honor the love of his life, his wife who  died at age 29.  She turned his life around and though poor, he felt good about making up for his past life of violence, drinking and wild women.A young man on a horse comes up to Munny.  He is the Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  He has a proposal to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute in Wyoming.  There is reward money of $1,000 and they can split two ways.  Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, but realizes that it would help his children have a better future if he could afford to do something else.After a few days he sets off with his best friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) also a retired gunfighter.  Ned reluctantly leaves his Native American Wife, ""Two Feathers"" to go along on the hit.  Two Feathers is near Munny's farm and agrees to check in on his children and help when they need her.The trio get to the town of Big Whisky and find the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), enforcing gun control and using his power as he sees fit.

91194,A36EW68H08UOCS,0790729644,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","I'm not certain how much I would like ""Unforgiven"" if I had never seen a Western before.  I suspect I would still consider it a masterpiece.  But approaching it from the perspective of decades of watching ""Cowboys and Indians"", I view Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner as one of the most important achievements in film history.Eastwood created the Man With No Name personna in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, masterpieces that changed the genre.  But Unforgiven elevates ""The Western"" to a level I think will never be approached again.  ""Unforgiven"" is to The Western as ""The Godfather"" is to the gangster movie.In old Lone Ranger era Westerns the hero wore a white hat and dispatched bad guys in morally unambiguous gunfights.  By the end of John Wayne's career in cowboy pictures heroes weren't as clearly defined. In pictures like ""The Searchers"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" the heroes had skeletons in their closets. Then Leone's films made the West seem an even grittier, sweatier place, and there was more than a little anti-hero in the leading characters.  Still, gunfights happened quickly and the winner was always a dead-eye who could shoot the wings off a gnat at a hundred paces.  The losers of gunfights fell quickly and silently to their death.In Unforgiven Eastwood gives us a vision we can imagine as closer to the truth.  His character William Munny was once ""a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition,"" as we're told in the opening title card.  We learn Bill Munny was once the most dangerous of a group of outlaws in hints that are given leading up to the climax.  But Munny has been changed by marriage.  His comely wife has died of smallpox, leaving him a poor pig farmer with two children.  He hasn't shot at a man in eleven years.  We can feel his struggle for redemption.  In addition to giving up his previous life as a criminal, he has stopped drinking and, when given the opportunity at a woman younger and prettier than him, he declines out of respect for his dead wife.But Bill Munny's demons are old and powerful.  A group of prostitutes pool their money and spread the word that they'll pay a bounty for the death of a bad-tempered cowboy who cuts one of them. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, who has heard of William Munny and how he was the meanest cold-blooded killer alive.  Munny initially declines the Kid's offer, but the Munny family is poor, and the prostitutes' bounty is tempting.Bill rounds up old partner Ned Logan, played by the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.  You get the feeling that Ned wasn't as bad as Munny in the old days, but you also get the idea that Ned isn't as ""reformed"" as Munny.Gene Hackman gives a superlative performance as Little Bill Daggett, the Sheriff of the town with the prostitutes.  In an early scene Daggett beats bounty hunter ""English Bob"" (played by the late, great Richard Harris) half to death, and vows to do worse to any other bounty hunter's seeking the ""whores' gold"".Unforgiven re-writes the legend of the west.  Shifting shades of grey replace black and white.  The Man With No Name could shoot a gnat mid-flight, but William Munny takes shooting practice at a tin can with a pistol, misses several shots, then finally dispatches the can with a shotgun blast. The gunfight losers in old school westerns did their dying quickly and quietly, while a victim in this film dies slowly, in agony and begging for a drink of water.In an expository scene halfway through Hackman explains to a hack writer (acting as a one-man Greek chorus and wonderfully played by Saul Rubinek) that the stories of famous gunfights that circulated among taverns and dime novels of the day were wild exaggerations made up by the survivors to make themselves look faster and deadlier and more noble than they really were.Eastwood gives a master's class in film story-telling.

Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in ""Million Dollar Baby"") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one ""last"" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.

91206,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0790729644,Michael Crane,"[141, 158]","&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is much more than a breathtaking Western, it's an amazing film altogether. With elements of drama and film noir, this is a picture that shows us that there are some demons you can never put to rest, no matter how hard you try.Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny, a once notorious and violent killer and thief. If Munny didn't like you, chances were that you wouldn't live long enough for him to tell you so. However, that was in the old days. Now, he's just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still in mourning of his dead wife. He's been straight for years and is trying to put all of his demons to rest, but you still get the feeling that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be haunted. An opportunity comes to him in the name of `The Schofield Kid.' He gives him a chance to be his partner and have him help on a bounty. Knowing that the money could help his family out, Munny finally decides to take the Kid up on the offer. He also brings with him Ned Logan; an old friend and partner. Little Bill Daggett is the Sheriff in town, and the thing he hates most are assassins. He will do anything in his power to take care of them and make sure they do not succeed on their killing. The last remaining part of the film stands out the most and is so well executed that it catches you off guard.This really is a great film and it surprised me like I would've never expected. I don't like Westerns all that much, but this isn't your typical Western. That is probably why I enjoyed it so much. There is so much story and character development. You really are able to sympathize with Munny, despite his dark and violent past. You want him to be able to get on with his life and forget the past, although you know deep down that things will never be put to rest, and agreeing to go on this bounty only increases the chance of Munny returning back to his old ways. This isn't a Western where the line between good guys and bad guys are clear and the storyline is simple; good guy kills bad guys and gets the girl in the end. No, you won't find any of this here. In this story there are no clear good guys or bad guys, just regular people. This is a real story with real characters that you can feel for. There is a huge issue of morality that takes place, which is something you don't see much in Westerns.Not only does Eastwood do a terrific job in acting, he also does an amazing job as director. He's a man with vision, and who more qualified to direct a film of this magnitude. I don't think the film would had been as successful had it been done by someone else. The cast is also outstanding. Morgan Freeman really does his role justice. Gene Hackman spreads fear inside of you as the mean and tough Sheriff. Richard Harris also deserves mention for his part as well. (He is sorely missed. He was a very gifted actor.) Everyone really did great in their roles and really knew how to bring the film together.This new DVD edition really does the movie justice. Though it may not have the most special features, the one feature that stands out the most is the new digital transfer that really makes the picture look crystal clear. The sound is also very impressive as well. Special features included are as follows: Audio commentary by Film Critic and Eastwood Biographer Richard Schickel, Eastwood film highlights, awards list, trailer, and 4 documentaries.&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is really a spectacular film that deserved the Academy Awards for &quot;Best Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Director.&quot; And it is a true masterpiece in my eyes. I think anyone who is a lover of films should give this one a try. Remember, you do not have to be a Western fan to enjoy this, because I am certainly not one. Some people may be disappointed in the lack of action or shoot-outs, but the film is about so much more. It's about morals and trying to put the past to rest. It's also about accepting who you are and that there are some things you will never be able to change, no matter how hard you try. This will end up being one of my favorites in no time. I was very surprised, indeed.",5,"&quot;We all have it coming, Kid.&quot; A True Classic Masterpiece",1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,4121,"['quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'Western', 'amazing', 'film', 'altogether', 'elements', 'drama', 'film', 'noir', 'picture', 'are', 'demons', 'can', 'never', 'put', 'rest', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'stars', 'William', 'Munny', 'once', 'notorious', 'violent', 'killer', 'thief', 'Munny', 'did', ""n't"", 'chances', 'were', 'would', ""n't"", 'live', 'long', 'enough', 'tell', 'so', 'However', 'was', 'old', 'days', 'Now', 'just', 'quiet', 'tired', 'farmer', 'who', 'devoted', 'father', 'still', 'mourning', 'dead', 'wife', 'been', 'straight', 'years', 'trying', 'put', 'demons', 'rest', 'still', 'get', 'feeling', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'haunted', 'opportunity', 'name', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'chance', 'be', 'partner', 'have', 'help', 'bounty', 'Knowing', 'money', 'could', 'help', 'family', 'out', 'Munny', 'finally', 'take', 'Kid', 'up', 'offer', 'also', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'old', 'friend', 'partner', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'Sheriff', 'town', 'thing', 'most', 'are', 'assassins', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'power', 'take', 'care', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'killing', 'last', 'remaining', 'part', 'film', 'out', 'most', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'off', 'guard.This', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'surprised', 'would', ""'ve"", 'never', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Westerns', 'that', 'much', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Western', 'probably', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'are', 'able', 'sympathize', 'Munny', 'dark', 'violent', 'past', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'life', 'forget', 'past', 'know', 'deep', 'down', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'put', 'rest', 'agreeing', 'go', 'bounty', 'only', 'chance', 'Munny', 'returning', 'back', 'old', 'ways', ""n't"", 'Western', 'where', 'line', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'clear', 'storyline', 'simple', 'good', 'guy', 'kills', 'bad', 'guys', 'girl', 'end', 'No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'story', 'are', 'clear', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'regular', 'people', 'real', 'story', 'real', 'characters', 'can', 'feel', 'huge', 'issue', 'morality', 'place', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Westerns.Not', 'only', 'Eastwood', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'acting', 'also', 'amazing', 'job', 'director', 'man', 'vision', 'who', 'more', 'qualified', 'direct', 'film', 'magnitude', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'successful', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'someone', 'else', 'cast', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'really', 'role', 'justice', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'fear', 'mean', 'tough', 'Sheriff', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'also', 'mention', 'part', 'well', 'sorely', 'missed', 'was', 'very', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Everyone', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'roles', 'really', 'knew', 'how', 'bring', 'film', 'together.This', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', 'really', 'movie', 'justice', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'feature', 'out', 'most', 'new', 'digital', 'transfer', 'really', 'picture', 'look', 'crystal', 'clear', 'sound', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'well', 'Special', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Eastwood', 'Biographer', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'highlights', 'awards', 'list', 'trailer', '4', 'documentaries.', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'really', 'spectacular', 'film', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'quot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'quot', 'quot', 'Best', 'Director.', 'quot', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'eyes', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'lover', 'films', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'Remember', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'Western', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'action', 'shoot-outs', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'morals', 'trying', 'put', 'past', 'rest', 'also', 'accepting', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'change', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'favorites', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'indeed']",Unforgiven Snap Case

But Eastwood is after more here than the heroic anonymity that that character afforded him.  No, his ""last"" Western (and I dare say this film proves that the genre is too flexible to be dead) deals with the nihilism of the old West, and the grey area between good and evil that the ""new"" kind of outlaw must deal with.  And how that outlaw is no longer a perfect, indestructible beast, but a man with tough choices to make.  Eastwood did a wonderful job putting all these issues up on screen.Eastwood is a very interesting actor.  He really isn't technically proficient, and if he's given too much dialogue, he's liable to trample all over the reality of the moment.  But give him a chance to stare at you with those steely eyes, or answer a threat from an enemy with a simple ""Yeah"", and he'll knock you out of your boots.  He gives himself ample opportunities to work to those strengths here.Gene Hackman, on the other hand, can put the fear of God in you with a twinkle of his eye.  I don't think this man has it in him to deliver a bad performance.  And here he gets to play the Gene Hackman role that defines all Gene Hackman roles.  His Little Bill is authoritative, fearless, feared, and especially charismatic.  Also good here are Morgan Freeman, although a tad underused in what amounts to a sidekick role, and Richard Harris as an English gunfighter whose legend may be purely mythical.  Unimpressive in the face of these acting giants is Jaimz Woolvett as the Schofield Kid.  I suppose his youthful bluster is expected, he being the new generation and all.  But his delivery felt a little too over-the-top, especially in a movie striving for realism.I hesitate in praising this movie too much, for it didn't stick to its guns, so to speak.  I'm speaking of the ending, and I promise here not to reveal any spoilers.  Let's just say that if the object was to turn the Western on its head, then I don't believe that they chose the appropriate way to tie up the narrative.

He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and a wanna-be gunslinger named &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett). The three set out to Big Whiskey, Wyoming where a group of prostitutes are seeking revenge for one of their own that gets raped, and cut up extremely bad. &quot;Little&quot; Bill Dagget ( Gene Hackman)is the sadistic and corrupt sheriff of Big Whiskey, and is desperate to keep bounty hunters from collecting on the money that the prostitutes are offering. English Bob(Richard Harris), is a legendary gunfighter who rides into town, and is also looking to collect on the reward. English Bob just happens to be an old rival of &quot;Little&quot; Bill's, and Bill is looking to make an example out of him. But the real focus of the film is on Will Munny, and the conflict that he must face within himself. As the story unfolds, Munny tries to convince himself that his return to the life is just temporary. But the consequences of his actions, could last him a lifetime...&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood succeeded on both sides of the camera with his role of William Munny, and his direction of the film. However, Eastwood is not the only reason for the film's success. The rest of the cast could not have done a better job. Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, and Richard Harris all give amazing performances. However the standout performance of the film goes to Gene Hackman as the sadistic sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot;. It is one of the best performances of his career. The musical score is haunting as well as beautiful, and it really drives the film. The cinematography is amazing as well. Everything about the film is perfect. The film was winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Clint Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor- Gene Hackman.I was overjoyed when the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD was released. The extras are worth the price alone. Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, as well as commentary from Eastwood and his biographer Richard Schickel. Disc 2 brings 4 outstanding documentaries which includes interviews with the entire cast, the making of the film, and a lot more.

Beginning with an intense knife attack in a whorehouse and ending with a final, soul-wrenching showdown between Eastwood and Gene Hackman (who won an oscar for his trouble), the film never lets up on its sheer dramatic force or its provoking moral play on violence and its inevitable consequences.Clint Eastwood plays a hog farmer named William Munny, now leading a relatively normal life after decades of being a feared and remorseless bounty hunter, with his loyal partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  But Munny now is down on his luck, with the farm struggling.  When a chance comes about for a $1000 bounty put up by angry prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Munny and Logan take up the offer, along with a green but eager fellow hunter (Jaimz Woolvett).  Meanwhile, in Big Whiskey, the town sherriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) has put a ruthless lid on the bounty, and beats up an old rival who comes looking for it, English Bob (Richard Harris) who by the way shoots chinese men working on the railroad for kicks and giggles.When I first learned &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was garnered with best picture and best director oscars, I thought it had something to do with Eastwood being the old vanguard that he is and not so much talent oriented.  I could not have been more wrong.  Eastwoods' direction is outstanding, building scenes of dynamic character development with the hand of a skilled craftsman.  Every extra, every flat and otherwise unimportant chracter shows real, human emotion on their face, which is something I have never quite seen on screen before. Eastwoods' direction is aided by excellent, oscar-winning film editing.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a prime example of direction and editing working off each to mold scenes of true power, and give the viewer a real sense and feel for the surroundings.  And the film is beautifully shot in the stunning scenery near Alberta, Canada.  Filmmaking doesn't get much better than &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and Eastwood is far more than just Hollywoods' old vanguard.",5,&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is Unforgettable,1067212800,"10 27, 2003",2003,2379,"['was', 'forced', 'give', 'one', 'word', 'everything', 'else', 'everything', 'else', 'read', 'see', 'hear', 'play', 'here', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'use', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'incredibly', 'compelling', 'western', 'quot', 'Unforgiven.', 'quot', 'date', 'most', 'story', 'driven', 'theme', 'driven', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'western', 'otherwise', 'Beginning', 'intense', 'knife', 'attack', 'whorehouse', 'ending', 'final', 'soul-wrenching', 'showdown', 'Eastwood', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'won', 'oscar', 'trouble', 'film', 'never', 'up', 'sheer', 'dramatic', 'force', 'provoking', 'moral', 'play', 'violence', 'inevitable', 'consequences.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'hog', 'farmer', 'named', 'William', 'Munny', 'now', 'leading', 'relatively', 'normal', 'life', 'decades', 'being', 'feared', 'remorseless', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'loyal', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Munny', 'now', 'down', 'luck', 'farm', 'struggling', 'When', 'chance', '1000', 'bounty', 'put', 'up', 'angry', 'prostitutes', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Wyoming', 'Munny', 'Logan', 'take', 'up', 'offer', 'green', 'eager', 'fellow', 'hunter', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'Meanwhile', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'town', 'sherriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Dagget', 'Hackman', 'put', 'ruthless', 'lid', 'bounty', 'up', 'old', 'rival', 'who', 'looking', 'English', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'who', 'way', 'shoots', 'chinese', 'men', 'working', 'railroad', 'kicks', 'giggles.When', 'first', 'learned', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'was', 'garnered', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'director', 'oscars', 'thought', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Eastwood', 'being', 'old', 'vanguard', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'oriented', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'Eastwoods', 'direction', 'outstanding', 'building', 'scenes', 'dynamic', 'character', 'development', 'hand', 'skilled', 'craftsman', 'extra', 'flat', 'otherwise', 'unimportant', 'chracter', 'shows', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'face', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'seen', 'screen', 'Eastwoods', 'direction', 'aided', 'excellent', 'oscar-winning', 'film', 'editing', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'prime', 'example', 'direction', 'editing', 'working', 'off', 'mold', 'scenes', 'true', 'power', 'give', 'viewer', 'real', 'sense', 'feel', 'surroundings', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'Alberta', 'Canada', 'Filmmaking', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'Eastwood', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'Hollywoods', 'old', 'vanguard']",Unforgiven Snap Case

Critics hailed this as a &quot;revisionist western,&quot; but if you look back over Clint Eastwood's entire career, you see that Unforgiven is just par for the course.  Eastwood's westerns have always been brutally violent, but unglamorously so.  From the vicious lynching that opens Hang 'Em High, right on through to Unforgiven, Eastwood has unflichingly looked at violence and seen in it our desperation to live.  He rarely has music over violence.  Punches are often soft and wet sounding, instead of always sounding like whipcracks.  It is brutal.  It is difficult.  It hurts.  So, while I don't sing the praises of this movie for any innovation, I do praise it for two things.  First, it embodies and summarizes Eastwood's examination of the Western and American violence.  Second, for the absolutely incredible performance of Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget.  Hackman's performance is one of the best pieces of acting ever captured on film.  David Webb Peoples' script is obviously a big part of that performance, but Hackman's portrayal of the man for whom brutality is a mere tool, who wants only peace, order, and to finish his house, is amazing.  His character is the only one that has figured out that being a dangerous man IS dangerous.  He is the only one of the dangerous men in this film to have found a way out.  Or so he believes.This movie has a lot to say about America.  About the Western genre.  About our voyeuristic love of violence.  And it says it well.  It leaves you with much to consider.

91225,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,0790729644,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Never a truer word has ever been said.  Undoubtadly the best modern day western, Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny (Clint Eastwood who also directed), a once ruthless gunslinger who, along with his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the nephew of one of his old partners (Jaimz Woolvett), are out to collect a bounty on the men who brutalized a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey which is run by the sly, deceitful, and brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).  At first glance that seems to be the story of Unforgiven, but if you look closer there is something else there.  For years, Will Munny tried to deny what he was; a cold blooded theif and murderer and killer of women and children.  For years he tried to believe he was a changed man, but for all those long years there was something growing in this man, something that he couldn't outgun, his true nature.  The scene where he is laying there sickly after being beaten by Little Bill, when he tells Ned about his vision of the Angel of Death, he was seeing himself; and now he will be unleashed in Big Whiskey when he is pushed to his limit.  This is the incredible storytelling that most screen writers only wish they could come up with, and thanks to Eastwood's fantastic direction and incredible performances from him, Hackman, Freeman, and the late Richard Harris in one of his most colorful roles, make Unforgiven a true modern day classic.  It would win the Best Picture Oscar along with Best Editing, and Eastwood would earn an Oscar for Best Director while Hackman would deservingly win for Best Supporting Actor.  While this Special Edition DVD re-release may have some questionable extras (how about a commentary from Eastwood, Hackman, or even screenwriter David Peoples?), this is absolutely worth owning, even if you don't like westerns.",5,"""We've all got it coming""",1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,1827,"['Never', 'truer', 'word', 'ever', 'been', 'said', 'Undoubtadly', 'best', 'modern', 'day', 'western', 'Unforgiven', 'story', 'William', 'Munny', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'once', 'ruthless', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'old', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'nephew', 'one', 'old', 'partners', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'are', 'collect', 'bounty', 'men', 'who', 'brutalized', 'prostitute', 'town', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'run', 'sly', 'deceitful', 'brutal', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'story', 'Unforgiven', 'look', 'closer', 'something', 'else', 'there', 'years', 'Will', 'Munny', 'tried', 'deny', 'what', 'was', 'cold', 'blooded', 'theif', 'murderer', 'killer', 'women', 'children', 'years', 'tried', 'believe', 'was', 'changed', 'man', 'long', 'years', 'there', 'was', 'something', 'growing', 'man', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'outgun', 'true', 'nature', 'scene', 'where', 'laying', 'there', 'sickly', 'being', 'beaten', 'Little', 'Bill', 'when', 'vision', 'Angel', 'Death', 'was', 'seeing', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'unleashed', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'when', 'pushed', 'limit', 'incredible', 'storytelling', 'most', 'screen', 'writers', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'thanks', 'Eastwood', 'fantastic', 'direction', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Hackman', 'Freeman', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'one', 'most', 'colorful', 'roles', 'make', 'Unforgiven', 'true', 'modern', 'day', 'classic', 'would', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Editing', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director', 'Hackman', 'would', 'deservingly', 'win', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 're-release', 'may', 'have', 'questionable', 'extras', 'how', 'commentary', 'Eastwood', 'Hackman', 'even', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Peoples', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'owning', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'westerns']",Unforgiven Snap Case

Gene Hackman makes you loathe him as the prideful and sadistic sheriff Little Bill who rules with an iron fist of justice.  But the Clint Eastwood character, William Munny, is even more interesting.  He portrays an once infamous outlaw, who has softened under years of aging and family responsibility.  Had this film been about William Munny in his youth, he undoubtly would have been the bad guy.  So on one hand, as the ""good"" guy of the film, you don't want to see him become a killer again, but on the other hand you really want to see him kill the bad guys.

91228,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,0790729644,Octavius,"[2, 10]","Clint Eastwood's 1992 somewhat apologetic western on crime and justice in the Old West.  Although well acted with good direction, the film lags in its rather predictable plot and suffers from uninspiring action scenes.The film starts with the senseless mutilation of a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey.  Anxious to keep the peace, Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman) asks the perpetrator to compensate the victim with several horses.  Humiliated and permanently disfigured, the prostitute isn't happy with the offer and raises a bounty for the death of her attacker.  With news of the bounty, widowed Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) leaves his family behind to get some badly needed money. A retired gunslinger left with a delapidated farm and a bleak future for his two children, Bill Munny returns to his life of sin one last time.  He soon joins up with his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) who's also leaving his reformed life for one final reward.  On their way to Big Whiskey, Munny and Logan are joined by The Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), a young hothead who also needs the reward. When the characters arrive in Big Whiskey, they run into gunslingers such as English Bob (Richard Harris)and the impatience of Sheriff Little Bill.  Wanting to keep the peace at all costs, the sheriff will do whatever it takes to keep hired guns out of Big Whiskey.  An unexpected incident leads to a final confrontation between the main characters.Eastwood attempts several things in this film with mixed success.  First, he attempts to break away from the reverse trends in westerns he himself helped form over 30 years before in Sergio Leone's action-packed films.  In those films, the West was depicted as a wasteland of shady characters who could be either villains or heroes depending on the reward: the theme was presented through symbolic action sequences as opposed to extended and unrealistic dialogues using action as only the filler scenes.  In this film, Eastwood sacrifices action for more character study found in some of the older westerns preceding Leone's: the main difference being that characters' motivations are treated with much more realism than those presented in such earlier films. In this film, Eastwood shows that all of the characters are flawed in various ways.  The bounty hunters don't really care if their cause is just as long as the reward is payed; they simply justify their motivations post factum.  The sheriff is a man with honest intentions and his actions, although perhaps varying between inadequate and extreme, are solely in the interests of the community.  All of the characters are victims of their environment who must cope with the realities they are presented with.  Even the actual victim in the film, the prostitute, is depicted as a person who suffered from the consequences of her own immoral profession as opposed to the actions of a deranged criminal.Although this is a good film, I found it to be overrated and  actually less creative than Clint Eastwood's other great western, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  I felt that the latter actually had more character insight and thematic depth than this film even though it didn't have as many stars.  In his attempt to be more sober in portraying the real West, Clint Eastwood seemed to fall in the same trap as earlier westerns by drowning the plot in over-the-top character/psychological studies of people who, realistically, weren't the types to intellectualize things too much. Although I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, this is one which I haven't bothered to buy for the reasons cited: I think it tends to make a better rental.",4,Decent But Overrated,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,3642,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', '1992', 'somewhat', 'apologetic', 'western', 'crime', 'justice', 'Old', 'West', 'well', 'acted', 'good', 'direction', 'film', 'rather', 'predictable', 'plot', 'suffers', 'uninspiring', 'action', 'scenes.The', 'film', 'senseless', 'mutilation', 'prostitute', 'town', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Anxious', 'keep', 'peace', 'Sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Dagget', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'perpetrator', 'compensate', 'victim', 'several', 'horses', 'Humiliated', 'permanently', 'disfigured', 'prostitute', ""n't"", 'happy', 'offer', 'bounty', 'death', 'attacker', 'news', 'bounty', 'widowed', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'family', 'get', 'badly', 'needed', 'money', 'retired', 'gunslinger', 'left', 'delapidated', 'farm', 'bleak', 'future', 'two', 'children', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'returns', 'life', 'sin', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'soon', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'also', 'leaving', 'reformed', 'life', 'one', 'final', 'reward', 'way', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'Munny', 'Logan', 'are', 'joined', 'Shofield', 'Kid', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvet', 'young', 'hothead', 'who', 'also', 'reward', 'When', 'characters', 'arrive', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'run', 'gunslingers', 'such', 'English', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'impatience', 'Sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Wanting', 'keep', 'peace', 'costs', 'sheriff', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'keep', 'hired', 'guns', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'unexpected', 'incident', 'final', 'confrontation', 'main', 'characters.Eastwood', 'attempts', 'several', 'things', 'film', 'mixed', 'success', 'First', 'break', 'away', 'reverse', 'trends', 'westerns', 'helped', 'form', '30', 'years', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'action-packed', 'films', 'films', 'West', 'was', 'depicted', 'wasteland', 'shady', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'villains', 'heroes', 'depending', 'reward', 'theme', 'was', 'presented', 'symbolic', 'action', 'sequences', 'opposed', 'extended', 'unrealistic', 'dialogues', 'using', 'action', 'only', 'filler', 'scenes', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'action', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'found', 'older', 'westerns', 'preceding', 'Leone', 'main', 'difference', 'being', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'treated', 'much', 'more', 'realism', 'presented', 'such', 'earlier', 'films', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'shows', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'various', 'ways', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'cause', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'reward', 'payed', 'simply', 'justify', 'motivations', 'post', 'factum', 'sheriff', 'man', 'honest', 'intentions', 'actions', 'perhaps', 'varying', 'inadequate', 'extreme', 'are', 'solely', 'interests', 'community', 'characters', 'are', 'victims', 'environment', 'who', 'must', 'cope', 'realities', 'are', 'presented', 'Even', 'actual', 'victim', 'film', 'prostitute', 'depicted', 'person', 'who', 'suffered', 'consequences', 'own', 'immoral', 'profession', 'opposed', 'actions', 'deranged', 'criminal.Although', 'good', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'overrated', 'actually', 'less', 'creative', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'other', 'great', 'western', ""'The"", 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'felt', 'latter', 'actually', 'had', 'more', 'character', 'insight', 'thematic', 'depth', 'film', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'many', 'stars', 'attempt', 'be', 'more', 'sober', 'portraying', 'real', 'West', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'seemed', 'fall', 'same', 'trap', 'earlier', 'westerns', 'drowning', 'plot', 'over-the-top', 'character/psychological', 'studies', 'people', 'who', 'realistically', 'were', ""n't"", 'types', 'intellectualize', 'things', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'westerns', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'buy', 'reasons', 'cited', 'think', 'make', 'better', 'rental']",Unforgiven Snap Case

I suppose that most of us are used to westerns where the hero represent the cowboy knight in shining stirrups who saves the day at full personal risk and without reward, and never looses his cool.

What brings him back to his old line of work is simply money - no ideal or heroic act. Throughout the entire story, the viewer's perception on &quot;who's the bad guy and who's the good guy&quot; is constantly changing, indicating a superb screenplay performed by a superb cast &amp; crew.Most of the film is slow and calm, but you can feel the tension building up for the last act, where the entire story takes a 180-degree turn (don't worry - I won't tell). If you'll pay attention, you'll notice that when the change occurs (and you'll notice it - I promise you) a wind suddenly starts to blow - an age-old motif for change.The acting and directing in this film is superb, both by Clint Eastwood (Lead and Director), and by the wonderful Gene Hachman.

By definition, this group of people are old timers whom have always lived within the system.Demographs in part explains why Unforgiven was so well liked by the critic's, and just above average with everyone else.What I understand Clint to be saying is that he was trying to achieve something revolving around the good guy marshal turning out to be the villain.  He said villains usually carried no baggage.  Gene Hackman was a frontier lawman; he had roots in the community.  For ""Gosh's sakes,"" he was building a house.I have seen Unforgiven many times including one of Clint's personal prints.  In am sorry, I did not see it as being that great.  I have discussed this with many people and I think I know why.First off at no time did we see the lawman as a good guy.  Nobody I talked to took the lawman as the good guy.  People from our generation do not automatically see the cops as good guys.  As soon as we are passengers in cars, we are taught to look out for cops and go for our seat belts on sight.  A lot like outlaws of old going for their guns.It was Clint coming in to protect the helpless woman that was the knight is shining armor.  The fact that he was a bounty hunter had nothing to do with it.Maybe Clint was in Spain when L.A. had its riots.  Or that kind of news does not make front page in Carmel.  In any case, the people he played to, saw a different movie than us.They saw ""Popeye Doyle,"" Gene Hackman as a good guy until his villiness became overwhelming.  They were sitting there accepting this violence in the name of law and order until they had to realize they could not stomach it anymore.  Many of us made that decision a long time before Unforgiven.  Maybe they gave Hackman the award for that.Wyatt Earp was accused of Police brutality in Tombstone.  He was paid to sneak up on people, hit them in the back of the head to knock them senseless, and then stick them in jail to sleep it off.  He collected fines before he let them out.The boys were killed at the OK Corral over a misdemeanor, carrying guns within city limits.  Some of them may have even been unarmed when the shooting started.  Some were found unarmed after they were dead.Lieutenant Bascom just out of West Point was promoted by the US army, when he executed Cochise's family and friends for a crime committed after Bascom held them in custody.In a Western filmed near Carmel by Marlin Brando, Karl Malden plays a lawman with a lot of baggage, a wife and a kid, but we do not see him as a good guy.Somehow, I did not see this Western as different.

There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over. Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable. The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently appealing and the period detail is utterly convincing.

91241,A30I207MIU383O,0790729644,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[4, 5]","In 1992 Clint Eastwood finally got around to filming Unforgiven, a script for which he had purchased the rights many years earlier. It is a thoughtful, uncompromising look at how violence begets violence; and that the traditional line between the good and evil is not as clear as it appears on the surface. For film buffs impressed by Oscar, the film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, who turns in one of his finest performances as the town sheriff Little Bill.This tale of retribution begins in a town called Big Whiskey with a drunken cowpoke named Quick Mike slicing up a whore named Delilah's face, after she giggles at size of his male anatomy. When the other prostitutes led by Strawberry Alice (Francis Fischer) go to Little Bill seeking redress, he lets the offending drover and his partner Davey off with a mild punishment that includes the price of a few horses. Incensed at this miscarriage of justice, the women take up a collection to establish a thousand dollar bounty for anyone who will kill the two ranch hands.Upon hearing of the blood money offered, a fledgling, young gunslinger calling himself The Schofield Kid arrives at the farm of William Munny (Eastwood), who is raising two children without a mother and struggling to make ends meet. The kid informs Munny he is seeking his services as paid assassin. Munny subsequently enlists his former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the trio set off for Big Whiskey to snuff out the unsuspecting cowboys.During the long ride to their destination, it is poignant foreshadowing when Will reminds Ned of his wild days as remorseless killer. He vividly describes his ruthless killing of an innocent drover that weighs heavy on his conscience. Nevertheless, Munny reflects that his deceased wife forever ended his drunken, murdering ways with Ned reassuring him that, ""You ain't like that no more"".With intelligence supplied by Skinny the Saloon owner, Little Bill discovers that the whores are offering a reward for the two ranch hands. Acting swiftly, he musters his team of deputies and after nearly beating him to death, sends another bounty hunter named English Bob (Richard Harris) packing. When Will and his comrades arrive in town, the sheriff also inflicts a savage beating on him while he is too sick to defend himself. In spite of this setback, the trio manages to kill Mike's friend Davey in a heart wrenching sequence, which is enough to inspire Ned to forfeit his share of the bounty and head home. Unfortunately, Logan is captured and tortured to death by the sadistic Little Bill.Eastwood the director masterfully demonstrates how unglamorous a killing can be when Schofield shoots Quick Mike while he is using the outhouse. We learn the ultimate irony is that the kid, anxious to prove himself as a bad man, has absolutely no stomach for the taking of a life. Chillingly, it is Will, who after a few swigs of whiskey has no problem transforming back to the precision killing machine of his earlier days. When he discovers that Little Bill has taken Ned's life, Munny slaughters the sheriff, his deputies and the saloon owner who was foolish enough to display Logan's body in front of his establishment.This film is a masterwork of understanding the complexities of human behavior. Though Will Munny is supposed to be the unforgiving killer, he is the protagonist of the story. In a scene acted with near perfection by Eastwood, he wisely reflects to the kid, ""It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man. You take away all he's got an' all he's ever gonna have."" When Schofield attempts to justify his actions, he suggests to Will, ""Well I guess they had it comin"", to which Munny succinctly replies, ""We all have it comin kid.""Though he represents law and order, Little Bill is clearly the antagonist who blindly believes in his own righteousness. When he is gunned down by Will, he incredulously exclaims, ""that I don't deserve to die like this"". Ultimately, it is Munny who has the clearest sense of purpose and in the face of overwhelming odds, remains cool under fire. He teaches Little Bill his last lesson; that deserve has got nothing to do with it.",5,One of the greatest westerns of all time,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,4208,"['1992', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'finally', 'got', 'filming', 'Unforgiven', 'script', 'had', 'purchased', 'rights', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'thoughtful', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'how', 'violence', 'violence', 'traditional', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'surface', 'film', 'buffs', 'impressed', 'Oscar', 'film', 'won', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill.This', 'tale', 'retribution', 'begins', 'town', 'called', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'drunken', 'cowpoke', 'named', 'Quick', 'Mike', 'slicing', 'up', 'whore', 'named', 'Delilah', 'face', 'size', 'male', 'anatomy', 'When', 'other', 'prostitutes', 'led', 'Strawberry', 'Alice', 'Francis', 'Fischer', 'go', 'Little', 'Bill', 'seeking', 'redress', 'offending', 'drover', 'partner', 'Davey', 'off', 'mild', 'punishment', 'price', 'few', 'horses', 'Incensed', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'women', 'take', 'up', 'collection', 'establish', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'bounty', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'kill', 'two', 'ranch', 'hands.Upon', 'hearing', 'blood', 'money', 'offered', 'fledgling', 'young', 'gunslinger', 'calling', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'farm', 'William', 'Munny', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'mother', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'kid', 'Munny', 'seeking', 'services', 'paid', 'assassin', 'Munny', 'subsequently', 'former', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'trio', 'set', 'off', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'snuff', 'out', 'unsuspecting', 'cowboys.During', 'long', 'ride', 'destination', 'poignant', 'foreshadowing', 'when', 'Will', 'Ned', 'wild', 'days', 'remorseless', 'killer', 'vividly', 'ruthless', 'killing', 'innocent', 'drover', 'heavy', 'conscience', 'Nevertheless', 'Munny', 'deceased', 'wife', 'forever', 'ended', 'drunken', 'murdering', 'ways', 'Ned', 'reassuring', 'ai', ""n't"", 'more', '.With', 'intelligence', 'supplied', 'Skinny', 'Saloon', 'owner', 'Little', 'Bill', 'whores', 'are', 'offering', 'reward', 'two', 'ranch', 'hands', 'Acting', 'swiftly', 'team', 'deputies', 'nearly', 'beating', 'death', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'named', 'English', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'packing', 'When', 'Will', 'comrades', 'arrive', 'town', 'sheriff', 'also', 'savage', 'beating', 'too', 'sick', 'defend', 'spite', 'setback', 'trio', 'kill', 'Mike', 'friend', 'Davey', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'sequence', 'enough', 'inspire', 'Ned', 'forfeit', 'share', 'bounty', 'head', 'home', 'Unfortunately', 'Logan', 'captured', 'tortured', 'death', 'sadistic', 'Little', 'Bill.Eastwood', 'director', 'masterfully', 'how', 'unglamorous', 'killing', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'Schofield', 'shoots', 'Quick', 'Mike', 'using', 'outhouse', 'learn', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'kid', 'anxious', 'prove', 'bad', 'man', 'absolutely', 'stomach', 'taking', 'life', 'Chillingly', 'Will', 'who', 'few', 'swigs', 'whiskey', 'problem', 'transforming', 'back', 'precision', 'killing', 'machine', 'earlier', 'days', 'When', 'Little', 'Bill', 'taken', 'Ned', 'life', 'Munny', 'sheriff', 'deputies', 'saloon', 'owner', 'who', 'was', 'foolish', 'enough', 'display', 'Logan', 'body', 'front', 'establishment.This', 'film', 'masterwork', 'understanding', 'complexities', 'human', 'behavior', 'Though', 'Will', 'Munny', 'supposed', 'be', 'unforgiving', 'killer', 'protagonist', 'story', 'scene', 'acted', 'near', 'perfection', 'Eastwood', 'wisely', 'kid', 'hell', 'thing', 'killin', 'man', 'take', 'away', 'got', 'ever', 'gon', 'have', 'When', 'Schofield', 'justify', 'actions', 'Will', 'Well', 'guess', 'had', 'comin', 'Munny', 'succinctly', 'have', 'comin', 'kid', 'law', 'order', 'Little', 'Bill', 'clearly', 'antagonist', 'who', 'blindly', 'own', 'righteousness', 'When', 'gunned', 'down', 'Will', 'incredulously', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'die', 'Ultimately', 'Munny', 'who', 'clearest', 'sense', 'purpose', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'cool', 'fire', 'Little', 'Bill', 'last', 'lesson', 'deserve', 'got', 'nothing', 'do']",Unforgiven Snap Case

Mr. Eastwood plays William Munny who was one the most ruthless and cold-blooded killers of his day.  As the film opens, he is now just a lowly hog farmer who is widowed with two young children he can barely afford to feed and care for.  Along comes a young stranger known only as the Schofield Kid (played by Jaimz Woolvert) who propositions Munny to join him on a mission to avenge a prostitute who was beaten by some men.  Munny reluctantly agrees and the journey back into his former life is a revealing and sobering experience.  Along the way they join up with an old cohort of Munny's Ned Logan played by Morgan Freeman and a strange bounty hunter English Bob played by Richard Harris.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as a sadistic sheriff Little Bob with whom Munny has a final showdown that strikes at the heart of the film.  It reveals the impact that a violent life has on a person's conscience and soul.

The timing couldn't have been better in 1992 for a full scale engrossing western, and in the end Eastwood finally had his Oscars he had been dreaming about, even if he lost the nod for best actor. I am sure he wasn't too disappointed. Several actors here give possibly the best performances of their careers, and Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrait of the brutal town sheriff 'Little Bill Dagget'. This movie holds it's own along with classics like Dances with Wolves and The Wild Bunch. Maybe not as sweepingly epic as those films but just as good.",5,Undeniable classic western masterpiece!

I also appreciate his talent as a director; ""Mystic River"" is a masterpiece example of his skills in my opinion.  However, I have been puzzled by all of the accolades for ""The Unforgiven"".  For me it was actually a disappointment to watch after all of the advance praise I had heard.  It IS a good movie but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had seen the movie before any of it's reviews.The basic story is that of some prostitutes that want revenge on a man who disfigured one of their co-workers.  The town's tough sheriff (played excellently by Gene Hackman) isn't going to do anything about it so the girls offer a reward for someone who will.  A young wannabe gunfighter convinces Clint Eastwood's character to come along and cash in on the bounty.  Along the way they pick up Eastwood's old pal played by Morgan Freeman.  The movie basicly ambles on from there to the ending.There is a lot of good acting and the movie does its' best to dispel the myths of the Old West by the many characters and incidents involved.  I guess that was the purpose of the movie but in the process of doing so, it seemed to want to displace excitement with boredom.  As a result, it slowed down the movie quite a bit without offering much in drama to replace the action.  Some might say I'm missing the point but I think of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" as an example of an outstanding anti-war movie that still appealed to many for all the military action and drama that it offered.  Eastwood's character goes through the movie looking like he's overdosed on Valium.  His climatic finish seems only to have been accomplished by a change of depressants.I said that this is a good movie and I did find a lot to enjoy.  For me the best scenes were those involving Gene Hackman.  His was the strong presence that good Westerns are noted for.  Although he came across as the bad guy, his role made this movie as good as it got.I watched the Oscar ceremonies for 1992 and I cheered for Clint Eastwood to win the Best Actor award.  I was sorry that he didn't because it seemed like this might have been his last chance for the prize.  However, I knew that I was cheering for the actor and not for the role.

I wasted my money crappy movies often, just because of a star that I liked, or a premise that seemed interesting. As much as I hate to admit it, I did not like Westerns for the life of me. I saw Appaloosa when it came out in theatres, and ironically liked it, albeit only a little. I then saw 3:10 To Yuma, and what do you know, I loved it. Still do. Finally, there came a point where I had to ask myself what my problem was, why I refused to give other Westerns a chance. I eventually blind bought the DVD and decided to watch, not only one of the classic films collecting dust on my shelf, but one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Unforgiven is very well done. Certainly deserving of the recognition it has received over the years. I'm actually glad that this movie won Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is obviously well known for his portrayal of cowboys back when Westerns owned the air waves. I love how he came back in the early 90's to show them he hadn't lost his touch with a six shooter, or Schofield rifle, or shotgun, etc. He was perfect, and played the role exactly as I would expect. But his character went through a change that I was not expecting.The movie progresses along at a slow pace, and calmly inches its way toward the thrilling conclusion. Throughout the film we hear repeatedly how much of a badass Bill Munny was back in his heyday. There wasn't much to show for it. When we first meet him he's falling all over his pigs. Later on down the line he gets a fever from a small beating and is asleep for three days. I started to think to myself that this guy needed to take his old behind back home before he got too deep into trouble. He was not in any shape to try to kill anyone. Slowly, but surely we meet the man. I'll leave it at that because it's nearly impossible to say more without spoiling anything. I'll just say that Clint's performance is enough to sit through this one, even without the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well. He played Bill's longtime friend and partner in crime, Ned. When a young man suddenly shows up on Bill's ranch asking him to help kill a couple of bad men for a bounty, Ned's place is the first stop Bill makes. Together Bill and Ned accompany the young man on this hit. I might as well call it a hit, instead of sugar coating it. Bill and Ned are assassins, hitmen. So they aren't very good men themselves. The young man, called ""The Schofield Kid"", is played by Jaimz Woolvett (a relatively unknown...to me anyway). He does great too.The whole cast is really good. Gene Hackamn plays a real jerk of a town sheriff, named Little Bill, and Richard Harris has a short, but meaningful role as English Bob. I should also mention that the whores were well played as well. I feel bad calling them that, but that's what everyone else in the movie called them. I really liked this cast. Clint Eastwood is a hell of a director. The shots are really nice to look at. This isn't his most beautifully shot film, but this cinematography will impress nonetheless. If Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy is even a fraction as good as Unforgiven, I cannot wait. I can rest assured that that was a worthwhile purchase, even for a non-Western fan like myself. I really look forward to seeing many more films in this genre hence forth. If you're like I was, and doubt you'll be interested in movies like this one, stop it. Just give Unforgiven a chance and see for yourself.

I'm not sure what made me decide to view it, but I'm very glad I did.  Despite all the other ""revisionist"" Westerns that have come since the time Eastwood's masterpiece won Best Picture at the Oscars...none have managed to equal it.Recently, critics and audiences alike were saying that Eastwood's role in GRAN TORINO was the culmination of all his previous work and served as a commentary on it as well.  I was one of those people.  In TORINO, Eastwood's character achieves a kind of grace or redemption.  However, one could just as easily conclude that UNFORGIVEN was the final commentary on Eastwood's career, at least in Westerns, by Eastwood himself.  And let's put it this way...the film is well named.  Eastwood is suggesting that for those with killing in their blood, there is not redemption or grace.  Except, perhaps, the grace that comes with acknowledging who you are, no matter how terrible.In the tiny western town of Big Whiskey, there isn't much to do back in 1880.

Two cowboys from the big ranching organization that is the reason Big Whiskey exists at all come to visit the employees of the cat house, and when one of the ladies makes the mistake of giggling at one of the cowboys, he goes on a rampage and proceeds to cut up her face.  The hookers are outraged, and encouraged by their leader (Frances Fisher, in a remarkably fierce performance) scrape their savings together and let it be known to the world that have a reward for anyone who can kill these two cowboys and avenge this brutal act.One who heeds this call is ""The Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett), a young braggart with more swagger than experience.  His uncle was an old riding companion of William Munny (Eastwood), a ""retired"" killer...so The Kid looks up this legendary figure to see if he'll go with him on this manhunt.  Munny is a widower struggling to raise his two kids on a clearly failing pig farm.  His deceased wife had reformed Munny, turning him away from drinking and killing, and towards a calmer more ethical life.  However, Munny recognized that he could really use the money, and when The Kid exaggerates the extent of the harm caused to the prostitute...Eastwood uses this as a rationalization to leave his kids behind and join The Kid.  They also bring along Munny's old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman)...another killer who has made an effort to settle down and change his life.Back in Big Whisky, the sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) is obsessed with keeping his town lawful.  He has outlawed all guns, yet he metes out justice with the casual cruelness of a psychopath.  A well-read, seemingly friendly and reasonable psychopath, to be sure.UNFORGIVEN is over two hours long, and it allows the inevitable collision between Munny's gang and the sheriff's men to slowly brew.  We get to know Munny and Logan during their trek to Big Whiskey in scenes on horseback and around campfires that seem SO terribly clich&eacute;d...yet instead, they are full of dry humor, meaningful character development and beautiful scenery.  We get to know the terrifyingly bland ferocity of Little Bill as he spends a long, mesmerizing evening with English Bob (Richard Harris), an infamous gun-for-hire who has come to Big Whiskey to accept the prostitutes' challenge.  Bob has been accompanied by W.W. Beauchamp, a writer who is serving as Bob's sycophantic biographer.  Little Bill crushes the ego of one man (and his body too) and brings the other under his thrall.In the end, there is much killing and it is in these murders that UNFORGIVEN makes its mark.  To say that the film strips the standard western theme of revenge of all its glamour would be to deny the film much of the credit it is due.  One scene in particular (I'll try not to spoil it) shows a killing that is as senseless and sad as any you're likely to see.  The person killed dies a slow, sad death...and those around him are frankly appalled at the squalidness of what has happened, including the killers.As the film nears its conclusion, Munny observes: ""It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have.""  On paper, this statement sounds true but not particularly brilliant.  Trust me, in the film, it resonates and pierces the heart.  Never has one line in a film so perfectly captured its own theme.  In UNFORGIVEN, when people die, we feel the consequences.  Wives that will never see their husbands again.  Guilt that will never be washed clean.  Words that can never be forgotten, even with the help of booze.  Simple pleasures of living a life that will never be enjoyed.  Dignity that will be forever lost.  Stains that will never clean.The film holds such power, because Eastwood the Director holds total command of his tone.  He fully understands the standard development of a Western and seldom deviates far from it.  He shows that simply showing the events of a standard Western through the lens of what it REALLY would have been like strips away all the ""good vs. evil, white hats vs. black hats"" and leaves you in a murky world where all is shades of gray, and the ""good guys"" are just a breath away from being the ""bad guys.""  The film has a leisurely pace...it is not an action film.  The scenes of violence are quick and blunt.  But if you enjoy a film with a strong statement to make and a love of characterization...you'll appreciate UNFORGIVEN.  There are moments of wonderful humor, whether around Little Bill's efforts to build his own house or The Kid's efforts to be tough.  But for the most part, it is stark and bleak.  Never has being stuck in a rainstorm felt so miserable.  Yet the land is always beautiful, and it's easy to remember what would have drawn men to this part of the country...the promise that beauty held.Everyone is outstanding in the film.  Richard Harris, for his few minutes on screen, is riveting in the way he absolutely does NOT blend in with everyone around him.  Woolvert strikes the right tone of annoying yet somehow sympathetic.  Morgan Freeman gives one of his best supporting turns in perhaps the most sympathetic character of the film.  Eastwood and Freeman sure have an easy, believable chemistry on film (see MILLION DOLLAR BABY).  Gene Hackman certainly deserved his Oscar for this film...what a toweringly great actor he is...yet he never seems to be acting.  He's one of the slyest performers we have, an actor who inhabits his characters with seemingly no effort, yet the results, even in poor films make him stand out.  And Eastwood gives a performance that is every bit the equal of his work in GRAN TORINO.  Over the years, some of his work as an actor and director hasn't always been great.  He's got a comfort zone probably shouldn't stray from (yet, as I say that, I remember how remarkably credible he was in BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY)...but when he's in the zone, his work is not only mesmerizing, it is iconic.  He has a face that is perfect for the modern western, whether that western takes place in 1880 Big Whiskey or in current day suburbia.  Eastwood is an American classic, and UNFORGIVEN ranks among his crowning achievements.(I mentioned my HD DVD earlier...if you're watching this again someday, please try to treat yourself to the hi-def version if you can.  The scenery is absolutely spectacular.)",5,Eastwood's crowning achievement!,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,7468,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'nearly', 'decade', 'when', 'popped', 'HD', 'DVD',

91262,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0790729644,Robert Morris,"[6, 7]","By the time this film appeared (1992), Eastwood had already established himself as one of the most gifted directors. His talents behind the camera were first evident, and impressive, in Play Misty for Me (1971). Unforgiven received an Academy Award for best film, as did Eastwood for directing it. So many memorable characters which include Bill Munny (Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). What I find most interesting is Eastwood's willingness and ability to portray an old widow, far past his prime, who reluctantly agrees to accept an assignment to earn some much-needed money for himself and his family. Munny (obviously, no pun intended)  enlists the aid of his friend Logan. They are joined by the self-described ""Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett) and proceed to a town under the absolute control of Daggett who, unlike Brian Dennehy's character Cobb in Silverado, can be personally quite appealing but is nonetheless every bit as formidable. (I shall never forget Daggett's dying words, ""But I'm building a house!"") In my opinion, the plot really is not especially important. The film's greatest strengths are found within the meticulous development of various characters, a process under Eastwood's sure direction which is gradual and both subtle and substantial. Perhaps the character of journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is necessary to expedite the exposition but he seems to add little else. However, all others among the supporting cast are essential.Unforgiven can be categorized as a ""western"" but, in my opinion, it transcends that genre as it examines how the reality of an old man's vengeance is far more significant than the myth associated with his earlier adventures. Near the end of the film, ""Little Bill"" must deal with a Munny who is, not with someone who once was. The fact that Munny prevails reveals much about him...and perhaps about Eastwood and others who in later life, like Tennyson's Ulysses, ""strive to seek, to find...and not to yield.""",5,Dignity in Twilight,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,2059,"['time', 'film', 'appeared', '1992', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'directors', 'talents', 'camera', 'were', 'first', 'evident', 'impressive', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', '1971', 'Unforgiven', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'film', 'did', 'Eastwood', 'directing', 'So', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'include', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'Eastwood', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'English', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'What', 'find', 'most', 'interesting', 'Eastwood', 'willingness', 'ability', 'portray', 'old', 'widow', 'far', 'prime', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'accept', 'assignment', 'earn', 'much-needed', 'money', 'family', 'Munny', 'obviously', 'pun', 'intended', 'aid', 'friend', 'Logan', 'are', 'joined', 'self-described', 'Schofield', 'Kid', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'proceed', 'town', 'absolute', 'control', 'Daggett', 'who', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'character', 'Cobb', 'Silverado', 'can', 'be', 'personally', 'quite', 'appealing', 'nonetheless', 'bit', 'formidable', 'shall', 'never', 'forget', 'Daggett', 'dying', 'words', ""'m"", 'building', 'house', 'opinion', 'plot', 'really', 'not', 'especially', 'important', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'are', 'found', 'meticulous', 'development', 'various', 'characters', 'process', 'Eastwood', 'sure', 'direction', 'gradual', 'subtle', 'substantial', 'Perhaps', 'character', 'journalist', 'W.W.', 'Beauchamp', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'necessary', 'expedite', 'exposition', 'add', 'little', 'else', 'However', 'others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'essential.Unforgiven', 'can', 'be', 'categorized', 'western', 'opinion', 'genre', 'how', 'reality', 'old', 'man', 'vengeance', 'far', 'more', 'significant', 'myth', 'associated', 'earlier', 'adventures', 'end', 'film', 'Little', 'Bill', 'must', 'deal', 'Munny', 'who', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'fact', 'Munny', 'reveals', 'much', 'perhaps', 'Eastwood', 'others', 'who', 'later', 'life', 'Tennyson', 'Ulysses', 'strive', 'seek', 'find', 'not', 'yield']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91267,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,0790729644,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[0, 1]","""Unforgiven"" is a deconstruction of the classical Western.  There are no 'good guys', only different degrees of wrong.  The killings aren't idealized.  They are the filthy business that murder always is.  Eastwood's character, Muny, is a man with a troubled past.  He was a border raider in Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War although we never learn which side he was on.  All we know is that he was brutalized and committed atrocities.  His wife, however, tried to set him straight and he makes his life as a poor and simple farmer.Temptation comes to him in the form of bounty money offerred for the killing of men who cut and scarred a prostitue in Little Whiskey, Wyoming.  The prostitutes couldn't get the law to arrest the culprits so they have raised money and, in so doing, they have taken the law into their own hands.  Muny, at the urging of a very young, very inexperienced wannabe gunfighter, complies.  The result is a series of brutal killings with one culprit shot to death while sitting in an outhouse.The local sheriff, Little Bill, is, himself, a sadistic man and exacts retribution on Muny's little gang.  Muny, all veneer of civilization now completely stripped away, exacts bloody vengeance.  It's all so very satisfying which, I'm afraid, speaks volumes about our basic human nature.This is, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Clintwood, as director, shows that his attitudes about who we are may very well parallel those of Sam Peckinpah, as in 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' and 'The Wild Bunch.'Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,Border Wars come to Wyoming,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1629,"['Unforgiven', 'deconstruction', 'classical', 'Western', 'are', ""'good"", 'guys', 'only', 'different', 'degrees', 'wrong', 'killings', 'are', ""n't"", 'idealized', 'are', 'filthy', 'business', 'murder', 'always', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Muny', 'man', 'troubled', 'past', 'was', 'border', 'raider', 'Kansas', 'Missouri', 'Civil', 'War', 'never', 'learn', 'side', 'was', 'know', 'was', 'brutalized', 'committed', 'atrocities', 'wife', 'however', 'tried', 'set', 'straight', 'life', 'poor', 'simple', 'farmer.Temptation', 'form', 'bounty', 'money', 'offerred', 'killing', 'men', 'who', 'cut', 'scarred', 'prostitue', 'Little', 'Whiskey', 'Wyoming', 'prostitutes', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'law', 'arrest', 'culprits', 'have', 'raised', 'money', 'so', 'doing', 'have', 'taken', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Muny', 'urging', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'inexperienced', 'wannabe', 'gunfighter', 'complies', 'result', 'series', 'brutal', 'killings', 'one', 'culprit', 'shot', 'death', 'sitting', 'outhouse.The', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'sadistic', 'man', 'retribution', 'Muny', 'little', 'gang', 'Muny', 'veneer', 'civilization', 'now', 'completely', 'stripped', 'away', 'bloody', 'vengeance', 'so', 'very', 'satisfying', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'basic', 'human', 'nature.This', 'opinion', 'excellent', 'film', 'Clintwood', 'director', 'attitudes', 'who', 'are', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', ""'Pat"", 'Garret', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",Unforgiven Snap Case

He isn't after them long as he gets beaten and kicked by the towns people, mainly thier crooked sheriff, Little Bill (played suberbly by Gene Hackman).He isn't the typical bad guy, either, in fact he's almost good in comparison with other bad guys in other movies. All of this leads up to a spectacular climax with a showdown between Willam Munny and Little Bill.

Basically the lead, William Munny,is no different than the Man With No Name that Eastwood gave us in his hayday. We get to see life after gunfighting.Eastwood's Munny is an ex outlaw who goes out for one last run when a bounty is put on the head's of two cowboy's who one attacked a prostitute and cut her face. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan one ofMunny's partners who knew him befor Munny met his wife and changed his ways (In the beggining of the film we find out that Munny's wife has passed away).The bounty is placed by the working girls of Big Whiskey a small town run by a ruthless and very nasty sheriff named Little Bill played by Gene Hackman (Hackman would win an Oscar for the role). We see just how nasty Little Bill can be when English Bob (Richard Harris) wounders into town looking to collect the bounty.Eastwood showed real courage by not being afraid to show his charactor as both older and flawed.One of the best thing's about this film is that you get to see the human side of all the people involved.

So, I would say following notion is my version of amalgamation of all religious thoughts.With this remarkable film, Clint Eastwood made me think deeply about people (including myself) who have sins and are self-conscious of it, and about their lives they carry on with a burden named &quot;guilt&quot;.If you have a sin that is unforgiven, and when you are conscious of it, your life becomes a hell.You feel stained forever. That awareness suffers you.But, you have to know that you are lucky to be conscious of your sins. That means, you have a chance to save your soul, to wash the stain out by yourself. At least, you can try it. That is all our lives about, I think.William Munny, once a cold-blooded murderer, becomes conscious of his stains on his soul when he married to his late wife and she gave Munny a chance to gain a humble decency as a human.Having lost his caring wife, Munny leads difficult life with two children and poverty. But bearing this struggle is a duty to Munny to expiate his sin, or just to show his late wife he is not giving up his acquired decency.Munny's last job as a gunman, for the sake of his children, is to take revenge for a prostitute who was assaulted by two men but rejected to bring them to justice. Here, we see a typical example of injustice by the justice side in reality.Who judges who? Who can forgive someone else's sin? Nobody. Still, I would like to forgive Munny if I were in the position to make the decision. I believe Munny's wife would have felt the same.Even if the sins commited by humans never be forgiven by humans, they are always given a chance to expiate it.Humans always make mistakes. Sometimes commit sins. As a sinner myself, I cannot say that they all should be forgiven, but I believe that carrying a burden of guilty on up the steep hill towards a brighter place, however dim it seems first, is what every person with sin should do to save their souls by themselves.I say this again, but it is our lives meant that we keep moving upwards to make ourselves better. To make our world better place. However it seems hard.The good news is, the stain doesn't last forever. Because souls are the light itself.

Its not a typical Eastwood western as its take on violence and the results of violence is markedly different from the many previous westerns that Eastwood has been involved in.Early in the film you quickly realise that this is something completly different. Eastwood's character William Munny can't even get on a horse. This scene is the first of many with a running black comedy element. Even without that element the film has other differences, such as the fact that a lot of the characters are very simple folk and as a result use simple language.In 1992 this film was nominated for 9 oscars and won 4 of them. Gene Hackman who plays Little Bill Daggett (the town Sheriff) deservedly won the best supporting actor role for his performance. Like most films he appeared in in the late 1980's (Mississipi Burning being perhaps his best of the late 80's) Hackman's performance is memerisingly good and as I mentioned earlier in places there are some lovely black comedy moments.With Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, as well as Eastwood himself, all giving excellent performances this is a film thats worth seeing over and over.

Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it. It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven. Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):Someone said, ""Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt."" And I responded,  ""Those weren't movies."" And someone else said, ""Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'"" And I said, ""Okay. That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre."" And the next guy said, ""Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?"" And I said, ""Excellent point. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.""I could ramble on and debate this all day.You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as ""the best""; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars. That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven. He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating. But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system. So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.Unforgiven is definitely one of them.",5,The Academy Got This One Right,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,2058,"['Unforgiven', 'so', 'good', 'impression', 'just', 'might', 'stay', 'forever', 'backbone', 'real', '5-star', 'movie', 'Unforgiven', 'one', 'movies', 'really', '5', 'stars', 'thousands', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', '1992', 'rightfully', 'got', 'it.In', 'recent', 'review', 'year', '2006', 'horror', 'slugfest', 'Slither', 'asked', 'what', 'ranking', 'who', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'would', 'then', 'give', 'real', '5-star', 'movie', 'Unforgiven', 'Here', 'email', 'feedback', 'got', 'colorful', 'times', 'Someone', 'said', 'Well', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'Justice', 'League', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'responded', 'were', ""n't"", 'movies', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'Well', 'Slither', 'was', '5', 'stars', 'genre', 'said', 'Okay', 'fair', 'guess', 'as', 'long', 'reader', 'system', 'broken', 'out', 'genre', 'next', 'guy', 'said', 'Who', 'are', 'say', 'what', '5', 'stars', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'Excellent', 'point', 'Everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinion', 'could', 'ramble', 'debate', 'day.You', 'see', 'therefore', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Unforgiven', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'make', 'question', 'own', 'judgment', 'what', 'classify', 'best', 'Monday-morning-quarterback', 'decision', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'simply', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'weekend', 'next', 'one', 'came', 'really', 'deserved', '5', 'stars.Somewhere', 'there', 'back', '1992', 'reviewer', 'system', 'was', 'foiled', 'topped', 'out', '4', 'stars', 'finally', 'gave', 'added', 'fifth', 'star', 'system', 'Unforgiven', 'upgraded', 'few', 'pre-1992', 'movie', 'Goodfellas', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'new', '5-star', 'rating', 'silly', 'reviewer', 'probably', 'up', '10', 'stars', 'now', 'system', 'vicious', 'cycle', 'surely', 'want', 'avoid.So', 'suggest', 'fair', 'reviewers', 'Lest', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'liberal', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'needing', 'add', 'more', 'stars', 'point', 'system', 'order', 'do', 'justice', 'movies', 'should', 'stand', 'alone', 'top.Unforgiven', 'definitely', 'one']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The plot and meaning have already been gone over before by many reviewers here so I will only discuss the quality of the Blu Ray transfer itself.I do have the film on a Standard Def DVD so, while this is not a side by side comparison, I do have the SD version to refer to.The video transfer is not really bad.  There were no artifacts or mis colorization's, no aliasing or ghosting at all.  The warm color grading is hampered a touch by crushed blacks which take away some of the details in the video.  That said, I really didn't think there was much, if any, difference between the SD and this BR version.  The SD DVD was pretty decent to start off with so my guess is that Warner Brothers, in their continuing lazy way, simply reformatted the SD to the BluRay format without any remastering at all.The audio is the bigger shame of the two.  Rather than a lossless audio like DTS HD 5.1 or PCM 5.1, Warner Brothers kept the same audio as the SD DVD which was DD 5.1 , a lossy audio.  While it is fairly clear and the audio levels are nicely balanced,  once one gets used to the lesser compression that lossless audio provides, when you hear the lossy compressed version, it does sound muffled in comparison.  The sub channel is not used in this film despite the thunderstorms because of this compression and the only time the rear channels are used discreetly is for the falling of the rain.The price is right if you don't already have any version of this fine film, but if all you have is the Standard Def version, you will probably not notice much of a difference by going to this disappointing Blu Ray.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",2,'Unforgiven' on Blu Ray,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2075,"['5', 'stars', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'lousy', 'job', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'did', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'movie', 'plot', 'meaning', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'gone', 'before', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'so', 'will', 'only', 'discuss', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'itself.I', 'do', 'have', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'so', 'not', 'side', 'side', 'comparison', 'do', 'have', 'SD', 'version', 'refer', 'to.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'were', 'artifacts', 'mis', 'colorization', 'aliasing', 'ghosting', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'hampered', 'touch', 'crushed', 'blacks', 'take', 'away', 'details', 'video', 'said', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'difference', 'SD', 'BR', 'version', 'SD', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'start', 'off', 'so', 'guess', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'continuing', 'lazy', 'way', 'simply', 'reformatted', 'SD', 'BluRay', 'format', 'remastering', 'all.The', 'audio', 'bigger', 'shame', 'two', 'Rather', 'lossless', 'audio', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'PCM', '5.1', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'kept', 'same', 'audio', 'SD', 'DVD', 'was', 'DD', '5.1', 'lossy', 'audio', 'fairly', 'clear', 'audio', 'levels', 'are', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'once', 'one', 'used', 'lesser', 'compression', 'lossless', 'audio', 'when', 'hear', 'lossy', 'compressed', 'version', 'sound', 'muffled', 'comparison', 'sub', 'channel', 'not', 'used', 'film', 'thunderstorms', 'compression', 'only', 'time', 'rear', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'discreetly', 'falling', 'rain.The', 'price', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'version', 'fine', 'film', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'going', 'disappointing', 'Blu', 'Ray.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91293,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,0790729644,Steven Hancock,"[0, 0]","""Unforgiven"" is one of the many entries into THE American film genre. According to Clint Eastwood, the film's star and director, it ""summarizes everything I feel about the western."" And it is a fine western film, filled with fascinating characters, exciting gunfights, and beautiful choreography. The story itself is fascinating, though it is a bit slow and uneven in some places.Clint Eastwood gives what is arguably his best performance as Bill Munny, a former gunslinger and cold-blooded killer, who's changed his ways, but agrees to collect one more bounty in order to support his two children. We see how violence can corrupt a human being, and how past demons can truly eat at him, and Eastwood plays this perfectly. Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorites, gives another terrific performance as Ned Logan, Munny's old partner. Gene Hackman is brutal, but also scarily likable, as the villainous Little Bill Daggett, the corrupt sheriff of the town. It isn't hard to see why he won an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances as well, and help to keep the story both interesting and involving.Overall, ""Unforgiven"" is a fine, if slow and uneven, entry into the genre with great performances and well-done gunfights. Fans of western and drama alike will find much to enjoy in this modern-day western.Movie/DVD Grade: B+",4,A FINE WESTERN DRAMA FROM CLINT EASTWOOD.,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1363,"['Unforgiven', 'one', 'many', 'entries', 'THE', 'American', 'film', 'genre', 'According', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'star', 'director', 'everything', 'feel', 'western', 'fine', 'western', 'film', 'filled', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'exciting', 'gunfights', 'beautiful', 'choreography', 'story', 'fascinating', 'bit', 'slow', 'uneven', 'places.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'what', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'former', 'gunslinger', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'who', 'changed', 'ways', 'collect', 'one', 'more', 'bounty', 'order', 'support', 'two', 'children', 'see', 'how', 'violence', 'can', 'corrupt', 'human', 'being', 'how', 'past', 'demons', 'can', 'truly', 'eat', 'Eastwood', 'perfectly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Munny', 'old', 'partner', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'brutal', 'also', 'scarily', 'likable', 'villainous', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'corrupt', 'sheriff', 'town', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'keep', 'story', 'interesting', 'involving.Overall', 'Unforgiven', 'fine', 'slow', 'uneven', 'entry', 'genre', 'great', 'performances', 'well-done', 'gunfights', 'Fans', 'western', 'drama', 'alike', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'modern-day', 'western.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'B+']",Unforgiven Snap Case

The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi. It's a world in which nobody wins, ""we've all got it coming"", and no one is forgiven.",5,Brilliant anti-Western,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,1004,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Oscar-winning', 'Western', 'genre', 'entirely', 'head', 'west', 'bleak', 'moral', 'vacuum', 'place', 'anxious', 'sized-obsessed', 'men', 'violently', 'determined', 'women', 'where', 'creed', 'cowboy', 'way', 'creed', 'gangster', 'Villains', 'are', ""n't"", 'challenged', 'duels', 'skill', 'slaughtered', 'try', 'surrender', 'Virtually', 'man', 'unarmed', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'purely', 'visceral', 'level', 'subplot', 'English', 'Bob', 'travelling', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Webb', 'Peoples', 'clearly', 'more', 'mind', 'screenplay', 'Western', 'myth-making', 'genre', 'mythic', 'conception', 'American', 'west', 'fabrication', 'woven', 'exaggerated', 'stories', 'braggarts', 'liars', 'tale', 'Will', 'Munny', 'probably', 'was', 'chilling', 'world', 'more', 'common', 'classical', 'tragedy', 'moral', 'speculation', 'sci-fi', 'world', 'nobody', ""'ve"", 'got', 'coming', 'one', 'forgiven']",Unforgiven Snap Case

This time around, the abundance of glitz and style has been replaced by a healthy dose of angst and brooding.A prostitute is brutally attacked in the town of Big Whisky, Wyoming.  Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) secures restitution for her injuries but Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher), the mother-figure for the town's prostitutes, feels that justice has not been served.  She therefore puts together a pool of money and places a bounty on the pair of attackers.  Retired killer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) answers the call and his vengeance is soon unleashed upon Big Whisky after he comes into conflict with Sheriff Daggett.""Unforgiven"" certainly showcases some excellent performances.  Eastwood, Hackman, Fisher, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris are all wonderful.  Unfortunately, the film's gloomy and downbeat tone is too suffocating for its own good as its atmosphere literally buries its story.

91306,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,0790729644,Theo Logos,"[2, 5]","`Unforgiven' is an absolute masterpiece of film, and represents not only director and star Clint Eastwood's most mature work, but also the coming of age of the Western. It completely eliminates the simplex white hat/black hat, good guy/bad guy theme so common to Westerns. In its place, it gives us rich, fully drawn characters painted in the muddled shades of gray that characterize real life rather than the black and white of myth. And while it has abundant violence, it strips it of all of its glamour, and presents it as the stark horror that it is.The film deals extensively with the disconnect between what we are, and how we view ourselves. William Munny (Clint Eastwood), a bad man reformed by the love of his now deceased wife, is haunted by his past of cold blooded killing. Even as he takes on a final job of assassination to save his failing farm, he continually tells himself and everyone around him, ""I ain't like that anymore."" His  companion, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), is young, dumb, and owns a gun, and is blustering and cocky about what a deadly killer he is until confronted with the actual deed. English Bob (Richard Harris) fancies himself a sophisticated, refined, gentleman shootist, but is soon revealed to be little more than a mannered bully and crude killer. Little Bill (Gene Hackman), sheriff of Big Whisky, believes himself to be a tough but fair enforcer of justice, and believes that he is different - more righteous, than the toughs that he confronts. Yet Little Bill harbors a deeply sadistic rage that can be deadly, and just as ugly as any outlaw's deeds. Finally, the working girls that contract to kill the offending cowboys see themselves only as seeking justice, and are blind to the fact that what they really want is not justice, but vengeance.`Unforgiven' reinvents how violence and killing are presented in Westerns. In the traditional Western, the villains are demonized to the extent that when they are killed by the heroes, we feel exhilaration and triumph, devoid of any of the inherent horror of the act. Not so in `Unforgiven', where each killing is felt like punch to the gut. When each character is shown in all their humanity rather than as a gross caricature, it is impossible for us to cheer their deaths. Eastwood's William Munny sums up the heart of the film when he says to the Schofield Kid, ""When you kill a man, you rob him of everything that he has, and everything he's ever gonna have."" In a final shoot out scene, Munny ties together the themes of the gruesome nature of killing and our self deceit about our natures, when a man he is about to kill says to him, ""I don't deserve this"", and he replies, ""We all deserve it,"" as he dispatches him.`Unforgiven' stands as a landmark in the history of Western movies. Like John Ford's great film, `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', it explodes the myths and easy conventions of the genre, and presents us with complex moral questions rather than simple, pre-digested answers. It is well written, with brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography - a masterpiece of its genre.

91307,A1BN9LZB9575P3,0790729644,Thomas Kearney,"[2, 3]","Unforgiven is surely Clint Eastwood's greatest achievement.  For Clint fans like myself, it has plenty of great lines to recite.  It is a morally troubling film in that the only character who really deserves to die is  Clint's character, William Munny.  The most compelling character is the  excellent Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget, the town sherrif, who while  he has a bit of a mean sadistic streak in him, is basically trying to keep  the peace in his town and will go to any lengths to keep things orderly.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is when he humiliates English Bob,  aka The Duck of Death, played by Richard Harris.  Jaimz Woolvet puts in a  good performance as the Schofield Kid, whose boasting masks his lack of  gunfighting experience.  Morgan Freeman is good as Ned, Munny's old  sidekick who tags along with Munny and Schofield but is tormented by his  inner doubts about what he is doing.

Clint Eastwood stars as former outlaw Will Munny. Munny has changed his ways after meeting a woman who literally helped him turn his life around. Now she's gone and he's a struggling farmer with two small children desperate for money to fuel his last chance at staying honest and straight.Munny decides along with his former partner (a marvelously understated Morgan Freeman)and a young kid to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute for a $1000.00 bounty. The only thing standing between him and the money is Little Bill (Gene Hackman who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting actor)a brutal Sheriff. Munny doesn't know it but he's caught an express train to hell as the cold blooded killer he was comes to the fore again.Unforgiven is as much about the inability to escape our past as it is about the violence and bloodshed that was later glossed over in the westerns of the 30's and 40's. Munny realizes that killing is a nasty business for both the killer and his victim. Despite his years of hard work and the saving grace of his wife, Munny could easily tip over into the abyss of alcholism and cruelty that dominated his youth. It's a marvelous portrayal and Eastwood, arguably, deserved the Best Acting Oscar as much as the directing and Best Picture Oscars.This new 10th Anniversary edition has been digitally remastered and looks beautiful. The opening sequence is a good example of the care taken in the transfer. The smoke from Munny's house during sunset snakes gently against the bright orange sky. Eastwood and his collaborators (writer David Webb Peoples who also wrote Blade Runner and the underrated film science fiction adventure Solider with Kurt Russell)have fashioned a morality play as much about the present as it is about the past.The cast is filled with Eastwood regulars but two particular performances shine aside from Eastwood and Freeman--Gene Hackman as the sadistic and brutal Little Bill and the late Richard Harris in a glorified cameo as gunfighting legend English Bob. Harris plays Bob as a dandy with a pistol until Bob encounters Little Bill. We then discover how much of his legend is myth designed to gloss over a nasty reputation and dishonorable actions.The extras included are very good as well. There's a documentary called Eastwood on Eastwood which ran on one of the cable channels.  As a performer we get glimpses of Eastwood in early supporting roles (from his first movie the horrible horror film Revenge of the Creature with John Agar)to the television role that gave him enough fame to jump to Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in Rawhide. The clips provide a good summation of Eastwood's performing style over the years. It's also a canny if slightly self serving assessment on Eastwood's themes as a director and smart observations about the true quality of his uneven body of work as a director.There's also an episode of Maverick featuring James Garner where Eastwood plays a character that could have been Munny when he was younger. He plays a cocky young gunfighter with an attitude (although Munny was much nastier based on comments from the characters in the film. Consider his portrayal a G rated version of Munny). It's a beautiful transfer of a classic black and white episode from television's Golden Age. When will Maverick and some of these classic westerns finally make the jump to DVD?There's also a feature commentary by Time film critic Richard Schickel (although I would have much preferred Eastwood). A new featurette about the making of the film as well as the original featurette on the making of the film.If you're not interested in the extras and the nearly pristine transfer doesn't appeal to you, the single disc earlier edition of Unforgiven looks very good as well athough nowhere near as sharp as this one. It's about half the cost and might be a good place to start if you haven't seen the film and are unsure about purchasing it.",5,One of Eastwood's best films as director and star,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,3977,"['Redemption', 'can', 'only', 'succeed', 'past', ""n't"", 'haunt', 'redeemed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'stars', 'former', 'outlaw', 'Will', 'Munny', 'Munny', 'changed', 'ways', 'meeting', 'woman', 'who', 'literally', 'helped', 'turn', 'life', 'Now', 'gone', 'struggling', 'farmer', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'desperate', 'money', 'fuel', 'last', 'chance', 'staying', 'honest', 'straight.Munny', 'decides', 'former', 'partner', 'marvelously', 'understated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'young', 'kid', 'kill', 'two', 'cowboys', 'cut', 'up', 'prostitute', '1000.00', 'bounty', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'money', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'actor', 'brutal', 'Sheriff', 'Munny', ""n't"", 'know', 'caught', 'express', 'train', 'hell', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'was', 'fore', 'again.Unforgiven', 'as', 'much', 'inability', 'escape', 'past', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'was', 'later', 'glossed', 'over', 'westerns', '30', '40', 'Munny', 'killing', 'nasty', 'business', 'killer', 'victim', 'years', 'hard', 'work', 'saving', 'grace', 'wife', 'Munny', 'could', 'easily', 'tip', 'over', 'abyss', 'alcholism', 'cruelty', 'dominated', 'youth', 'marvelous', 'portrayal', 'Eastwood', 'arguably', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Acting', 'Oscar', 'as', 'much', 'directing', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars.This', 'new', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'sequence', 'good', 'example', 'care', 'taken', 'transfer', 'smoke', 'Munny', 'house', 'sunset', 'snakes', 'gently', 'bright', 'orange', 'sky', 'Eastwood', 'collaborators', 'writer', 'David', 'Webb', 'Peoples', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'underrated', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'Solider', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'have', 'fashioned', 'morality', 'play', 'much', 'present', 'past.The', 'cast', 'filled', 'Eastwood', 'regulars', 'two', 'particular', 'performances', 'shine', 'aside', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'sadistic', 'brutal', 'Little', 'Bill', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'glorified', 'cameo', 'gunfighting', 'legend', 'English', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bob', 'dandy', 'pistol', 'Bob', 'Little', 'Bill', 'then', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'legend', 'myth', 'designed', 'gloss', 'over', 'nasty', 'reputation', 'dishonorable', 'actions.The', 'extras', 'included', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'documentary', 'called', 'Eastwood', 'Eastwood', 'ran', 'one', 'cable', 'channels', 'performer', 'get', 'glimpses', 'Eastwood', 'early', 'supporting', 'roles', 'first', 'movie', 'horrible', 'horror', 'film', 'Revenge', 'Creature', 'John', 'Agar', 'television', 'role', 'gave', 'enough', 'fame', 'jump', 'Leone', 'A', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'Rawhide', 'clips', 'provide', 'good', 'summation', 'Eastwood', 'performing', 'style', 'years', 'also', 'canny', 'slightly', 'serving', 'assessment', 'Eastwood', 'themes', 'director', 'smart', 'observations', 'true', 'quality', 'uneven', 'body', 'work', 'director.There', 'also', 'episode', 'Maverick', 'featuring', 'James', 'Garner', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Munny', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'cocky', 'young', 'gunfighter', 'attitude', 'Munny', 'was', 'much', 'nastier', 'based', 'comments', 'characters', 'film', 'Consider', 'portrayal', 'G', 'rated', 'version', 'Munny', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'classic', 'black', 'white', 'episode', 'television', 'Golden', 'Age', 'When', 'will', 'Maverick', 'classic', 'westerns', 'finally', 'make', 'jump', 'DVD', 'also', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Time', 'film', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'Eastwood', 'new', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'featurette', 'making', 'film.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'interested', 'extras', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'single', 'disc', 'earlier', 'edition', 'Unforgiven', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'nowhere', 'as', 'sharp', 'one', 'cost', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'unsure', 'purchasing']",Unforgiven Snap Case

91324,A1DZSBTVCJ883,0790729644,W. Walker,"[2, 4]","Not a fun western. Much brutishness and grimness. No wisecracking colorful sidekick to provide comic relief. No promising union of hero and maiden at the end. No pat on the back for riding the community of desperados or crooked big wheels. No indian conflicts, dramatic train or bank robberies, nor exciting gold strikes. No wagon train hoedowns nor other pleasant social events. No Mr. nice guy whose tough when he has to be. The women are all mindless abused plain-looking whores, not glamorous dance hall queens, and are ultimately responsible for all the violence in the film. This is a message film. The main point seems to be to present a more realistic picture of life and violence in the wild west than the typical western and to deglamorize shootouts and gunslingers. Another message is  that alcohol(and by extension, some other psychoactive drugs) makes certain men violent or abusive. Eastwood's character was such a man.The plot surrounds conflicting ideas of the just punishment for the face slashing of a prostitute by a cowboy customer whose manhood she insulted. The saloon owner nearly decides to shoot the cowboy, but then decides to defer to the authority of the sheriff, ""Little"" Bill. Bill  initially suggests a whipping as being appropriate for the cowboy and his friend, who helped hold down the prostitute. But this doesn't satisfy the Madam, who demands a public hanging. The saloon keeper now demands a fine, payable to him, for damage to his ""property"". Bill finally decides on a fine alone. The prostitutes are incredulous at this sentence. To them this says the legal system regards them as mere property, equivalent to slaves or horses. Most viewers would probably regard a death sentence as too harsh, but a fine as too light. Perhaps Little Bill's original suggestion of a whipping would have satisfied the prostitutes after they witnessed it and there would not have been any more violence connected with the incident. This ""mistake"" left the prostitutes as well as most of the other town's people unsatisfied, and would ultimately cost Bill his life. The prostitutes offered a bounty for the heads of the 2 cowboys so as to achieve their idea of justice, and this initiates the rest of the action of this film. In a broader application, the complications surrounding this incident serves as a warning that even domestic insults and assaults can sometimes result in a cascade of revenge and legalistic injuries, jailings and murders, sometimes involving people quite unrelated to the original incident.This film showcases the injustices and ambiguities of vigilante justice and its perpetrators. The reformed ex-gunslinger drunk(Eastwood), who initially took up his weapons again only to make some money to help support his children and to satisfy the revenge wishes of others, eventually tranforms himself temporarily into a drunk vigilante who murdered those not involved as well as those involved in the death of his long time partner. This is but one of several incidents of unjust killings(including at least one of the cowboys involved in the slashing).However, we have to balance this against the frequent shortcomings of legalistic justice, including the expenses involved, frequent mistakes, the influence of money, status, race and corruption, the frequent inability to identify, capture or convict perpetrators, the endless appeals and frequent dissatisfaction with sentences as too lenient or too harsh and being carried out far too long after the crime is comitted. Both have their pluses and minuses. The popularity of films where the hero eliminates the villain in a vigilante fashion suggests that vigilante justice, when done appropriately, is acceptable to many people and often preferable to legalized justice. However, the legal establishment is reluctant to legitimize it, except perhaps in self-defense cases, which are often subject to interpretation. It recognizes the gave dangers of too frequent use of vigilante justice, besides the fact that this seriously undermines its authority.",3,grim reality without humor.,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,4044,"['Not', 'fun', 'western', 'Much', 'brutishness', 'grimness', 'No', 'wisecracking', 'colorful', 'sidekick', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'No', 'promising', 'union', 'hero', 'maiden', 'end', 'pat', 'back', 'riding', 'community', 'desperados', 'crooked', 'big', 'wheels', 'indian', 'conflicts', 'dramatic', 'train', 'bank', 'robberies', 'exciting', 'gold', 'strikes', 'wagon', 'train', 'hoedowns', 'other', 'pleasant', 'social', 'events', 'Mr.', 'nice', 'guy', 'tough', 'when', 'be', 'women', 'are', 'mindless', 'abused', 'plain-looking', 'whores', 'not', 'glamorous', 'dance', 'hall', 'queens', 'are', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'violence', 'film', 'message', 'film', 'main', 'point', 'be', 'present', 'more', 'realistic', 'picture', 'life', 'violence', 'wild', 'west', 'typical', 'western', 'deglamorize', 'shootouts', 'gunslingers', 'message', 'alcohol', 'extension', 'other', 'psychoactive', 'drugs', 'certain', 'men', 'violent', 'abusive', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'was', 'such', 'man.The', 'plot', 'conflicting', 'ideas', 'just', 'punishment', 'face', 'slashing', 'prostitute', 'cowboy', 'customer', 'manhood', 'insulted', 'saloon', 'owner', 'nearly', 'shoot', 'cowboy', 'then', 'defer', 'authority', 'sheriff', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Bill', 'initially', 'whipping', 'being', 'appropriate', 'cowboy', 'friend', 'who', 'helped', 'hold', 'down', 'prostitute', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'Madam', 'who', 'public', 'hanging', 'saloon', 'keeper', 'now', 'fine', 'payable', 'damage', 'property', 'Bill', 'finally', 'fine', 'alone', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'incredulous', 'sentence', 'legal', 'system', 'regards', 'mere', 'property', 'equivalent', 'slaves', 'horses', 'Most', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'regard', 'death', 'sentence', 'too', 'harsh', 'fine', 'too', 'light', 'Perhaps', 'Little', 'Bill', 'original', 'suggestion', 'whipping', 'would', 'have', 'satisfied', 'prostitutes', 'witnessed', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'violence', 'connected', 'incident', 'mistake', 'left', 'prostitutes', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'other', 'town', 'people', 'unsatisfied', 'would', 'ultimately', 'cost', 'Bill', 'life', 'prostitutes', 'offered', 'bounty', 'heads', '2', 'cowboys', 'so', 'achieve', 'idea', 'justice', 'rest', 'action', 'film', 'broader', 'application', 'complications', 'surrounding', 'incident', 'warning', 'even', 'domestic', 'insults', 'assaults', 'can', 'sometimes', 'result', 'cascade', 'revenge', 'legalistic', 'injuries', 'jailings', 'murders', 'sometimes', 'involving', 'people', 'quite', 'unrelated', 'original', 'incident.This', 'film', 'injustices', 'ambiguities', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'perpetrators', 'reformed', 'ex-gunslinger', 'drunk', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'initially', 'took', 'up', 'weapons', 'again', 'only', 'make', 'money', 'help', 'support', 'children', 'satisfy', 'revenge', 'wishes', 'others', 'eventually', 'temporarily', 'drunk', 'vigilante', 'who', 'murdered', 'not', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'involved', 'death', 'long', 'time', 'partner', 'one', 'several', 'incidents', 'unjust', 'killings', 'including', 'least', 'one', 'cowboys', 'involved', 'slashing', '.However', 'have', 'balance', 'frequent', 'shortcomings', 'legalistic', 'justice', 'including', 'expenses', 'involved', 'frequent', 'mistakes', 'influence', 'money', 'status', 'race', 'corruption', 'frequent', 'inability', 'identify', 'capture', 'convict', 'perpetrators', 'endless', 'appeals', 'frequent', 'dissatisfaction', 'sentences', 'too', 'lenient', 'too', 'harsh', 'being', 'carried', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'crime', 'comitted', 'have', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'popularity', 'films', 'where', 'hero', 'villain', 'vigilante', 'fashion', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'when', 'done', 'appropriately', 'acceptable', 'many', 'people', 'often', 'preferable', 'legalized', 'justice', 'However', 'legal', 'establishment', 'reluctant', 'legitimize', 'perhaps', 'self-defense', 'cases', 'are', 'often', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'gave', 'dangers', 'too', 'frequent', 'use', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'fact', 'seriously', 'authority']",Unforgiven Snap Case
91325,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,0790729644,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[1, 2]","Clint Eastwood takes his place beside Western film-making legends John Ford (""The Searchers"") and Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch"") with this classic. Eastwood, in effect, questions the genre that made him the way John Wayne and John Ford did in ""The Searchers"" (through gritty realism). A big question you're left with at the end is ""Do these people(Europeans/Americans) really represent civilization or is there a bit more to the story?""Great cast but even greater approach in the storytelling. ""Unforgiven"" is unrelenting realism and that is messy. Witness -- clumsy and near-sighted cowboys, outhouse assassinations, moral ambiguity, guilt by association resulting in a man's death, killing prompts remorse (and sometimes not). Essentially, very weighty matters translated to the spaghetti Western (thus showing Old West more like it was than most such films dare depict to their jingoistic audiences).Eastwood parodies his ""Pale Rider"" character and the mythic man on the white horse through playing a domesticated gunslinger who can't properly mount his horse or stay on it that well. Gene Hackman plays the cruel yet personable and smiling sheriff who happens to be a lousy carpenter. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris add to the exotic mix. Harris's British bounty hunter makes light of presidential assassinations, another example of the dark humor that pervades ""Unforgiven."" This film is not for laughs. ""Blazin' Saddles"" it ain't.Eastwood's character delivers one of American cinema's most memorable lines about living and killing.

91327,AP3B615GM191G,0790729644,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","From the very first scene of &#34;Unforgiven&#34;, you get the feeling that this is going to be an epic western tale.  Two hours and ten minutes later, nothing will dissuade you from that opinion.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees retired gunslinger and rabble-rouser Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) now raising hogs and struggling to make a living with his two children.  When a cocky youngster nicknamed &#34;The Schofield Kid&#34; (Jaimz Woolvett) shows up one day with a killing-for-money offer that Munny cannot refuse, Munny and old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) ride out once again.  What they don't count on, though, is the toughness of Big Whiskey lawman Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman).The reason that &#34;Unforgiven&#34; is such a classic movie is because every character could be worthy of &#34;leading man&#34; status in terms of both casting and on-screen character development.  For example (some spoilers)...-Eastwood gives as good a performance as any western in his career (and that is saying something!).  Coming into the final moments of the movie, you really just don't know how he is going to react to the film's climax.-Freeman plays a great sidekick with an angle (sharp-shooter, yet freezes up the first time he is needed) that again keeps you interested in just who the man is/was.-The young Woolvett provides some energy as the &#34;Schofield Kid&#34;.  A scene after which he kills his first man is one of the best of the whole effort.-Hackman nearly steals the whole show as Little Bill.  He is as tough as they come and somewhat set up to be the &#34;bad guy&#34;, but (as in most great movies) that case is not so clear.  Maybe Little Bill is just trying to keep his town &#34;clean&#34; the only way he knows how?Overall, then, I can completely understand why &#34;Unforgiven&#34; has been awarded so many distinctions.  Also directed by Eastwood, the film is perfectly paced and provides simmering drama that continues to increase with every scene.  This will likely be the last western film that Eastwood ever acts in, and one couldn't ask to go out on a higher note.",5,Grabs You From The Get-Go And Never Lets Up,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2113,"['very', 'first', 'scene', '34', 'Unforgiven', '34', 'get', 'feeling', 'going', 'be', 'epic', 'western', 'tale', 'Two', 'hours', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'nothing', 'will', 'dissuade', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'retired', 'gunslinger', 'rabble-rouser', 'Bill', 'Munny', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'now', 'raising', 'hogs', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'two', 'children', 'When', 'cocky', 'youngster', 'nicknamed', '34', 'Schofield', 'Kid', '34', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'killing-for-money', 'offer', 'Munny', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'Munny', 'old', 'partner', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ride', 'out', 'once', 'again', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'toughness', 'Big', 'Whiskey', 'lawman', 'Little', 'Bill', 'Daggett', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '.The', 'reason', '34', 'Unforgiven', '34', 'classic', 'movie', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'worthy', '34', 'leading', 'man', '34', 'status', 'terms', 'casting', 'on-screen', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'spoilers', '-Eastwood', 'as', 'good', 'performance', 'western', 'career', 'saying', 'something', 'Coming', 'final', 'moments', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'going', 'react', 'film', 'climax.-Freeman', 'great', 'sidekick', 'angle', 'sharp-shooter', 'yet', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'needed', 'again', 'interested', 'just', 'who', 'man', 'is/was.-The', 'young', 'Woolvett', 'energy', '34', 'Schofield', 'Kid', '34', 'scene', 'first', 'man', 'one', 'best', 'whole', 'effort.-Hackman', 'nearly', 'whole', 'show', 'Little', 'Bill', 'as', 'tough', 'come', 'somewhat', 'set', 'up', 'be', '34', 'bad', 'guy', '34', 'most', 'great', 'movies', 'case', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'Maybe', 'Little', 'Bill', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'town', '34', 'clean', '34', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'Overall', 'then', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', '34', 'Unforgiven', '34', 'been', 'awarded', 'so', 'many', 'distinctions', 'Also', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'simmering', 'drama', 'increase', 'scene', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'last', 'western', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'ever', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'go', 'out', 'higher', 'note']",Unforgiven Snap Case
