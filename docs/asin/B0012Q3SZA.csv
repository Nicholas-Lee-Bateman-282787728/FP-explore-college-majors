His humor is not offensive and in your face, but talks about everyday things and stuff that he loves like pizza.  He humor is self depreciating, but not in a ""woe is me"" kind of way, but in a way that anyone can relate to.  If he ever came to Minneapolis, which he needs to already, I would not mind taking my kid to his show.  My kid wouldn't understand all of the jokes, but Birbigs is clean enough that I wouldn't have to cover his ears throughout.",5,Hilarious and Clean,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,527,"['Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'pure', 'talent', 'DVD', 'comedic', 'skills', 'humor', 'not', 'offensive', 'face', 'talks', 'everyday', 'things', 'stuff', 'pizza', 'humor', 'self', 'depreciating', 'not', 'woe', 'kind', 'way', 'way', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'ever', 'came', 'Minneapolis', 'already', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'taking', 'kid', 'show', 'kid', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'jokes', 'Birbigs', 'clean', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'ears']",Mike Birbiglia: What I Should Have Said Was Nothing - Tales From My Secret Public Journal

1138343,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B0012Q3SZA,G. Charles Steiner,"[1, 1]","Mike Birbiglia tells more tales from his private life publicly.  He's a very charming mellow fellow who really plays up the American sad sack kind of guy very well.  The tale of ironing his pants on a gym bench while Rudy Guiliani walks by wasn't particularly funny, but it was odd, unique, and Birbiglia's delivery is able to milk the event at least for a smile.  The audience stays with him and is on his side -- always.Still, My Girlfriend's Boyfriend is better than this performance for sheer fun, interest and laughs.  I recommend it over this show if you are a first-time taster of Mike Birbiglia's skill set in comedy.No matter how few the guffaws, Mike Birbiglia has a way of keeping you interested in what he's saying.This particular performance can be found for free on YouTube.
