678800,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005RDB0,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","No, this will not be a paean to the `transformative' nature of reading Samuel Clemens' (hereafter Mark Twain) seminal works, ""Huckleberry Finn"" and ""Tom Sawyer"" in childhood. I spend no long nights reading his works under a blanket, flashlight at the ready, until I fell asleep exhausted. (I did do that form of reading but not for Mr. Twain's work.) I, frankly, could not relate to the characters and the dialogue that seemed rather stilted (although I would not have known enough to call it that then). I do admit to having built a raft to try to `escape', along with my brothers, from some unfair sentence imposed my parents for some childhood transgression. But that can hardly be lain at Mr. Twain's door.Nor will this review be a homage to Twain's treasure chest of humor and witty sayings that are sprinkled through out this documentary, and that have become part of the common language (and were, in the old days, very quotable newspaper filler). This film only reinforced the notion, other than the famous ditty about his response to the premature announcement of his death and his comment about San Francisco in August, that I did not find his humor funny. That said, after viewing this fine almost four hour Ken Burns PBS documentary I will admit to an on-going curiosity about this, arguably, first great modern American writer. Hey, I said Mark Twain didn't ""speak"" to me. I know that he is a great writer, and I think I sensed that notion even as a kid.Ken Burns is probably the latter day master of the educational film documentary, most famously, and justly so, from the time of his ten-part PBS ""Civil War"" epic that I can still take in with my mind's eye. To a lesser degree, but with the same close attention to detail, a fine eye for selecting just the right photograph to make his point and appropriate musical scores in the background (including many variations of Stephan Foster songs that give a feel to the ""gilded age"" in which Twain lived and to which he added his own imprint).Here Burns goes through the obligatory life of the author, starting from the rough and tumble days in Missouri and on the Mississippi River, on through to the fits and starts of finding a niche for himself (and a job) in the American literary market to success, fleeting as that was at times, and the fame, fortune, and in the end misfortune that went with that final acknowledgement that he was the premier literary man and storyteller of his times. The heart of this exploration of Twain's life, and what made it intriguing for a skeptical non-literary man like me was the way in which Twain was portrayed as a representative man of his age. That included both in his appetites for success, financial and otherwise, and to be, and be seen, as a successful product of the rough and tumble democratic American social system of the time. No small part of that persona is attributed to his wife and family that seemed, through thick and thin, hard times and good, to be his anchor. Not every successful writer has had that stable foundation but Twain literally thrived on it.This film spend some time on Twain's literary production, his methods of work, his witticisms and his successful career as a public storyteller. I need not detail that information here. I would only say this-those who argue that Twain was first great American writer certainly have the best of the argument. In retrospect I can see where my own favorite from the 19th century, Nathaniel Hawthorne, really was not writing for the great democratic masses beginning their long search for some cultural expression to which they could relate. Twain, for literary and financial reasons, was trying to reach that audience.Finally, and here is where Mark Twain gets high marks from this reviewer, as the documentary pointedly highlights on many ocassions. Twain positioned himself as a truth-telling about the inequities of the world, the absurdities of racism and its cultural expressions and about the foolhardiness of the upcoming rise of the American empire that he was, in the end, helpless to stop. That he did so while feting kings and queens, the rich and famous and liking such activities points out the contradictions of his life as a man. A contradiction that more than one American would-be radical had faced unsuccessfully. But here is a home truth. We can always use an extra truth-teller or two, a rather rare commodity in any age. We can sort out Twain's contradictions from there. Twain devotee, or not, this documentary is worth four hours of your time.",5,The Avatar Of American Letters,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,4541,"['will', 'not', 'be', 'paean', 'transformative', 'nature', 'reading', 'Samuel', 'Clemens', 'hereafter', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'seminal', 'works', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'childhood', 'spend', 'long', 'nights', 'reading', 'works', 'blanket', 'flashlight', 'ready', 'fell', 'asleep', 'exhausted', 'did', 'do', 'form', 'reading', 'not', 'Mr', 'Twain', 'work', 'frankly', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'rather', 'stilted', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'enough', 'call', 'then', 'do', 'admit', 'having', 'built', 'raft', 'try', 'escape', 'brothers', 'unfair', 'sentence', 'imposed', 'parents', 'childhood', 'transgression', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'lain', 'Mr', 'Twain', 'door.Nor', 'will', 'review', 'be', 'homage', 'Twain', 'treasure', 'chest', 'humor', 'witty', 'sayings', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'documentary', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'common', 'language', 'were', 'old', 'days', 'very', 'quotable', 'newspaper', 'filler', 'film', 'only', 'reinforced', 'notion', 'other', 'famous', 'ditty', 'response', 'premature', 'announcement', 'death', 'comment', 'San', 'Francisco', 'August', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'humor', 'funny', 'said', 'viewing', 'fine', 'almost', 'four', 'hour', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'will', 'admit', 'on-going', 'curiosity', 'arguably', 'first', 'great', 'modern', 'American', 'writer', 'Hey', 'said', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'know', 'great', 'writer', 'think', 'sensed', 'notion', 'even', 'kid.Ken', 'Burns', 'probably', 'latter', 'day', 'master', 'educational', 'film', 'documentary', 'most', 'famously', 'justly', 'so', 'time', 'ten-part', 'PBS', 'Civil', 'War', 'epic', 'can', 'still', 'take', 'mind', 'eye', 'lesser', 'degree', 'same', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'fine', 'eye', 'selecting', 'just', 'right', 'photograph', 'make', 'point', 'appropriate', 'musical', 'scores', 'background', 'including', 'many', 'variations', 'Stephan', 'Foster', 'songs', 'give', 'feel', 'gilded', 'age', 'Twain', 'lived', 'added', 'own', 'imprint', '.Here', 'Burns', 'obligatory', 'life', 'author', 'starting', 'rough', 'tumble', 'days', 'Missouri', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'fits', 'starts', 'finding', 'niche', 'job', 'American', 'literary', 'market', 'success', 'fleeting', 'was', 'times', 'fame', 'fortune', 'end', 'misfortune', 'went', 'final', 'acknowledgement', 'was', 'premier', 'literary', 'man', 'storyteller', 'times', 'heart', 'exploration', 'Twain', 'life', 'what', 'made', 'intriguing', 'skeptical', 'non-literary', 'man', 'was', 'way', 'Twain', 'was', 'portrayed', 'representative', 'man', 'age', 'included', 'appetites', 'success', 'financial', 'otherwise', 'be', 'be', 'seen', 'successful', 'product', 'rough', 'tumble', 'democratic', 'American', 'social', 'system', 'time', 'No', 'small', 'part', 'persona', 'attributed', 'wife', 'family', 'seemed', 'thick', 'thin', 'hard', 'times', 'good', 'be', 'anchor', 'Not', 'successful', 'writer', 'had', 'stable', 'foundation', 'Twain', 'literally', 'thrived', 'it.This', 'film', 'spend', 'time', 'Twain', 'literary', 'production', 'methods', 'work', 'witticisms', 'successful', 'career', 'public', 'storyteller', 'need', 'not', 'detail', 'information', 'here', 'would', 'only', 'say', 'this-those', 'who', 'argue', 'Twain', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'American', 'writer', 'certainly', 'have', 'best', 'argument', 'retrospect', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'own', 'favorite', '19th', 'century', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'writing', 'great', 'democratic', 'masses', 'beginning', 'long', 'search', 'cultural', 'expression', 'could', 'relate', 'Twain', 'literary', 'financial', 'reasons', 'was', 'trying', 'reach', 'audience.Finally', 'here', 'where', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'high', 'marks', 'reviewer', 'documentary', 'pointedly', 'highlights', 'many', 'ocassions', 'Twain', 'positioned', 'truth-telling', 'inequities', 'world', 'absurdities', 'racism', 'cultural', 'expressions', 'foolhardiness', 'upcoming', 'rise', 'American', 'empire', 'was', 'end', 'helpless', 'stop', 'did', 'so', 'feting', 'kings', 'queens', 'rich', 'famous', 'liking', 'such', 'activities', 'points', 'out', 'contradictions', 'life', 'man', 'contradiction', 'more', 'one', 'American', 'would-be', 'radical', 'had', 'faced', 'unsuccessfully', 'here', 'home', 'truth', 'can', 'always', 'use', 'extra', 'truth-teller', 'two', 'rather', 'rare', 'commodity', 'age', 'can', 'sort', 'out', 'Twain', 'contradictions', 'there', 'Twain', 'devotee', 'not', 'documentary', 'worth', 'four', 'hours', 'time']",N/A

Wondefully captured.Some of the notable quotes I found are: ""I am not an American, I am The American"", ""I like Michael Angelo, but I cannot have him for break fast, lunch, dinner, supper and in between meals was a witty and worthy view about Rome"" and the best is the poster lines ""Doors open at 7.

678803,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005RDB0,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","This is a documentary put together by PBS, and apparently ran two nights. It is almost four hours long and covers two sides of a DVD. It is worth every minute.You get the usual talking heads, although some of them are genuinely interesting, especially Hal Holbrook, who played Mark Twain so successfully on the stage for so many years in a one-man show he called ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" Then there are some big-name writers and scholars, and they really do speak English, not Academia. Mostly.This is a biography, but it is specifically a time-line of his writings and what was going on in his life when he wrote each of the works. We all know that he took his pen name from the two fathom mark for the depth of the Mississippi River that marked the line between safe water and dangerous water. One of the commentators points out that Twain spent most of his life living on that edge between what was safe and what was dangerous. We Missourians know, of course, that he grew up in Hannibal, but I had not known before this that he was not actually born in Hannibal, but in a very tiny town nearby. He acknowledged that the character of Tom Sawyer was largely himself when he was a boy, and Huck Finn was drawn from his best friend at that time.Oddly enough for someone I know primarily as a cynic and finally an atheist, he was married to a very pious woman. They loved each other dearly, and he made a good-faith effort to be a Christian for her sake. They built a marvelous big house in Hartford, Connecticut, and raised three daughters. Their first-born, a son, died in infancy. They were completely happy for some time, but Twain invested in all sorts of things that lost money, his lifestyle was lavish, and eventually he fell deeply into debt. Twain declared bankruptcy, but a financier friend helped them save the house and his intellectual property rights, and Twain vowed he would pay back every penny to his creditors, although he was not legally bound to do so.Finally, they decided to do a tour of Europe and eventually around the world, where Twain lectured to packed houses. They loved him. The oldest daughter went with her parents, while the two younger ones stayed in the US with relatives. I believe he ended up getting two books out of their experiences, but certainly one: Following the Equator.But then the middle daughter, Suzy, fell sick and died back in Connecticut. They went home for awhile, and Clara married. But Twain's wife's health began to fail, and her doctor recommended they go back to Florence, where the climate was better for her.Without following all the details, I will just say that Twain suffered one loss after another, both personal and financial, and seemed only to be happy when he was in the limelight. He became known for his liberal opinions, his biting wit with regard to politics and religion, as well as on humanity and our foibles. He hated slavery, racism and antisemitism, and poked fun at the fat cats who exploited people without regard for their dignity and their rights.His entire story is told in thousands of photographs, and it is clear to see that he loved the camera. Indeed, Edison even did a short film of him toward the end of his life. Most of us have read several of his works, especially the fiction, but I am very happy to have finally bought several of the non-fiction books.",4,Ken Burns Does Justice to His Topic,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3345,"['documentary', 'put', 'together', 'PBS', 'apparently', 'ran', 'two', 'nights', 'almost', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'two', 'sides', 'DVD', 'worth', 'minute.You', 'get', 'usual', 'talking', 'heads', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'especially', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'who', 'played', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'so', 'successfully', 'stage', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'one-man', 'show', 'called', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Tonight', 'Then', 'are', 'big-name', 'writers', 'scholars', 'really', 'do', 'speak', 'English', 'not', 'Academia', 'Mostly.This', 'biography', 'specifically', 'time-line', 'writings', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'life', 'when', 'wrote', 'works', 'know', 'took', 'pen', 'name', 'two', 'fathom', 'mark', 'depth', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'marked', 'line', 'safe', 'water', 'dangerous', 'water', 'One', 'commentators', 'out', 'Twain', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'living', 'edge', 'what', 'was', 'safe', 'what', 'was', 'dangerous', 'Missourians', 'know', 'course', 'grew', 'up', 'Hannibal', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'born', 'Hannibal', 'very', 'tiny', 'town', 'nearby', 'acknowledged', 'character', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'was', 'largely', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'was', 'drawn', 'best', 'friend', 'time.Oddly', 'enough', 'someone', 'know', 'primarily', 'cynic', 'finally', 'atheist', 'was', 'married', 'very', 'pious', 'woman', 'loved', 'other', 'dearly', 'made', 'good-faith', 'effort', 'be', 'Christian', 'sake', 'built', 'marvelous', 'big', 'house', 'Hartford', 'Connecticut', 'raised', 'three', 'daughters', 'first-born', 'son', 'died', 'infancy', 'were', 'completely', 'happy', 'time', 'Twain', 'invested', 'sorts', 'things', 'lost', 'money', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'lavish', 'eventually', 'fell', 'deeply', 'debt', 'Twain', 'declared', 'bankruptcy', 'financier', 'friend', 'helped', 'save', 'house', 'intellectual', 'property', 'rights', 'Twain', 'vowed', 'would', 'pay', 'back', 'penny', 'creditors', 'was', 'not', 'legally', 'bound', 'do', 'so.Finally', 'decided', 'do', 'tour', 'Europe', 'eventually', 'world', 'where', 'Twain', 'lectured', 'packed', 'houses', 'loved', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'went', 'parents', 'two', 'younger', 'ones', 'stayed', 'US', 'relatives', 'believe', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'two', 'books', 'experiences', 'certainly', 'one', 'Following', 'Equator.But', 'then', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Suzy', 'fell', 'sick', 'died', 'back', 'Connecticut', 'went', 'home', 'awhile', 'Clara', 'married', 'Twain', 'wife', 'health', 'began', 'fail', 'doctor', 'recommended', 'go', 'back', 'Florence', 'where', 'climate', 'was', 'better', 'her.Without', 'following', 'details', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'Twain', 'suffered', 'one', 'loss', 'personal', 'financial', 'seemed', 'only', 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'was', 'limelight', 'became', 'known', 'liberal', 'opinions', 'biting', 'wit', 'regard', 'politics', 'religion', 'as', 'well', 'humanity', 'foibles', 'hated', 'slavery', 'racism', 'antisemitism', 'poked', 'fun', 'fat', 'cats', 'who', 'exploited', 'people', 'regard', 'dignity', 'rights.His', 'entire', 'story', 'told', 'thousands', 'photographs', 'clear', 'see', 'loved', 'camera', 'Indeed', 'Edison', 'even', 'did', 'short', 'film', 'end', 'life', 'Most', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'works', 'especially', 'fiction', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'finally', 'bought', 'several', 'non-fiction', 'books']",N/A

I was actually disappointed that I'd never gotten to meet Twain or see him perform in public.

Burns makes it work though by interspersing lots of methods of treatment.  The interviews with &quot;experts&quot; about Twain are of the highest caliber with the observations by Arthur Miller, William Styron and Hal Holbrook being the most perceptive ones.

Hu ""USMC journalist, turned Emba...","[3, 3]","I always admired Mark Twain, but his character gained entirely new dimensions for me when I saw him through the eyes of the scholars that Ken Burns captures on film. I thought of him simply as a great story teller with funny and fun characters like Tom Sawyer. I never thought of Mark as a social agitator and yet, I realize now just how much he edged into society. I have never read Huckleberry Finn, so I never realized just how dramatic that piece was. As Huckleberry Finn comes to think of ""...

Full of humor and insights into the life of America's greatest author. The story is full of Mark Twain's axioms and wisdom on life. This in itself makes it worth the price of the tape - In my opinion, Twain's humor and sayings are even greater tan the old master of Ben Franklin.The biography is not only laughs and humor, but there is also a considerable amount of commentary on Huck FInn (About 30 minutes). The insights on his works outside of Huck FInn are also enlightening - Tom Sawyer, Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Pudd'nhead Wilson, and Innocence Abroad... all add interesting perspective on Twain life and his place in literary history.Twain's/Clemens' life was fascinating - his rise and fall the humor and the tragedy. His life was as eclectic as his writings. He was everything from a steamboat captain to a correspondent in Hawaii. Twain traveled the world giving lectures and was a true ambassador to middle american life. All of this presented in a tight poignant tale by Ken Burns - great viewing.Final Verdict - A must for fans of Mark Twain and everyone who is a fan of American Literary History.

In the hands of Ken Burns, the richness and subtlety, the humour and tragedy, the successes and dismal failures and a true sustained analysis of the life of Samuel Clemens all combines to give us a personal and intellectual understanding of this towering literary icon of the 19th century. Twain was many things - a riverboat pilot, printer, journalist, miner, speculator, failed business man, and satirist, but most of all a novelist, a grand storyteller that spoke to royalty, presidents as well as the common people. Ernest Hemingway once said that American literature began with the publication of Huckleberry Finn. Twain chose to write this book in the language of the vernacular, while other writers maintained an allegiance to English prose, Huck Finn's voice rose above conformity, informing the American public that the black American was not just a commodity, an object of scorn and prejudice, but a human being. This book not only changed our views on literature but our humanity as well. This film does not skim over the surface of Twain's life and work, but digs deeper into his motivations and inspirations in the context of his environment.~Mark Twain~ took almost three years to produce, which includes hundreds of photographs, actual film footage of the man at home, informed interviews with Twain scholars and writers that give us keen insights into his life and work. What this film shows is that not only is his literature extraordinary, but his life as well. And this life is told mainly through the words of the man himself. Twain lived a dual persona, the man and the celebrity. As another writer has said, this dual persona came to symbolize the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth-morality and freewheeling ambition. Twain lived an extravagant life though hated everything that this represented. He was the author of the Gilded Age, a scathing satire on the post civil war period in which the country prospered and money was worshiped above all things, yet his wealth and lifestyle emulated that very thing he was satirizing. He claimed that he wasn't American, but `the' American. He was a man of genius and contradictions but above all, human, a man who showed us through his work, with a sly wink, that we're all human and essentially in the same boat.This film is undoubtedly one of the best portraits of Mark Twain ever to be done. After watching the film in its entirety, I was hard pressed to find any genuine criticisms, other than minor quibbles and therefore not worth mentioning.

But the life of this man Samuel Clemens and his incarnation of Mark Twain humbled me in ways--you were right--I had to see and experience.I was ready to easily ""forgive"" Mark Twain for a racism that probably--if not obviously--never existed in him because it protected an ignorant perspective I had on both him and his work. Clemens grew up in 19th century America, which perhaps for anyone else says it all. But I see now not just where his work and genius codified if not invented true American literature, but how his work and genius in that context combined with the Civil Rights movements of the late 19th and later 20th centuries to save the collective American soul. This was metaphorically underscored by the almost trivial fact that he saw to it that that genius lawyer McGuinne, the Black laywer mentor of Thurgood Marshall, graduated from Yale Law School by paying his tuition (and he graduated at the top of his class). I call myself an American--sometimes even a literate American--and I knew nothing about this man before this DVD. Wow. And yet that is nothing to be ashamed of, depsite the new desire I have to know him as a function of better knowing and loving my own soul better and more welling up in me; feelings and desires that usually well up within me when shame is at the source driving them. I felt like a child discovering something beautiful and powerful for the first time when I watched Twain's life unfold in this DVD, in the way children in their innocence see the magic of both themselves and the universe simultaneously, and do so unashamed. This humility in discovery, leading to the outer world discovery being metaphorical to the inner, is the source of all art, and all life. And Samuel Clemens knew this better than most people alive in any time, let alone his own. He reminded me of Richard Burton (the actor's namesake)--who I also know next to nothing about, yet am also inspired by the romantic/spiritual quest of his life, and the knowledge and beauty it produced.I haven't been this impressed by a single artist in history in a long time. (And he's a Sagittarius too! Ha-ha! Like Beethoven, Sinatra and Spielberg! Does it get any better?!) The review I write for this DVD will be a lot like the one I wrote for the autiobiography of Malcolm X.I hope the irony of that will not be lost on anyone.This Mark Twain DVD of Ken Burns is beautiful. It is not just awe-inspiring, it is in it's own artistic way life-altering--like its subject matter. I can only sit back, listen to authors and artists ranging from Arthur Miller to Bugs Bunny genius Chuck Jones share profound insghts, see both the triumphs and the tragedies of his life unfold, and feel the power of love upon reflecting on Twain's life, artistic legacy and Ken Burns' magesterial work in this DVD....",5,"""Race and Space""; a window to an American, kaleidescopic man",1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,2918,"['am', 'humbled', 'man', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'was', 'normal', 'genius', 'self', 'interpretation', 'life', 'life', 'man', 'Samuel', 'Clemens', 'incarnation', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'humbled', 'ways', 'were', 'right', 'had', 'see', 'experience.I', 'was', 'ready', 'easily', 'forgive', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'racism', 'probably', 'not', 'obviously', 'never', 'existed', 'protected', 'ignorant', 'perspective', 'had', 'work', 'Clemens', 'grew', 'up', '19th', 'century', 'America', 'perhaps', 'anyone', 'else', 'see', 'now', 'not', 'just', 'where', 'work', 'genius', 'codified', 'not', 'invented', 'true', 'American', 'literature', 'how', 'work', 'genius', 'context', 'combined', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movements', 'late', '19th', 'later', '20th', 'centuries', 'save', 'collective', 'American', 'soul', 'was', 'metaphorically', 'underscored', 'almost', 'trivial', 'fact', 'saw', 'lawyer', 'McGuinne', 'Black', 'laywer', 'mentor', 'Thurgood', 'Marshall', 'graduated', 'Yale', 'Law', 'School', 'paying', 'tuition', 'graduated', 'top', 'class', 'call', 'American', 'sometimes', 'even', 'literate', 'American', 'knew', 'nothing', 'man', 'DVD', 'Wow', 'yet', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'depsite', 'new', 'desire', 'have', 'know', 'function', 'better', 'knowing', 'loving', 'own', 'soul', 'better', 'more', 'welling', 'up', 'feelings', 'desires', 'usually', 'well', 'up', 'when', 'shame', 'source', 'driving', 'felt', 'child', 'discovering', 'something', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'Twain', 'life', 'unfold', 'DVD', 'way', 'children', 'innocence', 'see', 'magic', 'universe', 'simultaneously', 'do', 'so', 'unashamed', 'humility', 'discovery', 'leading', 'outer', 'world', 'discovery', 'being', 'metaphorical', 'inner', 'source', 'art', 'life', 'Samuel', 'Clemens', 'knew', 'better', 'most', 'people', 'alive', 'time', 'let', 'alone', 'own', 'reminded', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'actor', 'namesake', 'who', 'also', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'about', 'yet', 'am', 'also', 'inspired', 'romantic/spiritual', 'quest', 'life', 'knowledge', 'beauty', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'impressed', 'single', 'artist', 'history', 'long', 'time', 'Sagittarius', 'too', 'Ha-ha', 'Beethoven', 'Sinatra', 'Spielberg', 'get', 'better', 'review', 'write', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'one', 'wrote', 'autiobiography', 'Malcolm', 'X.I', 'hope', 'irony', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'lost', 'anyone.This', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'DVD', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'beautiful', 'not', 'just', 'awe-inspiring', 'own', 'artistic', 'way', 'life-altering', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'back', 'authors', 'artists', 'ranging', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'genius', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'share', 'profound', 'insghts', 'see', 'triumphs', 'tragedies', 'life', 'unfold', 'feel', 'power', 'love', 'reflecting', 'Twain', 'life', 'artistic', 'legacy', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'magesterial', 'work', 'DVD']",N/A

While taking a Mark Twain course at Stanford University in 2010, I decided to learn as much as I could about this most beloved author by reading all his novels, most of his essays, his recently published autobiography and other works. I even attended a ""Mark Twain Live"" performance by Hal Holbrook, who has been channeling Twain for over 50 years. But the single most useful source was the film directed by Ken Burns. In his usual thorough manner, Ken Burns and crew set about to document the life and accomplishments of Mark Twain, embellished in the Burns trademark style with hundreds of photographs, maps, journal entries, readings and even a few rudimentary film clips.No aspect of Samuel Clemens' life was omitted from this documentary - his family and relationships, the early death of his daughter, his failed businesses, and his travels throughout Europe. Though we think of him as a commentator and author able to find the humor in anything, he faced great sadness in his life, facing financial ruin several times and outliving his wife and 3 of his 4 children.Burns' trademark style of panning over still photographs makes the presentation more dynamic than could normally be expected from what is essentially a slide show.

If your local library doesn't have it, make them get it; every school and library in the land should have this at the front of their dvd collection.If ever there was doubt as to Twain's status as one of the finest and most quintessentially American of American artists, it is laid to rest here. A stunningly tragic life filled with triumphant humor and wisdom is given gorgeous tribute; the deep and almost transcendant love of the interviewees for Twain is especially striking.Burns' pet technique of panning over still photos is tailor-made for this story and era. I'm not sure if it was thinking of my deep childhood love of Twain's books or just how moving his life was, but I found myself crying more during these four hours than any other movie I can recall. By the tenth deluge I had to laugh and realize that this is the best biographical film I have ever seen.If you love Twain's writing, you will be amazed at the sadness he lived through while writing some of the funniest words ever penned. Even if you've never read any Twain, you will marvel at the life he lived, and the strength he showed in the face of one tragedy after another.This is the American Spirit writ large.

I pick up a handful of Kurt Vonnegut's work and absolutely fall in love.  I then see, in Palm Sunday, his essay on Twain.  I figure, ""If he likes him so, I should give the old guy another try.""And I did, and I couldn't have been more glad.I picked up Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn one night and shot through them like a train through a piece of paper.  A new admiration and intense respect was born.I went on to pick up Yankee, Prince and Pudd'nhead, only to delve deeper into the genius that was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.This documentary is, by far, bar none, the greatest and most intimate documentary I've yet to see.  You get the idea of what Twain was all about, be it a social critic, an absolutely devoted father, a quick tempered Missourian, or an eternally loving husband.For all the absolute suffering that he went through, all people, be they great or seemingly miniscule, go through a great deal of suffering, but none in comparison seem to have gone through as much as Twain, the fact that he continued on joking and biting at politics the way he did is just astonishing.I'd always been a bit hesitant to put my hands on anything by Burns, what with his reputation for being an over the top, boring, self gratifying pompous (fight censorship), but this was done with such finesse that all presumptions flew right out the window.The excellent narration by Keith David need well be noted.Now if only Burns would do documentaries on Thoreau and Faulkner.",5,"THE American: a hero, an icon, a human being",1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,1667,"['Being', 'still', 'young', 'man', '21', 'can', 'vividly', 'remember', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'hateful', 'relationship', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn.Cue', 'years', 'later', 'revived', 'interest', 'literature', 'pick', 'up', 'handful', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'work', 'absolutely', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'see', 'Palm', 'Sunday', 'essay', 'Twain', 'figure', 'so', 'should', 'give', 'old', 'guy', 'try', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'glad.I', 'picked', 'up', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'one', 'night', 'shot', 'train', 'piece', 'paper', 'new', 'admiration', 'intense', 'respect', 'was', 'born.I', 'went', 'pick', 'up', 'Yankee', 'Prince', ""Pudd'nhead"", 'only', 'delve', 'deeper', 'genius', 'was', 'Samuel', 'Langhorne', 'Clemens.This', 'documentary', 'far', 'bar', 'none', 'greatest', 'most', 'intimate', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'Twain', 'was', 'be', 'social', 'critic', 'absolutely', 'devoted', 'father', 'quick', 'tempered', 'Missourian', 'eternally', 'loving', 'absolute', 'suffering', 'went', 'people', 'be', 'great', 'seemingly', 'miniscule', 'go', 'great', 'deal', 'suffering', 'none', 'comparison', 'seem', 'have', 'gone', 'as', 'much', 'Twain', 'fact', 'continued', 'joking', 'biting', 'politics', 'way', 'did', 'just', 'astonishing.I', ""'d"", 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'put', 'hands', 'anything', 'Burns', 'what', 'reputation', 'being', 'top', 'boring', 'self', 'gratifying', 'pompous', 'fight', 'censorship', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'finesse', 'presumptions', 'flew', 'right', 'window.The', 'excellent', 'narration', 'Keith', 'David', 'need', 'well', 'be', 'noted.Now', 'only', 'Burns', 'would', 'do', 'documentaries', 'Thoreau', 'Faulkner']",N/A

Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner cited &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; as the father of the American novel.  I recall Hemingway calling it the greatest of American novels.  In fact, Twain once said of himself, &quot;I am not an American, I am the American.&quot;  Born Samuel Langhorn Clemens, he arrived with Haley's Comet and predicted he would depart on its return.  He did.  In between he became the most famous of all living persons and entertained all classes of the English speaking world with his effortless wit and wisdom --  often attacking hypocrisy and greed and racism along the way.  He took his pen name, Mark Twain, from the phrase Mississippi river boatmen used to signify a depth off 12 feet -- the point at which dangerous water became safe or vice versa.  Ken Burns' magnificent 220 minute documentary looks at Twain's personal life from hardscrabble backwoods boyhood to international acclaim.  Loaded with period photos and a wonderfully authentic soundtrack, Twain's words come alive and are further colored with informed commentary from Twain scholars.  There's ample bonus material including a making of and behind the scenes features, interviews and outtakes.  This is truly a life on film and it is superb in all aspects.
