1251374,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0026AZULQ,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Carbine Williams, 1952 filmDavid Marsh Williams returned from the Navy and planned to marry his childhood sweetheart Maggie. He is one of eight sons. He gets a job with the railroad and hopes to earn more money. A coworker offers him a chance to earn more money operating a boiler. Moonshining is against the law. March plans to buy a farm. Federal agents killed a moonshiner who resisted arrest. There is an accident, Marsh is scalded. Maggie finds out and tells him to quit. He continues this work. Federal agents raid his still. Alive or dead? They escape arrest. But a Federal agent was killed! He surrenders and is tried and convicted. He violated the 18th Amendment. At age ten he made his first gun out of wood. There is a plea deal to a reduced charge.But a new judge sentenced him to 30 years at hard labor. A burst appendix sends him to the hospital. A stoolie is knifed, a shiv is found on Marsh. He is sent to the chain gang. Violators are whipped. Marsh went to prison farm. One day he fixes the gun of the Captain, who orders him to write his folks. One day he kills a rattlesnake! Later he is sent to ""the hole"" (solitary confinement) for a month! He is given 24 hours furlough. He is reassigned to the blacksmith shop, and designs a new kind of a gun. He secretly works on his idea until it is discovered. In time the story leaks. His gun is five pounds lighter, it would allow a soldier to carry more ammunition. His short-stroke piston is a valuable invention. He received a full pardon. The M-1 carbine was used in WW II.This M-1 carbine was said to be favored by Audie Murphy.

Maybe it was just my particular disc, but this product really disappointed. The video quality was excellent, but what does that matter if you have unconstrained noise on the audio? Do note that this is an unrestored DVD-R of this film issued by Warner Brothers with absolutely no extras and no chapter stops. You can only go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments.As for the movie itself, it is an excellent and unusual film starring James Stewart as a moonshiner serving a thirty year sentence for the death of a federal officer who raided his still. Williams is quite bitter as he really doesn't understand why and how he landed in prison, and doesn't feel like his fate is just. He and the warden of the prison (Wendell Corey) soon wind up in a semi-adversarial relationship, with the warden seeing that Williams is an exceptional individual, but still needing to rein him in for the purpose of maintaining order at the prison. In time the trust between the two grows as the warden really sticks his neck out and allows Williams to work on building an experimental rifle in the prison metal shop.I highly recommend this film, but as a disappointed customer I advise you steer clear of this product.",3,What took them so long indeed...,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,1315,"['considering', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'worse', 'broadcast', 'film', 'TCM', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'particular', 'disc', 'product', 'really', 'disappointed', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'what', 'matter', 'have', 'unconstrained', 'noise', 'audio', 'Do', 'note', 'unrestored', 'DVD-R', 'film', 'issued', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'absolutely', 'extras', 'chapter', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'forwards', 'backwards', 'ten', 'minute', 'increments.As', 'movie', 'excellent', 'unusual', 'film', 'starring', 'James', 'Stewart', 'moonshiner', 'serving', 'thirty', 'year', 'sentence', 'death', 'federal', 'officer', 'who', 'raided', 'still', 'Williams', 'quite', 'bitter', 'really', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'how', 'landed', 'prison', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fate', 'just', 'warden', 'prison', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'soon', 'wind', 'up', 'semi-adversarial', 'relationship', 'warden', 'seeing', 'Williams', 'exceptional', 'individual', 'still', 'needing', 'rein', 'purpose', 'maintaining', 'order', 'prison', 'time', 'trust', 'two', 'grows', 'warden', 'really', 'neck', 'Williams', 'work', 'building', 'experimental', 'rifle', 'prison', 'metal', 'shop.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'disappointed', 'customer', 'advise', 'steer', 'clear', 'product']",Carbine Williams
