I watched all of the first three seasons via Amazon's Prime Instant Videos. As I was finishing Season 2, my oldest girl (11) got curious and asked if she could see it, too. So, when I was doing her hair, we watched it together. Then her excitement got our son (10) engaged (doesn't usually like British shows), and then our youngest girl (7) - and surprisingly the young one actually paid attention to most of it and told me she liked it, too. She actually remembers parts of it.Very engaging show. It's part of our homeschool. And we'll be reading some of the books about it and sharing on our Butterfly Homeschool Blog, too.Something weird happened with Season 3. I was expecting 11 episodes because that's what they listed on the Amazon site, but they ended it at 9 with a major cliff hanger.So, then I found out that they now have an email alert sign up form for the next season. (Just search for season 4)Initially, I wasn't so sure I was going to like it very much. I had seen bits and pieces of it on regular TV. So, I decided to give it another chance because it was free with Amazon Prime. SOOOOO glad that I did. The one thing I didn't love about the earlier shows, which I feel that they've been resolving in the later shows, was the amount of hostility between the nobels and the regular folks. It seems like their youngest child helped them to become a bit more open. And I really really started loving the show more once I saw a shift in attitudes, a little bit, at least. The tension is still there, but it seems to be shifting gradually with the times.Because I have been to England and traveled through both the countryside and some of the major cities, it thrills me when they take them beyond just the castle in some of the later episodes. If you love the British Isles, you'll definitely enjoy the scenery in these shows.Okay, well I could go on and on, but will stop now. I hope you drop by our homeschool blog and check out the list of books about the show that our friend reviewed and shared with us.Thanks for reading!~Donna, The Mommy ButterflyP.S.

The acting is superb and the characters seem so real, which is why it's one of the top-rated and highly anticipated dramas to date.  Maggie Smith and Elizabeth McGovern are delightful in their performances and give the American viewer two fine actresses he or she can relate to, while introducing a whole new group of fine English actors whose characters everyone will embrace.Season three begins with Mathew and Mary getting married and the Crawley family have to face the fact that they may lose Downton Abbey to loss of money.  I strongly urge viewers to purchase all three seasons.  Season one introduces the family and servants in the year 1912 during the sinking of the Titanic, and season two involves everyone tackling the hardships of World War 1.  Some of the topics included in the Downton Abbey series are prostitution, May-December romances, prison, WW1, the sinking of the Titanic, miscarriage, and of course, many scandals.Don't miss out on this wonderful series!

I can't say I'm as obsessed as the rest of the country with Downton Abbey, but  have still enjoyed the series very much. A story that starts in 1912 (right after the sinking of the Titanic) set in the ""upstairs/downstairs"" world of Downton, the home of the Earl of Grantham, his family and his servants, might not seem relatable to a contemporary American audience, but this is really a show about people.

1520688,A3R9HPWFF9QWSN,B006W9KNXC,"David Keymer ""David Keymer""","[0, 0]","Downton Abbey: Seasons 1-3. (2010-2012). 3 sets of 3 DVDs. Written by Julian Fellows.Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery, Jessica Brown Findlay, Laura Carmichael, Dan Stevens, Penelope Wilton, Allen Leech, Maggie Smith, Shirley MacLaine, Jim Carter, Phyllis Logan, Leslie Nicol, Brendan Coyle, Joanne Froggatt, Siobhan Finneran, Rob James-Collier, Sophie McShera, others.I bought the DVDs for seasons 1-3 of Downton Abbey as a birthday present for my wife, and what a great present they were! We finished watching season 3 a couple of days ago, ran through all the ancillary features -""The Making of This,"" ""The Making of That,"" etc., and sat there feeling like we'd lost family, at least until season 4 appears.So the starting point of his review is simply to say what a wonderful experience it is to watch this series unfold across time, from 1914 to (now) 1920? 21? 22? I'm not sure exactly when series 3 ends but it's very early in the 20s, at the start of a formative decade that shook social and behavioral patterns in the western world.What is so excellent about Downton Abbey? I'm tempted to start with the actors, who are superb, but I won't. It's the feeling of time, place and caste that makes this series superior. There's a downstairs world and an upstairs world. They frequently cross but the lower world never supersedes the upper one. It's a mini-history of the twentieth century, where, after the Great War ended, the rules kept changing, always in favor of flexibility, at least until the late 30s. Lady Sybil (is she daughter 2 or daughter 3 of the Grantham line?) elopes with the chauffeur, who is, on top of all his other social solecisms, an Irish nationalist. Lady Edith seems to be ending up in a non-marriage relationship with a modern man who can't divorce his wife because, with her mad, she can't be proved blameful. Everyone, even the most conservative (Robert, Earl of Grantham, Lady Violet, his imperious but wised and always snippy mother), must bend to the winds of change. So one reason to love Downton Abbey is that it captures in an extraordinarily prescient fashion the dramatic (and thus exciting) changes that were tasking place in English society in the early Twenties.There is too the visual sweep of the series. Downton Abbey, a real place but not the Granthams' place, is (pick one or more) 1. Impressive, 2. Beautiful, 3. Representative of a Time Long Past But Worth Remembering. The producers of the series have not stinted in making this series visually beautiful, from costumes (oh my God! The dresses countess Grantham [Elizabeth McGovern], Lady Violet [Maggie Smith], and Ladies Mary, Sybil, and Edith wear!  And the men's outfits, in an age before Shoddy Chic became fashionable. If you were to make a Dream World in which you could dress, act and feel, this would probably be it.So finally we get to script and acting. Julian Fellowes wrote the script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park (2001), a film that has echoes to this series. Between Fellowes, who knows this world from the inside, and the historical advisor for the series, whose name I forget but who is VERY good!, this series is, to use English outdated slang, ""spot on."" The story line may exaggerate at moments but whatever happens in this series, upstairs or downstairs, is historically right on the mark. IT shows how much we like peeking in on a world that actually existed.Acting? I may have missed someone, but I counted 49 characters in this complicated, multi-year drama who have at least one scene, and lines to deliver. In short, 49 people who are not ciphers, extras, standard bearers, but are instead real people.I've directed plays. I even, one time, directed a drama with fifty actors in it. (The Insect Comedy, by Karel and Josef Capek.) If you haven't done a drama of that scope, you have no idea how difficult it is to do! Take it for granted that the principal actors, upstairs and downstairs, are good. But 49 characters! The mind boggles.I like also that the characters are not uni-dimensional.  It's easier to see with the series  Bad Guys, of whom there are three -no, four, if you include the Press Baron whom Lady Mary almost marries in series 2.There's Lady Edith, the resentful `ugly duckling' sister, who, in season 1, betrays Lady Mary's shameful secret. But by season 3, you admire her. She refuses to be a cipher, an all to common ending for aristocratic ladies of the late teens and early twenties. She's been jilted at the altar and you feel for her.  She seems on her way to be self-directed professional lady leading an unconventional life of affection. Hurrah for Lady Edith! You certainly don't feel animosity towards her.The two for a while resolutely malevolent Bad Guys in the servants' quarters are O'Brien, Lady Cora's dresser, and Thomas, eventually, it seems, an under-butler, but other roles en route. O'Brien is your conventional malcontent but at a crucial moment she says to herself, ""No, I'm not as bad as that,"" and she has, underneath her resentment, a real loyalty to Lady Cora, a bond of affection I'm not sure she even realizes. As to Thomas, he's so evil and Machiavellian that when Shirley MacLaine arrived to join in on the third season, when she saw him, she said, ""Oh, you're the evil one!"" Bu he sobs his heart out when something wrenchingly bad happens to one of the members of the Grantham clan in series 2 (Anna, throughout a Good Guy among the servants, puts her hand around him, and if Anna vouches for him, even for a moment , so will I!) and his plight at the end of the last episode in season 3 leaves you think that his malignity isn't so much his fault as his situation.Is the series always realistic? No. What happens to its characters is sometimes -often--exaggerated. But who cares? This is a wonderfully acted, written, staged and costumed series about major issues in modern life., and when you're done with it, the players in this gripping drama feel like your neighbors and relatives.",5,THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY AND CLOSE NEIGHBORS,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,5990,"['Downton', 'Abbey', 'Seasons', '1-3', '2010-2012', '3', 'sets', '3', 'DVDs', 'Written', 'Julian',

It wasn't talked about or written about. It was easy to be innocent about such things back then. The men would likely have been outraged by the very idea. Today, it is quite different. As gays come out of the closet, we know them and know their humanity and thus accepting. It would not have been likely to happen back then. Also, they have muddled Thomas's character. He is basically unlikeable for many reasons. Then the writers have tried to soften his image so that a gay man is shown to be likeable.

(TRIVIA NOTE: I was a ""small time"" actress, always reviewed well and spent 30 acting years loving every minute; some professional, 1 movie, a t.v. show where I ended up on the cutting room floor, lots of community/college theatre and performances in U.S. Armed Forces theatre ""at home and abroad"" [am a Veteran, too - but that's another story!]. In DA the acting is superb; the plots are enthralling; the costuming is absolutely gorgeous; the characters are all fascinating and I'd almost sell my soul to the Devil to be cast in such an outstanding series of film. Mr. Fellowes is a very fine writer and he hit the jackpot with DA. The social mores of the period in which DA takes place are an education in themselves.

After the final build-up to the romance of Lady Mary and her cousin at the end of Season 2, this new series fleshes out the complex development of their relationship.  But suddenly after Lady Mary has given birth to her child, there is one short final shot of Matthew Crowley's death in a car accident.I understand that Dan Stevens did not want to continue playing Matthew, so apparently Julian Fellowes decided that, therefore, he had to eliminate the character of Matthew, but given the arc of ""Downton Abbey,"" this does not make a lot of sense, at least from the dramatic point of view.  It is a let-down and very contrived.  Surely the producers could have found another gifted actor to play Matthew (with the viewers more than able to accept the change).The romance between Lady Mary and Matthew was one of the most interesting and touching sub-plots, and without it, I think ""Downton Abbey"" will lose interest (the sub-plots concerning, respectively, Edith, Robert Crawley and his American wife, Bates and Anna, and the other servants being less dramatically compelling) quickly.  One wonders how Matthew would have continue to work at saving Downton Abbey as the heir and also co-proprietor, and how his relationship with Lady Mary would have developed.Now all this has been  blown to bits, so to speak.(What about a fan campaign to change the ending of Season 3?).",4,"Very disappointing, disjointed ending to the series",1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,1555,"['much', 'recommend', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'especially', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'actors', 'bring', 'life.But', 'ending', 'Season', '3', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'final', 'build-up', 'romance', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'cousin', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'new', 'series', 'out', 'complex', 'development', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'given', 'birth', 'child', 'one', 'short', 'final', 'shot', 'Matthew', 'Crowley', 'death', 'car', 'accident.I', 'understand', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'continue', 'playing', 'Matthew', 'so', 'apparently', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'decided', 'therefore', 'had', 'eliminate', 'character', 'Matthew', 'given', 'arc', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'not', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'least', 'dramatic', 'point', 'view', 'let-down', 'very', 'contrived', 'Surely', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'gifted', 'actor', 'play', 'Matthew', 'viewers', 'more', 'able', 'accept', 'change', 'romance', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Matthew', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'touching', 'sub-plots', 'think', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'will', 'lose', 'interest', 'sub-plots', 'concerning', 'respectively', 'Edith', 'Robert', 'Crawley', 'American', 'wife', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'other', 'servants', 'being', 'less', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'quickly', 'One', 'how', 'Matthew', 'would', 'have', 'continue', 'work', 'saving', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'heir', 'also', 'co-proprietor', 'how', 'relationship', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'would', 'have', 'developed.Now', 'been', 'blown', 'bits', 'so', 'speak', 'What', 'fan', 'campaign', 'change', 'ending', 'Season', '3']",N/A

While Season 1 had the best writing of all, and Season 2 accurately depicted World War 1 era issues, this season is focused on intimate issues of marriage, class, and family economics.  Startling family members die off (not our Maggie Smith!) and new careers are sought by the former Chauffeur as well as middle sister Edith.  The Earl loses a fortune on bad stocks, but Matthew devises a way out.  Mary finally gets her wedding and tries valiantly to get pregnant.  Sybil leaves Ireland and wants to have her baby at Downton.  Falsely imprisoned Bates finally gets help to appeal his murder conviction, and new staff are hired downstairs.  Young kitchen maid Daisy, widowed during the war, thinks she might be ready to find love again since her supervisor, Mrs. Patmore, seems willing to add romance to her own busy life as Downton Abbey's Cook.  Matthew's widowed mother might have romantic options as well, while a new character, a wildly romantic 18 year old great niece of the Dowager Countess, makes her first appearance.  As in life, not all characters' adventures lead to happy endings.  Instead of eagerly desiring new episodes for a vividly realized production, this series ends on a note of sober reckoning.  How long must characters wait for equal opportunities?  How can we continue to care deeply about a series which kills off our most beloved characters?

Breathtakingly beautiful, every frame reminds one of the works of portrait artist, John Singer Sargent, indeed, his works may prove to have been the inspiration for the careful art direction. Downton Abby isn't simply a window on the wealth and society of old monied England, and peripherally, America, but it is an honest representation of all that was decent and fine in these Lords and Ladies whoes privalege was never taken for granted, and whoes sense of responsibility bade them care for their fortunes for the fortunes of so many others depended upon their kind and faithful stewardship. In this series, destined to be an instant classic, no stone is left unturned in every minute detail of costume, furnishing, language, wit and scathing criticism. Though lofty, the gentry are human and, if pressed, quite kind. What is fascinating is how disapproving the majority of well-to-do become around, what we would consider to be, the vulgarities of 'new money', or, in this case, newly aquired old money. Downton Abbey is a must see, as it reminds the viewer that, far from stuck-up elitists, these men and women were the substance of the bond that held the Empire together.

Seeing the differences in the classes of servants vs the upper class was an amazing experience.  We Americans can't begin to understand the tight lines that were drawn between the classes and other than we might think it wasn't fair, but after watching Downton Abbey, I've since changed my mind.  Lord Grantham is a compassionate and caring employers, even paying their hospital bills and giving them a place to stay when they retire.Sure, Lord Grantham owns a castle-like home along with hundreds of acres and the village.  He, along with his ancestors for hundreds of years, have had the responsibility of the lives of the farmers and all of the people depending on Lord Grantham to do what's right in order to continue their almost idyllic existence.  Today we choose our own jobs and take care of ourselves, but many of us slip through the cracks.In the world of Downton Abbey, those willing to work are well taken care of, though one of the servants chooses to step out of the narrow lines of propriety and pays the price of losing her job, and then having to take up the lowest form of work with no hope of ever escaping her fate.The story of the Crawley's continues along with the story of the servants downstairs in season 3.  What's amazing about this series is how well-drawn and realistic the characters are.  There are no card-board cut-outs, these people have real problems that are not glazed over in the least.  I found the lives of the servants as compelling, if not more so at times, than the upper class who they served.  I was also amazed at the respect the family shows for their servants, asking about their lives and helping them in times of troubles.Watching Downton Abbey is a pleasure you don't have to feel guilty about because you're learning so much about a period of time that might be too dry to read about history books.  Julian Fellowes brings to life a period of time that started to crumble with WWI, when the servants who went to war, along side the Lords, brought down the barriers that stood for so long in English society.I won't give away of the wonderful plot points, other than to say that season 3 does not disappoint.
