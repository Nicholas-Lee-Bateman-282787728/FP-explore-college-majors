I switched my brain off and just enjoyed this boarder-crossing, drug-smuggling, aww-shucks family of misfits moments movie.  But didn't switch off too much - there were some decent lines and scenes I wanted to squirrel away.  I didn't recognize Jason Sudeikis until he got his ""dork"" haircut.  I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston - she's not the strongest actress is an unneeded criticism.  This is not a strong film - one review I read referred to this film as ""undemanding"".  I like that in a summer movie that has a corny premise to begin with.  I really liked the street-smart daughter and best of the bunch: the complete awkward Kenny (Will Poulter).  And a nice twist at the end with the DEA dad and his over-sized metal travel mug.

1624430,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00BC36YWC,Alan Ramirez,"[1, 2]","When I saw the trailer of this movie, I knew it wouldn't dissapoint... it looked so funny, and just as the trailer promises, the movie is even funnier!I was waiting for this since it was announced, because I'm a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, and I like Emma Roberts too.The story moves on quickly without anything taking your mind off the main plot (which happens a lot in current comedies), and it's filled of clever jokes that will make you laugh out loud, and even sexual jokes (but finally tasteful sexual jokes that actually make you laugh, and not feel disgusted or annoyed like it happens with other movies), for me, that was the best, the way they handled sex with comedy without getting too disgusting or too naive.Jason and Jennifer have a great chemistry, and Emma Roberts impresses the audience with a bad girl role after always playing a nice girl on her other movies. But Kenny (played by Will Poulter), was the best of the movie. Kenny is the typical stupid guy in a comedy, but finally, this movie shows that a character doesn't have to be annoyingly stupid to be funny, just the necessary when it's needed! I hope to see this guy soon in other movies because he really has the talent.The film counts with unexpected twists that leave the audience shocked, but still making you laugh throughout the whole movie. The only thing that I didn't liked was the ending, I thought it was too predictable, but still enjoyable! Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I even dare to call it one of the best comedies of 2013 so far!

In ""We're the Millers"", Jennifer get's to play with Jason Sudeikis and Emma Roberts, which results in some luscious dark humor. I did not know what to expect from a rated comedy and we were wondering, why even risk this cinematic balancing act, but it pays off most of the time.

Every once in a while though, a film comes along that pretty much defines &#8216;comedy&#8217;, that recklessly throws laughs your way, all caution to the wind, balls to the wall, &#8216;git &#8216;er done&#8217; attitude that makes you smile ear to ear.I can&#8217;t promise perfection, but this is clearly comedy!Conceptually, this sounds like something that really shouldn&#8217;t work.  I mean, it is so ridiculous in concept that it really feels and looks like something that should crash and burn in the first act.  Thankfully, the trailer delivered a smidgen of hope in a cast that looked really up to par with the outlandish material, because if it hadn&#8217;t been for the cleverly cut trailer, I may have passed on this entirely.I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t.&#8216;We&#8217;re the Millers&#8217; tells the story of David Clark, an immature and self-centered man who never grew up.  He still sells pot and lives in a pretty crumby apartment building.  When his neighbor Kenny decides he wants to save a hobo from a group of thugs, David winds up getting beaten and robbed and essentially screwed since he now owes his boss, Brad Gurdlinger, a lot of money.  That is when he is given an ultimatum; go to Mexico and pick up a &#8216;smidgen&#8217; of weed, or die.  Enlisting the help of the neighbor boy, the hobo and a stripper who lives in his building, David disguises himself as a family man taking a trip to Mexico in their RV.  Getting in is easy, but getting out with a lot more than a smidgen, while being tailed by a pretty crazy family, is going to be difficult.Now, I&#8217;m going to ask a question.  Have you seen &#8216;RV&#8217;?  You know, that 2006 Robin Williams&#8217; comedy.  Well, these two films are essentially the same film, only this one has drugs and cursing.  Seriously, they are pretty much the same thing.  I will admit to finding &#8216;RV&#8217; rather hilarious, but there is something to be said for inappropriate humor and Jason Sudeikis dry sense of delivery.  This movie works so well!My only real qualm here is that the film is too long.  At nearly two hours, the final act stretches itself thin and really should have been trimmed.  It isn&#8217;t without moments of hilarity, but the film starts to feel like it is running out of steam.But MY GOD this ensemble is brilliant.  Jennifer Aniston is perfection here, proving once again that her charm works just as well on the big screen as it did on the small.  Newcomer Will Poulter is spot on here and should have a big career if he can find the right roles, avoiding being typecast (which I fear will happen to him).  Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn have that &#8216;crazy RV family&#8217; on lock, and Jason Sudeikis anchors this movie with all the right inflections of humor.  Really though, this movie is all about Emma Roberts (possibly the funniest performance I&#8217;ve seen all year) and Ed Helms (brilliant) who bring the funny in so many ways.  Helms has a few scenes, but they are some of the funniest.  His line delivery alone is fantastic.  But Roberts is MVP here, and I never thought I&#8217;d say that.If you want something that is just straight up comedy, with absolutely nothing held back, then this is the film for you.",4,Meet the Millers&#8230;,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,3570,"['Comedy', 'days', 'tricky', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'blur', 'lines', 'point', 'where', 'finding', 'comedy', 'undoubtedly', '8216', 'funny', '8217', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'What', 'comedy', 'What', 'funny', 'Why', 'are', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'dramedies', 'what', 'even', 'mean', 'anymore', 'Why', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'still', 'making', 'movies', 'once', 'while', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'defines', '8216', 'comedy', '8217', 'recklessly', 'laughs', 'way', 'caution', 'wind', 'wall', '8216', '8216', 'done', '8217', 'attitude', 'smile', 'ear', 'ear.I', 'can', '8217', 'promise', 'perfection', 'clearly', 'comedy', 'Conceptually', 'something', 'really', 'shouldn', '8217', 't', 'work', 'mean', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'concept', 'really', 'feels', 'something', 'should', 'crash', 'burn', 'first', 'act', 'Thankfully', 'trailer', 'delivered', 'smidgen', 'hope', 'cast', 'looked', 'really', 'up', 'par', 'outlandish', 'material', '8217', 'been', 'cleverly', 'cut', 'trailer', 'may', 'have', 'passed', 'entirely.I', '8217', 'glad', 'didn', '8217', '8216', '8217', 're', 'Millers', '8217', 'story', 'David', 'Clark', 'immature', 'self-centered', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'still', 'pot', 'pretty', 'crumby', 'apartment', 'building', 'When', 'neighbor', 'Kenny', 'save', 'hobo', 'group', 'thugs', 'David', 'up', 'getting', 'beaten', 'robbed', 'essentially', 'screwed', 'now', 'boss', 'Brad', 'Gurdlinger', 'lot', 'money', 'when', 'given', 'ultimatum', 'go', 'Mexico', 'pick', 'up', '8216', 'smidgen', '8217', 'weed', 'die', 'Enlisting', 'help', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'hobo', 'stripper', 'who', 'building', 'David', 'family', 'man', 'taking', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'RV', 'Getting', 'easy', 'getting', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'smidgen', 'being', 'tailed', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'family', 'going', 'be', 'difficult.Now', '8217', 'going', 'ask', 'question', 'Have', 'seen', '8216', 'RV', '8217', 'know', '2006', 'Robin', 'Williams', '8217', 'comedy', 'Well', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'drugs', 'cursing', 'Seriously', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'will', 'admit', 'finding', '8216', 'RV', '8217', 'rather', 'hilarious', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'inappropriate', 'humor', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'dry', 'sense', 'delivery', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'qualm', 'here', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'final', 'act', 'stretches', 'thin', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', '8217', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'film', 'feel', 'running', 'out', 'steam.But', 'MY', 'GOD', 'ensemble', 'brilliant', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'perfection', 'here', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'charm', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'did', 'small', 'Newcomer', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'spot', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'big', 'career', 'can', 'find', 'right', 'roles', 'avoiding', 'being', 'typecast', 'fear', 'will', 'happen', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'have', '8216', 'crazy', 'RV', 'family', '8217', 'lock', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'anchors', 'movie', 'right', 'inflections', 'humor', 'Really', 'movie', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'performance', '8217', 'seen', 'year', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'brilliant', 'who', 'bring', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'Helms', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'funniest', 'line', 'delivery', 'alone', 'fantastic', 'Roberts', 'MVP', 'here', 'never', 'thought', '8217', 'd', 'say', 'want', 'something', 'just', 'straight', 'up', 'comedy', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'held', 'back', 'then', 'film']",We're the Millers

He hatches a crazy scheme where he and three people he barely knows pretend to be a family as they cross the border in a humongous RV. The dealer's faux relations: an unemployed stripper who can't stand him, a homeless teen girl with a bad attitude, and a dorky boy her age whose klutziness is only exceeded by his lack of experience with the opposite sex.This bit of weed they're picking up turns out to be two metric tons! It's stashed in every possible hiding place in their house on wheels. Two complications immediately occur:1.) The pot actually belongs to a Mexican druglord (our unknowing dealer was conned by his buddy into stealing it) and he wants it back.2.) Their motorhome blows a hose on a 10 incline. The family of fellow RVers that stops to assist is headed by a DEA agent on vacation!With great dialogue and some bizarre sight gags and situations, I must've laughed 25 times during this movie, and I mean, out loud, long and hard.

I normally find the customer ratings to be pretty close to my own thoughts on a movie, but not this time.  Jennifer is the one bright spot in the movie, and I was actually glad to see her take on a role that has her playing a seedy, foul-mouthed stripper because it's such a departure from her normal characters.  She managed to make the best out of a very bad script, but even Jen couldn't rescue this train wreck.  The premise of the movie should have made for a funny-as-hell flick, but between the unbelievably bad script, and the poor acting done by Jason Sudeikis, it just falls flat.  It's not the profanity that the script is laced with that bothers me (when used right, profanity can make a movie funnier, but in this turkey it's just gratuitous), nor is it the constant sexual innuendo that peppers the movie.  It's ""R"" rated and none of that was either unexpected or offensive.  It's just not funny. The best moment of the movie is in the outtakes that are shown just before the credits roll when, apparently unbeknownst to Aniston, the director plays the theme song to ""Friends"" and the other cast members, who were in on the joke, sing along.  If, like me, you're tempted to eject the disc halfway through, at least skip to the end to catch that outtake.

Just the premise of this flick will bring a smile to your face:  A down-on-his-luck small drug dealer concocts a ""family"" for cover to smuggle a couple tons of pot out of Mexico in an RV--allegedly to receive a massive payday from a less than scrupulous kingpin.  His family consists of a stripper, a homeless teen, and a nerd neighbor.  En route the ""Millers"" encounter the full gambit of adventures, from running for their lives from Mexican mobsters, to a laugh-out-loud spider bite, to attracting the attention of a straight-laced family headed by none other than a DEA Agent.  This movie gets up and moves, takes no prisoners in its presentation of locker room humor, and is it ever fun to watch.  And as a bonus, we even receive a small dose of sentimental feel-good fuzzies.This is the first feature I can recall where Jason Sudeikis plays the lead, and here he aptly carries the freight as the stressed out con trying to hold his ""family"" together; and I've been an unabashed admirer of Jennifer Aniston's penchant for raunchy comedy since her sensational performance inHorrible Bosses.  Emma Roberts and a very funny Will Poulter play the Miller ""children""; Ed Helms is grand fun in a small role as Brad Gurdlinger the Drug Lord; yet Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn steal the show as the Fitzgeralds, the square pants couple with a delicious flair to go on the wild side.

1624615,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BC36YWC,FNDNreview,"[10, 12]","If you happen to be one of the people that have yet to take notice of Jason Sudeikis, it's about high time that you did.  Since joining Saturday Night Live in 2005 (of which he recently departed), he has impersonated a ridiculously long list of celebrities and been a part of countless memorable SNL skits.  Sudeikis also has taken his comedy to the big screen, starring in a handful of popular comedies, including Hall Pass, Horrible Bosses, and A Good Old Fashioned Orgy.  He is certainly a rising star in Hollywood and will continue on with his humorous antics in featured films, most recently of which happens to reunite him with his former Horrible Bosses and The Bounty Hunter cast mate, Jennifer Aniston.  Easily recognizable for her role on the popular television comedy, Friends, Aniston has had a series of lackluster film roles.  Together, Sudeikis and Aniston may have found the formula for success in the outlandish new comedy, We're the Millers.Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story), We're the Millers stars Jason Sudikis as David Clark, a small time drug dealer that is forced to travel to Mexico by his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to smuggle a ""smidge"" of marijuana back across the Mexican border into the United States.  In order to present himself as a family man and not draw attention to himself, David enlists the help of a stripper, Sarah (Jennifer Aniston),  a teenager from his building, Kenny (Will Poulter), and a teenage runaway, Casey (Emma Roberts), to pose as his family.  However, David eventually realizes his boss is playing him, which forces the Miller ""family"" on the run from an angry drug dealer from whom they stole a massive amount of drugs.  Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, and Tomer Sisley also star in supporting roles.This film is definitely Jason Sudeikis' best effort and funniest featured role to date.  More often than not, his sarcastic humor and abusive language are amusing, providing plenty of hilarious encounters with virtually everyone he talks to in the film.  Sudeikis carries this film on his back and sprints across the finish line, and while he deserves a great deal of the credit, the supporting cast is also well-rounded, bringing plenty to the table themselves.  In the beginning, the film is a bit slow-going - but once Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, and Jennifer Aniston enter the fray, the film is off and running.  From the very first scene in which this ""family"" is united, the laughs flow constantly, beginning with an airplane scene that will make you blush, have you laughing at the top of your lungs, and leave you begging for air - and that's just within the first 20 minutes.  Other memorable scenes include Will Poulter's interaction with a venomous spider, Poulter's make-out scene with both Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts, and also Jennifer Aniston's heavily advertised stripping scene.  While the stripping scene is roughly the same exact scene that's shown in film's movie trailer, the big deal about it is that this particular scene was used to attract movie-goers (mostly young men) to the film - and odds are it's going to work pretty well.True enough, We're the Millers is extremely hilarious - but unlike a few recent comedies, like This Is The End or The Heat, We're the Millers lacks a sensible plot.  The storyline of the film basically follows a Dumb & Dumber style ""road trip across American"" plot, which makes for some good humor, but bad for anyone looking for thematic, meaningful substance.  This is probably the nicest way of saying the story is stupid, and portrays situations based on the premise of sex, drugs, and complete nonsense.  However, the lack of plot substance is hardly noticeable if you're amused by the style of humor, which was written by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber - both known for scripting Wedding Crashers.  Like the nicely written interactions between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the Miller ""family"" is not as good, but still written with just enough chemistry to be believable (as a family) and ridiculous at the same time.We're the Millers is one of the rare occasions when you should absolutely feel free to ignore most critics and just go with your gut if you think you might be interested in seeing the film.  The majority of critics can look down upon this film all they want and trash it until they're blue in the face.  But, if you happen to see this film with a large a crowd, take notice of nearly every single person up and down the aisles crying from laughter.  It's definitely a sign these disconnected hags have a stick up their ""you know what"" and need to lighten up.  Still, this isn't the first time an absolutely hilarious comedy is vilified by critics and it certainly won't be the last.Overall, We're the Millers is easily the funniest movie of the year, but it's not the best comedy of the year.  Laughs don't always translate to high marks, since there has to be some plot substance - which this film lacks.  Regardless, this film is still worth your time if you want some good laughs.  Obviously, like many other R-rated comedies out there, if you're offended by explicit sexual humor or if you can't handle hearing the F-bomb a hundred times in one sitting, you'll positively hate this movie and everything for which it stands.  On the other hand, if you're pretty laid back and can handle the sexually explicit derogatory remarks and are in need of a good comedy, then you are in for the time of your life.GRADE:

We're the Millers flaunts that ""Rated R"" tag for ""crude sexual content, pervasive language, drug material, and brief graphic nudity."" To which I say, bring it! Some days I'm of a mood for high-falutin' Merchant Ivory cinema. And other days I like to get dirty and wallow in bad taste and later on indulge in self-flagellation. Uh, that's the act of severely criticizing oneself, by the way. Anyway, We're the Millers sates my occasional craving for low-brow humor.In Denver David Clark (Jason Sudeikis), weed merchant since college, still ekes out a livelihood as a strictly small-time pot dea1er. When a disappointing crisis of conscience compels him to step in on some good samaritan kick, David ends up getting rolled by a bunch of thugs. Now short on stash and cash and suddenly owing his supplier (an unctuous Ed Helms) a debt of $43,000 his only way out is to smuggle a smidge (maybe a smidge and a half) of marijuana from Mexico and across the states during the 4th of July weekend. By the way, how do you know Ed Helms is unctuous? Guy's got a freakin' orca in his office tank.David needs a cover that'll pass muster with the border checkpoints. And what's more inconspicuous than a dopey family motoring around in a ridiculous RV? And look, there's David now, having recruited a fake family composed of his neighbors - that mean stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) and the 18-year-old goof Kenny (Will Poulter) - and also surly runaway teen Casey (Emma Roberts). No, the Swiss Family Robinson they ain't. And, south of the border, David promptly demonstrates that he's not so savvy in the risky world of big league narc0tics trafficking. It's like a Griswold vacay gone ever more horribly wrong.I laughed so hard. And when I'm left busting a gut that frequently, I tend to forgive the mishmashed plotting and the caricatured treatment of the cast and the occasional bouts of trying too hard. We're the Millers isn't for everyone. It's offensive on a gross level. F-bombs are dropped with such abandon, The Wolf of Wolf Street is looking over its shoulder. It's lewd and even perverted and explores some genuinely uncomfortable territory that onetheless pays off with laugh-out-loud moments.Jason Sudeikis is a subversive leading man; he's the least likable character here. He grew on me, though, with his unconventional charm and his on-point comedic timing. After all these years, Jennifer Aniston is still mostly recognized as Rachel Green from Friends. And, sometimes, carrying around that baggage of sweet and wholesome is a detriment to a film career. Aniston's been able to surmount that here and there. She's a blast in these R-rated comedies because she always fully commits. And she seems right at home tossing them f-bombs. And if you yet harbor that ever dimming hope of Jennifer Aniston someday going starkers onscreen, well, keep floating that hope, brother. Here, she's a stripper who doesn't really.I like Emma Roberts, but she's wasted in this movie.Will Poulter is a born scene-stealer. There's something oddly lovable about him. This kid is one to watch.At the end, We're the Millers couldn't stick with the program, couldn't keep it as subversive as, say, Bad Santa. An inopportune necessity in plot has the Millers capitulating to formula as they first bicker and mock and can't stomach each other... but maybe one shouldn't dismiss the uniting properties of ""Waterfalls"" by TLC. You know the minute the contentious lot starts singing in harmony over a radio song, it's all over but for the group hug and possibly someone running in the airport (no, there's no airport running here).It's worth it to stick around for the end-of-movie bloopers reel.",4,"""We are not the Brady Bunch.

Jason Sudeikis is funny as always but the entire family cast works well as the dysfunctional group ripping off Mexican drug lords while swinging in a camp site with a DEA agent.

The choreography for her dance is clever.* Emma Roberts (""Hotel for Dogs"") is an amateur smuggler; in real life she's a street kid who robs newspaper vending machines.* Will Poulter (""Son of Rambow"") is an amateur smuggler, in real life he's a dorky student whose mom left for groceries ...last Tuesday. (This actor is British!)* Ed Helms (""The Hangover"") is a professional drug kingpin who isn't above a ""smidge"" of lying and cheating. He's so rich he bought an orca, just because he could.* Nick Offerman (Lots of TV) is a vacationer in a huge RV just like the one our ""family"" uses.* Kathryn Hahn (Lots of TV) is his wife.* Luis Guzm&aacute;n (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") is a federale who is just looking for a bribe...sorta...This silly (but funny) set-up has some deplorable moments with blink-and-you'll-miss-it male nudity, crass humor, lots of profanity, two or three gunshots, no blowie uppie stuff, and a laugh a minute.

1624792,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BC36YWC,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[17, 23]","David (Sudekis) is a drug dealer who is in deep hock to his weasly supplier (Helms). In order to make up his debt, he has to travel to Mexico, pick up a ""smidgen"" of product, and bring it back across the border in one of the biggest RVs ever to roll of the factory line. Fearing his scuzzy appearance will be an immediate tip-off to border control and DEA, David enlists the help of a stripper neighbor (Aniston), a street urchin, and the downstairs loser kid whose mother (apparently) has abandoned him to make it look as if they are just a harmless, clean-cut, ""aw shucks"" type family, thus throwing the scent away from their scurrilous deeds.If you think you can guess how it all ends up, you almost certainly can. The movie doesn't really try anything all that new when it comes to how these kinds of stories frame their arcs. In spite of its predictability, though, the film is legitimately funny. It plows through the standard conflicts and resolutions with the help of some really gung-ho performances and solidly delivered comedic punches, especially with the Sudekis/Aniston duo, both of whom do a stellar job. They're surrounded by more than a few tested talents (Offerman, Marino, Lennon, Hahn, etc.) who all play their characters nearly flawlessly.A sort of anti-family family comedy, this film is full of raunch, sex, violence, and even a bit of graphic nudity, but it never really crosses the line. There are moments when it feels almost like it should have, but it's not out to do anything other than entertain (hence, for instance, the incredibly gratuitous, completely unnecessary, fairly senseless stripping scene halfway through the film, only there to showcase just how fit Aniston remains at her 40+ years of age). And entertain it does, as long as you are prepared for incest jokes (natch), lots of potty humor, and the warm-hearted finale that comedies like these seem required to have. A big part of the charm is that it seems like they had a ton of fun making the film, and that spirit is infectious and catching. The movie's not doing anything all that new, but it's still a lot of fun to watch it do it.",4,"The ""Fun"" In ""Dysfunctional Family""",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2130,"['David', 'Sudekis', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'deep', 'hock', 'weasly', 'supplier', 'Helms', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'debt', 'travel', 'Mexico', 'pick', 'up', 'smidgen', 'product', 'bring', 'back', 'border', 'one', 'biggest', 'RVs', 'ever', 'roll', 'factory', 'line', 'Fearing', 'scuzzy', 'appearance', 'will', 'be', 'immediate', 'tip-off', 'border', 'control', 'DEA', 'David', 'help', 'stripper', 'neighbor', 'Aniston', 'street', 'urchin', 'downstairs', 'loser', 'kid', 'mother', 'apparently', 'abandoned', 'make', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'harmless', 'clean-cut', 'aw', 'shucks', 'type', 'family', 'thus', 'throwing', 'scent', 'away', 'scurrilous', 'deeds.If', 'think', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'up', 'almost', 'certainly', 'can', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'anything', 'new', 'when', 'how', 'kinds', 'stories', 'frame', 'arcs', 'spite', 'predictability', 'though', 'film', 'legitimately', 'funny', 'standard', 'conflicts', 'resolutions', 'help', 'really', 'gung-ho', 'performances', 'solidly', 'delivered', 'comedic', 'punches', 'especially', 'Sudekis/Aniston', 'duo', 'whom', 'do', 'stellar', 'job', ""'re"", 'surrounded', 'more', 'few', 'tested', 'talents', 'Offerman', 'Marino', 'Lennon', 'Hahn', 'etc', 'who', 'play', 'characters', 'nearly', 'flawlessly.A', 'sort', 'anti-family', 'family', 'comedy', 'film', 'full', 'raunch', 'sex', 'violence', 'even', 'bit', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'never', 'really', 'line', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'almost', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'out', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'entertain', 'hence', 'instance', 'incredibly', 'gratuitous', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'fairly', 'senseless', 'stripping', 'scene', 'halfway', 'film', 'only', 'there', 'showcase', 'just', 'how', 'fit', 'Aniston', '40+', 'years', 'age', 'entertain', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'prepared', 'incest', 'jokes', 'natch', 'lots', 'potty', 'humor', 'warm-hearted', 'finale', 'comedies', 'seem', 'required', 'have', 'big', 'part', 'charm', 'had', 'ton', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'spirit', 'infectious', 'catching', 'movie', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'new', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'do']",We're the Millers

Along the lines of what American Pie started for the modern era comedies and has continued with movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, Horrible Bosses etc.  So if that is not your brand of comedy, then skip this because you will hate it.It tells the story of a small time drug dealer (played by Jason Sudeikis) who is forced/conned by the local drug &#34;kingpin&#34; played by Ed Helms doing basically a total jackass version of his character from The Office, into smuggling a &#34;smidge&#34; of marijuana from Mexico back into the US.  He enlists the help of the dorky neighbor kid (played by Will Poulter), the stripper living in his building (played by Aniston who although in her mid 40s has a body better than a lot of 20 year olds) and a neighborhood runaway (played by Emma Roberts) to be his fake family.  The thought being it will be easier to get across the border disguised as a family on vacation.The story is somewhat predictable from there, but it is not meant to be anything that gets you thinking too deeply or a big mystery,  It is all about obstacles thrown in the way and character interactions.  All the main characters have moments to be very funny.  I am not really sure you can say that anyone in particular steals the show (although Katherine Hahn and Nick Offerman as the vacationing family the Millers are forced to tag along with when their RV breaks down come pretty close.If you do get the blu ray, there are quite a few mini behind the scenes and making of features.  There are also a couple gag reels, and deleted/alternate scenes.  None of them are particularly long, but in total amount to about 45 min worth of material, so definitely enough for those who like to go through the bonus features.  And the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.As I said above the movie is not for everyone.  You likely already know whether you will like the brand of comedy or not.  If you do, it is definitely a movie worth checking out.  It is, in my opinion one of the better comedies in the last couple years.",5,"A great, raunchy comedy",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2154,"['brand', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'Millers', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'very', 'raunchy', 'color', 'lines', 'what', 'American', 'Pie', 'started', 'modern', 'era', 'comedies', 'continued', 'movies', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'etc', 'So', 'not', 'brand', 'comedy', 'then', 'skip', 'will', 'hate', 'it.It', 'story', 'small', 'time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'played', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'who', 'forced/conned', 'local', 'drug', '34', 'kingpin', '34', 'played', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'doing', 'basically', 'total', 'jackass', 'version', 'character', 'Office', 'smuggling', '34', 'smidge', '34', 'marijuana', 'Mexico', 'back', 'US', 'help', 'dorky', 'neighbor', 'kid', 'played', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'stripper', 'living', 'building', 'played', 'Aniston', 'who', 'mid', '40s', 'body', 'better', 'lot', '20', 'year', 'olds', 'neighborhood', 'runaway', 'played', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'be', 'fake', 'family', 'thought', 'being', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'get', 'border', 'disguised', 'family', 'vacation.The', 'story', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'there', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'anything', 'thinking', 'too', 'deeply', 'big', 'mystery', 'obstacles', 'thrown', 'way', 'character', 'interactions', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'can', 'say', 'anyone', 'particular', 'steals', 'show', 'Katherine', 'Hahn', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'vacationing', 'family', 'Millers', 'are', 'forced', 'tag', 'along', 'when', 'RV', 'down', 'come', 'pretty', 'close.If', 'do', 'get', 'blu', 'ray', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'mini', 'scenes', 'making', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'gag', 'reels', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', 'None', 'are', 'particularly', 'long', 'total', 'amount', '45', 'min', 'worth', 'material', 'so', 'definitely', 'enough', 'who', 'like', 'go', 'bonus', 'features', 'movie', 'great', 'blu', 'ray.As', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'will', 'like', 'brand', 'comedy', 'not', 'do', 'definitely', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'opinion', 'one', 'better', 'comedies', 'last', 'couple', 'years']",We're the Millers

1624830,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BC36YWC,M. Oleson,"[22, 30]","Note:  First, this review may have spoilers.  Second, after almost 900 submitted reviews, Amazon's computerized censor rejected my original draft, presumably because they didn't like a word or two.  They don't say what it is that is offensive, so undaunted, I continued to make edits until it passed muster.  The version here is my 4th draft.  I've indicated the changes from the original by using [brackets].  See if you can come up with the original word.  There are no words that begin with the letter ""F"" and all would be familiar to a typical 7th grader.I read one review that said that no one would buy the premise of Jennifer Aniston being a [ecdysiast]. I assume he's convinced that the 44 year old actress wouldn't look or be able to pull it off. Well, I bought it and trust me there are plenty of 20 year old ladies out there who only wish they had the physical appeal of Ms. A.Now that that is out of the way, Rose quits her job at the [club where women get undressed] because her boss Todd (Ken Marino) insists that she have sexual relations with interested clients. About to get booted out of her apartment for late rent payments, she runs into a neighbor at the mail box. More on that later. David (Jason Sudekis), the neighbor, is the neighborhood drug dealer whose clientele is mostly businessmen, housewives and professionals. But no kids. Principles you know. He is a [jerk] and basically has no friends but for a recently turned 18 year old from the building named Kenny (Will Poulter).Hearing a ruckus outside, Kenny confronts a quartet of street thugs who are hassling Casey (Emma Roberts) an up-and-coming tart complete with tats, body piercings and plenty of black leather. David, against his better judgment intervenes, only to have his cash and cache of drugs stolen by the thugs. When he tells his story to his boss (Ed Helms), his only option is to go to Mexico and bring back a huge stash of marijuana under the name of Pablo Chacon. David doesn't know that Chacon is one of Mexico's most ruthless drug lords.Now back to Rose. David, worried about the border crossing coming back to the U. S. rents a large RV and hires now homeless Rose to act as his wife and Kenny and Casey to play his children. This requires a make-over for all as they must appear to be a suburban family just on vacation. It pretty much works except that the real Chacon is giving chase realizing that his henchmen gave the drugs to the wrong gringo.This film by Rawson Marshall Thurber and a screenplay by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber has a lot going on for it. It's funny, but this isn't a family friendly film, if your family includes young children. Even adults will get a few eye-openers, so if you're easily offended look elsewhere. The ""R"" rating is well earned. Sure we get to see the inside of a [club where women get undressed], but the filmmakers do pull their punch here in that the ladies actually don't [remove their clothes].Rose has a great routine well into the film when she must prove she is an [exotic dancer] for Chacon and his cronies. Ms. Aniston has made a career out of gold medal titillation without seeing the... uh... [trophies]. So it is here, but the ""Flashdance"" shower routine provides a stimulating tease. There are some funny scenes with a real All-American family in an RV vacation. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play the parents and Molly C. Quinn is the teen daughter.In what must have been a good news-bad news scenario for actor Poulter, we see his character fumbling the ball on a first kiss opportunity with Ms. Quinn's character, and is given lessons by Casey and Rose in rapid succession. Kenny turns beat red and I don't think it was makeup. Later, he must expose his privates after being bitten on the [testacles] by a large furry spider. While this movie isn't for everyone, I found it funny as [heck].",4,"Jennifer Aniston reunites with Jason Sudekis for another ""R"" rated romp",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,3848,"['Note', 'First', 'review', 'may', 'have', 'spoilers', 'Second', 'almost', '900', 'submitted', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'computerized', 'censor', 'rejected', 'original', 'draft', 'presumably', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'word', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'offensive', 'so', 'undaunted', 'continued', 'make', 'edits', 'passed', 'muster', 'version', 'here', '4th', 'draft', ""'ve"", 'indicated', 'changes', 'original', 'using', '[', 'brackets', ']', 'See', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'original', 'word', 'are', 'words', 'begin', 'letter', 'F', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'typical', '7th', 'grader.I', 'read', 'one', 'review', 'said', 'one', 'would', 'buy', 'premise', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'being', '[', 'ecdysiast', ']', 'assume', 'convinced', '44', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Well', 'bought', 'trust', 'are', 'plenty', '20', 'year', 'old', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'physical', 'appeal', 'Ms.', 'A.Now', 'way', 'Rose', 'job', '[', 'club', 'where', 'women', 'get', 'undressed', ']', 'boss', 'Todd', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'have', 'sexual', 'relations', 'interested', 'clients', 'get', 'booted', 'apartment', 'late', 'rent', 'payments', 'neighbor', 'mail', 'box', 'More', 'later', 'David', 'Jason', 'Sudekis', 'neighbor', 'neighborhood', 'drug', 'dealer', 'clientele', 'mostly', 'businessmen', 'housewives', 'professionals', 'kids', 'Principles', 'know', '[', 'jerk', ']', 'basically', 'friends', 'recently', 'turned', '18', 'year', 'old', 'building', 'named', 'Kenny', 'Will', 'Poulter', '.Hearing', 'ruckus', 'Kenny', 'quartet', 'street', 'thugs', 'who', 'are', 'hassling', 'Casey', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'up-and-coming', 'tart', 'complete', 'tats', 'body', 'piercings', 'plenty', 'black', 'leather', 'David', 'better', 'judgment', 'intervenes', 'only', 'have', 'cash', 'cache', 'drugs', 'stolen', 'thugs', 'When', 'story', 'boss', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'only', 'option', 'go', 'Mexico', 'bring', 'back', 'huge', 'stash', 'marijuana', 'name', 'Pablo', 'Chacon', 'David', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chacon', 'one', 'Mexico', 'most', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'back', 'Rose', 'David', 'worried', 'border', 'crossing', 'coming', 'back', 'U.', 'S.', 'large', 'RV', 'hires', 'now', 'homeless', 'Rose', 'act', 'wife', 'Kenny', 'Casey', 'play', 'children', 'make-over', 'must', 'appear', 'be', 'suburban', 'family', 'just', 'vacation', 'pretty', 'much', 'works', 'real', 'Chacon', 'giving', 'chase', 'realizing', 'henchmen', 'gave', 'drugs', 'wrong', 'gringo.This', 'film', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'screenplay', 'Bob', 'Fisher', 'Steve', 'Faber', 'lot', 'going', 'funny', ""n't"", 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'family', 'young', 'children', 'Even', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'few', 'eye-openers', 'so', ""'re"", 'easily', 'offended', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'R', 'rating', 'well', 'earned', 'Sure', 'get', 'see', 'inside', '[', 'club', 'where', 'women', 'get', 'undressed', ']', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'pull', 'punch', 'here', 'ladies', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", '[', 'remove', 'clothes', ']', '.Rose', 'great', 'routine', 'well', 'film', 'when', 'must', 'prove', '[', 'exotic', 'dancer', ']', 'Chacon', 'cronies', 'Ms.', 'Aniston', 'made', 'career', 'gold', 'medal', 'titillation', 'seeing', 'uh', '[', 'trophies', ']', 'here', 'Flashdance', 'shower', 'routine', 'stimulating', 'tease', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'real', 'All-American', 'family', 'RV', 'vacation', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'play', 'parents', 'Molly', 'C.', 'Quinn', 'teen', 'daughter.In', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'news-bad', 'news', 'scenario', 'actor', 'Poulter', 'see', 'character', 'fumbling', 'ball', 'first', 'kiss', 'opportunity', 'Ms.', 'Quinn', 'character', 'given', 'lessons', 'Casey', 'Rose', 'rapid', 'succession', 'Kenny', 'beat', 'red', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'makeup', 'Later', 'must', 'expose', 'privates', 'being', 'bitten', '[', 'testacles', ']', 'large', 'furry', 'spider', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'found', '[', 'heck', ']']",We're the Millers

Jason Sudoku and Jennifer Anniston are not interesting. I know that they are popular, but I don't think it is because they are necessarily funny. People give these two a pass, because they are Quote Unquote funny for good looking folks.Most good looking people do not have great personalities. This is a broad generalization and based on non quantifiable nor qualitative merit, but hear me out. One time I met this really attractive girl and she was not cool. Thus I'm sure I know what I'm talking about.So anyway, back to my theory on JS and JA being famous. They are good looking people with just enough personality to separate them from the talent less beautiful folks like Megan Fox; however, if you compare their performance with Nick and Kathryn then the truth is revealed. They have nothing in the funny department. The first half of the film you think that Jen and Nick are doing well, but then Nick and Kathryn roll up in their Winniebago and carry the rest of the movie. Literally! Jen and Nick have to get in Nick and Kat's Winniebago. The Miller's RV breaks down just like their performances and the Fitzgerald's tow this film into Funville U.S.A.They hint at a sequel for this movie, but I think they should do a prequel.

1624875,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BC36YWC,Paul Allaer,"[1, 2]","""We're the Millers"" (2013 release; 109 min.) brings the story of how David (played by Jason Sudeikis) a small-time drug dealer, gets robbed of his cash and stash one day, and in order to make up for it, his drug lord (played by Ed Helms) orders him to go into Mexico and bring back a ""smidgen of weed"" (which turns out to be hundreds of pounds). David dreams up a disguise, and hires (ex-)stripper Rose (played by Jennifer Aniston) (Rose: ""you can't buy me!"" David: ""I'm not buying you, I'm hiring you!""), Casey (played by Emma Roberts), and Kenny (played by Will Poulter) to be his pretend wife and kids. Off they go in a humongous RV, and as sure as night comes after day, this becomes a road trip from hell. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this is one of the better comedies I've see in a long time, one that is actually FUNNY. But beware, it is also quite raunchy, so if that is not your thing, you'll want to stay away (it is rated R for a reasons). Also, this is very much a road movie, and you can't help but make the comparison with Chevy Chase and his ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" movies, and actually ""We're the Millers"" compares quite nicely. The movie contains a bunch of one line zingers that just about had me up in stitches. At one point the whole family is arguing about something and David screams: ""I am Marky Mark and you all are the Funky Bunch! I am the boss"", ha! The movie really hits pay dirt when the Miller family gets to know another family, the Fitzgeralds, with Don and Edie as the parents. Nick Offerman as the 'straight' man is just brilliant. There is, however, one scene in the movie that fell completely flat, namely when Rose has to prove to the bad guys that she once was a stripper, and hence busts out a stripper routine that is straight from Flashdance. I mean, does Aniston really have to do this still? Unnecessary, and not funny.That aside, this is what I would call 'formulaic Hollywood' at its best: lots of funny scenes, and mindless entertainment from start to finish. The movie ends in a way that we could definitely get another visit on the big screen from the Millers in a few years. To which I say: sign me up!

Zwick,"[11, 13]","""We're the Millers"" is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.Jason Sudeikis from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and ""Parks and Recreation's"" Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.What separates ""We're the Millers"" from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.",4,Surprisingly astute Hollywood comedy,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,2057,"[""'re"", 'Millers', 'rarest', 'cinematic', 'creatures', 'high-concept', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'actually', 'works.Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'small-time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'sent', 'skeevy', 'drug', 'lord', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Mexico', 'pick', 'up', 'shipment', 'marijuana', 'order', 'avoid', 'arousing', 'unwanted', 'suspicion', 'border', 'David', 'oversized', 'RV', 'motley', 'crew', 'acquaintances', 'pose', 'all-American', 'family', 'include', 'down-on-her-heels', 'stripper', 'posing', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'hard-edged', 'homeless', 'girl', 'standing', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'big-hearted', 'dork', 'neighborhood', 'assuming', 'role', 'son', 'Will', 'Poulter', '.The', 'story', 'fraught', 'number', 'comical', 'misadventures', 'David', 'unlikely', 'troupe', 'encounter', 'armed-to-the-teeth', 'bad', 'guys', 'family', 'led', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'equally', 'ostentatious', 'RV', ""'re"", 'Millers', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'studio-manufactured', 'comedies', 'sharpness', 'writing', 'appealing', 'nature', 'characters', 'script', 'deft', 'balance', 'subtle', 'wit', 'blatant', 'slapstick', 'modern-day', 'crudity', 'old-fashioned', 'sweetness', 'even', 'rare', 'moments', 'when', 'movie', 'track', 'quick', 'climb', 'right', 'back', 'head', 'destination.Much', 'credit', 'movie', 'success', 'actors', 'who', 'create', 'tremendously', 'likable', 'characters', 'own', 'comic', 'quirks', 'eccentricities', 'rooted', 'least', 'extent', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'scene-stealer', 'Poulter', 'spot-on', 'portrayal', 'lovable', 'nerd', 'serves', 'beating', 'heart', 'movie.So', 'effective', 'fact', 'are', 'actors', 'getting', 'root', 'characters', 'movie', 'can', 'play', 'up', 'whole', 'corny', 'sentimental', 'notion', 'what', 'be', 'family', 'get', 'away', 'Thus', 'keep', 'subversive', 'cred', 'same', 'time', 'warming', 'heart', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'accomplishment', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down']",We're the Millers

Thanks to that inventive comedic writing and a well-blended ensemble of comedians, WE'RE THE MILLERS delivers the funniest movie of 2013 (sorry,This Is The End, you're a close second).The entire cast carries this film perfectly, hitting every note of comedic timing, both outrageous and subtle. Jason Sudeikis (SNL, HORRIBLE BOSSES) plays the character of drug dealer David Clark. Clark runs out of choices and must make a drug run for ""boss"" Brad Gurdlinger, played by Ed Helms (THE HANGOVER). Realizing he can't make this run on his own, he recruits a make-believe family, mothered by Jennifer Aniston's character, Rose O'Reilly. The entire cast deserves recognition, but a special nod is given to Jennifer Aniston for coming back to her FRIENDS-level comedy roots.WE'RE THE MILLERS begins funny and carries the same high (no pun intended) note throughout. What starts as funny, ends as funny--even after the movie. And yes, it is worth viewing the blooper reel; at least you won't have to sit through the credits to view them. Trust me.The only non-comedic parts of the movie are toward the end when the plot needs to start wrapping up. At that point you may start glancing at your watch thinking the movie is a bit long, but then another few more laughs come rolling in and you're back in and immersed with the laughter.Yes, this film is profane and raunchy--and it's hilarious because of it. No, there is no nudity, but Jennifer Aniston has plenty of opportunity to strut her stuff while wearing skimpy material. If you enjoyed WEDDING CRASHERS or any of the other movies mentioned above that the actors have appeared in, then this is a must-see movie. Chances are, you'll laugh your a** off.",5,"Profane, Raunchy, and Utterly Hilarious--Funniest Movie of 2013, So Far",1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,1805,"['WE', ""'RE"", 'MILLERS', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'penned', 'same', 'writing', 'team', 'created', 'WEDDING', 'CRASHERS', 'Thanks', 'inventive', 'comedic', 'writing', 'well-blended', 'ensemble', 'comedians', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'THE', 'MILLERS', 'funniest', 'movie', '2013', 'sorry', 'End', ""'re"", 'close', 'second', '.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'perfectly', 'hitting', 'note', 'comedic', 'timing', 'outrageous', 'subtle', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'SNL', 'HORRIBLE', 'BOSSES', 'character', 'drug', 'dealer', 'David', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'choices', 'must', 'make', 'drug', 'run', 'boss', 'Brad', 'Gurdlinger', 'played', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'THE', 'HANGOVER', 'Realizing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'run', 'own', 'make-believe', 'family', 'mothered', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'character', 'Rose', ""O'Reilly"", 'entire', 'cast', 'deserves', 'recognition', 'special', 'nod', 'given', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'coming', 'back', 'FRIENDS-level', 'comedy', 'roots.WE', 'THE', 'MILLERS', 'funny', 'same', 'high', 'pun', 'intended', 'note', 'What', 'funny', 'funny', 'even', 'movie', 'yes', 'worth', 'viewing', 'blooper', 'reel', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'credits', 'view', 'Trust', 'me.The', 'only', 'non-comedic', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'end', 'when', 'plot', 'start', 'wrapping', 'up', 'point', 'may', 'start', 'glancing', 'watch', 'thinking', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', 'then', 'few', 'more', 'laughs', 'come', 'rolling', ""'re"", 'back', 'immersed', 'laughter.Yes', 'film', 'profane', 'raunchy', 'hilarious', 'No', 'nudity', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'strut', 'stuff', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'material', 'enjoyed', 'WEDDING', 'CRASHERS', 'other', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'actors', 'have', 'appeared', 'then', 'must-see', 'movie', 'Chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'a**', 'off']",We're the Millers

Jason Sudeikis is one of these guys who just gets better and better with every film he does. I used to be a hater, but now I'll see anything that he's in, and We're The Millers is his best movie to date. This story is about a local drug dealer who gets in trouble with his supplier, and the only way out is to become a trafficker. Dave Clark (Sudeikis) decides the best way to do this is to recruit a fake family to make it look like they're just on vacation. Clark recruits his neighbor, a stripper, and a local homeless teen to be his fake family complete and the Millers are born. This film is non-stop laughs, as I said earlier Sudeikis was hilarious, but surprisingly so was Jennifer Aniston. There are a lot of knocks against her, especially when it comes to comedy, but whenever Rachel plays a fowl mouthed, raunchy character, I see her in a whole new light, and she was terrific in this film. Will Poulter is another stand out from the film, he's been acting since a very young age, but to my knowledge has never been in a comedy before. Here he plays a loveable geek that would easily fit in with the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Out of all the funny scenes and outrageous moments, it's Poulter's that made me laugh the hardest. Is this the best movie I've ever seen? Not even close, but it's one of those comedies that just keeps coming at you and never stops.

One night while trying to do the right thing he loses all he has. When his boss finds out he gives him a way to pay him back. All he has to do is move a ""smidge"" of pot across the Mexican border. Thinking that no one will stop a family in an RV he recruits a stripper, a homeless girl and a clueless boy and off they go. But it doesn't go as smooth as he expected. Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching.

Jason Sudeikis plays a loser of a drug dealer who ends up on a gig to smuggle in Mexico by covering-up in disguise with a fake family consisting of a stripper, an awkward teenager, and a troubled teenager who prefers stealing things.The film's execution is pretty much similar to what you may find in a National Lampoon Vacation film with Chevy Chase but with more vulgarity and sex and drug-related humour which explain its R-rating. Nevertheless, the film's subversive nature is what may stand out for some when you consider some of its more satirical elements present by mocking the ridiculousness and stereotypes of drug dealers, kingpins, and the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration law (if Breaking Bad was a straight-out comedy that had cannabis and Mexico and Colorado as the settings).However, it is the more crazier scenes that are more striking here and Kenny, the awkward teenager, is the one and only character that I thought stole the whole film for me. His charisma and presence is so bizarre and simple he does not even mean to come across as crude or offensive when he does. He reminded me a lot of Milhouse van Houten from The Simpsons especially knowing that his parents hardly care for him anyways. His issues trying to deal with women by kissing his so-called sister and mother and singing/rapping out TLC's landmark song, ""Waterfalls,"" are what steal the film for me. In addition, a special scene toward the end with Jennifer Aniston (SPOILER ALERT) hearing the Friends theme song makes her smile and cringe was a stealer too (SPOILER ALERT).But the film felt a bit ordinary at parts compared to films that I really liked before that are similar like Without a Paddle and Wild Hogs but it had more going it and was at times funnier and out-there than the modern prince of R-rated comedy, The Hangover.""",3,"National Lampoon's Vacation, Cheech & Chong, and Breaking Bad all-in-one.

With such a great cast, they simply did not have enough material for the entire movie and attempted to use profanity and 'out of place' sexual content to compensate. This unnecessarily limited their audience base.

Because of an incident caused by Kenny's trying to be helpful, David is robbed of his stash and his money, leaving him no way to pay his supplier to whom he owes a great deal of money. His supplier, a very wealthy drug boss named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) makes  David an offer he can't refuse:  smuggle ""a smidgen"" of marijuana from Mexico for him in order to clear his debt or his thugs will take it out of his hide. While gloomily contemplating how much trouble he's about to be in for, David gets an idea from seeing a cop deal with a goofy touristy family (think the Flanders family from The Simpsons) driving a hugely oversized RV through the neighborhood.  He realizes that while one man attempting to get through customs at the Mexican border would arouse suspicion, _nobody_ would expect a family that white-suburbanly goofy driving a ridiculously large RV of drug smuggling.  All he needs is a 'family' to provide the illusion.  He ends up drafting Kenny, who's innocently eager and has nothing else better to do; Rose, who's desperate after losing her stripper job and getting an eviction notice; and a teenage runaway acquaintance of Kenny's, a hard-edged girl named Casey (Emma Roberts) to pose as his bogus family whom he calls the ""Millers"".Everything seems to go well at first, in spite of personality clashes between David and Rose and between Casey and just about everyone (except Kenny, who's just too guileless for anyone to clash with).  But of course things quickly start to go wrong, starting with David finding out that the ""smidgen"" of marijuana he's supposed to pick up and smuggle turns out to be a thousand pounds that take up every inch of spare space in the RV. And that Brad was being somewhat less than honest on other matters of the deal, which ends up with the Mexican drug lord Chacon (Tomer Sisley) and his chief henchman, One-Eye (Matthew Willig) hot on their trail. With further complications added by another RV-traveling family they meet and then can't seem to get rid of, the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn) and daughter Melissa (Molly Quinn).The comedy comes in varying forms, sometimes high-brow, sometimes low-brow, sometimes just makes-you-squirm awkward (note: this is definitely not a movie for younger kids), and sometimes the pacing is a bit off when a joke goes on for too long, but the superb cast keep things moving with great performances. Jason Sudeikis (Saturday Night Live, Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass) is perfect as David, the small-time marijuana dealer who's been thrown into situations completely out of his depth, talking confident but then freezing up with a deer-in-the-headlights look at the worst possible time. Jennifer Aniston (Friends, Horrible Bosses, The Switch) makes her stripper Rose more than a clich&eacute;, showing her to be quite resourceful in surprising ways, including being the only one to have read the RV's owners manual. Emma Roberts is surprisingly subtle as the runaway teenager Casey, giving her the comic hard-edges one would expect but every now and then letting her soften just a bit to make her character believable. Ed Helms (The Hangover trilogy, The Office) is delightfully over-the-top as David's manipulative and screw-everyone-you-can-every-way-you-can supplier, Brad. The stand-out though is Will Poulter's Kenny, who comes across as the most white-bread white-boy in America (quite an achievement considering that Poulter's actually British) and time and again has the best scenes.  Poulter is largely unknown to American audiences, but he's done a lot of work in British TV and film, including the delightful but largely unknown Son Of Rambow (2007), and more recently The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010) and Wild Bill (2011). Among other comedic gifts, Poulter is blessed with these incredibly arched eyebrows that let him look constantly surprised or confused, which fit the character perfectly. And he also knows how to throw in an unexpected curve as he does in one scene where Kenny out-of-the-blue starts rapping along - quite well - to hip-hop  TLC's ""Waterfalls"" which the group is listening to on the RV radio. You get the impression from the other actors' faces that this may have been entirely unscripted.The film also includes some blooper out-takes during the end credits which are definitely worth catching, particularly one where the crew evidently was playing a joke on Jennifer Aniston and another where Matthew Willig surprises Jason Sudeikis with a highly unexpected move.Recommended as worth seeing for the individual performances, especially Will Poulter, though with the note that this is most definitely not for the younger kids.",4,"A bit uneven, but a great cast makes it funny and Will Poulter is a riot",1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,5439,"['truth', ""'d"", 'have', 'rate', ""'re"", 'Millers', 'something', 'uneven', 'comedy', 'parts', 'being', 'high', 'comedy', 'parts', 'being',
