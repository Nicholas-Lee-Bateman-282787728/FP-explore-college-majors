I was happy to finally find Forever Young on DVD along with Message In A Bottle included.  Somersby is a great movie with Jodie foster and Richard Gere. I had never seen The Lake House but enjoyed seeing it.PS: If you insert a sheet of DVD cloth in between the discs you will prevent scratches.,4,Four romantic movies on 3 DVDs is a good purchase,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,346,"['Four', 'romantic', 'movies', '3', 'DVDs', 'good', 'purchase', 'was', 'happy', 'finally', 'find', 'Forever', 'Young', 'DVD', 'Message', 'A', 'Bottle', 'included', 'Somersby', 'great', 'movie', 'Jodie', 'foster', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Lake', 'House', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'it.PS', 'insert', 'sheet', 'DVD', 'cloth', 'discs', 'will', 'prevent', 'scratches']","4 Film Favorites: Love Stories (Forever Young, The Lake House, Message in a Bottle, Sommersby)"
1337500,A3L4QBE7X57K6X,B003DUBAWG,James K Bowers,"[1, 1]","Four great movies with great chemistry between the actors and actresses in the lead roles. Still, I think an opportunity was lost here. If I were choosing films to group, I'd have built a &#34;Timeless Romance Collection&#34; by substituting &#34;The Time Traveler's Wife&#34; and &#34;Somewhere In Time&#34; as companions to &#34;The Lake House&#34; and &#34;Forever Young&#34;.In another set I have, the movies all end with a death or deaths (tragedy is fine as long as one isn't subjected to a steady diet of it) -- I'm pleased to report this was only half-true of this set. After all, I'm a believer in the &#34;happily ever after&#34; aspect of a love story and tend to shy away from movies of the &#34;it's better to have loved and lost&#34; variety.
