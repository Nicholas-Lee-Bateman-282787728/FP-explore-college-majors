Mr. Hutto hatched 16 wild turkey poults from eggs he received and purposefully imprinted them as their mother, then spent over a year playing mother (turkey) hen to them from before dawn to full dark every day to the exclusion of all else in the deep woods in northern Florida. His book about this experience,Illumination in the Flatwoods: A Season with the Wild Turkey, was discovered by a British producer and RECREATED on film with an actor playing Mr. Hutto's part (who looks like Mr. Hutto) on a ranch in a different part of Florida. The overvoice speaks Hutto's descriptive words. The actor onscreen does not talk much, but occasionally makes turkey sounds as he learns the turkey lexicon. There is nothing fake about the recreation, least of all the young turkeys, and you cannot TELL it is a recreation, period. The cinematography is stunning and the story will captivate you. (You will understand why Ben Franklin wanted the turkey, not the eagle, to be the national bird!)My own experience with a family of wild turkeys in South Dakota had already convinced me of a lot of behavior confirmed by this program. When I stopped my car near them at the side of the road, the family dashed through a hedge and up a hill towards the woods, except for one poult who missed his cue and got separated. He was running in a circle peeping his head off on my side of the hedge. Meanwhile the family waited on the hillside and called to him over and over. Eventually the poult dashed through the hedge and rejoined the family, and they fled into the woods together. When I described this behavior to Mr. Hutto he confirmed it as well as the type of peeps a poult would make under these circumstances.",5,My Life As A [Mother] Turkey,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1826,"['Saw', 'first', 'half', 'program', 'Nature', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'celebration', 'here', 'NYC', 'can', 'recommend', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Hutto', 'hatched', '16', 'wild', 'turkey', 'poults', 'eggs', 'received', 'purposefully', 'imprinted', 'mother', 'then', 'spent', 'year', 'playing', 'mother', 'turkey', 'hen', 'dawn', 'full', 'dark', 'day', 'exclusion', 'else', 'deep', 'woods', 'northern', 'Florida', 'book', 'experience', 'Illumination', 'Flatwoods', 'Season', 'Wild', 'Turkey', 'was', 'discovered', 'British', 'producer', 'RECREATED', 'film', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Hutto', 'part', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Hutto', 'ranch', 'different', 'part', 'Florida', 'overvoice', 'Hutto', 'descriptive', 'words', 'actor', 'onscreen', 'not', 'talk', 'much', 'occasionally', 'turkey', 'sounds', 'turkey', 'lexicon', 'nothing', 'fake', 'recreation', 'least', 'young', 'turkeys', 'can', 'not', 'TELL', 'recreation', 'period', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'story', 'will', 'captivate', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'wanted', 'turkey', 'not', 'eagle', 'be', 'national', 'bird', 'own', 'experience', 'family', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'South', 'Dakota', 'had', 'already', 'convinced', 'lot', 'behavior', 'confirmed', 'program', 'When', 'stopped', 'car', 'side', 'road', 'family', 'dashed', 'hedge', 'up', 'hill', 'woods', 'one', 'poult', 'who', 'missed', 'cue', 'got', 'separated', 'was', 'running', 'circle', 'peeping', 'head', 'side', 'hedge', 'Meanwhile', 'family', 'waited', 'hillside', 'called', 'over', 'Eventually', 'poult', 'dashed', 'hedge', 'rejoined', 'family', 'fled', 'woods', 'together', 'When', 'described', 'behavior', 'Mr.', 'Hutto', 'confirmed', 'as', 'well', 'type', 'peeps', 'poult', 'would', 'make', 'circumstances']",Nature: My Life as a Turkey

Actually, one interesting thing about the baby turkeys (called poults) was that they started communicating with Joe Hutto FROM INSIDE THEIR EGGS.  The film is relatively short, which I appreciated, because the excellent editing meant that each scene was truly engaging and packed with fascinating information about these phenomenally intelligent and impressive birds. As in ""The Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill,"" the bird-human bond becomes a major theme of the film and Hutto's relationships with a couple of the more human-oriented birds is as moving as anything I've seen along these lines. the scenery in this particular area is also very beautiful and the camera work captures it brilliantly.

In addition telepathy among themselves, other animals, and with humans was definitely corroborated with this important experiment.Are wild turkeys sentient? This well done research has proved, in my opinion, that they in fact are sentient.I recommend this great documentary to all especially nature and animal lovers.",5,Clever Wild Turkey Behavior,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1411,"['Are', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'sentient', 'impressive', 'documentary', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'raised', 'sixteen', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'who', 'had', 'play', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'learn', 'wild', 'turkey', 'language', 'such', 'cluck', 'purr', 'cackle', 'putt', 'cutt', 'yelp', 'including', 'varied', 'intonations.Joe', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'astonished', 'concept', 'loyalty', 'instinct', 'sixth', 'sense', 'sovereignty', 'presence', 'illusion', 'time', 'wild', 'animals', 'exhibit', 'instance', 'other', 'displays', 'cellular', 'intuition', 'creatures', 'are', 'able', 'distinguish', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'who', 'are', 'harmless.Interestingly', 'Hutto', 'discovered', 'turkeys', 'noticeable', 'independence', 'limitations', 'time', 'humans', 'are', 'subjected', 'apparently', 'are', 'not', 'constrained', 'clocks', 'watches', 'calendars', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'live', 'NOW', 'enjoying', 'serious', 'important', 'moment', 'worries', 'possible', 'future.This', 'up', 'other', 'questions', 'possibility', 'most', 'animals', 'plants', 'might', 'have', 'totally', 'dissimilar', 'concept', 'regarding', 'illusion', 'time', 'addition', 'telepathy', 'other', 'animals', 'humans', 'was', 'definitely', 'corroborated', 'important', 'experiment.Are', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'sentient', 'well', 'done', 'research', 'proved', 'opinion', 'fact', 'are', 'sentient.I', 'recommend', 'great', 'documentary', 'especially', 'nature', 'animal', 'lovers']",Nature: My Life as a Turkey
