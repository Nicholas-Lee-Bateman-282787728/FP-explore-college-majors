I have not seen the first two seasons, but I'm very attached to the third. My roommates and I have been drooling over the relationship between Nate and Jennylee and can never wait for the next episode (which is odd, because we don't usually care for reality TV!).I hope this show comes out on DVD.

If a girl can't cook or take out a T-888 Terminator Destroyer, don't call back!Can anyone tell to what extent this reality TV series is real or if everyone is just acting for the cameras and a paying audience? A social experiment on air it may be, it can be watched as plain entertainment if only for a quick laugh.The girls in this entire series think they're so hot but they're not!At most, their looks won't last another 10 years after wear and tear.I don't like the way some of them made disparaging remarks on the geeks.Not cool at all!No serious man should waste any time on girls like these in real life!Girls like these usually end up as serial divorcees not knowing where to go or what they want in life, and usually end up marrying men who abuse them 24/7. They don't need rescuing. They need a real education, much more than a GED cert.Geeks!
