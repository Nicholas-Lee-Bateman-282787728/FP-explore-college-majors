1384339,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0043GZ6RO,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 12]","An African-American gay teenager from New York finds himself living with relatives in rural Alabama, following the death of his mother.  Sequan has to share a room with the family's son, a star basketball player, who quickly senses his weakness and rapes the young man.  Sequan also faces challenges at school, except for one girl who becomes a friend and plays matchmaker between him and her own kid brother.This is an outstanding film, well written, directed, acted and photographed, providing a dark picture of the problems in a small-minded Southern town, including corruption, violence, rampant drug use among teens, petty thefts, and latent racial tensions. Won awards at several film festivals, including a well-deserved one for Derrick Middleton (Sequan).  DVD includes commentary, extended and deleted scenes.  Unrated, but would be R for sexual content (no nudity).

1384341,A1WPCLH2ZACWPH,B0043GZ6RO,"Charlie B. ""Charlie""","[6, 7]","A friend told me about this movie a few weeks ago, so I decided to purchase it since he gave a glowing review about it.  I myself was also just as impressed.  The story centers around a gay Black teenager named Sequan from Brooklyn, whose mother passes and he moves to Alabama to live with relatives (though it is never revealed if they are kin to his mother or father).  He is immediately thrown into a mix of unfortunate events that expose the ills of the people who reside within the town he now calls home.[SPOILER ALERT] Sequan is booksmart and intelligent, but still manages to come off as ""soft"" to the rest of the world.  As soon as he moves in with his aunt, he is immediately bullied by his cousin Michael, who is a star on the high school basketball team.  Others in his English class continue to taunt him as well, and he is subject to beatings by Michael and Ahmed, another player on the basketball team who also is a drug dealer.  One night Michael approaches him about his sexuality and forces him to undress and take pictures of him in compromising positions, before finally forcing him to engage in sexual acts with him.  This continues throughout the course of the film, with Michael later admitting to Sequan that he is gay but it is not accepted and will not be good for him and his goals of eventually reaching the NBA.Sequan attempts to find solice in his uncle, who is the town's sherrif, and asks to stay with him and his wife, a moderately successful children's book writer.  His uncle finds excuses not to grant Sequan's request, despite being suspicious of his bruises from the beatings and comments about him from Michael during an interregation about a missing gun and murder.  Ahmed's girlfriend, Lori, befriends Sequan after seeing the boys beat him one day and his response to possibly being beat again the next day in class, and they become close.  He gives her a book by James Baldwin that his deceased mother gave him, and she begins to think for herself rather than following the crowd, which infuriates Ahmed, as he is already jealous of the way she responds to Sequan.  After overdosing on drugs one night during an outing at the carnival, Jake, Lori's brother, picks the two up, and they begin to talk.  Michael becomes jealous after seeing Jake drop him off that night, and claims his position in Sequan's life, telling him that he belongs to him only.  The next day, the three hang out and teach Sequan how to swim in the river.  Trusting them, he reveals that Michael has been raping him.Sequan's uncle moves closer on his investigation of the missing gun when someone calls to alert that the body of a missing boy has been found near the river.  His uncle revs up his investigation, which takes him back to the high school where it is revealed that the principle was aware of the murder but ignored it because it involved Ahmed, among others, who is also one of the star basketball players.  As the locker searches commence, Michael's locker is searched and the camera with the nude shots of Sequan is discovered by his uncle.  Michael flees the school and his uncle goes to search for Sequan.  Sequan and Jake ride with Lori, who attempts to cover up Ahmed's illegal activities by gathering all the drugs and money, but he is fast on their trail and confronts her at the house with his boys.  Sequan hides in Lori's truck, where the missing gun has been stashed in the glove compartment the entire time, and threatens to shot Ahmed if he doesn't let them go.  Ahmed pulls one off on Sequan, shoots him in the stomach, and Lori and Jake take him to get help.  Sequan's uncle shows up at the house where Ahmed is and shoots him, then finds Sequan lying in a nearby field with Jake as Lori looks on in her car. [SPOILER ALERT]Growing up in Alabama myself, I felt the movie was an accurate depiction of the mindsets and stereotypes of some in the South who have not lived outside the comfort zones they have made their own reality.  It resonated with me on a personal level, and reiterated a universal theme of the tendecy we as people have to just look the other way when we know something is wrong, and ignore it until the absolute worst happens.I would say that the cover photos and subsequent summary on the back of the DVD are a bit misleading.  This movie does not really focus on a relationship between a young interracial couple.  In fact, that bond only occurs within the last 15-20 minutes of the film in which Jake (Lori's brother) is introduced.  If anything, the main character, Sequan, is just a link to all the events that transpire throughout the course of the film.  The plot was definitely much bigger than Sequan's sexuality.Features to the DVD include audio commentary by the director and producer, extended and deleted scenes, outtakes, and theatrical trailer.  Great film, acting, and direction.  Impressed with the fact that it told a different story unlike some of the other more main stream Black gay films.  Definitely worth the purchase, I highly recommend this film.",5,Exceptional,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,5034,"['friend', 'told', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'decided', 'purchase', 'gave', 'glowing', 'review', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'impressed', 'story', 'centers', 'gay', 'Black', 'teenager', 'named', 'Sequan', 'Brooklyn', 'mother', 'passes', 'Alabama', 'live', 'relatives', 'never', 'revealed', 'are', 'kin', 'mother', 'father', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'mix', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'expose', 'ills', 'people', 'who', 'reside', 'town', 'now', 'home', '[', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'Sequan', 'booksmart', 'intelligent', 'still', 'come', 'off', 'soft', 'rest', 'world', 'As', 'soon', 'aunt', 'immediately', 'bullied', 'cousin', 'Michael', 'who', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'Others', 'English', 'class', 'continue', 'taunt', 'as', 'well', 'subject', 'beatings', 'Michael', 'Ahmed', 'player', 'basketball', 'team', 'who', 'also', 'drug', 'dealer', 'One', 'night', 'Michael', 'sexuality', 'forces', 'undress', 'take', 'pictures', 'compromising', 'positions', 'finally', 'forcing', 'engage', 'sexual', 'acts', 'course', 'film', 'Michael', 'later', 'admitting', 'Sequan', 'gay', 'not', 'accepted', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'goals', 'eventually', 'reaching', 'NBA.Sequan', 'attempts', 'find', 'solice', 'uncle', 'who', 'town', 'sherrif', 'stay', 'wife', 'moderately', 'successful', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'uncle', 'not', 'grant', 'Sequan', 'request', 'being', 'suspicious', 'bruises', 'beatings', 'comments', 'Michael', 'interregation', 'missing', 'gun', 'murder', 'Ahmed', 'girlfriend', 'Lori', 'Sequan', 'seeing', 'boys', 'beat', 'one', 'day', 'response', 'possibly', 'being', 'beat', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'class', 'become', 'close', 'book', 'James', 'Baldwin', 'deceased', 'mother', 'gave', 'think', 'rather', 'following', 'crowd', 'Ahmed', 'already', 'jealous', 'way', 'Sequan', 'overdosing', 'drugs', 'one', 'night', 'outing', 'carnival', 'Jake', 'Lori', 'brother', 'two', 'up', 'begin', 'talk', 'Michael', 'jealous', 'seeing', 'Jake', 'drop', 'off', 'night', 'position', 'Sequan', 'life', 'telling', 'only', 'next', 'day', 'three', 'hang', 'teach', 'Sequan', 'how', 'swim', 'river', 'Trusting', 'Michael', 'been', 'raping', 'him.Sequan', 'uncle', 'closer', 'investigation', 'missing', 'gun', 'when', 'someone', 'alert', 'body', 'missing', 'boy', 'been', 'found', 'river', 'uncle', 'up', 'investigation', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'revealed', 'principle', 'was', 'aware', 'murder', 'ignored', 'involved', 'Ahmed', 'others', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'star', 'basketball', 'players', 'locker', 'commence', 'Michael', 'locker', 'searched', 'camera', 'nude', 'shots', 'Sequan', 'discovered', 'uncle', 'Michael', 'school', 'uncle', 'search', 'Sequan', 'Sequan', 'Jake', 'ride', 'Lori', 'who', 'cover', 'up', 'Ahmed', 'illegal', 'activities', 'gathering', 'drugs', 'money', 'fast', 'trail', 'house', 'boys', 'Sequan', 'Lori', 'truck', 'where', 'missing', 'gun', 'been', 'stashed', 'glove', 'compartment', 'entire', 'time', 'shot', 'Ahmed', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Ahmed', 'one', 'off', 'Sequan', 'shoots', 'stomach', 'Lori', 'Jake', 'take', 'get', 'help', 'Sequan', 'uncle', 'up', 'house', 'where', 'Ahmed', 'shoots', 'then', 'Sequan', 'lying', 'nearby', 'field', 'Jake', 'Lori', 'car', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'Growing', 'up', 'Alabama', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'mindsets', 'stereotypes', 'South', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'comfort', 'zones', 'have', 'made', 'own', 'reality', 'resonated', 'personal', 'level', 'reiterated', 'universal', 'theme', 'tendecy', 'people', 'have', 'just', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'ignore', 'absolute', 'worst', 'happens.I', 'would', 'say', 'cover', 'photos', 'subsequent', 'summary', 'back', 'DVD', 'are', 'bit', 'misleading', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'focus', 'relationship', 'young', 'interracial', 'couple', 'fact', 'bond', 'only', 'last', '15-20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Jake', 'Lori', 'brother', 'introduced', 'anything', 'main', 'character', 'Sequan', 'just', 'link', 'events', 'transpire', 'course', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'definitely', 'much', 'bigger', 'Sequan', 'sexuality.Features', 'DVD', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'producer', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Great', 'film', 'acting', 'direction', 'Impressed', 'fact', 'told', 'different', 'story', 'other', 'more', 'main', 'stream', 'Black', 'gay', 'films', 'Definitely', 'purchase', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Rivers Wash Over Me

The acting, directing, and screenplay were all exceptional and deserve an Oscar for all categories!  This movie floored me with it's intimacy, honesty and realism. Rarely have I seen the topics of racism, sexism, homophobia and male rape being treated with such clarity. Rivers Wash Over Me is a mile stone, in that it critically looks at the horrors of male rape within the African American community without passing judgement. We seem to feel and understand everybody's position.  Every performance by each actor was of great quality and this film definitely did not get the attention and praise it deserves.  ""Precious"" won all the awards, though I believe ""Rivers Wash Over Me"" is much more riveting, confrontative and intimate than ""Precious"".  The African American community has clearly evolved to a point where they can look at a man raping another man. Sadly, in the gay community, that reality stays mostly off radar, so far.
