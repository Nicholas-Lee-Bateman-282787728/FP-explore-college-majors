815012,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0001WTV7U,Michael Butts,"[5, 7]","A KISS SO DEADLY has so many things wrong with it, I find myself surprised to give it three stars.  Overall, I found myself enjoying the premise, although it's fairly obvious early on what's going to happen.  The scriptwriter throws in an obvious red herring, but once the movie picks up, it becomes pretty evident who the murderer is.  Charles Shaughnnessy's character is so unlikeable, it's easy to overlook his character, and focus on the younger ones.  Deedee Pfeiffer does a credible job as his daughter and Charlotte Ross as the vixen Amanda is quite good.  Kerrie Keane does a good job as Shaughnessy's puzzled wife.  Even with its erratic pacing and derivative context, it still manages to be okay entertainment.",3,DIRTY OLD DAD,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,720,"['KISS', 'SO', 'DEADLY', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'find', 'surprised', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'Overall', 'found', 'enjoying', 'premise', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'early', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'scriptwriter', 'obvious', 'red', 'herring', 'once', 'movie', 'up', 'pretty', 'evident', 'who', 'murderer', 'Charles', 'Shaughnnessy', 'character', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'easy', 'overlook', 'character', 'focus', 'younger', 'ones', 'Deedee', 'Pfeiffer', 'credible', 'job', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', 'Ross', 'vixen', 'Amanda', 'quite', 'good', 'Kerrie', 'Keane', 'good', 'job', 'Shaughnessy', 'puzzled', 'wife', 'Even', 'erratic', 'pacing', 'derivative', 'context', 'still', 'be', 'okay', 'entertainment']",A Kiss So Deadly
