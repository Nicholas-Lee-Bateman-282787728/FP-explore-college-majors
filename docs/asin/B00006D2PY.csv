712475,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00006D2PY,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I enjoy films that can stand on their own two feet.  Films that are unique, unparalleled to others within the same genre.  While watching ""Business of Strangers"" a decently acted film boasting the powerhouse of Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles, I began to see that this film was just a continuation of several other films of the same vein placed together with one dramatic change, the choice of women as protagonists.  Now, I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this change; I personally think that Stockard Channing is a force to be reckoned with, while Stiles continues to try to find her true inner talent, but I do have a problem with a blatant ""cut-and-past"" work coming from ideas that could genuinely be creative.  Hear me out on this first, did anyone else - while watching this film, want to revisit a little gem called ""Tape""?  Or, bear with me on this one, I had a huge impulse to re-watch the film ""Company of Men"" after this one because there was that exact same sort of broodiness, anti-gender message lit throughout both.  Maybe I am seeing these three films in an obscure light, but the similarities seemed unquenched.With that said, how did I feel about this film?  My first thought dealt with the randomness of the character interaction.  The fearfulness of Channing's Julie Styron seemed unprecedented, and when we witnessed her with clients, the decision to take her forward was laughable.  Was she as good as she seemed, or was she just playing the corporate field to better her advantage?  The other question that came to mind was her coincidental neurosis dealing with the sporadic meeting with her boss.  There was nothing, outside of moving the plot forward, which would have indicated these sudden laps of shame in her profession.  The drop-in of Julia Styles suddenly meeting in the same business setting (having never met before), missing a plane together, and coincidentally ending up at the same bar sharing drinks and eventually inner secrets, just flabbergasted me.  Why would these two ever meet up in a typical setting?  While I don't want to think that this was just a film about the imagination of Channing, it did make you question and use the word ""why"".  Typically I like this mind-boggling element in films, but in ""Business of Strangers"", it just didn't work.  There was no ""tell"" in this film, and that tugged at me the wrong way in this film.  The eerie patience that was demanded of the viewer left us with no moment of satisfaction.  There was quite a bit of wait, but no payoff at the end.  On one hand we have a very self-centered woman, career bent, but possibly not happy with her choices, and yet on the other we have a care-free young lady, experimental in nature, ready to change the world one person at a time.  It seemed too forced, too stereotypical - too manipulative.  I needed more similarities; I needed more shock to really bring these two strangers together.  This tried to be a darker rendition of ""The Odd Couple"" with drinking, rape, and random revenge.  Force enough onto a character (or characters), the audience begins to believe that it is a Hollywood feature, and you meaning imperatively finds itself lost in the trenches.Let's move forward.  Acting.  In ""Business of Strangers"" it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest that I have seen of Stiles or Channing.  Their chemistry was decent, but it didn't compare to that of those characters in ""Tape"" or ""Company of Men"".  This was obviously a stage film, meaning that it was a small play that had the unique opportunity to see the other side of a film camera.  It was a boring premise, which is one reason I feel so fooled by this film, which was followed up by my second pet peeve of this film, it never tackled any real issues.  Who were these two characters that we so dutifully were thrust into their lives?  What makes them tick?  What is their past?  What is their future?  Most importantly, at least with this film, what makes them connect?  Unlike other films brought from the stage, ""Business of Strangers"" answers none of the above.  Perhaps it is my male view on a very personal female film, but this was released to general audiences, so the appeal had to be broad.  It was not emotional, it was not sad, nor was it victorious at the end.  While I do not think rape is a minute problem in America, I do feel that I needed more with Channing and Stiles.  Was she lying about the incident?  Was she just trying to get Channing to release something from within?  I wanted answers, I was pining inside for them, but the never arrived.  Unlike ""Shape of Things"" (another film that I feel fits within the genre), there was just something missing.  It was as if a big chunk of the film was misplaced.  Fred Weller did a decent job, but his motive was missing.  That, my friends, is the biggest element forgotten in this film.  Motive.Director Patrick Stettner did his job by bringing the characters together in, albeit, random events.  He set the stage with surprisingly the darkest of corners and hidden hotel rooms.  There was even a moment of unneeded tension in a scene (while I felt it wasn't needed) that was done with some bit of grace, but he continued to forget the element mentioned above ... motive.  There was no reason to answer the question ""why"", when our characters were taking unmotivated photographs, when they were about to commit murder, or when they were talking to each other like they had known each other for years.  There was no reason for director Stettner to get us from point A to point B, so in my opinion, he moved the action along through a series for unconnected points.  Sure, the acting was meaty, but the words that they spoke merely were attached to a script which eventually had to have and ending.  For a little over and hour, I watched good actors read through a bad script.  Again, if there was more creativity in the motion of Stettner's work, then maybe I would have felt better by the ending, but I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat, the characters didn't have me questioning the validity of my own life, nor was I ready to gush Niagara Falls over the body of work.  By the end, I felt bland, as if I just watched a feminist remake of ""In the Company of Men"" or ""Tape"".Overall, I wish I could say that I can suggest this film, but I cannot.  The acting, with enough said above, you should realize that these are two great actors working through an abominable script.  The story was pieced together probably overnight without much thought going into the entire process.  It was dark, but the tones were miscommunicated as we tried to grapple with the idea that these two people had never met before but spoke as if they were best friends.  Coupled with dialog that would make kindergarteners chuckle, ""Business of Strangers"" was a film packed with missed possibilities.  If you are looking for either a redemption film or a film about coping with your tough job, may I suggest anything outside of this film.  Mamet's vision of business is phenomenal, while I repeat more about Linklater's ""Tape"", will show you how a concept, done correctly, makes for a powerful film.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Women in the

Stockard Channing has always been a fine actress, bringing a level of sensitivity and intelligence to every role. And Julia Stiles just gets better and better in each new film. She has character and grit; she's a bold young actress who takes professional risks. The two performers are perfectly matched here in a test of wills, with an insightful and devious script that never goes where the viewer anticipates. It's both a commentary on age and wisdom versus youth and nerve, and a study in values.I saw this movie when it opened, (on a large screen) and the one scene I found jarring was the opening--a long examination of Channing's face that has, like that of so many of her peers, been surgically airbrushed to remove hints of age. But Channings' hands are very much a part of this sequence, and they are the hands of a woman who is almost sixty. It's a distracting (mercifully short) scene and I wish director Stettner had paid closer attention--focusing only on Channing's face. Unless Stettner is as devious as the film itself and wanted us to be aware of the drastic contrast between face and hands--a statement about the lengths some women will go to to remain viable, whatever their careers. Somehow, I doubt that he was that subtle or that clever. But I did have to wonder about that face and those hands.That aside, this is a consummate food-for-thought film.Highly recommended.",5,Stellar performances,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,1489,"['character', 'study', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'always', 'been', 'fine', 'actress', 'bringing', 'level', 'sensitivity', 'intelligence', 'role', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'new', 'film', 'character', 'grit', 'bold', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'professional', 'risks', 'two', 'performers', 'are', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'here', 'test', 'wills', 'insightful', 'devious', 'script', 'never', 'where', 'viewer', 'commentary', 'age', 'wisdom', 'versus', 'youth', 'nerve', 'study', 'values.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'opened', 'large', 'screen', 'one', 'scene', 'found', 'jarring', 'was', 'opening', 'long', 'examination', 'Channing', 'face', 'so', 'many', 'peers', 'been', 'surgically', 'airbrushed', 'remove', 'hints', 'age', 'Channings', 'hands', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'sequence', 'are', 'hands', 'woman', 'who', 'almost', 'sixty', 'distracting', 'mercifully', 'short', 'scene', 'wish', 'director', 'Stettner', 'had', 'paid', 'closer', 'attention', 'focusing', 'only', 'Channing', 'face', 'Unless', 'Stettner', 'as', 'devious', 'film', 'wanted', 'be', 'aware', 'drastic', 'contrast', 'face', 'hands', 'statement', 'lengths', 'women', 'will', 'go', 'remain', 'viable', 'careers', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'was', 'subtle', 'clever', 'did', 'have', 'wonder', 'face', 'aside', 'consummate', 'food-for-thought', 'film.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

First of all, I don't particularly like Julia Stiles. In fact, sometimes I find her downright irritating, but in this film I find her more interesting. Stockard Channing will just always be cool in my book. This movie's about one older successful career woman, Channing & a new underling who doesn't make the best first impression, Stiles. After the initial 20 or so minute set up the movie gets down to business with the women spending time together, swimming, joking & of course drinking. At first you're not sure whether they will be friends or foes. Then you realize it's not about that.

Her life is in her face, her sature, her under-the-surface-insecurity that makes her hard driven persona seem ready for a fall.  Julia Stiles, a would-be writer from a wealthy family trying to hide her easy ride into life behind tattoos and lies, is the perfect foil for Channing.  They begin as adversaries, come together for reasons of loathing men, and progress into a turbulent relationship that serves to reiterate  their inherent character flaws.  Director Patrick Stettner handles the story well and draws fine perfomances not only from the two stellar main characters, but from every actor utilized.  This is not a pretty story, but a cathartic one, and once again shows that there is nothing Stockard Channing cannot do.  She is surely one of the finest actresses on the stage, in film and television today.",4,"A finely acted, disturbing film",1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,1339,"['BUSINESS', 'OF', 'STRANGERS', 'be', 'strip', 'other', 'naked', 'spotlight', 'character', 'Friends', 'would', 'never', 'address', 'story', 'unlikely', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'friends', 'anyway', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'driven', 'psyches', 'feel', 'unable', 'view', 'reality', 'world', 'tunneled', 'drives', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'once', 'again', 'bravura', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'clawed', 'way', 'trailer', 'park', 'trash', 'be', 'hardened', 'CEO', 'important', 'company', 'life', 'face', 'sature', 'under-the-surface-insecurity', 'hard', 'driven', 'persona', 'seem', 'ready', 'fall', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'would-be', 'writer', 'wealthy', 'family', 'trying', 'hide', 'easy', 'ride', 'life', 'tattoos', 'lies', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Channing', 'begin', 'adversaries', 'come', 'together', 'reasons', 'loathing', 'men', 'progress', 'turbulent', 'relationship', 'reiterate', 'inherent', 'character', 'flaws', 'Director', 'Patrick', 'Stettner', 'story', 'well', 'fine', 'perfomances', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'stellar', 'main', 'characters', 'actor', 'utilized', 'not', 'pretty', 'story', 'cathartic', 'one', 'once', 'again', 'nothing', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'surely', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'stage', 'film', 'television', 'today']",N/A

712488,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006D2PY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","""The Business of Strangers"" is a film that is either going to hook up, in which case you will find it compelling, or it is going to leave you cold and disinterested.  It is essentially a two-character drama, in which Stockard Channing plays Julie Styron, a business executive for a software company who spends most of her time on the road going her job, and Julia Stiles plays Paula Murphy, an audio-visual techie who shows up 45 minutes late for an important presentation.  Julie thinks she is about to be fired when her boss flies in for a dinner meeting and Paula knows she is fired when she hears Julie do exactly that on her cell phone.  But it turns out that Julie is being promoted to the top spot in the corporation and she feels magnanimous at this good fortune to spare Paula, put her up in a hotel room at company expense, and spend the night drinking with this strange young woman.Your tendency is to think the Julie and Paula are women at the opposite ends of the same road, but that is only partially true at best.  For Julie the job has become everything: she is an ""uberfrau,"" to quote Paula, who is divorced, childless, and drinks scotch just like a man.  In contrast, Paula dismisses her work as ""only a money job,"" declaring she is really a writer, collecting observations of the human condition as she makes a buck.  Despite some rough spots, the two get along together pretty well, playing a quick mind game in the elevator with some businessmen, playing around in the pool during a swim, and chatting in the sauna.  But then Nick Harris (Frederick Weller) shows up.  He is an executive headhunter than Julie called in when she thought she was going to need a job.  He ends up stuck overnight when all the flights get cancelled and he joins the two women.  Julie thinks nothing of it, but Paula is very cold because she knows Nick, and when she tells Julie what Nick did one weekend in Boston, the move veers off towards a much darker direction.Nick is just a pawn and not a player in this drama, mainly because nobody else can really fit comfortably onto the screen in any of the scenes between Julie and Paula.  Clearly Paula is playing some sort of a game here, but exactly what sort, what the rules are, and what it all means is unclear.  But the result is intriguing, from the time the two women start drinking double shots of the most expensive cognac at the hotel bar to the end of the film.  Even if we question the actions of the characters, most specifically in terms of their motivations, the performances are compelling enough to keep us along for the ride.Off the top of my head I cannot think of another film in which an older woman and a young woman go at it like this; the conventional Hollywood film is more likely to flip the genders rather than the ages of the two battling characters.  I have to admit I was surprised to find the film was written and directed by Patrick Shettner, because that sort of undermines the idea that we are being offered insights into the psyche of the modern businesswoman.  But that may explain as well as anything while the end of the film strikes such a discordant note with viewers.  But you have to admit that few parts of this story take the conventional route and in the end the performances of Channing and Stiles, going after each other in ways I do not recall seeing before, is enough to justify watching the film.  There are really no extras on this DVD, but that seems to make sense with &quot;The Business of Strangers&quot;; take this film at face value and make of it what you will.",4,"Julia Styles, Stockard Channing and their strange dance",1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,3566,"['Business', 'Strangers', 'film', 'either', 'going', 'hook', 'up', 'case', 'will', 'find', 'compelling', 'going', 'leave', 'cold', 'disinterested', 'essentially', 'two-character', 'drama', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Julie', 'Styron', 'business', 'executive', 'software', 'company', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'road', 'going', 'job', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Paula', 'Murphy', 'audio-visual', 'techie', 'who', 'up', '45', 'minutes', 'late', 'important', 'presentation', 'Julie', 'be', 'fired', 'when', 'boss', 'flies', 'dinner', 'meeting', 'Paula', 'fired', 'when', 'Julie', 'do', 'exactly', 'cell', 'phone', 'out', 'Julie', 'being', 'promoted', 'top', 'spot', 'corporation', 'magnanimous', 'good', 'fortune', 'spare', 'Paula', 'put', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', 'company', 'expense', 'spend', 'night', 'drinking', 'strange', 'young', 'woman.Your', 'tendency', 'think', 'Julie', 'Paula', 'are', 'women', 'opposite', 'ends', 'same', 'road', 'only', 'partially', 'true', 'best', 'Julie', 'job', 'become', 'everything', 'uberfrau', 'quote', 'Paula', 'who', 'divorced', 'childless', 'drinks', 'scotch', 'just', 'man', 'contrast', 'Paula', 'work', 'only', 'money', 'job', 'declaring', 'really', 'writer', 'collecting', 'observations', 'human', 'condition', 'buck', 'rough', 'spots', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'playing', 'quick', 'mind', 'game', 'elevator', 'businessmen', 'playing', 'around', 'pool', 'swim', 'chatting', 'sauna', 'then', 'Nick', 'Harris', 'Frederick', 'Weller', 'up', 'executive', 'headhunter', 'Julie', 'called', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'need', 'job', 'up', 'stuck', 'overnight', 'when', 'flights', 'get', 'cancelled', 'two', 'women', 'Julie', 'nothing', 'Paula', 'very', 'cold', 'Nick', 'when', 'Julie', 'what', 'Nick', 'did', 'one', 'weekend', 'Boston', 'move', 'veers', 'off', 'towards', 'much', 'darker', 'direction.Nick', 'just', 'pawn', 'not', 'player', 'drama', 'mainly', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'really', 'fit', 'comfortably', 'screen', 'scenes', 'Julie', 'Paula', 'Clearly', 'Paula', 'playing', 'sort', 'game', 'here', 'exactly', 'what', 'sort', 'what', 'rules', 'are', 'what', 'unclear', 'result', 'intriguing', 'time', 'two', 'women', 'start', 'drinking', 'double', 'shots', 'most', 'expensive', 'cognac', 'hotel', 'bar', 'end', 'film', 'Even', 'question', 'actions', 'characters', 'most', 'specifically', 'terms', 'motivations', 'performances', 'are', 'compelling', 'enough', 'keep', 'ride.Off', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'older', 'woman', 'young', 'woman', 'go', 'conventional', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'more', 'likely', 'flip', 'genders', 'rather', 'ages', 'two', 'battling', 'characters', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Patrick', 'Shettner', 'sort', 'undermines', 'idea', 'are', 'being', 'offered', 'insights', 'psyche', 'modern', 'businesswoman', 'may', 'explain', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'end', 'film', 'strikes', 'such', 'discordant', 'note', 'viewers', 'have', 'admit', 'few', 'parts', 'story', 'take', 'conventional', 'route', 'end', 'performances', 'Channing', 'Stiles', 'going', 'other', 'ways', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'seeing', 'enough', 'justify', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'extras', 'DVD', 'make', 'sense', 'quot', 'Business', 'Strangers', 'quot', 'take', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'make', 'what', 'will']",N/A

But here, both actresses are superb, thanks to a mostly literate script and very intelligent casting.  Channing can do no wrong; Stiles is inconsistent in her work, but here is terrific as a temp taken on to assist Channing in a presentation, but subsequently fired by Channing--an executive--for showing up much too late to do what she had to.There are interesting hints of what the film is really about throughout.  We see Stiles waiting at the airport--did she really miss the plane, as she explained to Channing, or was she intentionally sitting and waiting, just to show up late?  The subtle glances that Stiles gives Channing and the sole male character, played by Frederick Weller, show that she's thinking of much more than she shows on the outside.Yes, this is a tale of control and manipulation, and the first half hour, sharply sketching the life of a senior sales exec--Channing--is right on target.  Stiles' introduction is also well done and the initial scenes of the two of them together resonate.  But with the introduction of the headhunter--Weller--the film begins to lose some ground.  The sharpness begins to recede and eventually, when Stiles convinces Channing of Weller's crimes, it has become an altogether different film.Yet the differences are ultimately intriguing, because we begin to see what is really going on.  Stiles is super sharp; you get the feeling that she really doesn't have to work at all.  She can get practically anybody else to do it for her, while she sits back and reaps the rewards.  Though initially fired, Stiles is rehired by Channing and the two begin to form a bond based on Channing's guilt and Stiles' guile.This is not a great film--hence the three stars--but it is curiously resonant.  One leaves the theater with a sense of mild disgust, yet later, realizes that the manipulation on display was, in fact, very well thought through.

712491,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00006D2PY,Lleu Christopher,"[2, 3]","The Business of Strangers portrays a bizarre triangle among two women and a man. The primary relationship is between Stockard Channing, a high-powered exectutive and Julia Stiles, her edgy, unpredictable assistant. Much of the film, with its small cast and scarcely populated locations (airports and hotels mainly, sans the normal crowds), has the feel of a play. Although there is some action, when the two women conspire to play a potentially deadly prank on a predatory male associate, this is a dialogue-centered movie. Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles give excellent, nuanced performances, and this helps us forget that their characters are essentially movie cliches. Channing is the successful female executive who is unhappy with her personal life --predictably, she carries a portable pharmacy in her pocketbook, which becomes an essential part of the story. Stiles is another kind of cliche --the ice-cold, predatory type who can be either male or female but who is almost a mandatory presence in independent post film noir.

The other younger, equally crafty, as well as wickedly sly woman is played by Julia Stiles who no doubt is cast by design to steal the glances of the male audience as well as opposite genders in this story of destructive payback.Stiles' character is manipulatively calculating as she subtly unfolds a selfish plan to map a path to own success yet who's comeuppance could inevitably be in her near future at the hands of her adversary's lofty rank... or possibly visa-versa given that both become disillusioned by the cardinal sins of greed, envy and last but certainly not least, lust. Gets off the track a bit with the man-humiliation angle which may have went a bit to far but both Channing is stellar and Stiles is something to be reckoned with in this picture in more ways than one as both should be duly commended for their outstanding performances. Comparisons to Neil LaBute's powerful 1997 'In the Company of Men' are inevitable but still stands well on its own.",3,Ladykillers beware! :),1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1243,"['Poignant', 'tale', 'two', 'eager', 'women', 'one', 'passed', 'prime', 'scares', 'still', 'male', 'dominated', 'business', 'world', 'early', 'new', 'millennium', 'aggressively', 'portrayed', ""'T"", 'Tenacious', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'chillingly', 'ruthless', 'frame', 'frame', 'other', 'younger', 'equally', 'crafty', 'as', 'well', 'wickedly', 'sly', 'woman', 'played', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'doubt', 'cast', 'design', 'steal', 'glances', 'male', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'opposite', 'genders', 'story', 'destructive', 'payback.Stiles', 'character', 'manipulatively', 'calculating', 'subtly', 'selfish', 'plan', 'map', 'path', 'own', 'success', 'yet', 'who', 'comeuppance', 'could', 'inevitably', 'be', 'near', 'future', 'hands', 'adversary', 'lofty', 'rank', 'possibly', 'visa-versa', 'given', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'cardinal', 'sins', 'greed', 'envy', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'lust', 'track', 'bit', 'man-humiliation', 'angle', 'may', 'have', 'went', 'bit', 'far', 'Channing', 'stellar', 'Stiles', 'something', 'be', 'reckoned', 'picture', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'duly', 'commended', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Comparisons', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'powerful', '1997', 'Company', 'Men', 'are', 'inevitable', 'still', 'well', 'own']",N/A

Stockard Channing is supposed to be a newly-promoted CEO, and Julia Stiles is a young assistant with the firm.  While working together in the same city, giving various presentations on behalf of the firm, they end up getting to know each other while staying in the same hotel.  Stockard invites Julia to her room for drinks, where she learns that a headhunter she had been using (and who is also staying at the same hotel), raped a friend of Julia's a few years back.  Julia supposedly gets Stockard to try and kill the headhunter, but he ends up surviving.  It was a completely implausible scenario.... a CEO befriending a young assistant of the firm virtually overnight, drinking in front of her, and then allowing herself to be swayed to kill someone.  Not only that, but how often have we already seen films of women taking things into their own hands, and venging the rape of another woman?
