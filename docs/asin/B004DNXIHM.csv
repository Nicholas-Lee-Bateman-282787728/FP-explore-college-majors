It's maybe the best one but it's hard for me to pick a best because I love them all. Some more than others but there's not a bad survivor because all have different people which makes it interesting and some bring back the best of the best.

The cast features the most-loved and most-hated players of all time, and though I don't agree with a few of the inclusions, and would have like to see a few other players instead, overall it's a very strong cast. The first episode is possibly the best first-episode ever, with two injuries at the first challenge, they get down and dirty right away.

If you were thinking about starting watching Survivor, and want to get caught up and know what the show is about, then this is a must have.  If you see this season first, then you really won't know who are the Villains and who the Heros are, and why, but that doesn't matter. I can promise you'll get hooked.Some of the Heros are ones we liked, and played the game as honestly as they could You have Colby.  In the past Colby seemed like a nice guy, but in this season, he was such a grump and a grouch.  It was funny to see him this way.  J.T trusted the wrong people, and did a bone headed move in his season, that cost him, and cost him dearly. In this go around, he's the same nice guy. There are a lot of heros, kind of to many to get into.For the Villains, we have Boston Rob, Jerry, Russell, and others we love to root against. The thing is that Russell is called ""devious"" and a ""villain"". Maybe so, but he's the smartest player that the game has ever seen. He pulls off some amazing blind sides.The challenges are some of the most physical and brutal that any of the seasons has to offer. In more than one, someone is hurt, and in some cases, hurt pretty bad.This season has some amazing blind sides. I mean, so amazing, that they're classics.  You don't know who to trust, even people in the different alliances have trouble trusting each other.  Many times, the course of the games is changed by both tribes, it's so neat to watch.If you're a fan of the show, then you need to have this.

Any Survivor season is worth a purchase, but seeing as the review is for season 20 let me tell you briefly about it.  This season had a great two hour opener to re-aquaint us with Survivors we had met before (some as early as season two).  With such a bunch of experienced players in this season of the game it comes to an all new level.  Highlights include the ""letter"" and ""present"" sent to Russell from an opponent on another team (a caculated but backfired move), the stunning handover at tribal council of two immunity idols by a player also in danger (caculated and clever move) and a tough player passing out stating ""the game almost got the better of me"".  This is a season played by a bunch of people that LOVE this game.  Its worth getting.

Got a chance to watch this season with a friend of mine who's a huge Survivor fan recently and I must say this has to be one of the best competitive and strategic seasons ever put together.  I think casting did a wonderful job picking the right villains and heroes for this season who could bring the drama and gameplay for the fans enjoyment.  Every episode was intense and loads of entertainment.  There wasn't even one player I truly hated throughout the season, not even Russell Hantz.Just a quick insight into the final 3: Parvati makes a fantastic, jaw dropping game play mid way into the season against a fan favorite and past winner not to mention she's a competition beast!  Sandra plays a good game, despite not winning any individuals immunity challenges and being a whether grey area contestant though being on the villains tribe.  Russell, though he is viewed as one as the most evil players in the history of this show, played quite the strategic minded game from start to finish.I don't know if Jeff Probst would ever do this kind of season again, but I sure wouldn't mind.

Despite the return of Russell and the ridiculous amount of idols this season, I actually ended up really enjoying it, although Sandra should've had a much better edit pre-merge, seeing as she's the greatest winner ever (also the greatest two times winner as well did you know?).On the plus side, giving the show a two hour premiere was a fantastic choice and gave us one of the best first episodes ever in the shows history.

As far as it being fake packaging and made ""on-demand,"" you shouldn't worry.

1397315,AN9TLUKFAJHP8,B004DNXIHM,Tung Yin,"[1, 1]","If you are wondering why anyone would buy a season of a reality TV show that you watched live -- and thus know the outcome -- well, I wondered that myself, too. But I remembered really enjoying ""Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains"" when it aired, and the instant video price ($19.99) was pretty inviting. The final kicker was that I was looking for something to load on my Kindle Fire so that I could watch TV while running on a treadmill.And ""Heroes vs. Villains"" has been everything I remembered -- great characters, great scenery, great twists and turns. Interestingly, while I remember the general arc (there are major arcs in the Heroes and Villains tribes before the merge, and then a third arc post-merge), it turns out that I don't actually remember that much about the order of booting. In some instances, I did recall that a player had progressed far, so when an early episode suggested that that player was at risk, I knew something would happen. Still, it has been vastly entertaining.It's also a great show for watching while running. It doesn't demand a tremendous amount of concentration, and a good deal of it is some kind of competitive athletics, so it tends to inspire my running.The picture quality on my Kindle Fire is generally good, but there's a surprising amount of unintentional pixelation (that is, not driven by CBS censors). It could be due to my having a first generation Kindle Fire and not an HD.",5,"The BEST season ever of ""Survivor,"" and great diversion for working out",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1422,"['are', 'wondering', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'buy', 'season', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'watched', 'live', 'thus', 'know', 'outcome', 'well', 'wondered', 'too', 'remembered', 'really', 'enjoying', 'Survivor', 'Heroes', 'vs.', 'Villains', 'when', 'aired', 'instant', 'video', 'price', '19.99', 'was', 'pretty', 'inviting', 'final', 'kicker', 'was', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'load', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'could', 'watch', 'TV', 'running', 'treadmill.And', 'Heroes', 'vs.', 'Villains', 'been', 'everything', 'remembered', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'scenery', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'Interestingly', 'remember', 'general', 'arc', 'are', 'major', 'arcs', 'Heroes', 'Villains', 'tribes', 'merge', 'then', 'third', 'arc', 'post-merge', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'remember', 'much', 'order', 'booting', 'instances', 'did', 'recall', 'player', 'had', 'progressed', 'far', 'so', 'when', 'early', 'episode', 'suggested', 'player', 'was', 'risk', 'knew', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'Still', 'been', 'vastly', 'entertaining.It', 'also', 'great', 'show', 'watching', 'running', ""n't"", 'demand', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'concentration', 'good', 'deal', 'kind', 'competitive', 'athletics', 'inspire', 'running.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'generally', 'good', 'surprising', 'amount', 'unintentional', 'pixelation', 'not', 'driven', 'CBS', 'censors', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'having', 'first', 'generation', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'not', 'HD']",Survivor 20: Heroes and Villains

Most of the extras did not seem to have them, or I was unable to get them to work otherwise, but the show itself is captioned.Overall Recommendation:+Definite BUY for: (a) Survivor fans, (b) people who watched Survivor during its earlier seasons and would like to see some of their favorite players return, and (c) anyone curious about Survivor who hasn't really watched the show much but would like to experience a good season of it-Definite SKIP for anyone disinterested in Survivor, reality TV, etc.Review:Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains is one of the most memorable seasons of Survivor in the show's history. In stark contrast to most seasons, this group of veterans were all about the game from day 1. Tons of twists and turns occurred during this season, including possibly the single stupidest move (and probably most game-changing) any survivor has ever made.Others have reviewed the season, however, so I want to focus on this DVD set. In fact, I'm writing this review specifically because this is the first Amazon Manufactured on Demand (MOD) product I ever bought, and I doubt it will be the last. This is a 10-disc set. Each disc has 2 episodes (or the time equivalent thereof), and there are extras on every disc, ranging from extended exit interviews to the Surviving Survivor special. The first disc is mostly bonus features and setup stuff. The remaining discs contain the episodes. While these are on DVD-Rs according to the Amazon listing, they do not look like DVD-Rs; they have the clear mirror-like back (as opposed to green, purple, or whatever other color tint commercial DVD-Rs have). The discs are all nicely labeled and look largely indistinguishable from other non-MOD seasons' discs.The 10 discs are stored in 3 cases, two 4-disc cases and one 2-disc case. These are standard cases available at most office supply stores, but I have no complaints here. Actually, I like this better than DVDs stored in those ridiculous ""Eco-cases"" that have holes punched in them to cut down on plastic. Whereas those can lead to the insert becoming punctured or otherwise damaged, these cases protect it well. On the topic of the insert, each one is printed on standard DVD-sleeve paper. The cover and spine of each disc is identical except for the part number. The back contains an episode list with original airdates. The only complaint with the sleeve is that the printing for the little grid on the bottom of the back is too light, so it's hard to read. This does not matter much, of course, and the only reason I even bring it up is because it is one of only 2 flaws I've noticed.The second flaw is one that is not unexpected, but somewhat of a shame. Commercially available, non-MOD seasons of Survivor had nice cardboard boxes to store the DVDs on a shelf. The 3 cases are all standalone products, except for the obvious numbering and the fact that on parts 1 and 2, the UPC on the back is replaced by ""1 of 3"" and ""2 of 3."" A cardboard box to keep these in would have been nice, but its absence is hardly enough to warrant lowering the overall score.Finally, a note on the DVDs themselves. When you put these in your DVD player, the normal DVD piracy warning and CBS logo appear, then it gets right to the menus. The menus have nice shots of tropical areas, presumably the locations for filming. No menu audio is present. Everything is simple, clean, and easily navigable, which is exactly what one expects from a DVD menu. Spot checking some of the episodes indicates that they look mildly better than they did when they aired on TV. The picture is clean and all of the colors are wonderful. The audio mix is also enjoyable for this show, showing off the talent of the post production team.I'm primarily writing this review for those who, like me, never bought an Amazon MOD DVD set before, but really wanted this season of Survivor on DVD. I thought MOD products would be slightly better than bootlegs people sell on eBay; I was never expecting this. To those of you unsure about the MOD products, I can wholeheartedly say that it's a very good investment. This set is as good or better than many other in-store TV on DVD sets. It is professionally made, and the minor issues discussed above generally do not detract from its overall quality. On a 100-point scale, I'd probably give it a 98/100 to account for the things that are missing. Still, this set has plenty of extras, is well-made, and contains one of the best and most memorable seasons of Survivor in the show's history. It is a great buy and is strongly recommended to Survivor fans and to those who may have watched the show during its earlier seasons, but stopped at some point during its run.
