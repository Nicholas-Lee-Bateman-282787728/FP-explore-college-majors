This isn't groundbreaking horror, or unrated extreme stuff. Slices reminds me of Creepshow, or TV series like Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt. There's minimal gore and violence and some nice plot twists. The acting is solid, as are the production values. If you liked Creepshow, you'll probably like Slices.",4,Good PG-13 fun,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,411,"[""'ll"", 'like', 'Slices', 'think', 'kind', 'horror', ""'re"", 'looking', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'horror', 'unrated', 'extreme', 'stuff', 'Slices', 'Creepshow', 'TV', 'series', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'minimal', 'gore', 'violence', 'nice', 'plot', 'twists', 'acting', 'solid', 'are', 'production', 'values', 'liked', 'Creepshow', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'Slices']",Slices

Poor acting and directing mar this attempt at socio-horror.  The one bright spot in this collection of shorts is the attempt at something greater than the standard horror fare.

1258593,AIG0FOVXY7ZSN,B002AL2U7S,Len Stoner,"[1, 1]","diced, burned, and never see the light of day again.  Another horrid anthology of slasher shorts. This doesn't qualify as horror as there's nothing remotely terrifying about it.  Every vignette is totally predictable and poorly acted.  A mixture of zombies, vampires, werewolves, and a Jason/Freddy wannabe.  It sounds good.  But everything is in the execution.  And this morass should be executed. Of course, if you liked VHS, then you'll probably like this too.  Does anyone today know what horror really is?  Have these people ever seen Alien, The Exorcist, Psycho, or any Christopher Lee/ Peter Cushing / Vincent Price movies?  Somehow, Amazon finds the worst movies ever made and throw them into Amazon Prime to up the count of free movies.

After watching the first and part of the second sections of the movie (of five), I gave up and threw it in the trash.  About the only reason someone might like it is for the gratuitous violence, and that was poorly done.  The segments I saw were hackneyed, plot-less wonders.  Don't waste your money.
